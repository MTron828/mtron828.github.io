Chapter 2770: A Jerk Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Squid King had been split into four. It was still a Ruler-level Ocean Demon and refused to die easily. Mo Fan asked the Black Totem Snake to continue to attack it.

After the Squid King had been cut into pieces, it could not harden its Lump Thorns. The Black Totem Snake opened its ferocious mouth and devoured the part of the Squid King with its eyeballs.

After the Squid King’s strange lumps exploded, its flesh remained juicy and fresh. Its nerve senses were still active. When the Black Totem Snake swallowed it, it still struggled and groaned.

“There are three of its parts left.” Jiang Yu summoned an Ice Elf. One of the Squid King’s split parts attempted to escape through the sewer under the city. But the Ice Elf froze it.

Freezing inflicted great damage to the already mutilated Squid King. It would die of the cold.

“Little Flame Belle, roast its tentacles!” Mo Fan summoned his Little Flame Belle.

Little Flame Belle could not be happier. It was about time to demonstrate her great roasting skill. The burnt smell wafted all over.

As for the Squid King’s last part, Mo Fan decided to personally take on it. He soaked its last part in the dark quagmire, allowing the darkness and very low temperature to slowly destroy the Squid King’s vitality.

One had to admit that the Squid King was extremely tough. Even though they had used four different methods to kill its split parts, they could still sense its struggle. The tentacles still moved in fury. When the Little Flame Belle roasted it, its tentacles lashed out and destroyed many buildings and streets

The Black Totem Snake was a great helper. It swallowed the Squid King’s tentacles raw. The Black Totem Snake’s stomach was truly bottomless.

The tentacles still wriggled inside the Black Totem Snake’s stomach. It let out a flood of gastric juice to finally digest them. Snakes usually devoured its food alive. The Black Totem Snake could digest anything. The Squid King was no exception.

The Black Totem Snake was used to eating fresh lobsters, prawns and other seafood with Mo Fan. It was extremely picky with its food. After it swallowed the Squid King, the Black Totem Snake found it to be tasteless. It looked disappointed.

Mo Fan could not eat the Squid King, even if it was roasted, because the creature was poisonous. But the Black Totem Snake had no such qualms. No poison could harm it.

“There’s still a large piece of the Squid Kingover here. Do you want to save it for your Black Totem Snake?” asked Jiang Yu.

The Black Totem Snake was a guardian at Hang Zhou. This was Jiang Yu’s first time seeing it. No matter how many times he had seen it from the photographs or videos, he was awed to finally see it in front of his eyes. The photographs and videos did not do justice to the majestic beast that stood before him.

“It dislikes frozen seafood,” said Mo Fan.

The Black Totem Snake was not interested in frozen squid, as well as the flesh soaked in dark mud.

“I didn’t expect you to have such a totem beast with you. You nearly scared the hell out of me! But it was very cool of you to bring along the Black Totem Snake from Hang Zhou!” Jiang Yu gave Mo Fan a thumbs up. It was no wonder Mo Fan had dared to come to Hawaii alone.

“We won’t disperse the poisonous fog yet. We will use the fog as a weapon to deceive as many Ruler-level Ocean Demons as possible,” said Mo Fan.

The poisonous fog lingered in the air throughout the process of killing the Squid King. Ocean Demons basically had no idea what was going on. Even Ye Mei might not necessarily have seen the Black Totem Snake at the bottom of the Aquarius.

Usually, the Squid King would not be so stupid as to confront the Black Totem Snake. If not for the fact that Mo Fan’s strategy had successfully blinded the Squid King to some extent, they might not have been able to kill it.

“Meow!”

The poisonous fog began to disperse. Night Rakshasa meowed.

Night Rakshasa flashed and climbed up a vintage tower. The next moment, a huge splash of blood spilled on the clock tower and trickled down the brass hands on the clock.

Mo Fan and Jiang Yu turned towards it.They saw a mouse-like carcass fall down and smashed on the ground.

“A Hunter Dirty Demon?!” Jiang Yu cried out.

They had to be extra careful with the smaller size Hunter Dirty Demons. A crimson Hunter Dirty Demon with the size of a rat had achieved Ruler level. Even though the Hunter Dirty Demon’s size was tiny compared to the giant ocean beasts, they were vicious and strong.

Night Rakshasa was also small. However, not many could match its combat skills. It had killed an advanced Commander-level Hunter Dirty Beast in the blink of an eye…

“Meow!”

Night Rakshasa stood on top of the clock tower. Its eyeballs moved, scanning the city. Jiang Yu instinctively understood what it meant.

“There were many high grade and Ruler Level Ocean Demons here,” he said to Mo Fan. “However, we’ve yet to discover their exact location. They are coming for us and Aunt Ye Mei.”

“It looks like the Ocean Demons know how to destroy the key to magic formation,” said Mo Fan.

“They must have smelled the Black Totem Snake. So, they are acting cautiously. They didn’t swarm up to us at a time. They are taking advantage of the opportunity to get rid of one of us,” said Jiang Yu.

“You handle them, I am sure. Meanwhile, I’ll take on the Ruler level Ocean Demons,” said Mo Fan.

Jiang Yu refused to give in. “Don’t underestimate me. Do you know what level Night Rakshasa is now?”

“I didn’t stop Night Rakshasa from taking on the Ruler level Ocean Demons. I’m referring to you,” said Mo Fan.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Yu was speechless. Without Night Rakshasa, Jiang Yu was just a jerk.

Wasn’t most of the Summoning level mages the same? They all had to rely on their certain powerful Contracted Beasts.

Jiang Yu had put in a lot of effort in training Night Rakshasa. Night Rakshasa had achieved Great Ruler level. If Jiang Yu was too weak, he would become a burden to the team. Thus, Pang Lai had come with him to Hawaii.

Night Rakshasa was a Dark Holy Spirit that was as powerful as Little Flame Belle.

Mo Fan possessed eight elements of magical power, but Jiang Yu was different from him. Jiang Yu only had to put in all effort in his Summoning element magical power. He had spent most of his resources on Night Rakshasa.

Night Rakshasa had advanced to Perfect form earlier than Little Flame Belle.
