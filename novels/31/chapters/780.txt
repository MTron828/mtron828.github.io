Mochizuki Chihaya was sitting in the row behind the nine students. It looked like she was the captain of the team.

Behind her were Mochizuki Ken, the Japanese commander, Fujikata Tegami, and the others. They were basically the advisors or leaders of the West Guardian Tower.

The crowd sitting with them were people wearing similar outfits. They were students, soldiers, captains, and guests of the West Guardian Tower. There were around thirty of them.

The duels of the West Guardian Tower were not open to the public. As such, they only needed a few people to testify to the outcome. No cameras or recorders were allowed, either.

Gong Yu went up on the stage. He did remember to keep to the basic etiquette.

He glanced at the nine students sitting in the front row before looking at Mochizuki Chihaya sitting behind them.

Mochizuki Chihaya was obviously their captain, and was probably the strongest among them. Gong Yu was quite proud of himself. He was wondering if he should challenge the strongest opponent instead.

However, he gave up on the thought. He had a strong urge to teach the golden-haired Okamoto a lesson. Mochizuki Chihaya had already shown her outstanding control of the Plant Element at the entrance of the West Guardian Tower. It was fairly difficult for him to fight a Plant Magician with his fighting style.

“What are you waiting for? Come up here and prepare yourself to be beaten up,” Gong Yu pointed at Okamoto with a disdainful smirk.

“Don’t you feel too good about yourself?” Okamoto rose to his feet. He bowed at the leaders, advisors, and his fellow students before walking up to the stage.

The two were all set for a showdown. As soon as Fujikata Tegami announced the duel to begin, they immediately left blurry afterimages behind as they moved rapidly around the stage!

Lots of afterimages were moving randomly, as if they were many people sprinting simultaneously on the dueling ground. The Magicians with weaker cultivations were unable to see the fight properly. They had no idea when the two Magicians were exchanging their spells...

“Two speed-type Magicians, interesting!” Tegami smiled.

“There’s something strange about the Chinese representative’s gauntlet,” the Japanese commander quickly noticed Gong Yu’s trump card with his sharp eyes.

“Drawing near to the target like an assassin and relying on their speed to tear their enemy into pieces, yet dodging the critical attacks with the Wind Element. It seems like the fight is either going to last for a long time, or end in an instant,” observed Mochizuki Ken.

“Chihaya, who do you think is going to win?” asked Tegami.

“I’m afraid our opponent’s speed is faster...they are starting to use their equipment.”

Like a battle between two swordsmen, if they thrust their swords at one another at the same time, the one who was quicker would secure the victory. There were not many uncertainties in a showdown of speed like this.

Okamoto decisively activated his magic boots when he realized that his opponent’s speed was faster, just so he could keep up.

Similar to Okamoto, Gong Yu had a pair of magic boots too. Interestingly, Gong Yu’s magic boots were slightly weaker than Okamoto’s. As a result, their speeds were on par with one another after they began to use their equipment!

It was reasonable, since Gong Yu had spent most of his money on his unique claw gauntlet. As such, the rest of his equipment was not as impressive.

The Wind Tracks left by the two Magicians were scattered across the entire stage. They were like countless blue ribbons crossing paths out there. Both Magicians were experts with the Wind Element. Not only were they able to glide around with their Wind Tracks, they could also take advantage of their opponent’s Wind Tracks...

The fight started on the ground before switching to the air. Gong Yu was still looking for the timing and angle to secure victory with his gauntlet. Meanwhile, Okamoto kept dodging the attacks with his agile movement and sharp senses. The duel had been going on for some time, yet it was hard to tell who was going to win it.

It was exactly as Mochizuki Ken had mentioned. The duel was either going to last a long time or end in an instant. As time gradually passed, the two Magicians continued to look for their opportunity. They kept probing their opponents without committing to a full engagement.

The duel was like a sword fighting match. They had been probing their opponents throughout the duel, since it was easier to defend themselves. If they tried to engage harder, they would expose their weaknesses to their opponent instead.

Gong Yu was taking the initiative to attack, yet he did not dare to go any further. He was aware that his opponent was waiting patiently for a chance to counterattack when he could not see any sign of the man panicking!

“Such a boring fight, I feel like yawning. I could easily blast Zhao Manyan’s brother into pieces with a few spells.” Mo Fan felt a bit sleepy after dinner.

It was tiring to watch the duel when the two Magicians kept moving around quickly. He had lost interest in watching it further.

However, while Mo Fan was yawning, a piercing, metallic clash caught his attention.

He took a closer look and saw Gong Yu’s claw gauntlet stabbing into Okamoto’s armor. Fresh blood was flowing out from the gap between the plates.

However, Gong Yu was swept away by a sudden gust of wind. He was knocked flying and landed heavily on the firm ground.

Okamoto was going to cast a spell to finish Gong Yu when the pain from his chest interrupted the channeling. He had failed to take hold of the precious opportunity.

Gong Yu felt dizzy when he landed on the ground. He crawled to his feet with great pain coming from his bones.

He stared at Okamoto with a hint of astonishment and anger. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Gong Yu thought he had already won the fight, yet he did not expect Okamoto to set up a trap with the Wind Disc. Luckily, he had injured Okamoto before the trap was set off, preventing the man from following up with a spell. Otherwise, he would have been totally defenseless when he was swept away by the gust of wind!

“Cunning prick,” Gong Yu harrumphed coldly.

“That’s enough, the winner is the representative from China, Gong Yu,” announced Fujikata Tegami.

Fujikata Tegami did not like the Chinese team, but the duel had to be treated fairly. Okamoto had indeed lost the duel. He had underestimated Gong Yu’s explosive speed, and had set off the wind trap a bit too late.

Someone from the Japanese team stepped forward to treat Okamoto’s injuries.

Jiang Yu helped Gong Yu back and let Nan Rongni check his condition.

“A few bones are broken. Lie still,” Nan Rongni swept her hand across Gong Yu’s body and immediately assessed his condition.

“That bad?” exclaimed Jiang Yu in surprise.

“Humph, I almost gave him a critical blow! That guy must be worse than I am!” insisted Gong Yu.

“The end of the duel was exhilarating. I thought you were going to lose the fight. You’re pretty bold, trying to break through the Wind Disc trap forcibly with your speed,” said Zu Jiming.

“I’ll go next. How embarrassing, he looks like he has gone through Hell when he was only dueling against a Japanese student,” mocked Mo Fan, who did not have any pity for Gong Yu.

“Fine, I’ll go last... but you better not lose. Otherwise, my turn is going to be meaningless,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“Don’t worry, I’ll beat that Japanese woman until she moans in pleasure,” said Mo Fan, patting his chest.

“Pervert!” cursed Jiang Shaoxu.
