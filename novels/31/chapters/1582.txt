Chapter 1584 Magic Caster Mummy

Translated by XephiZ

The ancient Egyptians were very concerned about their fame. Except for the demon child that was hated Khufu, one could easily tell the status and strength of the mummies from the sizes and appearance of their chambers.

The Mummy who only had a tombstone written in blood was indeed not as strong as the team expected, clearly a lot weaker than the Skeleton Mummy. The seven of them had no trouble taking it out.

After dealing with the Tombstone Mummy, the group followed Shreev’s instructions to make their way back to the first chamber.

“I’ve been investigating these mazes with four doors for a long time. These chambers are like a Rubik’s cube. The cubes might be disordered at first sight, but once you solve the first face and follow certain procedures, you’ll be able to solve it quite easily,” Shreev said confidently as he walked into the door.

“If we end up in a different chamber next, I swear I’ll beat the crap out of you!” Zhao Manyan replied.

“That’s impossible!”

The group eventually reached a chamber. The spacious chamber had the shape of a Pyramid. An eerie Huntsman Spider was waiting at the top, and a sarcophagus embedded with diamond-shaped agates was on the ground. The lid was open, and beside it stood a Mummy wrapped in a white shroud, looking almost like a human. Its cold eyes had a hint of mockery as it stared at Mo Fan and the others after they returned to its chamber.

“It really is waiting for us!” Meos was a little spooked, especially after seeing the Mummy staring at them. It was like it had been watching them since they left the chamber. What they had done was utterly stupid in its eyes.

“It must be one of the eight advisors during Khufu’s reign. It enjoyed having Huntsman Spiders as pets. He would feed the people that disobeyed him to the spiders, but I didn’t think it would still be keeping a Huntsman Spider after it died!” Shreev muttered.

“Do we really stand a chance against it?” Heidi asked worriedly.

The Mummy had a strong Ruler-level aura. Its presence was intimidating, even before it attacked. The aura was going to affect their Channeling speed!

“Screw it, we’ll know once we fight it. I haven’t really fought a Ruler-level creature yet, I’ll gladly treat this as my first time!” Mo Fan approached the Ruler-level Mummy fearlessly.

Mo Fan had fought Ruler-level creatures before, but he never fought against one with his own strength.

Every Ruler-level creature was incredibly strong. They could potentially kill even a Super Mage in an instant. Mo Fan was extremely bold to be challenging a Ruler-level creature when he was only an Advanced Mage!

“You’re not going to attack first? I won’t be showing any mercy!” Mo Fan began to construct a Star Constellation when he saw the Advisor Mummy was staring at him.

Mo Fan used his Fire Element right away. Three Soul-grade Flames formed a blazing fireball above him, over thirty meters across. Mo Fan hurled it at the Mummy like Hercules tossing a giant boulder at the enemy!

The fireball roared forward. Its brilliant light dyed the chamber red.

The Advisor Mummy didn’t try to dodge. It suddenly reached its right hand out when the fireball was less than ten meters from it.

An ocean blue, arc-shaped barrier suddenly appeared in front of the Mummy. The fireball was put out as soon as it collided with the barrier. In just two seconds, the fireball of three Soul-grade Flames had turned into white steam. The flames were completely extinguished by the curved barrier!

“Isn’t...isn’t that a Water Spell?” Zhao Manyan was startled.

Even though the spell was slightly different from Water Curtain, it was obvious that the Advisor Mummy had cast a spell, an Advanced Water Spell!

Mo Fan was unwilling to admit defeat. He scattered his flames across the air, which turned into fiery feathers. He shoved his hand forward, firing the fiery feathers at the Advisor Mummy.

The Advisor Mummy did not stand still this time. A blue mist thickened around it; despite its blurred appearance, it somehow resembled a Star Constellation.

A few other veils of mist appeared after the first one. They eventually combined into a huge mist covering a greater area!

“Holy crap, watch out!” Zhao Manyan suddenly screamed.

“What the heck is that!?” Mo Fan was stunned.

The enormous watery mist produced a blue light. More misty patches appeared in the air and filled up the space behind the Advisor Mummy. A loud rumble came from nowhere, sounding like a waterfall.

But the question was, why was there a waterfall here?...

The noise gradually became louder. An enormous figure slowly appeared from the mist, like a mountain shrouded by the mist was moving out of it.

A white wave over two hundred meters high rolled forth ferociously as the ‘mountain’ behind the mist finally revealed itself. It turned out to be a tsunami that could easily fill the chamber to half of its height!

“Catastrophe Wave, it’s a Super Water Spell! Stick close together!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

The others were dumbfounded. The Advisor Mummy was a Mage. It was able to control water with ease!

The pressure from the tsunami was suffocating as it continued to roll forward. Zhao Manyan immediately brought out his trump card. He used his Titan Body to resist the deadly Catastrophe Wave!

People always said the power of nature was the most terrifying. A spell that could Summon a wave comparable to the scale of a natural disaster was utterly terrifying, too. Zhao Manyan’s Titan Body stood in front of the group. They soon noticed it was about to break into pieces. The force of the tsunami was too much for it to handle!

“I can’t stand it any longer. Its power is insane!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

“You must hold your ground. We are going to die if the wave separates us!” Meos said.

The fierce waves could easily break the bones of a human. They would die very quickly if they were hit by the tsunami. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Those with defensive equipment, it’s now or never!” Mo Fan yelled.

Zhao Manyan could not use all his defensive equipment at once, and Mo Fan did not even have any defensive equipment. He could only set up a wall with his Telekinesis to stop the terrifying wall of water, yet the barrier would only be like a sheet of metal compared to the strength of the tsunami!
