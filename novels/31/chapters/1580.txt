Chapter 1581 I“ll cut off my Eighteen Centimeters for You

“Have these creatures been here all along? Why do I feel like they suddenly appeared out of nowhere?” Heidi wondered aloud.

They had not detected any presence of these creatures when they first entered the hall, yet it was quite obvious that these Hellish Cerberi had come for them.

The Hellish Cerberi had disappeared after the battle. They had no idea if the creatures had retreated after knowing they did not stand a chance against the team, or if they were preparing for their next attempt!

“Let’s not worry too much about it now; I believe we are going the right way. Those hounds are the most loyal servants to the Pharaohs. If those Hellish Cerberi are guarding this place, it means we are getting closer to the Pharaoh’s coffin,” Shreev said.

The group continued on its way, and the Hellish Cerberi did not show up again. They passed through the spacious hall and entered an enclosed chamber.

The chamber was huge; space was obviously compressed here. Only the people inside the chamber could see how big it was.

The chamber was triangular, but its domed ceiling had four sides joining at the apex, with the lowest points around the edges. The lowest point of the ceiling was roughly five meters from the ground. In simple words, the chamber perfectly resembled the inside of a pyramid, but Mo Fan knew it was only a confined space inside the enormous Pyramid.

The highest point of the chamber was around four hundred meters from the ground. Zhao Manyan raised his head and stared up at it. He exclaimed, “It’s roughly four hundred meters to the top of the Pyramid. Isn’t that around the height of the Canton Tower? I remember its height was around four hundred and fifty-four meters! Wouldn’t that mean the chamber is the size of the area we could see if we looked down at forty-five degrees from the top of the Canton Tower?”

“It’s around fifty degrees for the Pyramid, so the length of the room is over a kilometer. How extravagant are the ancient Egyptians? Think about it, a square meter for a house in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou is easily in the range of a hundred thousand. This chamber is at least a million square meters in size. The money needed to afford it is enough to train an entire army,” Mo Fan said.

“A square meter at the cemetery is a lot more expensive than a normal house. Mo Fan, you aren’t counting it right,” Zhao Manyan corrected him.

“What are you two going on about? Didn’t you see the coffin hanging up there?” Mu Bai inerrupted with a stern look.

The luxurious chamber was empty. There was only a Huntsman Spider with a golden head and a silver body remaining unmoving at the highest point. Anyone would assume it was a decoration if they did not take a closer look at it.

As a matter of fact, it was quite chilling to look at the spider. It was like seeing an enormous spider in the corner of the ceiling when a person had just turned on the light in a room without expecting anything. The spider would remain unmoving, but yet it felt like the eyes on its head were all fixed on you!

The Huntsman Spider was a lot bigger than a palm-sized normal spider. It perfectly suited the ratio of the spacious chamber that served as a mummy’s bedroom.

A normal Huntsman Spider could not produce silk, but that was not the case for this Huntsman Spider with a golden head and a silver body. Thick strands of silk were dangling from its bloated belly. Coincidence or not, their ends just happened to be right at the center of the chamber.

More shockingly, a coffin was dangling at the end of the silk!

The silk spread out into a web around the coffin and held it perfectly in place. The pitch-black coffin was unmoving up there in the air. It had a noble yet eerie presence!

The others were staring at the coffin alertly as Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were talking nonsense.

The coffin clearly indicated the existence of undead in the chamber. Most low-level undead were lone souls without their own tombs or graves, but the owner of this coffin had a luxurious chamber inside the Pyramid. It clearly displayed how high the status of the undead the coffin belonged to was!

“Could it be a Pharaoh?” Mu Bai asked.

“It’s a Mummy, a Pharaoh’s chamber should be in the higher levels. This one is for a Mummy,” Shreev said confidently.

“A room like this for a Mummy?” Zhao Manyan blurted out in disbelief.

Mummies were nobles in the past. Their corpses were preserved through mummification, so they were able to preserve their power, too. Beings of their power might even evolve after they died. Those nobles had to be rich if they could afford to mummify their bodies after death.

“This is the Great Pyramid of Giza, hence the mummies in it must have had some really high status in the past,” Shreev said.

“It seems to be sleeping. Maybe we can just sneak past it without alerting it?” Zhao Manyan said hopefully.

“Speaking of which, did none of you realize there’s no door in here?” Meos suddenly said.

It immediately reminded the others.

There was no door!

There was no exit!

There was no passage other than the one they came from!

“This is awkward... did we go the wrong way?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“We are going the right way, the chambers of mummies are normally before the chamber of pharaohs. We just haven’t found the exit. If it was so easy to find the paths inside a Pyramid, it wouldn’t have remained a mystery for a few thousand years,” Shreev said.

“What should we do now?” Heidi asked.

“Isn’t that obvious? Didn’t you know you have to defeat the Boss before the next section is unlocked in an MMORPG? It’s time to wake the thing above us and beat him up. It will then open up the door and let us continue on to the next area,” Mo Fan stated confidently.

“...”

“...”

Even though the group was left speechless by Mo Fan’s suggestion, it was indeed the only way they had. There was nothing else in the chamber. Every brick was the same. They were unlikely to find any hidden levels, thus the only way to go any further had to have something to do with the spider and the coffin.

“Mo Fan, should we reconsider it? What if it’s a Ruler-level creature?” Mu Bai asked cautiously.

“Do you think we have a choice?” Mo Fan replied.

Mu Bai thought about it for a while and decided not to stop Mo Fan.

“I know most of the Ruler-level creatures under Khufu’s lead, but I’ve never seen this guy before. Even if he is in the Ruler-level, we should still be able to take him on!” Mo Fan said firmly. It was better to roll up their sleeves and prepare themselves for the fight instead of wasting their time!

“To your positions!” Heidi said.

The team split up. Luckily, the chamber was spacious enough to provide them with sufficient space to cast their spells.

“Sayed, go over there. Shreev, come closer in this direction. Mu Bai, you’re an Ice Mage...” Meos started commanding the team.

“Fiery Fist!” Mo Fan blurted out fiercely before Meos could finish. A huge bunch of flames emerged as an enormous Fiery Fist flew at the suspended coffin. It landed right on the coffin, producing a loud metallic clang!

“Crap, we aren’t ready yet!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

Meos’ face darkened, too. How impatient was that guy? If a Ruler-level creature came out of the coffin, they were all going to die!

The metallic clanging echoed through the chamber. The flames set the white spiderweb on fire. The Huntsman Spider above the coffin finally moved, yet it did not attack the group. It was staring at them with a gloating expression!

BANG!

The coffin landed heavily on the ground, smashing the tiles into pieces. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The spiderweb had burned into ashes, but the coffin was perfectly fine. Everyone began to feel a little nervous, staring at the coffin that had landed in front of them!

A little crack appeared on the coffin as a hand reached out of it. The hand angrily knocked the lid away.

A head wrapped in a white shroud sat upright. Its hollow eyes glared at Zhao Manyan with a deadly glow.

“Damn it, are you blind? I’m not the one that broke your coffin!” Zhao Manyan cursed when he saw the Mummy staring at him.

The white Mummy rose to its feet. It had the figure of a human instead of a beast. Its size resembled that of a human, wholly different from the evil presence it was emitting.

When it stepped out of the coffin, the air began to freeze. The group immediately felt a strong chill, as if they had suddenly fallen into a world of ice. Their bodies shivered subconsciously.

“If that thing isn’t in the Ruler-level, I’ll cut off my eighteen centimeters off and give it to you!” Zhao Manyan took a few steps back, yelling anxiously at Mo Fan.

“Why do I need your hair for? To feed it to the pigs?” Mo Fan shot back.

Heidi and Meos almost lost their minds after hearing the brief exchange. How could those two still bother to outwit one another in a situation like this?

“Door, a door!” Shreev suddenly yelled, pointing ahead.

The others followed his finger and saw an opening had suddenly appeared... the lever to open the door did indeed seem to be the coffin opening up. Once the coffin opened, the door to the next area opened too!

“Just stay here and be my funerary objects, I prefer them alive!” the white Mummy screeched at them murderously.

The Mummy still knew how to talk, and was calling out in ancient Egyptian. Shreev, Meos, Sayed could all understand it. The three immediately felt their hair standing on its end!
