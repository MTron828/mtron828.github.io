“Light Protection: Sacred Shield!” Li Kuang was able to react in time and applied a sphere of golden protection around Mo Fan.

The golden griffin realized that it could not penetrate the thick golden shield with a single move. It was forced to rise into the air and look for another opportunity to strike.

“Trying to run away?” Mo Fan stared at the golden griffin as it rose into the sky. He grabbed forward with his hand and dragged at the golden griffin’s tail...

The golden griffin stopped in the air, beating its wings heavily.

The creature’s wings were quite strong. Mo Fan could feel it slipping away from his Illusionary Claw.

“Space Rhythm: Gravity!” Mo Fan cast the spell quickly, immediately changing the structure of the space around the golden griffin as it was about to break free.

A rhomboid with a silver, glowing frame appeared in the air. The pressure inside the rhomboid was obviously different than that outside it. The golden griffin’s beautiful feathers were all pulled down by a mysterious force.

The creature beat its wings mightily, yet it was shocked to discover that its body was falling slowly, as if more than ten iron balls were hanging onto it, making it extremely difficult to stay in the air.

“Come down here!” Mo Fan quickly completed his Lightning Spell. He waved his hand and immediately summoned a thick, purple-black lightning bolt above the golden griffin.

The lightning descended and landed right on the golden griffin. The creature was already having trouble, and immediately fell to the ground. Some of its feathers even came off and floated in the air.

Mo Fan clearly knew an Intermediate Spell was nowhere enough to defeat the golden griffin. He slammed his fist onto the ground when the golden griffin reached the ground, bringing forth nine fiery pillars to burst out from the ground, and giving the golden griffin an enjoyable bath among the flames!

“I already said I don’t need your help!” screamed the frustrated Herbert.

Herbert gathered a strong wind and charged in Mo Fan’s direction. Apart from the Wind Track he was riding, a strong wind was following him, too. Once he was close enough to Mo Fan, the flowing air would immediately turn into a strong tornado, tossing Mo Fan into the air.

Herbert was rather confident with himself, actually treating himself as the eye of the storm, making up for the slow-moving speed of the tornado. He was basically a mini-tornado charging at a target.

Mo Fan simply decided not to dodge it when he saw the approaching attack. Flames started burning fiercely on his fists...

The Rose Flame and Calamity Fire appeared simultaneously. The two types of flames combined into one on Mo Fan’s fist, which he threw right at the moving tornado!

The flames completely surpassed Herbert’s imagination. He had never seen an Intermediate Spell almost as strong as an Advanced Spell. The storm around him was shattered by the fiery dragons rolling at him. The fierce flames struck him with great might.

Fortunately, the Magic Armor he was wearing still had not worn off. It managed to endure most of the damage on his behalf. Otherwise, he would simply have evaporated after receiving the punch!

Mo Fan’s Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons was so quick that it took everyone by surprise. It blasted Herbert down from the stage. The man was laid on the ground for quite a while before he could rise to his feet.

The members on the English team opened their mouths wide and stared at Herbert on the ground. They totally forgot to lend him a hand at that moment.

The golden-eyed Ayleen on the stage was startled. Her focus was on Mu Nujiao, as she did not expect the ordinary-looking man to possess such shocking strength. He even managed to defeat one of their members before any of them could react!

“That man is pretty strong. Don’t let your guard down!” Ayleen instructed her other two teammates.

Sade was well aware of it. It took his griffin quite an effort just to break free from the man’s control!

“Time to show them what we are really capable of!” Sade ordered the golden griffin to return to his side and started drawing a lunar-white Star Constellation.

The lunar-white Star Constellation formed a stunning, mysterious area. The others could vaguely see the outline of an illusionary door leading to a different dimension standing on the stage.

The door’s outline gradually grew clearer. It was a tunnel leading directly to the Summoned Beast Plane. The door was still not open, but everyone could already hear a loud noise from the other side, eager to rush out of the door.

“Crap, this is bad!” Bai Dongwei was the first to shout out.

An extremely dangerous aura burst out of the mysterious door and spread across the place like a black tide. As a Summoner, Mo Fan clearly knew how dangerous the thing behind the door was. He subconsciously took a few steps backward.

“Blood Beasts of the Land, trample upon this place!” yelled Sade.

The dimensional door sprang open. A pack of bear-like creatures with blood-red hides rushed out from it. The Training Hall trembled from their roars. Their muscular limbs easily smashed the stage into pieces.

The Advanced Summoning Spell did not just summon a powerful creature, but a whole pack of them! They were like a formidable beast tide, trampling everything into ashes!

When the number of Blood Beasts reached a certain amount, they were basically unstoppable as they were stampeding. Mo Fan immediately fled for his life when he saw the terrifying scene.

It was the same for Mu Nujiao, Dongfang Lie, and Li Kuang; no one dared to face the beasts directly!

Mu Nujiao was pretty quick since her secondary element was Wind. Meanwhile, Dongfang Lie was in a bad spot. The pack of Blood-Colored Enraged Bears soon caught up to him and smashed him half a meter into the ground. His expensive armor was smashed into pieces, too... Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

There were lots of different Blood Beasts, including Blood Rhinoceros, Giant Blood Bears, Wild Blood Elephants, most of them as enormous and muscular as tanks!

One could imagine how destructive it was when a group of tanks was charging forward at a speed of almost a hundred kilometers an hour.

The Blood Beasts soon filled up the stage. They were chasing after Mo Fan, Mu Nujiao, and Li Kuang while ramming, stomping, and knocking everything they came upon. Li Kuang used all he had to protect Mo Fan and Mu Nujiao, yet his Light Element and Earth Element were not enough to hold the creatures off still!

“This...this is just too painful to watch!” said Yue Tangxin.

The other defenders nodded in agreement.

This was the Advanced Summoning Spell. The word violent was nowhere enough to fully describe it. The defenders were relieved that they were not involved in the duel when they saw the beast tide devouring the tiny Mo Fan and the others.

“The team always has to rely on me in times like this.” Sade had a confident smile.

“Being able to summon such a huge pack of Blood Beasts, you’re indeed crazy!” Ayleen rolled her eyes.

“It’s nothing! If I have enough energy, the Beast Tide Summoning can last even longer,” grinned Sade.

The creatures summoned to their world through Dimensional Summoning were unable to stay forever. For example, Mo Fan’s Swift Star Wolf had to return to the Summoned Beast Plane after a certain time. The creature was able to stay for a long time because Mo Fan had plenty of energy to support his consumption.

However, Contracted Beasts did not have the same restriction. Little Flame Belle could stay as long as she wished. After all, she was a creature from this world, too.

The Advanced Summoning Spell was able to directly open a giant gate connected to the Summoned Beast Plane and summon a beast tide to trample one’s enemies. In simpler words, it was the same as summoning a pack of large demon creatures to trample the area...

The spell was powerful, but it had strict time restrictions!

The whole stage was almost razed to the ground by the pack of giant bears, rhinoceroses, and elephants. However, as soon as the time limit was reached, the creatures were immediately dragged into a portal and vanished into thin air.

The beasts came all of a sudden and left pretty quickly, too. In the blink of an eye, the place was just spacious as it initially was, although it was now full of holes, marks, broken pieces...

Dongfang Lie totally lost his ability to fight after being stomped by the beasts. He was moved down from the stage to be treated.

Li Kuang also expended all his energy just to protect the team from the beast tide. He looked at Mo Fan and Mu Nujiao with a pale face and said, “The rest is up to you two now. Try dragging the battle out as long as possible!”

Li Kuang did give all he had. Otherwise, Mo Fan and Mu Nujiao might not even have survived the Beast Tide.

Two members on their team were eliminated in an instant. Mo Fan finally realized how strong the English team was.

However, he was not someone to be messed with, either!

“Little Flame Belle, let’s fly!”

Li Kuang had given Mo Fan lots of time. The Rocket Wings were ready to launch. Not long after the beast tide disappeared, the whole Training Hall was set aflame by Mo Fan’s fierce flames.

The burning feathers exploded on Mo Fan’s back, turning him into a missile...

“It’s the same move that defeated the vice-captain of the Egyptian team!” The instructor and defenders were excited.

The punch was able to destroy the vice-captain’s defensive Advanced Spell instantly. It was slightly stronger than most Advanced Spells!

The three representatives of the English team were stunned when they saw fiery wings approaching them rapidly. They had never seen any move like it before, but they were able to tell that the attack was stronger than the punch that had knocked Herbert flying, just from the heat of the flames!

“Rocket Wings: Meteorite Fist!” The flames burned fiercely as a meteorite swept forth. Mo Fan left the nine fiery dragons behind as if they were mere accessories.

Ayleen and her other teammate quickly set up their defense.

A Water Curtain appeared in front of them, followed by a layer of Sacred Light: Rampart, facing the direction Mo Fan was approaching from.

The two layers of defense failed to stop Mo Fan’s Rocket Wings, Meteorite Fist. They were shattered into pieces! Ayleen, Sade, and the third teammate were stunned. They quickly summoned their Shield Equipment...

There were five layers of defense in total. The flames finally stopped moving forward. The three members of the English team could feel cold sweat running down their cheeks. They did not expect their opponent to have a move even stronger than the Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons he already used before!

Meanwhile, on the spectator seat, Dean Song He’s mouth was big enough to fit a goose egg in. Even Feng Li was stunned.

They kept hearing from the others how outstanding Mo Fan’s strength was. However, after seeing it in person today, it was not only outstanding, but totally unbelievable!
