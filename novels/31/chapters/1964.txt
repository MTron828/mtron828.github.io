It was obvious that the Sacred Palace Mages had impressive cultivation, and their speed matched it. They had already reached the plaza after a flash of light from the Potala Palace. They were scanning their surroundings cautiously, like they were searching for something.

Mo Fan looked up and saw Muse Pelina among the Sacred Palace Mages. She was riding a mystical beast that was able to race through the air, further setting off her grand appearance.

“This way. How bold of him to come to the sacred city! We can’t let him escape this time!” a Sacred Palace Mage with a thick ponytail said.

“There are too many locals and tourists around here. We should be careful,” a female Sacred Palace Mage in her forties corrected him quickly.

“Let’s find him first!”

Four Sacred Palace Mages split up into different directions and spread out like four light rays along the axes from the Potala Palace. The crowd gasped in astonishment.

The Sacred Palace Mages usually kept a low profile. They would normally land on the plaza and walk up the mountain to show their respect for the sacred palace unless there was an emergency, so it was rare for them to use such spectacular and stunning magic in front of the people.

For some reason, Mo Fan subconsciously looked back at the street he had just come from. His instincts were telling him that the Sacred Palace Mages were looking for the man in the monk’s robe!

Muse Pelina did not move out with the Sacred Palace Mages. She slowly descended to the plaza, landing before the Priest and the Knights.

Priest Dowell had been waiting for her there calmly all along. He and the knights bowed immediately as she returned. “Is there anything we can do for you, my lady?” Priest Dowell asked.

“We never thought that guy would be bold enough to come to the sacred city. He actually came so close to the Sacred Palace!” Pelina exclaimed.

“Who are you referring to?” Priest Dowell was clueless about the situation.

Pelina did not explain the details. Another figure was moving rapidly up the stairs nearby. Their actual body had already reached the plaza, leaving a whole bunch of afterimages behind.

The figure stopped close to Pelina. It was a man in a European monk’s robe, embroidered with gold. He had a commanding air about him.

“So many powerful Mages!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

It was quite rare to see even a few Advanced Mages in public in most cities, let alone Super Mages. However, Mo Fan had already seen so many powerful Mages within a short period of time around the sacred palace. He was rather impressed, especially since it was his first time in Lhasa.

“Judicator, are you sure he’s less than a kilometer from the Potala Palace?” Pelina asked quickly.

“I’m very sure,” the man whom Pelina referred to as a Judicator responded.

“Will he do something extreme?” Pelina asked.

“Our duty is to arrest or purge him before that happens!” the Judicator declared.

Mo Fan was not far from the group. He could hear their conversation clearly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mu Ningxue asked softly, “Judicator... isn’t that the title for someone of the Heresy Judgment Court?”

“Mm, why are the people of the Heresy Judgment Court here?” Mo Fan agreed with her.

The Holy Judgment Court and the Heresy Judgment Court were more powerful than the Magic Associations of the Five Continents. The Holy Judgment Court was responsible for watching over every Mage, including members of the Black Vatican.

The Heresy Judgment Court’s scope of responsibility was more mysterious. Ordinary people would never come across the Heresy Judgment Court. However, Mo Fan happened to be on the Heresy Judgment Court’s watchlist!

The man in a golden monk’s robe referred to as a Judicator suddenly turned around and stared at Mo Fan like an eagle, as if there was some strange connection between them.

Mo Fan was displeased by that. People had been staring at him weirdly two times in a row within a short period of time. It felt like something on his face was telling people he was a vile person, even though he was actually a Five Good Youth.

{TL Note: Five Good Youth is Internet slang in China. It is used to describe young people who are good at five things: studies, beliefs, work, discipline, and behavior.}

The Judicator came over to Mo Fan and asked him directly, “Who are you?”

“What do you mean by that? Why are you only asking me, when there are so many people on the plaza?” Mo Fan snarled.

According to Old Bao’s friendly warning, the people of the Heresy Judgment Court were all monsters. The old man had asked Mo Fan to stay out of their way if possible. The Holy Judgment Court would stick to the rules, still since they were supervised by the governments and Magic Associations of the Five Continents in the world. As for the Heresy Judgment Court... so far, no organization had dared to oppose them!

“You are Marked,” the Judicator said in an overbearing tone, like he was interrogating a criminal.

“What do you mean?” Mo Fan snapped defiantly in return.

“You have a Marking from the Heresy Judgment Court,” the Judicator explained sternly.

“You’re saying that I have a criminal record in the Heresy Judgment Court?” Mo Fan swore.

“You can think of it that way. It makes you suspicious,” the Judicator declared confidently.

Mo Fan’s expression darkened immediately.

Screw the Heresy Judgment Court!

When he handed the Cold Prince to the Holy Judgment Court, the Holy Judgment Court and Heresy Judgment Court promised to clear his record as long as he did not use destructive power that defied the laws of magic anymore.

A marking?

Mo Fan seriously had no idea when the people of the Heresy Judgment Court had left a Mark on him tagging him as a ‘potential criminal’!

The Marking had worked like a charm. The Judicator instantly recognized him as a problematic person, and stared at him like he was some kind of heretic. The Holy Judgment Court and Heresy Judgment Court could not even keep their promises! What right did they have to stand at the top of the world?

“I’m going to talk to your leaders!” Mo Fan harrumphed coldly.

Those scumbags! Mo Fan had yet to question the Holy Judgment Court and Heresy Judgment Court about how the Cold Prince had escaped and ended up being assassinated. Did they have any idea how many soldiers had died in Beijing when they were fending off the Cold Prince and his men? Weren’t they ashamed to face the heroic spirits of the dead?

“If you weren’t here to disrupt my judgment, the other heretic wouldn’t have had a chance to escape!” the Judicator stated coldly.

The Judicator only knew that Mo Fan had a Marking on him. It did not necessarily make him a true heretic. He would not waste his time on someone like Mo Fan without an order to purge him from his superiors. However, the Judicator was unable to locate the real heretic accurately because of the marking Mo Fan had. The man might have already escaped by now.

Mo Fan lost his temper instantly!

No wonder Old Bao reminded him not to cross paths with the Heresy Judgment Court. The people of the Heresy Judgment Court clearly did not have sound minds!

Not only did they fail to keep their promise and wipe his records, they even blamed him for failing to find the actual person because of their own Marking!

Mo Fan was f**king speechless about the retard’s logic!
