At the People’s Square, the earth pattern had lit up and turned into a complete Seal Formation. The three elements—Lightning, Water, and Light had coalesced into three different colored beads, and they surrounded Dean Xiao.

The three beads contained the Forbidden Curse’s powerful spell. Dean Xiao ascended into the sky and stopped at the highest point in the battlefield. The beads with three different elements glowed in purple, blue, and gold around him. The lights arched across the sky and charged at the Cold Moon Demon Lord’s Prime Waves.

As soon as the three beads came in contact with the Prime Waves, they unleashed their true powers.

The bead with the Lightning element could unleash Sky Lightning. Lightning surged. Each lightning bolt was so bright that it illuminated the pitch-black Magic City. These bolts were capable of creating a sea of fire. Such lightning covered the sky including the southeast and northwest parts, and they gathered in the sky above the Bund.

The sound of the lightning storm was deafening. There were multiple Sky Lightnings. Thousands of lightning struck the Prime Waves within a few seconds. The light was so bright that even blazing sunlight paled in comparison. The world looked as if it had been set on fire by the flaming lightning.

But this was only a part of the fused Forbidden Curse. When the Sky Lightning struck the world, the gold Sacred Chant descended like the wrath of God. The Sacred Chant glowed in radiant gold and descended with splendor. It scorched and “cleansed” the land.

After the two extreme Forbidden Curse “cleansed” the Prime Waves, the blue bead seemed to have disappeared into thin air. But the blue Forbidden Curse bead had already burrowed into the Prime Waves and neutralized the magic.

The Lightning and Light Forbidden Curses had been neutralized and had no effect on the Prime Waves. However, the blue Forbidden Curse bead acted as a catalyst to break down the fortress. After the bead released its magnificent power, the fortress began to crack. At first, the crack was barely visible, but it soon spread to the entire Prime Waves Fortress before collapsing.

“It worked! It truly worked!” President Hong Wu was so excited that he was almost incoherent.

They finally neutralized the Prime Waves Fortress. The terrifying Lightning and Light Forbidden Curses intertwined and shone brightly on the Cold Moon Demon Lord. The creature remained in its place, but its eyes were filled with resentment and hatred!

Dean Xiao had mentioned that the Primes Waves was the Cold Moon Demon Lord itself in disguise.

He was right. The Prime Waves Fortress was not the Cold Moon Demon Lord’s real body. It floated in the sky. When the Prime Waves Fortress collapsed and turned into a pool of water, the Cold Moon Demon Lord revealed its true form.

It was not as terrifying and hideous as expected. It did not look strange and grotesque. It floated above the Huangpu River. It looked like an icy cold human from afar.

Only its eyes, tail, and crown horn set it apart from appearing perfectly human. Still, all this did not affect its throne as the most devilish Ocean Demon Lord.

The Cold Moon Demon Lord resembled the evil Trench Demon that proclaimed itself as the Ocean Godly Prophet.

They did not see the Cold Moon Demon Lord’s legs. Instead, it had countless whiskers that served as its “lower body”. When its whiskers gathered close, they resembled a woman’s long dress, except without a sense of aesthetic beauty.

It had a tail. There were two large whiskers under its whisker-like “lower body”. Those served as its tail. When it lifted its tail, it almost reached its crown horn.

What terrified them the most was that the end of its tail was not the shape of a thorn or a fin. Instead, it was a round, cold, silver eyeball! The eyeball shone in the cold moonlight. It looked noble even in its evil countenance.

Its Cold Moon Eye did not grow on its face. It grew at the end of its tail. I was no wonder it could move its eyeball at incredible angles and keep track of everything.

The Cold Moon Demon Lord’s body resembled a human. It had a torso, arms, neck, head, and orifices. But its Cold Moon Eye on its tail radiated only wickedness.

“The Eye of the Tide! The Eye of the Ocean!” Dean Xiao could not stop himself from blurting out the words as he stared at the bizarre and evil Demon Lord.

The members from the Forbidden Curse Association had heard of the legends surrounding the Eye of the Tide and the Eye of the Ocean. At that moment, they finally understood why the Demon Lord could cast such a powerful, divine spell that spanned across the ocean and land!

The Eye of the Tide had summoned the waves that surged to the skyline in the Pudong sea area. The waves were likened to a destructive tsunami that could drown the entire Magic City

The Eye of the Ocean was the source that created countless holes in the sky, thus allowing icy cold water to pour onto the city. If there was an ocean nearby, it could cast endless spells!

After the Prime Waves collapsed, the Cold Moon Demon Lord remained in the sky. Its skin was blue. Even without the Prime Waves as its disguise, the Cold Moon Demon Lord maintained its arrogance. It looked down at the human’s world, as if it only saw a low-level, dirty civilization below him.

The Ocean Prophets were its pawns and thus, it could control them. The Cold Moon Demon Lord was proficient in human language, but it did not bother to speak. Its demeanor and gaze implied only inevitable destruction. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It wanted to wipe out the Magic City and construct civilization that belonged to the ocean creatures only. It wanted the Ocean Godly Horde to conquer the world!

Boom!

While they were staring at the Cold Moon Demon Lord in shock, a loud sound rang out from Pudong. A red, evil tide charged at them rapidly.

It looked like a tumbling red desert from afar. Each grain of sand represented an evil spirit. The red tide had covered the entire Pudong. Even the large number of Salamanders and Shell Demons paled in comparison to the tide.

The tide looked aggressive and lifeless and filled both sides of Huangpu River. The Ocean Demons trembled in fear upon sensing the imposing aura. So did the humans.

“It’s the Ocean Undead! They have infiltrated our sea area!” Dean Xiao stared at the red Ocean Undead. There was no luster in their eyes.

“Dean Xiao, does this have anything to do with her?” Mo Fan asked in shock.

“She warned us before. Even if we’re aware of the issue now, we can’t do anything.” Dean Xiao heaved a weary sigh.

‘How did Ding Yumian turn into an Undead? How did she gather such a large number of Undead within such a short period of time?’

She was not the primary perpetrator. She was one of the victims. The war by the sea had led to many deaths over the years. Mountains of carcasses and corpses had filled the bottom of the ocean. The blood remained in the seawater by the bay for months. All this served as a fertile ground for the Undead!

But the humans had not explored much about the Ocean Undead. In theory, the Ocean Undead were much more powerful than the Undead of the land. After all, the amount of biological waste deposited in the ocean far exceeded the land surface!
