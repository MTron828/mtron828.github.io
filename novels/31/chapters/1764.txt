The huge Rock General had doubled its previous strength and speed. The creature fixed its eyes on Mo Fan. It smashed every rock in its path into pieces as it charged at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan noticed how unfavorable the situation was for him. He quickly cast Earth Wave and slid down the slope. He was a lot clumsier without the help of the Shadow Element and Space Element, so the Earth Wave was too slow. The six-meter Rock General was rapidly gaining on him. It slammed its fists onto the ground, flinging several waves of dirt and stones into the air!

Mo Fan was sent flying by the incredible force of the waves. As that happened, another Rock Monster jumped out from the side and grabbed Mo Fan as he lost his balance in the air.

Mo Fan felt his body tightening up. The Rock Monster was holding him in its hand.

The Rock Monster did not crush Mo Fan with brute force. It was slamming him against its chest instead. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan realized what the Rock Monster was trying to do, and drew a golden-brown Star Orbit in the nick of time. A Rock Fang immediately stuck out from the rock beside the Rock Monster and stabbed it right in the arm to hinder it.

The Rock Monster could not feel any pain. It was furious at not being able to absorb Mo Fan into its body!

Mo Fan broke free from the Rock Monster’s grasp while it was struggling to move its arm. He nimbly jumped onto a rock and glanced at the Huge Rock General charging at him again.

“Damn it, I have had enough of this!” Mo Fan cursed.

He stomped the rock and dodged the massive Rock General’s hand like a fish weaving through a net, before landing on the Rock General’s head.

He raised his hand before slamming it down on the Rock General’s head together with a golden-brown Star Orbit. A sharp Rock Fang followed!

To Mo Fan’s surprise, not only did the Rock Fang fail to penetrate the Huge Rock General’s defense, it even broke into pieces at the impact. Mo Fan immediately felt awkward. He quickly backed away from the Huge Rock General’s head before the creature smashed him to death.

“That thing’s defense has risen significantly! Even my Rock Fang can’t penetrate it!” Mo Fan jumped to a safe distance and stared at the annoying Huge Rock General.

Mo Fan’s Rock Fangs could still penetrate a Rock Monster’s body, yet they were useless against the stronger, larger Rock General. Mo Fan clenched his teeth when he saw the Rock General charging at him like a tank again. He decided to have a showdown with the Elemental creature!

Star Orbits appeared around Mo Fan consecutively. The man who loved to overcome his limits in dangerous situations was focusing his attention now.

Either the creature was going to knock him flying, or he was going to give the creature a taste of his Intermediate Spell!

Six Star Orbits had appeared. Only one remained!

The Huge Rock General jumped into the air when it was around twenty meters away. It was using its momentum and gravity to maximize the damage of its explosive move...

The students who were hiding in the distance, too afraid to involve themselves in the battle, started screaming. They managed to set up a Rock Barrier between Mo Fan and the Rock General. Mo Fan had no idea whose spell it was, yet the defensive spell was like a mere bubble to the Rock General. It simply smashed the Rock Barrier to pebbles with its shoulder while charging at Mo Fan!

The final Stars of the Earth Element did not let Mo Fan down. He finally completed the Star Pattern. His aura was several times stronger as he stood amid the glowing Star Pattern.

“Ambush of the Rock Shark!”

The ground below him began to loosen up. A ferocious shark made of rock leapt out of the ground just as the Huge Rock General was about to reach him. The Rock Shark had remarkable power, as if it had long accumulated its strength under the ground!

BANG!

The Rock Shark slammed into the Rock General’s body. The sturdiness and penetrative nature of Mo Fan’s Bright Rock were once again on display. The Rock Shark managed to leave a huge hole the size of its head on the Rock General’s stomach. Half the Rock Shark was now currently inside the Rock General’s body.

The massive Rock General fell to the ground and was smashed into pieces. Mo Fan’s Rock Shark dissipated and merged with the ground, too.

“Take that you son of a b**ch!” Mo Fan finally got to vent his frustrations, stepping on and crushing the pieces of rock scattered across the ground.

His spell was a lot different after reaching the Intermediate Level. It was no longer just a little carp, but a ferocious shark! Even though it was still a long way from the Hillock Whale he had encountered, it was enough to take care of this oversized Rock General!

Pieces of rock started rolling down from the pile. Two bodies covered in ashes rolled out of the remains of the Huge Rock General while Mo Fan was still admiring his new Earth Spell.

The two people were still alive, but they were extremely weak. One of them seemed to be conscious, as he was trying to climb out of the pile of rubble.

“It’s Su Jindu and Cao Juan. Great, they are still alive!” Lin Qihui quickly came over.

Mo Fan had the urge to roast Lin Qihui when he saw him.

The man did not bother showing up to lend him a hand when he was fighting the Rock General. However, he had shown up as soon as the battle ended. He had never seen such an unreliable senior. How could Tao Jing not be in trouble when following a leader like him!?

“Where’s the other one?” Mo Fan turned around and asked.

The Rock Monster whose arm had been pierced by Mo Fan’s Rock Fang was still alive. The members of the group were not too weak, but their practical skills seriously hurt his eyes. They only knew to run away with their tails between their legs when they were only up against a Warrior-level Rock Monster!

“It seems to have run away,” Liang Junheng pointed at a mountain.

“Go after it, it should lead us to Tao Jing and the others!” Mo Fan ordered.

“Oh, right!” Liang Junheng and Zhou Donghao quickly chased after the Rock Monster after they realized that.

Tao Jing and the others had disappeared around here, hence it was very likely that they were attacked by the strange mud monsters too.

“Taking over a human body and turning into powerful Rock Monsters. It’s my first time seeing a creature like this,” Mo Fan fell into deep thoughts while staring at Cao Juan and Su Jindu who were rescued.

He had to admit that this kind of creature was rather terrifying, especially its ability to become stronger after ‘eating’ a person!
