Chapter 1557 The Grave I“ve Built For You

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Eerie cries, like a pig being slaughtered, were coming from the underground prison.

“One more time and I’m going to leave you here. It’s just some fractures, do you really have to cry so loudly!?” Mu Bai shouted.

“Do you have any idea how painful it is when your joints break!?” Zhao Manyan howled back.

“Can’t you see I’m already treating them?” Mu Bai retorted.

“What the heck are you putting on me, holy crap, what are you doing, are you planting a flower in my leg!?” Zhao Manyan screamed.

Zhao Manyan’s joints had all been broken. Luckily, Mu Bai had come in time, or they would have broken more of his bones. The pain... Zhao Manyan did not want to experience it again, especially when the fractured bone went into his veins like glass splinters...

“What flower? It’s the Bone Rebuilding Wood! Its roots will grow into your joints and melt the broken pieces! Its roots will then connect with your bones and slowly replace the broken bones. It’s a trick that only some experienced Plant Mages know!” Mu Bai scoffed.

Mu Bai’s third Element was the Plant Element. Even though he was still a rookie when it came to the Plant Element, he was very interested in it. This trick had saved his life once when he was in the wild, thus he was very familiar with it.

However, it was still very painful!

The roots would grow into a person’s flesh and connect with their bones. The treatment was definitely a lot more painful than being bathed in a Healer’s soothing light, yet even more effective than ordinary Healing Spells! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Screw you, are you turning me from a cripple to a human vegetable!?” Zhao Manyan yelled.

“Stand up!” Mu Bai told him coldly.

“How do you expect me to stand up when my legs are broken...” Zhao Manyan tried to stand and realized that he could already feel his legs again through the pain.

He tried walking and jumping. His legs had been healed after enduring the tremendous pain!

“Oh my, that thing can really heal bones! Mu Bai, I didn’t know you could mix stuff other than the aphrodisiac, well done!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

“Keep talking and I wouldn’t mind breaking your bones and reconnecting them again!” Mu Bai hissed.

“Don’t, I’m just kidding, you saved my life. We are brothers from now on!” Zhao Manyan declared.

“Enough with that, where’s the girl? Did you see her?” Mu Bai asked.

“I didn’t see her, but I think they took the young Medusa to the front line. That Saks and Gangma are both subordinates of a commander of the Egyptian army. If I’m not mistaken, the person in charge of the battle tonight must be their superior!” Zhao Manyan said.

Saks and Gangma had both assumed Zhao Manyan was a dead man walking, so they had mentioned some crucial information when they were conversing. Zhao Manyan was able to figure out some useful information from their conversation.

He had no idea who the person was, but he was deeply troubled, since a high general of the Egyptian army was involved. They clearly could not afford to mess around with a person like that!

“Let’s get out of here first, Mo Fan and Heidi are still holding on!” Mu Bai told him.

“Mm! Your Bone Rebuilding Wood is pretty impressive, I feel like I’ve fully recovered!” Zhao Manyan agreed quickly.

—

The two came out of the fortress easily, as there were not any guards around. A lot of loud blasts were occurring outside. Zhao Manyan was stunned when he saw Mo Fan chasing after Saks. He asked in disbelief, “You call that holding on?!”

Mu Bai was also speechless after seeing that. How crazy was Mo Fan, to be chasing after a Super Mage? Couldn’t he leave some dignity for the man?

“Let’s regroup with Heidi first,” Mu Bai said softly.

Mo Fan was a distance away from them. The fight was clearly beyond their level. It was not like they could provide him any assistance!

Zhao Manyan immediately noticed Ferrero when they headed toward Heidi. He was enraged when he saw the man!

“Damn it, I’m not a man if I don’t kill him today!” Zhao Manyan yelled. He ran at Ferrero like a mad bull.

“Zhao Manyan, forget it, let them go...” Heidi spoke up, after seeing Zhao Manyan’s reaction.

Their Mentor Vani was already dead. The rest were left on their own, too. Their enemy was never the European University Institute, it was the people from the army.

Forget it?

Zhao Manyan dashed forward fiercely. How could he forget what the assh*** Ferrero had done to him?

If Ferrero kept quiet, he would not have had to suffer at all!

Besides, if Mu Bai had not arrived in time, those people might even have beat him to death in the cell. Gangma was clearly going to kill him after torturing him!

Ferrero knew his words were going to get Zhao Manyan killed, yet he insisted on spilling the beans!

Could he really forget it?

“What do you want? Our mentor is already dead. What else do you want?” Sofia shouted angrily when she saw Zhao Manyan running at them.

“Move aside, Ferrero must die today! You can try and stop me, but I’m afraid you will die a tragic death too!” Zhao Manyan snarled.

Ferrero let out a hollow laugh when he saw Zhao Manyan running at him. “Who do you think you are? Do you really think you can face me!?”

“Dueling Ground of Death!” Zhao Manyan arrived right before Ferrero. He immediately set up the same perimeter he had used when he was fighting the Violet Ghost of the Black Vatican!

If Zhao Manyan, who treated his life so preciously, was willing to go so far, it meant he was really mad!

Sturdy rocks emerged and surrounded the area, forming a dueling ground. Even Sofia, who was trying to stop Zhao Manyan, was forced outside!

“Killing you is as easy as drinking water, you piece of trash!” Zhao Manyan stood inside the dueling ground. He was already wearing a suit of heavy rock armor!

“How I wish you were dead! Since Gangma didn’t kill you, I’ll do it myself!” Ferrero had totally lost his mind. He yelled and charged at Zhao Manyan too!

Zhao Manyan’s cultivation was not weak, but most of his spells were more suitable for defensive purposes. His way of fighting usually involved letting the enemy attack first. When the enemy was worn out and their energy was depleted, he would then use his limited attacks to defeat the enemy.

However, since he had already established the dueling ground, he had no intention of backing away. He was going to break all of Ferrero’s bones and let him die in agony!

“This is the grave I’ve built for you!” Zhao Manyan raised his hand. A Deathstrike Magic Equipment with a blazing white glow appeared in his grasp!
