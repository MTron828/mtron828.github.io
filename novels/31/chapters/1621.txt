“I’m thinking of dying now, what about you?”

“I don’t feel any better than you.”

“We were worried he was in some kind of trouble, but it turns out that he’s quitting our team of Advanced Mages!”

“Should we take him out before he attempts the breakthrough? If he did break through to the Super Level, we will lose our only chance...”

“Mo Fan, you’re a madman!”

The street lamps extended the shadows of the two depressed figures. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were walking along the streets. Mu Bai had totally ruined their pleasant mood from the afternoon.

Hah? Weren’t they supposed to be happy for their friend?

Happy my ass, they had put in so much effort looking for the Totem Beasts while saving countless lives, yet the Heavens had let Mu Bai achieve the Super Level first...

Mo Fan’s cultivation was at least an entire street ahead of Mu Bai’s back in high school, yet the goddamned bottleneck of the Advanced Level had allowed Mu Bai to take the lead. He could not deny Mu Bai’s fortuitous discovery and diligence, but seriously, all five of his Elements had already reached their peak!

Either way, Mo Fan was seriously not happy.. .even if Mu Bai could not defeat him after achieving the Super Level, he would still be displeased.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan continued on their way to the auction, but they were clearly not in the mood anymore.

—

During the auction, Mo Fan was constantly thinking about Mu Bai, ignoring how precious the items that were being auctioned off were. He had initially planned to get himself some reliable defensive Equipment.

“The next item is an artifact from the East. I wonder if anyone here knows its origin... the artifact is called the Horn of the Deer God. An appraiser believes it’s related to an ancient protector creature. It’s definitely valuable in the eyes of a collector. The starting price is thirteen million!” the auctioneer briefly explained for the crowd. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

If an appraiser they found could determine the value of the ancient artifact, the auctioneer would only sell it at a satisfying price, or to some collector to earn a fortune. Since it was difficult to appraise the value of an ancient artifact, most people only collected them as a hobby. Some might have some special uses, raising the price of the artifact tenfold. Therefore, the prices between ancient artifacts with known powers and the artifacts with unknown abilities varied greatly!

The auctioneer obviously had not discovered the abilities of the Horn of the Deer God, as they only had a brief description of it. The starting price was only set at thirteen million because it was an antique that might appeal to rich collectors.

“Are they seriously selling that for almost a billion!?” Zhao Manyan blurted out.

Thirteen million euros was around a billion Chinese yuan, an amount that many Advanced Mages could only earn by risking their lives.

“Fifteen million!” Mo Fan suddenly yelled.

Zhao Manyan was startled. He said, “Are you out of your mind? Why would you buy that thing?”

“Sixteen million!” a man countered.

“Seventeen million!” Mo Fan raised his bid without any hesitation.

The other man did not raise his bid further.

“Seventeen million it is, it seems like this young man here is an impressive collector! I hope the Horn of Deer God will grant you immense luck!” the emcee said.

“Oh my, I know you aren’t in a great mood, but you shouldn’t vent your frustrations by wasting your money. We are bidding in euros, that thing just cost you one point five billion!” Zhao Manyan swore at him.

Mo Fan quickly paid the money to claim the item. The auctioneer would pay the tax on his behalf.

—

“Sir, do you want to take the item now? We can deliver it to your place...”

“I’ll take it now.”

“Sure.”

Mo Fan felt much more at ease after claiming the Horn of the Deer God.

Zhao Manyan came up to him while drinking a bottle of juice, his face depressed. “I know you earned a fortune from the bounty for the Tears of Medusa, but you shouldn’t waste it like that. Why don’t you tell me what the heck this shitty horn is good for?”

“Old Zhao, can’t you tell?” Mo Fan asked seriously.

“Yes I can, you’re an idiot!”

“Are you a pig? I see money as more important than my life, so why would I waste my money on something useless?! This thing, it’s a Totem Artifact!” Mo Fan declared.

Zhao Manyan’s expression immediately livened up. He took the Horn of the Deer God, currently sealed in a glass container, and studied it carefully. “Why do you say it’s a Totem Artifact?”

“Look, there’s a Totem Seal,’ Mo Fan pointed at the lines on the horn.

The lines were not obvious because of the horn’s condition. Some were thick, some were thin. Only people that were familiar with Totem Seals would notice them.

“I...I don’t see it...” Zhao Manyan admitted.

The truth was, Mo Fan had not seen the Totem Seal, either. He only knew it was related to a Totem Beast when Little Loach alerted him!

Little Loach rarely showed any interest in other things, except stuff at the level of the Pharaoh’s Spring and the Totem Artifacts.

Mo Fan bid decisively for the Horn of God Deer when he noticed Little Loach was interested in it.

Mo Fan had immediately taken a closer look at the horn, and discovered that the lines on it did resemble a Totem Seal when looked at from certain angles. He was convinced that it once belonged to a Totem Beast!

The Totem Artifacts were all long lost. Shao Zheng had tried looking for them, yet he only managed to find some hints of them. Mo Fan did not expect to find one of them here in Athens!

It might mean that many Totem Artifacts had actually ended up in foreign countries. Some were being displayed in houses as rare collector’s items, others were circulating in the auctions!

“It really belonged to a Totem Beast? What could it be?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed, choosing to believe in Mo Fan.

If they could track down another Totem Beast, they might have a chance to break the chains of the Advanced Level, too!

Mu Bai had already found his path to the Super Level. The two of them would have to work harder. It did not feel good knowing that Mu Bai had now caught up to them!

“It must be. We’ll look for information about a Totem Beast that resembles a deer... with the Totem Seal, we should be able to find more information about it. Perhaps we can find a Totem Beast like the Moon Moth Phoenix, or something stronger!” Mo Fan conjectured happily.

“HAHAHA, we stumbled across it by luck, despite having no luck when we were actually looking for it!”
