Chapter 3114: The Eye of Scorch Bounty

Translator: EndLessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Of course! You have to trust my professionalism!” Jiang Bingming looked expectant.

He longed to see his innocent and lovely junior looking at him with admiration.

“Okay. I’ll help you to do the screening.” Lingling nodded.

When she noticed Jiang Bingming remained where he was and looked smug, she rolled her eyes. He looked at her as though expecting something. Lingling acted like a sweet, innocent girl and forced a smile on her face.

When Jiang Bingming saw his junior smile so radiantly at him, he was filled with confidence. His posture instantly changed.

Leng Lingling watched him leave before heaving a long sigh.

‘Why do grown men always have a few screws loose in their heads?’ wondered Lingling. ‘Why was he so eager to see me enthusiastic like a three-year-old child asking for candy?’

In the past, Lingling used to just ignore them, so they knew she wasn’t interested. But now, she had to fake a smile and act innocent. Otherwise, they would hold grudges against her, which might not work in her favor.

‘Anyway, Jia_ng Bingming might be heading in the right direction. There are not many plants in the Egyptian desert. Rain could indeed be a clue.’ Lingling curled her short hair with her finger. Her hair slowly slid down along her cheek.

It was a habitual movement whenever she was deep in thought. She did not solely rely on drinking milk tea when she was thinking hard. If she often drank milk tea whenever she was trying to figure something out, it might only add weight to her slender arms and thighs…

‘Can the Pharaoh’s Source truly keep one youthful forever?’ Chen He’s words echoed in her mind. Her eyes lit up.

The snake demon, Apas, was more than two hundred years old. It was truly an old witch.

However, Apas did not look old at all. Instead, Lingling thought that she looked like Apas’ older sister.

‘How did the snake demon maintain the appearance of a sixteen-year-old lady forever?

Lingling was young, so she would still be comparable to Apas for the next few years. But what about after a decade or two later?

Apas would still be the same. It could still act like an innocent young lady. It would call Lingling “old lady” or “aunt” by then!

‘Pharaohs and snake demons are closely related. Medusa’s eternal youth could be related to the Pharaoh’s Source. If that’s the case, perhaps Apa.s can provide me with some clues.’ Lingling connected the dots.

MO Fan had let go of Apas a long time ago. The fight between Apas and its older sisters was not over. Lingling was almost certain that Apas was in Egypt, but she was not sure which temple it was in. She was also not sure if Apas was still fighting with its older sisters or if it had ascended the throne of the mother of Medusa.

‘Who is the traitor who trapped the Forbidden Mazes? So far, I’ve onlv come into contact with one top management figure, Black Elephant King. He doesn’t even say much. How can I tell if he’s colluding with Khufu?’

Lingling realized she had a lot of things to worry about. She curled her hair tightly along her fingers, which left marks on them.

“Okay. You are given three days to manage your activities. After three days, each of you will give me a weathervane report and detailed information about your mission,” said Professor Tong Zhouzheng.

They were not given any clues, so they had to gather information in their own way.

A complete set of information could provide them with a sense of direction. They could then narrow it down to a clear picture. The Hunter Tournament had begun. The rest of the Hunter Masters started to look around.

Unlike the World College Tournament, the Hunter Tournament did not impose any restrictions on any resources. Even if they purchased the Pharaoh’s Source from outside, they would still be considered the winner.

There were no rules for the hunters. As long as the hunters did not hurt anyone or commit any heinous crimes, they would not be condemned regardless of how they completed their tasks.

Lingling bought a bottle of coke and sat by the window. She opened her notebook.

The portable computer was her treasure trove. It contained various hunter programs designed by herself. It also contained all the information in the world, including the distribution of the Egyptian desert plants.

Jiang Bingming had decided to work with her. He must have wanted to show off his outstanding level in front of Professor Tong Zhouzheng before the other seniors did.

There was nothing wrong with his idea. She did not have to make another proposition to find the Pharaoh’s Source.

There must be a direction for everything. She had to take note of all the minor and major signs.

Lingling applied the same theory in most of her predictions.

She observed the most subtle signs to predict the outcome of an event.

When several minor and seemingly unrelated details pointed to the same outcome, there was a high probability that her prediction was right.

The distribution of plants after the rain was a reference indicator. However, it was not enough to find the Pharaoh’s Source.

What Jiang Bingming suggested was in line with what a student could do in the given situation.

Since she was a freshman, she did things expected of a freshman.

Lingling completed the task within ten minutes. She had a program for the task on her computer.

After she keyed in the names of Egyptian desert plants and added rain as the variable factor, she waited for the outcome, which would appear soon.

She completed the task in just ten minutes and had sipped a little of the coke.

T ,in?linp was hored_ She sat lov the window_ Her mind drifted away…

Dang!

Suddenly, a red window popped up on the computer screen. Lingling came back to the present and looked at the result.

“Cold Rain Rose?”

[A type of desert rose that springs up the night after rain in Egypt. The plant grows densely and is sometimes used as food for livestock. Rare Golden Cold Rain Rose could expel the Undead.

The Golden Cold Rain Rose appears in the desert and oasis nearby Hanta Sand City and Gobi Desert. The bounty reward for the Golden Cold Rain Rose is ten thousand pounds per plant.

In the past, there was a bounty on the Golden Cold Rain Rose, which was considered a long-term acquisition bounty. However, the price skyrocketed. It seems like the Golden Cold Rain Rose is a special magical plant that is closely related to the Pharaoh’s Source. The bounty on the Golden Cold Rain Rose is not relevant, what they really want is the exact location of the Pharaoh’s Source.

The bounty reward is to find the ancient Pharaoh’s Eye of Scorch.]

‘I think I have the Eye of Scorch with me. It was a magic artifact that MO Fan took away from Apas’ relic,’ realized Lingling.

MO Fan originally planned to use the Eye of Scorch as an attack magic weapon in Fanxue Mountain. It could wipe out the Ocean Demons within a radius, rot their scales, and weaken their defensive ability.

After MO Fan took the Eye of Scorch home, he realized that it was extremely harmful to the Spirit Moths and Little Moon Moth Phoenix. He had no choice but to seal it in the Clearsky Hunter Agency.

Lingling was always weak in her combat power. So, she brought along many powerful magic weapons with her. The Eye of Scorch was one of them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She did not expect someone to pay a high price for this weapon. This was also the latest bounty post.

The Hunter Tournament was held in Egypt. Many hunters were good at utilizing their resources. Thus, new bounties popped out all over the place. After Lingling finished her task, she browsed through the new bounties.

‘Does this thing have something to do with the Pharaoh’s Source, too? It doesn’t seem so. After all, it is a vessel from the evil temple..’
