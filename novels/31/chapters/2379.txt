Either way, Lu Kun was the primary suspect on Mo Fan’s list.

Lingling frowned when Mo Fan told her about all this. She was struggling to understand what Lu Kun was up to.

If Lu Kun was the red demon… Why would he pass the letter to them?

Or perhaps Lu Kun truly did not know the content of the letter. He was merely following the client’s instructions.

Who exactly was the client? He was hiring Mo Fan and Lingling through Lu Kun, but their job was to take out Lu Kun instead?

The situation was a lot more complicated than they had thought!

“We can’t be sure he’s the red demon, even if he has six fingers. It’s possible he might be suffering from a mutation. There have been cases of discovering harmful chemicals inside certain food products in our country,” Lingling told Mo Fan.

“Mm, so our only hope is your analysis of the red demon’s blood.”

“I’ve already gotten the blood samples. They should belong to the red demon. If we can somehow obtain Lu Kun’s blood samples and compare the two, we should be able to find our answers!” Lingling stated.

“We need Lu Kun’s blood?” Mo Fan rubbed his jaw.

How was he supposed to get Lu Kun’s blood without alerting him?

Lu Kun should not have any idea what was going on, since he did not know the content of the letter. It sounded simple to get a drop of his blood without arousing his curiosity, but it might be difficult, too.

“Why don’t I go take his blood? I’m an expert at it,” Liu Ru smiled.

The Blood Tribe had ways of drinking a human’s blood without them knowing, whether they were taking a nap or when they were overwhelmed by other emotions.

“It won’t do. If Lu Kun is the red demon, he will definitely notice you. The red demon is full of hatred. He might suck your soul dry in return,” Mo Fan shook his head.

Liu Ru could easily take a Mage’s blood by placing them in a stupor, but that would obviously not work on Lu Kun!

“Let’s ask Lu Zhengxin or Lu Qingyao to do it then, since they are so close to Lu Kun,” Liu Ru proposed.

“We’ll have to convince Lu Qingyao and Lu Zhengxin first.”

Lu Zhengxin was willing to help since he had long known of the existence of the mutant races.

He knew there were certain species that could disguise themselves as humans. Besides, he had seen the claw with six digits!

“Sister, I’m telling you, you really have to verify it. If we are wrong, we will feel safer, but if we are right... think about it, a demon has taken over our uncle’s flesh and soul. Who knows what he will do to us once he tears off his disguise?” Lu Zhengxin tried to convince Lu Qingyao.

The truth was, Lu Qingyao was much closer to Lu Kun than Lu Zhengxin was.

Lu Kun did not have any children, but he had great power in the clan. He often chose a few talented children in the clan to train as successors.

Lu Zhantian was one of the children Lu Kun was in favor of, and the other one was Lu Qingyao.

As for Lu Zhengxin, Lu Kun had never bothered to treat him seriously. Lu Zhengxin was nothing but a troublemaker. Lu Kun’s only desire was that Lu Zhengxin stay out of his way.

Therefore, Lu Qingyao was the perfect candidate for the operation. Only she had a chance to obtain Lu Kun’s blood without alerting him.

“But, what am I suppose to do? I can’t just bring a needle and stab uncle in the arm!” Lu Qingyao grumbled.

Lu Qingyao had always been afraid of Lu Kun. She might act arrogantly in front of outsiders, but she had always been obedient to her uncle.

She was afraid of Lu Kun, whether or not he was possessed by some demon!

“You can fawn upon him and say you have a friend who’s a renowned doctor overseas visiting you. You can tell him you are organizing a health checkup for him because you are worried about his health!” Lu Zhengxin was full of ideas.

“Fine, I’ll give it a try.”

The other guests were busy with their jobs. None of them were around in the mansion.

As the supervisor, Lu Kun had sent a few powerful Mages of his clan to keep an eye on the Hunters to prevent them from communicating with one another.

Lu Kun was doing his job perfectly. If Mo Fan had not learned of the red demon’s trait of possessing six fingers, he might have assumed Lu Kun was just a normal person who was focusing on getting his reward from the client as well.

“Uncle!” Lu Qingyao always dressed casually when she was at home.

“Didn’t I ask you and Lu Zhengxin to follow Mo Fan around?” Lu Kun was enjoying a cup of tea in the garden.

A few men in suits sat beside him with documents in their hands. They bowed and left, as they had just gotten their new orders from their boss.

“Lu Zhengxin is with him. They are currently resting in their rooms. They don’t have any plans to go anywhere,” Lu Qingyao said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Oh, come closer,” Lu Kun said.

Lu Qingyao was startled.

“I asked you to come closer,” Lu Kun said in a commanding tone.

Lu Qingyao did not dare to disobey Lu Kun. She walked up to the man.

Lu Kun reached out his hand and turned Lu Qingyao’s chin to the other side. He looked at her face and said, “Does it still hurt?”

“Oh, no, it doesn’t. It was my fault anyway,” Lu Qingyao responded in a panic.

“You are too skinny. Is the food here not to your liking? I’ll ask them to get new chefs,” Lu Kun said indifferently after letting go of Lu Qingyao’s chin.

“Not at all, Chef Pang’s dishes are very delicious,” Lu Qingyao said quickly.

“Mm, that’s good to hear. Do you have anything else to tell me?” Lu Kun put on a pair of glasses to read the document in his hand. His deep eyes rarely had any glow in them. It was difficult to tell what he was thinking.

“Uncle, I have a friend from overseas, he’s a great doctor. I’m worried about you since you have been working so hard lately. I’m thinking of asking him to do a medical checkup for you,” Lu Qingyao said.

Lu Kun placed the document down and took off his glasses. He stared at Lu Qingyao.

Lu Qingyao had the urge to take off in fear.

“What do you mean?” Lu Kun said in a deep voice.

Lu Qingyao started panicking.

“I...I didn’t mean anything… I just thought about what you said, about how we aren’t living up to your expectations.

“I was thinking about it overnight. You are right that you have been paving a path for us all these years, but we are simply taking it for granted. You are managing everything yourself, so I was worried your health might decline after working so hard. My friend happens to be a doctor...

“I...I was just trying to help. I’ll feel at ease if I know uncle is healthy.”

Lu Qingyao’s back was already soaked in sweat by the time she finished her explanation.

She had never thought Lu Kun’s eyes could be so intimidating when he was suspicious!
