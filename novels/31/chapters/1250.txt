Chapter 1251: Just Marry Me if You Want to Thank Me

The new land that Mu Ningxue bought was to the north of Feiniao City. Its terrain was quite unique. It was a spacious flatland close to two long and narrow mountain ranges, slightly higher in altitude than Feiniao City.

The mountain range to the west was Feiyue (Flying Moon) Mountain. The ridge served as a natural barrier that cut the demon creatures off from the Nanling Mountains. Most demon creatures would not bother crossing the mountain to attack humans.

The mountain to the east, facing the ocean, was called Shuangyang (Double Sun) Mountain. It actually consisted of two huge mountains with a valley and a river between them, connected to the Yueyang (Moon Sun) Land. As such, the Yueyang Land was connected to the ocean, too!

If they kept heading north, they would cross the Hangzhou and reach Shanghai, the Magic City.

To the south was Feiniao City, less than ten kilometers away.

Mu Ningxue brought Mo Fan along and flew five thousand meters into the sky, allowing Mo Fan to fully observe the Yueyang Land. Mo Fan was utterly impressed by Mu Ningxue’s foresight. Not only was the land flat and spacious, it also had two mountains that served as natural barriers protecting it. With enough funds, they could develop the place into an extremely safe town and city!

As a matter of fact, resources were the most important to a city, since exploitation and excavation were usually the main reasons why a city existed in the first place. However, both Mu Ningxue and Mu Zhuoyun had placed safety first after going through the Calamity of Bo City. They had to admit that the place was a lot safer than Bo City. As for the resources, the ocean was just a mountain away, the land was quite fertile, and even though the area was not rich in resources, it was still acceptable.

“If it wasn’t because this place isn’t within the safe zone, I bet Lin Junxian would have planned to extend Feiniao City this way!” even a novice like Mo Fan could not help but exclaim.

The land was perfect, but the big problem was the effort needed to cleanse the area. It was very troublesome to build a town without the help of the military.

“Once we cleanse the area, we can set up sentries there on Feiyue Mountain. We will then widen and deepen the river on Shuangyang Mountain, and turn it into a harbor with a waterway out to the ocean. This place will soon surpass Bo City!” Mu Zhuoyun was very satisfied with the place.

Mu Zhuoyun had been waiting for this day after living in dejection for many years. After Bo City went down, the scars from it could only be healed by building a new city. Most importantly, this city would be theirs alone. They no longer had to obey the orders of the Mu Clan, nor did they have to abide by the Mu Clan’s will!

“I’ve talked to Lin Junxian. He said that once we include the land in the safe zone, he’s more than willing to work with us. He will gladly handle the construction and offer us a great price for it. I didn’t know you made friends with such an influential businessman when you were still on training with the national team!” Mu Zhuoyun’s face was brimming with joy. He saw hope the moment he saw the place. Although they had to start from scratch, they no longer had to live in the dark!

Mo Fan was utterly clueless about how to develop a city, but with Mu Zhuoyun’s help, he believed they would not have much trouble building it up, starting from a small town. The man was once the ruler of Bo City. As for whether they could further expand the town into a city, it was none of Mo Fan’s concern. Building a city was not an easy task. Even though it was a lot easier to build a city in the east, it still needed quite some time...

A villa on Daqin Mountain...

Li Qing was sitting on a pair of plump legs while wiggling her hips like a snake. She was grinding against Pan Di’s chest half-reluctantly to arouse the man.

Unfortunately, just when Manager Pan was about to pounce on the sheep like a starving wolf, a faint glow suddenly flickered in the night sky in the distance.

The light was faint yet spectacular in the night. The faint light loomed over an area. The blue-brown surface of the barrier felt slightly mysterious.

“What...what’s that?” Li Qing was stunned. She stared into the distance with a blank face.

“It...it looks like a barrier. How is that possible? How could there be such a huge barrier?” As a professional, Manager Pan immediately recognized the light as the barrier of a city.

Why would a barrier suddenly show up over the empty land? The barrier was comparable to the shieldof Feiniao City. Who could possibly own such a powerful Earth Pistil, and activate that powerful barrier!?

“Isn’t the Yueyang Land there? My Heavens, are they using an Earth Pistil to cleanse the area? Is the military planning to include that area in the safe zone?” Li Qing’s jaw dropped after realizing something.

No power other than the military could possibly perform such a shocking feat!

“It’s not the military, I didn’t receive any notice about it. But I heard Mu Ningxue bought the land recently,” Pan Di said.

“She bought the land, and now there’s a barrier protecting it! Is she trying to use it to establish her clan?”

“The place is unpopulated, so it requires strenuous effort to cleanse it. Even a renowned clan wouldn’t have the funds to do so, so I didn’t bother intervening with the purchase, but...but...how did they find such a huge Earth Pistil? That’s impossible!” Pan Di was dumbfounded.

He had already promised the Li Family that he would not allow Mu Ningxue to establish her clan. He had already received the benefits, but this barrier had taken him completely by surprise!

Once the barrier was established, every demon creature within its area would be marked by its light. Not a single one could escape, not even the insects that were hiding underground...

As such, it would be very easy to cleanse the area. They just needed to eliminate the demon creatures tagged by the barrier, and ask a representative of the military, the local Magic Association, the Hunter Union, and the local government to verify that the place was qualified to be included in the safe zone!

An Earth Pistil was the most effective way to prove the area was safe. The headquarters of the Magic Association would not doubt the safety of a territory cleansed using an Earth Pistil, meaning that Manager Pan could no longer abuse his powers to reject Mu Ningxue’s request to set up a clan there!

Most importantly, many people were well aware of the potential that the Yueyang Land had. Many renowned families and organizations had already set their eyes on it, yet they had no choice but to give up due to the time and money required to cleanse the area.

They all knew how remarkable the place was, and it had now become Mu Ningxue’s private land. The place was significantly better and more spacious than the land that Mu Ningxue had tried to acquire before!

——

Li Qing soon received a call from the Mu Clan.”Yes, I got it. I’ll attend to it right away, please calm down. I’ll investigate it right away.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Li Family was meant to trouble Mu Ningxue, but the people of the Mu Clan had suddenly been told that Mu Ningxue had successfully claimed a private area to establish her clan. They immediately scolded the crap out of Li Qing.

Li Qing clearly was not in the mood to entertain Manager Pan. She left quickly. Her only option was to manipulate the local government into stopping them from granting Mu Ningxue approval...

“Damn it, damn it, that b**ch just ignored me!” Manager Pan’s face immediately darkened when he saw Li Qing leave without saying a single word to him...

The rest of the procedures were no longer Mo Fan’s concern, since he had no clue what to do. He had done everything he could.

Mo Fan was extremely satisfied with the name of their new territory. It was the fruit of the efforts that he and Mu Ningxue had both put in. It would surely make headlines when the public learned they were using an Earth Pistil just to cleanse the area. Even though it was not enough to attract many Mages to join them, it would surely help with their reputation!

Mu Ningxue earning a reputation was clearly something that the Mu Clan least wanted to see. People already knew the Mu Clan had abandoned Mu Ningxue after the World College Tournament, and now, Mu Ningxue had attracted so much attention while trying to set up her own clan. It was nothing but a huge slap to the face of the Mu Clan! It was burning and painful!

—

The Mu Clan soon held a small meeting.

Mu Ningxue’s departure did not affect the Mu Clan’s influence much, but it did result in significant damage to their reputation. She gained lots of support when the people learned that Mu Ningxue was expelled by the Mu Clan prior to the World College Tournament, yet the girl had managed to claim a spot on the national team and had an outstanding performance during the World College Tournament still.

COMMENT

Many Mages that were thinking of joining the Mu Clan were disappointed by what the clan had done to Mu Ningxue. If Mu Ningxue proceeded to establish her own clan, it would bring the Mu Clan into the limelight in a poor way, since whenever they talked about Mu Ningxue’s clan, they would surely doubt the Mu Clan even further!

These doubts were unlikely to result in any losses to the Mu Clan, but many Mages that were still figuring out which renowned clans to join, or the people who were considering the Mu Clan as business partners, would turn to other renowned clans instead!

—

“Mu Ningxue, who left the Mu Clan, has established Fanxue Mountain, ready to challenge the Mu Clan head-on!”

“The big contributor to the World College Tournament, Mu Ningxue, is planning to build a new city. The remarkable light of the protective barrier lights up the entire sky of Feiniao City!”

“Everyone knows how the Mu Clan has treated Mu Ningxue. If they are so cruel to their own people, how would they treat outsiders?”

—

As expected, the barrier immediately attracted the attention of the media. Mu Ningxue had not told the media about her intention to establish Fanxue Mountain and her plan to cleanse the area, but not only did the reporters show up like a nest of bees, people and Mages were discussing it on the internet too!

The job was done in no time. It was a lot simpler with the help of the barrier. Mo Fan finally realized why Shi Qianshou was so crazy about the Earth Pistil. It was true that the person controlling an Earth Pistil would control an entire city!

——

“Thank you, Mo Fan!” Mu Ningxue glanced at the land protected by the barrier. The stunning sky was soothing to look at. The place was brimming with hope now.

“Just marry me if you want to thank me. You do know I’ve liked you since a long time ago,” Mo Fan smiled back.

1He never thought he would be able to give Mu Ningxue a city, even though it was only an empty land for now. It felt great seeing the smile on Mu Ningxue’s face, like when she was looking forward to her bright future when she was still a kid.
