It was late at night, yet the scent of blood lingered in the old residence.

A cry of agony came from the residence. The villager called Gouzi had one of his arms torn off by a living dead. The sound of the bones snapping mixed with the loud cry, a chilling sight.

“Damn it!” Liu Ru glared at Fang Gu, who was standing close to the well, in extreme anger.

Fang Gu was an evil Necromancer! The guy had revived the people of the Sunny Goat Village who were supposed to be dead, and turned them all into living dead!

“Let everyone go, we have always been on good terms! We have not done anything to you, why are you killing us like this?” asked Su Xiaoluo with a trembling voice.

Zhang Xiaohou stood beside her to guarantee her safety. However, the rest of the villagers had been torn apart by the living dead. Their amputated body parts were scattered in pools of blood, covering the entire place!

“On good terms? Not done anything to me? HAHAHA, only a naive little girl like you has no idea what happened... that makes sense, because I was told that you’d gone to Qinling Mountains to pluck some herbs. You are totally clueless about the shameless act that your beloved chief, uncles, and aunties did!” Fang Gu burst out laughing.

The presence of the dead continued to linger in the area, allowing the undead to grow stronger. At the start, Liu Ru could barely protect the villagers, but as the living dead grew stronger and fiercer, Liu Ru, who was overwhelmed by their numbers, was constantly knocked back, too. She had no choice but to watch the villagers get snapped in half and torn apart.

Fang Gu used extremely cruel methods. He asked the living dead to tear the villagers to pieces while they were still alive, just so they would suffer the pain right before their death!

“Ask what your chief did when we came to your village after the water in our Kun Well was running out!” said Fang Gu with a hollow laugh.

Xie Sang wore a twisted expression. He never thought that this bunch of people who had died would come back to avenge themselves. As he saw half of the people from his village killed by the lunatic, he, as the protector of the Kun Well, no longer had the face to meet his ancestors after he passed away!

“Let the others go, I’m the one that chased you all away...” Xie Sang glanced at the bodies scattered across the place, then at the children who were rooted to the ground in fear.

“Let go of the others? What did you do when I asked you to let a few of the children stay? Without the protection of the water, we would simply be torn to pieces by those filthy wild undead... do you understand what I was experiencing when I watched the people around me waiting for their turn to die?” Fang Gu’s face resembled that of a devil, one only those bearing extreme hatred could wear.

In the middle of his speech, two other living dead with appearance of young kids lunged at Zhang Xiaohou, but they were stopped by a rising Rock Barrier.

Fang Gu was not too bothered by it. He continued to speak with a voice full of hate, “Despair, the same thing you’re feeling now! When I had to kill them all one by one as the sun was setting with my own hands, I told myself that I’d let the people of your village suffer the same fate, that feeling of despair while you’re waiting for your death!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Wh...what...you killed the people from your own village?” Su Xiaoluo blurted out in disbelief.

Liu Ru was also astounded after hearing that Fang Gu was the one who killed his own people.

“What else could I do, instead of letting those filthy undead eat them and turn them into piles of bones! I would rather turn them into living dead under my control...it’s the only way I could think of as a Necromancer!” said Fang Gu.

He had killed everyone himself, including his children and wife!

Liu Ru no longer knew how to judge the situation...

Obviously, it was inhumane for the people of Hua Village to reject the people of Sunny Goat Village who had lost the protection of the God of the Well, eventually forcing the chief Fang Gu to turn everyone into living dead before night arrived. Liu Ru could not imagine the terrifying scene of Fang Gu killing his own people!

He killed them, turned them into living dead and waited for his chance to get revenge...

No wonder the people of Hua Village were still attacked by the undead when they were still under the protection of the God of the Well; the undead were actually controlled by Fang Gu, who was a Necromancer!

The ambush during the daytime, it was most likely Fang Gu using some trick so that the undead could also appear during the day...

“I used the remaining supply of water from the Kun Well when refining them into living dead. The old ancestor blessed us in the end. My undead people are able to move in the day thanks to the water from the Kun Well... But unfortunately, some Magicians decided to intervene with our business. Otherwise, there’s no way you would have made it to the Ancient Capital!” added Fang Gu. The grudge and hatred he bore had turned him into a devil. He wanted to vent it all out today by avenging his people, at the cost of the lives of everyone from Hua Village!

Liu Ru came to a realization.

Undead would only appear at night or somewhere where the presence of death was strong enough to shroud the sunlight... but it was very hard for the presence of death to accumulate under the sunlight.

Previously when the ambush took place, there was no sign of the presence of death nearby, and it happened when the sky was still bright. Normally, even a Necromancer was unable to control their undead in the day. It turned out that it was only possible because of the effects of the well water that had protected the people from villages living in the danger zone for generations!

The greatest weakness of a Necromancer was their inability to summon their undead during the day. Otherwise, the Undead Element would be more useful than the Summoning Element... Since Fang Gu had found a way to overcome the weakness, it allowed him to act ruthlessly with his army of undead!

“Su Xiaoluo, and you two outsiders. It’s something to be settled between us and Hua Village. I’ll spare your lives if you don’t try to involve yourself, but if you still try to stop me, I’ll kill you too!” said Fang Gu.

“Humph, you’ve already lost your mind. Otherwise, why would you erase the other villages too?!” retorted Liu Ru coldly.

Liu Ru would not say anything if Fang Gu was only trying to get his revenge, since Hua Village was in the wrong in the first place.

However, not only was this Fang Gu trying to eliminate Hua Village, he had also killed everyone from the other villages! It made clear that this guy had completely lost his mind, yet he was still shameless enough to say that he was only trying to avenge his people!

“I’ve only killed people from Hua Village!” declared Fang Gu.

“It turns out that not only are you insane, you’re a hypocrite too!” cursed Liu Ru.

The news about the other villages being erased had come not long after they had arrived at the Ancient Capital. The people of villages located in the danger zone were under the protection of the God of the Well, thus the undead would not attack them. Who could possibly kill them, apart from a Necromancer like Fang Gu?

“Humph, whatever you say! Since you’re trying to protect them, I’ll bury you together with them!” spat Fang Gu with a vicious look.
