Chapter 2421: Absolute Ward!

Translated by XephiZ

“I… am nothing to you?” Hou Ze had a weird expression after hearing those words. He was both amused and angry. “If I’m nothing, what about you, who were expelled by the Mu Clan? Do you think you are still at the top after losing the Mu Clan’s support?

“Defeating Ge Xiong, who’s good for nothing, doesn’t mean anything!”

Hou Ze had come to convince Mu Ningxue to accept her punishment willingly after revealing the difficulties to her. She might have a chance to come back to the Mu Clan.

However, she was being too arrogant!

“Show me your strongest move. I’ve only said so much because I still see you as my Junior Sister, but I won’t show you any mercy from now on!” Hou Ze declared.

My strongest move?

Mu Ningxue did not think she needed to use her bow against him. She understood the importance of continuing to improve if she wanted to climb to the top.

Every step she took had been difficult, but it was also a type of trial for her. It was tough for her at first, but she was slowly getting used to it.

Every new power she obtained had not come easily. It had also helped her to realize what she was lacking, thus giving her a chance to improve herself more in her upcoming attempts.

It was common to see strong Mages in a renowned clan. However, those who were at the top were mostly grassroots members in the past!

When Mu Ningxue was still in the Mu Clan, she had met a lot of bottlenecks. She often wondered if she was really talented, or if she only grew in power because of the Mu Clan’s support.

Mu Ningxue had visited Tianshan Mountain twice after leaving the Mu Clan, and had finally found her direction. She was able to climb the mountain with her gaze fixed on the prize, as every return was closely related to her changes and hard work!

Only the power she had earned by herself truly belonged to her. It did not matter if the mountain she had to climb was taller than the previous one. The hardship she had faced in the past would only give her more confidence in conquering the next mountain!

It was Mo Fan who had helped her find her own path. He was strong for a reason!

Hou Ze was merely following the path the Mu Clan had planned out for him. He represented Mu Ningxue’s old self, when she was still on the same old path.

The enemy she was facing was what she would have become if the incident had not happened!

It was time to see which version of her was stronger!

“It’s meaningless to compete with other Elements. Let’s settle it with the Ice Element!

“Ice Super Power, Ice Mountain Coral!”

Hou Ze was extremely confident in himself. He did not bother hiding the traits of his Super Power.

A colorful icy swirl appeared above the woods. The temperature nearby dropped rapidly.

Ice crystals began appearing like clusters of crystals on the ground. They were growing and spreading in irregular shapes. The bamboo woods were soon filled with ice corals.

The corals were enormous. Some grew taller than the bamboo trees, just like emerging boulders.

It looked like a spectacular view under the ocean had been relocated onto the mountain. The corals were mixed with the bamboo trees, as if an ocean had combined with the mountain forest.

“Show me your strongest ability!” Hou Ze demanded loudly.

Only by crushing Mu Ningxue’s strongest ability, the one she was most proud of, would teach her how idiotic her actions today were!

She was supposed to offer the Mu Clan a humble apology. That way, she might convince the clan to be more lenient toward her. She should never have forced her way up the mountain and challenged the Mu Clan’s authority!

“Is this your Ice Super Power?” Mu Ningxue resumed her pace forward she had paused after Hou Ze had appeared.

She continued to walk toward the main building. Everything before it was only part of the entrance. It was normal for intruders to force their way through the entrance. It had happened to many renowned clans when arrogant intruders thought they could challenge a clan’s authority.

However, the intruder making it to the main buildings would show how incompetent the faction really was.

Ge Xiong of the Disciplinary Hall had failed to stop Mu Ningxue, thus the clan had sent Hou Ze after her.

Hou Ze was not going to let Mu Ningxue advance any further. He was extremely displeased by Mu Ningxue’s arrogance. Who did she think she was?

Even he had never raised his voice against the Mu Clan. Where did she, someone who was expelled by the clan, find the confidence and arrogance to force her way up the Mu Clan Mountain and challenge him?

“Another step forward, and you won’t have a chance to beg for mercy!” Hou Ze snarled.

“I didn’t come to beg, I came to settle the debt!” Mu Ningxue followed her path with a determined face.

She had sworn to destroy the Mu Clan’s empire after she burst into tears in Venice. The day had arrived earlier than she had expected, but she had no reason to back away now.

“Do you think you stand a chance against my Super Power? Ice Coral Shift!” Hou Ze yelled from where was standing on top of an enormous ice coral.

More ice coral emerged from the ground, while those on the surface began to move around. The destruction they were causing could easily wipe out an entire tribe of demon creatures!

The world of ice corals began to collapse. The path Mu Ningxue was treading was in grave danger too, as the debris of the corals fell from above and cracked the ground. It felt like the mountain was sinking due to a tectonic shift. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Ward: Defiance of the Snow God!”

Mu Ningxue’s eyes glowed like brilliant stars. She continued forward at a steady pace right through the collapsing world of ice coral.

A ring of silver light swept forward, and the apocalyptic sight ahead of her suddenly froze.

It felt like time had frozen at that instant. The spectacular world of ice corals turned completely to dust after that brief pause.

The giant coral mountains, the irregular coral reefs, and the falling debris that was cracking the ground apart had all turned into powder.

How was mere dust and powder going to threaten her life? They would only be lifted into the sky and swept into the distance as the wind blew!

Mu Ningxue had overwhelmed Hou Ze’s Ice Super Power with a single glance, not to mention it was the ability Hou Ze was most proud of!

“A Ward, an Absolute Ward…”

Hou Ze’s pride sank to the bottom of his heart together with the corals that had turned into dust.

An Ice Ward!

Mu Ningxue has a Heaven Seed!

A real Heaven Seed would grant its bearer the power to establish an Absolute Ward. Even the strongest Mage had to obey the rules of the Absolute Ward once inside it.

Absolute Ward: Defile of the Snow God!

The rules of Mu Ningxue’s Absolute Ward were able to restrict every other magic within it!

Whether it was an enemy Domain, a spell, or the special effects of an Element, they would all turn into dust inside Mu Ningxue’s Absolute Ward!

Hou Ze’s Super Power was the ability to expand and strengthen his Ice Magic like a Domain, but even it had to obey the rules of Mu Ningxue’s Absolute Ward.

As a result, everything in its influence had turned into dust!

It was the Absolute Ward of a Heaven Seed!

Mu Ningxue had once only had a Domain because of her Innate Soul Seed. But now, she had mastered the much stronger Absolute Ward.

She now owned a real Heaven Seed!
