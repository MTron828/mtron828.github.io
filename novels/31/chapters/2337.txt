The Advanced Mages were confident that they had not seen anyone suspicious, but Damon insisted on entering the camp. He occasionally glanced at the spot where Mo Fan was hiding.

Mo Fan was almost invisible when stationary while wearing the Dark Noble Mantle. The presence of Shadow Magic was almost no different from the air around him.

The area behind the tent was pitch-black, and the light of the campfire served as a distraction when someone was looking at the area behind the tent.

Mo Fan held his breath.

Damon was approaching slowly, taking one step at a time. Mo Fan did not dare move.

He was not confident that he could kill the Super Light Mage instantly. The unpredictability of the Shadow Element was not going to work against a Super Light Mage, either.

“Sir, an enemy Super Shadow Mage has appeared among the Eagle Horse Skyriders!” a voice came from the distance.

Damon turned around and saw a Wind Mage hovering in the air with a pair of Wind Wings. The Mage had come for him from another camp.

“Mm, I’ll be right there!” Damon stopped searching for the shadow footprints and ran for the Wind Mage.

Mo Fan could feel cold sweat running down his face from the shadow behind the tent.

He was right in the center of the enemy camp. He would have had no chance of leaving this place in one piece even if he had ten Zhao Manyans with him!

Mo Fan was about to sneak deeper into the camp when he felt the Dark Vein throbbing and raising goosebumps!

He immediately halted in his tracks and tried his best to remain still.

Wisps of the shadow magic were circling Mo Fan’s feet like the wind. They would spread instantly with the slightest movement.

A few minutes later, Damon returned from another direction and scanned the area with a sharp gaze.

“Sir, you are being too cautious. I swear to you that no one has been here. I believe the shadow traces you saw were left by Robin’s Dark Shadow Horse a few days ago,” an Advanced Mage explained with a smile.

Damon nodded.

“You should hurry to the outskirts. Those Eagle Horse Skyriders are a pain to deal with. They could easily slaughter every Mage below the Advanced Level!” the Advanced Mage encouraged him.

“Stay alert. The Federation Army has a few strong Mages who are good at hiding their presence. We can’t let them sneak into our main camp,” Damon advised them in return.

“Will do!”

Damon finally left the camp. The campfire was still cracking, but the range of its light was limited because of the rain.

—

Damon had left for real this time.

Mo Fan still had lingering fears. Luckily, the Dark Vein had warned him in time!

As he thought, the Brown Rebels had many powerful Mages. He could not afford to lower his guard!

——

The Dark Noble Mantle’s effects would only last for a limited time. Mo Fan had to keep going.

He could already see the main camp. The tents had solid golden-brown roofs set up between them. He had no idea how the Brown Rebels had constructed them so quickly. The connected tents were like an artistic exhibition hall, standing out in the rain and the woods.

Mo Fan avoided the areas with patrols.

Wu Ku was behind the main camp. The upside-down waterfall that resembled a white dragon was serving as the background for the biggest golden tent. It was not a surprise that the leaders of the Brown Rebels had so much respect for someone from the Black Vatican. The spectacular sight he was responsible for did look like he had been granted extraordinary power by the Heavens.

“If they don’t obey their orders, how different are they from the enemy?” Mo Fan heard a bulky man scold coldly as he was passing by a training area.

As soon as he finished speaking, the ground cracked as sharp objects that looked like elephant tusks emerged from it, stabbing into a few Brown Rebels. Their blood sprayed everywhere.

The Brown Rebels died simultaneously. It took the heavy rain quite some time to wash away their blood.

A man in a silver-white robe walked over and glanced at the pool of blood on the ground before saying helplessly, “Ice Tiger, since when did you have such a bad temper?”

“There’s no point for these cowards to stay alive if they aren’t going to be of any use to me!” the hot-tempered man called Ice Tiger snarled.

The man was wearing a mink coat, and his face had stripes like a jaguar. He was brimming with a wild and savage aura.

“Control yourself. Our leader isn’t going to be happy if you keep killing our men,” the Mage in a silver-white robe said.

“I don’t understand, why didn’t he send me to battle? I can easily kill thousands of enemy soldiers myself!” Ice Tiger grumbled.

“There must be a reason he asked you to stay in the main camp. Now, I must deliver the Fundamental Water Crystals to the Heavenly Sensei. This rain is doing us a huge favor. Many people who used to be timid as these cowards have turned into ferocious tigers because of it! They might not have the strength of ferocious tigers, but a mischief of fearless rats can still cause a plague,” the Mage in a silver-white robe said in delight.

Mo Fan was not far away. His eyes glittered when he heard the Mage was heading toward Wu Ku.

The Mage in the silver-white robe was quite powerful. Mo Fan did not dare get too close.

To his relief, the Mage was traveling on foot, and did not seem to be in a rush.

Mo Fan purposely looked at the general called Ice Tiger as he walked past the training ground. He noticed the general was stomping the dead bodies like a devil lusting for blood!

Even though the Frenzy Liquid had no effect on people with a strong will, it had made cold-blooded people behave recklessly and go to extremes to vent their hatred.

But was the Black Vatican actually interested in politics?

They only knew how to destroy lives! They were interested in death and destruction! Even if the Brown Rebels did defeat the Federation Army and establish their kingdom, it would soon turn into Hell if the Frenzy Liquid continued to fall for more than a dozen days. Its people had already lost their outer nature. They would soon massacre one another like wild beasts!

The cities would be in ruins as the streets were littered with dead bodies. Condors would feed on the corpses while crows filled the sky. Such an event was exactly what the Black Vatican was after!

Mo Fan did not have time to feel for the dead, but he was sympathetic toward the Federation’s fate.

The storm of Sea Monsters was on its way. It did not matter which side was going to rule over the country. What would they have left to stop the Sea Monsters’ invasion?

The shore along China’s east coast was already busy building defenses to prepare themselves for the Sea Monsters’ invasion. In contrast to that, the Federation’s coastline was even longer than China’s. The Sea Monsters would be feeding on its people for free when the time came!

They would lose their dignity and end up as a buffet for the Sea Monsters!F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
