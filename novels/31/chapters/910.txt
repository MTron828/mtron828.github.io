Chapter 912: The Egyptian Team’s Reattempt

Meos was rather annoyed.

She was the vice-captain of the team from Egypt. They initially thought sending Sayed, who was relatively strong on the team, was enough to handle the Chinese team at the Training Hall, buying the others some time to focus on their business. They believed Sayed could handle the challenge by himself.

To their surprise, Sayed ended up losing to the Chinese team at the National Hall. It was humiliating that they could not even secure the stamp from the Chinese team!

Little Flame Belle was lying on Mo Fan’s shoulder. The little creature acted as if it was her first time seeing foreigners. She flew forward and circled around Meos without asking Mo Fan for his permission.

“Who’s trashy pet is this, stop bothering me!” Meos was in a pretty bad mood. She waved her hand and threw a Lightning Strike at Little Flame Belle.

Little Flame Belle was already in the Advancing Period of the Warrior Level. A mere Basic Spell had no chance of landing on her. She leaned sideways and floated away, dodging the Lightning Strikes. She cried out in grievance and returned to Mo Fan’s shoulder.

Mo Fan immediately felt unpleasant!

Damn it, not only did she curse Little Flame Belle, she was actually trying to hurt the harmless little creature. Did she really see herself as an emperor, who could bully whoever she wanted?

“You, yes you, stop looking around, I was referring to you, are you tired of living? How dare you bully my beloved Little Flame Belle!” Mo Fan strode forward without caring about how many people were in the group.

Mo Fan was talking in English. He had to make sure that these foreigners could understand him! He had never seen anyone acting so smugly in a foreign country!

“And who the hell are you?” shot back Meos impatiently, looking disgusted.

“B*tch, you really love putting up a show, don’t you? Do you believe that I can knock you back to your country with a single punch?” Mo Fan was a hot-tempered person too. He could not stand anyone acting so smugly in front of him.

“You? I can turn you into a cripple with a single finger. I suggest you get out of my sight before I change my mind. Such a lousy, uncultured country, I have had enough of it!” cursed Meos.

Mo Fan was filled with anger.

Was this person mentally retarded? She couldn’t even tell she was in the wrong if he didn’t teach her a lesson, and yet she dared to talk down to his country? Why didn’t she take a look at her own face? Did she seriously assume she was a noble queen just because she was wearing a golden tiara on her head?

“Mo Fan, what are you doing here?” Mu Nujiao came and saw Mo Fan yelling at a group of foreigners.

Mu Nujiao initially thought Mo Fan was the one that started the trouble. However, her face turned dark when she spotted a familiar person in the group.

Sayed, the Egyptian hated by everyone on the Chinese team. Why was he here again? He even brought a whole team over!

“What are you doing here? Isn’t the challenge over?” Mu Nujiao asked in an unpleasant voice.

Sayed had an awkward expression, but Meos continued to lift her chin proudly and said, “Every country has three attempts at the challenge. We do admit that Sayed has lost the first attempt, yet we don’t want to miss out on the stamp of a little country.”

“A little country?” Mu Nujiao was infuriated upon hearing her words.

Everyone knew how big China was in terms of size and the strength of their Magicians. Their country was easily better than Egypt, yet what did her little country in a desert have apart from the pyramids to dare challenge them? Were they looking down on their team, or their whole country?

“Jiaojiao, don’t even bother talking to someone like her. We’ll break her leg, so she will learn that she shouldn’t be so smug after experiencing the pain.” Mo Fan had completely lost his temper. He seriously felt like exploding at any second after he met the woman.

“Can someone like you really be a candidate at the Training Hall?” Meos glanced at Mo Fan and completely disagreed with his appearance and demeanor, especially how he kept swearing!

“Yeah, enough with your nonsense, I find you extremely annoying. We should just skip the talk and finish the business with a duel!” declared Mo Fan directly.

“Exactly my wishes, I don’t want to waste even a second here,” said Meos.

Sayed and Shreev glanced at Mo Fan with gloating expressions.

Sayed purposely went up to Meos and reminded his vice-captain, “The strongest on their team must be the Ice Magician I fought against last time. For some reason, her control of the Ice Element was beyond the Intermediate Level, and her Ice Element was very impressive too. Just be careful if you go up against her.”

“Humph, you think I will lose to someone at the Training Hall? Even if someone on their national team is here, I can let them taste pain too!” promised Meos.

“Of course you won’t lose, I was just trying to warn you.”

“Because of how useless you are, we’ve wasted a chance to reattempt a challenge, humph!” snapped Meos.

Sayed fell silent. He did not expect someone as strong as Mu Ningxue to be a member defending the Training Hall.

“I was taking on three people on my own... hehe,” Sayed defended himself.

“So, what about this asshole?” Meos pointed at Mo Fan’s back.

“I don’t know, I didn’t see him before. Don’t worry about him, I know at least he’s not one of the strongest on the team. If the Ice Magician wasn’t there, I could easily crush them all,” Sayed smiled.

“I thought he was someone good on their team, but it turns out that he’s just a random dude,” said Meos disdainfully.

“Even the most talented person on their team is incomparable to you. You have no idea how strong you are...” Sayed seemed to have some affection for Meos. He was fawning over her throughout the conversation.

“Let’s go! Meos, are you really going to fight the duels?” asked their captain Schindler.

Schindler looked very young. His skin was golden-yellow, and his eyebrows were very thick. He was standing at the side smiling while Meos and Mo Fan were quarreling. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mmm, I just don’t want to waste more time here, especially if someone actually repeats the same mistake that Sayed did. How hard could it possibly be when we’re only taking the stamp from the Chinese team!” replied Meos.

“Alright, you’ll be representing us.”

The Egyptian team strutted into the National Hall. For some reason, their faces were displaying pride and disdain, like they were a group of princes and princesses.

The instructor Bai Dongwei immediately noticed the proud imbeciles. Meanwhile, the face of Yue Tangxin, who had mostly recovered from the previous injuries immediately turned pale as soon as she saw Sayed. She had yet to recover from the nightmare of her broken bones puncturing her blood veins!
