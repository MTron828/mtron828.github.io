“I told you to wait for me! See, you almost got yourself killed by coming here alone!” Zhao Manyan had managed to make it in time.

Mo Fan now had the protection of a Sacred Shield. Defended by the powerful Light Element Spell, he was no longer afraid of the vampire’s attack. He quickly drew a Lightning Element Star Pattern.

Since he could not blast the asshole to death with his Fiery Fist, it would not hurt to strike the vampire to death with Lightning. After all, the Lightning Element was somewhat related to the Light Element.

“Qianjun: Thunderbolt: Yaksha!” Mo Fan completed the Star Pattern and pointed his finger at Nie Dong’s head.

A terrifying lightning bolt struck down between the buildings. A brilliant lightning dragon was reflected on the steel glass.

The thunderbolt split into several forks halfway, which looked like a claw.

Nie Dong had a fairly quick reaction, but the lightning had a wide area of effect. As it landed on the vampire, his body began to tremble, tiny sparks flickering on it.

Nie Dong felt like his bones had loosened after he was hit by the lightning. If it weren’t for the outstanding strength of a vampire, the force of the lightning would have been powerful enough to disintegrate him!

“Mo Fan, keep using lightning,” said Zhao Manyan, not far away.

In the meantime, a blue Star Pattern appeared under Zhao Manyan’s feet. The water in the air rapidly gathered in his direction while he was drawing the Star Pattern.

“Rolling Wave: Raging Tide!”

Blue water descended from the sky like a river. The fierce current resulted in a tide that almost occupied the entire street.

The rolling wave swept forward and rapidly drowned Nie Dong, who was still recovering from the damage inflicted by the lightning.

The violent tide dragged him more than a hundred meters away. The impact of the wave had a weakening effect. Nie Dong was soaked in the water for a long time as his body was dragged about by the current. It took him some time to overcome the force of the Water Element Spell, but to his surprise, another purple-black thunderbolt landed on his head!

He was drenched in the water, which helped to conduct the electricity. The vampire had trouble rising to his feet for a prolonged period. His eyes were bloodshot, glaring at Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

“How dare you two weak Magicians oppose me!” Nie Dong finally gathered himself and snapped at the two Magicians furiously.

Nie Dong spread his arms and slowly lifted his hands. His claws extended to half a meter long, before they swiped forward in the shape of a cross with great power.

A shockwave with a cross shape swept forward, slashing the streetlight poles on both sides of the road in half. The poles fell, and produced sparkles as the bulbs hit the ground.

“Look after yourself, how could his claws grow so long!?” swore Zhao Manyan.

Mo Fan could not find any shadows nearby. In addition to that, the claws were approaching him swiftly, so he would not be able to dodge it with Fleeing Shadow in time.

Mo Fan activated the Departing Nether Shield without hesitation.

A loud screech was heard as the claws collided with the Departing Nether Shield. Hiding behind the shield, Mo Fan was still knocked more than ten meters back.

As the force completely dissipated, Mo Fan rose his head and saw a deep claw mark covering ten meters of the street in front of him.

On the other hand, Zhao Manyan had used the Light Protection: Sacred Shield to defend himself. However, as he was about to cast the next Spell, Nie Dong appeared behind him from nowhere in an eerie manner!

Only then did Zhao Manyan realize his position was covered in shadows. The vampire had used the Shadow Element to teleport himself for the surprise attack.

His half-meter long claws thrust at Zhao Manyan’s chest mercilessly, as if they were going to tear Zhao Manyan’s organs out instantly.

“Water Barrier!”

Zhao Manyan was actually a Magician without any offensive abilities, so all his defensive Spells always helped him to survive longer in danger.

The Water Barrier easily nullified the vampire’s brute force. The stab from the claws was rendered ineffective. Zhao Manyan made use of the opportunity and one-handedly cast the Light Element Basic Spell.

“Brilliant Light: Blind!”

The burning white glow on his palm exploded in front of the vampire. At such a close distance, most demon beasts would experience great pain from their eyes because of the Spell, not to mention a vampire who was naturally afraid of light. Nie Dong felt like the glow was burning his eyes.

“AHHHH!!” Nie Dong covered his eyes with his hands and cried out in pain.

His fangs extended once again, as he was trying to bite Zhao Manyan in a berserk manner.

He could not see Zhao Manyan, yet he could sense his location. His Water Barrier was gone, the bite would easily take half of Zhao Manyan’s life.

Zhao Manyan did not panic when he saw the vampire was desperately trying to bite him. A golden shield with a pattern of guardian wings appeared in front of Zhao Manyan.

The shield was made of some unknown material, its sturdiness comparable to steel. The vampire’s fangs only left shallow teeth marks on it, inflicting great pain in return.

“I’m going to kill you!” Nie Dong was infuriated after being tricked several times in a row.

He used his brute force to lift Zhao Manyan and the shield up, as if he were going to tear Zhao Manyan into pieces.

To his surprise, Zhao Manyan was fully covered in defensive equipment. As a safety measure, Zhao Manyan had activated his shining golden armor after using the golden shield.

The magic armor was obviously of superior quality, majestic in appearance, making him look like a golden warrior.

Nie Dong had no chance of tearing Zhao Manyan apart when the guy was in the armor, regardless of how strong he was. By the time he remembered that he could slash through the golden armor with the power of his blood, Zhao Manyan had already completed a Light Element Intermediate Spell.

The Light Protection: Sacred Shield rapidly wrapped around Zhao Manyan’s figure. The scythe which the vampire had summoned with his blood immediately dissolved into a pool of blood when it made contact with the Sacred Shield!

One, two, three, four layers of defense, and by the time the fourth layer of defense crumbled, he had finished casting the defensive Spell... Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Nie Dong felt like he was about to go crazy. He had encountered many Intermediate Magicians, yet he had never seen anyone with as many defensive abilities as Zhao Manyan.

If Zhao Manyan were any other offensive-focused Magician, he would have died many times, yet the vampire still had not touched a single strand of his hair!

It was like the encounter between a fierce tiger and a sturdy turtle. The tiger had no clue what to do next!

Nie Dong was extremely furious yet scared of the burn from the Sacred Shield. He immediately tossed Zhao Manyan into the distance. A Magician like him should be thrown as far away as possible!
