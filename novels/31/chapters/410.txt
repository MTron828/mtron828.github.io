“Sister Mu, look, the Demon King is being himself again. He publicly called the students in Fire School trash, and even doubted the Elemental Director, Wei Rong’s teaching method... HAHAHA, there’s always something fun when the Demon King is around!” In the Plant School’s lecture hall, Ai Tutu happily read the news on her phone to Mu Nujiao.

Most people in Pearl Institute’s main campus were well-behaved. Occasionally, there were a few students acting scornfully, but Ai Tutu felt like they were just putting up a show!

Mo Fan was completely different. He would always cause something epic to happen. As expected of the Demon King, he had already stirred such chaos on the first day back. The whole school forum was discussing it!

“The people from the renowned clans always try so hard just to earn some reputation in the main campus. They would go as far as putting up all kinds of shows just to grab everyone’s attention. Meanwhile, this guy who doesn’t belong to any faction always manages to enter the limelight...” Mu Nujiao could not help but giggle.

“Yeah, that’s so true. Last month, that Xiao Jiahe from Xiao Clan did a self-directed and fake demon beast hunting, and the so-called epic duel between the pampered sons of Zhou Clan and Li Clan... They were so weak compared to the Demon King!” Ai Tutu laughed.

“But it seems like he has overdone it this time,” Mu Nujiao could not help but feel worried for Mu Nujiao.

The main campus was different from the Azure Pearl Campus. The latter was only for new students, thus everyone had just graduated from high school. They would at most just barely have achieved the Intermediate Level. Even those with a formidable background would not easily expose themselves.

Here at the main campus, not only was everyone an Intermediate Magician, they would have achieved a certain status in society. To an extent, they would be representing different parties and factions, thus there were people with outstanding talents, formidable backgrounds, and incredible strength here.

The rules for the main campus were rather simple, too. As long as they had yet to achieve the Advanced Level, they could stay at the school to cultivate for as long as they wanted.

In other words, you could easily find all sorts of maniacs below the Advanced Level here at the main campus!

In Mu Nujiao’s case, this was her first year at the main campus. Even with her talents, she was only ranked one hundred and forty-fifth. She could not even get into the top one hundred.

That being said, her results were fairly outstanding among the new students.

Mo Fan comfortably laid down on the couch and ate some fruits after going back to the apartment.

The place did not have much, except for an abundant supply of snacks and fruits, stocked up by both Mu Nujiao and Ai Tutu. Mo Fan was not so fussy about courtesy with his two beloved concubines.

He had only rested for a brief moment when he received a message from Lingling, asking him to pay a visit to the Clearsky Hunter Agency.

Mo Fan finally recalled that he had yet to report for duty to Old Bao after coming back here for quite a long time. The old man would surely know that he had returned to Magic City in one piece.

Mo Fan left his home and hailed a cab. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“When should I sort out the license for the Swift Star Wolf? It’s so inconvenient to hail a cab every time I need to go somewhere... not sure if requesting a license for a Summoned beast would also need to go through a license-plate lottery?” mumbled Mo Fan.

{TL Note: License-plate lottery is a thing in Beijing. People who want to buy a new car have to submit a request to get a license plate. They would then enter a pool, and the winner of the lottery will then be granted the license plate, as a way of implementing road space rationing.}

As he arrived at the Clearsky Hunter Agency, Old Bao looked dispirited as usual, sitting at the bar. Perhaps business was not too good lately. There were no serious jobs, and even the tea he was drinking was no longer the expensive kind.

“Old Bao, I’m back!” greeted Mo Fan with a charming smile.

“Humph, you brat should just die in the wild, so my Clearsky Hunter Agency can recruit a more reliable hunter who never skips his shifts!” replied Old Bao in an unpleasant tone.

“Hehe, please don’t say things like that, I still need to earn some of my living expenses here... By the way, Old Bao, I’ve got some nice material to forge an armor equipment. You’ve got connections, introduce me to a reliable forgemaster, so I can make myself a set of armor. Otherwise, my life will always be in danger,” said Mo Fan.

“An armor set doesn’t come cheap, you sure you have the money?” asked Old Bao while raising his brows.

“I do have some. I just caused little trouble, so it’s going to be somewhat annoying if I don’t have any great equipment.”

Li Man had handled the Xuanwu Giant Lizard’s corpse. She had transferred nineteen million RMB to Mo Fan’s account.

There was neither some rare loot nor a Soul Essence. Mo Fan was quite surprised that the corpse was still worth nineteen million RMB.

Well, a Commander-level creature was definitely not easy to hunt. One could easily lose their life fighting against them!

“I’ll give my old friend a call. You just need to bring the materials and money to Dongfang Oriental Tower. Since you’re back, I do have a pile of requests for you and Lingling to handle,” Old Bao brought out a pile of papers.

“Not a problem!” Mo Fan beat his chest, as if he were trying to say that he was willing to take all the responsibilities.

After receiving the requests, Mo Fan had a weird look.

It was not because the requests were extremely difficult, but seriously, what kind of requests were these?

“Head to the sewage to capture a blood-marked Colossal-eyed Ape Rat, I thought any hunter could easily do that. And this, a newly bought tamed beast has run away, a lost and found request? And what the heck is this, help us to retrieve a protection fee... Old Bao, are you seriously that poor, accepting these questionable requests?” Mo Fan almost dropped his jaw to the ground.

Old Bao coughed. “I was out a few days ago, so I asked my friend to manage the place for a while. Who knew he would accept all this rubbish? For the sake of our Clearsky Hunter Agency’s completion rate, you are our only hope... since you’re the weakest hunter we have,” said Old Bao.

“...these requests only add up to a few tens of thousand at most. Isn’t this just a waste of my time?!” cursed Mo Fan.

With his current strength, he could easily handle a request with a reward of a hundred thousand. There might be too many Intermediate Magicians in Pearl Main Campus, but in the general society, Intermediate Magicians were incredibly rare. Their entrance fee was comparable to that of the celebrities!

“Stop complaining and sort them out. I’ll give you a case with big money when there’s one. By the way, your little money isn’t enough to ask my old friend a favor, since his fees are rather costly,” said Old Bao with an awkward look. As a matter of fact, he also agreed that the quests were questionable. They were a humiliation to his gold-class service.

Doing hard labor when he just came back, and the money was only enough to pay his expensive rent and everyday expenses...

Recalling his recent glorious achievements of beating the Razortail Drake, outsmarting the Xuanwu Giant Lizard, rescuing the Black Totem Snake, chasing the Silver Skyruler, and now he had to find someone’s husband’s paramour, look for a lost dog, and attach advertisements on electric poles... such a humiliation to his dignity!
