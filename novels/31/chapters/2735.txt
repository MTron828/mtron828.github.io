Chapter 2736: You Are Poisonous

Mo Fan shook his sore arm. He did not leave the Purple Light Formation yet. He knew God’s condemnation would continue. Northguard Fortress still wasn’t safe.

Mo Fan continued to attack the sky. Purple punches rose one after another and violently attacked the thick clouds above Northguard Fortress. A large string of extremely bright lightning sparks flickered in the sky. It was the dead of night and yet, the scattered lightning lit up the sky into daylight.

Mo Fan was detonating the lightning elements continuously. Many lightning elements were in the clouds. They were like giant lightning bombs that waited explode at any time. Even if there was a small lightning bolt passing by, it would cause a terrifying explosion in this area!

Mo Fan wanted to detonate all the lightning elements above Northguard Fortress at once. He let them vent their wrath in the sky and the surrounding areas but didn’t allow it to destroy Nothguard Fortress.

He needed to guide the lightning bolts in another direction. Mo Fan attacked the lightning bolts with lightning bolts. It was not to increase the lightning elements but to use up the lightning elements in the surrounding to avoid it from attacking the fortress.

This method was indeed practical. After a while, the clouds above Northguard Fortress thinned. The lightning bolts continued to strike the wasteland hundreds of kilometers away, and the sparks illuminated the sky.

Only Northguard Fortress was spared. There were some lightning bolts in the sky still, but they were ordinary ones which were not very destructive. The people of the Northguard Fortress were relieved.

Suddenly Mo Fan didn’t look like a lone man. It seemed as though he alone could support the entire sky and the Northguard Fortress. He was indeed the strongest man in Northguard Fortress.

The people in Northguard Fortress cheered. They were happy to have survived God’s condemnation. They respected and admired the stranger in Black Dragon Armor. He had saved them. They would have all died if not for him.

“Master Mo Fan, you should take a rest. Leave the rest to us. We are not entirely useless. We can ensure the safety of the fortress from here on out.” Fang Xiong handed Mo Fan some water and a wet towel.

“Alright then. I will leave Raiju here just in case some lightning bolts jump over.”

“Liu He, come here and take Master Mo Fan somewhere where he can rest. You must serve him well and make sure gets to relax.” Fang Xiong said to a female mage.

The female mage approached Mo Fan. She flirted with him and said she was happy to take care of him. However, just then another willowy woman appeared and supported Mo Fan.

......

“I will take care of him, so you don’t need to worry,” said Apas coldly.

Liu He and Fang Xiong looked embarrassed. Fang Xiong glanced at Apas as he had never seen such a beautiful woman anywhere before. He realized that she arrived here along with Mo Fan.

Fang Xiong watched Apas support the tired Mo Fan and walk him away from the scene. Fang Xiong approved. He thought that a hero should indeed have a beauty by his side.

He turned to Liu He. “Well… you can always take care of me.”

Liu He rolled her eyes at him. “Come find me when you become the strongest man in the Northguard Fortress,” she said in disgust.

...

Apas guided Mo Fan to a simple house made up of stones. He lay on the bamboo bed. Apas helped him lie down. She glared at him. She neither offered him water nor comfort. Mo Fan wished Liu he was here instead to take care of him.

“Am I really uglier than her?” Apas sensed Mo Fan’s thoughts. She was angry.

Aps was beautiful. Nobody could beat her in terms of her appearance. She knew so many women seduced Mo Fan and he obliged. But never her. That made Apas unhappy.

‘Mo Fan’s seductress should only be me!’ she thought.

“You’re poisonous,” Mo Fan smiled.

That aggravated Apas. She rushed to him and bit him on his arm. A row of teeth marks with little lipstick stains graced Mo Fan’s forearm. Apas had not used her poisonous teeth.

Mo Fan just laughed. How could he give in? He knew she liked him, but he also knew that she was a snake-woman. Snakes were the most cold-blooded among animals. No matter how much affection they felt for someone, they would still not hesitate to eat them if needed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Women from snake lineage weren’t very loyal to their lovers. In western countries, Medusa was very promiscuous. Men were just tools for reproduction and pleasure. They only loved themselves.

“Ah!” Apas exclaimed and retreated. “Why are you electrifying me?” Apas threw the wet towel she was using to clean him on his face angrily.

“What? I didn’t!” Mo Fan looked at his body. Little purple balls of lightning hovered on his skin where Apas had wiped him with the wet towel. They jumped on his skin, he was unable to control them. “Sh*t! My Lightning Element Star Sea is out of control.”

“Your body is overwrought. If you don’t expand your Star Sea, you are going to explode, and hopefully, drop dead,” said Apas.

“It may also be that the barrier of the second level of Super Level is about to break!” Mo Fan was nervous and excited.

God’s condemnation did not seem entirely useless. When he absorbed its boundless energy, it made a breakthrough in the limit of his Thunder Hole. When his Thunder Hole expanded, his meridians seemed to have opened. His strength increased as more meridians opened.

Mo Fan did not realize that the Thunder Holes in his body had once again opened. Apparently, the number of Thunder Holes connected was the same as the number of his blood vessels. Countless lightning energy was flowing through every part of his body.

Mo Fan looked at his internal body and discovered that the Thunder Holes were everywhere. His body seemed to have changed completely and turned into a human circuit board. With some tweaking, it could turn into a mechanical beast!

The transformation of his supernatural power, Thunder Holes, was breaking through his second-level Star Sea. Mo fan was ecstatic. Allowing the lightning strike him thoroughly hadn’t been for nothing. The sturdy barrier was finally loosening.

Although the loosening of the barrier did not mean that he would advance to the third level immediately, it was certainly a step forward.
