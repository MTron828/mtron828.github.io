“Spider Scorpion Formation!” Blue Bat ordered coldly.

The six monks immediately spread out in a strange formation. They were crawling up on the pipes and chimney flues like spiders and scorpions instead of walking on their feet.

They had all four limbs on the surfaces, and were surprisingly quick when they were crawling. Mo Fan might even have assumed they were spiders and scorpions under their kasayas if he could not see their faces.

These people were like Mages, yet their Auras were different from the usual Auras of Mages. If Mo Fan had to describe them as something, he believed Dark Beast Monsters was the most appropriate.

Dark Beast Monsters disguised as humans!

The six monks spread in different directions around Mo Fan, linked by dark green strings. The strings wove rapidly around Mo Fan as they kept changing positions.

Mo Fan tried to relocate himself too, but the six monks followed him as a group. The strange strings soon surrounded him.

Mo Fan tried burning the strings with his flames, but they were surprisingly tough. He could only destroy the strings by refining his flames.

However, even if he spent some time focusing his flames, he was slower at destroying the strings than the monks were at forming them!

The underground factory was soon filled with strings. It looked like the place was crawling with a few hundred enormous spiders that had entrapped their prey!

“A bunch of monsters,” Mo Fan snarled.

The strings were obviously resistant to Elemental Magic. If Mo Fan did not focus on destroying the strings, he would be assaulted by the six monks!

Mo Fan tried attacking the monks to stop them from constructing the Formation, but they were oddly quick as they maintained a safe distance from him. They were like a bunch of annoying flies Mo Fan was struggling to drive away.

“Scorpion Strike!” Blue Bat ordered, acting as the mastermind behind the six monks.

Mo Fan was completely surrounded by the strings now. Some were as thick as pieces of cloth a few hundred meters long. They dangled above the ground and hung horizontally in front of him, covering up the monks’ movements.

The evil monks were able to crawl on the strings without making a sound, and were a lot quicker when crawling on them. Not only was Mo Fan’s vision hindered by the strings, his movements were restricted. It was like he had gone into the Cave of the Silken Web in Journey to the West!

The evil monks’ arms also bore black gauntlets with segments that resembled the tail of a scorpion!

When the first one swung his arms, a terrifying flicker swept at Mo Fan’s throat. The sharp scorpion tails were not showing him any mercy! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Fan quickly jumped away and split into six shadow sparrows flying in different directions inside the surrounding strings.

He was in a very bad position. Not only was his vision hindered, he was surrounded by his enemies. He could not even tell if his enemies were within ten meters of him.

The scorpion tail struck with another icy flash, hitting a shadow sparrow on the back.

The shadow sparrow puffed and dispersed in a cloud of thick black smoke. It was only a decoy.

The same sound came from other directions, as the remaining shadow sparrows were taken down by the other monks. Their movements were in sync even when they were scattered across the area. It was difficult for Mo Fan to do anything.

Mo Fan had not moved at all. All six shadow sparrows were mere decoys. He was only testing if he could escape from the strange formation with his Shadow Element.

However, judging from how quickly the shadow sparrows had fallen, he knew the evil monks would intercept him before he flew two hundred meters.

The venomous scorpion tails were not the biggest problem. Mo Fan could not even figure out where the evil monks were. These things that looked like Mages were more mysterious than the demon creatures he had encountered. He knew they were nearby, yet his magic was having a hard time locating them.

They would just disappear amid the strings with a single step. It was like a fight between Martial Artists in a workshop of dyes where pieces of cloth were hung up to dry. They would suddenly appear from the cloth behind him and ambush him!

“I wonder if this will work,” Mo Fan closed his eyes and established the Domain of his Earth Element.

Star Dust!

He was making sure his enemies could not ambush him by defending himself with the energy of the Domain, but it was not his true goal.

Mo Fan’s defense was nowhere near as sturdy as Zhao Manyan’s. His Star Dust required a continuous intake of energy to replenish the barrier. It was not very effective if the six evil monks were not attacking him with magic.

“Elemental Accumulation!”

Mo Fan dodged a surprise attack from behind. He quickly gathered his magic around the figure that had attacked him.

Elemental Seal!

It was indeed the same technique Nelson had demonstrated in his class. Nelson might be scum, but his technique was oddly useful in certain situations.

Mo Fan closed his eyes, sensing the density of the Earth Magic around him. He noticed the evil monk backing over a hundred meters away after the attack. It silently crawled up to a pipe above him.

Mo Fan was able to detect a glowing outline of his enemies through the density of his Earth Magic. He could roughly see the evil monk hanging above him.

However, the evil monk that was tagged did not attack Mo Fan right away. It was watching Mo Fan as closely as a spider.

It was waiting for the other five monks to attack Mo Fan so it could deliver the killing blow at the right time!

Mo Fan grinned.

I can see you now. Just wait up there. I’ll deal with you after I’ve tagged your friends too!

Mo Fan had to wait for the evil monks to attack him before he could tag them with his Earth Magic. He did not take out the evil monk above him, since he did not want the rest to notice he was able to see them now!

He would lay low for now by pretending he was unable to attack them back. He was roaming around aimlessly like a blind man in the maze of strings.

Second Seal!

Third Seal!

Fourth Seal, and fifth Seal!

There was only one left. He wondered when it was going to attack him...
