Ai Jiangtu walked up to the Scarlet Soaring Demon and used his hands to tear open the Scarlet Soaring Demon’s stomach.

“Captain, what are you doing? That’s disgusting!” Mu Tingying covered her nose, not allowing the foul odor coming out of the Scarlet Soaring Demon’s stomach to enter her sacred lungs.

The others were confused too. What was Ai Jiangtu thinking, opening up the creature’s stomach? Was there something important inside?

Ai Jiangtu was not acting roughly. He cautiously tore open the monster’s stomach. He slowly reached his hand inside and took out the little creature whose leg was exposed.

Mo Fan was standing right beside Ai Jiangtu. His face exploded with rage when he saw what his captain took out from the Scarlet Soaring Demon’s stomach!

Ai Jiangtu took a deep breath while holding the thing that was covered by gastric juices, fresh blood, and rotten food.

“Captain, what did you... AHHHH!” Mu Tingying was going to ask the captain what he found when she saw the disgusting corpse of the infant that Ai Jiangtu was holding. Her face immediately turned pale as she let out a scream.

Mu Tingying’s scream immediately attracted everyone’s attention. The atmosphere changed when they saw the corpse of an infant in Ai Jiangtu’s hand. Everyone had different expressions. Most of the girls immediately turned their heads around, not daring to look at it further!

It was utterly gruesome and disgusting...

Ai Jiangtu had found the corpse of a child at most two years old inside the Scarlet Soaring Demon’s stomach.

The infant was swallowed alive by the creature. It had happened quite recently, as the corpse was still well-preserved, although the stomach acids had already corroded its skin.

The Magicians could not believe it! Why would the Scarlet Soaring Demon swallow a child alive? Did the creature attack a village recently and eat the child whole?

Ai Jiangtu’s hands were covered in filth. He slowly walked to the sea and washed off the things sticking to the corpse. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The infant had died of suffocation.

If Ai Jiangtu had not discovered the corpse, it would most likely have been digested by the Scarlet Soaring Demon’s gastric acid. The Magicians felt a chill running down their spine when the thought crossed their mind!

“The child was swallowed whole; he was still alive when he reached the creature’s stomach,” said Ai Jiangtu coldly after washing off the corpse.

The infant’s eyes were open, implying that he was still alive when the creature swallowed him.

“Captain, don’t say anymore...” the girls felt the urge to vomit.

“There’s another one here,” said Mo Fan.

The group turned around and saw Mo Fan carrying the corpse of a kid also covered in filth. The kid was around three years old. The corpse had already been partially dissolved, as if it was skinned. The students felt their scalps turning numb after looking at it.

“Hand it over.” Ai Jiangtu passed the washed corpse to Mo Fan and took the corpse that Mo Fan was holding.

Ai Jiangtu carefully washed the corpse, but it had already rotted severely. It did not matter how hard he tried to wash it, it still looked hideous.

“Let’s bury them,” said Mo Fan with a sigh.

Ai Jiangtu nodded.

“I’ll do it, it’s better to purify them first,” said Zhao Manyan.

——

A strong light landed on the rocks along the shore from the sky, shining upon the two small corpses.

Both the corpse that was well-preserved and the one that was severely rotted were disintegrated and purified by the blinding light. Their small bodies turned into ashes in just a few seconds, drifting away on the wind under the golden light...

A sudden breeze swept the ashes away, flying across the Magicians’ faces.

“It seems like they didn’t tell us everything,” said Jiang Yu with a deep voice.

No one would be in a good mood after what had happened.

“Jiang Yu, Mu Tingying, you two will fly back to Feiniao City now and investigate the places that were attacked by demon creatures in the past few days, especially those with kids,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“Aren’t we going to wipe out the creatures? Everything will be fine once we kill them all,” Mu Tingying was displeased.

“Do you really think the five advisors simply left us in a random fishing village?” asked Ai Jiangtu in return.

Mu Tingying opened her mouth trying to refute it, yet she could not find any words.

Ai Jiangtu’s words shed a light among the group. “Are you saying that it’s a trial that the advisors have prepared for us?” asked Gong Yu.

“I am guessing so. Something serious must have happened here, but the authorities couldn’t figure it out. It’s possible that the advisors want us to solve the strange incident here during our training,” ventured Jiang Yu sternly.

“A trial?” asked Nanyu with a frown.

Ai Jiangtu shook his head and said, “It doesn’t matter if it’s a trial or not, we need to seek out the truth. If we found a Magician or a fisherman who ventured out of the safe zone in the creature’s stomach, we can simply bury their corpses, but if the two corpses, or more that we didn’t discover, are kids...” Ai Jiang’s quiet voice held trembles of great anger...

Kids were supposed to be living in the city inside the safe zone. They could not even walk properly, how could they possibly trespass into the demon creatures’ territories and be swallowed alive by the Scarlet Soaring Demons?

They allowed the demon creatures to occupy most of the territory, allowed them to roam freely on the spacious land. They could accept that the safe zone kept shrinking as the demon creatures continued to invade their land, but they would never allow the demon creatures to treat human infants as food and swallow them alive!

The demon creatures had gone out of control, yet the government of Feiniao City did not do anything!

No wonder the economy was failing and the safe zone kept shrinking. The city had completely lost its dignity; it was no different than a poultry cage being raised by the sea monsters!

Ai Jiangtu was nowhere near this angry when he heard about the sea monsters that had prevented the city’s development. However, he now had the urge to fly back to Feiniao City and find the useless prick in charge of the city’s defenses, and make him open his eyes and see the two corpses they had found inside the sea monsters’ stomachs!

“Captain, don’t worry; there’s no truth that I, Jiang Yu can’t find. I’ll be back soon and tell you everything you want to know,” Jiang Yu said firmly.

“Get me the names of the military personnel in Feiniao City,” said Ai Jiangtu grimly.

“Not a problem!”
