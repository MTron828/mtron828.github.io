The monks who were crying out in pain were relieved when they saw someone who seemed to be a Magician had come to save them.

Their eye was poked blind, and their right ears were already torn off. If they lost their hand too, they would die from loss of blood, even if they endured the pain.

“Enough!” Nara Orisora’s hair stood upright in rage, displaying his pale-white, terrifying face.

“Bald prick, I don’t care about your revenge, but hurry up and release my friends’ soul!” snapped Mo Fan, pointing at Nara Orisora.

Ai Jiangtu was startled. He nudged Mo Fan and said, “Aren’t you going to save the monks?”

“I’m not a member of the World Peace Association. Doesn’t Japan has their own exorcists, Ultraman, or Astro Boy to save them? I only care about Mu Ningxue and Zhao Manyan!” said Mu Ningxue honestly.

Were the monks seriously hoping that Mo Fan would save them when they were in the wrong in the first place? He had worn all kinds of red scarves when he was back in his country, and they still expected him to preserve peace here in Japan? What for!?

In simple words, if Nara Orisora was willing to let Zhao Manyan and Mu Ningxue go, he would let the past be forgotten!

“I’ve already refined their souls. Otherwise, where did you think the cursed pattern drawn with blood came from!” Nara Orisora did not show Mo Fan any respect at all. He spilled the beans straight away!

“Asshole, you’ve chosen to drink the forfeit when you could drink the toast instead! Do you really think your grandpa Mo Fan is just a foreign visitor? I’ve killed more than ten thousand demon creatures like you!” Mo Fan was infuriated.

How dare he use the energy of Mu Ningxue and Zhao Manyan’s souls to refine his harmful demon formation! It was likely that he had been using the energy from the kidnapped souls to do his evil deeds!

This Japanese monk was definitely not an honorable monk. Dating someone, kidnapping souls, murdering people, Mo Fan felt he was obliged to enforce justice on behalf of the heavens!

“Ai Jiangtu, stay away, I’m going to kill him!” Mo Fan waved his hand, implying that he was about to have a showdown with the demon spirit.

Ai Jiangtu could not interfere even if he wanted to. He could not even see Nara Orisora.

“Transcending Lightning!” Mo Fan summoned a few lightning bolts as he pointed his finger into the sky.

The lightning descended rapidly from the spacious sky with lightning arcs spreading in all directions. The thickest bolt was the quickest to fall with a blinding flash!

The purple-black lightning’s space-trembling effect rumbled in the area. The rocks on the ground turned into dust and floated in the air.

Nara Orisora was like a phantom. The truth was, he was floating around just like Miyata. His robe barely drifted in the wind, leaving several afterimages behind as he weaved through the gaps between the lightning strikes. When the lightning dissipated, not even the smallest spark had caught him.

“You think you’re so good at dodging? Try dodging this!” Mo Fan pointed at the sky with two hands to summon the Lightning Disaster!

“Try not to hurt the monks!” reminded Ai Jiangtu.

“I’ll leave them in your care. I have to kill the demon spirit first. Otherwise, Zhao Manyan and Mu Ningxue will be in danger if their souls lose too much energy!” snarled Mo Fan, slightly delaying the lightning.

Ai Jiangtu nodded. He raised his hands and quickly moved the monks with illusionary claws formed by his will away from the area Mo Fan was directing his lightning at.

Ai Jiangtu did not have time to worry about the monks. He simply grabbed them and tossed them away.

The plump monk who was in charge of the kitchen was in midair when he saw the enraged Mo Fan summoning a bunch of lightning strikes. The lightning was falling directly to the ground, but it turned into a giant web with lightning arcs spreading in all directions!

Nara Orisora had nowhere to escape to. He stood in the web of lightning, strong electricity conducted back and forth on him and leaving huge holes on his body. However, the holes did not bleed, nor was there any bone inside. The holes were empty and hollow.

In addition to that, the wounds soon recovered and mended slowly. He looked exactly the same as he was before.

It felt like punching the surface of water. Even though it had created a huge ripple, the water would soon return to normal!

Mo Fan was dumbfounded. He had fought against creatures with outstanding recovery ability, yet he had never seen a creature that could recover so quickly. Creatures like demon spirits were very strange indeed!

Nara Orisora did not seem to be in a good mood. He coldly ordered the two red-faced demons who had just torn Qi Hai’s arm off, “Kill him!”

The red-faced demons turned around. Their gray eyes stared right at Mo Fan. One of them even hurled Qi Hai’s bloody arm in Mo Fan’s direction.

The red-faced demons were extremely powerful. Anything they tossed could easily smack a person half-dead. Mo Fan quickly dodged aside. The arm smashed a hole in the rock beside Ai Jiangtu’s feet.

“Can’t you see the two demons?” said Mo Fan to Ai Jiangtu.

Ai Jiangtu shook his head. He could not see anything, apart from the blood splattering across the place and the monks crawling on the ground...

“And you call yourself a Curse Element Magician!” grumbled Mo Fan.

The Demon Spirits were obviously not a kind of undead. It was more suitable to categorize them as Curse Element creatures. Their capabilities, illusions, and formations were related to the Curse Element. Ai Jiangtu was supposed to be familiar with them.

“Take those monks away, I don’t care about their lives, but I wouldn’t want to kill them by accident!” said Mo Fan.

The monks were lying all across the place, preventing Mo Fan from being able to utilize his full strength. Mo Fan immediately ran to the other side when the two red-faced demons approached him, giving Ai Jiangtu a chance to save the monks.

Nara Orisora was unable to stop Ai Jiangtu’s Space Element. Not long after, Ai Jiangtu had moved all the monks out from the Cursed pattern.

As Mo Fan was kiting the red-faced demons, he realized that neither Nara Orisora nor the red-faced demons would leave the cursed pattern. He immediately recalled how Miyata had asked him for names.

It seemed like creatures like demon spirits were unable to harm someone directly. They had to rely on curses or construct a cursed formation with a significant amount of time and effort!

Although the cursed pattern had allowed the demon spirits to inflict damage to him, it also allowed Mo Fan to attack them too. Otherwise, Mo Fan’s spells were totally useless against them!

Nara Orisora had completely revealed his true appearance. His handsome face had turned ghastly like a monster. He had waited a long time to get his revenge today, but the two Magicians had dragged all the monks out of the cursed pattern. His plan to get revenge was now in vain. He immediately directed the hatred that had accumulated over the past few years to Mo Fan!
