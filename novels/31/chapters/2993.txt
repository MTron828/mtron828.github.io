2994 How Are You Doing Down There

Zhao Youqian’s face turned somber.

He did not want to hear his younger brother’s name, especially since he knew that his brother had not perished as expected.

“Mother, take a rest. I’ll come and visit you next time.” Zhao Youqian rose, straightened his suit, and bid farewell to the lady.

“Do you have something else to do again?” asked the lady.

“Yes, I’ve a lot of things to handle. Ever since the trend of the Dragon Mage started in Europe, our family business has been severely affected. The crowd goes to the auctions where dragons are held for sale. They care less and less about us. Our old customers who used to fawn on us go to buy things from our competitors now,” Zhao Youqian said with great dissatisfaction.

“Old customers? They cooperated with us because they respected your father. Now that your father is gone—” said the lady.

“Why do you always talk like that? Why must you always do that? Regardless of our topics of conversation, you always have to mention it. Mother, why can’t you keep yourself in check? How can I chat with you if you continue behaving this way?” said Zhao Youqian impatiently.

The lady was so shocked when she watched Zhao Youqian become furious. Soon, she calmed herself down.

“I can mention them only to you. Don’t you miss them at all? We were a family…” The lady looked slightly disappointed.

Zhao Manqian realized that he had lost his temper and quickly took a few deep breaths to calm himself.

“I didn’t mean that. It’s just that I feel sad whenever you mention them. I don’t want to feel sad. I want to move on with our lives,” Zhao Manqian said softly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Whenever I mention them, you look angry instead of sad.”

“Mother, I wasn’t—”

“Fine. I understand how you feel. I saw a young man who resembled your younger brother, and I inevitably thought of him. Go back and do your work. You must spend a lot of effort on the family’s business.” The lady regained her composure.

“Okay. Rest well. When the weather turns warm and you get better, I’ll take you home,” said Zhao Manqian.

...

Zhao Manqian left in a haste. He panicked. It was as if he was afraid that his mother saw through his true inner thoughts.

Meanwhile, the lady Bai Miaoying fixed her gaze on Zhao Manqian’s silhouette. She did not blink even for a second.

She wondered when her family had reached such a state. Regardless of how beautiful Venice was, it could not sweep away the pathos in her heart.

Bai Miaoying closed her eyes and tried to rest with restlessness and torment in her heart. She waited for time to pass meaninglessly.

It was almost night. The weather was cold. Still, Bai Miaoying refused to go back to the house. She did not want to feel suffocated by the stuffy air inside the house.

Not long ago, she had learnt the news about her family from an old caregiver. The news was the reason Mai Biaoying became seriously ill and was admitted into the hospital.

She could not accept the truth. She could not help but suspect her son.

‘Was it true that Zhao Youqian was the one who did it?’

Thump! Thump! Thump!

She heard footsteps approaching her.

Bai Miaoying ignored the sound. Someone wrapped a warm, wool coat around her and gently placed his hands on her shoulders. Bai Miaoying opened her eyes.

She was greeted by the sight of a handsome and familiar face. He always smiled even when he was serious or angry.

He liked to smile. Bai Miaoying remembered that when he was young, he often gave people a warm smile. He could not stop giggling. The corners of his lips curled upward even when he was engrossed with something around him.

This was also the reason why Bai Miaoying and her husband were so fond of him. It was as if he was born to love his home and everything that his parents gave to him.

“Are you Xiao Manman?” At that moment, Bai Miaoying could not quite believe what she saw upon watching his face.

Her first thought was not that her son had risen from the dead, but that she had fallen asleep in her chair and subconsciously entered a dreamland.

“Ahem, I told you not to call me by that name after I turned eighteen,” the man said, appearing embarrassed.

“As long as I am alive, I will call you that. Xiao Manman, where’s your father? Did he come to visit me with you? How are you doing down there? Did the ghosts mistreat you? Are you well-fed? Do you have enough money to spend? Did you receive the things that I burned for you in Venice during Tomb-Sweeping Day last year? Oh, dear! I forgot that Venice is a foreign country. I guess the Italian ghosts have confiscated the money. Even if they didn’t, the money has to go through the customs of the underworld. They must have withheld a lot of stuff. I’ll return to the country and add more things for you—” Bai Miaoying was so excited that she talked nonstop, as if she wanted to say everything within those few seconds.

“Mother, I’m sorry that I couldn’t bring Dad to visit you.” Zhao Manyan sat on the chair.

“Why? Didn’t you meet each other? You must rely on each other. Don’t go separate ways just because of minor arguments. I know he’s very strict. He always hopes that you can become successful and gain the right to speak in society just like him. But he also told me that your spontaneousness is an admirable quality. People live to enjoy their lives, and it’s counted as a blessing as long as they can live peacefully. If you’re happy and keep that cheerful smile, he won’t force you to join the Chamber of Commerce, an elite in the political arena, or the man among men—” Bai Miaoying truly had a lot to say. She finished everything in a single breath, as if she was afraid that she would not have a chance later.

After Zhao Manyan heard her words, he stopped smiling. Grievance showed up in his eyes.

“Mother, I can’t bring Dad to visit you because I’m not down there. I’m still alive. I’m living a good life. You’re not dreaming. Look at your surroundings. Your dream can’t be so real that even mosquitoes are around to bite you.” He patted Bai Miaoying’s arm.

Bai Miaoying felt a searing pain. Her complexion kept changing. The expressions on her face alternated between shock, joy, and doubt.

“Xiao Manman, Is it really you?” Bai Miaoying could not quite contain her excitement.

“Yes, it’s me. I’ve been wandering outside for a few years. I miss home. Above all, I miss you.” Zhao Manyan smiled. He gave his mother a big hug.
