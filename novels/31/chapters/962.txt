When the three arrived at the White Head Harbor, Mo Fan was just in time to see the team in a deadlock with the army.

It was an utterly ridiculous thing to see. Not only did the army fail to protect the villagers that were going through hell, they were straightening their chests while protecting a bunch of bandits. Mo Fan seriously had no words to describe how ‘friendly’ the local government was!

“What do we do now?” Akira Matsuki asked.

“What can we do? We can only report the matter to the advisors and ask them to give us another mission. This country is beyond redemption,” Shou Watani replied.

“But it took us great effort just to get the intel, such a let-down!”

The members of the three national teams were left with no choice. They could only withdraw from the area since it did not make sense to clash directly with the local government. After all, it was unwise to do anything stupid in someone else’s territory.

“Mo Fan, you’re here?” Nanyu saw Mo Fan, and immediately noticed Jiang Shaoxu was unharmed too. She let out a relieved sigh.

Ai Jiangtu was about to say something when he saw Mo Fan walking toward the heavily protected White Head Harbor with a serious face.

Ai Jiangtu immediately realized something was wrong, but he did not say a word.

“You, don’t come any closer, I won’t show you any mercy!” the captain of the soldiers snapped.

Mo Fan raised his head and looked at the captain that was a lot taller than him.

The tall captain was stunned when he took a clearer look at Mo Fan’s face. He exclaimed, “Why are you here?”

Mo Fan also recognized the tall captain. What a coincidence, it was the same person that he handed the bandits to, the one that gave him the petty rewards!

“I have a question for you; what did you do to the bandits of the Red Ornaments Guild that I caught?” Mo Fan demanded, staring at the man’s face.

“What did I do? It’s none of your business!” the captain said firmly.

“Did you know those assholes went to the outskirts and killed a dozen people? They even trampled the unarmed villagers to the ground like slaves. Did you release them or not?!” Mo Fan asked again.

The captain was startled. Mo Fan could easily tell he was panicking just by looking at his expression.

The captain tried to hold his ground and exclaimed in a loud voice, “So what if I released them? This isn’t somewhere you’re supposed to be! Leave at once, or I’ll arrest you!”

When Mo Fan saw the man talking back arrogantly without showing any empathy to the villagers, he could feel flames bursting from his chest.

“Aren’t you even ashamed to say that!?” Mo Fan’s fist burst into flames, and he threw it at the tall captain.

Mo Fan was now able to cast Intermediate Spells in an instant. It took the captain by surprise. He barely cast a Water Barrier to protect himself, but the Basic Spell was almost non-existent against Mo Fan’s Fire Element!

The fierce and fiery dragon knocked the captain into the air. The scorching flames filled with Mo Fan’s anger quickly burned him to ashes!

The ashes fell down before the soldiers. Everyone, including Mayor Lauren, was dumbfounded. They could not believe the young man had just killed the captain right in front of everyone!

The few remains of the captain were scorched black. The heat was still lingering in the air, with fierce flames burning in Mo Fan’s eyes. His action completely shocked the national teams and the soldiers. The whole place fell deadly silent, and it took them quite a while to collect their thoughts!

“Don’t you f**king think you’re not a jerk just because you’re wearing a uniform!” Mo Fan glared at the scorched corpse. His murderous aura froze the other soldiers in their spots!

Mayor Lauren’s face was twitching in anger!

How bold of him, daring to kill his soldiers right in front of him. Did he have any respect for the laws!?

“You...you dare kill my soldier, I swear I’m going to arrest you!” snapped Lauren furiously. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mo Fan glanced at the mayor and said disdainfully, “I’m going to walk past you and find every single member of the Red Ornaments Guild on that boat. I’m going to kill them all. If any of you want to stop me, just go ahead and try it. A bunch of useless pricks in uniforms. Why don’t you wear some red clothes and ornaments instead, since they suit your identity better!”

“Damn it...damn it, don’t you think you can do whatever you want just because you’re an Advanced Magician. I’m going to behead you here at the White Head Harbor!” Mayor Lauren totally lost his cool.

At his order, the soldiers immediately spread out and surrounded Mo Fan.

There were quite a lot of soldiers around. They stood in lines with magical auras rising from their bodies. The air nearby had gathered under the control of the Wind Element!

Zhao Manyan and Jiang Shaoxu immediately jumped up next to Mo Fan. It was obvious that they were going to take on the useless government together with Mo Fan.

“Idiots, what are your men doing, clashing with the government like that!” Shou Watani cursed.

-Are the members of the Chinese team out of their minds? Don’t they know they are going to be punished if they stirred troubles in someone else’s territory?-

“Tell them to stop, quick!” The Indian team was afraid of stirring up troubles too. It was unwise to challenge the local government’s army!

“What an idiot; something is seriously wrong with Mo Fan’s head!” snapped Zu Jiming furiously.

Could he not drag the whole team down with him if he wanted to die? He had just killed a soldier from the government’s army. Did he seriously not know the word ‘death’!?

Ai Jiangtu and Nanyu exchanged glances with one another. They both walked forward silently and stood between Mo Fan and the soldiers.

They were both soldiers of China. The blood of justice in their bones was stronger than Mo Fan’s. If they could not distinguish who was right and wrong, they had no right to be soldiers!

As Mo Fan had mentioned, instead of saying that the government had recruited the Red Ornaments Guild, it made more sense to say the government had actually joined the Red Ornaments Guild instead!

“So the two of you can’t stand it any longer either?” Jiang Shaoxu smiled when she saw Nanyu and Ai Jiangtu joining the fight.

“We’ll keep the government army at bay, but try to go easy on them too. We don’t want to over-complicate things. Go and take out the Red Ornaments Guild,” Ai Jiangtu advised them.

It did not matter if Mo Fan had killed a soldier, since the man was a serious problem, setting dangerous criminals free like that. It would still be acceptable even if Mo Fan was brought to the International Court of Justice, but if Mo Fan continued to slaughter the government army, things would get really serious.

The fight was inevitable. It was impossible for Mo Fan to withhold his anger. The truth was, they also had the urge to kill all the soldiers when they realized how ridiculous they were.

However, it was necessary to consider the overall situation. Ai Jiangtu was trying his best to send Mo Fan to the Red Ornaments Guild, to prevent him from clashing too much with the government army...

“Alright, thanks!” Mo Fan nodded at Ai Jiangtu and Nanyu.

Mo Fan knew what they were thinking. Even though he was quite unruly with his methods, he did understand it was unwise to cause unnecessary troubles.

“I do agree they are ridiculous,” the Japanese girl in the sailor outfit said.

“Yeah, to think that he would kill the soldier!” Akira Matsuki said.

“I was saying that the government army is being ridiculous. The Red Ornaments Guild must be punished,” the Japanese girl said.

“...” Akira Matsuki was left speechless.

Shou Watani frowned. He immediately realized something was not right when he saw the Chinese team trying to help the three clear a path into the White Head Harbor.

“I can’t stand these idiots either; count me in!” A gentle-looking man from the Japanese team suddenly joined the fight.

“How can you count me out for something like this? HAHAHA, here I come!” A burst of fearless laughter took place among the Indian team, and a mature-looking woman flew across with veils around her and landed in the middle of the fight.

They were all young people. If every team had timid members, they also had members with temperaments like Mo Fan!

The truth was, they already had the urge to force their way in when the government army stopped them. However, they simply held back when they saw the others retreating.

Now that someone had taken the lead, they were more than happy to join the fun!

-Government army my ass, aren’t these assholes ashamed to call themselves soldiers? They thought they were right when they were protecting a bunch of bandits and criminals!-

“We can’t let China take the lead; stay here and keep the soldiers under control, we’ll head to the boat!”

“I have no intention to be involved in this mess... damn it, which asshole tried to attack me with Ice Lock, are you tired of living!?” A Wind Magician of the Japanese team was trying to stay out of trouble. However, he immediately turned into a savage beast and rushed to the front when he was attacked!

As the fight broke out, the members of the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese teams who did not want to be involved were forced to join the fight too, mainly because the government army was clueless about the situation. They assumed everyone was on Mo Fan’s side, and since someone had taken the lead, the others were surely going to cause them trouble!

The national teams were already annoyed by the government army’s smug attitude. Since the soldiers had attacked them first, it was not their fault fighting in self-defense. In the end, only the person taking the lead was fully responsible for what happened. Anyway, it was time to teach these useless soldiers a lesson!

“Night Rakshasa, clear a path for us!” Jiang Shaoxu immediately asked Jiang Yu’s impressive Contracted Beast.

Ahead of them, a petite dark figure moved around swiftly. Each time it landed, a soldier would fall to the ground.

“Seriously, why am I always in trouble when I’m with you!?” Zhao Manyan was maintaining a defensive shield, tanking all the attacks from the soldiers by himself.

Despite complaining, Zhao Manyan continued to follow Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu. For some reason, he was actually quite excited!
