Mo Fan felt rejuvenated as he arrived in Shanghai and inhaled the fresh haze.

A familiar scent; the dust particles floating in the air were like a visible scent or cloud of pollen surrounding him. The men and women in this city had a natural temperament that easily outclassed the people from smaller cities!

Luckily, China’s National Training Hall was located in the Magic City of Shanghai. Mu Ningxue had gone back to the capital to handle some matters. She would be back in Shanghai soon to report to the team, and they could enjoy shameless days together as much as they wanted!

After returning to his nice-smelling apartment, Mo Fan was imagining himself stumbling into Mu Nujiao or Ai Tutu while unlocking the door, his two beloved concubines coming out of their shower, or they would simply be naked in the living room since they knew he was not around.

Unfortunately, the scene that would only happen in novels did not occur. Mo Fan only saw an empty living room as he walked through the door.

Taking a deep breath, neither Ai Tutu’s mature scent nor Mu Nujiao’s elegant fragrance was as strong as Mo Fan had imagined. It seemed like the two girls had not come back for days.

“Where did they go? Why didn’t they come and receive me? I even brought them gifts,” Mo Fan took off his shoes and put them on the shelf, before heading upstairs in a sulk.

He knocked on the girls’ doors, but realized that they were not closed. The rooms were empty, despite some alluring pieces of garments scattered on the beds. Mo Fan immediately felt his blood boiling.

-I didn’t mean it, I didn’t mean it!

-Can such a tiny undergarment cover Mu Nujiao’s entire bottom?-

There were too many things worth investigating. Mo Fan did not check all of them out, since he was not a pervert who had never been to a girl’s room. He did a quick look around, opening up the wardrobe to see if the girls were hiding inside them... Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He pulled the drawers open and was dazzled by the variety of colors. Rose blue, almond red, pink-purple, beige, white... it seemed like the girls were not hiding in the wardrobe. He should look somewhere else, maybe they were hiding under the blankets...

——

A while later, Mo Fan left in satisfaction after confirming that the girls were indeed away.

“I should just buy this unit, a perfect place to raise those two canaries,” Mo Fan laid down on the couch as he was planning his wonderful future.

The doorbell rang as soon as he started enjoying some peace of mind.

Mo Fan was stunned. It was extremely rare to have visitors. If it was the girls, they would have unlocked the door with their keys instead.

Mo Fan looked through the peephole but did not see anyone outside the door. He was utterly confused.

Did he really stumble onto a ghost? The doorbell was still ringing, yet there was no one standing outside!

Who dared to spook the greatest Hunter in the Magic City in bright daylight? Did they really take Mo Fan as a three-year-old kid?

Mo Fan opened the door and saw a short girl with braids on both sides standing there. Her wide eyes glittered, yet they looked a bit too mature for her age. “Ugh... it’s you...” he said as she walked right past him.

“My laptop notified me that you were back,” Lingling took off her shoes and went over to the fridge to get herself a frozen yogurt. She continued after opening it up to enjoy, “The boredom of learning useless stuff in school was killing me after you left. My sister forced me to go to school and study with those retarded middle schoolers. I skipped class today, so I guess I should come and visit you.”

Mo Fan could already imagine how uneasy a highly-intelligent person like Lingling would feel when stuck among idiotic people.

Mo Fan realized that Lingling was rather considerate. She also took out another serving of frozen yogurt for him. Her bored and depressed expression was just asking Mo Fan to down the frozen yogurt with her to kill some time!

“I’m glad that you’re going to school like a normal kid; by the way, are you in the seventh grade?” asked Mo Fan.

“Mm, but I normally go for half a day,” Lingling reached out her tongue and licked the frozen yogurt clean, as if she was not willing to waste any of it. There were some yogurt stains on her cheek, she looked incredibly adorable.

“I was thinking of visiting you too...” Mo Fan recalled the evil Essence Orb.

Mo Fan had brought the Essence Orb back. That annoying Mochizuki Ken simply asked him to find a way to deal with the Essence Orb in China. After all, the orb was not supposed to be harmful as long as it was wrapped inside the silver cloth.

However, if Mochizuki Ken was around, Mo Fan would directly spit a mouthful of carbonated fizz on his face.

Who the heck said that the orb would behave itself? It had already tried to bewitch him when he was fighting the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast!

An orb that tried to bewitch him like a woman. Was that even normal?

Mo Fan was in a rush to come back with Mu Ningxue, too. Otherwise, he would have gone back to Osaka and argued with that old man!

However, Mo Fan decided to bring the orb back, considering it might be the answer that Lingling was seeking for.

However, when he saw Lingling’s tsundere attitude as she complained about her boring life as a middle schooler, he decided it was not time to discuss the orb with the little girl. He should ask Old Bao and Leng Qing for their opinions first. After all, Lingling was still young; if she knew the truth, she might do something stupid.

“Oh, I was going to ask if you have any big jobs on the line. I’m running short on money,” Mo Fan changed his mind. He decided to tell Lingling about the Red Demon some other time.

“I do have some, but it depends on if you have the guts to accept them!” Lingling’s eyes glittered when she heard Mo Fan asking for jobs. Her eyes were like those of a little girl who had heard her brother suggesting they go shopping and to the amusement park after she spent days doing her homework. She was radiating joy and excitement.

“I’m not talking about jobs in the range of millions, but at least ten million and above. I’m really poor now. I have two wives and a daughter to raise... I also have a few Elements to train,” Mo Fan informed her sincerely.

“There’s actually a job with a higher reward than what you’re looking for. I already had my eyes on it for some time. However, a job like this would normally need a whole team. If it’s only the two of us...” said Lingling.

“What if Mu Ningxue comes with us? Her fighting prowess is off the charts. We should be fine if she comes with us, even if it’s a bit riskier,” said Mo Fan.

“I know about her... alright, I’ll make the preparations and see if we can take the job... by the way, you should go rank up, improve your title from an Advanced Hunter to a Hunter Master. You already have enough points,” said Lingling.

“Sure, I’ll go now,” Mo Fan nodded.

It was difficult to accept the higher-level jobs without the Hunter Master title. Many clients would not have time to verify how capable they were, and most of them were unwilling to waste their time on a kid who was not even a Hunter Master.

The higher the title, the higher the level of quests he could accept!
