“Strong, so strong!”

The crowd was left in awe. The Sky Lightning Claws and the Tyrant Call had devastated the stage. The German team that seemed to have the upper hand not long ago had totally lost their domineering aura after enduring the destructive spells. They were all in bad shape, and their magic armor was destroyed, too!

Mo Fan’s spells not only penetrated his target’s defenses, but the number of targets his spells could attack at once was shocking, too!

The woman with moles was knocked out, Reed and Fendy were both injured, and it took them quite some time to barely rise to their feet.

“It seems like the Chinese team has the better destructive Mage. The German team was almost wiped out by his continuous attacks. A weaker team would have been done for by the chain attacks of his lightning spells!”

“Yeah, their defense is completely useless against his Lightning Spells. He basically disqualified a member, left one member in slight injuries, and two in serious injuries...”

“I wonder who the idiot that ranked him fifth among the participants is. Reed has been in the match for quite some time, yet he didn’t really do much. Meanwhile, the Chinese Mage with Double Innate Elements has been completely unstoppable once he joined the match!”

The stadium immediately burst into an uproar. Mo Fan’s destructive Sky Lightning Claws had completely shocked the world. It was fairly easy for them to tell who was stronger. Even though Reed’s Innate Talent was fairly unique, if his spells were unable to pass through the enemy’s defenses, the power of his magic was clearly incomparable to Mo Fan, whether it was based on the damage of the Soul-grade Seeds, the power of the spells, or their control over the Lightning Element.

When Reed attacked Mo Fan with Lightning, the man simply endured it with his body. Meanwhile, Mo Fan’s Sky Lightning Claws almost took out the entire German team!

“Well, well done!” Advisor Feng Li yelled out excitedly.

The middle-aged man who usually had a stern face was currently feeling an adrenaline rush. The performance of his students was better than he had expected, especially Zhao Manyan’s outstanding defense and Jiang Shaoxu’s sudden eruption, both helping the team to overcome the most difficult time.

When Mo Fan finally joined the match, he immediately dealt a serious blow to the opposing team. Mo Fan did not let them down! The German team was on the verge of losing the match after Mo Fan attacked with his Sky Lightning Claws; it made their hearts pound heavily!

“Flying Creek Snow Wolf, Little Flame Belle, take them out!” Mo Fan always went all out in a battle. He was not satisfied with knocking his opponents to the ground. He insisted on stomping on his enemy until they were no longer able to rise to their feet! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The two powerful Summoned Beasts charged forward. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf had his eyes on the substitute of the German team for a fairly simple reason: the student was an Ice Mage!

If the student had done his homework, he would have learned that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was a lot stronger when there was ice around him. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s true strength easily surpassed the Granite Inferior Dragon’s. He was as strong as an average Commander-level creature, so it was much better if the student refrained from using his Ice Magic.

However, if he was unlucky in a way that he did not learn everything that had happened during the treasure hunt. He would soon find himself with a great surprise...

On the other hand, Little Flame Belle had picked the injured Reed as her opponent. She kept spitting out Calamity Fire, and inextinguishable flames soon surrounded the area.

Reed was completely enraged. He had already been crushed by his opponent in the showdown between the two destructive Mages, and now he was being humiliated by a little creature!

Little Flame Belle was incredibly strong. The Contracted Beast was able to hold her ground even though she was going against a Mage with two Soul-grade Seeds like Reed!

Captain Johnson of the German team had a dark expression.

He was utterly regretful that the team had failed to take Mo Fan out when the man first joined the match, which eventually placed the team in such a pinch. A member had been disqualified, while the rest were injured. Most importantly, Mo Fan still had two powerful Summoned Beasts, and even though the two creatures were not strong enough to fight any of the members of the German team in a duel, they could easily keep two of their injured members busy with their Commander-level strength!

Johnson had to admit that the Chinese team’s ace was incredibly strong. The man was able to match the attacking power of an entire team!

“Trying to take me out first?” As Johnson was observing his surroundings, he quickly realized that the members of the Chinese team were surrounding him.

Johnson was in a very bad spot. It was unlikely that his teammates could back him up.

“Imprisoning Space!” Ai Jiangtu used his will to construct a space made up of six faces, trapping Johnson within it. Johnson was trapped before he could cast the Fleeing Shadow.

Johnson knew he had no chance of escaping. He simply stood in the limited space and faced Ai Jiangtu and Jiang Yu directly.

Jiang Yu had finally recovered after being treated by Nanrong Ni. Both Ai Jiangtu and he moved out at once, trying to take an important member of the German team out with the huge advantage that Mo Fan had secured for the team.

The truth was, in Ai Jiangtu’s opinion, the trickiest person to deal with on the German team was not necessarily their defensive Mage, Reed. The man had quite an obvious weakness. He was totally outmatched by Mo Fan’s destructive spells, and the only thing that posed a threat to the team was his Innate Talent. However, with the right approach, the team did not have much trouble against him.

Meanwhile, their captain Johnson had been roaming around the stage like a phantom. The man was actually the main reason that the German team was able to take a few of the Chinese team members out! Most importantly, the captain of the German team did not have a single scratch on him, even though he had been in the battle for a long time. Despite the chaotic and intense battle, he had not been caught by any of the attacks. He even managed to dodge Mo Fan’s Sky Lightning Claws with his outstanding awareness.

As long as Johnson was still in the match, the German team would still be able to take them on. After all, they had basically used all their defensive equipment. If they gave the opposing destructive Mages a chance to cast their spells, they would be eliminated, too!

Johnson was the person that created the opportunities for Reed. If they managed to keep Johnson at bay, it would simply magnify Reed’s weaknesses!

“Captain, this guy is pretty strong. Be careful, he has at least two Soul-grade Seeds,” Jiang Yu said alertedly.

Ai Jiangtu nodded. He did not lower his guard just because he had trapped Johnson with his Space Element. The man could easily break free from his spell at any second!

Jiang Yu and Ai Jiangtu were fairly cautious, yet they still underestimated Johnson’s explosive power. The man was able to take advantage of a mistake that the Night Rakshasa that Jiang Yu had sent into the space committed. He cast a powerful Light Spell to burn the little creature.

The Night Rakshasa was a dark-type creature, thus any Light Spell would inflict multiples of damage to her. The little creature cried out in pain as her black fur was burned away and her skin blistered from the scorching light.

Jiang Yu immediately withdrew the Night Rakshasa into the Contracted Space. His face was filled with pain and anger.

They had been extremely cautious, yet Johnson had still managed to counterattack them. The man was very good at keeping his composure, even though he was struggling to breathe from the enormous pressure applied by Ai Jiangtu’s Space Magic. Despite that, he was still able to keep an eye on the Night Rakshasa and set up the Light trap!

Jiang Yu had lost both his Summoned Beasts, so he had basically lost half his strength. Luckily, he still had the Advanced Summoning Spell and two other Elements to assist Ai Jiangtu.

“He’s running away with the Fleeing Shadow!” Jiang Yu immediately followed the man with his senses when he saw Johnson leaving a shadow behind and running away.

Ai Jiangtu had no intention to let Johnson escape, since he was basically an arrow at the end of its flight. Seeing that Johnson had moved eighty meters into the distance, Ai Jiangtu used Blink and showed up in the path that Johnson was escaping into.

“You’ve lost!” Ai Jiangtu reached out his hand and cast the Demon Torture on Johnson’s shadow.

A huge, ghastly figure sinisterly showed up behind Johnson’s shadow. It grabbed Johnson firmly and proceeded to drag Johnson’s soul out.

During the tournament, if a participant’s soul was drawn out by the Demon Torture, even without inflicting any damage on the participant’s soul, the person would be disqualified from the match. After all, the Demon Torture of the Curse Element was too dangerous, as it could inflict incurable damage on the target’s soul.

The two assistant judges quickly entered the stage upon seeing this.

However, Johnson’s shadow suddenly turned into a puff of black smoke and vanished into thin air.

The two assistant judges that were planning to bring Johnson down the stage stood in their spot with blank faces for quite some time.

Ai Jiangtu immediately had a bad feeling upon seeing this!

He quickly turned around and saw a strange shadow showing up behind Jiang Yu. The silhouette of a human figure gradually became clear.

Johnson was holding a dagger in his hand. He placed it softly on Jiang Yu’s neck and left a little cut on it.

The cut only damaged Jiang Yu’s skin, it did not really hurt Jiang Yu, yet he was already drenched in cold sweat. He turned around in disbelief and saw Johnson’s expressionless face right in front of him!

“You two, bring him down,” Johnson did not do anything excessive. His body soon turned into a black shadow and swiftly disappeared, but his voice was still echoing nearby amid the sand that was blown into the air.

The two assistant judges that had made a mistake reacted quickly. They came up to Jiang Yu and brought him out of the stage.

The outcome had taken everyone by surprise, including the two assistant judges.

They initially went into the stage to take Johnson away, yet not only did Johnson trick Ai Jiangtu and the assistant judges, he was able to take Jiang Yu out after he was left behind!

Johnson’s achievement immediately stirred a great uproar among the supporters of the German team!

As expected of the captain, he was a lot more reliable than Reed, whom they initially had high hopes in because of the rumors!

It was obvious that Johnson was the strongest member of the German team!
