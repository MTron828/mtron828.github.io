Chapter 2899: The Complete Ice Crystal Bow

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

What mattered most now was to increase their strengths.

It was unlikely that they could summon the Azure Dragon again unless they could find another source of Underground Holy Spring.

Unless the Evil Bead Sublimation was replenished, it would be difficult to cast Demon Element magic again.

If the Cold Moon Demon Lord or the Ocean Queen made a comeback, Mo Fan could not contribute much to another war.

Little Loach had transformed into a Little Azure Dragon pendant. The Underground Holy Spring had spilled onto the Ancient Great Walls all over the land. Little Loach was the one that benefited from all of it. It was the one that had summoned the Sacred Totem Beast and unlocked its ancient seal. Little Loach glowed in green luster. The pure energy within itself was as vast as an ocean.

The Nether Ocean within the Little Azure Dragon pendant stirred up tumbling waves. Each wave was capable of improving Mo Fan’s cultivation and helping him break through the barrier.

Mo Fan needed sufficient time to improve the strength of each of his magical elements!

He did not have any special plans. He only wanted to focus on his cultivation.

He had to cultivate in a quiet place. With the help of the divine tool, the Little Azure Dragon pendant, his level of cultivation would reach its peak within a very short period.

Although the Sacred Totem Azure Dragon was in deep slumber, it had left behind tremendous treasure for Mo Fan. After the battle at Huangpu River, the Azure Dragon and Mo Fan had harvested numerous Soul Remnants and Soul Essence.

The Soul Remnant and Soul Essence could help to boost Mo Fan’s cultivation.

It would be an arduous task to ensure the level of cultivation for eight of his elements to reach their peak. But with the massive resources he owned, Mo Fan could do it.

…

Cultivation was boring. There was no shortcut to improve the level of cultivation for the elements.

Even though Mo Fan had gained much popularity and the people across the country had been discussing the totem beasts and the Azure Dragon fervently, he turned a deaf ear to all this and shut himself inside a small courtyard.

Let the world proclaim his legend to their heart’s content!

Mo Fan’s Thunder Element had achieved the highest level of cultivation, followed by his Fire Element, Shadow Element, and Space Element.

The level of cultivation for his Summoning Element, Earth Element, and Chaos Element was slightly lower. But he could slowly digest the massive energy within the Little Azure Dragon. He believed the level of cultivation for all of his magical elements would increase by leaps and bounds after this!

Mo Fan did not go anywhere else. He stayed in Ding City, just like the rest.

Like him, Zhao Manyan reaped significant benefits from the war. He followed Mo Fan and practiced his own cultivation, which was a rare sight.

‘This jerk hardly cultivates. It seems like after experiencing the power and ability, he decided to become an expert too.’

Not long ago, Zhao Manyan had grabbed some assets from the Zhao family. He exchanged the assets for various magical sources. He finally seemed to have realized that nothing was more important than becoming stronger.

…

The weather was icy cold. The breeze felt like a whip on their bodies.

The trees had dried up. A large area of forest nearby Ding City had withered. Many crops had frozen to death. Even the rivers began to freeze.

After half a month of such a climate, they finally began feeling slightly warmer. But the weather did not last long before the cold wind started again. It began to snow. Even though Ding City was an Earth Element capital, it was covered with snow.

It had been a long time since they experienced this drastic change of seasons. They did not experience any warmth. There was only constant bitter cold.

They transported tons of flints out of the dark caves. The flints served as important heating material for the city.

“The Cave Demons are driven to the corner, and they are desperate. They gave their all to fight us to keep the Fire Magic Stones. Luckily, we have sufficient reserves of Mages when we open up the wasteland, otherwise, it would be another tough battle,” said the officers on the transport vehicle.

“But we can’t go on like this. We don’t have any land to plant crops. The city exhausted a lot of the Magic Stones to generate heat. The monsters inside the dark cave will someday lose their minds due to the cold weather. They will come out and simply kill people.”

“The weather along the coast is warmer. I miss Shanghai. The weather over there was much better than here.”

“Word has come from the underground barriers that an expert deployed from the Imperial Capital has killed the head of the Deep-Sea Lizard Demon Dragon. After that, the Lizard Demon Dragon fled into the ocean.”

“Who is that person? He is so powerful!”

“I heard he’s the youngest Forbidden Mage in the country. He has long gained the insights of the independent forbidden curse method. I’m not sure what his name is, but I heard he’s a Fire Element Forbidden Mage.”

“That’s something worth celebrating. The weather over here is too cold. There’s nothing much except the rocks. I hope we can return to the Magic City someday. I would rather fight the Ocean Demons daily than freeze to death here.”

…

At Fanxue Mountain…

Flying Bird Base City and Fanxue Mountain were naturally warmer compared to the mainland since those places were near the sea. The cold air was tempered by the vast Pacific Ocean. The climate was like the usual winter in the south.

Mu Ningxue was draped in a white goose coat. Her hair was as white as snow and fell over the coat’s shoulder braces. She walked in the ancient courtyard like a noble lady from the ancient era. She looked regal.

“Got it. I still need to practice my cultivation for a while longer. After I finish my cultivation, I’ll return to Fanxue Mountain.”

The voice message came from Mo Fan. He was working very hard to practice his cultivation.

He could practice his cultivation at Fanxue Mountain. However, considering that the Flying Bird Base City and Fanxue Mountain were in an eventful period, Mo Fan would most likely be affected by the invasion of the Ocean Demons if he chose to practice his cultivation there. Mu Ningxue also wished he could practice his cultivation somewhere more peaceful so that his level would improve.

“Ningxue, I found the Earth Crystal shattered pieces from the Amazon ruins. We have to pay a fortune if we want to buy it from the top hunters. I suppose you need them, right?” Shao Yu walked to her with a box in her hand.

Mu Ningxue opened the box. When she saw the special crystals that resembled shattered diamonds, she smiled radiantly.

Shao Yu stared at her. Mu Ningxue was truly a natural beauty. When she smiled, her charm attracted even the ladies.

“I suppose this should be enough for me,” said Mu Ningxue to Shao Yu.

“Does this mean you almost completed your Ice Crystal Bow?” Shao Yu asked expectantly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Yes. I have to speed up my cultivation,” Mu Ningxue nodded.

“After you finish practicing your cultivation, I believe not many people in the country will be a match for you.”

“You’re exaggerating.”

“No, I don’t exaggerate my words. I’ve seen you use the Ice Crystal Bow before,” Shao Yu said.
