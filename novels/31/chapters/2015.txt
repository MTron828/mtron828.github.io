Chapter 2016: Tianshan Scar White Tiger

Translated by XephiZ

Luckily, there were two Space Mages on the team. Whenever Ai Jiangtu cast Blink, Mo Fan would follow up and they would quickly increase the distance between them and the aggressive Frosty Ancient Eagles.

The benefit of using Blink was being able to move to a spot where their enemies could not see them in the complicated terrain. The Frosty Ancient Eagles had to rely on their altitude and sharp eyes to search for the band. They had difficulty finding the team after Mo Fan relocated everyone below a hanging glacier with Blink.

“There’s a long icy canyon here. We should be safe,” Guan Yu called back while leading the way.

“The demon creatures in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain are so strong. Are we going to die now that we have split up with the rest of the group?” Zhao Manyan was feeling uneasy.

He believed the team had only stayed safe because other Mages had sacrificed their lives. Otherwise, they would have had no chance of crossing the lake!

“Let’s be more careful. It should be safer in a smaller group,” Nanyu answered.

“We will be fine as long as Nanyu is with us,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

———–

The Frosty Ancient Eagles did indeed lose them after they entered the icy canyon. The eagles kept circling about in the sky, trying to find Mo Fan and his team, but the area was extremely broken-up, with lots of passages, caves, gorges, and mountains.

“They seem to have given up.” Nanyu was listening to the movement of the eagles. She noticed the Frosty Ancient Eagles were drawing away from them.

“Finally! Damn it, this Tianshan Mountain is as terrifying as the Pyramids!” Zhao Manyan sighed.

“Seriously, let’s not choose the Hell difficulty if we are finding somewhere to train ourselves. It took us so much effort to achieve our current level, but it feels like we are back yo being Basic or Intermediate Mages, when we were being chased around by demon creatures!” Guan Yu grumbled.

“Why didn’t I hear you complain when the Night Rakshasa was digging out their valuables?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“...”

“Nanyu, are you sure they have left?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes, but something is strange,” Nanyu answered.

“Is there any chance their nest is under attack, so they have to turn back to defend it?” Zhao Manyan asked quickly.

“No, it feels more like they did not dare to cross the canyon. I noticed them circling around instead of coming after us. If they kept circling in the sky, they would eventually find us unless we remained hidden somewhere,” Nanyu explained.

“Does that mean we’ve accidentally entered a stronger species’ territory?”

“Even the Frosty Ancient Eagles are too scared to come here, I think we should...”

“Shh!” Nanyu suddenly signaled them to keep their voice down with a hand gesture. She whispered, “Something is coming!”

Something was coming!

Something dangerous enough in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain that even the Frosty Ancient Eagles did not dare to approach its territory!

“It’s very close to us!” Nanyu’s expression shifted as she prepared for battle.

The others also realized some powerful demon creature was aware of their existence. They focused and began to utter the chants of their strongest spells silently, making sure they could cast their spells smoothly.

The little cub had no idea how nervous Mo Fan and his team were, and let out a happy cry.

Everyone’s heart skipped a beat when they heard the cry. Crap, the creatures must have known they were hiding here!

As they thought, Mo Fan’s Dark Vein soon flowed on its own, sending chills down Mo Fan’s spine. He slowly looked up and saw a menacing white head with stripes on it!

“A...a white tiger!” Jiang Yu blurted out.

Even the Night Rakshasa’s hair stood on its end when she faced a ruler of Tianshan Mountain, a white tiger! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Is it a Skyridge White Tiger?”

“No, it’s a Tianshan Scar White Tiger, with an even purer lineage!” Apas fixed her eyes on the powerful creature.

This Tianshan Scar White Tiger was amber white. It looked pure and slightly glassy, but it was not crystalline. It was covered in thick fur from its neck to its tail. Its ears were pointy, like the tips of triangular leaves. The imperious stripes on its forehead resembled two crescents.

The most unusual part about the Tianshan White Tiger was its eyebrows.

Its brows were icy white and as thick as a beard. They went down the tiger’s cheeks, giving it the demeanor of a king!

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger climbed down the cliff. It moved down the perfectly straight wall of ice like it was walking nimbly on a normal field.

Its limbs were strong and brimming with power, yet it was completely silent when moving around. This was unlike other Ruler-level creatures, who would shake the ground with every step. However, this made Mo Fan and the team feel even uneasier when facing it.

Even a powerful Sound Mage like Nanyu had not detected its presence. It was too late to figure out a plan now!

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s tremendous aura froze everyone in place as it approached Mo Fan. It was staring at Mo Fan and the little cub in his arms.

The little cub was very excited. It kept waving its paws around.

“Little thing, don’t tell me he’s your father...” Mo Fan said with a stiff face.

“Mo Fan, hurry up and give its child back!” Zhao Manyan said without moving his lips.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger did not attack right away. As a matter of fact, the team might not have been able to react in time if the creature had ambushed them, seeing how it managed to get so close to the team silently.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger was obviously after the little cub. The fearless cub did not reunite with her father, as if she still wanted to play.

“Kid, hurry up and go back to your mother. You’re lucky that you’ve stumbled into us, as we didn’t mind rescuing you from the eagles’ nest. You’re safe now,” Mo Fan told the little cub.

The truth was, Mo Fan was actually telling that to the Tianshan Scar White Tiger. He was hoping that the creature could understand him.

The cub finally jumped down from Mo Fan’s arms. It landed nimbly on the ground and slowly walked toward the Tianshan Scar White Tiger.

“Don’t bother waving us goodbye. Little kid, hurry up and reunite with your parents. We are struggling to stand properly on our trembling legs,” Zhao Manyan muttered, his face twisted.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger was indeed the Totem Beast’s descendant. It did not trouble Mo Fan and his team further, and waited patiently for the little cub to reach it.

“Mo Fan, what is she holding in her mouth?” Lingling asked.

“I don’t know. It’s a stone with a dark glow to it. She keeps holding it like a pacifier,” Mo Fan answered.

The little cub was holding the stone with her mouth at the beginning. However, she kept it inside her mouth after they left the kindergarten, even when she was taking a nap.

“What’s wrong?” Mo Fan was puzzled. Lingling looked a little nervous.

“The thing she’s holding... I believe it’s a Night Amethyst,” Lingling said softly.
