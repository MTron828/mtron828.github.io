The group went into the village and saw the mess on the path, run-down wooden huts, patches of grass scattering across the place, and brown-colored bloodstains...

Obviously, the place was under attack recently, but why was the village completely empty?

“Sigh, I’m so thirsty. Let’s hope the well is clean,” Shorty went over to the well at the middle of the village.

He poked his head out and looked into the well, but all he saw was darkness. As he was figuring out a way to get a drink, a face suddenly came up and stopped right in front of Shorty.

The two faces turned pale instantly, with Shorty falling back to the ground while a loud thud came from the well!

The group turned around and immediately knew that there was someone in the well based on Shorty’s reaction.

As they pulled the man in the well up, the young man who was soaked through let out a relieved sigh when he learned that they were all living humans.

“Are you Hong Jun?” the muscular man quickly stepped forward after he recognized the young man.

“And you are... oh, you’re Youmiao from the other village!” Hong Jun recognized the muscular man.

“What happened here? Why isn’t there anyone else? Do you know where the people of our Sunny Goat Village are?” said Fang Youmiao.

“I don’t know where your people are, but I’ll have to tell the others in the well. They are most likely going to suffocate if they don’t come out soon,” said Hong Jun.

The well was not huge, yet Mo Fan was completely dumbfounded when more than a hundred people climbed out of it. How deep was the well, to be able to contain so many people?

The villagers took turns climbing out from the well and gathered around the place. They did not dare to leave the area.

Finally, when a man and a woman both climbed out from the well, Mo Fan stared at the young man, his eyes wide.

Mo Fan thought the man would walk up to him, yet he was simply standing beside the woman. The man did not even show any reaction when he walked past Mo Fan, as if they were complete strangers.

Mo Fan was stunned for a moment, recovering from the shock. He quickly grabbed Zhang Xiaohou’s arm before he walked any further.

“What...what are you doing?” said Su Xiaoluo, glancing at the outsider that was grabbing onto Zhang Xiaohou.

“You don’t know me?” Mo Fan asked Zhang Xiaohou, surprise all over his face.

Zhang Xiaohou was staring back at Mo Fan too, his face confused.

“You know him?” Su Xiaoluo blurted out with a surge of joy.

Mo Fan opened his mouth. He glanced at Zhang Xiaohou with a blank face, then at the woman, who was reacting weirdly. Could this be the so-called amnesia?

The person was Zhang Xiaohou without a doubt. Even though he was even skinnier than before, but Mo Fan could recognize him just by looking at the hair on his legs.

Mo Fan stared at Zhang Xiaohou, who did not recognize him. Even though the guy had lost his memory, Mo Fan still pulled him into his arms and gave him a huge hug.

“Everything’s fine as long as you’re alive. Everything’s f**king fine!” Mo Fan patted the guy on the back and took a deep breath.

The sunlight pierced through the gray clouds in the sky, shining dimly upon the village.

The rain had stopped, yet the clouds did not clear up, gathering above the Xianchi area as usual. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Fu Da...oh, Zhang Xiaohou, I thought you were going to be a log for the rest of your life. Someone is here to bring you back,” said Su Xiaoluo with a blossoming smile.

“I’m not leaving,” blurted out Zhang Xiaohou, as if he was afraid of losing something.

“Why? Your friend says you’re a soldier. He’s going to bring you back to receive treatment. Maybe they have a way to cure your amnesia?” said Su Xiaoluo.

“I...” Zhang Xiaohou did not understand how to express his thoughts. He simply looked at Su Xiaoluo.

Mo Fan stood aside. He could easily tell that the memory-less Zhang Xiaohou was heavily reliant on the girl.

On second thought, after Mo Fan looked at the scars on Zhang Xiaohou, especially the long cut on the back of his head, he knew that the guy was only lucky enough to survive because Su Xiaoluo had found him.

Hong Jun went up to Zhang Xiaohou and Su Xiaoluo and said to them, “What’s with the leaving and not leaving, we’ve all decided. We should make our way to the Ancient Capital while it’s still daytime...”

“Are we leaving the village?” asked Su Xiaoluo.

“Yeah, the village is no longer safe. We’re all going to die here if we stay any longer,” said Hong Jun.

Hong Jun then pointed in a direction, where Chief Xie Sang was taking the villagers to pack their stuff.

“I agree that you all should leave this place too,” Mo Fan nodded.

“Alright, Zhang Xiaohou, we’ll go together,” Su Xiaoluo wore a smile.

Zhang Xiaohou nodded continuously. It seemed like he had totally turned into Su Xiaoluo’s subordinate. He would simply go wherever she went.

Mo Fan shook his head helplessly when he saw Zhang Xiaohou’s reaction.

I’ve come all the way here looking for you, and here you are picking up chicks!

The villagers failed to come to an agreement. Those who were stubborn insisted on staying. They would rather stay in the well than leave the village.

In their opinion, they would die even faster if they left the village!

Chief Xie Sang had decided to leave, hence he could simply gather those who were willing to leave.

However, the number of people that were willing to leave was less than he had expected. Most people had chosen to stay.

“Look at the village, are you going to stay and wait for your deaths!?” Su Xiaoluo anxiously told the stubborn villagers.

“Yeah, let’s all leave together. You’ll only be killed by the undead. We’re no longer protected,” said the young man called Gouzi.

“We’ve decided,” a middle-aged man simply sat on the ground beside the well.

“The journey to Ancient Capital would take at least two to three days, which means we’ll need to spend at least two nights out in the wild. That’s pretty much suicide,” said a woman.

“Zhang Xiaohou’s friends will escort us to the Ancient Capital. We’ll be safe once we reach the outer walls,” Su Xiaoluo continued to persuade them.

“How could a few kids possibly handle those creatures out there? We won’t be leaving!”

“We’re running out of time. If you guys are leaving, you should go ahead, wasting more time here would make the journey more dangerous...” said an old man.

Su Xiaoluo bit her lips, not knowing what to do.

Those who stayed would surely end up dead. The undead did not even care if they were drinking the water from the well. They had completely ignored the barrier made of Ash Wood. Hiding inside the well was only a temporary solution. It would not protect them forever.

“It’s useless trying to convince them, since they have made their decision. Those who are leaving should gather at the entrance. We’ll leave in ten minutes. Make sure you bring enough Ash Garlic with you!” said Chief Xie Sang decisively.
