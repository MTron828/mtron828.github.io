3013 Strutting Around

Parina’s funeral was held on the same morning.

Izisha attended her funeral. She fixed her razor-sharp gaze on Ye Xinxia, as if looking for Ye Xinxia’s hypocritical smile in the middle of sadness.

But…

‘Why was Parina killed?’ Izisha was confused about her death too.

!!

While everyone in the Parthenon Temple could die, Parina was the only one with the highest possibility of staying alive.

‘Did Parina discover something important that even her special resurrected identity could not save her?!’

Salan had killed her.

The only difference was that Parina’s body was not made into an exquisite jar or turned into cremains. Her body was sent to the Parthenon Mountain foothill in decent condition.

“My lady, what’s going on?” Mera whispered to Izisha.

“Parina discovered something important. Ask the adjudicators to investigate the people she met and places she went to,” said Izisha.

“She’s dead. Most of the clues have been erased,” said Mera.

“If the person is just one of the Red Cardinals, she will have turned Parina into cremains in an urn, just like the urns sent to our hall. However, the person showed some mercy when she killed Parina. It has to be something related to Wen Tai. Her emotions might have left behind some clues. Parina’s body will lead us to the mad person!” said Izisha with great conviction.

“Alright, I’ll inform Milo.”

…

It was noon, and everything went on as usual. However, there were some rumors circulating among the Parthenon Temple.

People began to discuss the past. Some speculated the real cause of Parina’s death. Parina was the Great Sage of the Parthenon Temple, so her death would bring about a certain level of influence.

“I don’t want to take too much time over a dead person. If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to London.” Lady Karolina sat inside the hall and said impatiently to Tata.

Right after she spoke, Ye Xinxia appeared at the entrance of the hall in black, long-sleeved shirt. She looked pale.

Lady Karolina remained in her seat and watched Ye Xinxia.

“My husband is still well-preserved inside the Time Frost. I dislike beating around the bush. If you want to gain the Victorian family’s support, this is my condition. As for the events involving negotiation, sincerity, and friendship. I am sorry, I don’t buy those,” Lady Karolina said bluntly.

“I don’t plan to talk to you about that,” said Ye Xinxia.

“Then, there’s nothing to talk about between us. The honor is yours if you become the goddess.” Lady Karolina stood up and walked out of the hall.

…

Outside the hall, a red dragon landed majestically. It pressed its weight on the stone tiles, as if wanting to crush the expensive tiled floor.

Lady Karolina hopped onto the back of the red dragon. She looked down at Tata, who followed behind.

Lady Karolina smiled. She said to Tata, “Ask the saintess to give it a thought. If she changes her mind, she can come and visit the Victorian manor, and I won’t let the ballot slip out of my hand. Besides, as far as I’m concerned, Izisha also possesses the resurrection ability. She was dismantled into eight pieces and laid inside the Crystal Ice Coffin before miraculously coming back to life.”

“She didn’t master the true resurrection art. You must trust us,” said Tata.

“Actually, I don’t really care about the authenticity of the art. It doesn’t matter to me as long as someone can bring my man back to life… I wish you all the best in the election. See you!” Lady Karolina was in midair as she said the final words.

The red dragon flew in the direction of northwest and gradually away from Athens. Then it left Greece.

It flew past several European countries before heading toward Holy City. It was still early. So, Lady Karolina stayed in the Holy City for a while, as if it was a transit station.

…

Lady Karoline dared not simply reveal her special identity in the Holy City. She let the red dragon land on the plain, then she walked to the First Avenue of the Holy City.

She walked to District 7 on First Avenue. Lady Karolina had her own club in the Holy City. She had made a lot of friends from around the world. They always had a way to satisfy her preference for a drunken night out.

Just when she was about to step into her secret base, she noticed a familiar figure inside an old coffee shop at the corner of the hustle street at District 7.

Lady Karolina walked over to the place, pretending to buy some drinks.

She looked at the person near her and was shocked.

“How did you get away?!” Lady Karolina could not help but cry out while pointing at the man drinking iced coffee.

“Sorry, do I know you?” the man stared at Lady Karolina in confusion.

“Do you think you’re a stranger to the world? You’re the newly promoted Wicked God, Mo Fan! You’re a sinful man!” said Lady Karoline.

Mo Fan took large sips of the iced coffee. He smiled. “You have a good sense of judgment. I’ve been walking around on the streets for some time, yet no one comes to me and questions me like you.”

There was a hint of hostility in Lady Karolina’s gaze. It was clear that she was going to summon the Holy City guardians.

The Wicked God escaped from the Holy Palace and strutted around the streets to enjoy his teatime!

“Running into me is the start of your bad luck!” Lady Karolina’s face changed.

The surroundings immediately turned into an ice cave. The drinks on display were frozen into ice within a second. Her aura was so strong that it suppressed most of the powerful Mages. They had difficulty breathing.

“Who are you?” asked Mo Fan.

Lady Karolina said her name haughtily.

“Such a small world. I didn’t expect to bump into you in the Holy City.” Mo Fan was surprised. He really hadn’t expected to run into the b*tch who had banished Mu Ningxue to the Extreme South Land.

Unfortunately, they were at the Holy City. Otherwise, Mo Fan would have grabbed her hair and smashed her face on the floor.

“How can I help you, Lady Karolina?” Just then, a spirited woman with purple curls walked out with a frozen coffee.

Lady Karolina frowned. She was the Archangel Sharjah!

She disliked people addressing her as Gabriel. So, the people in the Holy City called her by her name.

Many times, Sharjah dressed up like an ordinary, pretty girl. She sometimes liked to pretend to be a tourist. Most pedestrians could not recognize her as easily and would not know that she was one of the rulers of the Holy City. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Thank God that you’re here. The demon—” said Lady Karolina.

“Before the final judgment, he’s just a suspect. Moreover, he surrendered himself to the Holy City. He recited the divine oath, so the Holy City has to protect him,” said Sharjah calmly.

“Still, it’s unbecoming for him to strut around the Holy City like this…” Lady Karoline could not quite accept it.
