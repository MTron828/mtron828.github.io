At the entrance of the village, a pleasant, flowery scent lingered in the air. When Zhao Manyan saw the wild and mature woman called Oni giving him a flirtatious wink, he immediately knew he was about to hit a home run.

After flirting with the woman for so long, Zhao Manyan still did not see a single person nearby. He took another glance at his surroundings before fearlessly moving closer to the woman, sticking his firm chest onto the woman’s soft flesh. He stared her in the eyes before lowering his head to give her a kiss.

Oni wanted to push the man away, but her body immediately softened after the man pushed her into the wall.

It was quite boring to guard the entrance. The woman did not mind enjoying some excitement, since they were only strangers to one another.

Speaking of which, Zhao Manyan was indeed quite experienced at flirting with women. He clearly knew what he was doing. Oni soon found herself enjoying the experience. The experienced woman was fairly surprised.

-Didn’t they always say Asian men were not as good as flirting with women? It seems like this golden-haired Asian man is different from the others...-

Zhao Manyan had almost reached third base when a communication device started beeping unsuitably for the atmosphere.

Oni shuddered. She pushed Zhao Manyan away and said, “It’s urgent, just give me a second.”

“Don’t worry, you can reply to it, and I’ll continue on my own,” Zhao Manyan grinned shamelessly.

Oni did not agree to it. The signal meant that something had happened in the village!

“Oni, ask your men to come up here at once. We’ve got a huge problem,” a man with a panicked voice cried out from the other end.

“What’s going on?” asked Oni grimly.

“We...we are being robbed!” it was like the man was ashamed to say it. However, he was still forced to speak the truth.

“Huh, what did you say!” Oni’s eyes widened.

“Anyway, our enemy is very strong. We need backup at once!” said the man.

The call ended. Oni stood there with a blank face for a few seconds.

Zhao Manyan had heard it all, even though Oni was trying to hide the call from him. He said with a smile when he saw the worried look on the woman’s face, “Seems like there are quite a lot of baddies around here, but don’t worry, as I am here. Come, I’ll go with you, I do want to see what kind of people they are, to dare rob a village in broad daylight!”

“Are you strong?” asked Oni with a side glance.

“I can easily handle a bunch of bandits. We’ll talk later, come, we can’t let the bandits get away,” Zhao Manyan totally displayed his manliness. He activated the imprint in his soul with a thought.

Golden wings immediately appeared on Zhao Manyan’s back. They slowly extended with a metallic rasp. A moment later, the golden feathers formed a pair of wings. The glossy wings reflecting a golden light were incredibly spectacular!

A man’s wings were comparable to a luxury sports car. Oni’s eyes immediately widened!

She never thought the young man was a rich guy. Magical wings were a luxury good to most Magicians!

“Come up here,” Zhao Manyan said with an evil grin.

Zhao Manyan grabbed Oni in his arms before she could react, and soared into the sky.

“How are you going to repay me after I help you deal with the bandits?” Zhao Manyan gave the woman a challenging grin.

“Whatever you want!” It was Oni’s first time flying in the air. She seemed to be in a slight panic. The thrill was stimulating her hormones. If it wasn’t for the urgent situation, she would not mind doing something with the man right now, regardless of where and when.

“Mo Fan, the guards keeping an eye on the path up here are coming. Be careful, they are pretty strong,” Jiang Shaoxu said in a serious voice.

“They are coming to give us more money, don’t worry!” Mo Fan was confident as usual.

Eliminating enemies and protecting people were two different concepts. As long as Mo Fan was stronger than the enemy, he could easily crush them. However, if he was protecting a group of people, he had to be a lot stronger than the enemy to prevent them from doing anything recklessly.

Mo Fan clearly knew he was not strong enough to take on a group of bandits while protecting three hundred villagers. Besides, after what he had gone through in the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, Mo Fan knew how troublesome it would be to protect a bunch of people that were freaking out. Even protecting thirty people would be troublesome, let alone protecting three hundred!

His plan had worked out perfectly, by tricking the bandits into believing that he did not care about the villagers. Otherwise, with so many bandits around, he would not be able to guarantee the safety of every single villager.

“This place has already become our territory. Do you seriously think you can take on all of us!?” cried Xi Ge.

His Contracted Beast was dead. It was the biggest trump card he had up his sleeves. He had the urge to eat the young Magician alive, but there was nothing they could do to him.

Xi Ge was actually trying to drag out the fight. He had to wait until the reinforcements arrived.

“Leader, look above you,” said a bandit.

“I think it’s big sister Oni!”

“Big sis is here!”

The golden wings immediately attracted everyone’s attention. Their female leader landed from the sky, accompanied by a handsome man with golden hair and a proud face.

“Wow, they have quite a lot of people, more than three hundred of them. But don’t worry, judging from their aura, they are just a bunch of plebes,” Zhao Manyan glanced at the villagers dressed in colorful clothes with a disdainful grin.

He had no problem identifying the different groups of people. Those in red outfits and wearing red ornaments were obviously on Oni’s side, implying that they were the villagers. Meanwhile, the three hundred people who obviously looked like the bad guys were standing together. They were simply abusing their numbers to take over the village. Did they seriously think no one is serving justice in their society!

Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu stood still with wide-open eyes. They were looking at Zhao Manyan the same way they would look at a retard.

They were utterly impressed by Zhao Manyan’s lack of intelligence when they were in the lightning storm in Peru. However, it seemed like the water in that idiot’s mind was enough to fill up the Caribbean Sea!

{TL Note: In Chinese slang, when someone describes a person’s brain is filled with water, it means the person is an idiot.}

“Huh, you two are here too. Why didn’t you two enforce justice on behalf of the Heavens and eliminate these bandits? Don’t be scared just because they are winning in numbers!” Zhao Manyan said in a surprised voice when he finally noticed Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu.

Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu seriously did not feel like talking to their retarded teammate.

“You know them?” Oni was startled. She somehow remembered that the two were from the same group of people that passed by the village recently. She had a vague impression of Jiang Shaoxu.

“Yeah, we are buddies, the closest kind, with them here, I don’t even need to do anything. Don’t worry, we will protect the village for you. As for the bandits, we won’t show them any mercy!” Zhao Manyan glared at the three hundred unarmed villagers.

Jiang Shaoxu slapped herself on the head.

Holy cow, did the national team seriously not assess the candidates with some kind of intelligence test? Even if they did not conduct the test, couldn’t they clarify that a mentally retarded person wasn’t allowed to join the team!

“Zhao Manyan, what are you doing? Didn’t I ask you to keep the men along the path busy? Why did you let them pass? I’m going to give you one-tenth of the pay less!” Mo Fan said loudly.

In order to prevent Zhao Manyan from ruining their disguise, Mo Fan immediately blackened Zhao Manyan’s image, too.

“What pay?” Zhao Manyan was confused.

“So that’s how it is, humph, I’m going to kill you!” Oni snapped furiously. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She was wondering why a man would come and flirt with her out of nowhere. It turned out that he was trying to buy some time for his friends and stop her men from providing backup!

Oni was quick with her attack. A strong wind emerged under Zhao Manyan’s feet without any sign. It turned into a tornado in a brief period of time and swept Zhao Manyan into the air.

“F**k me, what are you doing, I’m here to help...” Zhao Manyan was stunned. He quickly cast Rock Barrier and altered its shape to resemble a tongue, blocking the majority of the tornado.

“Stop wasting time, take them out,” Mo Fan knew he could not let the fight drag on further. He immediately took hold of the opportunity and started casting Fire and Lightning Spells at the Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild like a Gatling gun.

Mo Fan purposely relocated himself to prevent his spells from hurting the villagers. He slowly moved the fight toward the back of the village, allowing the villagers to escape during the chaotic situation.

The people of the Red Ornaments Guild had no time to waste on the villagers. They were going to die if they did not take out Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu. They would rather die than give their money away!

“Hey hey hey, the bandits are running away. Why are you attacking me?!” yelled Zhao Manyan.

“Shut up, I’m going to kill you!” Oni’s heart burned furiously, as she felt like she had been tricked.

She was so close to falling for the liar. It was such an insult!

“Take him down, I’m going to skin him alive!” Oni gave the order. Her men immediately surrounded Zhao Manyan.

Oni’s men were a lot stronger compared to the initial group. Many of them were Intermediate Magicians. They immediately attacked Zhao Manyan with waves of destructive energy. Zhao Manyan quickly stacked up different defensive spells on himself in a panic.

“This kid has so many defensive spells.”

“How is he not dead yet?”

Oni was even more infuriated when she realized that Zhao Manyan was unharmed after being blasted by waves of spells.

How dare he try to trick her? She was going to tear him into pieces!

“Keep going, blast him to pieces!” Oni snapped.

“Oni, listen to me... wait, can you please explain first? What did I do wrong?” Zhao Manyan still had the mood to talk despite the situation he was in.

He was protected by two layers of defense. The first layer consisted of five circling Water Barriers, and the second layer was a Rock Barrier that he could summon within a second. The spells were like raindrops pouring onto an oiled paper umbrella... not very effective!

Oni screamed out angrily when she saw the liar still had the guts to talk to her casually, pretending that he was clueless about the situation. She immediately channeled an Advanced Spell!

It was rare for Oni to use her Advanced Spell on someone. She was seriously angry this time!
