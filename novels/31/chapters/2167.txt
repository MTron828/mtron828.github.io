The Cross Mark Demon Titan was insane. It would stir up strong gusts of wind that could be felt over four kilometers away as it was running. It went from one side of the island to the other like a flash of lightning. Mo Fan was already using the Space Element as he was flying, yet he still could not shake the Demon Titan off.

“Ling!~”

Flame Belle Empress was a little angry. How was the enormous creature so agile? She did not believe the Demon Titan could beat her in speed. The fiery feathers on Mo Fan’s wings rose. He had no clue what kind of ability Flame Belle Empress was going to use this time.

“Exploding Feathers?” Mo Fan was informed of Flame Belle Empress’ intention since their minds were connected.

Every feather had a little tongue of heavenly flame attached to them. Flame Belle Empress directly poured her energy into the feathers and turned them into thrusters!

Mo Fan felt like a burning titanium robot carrying a rocket thruster on his back. He soared into the clouds. The mountains below him became blurry and eventually faded into the distance!

Flame Belle Empress cried out in joy when she saw the Cross Mark Demon Titan give up on the chase.

“Little Flame Belle, we are running away instead of probing its speed. Can you control the feathers individually so I can control our speed freely?” Mo Fan asked.

It was Mo Fan’s first time merging with Flame Belle Empress. He was still unfamiliar with her new power, so it was unwise to fight the strong Demon Titan head-on. He had to familiarize himself with Flame Belle Empress and set the hotkeys for her abilities!

“Ling!~” Flame Belle Empress’ voice was quite deep, yet she still responded like an energetic little girl!

“Great, time to turn around!” Mo Fan said.

The fiery feathers altered their angles and lined up perfectly, like the delicate armor of a robot!

The heavenly flames exploded simultaneously. The fiery feathers turned into lines of exhaust. When hundreds of them began to propel Mo Fan forward, they turned him into a brilliant ray of light, traveling several kilometers in the blink of an eye and lighting up the night sky!

“Let’s bait its attack out first!” Mo Fan had arrived before the Demon Titan. He clearly sensed it was reacting to his return.

The Demon Titan’s reaction time was surprisingly quick. Even with Mo Fan’s outstanding speed, it managed to react in time.

The Demon Titan was extremely confident in its defense, and did not bother taking a defensive approach. It accumulated a magical silvery light on its fist when it saw Mo Fan flying at it!

Mo Fan thought the Demon Titan was throwing a heavy punch at him, but the magical light shifted and gathered on its hand. The magic seal that was burning like lava on its back was glowing too!

The Sword of a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan!

Broadswords were popular in Europe, and were originally based on the swords of the Tyrant Titans. The Cross Mark Demon Titan was Summoning its strongest weapon!

Having a weapon was a great difference between a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan and a Blue Star Tyrant Titan. The weapons of the Silver Moon Tyrant Titans were their greatest power!

The Sword took shape rapidly. Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan were still at the olive grove on the other side of the island, but their souls shivered in fear when the Demon Titan brought forth its sword. They finally understood the reason why people in Greece kept referring to the Tyrant Titans as ancient gods!

The Sword was stuck into a hill, which looked like a little sand dune as it only managed to cover the tip of the Sword. When the Demon Titan wrapped its fingers around the Sword, it looked like an ancient god had descended upon the little island.

“Silver Moon Broadsword, Sea Splitting Sword!”

The Bishop of the Black Church was overwhelmed by excitement when he saw the Sword. He enthusiastically gave orders to the Demon Titan.

The Sea Splitting Sword was what had split Green Sprouts Island in half. It had sunk the olive grove, which was over three hundred hectares in size, and turned the city into ashes!

Who could possibly stand a chance against the Sea Splitting Sword?

No one!

—

The Sea Splitting Sword created a scything plane in the air when it was swung horizontally. It headed straight at Mo Fan!

“Little Flame Belle, change into flying mode!”

Mo Fan was not planning to attack. He had to trick the Demon Titan into attacking him first. Most importantly, he was getting used to Little Flame Belle’s thrusters!

The fiery feathers on Mo Fan changed direction as soon as he saw the Demon Titan swinging the Sword at him. The thrusters that were propelling him forward were aiming at the ground instead.

Explosive Thrusters!

Hundreds of feathers exploded, pushing Mo Fan into the sky as he shot forward at an insane speed!

The silver light emitted by the Sword barely scratched Mo Fan’s skin, as if a red meteorite which had altered its path had almost missed the surface of the moon.

Mo Fan rose into the sky and instantly reached the clouds. When he looked down, the Demon Titan was still in the motion of swinging its Sword, yet it had lifted its gaze and was staring after Mo Fan anxiously. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Demon Titan had executed the slash with all its might, yet Mo Fan had dodged it by changing the direction he was flying in!

It was almost impossible to change direction once you were traveling at a certain speed. A vehicle would lose control when it tried to turn at high speed, let alone Mo Fan, who was flying at the speed of a rocket.

The Demon Titan had assumed Mo Fan was challenging its speed and power. He would not stop after gaining the momentum, yet it was instead tricked in the end.

Missing a swing was worse than landing the hit. It was easy for the person swinging a Sword to injure their ribs. The Sword hit nothing but air. It had to fully exert its strength before pulling the Sword back, or it would injure itself!

Mo Fan’s strategy to trick the Demon Titan to attack first was a success. He finally found himself a perfect opportunity for a counterattack against the Demon Titan and its outstanding reaction speed.

“You’re not the only one with a weapon! Little Flame Belle, give me my Sword!”

Mo Fan lifted his right arm. As expected of his beloved daughter, the pure heavenly flames were accumulating around his arm like a vortex before he even finished the sentence!
