3031 A World of Difference

“You’ve killed Izisha. You’re a fake and cold-blooded saintess. You’re disqualified from becoming the Goddess. You’ll only bring us destruction!” The female sage, Mera, sobbed.

Mera was loyal to Izisha. The moment Ye Xinxia obtained the Blessing of the Goddess, the people from the Hall of Judgment revolted. Some gathered in groups to destroy her election sculpture.

It was ridiculous and hilarious to see the people changing so soon. Before this, they had pledged their loyalty to Izisha. In other words, their oaths were fake. Was it true that they could even forgo their own dignity and belief once Ye Xinxia became the Goddess?

Izisha was not inferior to Ye Xinxia. Her heart always belonged to Parthenon Temple. She never mistreated her followers.

But why were those people so heartless?!

Mera was not one of those people. She still spoke up for Izisha. Despite the fact that Izisha was gone and that everyone in the city worshiped Ye Xinxia, Izisha was an irreplaceable Goddess in Mera’s heart.

“Mera, Parthenon Temple is not a place that provides freedom of speech. You’d better not say another word, or else…” Hall Mother, Pamise, reprimanded Mera icily.

“This is Ye Xinxia’s trick. She knew she couldn’t win the election. Hence, she created the accident. She was setting herself up. Izisha wasn’t running for the Goddess position, she did this for the sake of Parthenon Temple’s future. She was trying to stop Ye Xinxia. Ye Xinxia is the Supreme Pontiff! She’s the Supreme Pontiff!” Mera almost went crazy. She screamed without caring much about anything else.

This was a scheme. Salan carefully devised the takeover plan.

She cleared all the obstacles of the Black Vatican and consecrated Ye Xinxia as the Supreme Pontiff.

She even used the Black Vatican’s cruel method to make Ye Xinxia the Goddess of Parthenon Temple.

The Supreme Pontiff was the Goddess. Parthenon Temple and Greece would not have a future.

Wen Tai had taken great pains in order to protect the world. But Salan made use of their daughter and destroyed everything!

Why were none of the people sober-minded? Why were none of them willing to listen to Mera? Why couldn’t the people accept the terrifying truth?!

“Remove her female sage earrings and lock her up inside the Hall of the Goddess.” Ye Xinxia did not allow Mera to continue to be reckless.

“You can do whatever you want to do to me, but I won’t give in to you!” Mera said firmly, but she was in a state where she was about to collapse.

Mera was taken away by several knights. Her female sage earrings were removed before the public. For a moment, the female servants who used to serve Izisha were so scared that they fell on their knees.

Once they were removed from the position of female sages, they were unlikely to be allowed to stay in Parthenon Temple.

The moment they left Parthenon Temple, they were nothing. Parthenon Temple disallowed them from casting the spells they learned from the temple. The simple ones were fine. At least, they could stay rich. On the contrary, the female servants and sages with great power, who came from great families, and were involved in various government sectors would most likely lose everything…

This would be no different from destroying their lives.

Moreover, the two saintesses’ campaigns frequently clashed with each other head-on. Many female sages and servants had said disrespectful things about Ye Xinxia.

Prior to this day, they had never imagined that Ye Xinxia might be victorious.

“Everyone, rise. You can show your loyalty to her on Blessing Day. Today is just election day.” Hall Mother, Pamise, reprimanded them with a huff when she saw that the female servants and sages were so quick to curry favor with Ye Xinxia.

“Hall Mother,” said Ye Xinxia after she saw several Adjudicators take the Black Druggist in chains. “Let me handle him.”

“Hmm…” Hall Mother Pamise hesitated. She looked into Ye Xinxia’s eyes and realized that Ye Xinxia was not asking her for approval. “Alright. Keep a close watch on him. He’s one of the Black Vatican’s key men.”

“I will. Thank you for your hard work, Hall Mother. You may go back to the Goddess Peak and take a rest. I’ll handle the rest,” said Ye Xinxia to Hall Mother, Pamise.

Hall Mother, Pamise, nodded.

The election was over. Ye Xinxia took over Parthenon Temple’s control. Blessing Day would be held tomorrow, and it would be the official day of handing the reins over to Ye Xinxia. However, that wouldn’t make much of a difference.

After all, Ye Xinxia had gained Parthenon Temple and Athenians’ acknowledgement. Handing over the controlling power to Ye Xinxia on Blessing Day was just a form of ritual.

Before the Goddess was elected, Hall Mother, Pamise, had been in charge of much of Parthenon Temple’s power. Even some of the Parthenon Temple’s important spells such as the Blessing Art were in her custody.

“Athenians, you don’t have to panic. Just enjoy the Flower Festival. The Goddess will protect all of you.” Hall Mother, Pamise, raised both of her hands in the direction of Ye Xinxia’s sculpture.

The election results were finally released. The people had witnessed Ye Xinxia commanding the Hall of Knights to avenge and kill the giants. They were aware that she was the only Parthenon Temple’s supreme God’s Chosen Daughter who protected them and the city.

For a moment, the word “Goddess” rang throughout the city. No one bothered to mention Izisha. Even Izisha’s supporters followed the crowd and cried out loudly. Perhaps, they realized they had previously made a wrong choice. Thus, they worked hard to worship and support Ye Xinxia in the hope that they could receive Parthenon Temple’s blessing!

Ye Xinxia had not prepared the winning speech. She left the election altar and controlled a Holy Silver Finch. The finch flew gracefully toward the middle of Parthenon Mountain.

Behind her was a group of majestic knights and a terrifying Tyrant Titan ablaze in black-striped flames from head to toe. The Tyrant Titan was carried to the sky by hundreds of knights and flying dragons. The Tyrant Titan looked like a trophy under the crowd’s gazes. It was carried into Parthenon Temple as Ye Xinxia returned to Parthenon Mountain.

“Is that the emperor-level Golden Sun Tyrant Titan? Has it been killed?” The people were shocked.

Hardly anyone in the world had the ability to kill an emperor-level creature. Not long ago, the people coiled up in fear under the terrifying Tyrant Titan’s black-striped flames attack. They were tortured and suffered under the heat waves. However, at that moment, the arrogant and seemingly undefeatable Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was carried by the Hall of Knights like a slaughtered animal.

“Its head is separated from its body. It must have died. Oh, my god! It has finally died!”

“Without the Goddess, I’m afraid we would have been reduced to ashes under the demon’s trample. All thanks to the mighty Goddess.”

“Tomorrow is her first day of Blessing Day. No matter what, we have to squeeze into Parthenon Mountain to gain some blessings!”

“I learned that we could earn a longer lifespan if we received the blessing on the first day of Blessing Day…”

“That’s not true. It’s the Holy Dew that can improve one’s cultivation by leaps and bounds. Mages who are stuck in the bottleneck may advance to super level because of the blessing.”

Longevity was related to the soul. During the cultivation process, many mages would more or less suffer soul trauma. Soul trauma was different from the wound inflicted on the body. It was impossible to heal the soul.

The rumor that the first day of the blessing could bless one with a longer lifespan was true. Likewise, their cultivation level could also be improved. Mages were aware that the strength and weakness of their souls depended on their spiritual realms. Once they managed to surpass their spiritual realms, they would not be stuck in a cultivation bottleneck anymore.

Mages who had exceeded super level would have little difficulty to achieve super level in other elements. In fact, they had the ability to improve their magic elements without the help of external forces. Their spiritual realm allowed their other magic element to achieve super level. After their spiritual realm reached a higher level, they would never be stuck in a bottleneck.

The election was over, but the disaster was not fully settled. There were still killings going on outside. The Athenian government had a difficult time in handling the damaged streets as a result of the fire. However, most Athenians had forgotten about it. Tomorrow was the first day of the Blessing of the Goddess. Countless people flocked to the foothill of Parthenon Temple, hoping to be chosen for the Hall of Faith by dawn. After they were chosen, they would be showered with the Holy Dew from the olive branches.

There were very few devoted worshippers. Most of them had a purpose of their own. They did this all for their own sake.

At the observatory at the Goddess Peak, it was already nighttime. The killings outside the city finally stopped. The city lights lit up. The hustle and bustle of the city made it look as if the incident during the day had never happened.

Athenian officers were highly effective. The Goddess was elected in the middle of the battle, and they had to celebrate the occasion. Likewise, the city also had to mourn for the deaths of the deceased. As a result, the officers used all available resources. They quickly repaired the damaged areas and consoled the families of the deceased.

Ye Xinxia did not expel Izisha’s former subordinates out of Parthenon Temple. She assigned them a difficult task, which was to work with the officers to comfort the people who were affected by the war.

Fortunately, they managed to save the city in time. The damage caused by the Tyrant Titans was less severe compared to other cities. The disturbance of the Undead often happened in Egypt. Similarly, the incident of the Tyrant Titan trampling the people to death happened every year in Greece. It was a strife that had been going on for thousands of years.

If the local officials and the Magic Association failed to handle the situation with care, even the appearance of a Blue Star Tyrant Titan could cause more casualties to a city than the damages in Athens.

With the birth of the Goddess, the forces, organizations, and officers became more motivated.

The only difference between a saintess and a Goddess was their position. However, in just half a day’s time, Ye Xinxia felt a world’s difference between the two.

“Hua Lisi, bring these two people to me. I want to talk to them about Parthenon Temple’s future,” said Ye Xinxia to the female knight behind her.

Hua Lisi obtained the Holy Soul only just moments ago. She exuded an imposing aura. Even some of the experts dared not approach her.

“Who are they?” asked Hua Lisi.

“Hall Mother, Pamise, and Black Druggist.”
