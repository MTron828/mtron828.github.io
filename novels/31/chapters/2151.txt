It had been a while since he had Summoned his wolves to feed on his enemies. For some reason, the food in the mortal plane seemed more delicious to the wolves than the food in the Summoned Beast Plane. The Moon-Devouring White Wolves and the White-Marked Wolves were particularly fond of the food of his world.

Mo Fan knew there were some real merchants in this guild who did not know magic. Therefore, he only asked the wolves to attack those who had attacked him. Mo Fan would not show mercy to any of the people who had colluded with Babbitt.

It was like a pack of starving wolves had suddenly invaded a sheep corral. The fences of the pen were stopping the sheep from running away, not protecting them. The wolves and the sheep were playing chase inside the pen. Mo Fan was treating the wolves to a great feast!

Mo Fan was a well-behaved young man most of the time, and would not do cruel things to people. After all, it was not a pleasant sight to watch his wolves feeding on their enemies. The terrifying sight might traumatize little girls, so Mo Fan rarely treated his wolves to a buffet unless the enemy was from the Black Vatican. However, the Black Ornaments of the Guild of the Wicked had certainly inherited half of the Black Vatican’s spirit.

They did not dare be as wicked as the Black Vatican, as they were afraid of being picked on by them, nor did they dare oppose the whole world, and yet they were doing outrageous things, just like the Black Vatican did!

Curbing violence with violence had always been Mo Fan’s philosophy. He could not possibly wave a Holy Bible around and convince them to repent.

“You look a little familiar,” Miss Yuri noticed. She was not frightened by the gory scene.

“I also think you are a little familiar... I forgot to ask you, are you with them?” Mo Fan asked Miss Yuri politely.

Yuri shook her head and said, “I only do proper business with the merchant guild. Look down the cliff.”

Mo Fan looked over the cliff and saw a destroyed luxury car.

“You are a Shadow Mage. You should be able to see the fat pig sleeping comfortably down there, can’t you?” Yuri smiled.

Mo Fan did see a man lying on the cliff. It looked like he was covered in blood, but he was still alive. He had only broken his limbs.

“Who is he? Second Wolf, drag that guy to the side and eat him over there! Can’t you see I’m having a conversation here?” Mo Fan chided the wolf.

Second Wolf raised its head and looked at Mo Fan innocently. It had already been feeding on the enemy here before Mo Fan and the woman came over to the edge of the cliff!

“He’s Mr. Lin, the owner of the olive grove and a rich merchant from Green Sprouts Island. He has three beautiful daughters. Two of them died in the tragedy, and the last one was kidnapped tonight. Mr. Lin was out of his mind to come and confront Babbitt before you showed up, so I did Babbitt a favor and saved Mr. Lin’s life too,” Yuri said.

“Are you sure it happened before I reached here?” Mo Fan smiled.

Yuri was startled.

If he was a Shadow Mage, he would already have been here when Kachasa reached the merchant guild, which meant he had seen what had happened to Mr. Lin!

“You didn’t kill him, so my wolves didn’t eat you like the others. It’s a pity if a woman with a slim waist and big bust ends up being eaten by the wolves,” Mo Fan observed.

“Who are you?” Yuri asked. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Who are you?” Mo Fan replied directly.

Yuri had not killed Mr. Lin, Mo Fan had seen it very clearly. The man had only fainted after falling down the cliff. In other words, she had saved his life. Babbitt would not have spared his life.

Mo Fan would not have let him die either way. It seemed he was involved in something serious.

Big Wolf burped all of a sudden. The smell almost reached Mo Fan.

The luxurious merchant guild looked like Hell, covered with broken limbs, shattered organs, and thick fresh blood scattered across the place. Mo Fan ordered the wolves to clean up the mess. It would be terrible if other people saw the place. They might think it was the work of the Black Vatican!

Babbitt remained motionless. He was surrounded by staring white wolves, their fangs all exposed. The guild had over two dozen elites! Seven of them were Advanced Mages! Their levels were above Black Diamond! Even if the sacred organizations in Europe sent a group after them, they would have to worry about their own safety.

But the top seven Mages were all dead now!

How could a Mage Summon forth a dozen Commander-level creatures out of nowhere? It was enough to attack a city!

“How did this happen? Even Babbitt’s men are dead?” The tattooed man was about to lose his mind!

He had thought Babbitt was very powerful among the people he knew, yet even he had lost to the worker of an inn who had served him fruits.

Most importantly, the nightmare did not end there.

Mo Fan did not kill Babbitt. He gave him the same offer!

Babbitt had a day to ask his superior for protection, but for some reason, the tattooed man had a feeling Babbitt was already a dead man. Their guild had seriously provoked a devil!

“So what if you are strong? There are many high-level Mages in this world, but those who are in control are usually people without magic. Have you had any idea the consequences of messing with the Black Ornaments and the Guild of the Wicked? You might be able to kill my men, but can you kill every member of the guild?” Babbitt screamed at him.

Only those who found themselves at the edge of a cliff would utter such words. They were just trying to provoke their enemy after learning they were going to die for sure, something along the lines of ‘I will hunt you down after I turn into a vengeful spirit!’

Mo Fan would not be provoked so easily, and remained calm.

“You don’t have to yell at me. I just told you that I won’t kill you right now. You can ask your superior for protection. If the Guild of the Wicked is as strong as you describe, there must be someone who can kill me. You will live once I’m dead, so if you have the time to throw a tantrum here, you might as well think about who you should be asking for help,” Mo Fan informed him calmly.

“Are you seriously letting me go?” Babbitt could not believe it.

“Why do you think he’s still standing here? Isn’t it easy for me to kill him?” Mo Fan pointed at the tattooed man.

Babbitt looked at the tattooed man, before glancing at Kachasa, who had been dead for a long time.

“You are going to regret it. I swear, my superior has great power in Greece. There’s nothing he can’t do!” Babbitt swore at Mo Fan.
