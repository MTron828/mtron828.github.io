The Manta Ray Evil Birds were not as aggressive when the group started working their way back. The group also had the enforcers with them, who worked hard to fend off the Manta Ray Evil Birds since they did not want to die to the birds either.

As long as a destructive Mage like Mo Fan had a safe environment to use his magic, the Manta Ray Evil Birds, be they in the sky and in the ocean, were going to taste what real destruction was. A large number of Manta Ray Evil Birds ended up turning into Soul Remnants and Soul Essences before flying into Mo Fan’s Pendant.

The Manta Ray Evil Birds stopped chasing them as the group was approaching the shore.

Mo Fan felt a lot more comfortable after setting his feet on land. He still did not have enough when he saw the Manta Ray Evil Birds retreating. He ended up firing a Fiery Dragon at the Manta Ray Evil Birds, burning them into ashes under the clouds and providing the fish in the water with more nutrients.

“I think I know why the number of the Manta Ray Evil Birds has risen so much all of a sudden,” Lingling said, looking at the burning red sky.

“An enclosed island with a superb environment without any natural foes. I can easily give birth to a whole nest of kids if you let me stay on the island with a group of women,” Zhao Manyan said shamelessly.

“Let’s save the bird first. We’ll discuss it later,” Mo Fan said.

“You didn’t sign a contract with the Bird Emperor, meaning it’s still untamed. Are you sure there’s someone willing to treat its injuries?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

The Bird Emperor was a demon creature. No one would allow Mo Fan to bring it into their city!

“Take it to Fanxue Mountain. Yu Shishi’s there, her moth might be able to do something. I think I saw her helping a member of Fanxue Mountain treat a Summoned Beast,” Mu Bai put forth.

“Her moths can heal an injured creature? How come no one mentioned that before?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

“I think he’s referring to the Moon Moth Phoenix,” Lingling said.

“Yeah, that’s right!” Mo Fan slapped himself on the head.

The mountain to the west of Fanxue Mountain was off-limits, having become the territory of Yu Shishi’s moths. The place was a certain distance away from Fanxue City, and it was rare for anyone to visit it. It felt like the mountain had become quite magical ever since the little Moon Moth Phoenix had started staying there. The mountain had a mystical vibe when the people from Fanxue City observed it at night.

In the past, Mo Fan had treated the mountain as an experimental ground for his Fire Magic. He had even fought Houndman and his Dreadful Curse Cerberus on it. It used to be barren and infertile, but it was now covered in trees and flowers, like a utopia!

“Well, Vice Chief Tang, why don’t I give Brother Mo Fan a ride with my Summoned Beast since we are running short on time?” Li Dong said fawningly.

“You’re a f**king opportunist!” Mo Fan snapped.

“Hehe, it’s called adapting to circumstances. I didn’t know Chief Zhu Qi was that kind of a person before,” Li Dong said. His nose and face were swollen right now. Mu Bai had even knocked a few of his teeth out. He was as ugly as a monster when he smiled.

“Fine, that will do,” Tangyue agreed coolly.

Tangyue, Lingling, Jiang Shaoxu, and Mu Bai did not leave Wanggui Town right away.

Mu Bai knew Zhao Manyan was preoccupied with the Totem Beast under the island. He volunteered, “Why don’t we go to the island at night?”

“Is it enough with just the two of us?” Zhao Manyan had to ask.

“We’re not picking a fight with them. I’ll put them to sleep while you look for the Totem Seal,” Mu Bai said.

“That’s reasonable... Mu Bai, I didn’t know you are such a reliable friend. I swear I will never call you Green Tea Man again. I won’t even drink green tea for the rest of my life!” Zhao Manyan promised.

Mu Bai twisted his lips. He did not really care if they were calling him by his nickname. Besides, he could easily get his revenge if he wanted. Both Zhao Manyan and Mo Fan would be injured or be poisoned eventually...

“Are you two fine on your own? Should we wait for Mo Fan to come back instead?” Tangyue was still a little worried.

The two immediately shook their heads. “It’s more convenient with just the two of us if we are only looking for something in the sea. It’s actually a burden to bring a non-swimmer like Mo Fan with us!”

“You’re right.”

When night came, Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan began to make their moves. Zhao Manyan did not feel tired at all. He was a lot bolder now, perhaps because finding the Totem Beast would decide if he could become a Super Mage or not!

That night, Tangyue told the Lingyin Enforcement Union about the mess that Zhu Qi and Councilman Nan had left on the island. She was having trouble falling asleep, unsurprisingly. It was actually quite common for some people to have difficulty falling asleep when they were worn out by fatigue, or perhaps when their minds were still preoccupied with something.

Tangyue heard Jiang Shaoxu and Lingling’s voices coming from the balcony. She went up to them.

“Why are you two still awake?” Tangyue asked them.

“Sister Tangyue, you came just in time. I’ve done my experiment on the poisonous creature you mentioned. I also came up with a better way to get rid of the Manta Ray Evil Birds,” Lingling said.

“Poisonous creature?” Tangyue was puzzled. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“The poisonous creature you were trying to catch in the first place. Didn’t you say a lot of townsfolk were poisoned? I asked Sister Jiang to help me find it on the island,” Lingling said.

Tangyue slapped herself on the head. How did she forget such an important matter?!

“Luckily, you still remembered it. Otherwise, we’d have to go to Dawn Island again,” Tangyue said.

Things had gotten a little out of control after they went to the island. Zhu Qi had also shown up and interfered with their work. Tangyue had completely forgotten she was supposed to look for the poisonous creature on Dawn Island.

“Sister Tangyue, the poisonous creatures are called the Stinky Mayflies. They normally feed on the feces of other creatures in the sea, which precipitate on the seabed. They also happened to be the best source of nutrients for the Manta Ray Evil Birds. They are like a kind of natural food for the Manta Ray Evil Birds,” Lingling said.

“Such disgusting creatures,” Jiang Shaoxu said, her lips twisting.

“But, why were there so many Stinky Mayflies around Dawn Island all of a sudden? Where did those things come from?” Tangyue asked.

“They usually feed on the feces of sea creatures, especially the waste of creatures like shellfish and Salamander Demons,” Lingling said.

Tangyue was stunned after hearing the words. She stared at Lingling in the eyes for some time before saying, “You’re saying that...”

“Yes, the Stinky Mayflies are a result of the Calamity of the Cloud of White Demons!” Lingling said.

The White Demons Cloud referred to the floating white mass that was visible even at a great distance. The nation-sized school of countless Salamander Demons was slowly moving toward the shorelines of many countries!

“So the feces of the White Demons Cloud has caused the Stinky Mayflies to multiply, and the Manta Ray Evil Birds were feeding on them!?” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed in disbelief.

“The feces of sea monsters are the primary food source for plankton, and those organisms are the food supply of many sea monsters. The threat of the Manta Ray Evil Birds might only be the tip of the iceberg for the entire Pacific Ocean!”
