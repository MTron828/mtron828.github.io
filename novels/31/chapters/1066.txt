Palice had a dark expression. The offensive Mages of their team, one Water and one Fire, had been knocked out. The only members left on their team were a Healer, a Psychic Mage, and an Ice Mage...

Their combination was not the main problem. The problem was that they were going up against an extremely violent Fire Mage, who was totally unpredictable. Not only was his Fire incredibly powerful, he had a variety of moves, and his spells had lots of different forms too. They would have trouble winning the match if they could not think of a way to take him out!

“We have to take out their carry!” Palice said to the other two members.

“He’s pretty tough; the chance of me casting my Mind Control on him is extremely low,” the Psychic Mage said.

The Mage that had tried to ambush the Chinese team by diving underwater was actually an Ice Mage. Unfortunately, his Ice Spells were totally useless against his opponent’s fierce flames. Even though the man did not have a Domain, his Fire was as strong as someone with a Domain!

“We’ll attack at the same time!” Palice said.

Their team was supposed to clinch the victory with the Catastrophe Wave. They did not expect their team to be placed in a pinch like this. Their biggest mistake was failing to recognize that the Fire Mage was actually one of the core members of the Chinese team!

If they did not try their best to keep the Fire Mage at bay, he could totally fight a few of their members simultaneously. It was a relief that they had a Psychic Mage on their team. Otherwise, they would never be able to endure the continuous blasts from the Fire Mage!

“Nanrong Ni, heal me, I’ll face them head-on!” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan knew the woman was mindful of what the crowd thought of her. If they were not in the middle of a match, she would be merciful enough if she did not feed him poison milk, let alone cast a Healing Spell on him!

Nanrong Ni was indeed cognizant of the situation she was in. She began to cast the Advanced Healing Spell.

A new ocean-blue Aquarius Star Sign started to wrap around Mo Fan. As soon as Mo Fan saw the protection, he immediately rushed toward the enemy team like a mad man.

As he landed, he immediately summoned a ring of flames. Even though Mo Fan did not have any defensive spells protecting him, the three members of the Spanish team felt like none of their attacks were able to inflict serious damage on him. They finally left a few scratches on him, but after a single glow emitted by the Aquarius Star Sign, the man immediately recovered from his injuries!

The faces of the trio began to contort. Wasn’t this guy a bit too reckless, taking on the three of them on his own?

Even though they were not offensive Mages, their Advanced Spells could still inflict serious damage to him. Wasn’t he worried that he would be taken out by the three of them?

Palice bit her lips. They decided to flank Mo Fan, yet before they could carry it out, the man had simply rushed forward so they could surround him. He was utterly fearless!

Despite that, the trio seriously could not do anything to the man. Both the secondary Lightning Element and primary Ice Element of the Ice Mage were completely ineffective when they landed on the fire engulfing the man’s body. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was reasonable that the Ice Element was unable to inflict any serious damage to the man, since the damage of the Ice Spells were bound to be weakened against the overwhelming energy of his Fire Element. The Icebound Coffin was smashed into pieces by a single Fiery Fist before it could even land on the ground. But what about the Lightning Element?

The Psychic Mage’s secondary Lightning Element was totally ineffective against the man too, even though it was known to be one of the Elements with the highest damage!

The man was afraid of neither Ice nor Lightning, and the plants trying to entrap him were burned into ashes in an instant. Even though the remaining members of the Spanish team were not offensive Mages, they all broke down mentally when they realized they could not even take out a single person!

“That guy is an absolute monster!”

“Even with the effects of the Aquarius Star Sign, it doesn’t simply mean he can just charge forward and take on the three of them!” a supporter of the Spanish team said sullenly.

“Is the Chinese team about to rise this year? Why is every member of their team so strong?”

“Yeah, the guy with the Space Element, the Ice Maga, and this Fire Mage, while the remaining members on their team aren’t weak, either... for example, that Sound Maga is very good at controlling the match.”

Mo Fan the monster charged around violently between the three members of the Spanish team. The Psychic Mage’s continued attempt to disrupt his channeling was in vain too, as Mo Fan did not even need to draw Star Patterns and Star Constellations when casting his spells. Most of the abilities were from Little Flame Belle’s outstanding control of the Calamity Fire, so he could easily cast the spells with a single thought.

In addition to that, Mo Fan’s speed when casting Fiery Fists was absolutely insane, and the damage of his Fiery Fists was higher than the Sky-Flame Funeral at times. The Psychic Mage might have a chance of interrupting his Advanced Spell, yet there was no way she could disrupt Mo Fan’s Fiery Fists!

“Mo Fan, focus on the Psychic Mage!” Nanyu suddenly directed him.

Mo Fan looked at the Psychic Mage and saw she was being targeted by sonic waves. She was struggling to keep a clear mind...

The Sound Element was very effective against the Psychic Element. Nanyu had made her move now just so they could take out the Psychic Mage once and for all!

The Psychic Mage was very cunning, too. She had been keeping her distance from Mo Fan.

The ground was submerged in water, but it was not enough to stop Mo Fan from carrying out his attack. He lifted up the broken Dragon Fangs with Telekinesis and lined them up in a row to build a bridge over ten meters long for him.

Mo Fan agilely leapt between the floating rocks, making his way toward the Psychic Mage.

The other two members of the Spanish team were taken by surprise. They tried to lend a hand, yet they found themselves being trapped by Nanrong Ni’s plants, and missed out on the chance to save their teammate.

“Down you go!” Mo Fan hurled his fist forward. Nine fiery dragons sprang forward in a storm, sending the Psychic Mage to the edge of the magic barrier.

Flames surged fiercely. The assistant judges realized that the flames might burn the Psychic Mage into a pile of bones, and quickly intervened to save her life.

Another member of the Spanish team was knocked out. The members of the Chinese team in the resting area seemed relieved.

“Mo Fan is being Mo Fan after all. If we hadn’t sent that mad hound up there, we might actually have lost the match!” someone exclaimed.

The advisors were relieved, too. Just like the person had mentioned, if it wasn’t for Mo Fan’s ability to fight three people on his own, it would be hard to tell who was going to win the match after Pinole was taken out. After all, both Jiang Shaoxu and Zu Jiming were knocked out by the Catastrophe Wave, before they could even contribute to the match. That did not necessarily mean they were weak, but the Catastrophe Wave was simply too powerful for them. Any other team would share the same fate as them if they had fought the Spanish team!

“Mo Fan is getting even stronger,” Dongfang Lie, currently a substitute, had a helpless look.

They were once the great talents of Pearl Institute, yet in just a year, Mo Fan was already ahead by so much. He felt like crying every time he thought about it.

Meanwhile, Mu Nujiao also had her eyes on Mo Fan. She was the person that was the most familiar with Mo Fan of this group watching, yet the pace of his growth was just too shocking, just as Dongfang Lie had mentioned...

Most terrifyingly... Mo Fan had yet to use two of his Elements in the match against the Spanish team!

Mu Nujiao clearly knew the Elements that Mo Fan possessed. It wasn’t just his fierce Fire Element; his Lightning Element was also considered his primary Element, and yet he had not cast a single Lightning Spell in the match against the Spanish team!

In addition to that, Mu Nujiao clearly remembered that Mo Fan’s Shadow Element was quite impressive too, and similarly, he did not cast a single offensive Shadow Spell in the match. He cast Fleeing Shadow a few times to dodge some of the attacks, but most people assumed it to be the power of his magic boots...

Mo Fan had defeated the Spanish team while still managing to keep two of his Elements a secret. His strength was beyond terrifying!

“How could this be... how did it end up like this!?” Prince Beny was absolutely enraged. He even flipped the tray of fruits to the ground when he realized that the outcome had been decided.

Miss Conti frowned slightly and said in a calm voice, “Prince Beny, please contain yourself, as you’re still in a public venue. I suggest you research more about your opponents before you decide to compete against them. The person that tossed you into the canals is very, very strong.”

“Ah? Brother, so it was true that someone tossed you into the canals? I thought that was something that the reporters made up!” the young girl exclaimed with wide eyes.

Prince Beny’s expression darkened. He glared at his sister, whose voice was extremely loud.

“Prince, we’ve lost the money,” Prince Beny’s servant said in a low voice.

Prince Beny’s lips twisted. Did this stupid servant have to mention it now? Couldn’t he mention it later?

“Prince, a hundred million has just been deducted from our account. Can you please not act so recklessly next time? If you’re a fan, betting a few million, or ten, twenty million is enough. How could you bet a hundred million on it?” the purser said, obviously displeased.

He had only just learned that Prince Beny had placed a hundred million on the match. Was a hundred million a small sum? Of course not! No matter how spoiled the prince was, it was unacceptable for him to waste such a huge amount of money!

“Shut up, all of you, that’s enough! You, how did you teach the students? How could we possibly lose to the Chinese team? Have you forgotten the pride of the Spanish?” Prince Beny immediately put the blame on the advisor.

The advisor of the Spanish team was well aware of the prince’s temper, and simply disregarded the accusation.

Spain was no longer under a monarchy, and the preservation of the royal family was a mere symbol. The prince could act arrogantly as he pleased, and the people could fawn over him as they wanted.

Prince Beny completely lost it when the advisor ignored him, yet he could not find any better way to vent his anger.

“Such a spoiled brat,” Miss Conti shook her head and sighed.

The Chinese team eventually won the match. Without the Psychic Mage’s disturbance, no one could possibly stop Mo Fan’s attacks. Even Palice was left with no choice, since her Healing Magic was unable to make any difference after her teammates were knocked out!
