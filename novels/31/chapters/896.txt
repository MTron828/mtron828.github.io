Drops of a strange chemical fell onto a middle-aged disciple, sizzling as they did. The corpse soon turned into a pool of black goo on the ground.

“This thing has really helped me a lot!” Mo Fan exclaimed, waving the bottle that he took from Yang Qiao earlier. It was definitely a must-bring for anyone who was planning to go on a vacation and kill someone!

After Mo Fan went to the lower level in the Black Vatican’s nest, he would conveniently deal with the disciples of the Black Vatican who happened to be alone, and used the black bottle to deal with the corpses. The Black Vatican must be aware that some of their disciples were missing, but since they did not see any corpses, they could not tell if there were any intruders.

Counting the number of disciples he had taken out, the reward he would get from them was only around four million, nothing significant.

Mo Fan was not wandering aimlessly, either. Mu Ningxue was incredibly smart. She kept leaving the little ice crystals along the way. As long as Mo Fan followed her trail, he could find Mu Ningxue and the others.

This place must be the Black Vatican’s nest. If they could find a cure to the poison, they would be able to catch all the members of the Black Vatican in one net!

When he reached the dungeon, he was surprised to discover that no one was guarding the place. He simply strutted right in.

Mu Ningxue, Rong Sheng, and Guo Wenyi were kept in a normal cell. Mu Ningxue could easily break free from it if she wanted. Mo Fan was rather amused that the Black Vatican actually had someone so careless.

“Are you alright?” he asked.

“Mm, thanks to Zhao Pinlin for bringing us into their nest,” said Mu Ningxue.

“I was checking around, there are quite a lot of disciples here, the two of us won’t be able to handle them all,” said Mo Fan.

“Did Lingling manage to...” began Mu Ningxue.

“To what?” asked Mo Fan in confusion.

Mu Ningxue frowned. She tried to talk, yet she realized that she could not make any sound.

Mo Fan initially thought she was having a dry throat, but when he saw black blood flowing out from her mouth, he was thunderstruck!

The deadly black blood!

Mo Fan felt like his mind was going to explode watching her.

He immediately went into the cell with the Fleeing Shadow and grabbed Mu Ningxue’s shoulders, taking a closer look at her.

The blood was indeed black. No matter how difficult it was for Mo Fan to believe, the black blood continued to pour out from her lips.

“Black blood, she is vomiting black blood!”

“Save her quick, think of a way to save her!” Guo Wenyi and Rong Sheng started to panic.

They had witnessed the process several times. The terrifying symptoms happened so quick that the victim was killed even before their hearts could be fully overwhelmed by the fear.

Now, the terrifying symptoms were happening on Mu Ningxue who was right beside them. Rong Sheng and Guo Wenyi felt their minds going blank.

“Xuexue...” Mo Fan’s mind was in a mess. He would feel better if the symptoms were happening to him.

Why her? Lingling already mentioned how unlikely it was that the poison would kill them. Did the Heavens really hate her that much?

“Mo... Fan... please calm down...” Mu Ningxue was able to control the black blood with some method.

However, Mo Fan knew it was useless trying to resist it. Mu Ningxue would soon turn into a black corpse. She was perfect like a goddess in his heart, even a little scratch on her skin would bring enormous pain to his heart, let alone the thought of her turning into the dried, black corpse. As the thought crossed Mo Fan’s mind, his eyes immediately turned bloodshot!

“You will be fine, trust me, I’ll clear the path to the Blue Deacon and force her to give me the antidote! Just hang in there,” Mo Fan took a deep breath.

Mu Ningxue shook her head. An extremely cold aura came out of her body, and tightly wrapped around her. It continued to penetrate the blood vessels that were now visible under her skin.

The cold gradually grew stronger. Mo Fan saw Mu Ningxue’s face turning blue and pale from the cold.

“What are you doing?” Mo Fan was in great panic.

“Fr... freezing myself... Mo Fan, don’t panic, remember when we were at Yanming Temple?” Mu Ningxue’s body was covered in layers of frost, both on her skin and inside her body.

It was the only way Mu Ningxue could think of. The poison was able to disrupt the blood circulation of its target and accumulate the blood in a fragile spot, before erupting like a volcano, resulting in vomiting black blood. Once the target started to lose an excessive amount of blood, the functions of the body would be damaged severely. The poison would then turn the body into a pile of black dust...

The only thing that Mu Ningxue could do was to freeze her own body, significantly slowing down the rate of her blood flow.

She could not freeze her blood entirely, as that would kill her instantly. She could at most slow down the circulation. If the poison was spreading through the body through blood, her method would buy her time.

Mu Ningxue never thought she would be the next victim. She looked at Mo Fan, who was extremely worried about her, and somehow felt rather grateful. It was rare to see the shameless guy in such a panic. The worried look on his face was not something that could be disguised.

“Yanming Temple? Yes, I remember it, don’t look back in your life yet, I don’t want any separation of life and death to happen between us!” yelled Mo Fan.

“Listen to me...” Mu Ningxue said in a serious voice. Her face was already covered in frost. Her voice sounded stiff, “I will be fine for now. I’ve frozen my blood vessels.”

Mo Fan looked at her. He could feel a knife slicing at his heart as her voice gradually weakened.

“Mo Fan,” Mu Ningxue had turned into a frozen woman, but her eyes were still blinking, as if she had something important to say.

Rong Sheng and Guo Wenyi stood aside. They could tell that Mu Ningxue had kept the words in her heart for a very long time.

Didn’t Mo Fan say he didn’t want a separation of life and death between them? Wasn’t this how a typical scene would look?

However, as Mu Ningxue was about to speak, Mo Fan suddenly went forward. He placed one hand behind her icy neck and lowered his head, completely disregarded the poisonous blood by her lips. He pressed his lips hard on Mu Ningxue’s lips that had already turned purple from the cold... RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Mo Fan always imagined how soft, wet, and delicious Mu Ningxue’s lips would feel, but all he felt was icy, dry, and stiff, as if he was kissing an ice statue of a gorgeous woman.

As the lips parted, Mo Fan looked into Mu Ningxue’s eyes and said determinedly, “If you really have something to tell me, just wait until you wake up. Either you want to tell me you like me, or you hate me, I promise you I’ll listen to all of it.”

Mu Ningxue did not speak after that. Her throat was already frozen. The only body part that was still active was her glittering eyes, looking at Mo Fan’s arrogant face.

As her body was frozen, any emotion she felt was incredibly faint, too.

However, Mu Ningxue believed that if her heart was still working normally, it would definitely have sped up at this instant...
