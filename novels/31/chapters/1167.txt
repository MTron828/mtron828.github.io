“I already said, I will not show any mercy to anyone that tries to stop me!” Mo Fan glared down at the people of the Parthenon Temple coldly.

There was no way Mo Fan would let himself fall into the hands of the Parthenon Temple or the Holy Judgment Court. As a matter of fact, he already learned the ‘justice’ that these people proclaimed to serve. They were merely pursuing greater authority and power! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan was not interested in power games. He simply had the urge to raze the authorities of the entire world to the ground!

“What are you waiting for? It’s only a Ruler-level creature, are you really just going to watch it destroy the pride of the Parthenon Temple?” Great Muse Mellaura said.

“For Parthenon!”

“For Parthenon!”

The Golden Sun Knights that were the closest to the Black Totem Snake found their courage. A white-gold light shrouded their bodies. Great Muse Mellaura was casting a Blessing Spell with her words, granting the knights greater power!

The white and gold light had increased the power of the knights by fifty percent. It was extremely significant for Super Mages.

“Holy Essence Formation!” a Golden Sun Knight yelled. Brilliant Star Constellations of the Light Element constructed an enormous Star Palace of 2401 Stars. The fact that the Mage was able to draw the Star Orbits, Star Patterns, Star Constellations, and combine them all into a magnificent Star Palace implied that the Golden Sun Knight was a very experienced Super Mage!

He had completed the Light Spell. Following him, four other Golden Sun Knights with the Light Element constructed their Star Palaces too! The brilliant light shone through the dim sky as five stunning Demon Judgment Swords descended from the sky, aiming right at the enormous, black snake on the mountain!

The Black Totem Snake lifted his gaze slightly and saw the energy connecting the five enormous light swords. He immediately sensed that the Super Spells were connected by a magic formation, which would further amplify their damage!

The Black Totem Snake was extremely smart. He completely disregarded the light swords and raised his tail instead.

He swept his tail across the ground, producing a powerful shockwave that surged in all directions, knocking the five Golden Sun Knights that were planning to join their spells into a formation into the air.

The five Golden Sun Knights were wearing their Armor, but the overwhelming force broke the Armor to pieces. They landed on the ground heavily and lost consciousness!

“Kill it, kill it now!” Shawshank screamed.

Behind him were two hundred Adjudicators, the elites among the Advanced Mages. However, they were overwhelmed by their fear of the Black Totem Snake, and struggling to cast spells.

There existed a strict divide between the levels of demon creatures. The Servant-class creatures were afraid of Warrior-level creatures, the Warrior-level creatures would submit themselves to the Commander-level creatures, and the Commander-level creatures would kneel before the Ruler-level creatures. The difference was not because of their lineage, but the strong aura of deterrence that the higher-level creatures emitted.

The aura was like an irresistible Psychic Spell, crushing the lines of defense inside the Mages’ hearts!

The Golden Sun Knights were not as intimidated when facing the Black Totem Snake, but the Adjudicators were only Advanced Mages. They were considered courageous if their legs were not trembling in fear!

“Battle Drum!”

Motivating drum beats came from behind. Great Muse Mellaura had made her move again, using her Sound Element to get rid of the fear inside the hearts of the Adjudicators.

The Adjudicators could finally cast their spells. Countless Star Constellations combined into a brilliant galaxy, as the energy of the Elements surged wildly.

How destructive was it when two hundred Advanced Mages were casting their spells simultaneously?

The Black Totem Snake sensed a strong energy accumulating. He suddenly lowered his head and faced the troop of Adjudicators...

He opened his mouth and spat out a strong black wind. The breath swept forward like an incredible storm, aiming right at the troops of Adjudicators.

The Adjudicators finally had the chance to cast their spells, yet they were immediately stricken by the strong wind. It rolled over them, hitting more than a thousand people...

The breath was normally poisonous, but the Black Totem Snake was not aiming to kill the humans. It only swept the Adjudicators into the sky like straws of grass. They spun a few circles in the air and fell back to the ground. The breath did not turn them into puddles instantly!

“Useless pricks!” Shawshank snapped.

Shawshank let out a roar, summoning a pair of golden wings on his back. The wings were filled with the energy of the Light Element. They would burn any dark creature that came into contact with them.

Shawshank had no idea if the Black Totem Snake was a dark creature. He simply assumed the creature that dared to challenge the authority of the Parthenon Temple was evil. He rose into the sky and emitted a blinding light to blind the Black Totem Snake temporarily.

The Black Totem Snake stuck his tongue out and swung it at Shawshank.

Shawshank nimbly dodged it in the sky, gradually approaching the Black Totem Snake. His hands fired a spiraling bolt of frost.

The frost landed on the Black Totem Snake. His scales were covered in a layer of frost, and it continued to spread.

Mo Fan was standing on the Black Totem Snake’s head and was aware of the rapidly-spreading frost. However, the Black Totem Snake seemed unaffected by it. The Black Totem Snake twisted his body and headed down the mountain.

The frost was still spreading, but as soon as the Black Totem Snake started moving, it began to fall off on its own. Compared to the Black Totem Snake’s size, the cold of the frost was like a popsicle to a normal human!

Shawshank could feel the rage exploding in his chest after seeing that the creature had totally ignored his Ice Magic!

There was no way he was going to let the snake escape with his daughter’s murderer!

“Song Qiming, you are out of your mind!” the Hall Master of the Hall of Knights, Haylon snapped.

“What does it have anything to do with me?” Song Qiming furrowed in confusion.

“Of course it has everything to do with you! Are you telling me that Mo Fan, who’s only an Advanced Mage can control a Totem Beast? Is the Enforcement Union challenging our authority too!?” Haylon said.

“Haylon, you’ve really overestimated me. To be frank, even I can’t control the Totem Beast. Mo Fan saved the Black Totem Snake’s life before. The Totem Beast willingly came to protect him to repay his kindness. If you want to pressure me just so I will withdraw the snake, I’m afraid I can’t really do that. We didn’t expect it to show up, either! Doesn’t your Parthenon Temple have a lot of experts? Can you please subdue the Totem Beast for us? The Black Totem Snake wouldn’t endanger the lives of humans, but it’s too enormous. It won’t be good if it ends up destroying the flowers and scaring the people of your city,” Old Bao replied very seriously.

Haylon and Dulanc almost vomited blood after hearing Song Qiming’s explanation.

The matter would seriously escalate now that China’s Totem Beast had shown up in the Parthenon Temple!

“Dulanc, ask the Holy Court Mages to attack now. Otherwise, we won’t be able to subdue the Totem Beast!” Haylon said.

“You all, follow Haylon’s orders. The Holy Judgment Court will totally lose its reputation if someone manages to snatch Salan away from us!” Dulanc blushed with rage.

The Parthenon Temple was known for its outstanding defenses, but a single Mo Fan had managed to stir great chaos in their territory. Not only had he overcome the Challenge of the Starry Mountain Path, he had also rescued the prisoner in the Saintess’ Hall right in front of them. To make it worse, the Black Totem Snake easily took down the defenses of the Parthenon Temple, which they all thought was unbreakable.

Dulanc was struggling to understand why a creature of such level was willing to obey the orders of a human. Even he was jealous of Mo Fan!

“Stop it, stop it now!” Haylon quickly gathered ten Golden Sun Mages. They rose into the sky to set up a strong magic formation.

“Lightning Punishment Formation: Oblivion!”

Haylon flew into the sky as lightning strikes fell rapidly. The Hall Master had drawn a spectacular Lightning Star Palace, giving him control of the lightning!

Sixteen enormous lightning birds came down from the clouds, bringing powerful lightning with them. They swiftly surrounded the Black Totem Snake.

The lightning birds spread their wings. As they approached the Black Totem Snake, they rapidly disintegrated and established a giant Lightning Punishment Formation around the Black Totem Snake. The entire sky was filled with an overwhelming energy!

Both Mo Fan and Xinxia sensed the terrifying magic. Even hiding inside the hollow on the Black Totem Snake, it felt like the apocalypse.

Haylon, the Hall Master of the Hall of Knights...

Mo Fan had seen quite a few Super Mages, but the Lightning Spell that Haylon had cast was surely the strongest. It was a lot stronger than Zhu Meng’s Lightning Punishment Formation, the Seal of Nine Laws!

The Black Totem Snake had been tortured by the powerful Lightning spell in West Lake!

The Black Totem Snake let out a cry, as if he was enraged by the Lightning spell. This time, he was not weakened by his ecdysis!
