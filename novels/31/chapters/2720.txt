While the young women took their time bandaging their wounds and treating their injuries, Mo Fan patrolled their surroundings,

He was sure that the creature he had sensed wasn’t Royal Pattern Wolf. There had been something else. He could tell the difference between his own beast and other creatures.

Sea Anemone Dandelions had fled because they had sensed Royal Pattern Wolf. The predator which slaughtered Copper-horned Yak had run away as well. It knew Mo Fan had been waiting for it. It hid its aura and used the Sea Anemone Dandelions to test the group’s strength. Mo Fan had refused to make any kind of move because he did not want to alert it.

But Royal Pattern Wolf had appeared right at that moment and scared everything away. That predator had run away too. MO Fan was unhappy because he was unable to avenge Copper-horned Yak.

Mo Fan assured himself that his Darkness Seal could last a very long time. As long as the creature lived around here, he definitely would get a chance to catch it.

‘You killed my yak! I’ll roast you alive!’ vowed Mo Fan. ‘I challenge you to kill my wolf if you are so powerful!’

“Howl!” The Royal Pattern wolf howled. It knew that Mo Fan had lost the yak he had summoned. It lamented its misfortune at what Mo Fan would make it do.

Mo Fan glared at it. Both of them were dimensional beasts. So, why had the Copper-horned Yak experienced such a tragedy? Copper-horned Yak wasn’t really weak.

“Did you run into that creature before?” Mo Fan asked the Royal Pattern Wolf.

Mo Fan was then told that it had bumped into a strong opponent while it was hunting. After a brief spar, they went in separate ways.

The Royal Pattern Wolf communicated with him then that it had sensed the predator’s aura. The predator had been lying in wait to ambush Mo Fan and his group. So Old Wolf had rushed to their rescue.

“Are you stupid?” asked Mo Fan. “If that creature even dares to show itself, I can kill it myself. You ruined my plan! Do you really think I would need to be rescued?”

Mo Fan raged. His current level of power was so high that he could kill several ruler-level demons with a snap of his fingers.

Mo Fan had deliberately held back even though some of the young women were severely wounded. He waited for the creature to show itself because it would pose all of them even more danger than anything else in the reeds. He had also wanted to avenge the Copper-horned Yak.

The predator must be killed. If it was capable of killing the Copper-horned Yak, Mo Fan couldn’t let his guard down. It could easily slaughter them all.

Mo Fan could not use his dragon sense around the clock. It would exhaust his mental ability.

Many creatures on the coast had evolved into hybrids. As a result, these creatures were more skillful in concealing and disguising themselves. Mo Fan believed it was time to improve his own spiritual realm. Otherwise, he might not really be able to detect them no matter how much he increased his dragon sense.

If he wanted to improve his spiritual realm, he could no longer neglect the other elements.

“My mental state is currently in the seventh realm under the impetus of the darkness source.That night during the advancement of my summoning element, it was clear that my spiritual realm had improved slightly. If my Chaos and Earth elements reach Super Level, I can achieve the eighth realm. If I use my dragon sense along with it, then it will easily reach the ninth realm,” Mo Fan muttered to himself.

‘With a ninth realm dragon sense, nothing can hide from me!’ Mo Fan thought.

This was how Mages worked things around to be more efficient. Unless they possessed Psychic and Sound elements, it would be very difficult to sense the movements in their surroundings to detect creatures lying in ambush.

Mo Fan disliked being passive and helpless. He did not like waiting for the creature to make its move. With a ninth realm dragon sense, he was confident that he could see through most of the ruler-level creatures’ concealment ability!

A ninth realm dragon sense was not limited to sensing things only. If Mo Fan achieved the ninth realm, his Chaos, Space and Summoning elements would become powerful, too.

Cultivation was not the only important aspect of dimensional magic; the spiritual realm played a very predominant role as well.The ninth realm was the strongest realm in dimensional magic. Reaching it meant that one possessed the Great Heaven Seed Elemental element. If anyone continued strengthening their spiritual cultivation, they could also complete their dimensional cultivation.

...

“The Mingwu Ancient City is right in front of us. Did you see the ancient green wall?” Big Sister Ruan said happily as she pointed at the building before them.

Mo Fan went up to it and saw that the green wall was covered with lush vines and moss. If he wasn’t looking carefully, he would have been unable to tell that bulging plants and vines covered the ancient green wall.

The green wall was not very tall. The city’s entrance was covered in green spider webs. It looked like a cave. It was hard to believe that this city used to be an ancient city of scenic beauty and powerful people.

Fist-sized spiders crawled on the webs. When it saw the people approach, it hid within the vines. The spiders observed them through the cracks in the veins with their blood-red eyes.

“The spider webs have sealed the entrance. Does this mean no one else has visited here for a long time?” asked Le Nan.

“Maybe or may not be. Some spiders produce webs so rapidly in a small period of time. The webs could have been woven after someone went through. Some spiders can weave many webs to cover an entire entrance in half an hour,” said Mo Fan. “There are some traces of burned plants over there. Maybe other hunters are ahead of us.”

“Let’s go then. They might get it before we do,” said Big Sister Ying hurriedly.

Mo Fan was surprised and curious. “Is there something very important inside?”

“This is something related to Licheng Afterglow Island. We cannot really talk about it. I hope you understand,” said Big Sister Ruan.

“That’s alright. I am not looking to pry, after all. But I think I should mention that when I first arrived here, I experienced a bizarre phenomenon. I saw a purple lightning strike from the sky and hit the ground,” said Mo Fan honestly. “It was terrifying, to say the least. I don’t think even ruler-level creatures would survive a direct strike of lightning like that. Could I ask if the lightning is related to the Mingwu Ancient City in any way?”

He had come to find the totem. Jiang Shaoxu had told him about the bizarre lightning storm and the legend.

Mo Fan vividly remembered that the area where the lightning had struck hadn’t been the center. There was even thicker and harsher lightning in Mingwu Ancient City.

“There are several explanations for this. Mr. Mo Fan,” said Big Sister Ruan as she led the way to the road. “This way, please.” She seemed very familiar with the place.

After they entered through the city entrance, they saw even more of the vines. They were growing wildly everywhere. As they walked closer, they realized that these heaps of vines covered small houses.

The houses were almost entirely covered with vines and ivy. The streets were overgrown with bushes. The place had changed entirely.

“My grandma lived in the ancient city. When I was young, I often came to the city. I seldom wore shoes. I used to run around barefoot,” Big Sister Ruan said to Le Nan softly.
