Mo Fan was given a great scare by the incredible power of the magic formation, and he subconsciously took a few steps back. The black mountain opposite the one he was standing on was brightly lit, especially the East Guardian Tower at the peak. The gray-white walls were shrouded by the yellow light of death. It was like the whole building would be turned into scattered ashes and dispersed smoke in any second.

“Is...is this some kind of daily routine too?” Mo Fan looked at Xiao Zhe beside him with a stunned expression.

Xiao Zhe too was dumbfounded. He was about to answer when someone’s voice, talking in Japanese, came from the drawbridge.

Judging from the voice, the guards in the East Guardian Tower were in a panic. They were yelling at the West Guardian Tower.

It turned out that most of the guards were moved to the south because of the strange incident of the sea creature. The East Guardian Tower did not have as many guards as it should have.

“You should go back to the middle floor at once. I must go sound the alarm,” Xiao Zhe immediately headed for the guard tower after hearing the shout.

Xiao Zhe had already run into the distance before Mo Fan could ask any questions. He was left alone on one end of the drawbridge.

Glancing at the lightning bolts dancing wildly on the other mountain, Mo Fan immediately felt a great urge to check the situation out.

“No one is bringing me, so it’s easy for me to lose my way, so I should go to the other side to ask for directions. Mm, sounds about right...” Mo Fan mumbled to himself before slowing heading to the other side across the drawbridge.

Zhao Manyan’s long-lost brother had mentioned that the magic formation would only target those trying to trespass into the area. It would not pose any threat to Mo Fan as long as he was standing on the drawbridge.

Mo Fan slowly stepped forward on the drawbridge. He realized that he was standing above the abyss between the two mountains. He walked to the edge and peeked down. The strong snapping glare of the formation was lighting the place up. However, he could only see the cliffs of the mountains, not the bottom of the abyss.

Half of the drawbridge was out of range of the magic formation. Mo Fan had traveled a third of the way across. He could see the yellow lightning bolts dancing wildly in the sky by glancing up. There were a dozen lightning bolts close to the drawbridge, in addition to the number surrounding the East Guardian Tower. There were simply too many. Mo Fan firmly believed that his tiny body would be torn into pieces within half a second if he was tossed into the air!

“What are these Japanese up to?” Mo Fan frowned. He glanced across the drawbridge.

Amid the lightning flashes, Mo Fan vaguely saw a few Magicians in uniform running towards him. They seemed to be in a pinch...

Before they could reach the middle of the drawbridge, several demonic branches appeared from below the bridge and quickly wrapped around the Magicians.

Before Mo Fan could react, the guards were flung away from the drawbridge.

The area away from the drawbridge was completely covered by the magic formation. Mo Fan immediately saw the three guards being shredded into ashes by the lightning bolts!

Mo Fan was stunned by the scene. It took him a few seconds to recover.

“Mo Fan, what are you doing here!” Mochizuki Ken’s loud voice came from behind him.

Mo Fan was terrified. He immediately went back to the other side.

“I told you not to go anywhere else!” snapped Mochizuki Ken furiously.

“I just saw...” argued Mo Fan.

“We’ll handle the situation ourselves. You will return to your room at once. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind punishing you according to our rules here!” said Mochizuki Ken.

“I saw a few guards being killed...”

“Whatever you saw was none of your business; Xiao Zhe, bring him away!” said Mochizuki Ken with a firm voice.

Xiao Zhe immediately walked up to Mo Fan with a dark expression.

Mo Fan had no idea what to say. He had no choice but to leave the drawbridge.

——

“Can you stop going to places you’re not supposed to? The upper floor is already off-limits to you, the drawbridge and the East Guardian Tower are prohibited areas too! Luckily, it was Mr. Mochizuki who found you. He has always been kind to everyone. If it was Commander Takagi, he wouldn’t let you go so easily,” said Xiao Zhe cautiously.

The lightning bolts finally disappeared after they arrived on the middle floor. Mo Fan was still full of questions. He immediately asked Xiao Zhe, “I saw demon branches tossing a few guards off the bridge, killing them instantly!”

“Nonsense, Mochizuki Chihaya is the only Advanced Plant Magician in both the West and East Guardian Towers. You must have seen it wrong!” said Xiao Zhe angrily.

“Why are you panicking? I never said it was Mochizuki Chihaya,” complained Mo Fan.

“How am I panicking? I just think that you shouldn’t slander Miss Chihaya like that. Don’t say anything like that again, especially not in front of Commander Takagi!” said Xiao Zhe hurriedly.

“Do you have feelings for Mochizuki Chihaya?” wondered Mo Fan.

“Of...of course not, what the heck are you saying!” Xiao Zhe started to panic again. He even blushed.

“Oh, maybe I did see it wrong. The light of the magic formation is very bright after all. By the way, is that Mochizuki Chihaya’s room? I believe we had some misunderstandings before. However, she was still willing to put her grudge aside to give me some advice, I would like to apologize to her tomorrow,” said Mo Fan.

Xiao Zhe immediately answered as if he was trying to cover something up, “Yeah, her room is at the end of the corridor. Miss Chihaya is a very nice person, she’s the most loyal to the West Guardian Tower...”

“Mm, I’ll be fine, I’m heading back to sleep,” Mo Fan went into his room and locked the door behind him.

Xiao Zhe was a responsible soldier too. He decided to stand in front of Mo Fan’s door, just so the man would not run away again.

Inside the room, Mo Fan found himself amused by Xiao Zhe’s reaction.

He opened the window and sneaked out of the room in a lump of shadow. He easily made his way down the corridor without attracting Xiao Zhe’s attention.

Mo Fan moved sneakily in the dark. He flowed over a fake hill just a second ago before he appeared in the corridor he walked past before, where Mochizuki Chihaya’s room was.

Mo Fan was smacked around by Mochizuki Chihaya’s demon branches after dinner. He was confident that the demon branches that tossed the guards into the air were extremely similar to those that Mochizuki Chihaya had summoned! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

If Mochizuki Chihaya was from the West Guardian Tower, there was no reason she would kill the guards. It was shocking how three human lives were erased from the world just like that, yet everyone was reacting oddly, as if the secret in the East Guardian Tower was more important than the deaths of the guards!
