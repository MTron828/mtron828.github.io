1653 Did the People That Are Supposed to Be Dead Die Yet?

Translated by XephiZ

“Elder Ferran...” Bartholomew noticed that something was not right. Two powerful Mages had restricted his movements!

Ferran could not care less about Bartholomew now. He was just an evil minor character. It was time to get rid of him after he had done his job. Even if Su Lu had not intervened, Ferran would have eventually found someone to take Bartholomew out secretly to preserve his reputation!

“President Su Lu, I really had no idea about it in the first place. It’s my fault for not controlling my men. I didn’t think they would go to such extremes just to fulfill their duties. I will take care of Eisenberg, who colluded with Bartholomew, too. They shall pay for their crimes!” Ferran declared.

The man in the hat began to panic too!

The man was still acting arrogantly when he was guiding Mo Fan and the others here, as if there was nothing Mo Fan and his crew could do to him, even if they knew what he had done.

To his surprise, his superior Ferran betrayed him right away when Master Su Lu was involved. His face turned extremely pale.

Ferran had no idea what was going on?

How could he not know what happened? If he hadn’t made the arrangements, how were they able to trick the government and the Magic Associations to hide their crimes?

“Elder Ferran, you can’t do this! There’s only a limited number of Tyrant Titans left in the world! There’s no way we could collect the number of Tyrant Titans’ hearts you asked for. I never stopped searching for an alternative solution. I was merely taking orders from you! In the beginning, I only asked Bartholomew to look for the kids that had passed away in the hospitals, but he went on to kidnap children to speed up the progress. Wasn’t everything just to make sure we have enough Tyrant Titans’ hearts?” Eisenburg protested.

“How amusing! It’s true that you didn’t specially ask me to do it, but you’re telling me you have no clue where the hearts were from when I delivered them to you?” Bartholomew laughed hollowly.

Bartholomew had done many evil deeds on behalf of the corrupted governments of some countries. He also worked with a lot of proper organizations, too! Otherwise, how had he managed to stay alive until now?

However, Bartholomew did not expect Su Lu to treat Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue so seriously. The man did not hesitate to take him out!

The reason why their Guild of the Wicked existed and was able to grow so quickly was that the governments of many countries needed people like them to do their inconvenient deeds, such as collecting the hearts of children!

The world only had a limited number of Tyrant Titans. They could only collect two-thirds of their requirements even if they killed every Tyrant Titan in the world! The children’s hearts were the only way to replace the missing hearts!

The upright organizations or government would never do such things on their own, yet they desperately needed them. Therefore, at a tea party, these people would hint that they would not collect the children’s hearts, they would never do such a deranged act. Only people like Bartholomew would do so!

It was their usual style. The people who failed to read between the lines would assume the authorities were holding fast to their principles. Some others might get the message, but they did not have the guts or cruelty needed for the job. As for Bartholomew, not only did he get the message, he was cruel enough to carry out the deeds! It had helped him become a Super Mage and turned him into an evil mercenary working for governments. It was how he had remained at large despite the crimes he had committed!

In terms of doing outrageous acts, Bartholomew could swear with his soul that the things he did were nothing compared to what Ferran had done. Otherwise, how had the man become an elder of the Magic Association?

As for Su Lu, who was even higher than Ferran...

Bartholomew had never had a chance to come into contact with someone on the same level as Su Lu. When he knew he was doing Su Lu a favor, he was even more reckless, hoping that he could get into the good graces of Su Lu. Not only would he remain unfettered, he might have a chance to be appointed as an authority of some proper organization!

He was only doing such outrageous acts for the benefits and gains. No one else who wasn’t mentally deranged would be willing to get their hands dirty. Bartholomew was hoping to whitewash himself and gain a similar role to Ferran, getting all the respect while others were handling the dirty acts behind the scenes. He would no longer have to be worried or scared!

Bartholomew had believed only someone like Su Lu could whitewash him!

It was not like Bartholomew had never thought of the current outcome as a possibility. It was just how things might go when he was helping someone like Ferran. It was a gamble, he was betting on the possibility that Su Lu was just like Ferran, who needed someone like Bartholomew to handle the evil deeds on his behalf!

As a matter of fact, Bartholomew strongly believed Su Lu was just like Ferran, with even greater power. Whenever anyone dared to pose a threat to him, if they were a crook like Bartholomew, he would get rid of them righteously to serve justice. If it was a righteous person, he would take care of them behind the scenes to guarantee himself a clear path!

Bartholomew stared at Mo Fan and said furiously, “Kid, don’t you feel too good about yourself. Even if you took me out, you still offended someone terrifying. You are going to die a worse death than me one day!”

If it wasn’t for Mo Fan and his crew showing up out of nowhere, he would have easily become Su Lu’s subordinate and used the position to do many things else. Therefore, he insisted on blaming Mo Fan! This busybody who naively thought he could be the light of the world was the reason for his fall!

Mo Fan ignored Bartholomew’s ‘kind’ reminder. He felt like he would humiliate himself if he bothered talking to the prick.

“I’ll punish them myself!” Ferran proclaimed, suddenly making his move.

He used Poison Magic, placing his left and right hands on Bartholomew and Eisenburg respectively. The poison lunged forward like a snake and plunged into their bodies.

The poison spread crazily fast. Their veins turned an odd purple, followed by their skin, looking like it was soaked in some dye.

Even their pupils had turned purple. Their veins were filled with poison, and on the verge of exploding!

Eisenburg could not accept his fate. He tried to break free, but his body was restrained by two other Mages. He did not stand a chance against a powerful Poison Mage like Ferran!

Their bodies began to corrode, leaving only their skin and hair behind. Both men soon turned into bubbling puddles, only their hair and scalps left behind on the surface. It looked utterly disgusting!

“Some people keep abusing the name of the Magic Associations to commit their outrageous crimes. They naively thought people weren’t going to find out the truth, but I must say, there’s no running away from justice. Those people will pay for their crimes eventually. Bartholomew and Eisenburg are the perfect examples... Ah yes, I should thank these young Mages for exposing them. I thank you on behalf of the Asia Continent Magic Association!” Ferran put on a righteous act after taking out his own men.

Mo Fan found his words more disgusting than the puddle on the ground!

“Of course, I must bear the blame too. I will visit the families of the victims in person to comfort them. I will let them know that I’ve punished the people responsible for their children’s deaths... President Su, are you satisfied with the outcome? If there’s anything else you want me to do, I’m willing to bear the responsibility!,” Ferran inquired somberly.

Ferran had taken the initiative to deal with his men. It was his typical way of abandoning his pawns to protect himself. Everyone was watching him coldly, yet they did not bother exposing him.

“Are you satisfied with the outcome?” Su Lu looked at Mo Fan and the others and asked.

Mo Fan could not believe how ridiculous that sounded.

Are you satisfied with the outcome?

Was it any different from a rapist asking the victim if the position he was using was comfortable for her?

“Give us the children’s hearts!” Mu Ningxue knew it was meaningless to discuss the topic any further.

Was getting rid of Bartholomew and Eisenburg going to make any difference?

There were demands for animal hides, so the hunters went hunting the animals. The hunters were caught in the end, but what about the people asking for the hides?

Why did the truth always have to be like this? It felt like punishing Bartholomew for his crimes of murdering the children brutally was not really that important after learning the truth!

“The hearts are already a part of the Ritual. The dragons and the Titans are the nemeses of one another. We can activate the poison in the Titan’s hearts with the primitive power of the ancient Totem Beasts. When the dragon breathes in the poison, its lungs will be contaminated, preventing it from spitting out its breath. Their breath is a dragon’s deadliest weapon,” Ferran explained on behalf of Su Lu.

So that was the reason behind everything?

They were trying to nullify the dragon’s breath so it was possible for them to defeat the dragon! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Mu Ningxue’s heart was as cold as ice when she heard the words. She recalled the families grieving for their lost children, and the child they had buried with their own hands. The grudge and anger inside her were replaced with fatigue and a heavy weariness for the world. Even the air she was breathing in felt disgusting to her.

“It seems like you are not satisfied yet,” Su Lu noticed.

“Master Su Lu, we’ve been preparing for many years. Let’s worry about them after we are done with the dragon, if they aren’t satisfied then...” an old Mage of the Europe Continent Magic Association proposed.

“Yeah, we should focus on the dragon for now. It’s about to show up.”

Su Lu looked at Mu Ningxue and Mo Fan and waited for their response.

“You can go ahead with your Ritual. Sorry for the inconvenience we have caused,” Mu Ningxue said, turning around. She had enough of this.

Mu Ningxue naturally had an icy bearing, yet her aura was even icier and lifeless as she turned around.

Mo Fan felt the same way after seeing Mu Ningxue’s reaction.

Their hatred was surging like waves, yet it was stuck in their throats like a fishbone!

Their wrath was enough to set the sky aflame, but they were disheartened after seeing these people’s attitudes!

Why was this happening? Perhaps those that were supposed to die were still laughing at them!...
