“The Undead are stirring up chaos around the Ancient Capital; the rescue team which Zhang Xiaohou was a part of has been lost!”

Lost!

The words stabbed Mo Fan’s heart like a cold sword, even his blood stopped flowing.

The chill penetrated his soul, sending him falling into the world of great despair, which he could not free himself from!

Mo Fan stood blankly in place. The voice of the referee’s countdown echoed around his ears, yet it felt like he could not hear anything. His mind was filled with the painful words.

Zhang Xiaohou is dead?

Is he really dead?

Didn’t that jerk tell me that with the Wind Element and Earth Element, even if everyone in the team was dead, he would still be alive?

—

The place was covered in the same loud cheering. Even before the match started, their anticipation towards the spectacular showdown between the experts was enough for their blood to boil. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Everyone had their own views of the possible outcome, and were trying to convince the others with facts.

However, even as everyone was looking forward to seeing the epic battle between the top students in Pearl Institute, someone’s mind had already gone blank.

Bai Yulang soon discovered that something was not right. He quickly said to the main referee of the match, “Referee, wait...”

“What is it?” the referee asked sternly.

“Humph, trying to run away? I’ve been waiting a long time for this day!” said Dongfang Lie with a cold grin.

The truth was, anyone could tell that something was not right. The participants were supposed to be standing in their positions on the stage, yet Mo Fan was still at the edge staring at his phone, his grip on it loosening.

“Since the countdown has already started, there’s nothing else to be said. Fight!” said Zhou Shuming.

Zhou Shuming had no personal grudge against Mo Fan, yet the girl he was fond of was living in the same apartment with him. Even though she was only his housemate, who would know what their relationship actually was, since they were spending lots of time together?

It was not like Zhou Shuming had not tried to warn Mo Fan, yet the Demon King had never treated the school tyrant Zhou Shuming seriously.

Meanwhile, Dongfang Lie was not interested in fighting over girls. He was more troubled over why the others had to compete fiercely for just one vote when this guy already had three votes in his hand. How was he worthy?

The referee had already declared the match was going to begin. If they were able to officially defeat this person, who was a provisional candidate, he, Dongfang Lie, would also be worthy to represent the national team...

Besides, against a guy like Mo Fan, he could simply crush him with a punch!

“Trying to put up an act? Even if you’re planning to forfeit the match, I won’t let you go without eating my fist!” Dongfang Lie had long looked forward to this day!

His fist instantly erupted in blazing flames. The overwhelming heat spread a meter away into his surroundings.

Unreasonable!

Dongfang Lie did not care if his opponents were not ready. Since they were already on the stage, and the referee had declared the start, he was simply going to vent all his accumulated anger during this match! He was going to let everyone know that the so-called provisional candidate was no match for him!

The Star Pattern turned into a burning formation under Dongfang Lie’s feet. Raging flames rose from the ground, making him look unstoppable!

“Damn it, didn’t I tell you to wait?” snapped Bai Yulang furiously.

“Don’t stand in the way, it’s between him and me!” Dongfang Lie completely ignored Bai Yulang’s existence. His eyes were fixed on Mo Fan.

“Asshole, what are you doing!?” yelled Bai Yulang furiously.

Dongfang Lie was completely out of his mind. Mo Fan was obviously not in the mood to fight because something had happened, yet this ass was still trying to attack him! If Mo Fan did not put on his armor in time, it was likely that he would be burned to ashes before he recovered from the shock!

This Dongfang Lie was not simply holding a grudge against him. He was trying to kill the guy!

Even Zhou Shuming was shocked by the sight. He did throw oil onto the flames to provoke Dongfang Lie, yet he had no idea the guy’s hatred toward Mo Fan was so strong. Could it be that one of the votes that Mo Fan had was supposed to be his?

Zhou Shuming’s speculation was on point. Councilman Zhu Meng used to be in charge of the Enforcement Union, hence the Dongfang Family, which was mainly active in Hangzhou, was fairly close to Zhu Meng. Initially, his vote was supposed to go to Dongfang Lie!

Zhou Shuming’s thoughts were fairly simple. He had been trying to provoke Dongfang Lie to teach Mo Fan a lesson on his behalf.

Little did he know that, even without his provocation, Dongfang Lie would not forgive Mo Fan, either!

Dongfang Lie’s flames rolled fiercely. His innate talent made his Fiery Fist much stronger then an ordinary Fiery Fist. As soon as his punch was thrown, everyone could immediately see the nine fiery dragons coiling around the nine pillars rising from the ground!

The nine dragons separated from the pillars and flew across the stage, intertwining with one another. The raging flames unleashed from them were so powerful that the stage, which was larger than a football field, was shaking vigorously.

Fourth-tier Fiery Fist!

Normally, the nine fiery pillars would appear in fixed locations, but the fourth-tier Fiery Fist turned the pillars into flame dragons, which swept forward like a shockwave. It easily devoured half of the dueling ground, raging in Mo Fan’s direction.

“Mo Fan!”

“Mo Fan!”

“Dodge it!”

Ai Tutu, Mu Nujiao and Zhao Manyan rose to their feet and yelled out in shock.

What was Mo Fan doing? The flames were about to crush him!

The little Flame Belle was still on Mo Fan’s shoulder. She cried out in panic in Mo Fan’s ears as the danger approached.

Mo Fan’s gaze was blank, yet it did not mean that he was completely unaware of what was happening around him.

He knew that the referee had started the match. He heard Bai Yulang calling for a timeout. He also sensed the hatred inDongfang Lie’s attack, and the feeling of death approaching him.

He seemed lost in his thoughts because he could not accept the truth, but more importantly, he was no longer in the mood to conceal his strength against his opponents!

“Piss off, will ya!”

Blue veins surfaced on his face as he uttered a thunderous roar, venting the anger from the bad news.

The little Flame Belle immediately acknowledged Mo Fan’s intentions, flowing into Mo Fan’s body to possess him!

The flames spread wildly, as if countless fiery demons were resting on his body. The power of the Rose Flame was on full display in Mo Fan’s flames, bearing a stronger presence than Dongfang Lie’s fires!
