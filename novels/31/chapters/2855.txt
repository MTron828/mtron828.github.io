Mo Fan grabbed Zhao Manyan’s phone and watched the video clip that had circulated on the internet.

In the video, he saw the mythical phenomenon that spanned all over the country. The majestic Ancient Great Walls of thousand meters broke free from their original place on the mountains and soared into the sky. They floated above the land, just like Beiguan Tower!

“Mo Fan, fly to the space above the sky and take a look from there!” Lingling shouted.

“Okay. But even if I reach the space above the sky, I doubt I’ll see the reappearance of the mythical phenomena,” said Mo Fan.

“We may have succeeded, but how do we transfer them from here?” Lingling was engrossed in her thoughts one moment and excited the next.

“This is an ancient spell. I can sense the aura of a Forbidden Curse.” Dean Xiao stared at the sections of the floating great walls.

The majestic Great Walls floated at the same height. After they broke free of the land, they flew to the sky and hovered there. They cast enormous shadows on the land below. The people on Earth were so awed that they started worshiping them.

…

Mo Fan flew into the sky. He looked down and saw the central plains of China. The area within his sight was limited because China was just too big.

Mo Fan paid close attention to the segments that came from various important cities. He was shocked to find that the Great Walls floating in the sky were not just the existing Great Walls, but also many other ruins of the Great Walls that had not been recorded in the present era.

The ruins were buried underground in the past. Their fragments had blended into the soil, but the blue rain had summoned them into the air.

The Ancient Capital was at the top of the wall. Countless rubble, soil, stones, and rocks coiled up in the sky above the capital. They formed a gigantic skull with two horns. The skull was completely made up of soil and stones. It stood with an air of divinity in the middle of the sky.

The segments of the Ancient Great Walls from other areas were composed of beacon towers, stone towers, and walls. But, when Mo Fan looked down from the space above the sky, the segments connected and formed a long body that covered the central plains of China!

He looked further to the east and saw a tail.

The tail resembled a snake’s tail. It looked very similar to that of the Black Totem Snake!

As the Ancient Great Walls connected to one another, he noticed the horns of the Divine Deer, the face of the White Tiger, the body of the Black Snake, and the claws of the Green East Sea God…

‘No! This was not the Black Totem Snake. This was the Great Serpent on the Cloud! This was the sacred totem beast!’

Buzz!

Mo Fan was astounded when he was greeted by such a phenomenon. The pendant on his chest vibrated.

Usually, Little Loach remained as a black creature with no luster. It would only glow slightly when it advanced to the next level.

At that moment though, Little Loach turned dark green. It floated before Mo Fan and slowly uncoiled itself.

It was the Ancient Great Walls’ companion vessel. It was the symbol of the sacred totem Azure Dragon. It was a part of the sacred totem beast.

Mo Fan’s eyes were teary.

“You’re the one they speak of, right?” Mo Fan asked while staring at the floating Little Loach before him. “The Underground Holy Spring and the sleeping Ancient Capital have been waiting for you instead of me.”

Little Loach did not answer him. It could not answer him, after all.

“This is the reason why I can absorb the totem beast’s power.” Mo Fan marveled at this fact.

There were signs everywhere. All of the answers had been right in front of him. Still, he had to take one step at a time in this arduous journey to find the totem beasts.

Mo Fan finally understood everything. The reason Little Loach accompanied him was because Mo Fan was the one destined to complete and protect it. Everyone could own Little Loach, but not everyone could awaken it.

“Since you’re awake, let’s go to the Magic City now!” said Mo Fan to Little Loach.

This time, Little Loach did not return to Mo Fan’s chest. It broke free of the necklace and slowly implanted itself on his forehead.

Little Loach gradually fused with Mo Fan and formed a visible dark green seal. The seal was the scar of the sacred totem beast. It glowed as bright as the sun or the moon. Mo Fan stood suspended in the sky like a God. He glowed in green with splendor.

Green light spread on the lands of China and rested on the segments of the spectacular and divine Ancient Great Walls.

Boom!

The floating pieces began to move. They rolled up like monstrous waves and sailed like an enormous ship towards Mo Fan.

The horns and skull were of the Ancient Capital. The body and torso were of the Yan Men City. And its tail was of the Emperor Qin’s Island.

…

The Ancient Great Walls gathered together and gradually formed a gigantic green dragon. The green dragon floated in the endless Milky Way across the universe.

The Ancient Great Walls that had risen from the ground to stop Khufu’s Undead army in the past had been just a part of the green dragon’s chest.

The historic city walls and buildings from the Ancient Capital as well as the debris and tombs buried underground across the lands were the green dragon’s flesh and blood.

The unknown ruins were buried under the vast land of China. After the ruins were summoned, they flew to midair and fused to make the green dragon’s muscles and scales.

The giant shadow of Yan Men City was one of the green dragon’s claws.

The majestic long walls of the Imperial City formed the green dragon’s bones!

Si Matai, Green Mountain City, Arrow Buckle Great Wall, Tiger Mountain, and Jiu Meng Gate from the east eventually formed a part of the green dragon and joined with the Emperor Qin Island’s segment.

Mo Fan felt shocked and awed at the sight before him. Mo Fan had navigated the country’s great rivers and mountains. He had set foot in numerous famous historical sites. He had either stood guard or explored these places. He had been to many places overseas such as Egypt, Arabia, Italy, and Greece. These places had their own ancient civilizations with great national beasts recorded in their literature.

Mo Fan used to wonder what China’s national beast would be like. And he finally had the answer to that question.

This was China’s national beast!

It had been sleeping in various places and mountains. It had been guarding China’s great lands. It was the country’s true national beast—Azure Dragon!

Roar!

The Azure Dragon’s roar echoed like thunderbolts. Its roars transmitted from the western land to the eastern coast. Its roars sent shock waves across the lands.

He saw green lightning in the sky. The lightning covered the space above the sky and gradually spread all around. For a moment, people from every province witnessed the miracle.

The Azure Dragon was far in the space above the sky. Even so, people on Earth saw its magnificent body. After all, it was made up of the Ancient Great Walls.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan stood on the Azure Dragon’s horn. He turned around and saw the Azure Dragon’s seemingly endless body in the vast blue sky.

Faith and hope sprouted in his heart. Mo Fan said to the awakened National Beast, “Let’s go to the Magic City!”
