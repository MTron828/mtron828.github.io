Chapter 2166: It’s Because I am Strong Enough

Translated by XephiZ

For some reason, Mo Fan knew the godfather of the Black Ornaments was going to show up.

Perhaps he was familiar with how these maniacs thought after having dealt with the Black Vatican for far too long.

Committing such detestable acts and concealing them meant he was not willing to become a fugitive.

The culprit must have had a twisted personality if he had dared to destroy the entire Green Sprouts Island over such a small matter. If Mo Fan let Babbitt go, the godfather would learn there was someone even more reckless than him in the world!

It was just a mind game. Mo Fan wanted Babbitt to tell the godfather that he was waiting for him. He was giving him a chance to get rid of the evidence and witnesses. Mo Fan was challenging the godfather to kill him if he was so confident in himself!

In the end, the guy showed up, as he had expected!

It was obvious that the godfather of the Black Ornaments was not an idiot. He had asked his men to check the area thoroughly. He might even have used his influence to see what the Parthenon Temple, the government, and the military were up to, and made sure the truth behind the incident of Green Sprouts Island remained hidden. He had only showed up after he was sure that it was not a trap.

“To be honest, it’s been a while since I last met someone who was asking to die so desperately. The fact that you’ve killed a few of my useless men doesn’t mean you are worthy enough to provoke the Godfather of the Black Ornaments. Young man, you have made a terrible decision. That being said, I’m quite curious about the reason why you are doing this,” the godfather of the Black Church went on.

“Why did you kill the people on Green Sprouts Island?” Mo Fan asked in return.

“It was just an accident. Babbitt is in charge of the merchant’s guild. I heard someone foolish named Mr. Lin wasn’t being respectful enough. It just so happens that my new pet wanted to go for a walk, so I came here in person. However, something interesting happened. The things that Mr. Lin was planting drove my pet into a frenzy. I wasn’t able to stop it, so many people died in the accident, and many others saw what had happened. I thought, since I’m in charge of Crete, I could ask Richard to place Green Sprouts Island in lockdown so my pet could have a little more fun. I also bribed a few officials and settled the matter with ease... everything is just a coincidence, or a misfortune, you could say. Mm, I guess you could describe it as the butterfly effect,” the godfather of the Black Church replied breezily. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A little butterfly in an Amazon rainforest beating its wings could cause a tornado in Texas two weeks later. It was called the butterfly effect.

Babbitt had already spoken the truth. Everything he had said matched the godfather’s confession. The cause of the incident was only an insignificant matter. The greedy Mr. Lin was not willing to obey the Black Ornaments, so the Black Ornaments came to take revenge.

The reason was as simple as that.

However, there were too many coincidences that had escalated the matter into an incident that had shaken the whole of Greece.

“To me, taking care of Mr. Lin or destroying an island is no different, since I can clean up either mess myself. Like now, I can get rid of you all, too... speaking of which, you haven’t told me why you are doing this,” the godfather of the Black Church asked.

“I’m only here because a young man who we met recently is dead. His name was Harper,” Mo Fan answered firmly.

“Harper?” The godfather looked at Babbitt, frowning.

“Someone who worked for Mr. Lin. He was one of the survivors. I sent a few of my men to take care of him, but they ended up catching this guy’s attention,” Babbitt replied hurriedly.

“Just that?” the godfather asked in surprise.

“You can destroy an island and bury the truth with lies because of an insignificant matter. Why can’t I destroy the Black Ornaments because a young man who I was impressed with was killed? To me, killing a member of the Black Ornaments or destroying the entire Black Ornaments are the same. After all, I’m strong enough to do so,” Mo Fan explained airily.

The godfather’s face twitched as Mo Fan finished his sentence. This young man was even more ruthless than him!

“I hope you have the guts to repeat the same words after you’ve seen my pet!” the godfather snarled.

It was a great humiliation that he had been mocked so clearly in front of others. He had destroyed a whole island! Most people of the Black Vatican had never done anything like that, yet the young man was being so arrogant in front of him!

“You two, take care of the others, I’ll handle him myself!” the godfather told his men.

“President, the people of the Parthenon Temple are still around in Crete. Won’t your Demon Titan attract them here?” the vice president of the Black Ornaments mentioned quickly.

“They can’t track my Demon Titan! Tell our men to misdirect them with rumors!” the godfather snarled.

“Sure, I don’t think it’s going to take us a long time to deal with them,” the vice president grinned.

Mo Fan remained unmoving. He was not in a rush to attack.

He wanted them to Summon the culprit first, the Demon Titan with the cross marking!

It was the single most convincing piece of evidence. It was also the only way to uncover the truth behind the incident of Green Sprouts Island!

The Godfather of the Black Church might be arrogant, but he did not think Mo Fan and his group were only some ordinary Mages. They had to be quite strong if they had managed to kill Secretary Richard with such ease.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan was the youngest Super Mage he had ever met. As the leader of the Black Church and the Black Ornaments, he was good at analyzing a person’s personality.

He believed the more talented the young man was, the more arrogant he would be, especially since he had been taking matters into his own hands from the start.

He preferred it this way, since it made it much easier to take care of the trouble!

Whoever was more capable would live in the end. The rest would just follow the scripts they had in mind!

“Aren’t you looking for my Demon Titan? It’s time for you to experience its superiority!” The godfather of the Black Church suddenly stepped forward and clasped his pendant in both hands.

Mo Fan watched the godfather of the Black Church closely. He did not see any presence of magic.

The Summoning was more like evil sorcery, like he was establishing a terrifying pact with a Darkness Creature!

The sea began to shake vigorously, followed by a deafening roar.

An evil light shone upon the fierce waves. The sea began to split in half as a head covered in ghastly runes rose from the gap!
