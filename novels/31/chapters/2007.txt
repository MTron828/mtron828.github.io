Chapter 2008: The Ancient Eagles’ Nest

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

People easily lowered their guards when they were mesmerized by beautiful things. Even Mo Fan, who had been to the Dark Plane, was oddly relaxed when he entered the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. It was a visual pleasure, like a noble goddess wearing a sacred veil was whispering her secrets into his ears. Anyone would open their hearts to her.

Scary?

How was the Scar of Tianshan Mountain scary?

They were actually ashamed of their greedy and wicked thoughts toward the goddess prior to their arrival!

It was quiet. There was not a single cry or screech of demon creatures in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain, as if everything was in a deep sleep. Their footsteps in the kingdom of ice were the loudest noises. They subconsciously softened their voices and were friendlier to one another.

“Damn it, where are we supposed to look for the Night Amethyst in such a huge place? I’m afraid Mu Bai’s body is going to turn cold soon!” Mo Fan was utterly lost as he looked over the Valley of Glaciers ahead. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The women had never seen anything so pure and beautiful, but now the atmosphere was completely ruined by Mo Fan’s exclamation. This was especially true for Mu Ningxue, who was born with the innate traits of an Ice Spirit. She felt an odd sense of belonging when she arrived at this place.

Unfortunately, Mo Fan had little appreciation for nature and its beauty.

“Look at the glaciers and clouds ahead. Why do they feel so artistic? They are full of holes... to be honest, they might be able to cure my trypophobia!” Zhao Manyan blurted out.

Clouds had shrouded the area ahead. The ground was sloping up while the clouds were heading down, a spectacular view of this place that was surrounded by ice.

It was different from the snowy valleys they had visited so far. The Valley of Glaciers was full of ice studded with holes. Most of them were hanging above the clouds, so they looked like beehives from afar.

Senior Hunter Yassen suddenly halted in his tracks. He signaled the others to keep quiet with a gesture.

Everyone was indulging in the scenery. The atmosphere suddenly became tense when Yassen started acting so grimly. They all stood there, not daring to make a single noise, staring ahead while staying on alert.

“I...I think we have arrived at the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ nests,” Yassen told everyone softly.

The Frosty Ancient Eagles’ nests!

Many of those in the group almost screamed. Why would the Frosty Ancient Eagles build their nest in the middle of the path? How were they supposed to keep going forward?

“It should be fine, right? We managed to cross the lake. We should be able to kill them all considering our strength. We can definitely make our way through their nest!” the healer Bertan spoke up.

“You’re too naive!” Lingling blatantly conveyed her disdain of Bertan’s ignorance. “The demon creatures that live together usually split the work, like a den of lions. The lionesses are responsible for hunting prey, while the lions only have to wait for the lionesses to feed them. However, it doesn’t mean the lions are only good at breeding. When the den of the lions is threatened by other species, the lions will step forward and eliminate the threats to protect the den.”

Yassen turned around with a grim face as Lingling was speaking.

“Little girl, are you saying that only the females among the Frosty Ancient Eagles attacked us when we were crossing the lake, but the stronger males were staying in the nest to protect it from invaders?” Yassen asked her.

“Among eagles, the males are usually stronger. Take a look at the ones that are patrolling in the sky. Aren’t they different from the ones we encountered before?” Lingling pointed up at the clouds.

Everyone followed Lingling’s finger and noticed the male eagles that were patrolling had an impressive crest on their heads that was glowing like the sun. Their body structure and wings were obviously stronger than the Frosty Ancient Eagles they had fought against. Even their talons were brimming with power!

“The Frosty Ancient Eagles at the lake are petite compared to them... My gods, do we really have to take this path? Can’t we find another way?” Bertan had already lost his confidence.

The other Mages also felt hopeless after learning the truth.

The females of the Frosty Ancient Eagles were already a huge headache for them, let alone the stronger males that seemed even greater in number!

“We shouldn’t forget about the Ruler-level eagles, and their queen and king, if we are close to their nest,” Yassen added some fuel to the fire.

“Please, don’t even mention it. I’ll just find some valuable rocks nearby to turn in the job. I’m not going to take a step closer to them,” Bertan said.

“There must be a way.”

Everyone fell silent. Some were already backing away, hoping the patrolling eagles would not notice them.

“Mo Fan, the eggs of the Frosty Ancient Eagles can only hatch in extremely cold and dark environments. Those are also the places where Night Amethysts are usually found, so it’s simple where you should go next,” Nanyu told him quietly.

“Why do I feel like it’s not simple at all? I might not be good at studies, but I’m pretty sure all living creatures treat their eggs and younglings very seriously, especially the places where they lay their eggs. There must be a powerful leader among them guarding the eggs, and you’re telling me that’s where I should go to look for the Night Amethyst?” Mo Fan protested.

“I’m saying that it’s a possibility, since the conditions for a Night Amethyst to form naturally are extremely harsh. If you can’t find one where the Frosty Ancient Eagles are laying their eggs, you will have to go deeper,” Nanyu persisted.

“Please don’t add injury to my insult!” Mo Fan pulled a long face.

Mo Fan’s heart was covered in holes, just like the eagles’ nesting grounds.

While Mo Fan was figuring out a plan to tackle the situation, a deafening roar suddenly came from above. The glaciers attached to the mountain cracked and fell to the ground. It looked like the huge mountain had just shed a layer of its skin. The Mages quickly backed away to safety!

“My ears hurt!”

“Such a powerful roar!”
