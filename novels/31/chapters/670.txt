Thunder boomed and rolled; the explosive penetrative power of the lightning left a hole on the Two-Face Phantom General’s face.

The Phantom General had two faces and one mouth. One of the faces was similar to a human’s, while the other one was festered and full of scars. However, when the former was struck by lightning, both of the faces were now festered, fresh blood falling from them. It was likely that the face would be full of scars, just like the other face, once the bleeding stopped.

Obviously, the Phantom General did not like its faces matching that way. Its festered and slightly blown-up head rotated, revealing an eyeball almost falling out from its socket, giving it an eerie appearance.

The Phantom General screamed and stomped forward.

Mo Fan dodged aside, but the enormous Phantom General stomped its foot again before he could stand firmly. The stomp was so powerful that it left a huge pit in the sturdy ground!

Mo Fan did not dodge aside this time. His body sank with the Phantom General’s foot and turned into a puff of shadow. It split into two and fled from the creature’s stomp!

In the Phantom General’s eyes, the two shadows that Mo Fan turned into were like two cockroaches escaping from its stomp. However, it was confused about why there were two of them when there was only one that it stomped on?

When the Phantom General was still figuring out which shadow was its real target, Mo Fan already moved fifty meters away. He pointed his finger at the sky once again, summoning the rest of the lightning that he had not yet unleashed to strike the Two-Face Phantom General’s head!

The Two-Face Phantom General’s head was almost blasted in half by the lightning. Brain liquid leaked out from the hole in its head, while one half of its skull dangled in the air, similar to the dangling eyeball from before.

After all, the creature was an undead. Other demon creatures would be close to death if their heads were blasted open like that!

The Two-Face Phantom General was trembling from the hit. The lightning was quite powerful. Even though the creature’s body was able to withstand the damage, its bones were shaking hard from the shock. As the creature was enormous, it relied heavily on the support of its skeleton, thus further increasing the effect of Qianjun’s space-trembling effect.

Another gorgeous lightning strike descended. The Phantom General almost lost its balance. It suddenly dropped to the ground on its knees.

More lightning strikes descended wildly in succession. Mo Fan wanted the Phantom General dead as soon as possible. More than a thousand undead would be here soon; he had to eliminate those that posed a great threat to him in the quickest possible time!

The Two-Face Phantom General was blasted by the lightning beyond recognition. Its whole body was festering, scorched, with blood splattering everywhere. However, the creature had no sense of pain or acknowledgment that it was suffering from serious injuries. As soon as its bones were no longer under the space-trembling effect, it lunged at Mo Fan and attacked with its claws!

“So that’s where your undead crystal is!” Mo Fan stood his ground with no intention to dodge the incoming attack.

The lightning had blasted a hole in the Two-Face Phantom General’s belly. The scorched hole gaped open, and inside it was a glittering crystal. It was the undead’s weakness!

Not many Warrior-level creatures managed to survive consecutive blasts of Mo Fan’s Thunderbolt: Wild Strikes. It seemed like it would take more than a few Lightning Strikes to kill the Two-Face Phantom General. Luckily, the enraged creature was totally unaware that its weakness was exposed.

“Fiery Fist: Exploding Heaven!”

Mo Fan’s fist erupted in flames as he attacked the ten-meters-tall creature. The blazing red flames burst forward and formed a fiery ring, with Mo Fan in the middle!

The raging flames combined into a fiery fist, aimed at the hole on the Two-Face Phantom General’s belly!

The Two-Face Phantom General’s torso was huge enough to contain the entire Fiery Fist. Not only did the Fiery Fist smash the undead crystal into pieces, it even penetrated the back of its chest... Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Once the undead crystal was broken, the creature was just a lump of rotten flesh and bones. The blazing red flames of the Fiery Fist simply set the remains on fire.

Within just a second, the ten-meters-tall creature was burned into a huge pile of ash and blown away by the wind, barely sweeping Mo Fan’s clothes and hair!

—

“This Mo Fan... how strong is he!?” exclaimed the mysterious man in surprise.

Watching from the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror, the people saw around two hundred corpses scattered around Mo Fan. Among them were two Warrior-level undead. He had eliminated all these troublesome creatures on his own, well beyond the capabilities of an ordinary Intermediate Magician.

“He still hasn’t shown all his strength,” said Zuo Feng.

Zuo Feng had witnessed Mo Fan’s shocking punch, which had blasted a Commander-level Flesh Mound Corpse Official flying. If he was using the improved version of the fourth-tier Fiery Fist, it would eliminate a huge pack of undead instantly...

As such, even though around two thousand undead had been sucked into the silver vortex, Zuo Feng still believed in the group of Young Magicians!

“By the way, did you notice something?” said Ling Xi.

“Notice what?”

“He... I think he has four Elements...” said Ling Xi.

“Now that you’ve mentioned it... Fiery Fist, Lightning Strike, Fleeing Shadow, and the two Summoned Beasts at the start. My God, he really has four Elements!” yelled Zuo Feng in astonishment.

Four Elements! Lightning, Fire, Summoning, and Shadow!

Everyone was aware of Mo Fan’s Double Innate Elements, yet they all assumed that Mo Fan would only have three Elements in the Intermediate Level, yet it turned out that he had four in total!

“Doesn’t that mean... he can Awaken two Elements every time he breaks though? He just reached to the Advanced Level, that means...” Lu Xu was stunned too!

Previously, they were immersed in great despair after learning the group ended up in the Space of Death. They assumed the four Magicians had no chance of surviving against two thousand undead. Even when Mo Fan was fighting, they did not pay any attention, and did not realize this fact until Ling Xi suddenly mentioned it!

– Four Elements, he really has four Elements!

-No wonder he’s able to start a bloodbath among the undead. The number of Elements he has is the same as a Super Magician!-

“I agree that we could just give up if it was someone else, but when it’s Mo Fan, these undead might not be able to stop him!” declared Yao Nan.

It was also Han Ji’s time witnessing Mo Fan’s full strength. His eyes flickered with a hint of admiration.

No wonder Zhu Meng was so fond of this young Intermediate Magician. He had four Elements, just like the Super Magicians standing around him!
