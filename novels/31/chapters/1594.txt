Chapter 1596 Electro Cannon

Mo Fan and Heidi were both Space Mages, so they had an abundant supply of water and food with them. They could easily last a long time in the Pyramid.

However, the longer they spent in the Pyramid, the more mentally worn out they were. Regardless of how spacious the chambers were, they were still constantly stuck in a confined space. It was easy for someone to be driven mad in such an environment, not to mention the fatigue from their never-ending fights.

“Let’s go, only thirteen chambers remaining, we can finally make it out of here if we don’t encounter a strong creature,” Shreev said.

“I remember when you said that there were only nine chambers left around a month ago,” Meos said.

“What can I do? We somehow went into a Pharaoh’s tomb, then a Dark Swordmaster’s chamber after that...” Shreev said.

“We are asking for our deaths if we actually fought the Pharaoh, but I still think we should have tried our luck against the Dark Swordmaster!” Mo Fan said.

A Dark Swordmaster was about as strong as the Advisor Mummy. The group believed there was a certain level of luck involved when they defeated the Advisor Mummy, thus they chose to avoid it instead. It ended up increasing the number of chambers they had to go through...

“It’s useless to dwell on it now,” Meos said.

“What I meant was, we should be a little more confident. We don’t necessarily have to skip the chambers with a Ruler-level Mummy. Perhaps we don’t stand a chance against the Ruler-level ones, but we definitely can try our luck against Ruler-inferior creatures like the Dark Swordmaster...” Mo Fan encouraged them.

The group had no choice but to keep going, no matter how worn out they were.

Perhaps the Heavens were finally willing to bless them, and they would not encounter any Ruler-level creature in the remaining seven chambers.

And now, there were only six chambers away from reaching the exit!

“Only six left?” Mu Bai confirmed again.

“Mm, only six left, we can finally leave this place if we don’t stumble into a Ruler-level creature for the next six chambers!” Shreev blurted out excitedly.

“Don’t celebrate too early, didn’t we only have three chambers left two weeks ago? What happened then?” Meos said fatalistically.

They went through the passage and arrived at the next chamber.

The chamber had a simple pattern. The bigger the chamber, the stronger the Mummy residing in it. Therefore, the group would always observe the size of the chamber first!

“A tiny one! We are in luck!” Zhao Manyan smiled.

The chamber was extremely small. Judging from their experience over two months, the owner of the chamber was at most a Great Commander-level creature! Anyone in the group could easily deal with it!

“Only five left, let’s keep it up!”

“Now who’s going to deal with this guy?” Mu Bai asked.

“We don’t have to do it ourselves. Let my Mummy handle it!” Meos said.

After fighting in the Pyramid for two months, Meos, Shreev, and Sayed’s undead had grown a lot stronger. They were no longer afraid to face a Commander-level creature in the Advancing Period.

Similarly, Mo Fan, Mu Bai, and Zhao Manyan had all reached the peak of the Advanced Level. Heidi had achieved the peak Advanced Level long ago. She just needed an opportunity to break through to the Super Level.

Unfortunately, she had been stuck at the peak Advanced Level for half a year. Her cultivation was still the same despite everything they had gone through. Apart from being more experienced in fighting, her cultivation did not improve by much.

On the other hand, since Mo Fan had quite a few Elements to work on, he had been nowhere close to reaching the peak Advanced Level before. However, all five of his Elements had now reached the peak Advanced Level. He had also improved the Advanced Spells of his Lightning, Fire, and Shadow Elements to the fourth-tier!

The Advanced Level was represented by Galaxies, each made up of three hundred and forty-three Stars. In other words, Mo Fan could only improve an Advanced Spell to the fourth-tier by enhancing all three hundred and forty-three Stars with Servant-class Soul Essences.

Luckily, he had currently an endless supply of undead to provide him with the Soul Essences. As long as he was fighting in here, he would never run short on Soul Essences. Mo Fan had stopped feeding Soul Essences to the Magic Medium Ring to increase the capacity of the Summoning Gate. He had been using them to strengthen his Sky-Flame Funeral, Silent Deadly Bolt, and Nyx Regime instead!

The fourth-tier Sky-Flame Funeral and Silent Deadly Bolt were almost as strong as Super Spells. They actually had an advantage over a Super Spell, since they took a shorter time to Channel and required a lower amount of energy. If Mo Fan could find a way out of the Great Pyramid of Giza, not only could he easily beat the crap out of a bunch of Advanced Mages at the same time, he would even dare to fight one or two Super Mages on his own now!

A series of metallic clanks were audible. Mo Fan was trying to estimate his strength when he noticed a familiar Skeleton Mummy standing in front of him!

“Isn’t this guy the lampstand?” Zhao Manyan blurted out. He also recognized the Skeleton Mummy.

The Skeleton Mummy was emitting an aggressive aura. It grabbed a skull of a deer from the pile of bones. It looked extremely weird when it was connected to the Skeleton Mummy’s body.

“I’ll do it,” Mo Fan said, stepping forward.

“Don’t lower your guard. It’s a Great Commander-level creature,” Heidi reminded him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Mo Fan nodded. He walked a little closer to the Skeleton Mummy. His lightning was flickering like dense spiderwebs under his feet, rumbling deeply.

“Silent Deadly Bolt!” Mo Fan quickly connected the three hundred and forty-three Stars. He could not be more familiar with the process now.

The Stars had a blinding glow. Since Mo Fan had enhanced the Stars multiple times, the purple Star Constellations of the Stars were a lot brighter than other Mages’ Star Constellations too. The Lightning Magic’s urge to fill the world was a lot stronger than before too!

“Electro Cannon!”

Lightning coils around his arms in an exaggerated way, while his body released a strong magnetic field. The lightning accumulated into the dark deadly bolt!

He snapped his arms forward!

He was like a huge electromagnetic cannon priming a massive load. His arms were the barrels of a cannon. As the lightning sprang forward, a strong counter-force knocked the rest of the group behind him flying. It felt like the force produced from the exhaust of an electromagnetic jet!

The lightning fired by the Electro Cannon was even quicker than the Silent Deadly Bolt. It flew horizontally above the bricks, breaking them into pieces even though the lightning never touched them...

“What on Earth... what the hell is that!?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed after stabilizing himself.

The Electro Cannon was clearly not a normal spell. It was something that Mo Fan had modified with his outstanding control. However, the Electro Cannon’s power was clearly higher than the Silent Deadly Bolt!
