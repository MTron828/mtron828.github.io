Chapter 2674: Shamanic Mountain Dragon

Lin Kang’s Iron Brush was covered in the fresh blood of countless creatures, granting it a stronger Aura of evil.

He stepped forward and glanced at Zhao Manyan, who was behind Mu Bai. He told the members of Qishan Hunter Group, “You, keep an eye on that man and don’t let him protect the others!”

The Qishan Hunter Group had five members. They were dressed in purple, red, black, blue, and yellow outfits respectively. The woman in a purple outfit stood out among them. She was holding a Bow, a magical weapon that was imbued with her Super Power.

Magic Artifacts were only useful after a Super Mage had Awakened their Super Powers. Those who had Awakened Super Powers were not necessarily superior, but those who owned a Magical Artifact were definitely strong!

“All of us against one?” the woman said aloofly. She glanced at Zhao Manyan and his eye-catching blond hair. She did not really have any interest in him. She glanced at Mu Ningxue and said, “There’s only one person I want to fight today!”

Mu Ningxue’s Ice Crystal Bow was no longer a secret, even though she had rarely used the powerful Lifetime Vessel. The truth was that not many people could threaten Mu Ningxue enough that she had to use the Ice Crystal Bow!

The woman was also a bow user from Qishan. She had a unique fighting style even before the Headquarters Cities were established.

“Just do what you want, but don’t let them intervene in my fight!” Lin Kang snapped impatiently.

The woman looked at her comrades and said, “The four of you will handle that blond guy. I’ll take care of Mu Ningxue.”

“Us four?” the man in a black outfit smirked.

“Won’t that be an overkill? I would like to fight Mo Fan. Didn’t he say he was open to anyone’s challenge after he beat Zu Xiangtian? Zu Xiangtian isn’t even that impressive. He’s just a useless Super Mage who relied on his clan’s resources. Those renowned clans like to boast to attract people’s attention. The real strong Mages wouldn’t expose themselves so easily,” the Hunter in a yellow outfit piped up.

“Our Qishan Hunter Group has never promoted ourselves or shown our faces in public. Otherwise, those nobodies wouldn’t be able to make a name for themselves!” the Hunter in a black outfit exclaimed.

Their Hunter Group was different from other Hunters. They would only hunt demon creatures that were strong and deadly. They had never failed to hunt down targets that even the military, Hunter Alliance, and formidable factions had struggled against.

The Hunters only cared about actual strength, instead of bragging about themselves like the renowned clans. The vases that hid in the cities most of the time were nowhere close to the Hunters who often went to dangerous places to mess with demon creatures!

“Enough talk, his cultivation isn’t any weaker than yours! Time to do some work!” the woman with the bow ordered.

The other four swiftly made their moves and circled around behind Mu Bai.

Lin Kang had already said he would take care of Mu Bai himself. They were not going to interfere with his fight if they could help it

The truth was, the four of them would struggle to interfere in the fight even if they wanted to. The Black Magistrate was already using an even stronger spell. The ground and the sky he and Mu Bai were standing on had turned black and red respectively.

Several palaces covered in bones and blood were emerging from the ground, the enormous bones pointing at the crimson sky. More bones were revealed every time the wind blew across the land and swept them up like sand.

It looked just like Hell!

Sinister demons were crawling out of the palaces, carrying weapons on their shoulders. Eerie green flames were flickering in their eyes. Their ghastly Auras were visibly drifting in the wind like cloaks.

Those Slaughtering Ghost Generals were most likely responsible for the skeletons and dead bodies that had piled up like mountains!

Mu Bai felt like he had accidentally fallen into Hell. His tiny figure could only reach the Slaughtering Ghost Generals’ toes. Hundreds of these giant creatures had surrounded him. They were grinding their weapons, empty skulls grinning eerily.

“There’s no way you are going to survive this time! A real Magistrate has control over purgatory and can do anything he wants in it! How could you possibly fight me when you can only draw some snow!?” Lin Kang burst out laughing.

The Slaughtering Demon Generals’ sinister chuckles were actually from Lin Kang.

The undead swung their deadly weapons wildly. They could slice an enormous creature into mincemeat in mere seconds.

Mu Bai tried his best to dodge the slashes. His Ice Magic could not withstand the deadly blows. Lin Kang had grown significantly stronger after receiving Nanrong Ni’s Blessing, and his attacks had placed Mu Bai under enormous pressure.

However, Mu Bai did not lose his calm.

He had learned a useful trick from the Venomous Insect Shamans in the Andes Mountain Range. He could inject any Undead and strange creature with a huge supply of energy in their bodies with a kind of insect!

These insects would absorb their energy and grow rapidly like parasites inside them. All Mu Bai had to do was wait, and the Slaughtering Demon Generals would gradually weaken. Mu Bai just had to dodge their attacks while the insects fed on them!

“Break out of your shells!” Mu Bai snapped his fingers when it was time.

The head of a Slaughtering Demon General exploded. A strange insect with ten legs dug its way out of the Slaughtering Demon General and stabbed another Slaughtering Demon General with its claws!

The Mountain Sting Insect had holes on its claws that could absorb a creature’s energy. The insect grew swiftly as its muscles and shell hardened. Its tail was covered in spikes, and it seemed it would evolve and grow stronger every time it took out a strong enemy.

However, the Mountain Sting Insect had an extremely short lifespan. It would die at the end of a battle.

The Slaughtering Demon Generals were fierce and dangerous, but they had walked right into Mu Bai’s trap. These Undead that Lin Kang summoned eventually ended up as nutrients for Mu Bai’s insects!

Ten Mountain Sting Insects had evolved into Shamanic Mountain Dragons with eighteen pairs of claws and spikes all over their bodies after they took out all the Slaughtering Demon Generals. Their tails were brimming with power and deadly poison!

“It’s just some petty insects. They are all going to die!” Lin Kang yelled scornfully.
