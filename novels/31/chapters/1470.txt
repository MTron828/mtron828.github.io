1473 No Backing Out, Fight Like Your Life Is At Stake!

To think that someone had the Innate Ability to mind three things at once in the world; it was basically cheating. It explained why the woman’s Will was so powerful, as if she could easily control anything within sight. Her mental strength clearly outmatched most Mages!

Mo Fan had been constantly practicing his Will, too. He was able to do all sorts of things with it, but when compared to this woman’s, it was like the difference between a little stream and a huge river...

Mo Fan had no intention of displaying his slight skill before an expert. He was forced to use his full strength against the insanely strong woman.

“Little Flame Belle! Fiery Ring of Burning Embers!”

Mo Fan summoned Little Flame Belle. The Domains of the Calamity Fire and the Ardent Sunset immediately amplified Mo Fan’s control of the Fire Element, placing all the Fire Magic in the surroundings under his control!

The two flames formed several rings of flames around him. The fiery rings spread out rapidly, burning the rocks that were flying at Mo Fan to ashes...

The rings spread further. The rocks were having difficulty closing in on Mo Fan despite their numbers.

“An attachable Fire Spirit?” Heidi stared at the man now engulfed in flames in disbelief.

If an Elemental Mage could form a pact with certain unique Elemental Creatures, it could significantly improve their control and strength of that Element! If they were lucky enough to find an attachable Elemental Spirit, they could even grant the Elemental Mage extra abilities that were not part of ordinary spells, allowing them to fight demon creatures in close combat!

Heidi finally realized who the Asian man was when she saw him being Possessed by the Flame Belle.

The strongest participant in the World College Tournament, with unstoppable Fire and Lightning Elements, the Chinese Mage with Double Innate Elements!

That being said, Heidi had no intention to let Mo Fan go, regardless of who he was!

“Fire Crystal Candle!” Mo Fan swiftly gathered the flames and compressed them into a little candlelight.

Mo Fan could not afford to preserve his strength after learning how strong his opponent was. If he allowed his opponent to secure the upper hand, he was going to have a hard time casting a spell that could threaten her!

The Fire Crystal Candle formed from three Soul-grade Flames had three different colors: brown, rose, and scarlet. It did not stand out much, yet the energy it contained could easily destroy mountains and rivers!

Heidi did not care much about it. However, her expression shifted when she noticed the space around it being compressed countless times.

“Blink!” Heidi immediately vanished into thin air, leaving a trail of crystalline blue dust behind.

Heidi appeared four hundred meters away the following second. Her alluring figure remained at the waterfall curtain...

Mo Fan was quite surprised that the woman was able to Blink so far away.

However, it did not necessarily mean she was out of range!

“Detonate!”

The three Soul-grade Flames exploded above the wide river. A shocking mushroom cloud roared into the sky. The waves of flames completely devoured the area within a few hundred meters!

The flames rapidly approached Heidi. Her sapphire blue eyes glowed brilliantly. Her figure was encapsulated by the same light.

It was possible to do a lot of things with Will. The waterfall less than fifty meters behind her behaved unusually once again. The white curtain turned into a pair of hands and wrapped around her, blocking the fierce waves of flames lunging at her. A white mist rose into the air as the flames crashed into the waterfall!

The flames surged at the bridge under the waterfall. Both Sheryl and Edith gasped. They knew Mo Fan was strong since he had come in first in the World College Tournament, but they did not expect him to be able to last for so long in the battle against Heidi, the Queen of Dimensions! The students of Alps Institute had been bothered by a thought for a long time; could the students of the same grade possibly defeat Heidi, even if they teamed up?

“I’ve really underestimated you!” Heidi slowly appeared from the disarrayed water. Her skin was still as pale as snow. Mo Fan’s three Soul-grade Flames did not harm her at all.

“Likewise!” Mo Fan took a deep breath. It was surprising to find such a brilliant Maga hidden deep in the mountains. For over half a year, Mo Fan had thought he would not find any Advanced Mage that could fight him for more than five minutes, other than a Turtle Shell Mage like Zhao Manyan!

“I was only minding two Elements at once. You are still no match for me. If you drop to your knees and apologize, I will consider sparing your life,” Heidi said coldly.

“My mind was full of your naked body just then, so I wasn’t able to pay attention, either. If you willingly climb up to my bed tonight and serve me well, I will consider not destroying such a beautiful flower like you,” Mo Fan replied disdainfully.

“You asked for it!” Heidi utterly regretted her decision to converse with a man whose mind was full of such dirty thoughts. She was thinking of giving him a chance, since she was quite impressed by his strength, yet the guy did not show any hint of remorse!

“Don’t just use your mouth; if you don’t show me some true moves or alluring postures, I won’t feel anything!” Mo Fan shot back.

Heidi blushed in anger; every man she had ever met had either been very polite to her, or disregarded her aloofly. She had never seen anyone so shameless and perverted... normally, she would destroy someone like him with a single glance! She would treat him just like a wild, barking dog... but the problem was, she was having trouble taking him out! She could only listen to the filthy words that were polluting her ears.

“I’ll tear your mouth apart first!” Heidi hissed.

Her blue eyes flickered; this time, she did not grab the things around her with her Will. She was fixing her eyes on Mo Fan, attacking him directly with her Will! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The ability to mind three things meant that not only she was able to split her Will into three to cast three different spells simultaneously, but it also meant her mental strength was several times stronger when she was fully focused!

The Will was invisible. It was a strong mental force as quick as a glimpse and as powerful as a godly weapon!

Mo Fan was a Space Mage, too. There was no way he would miss such a deadly force coming at him. To his surprise, not only was the woman’s Will slashing at him like an axe, it was binding him to the spot! His body was trembling under the enormous pressure, and he could not even budge!

It was meaningless for a person to run away on foot when a huge mountain was collapsing onto them. It was the scariest thing about being bound to the ground under pressure. Mo Fan had experienced it when he was facing the Dreadful Curse Cerberus and the Scorpion Lord Medusa!

“So it’s possible to seal off a target’s movement when one’s Will is strong enough,” Mo Fan murmured.

Either way, the woman’s mental strength and cultivation of Dimensional Magic were significantly stronger than his own. He was able to learn a few things from her Mind Lock and Will Slash attack...

That being said, Mo Fan was not completely helpless against it. He had prepared something in advance and injected it into her alluring body when he realized how outstanding the woman’s mental strength was. It was none other than the evil Dark Material!

“Rebelling Shadow!” Mo Fan didn’t move, not even trying to dodge the Axe of Will.

He would like to see if his Rebelling Shadow was quicker at slicing her throat than her Will was in hitting him. He did not even bother to defend himself, since he did not have any defensive spells that would come in handy!

The Dark Material silently flew out of Heidi’s back. It was as faint as a mist, but as more of the Seeds of Darkness sprouted, the Dark Material grew thick enough to form a demon shadow resembling her!

The black shadow attached to Heidi’s back. Its slim hand curled around Heidi’s long, pale neck, while it placed a dagger on her skin.

Despite having Heidi’s noble and elegant silhouette, the demon shadow suddenly sprouted an eerie grin!

If the demon shadow successfully slit its target’s throat, it would return the Commander-level Soul Remnant to Mo Fan. Mo Fan stood there waiting, the same eerie grin on his face.

Heidi never thought her own shadow would threaten her life. She shivered in fear when she felt the cold touch on her neck.

-That’s right, the guy has Double Innate Elements. The Fire, Lightning, and Space Elements aren’t the only Elements he has...-

If Heidi withdrew her attack right away, she could easily defend herself, and get rid of the Rebelling Shadow with the speed and strength of her Will. It was why Mo Fan was being so fearless; he firmly believed Heidi would withdraw her attack to defend herself!

“Let’s see who’s quicker, then!” Heidi’s eyes glittered as she uttered the words firmly.

Heidi did not withdraw her Will. The Rebelling Shadow needed some time to slit her throat open, and also needed time for her throat to bleed. Meanwhile, her Will would reach Mo Fan, who was controlling the Rebelling Shadow, in the next second, and tear him into pieces!

Heidi could take a defensive approach and let the battle continue, but she chose not to!

She decided to push both Mo Fan and herself to the edge of the cliff, forcing Mo Fan to withdraw the Rebelling Shadow and defend himself instead. Either way, she would not forgive the jerk for staining her innocence!

“F**k! Are you out of your mind!?” Mo Fan was shocked when he noticed Heidi was not withdrawing her attack.

-Crazy, the woman is absolutely nuts!- She was going to die if he did not withdraw his attack. The Rebelling Shadow would not just cause her to bleed when it slit her throat, it would also inject the Dark Material into the wound! If the Dark Material entered her body through the arteries of her neck, no Healing Magic could match the rate her life would drain away!
