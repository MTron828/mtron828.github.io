“It’s just how the female rights organizations are. The people of the Alps Institute were the same when we first visited them,” Mo Fan reminded him.

“Yeah, Kris, the Priest, and the Knights, they are being too respectful to her. She can easily feel superior,” Zhao Manyan agreed.

“Bear with it, we aren’t familiar with the place. We might save a lot of time with her leading the way,” Mo Fan said.

Muses had incredibly high statuses in the Parthenon Temple. Priests and Golden Sun Knights would normally surround the Muses. According to Kris, this Muse Pelina was quite well respected in the Parthenon Temple. She had many supporters in Asia.

“Muse, was there any emergency in Lhasa that you have to go there so urgently?” Priest Dowell asked her.

They had all set out in a hurry. Priest Dowell only knew that his mission was to accompany a Muse to Tibet and China, but he was unaware of the details.

Muse Pelina glanced at Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan, the two outsiders. She was obviously not willing to discuss it in front of them.

Priest Dowell was sensible about that. He realized their mission in the Divine City of Lhasa was confidential.

Dowell had learned that there were many things that the public was unaware of as his cultivation continued to improve, especially after he became a Priest of the Parthenon Temple. The things he had encountered had toppled his understanding of the world. However, despite his astonishment and disbelief, there were things he had to accept, as he had no other choice.

Muse Pelina was not well respected in the Parthenon Temple just because she had a great reputation in Asia. More importantly, she was often sent to other places for secret missions. These missions were usually related to the Magic Associations of the Five Continents, the Heresy Judgment Court, the Main Hunter Alliance, and other top organizations in the world.

Dowell was more experienced with the situation in Greece or the Parthenon Temple as a Priest, but Pelina had obviously encountered more things than him. She had been to Tibet’s Divine City of Lhasa.

The Parthenon Temple was not on very friendly terms with the Chinese organizations, but they had great respect for the Sacred Palace Mages of Lhasa’s Potala Palace. Pelina had a great reputation in Asia mainly because she was close to the Sacred Palace Mages.

Kris’ Steel Griffin was an impressive Summoned Beast. Its endurance as a mount easily stood out among the other Summoned Beasts there. It could even wrap itself with a harmless aura which ensured it was not attacked when crossing other demon creatures’ territories.

High endurance, great speed, and an aura of harmlessness. Not many Summoned Beasts could tick off all three criteria, not to mention Kris’ Steel Griffin was also a Commander-level creature!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was not suitable to be used as a mount. Mo Fan would only ride him when he was in a hurry. The main reason for that was that the wolf species was extremely invasive. Their presence would spread for a great distance even if they were just passing by other demon creatures’ territories. The hot-tempered demon creatures would race to intercept the Flying Creek Snow Wolf and interrogate him.

The distance between Greece and Lhasa was almost half the width of Asia. A normal flying creature would be worn out after covering half a country’s distance while carrying them, let alone flying across so many countries and territories of demon creatures in a single flight...

That being said, it was Mo Fan’s first time hearing that the high-level Mages had a certain route that they would use to fly around. It allowed them to travel between countries and through the demon creatures’ territories safely. Only certain people knew about the route, and it was not disclosed to the public.

“Kris, how good is your Steel Griffin’s memory? For someone who has difficulties staying in one place and often visits the Parthenon Temple like me, it’s quite troublesome to take the planes. Can you memorize this route for me?” Mo Fan asked Kris softly.

He had always had problems with international flights, and since he was currently a thorn in many people’s eyes, he did not want others to learn his whereabouts easily. If he could learn the special route, he would have another option to travel between countries!

“Well... I can draw it for you if you really need it, but please don’t tell the Muse. Only she has access to the route. I will be in great trouble if they learn I leaked it,” Kris answered softly.

“You can remember it after we’ve traveled across so many countries, mountains, deserts, and forests?” Mo Fan blurted out.

“Perhaps it’s because I’m good at my studies. I can remember the places we’ve been to, I just need a little more time to recall the details and draw them,” Kris confirmed.

“Sick, as expected of a genius!” Mo Fan raised his thumb at Kris.

Mo Fan was a geography idiot. He actually thought the Middle East was part of Africa when they were flying over it. There was no way he could remember the route himself!

They were unable to fly to the tall mountains directly as they were arriving at Lhasa. The Steel Griffin had to fly to other areas with a lower altitude so the team could reach Lhasa on foot through a side entry.

The air was slightly thinner up in the mountains, but it was clean and refreshing. It was similar to the air in the Alps. It was Mo Fan’s first time in the Western Regions of China.

They finally arrived at the reputable Divine City, sometimes called the City of the Gods.

Lhasa was famous across the world. Many of the top organizations in the world held their meetings in the Divine City. China had two such powerful organizations: one was the Magic Palace of the Imperial Mages, and the other was the Potala Palace, with its Sacred Palace Mages. The Imperial Mages focused on matters inside the country, while the Sacred Palace Mages focused on matters across the world.

The Sacred Palace Mages worked closely with the Parthenon Temple, hence the members of the Parthenon Temple never acted superior in front of the Sacred Palace Mages.

“Wait for me here, I’ll need to pay a trip to the palace. We will depart for the Scar of Tianshan Mountain in three days,” Muse Pelina said.

“Muse, do we have to wait here too?” Silver Moon Knight William asked, clearly wanting to go with her.

“You are covered in dust, just wait at the mountain foot,” Pelina ordered him.

“Affirmative!”

Pelina went up to the palace alone. The knights were resolute and upright, and simply stood in place without going anywhere. Their imperious bearing immediately attracted the attention of the tourists on the plaza, who began to whisper among themselves.

One had to admit that the knights of the Parthenon Temple were very eye-catching. The specially-made coats of the Blue Star Knights and Silver Moon Knights were oddly imposing, making any other Mages standing beside them look like lowly beings.

“Let’s regroup with Lingling and the others,” Mo Fan said.

“Oh my, those people even went to take photos with them. Are they really that ignorant?” Zhao Manyan was speechless when he saw people taking selfies with the knights.
