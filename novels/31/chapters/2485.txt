Jiangming Bay…

When Mo Fan and Ding Yumian arrived, a monster with the body of a Camphor tree and a lizard’s head was chasing after a Wind instructor.

The teacher did not escape the Camphor Tree Demon Lizard’s pursuit. He was swallowed by the creature in a single bite.

Mo Fan frowned. He could not tell what the monster was or evaluate its level at first glance. It did not look like a sea monster at all. It was like some creature from the deep mountains.

“It’s a Summoned Beast!” Ding Yumian quickly identified the Camphor Tree Demon Lizard.

“The sea monsters can use the Summoning Element too?” Mo Fan was shocked.

“It’s been Summoned by a human!” Ding Yumian pointed at an old man on the other side.

The old man stood beside the Camphor Tree Demon Lizard. Not only did the creature not attack him, it was shielding him from the magic flying in his direction.

The Camphor Tree Demon Lizard was obviously the old man’s Summoned Beast!

“Strange, isn’t he the old professor of the Summoning School?” Mo Fan frowned.

Mo Fan had enrolled in the Summoning School when he was at the Azure Pearl Campus. He remembered the old professor had given them a lecture.

He took a closer look and confirmed it the same old man was commanding the Camphor Tree Lizard Demon!

However, why was he ordering his Summoned Beast to attack other teachers instead of killing the sea monsters?

“He’s being controlled!” Ding Yumian stared at the old professor.

Even though the old professor was standing beside the river, something like a tentacle was wrapped around his neck. The inner side of the tentacle had tiny meat tendrils that looked like little needles. They were stuck inside the old man’s neck. The old professor was already as pale as a corpse.

“He looks dead.” Mo Fan could not sense the old professor’s life force.

“Mm, but the thing controlling him…” Ding Yumian stopped halfway and suddenly looked at the signal tower.

The signal tower had a lot of space at the top. Tentacles that looked like they were covered in wax had filled the openings.

The intertwining tentacles were extending out around the waist of a woman who looked like an icy-blue wax statue. Her chest, arms, and necks were covered in bright oily scales. Her hair was like seaweed draped over her shoulders like worms.

If someone was looking at her from afar, they might assume her to be a woman in a lovely dress with nice permed hair, but after seeing her true appearance, they would be disgusted.

“Why does that thing look like the Trench Demon Houzi described?” Mo Fan murmured.

Zhang Xiaohou’s description had sounded a little exaggerated. Mo Fan assumed Zhang Xiaohou had spent too much time in the water, causing him to hallucinate a little, and so the creature he described was twisted and ugly.

However, when he saw the sea monster that Zhang Xiaohou had described, he realized Zhang Xiaohou just lacked the necessary vocabulary. The creature was even spookier and weirder than he had described!

Did the creatures in the deep sea not care about their appearances, just because there was no light?

“If it’s really the monster Houzi saw, it’s good at controlling people’s minds!” Mo Fan immediately realized why the old professor was attacking other teachers.

A Trench Demon! It was not the same creature Zhang Xiaohou had met in Bohai Sea, but the same species was extremely dangerous and good at controlling someone’s mind!

“Ding Yumian, hurry up and free Professor Zhou!” Dean Fu said.

Dean Fu seemed to know Ding Yumian’s capabilities. He had purposely called her here to help them.

“Mo Fan, you handle the Camphor Tree monster,” Ding Yumian said.

“Shouldn’t we deal with that thing first?” Mo Fan pointed at the creature on the signal tower.

The Trench Demon seemed relaxed on the signal tower. It would occasionally lift its tentacles to clean the meaty whiskers on them, like an elegant woman straightening the corners of her dress. It acted like it had nothing to do with the mess going on below.

Ding Yumian had provoked the Crocodile Sea Demons to kill one another out of greed, but it turned out the sea monsters also had powerful creatures with the ability to control human minds, making the professors and teachers of the Pearl Institute fight one another!

“Let me worry about it, you will find yourself at a great disadvantage!” Ding Yumian replied grimly.

She had most likely become aware of the sea monster’s strength. She knew she had to use everything she had to fight it!

Mo Fan did not force himself. He would be unable to fight with his full strength against a sea monster with Psychic Magic.

If Apas were around, she would be able to teach the sea monster a lesson. However, Apas must have reached Dianshan Lake by now. She was too far from here.

Mo Fan glanced at the old professor with a white beard.

The old professor was standing there, his face all blue. Although his body was still moving, Mo Fan could not sense any life from him. He was dead.

Not only was the sea monster able to control one’s mind, it could also use the Undead Element!

It made the old professor look like he was still alive, and used his will to give orders to the Camphor Tree Lizard Demon.

The Camphor Tree Lizard Demon was very strong. Half of the lecturers, professors, and directors had been severely injured by it.

They did not have any choice but to stop the infighting. They had to get rid of the old professor’s Summoned Beast!

“Ding Yumian, can’t you free Professor Zhou’s mind?” Dean Fu was covered in sweat. He was fighting another professor.

The professor was also a powerful Super Mage. Dean Fu had already defeated the rest of his enemies, but he was struggling against the professor with the Shadow Element.

Nevertheless, the Camphor Tree Demon Lizard was still the greatest threat. It was the strongest of Professor Zhou’s Summoned Beasts. It could take on ten of them at a time!

Ding Yumian shook her head and said confidently, “It won’t work. Professor Zhou is already dead. He’s more like an Undead under the sea monster’s control. The Psychic Element isn’t effective against him!”

“You can’t get another student killed by it. How would he stand a chance against the Camphor Tree Lizard Demon…”

Before Dean Fu finished, he saw the young student creating a river of lava several meters wide to cross the river.

The Camphor Tree Lizard Demon glided across the ground into the shocking spell. Scorching flames surged at the powerful Ruler-level creature!
