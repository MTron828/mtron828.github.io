Both the Shadow Riders and Wind Riders launched attacks on different sides of the enemy camp after the enemy lost a Super Mage.

The attacks were a great success. The Shadow Mages invaded the enemy camp from a spot that was difficult to defend.

The enemy reacted swiftly, immediately sending out a huge group of Light Mages.

However, the Wind Riders were on standby in the sky. Their target was none other than the enemy’s Light Mages!

Another bloodbath took place. The Wind Riders and Shadow Riders soon returned to the sky after a pleasing victory. They had completely gotten over their previous loss against the Venomous Insect Shamans.

“General, we are playing the Brown Rebels like a fiddle!” the captain of the Shadow Mages exclaimed.

They were flying in enemy territory and had managed to retreat safely after their first few successful attacks. The Eagle Horse Skyriders were in great spirits!

“General?” the captain called out again.

The Ruler-level Eagle Horse was slightly above the captain of the Shadow Mages. Lieutenant General Dutch should be able to hear him even if he was not using a communication device.

To his surprise, Lieutenant General Dutch did not respond to him.

“I don’t think he’s up there,” Mo Fan said quietly.

“He’s not?” The captain of the Shadow Mages immediately increased his altitude, staring at the back of the Ruler-level Eagle Horse. Lieutenant General Dutch was nowhere to be seen. There was only someone dressed like him atop it!

The captain of the Shadow Mages panicked a little. Where did their general go?

“He must have used the same trick to put a Curse on the enemy’s Super Fire Mage Boris without alerting anyone before,” Mo Fan deduced.

The captain of the Shadow Mages let out a relieved sigh.

The general had let the Ruler-level Eagle Horse fly around in the sky so the enemy would assume he was on it. The real Lieutenant General Dutch had secretly made his way to the ground and set up a trap for his prey with his Curse Magic!

“Fly higher! Everyone, ascend at once!”?Eagle Eye’s voice suddenly sounded in everyone’s mind.

The order took everyone by surprise. It sounded like something unexpected had happened. The Psychic Mage was now giving orders in place of Lieutenant General Dutch!

The Eagle Horse Skyriders immediately increased their altitude to around three hundred meters, despite their confusion.

It was unlikely for an enemy to threaten them at their current height. On the other hand, they were no different from scouts, as they were unable to pose a threat to the enemy, either.

A bolt of lightning flashed across the sky, revealing a pitch-black claw. The riders could clearly see the terrifyingly sharp talons on it!

“What the heck!?” Zhao Manyan screamed.

Mo Fan had a fright too. He quickly pulled the reins to change the direction his Eagle Horse was flying.

Luckily, the black claw that had appeared out of nowhere was not targeting Mo Fan. It barely missed his Eagle Horse.

Mo Fan looked down after dodging the terrifying thing.

A man covered in blood was rising into the sky with a wide grin, like he had successfully done something impressive, despite the risk involved.

The man was none other than Lieutenant General Dutch!

He had killed an important enemy officer once again, but he had paid a great price in return. His chest, neck, and head were bleeding.

“Crap!” Mo Fan’s heart skipped a beat. The black claw was not coming after him, but Lieutenant General Dutch beneath him!

Another lightning strike lit up the sky like a flickering street lamp.

The claw had landed right on Lieutenant General Dutch!

The claw was several times larger than the one that had attacked Mason. Dutch had managed to escape from the enemy’s flank, but he did not expect the danger to come from above him.

The lightning dissipated in an instant. As its light was fading, Mo Fan saw the claw rip Lieutenant General Dutch apart. His blood poured out between the gaps of the talons.

Then Mo Fan could no longer see anything in the darkness, despite his ability to see at night.

The black claw had disappeared, too. Only the curtain of rain blocking the hazy and disordered battlefield remained.

Mo Fan’s mind went blank for a long time.

Zhao Manyan kept yelling beside him. His voice eventually entered Mo Fan’s ears.

“What did you see?

“Hey! Mo Fan, you are splitting up from the others!

“Holy crap, you finally came to your senses. I thought that thing had destroyed your brain or something. What was that just then? How did it appear out of nowhere? Was it magic or a monster?” Zhao Manyan blabbered.

Mo Fan took a deep breath. “Dutch is dead,” he told Zhao Manyan.

“Who’s Dutch? We are in enemy territory. It’s normal to lose a few men, it’s not like we’ve lost that old general!” Zhao Manyan called back.

Zhao Manyan’s eyes widened as he realized something after finishing the sentence. The Dutch who Mo Fan had mentioned was the lieutenant general!

The leader of the Eagle Horse Skyriders who was not only experienced at commanding his men, but possessed extraordinary strength, too!

“How...how did he die?” Zhao Manyan could not believe it. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“He killed an enemy officer, but someone else killed him as he was fleeing,” Mo Fan replied.

“But...but it was so sudden!”

Mo Fan felt the same way.

Lieutenant General Dutch had killed Boris without attracting any attention. Even the enemy was completely unaware of how he’d done it.

It meant Lieutenant General Dutch had some other ability to conceal his presence, in addition to his impressive Curse Magic.

But how did the enemy track him down and intercept him this time? Did someone who was stronger than him see through his trick?

Lieutenant General Dutch was commanding the Eagle Horse Skyriders. He was both the leader and the central figure to them. How were the Eagle Horse Skyriders going to function without him?

“The others didn’t seem to notice it,” Zhao Manyan looked at the Eagle Horse Skyriders who were still moving with discipline.

Dutch had disguised himself before he left to take down the enemy officer. The Eagle Horse Skyriders were still totally clueless about that. They still assumed the person on the Ruler-level Eagle Horse was their lieutenant general.

The captain of the Shadow Mages had found out the person on the Ruler-level Eagle Horse was a decoy, but he had not seen Lieutenant General Dutch’s death.

“Maintain your formation and watch the enemy’s movements!” Lieutenant General Dutch’s voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were stunned. “Isn’t he dead?” Zhao Manyan asked Mo Fan again.

“He should be. I saw it clearly… Hang on, the guy who spoke to us wasn’t Dutch!” Mo Fan noticed.

“Who else could it be?” Zhao Manyan demanded.

“It’s Eagle Eye, the Psychic Mage who’s giving out orders.. He’s mimicking Dutch’s voice… no, he’s using Psychic Magic to make us think we are hearing Dutch’s voice,” Mo Fan realized.
