Chapter 270: The Senior Hunter and his Blue Beast

Translator: Tofu Editor: Tofu

“Mr. Gu Han, Professor Qiu Yuhua, you’re here. I’m practicing with my new Summoned beast.” The flames on Mo Fan’s figure vanished as he greeted the two teachers with a smile.

“Mo Fan, a big congratulations to you. What do you think? What’s the strength of your Swift Star Wolf like?” Qiu Yuhua asked happily.

Mo Fan was having a friendly battle with his Swift Star Wolf. To his surprise, he had to rely on his Shadow element to force the battle into a draw. It was so fast that it could easily dodge his Thunderbolt: Yaksha. He was utterly clueless if he would be able to defeat it in a situation of life and death.

-It’s not too embarrassing if I can’t defeat the Swift Star Wolf. It’s obviously my Summoned Beast. I would let it beat anyone that doesn’t agree with me!-

“Very strong, I don’t think I could restrain it.” Mo Fan said with all honesty.

“HAHAHA, only a maniac like you would be able to fight against the Swift Star Wolf on your own. Anyone else would surely be torn into pieces with a few minutes. The Swift Star Wolf is considered the hardest creature to deal with among the wolf species. Without proper preparations, groups of Intermediate Magicians would not even dare to trouble a Swift Star Wolf.” The old professor seemed quite impressed with Mo Fan’s new Summoned beast.

Mo Fan raised his brows as he gently stroked the Swift Star Wolf’s fur, “I didn’t know you were that strong!”

“The Swift Star Wolf also has a unique ability...Cough cough, you should take your time to discover it. Now, let’s ask the others to come. I’ll stake everyone a meal as a way to celebrate Mo Fan’s success!” The old professor was incredibly happy. His gaze toward Mo Fan was similar to one that he would give to a satisfying son-in-law!

On a side note, when they first met on the train from Xiamen to Shanghai, Qiu Yuhua had initially thought Mo Fan was full of bullshit, thus assuming him to be quite an unreliable student. To his surprise, two years had passed, and the young man had achieved a great deal. He should actually consider introducing the boy to his granddaughter, as he was definitely going to be a big shot in the future!

Gu Han was also congratulating Qin Nan, but his eyes never left the Swift Star Wolf. Behind his poker face was an expression filled with admiration. He could not help but step forward and caress its slightly messy hair from the fighting.

Too bad for him, the Swift Star Wolf totally ignored Gu Han, with a ‘please don’t touch me with your filthy hands’ look.

Luo Song and Shen Mingxiao both had awkward smiles, with twisted faces.

-Damn it, how lucky can this Mo Fan get? He even managed to help his Summoned beast to evolve successfully?-

-His Fire and Lightning Elements were already insane, and now the Swift Star Wolf was strong enough to fight on its own...-

The Swift Star Wolf let out a heavy breath as its pitch-black eyes stared at Luo Song.

It seemed like it had recognized Luo Song, as he was the one that had bullied it when it was first Summoned by Mo Fan.

The Swift Star Wolf stepped forward and moved its head toward Luo Song. The previous breath was exactly directed at him, as if it were trying to tell him something.

“Yo fatty, my Swift Star Wolf says he wants to play a few rounds with you.” Mo Fan said to Luo Song with a grin.

Luo Song finally realized something and immediately backed off. He waved his hand and said with a half-grin, “I’ll pass!”

This time, Luo Song could no longer hold his ground. Even Shen Mingxiao, who was stronger than he was, had been chased around like a puppy when fighting against the Violent Mark Wolf. It felt like the Swift Star Wolf was even stronger than the Violent Mark Wolf, so there was no way Luo Song would stand a chance against it.

The Swift Star Wolf cast another proud glance at Luo Song with a hint of disdain.

Luo Song’s smile froze. He was actually being scorned by a wolf...

On a vast land illuminated by the starry sky, an enormous beast with blue horns was running in the direction a white railcar was traveling in.

The beast was extremely fast, as it quickly overtook the railcar and eventually left it a huge distance behind.

“Dad, look. It’s a Godzilla!” A young girl stared at the enormous beast in bewilderment through the window of the railcar.

“Holy mother of god, it’s a demon beast!” The girl’s father let out a scream and tugged his daughter into his chest.

Even though the path of the railcar was still within the safe zones, there was no guarantee that it was completely safe from any demon beasts that somehow trespassed into them. Otherwise, how could anyone explain the giant beast that had just appeared?

The scream immediately grabbed the attention of the passengers, who quickly shifted their focus toward the enormous beast outside the window. If they did not know what it was, they would assume it to be a flying mountain instead!

“Everyone, please stay calm. It was only a Contracted Beast. A Senior Hunter is on duty nearby. He’s currently investigating the railway!” the conductor on the railcar announced through the speakers.

“So it’s a Contracted Beast, that scared the shit out of me.”

“That Summoner is so cool, I saw him standing on the beast’s head!”

“That’s a Senior Hunter for you, even Commander-level creatures are nothing in their eyes. That blue beast is most likely Commander-level!”

The white railcar was left behind as the blue beast disappeared into the distance. However, the passengers were curious about what had happened that a Senior Hunter had to come just to investigate the railway?

A voice spoke out of nowhere in the middle of the night. “Senior Hunter, I can’t get too close to the target. With the strength it displayed, I won’t even last five minutes in the battle.”

The haze nearby slowly cleared up as the moonlight lit up the area slightly. With a closer look, one could see a figure flying in the air!

The figure was around fifty meters above the ground, flying at a steady pace. The strong wings growing out from his back were rather dazzling under the moonlight. Every time they flapped, they would leave a huge gust behind.

“Don’t lose sight of it, I’ll be right there,” the Senior Hunter responded through the communication device.

“Why do we need to wipe the military’s ass after they messed it up... It’s leaving the safe zone, should I continue the pursuit?” the man in a leather jacket grumbled with a rather shrill voice.

“I was one of the people in charge of the whole project when I was with the military. However, it’s impossible that anyone has survived... It’s the biggest problem we encountered,” the Senior Hunter replied. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The winged man sighed. “Why did you guys even do it in the first place, when you knew it wasn’t going to work? Look at this mutated monster that you’ve created, such a pain in the ass to deal with! Besides, the project isn’t really humane, either, since each time it fails it costs the life of a magician!”

“It’s still the first magic breakthrough in a long time, the old people will never give up... I can see you!” the Senior Hunter spoke up.
