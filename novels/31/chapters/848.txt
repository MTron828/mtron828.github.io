If Little Loach asked Mo Fan to be more patient, there was no reason he should rush the process. Once Mu Ningxue arrived, they could then report in at the National Training Hall.

Mo Fan had not heard anything from Lingling yet. He went to Hangzhou to pay his cute, sexy, mature, and gorgeous Miss Tangyue and the charming, exceptional, upright Black Totem Snake a visit. Besides, he still had questions about the wooden clapper currently in Zhao Manyan’s possession.

—

After arriving at Hangzhou, Tangyue happened to be on the island at the center of the lake. Mo Fan simply took a boat out there. Her people knew Mo Fan, and just let him pass.

Tangyue was reading a book while keeping the Black Totem Snake company. She would visit once in a while, as if she was reporting how she had been lately to the elderly.

“It’s rare to see Miss Tangyue enjoying some leisure time. Every time I give you a call or send you a text, I always end up in the voicemail,” Mo Fan walked up and conveniently poured himself some face-nourishing tea. He sat with one leg over the other, not treating himself as an outsider.

“Your teacher is an official member of the Enforcement Union; don’t compare me to a free man like you, strolling everywhere as you wish... mmm, aren’t you on the national team? Shouldn’t you be on training now?” Tangyue smiled.

“Just back for a visit.”

“Alright, tell me what you’ve been up to, I can feel that your aura has grown a lot stronger,” Tangyue stared at Mo Fan with glittering eyes.

“Advanced Fire; almost Advanced Lightning; Summoning Element the same as usual; Shadow Element at the peak of Intermediate Level; Space Element still at the Basic Level...” Mo Fan reported honestly.

Tangyue clearly knew all his secrets, including his Demon Element. Tang Zhong and Leng Qing must have told her everything. They were all trustworthy people, so Mo Fan did not bother holding back the truth.

“Your Lightning Element should be improving at the same rate as your Fire Element, seems like it’s falling behind?” said Tangyue.

“Which is why I’ve come to ask Miss Tangyue some tips to breaking through to the Advanced Level. It was a coincidence that my Fire Element broke through to the Advanced Level, so I actually don’t have any experience,” said Mo Fan.

“Is that all?” Tangyue slightly raised her eyebrows. Somehow, she could tell that Mo Fan had other thoughts in mind.

“I’m mainly here to visit my beloved Miss Tangyue. It’s been a while, Miss Tangyue has grown prettier again.”

“As expected.”

“You’re seriously not modest at all.”

“Stop changing the topic,” Tangyue believed Mo Fan would not visit her for no particular reason.

“To be honest, I wanted to ask if you still have those scrolls you gave to me before, the magic scrolls that are consumed after casting a spell. Do you have any scrolls with Advanced Lightning Spells?” Mo Fan rubbed his hands and asked with a smile.

“Those are our Lingyin Enforcement Union’s treasure. We don’t usually give them away. Besides, it’s not wise to rely on them, either. A Magician should master the Star Patterns and Star Constellations of all their Elements. Relying on the scrolls would eventually result in bad habits...” Miss Tangyue had indeed played the teacher role before. She started giving Mo Fan advise as soon as she began to speak.

“Isn’t old man Tang Zhong the president? He can easily give some of them to me with a single sentence. I only need around eighty of them...” said Mo Fan smilingly.

Tangyue’s eyes widened!

Eighty scrolls? Did this guy seriously think those scrolls were as easy to acquire as A4 papers that only cost a few cents each!

“Three, I can only give you three at most!” snapped Tangyue.

The Lingyin Enforcement Union would never give the Star Constellation Scrolls to anyone if it wasn’t for Mo Fan’s contributions to Hangzhou.

“Five! I desperately need them.”

“Four, that’s my limit!” Tangyue retorted, clenching her jaw.

“Fine, four it is...” Mo Fan chuckled, like a cunning old fox.

“I knew you’re up to something,” mumbled Tangyue.

“Oh, by the way, I have something to show you. See if you can understand them,” Mo Fan recalled something. He took out his phone and opened the gallery.

Mo Fan had taken pictures of the messy writings on the wooden clapper, just to show them to Tangyue once he came back. The shapes drawn on the wooden clapper was extremely similar to those he saw on the walls on the island’s pavilion.

Tangyue thought Mo Fan was going to set her up again. She took a peek with a side glance, but her attention was soon drawn to the ancient writings. She quickly grabbed Mo Fan’s phone and took a closer look.

“Where did you find this?” Tangyue finally raised her head and asked excitedly after some time.

“A temple in Japan. I heard someone on the team mention that it’s a high-level container. It has its own world inside, and is able to accommodate spirits,” said Mo Fan.

“That’s right, a container of this kind can accommodate spirits. Furthermore, the spirits will become very powerful after living in the container for a certain period. The ancient writings are similar to those left by our ancestors on this island. It’s a record of another totem beast!” said Tangyue.

“Another totem beast?” Mo Fan was startled.

“Right, it dates back to the extinction of the totem beasts. The big guy is the only totem beast that our country has managed to preserve. Without the unique environment of the West Lake which provides him with the perfect cover, and the protection of our people every time he goes through ecdysis, he would have had trouble surviving until today.

“However, in the ancient times, when China still had many different races, there were once lots of totem beasts in this land, they were referred to as gods back then! Humans were too weak back then, and weren’t as civilized. However, the totem beasts were different from the other demon creatures. They can coexist with humans in peace and were even protecting the human tribes,” explained Tangyue in a serious voice.

“But didn’t the totem beasts go extinct? Isn’t the big guy the only one left? Does that mean the wooden clapper I found is useless too, since it’s nothing but some ancient literature?” said Mo Fan.

“No no no, this thing is extremely important! It’s not just the history that matters, but it also relates to a legend that we Totem Guardians strongly believe,” said Totem Guardian.

A legend?

Mo Fan was anticipating a thrilling tale as soon as he heard the word. He immediately paid closer attention!

“Legend says the totem beasts are immortal,” said Tangyue sternly.

“Im...immortal... that’s insane, I believe they have long lifespans, since even the big guy has been around for thousands of years, but saying they are immortal is going against science!” exclaimed Mo Fan.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
