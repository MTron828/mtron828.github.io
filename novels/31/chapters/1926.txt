Mo Fan looked down at the water and saw bulging eyes sticking out from fishlike heads. They were staring up at the uninvited guest in the sky above them.

A Scarlet Rending Demon riddled with injuries suddenly starting shrieking among the sea monsters. It kept sweeping its claws in Mo Fan’s direction. Mo Fan was amused when he saw the Scarlet Rending Demon that had lost an arm. It was one of the Scarlet Rending Demons that had escaped from Jimei University.

The creature had recognized him. It was telling its comrades that he was the one who had been bombarding them with the Lightning Element. He was the culprit who had killed many of their comrades!

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were planning to invade Gaoqi Airport, but they immediately turned around after hearing the Scarlet Rending Demon’s screams. They started swimming toward Mo Fan.

“Here they come!” Biling’s face paled. She had never faced so many demon creatures at such a close distance before. The fishy stench of the sea monsters was so strong that she felt like she was going to faint, not to mention the pressure from their glares.

Mo Fan looked up and told Biling, “Go higher. I’ll wait until more of them take the bait.” Her slim legs were completely exposed from his angle.

“But you...” Biling was still worried about Mo Fan’s safety.

“I’m fine, go ahead. From here on, I will kill every Scarlet Soaring Demon that shows up!” Mo Fan said confidently.

Biling nodded. She started rising to a safer height.

In addition to the huge groups of Scarlet Soaring Demons, there were quite a lot of Scarlet Rending Demons beneath Mo Fan now. They had stacked on top of one another like a platform so their attacks were able to reach him.

Mo Fan took his time when he noticed the trick the creatures were trying to pull off. However, the Magic Feather Imp on his back was a little intimidated. It beat its wings to escape from the area.

“Behave yourself, or I’m going to kill you first!” Mo Fan did not go easy on the Magic Feather Imp this time. He directly applied his Aura of dark magic toward the misbehaving Magic Feather Imp, forcing it to obey him.

The Magic Feather Imp realized Mo Fan was seriously going to kill it if it tried to run away on its own. It had no choice but to carry Mo Fan while staying at a dangerously low height.

“They are seriously holding a strong grudge against me,” Mo Fan murmured after glancing at the sea.

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were gathering toward him like they were organizing a protest. Even the water was unable to flow between them now. They were like demons crawling out of an abyss, trying to drag living creatures like Mo Fan down and tear him into pieces!

Mo Fan remained calm, using simple tricks to dodge the Scarlet Rending Demons’ attacks.

Biling was even more worried when she saw Mo Fan’s approach.

Mo Fan was simply playing with fire. She could already see the Scarlet Soaring Demons channeling their power to increase the height of the waves in the area. The Scarlet Soaring Demons were no longer just standing atop one another’s bodies. Even the water had formed a platform for the Scarlet Soaring Demons to climb up higher. Many of the Scarlet Soaring Demons could already reach Mo Fan with a jump.

“Strange, why do I feel like he’s fading away?” Biling suddenly noticed Mo Fan’s figure fading into the rain at times, like he had completely disappeared.

Biling realized Mo Fan was using himself as bait by staying at a height where only some of the Scarlet Soaring Demons, instead of the whole pack, could reach him. However, to her surprise, the duration of Mo Fan turning invisible grew longer as time went by!

Mo Fan would only disappear into the rain at times at first, but he was actually invisible most of the time now. She would only notice he was actually at the same spot the whole time after a while.

What is happening here?

Biling was utterly confused. She watched Mo Fan closely...

Mo Fan hovered in the rain, while his body kept turning invisible. Biling placed all her attention on him, yet she still did not understand what was causing it. Little did she know, a strong darkness had long spread through the area between the sky and the water!

When dusk arrived, people might not notice when the last glimpse of sunlight vanished below the horizon. Likewise, no one had noticed when the thick darkness in the air had appeared. Both the Scarlet Soaring Demons below and Biling higher up in the sky were not aware that the light in the area was slowly being devoured by something. However, the people further away could see nothing but darkness. It had a clear boundary, like it was a completely different world!

The Scarlet Soaring Demons still had no idea they were inside a zone of darkness. They kept lunging, biting, swinging their claws, spitting poison, and firing their spikes into the sky.

They were screaming with fury. Many dead bodies were floating in the nearby waters, and almost half of them were the brilliant work of Mo Fan. The vengeful creatures could not wait to swallow him alive!

“You petty creatures know about hatred and anger too?” Mo Fan was amused when he saw the expression on the ugly sea monsters’ faces.

The demon creatures on land were fighting humans to compete for the limited resources, but what conflict did the sea monsters in the oceans even share with humans? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They were just being greedy!

Did they really think humans were some prey they could slaughter as they pleased just because they could abuse the size of the oceans and the advantage the Creator had granted them?

Did they really come to a human city to hunt humans?

Mo Fan could not wait to see who the true prey was in the end!

“Dark Execution Ground!”

The Dark Moon Crystal had planted a lot of Seeds of Darkness for Mo Fan. The Scarlet Rending Demons were still enjoying the elegant view of the setting sun. Little did they know, the night curtain with a dangerous aura had already arrived!

Several Scarlet Rending Demons suddenly burst out of the water and lunged at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan’s figure vanished into thin air when the Dark Magic poured out, leaving only deadly darkness in the area!

Inside that darkness, an execution ground using the darkness to set up its boundary had appeared out of nowhere. Most shockingly, a shadow guillotine made up of countless shadow fiends was hanging at its highest point, almost reaching the clouds!

The shadow guillotine was as enormous as a magical artifact in the hands of a deity as it pointed down at the mundane sea. The Scarlet Soaring Demons in the sea lifted their heads and finally saw the icy shadow guillotine. Even though it was still hanging in the air, the sea monsters started suffering a mental breakdown, as if their heads were being held in place under it!
