“What should we do now? We still have time to leave as long as we don’t wake up the Sea Skeleton King...” Mo Fan was a little hesitant.

However, an alluring figure took off like a gust of wind before Mo Fan could finish his sentence. The wind turned into a long and thin sword in her hand. She thrust the sword at the Sea Skeleton King’s head.

The gust of wind was ferocious when it reached the rocks, knocking the Healers whose minds were being controlled away from the Sea Skeleton King.

The others were shocked!

Normally, Mo Fan would be the first to charge at the enemy. He had seven Elements, thus he could take on most Ruler-level creatures directly, but Mu Ningxue was also the kind who did not stick to the usual routine most of the time!

She slashed at the Sea Skeleton King without any hesitation. She was a heroine who dared to challenge her enemies directly too!

The Willow Leaf Sword was imbued with strong Ice Magic. The water across the sea was already freezing before the edge of the sword touched the Sea Skeleton King’s head.

The Sea Skeleton King’s body was made of water. The sword immediately split the Sea Skeleton King’s head in half.

Mu Ningxue had obviously done her homework. She knew the Sea Skeleton King’s body was able to recover as swiftly as water. She quickly unleashed her Ice Magic with her other hand after the slash.

The Ice Magic sprinkled on the cut on the Sea Skeleton King’s head like powder. The frost prevented the Sea Skeleton King’s head from recovering.

The Sea Skeleton King woke up with a furious roar.

As an Undead, slicing its head apart was not a deadly injury. It was one of the reasons why the Sea Skeleton King was such a formidable enemy. It completely ignored the cut on its head, and its eyes fixed on Mu Ningxue like spotlights.

Mu Ningxue was as petty as a little white moth to it.

The Sea Skeleton King was a little puzzled on top of its anger. How dare the puny human challenge it?

Many ancient beasts and demon creatures in the deep sea had to avoid its territory. Many powerful hordes had submitted themselves to it!

The Sea Skeleton King swung its arm and threw a fist at Mu Ningxue.

The punch shattered the frozen sea and Summoned the seawater within several kilometers. It turned into a vortex that was devouring everything with overwhelming force!

Mu Ningxue was too tiny. She was no longer visible in the vortex.

However, she was not as weak as she seemed. Mu Ningxue sliced the vortex in half as it approached her.

The crack was full of ice crystals, as if an icy canyon had suddenly appeared in the middle of the ferocious sea. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The slash and the ice crystals established an impenetrable zone in the canyon, allowing Mu Ningxue to stand her ground.

Mu Ningxue pointed the Willow Leaf Sword forward. A strange-shaped wind burst out of its tip and grew to a width of several hundred meters!

The wind turned into a terrifying shredder. It pierced through the waves the Sea Skeleton King had Summoned and tore into the enormous creature again.

The Sea Skeleton King was the size of a mountain, but the wind still knocked it a few steps back. It slammed heavily into the cliff, which almost collapsed into pieces.

“Such a brave and strong woman!” General Dong exclaimed.

He had thought these young Mages were here for a tour because Mu Ningxue was too pretty. Women like her could easily make a name by being actresses. Why would she be involved in a battle where she might be injured and killed at any time?

His impression of her changed when he saw her injure the Sea Skeleton King by herself and manage to hold her ground against the Sea Skeleton King’s attack. Most generals would feel ashamed of themselves.

“Mo Fan, you should really ask your woman to behave herself. Can’t she wait until we came up with a plan?” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

“Perhaps she’s tired of waiting for sissies like you,” Jiang Shaoxu mocked as she came from behind.

“Didn’t I ask you to stay?” Mo Fan said glaring at Lingling.

“It’s safe around here. The Sea Skeleton King is the only threat,” Lingling replied.

“What are you all waiting for? Mu Ningxue has already fought the Sea Skeleton King for several rounds!” Jiang Shaoxu scolded them.

Mo Fan had realized how comforting it was to have a valkyrie like Mu Ningxue on the team back when they were competing in the World College Tournament.

Mo Fan was a destructive Mage. Others filling the same role as him usually had to stay at the back and Channel their spells to deal destructive blows to the enemy when the time came.

However, Mo Fan had to take the lead to charge into the enemy line most of the time. Not only did he have to face the enemy’s attacks, he was responsible for dealing damage to the enemy, too. He was forced to be an all-arounder!

This time, he could Channel his spells with peace of mind while Mu Ningxue was keeping the enemy busy at the front!

He needed time to prepare either the ultimate of his Lightning Element or the flames of his Fire Element. Mo Fan just finished Channeling his Destructive Dragon Tail while the Sea Skeleton King was fully occupied with Mu Ningxue!

“Lightning Dragon Tail!”

Lightning was intertwining in the sky as if a lightning dragon was poking its tail out from the stormy clouds. It unleashed its wrath on the sea and the land!

Powerful blasts knocked the water into the sky as lightning strikes destroyed the black island. The Dragon Lightning Tail knocked the Sea Skeleton King to its knees.

Tons of seawater were falling off its disintegrating body, together with a thick and strange liquid which was likely to be the Sea Skeleton King’s blood.

Thick lightning was surging inside the Sea Skeleton King’s body like chains, revealing its internal structure.

The furious Sea Skeleton King had its back against the cliff. Lingling purposely went closer and stared at its backbone as it was highlighted by the lightning.

The flashes of lightning had revealed a strange shape on the Sea Skeleton King’s backbone. The observant Lingling had immediately realized it was an ancient Totem Seal!

“It’s a Totem Bone Seal!” Lingling blurted out in joy.

She subconsciously leaned closer. The destructive Aura of the Sea Skeleton King almost swept the little girl away. Apas pulled her back in the nick of time.

“Are you trying to get yourself killed?” Apas snarled at her

“Tell Mo Fan there’s a Totem Seal on the Sea Skeleton King’s neck!” Lingling said.
