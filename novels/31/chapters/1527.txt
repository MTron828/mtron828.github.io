Chad finally returned as everything inside the hall was about to turn into snakes in the eyes of everyone placed under the curse. However, he had a grim expression.

His first sentence stabbed everyone right in the heart. “He’s dead,” Chad reported.

“Is there any news worse than this?” Zoey sighed in dismay.

“He died to the Curse of the Eyes of Vengeance,” Chad’s brother Benz added.

“I was afraid that’s exactly what you were referring to...” Mo Fan muttered.

The group immediately fell silent. The atmosphere felt extremely weird.

“This won’t do, we can’t just sit here and do nothing!” Mentor Vani was the first to run out of patience.

They were currently in the hall of a hotel in a city, yet it felt like they were in a snake’s nest instead. He would rather take the initiative to get rid of the Curse rather than lose his mind to the constant fear.

“Let me ask General Fenna, I still have her contact number,” Zhao Manyan said.

“What? You were cursed by the eyes of a Medusa?” General Fenna was extremely surprised.

They had agreed to deal with Egypt’s undead together, but Mo Fan and his group were already on the verge of getting wiped out just after they had arrived in Cairo. It was the worst start they could hope for!

“Yeah, do you know how to get rid of the Curse? It’s too much of a torture; we’ve already stayed awake for the whole night, we couldn’t even get some rest,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Where are you guys? I’ll send someone over to pick you up,” General Fenna said.

“We are at Cairo Hotel...” Zhao Manyan glanced at the students of the European University Institute and after a slight hesitation, added, “You should send another car over. There are some unfortunate guys from the European University Institute that are in the same boat as us.”

“Got it!”

—

Fenna did not make them wait for too long. She sent four military jeeps to the bustling city centers. The jeeps brought them straight to the military town where high-rank commanders lived.

Cairo was still in the middle of a battle, so there were lots of people and cars along the way. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry.

Fenna had been promoted from a Lieutenant General to a General. She was capable of commanding and leading an army in a battle, and had a reputable status in Cairo now!

“What’s up with you guys? Didn’t I ask you all to stay in New Suez first?” General Fenna asked Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan with a confused look.

Mo Fan had already told General Fenna they were coming before taking the flight to Egypt. General Fenna also knew about the Great Pyramid of Giza showing up in China’s Beijiang. In order to resolve the conflict between the two kingdoms of undead, General Fenna still had to discuss the operation of invading the Pyramid with Mo Fan before making their move. However, before they could get down to business, Mo Fan had already found himself in deep trouble.

“It’s not like we want to be caught in this mess. I didn’t think the Medusae would be so narrow-minded,” Mo Fan said helplessly.

“How about them? Are they cursed by the Eyes of Vengeance too?” General Fenna glanced at the people of the European University Institute.

“Yes,” Vani said.

Vani had set aside the pride of a mentor of the European University Institute in front of General Fenna.

The role of a mentor greatly differed from the role of a general, even if their cultivation was on par with one another. The power and strength of a general clearly surpassed that of a teacher. After all, a general had risen from countless battles, while teachers were safe hiding in the cities...

“Can you tell us how we can get rid of the Curse first!?” Zhao Manyan spoke up quickly.

“The Eyes of Vengeance is a very tricky Curse. Normally, if anyone in our army is placed under the Curse, we will send them to the front line to fight for their glory,” General Fenna said.

“To the front line? Isn’t that basically asking them to die?” Mo Fan said.

“More or less. There are different Curses from the Eyes of Vengeance: the Life-Seizing Curse, the Shadow Curse, and the Enraging Curse!

“The Life-Seizing Curse is the quickest. No matter where you are, deadly snakes that latch on to every opportunity will devour their victim while they are asleep.

“The Shadow Curse is more like a spooky, hallucinating Curse. The victims under it will be very afraid of snakes. If the Curse continues for a long period of time, it will slowly drive the victims mad!

“The Enraging Curse is not as serious. The people under it are safe as long as they avoid encountering snakes, since they infuriate every snake they stumble into. All the snakes within ten kilometers will follow their scent and attack the victims relentlessly...” General Fenna was indeed more familiar with the Eyes of Vengeance than Chad.

“So, what is the Curse we are under? The Shadow Curse?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“It’s a little difficult to distinguish between the Shadow Curse and the Enraging Curse, since being placed under the Enraging Curse will inflict fear on the victims, too. Since you’ve survived the night, it shouldn’t be the Life-Seizing Curse. As for whether it’s the Shadow Curse or Enraging Curse, we’ll have to figure it out,” General Fenna said.

“So we won’t know how to get rid of the Curse until we know what it is?” Mo Fan asked.

“More or less. You have to prescribe the right medicine for an illness, the same goes for a Curse. If you mess it up, it might worsen the Curse... however, there’s something that can get rid of the Curse right away,” General Fenna said.

The middle-aged Lieutenant General beside General Fenna chuckled as soon as she mentioned the cure, “General, don’t tell me you’re suggesting these kids find the Tear of Medusa?”

“Tear of Medusa?” Mo Fan repeated.

“Yes, the Tear of Medusa. The Curse originates from Medusa, and it is said that her tears can get rid of the Curse she applies to humans. Leaving aside the fact that most creatures of a pure lineage of the Medusa are at the Ruler-level, it’s entirely impossible to get a demon creature to shed a tear,” General Fenna said.

“Is the Medusa you mentioned referring to the Mother of Snakes Medusa?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Of course not, there’s no way we humans stand a chance against Queen Medusa. I’m referring to those that have inherited Queen Medusa’s lineage. The Red Scorpion Gorgons, the Scorpion Lord Medusae, the Brown Ruler Medusae, and the Empress Medusae... these are all creatures with the pure lineage of Queen Medusa. They are her descendants,” General Fenna said.

The Egyptians referred to the first Medusa as the Mother of Snakes, while the military referred to her as Queen Medusa.

Queen Medusa was clearly beyond their reach. Even if they found Queen Medusa, there was no way she would shed a tear for the humans she hated the most. She might even burst out laughing after seeing humans dying to her Curse!

“So you’re saying that if we can find a medusa of the pure lineage of Queen Medusa and obtain its tear, we can get rid of the Curse?” Mo Fan summed it up.

“Yes, but the difficulty in doing so...” General Fenna nodded.

There were people that were placed under the same Curse among the soldiers, but few survived in the end. The Curse had been around in Egypt for ages. It was even referred to as AIDS from the Medusae, since there was no cure for it!

Many Mages would bring some protective charms along to prevent the Curse from befalling them. However, the Curse was beyond complicated. It was only meant to be unleashed through the power of Queen Medusa’s lineage, yet for some reason, even the big female Medusae were granted the power!

It was an incurable Curse; many authorities in Egypt had died to it. General Fenna did not expect Mo Fan and the others to hit the devil’s jackpot just after they had arrived in Egypt. She did not know if she should be impressed by Mo Fan and his crew’s luck!

“Tear of Medusa... as long as we know there’s a way to get rid of it. Let’s find ourselves a Medusa. If it doesn’t want to shed a tear, we’ll beat it up until it does!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“You make it sound so easy, but every creature with the pure lineage of Queen Medusa is at least at the Ruler-level. I think you should spend your time on the things you’ve always wanted to do before the Curse worsens, so you won’t have any regrets,” the middle-aged Lieutenant General scoffed.

“Would you mind if I beat you up first?” Mo Fan grunted after hearing the scornful remark from the man.

“Kid, what did you say? Do you know who I am!?” Lieutenant General Punk exclaimed angrily.

A Lieutenant General’s rank was just below a General’s. In Punk’s eyes, they were just a bunch of kids, including the people from the European University Institute!

“That’s enough, Punk. Please be more polite to my friends,” General Fenna said.

“Humph, I didn’t want to waste my time on a bunch of kids. As for your proposal to the superiors... Fenna, I think you shouldn’t put too much hope on such a ridiculous plan. Putting aside the Chinese kingdom of undead’s true intention behind the invasion, how many rounds do you think China’s undead can last against the kingdom of undead of our country? The undead in Egypt has been around for so many years. They are strong enough to destroy an entire continent!” Punk brought his fists together. He had no intention to entertain them any further.

The people of the European University Institute were totally clueless about what Punk was referring to.

General Fenna frowned. She did not expect Punk to be so insensitive. How could he mention something so confidential now? Couldn’t he see there were outsiders here!?

“You should really request a different Lieutenant General. This guy is nothing but an idiot, it’s only a matter of time before he ruins your career,” Mo Fan said, watching Punk take his leave.

“It’s not like I can choose my Lieutenant General. I was appointed to take charge of Cairo not long ago. I still have to obey the orders of my superiors,” General Fenna said with a wry smile.

She did not mention the war between the kingdoms of undead. It was obviously a very difficult task that needed prolonged planning and discussions. Their priority now was to get rid of the Curse!

“Are there Medusae on the battlefield?” Mo Fan asked.

“Don’t even think about it. The Medusae are constantly followed around by a huge troop of Gorgons and Lamias. Even people like us will have trouble getting close to them, but you are in luck, I saw a Medusa that hasn’t matured yet around three days ago. A young Medusa isn’t as intelligent, so we might have a chance to acquire a teardrop from it...” General Fenna said.

“That’s great!” Vani let out a relieved sigh.

“Yeah, since we can’t take on a mature Medusa, we can pick on the young Medusae instead!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.
