Jiang Shaoxu was a Psychic Mage. She had wondered why the Frosty Ancient Eagles that had been picking their targets randomly had suddenly gathered above their team. She soon discovered the reason with her Psychic Magic!

They were provoked!

The Maga in a black and red outfit had directed the creatures’ hatred toward them. The number of the Frosty Ancient Eagles that were circling above the team had multiplied fourfold!

“Jiang Yu, watch out behind you!” Nanyu yelled. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jiang Yu was summoning his Beast Tide. Even though it was not as impressive as Mo Fan’s Beast Tide, it was still able to clear a path for the team. To his surprise, he felt a sudden great pain from his back as a sharp talon punctured his shoulder!

The Night Rakshasa quickly reacted by cutting through the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ nails.

Unfortunately, one of the talons still buried itself in Jiang Yu’s back. The Frosty Ancient Eagle dragged him into the sky.

The Night Rakshasa jumped into the air and sliced down like a black crescent!

Her sharp claws tore the Frosty Ancient Eagle in half. The Night Rakshasa was just a little flea compared to the Frosty Ancient Eagles, yet the strength stored in her petite body was enough to rip the Frosty Ancient Eagle to pieces!

The insides of the Frosty Ancient Eagle poured down from the sky. However, the detestable creature had tossed Jiang Yu higher into the sky prior to its death, passing him to its comrades.

The Night Rakshasa’s fur stood on its end when she did not see Jiang Yu fall down to safety. She moved like a black ray of light, bouncing off a Frosty Ancient Eagle that was gliding at a lower height to catch up with the other one that had caught Jiang Yu.

The Frosty Ancient Eagle was extremely quick, and beat its way into the sky after catching its prey. The Night Rakshasa was unable to fly. She could only bounce off the backs of the Frosty Ancient Eagles!

“They got Jiang Yu!” the slow-reacting Zhao Manyan finally yelled.

Ai Jiangtu had barely protected Jiang Shaoxu from the encirclement of the demon creatures. The expression in his eyes shifted when he saw his team member being dragged into the sky. However, as he was about to chase after Jiang Yu, several layers of wings came and intercepted him!

“That b**ch, if anything happens to Jiang Yu, she’s going to pay with her life!” Jiang Shaoxu cursed.

Jiang Shaoxu had the Psychic Element too. Would she be afraid to pull off dirty tricks like the woman had done to them!?

Since the woman had set them up first, Jiang Shaoxu was not going to show them any mercy!

Jiang Shaoxu cast the same spell, Spirit Ripple, and inflicted fear on the beast hordes that were fleeing for their lives.

The beast hordes had been avoiding the team after they were hindered by Mo Fan’s Beast Tide. The fear that Jiang Shaoxu inflicted on them drove the creatures that were approaching the Mailong Private Military Group to charge toward the Savage Raptor Hunter Group instead.

The woman was focusing on directing the anger of the Frosty Ancient Eagles towards the other groups. Little did she know, the beast hordes that were carrying Jiang Shaoxu’s rage were already heading her way!

“I can’t fly up there. How are we supposed to save Jiang Yu!?” Zhao Manyan swore. He could not see Jiang Yu anywhere above them.

Many Frosty Ancient Eagles had shown up so suddenly. Their team was struggling to fend them off.

“The Night Rakshasa can’t fly. She’s going to be in danger if she keeps forcing her way up!” Nanyu exclaimed.

While everyone was worried about Jiang Yu, several Icecloud Jellyfish appeared out of nowhere. They were able to attach themselves to other creatures and devour them, rendering their abilities useless.

The Icecloud Jellyfish were very aggressive. Over half of the Frosty Ancient Eagles quickly fell victim to them. A strong gust of wind rose into the sky and shattered the Frosty Ancient Eagles that had been targeted by the Icecloud Jellyfish.

Broken ice poured down like crystal rain. An alluring figure hovered between the Icecloud Jellyfish and the wind, her silver hair drifting elegantly.

“Thousand Leaves Saber!”

The figure spun around like a dancer, firing blue gusts of wind in all directions.

A single wind slash might not be enough to penetrate the Frosty Ancient Eagle’s sturdy feathers, but what about hundreds, or even thousands of them?

The Frosty Ancient Eagles turned into a bloody mist, and their lifeblood poured down like rain. The Thousand Leaves Saber returned to Mu Ningxue’s hands after annihilating all the creatures within a kilometer, combining into a magical wind sword!

“Slaughtering Wind Slash!”

A blue line sprang into the clear sky. The Frosty Ancient Eagle that had captured Jiang Yu suddenly froze in midair. Its body fell apart, sliced perfectly in half, just before they started falling.

Jiang Yu was falling to the ground. Mu Ningxue observed everything before glancing at the Night Rakshasa, telling her, “He’s all yours.”

The Night Rakshasa put on a grateful face. She ran swiftly toward the spot Jiang Yu was falling to.

The Night Rakshasa was quite small, like an insignificant hare in the eyes of the enormous creatures, and was able to move freely amid the chaotic battle. No creature would bother wasting their time on her.

“Jiang Yu’s armor can withstand the attacks of a Ruler-level creature. He should be fine,” Guan Yu said.

“He was lucky that the Frosty Ancient Eagle died before it reached its nest. Otherwise, he would be dead even if he was wearing indestructible Armor!” Zhao Manyan let out a relieved sigh. He glanced at Mu Ningxue, who brought such a bloodbath to the Frosty Ancient Eagles, and exclaimed, “The Goddess is as reliable as usual when it counts! Look at Mo Fan, he might have seven Elements, but he didn’t even use a lot of them!”

“I can only fight on land. Those in the water and in the sky are out of my reach. However, if any of you are killed on the land, I’ll bury myself next to you!” Mo Fan lost his calm after hearing Zhao Manyan’s comment.

How were the creatures in the sky his problem? It was not his fault that he could not fly!

He was not a f**king swan. Did people seriously expect him to be able to fight in the air, on the ground, and in the water?

“Jiang Yu is the first person to reach the mountain!” Zhao Manyan noted wryly.

“You can go ahead and ask the Frosty Ancient Eagles to give you a ride too!” Nanyu scoffed.

“Friends, how should we make that b**ch pay?” Jiang Shaoxu was still irritated.

If the woman had not sent the Frosty Ancient Eagles to them, Jiang Yu’s life would not have been in danger.

“I’m used to stirring up trouble even when people aren’t messing with me, let alone when they do... was she trying to set us up? We’ll make her pay then!” Mo Fan declared.
