The Mountain Zombie took a step forward. Its movement was fairly slow, yet each step it took brought it much closer to the city.

The head in the rain was moving closer. Somehow, the creature had already advanced over ten kilometers. If there was anything providing some relief to the humans, it would be the discovery that the creature halted its movement for some reason around ten kilometers away from the walls.

A fat Corpse Official, looking like a lump of flesh, stood close to the creature’s feet. Its size was like a hill, yet it only reached to just below the Mountain Zombie’s knees.

The Flesh Mound Corpse Official had a giant mouth. It opened its mouth and swallowed the surrounding skeletons, zombies and phantoms inside. It managed to hold more than a thousand undead!

Mo Fan did not dare to watch any further upon seeing this. Even though he was clueless about why the Corpse Official was eating the undead, there was no time for him to think about it. He had to find Liu Ru, Zhang Xiaohou, and the others as soon as possible, and retreat to the inner walls together!

“Mo Fan, what should we do now?” Zhou Ming glanced at Mo Fan with a hint of panic.

“Come with me,” said Mo Fan sternly.

“I must go to Bo City Street. I don’t want to be involved in the same thing twice,” Mu Bai said in a deep voice.

“Yeah, Mo Fan, we can’t leave them behind,” said Zhou Ming.

“Mm, let’s head to Bo City Street first,” Mo Fan nodded.

As Mu Bai had stated, the people of Bo City had already gone through a similar disaster once. They had barely survived the first time; it would be too cruel if they died in this one!

Mo Fan knew he could only bring a limited number of people along. However, since Zhang Xiaohou and Liu Ru were going in the same direction too, he could not leave them behind!

“Count me in,” Shorty said to Mo Fan, slowly getting to his feet.

Mo Fan glanced at Shorty, who was still overwhelmed with grief, and nodded.

It seemed like he had thought it through. The dead could not be resurrected. It was important to look after himself in chaos like this, before he had the ability to look after others.

“Then let’s hurry up! A bunch of undead that was roaming close to the walls has already invaded the city. The walls were heavily damaged, more undead are going to break through. Mu Bai, do you have any relatives in City North?” said Zhou Ming.

“Only my uncle, but I believe he’s quite close to the inner walls. He mentioned that he was heading into the inner walls to attend to some business,” said Mu Bai.

“Mm, that’s good to know. To Bo City Street, let’s hope they are not too scattered across the place!”

“Bo City Street is a fair distance away from the inner walls. With how the traffic is tied-up now, they won’t be able to reach the inner walls safely,” the worried Zhou Ming told him.

Transportation was completely at a standstill. Even Magicians were forced to travel on foot.

Even with Wind Magicians, everyone was still moving slowly. Meanwhile, the undead that had invaded the city were chasing after them at full speed. These bloodthirsty creatures would simply chase after anything alive and tear them apart. Fresh blood mixed with rain soon dyed the area close to the beleaguered walls red.

Several teams of Magicians were evacuating the civilians, yet regardless of how hard they were blasting the undead with Magic, the undead were rushing into the city through the gap faster than they were dying. The Battlemages were gradually losing ground...

Although it did help slow down the invasion, Mo Fan was well aware that those fighting could at most buy a little time for the civilians.

When the Nether Bone Ruler’s army of skeletons or the Mountain Zombie’s tide of zombies arrived, every Magician would be torn into pieces...

Mo Fan, Zhou Ming, Mu Bai, and Shorty hurried over to Bo City Street. Everyone in the group was an Intermediate Magician, thus they were a lot fitter than the commoners. Since the streets were stuffed full of cars and fleeing crowds, the roofs became their path instead. The densely packed buildings allowed them to run along the walls and travel across rooftops.

“Mo Fan, isn’t your energy fully recovered yet? I’ve got some serums here that will help your recovery,” Mu Bai took out some serums he had brought along and handed them to Mo Fan.

“Thanks a lot!” Mo Fan was in dire need of energy.

As a Magician with four Elements, he had twice the amount of energy compared to an ordinary Magician, so it was rare for him to deplete his energy. Luckily, he had retreated to the walls with Yao Nan earlier, allowing him to rest up for a little bit. Otherwise, his energy would be pretty much empty now. He would most likely die to the undead, let alone be able to save others.

As they passed by the hospital that was bulldozed to the ground, Mo Fan purposely glanced at Shorty.

Shorty did not hesitate at all. It was clear that he had experienced situations of life and death too often. He had only lost his mind just then because it was someone extremely important to him.

There was nothing Shorty could do after a person’s death. Since he was still alive, he had to try his best to stay that way.

“At our speed, we should be able to retreat to the inner walls before this whole place is overrun by the undead,” said Shorty.

Shorty was more familiar with the Ancient Capital than anyone else there. With him leading the way, the group would reach Bo City Street in the shortest time, and could escort the people of Bo City to the safe zone.

“That’s a relief. I feel sorry for the people that live close to the outer walls...” Zhou Ming was full of sorrow as she witnessed the death of countless innocent people.

It was likely that in less than an hour after the purple alert was sounded, the casualties close to the outer walls had already surpassed the total casualties of the calamity of Bo City. On top of that, the number was increasing rapidly as they spoke!

“What’s that thing in the sky!”

“Is that a lump of meat? How is it as huge as a building?”

“It has eyes, oh my, it looks so terrifying...”

The crowd on the streets cried in panic, prompting the others to raise their heads and stare at the giant object sweeping past in the sky above the buildings!

Mo Fan also raised his head and discovered the giant lump of flesh just as it crashed onto the intersection not far away, like a meaty meteorite.

The intersection was full of vehicles, but when the lump of flesh landed on the ground, it occupied the entire intersection, smashing the surrounding buildings into pieces with the impact!

Mo Fan stared at the giant mound of flesh in astonishment... the thing looked very familiar to him! Wasn’t it the Flesh Mound Corpse Official that ate more than a thousand undead close to the Mountain Zombie’s feet from before!?

The Flesh Mound Corpse Official had dropped out of the sky. Did that mean the Mountain Zombie had tossed it into the city... that creature was more than ten kilometers away!

As Mo Fan watched stunned with wide eyes, a bad feeling crossed his heart...

As he thought, the Flesh Mound Corpse General that he was staring at suddenly opened its mouth, and the countless skeletons, zombies, and phantoms it had eaten before burst out from its stomach like a surging tide!

The streets promptly filled with screams. The crowd that had finally started to retreat in order began to panic again, trampling, shoving and pushing one another...

Mo Fan was aghast!

He looked up into the sky. The same kinds of giant Flesh Mound Corpse Generals were hurtling in from the distance and crashing into city randomly, like great bombs of flesh!

Mo Fan felt his scalp going numb. No one expected that the Mountain Zombie would simply toss these Flesh Mound Corpse Generals into the city, transporting thousands of undead onto the streets...

It was going to deal a deadly blow to the civilians who were fleeing for their lives!
