Chapter 2806: Returning To The Ancient Capital

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Mo Fan had to venture outside once again. He found himself to be a true wandering child. He had never stayed in his house comfortably for a full month. He had to pack his stuff again.

There was no choice. He was born in a tumultuous world, and he had to save it.

He envied the Marvel superheroes. After the superheroes received their supernatural powers, they could immediately stand up to fight the crisis. Their innate abilities were sufficient to take on the disasters that befell their world.

However, there was no such thing in the country. They had to stand up to fight for the country whenever they were needed. Besides, they had to learn their skills from scratch. They had to work hard for their cultivation.

The road of cultivation alone was long and hard. It had to be so refined that each level of improvement had to be enumerated. Furthermore, after they advanced to a new level with great pains, they thought they could settle the crisis with their new level of power. Unfortunately, reality showed them that their abilities were never enough to solve anything.

Perhaps, everyone had a different concept about their own world.

In some people’s world, they had a small family. However, in some other people’s world, the city meant everything to them. To some people, the world was everything to them.

There were different levels of difficulties. Protecting one’s own family might seem difficult, but when one must protect an entire country, that was a whole new level of struggle.

…

Mo Fan had a nice habit of informing about his family before every departure.

After bidding farewell to Xinxia and Mu Ningxue, Mo Fan dialed the number of the British Fanxue Mountain Chamber of Commerce.

“Dad, you seem to have adapted well to living overseas. You don’t look like you’re coming back anytime soon. Are you going to find me a stepmother from London?” asked Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was always informal with his father. Mo Jiaxin had never taken his blunt words to heart.

“Nonsense! There’s nothing much for me to do at Fanxue Mountain. There’s a shortage of manpower here, so I decided to stay here with Big Brother Zhuoyun. Even so, I’ve a better knowledge about the ins and outs of Fanxue Mountain than you. I’m aware of its imported and exported goods, selling prices and partnerships!” Mo Jiaxin said impatiently.

“Fine. Anyway, I heard about the presence of Ocean Demons in London. Northern Ice Abyss Beasts frequently appeared in Norway. Several large ships drowned. Also, several cities suffered different degrees of destruction. Even England is in the middle of preparation for war,” Mo Fan warned Mo Jiaxin.

Ocean coverage accounted for more than seventy percent of the Earth. Most of the affluent countries could not separate themselves from the ocean. They were in a dire situation.

“I often see groups of Dragon Rider mages flying in the sky in London. I suspect something big is about to happen. We’re already used to it. After all, we don’t run away from minor disasters, and we can’t run away from big disasters. So, we might as well do our parts,” said Mo Jiaxin.

“Make sense. I have to go to Northern Xinjiang and will likely spend a long time there. This time, I’m going to search for something related to our hometown,” Mo Fan told Mo Jiaxin everything.

“Okay. Be careful. I’m going to Greece in a couple of days. I’ll pay a visit to Xinxia when I’m on my way there.”

“Okay, Xinxia told me about it.”

…

After Mo Jiaxin hung up, he tossed his mobile phone to the side and continued to fix the vines of the China Roses on the wall. Although the China Roses were not as stunning and delicate as ordinary roses, they were always easier to maintain.

“Young Brother Mo, why haven’t you packed your stuff yet?” Mu Zhuoyun stared at Mo Jiaxin in confusion. He was still trimming the plants at his leisure.

“Why do I have to pack my stuff?”

“We’re going to Greece. The trip is ahead of schedule. Aren’t you aware of it?” asked Mu Zhuoyun.

“Oh dear! My memory fails me. Wait for a while, I’m almost done.” Mo Jiaxin put down his scissors. He turned back and looked at the climbing flowers.

He wondered if the plants would still be alive by the time he returned.

…

The Green East Sea God’s flying speed exceeded the Wind Roarasaurus. Although the Ancient Capital was very far, they arrived at their destination in a short period of time. They barely finished playing more than two rounds of cards.

Moreover, the Green East Sea God’s wings were furry. Its back was wide. Sitting on its back was more comfortable than a first-class seat on an airplane. Besides, they could enjoy a 180-degree panoramic sky view without any obstruction.

Although Mo Fan possessed Wings of Dawn and Dusk and that his flying ability was as good as the Green East Sea God, why bother to do the extra work unnecessarily?

When they landed at the Ancient Capital, they noticed that it had been reconstructed. Without the Undeads’ threat, the capital had become most of the coastal migrants’ first choice.

Mo Fan was relieved to see the Ancient Capital so prosperous. He had witnessed the disaster with his own eyes. He had thought that the capital was going to perish. It was a pleasant surprise to see it prosperous and lively.

When they arrived at the Ancient Capital, a person came to receive them.

That person was none other than the thousand-year-old female haunted spirit that lived in the body of another girl. She wore traditional Tang attire, and her face was as pale as a ghost.

“Have you resurrected in a new body?” Mo Fan recognized that she was the Queen of Nine Serenities.

“The girl often stays at home and plays online games. She’s the reason for her current look. Even a ghost looks better than her. I cannot find a suitable body to possess, so I have to temporarily use her body. Also, it’s a bonus that I can make her come out of her house and see the sunlight. I mean, look at her! Youngsters these days are so unhealthy. She is worse than me and I am a ghost!” The Queen of Nine Serenities complained.

The young girl was filled with Yin energy and was suitable for the Queen of Serenities to use as its host.

“I didn’t quite understand about the things you told me hastily on the phone,” Mo Fan said to the Queen of Nine Serenities.

“Guys, don’t keep talking among yourself! Mo Fan, why don’t you introduce me to the beautiful woman next to you?” Zhao Manyan drew close to Mo Fan while fixing his gaze on the Queen of Nine Serenities.

Although the girl looked as pale as a ghost, she was indeed a beauty.

The Queen of Nine Serenities was obsessed with beauty. She usually selected hosts who were beautiful.

“She is…”

“Hi, I’m Zhao Xiaotian. I’m a modern poet. The Ancient Capital provides such a pleasant living environment that it could produce a lovely lady like you. The Ancient Capital is not so ancient, after all.” Zhao Manyan quickly took over the conversation.

“Hohoho! You’re such a handsome scum!” The Queen of Nine Serenities laughed so hard that her body trembled.

Zhao Manyan was dumbfounded. He wondered why the young girl behaved so oddly. ‘Am I really a scum?’

“You’re a bit weak, Otherwise, you’ll make a perfect candidate with Yang energy.” The Queen of Nine Serenities stared at him.

Zhao Manyan was speechless.
