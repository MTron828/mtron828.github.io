“I think it’s fine. Either way, we should bring it out immediately,” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

The thing would be convincing proof. Mochizuki Chihaya could report it to her superior and accuse Commander Takagi of his selfish act to free her brother Iwata.

“Chihaya, you better think twice about it,” said Mo Fan sternly.

“What do you mean?” Mochizuki Chihaya looked at Mo Fan in confusion. Her eyes flickered alertly.

She was still not too familiar with Mo Fan’s character, and it was normal for anyone to be interested in the orb. She was worried that Mo Fan was blinded by greed too.

“Don’t look at me like that. I do admit that I was quite intrigued before seeing the Essence Orb, since I also have a Summoned Beast. However, I no longer have the thought after I saw it. I wouldn’t even take it for free,” said Mo Fan.

“What are you trying to say?” Mochizuki Chihaya did not understand.

“I already told you, this thing is too evil!” said Mo Fan.

“I’m not planning to keep it, I’m just going to hand it to Osaka’s Magic Association, or the government, as long as my brother will no longer suffer in the East Guardian Tower.” Mochizuki Chihaya sounded quite agitated.

She had been extremely close to her brother since they were young. On top of that, they shared flowers of the same stem, which further deepened the bond between them.

She was more familiar with what kind of a place the East Guardian Tower was than anyone else. How could she possibly let her brother Iwata suffer for such a long time here?

“I’m only keeping you company until you’ve confirmed that your brother is imprisoned here. As for the orb, take it if you want, I won’t stop you, but don’t drag me into the mess,” said Mo Fan.

“Mmm, either way, I’m grateful for your help. It means a lot, thank you.”

Mo Fan did not respond. He saw Mochizuki Chihaya stow the orb away with an expressionless face.

——

It was not difficult to leave the East Guardian Tower. They were not many guards inside, and it was impossible for outsiders to come in. Considering how security was established, the unconscious guards would only be discovered when the guards for the next shift arrived. Mo Fan and Mochizuki Chihaya were able to return the same way they came.

They parted ways at the bottom of the mountain. Mo Fan was still feeling uncomfortable seeing Mochizuki Chihaya hurrying toward Osaka.

“Little Loach, something is seriously wrong about that thing, right?” mumbled Mo Fan as he glanced at his chest.

The Little Loach Pendant had acute senses. If the Essence Orb was useful, the Little Loach Pendant would have eaten it in a single bite to grow stronger. However, when Mo Fan approached the Essence Orb, he felt a strong disgust rising from the Little Loach Pendant, directed at the orb!

Therefore, Mo Fan was convinced that the orb was extremely dangerous!

It was normal for humans to be greedy. Mo Fan admitted that he was the kind who would pounce on a treasure as soon as he spotted one. However, it was necessary to be smart when being greedy, too. Mo Fan somehow felt that the Essence Orb was like Pandora’s box!

The uneasy feeling grew stronger when he looked in the direction Mochizuki Chihaya was disappearing into and captured a glimpse of a shadowy aura surrounding her.

“Little Loach, do you think daddy has made a huge mistake?” Mo Fan started murmuring again.

——

The light of the moon was blocked by the clouds. The night was pitch-black, and even the brilliance of the stars had disappeared.

The modern city of Osaka was brightly lit up, even though it was now late at night. However, the neon lights in the city did not light up the night sky as usual, but seemed to be absorbed by the thick darkness.

Tall buildings, cars whooshing past, a group of drunk young adults with dyed hair were stirring a up great scene on the street. The pedestrians immediately avoided them.

“Since when have I been sad for a bitch, how ridiculous, look at the pretty girls on the street, they are my prey now, HAHAHA!” a golden-haired man slurred as he staggered along.

His friends tried to give him support, yet he simply pushed them aside.

“I don’t need you meddling in my business, I can walk myself... not only can I walk, I’m going to scold the hell out of that bitch. Oh, there she is, bitch, I’m not someone you can dump so easily, come here!” Chao Gang pointed at a woman in a tight, black outfit.

The woman continued forward without giving Chao Gang any attention.

The woman’s cold temperament infuriated the man, as the woman who made him drunk also had the same temperament. Chao Gang immediately went up to the woman and yelled, “Don’t you run away from me!”

“Piss off!” Mochizuki Chihaya’s eyes chilled. A demon branch as thick as an adult’s waist suddenly appeared by her foot.

The demon tree lashed forward at Chao Gang, who was blocking her path. Chao Gang was just an ordinary human. The hit immediately sent him flying onto the road.

A huge truck was passing by. The driver panicked when he saw someone flying onto the road. Luckily, he was an experienced driver and subconsciously stepped hard on the brake!

Chao Gang’s friends were stunned. One of the women screamed at the top of her lungs.

The truck quickly slowed down in front of Chao Gang, yet it still drove over one of his legs. The agonized cry of the drunk man immediately filled the street. The great pain instantly sobered him up.

Mochizuki Chihaya did not bother looking at Chao Gang. She headed straight toward one of the buildings.

The path had flowers and plants along it, yet when the woman walked past them, the flowers immediately wilted and the plants dried up.

The street lamps were strangely dim, as if the light was being sucked away by something, making it difficult for the light to travel further. The modern street was covered in an eerie, black aura.

“Someone call an ambulance!”

“That woman is out of her mind!”

“She’s a Magician...”

“Even if she’s a Magician, she has no right to hurt someone like that. The Enforcement Union will punish an evil Magician like her!”

The pedestrians cried out. Some that were righteous followed closely behind Mochizuki Chihaya.

They were in Osaka, a city with a legal system. Even Magicians had to be punished after committing criminal offenses!

Mochizuki Chihaya continued to walk forward and stood in front of the building.

She seemed to be aware of the people following behind her and pointing at her. She quickly turned around and stared at the people menacingly!

Someone noticed that the reflection of the woman on the French windows of the building was completely different than her look. It was a terrifying black figure with tentacles covered in a red glow!

The figure standing on the street was a woman, yet the reflection on the windows was a terrifying demon. The pedestrians screamed out in panic after witnessing the unbelievable sight!
