Chapter 378: The Angry Crowd, Kill the Snake!

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

“This...” Mo Fan could not believe what he saw.

“Lightning Punishment Formation-The Seal of Nine Laws! It’s a Lightning Element Super Magic. Once it’s fully established, its power is strong enough to trap a Ruler-level demon beast. Councilman Luo Mian and Councilman Zhu Meng have long prepared for this. They have been planning to kill the Black Totem Snake all along,” said Leng Qing, who was standing beside him.

The lightning struck the Black Totem Snake like merciless whips. The Black Totem Snake had just gotten rid of his most important layer of defense recently, thus he was experiencing tremendous pain. Each bolt of lightning left a deep wound on his body.

He did not give up. He opened his mouth wide and bit on one of the lightning halberds, trying to break it into pieces. However, the lightning turned out to be stronger, penetrating his throat and entering his esophagus. It electrified his inner organs and dealt a great blow to him.

An ordinary Commander-level demon beast would simply be shattered into pieces by the powerful blow. However, the Skyscraping Snake was still able to gather his strength and tore at the lightning halberd once again. In the end, the shock from the lightning paralyzed him, but he was reluctant to give up.

He was infuriated like a tyrant, glaring at the two humans who were responsible. He wanted to escape from the formation just to swallow them into his stomach!

He grew more savage as more wounds began to appear on his body. He was utterly fearless, even if he was facing the extremely destructive Lightning Spell. He wanted to destroy everything, to destroy the lightning that dared to infuriate him!

“Stop it now, I beg you please, stop it!” Tangyue pleaded desperately.

Each time the Black Totem Snake was struck by a lightning bolt, Tangyue could sense her heart being struck by a great blow.

“Begging for mercy?” Councilman Zhu Meng blurted out coldly. He glanced at the terrifying people in the distance who were gathering at the shores around the lake and pointed with his finger. A rather huge crowd had already gathered there.

“Why are you doing this!” snapped Tangyue.

Councilman Zhu Meng was expressionless. He opened his mouth and uttered with a thunderous voice facing the busy city, “People of Hangzhou City, this is the snake beast that appeared before in the city. He is also the source of the plague. He is now residing in West Lake. Unfortunately, some people treated him as a god, thus insisting on protecting him! Today, I, Zhu Meng have decided to eliminate him once and for all to prevent disasters like this from happening in the future. If you agree with me, please let me hear your voice!”

Zhu Meng’s voice was extremely clear, as if it had spread to every little corner in the city. He had used some Magic that Mo Fan had never seen before.

On the other side of the lake, although the Su Causeway was quite a distance away from the shore where the crowd was, as the number of people increased, the crowd suddenly became rather obvious from the distance. Their faces were filled with astonishment, although most of them were still overwhelmed with fear of the unknown beast.

The crowd consisted of students of Magic Schools, ordinary businessmen, old folks who were passing by, normal civilians and quite a number of Magicians who were pursuing justice. They could not believe such a gigantic beast had been residing so close to their city. If they had not seen it with their own eyes today, they would never have believed it to be the truth.

The crowd was terrified and furious. They felt like someone had lied to them, someone who could not care less about their lives!

“Kill him! We have to kill him!”

“How could we possibly let something like that to stay in West Lake. Kill him now!”

“So he is the cause of the plague! He is a great threat to us!”

The voices of the crowd stacked upon one another, echoing across the lake loud and clear at the causeway.

“No, that’s not the truth. He’s not the cause of the plague. He’s actually the guardian of the city. You can’t hurt him!” Tangyue screamed loudly on Su Causeway.

However, her voice alone was no match against the voices of the crowd. Even if her pleading could be heard by the people, they would not show any hint of mercy. Their hearts were overwhelmed with fear and anger. Similar to Councilman Zhu Meng, they only wanted to drive the beast away from their city.

The protests grew louder gradually...

The Black Totem Snake was covered all over with cuts and bruises. His unyielding gaze began to show a hint of fatigue.

He was getting too weak. He was already suffering a punishment from the law of nature due to the ecdysis, and now he was trapped within the destructive lightning formation established by the humans. He no longer had the same spirit of trying to break free from the formation. The lightning bolts continued to strike him recklessly.

He could hear the voices of the crowd coming from the shore. As a matter of fact, he was not too bothered. He endured the pain from the shock of the lightning and slowly turned his head around toward Tangyue.

Tangyue was kneeling helplessly on the edge of the causeway. She seemed extremely tiny in comparison to the rage of the crowd.

If it weren’t for her, the Black Totem Snake would never have left the safest hiding spot during his weakest period.

He had existed for many centuries, thus he was surely more intelligent than humans. He had total trust in her, and yet...she had let him down!

Seeing the bruises and wounds on the Black Totem Snake’s body, whose eyes displayed a hint of fatigue and disappointed, she felt like he was asking her, why had she let him down!

Tangyue was full of tears. There was nothing she could do. She was surrounded by Magicians who were stronger then she was, and the shore was crowded with people demanding the death of the snake. What could she possibly do?

Mo Fan clearly heard her sobs. Similarly, there was nothing Mo Fan could do.

The people of the city were already trapped by the fear of the snake and the plague. Once they found the source of the plague, they would only follow their instincts.

Councilman Zhu Meng was doing something that perfectly suited their requests. Mo Fan believed that he would soon obtain the support of the people of Hangzhou City. No one would care about the despair that one woman was currently suffering.

“Careful, he’s trying to barge out with brute force!” yelled the Head of the Royal Guards, Wu Pingjing. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan collected his thoughts and saw that the Black Totem Snake, still being tortured tremendously by the lightning, trying to poke his giant head out from the formation.

The wild lightning bolts struck his head fiercely, and yet he continued to charge forward as if he were already numb.

He extended his head as close as possible to the causeway. The Judges of the Magic Court and the Royal Guards quickly backed off. Despite being trapped within the Lightning Punishment Formation, the Black Totem Snake was still very intimidating!

As the people assumed that the Black Totem Snake was desperately trying to break free with his last effort, he slowly moved his head toward Tangyue who was kneeling on the ground in despair...

The snake gently hissed, poking his tongue out from his mouth.

The tip of the tongue appeared in front of Tangyue and gently fondled her face.

Tangyue was stunned.

The tongue was extremely gentle, like a father trying to wipe the tears off her face.

Tangyue raised her head, glancing at the giant head. She stared into the snake’s eyes, which had a gentle look despite the pain and torture he had suffered, before glancing at the tongue which had fondled her face gently. He was trying to comfort her!

At that instant, Tangyue completely broke down and burst out in tears!
