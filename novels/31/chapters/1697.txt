Chapter 1698: Let’s Go to the Bedroom

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Mo Fan was in a terrible mood after learning he was not going to stay in the same room with Mu Ningxue. If he could not sleep on the same bed as Mu Ningxue, even the most luxurious house was no better than sleeping outdoors on a mat!

Mo Fan had worked so hard to achieve his goals, yet he still could not convince Mu Ningxue. However, he was an unyielding man, especially when it came to carrying on his ancestral line!

“It’s a little stuffy today, let’s go for a swim. It’s a pity if the huge swimming pool is only there to collect the reflection of the stars,” Mo Fan said.

“I have some other matters to attend to, why don’t you...” Mu Ningxue shook her head. How could she not know what Mo Fan was thinking of?

“You will never finish handling the matters. Besides, I do have something to give you, but it’s too enclosed here. Let’s go for a swim, I need some practice too!” Mo Fan said.

Practice swimming?

Mu Ningxue was speechless that Mo Fan had come up with such a lousy excuse. She hesitated when she looked into Mo Fan’s eyes.

“Let’s go, right, you need your swimsuit... oh, it doesn’t matter actually,” Mo Fan did not give Mu Ningxue any time to think. He quickly dragged her outside.

The pool had a private area, but it was connected to the public pool, too.

However, the core members of the Fanxue Mountain were extremely busy with their jobs. It was rare for them to come back to the Fanxue Villa once every week, so it did not matter if the pool was public or private. It was unlikely that anyone would go for a swim so late at night, anyway.

Mu Ningxue only returned after a while, since she insisted on changing into her swimsuit. Mo Fan waited patiently at the pool. His eyes glittered like they were implanted with titanium alloy when he saw her outline under the dim light!

However, Mo Fan was slightly disappointed when Mu Ningxue came closer. She had a towel around herself.

The towel was covering her bust well, but her collarbones and shoulders were exposed. Mo Fan immediately recalled the night she had worn the black skirt in Greece. He had fallen for her tender neck and shoulders instantly!

How could they be so smooth and fair? The look in his eyes alone was a clear indication of his urge to undress the beauty in front of him and feast on her like a starving wolf!

“What did you want to give me?” Mu Ningxue was a little curious. It was not the first time Mo Fan had mentioned it.

“You should take off...(cough cough), let’s go for a swim first,” Mo Fan said.

Mu Ningxue placed the towel on the chair and stood on her toes, displaying her alluring physique. Mo Fan thought Mu Ningxue would be a little hesitant, yet he was taken by surprise when she took off the towel so quickly. He immediately studied her closely...

Such a pity that she wasn’t wearing a bikini...

However, the dark blue breast wrap and the little swimming trunk were just perfect. They did not have any fancy patterns, yet their simple and elegant style was enough to make Mo Fan’s blood boil!

When a man was being tempted, he would have a little angel and imp whispering in his mind. If that saying was applied to Mo Fan’s thoughts, what was happening in his mind would be as follows:

The little imp exclaimed, “Let’s be a monster! We’ll pounce on her tonight!”

The little angel replied angrily, “Are you stupid? Let’s do it now, there’s no one around!”

Mu Ningxue walked to the edge of the pool and dove elegantly into the water. The cool water might provide her with some cover. Otherwise, someone was going to explode on the spot!

“Quick, just go for it, what are you waiting for?” the imp said.

“Why are you running? Use Blink, why did you learn magic for? You idiot!” the angel said.

Mo Fan chased after Mu Ningxue. His dream of having intimacy with his goddess was finally coming true!

He walked closer to Mu Ningxue. The gentle ripples struck Mo Fan on the chest. The water was just below Mu Ningxue’s neck. He could see the droplets sliding down along the tender skin of her shoulders...

Mo Fan strode forward and grabbed Mu Ningxue before she could swim away. He did not give the little fish the chance to run away.

“Can I kiss you?” Mo Fan asked.

The imp and the angel immediately went berserk when he asked the question!

“Why the hell do you even ask that for? Just kiss her!”

“Holy crap, can you please show us your resolution as a man? Just pull her into your arms and kiss her. Aren’t you giving her the chance to reject you if you ask her first? Why are we two stuck with an idiot like you!?”

Mo Fan had no idea what he was doing either. Both his rationality and impulses were urging him to do it. His dream girl was standing right in front of him without resisting or trying to run away. He was about to fulfill the dream that he had held for many years, yet he still thought he should be polite and act like a gentleman.

Mu Ningxue’s glittering eyes flickered with amusement. She rarely saw Mo Fan with such a blank face. He had always been sanguine and unpredictable, but he was being so cautious all of a sudden...

Mu Ningxue did not answer his question. She took a little step closer to Mo Fan and stood on her toes.

She leaned closer. Their lips touched softly. Her lips were cold, just like last time, but they were soft and moist. Their bodies were soaked in cold water. Mo Fan immediately felt a soothing chill wrapping around him as Mu Ningxue took the initiative to give him a surprise kiss. It was so comfortable that he subconsciously closed his eyes.

Mo Fan was definitely not a retard. She was the goddess he had dreamed of getting his hands on for so long. He began to wrap his hands around Mu Ningxue’s waist after paying his respects.

Her waist was not covered by any clothes, and her skin was softened by the water. The sensation was absolutely perfect. She might be skinny, but her skin was soft and bouncy. He wanted to squeeze her waist tightly, yet he was afraid that he might snap it in half.

The kiss went from a little peck to a lustful French kiss. He tugged Mu Ningxue closer, leaving no gap between them. The little angel and imp in Mo Fan’s mind were long gone. He no longer needed their guidance for the next steps. He had practiced it so many times in his imagination, he just needed to follow his instincts.

Mu Ningxue was panicking a little now. She felt a numbing shock from the tip of her tongue. It was spreading quickly to every part of her body. She did feel like she was losing her strength, especially from the sense of suffocation for being too close to the man, and the strong grip behind her waist and her neck, even though it was not as exaggerated as the novels had described.

Frost began to spread across the rippling water close to Mu Ningxue, turning into ice in just seconds.

The ice spread from the center of the pool to one end. The water had frozen completely.

Nirvana Ice was Mu Ningxue’s Innate Talent. It could be described as Ice Elves that were constantly circling her. They would freeze everything nearby whenever Mu Ningxue lost control of herself.

Interestingly enough, the water close to Mo Fan was boiling from the heat his body was releasing. White steam was rising continuously. The overjoyed Mo Fan had turned into a heater. The temperature of the pool kept rising!

As a result, the spot where Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were at was like a boundary, with half of the pool boiling, and the other half freezing, yet the two in the middle were totally unaware of what was happening.

“Let’s go to the bedroom.”

“Sure.”

—

Mo Fan was firm with his attitude when they reached the master bedroom. Why did they have to take a shower separately? They were already in the pool together. They should be standing under the shower together too...

After breaking through the first line of defense, Mo Fan felt like he had reached the summit of his life that was more thrilling than the dreams he had. He watched as the clean water sprinkled down on Mu Ningxue’s sacred body. He could feel the flames in his soul starting to revolt.

Mo Fan impatiently carried Mu Ningxue to the bed after a quick shower.

The bed had a pleasant scent, yet it was nowhere as fascinating as Mu Ningxue’s body odor. They already had a little foreplay in the pool, and their flames had yet to cool down. Mo Fan no longer had to worry about where he should start from. An alluring moan sounded by his ears after he gave a few important parts a kiss.

Mo Fan knew he could not rush it. He had to be patient. Besides, he would never have enough of Mu Ningxue’s body. He could spend a long time on her legs, now being held tightly together, by kissing her from her toes to her flat belly. He could not just favor one side and discriminate against the other, either. He asked Mu Ningxue to turn around after caressing her front. He pulled the same trick with her back, but he ended up indulging in her tender cheeks.

He untied her silver hair and let it scatter naughtily to fully enjoy her beauty. He suddenly felt a unique charm that made his heart pound heavily from her dignified eyes. He knew that if it was not for that incident during her youth, her charm and beauty would be a deadly poison to any man. However, she was fine as she was now, since her hidden charm only belonged to him now! He could close the door, turn off the lights, put her on the bed, and enjoy her beauty as long as he pleased.

Mo Fan was as excited as an amateur when they finally merged together. His dream had come true smoothly. In his imagination, Mu Ningxue’s beautiful face would be expressionless or she might furrow her brows, but her reaction was different in reality.

Mo Fan was overjoyed. The outcome of his long journey was far better than he had imagined.
