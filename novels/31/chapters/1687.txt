The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was immediately targeted by a Poison Spell after missing his attack, coming in the form of water droplets. They quickly attached to the Flying Creek Snow Wolf‚Äôs skin and permeated in through his pores.

It was very difficult to guard against the poison. Its paralyzing effects soon weakened the Flying Creek Snow Wolf further. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf felt like he was going to fall to the ground if he lost focus!

Lu Zhuo was extremely cunning, and did not dare to fight the Flying Creek Snow Wolf head-on. He kept kiting and harassing the Flying Creek Snow Wolf with the Shadow Element. He clearly knew that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was under the effects of the drug, and now the paralyzing effects of the poison mist were slowly working, too. The two kinds of poison were constantly spreading through the Flying Creek Snow Wolf‚Äôs body. He just needed to wear the Flying Creek Snow Wolf out and he would soon turn into an old dog waiting to be slaughtered!

‚ÄúAwooo!‚Äù

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf‚Äôs howl was obviously weakening. He tried to locate Lu Zhuo in the mist, but the man was just too cunning.

Knowing the pinch they were in, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf decisively lifted Gu Ying and placed her on his back.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was very experienced with Mo Fan‚Äôs tactics after being with him for so long: it was time to run if he could not defeat the enemy!

The river would still be flowing as long as the mountain was around. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was losing his balance like he was drunk. He quickly headed away from the island before he lost the ability to move!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled. A strong icy aura burst out of the lake in a straight line and froze the water in an instant, providing the Flying Creek Snow Wolf a path to run on!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf ran away from the island without turning to look back.

Lu Zhuo was rather surprised. The creature was merely putting up an act, and was planning to run away all along!

‚ÄúGu Ying, you better think twice, if you run away, I‚Äôm going to kill everyone on the island! You will regret it in front of your teammates‚Äô graves!‚Äù Lu Zhuo chased after them while threatening Gu Ying with the lives of the people on the island.

Gu Ying turned around and looked at her unconscious friends.

Gu Ying was both enraged and unwilling to accept that she would be the only member of the Foehn Hunter Squad left.

She could not run away. If she did, the others were all going to die!

Lu Zhuo‚Äôs trick was quite effective. Gu Ying wanted to go back to the island. She could not imagine what Lu Zhuo would do to her teammates if she left!

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt leave, he‚Äôs going to kill them all,‚Äù Gu Ying said, lying on the Flying Creek Snow Wolf‚Äôs back.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf continued to sprint along the ice. He acted like he did not understand a single word from her.

First, if they did not run away, they were clearly going to die. The time he had spent to improve his cultivation would all be wasted. He did not think Lu Zhuo would be merciful to them. Second, even a wolf like him knew they were only going to get themselves killed if they turned back now. The people on the island were dead for sure. There was no reason for them to sacrifice themselves too!

Gu Ying was concerned about her teammates, but the Flying Creek Snow Wolf did not care much about them.

‚ÄúYou... let me down!‚Äù Gu Ying protested feebly.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf pretended he could not hear her. As a Summoned Beast, Mo Fan was not going to blame him if he managed to save the life of a beautiful woman!

‚Äî

Lu Zhuo was utterly enraged. He had an urge to skin the wolf alive and drink his blood dry!

There was no way he could let the Flying Creek Snow Wolf and Gu Ying run away. If she was alive, the people would learn the truth about what happened on the island. He would be wanted by the Hunter Union and the Enforcement Union. His life would be ruined!

He turned into a mist and chased after the wolf. He had to make sure that the wolf and the woman were dead, even though it was dangerous to traverse the Thousand Islands Lake at night.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was determined to avoid the fight. He kept running in the same direction.

There was nothing but water nearby. It was quite a nuisance for the Flying Creek Snow Wolf since he had to freeze the water before he was able to run on the ice. Lu Zhuo was right on his trail. He was having difficulties remaining focused enough to freeze the water due to the sleep poison and paralyzing effects. He almost stepped into the water at times.

If the Flying Creek Snow Wolf got any slower, he might even lose his ability to run on the water. He would sink to the bottom of the lake!

‚ÄúDo you think you can run away? This is going to be your final struggle!‚Äù Lu Zhuo pursued them relentlessly.

He was a Water Mage. The Thousand Islands Lake was his best kind of terrain. He was quicker and more agile here.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf forced himself to raise his spirits when he noticed the man still chasing them. He continued to run a distance away before he noticed strange objects floating on the water.

Gu Ying had noticed them, too. Huge shells had appeared above the surface of the lake. They looked like giant snails lying on the surface of the lake under the moonlight; each Salamander Demon had a small whirlpool beside them, as if they were filtering the water!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was overjoyed when he saw the Salamander Demons.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf stopped unleashing his freezing aura. He jumped onto the shells of the Salamander Demons and kicked off them ferociously, driving them down into the water.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf swept across the lake in an elegant arc. He landed right on the shell of another Salamander Demon floating on the water!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf kicked again strongly, creating a huge splash and launching himself into the air! Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

White hair drifted in the wind. The nimble Flying Creek Snow Wolf treated the countless Salamander Demons as his stepping boards, easily crossing the lake.

The Salamander Demons were extremely slow with their reactions. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was already a kilometer away before they stirred themselves to attack. They could only splash the water fiercely to vent their frustrations!

Lu Zhuo was surprisingly capable. The water mist he had turned into was concealing his presence, so the Salamander Demons would not attack him when he was floating past them. However, his speed was nowhere close to that of the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. If they were on land, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf would have long shaken him off!

‚ÄúThese idiots!‚Äù Lu Zhuo was enraged.

There were a lot of Salamander Demons in the Thousand Islands Lake at night. He initially thought the Salamander Demons would prevent the Flying Creek Snow Wolf from escaping, yet the Salamander Demons had become stepping stones for the wolf, speeding him up!

‚Äî

The two finally managed to distance themselves from Lu Zhuo. Gu Ying was having mixed feelings. She was worried that Lu Zhuo would catch up to them, yet she was scared that he would give up on the chase and go back to the island to kill everyone on it.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf reached an island. He was losing his strength, and panting heavily to catch his breath.

‚ÄúYou should go, I‚Äôm the one he‚Äôs after,‚Äù Gu Ying said.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf looked at Gu Ying as if he was looking at a retard.

Gu Ying was feeling drowsy. After all, she was under the effects of the drug too.

A breeze swept in from the sky. Gu Ying noticed the rocks nearby shaking vigorously. She looked up and saw a figure with Wind Wings hovering in the night sky.

Gu Ying was overjoyed. They were lucky to stumble into an Advanced Wind Mage here!

The Wind Mage had obviously noticed Gu Ying and the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. He descended from the sky. Gu Ying was confused when she saw a little fireball following behind him.

‚ÄúGu Ying?‚Äù the Wind Mage asked. He seemed to have recognized Gu Ying.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, it‚Äôs me, you are... why is it you!?‚Äù Gu Ying‚Äôs heart skipped a beat just as she was about to be overwhelmed by joy.

Why is it him? Why did it have to be him!?

‚ÄúOh, the Seven Star Hunter Master said that his Summoned Beast was asking for help. He couldn‚Äôt fly, so he asked me to take a look. What happened?‚Äù the man asked.

Gu Ying was about to speak when a mist arrived at the stranded island. Lu Zhuo‚Äôs figure became clearer as he walked out from the mist with an eerie grin.

‚ÄúJiang Hua, you‚Äôve come just in time. This vicious woman found traces of the Great Salamander Demons. She decided to set us up and claim everything for herself while we are fighting the Great Salamander Demons. I chased after her when I found out about her conspiracy!‚Äù Lu Zhuo stood beside the Advanced Wind Mage and said righteously.

Jiang Hua frowned. He looked at Gu Ying, who was lying feebly on the ground.

Gu Ying lost all her hope when she saw Jiang Hua and Lu Zhuo standing together.

The man that came was Lu Zhuo‚Äôs teammate from the group of Hunter Masters. From what Gu Ying knew, Jiang Hua had been close with Lu Zhuo for a long time. The bad rumors about their group actually circled around them. If Lu Zhuo was such a deranged man, Jiang Hua was obviously not going to be a good person, either!

They initially had a chance to survive if the Flying Creek Snow Wolf and she kept dragging the chase out. However, they had lost their only chance to run away now that Lu Zhuo‚Äôs teammate, a Wind Mage, had shown up.

‚ÄúOh, I see, I have long been suspicious of her. She is quite pretty, but I didn‚Äôt expect her to be so vicious...‚Äù Jiang Hua smiled. He did not bother asking for the details.

Gu Ying subconsciously backed away. She was grumbling in her heart. If the Seven Stars Hunter Master knew his Summoned Beast was calling for help, why did he not come in person? He should be able to think of another way!

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs execute the woman on the spot. Tsk tsk, we‚Äôll explain everything to the Seven Stars Hunter Master later... Jiang Hua, what‚Äôs with the fireball floating behind you?‚Äù Lu Zhuo asked. He was curious when he noticed the fire floating behind Jiang Hua.

‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs the Seven Stars Hunter Master‚Äôs Contracted Beast. She‚Äôs called Flame Belle or something. I have no idea what she is. She looks a little dumb, and she only knows to eat. The Seven Stars Hunter Master asked her to follow me... I bet he‚Äôs asking her to light up the darkness like a lantern, HAHAHA!‚Äù Jiang Hua said indifferently, looking at the fiery little spirit.

‚ÄúShe does look like a little lantern. Perhaps she‚Äôs a mascot, HAHAHA!‚Äù Lu Zhuo burst out laughing too.

Things were a lot simpler now that Jiang Hua was here. He might be able to help get rid of the people on the island, too!
