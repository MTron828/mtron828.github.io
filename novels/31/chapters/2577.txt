Mu Bai did not regret his move. He accepted being hated by the people who had died.

The middle-aged man who claimed he wanted to save his son in the black forest was cursing Mu Bai now. Mu Bai understood his change of heart.

“Go left diagonally!” Mu Bai immediately moved Mo Fan to run away from Su Lu.

The tile was empty. There were only the remains of several pieces that had fought there, including the European man who had been a bishop.

It was far from a safe place. It would also take away Mu Bai’s initiative.

However, it was the only way to shake off Su Lu. Su Lu could not wait to tear Mo Fan into pieces. If Su Lu cornered Mo Fan, he would have no chance of escaping, nor was he going to receive any help.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa hissed and slowly approached Mo Fan. It was obvious that the Lord of Darkness was persisting in trying to kill Mo Fan.

“He’s still going to die no matter how hard you are trying to protect him,” the Lord of Darkness promised.

Mu Bai did not say a word back.

The tile Mo Fan stood on began to change. It was covered by brown-yellow soil and lots of sharp rocks jutting out. Huge boulders were rising like mountains around him.

Sand and dust lingered in the air and occasionally took the shape of yellow dragons soaring into the sky with formidable auras.

It was a barren land. Even the things that resembled plants were all made of rocks, sand, and soil, as if everything was made of the same elements.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa crawled across the barren land. Her scorpion body was surprisingly flexible, allowing her to glide forward like a snake even though her body was a scorpion. It looked very strange.

“I’m sorry that I must forbid one of your Contracted Summonings. Too bad,” the Lord of Darkness looked at Mo Fan thoughtfully and waved his hand. A dark ray of light flew at Mo Fan’s forehead like an insect.

Mo Fan did not try to dodge it. Even the Black Dragon Emperor and Su Lu were treated like mere chess pieces by the Lord of Darkness. It was meaningless for Mo Fan to even struggle against him.

“It doesn’t matter to me. It’s true that the fight would be meaningless if I used the Contracted Summoning,” Mo Fan said honestly.

“Let’s begin. Since you are the defender, your strength will be reduced by thirty percent,” the Lord of Darkness said.

A black illusionary string fell from the sky and attached to Mo Fan. It did not affect his actions or movements, but it would reduce the strength of every spell he used.

“Lord of Darkness, do you think I’m no match for him? Did you forget I’ve already killed a bishop, causing my strength to grow by fifty percent? Besides, his strength is reduced thirty percent too,” The Crimson Scorpion Medusa was able to speak in a human language. Her face was like a human’s, but around five times bigger.

Mo Fan was in a terrible spot.

The European man had died to the Crimson Scorpion Medusa, and since he had been a bishop, the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s strength had increased by fifty percent.

It was as the Crimson Scorpion Medusa said. The battle was already to her favor, especially when she was the attacker!

Why was it necessary for the Lord of Darkness to forbid the enemy’s Contracted Summoning? How could his Contracted Summoning possibly stand a chance against her?

The Lord of Darkness smiled.

Mo Fan smiled, too. The Crimson Scorpion Medusa was seriously asking for trouble!

“You may Summon your little maid then,” the Lord of Darkness conceded.

Mo Fan opened the rift of the Contract Summoning.

A gorgeous young woman walked out of the rift. She was dressed in ordinary clothes, but they were enough to highlight her outstanding beauty.

Her eyes were sparkling and golden, unlike normal human eyes.

She was petite when she stood in front of Mo Fan, but when she lifted her gaze to look at the Crimson Scorpion Medusa, an overwhelming Aura froze the barren land in a terrifying manner.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa instantly turned from a proud tyrant to a petty little scorpion. She was trembling in fear. She almost slammed into a rock when she turned around and ran for her life.

A Medusa Queen!

The creatures in the Evil Temples greatly respected one another’s lineage. The ones with a purer lineage would possess the great power of the Evil Temple. The Evil Temple was a part of the Dark Plane, but it existed in the human world.

The Medusa Queens were obviously the highest rulers of the Evil Temple. The Crimson Scorpion Medusa could never have guessed that the Contracted Summoning was going to bring forth a Medusa Queen!

“Third...Third Highness!” The Crimson Scorpion Medusa fell to her knees. There was no sign of her proud and aloof manner. She almost buried her head into the sand.

“You win, you die. You lose, you die, too!” Apas stated coldly.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa was left speechless.

Just a moment ago, she was relieved that she had another chance to take out an enemy bishop. Her strength would soon be increased by another fifty percent, thus she might stand a chance against pieces that were higher-level than her. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She did not expect the situation to turn out like this! The Crimson Scorpion Medusa had an urge to kill herself!

If the Medusa Queen had a Contract with the young man, the Medusa Queen would definitely kill her for killing the young man!

If she lost the battle, she was going to die, too. The Lord of Darkness would never spare the life of a loser in his game of chess. The outcome of the battle would decide their fate!

“Are you satisfied now?” the Lord of Darkness asked.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa felt like crying. Why couldn’t she control her own mouth?

“However, there’s no need to worry. Since there’s a Contract between them, once you kill the man, the Medusa Queen will sustain a serious blow to her soul. You have plenty of time to look for a place to hide and enjoy how good it is to be alive until she recovers from her injuries,” the Lord of Darkness went on.

“Please… say no more…” The Crimson Scorpion Medusa felt like she had been stabbed in the heart.

She had thought the Lord of Darkness would provide her protection, but instead, he was just pointing out the obvious.

What difference was it going to make? She was still going to die either way!

The Lord of Darkness did not care about the fate of his pieces. His only goal was to win the game. He just needed to give the Crimson Scorpion Medusa a glimpse of hope, and she would know what she was supposed to do.

Mo Fan sent the Medusa Queen back to her Contracted Space. He knew the Lord of Darkness would not allow Apas to be involved in the fight.

The Lord of Darkness’ rules were actually quite simple. He would remove the factors that would severely affect the balance of a battle.

However, Mo Fan did not think the Lord of Darkness was omnipotent.. At least his evaluation of the strengths of different pieces had not been very accurate so far.
