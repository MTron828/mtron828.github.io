“Strange, it felt cold all of a sudden, is the weather changing?”

“Isn’t that Mu Ningxue?”

“It looks like she was turned into a substitute, I even heard someone mentioned that she might get kicked out of the team...depending on the Councilmen’s decision.”

Gong Yu stood among the crowd glancing at Mu Ningxue, who was walking toward them with a mocking look.

“Say, Mu Ningxue, did you come to the wrong place? This gathering is only meant for the main team. I know that you’re still a substitute, but who knows, you might not even be on the national team soon...” said a girl whose hair was dyed brown among the crowd.

She was Mu Tingying, the young talent that the Mu Clan had decided to focus their support on.

Mu Tingying really hated Mu Ningxue, as she was chosen as the little bitch’s substitute despite her status in the Mu Clan. Mu Ningxue had been standing on her head for a long time, but Heaven had finally given her a chance, thus Mu Tingying was extremely satisfied with the current circumstances.

Mu Ningxue ignored her remarks. She went straight up to the five advisors.

The five advisors consisted of people with great authority. It did not matter how many votes a candidate had received, they were the ones making the final decision!

Unfortunately, the five advisors were never biased toward anyone. The reason they were appointed as the advisors was because they shared the same goal: to achieve the highest possible ranking in the World College Tournament!

Although it felt like the World College Tournament mainly focused on the competition between young Magicians, it was extremely important to every country, as the ranking of the countries in the tournament was used to determine the distribution of resources...

The World College Tournament was no game. Most importantly, the whole world would be fixing their gaze on it! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I know I’ve been blacklisted, and I know the reason behind it, but I’ve come here today only for one reason, to let you reevaluate us...” Mu Ningxue stood in front of the advisors and said sternly.

“Reevaluate? Oh Ningxue, I know the incident is extremely unfair to you, but the sins that the Black Vatican committed were simply unforgivable. We’re actually trying to protect you by not letting you participate in the tournament. The grudges of the victims in the calamity of the Ancient Capital were too strong. They might even put the blame on you if you show up in the public representing our country...” advised Dean Song He with tactful words.

Dean Song He knew that Mu Ningxue was more worthy than anyone else to represent their country in the national team. However, the calamity of the Ancient Capital had just been resolved. The people were still blinded by hatred.

“Hence why I’ve asked you to reevaluate me. I hope that this bow can take away your biased opinions toward me!”

“What bow?” The other advisors were confused.

Mu Ningxue did not speak further. She turned around and fixed her gaze on the spacious, empty dueling ground.

Suddenly, her snowy-silver hair rose as her long skirt drifted to the wind. Her glamorous figure looked even more stunning in the cold breeze that had appeared out of nowhere!

Her innate Ice Soul Seed, the hair with the color of snow drifting in the wind and the smooth, tender skin like ice, she was indeed the most perfect Ice Magician. Her focus on the Ice Element, and her aura that seemed to have merged with the ice and snow left the advisors astonished!

However, Mu Ningxue was not here to display her extraordinary beauty. She slowly extended her arms, accumulating the crystalline ice particles from her surroundings, combining into a stunning ice bow!

The bow was lacking a string and arrow, but Mu Ningxue simply pulled her hand back. A transparent, breathtaking arrow appeared between her half-curled index finger and middle finger!

“Is...is this...” Dean Song He and the four national team advisors were stunned!

Mu Ningxue let go of the arrow. Her long hair drifted wildly in the sudden gust of wind and covered a face as exquisite as a work of art.

The ice arrow swept forward and instantly stirred up a howling ice storm in the spacious dueling ground!

The arrow was fired into the air. It drew an arc and landed on the star-shaped dueling ground.

Ice crystals spread rapidly with an overwhelming icy aura. While the people were still stunned by the formidable aura of the arrow that Mu Ningxue had just fired, the whole place was entirely frozen as soon as the arrow landed on the ground!

The icy energy bypassed the barrier and froze the seats. Luckily, the seats were empty, they were covered by ice in the blink of an eye...

Half of the dueling ground was now covered in ice. The reflection was a breathtaking sight with a tremendous visual impact!

The ten students turned their heads, glancing at the astounding sight with blank faces.

They never thought Mu Ningxue, who they assumed to be on par with them, had mastered such a formidable Ice Magic, countless times stronger than their best spells. The five advisors were left speechless, overwhelmed with shock.

Reevaluate...

So that’s what the girl meant!

Absolute strength! She was planning to use her absolute strength to forcibly clear the stain on her name!

She would not give up on becoming a candidate of the national team. She had worked diligently the past few years just for this chance. She initially thought she could easily secure the spot without relying on the Ice Crystal Bow...

“I want to join the team, even if I’m only a substitute,” Mu Ningxue took a deep breath. She tightened her grip and broke the Ice Crystal Bow into powder.

Mu Ningxue clearly knew that it was likely they would remove her from the list of substitutes.

It took the advisors a long time to recover from the shock of witnessing half of the dueling ground being turned into ice. Mu Ningxue’s arrow had completely moved their hearts!

They exchanged glances with one another as if they were discussing among themselves.

Her power over the Ice Element was indeed worthy for them to reevaluate their decision!

“Your strength has indeed moved us. We’ll personally request that the higher-ups secure your spot in the team as a substitute. You will join the others in the training in other countries,” said an advisor with tiger stripes on his forehead.

“Feng Li, the higher-ups have already arranged a substitute to join the team out of nowhere, and now her...” said a short advisor beside the man.

“It won’t make any difference, the training will last for a year, and not every student will remain unharmed throughout the training. Someone might die, someone might get disqualified. It’s fine to let them join the national team for the training,” said Advisor Feng Li.

“I agree, sending twelve or thirteen people on the training won’t make much of a difference,” said Dean Song He smilingly.

“By the way, who’s the other substitute?”

“I never met him before.”

“Neither did I, he was put onto the team without us evaluating his strength. Someone needs to make sure the national government is behaving themselves.”

“Feng Li, are you aware of the kid’s background? How did he manage to bypass the five of us? Even the senior official’s son has to listen to my scolding, who could he possibly be that the higher-ups are being so secretive!” said the shorty.

Feng Li shook his head as he spoke, “I have no clue, either. I only know that the kid is called... Mo Fan.”
