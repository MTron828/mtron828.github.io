Mo Fan had the Space Element, so he did not have a problem opening up a little space to store the loot they acquired.

After putting the Heart of Stone away, Mo Fan exchanged glances with Mu Ningxue. It seemed like this was the first time that Mu Ningxue had done anything like it. Both her expression and gaze did not look natural.

“It’s fine, you’ll get used to it eventually,” Mo Fan tried to comfort her in his way.

“The Observer Eagles must have captured what we did,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Don’t be scared, everyone is trying to set one another up, too. The only difference is that we’re like real bandits, since we aren’t wasting our time searching for the treasure. Seriously, isn’t it tiring trying to pretend that you’re working with someone else, but end up going against your word when the loot is simply too valuable to give up? Come, it’s time for us to look for our next target,” Mo Fan said.

Their first crime was not as easy as others thought. Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue had been watching the group for quite some time. They were struggling to find an opportunity to strike. Luckily, the Italian team decided to keep the loot to themselves, allowing Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue to seize the opportunity!

“What do we do next?” Mu Ningxue asked. She was no longer fussed about what they were doing.

She did not really care about doing the right thing, but she had always been obedient since she was young, and had always walked the righteous path. She finally made it to the World College Tournament, yet she ended up doing some wicked things with this bad guy, Mo Fan... her heart was still pounding heavily!

Meanwhile, Mo Fan was perfectly fine. His calm face, and the way he tried to comfort Mu Ningxue, clearly implied how experienced he was when it came to robbing other people. He had long gotten used to it...

“Very simple, scout for our next target. Strength isn’t the most important aspect of what we’re trying to do. We need lots of information, and it has to be accurate, too. I believe we’ll need to recruit another person for us to be better!” Mo Fan said seriously.

Mu Ningxue glanced at Mo Fan. She was utterly confused. Why did she feel like Mo Fan was glowing whenever he was up to something wicked?

“Who would that be?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“A Psychic Mage, we’re lacking a Psychic Mage... if only we could find Jiang Shaoxu, she would surely be a great help to us!” Mo Fan mused.

“But why...” Mu Ningxue was about to ask something when she sensed some movement among the trees. She locked onto the suspicious figure behind the trees with a sharp gaze.

The person did not expect Mu Ningxue to be so alert. She decided to show herself after a slight hesitation.

The person was a woman with curly hair. Her outstanding, solid facial features made her look attractive and sexy, and her golden pupils were like the icing on a cake, which further set off her nobility.

“I’m sorry, I wasn’t supposed to eavesdrop on you, but I didn’t expect you to be the one that set the Italian team up. It’s been a while!” the girl smiled. It was like she actually practiced how to smile properly. She looked sincere, even without showing her teeth.

“Ayleen, it’s you! Don’t tell me that a bunch of your teammates is waiting for the perfect time to flank us behind the trees?” Mo Fan chuckled when he recognized the English woman.

“The team consisting of members from different countries I was in just disbanded, so I’m all alone,” Ayleen walked forward. Her eyes were fixed on Mu Ningxue. “You’ve improved so much. You managed to notice my presence so easily, and my Psychic Element wasn’t really working on you.”

“You’ve been following us?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“Sort of, but don’t you worry, I’m not your enemy. Besides, didn’t you say you want to find your teammate? I’m afraid it’s going to be quite tricky. This space we’re in isn’t that spacious, but many of the places are spatially compressed, so they are bigger than they seem. If you’re looking for a Psychic Mage, I’m willing to lend a hand,” Ayleen answered politely. Her golden eyes had a rather sincere look, too.

“Do you know what we are up to, Little Ayleen?” Mo Fan chuckled again.

Ayleen of the English team had left Mo Fan with a strong impression at Shanghai’s Training Hall. Besides, he even treated her to a meal of lobster. Mo Fan believed Ayleen did not come to harm them.

Besides, in a space where members of all sixteen teams were scattered everywhere, it was necessary to find some companions, and instead of teaming up with some strangers, Mo Fan was more willing to believe Ayleen, whom he had met before.

“Robbing the others... I think it’s brilliant! The organizer actually planned to let us compete for the resources, so I believe even if this place is full of resources, it’s quite easy for the participants to clash with one another. Instead of wasting our time on some relationship that will crumble within an instant, it’s better for us to take the direct approach,” Ayleen agreed.

“So you’re interested in joining us?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mmm, my primary Element is Water, and my tertiary Element is Psychic, but I don’t get it, why are you looking for a Psychic Mage?” Ayleen said.

“Well...” Mo Fan looked at Mu Ningxue, asking for her opinion.

Jiang Shaoxu was easily the best candidate, since she was trustworthy. However, as Ayleen had mentioned, it would be tricky for them to look for Jiang Shaoxu, and if they spent too much time looking for her, the good resources would be taken away by the other teams. Eventually, everyone would realize that it was easier to rob the others rather than trying to search for the loot and defeat the demon creatures guarding them. By then, it would be harder for them to get their way.

Mu Ningxue nodded. She believed that Ayleen was not harboring any evil intentions. She was only looking for a team to join since she was all alone. Otherwise, she would have shown up with a bunch of people instead of on her own when she noticed them.

“Alright, as the leader of the Fan Xue Bandit Group, I hereby accept you as a member of our group. You must strictly obey the rule of not betraying us. In addition to it, since the two of us have come up with the idea first, and you’ve only joined later, in terms of the stakes, each of us will take forty percent of the profit, and the remaining twenty percent is yours. Of course, you won’t have to worry much about doing the dirty work, you can leave it to us,” Mo Fan immediately set conditions.

Mu Ningxue subconsciously rolled her eyes.

Was Mo Fan seriously thinking of turning this into a serious business? He even came up with the name Fan Xue Bandit Group, and was very serious at explaining the conditions to Ayleen... Mu Ningxue suddenly recalled the time long ago where Mo Fan, the leader among the kids, was always able to come up with new ideas to fool around, and the other kids were willing to listen to his orders and ran around the streets having a great time.

“Sure, it sounds reasonable!” Ayleen was not fussy, either. After all, she did join the team late, and she was not the greedy kind.

“Good, as I mentioned, to be better at what we’re doing...” Mo Fan patted his chest. Somehow, both Ayleen and Mu Ningxue began to doubt if Mo Fan was actually a proper Mage when they saw his natural way of delivering the speech and the confident look he was wearing. Why did they feel like Mo Fan was born for this?

“What we need the most is information. Information that can tell us what loot a person has, and when a person has strayed away from their group; where a person is, and even tell us the mental condition of a person! We aren’t a big group, so mobility is our advantage. We can easily run away as we please, but we’re at a disadvantage in terms of numbers. After all, most groups will be bigger than ours, and if we don’t choose the right target, we’re going to get robbed instead.”

“So where are we going to get the information from? My Psychic Element isn’t strong enough to read someone else’s mind,” Ayleen said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“And why do we need to read someone’s mind?” Mo Fan asked in return.

“How are we going to collect the information without reading someone’s mind? Don’t tell me we have to go on a wild goose chase until we find the right target?” Ayleen said.

Mu Ningxue was looking at Mo Fan, too. She was eager to learn where Mo Fan was going to get the information from.

To their surprise, Mo Fan raised his head and glanced at the sky.

However, both Ayleen and Mu Ningxue were smart. They did not believe that Mo Fan was actually looking at the sky. They soon noticed the Observer Eagles circling high up in the sky!

“You’re a genius!” Ayleen smiled. She immediately realized how the Psychic Element came into the picture with a little hint from Mo Fan.

Mu Ningxue’s eyes lit up, too. She was fairly impressed by Mo Fan’s idea. It turned out that it was easier for someone who was used to harboring evil intentions to come up with ideas that ordinary people would never think of!

In terms of information, no one in the confined space would know more than the Observer Eagles. These creatures would follow anyone they saw and gather at places with the presence of magic. Even though the organizer would only broadcast the treasure hunt to the audience selectively, the Observer Eagles still had a vast amount of information!

As such, if they were eager to learn which groups of people had found remarkable loot, which teams were suffering from fatigue, which groups had infighting among its members, and which teams were unstoppable, the Observer Eagles would know best!

The only person that could acquire the information from the Observer Eagles was a Psychic Mage!

Since everyone was representing their countries in the tournament with the whole world watching, no one could possibly think of abusing the Observer Eagles. It would be considered a violation... but the truth was, there was no rule clearly forbidding the participants from acquiring the information gathered by the Observer Eagles, nor was there a rule stopping the participants from attacking the Observer Eagles. They could easily justify themselves, even if they were accused!

Mo Fan believed that the organizer could not do anything to them if they skirted the rules!

After listening to Mo Fan’s suggestion, both Ayleen and Mu Ningxue, who rarely did any bad things, seemed to be excited. After all, if they could take advantage of the information gathered by the Observer Eagles, treasures would soon roll into their pockets!
