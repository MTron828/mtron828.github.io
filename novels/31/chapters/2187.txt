Sharjah was innocent of any wrongdoing, she was only trying to resolve the conflict that had occurred. The student union did not prepare the dishes. She was taking the blame on behalf of Yesemia.

To her surprise, the lecturer did not follow the script she had in mind. He still punished her for giving him an out and retained his superiority as a lecturer!

“Thank you for your understanding,” Sharjah nodded obediently. She had no choice but to accept the outcome.

First Prince Beny and Yesemia pulled long faces. They were planning to pick on the young Chinese lecturer, yet they had ended up boosting his morale instead. They did not feel comfortable when the proudest student of the Aorus Sacred Institute was as obedient as a mere intern in front of the Chinese lecturer.

Sharjah was like the noblest Persian cat of their school. Many lecturers tried to get her attention or at least some response from her, but not many had managed to do it. Most lecturers were attracted by Sharjah’s unique temperament instead. The people who attempted to conquer her ended up becoming her slaves.

However, the good-for-nothing Chinese lecturer had turned the proud and arrogant Persian cat into an obedient Golden Retriever in just a single class!

“Forget it, Sharjah has always been like this. She’s always curious about new things and will chase them passionately. However, when she figures out their secrets, she will just cast them aside,” First Prince Beny murmured.

Sharjah was as heartless as a cat.

“Our fellow lecturers from China, I believe you must have heard about the competition. Basically, we will evaluate the guest lecturers on three areas,” Yesemia switched the topic. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Please explain it in detail,” Mo Fan said agreeably.

“That’s the reason I’ve gathered everyone here, to explain the details of the evaluation process to every guest lecturer. We have split it into three main parts. The first part is the magic theory classes. We will evaluate everyone based on students’ attendance. In simple words, whoever has the highest attendance in their classes will score the highest. From today forward, all guest lecturers will be teaching classes, and the classes might even occur at the same time.

“The second part is related to demon creatures. The Aorus Sacred Institute has always emphasized on teaching students practical knowledge about demon creatures. We don’t just stick to textbooks, illustrations, and verbal descriptions, we want our students to be equipped with practical skills. The lecturers who take these classes will bring their students on excursions while looking after their safety. The Andes Mountains have a lot of different species. You will teach them the demon creatures’ attributes, capabilities, and habits as they observe the demon creatures in person. We will evaluate you based on the feedback from the students and the grade of the demon creatures.

“The third part is the classes about magic duels between Mages. You will teach the students practical combat skills and techniques. The evaluation is quite simple. Each country will choose nine students they teach to take part in an open tournament across the Americas,” Yesemia said.

An open tournament across the Americas!

It was going to be a grand tournament. It sounded like nine countries were going to compete with one another!

Mo Fan liked the idea, but this time, he would not participate in the tournament himself. The students he taught would be fighting for glory instead. He found it pretty interesting, too!

He would earn the most glory if his students were able to emerge victorious!

It was better than winning a tournament himself!

“I have a question,” Brianca spoke up.

“Go ahead,” Yesemia smiled. She was like a completely different person when she was talking to Brianca, compared to her attitude toward Mo Fan.

“Certain topics in the Magic Theory classes are related to demon creatures too, as are the practical skills in magic duels and fights against demon creatures. Do we have to split the classes?” Brianca asked.

“You may teach the classes at the same time. For example, you can combine a class of magic theory and a class on demon creatures into one. The lecturer who handles magic theory will teach about magic theory while the other lecturer teaches about the demon creatures. We will still evaluate the lecturers differently, but as a kindly reminder, there are only a limited number of classes available. For example, you are only given ten classes of magic theories and ten classes of demon creatures. If you combine two of the classes into one, you will expend a class of each field,” Yesemia clarified.

“Okay, I understand,” Brianca nodded.

Mo Fan had the exact same question that Brianca had asked.

Mo Fan felt like he would go crazy if he had to teach ten classes on magic theory! The topic about merging different Elements would only last for three classes at most. He did not have any other topics that could intrigue the brilliant students of this school.

It would be a lot easier to deceive the students by combining the classes!

“There’s one more thing. We’ll only subsidize the first class for the students, but you may charge for the rest of your classes. You will receive Aorus gold as your payment. Meanwhile, the Aorus Sacred Institute will also charge you for the equipment, venues, and security personnel should you require them in your classes. You will have to decide how you should plan your classes with the money you have,” Yesemia went on.

“Gambling is also allowed before the open tournament. If the lecturer who’s in charge of classes of magic duels plans to obtain more money, they can ask their students to challenge the students from other factions. We also allow people in the Aorus Sacred Institute and outsiders to bet on the duels. The lecturer will receive a portion of the pool if their student wins the duel,” Yesemia said.

Gambling is allowed!

The whole school and outsiders are allowed to bet on the duels!

The Aorus Sacred Institute is blatantly challenging the Magic Association!

The Magic Association did not allow private duels between Mages, let alone betting on magic duels. Most importantly, the school even allowed outsiders to bet on the duels. It was going to be a huge betting scheme!

As expected of the Aorus Sacred Institute, which was its own nation... It could just do whatever it wanted!

“Every faction will have a thousand gold coins. The lecturers will allocate the funds themselves.”

The gold here did not refer to a kind of currency that was made of gold. Everyone in the Americas knew it was referring to the Aorus Sacred Institute’s own currency.

Every student would receive a certain amount of gold when they enrolled in the school. They could spend it within the boundaries of the Aorus Sacred Institute on food, classes, magic equipment, and resources. One might find themselves at the bottom of the ladder after enrolling in the school, but by saving up a lot of gold, they also had a chance to become a top dog!

The Aorus Sacred Institute was like a little kingdom with its own rules. Most importantly, it was possible to exchange their gold with US dollars, and the exchange rate was one gold to a thousand USD!
