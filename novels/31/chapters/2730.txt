Chapter 2731: Bewitching Female Spider

Fortunately, Mo Fan was always prepared. He had deliberately left Darkness Seals on several girls from Licheng Afterglow Island.

Bei Jiang’s Black Substance was indeed an incomparably powerful ability, and it was very practical, too. It was basically another eye he could use to track creatures or even people. His target couldn’t evade him easily as long as the Darkness Seal held.

Mo Fan closed his eyes, and the whole world turned gray-black. The dark vein surged. It could strengthen Mo Fan’s ability to search for the Darkness Seals. Sometimes if the target was too far away, the Darkness Seals would weaken and scatter. Mo Fan had to carefully look for the faint Black Substances if that was the case.

“That’s weird… why can’t I find them anywhere?” muttered Mo Fan. “It’s impossible for them to travel very far in such a short time. It is unlikely that they have left Mingwu Ancient City.”

‘Could there be a Light Element Mage with them who noticed the Black Substances and removed my Darkness Seals?’ He thought. ‘They must be masters at this!’

Mo Fan was deep in thought. Mo Fan’s Black Substance was of very high quality. Although all his other elements were enhanced by fifty percent after he obtained the darkness source, the Black Substance had benefited even more from it.

The Darkness seals were usually hidden very deeply, so not everyone could notice it. If a Light Element Mage had managed to detect and remove the seals, then they must indeed be of very high cultivation realm!

Mo Fan walked around the walkway. He noticed that several other statues were missing, too.

Although the other statues had much weaker aura than the Thundercat and Flute Heron statues, they were still keeping the demons away. Those statues were invaluable.

Mo Fan wondered who in that hunter group was so powerful to take away several heavy statues in such a short period of time.

“Squeak. Squeak. Squeak.”

Yellowish-green vines slithered out slowly like poisonous snakes in the grass by his feet. The coconut tree in front of him was covered in thick spider webs. The thickness of them was so much that Mo Fan couldn’t even see the road ahead. More than a dozen fist-sized spiders were hard at work weaving thick webs. Mo Fan felt sick to his stomach watching them.

The air was filled with strange, sinister sounds. Mo Fan glanced down at his feet. The vines had almost reached his ankles. If he remained there, the vines looked as if they would soon climb up along his feet!

Weeds grew wildly, vines slithered and intertwined, and trees seemed to thicken. Mingwu Ancient City was so tranquil just moments ago, but now it suddenly began to change. It was as if ten years had passed in this place. It looked wild and primitive and continued to grow.

Mo Fan was shocked. He realized that this city would be no different from the overgrown and horrifying ecosystem he had seen outside now that the statues were gone. The statues had kept everything at bay. Without their protection, the plants and trees grew with a vengeance. It was as if a powerful Mage had cursed the city.

Mo Fan tried not to think about it. He left the city. Both the statue and the ladies from Lichen Afterglow Island were gone, he saw no reason to stay here any longer.

When he arrived at the city gate, he found it covered densely in spider webs. They glowed with a silver light. The webs looked like a giant chrysalis covering the entirety of Mingwu Ancient City. It did not even look like an exit anymore. It looked like a threatening and terrifying ancient magic nest.

Some Crimson Cloud-Eyed Spiders crawled on the silver web watching for those who would wander into their trap.

“Hiss,” came a soft sound from behind Mo Fan.

A female demon with claws, which looked like a spider from the waist down, approached him. It had three tongues. They lashed out like snakes. The sounds it made were so soft that average humans would have been caught by surprise. As it approached, the demonic face cracked into a smile.

Mo Fan turned around right on time and smiled back. His dark-brown eyes became cloudy. The Bewitching Female Spider was startled. It was about to turn around and escape, but all its claws were pinned down by several Giant Shadow Spikes that appeared from behind Mo Fan’s shoulders.

The Bewitching Female Spider lay on the silver spider web like a specimen. It struggled but was unable to escape.

“In the entire Mingwu Ancient City, only your little spiders are active. They are crawling everywhere…” Mo Fan stepped forward.

“Hiss!” The Bewitching Female Spider continued to struggle. It opened its mouth to spray venom at Mo Fan.

“You better think carefully about that. If you answer my question honestly, I may let you go. If you spray venom at me, I’ll cut you into pieces!” Mo Fan raised his hand, poised to throw a spinning blade from his sleeve.

It was the power of the Chaos, an attack method produced by tearing the dimension apart. It pierced through everything, even protection equipment. The Bewitching Female Spider had poisonous and outrageously strong armor, but it would be easy for Mo Fan to slice through it with his Chaos Element magic.

Commander -level creatures had some form of intelligence. This spider was peak Commander-level at that. It was a female demon with human lineage. It was more vicious, but Mo Fan knew that it could understand him very well.

The Bewitching Female Spider became obedient. It knew it could not win against Mo Fan. To him, killing this spider was not any different from stepping on a small pesky spider in the forest.

“Did you see me pass through here with a group of women?” Mo Fan asked.

“Hiss. Hiss. Hiss.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Apas, wake up. Translate for me.” Mo Fan called.

Apas curled up her soft little body and made herself comfortable in her nest in the Contracted Space. She did not have any intention of waking up at his summons.

“I am going to come there and spank you, you know,” said Mo Fan.

“It says that it saw them with you,” said Apas softly, still drowsy with sleep.

“Did it see them again?” Mo Fan asked.

When Mo Fan talked to Apas through a gap in the Contracted Space, the Bewitching Female Spider could smell the female demon. It was so frightening that the female spider almost fainted.

“They left towards the Coconut Sea,” Apas said impatiently. She really wanted to go back to sleep.

“I didn’t even … how do you know? Don’t you fool me.” Mo Fan raised his hand prepared to barge into Apas’ nest.

“There’s no need to interrogate such a weak demon. You can just search its memory!” said Apas sharply. She looked at Mo Fan in displeasure with a pair of bright eyes with a tinge of gold.

“Oh, you’re right. Since you’re awake, you should go out and take a walk. Don’t sleep all day. Look at your slender waist. You’re about to get love handles,” Mo Fan said.
