Chapter 3117: Guardian Snake

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After the rain, the desert emanated a strong smell of mud. Fortunately, the sand in this place was still clean. If the sand had been dirty and was exposed to the scorching sun for a period, the smell would make people vomit.

Some plants in the Gobi Desert started to grow. The rain effectively watered the plants, so the leaves and roots were bright and thick. They could occasionally see a few unknown flowers. The colors of these flowers reminded them of a large bundle of carefully wrapped, bleached, and dyed silks. They bloomed wantonly under a giant rock covered with snake-scale moss. The desert land was like a gray-and-white world against the background of flowers.

“These flowers look like demons that feed on people on the big rock wall. Even though we have walked away, it still feels like they are staring at us… Ah, scorpions! Scorpions! SCORPIONS!” Jiang Bingming suddenly yelled.

Anna, the hunter, was right next to him. She looked beautiful in the desert in a pair of black sneakers and elegant, well-fitted outdoor clothes. She raised her foot and stomped the scorpions into the sand. She then chuckled. “Young man, you don’t belong here in the desert, do you?”

The other students followed suit and laughed.

There were hundreds and thousands of finger-sized scorpions in the land near Cairo.

“I’ve hated these ugly arachnids since I was a child. Snake! Behind you! There’s a snake behind you!” Jiang Bingming suddenly cried out in horror.

Anna did not turn her head. When the venomous snake, hiding behind the rock, attacked her, she grabbed the snake’s neck effortlessly.

“Hiss!”

The venomous snake refused to accept defeat. It kept twisting its colorful body to try to break free.

Anna took a jar from the Space Bracelet and put the fire snake into it. Then, she took a hip flask out as if nothing had happened and took a sip.

“W-Why did you put the snake into a jar?” Jiang Bingming asked, his eyes wide open.

“To make wine. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have this. Didn’t you take a sip before?” said Anna.

Jiang Bingming’s face changed. ‘Was it the snake wine that I drank before? That’s disgusting!’

“You’re afraid of heights, arachnids, and snakes.” Guan Yao shook her head. She did not know why he came to Egypt at all.

While resting, Lingling took Anna to the side to talk.

Anna was surprised when she saw Lingling. Who would have thought that an expert with the qualification of a Seven-Star Hunter was just an eighteen-year-old freshman? After spending some time with her, Anna realized that this young girl had rich knowledge about hunting. She was indeed a real Seven-Star Hunter Master.

“Our professor plans to go to the Sacred Hall of Sunset to find the Pharaoh’s Source, but he hasn’t told us where he got the information. Do you think that a place like that might exist?” Lingling asked Anna.

“Since ancient times, pharaohs sleeping in mausoleums had close connections to Female Demons. About a year ago, someone discovered an Evil Temple under the Sacred Hall of Sunset, but no one found the actual entrance. In my opinion, if there is a Pharaoh’s Source, it must be in the Evil Temple,” Anna replied.

“With our current strength, going to the Evil Temple is the same as offering ourselves to the snake demons as food, isn’t it?” said Lingling.

Anna nodded.

If they entered a mysterious and weird place like the Evil Temple without the company of some Senior Hunters, they might never get out after entering.

“Darkness Creatures call the Evil Temple a palace. It is a channel used to contact the higher-level creatures of the Dark Plane. Female Demons and witches live in it, and strong souls from the Dark Plane may also appear and wander in the Evil Temple,” Anna whispered. Mentioning some things about the Evil Temple might subject her to a curse from unknown forces.

The Evil Temple’s existence had long been strange. It was even more mysterious than the Pharaohs’ pyramids. Few people could describe the actual situation in the Evil Temple up until this point. It seemed that those who survived the Evil Temple had some deep psychological trauma. Even though they all talked about the Evil Temple, it sounded like they were talking about two different things.

“Some people say that the Evil Temple is a dark underground temple. All the pillars, passages, and floors are blue-black, and there is hardly any light inside. Even if they cast Light Element Magic, the overwhelming dark aura will swiftly eat it up. They frequently heard screaming and yelling in the endless corridors and mazes.”

“Some people also say that the Evil Temple is in an endless black underground cave. Walking in this black cave world is like walking on a night without any stars and moonlight. When people are in despair and about to be crazy, the Evil Temple will suddenly appear on top of countless huge black stalactites and shine with ghostly light that attracts people.”

Anna told Lingling several stories of the Evil Temple.

These stories came from those who made it out of the Evil Temple. Until now, people had not figured out why the Evil Temple mentioned by the people who had been there was different.

“Speaking of which, your professor is knowledgeable about Egypt. However, it is challenging to direct a team to the Sacred Hall of Sunset despite having exact locations. We hardly encountered the weird snake demon fighters along the journey,” said Anna.

Lingling nodded. Professor Tong Zhouzheng was a reliable mage, hunter, and scholar.

Lingling had also seen the professor’s profile, which said that the professor had been to many inaccessible places and was obsessed with adventure, archaeology, hunting, and solving puzzles.

The Hunter Society was just one of the societies Professor Tong Zhouzheng had established. Lingling specifically chose his team since he had researched ancient Chinese totems.

Lingling had searched for some information before joining the Imperial College because choosing a good team was of utmost importance. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Many snake demons wandered within thirty kilometers of the Sacred Hall of Sunset. They served as the guardians of the Sacred Hall of Female Demons. According to a legend, the Sacred Hall of Sunset was founded by a great and respectable mage who owned a Giant Snake as a Summoned Beast.

The ancient, respectable mage was on the verge of death, so she used the Sacred Hall of Sunset as her mausoleum and drove everyone away. After she died, the Giant Snake continued to guard her.

The Giant Snake had a long lifespan, and it never left her. It was a pity that the Giant Snake of the Sacred Hall of Sunset gradually became a monster after breaking its contract and connection with humans.

After experiencing reproduction, expansion, and countless wars between humans and demons and also between demons and demons, the Sacred Hall of Sunset finally evolved into a lair of snake people..
