2997 Business Summit in Venice

Their power and tactics appeared weak before the absolutely powerful creature.

Zhao Youqian never expected to be subdued with such ease. He had a large network and was in control of many assets. He had gained various titles in the world arena. However, at that moment, all this appeared to be meaningless.

The water prison lived up to its title.

The water inside the water prison was very freezing. When he was first dropped inside the water, he did not quite feel the cold. After staying in it for a while, he gradually felt bone-chilling pain which became unbearable.

The water prison was dimly lit, hence it lulled one into a sense of peace. However, the water was smelly, and the humid environment made it difficult to close one’s eyes.

Zhao Youqian was not a Mage. He did not have even the slightest interest in magic cultivation. He had a very weak physique. He collapsed easily inside a common water prison.

It took a few days before someone finally opened the water prison door. A middle-aged man in a Zhongshan suit took Zhao Youqian out of the water prison.

After Zhao Youqian left the water prison, he saw a carpet on the floor. He grabbed the carpet and wrapped it around himself like a crazy man. Even so, his lips had turned purple because of the cold. He could barely walk.

“Uncle Qing, what took you so long to save me?! Do you know how I’ve been living in the past two days?! It has to be Zhao Manyan’s doing! I won’t spare him! I’ll assign someone to dig him out!” said Zhao Youqian furiously. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Youqian, it’s Manyan who asked me to release you. He told me your mother’s health has improved. She will be discharged from the hospital today. Manyan will be attending the Business Summit in Venice, so he can’t pick Mrs. Zhao up. He said you must wash and dress up so that Mrs. Zhao won’t suspect anything,” said Uncle Qing.

“Did you say he’s going to attend the Business Summit? Does he have the ability to attend the Business Summit? Damn it! I’ve worked so hard to accumulate the resources and form a good rapport with various parties, and he comes back suddenly and takes it all away!” Zhao Youqian shouted hysterically.

Zhao Youqian’s many years of hard work had been squandered. He couldn’t accept it, especially not when the person was his most hated younger brother.

“You should be more sensible. Many of our family members heeded his orders. Moreover, you are aware that his current status is not inferior to an international great mentor of Forbidden Curse level. Based on this factor alone, hardly anyone in Zhao Group dares to go against him. You’d better take good care of Mrs. Zhao from now on, or you really risk spending your life inside the water prison,” said Uncle Qing with a long sigh.

Uncle Qing was one of the elders in the Zhao Group. He was their father’s right-hand man. He knew the ins and outs of the corporate sector.

Later, he worked for Zhao Youqian. He managed everything so well even in the absence of his father.

Zhao Youqian had not figured out his own situation even to this day. He no longer had the upper hand!

“How is that possible? Don’t be ridiculous! Where’s Zhao Jing? Did Zhao Jing’s group agree to accept him into the Zhao Group, too?” asked Zhao Youqian.

“Zhao Jing’s group submitted to someone else long ago. We didn’t know who that person was before. But I assume you should know who that person is now,” said Uncle Qing.

“Is it Zhao Manyan?” Zhao Youqian was baffled.

Zhao Jing’s supporters were the younger generation in the Zhao Group that were able to compete with Zhao Youqian. Originally, he thought Zhao Jing’s group would select a new leader to preside over the situation after Zhao Jing went missing. Zhao Youqian did not expect that the person would be Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan was about to inherit the massive fortunes of the Zhao Group. Instead of supporting the sidekick, Zhao Jing, they might have decided to support Zhao Manyan. After all, Zhao Manyan was the rightful heir. On top of that, despite the passing of Mr. Zhao, many elderly people in the business arena showed their respect to him. They only dealt with Mr. Zhao’s immediate family members and ignored the rest of the people in Zhao Group.

Zhao Group encountered a severe economic crisis. They needed someone to preside over the situation and lead the company. Zhao Group had to maintain the right to speak at the Business Summit in Venice!

“Take me to the Business Summit. Take me there. He is going to ruin the Zhao Group! He will get us into trouble. He’s still young and is a stranger to those cunning men from the commercial arena. They don’t recognize him!” said Zhao Youqian.

“If you insist, I’ll have to send you back to the water prison. You only have one choice now. Go wash and dress up, then pick Mrs. Zhao up from the sanatorium and chat with her at home,” said Uncle Qing.

“Uncle Qing, what do you mean? Do you mean I—” Zhao Youqian stared at the elder of the family. When he saw the firmness in his eyes, Zhao Youqian realized something.

Uncle Qing was on Zhao Manyan’s side!

‘Why did Uncle Qing think that Zhao Manyan was capable of leading the whole Zhao family and Zhao Group?!’

“Fine. I’ll see how he deals with the cunning old men in the commercial arena. I’ll see how he’s going to give an explanation to our mother. If he messes up things in the Business Summit, Zhao Group’s reputation will be ruined on the international stage. When he dies, I’ll see how he will answer to our father!” Zhao Youqian was so angry that he smashed all the bottles and jars beside him.

...

Zhao Group chaired the Business Summit in Venice. The Five Continents Chambers of Commerce gathered to discuss the development of the major Chambers of Commerce for the next two years. They wanted to set some codes of conduct for the Chambers of Commerce Alliance to avoid damages because of the malicious competitions. They also wanted to exchange ideas with one another. After all, even the hidden clan from the Parthenon Temple would attend the Business Submit, let alone the various continents of consortium and great families that held control of the commercial lifelines!

In the past, too, Zhao Group hosted the Business Summit in Venice.

This year, Zhao Manyan’s father was no longer the host. He had passed away. As his father’s successor, Zhao Youqian worked very hard to prepare for this in the past few years so that he could formally present himself before the world’s chiefs of major consortia, the presidents of the National Chambers of Commerce, the heads of prestigious families, and the major royal focal points.

However, in the end, Zhao Manyan took over his place.

Zhao Youqian’s willpower collapsed.

Zhao Youqian had been waiting for this day. He did everything he could to get ready for this day. He did not expect Zhao Manyan to pretend to be dead all this time and sweep in on this day to take his place!

...

The Business Summit started.

They saw a young man. He looked so young that he did not even have a beard around his mouth.

The young man had blonde hair, which did not quite suit the solemn occasion. Even though he was dressed in a standard burgundy tuxedo, had an upright posture, and exuded an imposing aura, he did not look like someone who was reliable to the VIPs in the commercial arena.

Most of the time, only the leading bosses or highly respected people would host such an occasion. Most of the guests had not seen the young man before.

“Ladies and gentlemen, good to see you. Perhaps, many of you don’t recognize me. I’m Zhao Manyan, the heir of Zhao Group. You can address me as President Zhao. My father has passed away. I’m not here to continue his legend. I’m here to bring all of us to achieve new glory in the commercial arena.” Zhao Manyan gave a simple introductory speech. The warm smile on his face showed his confidence and strength.
