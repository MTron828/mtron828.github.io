“What? He Yao was defeated by someone with the name Mu Bai before he even saw Mu Ningxue?” Li Kuang bounced up from his seat when he heard the news.

Li Kuang was not at the scene, but he was very concerned about the outcome of the duel. He was fervently hoping that Mu Ningxue would lose the duel. Not only did she win the World College Tournament, she had been considered the strongest young adult lately too, not to mention the immense potential of Fanxue Mountain. Many young talents were keen on joining Fanxue Mountain because of her reputation.

Young talents were extremely important for a faction, especially since it was difficult for anyone to improve their cultivation further after reaching the age of forty. A person’s mind and stamina would start to deteriorate in their forties. Cultivation was mostly about exceeding a person’s limits. If a person’s attributes were already deteriorating as they were aging, how could they possibly surpass their limits again?

Therefore, most factions were eager to recruit young and talented Mages. In addition, most powerful Mages that had reached older ages would either belong to a faction, or ask for an insane price!

Many young talents would be gathering to Fanxue Mountain due to Mu Ningxue’s reputation. Wasn’t the Huntress named Shao Yu a perfect example?

Even someone like He Yao, if he had not offended Fanxue Mountain in the first place for being too arrogant; wouldn’t he want to join Fanxue Mountain after losing his duel?

The Dali Clan desperately wanted someone to ruin Mu Ningxue’s reputation in order to suppress Fanxue Mountain’s growth a little. However, not only did He Yao fail to accomplish his mission, he even brought a lot of free publicity to some man named Mu Bai!

“I know that Mu Bai... but I didn’t expect his strength to improve so much in such a short period. Even He Yao was no match for him,” a woman in a red silk qipao behind Li Kuang spoke up.

“Mu Xumian, why didn’t you take part in the contest? Things would definitely have been a lot simpler if you did. That He Yao says he’s going to cultivate in seclusion now,” Li Kuang sighed.

“I can’t show myself in front of the public. My superiors paid a huge price to redeem me from the Dongfang Clan. I can only pull the strings behind the scenes for at least for a year or two. That Mu Bai has ruined my plans once again. If I knew he was so capable, I should have drugged him when he was still naive and taken him down in bed!” Mu Xumian sounded like an aroused vixen.

Li Kuang was already an old man, but his crotch still began to rise when he heard Mu Xumian’s voice.

Unfortunately, even though Li Kuang might be the second-in-command of the Dali Clan, he would not dare to touch this Mu Xumian. The woman was a core member of the Mu Clan. She was like a secretary the central government had sent to inspect a rural area!

“We’ll just treat it like we are giving half of South Wing Street to Fanxue Mountain. It’s not really a big deal. Besides, we will have a lot of chances to get back at them as long as the street is still around. But if He Yao decides to cultivate in seclusion, we have no idea who’s going to be appointed as the chief of the South Wing Platoon,” Mu Xumian mentioned.

Every district would establish a local company like the South Wing Platoon, which was judicially independent, even though it was still considered a subsidiary of the Magic Association. They were the local heroes tapped whenever a city was facing great danger. For example, the Imperial Mages in the Ancient Capital, the Royal Guards in the capital, and the Brown Rock Mages in Dingcheng were such forces. They could be considered the most honorable positions for a local Mage, having a direct influence on the military, Magic Association, government, renowned clans, and other organizations.

Feiniao Headquarters City had been established close to the southeastern oceanfront. It was necessary to establish a reliable company of Mages. The city was planning to recruit fresh blood for the South Wing Platoon through the Young Adults Contest. It might be a newly established force, but it was tightly bound to the city’s fate. The South Wing Platoon clearly held great responsibility and potential!

The Dali Clan wanted to establish their influence over the South Wing Platoon as quickly as possible in order to have more say in the city. It would help them to gradually secure the leading position among the renowned clans of Feiniao City.

“The city council has given out some news.” Li Kuang suddenly frowned.

“What do you mean?” Mu Xumian asked quickly.

“That goddamned He Yao! Not only did he decide to go into seclusion, he even recommended that Mu Bai who defeated him to be the chief of the South Wing Platoon!” Li Kuang swore loudly.

The South Wing Platoon was purely focused on its members’ strength. It was unlikely that anyone could fake their way in.

He Yao was supposed to be appointed as the South Wing Chief after winning the contest, but the man decided to give up on the offer and focus on his cultivation!

He Yao was obviously interested in earning a name for himself. Otherwise, he would not have challenged Mu Ningxue to a duel in front of the public. He knew everyone in the Southeast Region would soon know he had lost to a man named Mu Bai. He was only going to bring shame on himself if he became the Chief of the South Wing Platoon, so he had humbly turned the offer down.

Since He Yao had decided to turn down the offer, Feiniao City had respected his decision and asked him to recommend someone else.

He Yao was not snobbish. He believed whoever was stronger was more worthy to be appointed for the role. Therefore, he recommended Mu Bai, who had defeated him. He believed Mu Bai was a true expert of the younger generation. If Mu Bai was only slightly stronger than him, he would have hesitated to recommend him, but Mu Bai was significantly stronger than him. If he was not appointed the South Wing Chief, who else was worthy to take the role?

“It’s fine, it’s only a recommendation. The city council won’t appoint someone as the Chief so easily,” Mu Xumian reassured him.

“They already did!” Li Kuang responded, his face dark.

“What?” Mu Xumian went closer to read the information. The city council had officially announced the appointment. She could not help but curse, “Is there something wrong with the people in the city council? How could they give out such an important role to a mere kid!?”

Fanxue Mountain...

A celebration was taking place in Fanxue Villa’s main hall that night.

The core members of Fanxue Mountain were seated around a round table. They were raising glasses of red wine while cheering.

Mu Bai retained an awkward smile from his seat. He was returning the favors of those who were congratulating him.

“Congratulations, Mu Bai, you are now the South Wing Chief of Feiniao City! You’re basically the captain of the South Wing Platoon now! You finally have a say in Feiniao City, too!” Mu Linsheng emptied his glass after finishing his sentence.

“Err... I still don’t know what’s going on...” Mu Bai was completely dumbfounded.

He had just come out of seclusion. He was totally unaware of what was going on in the outside world, nor had he known about the Young Adults Contest or the South Wing Platoon. He only knew he had taught an arrogant man named He Yao a lesson, but somehow, it got so much attention in the city that he had ended up receiving an appointment letter afterwards!
