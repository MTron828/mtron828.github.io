Chapter 1138:

The Rate of Summoning is Slower than Killing

Mo Fan was not in a rush to attack the members of the Egyptian team. The Specter Priest was keeping a close eye on him. It would surely attack his weak points if he tried to cast an Advanced Spell.

Meos said in a mocking voice once again, “Magic is all finding the right Elements to engender and subdue other Elements. You’re so stubborn that you’ve only Awakened Elements with high attack. Therefore, it’s very easy to target your weaknesses!”

Meos was not impressed by Mo Fan’s destructive spells.

“Do you seriously think every Tom, Dick, and Harry can take me on so easily? Are you that naive to think that a specter of this level is enough to take me out?” Mo Fan chuckled.

“Stop running then!” Meos assumed Mo Fan was only pretending to be tough.

All Magic save the Light Element was ineffective against a specter. It was a gift that the Egyptian team had specifically prepared for Mo Fan!

Mo Fan went into the woods. The trees were extremely tall. A person could easily vanish without a trace by hiding among them. Mo Fan’s eyes glittered after he went into the woods, firing more than ten Giant Shadow Spikes at the Specter Priest! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Giant Shadow Spikes sealed off the Specter Priest’s movement, but Meos did not seem to care. So what if Mo Fan managed to immobilize the specter temporarily? His magic would never be able to kill it!

“Telekinesis!” Mo Fan’s eyes suddenly turned silver. The overwhelming force struck the Specter Priest like a fierce tide!

Even though the Specter Priest did not have a body, a force with enough strength could still shatter it!

Mo Fan’s mental strength had reached the intermediate stage. The force of his will was not any weaker than an Advanced Spell. The Specter Priest did not stand a chance against it, and its spirit immediately scattered after it was struck by the force of Mo Fan’s will!

Meos’s face darkened when she saw Mo Fan able to take out her specter so easily.

“Meos, is this really the plan you prepared to deal with Mo Fan?” Sayed could not help but ask.

“Shut up!”

“His Space Element is pretty strong too. We have to be more careful!”

Meos was unwilling to accept the outcome. She murmured some strange chants and summoned a few more Specter Priests.

“Meos, stop it, you are only wasting our Pharaoh Spring! A Specter Priest is equal to over two hundred Dark Red Mummies!”

“I don’t care, I must kill this asshole right now!” Meos hatred for Mo Fan was off the charts. The man had even made her pants slip down during the treasure hunt. She would never forget the humiliation!

Meos had Summoned three Specter Priests this time!

A chilly wind started blowing, followed by the ghastly cries of the specters. Mo Fan withdrew into the woods again, taking his time to eliminate the specters.

“Such useless undead, I will eliminate as many as you Summon,” Mo Fan taunted her, trying to enrage Meos even further.

Focusing, Mo Fan saw the Specter Priests lunging at him. He raised his hand and stopped the specters in their tracks!

Stasis Command was only available to Space Mages whose mental strength had reached the intermediate stage. Ai Jiangtu had used the same move to stop the spells fired at him. He simply stood in front of the team fearlessly and defended them. Now that Mo Fan had obtained the same ability, it did not matter how quick these Specter Priests were. Mo Fan just had to reach his hand out and unleash a Stasis Command, and the specters could only struggle to break free!

The Specter Priests hissed like snakes, trying to escape from Mo Fan’s control. Mo Fan’s eyes glittered, using his will as swords to stab the Specter Priests.

“Do you think that my Shadow Element doesn’t have any attacking moves? Giant Shadow Spikes Formation!”

Mo Fan unleashed the Nyx Regime to strengthen the Giant Shadow Spikes. Several shadow needles and swords stabbed the two Specter Priests repeatedly, the dark energy penetrating their spirits and eventually destroying them as they rotted away!

Mo Fan dusted off his hands. It did not take him long to take out the Specter Priests. He glanced at Meos with a grin.

“You won’t be smiling soon!” Meos said coldly.

“I told you, stop sending out these weaklings, they are nowhere enough to take me out,” Mo Fan said.

“Death Saber Mummies, come out!” Meos dripped a few drops of blood onto the ground. A few dark-red Curse patterns formed under her feet, opening up slowly, like an entrance to the netherworld.

Three Death Saber Mummies rose slowly from the ground. They were incredibly huge. It felt like the small island was unable to resist their steps. The death sabers they were holding were absolutely terrifying too, as if there was nothing that the sabers could not slash in half!

These Death Saber Mummies were slow at moving, but the damage of their sabers was shocking. They raised their sabers simultaneously under Meos’ command and slashed ferociously in Mo Fan’s direction. The black shockwaves were surprisingly wide, able to easily raze all the buildings on a street to the ground!

“A bunch of scrubs!” Mo Fan was utterly fearless, and his eyes glittered.

An invisible aura burst out of his body. The deadly slashes could not move any further!

“Kill him!” Meos snapped furiously.

The Death Saber Mummies gathered all their strength and slashed forward again, but the outcome was still the same. The sabers, and the black wind blades they produced, halted in their tracks just as they almost reached Mo Fan, and were unable to move even an inch further!

“Death Saber Mummies... they are just meat lumps to me now!”

The flames engulfing Mo Fan grew stronger. He did not seem to be drawing any Star Pattern, yet his fist suddenly burst into flames as he punched.

His fist slammed heavily onto the ground. Scorching lava immediately erupted across the area as a spectacular, fiery dragon rose and blasted a Death Saber Mummy into the air!

An extremely thick lightning bolt came down from the sky, disintegrating the Death Saber Mummy in midair, their blood pouring down like a rain!

Mo Fan had no trouble taking out the Death Saber Mummies when he was still at the Training Hall. Now that his strength had improved significantly, it was even easier for him to do so!

The three Death Saber Mummies did not have many chances to attack. One was blasted into pieces by lightning, one was compressed into a meat pie with the Space Element, and one was obliterated after being struck by Mo Fan’s Lightning Explosion!

“I don’t believe that you can kill them all!” Meos screamed, and Summoned more undead.

Mo Fan was not stupid enough to just stand there and watch her Summon the undead.

He dashed forward with the Fleeing Shadow. Mo Fan did not give Meos another chance to Summon undead. He fired the Giant Shadow Spikes to immobilize Meos and seal off her mind.

Meos was not willing to give up, either. She quickly ran behind a bunch of Dark Red Mummies and raised her hand, ordering the undead to pounce at Mo Fan.

Seeing that the Giant Shadow Spikes had failed to land on Meos in time, Mo Fan fired the Giant Shadow Spikes at the Dark Red Mummies instead, turning them into a bunch of statues, unable to move.

“Die!” Mo Fan compressed the area using his will again. The outline of a giant rhomboid landed on the area. The ground immediately sank a few meters, and the Dark Red Mummies were crushed into pieces, their blood mixed with the soil.

“Again!” Meos did not seem to care about the loss of the undead. She Summoned another bunch of them, this time around a hundred mummies.

“Ocean of Flames!” Mo Fan cast the Sky-Flame Funeral. Each fireball that landed on the ground immediately set the area on fire, turning the place into a burning sea. The brainless Dark Red Mummies continued to push forward recklessly, even though the whole place was set on fire. The heat was overwhelming, and the mummies were burned into ashes before they could reach Mo Fan.

“Again! More!” Meos continued to Summon more undead. The Dark Red Mummies pushed forward in waves. This time, a Death Axes Mummy was among the few hundred Dark Red Mummies that had appeared. Its size was similar to the Death Saber Mummy, but its body was not fleshy, but sturdy as rocks!

“It doesn’t matter how many there are, they are still going to die!” Every time Mo Fan cast a destructive spell, it would kill hundreds of undead.

This time, Mo Fan used the Sky Lightning Claw, eliminating over two hundred Dark Red Mummies and the Death Axes Mummy!

Soon, a pile of corpses had stacked up in front of Mo Fan. Many spectators that were not Mages were disgusted by the sight. To their relief, they were quite a distance away, so the corpses were basically just a little patch in their eyes.

“Meos, take a rest; I’ll handle him,” Shreev advised her.

“We’ll take him out together!” Meos swore.

Meos was very quick at Summoning the undead. She had Summoned at least five hundred Dark Red Mummies so far, yet Mo Fan had killed every single one of them! Meos’s speed at Summoning the undead turned out to be slower than the speed of Mo Fan killing them!

If Meos failed to keep Mo Fan busy, the five of them would be in great trouble. Once Mo Fan reached them, the whole team would be in disarray, and their undead strategy would collapse!

“Alright, there’s no way he can kill them all. It’s only a matter of time until he’s swallowed by our undead!” Shreev nodded. The two of them would work together to take Mo Fan out.

The undead Summoned by the other three members of the team were enough to keep the Chinese team at bay. Their priority was to suppress Mo Fan the maniac first!

—

Mo Fan continued to push forward. The undead came in waves, so he was able to advance slowly since he was faster at killing them.

Mo Fan was confident that he could take Meos out when he got close enough, and stop the woman from summoning the undead.

“There’s seriously no end to this.”

Mo Fan only took a few steps forward when he felt the ground shaking. More Dark Red Mummies crawled out of it, like maggots coming out to look for food. Their heads poked out from different spots, and soon surrounded Mo Fan.

Mages were afraid of fighting at close distances and being surrounded. Mo Fan assumed the Greek team and English team had lost because of this.

However, Mo Fan had survived the ocean of undead at the Ancient Capital. He was too experienced in dealing with undead. The undead would never be able to trap him!
