As Mo Fan thought, the effects of Time Liquid were only temporary. Half a day later, after everyone had a well-needed rest, the imperious, elegant Flame Belle Empress gradually returned to the little, adorable creature that Mo Fan was familiar with.

Little Flame Belle looked extremely worn out. She squeezed into Mo Fan’s arms and fell asleep.

Mo Fan touched her and discovered that her temperature was a lot higher than usual. It was like holding a little girl that was having a fever. The temperature showed no sign of going down.

It was not Mo Fan’s first time encountering a situation like this. He remembered that Little Flame Belle went through the same process when she was evolving from her Infant Stage to her Adolescent Stage. She was had trouble controlling her flames, and kept tossing the flames out randomly. Mo Fan ended up paying out quite a lot to cover the damages she caused.

“Is she evolving?” Mo Fan wondered happily while fondling the hot Little Flame Belle.

Mo Fan immediately contacted Lingling to confirm his speculation.

“It looks like the Time Liquid isn’t just a temporary stimulant, it does speed up the growth of a creature. Even though Little Flame Belle has gone back to the Adolescent Phase from the Mature Phase, it also sped up her growth. Do you still have the Time Liquid? As a Summoner, the Time Liquid is going to be quite useful for you!” said Lingling.

“I do. Little Flame Belle drank a third of it, so I still have a two-thirds left,” replied Mo Fan.

“Keep it, use it to nurture Little Flame Belle, so she can reach her Mature Phase quicker. After all, at the rate you’re feeding her right now, it will take at least another five to six years for her to evolve. It should be quicker with the help of the Time Liquid,” Lingling told him.

Mo Fan nodded. He was filled with anticipation and excitement.

Mo Fan had witnessed the strength of Flame Belle in her Mature Phase. Currently, Little Flame Belle was about to enter the Youth Stage. If she could reach the Mature Phase quicker, Mo Fan could easily roam across the world with the Flame Belle Empress. He would not even need to use a single spell to crush an enemy. It would surely be incredibly pleasant!

Mo Fan placed Little Flame Belle inside the Contracted Space. The little girl was fast asleep, unaware of the little changes in her body.

Lingling told Mo Fan that Little Flame Belle was most likely going to hibernate for quite a long time. Once she woke up, she would enter the Youth Stage, meaning that her strength would reach the Commander-level.

Even though it was not as strong as Flame Belle Empress, Mo Fan was still happy that Little Flame Belle could evolve.

Commander-level, it was enough for Mo Fan to crush plenty of his opponents...

When the national team stepped through the entrance of the Royal Felipe Castle again, their faces were filled with anger compared to the first time!

“You’re...you’re not dead?” General Mott and his advisors were dumbfounded.

They were up against a hundred thousand monster birds. Did this group of young Magicians receive help from the Heavens? How did they even survive?

“Sorry to disappoint you!” Ai Jiangtu harrumphed coldly.

Even the emotionless Ai Jiangtu was infuriated this time. He would never forgive General Mott for driving them out of the city so readily. However, Ai Jiangtu knew that it was unlikely they could do anything to the general. He could only report the situation back to their country, and someone would surely come and make them pay!

“You are soon going to lose your post. Take off the annoying suit and wait until you are appointed as a soldier to the frontier defense of the worst, most desolated place!” Jiang Shaoxu said coldly.

General Mott chuckled when he heard the Chinese girl threatening him.

“Do you seriously think this is your country? I know you have an impressive background, but don’t you forget, you’re currently in Peru, in Lima, not your China!” answered General Mott with an unpleasant look.

“We’ll make you pay even if it’s across the Pacific Ocean!” snapped Nanyu without mercy.

It was indeed tricky for any of their factions to punish the general. However, if all the factions behind the national team were to stand together, it was a whole different story!

“Is that what you come back here for?” asked the female advisor.

“We’ve come to take our stuff,” replied Ai Jiangtu coldly.

Ariosto finally remembered that he had yet to give the Chinese team their badges. He quickly went back to the castle and came back with the delicate badge of the Peru’s Training Hall.

The badge had their national animal on it, and was carved meticulously. Many Royal Magicians felt honored to wear the badge.

Ariosto handed the badge to Ai Jiangtu. The latter held the badge in his hand...

Suddenly, Ai Jiangtu clenched his fist tightly.

The unique badge immediately turned into a piece of junk. Ai Jiangtu tossed it at General Mott’s feet like trash.

“You... asshole!” The female advisor was infuriated. She pointed at Ai Jiangtu, a magical aura bursting from her body.

General Mott’s face was already like a piece of iron to begin with. It was even darker now.

The badge of the Training Hall basically represented the insignia and flag of a country. Having it smashed into pieces and tossed on the ground like a piece of junk was a great humiliation to both the Royal Magicians and the general of the city, as their duty was to protect the honor of their country!

“Where do you think you are? Show some respect!” General Mott took a step forward and unleashed his aura to suppress Ai Jiangtu.

Ai Jiangtu was totally fearless. He too took a step forward and said in a deep and rumbling voice, “If a country doesn’t even have the guts to protect legal visitors to their country, what respect does it even deserve!?”

“What do you know! It’s Nazca you’ve offended, the God of Death!” yelled General Mott furiously.

“So you are willing to submit yourself to Nazca as slaves, and ignore the monster birds that freely flew across your territory and your coasts!” snapped Ai Jiangtu, pointing at General Mott.

“Humph, if you think so highly of yourself, go ahead and face Nazca. The God of Death will let you understand that it’s not like we don’t want to fight it, but it’s impossible to stand against it!” said Mott.

“Do you think this is the end? Nazca never gives up on the souls it wants to take. Your souls belong to Nazca, they will come and take your souls any time! You can live for now, but you won’t be able to hide from them for the rest of your life. Even if you cross the Pacific Ocean, they will still go after you. When the time comes, the rivers will be flowing with blood, and the cities will be razed to the ground. By then, you will know how idiotic it is to stand against the God of Death!” proclaimed the female advisor.

As the advisor was condemning the group of Magicians furiously, a messenger showed up and whispered into General Mott’s ears.

General Mott was startled. He glanced at Ai Jiangtu, Nanyu, Jiang Shaoxu, and the others in disbelief.

“Don’t look at us like that? I already said it: you won’t be able to keep your position!” mocked Jiang Shaoxu.

Mott looked at the document. He was still immersed in shock.

It was just too fast!

General Mott knew he would be punished eventually, but he never thought the punishment would come so quickly, and it was a lot more serious than he could imagine!

He subconsciously took a few steps back. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Every decision I made was for the sake of the city. How can they do this to me?” General Mott held the document. He felt like he could no longer stand straight.

The advisor glanced at the document and saw her name on the list of people discharged from their positions. Her eyes immediately widened.

She looked at the group of Magicians. She could not find any words at that instant.

How formidable was the background of these Chinese representatives that their superiors would convict them without even going through the lengthy process of investigation, not to mention they were important officials in charge of the safety of a city?

-How is this possible!

-They didn’t even give us a chance to explain ourselves?-

The document had arrived in mere seconds, it was totally unbelievable!

“General... there’s another new document.”

General Mott had yet to recover when another messenger arrived on an Iron-Feather Leopard.

General Mott received the document. His face turned pale as he took a glance at its contents!

Ariosto was standing beside him. He quickly took a glance at the document, and his face immediately turned pale too.

“Many cities in the southwest are attacked by unknown demon creatures. The cities are in complete lock-down!”

“The Ariel Mines are surrounded by enormous demon creatures. Thousands of miners are trapped inside. They are requesting immediate evacuation!”

General Mott completely lost his mind. What’s going on?

Why is the west suddenly being attacked by demon creatures? It felt like a fourth of the country is suddenly in danger!

“Fire Crest Wild Lizards, Blade Demon Spiders, Tornado Hounds...these...these...” Ariosto seemed as if he had lost his soul.

The advisors were all wearing blank faces. It felt like they found the names of the demon creatures more unbelievable than them being dismissed.

Mo Fan frowned when he saw the strange reactions from the advisors.

He had a feeling that the incident of the strange birds was not resolved. The information that General Mott had received and the creatures attacking the country might be related to Nazca that they mentioned before.

-But what exactly is Nazca?

-Why is Peru, a whole country, living in fear of it?

-Does this mean those soulless creatures would never stop coming, including those strange birds!-

“Ariosto, the attack of the birds won’t be the last, right?” Mo Fan asked grimly.

Ariosto looked at Mo Fan and nodded, “Correct, Nazca won’t stop, as long as you’re still alive...”

Everyone was stricken by fear! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The horde of one hundred thousand monster birds wasn’t the last attack?

-Doesn’t that mean the next time they come...-

They did not dare imagine further!
