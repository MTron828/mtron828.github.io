Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The vast territory was covered with beautiful mountains and rivers.

The Green East Sea God flew at a high altitude and overlooked the land of China. They could see the Ancient Great Wall guarding the land of Northern Xinjiang.

At the beginning of magical civilization, the monsters in Northern Xinjiang were the biggest threat to this land. People had experienced the same disaster and pain at that time.

Every period had its disaster and would endure the test of survival.

As the leader of the 20,000 km coastline, Chairman Shao Zheng had been transferred to the west. His transfer was to prepare for the counterattack in the future. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Even if the coast had been defeated, there was still a vast and boundless land. As long as they struggled and endured, they would survive.

After passing through various provinces, they saw the vast and magnificent mountains and plains. The heaviness in their hearts slightly abated.

They were focused on the important things that needed to be done.

“Dean Xiao, my Water Buddha Beads can make it rain heavily. However, there is not enough water in these provinces, so I need your skill as a Forbidden Mage to dispatch enough Water Element for me,” Zhao Manyan said to Dean Xiao.

“I understand. It’s not easy to make it rain heavily on millions of square kilometers. Are you confident you can do it?” Dean Xiao asked.

“Absolutely!” Zhao Manyan nodded earnestly.

…

Mo Fan had been waiting at Beiguan town for a long time. When he saw the Green East Sea God in the sky, his face changed.

When he saw that Dean Xiao was on the back of Green East Sea God, he could not hide his joy.

Mo Fan knew very well how difficult it might have been to pull Dean Xiao away from Magic City, but he was here!

Everything was ready! It was not too late.

“Are you guys all right?” Mo Fan glanced at Mu Bai, Zhao Manyan, and Song Feiyao.

All three looked disheveled and injured. They looked pale. They probably needed time to recover and recuperate.

Everyone shook their heads.

“Let’s start now. The situation in Magic City…” Mu Bai could not complete his sentence.

They needed to go to Magic City in person to be able to know the state it was in.

“Okay, let’s get started. Manyan and I will make it rain, and you guys summon it.” Dean Xiao did not want to waste a second more.

Mo Fan took out the Underground Holy Spring and gave it to Zhao Manyan and Dean Xiao.

Dean Xiao stood on the tower of Beiguan Town in his long robe. His hands slowly stretched out, and there were traces of blue water vapors on his fingertips. When his fingers moved, the water vapors followed the movement.

These water vapors were composed of blue crystals. They were not completely liquid. Every crystal was clear and bright, and contained powerful Water Element energy.

Beiguan Town had a vast land and sky. When the weather was clear, the sky would connect to the ground, presenting a long, soothing arc.

Dean Xiao slowly raised his hands to the top of his head and blue crystals flew up.

These blue water crystals were as fine as sand. At first, they were only scattered over a few kilometers in Beiguan Town. When Dean Xiao whispered, these blue water crystals multiplied at rapid speed.

After a while, blue water crystals surrounded the whole world. These countless blue water crystals were like ice. Each of the water crystals floated individually. The distance between each of them was the same.

Mo Fan and the others watched this incredible scene in Beiguan Town. They were in awe.

Many powerful Mages could shroud the world with magic. However, no one could cover dozens of kilometers of the area with magic particles like Dean Xiao. He was indeed a Forbidden Mage!

Mo Fan watched Dean Xiao manipulate millions of blue water crystals and use them to collide, arrange, absorb and gather. Finally, these water crystals made the windy and dry plain in Beiguan Town completely humid and immersed it in the suspended water crystals.

“Go!”

Dean Xiao raised his hands, and millions of crystals containing water energy were propelled with a strong flying force. The water crystals slanted and flew higher and further in the sky.

The blue water crystals left beautiful blue lines over the land of Northern Xinjiang. These lines were like the mysterious blue meteor shower that bloomed in the depths of the universe. It was exquisite and incredible and enthralled everyone who saw it.

All the water crystals dissipated and scattered in the sky for tens and thousands of kilometers. Some dark clouds appeared in the clear sky. The clouds were very high, and their numbers were increasing. They soon covered millions of kilometers of land.

“How it turns into rain is up to you,” Dean Xiao said to Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan nodded. He held the Water Buddha Beads tightly and concentrated.

The Water Buddha Beads had a strong ability to control water and a capacity to cause natural disasters if not regulated. It would gather a large amount of cloud and moisture in a certain area. This extreme ability often only brought terrible disasters to lands, such as typhoons, rainstorms, hail, and snowstorms.

“Wind!

“Cloud!

“Rain!”

Zhao Manyan threw the Water Buddha Beads high into the sky of Beiguan Town, and the Water Buddha Beads hovered at the highest point. Layers of watermarks emerged like ancient inscriptions. Each of them was extremely huge!

When the strong wind hit, the temperature across the entire plain changed, and the airflow was affected. The air current swept the earth.

The clouds tumbled rapidly with the changes in the airflow. At first, they stopped in the sky. Then, they moved toward the land. The thick clouds were like a long black cloth. The central and northern parts of China were sunny, with the warm sunlight shining on the earth. But in just a short period, the whole situation changed!

A few bean-sized raindrops fell, hitting the stone ground with a crisp splatter.

Suddenly, the rain came down heavily, and the sound increased. Rain instantly shrouded Beiguan Town!

In the past, most of the rain in Beiguan Town was always turbid. The rain was mixed with the flying sand and dust. It became cleaner only after raining for a while.

But this time, the rain was clear. It took on a blue color that felt cleansing.

Blue rain.

Beiguan Town had never had blue rain.
