The investment was like throwing money into the sea; one might end up a povo for the rest of their life!

Mo Fan was still a little worried, but his heart pounded heavily whenever he imagined having a Heaven-grade Seed with four additional effects. He would be able to beat the crap out of a Super Mage, even if he was only an Advanced Mage!

Heaven-grade Seeds were extremely rare. The four additional effects they provided their Element made them extremely powerful. The people would no longer refer to him as the Demon King of Lightning and Fire’s Shadow. They would call him the Rock Emperor instead!

The moths nearby began to panic while Mo Fan was indulging in his fantasies. They beat their wings and streamed into Yu Shishi’s hut.

The Moon Moth Phoenix and the little cub who were enjoying themselves seemed to have noticed something, too. They quickly retreated into the hut and stared in the direction a misty cloud was appearing from.

“Oh my, I’m such a failure as a phantom. The two little creatures in the hut found me first!” The Queen of the Netherworld slowly appeared from the mist.

“Go talk to her outside, they don’t like her presence,” Yu Shishi ordered him.

“Alright!” Mo Fan realized the moths were afraid of the Queen of the Netherworld, judging from their reaction.

Mo Fan and the Queen of the Netherworld moved further away. The playful Queen of the Netherworld used Yu Shishi’s appearance and played with her ponytail, pretending to be an innocent young woman.

“I was also a beautiful and innocent woman back then...” the Queen of the Netherworld said silkily.

“Weren’t you the daughter of a eunuch court?”

“A court eunuch!” the Queen of the Netherworld snapped.

“Oh, what difference does that make?” Mo Fan asked guilelessly.

The Queen of the Netherworld rolled her eyes. It was pointless to argue with an uncivilized man like Mo Fan. She had focus on the matter at hand!

“Things are a little tricky. I think I can no longer obey my king’s order,” the Queen of the Netherworld said.

“You’re setting me free?” Mo Fan said.

“I thought the king is planning to bring the Eight Undead Rulers to the Sacred City of Europe. If a battle breaks out, they could still turn half the city into debris, but the king doesn’t want a bloodbath...(sigh), the king is being too merciful. Those people aren’t his descendants, why is he being so considerate? If I were in his shoes, I would bring hell upon the Sacred City so those arrogant scum know they should respect the undead!” the Queen of the Netherworld declared fervently.

“He’s not bringing the Undead Rulers? He’s the one that the Sacred City is after, yet he’s going alone?” Mo Fan was in disbelief.

“He’s doing it for our sake. After all, the Sacred City has a powerful magic Formation imbued with sacred light. We are pretty much jumping into flames if we go,” the Queen of the Netherworld said.

“Ugh... that’s one way to describe it...”

“He doesn’t want to involve you, nor is he bringing the Eight Undead Rulers. He’s taking matters into his own hands,” the Queen of the Netherworld said.

“But it’s obviously a trap, isn’t it?” Mo Fan exclaimed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“That’s why I decided not to obey him anymore... we are going to the Sacred City. I can’t enter it, but you can lend me a hand. We’ll let the culprits in our homeland live for a few more days. We’ll take care of them after we’re back,” the Queen of the Netherworld said.

“I’ve been waiting for this moment!” Mo Fan said.

There was no place he did not dare to go and nothing he did not dare to do!

—

The Sacred City was located to the west of the Alps. It was managed by both the Holy Judgment Court and the Heresy Judgment Court. It was a place where laws were formed, the laws which every Mage in the world was bound to!

Most books never mentioned the Holy Judgment Court and the Heresy Judgment Court. They had established Magic Associations across the world, yet they were independent of the Magic Associations. They supposedly did not intervene with the functions of the Magic Associations, nor were they involved in the competition between Magic Associations. They were referred to as the Seat of God, as they were only responsible for supervising and purging threats.

Below the Seat of God was the Seven Great Angels.

They were the seven strongest Mages in the Sacred City, so were named after the Seven Angels: Michael, Raguel, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, Sariel, Metatron, and Remiel.

The seven Red Cardinals of the Black Vatican were mimicking the seven Angels of the Sacred City in some ways. Most interestingly, apart from Raguel, Raphael, and Uriel, who were guarding the Sacred City, the identities of the rest of the Angels were not disclosed to the public.

In other words, no one knew who the other four Angels were. The people only knew they existed and were patrolling somewhere, yet they were never seen. They were truly the envoys whom God had sent to the world!

Mo Fan was naturally unfamiliar with the Sacred City. He had only heard about it from Mu Ningxue and the Queen of the Netherworld as they pretended to be normal adventurers.

The Queen of the Netherworld needed a perfect host to get past the Dragon Light Formation of the Sacred City. The person she chose took Mo Fan by surprise. It was the girl who had served him coffee when he was in America, then he had stumbled into again in the Alps: Li Yu’e!

Mo Fan had to visit the Alps to seek her help.

Li Yu’e was surprisingly understanding. It was weird being possessed by a phantom. She would retain her consciousness while her body was controlled by something else. She would not be able to resist if the Queen of the Netherworld started messing around with Mo Fan, yet she did not get to enjoy the pleasure of it, either.

“Since no one knows who the four Angels are, isn’t it possible that they might be the Black Vatican’s Red Cardinals? For example, if they messed up during an important mission and left an obvious clue behind, so they pretend it was the doing of the Black Vatican’s Red Cardinals and play the whole world like a fiddle,” Mo Fan speculated.

“Mo Fan, if we are part of a fictional story, someone like you who spoils the ending would most likely die on the spot. You might die of poison in the middle of your sentence!” the Queen of the Netherworld chided him.

“Ugh, my imagination might be a little far-fetched, but it’s still a possibility, right?” Mo Fan said awkwardly.

“The Seven Angels possessed the power of Forbidden Curses. They are called Forbidden Curses for a reason. We are more worried about their after-effects than their power. The places targeted by a Forbidden Curse will lay barren for several dozen years. The presence of magic and the spaces about it will be distorted, so they are no longer habitable for humans... even us Undead despise places like that,” the Queen of the Netherworld informed him.
