A man in a black-golden robe was standing on top of the Dongfang Oriental Tower, four hundred and sixty meters above the ground.

The modern district was right under his feet, with several dozen other skyscrapers soaring into the sky. He was looking down at the spacious highways and busy streets.

The man lifted his gaze and looked into the distance.

The dam was not high enough to block the skyscrapers. The barrier was looming over Lujiazui District, which had yet to become a part of the sea. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The shadow of the sea monster was extremely clear in the distance. Strong winds were blowing in the sky and across the surface of the cloudy water. Magical lights were flickering occasionally in the distance, like stars being devoured by darkness.

“We must act at once. If we wait any longer, we might lose something precious to us,” the man stated.

“Indeed, we are constantly losing our men to the sea monster. We used to be able to slay every level of demon creatures that invaded our territory, but now, the creature is about to reach the city,” replied another man hiding in the shadows. His hovering outline was barely visible.

“Let’s do it then, we must show that arrogant creature our strength!” Another figure took shape in the sky.

The three of them were at the top of Dongfang Oriental Tower, which was nearly within reach of the clouds. At the same time, they were able to view the city and the coasts!

The man in a black-golden robe, the man hovering in the air, and the blurry figure in the clouds disappeared as soon as they reached an agreement. Only the man in the black-golden robe was visible. He turned into a black-golden ray and swept across the dark sky, leaving a visible crack in the air behind him!

The pale-faced commander looked up, and only then could he see the three figures in the sky. They were joining the battle without announcement, but they held tremendous Auras!

“The Top Seaters!” The commander finally showed a hint of an expression on his face.

The High Seaters were the mages holding power in the Dongfang Oriental Tower, but there was a smaller group of people who stood at the top.

They had yet to become Forbidden Mages, but their titles were comparable to that of a Forbidden Mage. The only difference was they were not able to use Forbidden Curses.

The Forbidden Mages were powerful not only because they could use Forbidden Curses capable of destroying the world, but because their magic had also reached an incomparable level. Even Super Mages with four Elements at the peak of the Super Level would feel helpless against them.

Three half-Forbidden Mages, the Top Seaters of the Dongfang Oriental Tower!

They were the only ones capable of exterminating the Sea Skeleton King.

In order to exterminate their target, their strength had to exceed their target by a huge margin. If the three half-Forbidden Mages had been involved in the battle at the beginning, there would have been only one outcome: the enemy would have run away instantly.

The Sea Skeleton King was very cautious. They had to lure it deeper into their territory and draw it in by making it angry from inflicting damage on it in order to kill it!

Any sacrifice was worth it as long as they could kill the Sea Skeleton King!

“The Top Seaters are on the move. They are all half-Forbidden Mages!” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

Before Mo Fan had gone to Qinhuangdao, the strongest Mage he had ever met was the last Totem Guardian of the Moon Moth Phoenix, Yan Shi. Her Earth Magic had left him in awe. The battle between her and the Giant Purple Linden Tree had been mesmerizing!

The Sea Skeleton King was stronger than the Giant Purple Linden Tree, without a doubt. The Magic City had to send out three Top Seaters whose strength was on par with Yan Shi to kill it!

The battle was too spectacular. The war Mo Fan had fought on the Andes Mountain Range was just a little brawl in comparison.

Mo Fan had witnessed a crazier war when the two kings of the Undead clashed in Beijiang. The epic battle between the eight Undead Rulers and the Sphinx, the Medusa Queen, and the Mummy King…

However, it was definitely Mo Fan’s first time seeing so many powerful human Mages in a battle.

Every Top Seater was strong enough to take on a Supreme Ruler alone.

The three Top Seaters instantly dominated the battle. Their use of magic had completely surpassed the need to construct Star Orbits. They were also able to use Super Powers casually.

The formidable power they unleashed originated from their bodies. It was like a Martial Artist who had fully mastered a technique. He had trained the basic movements of his limbs into unstoppable moves!

The Sea Skeleton King had been butchering the Mages after Summoning its Waves of Bones. Even the Formation of Heaven-Rupturing Swords had failed to keep it at bay.

However, the Sea Skeleton King was constantly backing away after the three Top Seaters joined the battle. Its injuries had worsened while its Aura was suppressed by the Top Seaters’ sacred light. It could no longer pose a threat to the Mages on the wasteland.

“It looks like we no longer have to move,” Mo Fan noticed.

The other Mages did not stay on the side after the Top Seaters got involved. They cooperated with the High Seaters, generals, and the Advanced Platoons who had regained their morale to pin down the Sea Skeleton King.

The Sea Skeleton King suddenly received a Vast Blade as it was backing away. It was a spell from the man in a golden robe.

The Vast Blade was a Chaos Spell. The Sea Skeleton King’s arm had vanished after the slash hit it. It was unable to regenerate it from the seawater.

The Sea Skeleton King’s arm was gone, brought to another dimension. The creature kept shrieking in agony.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Everyone followed the three Top Seaters and hunted the Sea Skeleton King.

The Sea Skeleton King finally lost its unstoppable demeanor. It was losing its vitality!

“It’s trying to escape!” the commander shouted.

A general shouted furiously and stood in the direction the Sea Skeleton King was escaping into. His body had turned into a scorching furnace from the Super Power he had. The tide falling back to the sea evaporated rapidly. The whole area turned into dry land!

“Die!” the man in a black-golden robe uttered.

His Chaos Magic did not bring death, nor was it used to trick his enemy, but it was made things disappear without a trace. There was no body or soul left behind.

The other two Top Seaters were obviously treating the man in the black-golden robe as their leader, suppressing the Sea Skeleton King’s movement and power on its sides.

“You will soon be sent to a dimension that even Hell will shiver before!” the man in a golden-black robe swore.
