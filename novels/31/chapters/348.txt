Chapter 351: The Astounding Figure

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

The strong wind blew past as the beast sprinted along. Unlike in the wild, riding the Swift Star Wolf as it sprinted in a developed city was a totally different experience. The tall buildings quickly swept past on the sides, the beast easily caught up to the running vehicles on the streets. Mo Fan also caught a glimpse of the terrified or jealous gazes of the pedestrians...

At a time like this, did Mo Fan care if he had a Summoned Beast Permit for Hangzhou City?

As a matter of fact, every city had clearly stated that Summoned beasts were not permitted to run freely on the streets, to avoid stirring unnecessary terror. The rule did not apply to Magicians on duty, as they were given special permits to do so.

Mo Fan could not care less about not having the permit, as he believed no one would dare to stop him. Besides, he was using the motorway, thus he would not bring any harm to the pedestrians!

However, when approaching the central area, Mo Fan did not dare to swagger. He withdrew the Swift Star Wolf and folded the wheelchair open before placing Xinxia on it. He could finally push Xinxia around as they went shopping...

The weather was fine. The sun was shrouded behind the clouds. Occasionally, a soothing breeze would fondle their faces. It was definitely the perfect weather to go shopping.

Mo Fan bought a hot drink for Xinxia. She held it with both her hands and took a small sip at times. Her eyes were scanning the shops nearby, the delicate display windows with dazzling items, and the things that she was fairly interested in. Due to her impaired movement, she rarely had a chance to go shopping in a busy district, nor would she have the chance to leap with joy after finding an ornament that she was extremely fond of. Xinxia had many friends, who were exceedingly kind to her. However, not just everyone would spend so much time hanging out with her at places like this. She seemed rather out of place among the walking pedestrians, the overhead bridges on the streets, and the escalators in the shopping malls.

It was easier when Xinxia was going shopping with Mo Fan.

Mo Fan would just carry her when there were stairs in the way. He was rather willing to do so, as it gave him the chance to take advantage of her at times. The guy would have a sense of achievement when he saw her blushing adorably. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After choosing a garment, Mo Fan pushed Xinxia into the dressing room.

“I can do it myself.” Xinxia left Mo Fan outside and pulled the curtain.

“It’s fine, I wouldn’t mind it,” said Mo Fan with a shameless grin.

For the past two years, they had both been busy at their respective schools. They did not meet often , thus it had been a while since he last checked on her puberty. He had not been fulfilling his role as a brother.

Unlike the shameless Mo Fan, Xinxia still had principles she would abide by. No matter how hard Mo Fan tried, she was determined not to let him help her change!

Xinxia did not have a problem standing up. Her straight yet thin legs were more attractive than most of the girls at her age. They were like a piece of art that had not received any damage...

She never needed anyone’s help to change her clothing, including changing into a dress!

On a side note, Mo Fan definitely had no taste in choosing garments for a woman. He only saw a rather retro piece of clothing, and assumed that it fit Xinxia’s personality in his imagination. As such, he immediately claimed that she would look good in it without even considering the price.

It was a long-sleeved gown similar to the design of the garments during the Han Dynasty, with a silk ribbon acting as a belt. It was suitable for autumn. Instead of a piece of vintage that looked like it had traveled across time, it had a mix of the current trend too. It did not stand out too much when Xinxia was wearing it. It felt natural, fresh and trendy, with a strong sense of Chinese culture.

Mo Fan satisfyingly swiped his card, seeing Xinxia’s fresh look.

The full experience of going shopping surely included buying great food. Mo Fan soon arrived at a fairly tall restaurant with a spectacular view.

He could act willfully, as he was rather rich now. Similar to most of the rich people, Mo Fan enjoyed going to luxurious restaurants with glass windows. He would choose a spot close to one, and enjoy the view of the modern city. He would order a glass of coke...Uh, wine, and had an enjoyable time with a gorgeous beauty across the table. Ah, what a pleasant life!

Mo Fan did live like a caveman before. He had experienced a tense atmosphere where a grave danger would possibly lunge at him at any second in the wild. As such, he was treating the chance to live a calm, sweet life preciously.

Xinxia, who was feeling the moment in a similar manner, stared at Mo Fan’s eyes as she grumbled, “Brother Mo Fan, can you please not leave the city again?”

“Don’t worry about me, it wasn’t that dangerous,” Mo Fan said with a grin.

“Ningxue has already told me.” Xinxia twisted her lips. She knew Mo Fan would try to comfort her and stop her from worrying.

“Oh, oh...” Mo Fan rubbed his head awkwardly.

Mu Ningxue and Xinxia had always been close. Therefore, it went without saying that Mu Ningxue would tell Xinxia the entire incident. Mo Fan suddenly realized that him trying to comfort Xinxia with a lie was a bad move.

He had to be more cautious. He had to consider the possibility of his first and second wives colluding before lying to them.

Mo Fan was not interested in continuing the topic. He glanced at the scenery outside, hoping to shift Xinxia’s attention.

It was a very tall building. Although they were a few tall structures nearby, they were unable to block the perfect view that the restaurant had.

His gaze quickly skimmed through the buildings nearby, reflecting the colorful lights of the city, and saw the West Lake which had been relatively calm for centuries in the distance... For some reason, as he glanced at the reflection on the surface of the lake, Mo Fan’s mind was occupied with the ugly Giant Lizards, possibly because he had been seeing too many swamps recently.

Slightly to the left was a tall building that belonged to a bank.

The building was polygon-shaped and had a pointy top. It had silver LEDs spread all across it, and was built mainly with refined glass. From Mo Fan’s angle, he could see an outdoor swimming pool with a side glance.

The swimming pool was obviously not open to the public. There were only a few girls in their bikinis there...

Somewhere on his right stood a five-starred international hotel. It was surely one of the tallest buildings nearby. It was famous in Hangzhou due to its spectacular view across the West Lake.

From Mo Fan’s angle, he could see the entire five-starred luxurious hotel.

“Strange, we just walked past there. What’s that building?” Mo Fan finally found a potential topic to shift Xinxia’s attention. He pointed at the tall black shadow between the skyscraper and the five-starred hotel.

Xinxia turned her head around with a confused look.

“It doesn’t have any light. Is it new?” asked Mo Fan.

Xinxia shook her head, “I passed by the area recently, but I don’t recall seeing the building...”

After taking a closer look, Xinxia suddenly acted strangely. She turned around and said with a weird expression, “Brother Mo Fan, I don’t think it looks like a building.”

“It doesn’t look like a building?” Mo Fan was startled.

Mo Fan quickly took a closer look with his senses. He was shocked in the next second!

Mo Fan’s face gradually filled with disbelief, which soon turned into fear as he got a closer view of the shadow. In the end, he was overwhelmed with fear!

The shadow that was standing in the busiest district in Hangzhou slowly turned around!

It was as if... It was turning around after being aware of someone looking at it.

It was literally turning around!
