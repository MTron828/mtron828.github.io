One after another, the Swallowing Sea Bass were moved into the bunker. With a reliable chef seasoning the Swallowing Sea Bass, the people quickly ate the sea monsters clean. Their skeletons were perfect, like specimens in a museum.

All ten Swallowing Sea Bass were eaten, and not just because the people in the bunker had finished them all to satisfy their hunger. Most of the people were so full they could not eat anything else.

The flesh of the Swallowing Sea Bass was of extremely high quality. After all, they were Commander-level creatures. Even a small piece of their meat was enough to supply an ordinary human enough energy, not to mention the Swallowing Sea Bass’ extraordinary size!

The meal was enough to satisfy the hunger of all of the people in the bunker. By the time they grew hungry again, the Mages would hopefully have thoroughly cleansed the river. The people were able to wait inside the bunker with peace of mind.

“Mr. Wei Rong, are the students of the Pearl Institute always so resourceful?” Ma Yong asked after a loud burp.

“Not all of them. This young man is just… a little special,” Wei Rong admitted carefully.

Everyone in the Pearl Institute knew who Mo Fan was. He was the young man who had challenged everyone when he first enrolled in the school and forcibly claimed the resources allocated to the new students of his batch.

When he moved to the Fire School at the main campus, he had even challenged two hundred students of the Fire School with high profiles!

He had made a name for the Pearl Institute by defeating the great talents of other countries in the World College Tournament and made his country proud, albeit he got himself into a lot of trouble.

Wei Rong had not heard a lot about Mo Fan since the World College Tournament. Either he had kept a low profile, or everything he was involved in was kept confidential. He was walking a different path than other Mages!

If only the Pearl Institute had more students like him...

Mo Fan had been able to use his unreasonable strength to protect them from the strong waves of calamity, while everyone else was at a loss. He could think of a way outside the box when the people grew uneasy. He had hunted sea monsters and grilled them to feed the refugees in the bunker. He had thoroughly displayed the unyielding spirit of the Chinese in tough situations!

——

Mo Fan rested in the bunker after he was done eating. Zhao Manyan called him after he had almost recovered his energy.

“The entrance of the river has been sealed off. No sea monsters are going to sneak in again,” Zhao Manyan informed him.

Mo Fan soon received some news from Mu Bai, too. He had worked with Apas and the Royal Striped Grey Wolf to kill off the powerful sea monsters in the Dianshan Lake.

There should not be any Ruler-level creatures left in the Huangpu River. The remaining sea monsters were just sheets of loose sand. That should be enough to return peace to the shorelines.

Mo Fan relayed the information to Ma Yong, who immediately informed the residents of Bing Town.

They all cheered happily. They could leave the bunker soon!

Mo Fan continued with the purge after he had rested up. The Organ Crystals, Soul Remnants, and Soul Essences of the sea monsters were quite valuable.

Ding Yumian gave Mo Fan with her full assistance. Mo Fan no longer had to go wandering around in circles chasing the sea monsters with a powerful Psychic Mage helping him. He could just kill the sea monsters wherever he went!

The slaughter continued for two days and two nights. Mo Fan’s energy was depleted again.

If someone had the Blessing Element, he would have been able to recover his energy quickly and continue on with the purge. However, the Blessing Element was exclusive to the Parthenon Temple.

“Senior Mo Fan, Senior Ding, you should go back and get some rest. Leave it to us!” Zhang Zhuo told them. “We now have at least thirty people in our group. We can run away if we are no match for the Commander-level sea monsters. Most of the bigger sea monsters are dead. Only Warrior-level sea monsters are left!”

Mo Fan nodded. His energy was already spent, so it was meaningless for him to stay there. He had to recover his energy again if he wanted to help.

——

Mo Fan realized he was sleeping on the rug by his couch after he woke up.

He somehow picked up a pleasant smell. He immediately saw someone’s disheveled hair and the side of a fast-asleep face, which made his heart race.

Mo Fan still had a splitting headache as a consequence of using all his energy. He shook his head, trying to recall what had happened, when the door suddenly swung open.

A pair of spectacular E-cup breasts entered the room, followed by an adorable face.

The woman dropped the takoyaki in her hands. She was holding a pair of disposable chopsticks and carrying several bags in her arms. She stared at Mo Fan and Ding Yumian, who were lying beside the couch in disbelief.

“Can’t...can’t you two do it in the room? The living room isn’t where you are allowed to do your filthy acts!” Ai Tutu snarled.

—

Mo Fan finally recalled what happened after his mind cleared.

Ding Yumian fainted on their way back from exhaustion. She must have never used so much of her energy before, and was deeply asleep.

Mo Fan had no clue where she lived. He had no choice but to bring her back to his place after returning to the Pearl Institute.

Mo Fan had also felt light-headed as soon as he reached home.

He was suffering the side effects of energy depletion, and could not withstand the urge to sleep. He had ended up fainting, too. What a pity, he initially thought he could have done something with the girl.

—

Ai Tutu was the kind who could not keep any secrets. Rumors soon spread through the school.

Many people also saw Mo Fan and Ding Yumian working closely together during the battle with the sea monsters, resulting in rumors that the demon king had successfully taken two goddesses of the school as his mistresses!

Mo Fan was lost for words to explain himself. Why did he bear the bad reputation, even though he had yet to do anything to either of them?

Mo Fan had a feeling the reputation he had earned through his recent contributions was completely ruined.

However, there were many people who were supporting Mo Fan on the forum.

“Why are you all being jealous if he’s capable of keeping the goddesses as his mistresses? I’ll be honest, if Mo Fan is willing, I can be his fifth, sixth, or seventh concubine!” someone commented.

Mo Fan was surfing the forum while he was resting. He immediately clicked on the person’s profile after seeing the comment.

Mo Fan immediately felt refreshed after seeing the person’s profile picture. He had never seen such a tanned otonoko before, not to mention the extremely red lipstick the man had put on.

He should be relieved that Mo Fan did not assume he was a sea monster, let alone take him as a concubine!

“Stop trying to get other people’s attention. Our demon king is a man with high standards. I even took the initiative to ask if he was willing to take me as his mistress, but he told me in person that he’s already a man with a family and lovers, that I’m not worthy of him,” a woman called Lu Qingyao commented.

Lu Qingyao’s comment soon attracted plenty of replies.

“I want to be a man with a family and lovers too!

“+1, I want to be a man with a family and lovers!”

“...”

Mo Fan’s expression darkened.

That b**ch Lu Qingyao was trying to set him up! Was she still holding a grudge against him because he had not accepted her?
