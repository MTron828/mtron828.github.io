1513 Double The Quantity

The group waited in New Suez for around five days. Surprisingly, Mo Fan did not follow Zhao Manyan as he looked for hookers in the bars of New Suez. In fact, he went to the battlefield and finished the jobs of the Battlemages like a special reinforcement soldier.

Mo Fan was trying to collect as many Soul Remnants and Soul Essences as he could. He had suddenly become an ambitious young man ever since he gained the Magic Medium Ring. The Battlemages of New Suez found themselves in an awkward situation.

Several times they came up with the right strategy to deliver a great blow to their enemies with a counterattack, yet when they arrived, they would only find remains of demon creatures scattered across the place. They ended up cleaning up the mess that was left behind instead!

Mo Fan was able to weave through the battlefield freely all the time. He single-handedly took out some of the Lamias’ nests that even the army was struggling to take down. The soldiers of New Suez enthusiastically supported him. If this lunatic was not charging around so violently in enemy territory, leaving some gaps in the enemy ranks, a lot more troops would be dying in the fighting!

In those five days, Mo Fan collected thirty-four more Warrior-level Soul Essences, and together with the ten from before, his Summoning Gate could now Summon forty-four extra White-Marked Wolves. The number of wolves he could Summon would soon exceed a hundred!

Unfortunately, the Lesser Lamias began to retreat on the sixth day. Even though he only needed to hunt them for another day or two, he lost his chance...

Mo Fan arrived back to the hotel when it was almost dark. He was going back to his room to get some rest when he saw Brianca standing in front of the door, staring at him with eyes that resembled the moon.

Brianca was surprisingly tall, slightly taller than Mo Fan when she was wearing heels, thus at times, she would have an unapproachable demeanor.

“Didn’t you promise me?” Brianca asked coldly.

“I only went to the outskirts to practice my magic. It’s not as serious as you think,” Mo Fan chuckled. He was so good that he could utter lies right off without hesitation.

“You didn’t go to the battlefield?” Brianca asked again.

“Of course not, why would I go there? I’m not crazy,” Mo Fan did not blush, nor did his heart rate increase. Brianca was actually quite naive. If he answered her question in a serious manner, she would not doubt him any further.

“Show me your Ring,” Brianca suddenly said.

Mo Fan gasped. Why did Brianca not act according to plan?

“My God!” Brianca exclaimed loudly. Some tourists nearby turned around and wondered if Mo Fan had done anything inappropriate to the beautiful woman.

“We’ll talk inside...” Mo Fan felt a little awkward. He opened the door and dragged Brianca into the room. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Mo Fan shut the door. He did not even have the chance to turn on the light when he felt Brianca glaring at him like a kindergarten teacher watching a little kid that had done something wrong, or a big sister who was angry at her younger brother!

“It’s already double the quantity! Maybe I should praise how talented you are instead!” Brianca grunted.

“I’m just being very lucky. I managed to find a Commander-level Soul Essence. I was deciding between selling it to cover my living expenses or feed it to the Magic Medium Ring,” Mo Fan said.

“Was I referring to that now!?” Brianca slightly raised her tone, displaying her authority as the Head of Discipline of the Alps Institute.

“Oh, oh... it’s my bad, I shouldn’t be so reckless and have gone to the battlefield,” Mo Fan decisively admitted quickly.

Brianca was lost for words when she saw Mo Fan admitting his mistake so quickly. The speech that she normally used to discipline her students no longer had any use...

“Are you injured?” Brianca’s tone eventually softened. She sounded more like a caring sister.

“Nothing serious, they will heal soon without treating them,” Mo Fan said.

“Show me,” Brianca said.

“Is that necessary?... I’m fine, really,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan noticed that Brianca was now able to tell if he was lying. She no longer believed his words so easily. He sighed. -Why did people always change so quickly?-

It was reasonable that Brianca did not believe Mo Fan was only slightly injured. She had already seen Mo Fan’s fighting style. He kept rushing into the middle of the demon creatures. She found it hard to believe that he was unharmed!

The Lesser Lamias and Lamias were not strong enough to threaten Mo Fan’s life, but these demon creatures were not just machines; their attacks, poisons, and abilities were different from one to another. They were too many uncertainties in a fight, and even the strongest Mage would struggle to stay uninjured.

“You call these minor injuries?” Brianca raised her voice again. She immediately took out a few serums as if she was doing a magic trick.

“For me, they are,” Mo Fan said.

“Lie down.”

“I don’t think that’s appropriate, Miss Brianca.”

“Don’t you underestimate the poison! Look at the wounds yourself; they aren’t healing, they are rotting instead. We have to deal with the poison in your blood!”

“Oh, I seriously didn’t realize it. I have the medicines for that too, it’s from the Parth... a friend of mine gave them to me,” Mo Fan took out some antidotes and medicines out from his space bracelet.

Xinxia had filled up his space ring with the best medicines before he left the Parthenon Temple.

Xinxia did not care if Mo Fan was constantly fighting demon creatures. She knew her advice would not change his mind. Mo Fan was like a wild hound that could never be tied down. Therefore, she simply prepared all kinds of medicines for him. Senior Hunters would go mad if these medicines were sold in the marketplace. Mo Fan did consider selling them to earn some money, but decided not to, since they were gifts from Xinxia.

“These are the Parthenon Temple’s medicines. I bet you’re pretty close with them,” Brianca said expressionlessly. She recognized the medicines right away.

The medicines of the Parthenon Temple had different grades. The best kinds were from the Mountain of the Goddess, without a doubt. They were usually auctioned off at marketplaces, but the Parthenon Temple was reluctant to sell them most of the time.

However, Mo Fan simply treated them as normal medicines. Brianca was more than smart enough to realize how valuable they were.

“They aren’t that precious...” Mo Fan immediately found himself in an awkward situation.

He wondered if Brianca and Heidi would fall out with him right away if he told them his wife was the future Goddess of the Parthenon Temple.

Brianca did not dwell on the relationship between Mo Fan and the Parthenon Temple. She treated Mo Fan’s wounds and said, “I’m heading to the Mediterranean Sea for some business. I can’t bring Heidi with me, so please look after her for me when you all depart for Cairo tomorrow.”

“Got it,” Mo Fan nodded.

“I’m heading off soon. I actually came to tell you about it,” Brianca said.

“Is there any problem? Can I help?” Mo Fan asked.

“I can deal with it myself.”
