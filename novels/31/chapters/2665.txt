Chapter 2667: The Curtains of the Battle

Fanxue Mountain was in deep trouble, but its people had stayed behind nonetheless. It was enough to prove that the efforts of Mu Ningxue and the others had put in over the years were not in vain.

Humans would be afraid when they did not know what to do. When you saw someone else running away like they already had an escape plan, while you yourself did not know where to go or what to do, you would eventually feel at a loss.

However, when you saw many people were unwilling to run away and were thinking of picking up weapons to put up a fight, your fear would vanish, too. There was no point in thinking too much about what to do, since the only thing they had to do was to defend their home until the very end. Humans were a lot simpler and stubborn when something they treasured deeply was being threatened!

They had chosen to stay and defend Fanxue Mountain because they did not want to become homeless again. Why would they even consider running away as an option?

Their heart already belonged to this place. They were able to share in its growth and stand together in difficult times!

When Mu Ningxue saw Mu Jiang, Gu Ying, and the other captains, she had assumed they were the only ones left, but thousands of members that Fanxue Mountain had recruited were preparing for battle at the back of the mountain.

Even if Mu Ningxue’s heart was a mountain of ice, it had still melted after seeing how united the people were. Her eyes started to tear up.

This was exactly the Fanxue Mountain she had planned to build. It was supposed to have a soul, instead of being just a city with a pretty but empty shell!

“All of you are going to put up a fight?” Li Dong could not believe what he was hearing.

He already knew Mo Fan was too arrogant to surrender, but why were Fanxue Mountain’s people just like him? Did they not realize how bad the situation was for them? Were they not aware of how strong the enemy waiting down the mountain was? They would be taken out in mere minutes!

“Do any of us look like we are going to surrender?” Shao Yu retorted.

“But… you didn’t do anything wrong! You are a renowned clan, protected by the laws of the country! As long as you hand over the Earth Flame Pistil, they no longer have a valid reason to attack you. Some of them might consider staying out of the mess. That way, Fanxue Mountain will still exist. Perhaps you might have to compromise a little more, but anything is better than ending up dead!” Li Dong tried to change their minds.

“Li Dong, Fanxue Mountain’s situation isn’t as simple as you think. Ever since Feiniao City was made a Headquarters City, many officials have come up with all kinds of excuses and dirty tricks to try and take this land from us. You are truly underestimating those people if you think they are only here for the Earth Flame Pistil. It was only a matter of time before this happened. Zhao Jing just happens to be taking the lead!” Bai Hongfei knew exactly why they were in their current pinch. After all, he had grown up in a renowned clan, too. How could he not know what those other renowned clans were thinking?

Li Dong took a deep breath. He calmed himself down and reassessed the situation.

Fanxue Mountain was indeed a piece of juicy meat in the eyes of many officials and Councilmen. Even the Dali Clan had always wanted to claim it as its own.

It was only a matter of time before this day arrived. The Earth Flame Pistil was indeed just an excuse.

If Zhao Jing was not involved, someone else would be forcing the issue. Either Fanxue Mountain evolved into a powerful clan that no one could easily threaten, or it would eventually face its destruction in the never-ending game of power between the renowned clans.

Li Dong was lost for words.

A magical moth with a special glow about it flew into the hall and stopped in front of Yu Shishi. Yu Shishi reached out so the moth could land on the back of her hand.

“They are coming,” Yu Shishi informed everyone grimly.

“Let’s go. We should find a better place to fight them,” Mo Fan said.

“The Stepped Fields at the front of the mountain should do,” Mu Ningxue agreed.

Fanxue Mountain had constructed a lot of battlefields and training grounds. Mu Ningxue had always emphasized the importance of becoming stronger. Fanxue Mountain did not have a lot of facilities, but there were training grounds and dueling arenas everywhere.

The Stepped Fields were not actually terraced fields. It was a battleground with slopes and fields of different sizes. The smaller ones, around the size of a soccer field, were used by Mages to practice their spells. The bigger ones were like luxurious golf courses.

Zhao Jing and Lin Kang’s men claimed they were representing the government in retrieving the country’s possession. They were obviously not going to fight Fanxue Mountain in the city. The Stepped Fields had plenty of space available. They were not suitable for residential purposes, but they were a perfect battlefield!

“We won’t spare any single one who dares to step into our territory!” Mo Fan stated bombastically.

“Ugh… it sounds a little exaggerated, but that’s the spirit we need.”

—

The group walked out of Fanxue Villa. The buildings of Fanxue Villa were protected by a magical Barrier, but they chose to walk out of the Barrier and face their enemy at the Stepped Fields instead of hiding behind their defenses.

It was quite a large group. The two mountains with a great contrast to one another, like a volcano and an icy mountain, were Fanxue Mountain’s trademark. When the group made up of two thousand people appeared at the top of the hills like they were ready to fight, the people who were going up the hills froze.

“Why are there so many people? I thought someone said they had already run away?” the Vice Captain of the North City’s regiment exclaimed.

“I’m afraid only the non-essential personnel have left. Those people are the official recruits of Fanxue Mountain. No wonder people always say Fanxue Mountain is a bunch of reckless lunatics! They weren’t lying at all! These people don’t even know their place. They are like a mantis trying to stop a chariot with its arms!” Nanrong Xu laughed.

Nanrong Ni’s expression sank. She had hoped that Fanxue Mountain would be empty, leaving only the stubborn Mu Ningxue behind.

Mu Ningxue was truly a b**ch. No one was better at enticing people than her!

“We have met again. Have you figured out how you are going to beg me for mercy? I’m not cruel and evil. As long as you hand over the stuff and surrender Fanxue Mountain to Lin Kang, you may go anywhere you want,” Zhao Jing grinned at those opposite him.

They might not know who he was when they first met, but it was too late to undo their mistake now!

“I thought you were a strong Mage who relied on his own strength to rob other people of their belongings, but you are just a useless scum who’s good at conspiring. It doesn’t matter. I’m too na?ve to think everyone is willing to fight fair and square like myself!” retorted Mo Fan, shaking his head in disappointment.

Zhao Jing’s smile vanished.

The stronger and prouder a person was, the angrier they would feel when someone doubted their strength.

Zhao Jing had not managed to come so far by relying on the Zhao Clan’s wealth. He had mostly relied on his own talents and ambitions!

Even though Zhao Jing was not pleased with Mo Fan’s comment, he was not na?ve enough to point his finger at Mo Fan and yelled something stupid like?“Let’s have a duel, then! If I lose, I’ll call off the attack!”

He was a proud man, but his arrogance would not stop him from achieving his goals by any means needed!RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
