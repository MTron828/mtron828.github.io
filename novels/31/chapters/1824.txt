“Swamp of Darkness: Lost!”

Mo Fan’s other Elements were not too effective, but his Shadow Element was not restricted by the environment.

When the Manta Ray Evil Birds dove into the sea, Mo Fan immediately cast an Advanced Shadow Spell to spread the Swamp of Darkness, turning the water within the reach of it black!

The Swamp of Darkness also covered the area below the surface of the sea. The Manta Ray Evil Birds were struggling to find their way in the maze of darkness. They were more or less trapped in the water!

The Dark Material required some time for it to spread, but Mo Fan only had limited time. The Swamp of Darkness was not going to last for long. It would only provide the group with some temporary relief as they made their way toward the island!

“The cliff is just ahead, go!” Mo Fan yelled.

“Charge!” Zhao Manyan had suddenly become the captain, as the boat never needed anyone to take charge of the helm, since he was pushing the boat with a wave. However, if they abandoned the boat, not only did he have to keep everyone above the water, he had to send them to the island too!

“Giant Shadow Spikes!”

Mo Fan gave up on the urge to rely on his other Elements. He used the Intermediate Shadow Spell to impair the movements of the Manta Ray Evil Birds that were still in the sky.

“Why are you using the Giant Shadow Spikes? There’s no way you can hit them if they keep flying around at such a fast speed,” Zhao Manyan said when he saw Mo Fan tossing Giant Shadow Spikes into the sky.

The Giant Shadow Spikes were not fast, but they had strong restraining capabilities. However, sensitive creatures could easily dodge them. The Manta Ray Evil Birds were easily the most sensitive bird species out there. The Giant Shadow Spikes were not going to land on anything.

“Who told you that?” Mo Fan harrumphed.

The Giant Shadow Spikes flew into the sky. As Zhao Manyan thought, the Manta Ray Evil Birds easily dodged them. The Giant Shadow Spikes merely slowed down the Manta Ray Evil Birds by a little as they were diving from the sky. It did not stop them from attacking.

“You are not the only one with boomerangs!” Mo Fan grinned with glittering eyes when he saw the Manta Ray Evil Birds had lowered their guard.

The Manta Ray Evil Birds were about to dive when the Giant Shadow Spikes’ variation, the Thorns of the Shadow Rose, stabbed them in the back. The Manta Ray Evil Birds stiffened. They were paralyzed in the sky, regardless of how rapidly they beat their wings!

The rest of the Thorns of the Shadow Rose soon returned and struck the Manta Ray Evil Birds who were so proud of their flying ability. The creatures froze in the sky like impaled moths. It was quite an amusing sight!

“Holy crap, did you install an infrared homing system on your Giant Shadow Spikes? How did every single one land on target?” Zhao Manyan’s eyes widened.

A Shadow Mage could use Shadow Magic to conceal their spell, surprising their enemies by attacking with unexpected timing and angles, but it required outstanding control over the Shadow Magic and some unusual manipulative tricks.

Mo Fan had clearly fired off a high number of Thorns of the Shadow Rose. It was impossible for him to control every single one of them. It was unbelievable how he had landed them on the Manta Ray Evil Birds so precisely!

“I actually have a nickname, the Pleasure Seeker. My ‘bullets’ never miss!” Mo Fan laughed proudly, as if he had completely forgotten about the rest of the Manta Ray Evil Birds.

“You have only stopped about thirty of them. Stop being infatuated by yourself!” Jiang Shaoxu said angrily. She could not help but wonder if these two were actually so fearless, or they were just plain idiots. Why would they waste their time uttering nonsense at a time like this!?

Mo Fan lowered his eyes and saw the Swamp of Darkness gradually withdrawing. The smile on his face soon faded away.

He glanced at the cliff and roughly estimated the distance.

“Blink!” He had finally bought enough time that his Blink was available once again.

Zhao Manyan let out a relieved sigh when he saw Mo Fan using the Space Magic. They would be one step closer to the island after another Blink, and could finally shake off the annoying Manta Ray Evil Birds. He would no longer have to carry such a huge burden on his shoulders!

The space around them shuddered. Both Zhao Manyan and Jiang Shaoxu were already used to being offered a convenient ride. To their surprise, the silver light did not encapsulate them. When they opened their eyes again, they were shocked to see that Mo Fan had disappeared!

“F**k me, he f**king left on his own. That assh***!” Zhao Manyan lifted his gaze and saw Mo Fan moving over four hundred meters away. Not only did he not bring him and Jiang Shaoxu along, he even left Lingling whom he was supposed to look after behind.

“Mo Fan, do you want to die!?” Jiang Shaoxu yelled.

Mo Fan finally exposed the ugliest side of him after so many years. He had simply abandoned his teammates!

—

Meanwhile, Mo Fan was drowned in the strong wind and loud cries. He could not hear Jiang Shaoxu and Zhao Manyan’s curses.

Mo Fan was able to move four hundred meters away with Blink if he was not bringing anyone along. The cliff was within his reach.

Mo Fan immediately turned into a shadow sparrow before his feet touched the water. He sprang up the cliff and landed on the top of the coconut trees.

He turned around and saw Zhao Manyan and the others whom he had abandoned being flanked by a few hundred Manta Ray Evil Birds. The attacks did not only come from the sky, but from under the water too. The Manta Ray Evil Birds were enraged after the Swamp of Darkness had dispersed. They were going to eliminate the humans on the water once and for all!

“Electro Cannon!”

Mo Fan began to emit a completely different aura as he finally set foot on solid ground. He was able to cast his Lightning Spell freely since the Manta Ray Evil Birds were putting all their attention on Zhao Manyan! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The lightning coiled around Mo Fan’s arms as it was compressed. When Mo Fan shoved his hands forward, a lightning beam flew under the night sky toward the sea!

A blinding light shone over the sea, revealing countless shadows of Manta Ray Evil Birds scattered across the sea. It was horrifying just to see their numbers!

The Manta Ray Evil Birds were rising to the surface to ambush Zhao Manyan and the others. They were only a few dozen meters away from their target, but the lightning beam entered the water and triggered a terrifying explosion. The lightning arcs illuminated the silhouettes of the Manta Ray Evil Birds before the overwhelming force crushed them into dust!
