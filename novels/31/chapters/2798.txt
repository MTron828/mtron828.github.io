Chapter 2799: Termite Guard

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Black Dragon King Ants continued to fall and formed huge mountains. When Commander Hua’s powerful Heavenly Light Crossbow penetrated the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother’s abdomen, a scorching hole appeared.

Dark blood gushed out of the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother’s wound. Mo Fan thought Commander Hua’s single blow had wounded it very badly. But to his horror, he saw thatthe Black Dragon King Ants sucked its blood frantically and closed up the wound. The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother grew even larger and stronger than before.

The mountains made up of Black Dragon Ant Kings surrounded the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother and formed its body, claws and skull. The fortress made of ants collapsed and transformed into a golden-black enormous Ant King Beast. It then began to move and trample everything in its path.

The golden-black enormous Ant King Beast charged at Commander Hua. Its outer shell was harder than iron and steel. It transformed into a war machine. Its enormous body made it look like a moving fortress. It could also move swiftly and ferociously like a beast!

The island collapsed. Huge cracks appeared on the ground. The lava began to erupt. The island continued to explode and shatter in pieces. Soon, it would completely drown.

The destructive was from the Emperor-level Ocean Demon. Its destructive power was measured not by the number of people it could kill, but by how much of the land it could drown.

Commander Hua did not glow in a very bright light. The Great Forbidden Mage was different from what one assumed him to be. Judging from the Forbidden Curse he had cast, most people would assume him to glow bright like a blazing sun.

However, he floated in mid-air. He looked calm and collected while radiating a murderous intent. Mo Fan saw his posture and movement from afar. Commander Hua looked as tiny as a grain of sand in front of the golden-black Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother. However, when he raised his hands and cast the Forbidden Curse, his dim figure seemed to have broken through the shackles of this world.

…

“Is it burning?” asked Mo Fan. He sensed something.

“Void White Flame. That’s one of Commander Hua’s strongest skills.” Pang Lai explained to Mo Fan.

But the flame was not visible to the naked eyes.

Commander Hua cast Void White Flame. The golden-black Dragon King Ants were burning. The mountains made up of Dragon King Ants suffered a devastating blow. However, Mo Fan could not see anything.

......

The Void White Flame continued to burn the Ant King Beast. Suddenly, Commander Hua vanished from his place. The next moment, Mo Fan noticed a white light in the middle of the Black Dragon Ants.

The light was not very bright. But the Black Dragon King Ants could not cover even that amount of glow.

Mo Fan saw the magical glow from afar. But he could not quite determine what magical power they were.Commander Hua was killing the Mirage Dragon Ant King Mother.

When Mo Fan and Song Feiyao first arrived at Hawaii, they had assumed that the reason the mountains at Hawaii grew was due to the earth plane extrusion. That was partly true.

But mostly it was because Hawaii was filled with the Black Dragon King Ants. They hid within the rocks, mountains, surface of the land, and underneath the ground. They had lifted the island with their sheer number.

When the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother appeared, the earth shook violently and cracked because the Black Dragon King Ants broke through the ground. The rest of the islands sank while the mountains grew rapidly because the Black Dragon King Ants were piling up!

Commander Hua was aware that he could not possibly kill all the Dragon King Ants. But he had to stop them from gathering together on a large scale to prevent them from destroying humans by the coast. The only way was to kill the aggressive Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother!

The Dragon King Ants would never vanish. Even if he killed the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother, the ants would reproduce rapidly and give birth to another Ant Mother again…

But it would stall for time and allow the humans to fortify their defenses. Maybe they could even come up with more powerful mages to fight for them.

Commander Hua killed the Dragon King Ants before him with his Void White Flame. However, there were many other hills made up of Dragon King Ants but at least they were severely wounded. The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother had lost a great number of ‘personal guards’. In the previous battle, Commander Hua had lost many of his subordinates before they successfully killed all the ‘termite guards’. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Termite Guards served as the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother’s life-preserving charm. They were a part of the Dragon King Ants species that were difficult to reproduce quickly. But they served as a protective layer for the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother.

…

Even though Commander Hua was wounded, he insisted on killing the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother because if the Termite Guard returned and surrounded it, it would be impossible to subdue!

Mo Fan, the Royal Mages, and the rest of the rescue team had played crucial roles in this mission. If the Eight-headed Serpent, Stingray King, Sword Fish Chief, and Deep-sea Dragon Lizard Demons had found Commander Hua first, he would have been too exhausted to fight. The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother would have taken advantage of his exhaustion and killed him.

The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother could not hold back its killing instinct despite being severely wounded. While, Commander Hua was entirely confident of killing it.

Without its Termite Guard, the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother would undoubtedly be killed this time!

…

The black mountains grew higher. They moved in a disturbing manner. Yet Commander Hua had no intention of retreating.

The mountains made up of seemingly endless Black Dragon King Ants had devoured half of the island. Killing it required more than just courage. But Mo Fan could do nothing to help.

If the Black Dragon King Ants attacked the Black Totem Snake, there would not be any remains of the Black Totem Snake, not even its bones.

This was another epic battle. Mo Fan did not know about the previous battle. All he knew was he had been involved in itby accident.

Mo Fan seldom prayed to God. However, this time, he instinctively closed his eyes…
