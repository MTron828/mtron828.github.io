The sacred mountain flattened at its foot. Normally, the petals of the Flying Flowers would be scattered across the place. However, apart from the petals that were destroyed by the overwhelming energy, all that was left was the residue of the spells on the streets and the roofs.

The people in the Citadel of Athens were terrified when they saw the Dark Execution Ground, but what scared them the most was seeing people dying on the sacred mountain. They might not be aware of the complicated reasons behind the battle that was taking place there, but they knew it had been a long time since the Parthenon Temple was involved in such a tragedy.

Cold rain was still pouring down from the gray clouds looming over the Citadel of Athens. The sky was dark and cloudy, and between a few ancient buildings, a shadowy figure shrouded by an evil aura landed on the ground. Its eerily glowing eyes were staring at the spacious Dark Execution Ground.

A lightning halberd descended from the stormy clouds without a sound. It drove right into the ground between the buildings, as tall as the structures around it!

Lightning arcs burst out of it and sprang right at Mo Fan with a strong sealing force!

Demon Mo Fan reacted swiftly. He jumped onto a building and turned around. He saw a Mage in a golden robe standing opposite him. His face was covered by a mask. Mo Fan was unable to see his face, but he could tell how strong the man was from his powerful aura!

“I don’t care what you are, anything that comes any closer will die!” the Holy Court Mage stated coldly.

The fact that the Holy Court Mage could detect Mo Fan’s presence and sneak up on him easily proved that he was one of the strongest among the Holy Court Mages.

“You already knew the judgment was part of a great conspiracy, and yet you Holy Court Mages are still willing to obey Dulanc’s order?” Demon Mo Fan stared at the Holy Court Mage and demanded hoarsely.

The Holy Court Mage did not respond. It was quite obvious that he was on Dulanc’s side. Wild lightning burst out of his body once again as another lightning halberd fell from the sky and landed close to Mo Fan.

More lightning halberds began to fall soon after, twelve of them in total. The lightning halberds formed a magic formation with deadly lightning arcs moving between them.

The Holy Court Mage stood outside the magic formation and stared at Demon Mo Fan trapped inside it.

The Lightning Element was known for its incredible damage, but after reaching the Super Level, the Lightning Spell was very effective at trapping a target instead. The Holy Court Mage believed the magic formation was enough to trap the demon for some time.

The Holy Court Mage was just about to report back to Great Magistrate Dulanc when his vision blurred all of a sudden. The man with crimson-red eyes eerily blinked out of the magic formation and was now only half a meter away from him.

The Holy Court Mage immediately broke out in cold sweat. He did not think his target would be able to break out of the magic formation so easily, and he could already smell death from such a close distance!

Outside the Dark Execution Ground, Dulanc was still looking at the Soul of the Parthenon Temple greedily. He even wished that he could turn into Hayla, the Envoy of the Realm of the Dead, and end the girl’s life with his own hands. It would quicken the process of releasing the Soul of the Parthenon Temple from that lowly woman and giving it to the real Goddess.

In the past, he always enjoyed watching Hayla climbing out from the Realm of the Dead slowly and tearing the arrogant people that opposed him to pieces. However, he was not in the mood today. He wanted to get it done as quickly as possible and get rid of the voices that were rebelling against him, and get the situation back under control.

A man wearing the armor of a Holy Court Mage fell from the sky and slammed heavily onto the ground beside Dulanc.

The Holy Court Mage responsible for Dulanc’s safety yelled out in surprise and quickly stepped forward to protect Dulanc.

The man that fell from the sky was still sliding across the ground. He finally came to a stop after smashing through a few walls. Another Holy Court Mage quickly went up to take a look, before returning with a twisted expression.

“It’s Sisso! I think... I think he’s dead!” the Holy Court Mage called out.

Sisso was an elite among the Holy Court Mages. He had been asked to guard the perimeter of the Dark Execution Ground. They saw his Lightning Spell descend not long ago. They initially thought he would take out the enemy quite easily, but to their surprise, he was the one that died! The rest of the Holy Court Mages felt uneasy.

“That thing is coming, Great Magistrate!” a blue-haired Holy Court Mage exclaimed. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Why are you panicking? Set up the defense!” Great Magistrate Dulanc harrumphed coldly.

“Dulanc, watch out, he’s very strong!” the injured Shawshank said.

Shawshank had been knocked down the mountain by Mo Fan. He had decided to stick close to Dulanc instead, as the Golden Sun Knights and the Adjudicators were weaker than the Holy Court Mages. He was hoping that Dulanc could take out the demon.

However, Shawshank immediately lost confidence when he learned that even Sisso, one of the strongest Holy Court Mages, had died too! He could not help but feel they had offended someone they could not afford to...

“The Barrier will stop him from getting any closer!” Dulanc said.

The barrier had the shape of an icy wall. It had covered the entire place and completely separated it from the space outside, preventing Mo Fan from entering the Dark Execution Ground.

The crystalline Barrier continued to grow thicker, like a glacier of blue ice.

—

The barrier was transparent. Demon Mo Fan walked up to the Barrier and stared at the people hiding inside.

Dulanc was inspecting Mo Fan in return. He was rather surprised. Wasn’t he the young man that was trying to rescue Xinxia? How did he leave Vice Hall Leader Shawshank with such serious injuries and even kill his trustworthy man, Sisso?

Demonic flames gradually burst out of Mo Fan’s body and engulfed the Wolf Soul Shadow behind him...

The flames attached to Mo Fan’s back formed the outline of the Flame Belle Empress. The previous evil aura had disappeared, replaced by the pure, destructive aura of fire currently enveloping Mo Fan!

Mo Fan’s appearance of a Wolf Demon had transformed into a blazing figure. The stunning outline of the Flame Belle Empress astonished the Holy Court Mages!

A Fire Demon!

Mo Fan’s power shifted tremendously when the shadow behind him changed. He raised his fist and slammed it heavily onto the Barrier of crystalline ice!

A giant fiery dragon sprang out of Mo Fan’s fist and slammed into the Barrier.

The Barrier began to crack rapidly under the overwhelming force of the flames. The cracks spread further, and soon covered half the barrier.

Dulanc, who was initially wearing a smug expression, immediately paled when he saw the damage dealt to the Barrier.

-That’s impossible!A single punch!-

The guy had broken his Barrier with a single punch!

The wild flames surged fiercely and filled up the space. The broken pieces of the Barrier melted within the blink of an eye.

Mo Fan stepped forward. The flames spread across the ground, following his steps, setting the place on fire. The terrifying flames did not burn everything into ashes. They were like a bunch of servants under the control of their master. They had temporarily occupied the territory, and would not move before receiving a command from their master!

The flames surrounded Dulanc, Shawshank, and the three Holy Court Mages...

“What exactly are you!?” Dulanc’s voice began to tremble when he saw Mo Fan coming closer.

As an authority, Dulanc was a powerful Mage too, yet unlike Pang Lai and Song Qiming who were able to climb to their positions with their outstanding strength, Dulanc had climbed to his current position with political tricks. He was not any stronger than Sisso, who had just died, and was weaker than Shawshank, too.

The strongest force in the Parthenon Temple was the Hall of Knights, especially the few Hall Masters that included Haylon. However, Haylon had started to withdraw the Golden Sun Knights and the Silver Moon Knights after realizing something.

“Protect the Great Magistrate!” Shawshank was still injured. He already knew it would come down to this when he realized the demon was just as strong as the Black Totem Snake. They needed an entire army of Mages to have a chance to take him on. Even Mellaura had died to him!

Shawshank did not want to die. As soon as he gave the order to protect the Great Magistrate, he fled in the opposite direction instead, leaving the Holy Court Mages to protect the Great Magistrate!

Mo Fan did not intend to let the ambitious man go. His gaze followed Shawshank. A fiery pillar burst out of the ground in the direction that Shawshank was running, intercepting him!

Shawshank was astounded. He used all his might to move a few hundred meters away when he felt the danger approaching. However, as soon as he came to a street surrounded by buildings, he saw the buildings erupting in flames and turning into a fiery ocean. The flames pounced on him fiercely!

The fire grew stronger quickly. Shawshank struggled in the flames. The three Holy Court Mages were overwhelmed by fear when they saw Mo Fan Summon such a powerful fire with just a simple glance!

Mo Fan glanced at the three Holy Court Mages and said mockingly, “If you run now, I will spare your life.”

The youngest Holy Court Mage among them turned around instantly and fled. Dulanc’s face contorted when he saw one of his trusted men abandon him so quickly.
