1320 Nine Palace: Fiery Serpent Dragons

Translated by XephiZ

The meteorite descended from the sky and exploded between Pan Xi, Li Hongmei, and Nanrong Xi. The flames sprang forward and instantly knocked them flying.

A scorching heat swept at them. The three immediately activated their defensive Equipment and could barely resist the overwhelming heat!

A human figure gradually appeared from the flames. He was engulfed in two different kinds of flames. One was bright red like the sky when the sun was setting, the other was dark brown with a deadly aura!

Previously, the aura of the Calamity Fire was a little weaker than the Ardent Sunset. However, once Little Flame Belle successfully reached the Adolescent Phase, she was able to grant Mo Fan a stronger and purer Calamity Fire that originated from the North Burning Valley!

The brilliance of the two flames set off Mo Fan’s burning appearance. The others felt like suffocating when faced with the overwhelming aura of the flames!

“You piece of shit, I’ll do you a favor so you can be reincarnated if you’re so tired of living already!” Mo Fan was utterly enraged. The flames kept spreading into his surroundings like waves.

He glared at the foursome of Pan Xi, Nanrong Xi, Li Hongmei, and Nanrong Ni. They subconsciously took a few steps back after seeing his burning eyes.

“What the heck is this thing!?” Li Hongmei exclaimed, looking at Mo Fan. She was trying her best to remain calm.

“It’s Mo Fan! Don’t worry, he is no match for you all,” Nanrong Ni naturally recognized Mo Fan right away.

Mo Fan was able to abuse the special ability to engulf himself in flames after being possessed by his Elemental Creature to come in first in the World College Tournament. However, he still stood no chance against powerful Mages of renowned clans like Pan Xi, Nanrong Xi, and Li Hongmei. They were easily some of the strongest Mages of the Advanced Level!

“Humph, I was wondering who it was. It’s the kid who was able to make a name for himself with mere luck!” Li Hongmei did not treat Mo Fan too seriously.

In terms of cultivation, the three of them were clearly a lot stronger than a kid who was only in his twenties. Being the strongest in the World College Tournament did not make Mo Fan unbeatable. He was only deemed the strongest among the younger generation, but they were mentors of the younger generations!

“I’ll take him on!” Li Hongmei said, signaling the other two to take care of Mu Ningxue as quickly as possible.

A huge crowd had gathered along the shore. Even though they had colluded with Lin Ze of the Donghai Magic Association to take care of the press, it was impossible to hide the truth if they kept attracting such attention!

Li Hongmei had summoned a few boulders and set them up like stairs. As she walked up the stairs, she gathered more rocks to form a circle around Mo Fan. The rocks gradually shrank inward.

The rocks were spinning quicker as their momentum increased. They kept following Mo Fan regardless of the direction he was moving in. It greatly restricted his movements.

“Stop trying to seek the limelight, your luck won’t always be good throughout your life,” Li Hongmei mocked sharply.

“An old woman like you shouldn’t be seeking publicity here either! Your saggy tits have already reached the fat on your stomach. It’s disgusting to look at!” Mo Fan cursed her back.

Li Hongmei felt herself burning after hearing the words. How was she even close to being an old woman? Many people kept saying that she looked like she was only in her thirties. She almost lost her mind, especially when she heard the second half of the retort!

“I’m going to rip your mouth off!” Li Hongmei screeched at him.

Li Hongmei was about to apply pressure to Mo Fan with her presence, but the space before her trembled suddenly. She reacted as soon as she saw the silver flash of Space Magic. It was Blink, the Advanced Spell of the Space Element!

She quickly backed away. As she thought, the flaming Mo Fan suddenly showed up at the spot she was in previously. His burning aura even blossomed like a fiery lotus and swept forward in the air.

“Such a petty little trick...” Li Hongmei sneered.

Suddenly, a huge burning fist appeared right in front of Li Hongmei. The fist continued to grow, reaching a size that Li Hongmei had no chance of dodging it. It felt like a giant burning mountain was flying at her!

Li Hongmei quickly stacked up layers of rocks in front of her to defend her, yet the fist shattered them to pieces.

The burning fist rammed through every layer of defense that Li Hongmei set up. She finally realized that the young man was not as simple as they had all imagined!

Li Hongmei spat out a mouthful of blood as she was devoured by the flames. She went flying for quite a distance before slamming into the ocean.

Even the water of the ocean was unable to put out Mo Fan’s flames easily. The flames continued to burn Li Hongmei after she fell into the water, leaving her in intolerable pain!

Meanwhile, Nanrong Xi and Pan Xi had used their strongest moves to put an end to the battle as soon as possible. Mu Ningxue would have lost if it wasn’t for her outstanding strength.

Mo Fan glared at Pan Xi after he was done with Li Hongmei!

Mo Fan failed to show up when Mu Ningxue needed him the most at Venice, allowing Pan Xi to get his way. It almost destroyed the relationship that he had spent so much effort building with Mu Ningxue. Therefore, there was no way Mo Fan would let Pan Xi go this time!

“Piss off if you don’t want to die!” Mo Fan cast Blink and showed up in front of Nanrong Xi.

“Who do you even think you are? How dare you talk to me like that!?” Nanrong Xi had the typical demeanor of a member of royalty. His whole person was brimming with pride.

“You better remember who I am from today onward. I’m the one who’s going to beat you into a cripple!” Mo Fan unleashed his flames. The two Fire Domains spread across the place. The water below him started to boil from the heat he was emitting!

Nanrong Xi also had a Domain. Water was his Primary Element.

Since Water was effective against Fire, Nanrong Xi did not think Mo Fan was much of a threat. However, he was panicking as soon as Mo Fan unleashed his Domains.

The water was evaporating!

Mo Fan’s formidable Fire Magic had asserted dominance over the area. As a result, Nanrong Ni’s Water Spells were significantly weakened!

“Nine Palace: Fiery Serpent Dragons!”

The Fire Magic had reached its threshold. Mo Fan threw his fist into the air. Nine enormous serpent-like dragons sprang into the sky out of the boiling water. The moment they soared into the sky in the pattern of the Nine Palace, the island trembled from their power, while the ocean trembled. Both the aura and the strength of the spell were utterly shocking!
