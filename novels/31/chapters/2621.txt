Mo Fan turned around and saw a familiar face.

Dean Xiao!

‘The Space Element…

Mo Fan had only found out Dean Xiao was a Space Mage today, and Dean Xiao’s Space Element was even stronger than his!

However, Mo Fan did not expect Dean Xiao’s Space Element to be so strong that he could instantly kill a Top Seater with a dagger!

Exactly how strong is Dean Xiao?

“He’s not going to live. You may ask your Undead to stop attacking,” Dean Xiao said, his face cold.

Mo Fan had never seen an expression like that on Dean Xiao’s face. Even though he rarely smiled, the Dean was basically an easygoing person.

Ding Yumian did not expect Dean Xiao to be the one who killed the Councilman in the end. She was a little guilty to face Dean Xiao, or at least that was what her Soul of Kindness was feeling.

She had not expected things to turn out this way.

The green flames in the revenant’s eyes gradually dissipated. She surprisingly kept her promise by telling the Undead to stop. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

‘The Undead stopped crossing the river. They remained close to Ding Yumian, awaiting her order.

“Such a pity that he didn’t do it himself…” Ding Yumian looked at Councilman Zhuang.

She slowly glided closer to Councilman Zhuang and watched his blood as it poured across the ground.

Zhuang Yue was crawling toward the Healer behind him.

He still had a chance to live if the Healer treated his wound in time. After all, the Healer was a Super Mage. He could heal anyone that was still breathing!

Unfortunately, the Healer did not lend him a hand.

No one was feeling sorry for Zhuang Yue. Not only did he fail to resolve the danger the city was facing, he had even murdered an innocent student of the Pearl Institute.

A aacrifice could only be made if the person volunteered. Forcing someone to sacrifice themselves was no different from murdering them!

“Tl tell the others that you willingly sacrificed yourself to settle the dispute,” the Healer said cynically.

Zhuang Yue’s body spasmed after hearing the words. He did not want to be remembered as a hero. He wanted to live!

In the end, Zhuang Yue died from excessive blood loss. Ding Yumian smiled in satisfaction.

“aren’t you going with me? If you don’t, I won’t mind letting the Undead stay here a little longer,” the revenant said to the kind spirit.

The spirit nodded after taking one final look at the city she loved.

Amoment later, she flew toward the revenant and became one with her.

The revenant seemed pleased to obtain the other half of her soul, as if she had waited a long time for it.

She was finally whole, a complete Disaster-bringer! A girl who had regained her extraordinary talent for bringing death to the world!

Not only would she be able to control every Undead in the sea, she could also turn living creatures into Undead!

She might even turn the whole world into Undead.

She was the real Goddess of Death!

Ding Yumian suddenly looked pained, as if something was stuck in her throat. She grabbed her neck like she was trying to cough something out.

“You!” Ding Yumian pointed at Dean Xiao. Her eyes turned vicious and angry.

She pounced at Dean Xiao. Her pale hands suddenly grew extremely long.

Dean Xiao backed away nimbly. He did not want to fight Ding Yumian.

Ding Yumian tried to chase after him, but she had already curled up on the ground, as if something was breaking out of her body.

Meanwhile, the nearby Undead started shrieking. They were tearing at their own bodies with their claws, starting to dismember themselves!

The presence of death spread rapidly. It was like watching fiends in Hell being tortured.

“You…you tricked me. You tricked me!” the revenant cried out in pain. Her face was replaced by the face of the Trench Demon. Her voice was piercing.

“Dean Xia

.” Mo Fan was confused. He had no idea what was happening.

“We asked Professor Luo to modify Ding Yumian’s Soul of Kindness and turn her into a double-edged sword,” Dean Xiao informed him.

Mo Fan was in shock.

That explained why the revenant acted like she had just eaten something poisonous after merging with the Soul of Kindness.

Mo Fan realized Dean Xiao had never planned to settle the dispute peacefully. He was planning to kill the revenant all along!

He was neither biased nor compassionate. Dean Xiao had killed Zhuang Yue so the revenant would feel guilty in front of him. After all, Zhuang Yue was surely going to die in the end, but the person who did it would have to take the blame.

However, Dean Xiao had executed Ding Yumian right after he had killed Zhuang Yue!

He had used the Soul of Kindness which she would not suspect to kill her!

Both Zhuang Yue and Ding Yumian were dead. For a moment, Mo Fan wondered who was right, and who was wrong.

However, the moment Dean Xiao executed them both, Mo Fan understood what had to be done, instead of being surprised by Dean Xiao’s cold-bloodedness.

Dean Xiao was only protecting the city and the Pearl Institute in his way.

Zhuang Yue’s death would stop the Undead from attacking the city. Ding Yumian’s death would prevent the Undead from returning again!

Every Undead that Ding Yumian had brought back to life died with her. The whole area was filled with black gas and shiny black liquid.

The gas rose into the air and dissipated into the clouds, while the liquid flowed into the drains and returned to the sea.

Perhaps Dean Xiao was strong enough to kill the revenant, but he had no chance of defeating the army of Undead. His only choice was to use the Soul of Kindness to make sure the Undead would perish with Ding Yumian.

Mo Fan watched the horrible sight fading away, as if he had just woken up from a nightmare. He eventually looked at Ding Yumian’s pale corpse. She was truly dead now. Her soul was gone, leaving only a cold body behind.

Perhaps the Soul of Kindness’ final decision was the real sacrifice, without any regrets!

“Take her body back with us,” Dean Xiao told the teacher with white brows.

“What are we going to tell the students?” the teacher asked, stooping to do so.

“The truth!” Dean Xiao replied simply.

Some people might respect her, while others would despise her, but the truth would remain!
