Chapter 2460: I Like It More!

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Zhang Xiaohou stared at the face on the tentacle.

The colors around him suddenly disappeared, as if someone was using a giant eraser to rub away the colors. It felt strange and unreal.

The tentacles surrounding Zhang Xiaohou soon returned to the monster.

The monster’s face kept switching. Yang Xiajie’s face even appeared several more times.

The monster started fighting itself. The tentacles were tearing one another apart, and green blood was spraying everywhere.

Zhang Xiaohou’s eyes glittered. He was confirming whether he was still stuck in an illusion.

A demon creature that was good at fooling one’s mind would purposely create a surreal illusion to trick their prey into believing they were freed from the first illusion. It was like waking up from a dream, but in reality, they were still in the middle of a dream.

Zhang Xiaohou was not a weak Mage who could be tricked easily. He had his own way to identify whether he was in an illusion.

It was real! Everything he saw was real!

The monster had indeed devoured Yang Xiajie’s soul and memory. It was trying to understand human constitutions, plans, and abilities, but the owners of the souls and memories would fight back during the process.

As a result, Yang Xiajie kept interfering with the monster’s actions. He even sent a signal back to Zhang Xiaohou while he was in control.

Zhang Xiaohou knew Yang Xiajie’s body was already torn into pieces. The remnants of his soul were fighting back, but he was not going to last for long.

Yang Xiajie would soon be converted. However, he was still fighting with the last parts of his soul.

Zhang Xiaohou saluted Yang Xiajie. He rushed into the silver vein with the limited time Yang Xiajie had bought him.

What was the monster hiding in the silver vein? He was told not to underestimate the sea monsters’ intelligence. What were they up to?

The camp at the bottom of the sea…

Countless Wild Lightning Gulpers had formed a deadly lightning web outside the barrier, surrounding the camp.

“There are too many of them. We can’t hold on for much longer!”

“Call them back. We have to retreat to the surface…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’m calling the dragon beasts. We have to go now!”

The scales of the Wild Lightning Gulpers were releasing strong arcs of lightning. When their entire bodies were flickering, they would fire a lightning bolt strong enough to penetrate rocks.

They had come from the forest of seaweed above the camp. Hua Yuezhu had asked Old Jia to increase the range of the signals by a dozen kilometers to look for Zhang Xiaohou.

Unfortunately, not only did they fail to locate Zhang Xiaohou, they ended up attracting the sea monsters for dozens of kilometers around the camp.

“Triumphant Eagle Dragons!”

The group cleared a path to the surface. The Triumphant Eagle Dragons flew close to the water and snatched everyone into the sky!

The Triumphant Eagle Horses quickly soared into the sky. Several seconds later, a terrifying thunderstorm burst out of the sea and created a huge wave several hundred meters high. It almost swallowed the soldiers and dragged them back into the water.

“The General’s Flying Dragon…”

The rest of the Triumphant Eagle Horses had regrouped with them.

The imperious Flying Dragon also flew toward them, but it did not stay for long. It beat its wings and flew into the distance!

“Is…is it leaving the Bohai Sea?”

“It’s heading toward the Pacific Ocean!”

“Does that mean the General is really dead, which sets the Flying Dragon free?”

The soldiers circled in the sky with grim looks on their faces.

Tan Feng and the others were initially waiting at the bottom of the sea, but Zhang Xiaohou’s life signal was lost not long afterwards.

Tan Feng immediately asked the people in the camp to expand their search range, but they still failed to locate Zhang Xiaohou’s signal after increasing the range of the search by several dozen kilometers.

The Cold Ray Ruler appeared just as Tan Feng and the others were about to go after Zhang Xiaohou. They had almost died in the trench.

The camp Hua Yuezhu was guarding was also attacked by the sea monsters from the seaweed forest after the strong signals attracted them there. They regrouped with Tan Feng and the others and were forced to retreat.

“We have to ask for backup. We must find the General dead or alive!” Hua Yuezhu shouted.

“The Flying Dragon has been set free. I’m afraid it proves that…”

“What does it prove? It’s just an animal that has betrayed its master!” Tan Feng snarled. “Remember, we can retreat temporarily, but we can’t give up on our men!”

On a stranded island surrounded by reefs, a man whose skin was swollen after soaking in water for too long was lying on a rock. Half of his body was still in the water, but he was too tired to move.

He crawled with all his might and rolled over to move out of the water.

—

The sun rose and fell. The man’s body had already dried out under the sun.

A strong wind suddenly came from above. Zhang Xiaohou opened his eyes and saw a huge pair of wings blocking the sunlight. The figure slowly landed beside him.

The little island did not have enough space for the creature. Zhang Xiaohou put on an ugly smile when he saw the creature.

“Are you so fond of me, even though we have only spent a few days together?” Zhang Xiaohou had to ask.

The Flying Dragon opened its mouth and dripped some of its saliva onto Zhang Xiaohou. His wounds began to heal slowly.

“How long did it take you to find me?” Zhang Xiaohou asked it.

The Flying Dragon scratched two lines on the rock.

“Two days? And you didn’t rest throughout the journey?” Zhang Xiaohou asked in surprise.

Considering the Flying Dragon’s endurance and speed, it would have no trouble flying a circle around the world’s equator if it flew for two days without taking any rest.

“Can you bring me to a nearby city as soon as possible?”

The Flying Dragon lowered its head so Zhang Xiaohou could climb onto it.

After Zhang Xiaohou sat properly on the Flying Dragon, it spread its wings and headed east swiftly.

Zhang Xiaohou could only smile wryly when he realized Hawaii was the closest city!

It was out in the middle of the Pacific. He had somehow ended up in the center of the Pacific Ocean!

It was roughly nine thousand kilometers from the Bohai Sea to the center of the Pacific Ocean!

Zhang Xiaohou would never have believed it if he had not experienced them in person. The things that Yang Xiajie had told him were absolutely ridiculous.

——

Zhang Xiaohou found a telephone booth.

Zhang Xiaohou had no time to treat his wounds, nor did he have time to organize his thoughts. He could only think of one person under the circumstances.

The call was picked up.

Zhang Xiaohou took a deep breath.

“Brother Fan.”

“Are you still alive?”

“Barely,” Zhang Xiaohou wore a wry smile and said, “Brother Fan, I need your help.”

“Say it.”

“It might be a little crazy,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“I like the sound of that,” Mo Fan said.

“In three days, our military will cast an Ice Forbidden Curse on the Bohai Sea to eliminate a huge threat, but we have to interrupt the Induction and stop the Forbidden Curse!” Even Zhang Xiaohou could not believe what he was saying.

The other end fell silent. Zhang Xiaohou knew how ridiculous he sounded. He also knew no one else could help him.

“I like the sound of that even more!,” the man on the other end finally said!
