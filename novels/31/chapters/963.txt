On the deck, Casso who was wearing a huge coat stood close to the rails. He burst out laughing when he saw the government army fighting the people that had come to take them out.

“HAHAHA, look at them, just look at them... they started fighting one another instead, HAHAHA!” Casso laughed wildly.

The other members of the Red Ornaments Guild were laughing too. Years ago, they were on the run like rats in the street, hiding from the government army, Hunters, and the Sacred Hall of Liberty. But now, they were drinking stouts on the deck of a boat, watching the government army like they were putting up a show.

“Boss, the sea monsters that attack the White Head City every season are pretty strong, are we seriously going to fight them?” a fatty with a huge belly asked.

“Fight the sea monsters? Not a chance! We’ll leave once we plunder enough money from this city. Does that stupid Lauren seriously think I care about being a general? With money, we can go to a better place. We can build a city, a kingdom, a place where even the assholes of the Sacred Hall of Liberty won’t dare to come!” Casso burst out laughing.

“Boss, that’s brilliant!”

“All hail the boss!”

The shipyard...

“Stop them, stop them at once!” yelled Lauren furiously.

A huge squad of Magicians caught up to Mo Fan and his crew, but as soon as they were about to cast spells to entrap the three, a tiger-like beast with metal plates suddenly appeared.

They had no idea whose Contracted Beast the beast was. It simply charged at the soldiers and rammed anyone it came close to. The formation of the soldiers collapsed instantly, and the soldiers were having trouble using magic.

Mo Fan, Jiang Shaoxu, Zhao Manyan, and Night Rakshasa took hold of the chance to proceed to the White Head Harbor, leaving the soldiers behind.

Either the others had overwhelming firepower, or some of the captains among the soldiers were not trying very hard to stop them, because the soldiers stopped chasing them after they reached White Head Harbor.

—

As they arrived at the White Head Harbor, the Swift Star Wolf appeared out of nowhere. A woman was lying on his back. It was Oni, whom they had held hostage.

Mo Fan had sealed off Oni’s movements. Her mind was also suppressed by Jiang Shaoxu’s spell. She looked worse than an ordinary young girl.

As they approached the boat, Mo Fan glanced at the dimly-lit deck.

He knew there were people on the deck, and quite a large group too, but Mo Fan was not afraid. He carried Oni on his shoulder and yelled at the deck.

“Isn’t that Oni!”

“My God, they caught Oni!”

A few heads poked out from the deck. They immediately recognized Oni in his grip.

Oni was an Advanced Magician. Even though she was relatively weak among the Advanced Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild, she did have a certain status in the organization. Besides, she was a fairly good-looking woman among the bandits, who were mostly men. Many of the members were her die-hard fans.

When the Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild saw Oni was caught, they immediately went enraged.

“Casso, save me!” Oni screamed at the deck.

A bulky silhouette in a huge coat appeared on the deck. His sharp eyes slowly moved into the light and glanced down at them coldly.

Zhao Manyan and Jiang Shaoxu’s hearts skipped a beat. It seemed like the cultivation of the man on the deck was a lot stronger than theirs. Otherwise, why were they feeling such great pressure from him?

“Kid, let her go, and I won’t be fussy about what you’ve done. I can also promise you that my men won’t trouble you anymore.” It was obvious that Casso cared a lot about Oni when he personally asked Mo Fan to let her go.

“Your men won’t trouble me, since none of you are going to leave this place alive today!” Mo Fan was completely fearless.

“That’s some high-sounding statement, my Red Ornaments Guild...”

“AHHH!!!”

Casso had yet to finish his sentence when Mo Fan suddenly used the Space Element to snap Oni’s neck right in front of the members of the Red Ornaments Guild!

Oni was not prepared to die. She initially thought Mo Fan was trying to negotiate with Casso. Even her last scream was incredibly brief, filled with a hint of disbelief.

Oni’s eyes showed their whites as her head fell sideways. It looked like her neck was going to fall to the ground at any second.

Casso almost vomited blood in the midst of his sentence.

Such arrogance! As the president of the Red Ornaments Guild, he was used to having people fear and respect him. Only he was allowed to display his arrogance, but to his surprise, this young Magician dared to snap his trusted subordinate’s neck before he even finished his sentence!

“I’m not in the mood to listen to your bullshit. Come down here, I’ll beat you into minced meat!” Mo Fan tossed Oni into the sea. “Feel free to fish up her corpse!”

“Mo Fan... didn’t you say she might come in handy? Is that seriously what you meant?” Zhao Manyan could not help but murmur.

It was incredibly cruel. Zhao Manyan had to admit that he was unable to force himself to kill a good-looking woman, despite the crimes she had committed and the number of people she had killed.

But Mo Fan was different. As soon as she was on bad terms with him... no no, she did not even say a word, but Mo Fan decided to snap her neck out of nowhere. He only kept her alive to demonstrate his resolve to the bandits of the Red Ornaments Guild!

How insane!

“I’m going to snap your neck too!” Casso was infuriated. He uttered a roar and jumped down from the deck.

Soon, lots of red figures had jumped down from the boat. They were all wearing red outfits and ornaments. They did not look like devils and monsters, but their murderous aura was enough to mess up the sea breezes!

“Damn it, they have taken the lead! Let’s engage!” Akira Matsuki and Shou Watani of the Japanese team had shown up.

The mature woman of the Indian team arrived with a few other members, too. They went straight for the boat, and immediately attacked the members of the Red Ornaments Guild.

The people of the Red Ornaments Guild started fighting against the Indian and Japanese teams before Mo Fan and Casso started their fight. Elemental energy and ripples surged across the place, turning the whole place messy.

“He’s all yours. I’ll handle that one over there!” Zhao Manyan could easily tell from Casso’s aura that he was not a Magician who had reached the Advanced Level recently.

Zhao Manyan soon found his worthy opponent, a skinny woman in a red mink coat. The woman did not have a strong aura. She was most likely an easy target.

“He’s just a little shrimp, boss, you don’t need to do it yourself! I’ll break every bone in his body for you,” said the fatty with a huge belly.

“Take out that woman, she’s a Psychic Magician!” Casso scanned the place and immediately identified Jiang Shaoxu’s Element.

“A Psychic Magician... oh, alright, I’ll communicate with her then,” the fatty grinned wickedly and looked at Jiang Shaoxu pervertedly.

“Boss, we’ll test his strength first!” A few Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild trying to fawn over their president stepped forward, trying to flank Mo Fan.

To their surprise, before they could make their move, a small black creature lunged at them, swiping its black claws around. One of the Magicians were shredded instantly.

Casso frowned and laughed hollowly, “It looks like you do have a trick or two up in your sleeves, but you’ve seriously infuriated me today. I will bury you all together!”

Casso decided to join the battle. His target was none other the Mo Fan who had stepped on his toes.

Since Mo Fan was able to defeat Oni, it clearly implied how strong he was. His men were already in a messy fight against the others. Casso did not plan to waste his time further. He had to take out the smug kid and proceed to kill the rest of them!

“Eyes of the Rock Demon: Muslin of the Sky!”

Casso finished his Star Constellation quicker than Mo Fan had imagined. His sharp eyes emitted an intimidating brown light, summoning orange-yellow sand particles from his surroundings.

The sand particles might look tiny, but when they stacked together, they were able to turn into any kind of weapon, similar to the spell Plummeting Rays.

The sand particles rapidly approached Mo Fan and started spinning. When the tiny sand particles were spinning at incredible speeds, they were as dangerous as a blade. The stone boulder behind Mo Fan was instantly shattered into pieces.

“Sky Muslin Strangle!”

Casso controlled the killing sand with his Eyes of the Rock Demon. The sand was spinning fiercely now.

When Mo Fan was surrounded by the sky muslin, he swiftly sank into his shadow. It quickly split into four and fled in different directions.

The abilities of Mo Fan’s Shadow Element had improved significantly when he was Awakening his Stars. Mo Fan’s shadow could now split into four when he cast Fleeing Shadow, similar to Councilman Luo Mian’s Shadow Element in the past.

Casso had trouble distinguishing between the shadows. He had no choice but to split the killing sand into four parts and chase after the shadows.

The Sky Muslin’s strength was dependent on the number of sand particles, and was greatly weakened after splitting into four. Mo Fan let out a roar when he rose up from the shadow, using his will to shatter the killing sand circling him.

“Petrify!”

Casso was able to cast different spells adeptly. As his brown eyes flickered, the plank that he was standing on was soon dyed gray, like a layer of hard concrete. It rapidly spread a hundred meters away from the plank!

“Conduct Lightning!”

A bolt of purple-black lightning burst out of Mo Fan’s body as he transformed into a lightning bolt, dashing across the gray area and charging at Casso. He continued to release lightning into the air, forming a giant lightning web flying at Casso!
