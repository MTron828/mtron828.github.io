The enormous bird flew off into the distance. The airflow around them immediately returned to normal, allowing the plane to recover and stabilize itself.

As they went back into the cabin, the head steward, stewardesses, and the substitute pilot received them and said joyfully to Mr. Jia, “Well done, you managed to drive that terrifying demon creature away!”

As the plane was able to fly normally, the passengers gradually calmed down too. When they learned the Magician had saved everyone’s life, they rose to their feet and gave him a round of applause with grateful looks.

Mr. Jia felt awkward. He pointed at Mo Fan and said, “I didn’t do much, it was this Lightning Magician that drove the creature away.”

The people in the cabin were stunned. Mr. Jia was older, and had the impressive demeanor expected from a Magician. The head steward also mentioned through the speakers that he was an Advanced Magician. As such, everyone assumed he was the main contributor to driving the bird away. To their surprise, the young student beside him was their true savior.

Mo Fan returned to his seat without saying anything.

Mr. Jia felt even more awkward. He remembered how he was talked down to the young man, and recalled how helpless he was against the strange bird. He was even more impressed by Mo Fan’s talents.

“Did you really drive that strange bird away?” asked the girl named Fenfen sitting beside him.

“I guess so,” Mo Fan smiled. He could see the adoring look in the girl’s eyes.

He sighed to himself; he was indeed a giant among men. Even riding a plane could get him so much attention. He did not even have the chance to stay low for a couple of days.

Forget it, he had to start getting used to being in the limelight for the rest of his life!

Mo Fan’s destination was Peru in South America. The national team was already waiting for him in Hanmi City in Peru.

Hanmi City was located in the south of Peru. It was not a rainforest, but scorching dry land and desert. It was common to see huge orange rocks extending endlessly into the horizon, connected with the blue sky. At times, there would be mountains standing alone on the barren lands with nothing else within a few kilometers. The long shadows of the mountains were like giant black swords slashing the ground in half.

The temperature increased dramatically after reaching Hanmi City. Mo Fan immediately regrouped with the national team as soon as he landed. Mo Fan was having trouble adapting to the scorching heat, feeling like he was being baked inside an oven. On the other hand, Little Flame Belle was enjoying herself. It felt like she had returned to the North Burning Valley.

Mo Fan found Ai Jiangtu and the others inside an inn in Hanmi City. They were chilling in the bar while enjoying local beers. Everyone seemed to be pleased with themselves. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Perhaps because of the hot weather, Mo Fan was not surprised to see Jiang Shaoxu in skimpy clothes. A third of her breasts were exposed, setting off the open-mindedness and unruliness of the locals in South America. Her short, tight pants made her buttocks look even more alluring.

“Yo! Mo Fan!” Jiang Shaoxu was the first to notice him. She immediately donned a seductive grin.

“Come, give me a hug,” Mo Fan burst out laughing as he strutted forward and took advantage of the woman.

Jiang Shaoxu did not mind at all. She gave Mo Fan a pleasant-smelling and soft hug. It was meant to be a normal way of greeting people in foreign countries, yet Mo Fan purposely squeezed the soft flesh that was about to burst out from her chest!

Bouncy! They were extremely bouncy!

Jiang Shaoxu’s goods were really impressive. Mo Fan was sure that she was not stacking anything underneath them. He could easily tell from the touch alone.

“Pervert!” Jiang Shaoxu rolled her eyes at Mo Fan seductively. She did not seem to be bothered by Mo Fan’s perverted act.

“Humph, she was greeting you, what the heck were you doing, pervert!” snapped an unfamiliar voice.

Mo Fan turned around and saw a face he had never seen before.

However, he could easily guess that the person was Lu Yilin. Mu Nujiao and the others already mentioned him when he was still at the Training Hall. After Mu Nujiao and he left the national team, Lu Yilin was the one that took their place.

“She didn’t mention a word, who do you think you are to criticize me?” replied Mo Fan unpleasantly.

“She’s a woman, so of course she would feel embarrassed if she pointed it out, but you better watch yourself! By the way, shouldn’t a rookie like you respect the seniors on the team? Is that how you talk to your seniors!” snapped Lu Yilin furiously.

Mo Fan glanced at Jiang Shaoxu and saw her wearing a cunning smile. He immediately came to a realization.

This Lu Yilin must have fallen for Jiang Shaoxu after being teased by her vixenish temperament. As such, he was surely not happy when he saw Mo Fan taking advantage of the woman he was interested in.

“Senior?”

“HAHAHA, Mo Fan, you’re a junior now,” Jiang Yu burst out laughing.

Mo Fan was left speechless. Did he seriously have to waste his time on an idiot when he just came back to the team? Didn’t he only take slight advantage of her, not to mention how willing she was!

“Lu Yilin said something to Jiang Shaoxu after drinking some alcohol, but it looks like he has been rejected, so he is still pissed. You happened to arrive and stepped on his tail!” Zhao Manyan went up to Mo Fan and informed him.

Mo Fan understood. Now it made sense why someone would pick on him when he just arrived. It seemed like this Lu Yilin was in a bad mood after he was placed in the friendzone.

What an idiot, treating him as a punching bag? Was this guy out of his goddamn mind?

“You have three seconds, keep a distance of more than ten meters away from me. Otherwise, the smell of booze and your fragile little princess temperament are urging me to beat you up!” said Mo Fan.

“HAHAHA, fragile temperament of a little princess!... Mo Fan, do you really have to go so far?” Zhao Manyan immediately burst into laughter.

Some among the group chuckled after hearing the comment, too.

Lu Yilin blushed when he saw the team laughing after his rejection was exposed. His burning eyes glared at Mo Fan.

“Looks like I’ll have to teach you how to behave as a member of the national team!” Lu Yilin’s eyes emitted a golden light.

A few patterns appeared around him and swiftly combined into a golden Star Pattern.

“Star...Star Constellation, it’s an Advanced Spell!”

The people in the bar were shocked when they saw the brilliant golden light. It was incredibly rare to see an Advanced Magician in an average city like Hanmi City!

Lu Yilin’s expression recovered slightly when he heard the people exclaiming. The world was pretty blatant after all. Strength meant everything in this world; he could pick on anyone as long as he was strong enough!

“You were just promoted to the national team from the Training Hall. You’re still too weak compared to the rest of us. You better...” Lu Yilin gave Mo Fan a righteous stare.

“Piss off!” Mo Fan’s eyes emitted an imperious, silver glow.

As Lu Yilin was about to finish his golden Star Constellation, a strong force rammed into him and sent him flying before he could react...

He flew from the center of the bar to the middle of the road outside the inn, sweeping dust into the air.

The people who were making noise in the bar immediately fell silent.

Even the members of the national team were stunned. They looked at the mysterious silver glow around Mo Fan in disbelief.

“Space...Space Element!” Jiang Shaoxu was the first to scream out in surprise.

Nanyu, Ai Jiangtu, Jiang Yu, Guan Yu, and the others fixed their gazes on Mo Fan, too. No one even cared whether Lu Yilin who was knocked flying was injured or not.

Since when did Mo Fan have access to the Space Element? Judging from how he was able to unleash the strong force within an instant, he was already familiar with using it, too!

“Humph, Double Innate Elements, you finally showed your innate talent. However, aren’t you overreacting to using it on your teammate in the middle of a quarrel!?” Guan Yu condemned in a jealous voice.

Mo Fan’s Double Innate Elements was not really a secret. The reason he did not show it when he was still on the team was that his Space Element was still too weak back then. He only got better at it after focusing on training it when he returned home.

“I only used a Basic Spell, but he was trying to cast an Advanced Spell on me. It’s been months since I last scolded you, are those fish bones of yours itching already? Do you want me to send you out there to keep that idiot in company?” Mo Fan looked at Guan Yu and replied with a hollow laugh.

{TL Note: The Yu in Guan Yu’s name means fish.}

Guan Yu harrumphed coldly, but he did not dare say anything further.

If he actually fought Mo Fan, it was unlikely for him to win against Mo Fan. Guan Yu felt there was no need to provoke Mo Fan directly for now. Once his cultivation improved further, he had plenty of chances to teach this smug Mo Fan a lesson!

“So you’re that guy with Double Innate Elements!” Jiang Shaoxu’s smile blossomed like a flower. Her seductive eyes admired Mo Fan even more.

Jiang Shaoxu was the kind who was willing to flirt with someone strong who managed to intrigue her. As for someone like Lu Yilin, who was arrogant, proud, and close-minded, she was too lazy to even waste a few glances on him.

“Mo Fan, no infighting on the team,” Ai Jiangtu told him softly.

Mo Fan shrugged, implying that it was Lu Yilin who attacked first. He was only defending himself.

Lu Yilin was not injured from the brief exchange. After all, the spell was mainly used to knock back the target. The physical attributes of an Advanced Magician were not that weak. However, Lu Yilin felt humiliated by it. He was like an erupting volcano ready to challenge Mo Fan to a duel.

“Come out here, we’ll go somewhere with more space. I’m going to teach you the consequences of enraging me!” Lu Yilin yelled at Mo Fan after he came into the bar with dust all over his face.

“Lu Yilin, if you really have the energy for a duel, save it for our trip to Halami Desert tomorrow. Mo Fan isn’t a rookie, he was already on the team before. In fact, he’s your senior,” Nanyu rebuked him.

“Everyone, let’s calm down.” Jiang Shaoxu also realized that it would turn into a huge problem at this rate. She proceeded to cast Pacify on both Mo Fan and Lu Yilin.

The spell was rather effective. Besides, Jiang Shaoxu was the one casting it. Lu Yilin finally withheld his anger and said to Mo Fan, “You just wait!”

“Are you going to complain to your parents or the teacher, little baby?” Mo Fan mocked tight back.

The words immediately set Lu Yilin off. Even Jiang Shaoxu’s Pacify was unable to calm him down. In the end, Ai Jiangtu had to step in to put an end to the farce.

Nanyu glared at Mo Fan, silently asking him to control his sharp tongue for once...
