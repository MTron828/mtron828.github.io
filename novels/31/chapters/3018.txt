3019 The Hearts of The People Are The Will of God

The election lasted for four days. The Asian Parthenon Temple was the first to ignite the Sacred Fire in Athens.

The Sacred Fire of the Parthenon Temple, from the five greatest continents’ affiliated temples, arrived from across the ocean. The affiliated temples had inscribed the name of whoever they supported in the Sacred Fire. The Sacred Fire was escorted from Greece to Athens by a group of Adjudicators who swore their undying loyalty. They ensured nothing would go wrong for every Sacred Fire.

There were a total of five Sacred Fires. All the Sacred Fires would arrive on this day. The fire Sacred Fires represented the official start of the goddess campaign!

“Our compatriots from Australia, the southern end of the Pacific Ocean, support Saintess Ye Xinxia to be our Goddess!” The Old Priest, Falmer, read aloud.

The Sacred Fire lit up. The flame spirits that resembled dragon flies flew to Ye Xinxia’s sculpture and accentuated her soft and serene image.

“Our compatriots from America, both North America and South America support Saintess Izisha as our Goddess!” The Old Priest, Falmer continued.

Every Sacred Fire arrived at a different time. The Old Priest Falmer read the name as soon as Sacred Fire arrived at the city.

There was once an incident where someone intercepted the Sacred Fire. It happened over a century ago because of a conspiracy. Today, the affiliated temples of the continents did not make the routes public. They also refused to inform outsiders of their support.

The support ratio on this day was three to two.

Ye Xinxia obtained support from three affiliated temples in Asia, Australia, and Europe. She gained an upper hand in the election.

…

In just one night, many people had difficulty sleeping. Although many of the insiders predicted the outcome of the Sacred Fire, the electoral advantage could influence the public opinion. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the second day, those who were concerned about the results of the election finally smiled. Today, they would announce the support of the Magic Associations from around the world.

It was clear that Izisha was greater than Ye Xinxia in terms of her network and influence. The Magic Associations from all over the world supported Izisha to be the Goddess. She gained complete victory in today’s election results and suppressed the public opinion from last night.

“The Hunter Union, the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance, and the Ocean Union support Izisha…”

“Many national regimes are very close with Izisha.”

“Judging from today’s results, if it weren’t for the Victorian family and its associated forces siding with Ye Xinxia, she stands no chance of serving as the Goddess.”

“Izisha focuses on diplomacy.”

“If that’s the case, Ye Xinxia is at a disadvantage. After all, she lacks the powerful Magic Associations’ support. Aside from Australia, the rest of the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance supports Izisha. Didn’t Ye Xinxia manage to convince the Magic Associations to support her?”

The election results today surprised Ye Xinxia’s supporters. Izisha had a terrifying influence in diplomacy. Not only did she overcome yesterday’s disadvantage, but she may also win the election due to her lead!

Some people were overjoyed, while others were concerned. The final results would jeopardize the interests of numerous parties. Izisha was in a favorable position, and people were arguing vehemently about her.

…

The night filled with anxiety eventually passed. On the third day of election, the old priest announced the number of supporters from within the Parthenon Temple.

The internal management’s support was significant. If the internal management supported the same saintess, or if Izisha led in the number of votes, then she would be the Goddess!

“I am the Lord of the Hall of Knights, Haylon. I swear to pledge my undying loyalty to Saintess Ye Xinxia.”

Haylon read out the name of the person he supported before the two sculptures. In other words, if Izisha became the Goddess, the Lord of the Hall of Knights would have to pack up his desk and leave.

But this was the way the internal management did things. If they chose wrongly, all hell would break loose. People in the Parthenon Temple could never be neutral. They either rose to power or fell from grace!

“We pledge our loyalty to Saintess Ye Xinxia!” The Golden Sun Knights of the Hall of Knights declared.

“We pledge our loyalty to Saintess Ye Xinxia!” The Silver Moon Knights of the Hall of Knights announced.

“We pledge our loyalty to Saintess Ye Xinxia!” The Blue Star Knight of the Hall of Knights reinforced.

The Hall of Knights represented the most powerful armed forces of the Parthenon Temple. All of them supported Ye Xinxia to be the new Goddess. The majestic aura pervaded the entire Athens. The results of the campaign became even more tense.

The result from the internal organization of the Parthenon Temple was clear. The Hall of Judgment supported Izisha, while the other three greatest halls supported Ye Xinxia!

The election results today dampened the arrogance of Izisha’s supporters. Everyone assumed Ye Xinxia was certain to win the Parthenon Temple’s election. The Parthenon Temple was almost certain to fall in the hands of the saintess with the Divine Soul!

The outsiders found the results getting even more exciting. However, Izisha and Ye Xinxia were as calm and still as lake water.

They were aware that this was the final result. Both parties would most likely end up neck and neck in terms of internal and external votes.

But the Parthenon Temple could not have two Goddesses. They could not hold on to two saintesses forever either.

“People in Athens have always maintained a tradition of democracy and fairness. Even though most of the Goddesses in the past won the Goddess Peak with a majority of votes, it is different this time. This shows that both of our candidates are equally talented and outstanding. Regardless of who becomes the Goddess, they would bring endless glory to the Parthenon Temple,” said the Old Priest, Falmer, aloud.

His voice was enchanted, so that everyone in every corner of the city could hear him.

The neck and neck result meant that the final election would progress to a special segment. And many people waited in anticipation.

“Since the two candidates are equally outstanding and won the votes from the inside and outside of the Parthenon Temple, Athens will decide who will be the Goddess. Everyone, who are you willing to support? Give us a final answer! The hearts of the people are the will of God!” The Old Priest, Falmer, said to the crowd gathered in Athens.

The hearts of the people were the will of God. The people in the city were the ultimate decision makers.

Everyone in the city had a vote.

In fact, this was an ancient voting method in the Goddess election. The first Goddess was voted by the people of Athens.

After thousands of years, the Goddess election attracted worldwide attention. Therefore, the votes of the people in Athens were no longer used as sole reference.

After so many long years, even the people of Athens forgot they also had the right to vote for the Goddess. They were the key to the election of the Goddess this time. The whole city was in uproar!

“At this very moment, your decision is the will of God. Our glorious people of God, please listen to the truest call of your heart and tell us who is the daughter of God of our Parthenon Temple!” said the Old Priest, Falmer.
