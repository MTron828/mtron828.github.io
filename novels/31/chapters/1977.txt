The Mailong Private Military Group had no choice but to charge forward, even when they knew the claws of the spiders were everywhere under their feet. Some of the mercenaries were tenacious. They would rather sever their own legs than be dragged into the ground by the Bone-Eating Spiders!

The mercenary group lost a few more people in the valley. The slope they were looking for finally showed up ahead after they all made it through the valley.

The slope was similar to a narrow path on the edge of a cliff. The steep cliff rose up and parted ways with the path leading deeper into the canyon.

The group quickly climbed up the slope. The Bone-Eating Spiders were long waiting for them, as if they knew their plan all along. The side of the cliff was crawling with spiders. It looked like a sinister brown agate from afar!

“They are trying to block our path!” Tommy snarled.

“We have to clear a path with brute force,” Kuma harrumphed. She quickly ran to the front of the group and overtook the ninth team.

The Vice Leader was going to lead the way to clear a path up the slope, which was now full of spiders hanging on it like a vineyard.

Kuma was a Plant Mage. She fired red seeds onto the ground, which grew rapidly as soon as they touched the dried rocks. They turned into huge Flesh-Eating Morning Glories in just a few seconds!

The Flesh-Eating Morning Glories blossomed continuously, as if they were growing in fertile soil. Flesh-Eating Morning Glories were able to swing their stems and roots around. When they picked up the scent of the Bone-Eating Spiders, countless fangs immediately surfaced on the thing and long-stemmed flowers in circles. The Flesh-Eating Morning Glories could devour several Bone-Eating Spiders at once.

“Follow the Vice Leader!”

“Follow the Vice Leader!”

The Mailong Private Military Group did not break from its formation even after losing a few members. They had been through many situations where comrades who just had a laugh with them a few moments ago suddenly turned into dead bodies. The mercenaries all possessed a strong will to survive. They followed the path that Kuma cleared with the Flesh-Eating Morning Glories and charged toward the slope with high morale.

“We have to go higher. Otherwise, the mudslide will bury us!” Nanyu declared.

“Watch our backs, you useless pricks!” Gavin snarled.

Gavin did not care whether they were strong, he was only concerned about the outcome. The ninth team had failed to do their job properly when clearing the path in the valley, and members of his team had died because of it.

Ai Jiangtu had a good temper, and actually tolerated it. He knew it was meaningless to argue among themselves when their lives were at stake.

The ninth team was at the back of the group again. The Bone-Eating Spiders that were appearing from the cracks and walls were trying to keep them busy.

They no longer had to rely on Nanyu’s hearing, as the entire Rift Valley was shaking now. The Mailong Private Military Group was under a lot of pressure. They wondered if the oncoming flood was going to be upon them in the next second!

The Mailong Private Military Group worked even harder to eliminate the Bone-Eating Spiders. The blood of the spiders was pouring down the slope like a stream and formed a pool of gore at the lower ground. Their remains rolled down the slope and piled up at the bottom.

Overall, the Mailong Private Military Group was quite strong. The Bone-Eating Spiders found them unstoppable. The low-level Bone-Eating Spiders had no chance of even slowing them. They were already eighty meters above the lowest ground.

They stood on the slope and looked back at the canyon and the valley. They thought the landslide would be similar to a river flowing into the canyon. It would follow the structure of the canyon, but the flood’s momentum was crazier than everyone had imagined. It was like a steel magic dragon ramming into the walls and leaving the area in ruins. The canyon was now twice as big!

The mudslide was getting closer. Luckily, the ninth team made a final push and claimed a higher location, or someone might have been caught by the destructive landslide.

Everyone felt like they had temporarily lost their hearing beneath the deafening noise the mudslide was producing.

The flash flood swept past like a terrifying dark brown dragon, and everyone witnessed the utter destruction it brought. They were relieved they had reached the slope and cleared a path forcibly in time. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“How terrifying!” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

She had thought the mudslide would just be an ordinary occurrence before, but after witnessing its destruction, she realized how minuscule she was. Even those with outstanding cultivation had no chance of surviving it.

“These Bone-Eating Spiders are very cunning. They retreated immediately when they figured out the mudslide wasn’t going to bury us. They left quicker than a falling tide!” Zhao Manyan noticed.

“They know how to abuse their advantages and avoid unfavorable situations. They chose to wait for their next prey patiently when they weren’t confident enough to take us down. The spiders just need to rebuild their spiderwebs when a powerful creature runs through them. They just need to be patient,” Lingling said.

The threat posed by the Bone-Eating Spiders had been beyond everyone’s expectations.

After doing a quick headcount, the Mailong Private Military Group had lost around ten people. They had remained in formation while they were clearing a path on the slope, which minimized the losses. Their main losses were in the valley where the Camouflage Bone-Eating Spiders dragged some of their members into the ground.

There was nothing they could do about it. If it weren’t for the mudslide, they could still have saved their comrades. They would not abandon anyone if they were still alive, but they were left with no choice with the terrifying flash flood coming right at them!

“We’ve encountered so many obstacles, and we are only at the barren layer. Won’t the situation and demon creatures at the higher altitude be a lot worse?” Guan Yu spoke up. “The Mailong Private Military Group is quite impressive. If it was some other group with a weak mentality, the Bone-Eating Spiders might actually have dragged the battle out until we were all buried under the ground.”
