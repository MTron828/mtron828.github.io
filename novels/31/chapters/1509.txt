“Miss Brianca, you won’t have to look for a Soul Container for me. I already have one, it’s something that my family has been passing down from generation to generation. Is the Magic Medium Ring really as impressive as you said?” Mo Fan said.

“You can give it a go if you have a Soul Essence to spare,” Brianca said.

“Sure, let’s head to the outskirts in the south!” Mo Fan could not wait to see it in action.

Brianca was thinking of buying some Soul Essences from the marketplace. She had a lot of money with her. Since she had decided to give the Magic Medium Ring to Mo Fan as a gift, she felt it was inappropriate to give it to him empty. She was thinking of filling it up with some Soul Essences so it could significantly improve Mo Fan’s Summoning Spell.

Mo Fan was pleased by Brianca’s attitude of making sure the wallet was full of money even when she was planning to give it away as a gift. However, the price of Soul Essences at the marketplace was too high.

A single Servant-class Soul Essence cost around four million.

A Warrior-level Soul Essence cost around seventeen million. A Commander-level Soul Essence cost a few hundred million!

These were the common prices in New Suez. Egypt was constantly at war with the undead, thus they were able to ‘mass produce’ Soul Remnants and Soul Essences. They were a lot cheaper than the market price in China, but it was difficult to evaluate their quality...

Brianca was a Super Mage. She could easily afford a few Soul Essences, but in Mo Fan’s eyes, it was a complete waste of money!

He had no problem collecting Soul Essences by himself. The only problem was... would the Magic Medium Ring accept the Soul Essences that Little Loach refined?

If it would, Mo Fan would have the best day of his life!

The two went to the outskirts and found a spot far away from the battlefield in a huge forest with wilted trees. It was most likely an oasis along the Nile in the past, but it had ended up in a miserable state due to the poison the demon creatures were unleashing.

The ground of the forest had cracked open a little. The sand of the dunes in the distance was slowly moving toward it. A few Lesser Lamias that had lost their ways were visible to them. They didn’t know which way the city was!

“Try it out!” Brianca gave Mo Fan the Magic Medium Ring.

Mo Fan put the Ring on his finger. The Ring softened and turned into a liquid, dissolving into his body as soon as it touched him.

Only magic Equipment had to be bound to a Mage’s soul. Magical artifacts were similar to accessories. Anyone could wear and remove them at any time!

“Little Loach, a Warrior-level Soul Essence please!” Mo Fan whispered to his little ancestor.

Little Loach was very cooperative, and immediately delivered a Warrior-level Soul Essence that it had refined not long ago into Mo Fan’s body. Normally, these Soul Essences could only enter Mo Fan’s Spiritual World to strengthen his Stars, but this time, Mo Fan was planning to transfer it to his new Ring!

Mo Fan was feeling a little nervous. He was worried that the two items could not work together, and also afraid that the Magic Medium Ring would not accept the Soul Essences refined by Little Loach...

Buzz...

His worries were unnecessary. The Magic Medium Ring promptly absorbed the Warrior-level Soul Essence from Little Loach. When Mo Fan opened his eyes, he saw a yellow half-crescent wrapping around the finger he had put the Ring on...

“Is that it?” Mo Fan asked Brianca.

“Yes, try casting the spell!” Brianca replied.

The Beast Tide spell consumed a significant amount of energy, and the longer its duration, the more energy it needed.

Mo Fan took a deep breath. He was still feeling a little nervous.

“Summoning Gate: Beast Tide!”

After the completion of the Star Constellation, the gate that a lunar-white glow constructed slowly opened up. A bunch of ferocious Enormous White Wolves charged out from it and howled their loudest.

Not long afterwards, over forty Enormous White Wolves had come out from the Summoning Gate. They ran a few circles around Mo Fan before realizing something. They went up to Mo Fan with confused faces.

Didn’t he Summon them for a fight? Where was the enemy?

“I need a headcount!” Mo Fan urged them to get into a line.

The Enormous White Wolves were quite confused, but they still stood in a line obediently.

Normally, the creatures of a Beast Tide would not take orders from a Summoner. Their main purpose was to crush and trample everything in front of them. If the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was not watching, these Enormous White Wolves would be throwing a tantrum in the jungle by now!

“Forty-five... Old Wolf, is this guy new?” Mo Fan walked from one end to the other among the wolves. He did not rely on these simple-headed creatures to count themselves.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was like a platoon leader accompanying his superior. He let out a cry and ordered an Enormous White Wolf that was obviously a lot smaller than the rest of the wolves to step forward.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf could recognize every Enormous White Wolf under his lead. Even though not all of them would be Summoned by the spell every time, he could still tell that the wolf did not belong to his platoon!

After a closer look, it turned out that the creature was not even the same species as the others. It was a White-Marked Wolf, with a beastly making on its forehead!

“There’s indeed one extra!” Mo Fan was overjoyed when he saw the extra White-Marked Wolf.

The White-Marked Wolves were a lesser Warrior-level species in the Summoned Beast Plane. They were weaker than the Enormous White Wolves, mainly because the Soul Essence that Mo Fan fed to the Magic Medium Ring was not high-quality...

The rest of the Enormous White Wolves were extremely slow in their reactions. They grinned and revealed their sharp fangs after realizing a creature of different species was among them!

“That’s enough, say hello to your new member,” Mo Fan immediately grunted at the Enormous White Wolves, who were treating the new guy so fiercely.

The Enormous White Wolves immediately withdrew their fierce expressions, not daring to disobey Mo Fan’s instructions!

“If I feed a Commander-level Soul Essence to it, wouldn’t that mean I will Summon an extra Commander-level creature then?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes, but it will speed up the consumption rate of your energy,” Brianca confirmed.

“This magic tool is insane! Thank you, Brianca,” Mo Fan was as happy and excited as if he had just seen a whole army of wolves, even though he had only Summoned an extra White-Marked Wolf.

“You’re welcome. It’s been with me for a long time. I believe it needs a more suitable owner,” Brianca smiled.

“I’m pretty lucky this time. I rarely Summon a tide with more than forty beasts, but there are forty-four of them, and a new White-Marked Wolf this time!” Mo Fan said excitedly.

“I forgot to mention... the Magic Medium Ring has another effect, too. It will maximize the number of creatures you can Summon. In other words, from now on, you will always Summon at least forty-five creatures when casting the spell,” Brianca suddenly remembered.

“Seriously? That is perfect!” Mo Fan was overjoyed once again.

The number of creatures Summoned by a Beast Tide was usually randomized. The stronger a Summoner’s cultivation was, the higher the upper and lower limits of the number of creatures being Summoned. The number of creatures brought in by Mo Fan’s current cultivation ranged from thirty to forty. Even Mo Fan had no idea that the highest number of creatures he could Summon was forty-four, excluding the White-Marked Wolf!Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
