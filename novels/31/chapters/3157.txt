Chapter 3158 ¬†Trouble in the Mortal World

"Will the Ocean Demons calm down now? I haven't checked on my yacht and those beautiful girls in a long time. Since the ocean became dangerous, I had to give up this relaxing and healthy activity. I really miss it," Zhao Manyan said. He looked tired, but there was a sparkle in his eyes.

"They might stay quiet for a while, but there's no guarantee that they won't return. Even without the King of Night and Day controlling them, the Ocean Demons have grown very strong in recent years. Plus, they have powerful leaders like the Ocean Godly Horde. The coastline will probably always be on alert," Mu Bai said.

The Ocean Godly Horde's desire to invade the land would never go away.

Even with the Cold Moon Evil Eye defeated, coastal areas of various countries would still face many Ocean Demons attacks. Resources were limited, and too many demon tribes would eventually go to war with humans.

"It's okay. The waters around Fanxue Mountain are safe now. The Blue Sea Trees have even formed a blue forest on the ocean. It acts as a natural barrier and looks beautiful. It's almost becoming a tourist spot," Mo Fan said.

"That's great. My yacht can finally go back to the ocean. I can sail, enjoy the sunshine, fine wine, and‚Ä¶ hehe," Zhao Manyan said with a chuckle.

"Hehe." Mo Fan also chuckled.

Since the ocean was calm, they should enjoy the peace they had earned. After all, they had done something impressive.

Mu Bai was speechless.

These two were already thinking about yachts, sunshine, and beautiful girls even though they were still in dangerous waters. Most people who escaped the Dark Plane would be traumatized. They would lose their appetite and have nightmares. In some serious cases, they would even hurt themselves and get a mental breakdown.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan did not seem affected.

However, Mu Bai kindly reminded them that there could be side effects from leaving the Dark Plane. It was easy for the mind to be affected by darkness.

‚Ä¶

The trip was a huge success.

Mo Fan's Shadow Element had advanced to the Forbidden Curse level.

As a Double Elements Forbidden Mage, hardly anyone in the world could challenge him, even without his Demon Element. As long as he did not provoke those from Roof of the World, he would be fine.

With that said, he was obviously not afraid of trouble.

If anyone dared to attack, Mo Fan would fight back fiercely. He would tell them that his father-in-law was a high-ranking emperor!

When Mo Fan returned to Fanxue Mountain and saw the city thriving, he felt emotional. Most people did not know that he had done something huge‚Äîhe had defeated a powerful ally of the Ocean Demons.

This was good. With the advanced Black Magic he brought back, he could improve the country's magic schools. The threat of Ocean Demons had made it hard to advance magic education in recent years.

They finally had some peace. In a few years, more talented mages would emerge and be ready to take on responsibilities. This had always been the way.

There would always be challenges in a world with magic, but constant growth was essential for survival. Even Mo Fan would grow old someday.

‚Ä¶

The magical Blue Sea Trees looked stunning under the soft sunlight. Sightseeing boats were moving through the blue forest that grew on the sea.

Some of the trees' roots and branches were unique. They intertwined to form paths that people could walk on.

With green waves below and dreamy blue trees around, it felt like being in an elven sanctuary. The place looked especially beautiful at sunset.

People had not been this close to the ocean in a long time. They had almost forgotten that the nearby sea used to be a paradise.

"Whoo!"

A silver-white yacht was gracefully sailing in an "S" shape between the trees. A group of beautiful college girls was also standing on the wooden deck. They were dressed in light, breezy clothes, and their long hair flowed in the wind.

Their healthy, glowing skin was visible under their sheer sun protection clothes. Their lovely figures were sensual, and their sunny, confident smiles were captivating. They drew many glances from the onlookers around them.

"Being rich is so nice. When I make it big, I want to rent a yacht and have fun with some models like them," a young man who looked like a student said with admiration.

"Hmph! What's so special about them? They get to live so happily because us mages risk our lives to protect them. I really look down on people like them. Is having money really that impressive?!" another man who had been in battles retorted.

"Hey, isn't that Mo Fan on the yacht?"

"Yeah, it is. Well, he deserves to have fun," the man quickly changed his opinion.

They could not compare themselves with Mo Fan. He had truly made a huge contribution that benefited all Forbidden Mages. Besides, there were not that many beautiful women on the yacht. It did not suit his status.

‚Ä¶

Mo Fan had a cold beer while he enjoyed the gentle sea breeze on the yacht.

The ocean had a fascinating allure, and it was a shame that it had been overrun by Ocean Demons.

Humans tended to wear less clothes when near the warm and romantic ocean. Mo Fan appreciated its simplicity and natural beauty.

"Mo Fan, can you help me put sunscreen on my back? Make sure it's even," a cheerful girl asked.

As a respected senior at Pearl Institute, he had to help his junior with such small favors.

"Don't use magic. Use your hands," the sexy girl reminded him.

Zhao Manyan was sprawled out on a bench. Exhausted from the dangerous situation they had experienced, he did not feel like moving. Two beautiful girls were taking turns feeding him watermelon, one spoonful at a time.

He just looked straight ahead. When the girls leaned over to offer him the delicious watermelon, their chests would get closer to him.

"Mu Bai, why are you so stubborn? Technically, you're not even a true human anymore. Why do you still act so pure and innocent? Who are you trying to impress? You were a virgin when you were alive. Now that you're practically half-dead, you still cling to that virtue. If you ever become a ruler of the Dark Plane, I'll make sure everyone knows that you're a virgin," Zhao Manyan criticized Mu Bai in annoyance.

Mu Bai was indeed reserved.

He was not used to being surrounded by so many girls in bikinis. Everywhere he looked, there were bare thighs and skin. He could only lie on his back helplessly and look at the sky.

However, Zhao Manyan's words angered him. Through gritted teeth, he retorted, "You'd better not fall into my hands. I'll bring every lascivious dragon from the Dark Plane and make sure you have a 'good time' with them!"

"Don't you dare bring up those dragons to me!" Zhao Manyan's anger flared. He nearly rushed forward to confront Mu Bai.

"Don't you dare lecture me about what to do, then!" Mu Bai retorted.

The girls burst into laughter when they heard the two men arguing. Why were these two big shots in the magic world so down-to-earth? They were arguing like two buddies in a college dorm. The girls had thought that these two men would be all serious and mysterious.

"Mo Fan, I also study the Shadow Element. Can you give me some private tutoring sometime?" She fed Mo Fan a cool slice of watermelon.

Mo Fan pushed his sunglasses down a bit and saw a pure, charming face. He liked such straightforward people the best. She was also gentle when asking for help.

"Sure. You know, the Shadow Element is best practiced late at night," Mo Fan took a bite of the sweet watermelon and gave the pure and charming girl a meaningful look.

She immediately understood and massaged his leg.

"Mo Fan, I heard that you're also great at the Summoning Element. Could you give me some tips when you get the chance?" At that moment, a slightly cold voice came from one of the girls on the yacht.

Even though she was asking for help, her voice carried a hint of dignity and nobility. It was as if she usually avoided interacting with other men. If it were not for Mo Fan being so special, she would not have approached him.

Oddly enough, Mo Fan was quite fond of her voice type.

He enjoyed watching this ice-cold beauty gradually open up to him. It gave him a special sense of accomplishment.

"Summoning Element, huh? That's no problem." Mo Fan did not turn around. Instead, he moved his shoulders to signal the cool and distant beauty to massage them.

Soon, her fair hands landed on Mo Fan's shoulders, and she started applying pressure. At first, Mo Fan did not notice anything wrong. But when he saw the strange look in the cheerful girl's eyes, he realized that something was off.

No way!

With his keen senses, how could someone move behind him unnoticed?

Whoever it was, they must just be someone who resembled that ice-cold beauty from earlier!

"Hey, I know I said that I could teach you the Shadow Element late at night, but I realized I'm a married man now. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to meet so late," Mo Fan said seriously.

"I don't mind," the pure and charming girl replied.

"I'd rather not. I was joking earlier," Mo Fan said with a forced smile.

"But you've done it before, haven't you?" The girl's smile grew brighter. There was a hint of shyness and innocence in her eyes, which shocked Mo Fan.

He suddenly realized something and looked at her with surprise. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

Both girls were suspicious!

"Apas!" Mo Fan finally figured it out and pointed at the girl who wanted him to give her late-night lessons.

When he called out her name, the girl's appearance immediately changed. Her captivating eyes turned into a unique golden color!

She was pure, charming, alluring, and seductive, especially in her cute swimsuit. The bikini top was too small, and her big chest was almost bursting out of them. It was incredibly tempting!

"You‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ How?" Mo Fan's mouth dropped open in shock. He was unable to speak for a while.

The pure and charming girl, who had been flirting with him all along, was actually Apas!

How did she manage to fool him?

That shameless snake actually‚Ä¶

"I know you just returned from the Dark Plane and need to relax. Apas happened to come to Fanxue Mountain, so I asked her to keep you company. How does it feel?" the cold and familiar voice behind him spoke up.

She kept massaging his shoulders like a devoted wife, and the pressure was perfect, not forced at all.

Yet, for some reason, her icy tone made Mo Fan break out in a cold sweat. He had not felt this tense even when facing the Figures in Eight Directions.

Oh, no!

He had survived the hellish Dark Plane but could not escape the trouble waiting for him in the mortal world!
