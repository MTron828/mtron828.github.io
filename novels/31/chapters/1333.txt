Xinxia sat beside Leng Qing with her eyes closed. She was trying to feel the battle with her heartbeat.

Little Flame Belle was furious, sensing that Mo Fan was seriously injured. It was likely that the battle did not go according to plan.

“How much time do we have left?” Feng Zhoulong asked.

“Less than five minutes,” Lingling said expressionlessly.

Five minutes. Normally, it would be gone very quickly with a little daydreaming, but Lingling had the urge to make it last for the whole day, or even for the whole year!

“We’re asking too much from him. Bei Jiang is extremely talented. The fact that he earned his reputation before he even reached the Super Level indicates that he’s even scarier than some of the Super Mages... we should just call it off if it won’t work out. If we know we can’t save her, we should avoid more unnecessary casualties,” Tata spoke up.

“Damn it, the Nanguo Magic Association can’t even do anything to the assassin. Such a disgrace!” Feng Zhoulong blurted out furiously.

They had a lot of powerful Mages, yet none of them was of any use in this situation. If any of them drew closer to the highway, Bei Jiang would surely flee, and Leng Qing would have no chance of survival!

Mo Fan was their only hope, but they were worried that Mo Fan would die to the assassin too!

——

The sound of the cars faded into the distance. Mo Fan was surprised by their sudden intrusion. He had chosen this desolated place to avoid unnecessary casualties.

Bei Jiang was not interested in the man driving the sports car, being focused on the battle against Mo Fan. If he could take Mo Fan down, his reputation among the assassins would rise dramatically. After all, even Salan could not do anything about him!

“It doesn’t feel good, right? Dying isn’t a hassle, but you’re still carrying the burden of trying to save a woman’s life on your shoulders ... say, why don’t we make a little deal? I’m not a greedy man. Killing Leng Qing is just business. I’m not really fond of the Cold Prince of the Black Vatican. His arrogance annoys me. I’ll withdraw my Dark energy so Leng Qing can slowly recover, and you will stop struggling and extend your neck, so I can sever your head with a clean cut...” Bei Jiang offered.

As time passed, Bei Jiang was enjoying the battle more. He could sense Mo Fan’s impatience and panic; it was utterly pleasing!

Mo Fan ignored Bei Jiang’s proud remarks. Judging from the direction of the voice, Bei Jiang was standing right in front of him. However, the man surely had some tricks up in his sleeves. He would not dare stand in front of Mo Fan, since Mo Fan could easily inflict serious damage on him with a full-on destructive spell!

Mo Fan withheld the urge to attack. He continued to dodge the continuous attacks from the demonic shadows while analyzing the traits of Bei Jiang’s abilities...

Mo Fan heard the man driving the sports car being mocked by his friends for wetting his pants in the distance. Mo Fan was left speechless by those guys. Did they not have any brains? The road was so dark, with occasional electricity flickers. It was obviously not just a natural phenomenon!

Wait a second, wasn’t the guy driving straight ahead? When did he turn back? The thought crossed Mo Fan’s mind and stuck there.

The man obviously could not think straight after getting the shit scared out of him. He just kept driving straight ahead since he was too terrified to turn around. Mo Fan did not see the car turn around, nor was there any sign that the man had driven across the black swamp a second time!

The road was perfectly straight. If he kept driving ahead, how did he end up going back to his friends?

“The Chaos Element?” Mo Fan finally realized something important.

He naively assumed Bei Jiang was using the Shadow Element! The man was able to disappear and reappear as he pleased. Even when he was standing right in front of Mo Fan, it was more like a black shadow projected in front of him. Mo Fan was struggling to lock down his enemy’s actual position...

The Chaos Element was Dimensional Magic, capable of manipulating the order of the dimensions. The directions could be reversed, energy could be deflected, attacks could be reflected, and even the space would be in disarray. When a moving object entered an area manipulated by Chaos Magic, it would return to the same spot even when they kept moving in the same direction. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Normally, if an area was manipulated by the Chaos Magic, most people could easily tell what was happening by looking at their surroundings. For example, the straight road was now meandering, indicating that Chaos Magic had altered it. If the sky was seemingly below him, it indicated that gravity had been reversed...

However, the whole place was in pitch-black darkness due to the black swamp. It did not matter how twisted and deranged his surroundings were, Mo Fan was not able to tell!

It explained why the sports car had gone back to where it had come from, even though it was driving straight ahead. It also explained why the demonic shadows could eerily change their positions, and why he was struggling so much to land his attacks!

The Shadow Element and the Chaos Element!

It was impossible to merge two different Elements, unless the person’s control over the two Elements was strong enough to stack them up perfectly...

Bei Jiang’s Innate Talent had allowed him to merge the Chaos Element and the Shadow Element!

It was the reason why his shadows could show up anywhere. It explained why no one was able to find him. When the Shadow Element and the Chaos Element combined together, they would only feel the presence of the Shadow Element without a single trace of the Chaos Element, misleading them into assuming the man was only using the Shadow Element. They never thought the man had the ability to manipulate the order inside the darkness as he pleased, making him the Ruler of Darkness!

“That’s why!” A strong will erupted inside Mo Fan. He had waited so long for his turn to counterattack!

Mo Fan did not stay in the same spot. He ignored his injuries and sprinted in the direction the sports car was heading to previously, under Flame Belle’s protection.

Mo Fan’s lightning had landed on the sports car’s spoiler when it drove past. The broken parts had scattered across the ground. He searched for the broken parts to ensure he was moving in the right direction...

Luckily, the area had not been shifted again by the Chaos Magic. Mo Fan found pieces of metal on the ground, telling him he was standing at the spot where directions were reversed!

“Oh? Have you made up your mind? Did you decide to save yourself and let Leng Qing die?” Bei Jiang slowly followed behind Mo Fan.

He just needed to let his obedient shadows do the killing. He did not have to do it himself. He grinned when he saw Mo Fan trying to escape.

Humans were all selfish. It was reasonable that Mo Fan did not agree with his suggestion. Either way, Bei Jiang had no intention of letting Mo Fan escape in one piece!

Both Leng Qing and Mo Fan had to die. Did this fool seriously think he could escape from his Order of Darkness? Bei Jiang smirked.

“There’s no escape,” Bei Jiang was like a wolf following the trail of blood that the wild ox Mo Fan had left behind.

The demonic shadows continued to attack and leave Mo Fan with more wounds. He was still bleeding. His blood had left a long trail along the road. It was quite a gory sight.

Mo Fan slowly lifted his right hand. Wisps of flames circled his hand...

He kept pouring his energy into the flames, yet the candlelight on his hand retained its size. Its color gradually darkened as it burned vigorously.

“Do you still think you can hurt me with your magic? I’m afraid I don’t have the patience to play with you anymore. I’ll have to cut you into pieces to make myself feel better.” Bei Jiang did not bother dodging Mo Fan’s attack.

A black knife with jagged edges slowly appeared in his hand, like it had grown out of his arm. The knife smelled like fresh blood. It was difficult to tell how many arteries the deadly weapon had sliced open!

Bei Jiang continued to move closer to Mo Fan without dodging the attack. He was acting calmly, like he could not see the flames on Mo Fan’s hand!

“Keep that Flame Belle busy!” Bei Jiang ordered the shadows.

It was obvious that Bei Jiang had decided to cut Mo Fan’s head off himself. He believed Mo Fan, whose legs were severely injured, had no chance of running away from him.

Mo Fan looked at the approaching shadow. He continued to accumulate fiery energy in the flames burning on his hand. The enormous pressure that Bei Jiang was applying to him did not change his mind. It was time for the final showdown!

The last petal on his palm faded away. Mo Fan felt a sharp pain, as if his heart had just been stabbed. He could not help but gasp.

However, he could not afford to be overwhelmed by sorrow now. He turned the surge of emotion into raging energy accumulating on his palm...

“Still not going to attack? Die then!” Bei Jiang lifted the black knife and slashed at Mo Fan from a safe distance away!

He did not dare to stand too close to Mo Fan, as the man was like an explosive powderkeg. It was better for him to stay a safe distance away!

Mo Fan had long waited for this moment. He lifted the candlelight that was already at its limit.

Bei Jiang was not too bothered by it. He had a disdainful grin as he continued to absorb dark energy. The formidable magic formed a black whirlpool on his knife...

“Die!” “Die!” Two voices uttered simultaneously. Mo Fan was the first to attack. He tossed the candlelight in his hand ahead of him.

Bei Jiang swung the Dark Magic-enhanced knife. He believed his shadows had worn down Mo Fan’s defense. He did not care if the man had attacked slightly earlier than him.

There was no way Mo Fan’s attacks could land on him, not to mention how insignificant the little candlelight seemed...

The two kinds of formidable energy faced one another. They were about to trigger a great storm as the energy crashed into one another, but as they reached a point where they could no longer back away, Mo Fan suddenly turned around!

He had tossed the candlelight, but was tossing it behind him instead!

Bei Jiang was right in front of him, yet he had tossed the flame that served as his last glimpse of hope in the opposite direction of the enemy that was trying to take his life...

Mo Fan’s action was so idiotic that anyone would immediately burst out laughing if they were fighting against him.

However, Bei Jiang’s expression shifted. His eyes flickered with disbelief. The candlelight that had been tossed in the opposite direction was growing larger in his eyes!
