Chapter 2724: God’s Condemnation

“I’m sorry… I’m very sorry, Mr. Mo Fan,” Big Sister Ruan said earnestly. “I was being elusive for a reason. We promise to fulfill our end of the contract. Additionally, we promise to tell you about… another thing related to Licheng Afterglow Island’s spiritual land, too.”

“Licheng Afterglow Island’s spiritual land?” Mo Fan asked. He had noticed that these female mages from the island had a surprisingly high level of cultivation when compared to their lack of combat experience. He had guessed as much that their island might have some heavenly spirits or treasures which made this possible.

With my Super Level cultivation, do you really think I will bother with Licheng Afterglow Island’s spiritual land?” said Mo Fan, pretending to be uninterested.

“Mr. Mo Fan, you’ve no idea how unique our spiritual land is. As long as you’re willing to swear with your soul curse that you will not leak the secrets of our spiritual land, I can assure you that even a Super Level mage like yourself will benefit from it,” Big Sister Ruan said sincerely.

Mo Fan did believe them. Their cultivation was high enough that it certainly made him wonder about their spiritual land. Mo Fan had visited the Three Step Tower of Pearl Institute and Godly Seal Mountain of Parthenon Temple many times before. There was not much left for him to absorb the power at these two places.

His Little Loach had reached Star Sea Level. If he could find a place as holy as the Three Step Tower and Godly Seal Mountain, his Earth and Chaos elements would achieve Super Level!

The soul cultivation holy place that increased these young women’s cultivation to such a high level must certainly contain a very high nutritional value. Mo Fan considered their offer.

“What did you mean when you warned Boss Jin of God’s condemnation? Asked Mo Fan. “I doubt it was supposed to be only some superstitious rambling.”

“The lightning storms. Whenever someone attempts to steal an ancient statue from this place, a lightning storm ensues,” said Big Sister Ruan, answering honestly this time.

“You mean to say the lightning storm from a few days ago was not some natural disaster?”

“Before Boss Jin and his hunters, someone stole one of the statues from this area. That is why we had to come here in a hurry. The Thundercat statue must not be removed. Once it leaves the Mingwu Ancient City territory, the lightning storms that will strike will be ten times more devastating than the one we saw a few days ago. The fortress might be destroyed,” Big Sister Ruan said solemnly.

Mo Fan vividly remembered the lightning storm he had encountered. It hadn’t struck very far from the fortress. If the next lightning storm was ten times stronger, the fortress wasn’t the only one that would be destroyed. A powerful strike of lightning could wipe out all living creatures in the coastal area.

“Is it truly that terrifying?” Mo Fan asked suspiciously.

......

“Yes, it is. We might have hidden things from you before but Big Sister Ruan is telling the truth this time. God’s condemnation is real!” said Shu Xiaohua running over to him. She looked at him piteously, pleading for him to believe them.

“Well, I would like to see how this ‘God’s condemnation’ actually works. Perhaps I might find some clue about the ancient creature which I’m looking for,” Mo Fan said.

“I saw the picture you showed Big Sister Ruan,” said Shu Xiaohua anxiously. “She didn’t lie to you about that. That ancient creature can’t be found here at the Mingwu Ancient City. Because… it is at Licheng Afterglow Island!”

“Shu Xiaohua!” Big Sister Ruan rebuked her.

Mo Fan could not trust Big Sister Ruan anymore but he did trust Shu Xiaohua. She never lied.

“Big Sister Ruan, he is not a bad guy. He’s been so attentive in protecting us along the way,” said Shu Xiaohua. “If we are on our guards the entire time and treat him like a stranger, then we can’t blame him for being unwilling to help us.”

Big Sister Ruan was at a loss for words momentarily. There was no definite way to determine who was good and who was bad but they needed his help right now.

There were many secrets in Licheng Afterglow Island. People with malicious intentions laid their eyes on them like hungry wolves. No one could guarantee someone’s sincerity. Anyone could become corrupt and greedy once they saw the wealth and treasures of Licheng Afterglow Island.

“Thank you for trusting me,” said Mo Fan to Shu Xiaohua. “But I can no longer trust Big Sister Ruan. Instead, I am willing to make a deal with you. To be entirely honest, I am interested in your island. My Chaos and Earth elements have hit their bottleneck and I do need a holy place to achieve a breakthrough. I am willing to help you if you are willing to help me.” He passed the picture to Shu Xiaohua. “Have you seen this ancient creature before?”

Shu Xiaohua nodded. She glanced at Big Sister Ruan. Big Sister Ruan did not stop her.

“Our elders did something stupid a few decades ago. They moved one of the ancient statues from Mingwu Ancient City to Licheng Afterglow Island.” Shu Xiaohua glanced at Big Sister Ruan again.

Big Sister Ruan sighed. “At that time, the ones who lived in the Licheng Afterglow Island had to suffer God’s condemnation. An era of continuous lightning storms befell us. The lightning storms lasted for more than a month. The lightning struck from south to north, and from the sky to the sea and land. As a result, the city, agricultural lands, sea, and forests were severely damaged. Many people died because God had condemned us.”

“That was why Boss Jin said that to you,” said Mo Fan, finally understanding everything. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Big Sister Ruan nodded. “Boss Jin wasn’t aware of it back then. Nobody knew. Our elders and ancestors were ashamed of such an incident. They shifted the blame to an ancient creature which possessed a similar lightning ability,” explained Big Sister Ruan.

Mo Fan was stunned. He had guessed that the creature might be on their island but this…

“I believe it is the same creature that you came looking for,” said Big Sister Ruan. “Our ancestors knew that they had committed a sin. They were wrecked with guilt and ashamed to stay in Licheng Afterglow Island. They lived in seclusion from the world. They vowed to protect the ancient statues in the Mingwu Ancient City to atone for their sin.” Big Sister Ruan lowered her head.

She still remembered the look of guilt and remorse her grandmother had worn even at the end of her life. The tribe had refused to face the truth and shifted the blame to the totem inhabiting the Licheng Afterglow Island. The lightning had caused too many deaths. They had surrounded the ancient lightning creature and attacked it brutally.

“Your ancestors have killed a totem!” Mo Fan cried in shock.

Shu Xiaohua and Big Sister Ruan both lowered their heads and remained silent. Not all of the young women from the group knew about this by the look of surprise and shock in their faces. If not for Big Sister Ruan’s grandmother screaming hysterically in the ancestral hall before her death, Big Sister Ruan and Shu Xiaohua would never have known about it as well.

“Some people say it’s still alive,” Shu Xiaohua whispered.

“Can you find it?” Mo Fan asked.

“Our elders might be able to find it. There is a reason for all this. I had no intention to deceive you…,” said Big Sister Ruan.

Mo Fan sighed. “Alright. I will help you. I will stop Boss Jin and his men. But you have to promise to take me to your island.”

Big Sister Ruan nodded. Mo Fan understood that it must have been very difficult to confide about such a violent past with a stranger. If he could find the totem, even just a carcass of it, this would all be still a worthwhile journey for him.
