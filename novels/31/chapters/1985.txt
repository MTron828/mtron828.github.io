Chapter 1986: An Outbreak, Part Two

Translated by XephiZ

A figure suddenly rushed into a tent. Mu Ningxue slowly opened her eyes. There was no sign of panic in her eyes.

“I must say, even if I have to pay them money instead of winning seven times what I’ve bet, I’m willing to do it as long as I can have an enjoyable night with you. You are seriously the most attractive woman I’ve ever met.” Gavin stood there admiring Mu Ningxue, who was lying inside the tent.

He was looking at her beautiful face, her fair and long neck, and her delicate body.

“Didn’t your Vice Leader tell you anything?” Mu Ningxue sounded a little weak.

“Her? What could she say? That woman... to be honest with you, when she was still attractive around ten years ago, she was also a plaything in our group. The old mercenaries all have their own stories of how they fooled around with her after some drinks. If she hadn’t been lucky enough to become a Super Mage a few years ago, there’s no way she would have been appointed the Vice Leader,” Gavin said while stepping closer to Mu Ningxue.

“Three steps,” Mu Ningxue said.

“What did you say?” Gavin smiled. He added, “I’ve made sure there’s no one around. Don’t worry, it’s only us now.”

The mercenaries enjoyed gambling, but everyone who took part in the bet knew it was Gavin who had suggested the bet related to Mu Ningxue.

The more Gavin thought about how such a beautiful woman was with an insignificant young man, the more he wanted to show his manliness.

“One last step.” Mu Ningxue stared at Gavin.

“Don’t be afraid, we’ll be zero distance from one another... oh, my bad, it should be negative distance,” Gavin grinned.

Mu Ningxue’s eyes flickered with disdain. She closed her eyes as an icy glow rose from her fingers.

A lunar-white gap appeared behind Mu Ningxue, like something connected to another world. A howling gust of icicles burst out of it and knocked the shocked Gavin into the air.

The icicles stabbed into Gavin. His blood squirted out as he flew over sixty meters and slammed into a wall.

The impact shocked everyone. It felt like the roar of a powerful creature from close by.

“What just happened?”

“I heard a loud roar!”

“Colonel!”

Several mercenaries quickly followed the sound and saw Gavin lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

Gavin was as furious as a lit fuse. He was glaring at Mu Ningxue in the distance.

Mu Ningxue had already risen to her feet. Even though she was struggling to stand properly, a powerful Aura was circling her like a living beast.

“You dare attack me!” Gavin yelled.

Mu Ningxue did not respond. The man was as good as dead in her eyes. There was no point in talking to a dead man.

“Colonel, maybe we should just forget it...” Xu Luoqing advised.

“Humph, I’m in charge here!” Gavin snapped.

Xu Luoqing clearly knew what Gavin was up to. He should just bear with it since he was injured and had been discovered. Otherwise, he would not be able to explain himself once the rest of the members of the ninth team returned.

“That woman dared to attack me. What are you all waiting for? Get her!” Gavin ordered the others around him.

“Colonel, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Let’s wait until the Vice Leader is back.”

“You’re not going to listen to your colonel!?” Gavin was enraged.

They had poked Gavin’s sore point when they mentioned Kuma’s name. A blazing red flame engulfed him. He was using it to conceal his Star Constellation.

The mercenary beside Gavin suddenly spat a mouthful of green matter onto Gavin’s face as he was about to complete his Star Constellation.

“Do you want to die!?” Gavin was infuriated. He glared at the mercenary as if his eyes were set aflame.

The mercenary fell to the ground before Gavin had the chance to do anything. His body was twisted in an odd way, like he was suffering from a stroke.

A few mercenaries nearby had the same symptoms. Their noses were blocked with the same green matter. It erupted from their stomachs when they tried to wipe their noses.

Only their nose was blocked at first, but their mouths were soon clogged too. The tense atmosphere suddenly felt weird when five mercenaries were having the same symptoms.

The afflicted mercenaries all fell to the ground. Even Gavin was lost for words. Why did it feel like everyone had been poisoned all of a sudden?

“Colonel, colonel, Parker... he’s dead... my gods, what’s happening to everyone!?” Tommy came over to report something when he saw the mercenaries falling to the ground. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I...I have no idea,” Gavin was dumbfounded.

“Colonel, they are dying too,” Xu Luoqing blurted out.

“They are the ones who fell ill before!” A mercenary quickly noticed the connection between those who were having the symptoms.

“Didn’t they recover?”

—

The others who went scouting returned to the camp after receiving the news.

When they made it back to the camp, they saw over a dozen dead bodies on the ground, each with green matter pouring out of their eyes, noses, mouths, and ears.

Even Kuma was shocked. So many of her men had died so suddenly!

“It seems like only those who were ill before have died...” Warner murmured.

“You assh***, didn’t you say the Mountain Frost Lotus could treat them? Why are they all dead now!?” Kuma snarled. She almost had the urge to feed Warner to her Man-Eating Flower.

“I have no clue either! Nothing on Tianshan Mountain makes any sense!”

The mercenary group was troubled by the strange deaths. It was scarier than the sickness that had been troubling them previously. Not a single person who had fallen ill before had survived, including those with outstanding cultivation.

“By the way, Vice Leader, not one of the members on the ninth team has died,” Tommy noticed.

Kuma led her men over to the ninth team. Ai Jiangtu, Lingling, Mu Ningxue, and the others were alive, but they had yet to fully recover from the sickness.

“I need an explanation!” Kuma glanced at the ninth team coldly.

“I’ll give you one,” Mo Fan had just come back from a trip into a deep canyon, and had a hard look on his face.
