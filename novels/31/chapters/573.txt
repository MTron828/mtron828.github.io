The large Rock Barrier was crushed into pieces when the Fierce Bone Undead General slammed into it. It was obviously not sturdy enough, as the Warrior-level creature’s bones were a few times stronger than the rocks!

“Damn it, spread out, quick!” the leader immediately yelled at his team behind him when he saw that something was not right.

While giving the order, the leader slammed his hands on the ground, spreading the layer of black soil apart rapidly like a wave...

The wave helped the team to spread out as the ferocious Fierce Bone Undead General went past the team members in the middle. Long bones like horns on its shoulders suddenly left its body and flew at the scattering Magicians like huge spikes!

“My hand! My hand!” the girl wearing a hat instantly screamed.

A spike like a long spear had penetrated her arm and nailed her to the ground. Fresh blood poured out from her arm and flowed to her hand.

“Damn it, something isn’t right about this Fierce Bone Undead General!” The leader glanced at his team member and cursed in his heart.

Mu Bai was the closest to the girl. He jumped in front of the girl and grabbed the spike with his hand covered in frost. The frost rapidly spread along the spike. Not only did it freeze the spike, but it also froze the cut on the girl’s arm.

Mu Bai clenched his hand into a fist, shattering the two segments of the spike into pieces, leaving the part that had punctured the girl’s hand as it was to stop the bleeding.

The bones of a Warrior-level undead were usually poisonous. If the poison was allowed to spread to the rest of her body, not only would she lose her arm, her life would be at risk too...

“How do you feel?” Mu Bai asked the girl.

The girl’s pale face slightly recovered. She could no longer feel her arm and the wound as they were frozen. She was able to calm down after the pain disappeared, “Much better!”

Mu Bai asked the girl to stand further away. He turned around and faced the Fierce Bone Undead General. A Star Pattern was drawn adeptly under his feet. A moment later, three ice chains simultaneously appeared on his sides.

The ice chains danced wildly as they flew at the Fierce Bone Undead General. The chains quickly wrapped around the undead’s lower limbs, arms, and waist to hinder its movement.

The Fierce Bone Undead General’s strength was shocking. It forcibly broke free from the chains before the frost could even penetrate its body. The pieces of broken ice chains splintered across the place.

“Back off, I’ll let it have a piece of my Wind Disc!” yelled Jiang Li.

A strong gust containing dark streaks of energy rose like a giant black serpent and swept forward rapidly.

The strong wind slammed into the Fierce Bone Undead General’s body with great might. The creature did not dodge the attack, but opened its arms and slapped in the direction of the black gust!

The strong black gust began to twist. As the formidable force of the wind collided with the gust, the wind instantly broke down into different flurries of air and swept through the surroundings.

A few other Spells were fired at the Fierce Bone Undead General, including a blazing red Fiery Fist: Groundbreak, a purple Thunderbolt, a green Magic Vine, and the leader’s Ice Lock: Bone Husk...

Any other Warrior-level creature would be covered in wounds and bruises after receiving so many Intermediate Spells, even if it were still alive... yet as the flames, shackles of ice, and broken vines fell to the ground, the team discovered that the Fierce Bone Undead General’s bones as sturdy as steel, as if the spells were completely useless against the creature!

“What kind of defense is that!?” yelled Zhou Ming.

Skeletons were usually harder to deal with compared to zombies, as skeletons had gotten rid of the useless flesh after refining a certain amount of energy of the dead, resulting in sturdier bones. In terms of lineage, skeletons usually had a higher lineage than zombies, hence a Warrior-level skeleton was more difficult to handle than a Warrior-level zombie.

Everyone had fought against more Warrior-level zombies than Warrior-level skeletons. However, the skeleton before them was a lot trickier to deal with. They simply were clueless about how to fight it.

“Our spells are not strong enough to inflict damage to it. Let’s back off a little and think of some other plan,” said the leader decisively.

“But what happens if it gets close to the walls? It could easily break a hole in the walls with its strength!” blurted out Zhou Ming.

“Zhou Ming, watch out!”

Zhou Ming was still in the middle of speaking when the Fierce Bone Undead General suddenly drew out a sharp spike from its body and hurled it at her!

Zhou Ming did not think the Fierce Bone Undead General would still be able to attack her, given the distance between them. She was caught completely off guard. Even if she were able to summon her Shield Equipment, she could not tell if it was strong enough to defend her from the spike! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As Zhou Ming’s thoughts were frozen, a lump of black shadow suddenly appeared in front of her.

Zhou Ming flinched, discovering that Mo Fan had eerily risen from the shadow and was now standing in front of her.

“Departing Nether Shield!” Mo Fan pushed one of his arms forward.

A blue glow immediately gathered on his hand, taking the shape of a shield and quickly materializing!

The Departing Nether Shield with a blue metallic luster appeared in front of Mo Fan. The shield stuck into the ground, just tall enough to shield a human behind it.

The sharp spike collided with the shield. Its penetrative force was extremely shocking. Mo Fan’s Departing Nether Shield was considered high-quality Equipment, yet the spike managed to dig into the shield and almost penetrated it!

Mo Fan who was standing behind the shield could see the tip of the spike in front of him. His eyes totally widened.

“Damn it, you’re not the only one with spikes!”

Any strong impact would trigger the Departing Nether Shield’s counterattack.

A dark blue spike suddenly flew out from the Departing Nether Shield, which flew right at the Fierce Bone Undead General’s face in a cold flicker of light!

The Departing Nether Spike coincidentally stabbed into the Fierce Bone Undead General’s left eye and was stuck inside it...

That eye of the Fierce Bone Undead General, which was previously glowing like an LED, simply turned dim. The creature, which could not feel any pain, was not too bothered when one of its eyes went out. It simply tensed its legs and dashed ahead!
