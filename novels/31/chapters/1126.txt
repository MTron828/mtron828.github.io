Mo Fan thought Asha’ruiya would use everything she had to get her revenge since he had set her up. To his surprise, the woman actually controlled her anger and focused on the remaining members of the English team instead.

It was very easy for people to be disqualified in a mixed battle, since they might be at a disadvantage in terms of numbers, or a little mistake might provoke members of the other two teams to flank them...

More people were being disqualified from the match. Nanyu was disqualified, and not long after, Ai Jiangtu was taken out by Gamennon and Zorro.

The arrogant Gamennon was in pretty bad shape, too. He was severely injured by Zorro, and on his way back to the team to be treated by the Healer.

However, Gamennon stumbled into Mu Tingying as he was flying toward his teammates. Mu Tingying managed to trigger his Ring of Venice, meaning that Gamennon was disqualified from the match too!

Mu Tingying was the representative of the Mu Clan. Her strength was not outstanding in particular, but the resourceful Mu Clan had managed to get her a set of Ice Magic equipment.

Her boots, armor, weapon, shield, and wings were all made of a special kind of ice. The different pieces of magic Equipment were engraved with magic formations with the ability to summon thistles and thorns of ice around Mu Tingying. She suddenly looked like a thorny empress, the damage of the thorns outstanding.

Mu Tingying had done a great job conserving her strength. She had been holding onto the Set of Equipment until now, just so she could make a name for herself in the tournament. She did eliminate Gamennon, a key member of the Greek team, so the Ice Thorns and Thistles Magic Equipment Set was worth it!

The Chinese team only had a single substitute member left. Currently, Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, and Mu Tingying were the only members of the Chinese team left in the match.

As for the Greek team, they also had only three members left, but they no longer had any substitute members. Gamennon’s being knocked out of the match served as a great blow to their team.

The English team was not looking good, either. Zorro had played an important role in disqualifying Ai Jiangtu and Gamennon, but his teammates were no longer fit for battle. They basically had no chance of winning without a Healer.

Asha’ruiya was pretty cruel, too. Zorro had taken out Gamennon, but in return, Asha’ruiya had been picking on several members of the English team, putting the English team in their current state. The unbeatable Zorro was the only person left!

“It’s almost time for substitution. Nanrong Ni is our last member; we can recover some of our strength,” Mo Fan said to Mu Ningxue.

Feng Li had purposely arranged their Healer Nanrong Ni as the last member, hoping to give the team a final chance to secure the victory of the match.

“Mmm,” Mu Ningxue nodded. She did not say anything else, since she had completely fallen out with the Healer.

“If we can protect Nanrong Ni, we are going to win the match!” Mu Tingying seemed quite excited.

The match had been chaotic so far, but somehow, the Greek team and English team had suffered greater losses. The three of them only had to wait for Nanrong Ni, and they could basically eliminate the remaining members of the other two teams!

Despite the conflict between them, they had agreed to work together for now, since they were representing their country.

Nanrong Ni was sent onto the battlefield when it was time.

Nanrong Ni’s ability to defend herself was pretty weak. Her primary Element was Healing, her secondary was Plant, and her tertiary was Blessing. She would not last for long if the members of the other two teams found her first.

The three Chinese immediately searched for Nanrong Ni. Meanwhile, the English team and the Greek team were aware that the match was slowly leaning toward the Chinese team. They decisively called a truce and proceeded to search for the last participant that had just entered the match.

The other two countries no longer had any substitute members left. If the Chinese team had one more member, it would result in a huge disadvantage to them!

“If only Nanyu was here, she could immediately tell where Nanrong Ni is!” Mo Fan sighed.

The Sound Element was incredibly useful for pinpointing a person’s location. It was very effective at helping the team find their substitute members, since the battlefield was quite spacious. It was rather tricky to find a person when they were concealing their presence.

It was necessary for the substitutes to hide as soon as they entered the battlefield. There were three teams in the mixed battle. Since the location of the substitute members was randomized, it was very likely that the person would show up somewhere close to their opponents. As such, it only made sense for the incoming subs to conceal their presence while observing the surroundings to slowly regroup with the team.

The trio failed to find any trace of their member after some time. However, when they went to the other side of the woods, Mo Fan noticed that some of the roots were tangled.

“She has the Plant Element, right?” Mo Fan asked.

Mu Ningxue nodded.

“It must be here, let’s head over now. The victory is ours once she heals us!” Mu Tingying said.

The three followed the clues left by the tangled vines and saw Nanrong Ni close to the river.

Mu Tingying was overjoyed. She quickened her pace and walked toward Nanrong Ni.

“Wait,” Mu Ningxue stopped Mu Tingying, signaling her to not move any closer.

“What are we waiting for? There are four of us now!” Mu Tingying said.

“It might be a trap,” Mu Ningxue said.

“A trap? Are you being serious? Do you really think she’s going to hurt us? Mu Ningxue, you think of yourself too highly, there’s no way Nanrong Ni will think that taking you out is more important than winning the match!” Mu Tingying was amused.

“I just feel that something doesn’t seem right,” Mu Ningxue said.

“I bet you’re worried that I’m going to take all the attention away once I recover from my injuries,” Mu Tingying said.

Her ability to Summon ice thistles to cover the area within fifty meters was indeed powerful. Not only did she eliminate Gamennon, she also took out a member of the English team too!

In terms of contribution, her performance was the best so far.

However, in Mo Fan’s eyes, Mu Tingying was just lucky to stumble into a few people that were already at their limit.

“We’ll settle any dispute we have after the match. Mu Tingying, you better listen to Mu Ningxue’s warning. What if it’s actually a trap... f**k me, how stupid could she be? Why would she just go up like that!?” Mo Fan was trying to advise the woman calmly, yet she completely ignored Mu Ningxue’s warning.

“Perhaps I’m just being too worried. Should we go too?” Mu Ningxue asked Mo Fan.

Mo Fan shook his head. If it was not a trap, Mu Tingying could meet up with Nanrong Ni and bring the woman here by herself.

The two waited among the woods. Mu Tingying was seriously lacking a functioning brain, she simply walked up to Nanrong Ni without any caution.

She soon brought Nanrong Ni back. She was wearing a mocking grin when she entered the woods.

“See, nothing even happened, and you said that it was a trap!” Mu Tingying said before turning to Nanrong Ni, “Quick, heal me, the English team and Greek team are at their limits. They can no longer treat their injuries.”

Nanrong Ni nodded. She looked rather dull. She started drawing Star Patterns and combining them into a Star Constellation...

“You are using the wrong Element, it should be the Healing Element, not the Plant Element!” Mu Tingying grumbled.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue exchanged glances with one another and immediately came to a realization.

“Run, it’s a trap!” Mo Fan yelled.

Mo Fan grabbed Mu Ningxue and flung his Dark Noble Mantle. Both Mu Ningxue and he disappeared into the shadow and fled from Nanrong Ni.

Nanrong Ni’s face was blank, but her Plant Magic had already covered the area. Vines burst out of the ground and coiled around them, building a huge cage to trap Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, and Mu Tingying.

The Plant Magic emphasized a lot on preparation. The Mage had to insert the magic into the ground to spread the magic seeds. The plants would then sprout up and attack after receiving the command. Once done, the Plant Element’s damage would usually surpass the damage of other Elements!

It was quite obvious that Nanrong Ni had been preparing the trap for a long time. Even before the three had yet to regroup with her, they were already deep within the trap.

Mo Fan had reacted fairly quickly. He started running as soon as he grabbed Mu Ningxue...

He could only bring one other person with him while using the Fleeing Shadow and Dark Noble Mantle. Mu Tingying was very close to him, but he did not have enough time to bring the stupid woman along too... Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The vines grew even taller than the trees nearby, turning the whole place into a demon forest that was going to eat them all with a single bite.

Mu Tingying stood in the middle of the vines, her face filled with disbelief. She never thought Nanrong Ni would attack her teammates. They were currently in the middle of a match! She was supposed to put any personal conflicts aside. She was surely going to be in huge trouble for this!

The light above Mu Tingying was blocked off by the vines. Mu Tingying realized she could no longer escape. She stared at Nanrong Ni standing in front of her.

She finally recognized the strange look in Nanrong Ni’s eyes. They looked hollow, as if they were covered by a cloudy, gray substance...

She finally realized someone was controlling Nanrong Ni’s mind!

It was obvious that the other two teams had found Nanrong Ni first. They did not disqualify her straightaway. Instead, they controlled her mind and set up a huge trap, waiting for the Chinese team to walk right into it!

Seeing the vines surrounding her, resigned flames erupted inside her heart.

“You two were pretty quick at running; you didn’t even trust your teammate!” a flattering giggle came down from the canopy.

Mo Fan already knew Asha’ruiya was behind it without needing to guess who the person was.

However, Mo Fan was confused. How was she able to control Nanrong Ni’s mind? He did not remember Asha’ruiya being a Psychic Mage, could it be that the Greek team still had a Psychic Mage on their side?

“Let’s leave this place first. We don’t know if she has prepared another trap for us.” Mo Fan did not hesitate and brought Mu Ningxue further away from the place.

As he thought, the ground was indeed filled with deadly plants. Huge flowers that were completely still suddenly came alive. Some were hiding among the trees, tearing at anything nearby, while others were buried underground, and would drag anything that passed by into the ground...
