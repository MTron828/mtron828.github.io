Chapter 1006: The Tribes That Wage War Against One Another Because of the Slightest Conflict!

The sand dunes were basically fully stacked with the crimson poisonous scorpions. These scorpions were emitting flames, yet the flames were actually making the surrounding temperature fall. It was obvious that they were not an easy-going bunch!

“Poison Fire Scorpions; these things aren’t the friendliest creatures either!” Jiang Yu blurted out.

Both the Sandfear Foxes and the Poison Fire Scorpions had shocking numbers, and judging from their auras, they were obviously not just some weak, Servant-class creatures. Even the Warrior-level creatures that the group had seen in the wild were not as savage as the two tribes of demon creatures in the desert!

“What the heck is going on here?” Zhao Manyan immediately had a bad feeling. He kept turning his head back and forth between the two tribes of demon creatures.

“Don’t tell me they are going to flank us from both directions?” Jiang Yu said.

Jiang Shaoxu shook her head and said, “The Sandfear Foxes aren’t targeting us at all, and neither are the Poison Fire Scorpions!”

Mo Fan took a closer look and realized that the Sandfear Foxes were actually having a standoff with the Poison Fire Scorpions. In other words, the Sandfear Foxes were here to take on the Poison Fire Scorpions right from the start!

“The Sahara Desert is indeed the scariest place in the world. Even demon creatures bring their whole tribe to wage war against one another to settle a dispute.”

“It’s obvious that they are totally ignoring our existence!”

“I think we should withdraw from this place and give them some space for the war. It’s not just a pack of demon creatures on each side. It’s almost a war between two hordes!” Zhao Manyan said.

There were more than a thousand Sandfear Foxes. Jiang Yu had mentioned that these Sandfear Foxes were one of the strongest Warrior-level creatures, meaning that even ten thousand Servant-class creatures were nothing before them. The pack of Sandfear Foxes was a powerful tribe!

Similarly, the Poison Fire Scorpions were part of a powerful tribe too. Both their auras and numbers were on par with the Sandfear Foxes. The five humans standing between the two tribes of demon creatures could basically feel two auras, red and dark gray respectively, crashing into one another!

The wind startled blowing sand into the sky. The color of the sky changed gradually, with roars echoing across the place. The five humans stuck between the two tribes of demon creatures seemed utterly helpless and agitated.

Normally, the third party that was standing between two clashing forces was usually there to mediate the quarrel. Unfortunately, Mo Fan and his crew were like little worms in front of the two armies of demon creatures. They were basically going to be trampled to death once the two sides started charging at one another!

“We are caught in the middle of a tribes war. We are in a pretty bad spot, since outsiders were usually targeted by both sides in a war like this. We should move to somewhere else before the war starts. If we hesitate further, we are only going to die in vain when the two armies crash into one another!” Zhao Manyan said.

“I do agree that we are in deep trouble if we stay,” Mu Ningxue was starting to lose confidence too.

“No, not by any chance, we must not leave! I’ll distract them with the Psychic Element, so they will ignore us and just fight their enemy,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

Jiang Shaoxu stayed true to her words. They must not move inside the desert maze!

The group did not say anything further seeing how determined Jiang Shaoxu was.

Jiang Shaoxu closed her eyes and started releasing Spirit Ripple. If the Sandfear Foxes and the Poison Fire Scorpions only had eyes for their enemies, she could easily trick the demon creatures into avoiding them!

Jiang Shaoxu was just about to use her Psychic Element when her Spirit Ripple was shattered by the overwhelming murderous intent and hatred from both sides.

Jiang Shaoxu’s face turned pale. She glanced back and forth at the two sides in shock!

“What happened?” asked Mu Ningxue.

“There are too many of them. Their combined hatred is simply too strong. My Psychic Magic is being directly shattered by their strong wills!” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“What are we supposed to do then? Let’s just leave, or we’re surely going to die. It’s a war between two tribes of demon creatures; we are only going to die a horrible death if we’re stuck in between.”

“I say we hold our ground and kill both the Sandfear Foxes and Poison Fire Scorpions that dare to come to us. We’ll kill them all!” Mo Fan declared imperiously.

Knowing that a tough battle was about to take place, Mo Fan summoned the Swift Star Wolf.

As a matter of fact, with the Swift Star Wolf’s current strength, he could only take on four or five Sandfear Foxes or Poison Fire Scorpions, since he was also in the Warrior-level...

“How the heck did we even end up in this mess!? A tribe war...(sigh)!”

“I have to say, it’s my first time witnessing a war between two tribes of demon creatures. I can’t imagine how epic this is going to be. As expected of the Sahara Desert, we have already been caught in a tribe war before going deeper into the desert. Any team with members below the Advanced Level is basically going to get wiped out as soon as they step into the area!” Jiang Yu murmured.

“I feel like even Advanced Mages would have trouble staying alive.”

As they were talking, the standoff between the Sandfear Foxes and the Poison Fire Scorpions had reached its limit. The Poison Fire Scorpions were the first to launch their attacks. Poisonous red scorpions the size of sedans leapt into the air and landed heavily on the sand dunes crawling with the Sandfear Foxes, launching huge chunks of sand into the air!

“Don’t come to where we are, don’t come to where we are... damn it, I already told you not to come to us, yet you still came! Piss off!” Mo Fan raised his head and saw two Poison Fire Scorpions landing on them.

The Poison Fire Scorpions had remarkable strength, with outstanding jumping ability. It was obvious that a few of them would land on Mo Fan and his crew’s position when so many of them leapt into the air at the same time.

“Telekinesis!” Mo Fan’s eyes changed color. The sharp silver with the power to control everything hurled the two Poison Fire Scorpions that were leaping in their direction at the Sandfear Foxes.

After they landed headfirst in the sand, the two Poison Fire Scorpions rose to their feet while shaking their heads, and glared at Mo Fan.

Initially, the two Poison Fire Scorpions only regarded the humans as little creatures. They would simply roll over the insignificant little creatures, but to their surprise, these little pests were actually quite aggressive!

The Poison Fire Scorpions screeched, as if they were signaling their comrades that there were a few pests meddling in their business.

Soon, a squad of Poison Fire Scorpions started moving in their direction. It was obvious that the Poison Fire Scorpions were planning to take them out.

The squad had around eighteen Poison Fire Scorpions. Their legs were extremely powerful, plunging into the sand like machines. When they moved rapidly, they would fling the sand up into the air. Their sharp legs skittered across the place at high speed, leaving deep holes along the ground.

The sound of their rapid movement was quite intimidating. When they reached the top of the sand dune, they raised their fiery-red scorpion tails and started stabbing at the group!

The red stingers lunged forward like dark red meteors. When more than ten Poison Fire Scorpions attacked simultaneously, the Swift Star Wolf that was initially planning to show off his strength immediately hid behind Mo Fan.

The attacks were not something that the Swift Star Wolf could take head-on. After all, there were a dozen Poison Fire Scorpions around his level!

“My turn!” Zhao Manyan stepped forward. He was an expert when it came to using the Light Protection.

Four Ramparts appeared and surrounded the team. The runes from Zhao Manyan’s Light Seed and the effects of the wooden clapper further enhanced the defense of Zhao Manyan’s Intermediate Spell. The dark red meteors landed on the ramparts. Even though the stingers were stuck to the surface, they failed to penetrate the thick defense! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The attacks from the Poison Fire Scorpions were not that simple. They opened their mouths and started breathing out poisonous flames.

The flames set the top of the sand dune on fire. The flames surprisingly had no heat; they were not scorching, but had a bone-chilling iciness instead!

“What kind of fire is this? It’s so cold!”

“It seems like Water Spells aren’t really effective against them!”

“How is water going to help against fire with no heat? Use light instead!”

“What light? I’ll go and take them out. Stay in your formation, try not to move from your positions!” Mo Fan was as hot-tempered as usual.

He did not care if they were spitting out flames with no heat. Couldn’t he just take them all out instead?

Mo Fan leapt into the air. When he reached the highest point, a bolt of purple-black lightning surged through his body. Mo Fan dove fiercely from the sky, together with the lightning. He landed with a stomp, creating a huge electric field with lightning arcs surging around two of the Poison Fire Scorpions.

The lightning paralyzed the creatures, before following up with a puncturing bolt. The lightning arcs swept past the two Poison Fire Scorpions under Mo Fan’s control, penetrating their crimson shells!

The two Poison Fire Scorpions fell to the ground with black smoke rising into the air. Mo Fan did not cast an extra glance at them. He was about to proceed and take out the rest of the Poison Fire Scorpions, but he was surprised when he discovered that the two ‘dead’ Poison Fire Scorpions had disappeared, leaving two holes behind them!

“Not dead yet?” Mo Fan was dazzled. The vitality of these Poison Fire Scorpions had exceeded his imagination. Normally, he did not need to rely on Advanced Spells when fighting against Warrior-level creatures. A four-tier Lightning Strike and some other Lightning Spells were more than enough to kill a Warrior-level creature instantly!

“Mo Fan, look out below you!” Mu Ningxue screamed at him.

Mo Fan lowered his head and saw the sand below his feet vibrating. He glanced around himself and saw an area of quicksand over ten meters wide forming around him. The moving sand was pushing him to the center of the pit, where the two scorched Poison Fire Scorpions were opening their mouths wide, waiting for Mo Fan like a giant spider waiting for its prey on a spiderweb!

Mo Fan frowned. He had not expected the Poison Fire Scorpions to be able to counterattack after receiving his attack directly!

If just two of the Poison Fire Scorpions were so tricky to deal with, their group might actually have a problem staying alive in the middle of such a chaotic battle between two tribes of demon creatures!
