Chapter 2727: Brother, You’re a Dragon Among Men

Mo Fan was a little disappointed. He had expected a fight. In fact, a fight would have given him an opportunity to understand and make use of the Mighty Cliff Demon King’s ability. Who would have thought Boss Jin would be so self-conscious?

Mo Fan knew he had exposed himself. He usually kept a very low profile. But he had revealed something from his words. He acted like an ordinary Super Level young mage. But he exuded an imposing aura even then and Boss Jin had taken the hint.

Mo Fan knew that it wouldn’t always work. He couldn’t choose to flee whenever he encountered somebody like Boss Jin every time.

But sometimes, Mo Fan had no choice.

He was like a rich man who chose to act like a common man when courting a common girl so that his wealth would not come between their true love. He would tell her that he only had a 140-square-foot house in the city. In the end, he would look like any ordinary poor man.

As a Super Level Summoning Element mage, Mo Fan had summoned the Mighty Cliff Demon King but he had yet to demonstrate his strongest ability. But it was still a bonus to have scared off people with his present power.

“I never expected you to be so powerful. You can even summon ruler-level beasts! Are all seven-star hunter masters this strong?” Shu Xiaohua stared at the Mighty Cliff Demon King in awe. She looked eager to play with it.

“Not all. I am the strongest among them,” Mo Fan said. He felt refreshed and happy at that moment so he blurted out the words.

“They haven’t left Mingwu Ancient City yet. Maybe they have other plans. We still have to be very careful,” said Big Sister Ruan in worry.

“How long will it take for your elders to arrive?” Mo Fan asked.

“They are already on their way. They will be here very soon.”

...

Mo Fan sat next to the Thundercat statue and relaxed. He felt very bored after a while. He decided to try fusion magic.

......

Fusion magic enabled different magic to fuse together. He wondered if he could fuse other elements with the Summoning element.

‘Which element is the best to fuse with the Summoning element?’ Mo Fan speculated.

If the Summoning element was fused with the Fire element, would the summoning creature be directional? Could he summon a certain ancient flaming elf from the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower?

If, instead, he fused it with the Lightning element, would he be able to summon a powerful creature with lightning power?

The Thousand Tribe Elf Tower embraced randomness. There was always a possibility of failing to summon the beasts. The beasts with the greatest strength remained on top of the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower, while the Mighty Cliff Demon King was regarded as a creature with the lowest strength among them. The higher the beasts were on the tower, the more difficult it was to summon them.

Mo Fan was not particularly powerful in his summoning element. A high level of spiritual force could increase Mo Fan’s success rate in summoning a beast. If he wanted to summon a stronger ancient beast from the ancient magic portal, he would have to continue to upgrade his Super Level Summoning element.

His level of cultivation was the determining factor in summoning any kind of beasts. He wondered

what would happen if he fused Fire with Lightning elements?

He had many questions. If he fused, would the summoning verdict randomly select ancient beast based on the Summoning element? Or, would it summon Lightning or Fire elemental beasts? Or, would the beast be a combination of both the elements?

Mo Fan decided to just give it a try. He crouched down. He put on his fusion gloves and began to use the Lightning element with his left hand, while he used his other hand to open a dimensional ancient magic portal.

Mo Fan was a little excited. No one had ever mastered fusion magic therefore there was no one he could look up to. If he succeeded, this would mean that he could summon stronger and unique ancient beasts from the Wan Dragon Valley or Mound of the Dead Beast as a Super Level Summoning element novice mage!

...

Inside the banana grove, several blue-clad men approached the Golden Sea Hunter Group. They looked solemn but their gazes were razor-sharp.

“Brother, that’s the kid. He is a Summoning element mage. He summoned an ancient rock elf – Mighty Cliff Demon King,” said Boss Jin as he pushed the banana leaves aside and pointed at Mo Fan, who was sitting on the ground.

“How dare the young man act so arrogantly?!” said Hai Huodao.

Most hunter groups who were active in the Fujian area were aware of the Golden Sea Hunter Group. Boss Jin was especially notorious for his sneaky plots and tricks. Meanwhile, Hai Huodao was a man who believed in solving issues by brute force. He was known for his ruthlessness.

Hai Huodao had a few men with him. They weren’t inferior to Boss Jin in strength.

“He must have been bewitched by the ladies from Licheng Afterglow Island. He suddenly became arrogant.” Boss Jin snorted.

“The ladies from Licheng Afterglow Island?” Hai Huodao frowned.

“Don’t worry about them. It seems they were just here for their training. We haven’t seen their elders here,” said Boss Jin.

“Even if

they are here, we have no reason to be afraid of them.”

“Let’s go Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

and take down that kid!”

...

Hai Huodao led the way. The blue-clad hunters were quiet. In contrast, Boss Jin’s men were very talkative. Some of them passed inappropriate remarks against the ladies from Licheng Afterglow Island and laughed.

“Kid, we meet again…” Boss Jin approached Mo Fan with a spiteful look.

However, before Boss Jin could complete his words, he saw a ferocious creature made up of lightning just behind Mo Fan.

The violent lightning element creature was about as large as the Mighty Cliff Demon King. But it was only half a meter taller than an average human.

Its head constantly flashed with a purple lightning crown. Its lightning-like face revealed unemotional eyes. It was draped with a cloak from shoulders to ankle, looking like a European pope standing upright.

“It’s R-Raiju!”

The Thousand Tribe Elf Tower was an ancient tower that towered to the highest point of the vault of heaven. The air in the highest point of the vault of heaven was extremely turbulent, and that the lightning of the vault of heaven was the most turbulent of all.

Raiju was an ancient element created in the highest point of the vault of heaven. Its lightning served as a forbidden warning that killed those creatures which had no right to join the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower. Its lightning struck any wandering creature onto the cliff, and the creature died because of a fatal blow.

Hai Huodao was also a Summoning element mage. He had some understanding of how the ancient magic portal worked.

The pope-like Raiju stood beside the young man, giving off an intimidating aura than even most ancestor-level creatures!

“Boss Jin, why are you here again? Are you still annoyed by what happened then?” asked Mo Fan with a sweet smile.

He had been so focused on opening the ancient magical portal that he had missed the arrival of Boss Jin and his men. This time, Boss Jin did not have a large group of hunters with him. Instead, he had fewer men with very high level of cultivation.

Boss Jin was at a loss for words. He glanced at Hai Huodao.

Before this, Hai Huodao intended to confront Mo Fan without any mercy. But after seeing this, he had a sudden change in attitude.

“Why would we be annoyed at you over such a trivial matter?” he said with a radiant smile. “I heard from Brother Jin that you are an outstanding Summoning element mage. So, I had to meet you personally. Brother, you look very spirited for someone so young. You are a dragon among men!”
