3054 Can I Order Some Takeaway?

No matter how powerful Holy Shadow Simmons’ God’s gift was, it was difficult for him to restore the area to its original appearance.

Even if the lake water flowed back from the cracks in the ground, it was still mixed with black soil.

Even if the broken trees were connected, the rotting leaves would not return to the branches.

Many little creatures lived in this lake forest, including forest deer drinking water by the lake, fish swimming in the lake, and colorful birds soaring above. There was no way Holy Shadow Simmons could bring these little creatures to life.

No matter how hard Holy Shadow Simmons tried to restore the area, Mu Ningxue could not be satisfied.

“D-Don’t kill me. I was just following orders. Clark was the agent. It was his fault that he died, but the Holy Shadow would definitely pursue it. I know you are not afraid of the Holy Shadow Organization, but they will bring you a lot of trouble. I can help you get rid of them, but only if I am alive.” Holy Shadow Simmons stood there. His body was trembling slightly, but his desire to survive was still quite strong.

He did not know who Mu Ningxue was, and he did not know why Clark wanted to arrest her. He was just assisting Clark in dealing with this matter. He never thought that this would lead to a fatal disaster!

“Did I say I wanted to kill you?” Mu Ningxue asked.

Holy Shadow Simmons was even more confused after hearing this.

‘Oh lord, your tiger’s front teeth are about to hit my face. How many people in this world can survive from the mouth of an emperor-level sacred beast at such a distance?’

“I know you must be most worried about the Holy Shadow. I can—” Holy Shadow Simmons felt he was no different from a dead person. He had to let Mu Ningxue know he had a way to get Mu Ningxue out of the Holy Shadow.

“You can leave now.”

“No, I mean it! Other holy shadows may be bound, but I can keep you safe and sound. The Holy Shadow Organization is scary. Clark and I are just two helpers of the Holy Shadow Organization. If you want to survive in this world, you must get rid of the Holy Shadow Organization. I can help you. You can trust me.” Holy Shadow Simmons was even more anxious.

He searched for everything he could think of in his mind. He had to let Mu Ningxue know that he just wanted to protect himself and did not mean to harm her.

Holy Shadow Simmons continued talking. He was afraid to turn his head for fear that the emperor-level white tiger would bite him.

However, Mu Ningxue and the white tiger had left.

Holy Shadow Simmons stood on the highway bridge. There was no threat around him, but he was desperately looking for his value while being anxious and terrified. However, the silver-haired woman did not care about his determination to survive.

All that was left were destroyed mountains, forests, and lakes, a road bridge, and a Holy Shadow Mage whose legs were still shaking.

When Holy Shadow Simmons realized he had been spared, he was exhausted.

‘I survived…

‘She didn’t kill me.

‘But I’m a Holy Shadow!

‘I represent the most brutal execution organization in Holy City. In other words, a normal person would kill me too so that the Holy Shadow Organization won’t know what happened here in a short time.’

This was why Holy Shadow Simmons tried so hard to convince Mu Ningxue. It was because Holy Shadow Simmons knew that once Mu Ningxue killed Clark, she would kill him as well.

‘She really let me go?

‘Isn’t she afraid I’ll go back to Holy City and tell the Holy Shadow Organization about her killing Clark?

‘What an incomprehensible and terrifying woman!’

…

In a secluded orphanage overgrown with weeds in Holy City, a bearded young man with short hair was sitting inside. He seemed worried about something, but overall, he looked calm.

The courtyard was very simple, which was a bit out of tune with the nobility of the Holy Palace.

There was only one exit in the courtyard. The distant sky was visible from other places, but the Forbidden System blocked it. When the light shone near here, honeycomb-shaped light beams appeared slightly in the air. But when people walked over and forcibly tried to tear it apart, it would immediately cause a powerful energy backlash.

The exit faced the Holy Palace and was close to the residence of Archangel Michael. Along the way, there was also the main hall of the Holy Judgment Court, the Angel Guard, and the Holy City Mage. It was impossible to escape from this place.

But there was no need for those locked in this remote courtyard to escape. Mo Fan was on bail in Holy City. As long as he was in Holy City, Holy City would not restrict his freedom. However, he had to return to this courtyard to sleep on time every day. He had a curfew.

“Is he practicing?” Archangel Ramiel asked the guard outside the courtyard.

“Yes, he has been practicing.” The guard was a Holy Shadow. His face was hidden in the dark golden robe.

“Tell him that he can’t freely enter and exit Holy City anymore. From today onwards, he can’t leave this courtyard without interrogation,” Archangel Ramiel said.

“But he hasn’t left here since a month ago,” said Brooke, the Holy Shadow in charge of the guard.

“Do you think these two are the same?” Archangel Ramiel angrily said.

Whether he went out or not was his business. Holy City’s restriction of his freedom is the execution of Holy City’s authority!

“I get it,” Holy Shadow Brooke lowered his head and answered.

“Didn’t he recite the divine oath and get his magic banned? Why is he still able to practice? Is there anything unusual about his cultivation process?” Archangel Ramiel asked with concern while staring at Mo Fan in the courtyard.

“Oh, he doesn’t have any magical aura emanating from him. What he can do is play with the Star Sons and get familiar with the connection of magic. He can’t carry out other practices. Besides, our courtyard is equipped with a magic vacuum. Even if he is a tenacious seed, he can’t grow in the soil without nutrients,” said Holy Shadow Brooke.

“That’s good. Keep an eye on his condition 24/7 and report to me immediately if there is any unusual aura,” said Archangel Ramiel.

“Got it!”

In the courtyard, the person who seemed to be meditating all this time finally opened his eyes. His dark brown eyes stared at Archangel Ramiel on the pathway of the courtyard.

“Mo Fan, after the collection and identification of criminal evidence, your freedom has been deprived starting from today,” Archangel Ramiel deliberately repeated so that Mo Fan could hear it.

“I can at least order takeaway, right?” Mo Fan asked.

“That’s not allowed!”

“Okay, you can deliver it to me. I want a meat lover’s pizza, a glass of lemon cola, and two extra special hot sauces. Oh, I want extra ice for the cola.”

“Who do you think I am?” Archangel Ramiel was angry. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Did Mo Fan want the Archangel of Holy City to be his delivery boy?
