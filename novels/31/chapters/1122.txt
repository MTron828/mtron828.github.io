Mo Fan slashed, and a burning scar over a hundred meters long was left behind, as if it was trying to intercept the river at the center of the battlefield.

Hilton was right beside it with a blank face. He was lucky, and used his magic Boots in the nick of time to dodge the slash. Otherwise, he could not tell how he would have ended up.

However, Hilton was not relieved for long, as he saw the giant, burning sword had not disappeared. Mo Fan was still holding it in his hands.

Hilton had an urge to burst out in tears, and fled instantly. He did not dare face Mo Fan at all!

Mo Fan glanced at the fiery sword in his hands in astonishment.

It turned out that Asha’ruiya’s blessing not only improved the fiery sword’s damage by fifty percent, it also increased the sword’s duration!

The fiery sword was made of energy. Mo Fan slashed horizontally when he saw Hilton trying to run away.

The tongues of fire sweeping across the place as the twenty-meters-long fiery sword was swung horizontally were absolutely shocking. No matter how fast Hilton ran, he had no chance of escaping from the flames. He was devoured by the flames and knocked flying by the force.

“Blink!” Asha’ruiya was seriously going to extremes. Her eyes emitted a sacred silver light as she directed the energy toward where Hilton was falling in the distance.

Hilton fell to the ground with the remaining flames. His armor was heavily damaged. He rose to his feet quickly, and seemed to be in fairly good condition still. He was planning to adjust himself to face his opponents when he realized Mo Fan was standing right in front of him!

Hilton saw that he had been surrounded by a silver aura. His slightly swollen face contorted instantly!

Mo Fan was grinning like a devil. He clenched his left hand into a claw, seething lightning crackling between his fingers wildly.

Hilton had been teleported back here right after he was knocked flying. He suddenly felt like he was a human punching bag swinging back to its original position. He was ranked seventh among the participants, yet Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya were about to drive him nuts!

“Sky Lightning Claw!”

“Blessing: Strengthen!”

The Sky Lightning Claw already had outstanding damage, yet Asha’ruiya did not hesitate to strengthen it even further. Even though it had only raised the spell’s damage by thirty percent, it was currently eight times the damage of a normal Lightning Spell!

The lightning danced wildly. Hilton used all the defensive Equipment he had to protect himself, yet he was soon covered in wounds and bruises; the lightning was too capable of penetrating his defense!

“Zorro, hurry up and save me!”

Hilton struggled in the lightning. He was pretty strong among the participants. Any other so-called all-star participant would have been blasted beyond recognition by now.

Hilton was screaming in a certain direction. Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya noticed that Zorro was flying toward them with four white Wind Wings on his back. For some reason, his speed was rather slow. He only sped up significantly as he was approaching them.

“I’ll handle him.” Asha’ruiya quickly flew into the air. The illusionary wings on her back allowed her to fly nimbly.

Asha’ruiya and Zorro met in the air. Zorro glanced at his teammates that were struggling to hold their grounds and snapped furiously, “You cunning little b**ch!”

“Bye!” Asha’ruiya’s bracelet emitted a silver glow once again. It quickly turned into tiny strings flying at Zorro.

Zorro immediately panicked. He beat his wings and flew away, not daring to waste his time talking to Asha’ruiya.

The silver strings intertwined around Zorro and formed a Space formation once again!

Zorro’s strength was indeed shocking. He almost escaped from Asha’ruiya’s inescapable magic formation. Unfortunately, he had come all the way back to save the day, but he was once again teleported to some corner of the battlefield. The strong Time Stasis was even slowing down him and delaying his return!

“Zo...Zorro...” The hope on Hilton’s face turned into despair once again.

Mo Fan the violent came up to him once again. Hilton did not even bother struggling. The Greek team was clearly more aggressive when fighting them than when they fought the Chinese team!

In the end, a blue glow appeared and formed a barrier around Hilton to protect him.

Hilton had a blank face. Even when the assistant judge was escorting him away, he seemed like he no longer had nothing left to live for.

The man that was ranked seventh in the tournament was aiming to conquer the world handsomely, but ended up being knocked out in such a miserable manner. Hilton could only place his hopes on his teammates, hoping that they could overcome the difficult situation.

“I initially thought we could take him out right away, but we ended up wasting so much time on him,” Mo Fan glanced into the distance and saw Zorro frantically making his way back again.

Their second attempt was not as effective as the first. Zorro was able to return much more quickly. So far, Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya had worked together to eliminate Hilton. However, the rest of their teams were using all they had to eliminate the members of the English team too, so they would not be able to recover from the damage they had suffered!

Ai Jiangtu and Karolina took out Herbert.

Mu Ningxue and Nanyu continued to pressure Ayleen, and were about to take her out, too.

Mu Tingying and the other two members of the Greek team successfully eliminated a member of the English team as well.

There was not much time, yet the Greek team and the Chinese team had given their best, none of them willing to let England win.

The Chinese team had to admit that the Greek team’s Blessing Element was very effective in a team battle. If the Greek and English teams had insisted on knocking out the Chinese team, it was very likely that the Chinese team would not have had any chance to turn the tables.

The members of the Chinese team were quite relieved that the English team did not give their best at the start of the match, as they were planning to benefit from the situation as a third party. To their surprise, the two weaker teams had decided to team up and inflict serious damage on the English team!

“There isn’t enough time for us to eliminate Ayleen,” Nanyu glanced at the Great Duchess and was quite impressed by the fact that she could still hold her ground under the circumstances.

“Zorro is back...”

“Only two of them are left, we can easily crush them. There are still two minutes until their substitute members can join the match. Let’s eliminate them now!” Mu Tingying exclaimed excitedly.

Three members of the English team had been knocked out. It was actually quite a surprise to them. Wouldn’t it be very easy for the nine of them to take out Ayleen, who was almost at her limit, and the so-called strongest participant of the tournament, Zorro?

The others shared the same thought as Mu Tingying. The group of nine swiftly surrounded Ayleen.

Ayleen glanced at the approaching Zorro and said helplessly, “Zorro, don’t bother! You can easily drag the match further with your Wind Element and wait for our substitute members!”

Zorro glanced down from the air. He did not run even when there were nine people waiting for him. He landed in front of Ayleen.

The look in his eyes was no longer as indifferent as it was before. He had a stern face, and the strong winds blowing around him had formed a Domain.

“Ayleen, just keep an eye on their Psychic attacks, leave the rest to me!” Zorro said calmly, like the lull before a great storm!

“Zorro, you’re too full of yourself!” Gamennon of the Greek team shouted.

Gamennon used to be the captain of the Greek team. He had kept a low profile throughout the tournament and did not expose much of his strength, yet every time he clashed with Zorro, he seemed to be very aggressive and discontented with the man.

It turned out that Gamennon and Zorro had been rivals for a long time!

“Enough, let’s take them out as quickly as possible!” Asha’ruiya reminded Nanyu, “Remember, don’t let Asha’ruiya use her Equipment!”

Nanyu still remembered her role. She continued to watch Ayleen closely.

Activating a piece of powerful magic Equipment required a certain amount of time to prepare it. As such, as long as Nanyu was there to interrupt the process, she had no chance of summoning the illusion of the shark emperor without her teammates providing cover for her!

—

Zorro was obviously the greatest threat in the match. The two teams insisted on taking him out first.

The impatient Mu Tingying and Karolina were the first to attack Zorro.

As soon as they made their moves, two Summoned Beasts dashed out from the woods. One was the beast that Zorro had summoned with Dimensional Summoning, a Noble Eagle. It flew out from the canopy and lunged at Mu Tingying as she was about to finish her spell. It lifted Mu Tingying into the air and held her with its beak like she was a little chick before the others could react.

Mu Tingying reacted quickly, protecting herself with ice. However, the creature continued to lift her higher into the air. The enraged woman immediately focused her attacks on the Noble Eagle instead.

The other Summoned Beast was an enormous Underground Demonic Worm. It turned out that Zorro had arranged for the beast to hide under the ground long ago. As soon as Karolina started using her magic, the ground she was standing on immediately cracked open as the beast dragged her deep into the hole! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Both the Noble Eagle and the Underground Demonic Worm were Zorro’s trump cards. He had used the two Summoned Beasts to defeat all his opponents during the tournament. The Noble Eagle was no weaker than Teenage Flame Belle, and the Underground Demonic Worm was even stronger. It was most likely an average Commander-level creature!

“Karolina!” Gamennon panicked when he saw his teammate being dragged into the ground.

“Don’t worry, she can look after herself. We have to eliminate Zorro first!” Asha’ruiya warned him.

Time was of the essence. If they allowed Zorro to drag on the battle, their substitute members would soon enter the match. Once the English team sent in their elites, all their efforts so far would be in vain!

Zorro did not stand down even when he was surrounded by seven people. The will to fight in his eyes was like that of a savage beast; he was nothing other than a battle maniac!
