“fiery swamp!”

mo fan slammed his fist onto the ground, setting it on fire and forming a swamp of raging flames ahead of him!

he then fixed his eyes on the fiery-winged tyrant!

the creature’s speed was insanely high. mo fan knew he would most likely end up in the creature’s beak if he waited until the creature was within range before setting up his fire domain!

“rise!” mo fan roared. he swung his other fist at the sky in an uppercut!

an enormous fiery dragon rose from the swamp of flames. it went right at the fiery-winged ruler flying close to the ground.

the massive dragon of fire contained remarkable power. its scattering flames were strong enough to burn everything within five hundred meters to ashes. even though mo fan had thrown the fiery dragon punch slightly early, it still collided with the fiery-winged tyrant!

the fiery dragon rose in an unstoppable manner, the howls of its flames sounding like the roars of a dragon. it was the strongest attack that mo fan had learned with little flame belle’s strength while he spending almost half a year recovering at the parthenon temple. it required some time to channel and its range was very limited, but it could easily kill a commander-level creature once it landed on the target!

the fiery-winged tyrant had obviously underestimated its opponents. it never thought a mere human whose aura was a whole level weaker than it could throw such a terrifying fiery punch. the rising dragon forcibly knocked it into the air. it started spinning after losing its balance, while the raging flames devoured it.

the eyes of mui guangqing and the others almost popped out of their sockets when they saw the rising dragon punch!

zhao manyan’s attempt to defend the team from the ruler-level creature’s attack was already shocking, but mo fan was even crazier. he managed to knock the fiery-winged tyrant into the sky! they were struggling to imagine how the imperious fiery dragon rising from the swamp was unleashed by a weak, feeble mage. how reckless and wild was this guy!?

the fiery-winged tyrant was infuriated. its dignity as a ruler-level creature was greatly shaken after failing its attacks twice in a row.

the fiery dragon had inflicted minor injuries on the creature, but they were nowhere enough to weaken it. it forcibly twisted its body in the sky and used its wings to stabilize itself. its imperious aura extinguished the flames of the ardent sunset and the calamity fire. it raised its head and exhaled an overwhelming breath at mo fan!

the exhalation was mixed with scorching flames that could easily burn anyone into ashes. mo fan clearly had no chance of enduring it...

mo fan was utterly shocked too. he initially thought his attack would knock the creature further away to buy him some time. he did not expect the creature to recover so quickly!

it was a ruler-level creature, after all. even his strongest attack would only result in a negligible outcome!

“blink!” mo fan was no idiot. he had used all his might to slightly shove this guy away, but the guy’s single slap in reaction to his shove was enough to break all his bones to pieces. he was clearly not on the same level as this creature. he should be running for his life after he managed to take advantage of the creature by luck!

mo fan could teleport at most two hundred and seventy meters away with blink. it was the furthest distance he could cover by drawing a silver star constellation, and only when he was using the spell on himself!

mo fan escaped from the range of the fiery-winged tyrant’s breath with a single cast of blink. unfortunately, the tyrant’s breath was not so easy to dodge. the creature merely moved its head to redirect the strong blast at mo fan. as it shifted its head, the terrifying force of the breath tore a huge path across the ground. the gouge spread rapidly in mo fan’s direction!

“dongfang linlin, help!” mo fan yelled at dongfang linlin.

the strong wind was approaching too quickly. mo fan needed time to construct the star constellation to cast blink. he was still within the range of the creature’s breath, as he had moved less than three hundred meters away.

mo fan was well aware of the strength of a ruler-level creature. they could easily bring utter destruction upon an area for five hundred meters around them, and up to a kilometer with some of their moves.

mo fan was already fleeing at his quickest pace. he finally caught up to dongfang linlin.

luckily, dongfang linlin was a very smart and collected woman under the pressure. as a space mage, she already knew what mo fan was up to when she saw mo fan running at her. he was planning to use her blink to run away from the creature, like a relay race!

dongfang linlin had constructed the silver star constellation in advance. she timed the spell perfectly. the moment mo fan caught up to her, the star constellation flickered. they both vanished into thin air, leaving a trail of crystalline dust in the air.

the deadly breath poured down from the sky before the crystalline dust dissipated, leaving a terrifyingly long and deep ravine across the sturdy ground!

“not bad, two hundred meters!” mo fan complimented when he realized he had reappeared two hundred meters away. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

the first-tier blink was only usable on a single person. the more adept the space mage and the higher their mental strength, the greater the maximum distance they could cover with a single cast. mo fan was only able to blink a hundred meters away when he first learned the spell.

after reaching the second-tier, he could blink through obstacles, as long as the space was not completely sealed up. he could also teleport others within the star constellation with him, but the higher the number of people and the greater the area the objects he was trying to teleport occupied, the shorter the distance he would be able to cover.

in mo fan’s case, when he was casting blink on himself, the maximum distance he could travel was between two hundred and fifty to three hundred meters. if there were two people, the distance would shrink to between a hundred fifty to two hundred meters. dongfang linlin had managed to teleport them two hundred meters away, her space element was obviously on par with his. the volunteers of the two renowned clans were indeed very impressive!

the two hundred meters was extremely important. otherwise, he would have had no chance of escaping the range of the ruler-level creature’s attack.

even so, they immediately ran as fast as they could after they teleported away from the attack. mui guangqing was smart enough to leave a wind track behind to boost their speed while their blink was on cooldown!

it was such a close call!

the two space mages had barely escaped the ruler-level creature’s breath attack. if mo fan had not knocked the creature far enough away, he would have had no chance of escaping from the attack. he was still too weak to take on a ruler-level creature. he might be able to stay alive for now, but the countdown of death was already ticking!

“why isn’t old mo here yet? is he trying to set us up!?” mo fan yelled.

“he’s there!” mui guangqing finally saw dongfang mo, but the man was still around two kilometers away. the fiery-winged tyrant was too angry to even care about dongfang mo.

“we are running out of room ahead. we are doomed!” zhao manyan shouted.

“it’s coming. we are done for, this is the end...”

“can anyone hold it back briefly? do it now.”

“we’ve already tried our best. there’s nothing we can do!”

“blink, hurry up and use blink...”

“blink my ass, it would only teleport us into the lava!”
