Mo Fan could feel an extreme heat wave coming from the direction of the cry. He turned around and saw the Fiery Sorceress floating among the Fire Cloud Trees around a few hundred meters away.

She was roaring furiously at the three-headed snake that wanted to snap up and devour Mo Fan. The aura from her fiery figure swept the red leaves into the air!

She was floating in the air, the flames in the outer layer of her body were flapping in the wind too, like a blazing red, noble gown, setting her off like an empress who was born in burning lava. Her sanctity and unmatched dignified bearing were enough to force all creatures in the area to submit to her in fear!

Mo Fan stared at her in astonishment. Just a moment ago, he was assuming the Fiery Sorceress to be a gentle lady, yet the overwhelming aura she was unleashing had allowed Mo Fan to have a different view of her!

The three-headed snake was a dangerous creature, yet it did not dare to move any closer to Mo Fan when facing the Fiery Sorceress’ wrath.

The three-headed snake was utterly terrified. It turned around, its heads seemed to have conflicting ideas on which direction to flee in as it crawled away in panic.

In less than a few seconds, the three-headed snake fled into the Fire Cloud Woods on the hill.

Mo Fan thought that was the end of it, but to his surprise, the packs of Fire Cloud Sparrows in the woods were frightened and flew away into the distance, while the creatures that resided in the woods ran in the opposite direction too!

Mo Fan was dumbfounded.

He initially thought the Fiery Sorceress was a special human-like creature, who could understand human’s tongue after being around for many years, allowing her to develop her intelligence. Little did he know, her lineage was extremely noble, like the ruler of the North Burning Valley!

The three-headed snake, and the packs of Fire Cloud Sparrows that flew away... those were not just some petty Servant-class creatures!

The Fiery Sorceress’ intimidating presence slowly withdrew after a long time. However, it was impossible to tell how long would it take for the Fire Cloud Woods to return to normal.

The Fiery Sorceress slowly floated toward Mo Fan from the distance. As she arrived before him, she had recovered her usual friendliness, which was something that Mo Fan could not understand. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It’s obvious that the Fiery Sorceress was a very powerful creature, but why was she so friendly toward humans?

Mo Fan believed that she was furious at the three-headed snake for trying to eat him.

“Tha...thanks,” blurted out Mo Fan some time later, still in a shock as he glanced at the Fiery Sorceress.

The blurry face of the Fiery Sorceress wore a seemingly apologetic smile, as if she were asking if Mo Fan was hurt.

Mo Fan was perfectly unharmed. It was just that he almost suffocated due to her overwhelming presence.

Mo Fan changed the topic when he saw her holding something cautiously in her hands, “What’s that? Something for me to eat?”

The Fiery Sorceress pulled a long face when she heard the question.

Mo Fan felt awkward, feeling that he had picked the wrong words.

The Fiery Sorceress was holding a transparent fruit in her hands. Both its luster and the pleasant scent were a good indication that the fruit was of superior quality compared to the Fire Cloud Fruit.

“Could this be the Fire Calamity Fruit?” asked Mo Fan randomly.

The Fiery Sorceress hesitated for a while, before nodding to him.

Mo Fan almost dropped his jaw to the ground when he saw her nod!

Damn, he was simply asking thoughtlessly...

Is...is this really the priceless Fire Calamity Fruit that Chen Yi mentioned?

The group could not find it despite searching for it desperately, and here it was right in front of him. Mo Fan was left utterly speechless.

However, he could not tell if he should be happy or sad. He had found the Fire Calamity Fruit, but the thing was obviously precious to the Fiery Sorceress. She might be friendly toward humans, but there was no way she would give it to him.

Besides, the Fiery Sorceress had displayed her ruler-like strength just a moment ago. It was impossible to try and take the Fire Calamity Fruit from her.

“Since you’ve saved my life, I’ll be honest with you. This Fire Calamity Fruit is extremely valuable to us humans, and I believe many of them are making their way here to the Burning Valley to look for it. If this thing is really important for you, you should keep it safe. I know you’re friendly toward humans, but not every human is honest and has a good conscience like me,” said Mo Fan to the Fiery Sorceress.

After all, the Fiery Sorceress had saved his life, thus he was not planning to do something ungrateful. He could tell that the Fiery Sorceress was protecting the Fire Calamity Fruit carefully.

The Fiery Sorceress nodded. She asked about Mo Fan’s condition.

Mo Fan could move around normally, but he had no idea how long it would take to recover from the internal injuries.

The Fiery Sorceress told Mo Fan that the place was not safe, and asked Mo Fan to go with her.

Mo Fan had nowhere to go, and did not have the ability to protect himself either. He had no choice but to follow the Fiery Sorceress.

The Fiery Sorceress led Mo Fan past the dense woods. The woods seemed quite spacious, but since it was on top of a hill, it did not take a long time for them to cross it.

As they approached the edge of the Fire Cloud Woods, they arrived at a slightly uplifted area. The slope was rather gentle, and at the top stood a giant tree, different from the Fire Cloud Trees.

The tree did not have any leaves, the main branches were twisting and winding among one another, forking into lots of twigs. Even without leaves, it looked quite astonishing.

The giant tree stood alone under the starry sky. Its trunks were reaching towards the curtain of night, while the branches were spreading in all directions. From Mo Fan’s angle as he looked upward at the tree, he could see the stars between the gaps of the branches and twigs, as if the tree was topped with brilliant stars. It felt like his heart was being cleansed by the stellar view.

The tree was standing alone on the top of a hill in the Burning Valley. Even though countless Hunters had visited the North Burning Valley, none of them would have thought that such a wonder would exist in this place. It could be described as a miracle in the desert!

Mo Fan followed the Fiery Sorceress to the tree. The Fiery Sorceress slowly placed the Fire Calamity Fruit back into the branches. The fruit was already dazzling to begin with, but it was more stunning surrounded by the stars.

“Is this place where the Fire Calamity Fruit was born?” Mo Fan asked thoughtlessly once again.
