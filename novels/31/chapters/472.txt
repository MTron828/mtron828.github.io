“Maybe they donn’t even realize that they have cleared almost every White Sand Giant in the area...” Chen Yi was still immersed in shock, staring at the battlefield in disbelief.

The battle had lasted for quite some time, and her help was no longer needed. She believed that her joining the battle would not make any difference, either.

The trio learned how to better utilize each other’s strengths as the battle continued, resulting in better teamwork. In the beginning, they had to slowly fight their way out of the surrounding White Sand Giants. However, it felt like the White Sand Giants had become the prey instead, as Zhang Xiaohou, Zhao Manyan, and Mo Fan took the initiative to eliminate them in groups!

The waves of sand that had previously rolled across the entire Drifting Sand River could only be seen around where the trio was now. It was only a matter of time until the place quieted down, as the White Sand Giants no longer posed any threat to the party.

“It seems like our journey ahead is going to be a lot easier,” said Lingling.

The White Sand Giants lost the battle as she finished her sentence. The trio went on to do some cleaning...

They had discovered an efficient way to deal with the White Sand Giants from this battle, so the creatures no longer posed any threat to the party despite their numbers.

The Drifting Sand River was intimidating, but it was not a death trap. The real experts who were bold enough could still cross it.

It was late at night, but the place was not completely dark.

The white sand on the ground had turned into an empty background, with brilliant stars decorating the beautiful night sky. One could only see such majestic yet elegant scenery with their own eyes here at the Dunhuang region...

After the epic battle, the Drifting Sand River fell silent.

Xinxia was casting her gentle Healing Magic to treat the men’s wounds. Her Psychic Element energy was limited, but her Healing Element energy was abundant. She could continue to replenish the trio’s energy as long as hers was not fully expended.

“Nice, I never had such an experience killing demon beasts before!” Zhao Manyan grinned, about to burst out laughing, except the wound on his face split open.

Zhang Xiaohou nodded in agreement. The battles he had fought with his comrades in the army were not as pleasing as this one.

Mo Fan placed his hands on the back of his head and laid down on the soft sand, staring into the beautiful night sky. He was enjoying the aftertaste of eliminating so many demon beasts, while counting the number of Servant-class Soul Essences he had acquired from the battle!

After including the first two Soul Essences, it turned out that he had refined five in total. If he could sell them, they would be worth twenty-five million RMB, an incredible sum!

Mo Fan did not overthink it. He immediately used the three Soul Essences to refine his Fire Element Stars.

In addition to the seven he had strengthened before, ten more of his Fire Element Stars were improved. Even though he was still a great distance away from strengthening all forty-nine Stars, he was confident that he would eventually level up his Fiery Fist to the fourth tier one day!

Mo Fan knew the journey to becoming an Advanced Magician was a long one. If he managed to improve his Fiery Fist to the fourth tier prior to leveling up to the Advanced Level, the power of his Fiery Fist would be half that of an Advanced Spell, and together with the Spells from his other Elements, even an Advanced Magician would have trouble defeating him easily!

And in addition, the purpose of their adventure was to find the Flame Belle! If he could get himself a Flame Belle, his strength would further improve!

“You seem to be wearing it all the time,” Xinxia’s gentle voice came from his side.

Mo Fan turned his head slightly and saw Xinxia sitting down beside him after she finished treating the wounds of the others.

As he was lying on the ground with his collar loosened up, the Little Loach Pendant, which had been hidden on his chest, was revealed. The observant Xinxia immediately noticed it.

“Yeah, although I have no idea where it came from, I think it’s able to bring me good luck,” Mo Fan replied with a smile.

“It’s special,” Xinxia observed, also smiling. Her magic sense was a lot sharper than other Magicians due to her Psychic Element, hence she could detect a special power inside the pendant, but she could not explain in detail.

She did not ask further about the Little Loach Pendant. Her understanding was that Mo Fan would tell her if he wanted to, thus it would be meaningless to ask about it.

The others might assume that Xinxia’s thinking was rather old-fashioned, yet they forgot that Mo Fan had been brainwashing her since she was young. Therefore, Mo Fan with the great vision was no doubt the one benefiting the most from his ‘cultivation project’!

It did not mean that Xinxia was lacking in her own thinking. Her outstanding results and reputation in her school were proof that she was extremely intelligent, but whenever she was with her Brother Mo Fan, she would instinctively become obedient, and find herself at the mercy of the man.

For example, when the jerk decided to abuse the fact that everyone was resting and slowly moved his hand along the girl’s waist toward her round bottom, Xinxia had ten thousand different ways of escaping from the shameless act, yet when she realized that the hand was her Brother Mo Fan’s claw, she immediately blushed. She wanted to slap the hand away, but she lacked the courage to do so, thus she could only look around with her panicking eyes, afraid that someone would see it...

However, the baddie Mo Fan was staring sternly into the sky, like an educated young man pondering the laws of nature, about life; but he was in fact doing an infuriating lewd act by abusing the blind spot in everyone’s field of vision!

Luckily, Xinxia never showed any temper when she was with Mo Fan. If she were Mu Ningxue or Tangyue, she would have blasted Mo Fan into the sky with Ice or Fire!

Mo Fan showed no intention of repenting his deeds. He was enjoying the soft touch, the shocking bounce. His hand continued to slide downward, almost covering half of her buttock.

Xinxia’s face was so red that steam was on the verge of rising from the boiling temperature. She wanted to stand up...

However, standing up was quite a challenge for her. Besides, if she rose to her feet now, the others would see Mo Fan’s hand on her body, and it would be even more embarrassing... The baddie Mo Fan was using her to block the others’ vision!

Feeling extremely uncomfortable and the heat rising up in her body, Xinxia was not even in the mood to roll her eyes at Mo Fan. She tried very hard to calm her thoughts, pretending that nothing was happening.

More frustratingly, Mo Fan was simply discussing some normal topics with her like nothing was happening, perfectly disguising his shameless act under the beautiful night sky!
