3078 Change of Plan

Between the Reflective Holy City and Holy City on the earth, Mo Fan stared at the broken street, he saw an all-too-familiar figure. A trace of bitterness and helplessness sprouted from his heart.

He did not expect to see the person whom he had been missing for so long in such a way.

He thought he was a matchless hero and could trample all the savagery and evils in the world. He thought he could be like Zhan Kong and entered the city of death on his own. He thought he could fight fearlessly in the battle for the sake of his loved ones. He thought he could become an epic hero.

Unfortunately, reality was different from the script he had envisioned. The person who made an enemy of the world was Mu Ningxue. She was like a matchless hero. Meanwhile, Mo Fan was more like a tearful and frail woman…

Sigh, life was unpredictable.

At the very least, he was a man with an indomitable spirit. He was known as a demon of all evil deeds. He was a disaster maker that caused turmoil in the world.

Even a woman could become a hero out of anger.

And that woman was Mu Ningxue.

She had always been like that.

Mo Fan had a strong physique with a heart of steel. Even so, when he saw Mu Ningxue barge into the city all by herself, his heart melted upon feeling Mu Ningxue’s special “tenderness” for him.

Although Mo Fan had put all the main characters in their novels to shame, he felt the feeling of being “pampered” by a beauty was extraordinary, sincere, and real. He felt touched and proud.

At the Alps College and the West End Alpine College…

There was a clear line between the snow-capped peak and the vast expanse of juniper. The Alpine College at Alps Mountain was located between the two. Half of it was close to the beauty of the green juniper forest, while the other half was close to the magnificence of the icy cliff.

Alpine College was located in a remote area. It was quite far away from the main college in Alps Mountain, but it was very near to Holy City. They could arrive at the city after passing through the pine forest, foothills, and plains.

If they climbed to the top of the snowy peak and looked to the west, they could see a small part of Holy City.

A large parchment was unfolded on the ground. Snow fell on it, but it did not affect anything.

“Our help is needed to break the divine oath. Someone has to stand before Mo Fan and control the bizarre Star Bugs so that they can extract the holy runes from Mo Fan’s soul. In other words, at least one of us has to stay safe before Mo Fan for five minutes, and the process must go on without any disturbance,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“I’m the only one who can do this. I can control the bizarre Star Bugs, then use the Honey Soul to heal Mo Fan’s traumatized soul,” said Mu Bai in a deep voice.

“But the hardest part is, how do we enter the city? Holy City has many angels as well as the Holy Shadows, the Holy Judges, the Heresy Judgment Mages, and Holy City Guardian Mages. Moreover, they are in a locked-up state. Barging into the city is the hardest part. We have to find a way to barge into the city before devising the next plan,” said Yu Shishi.

“Listen to me, according to my reliable source of information, there is a dead end at the end of Twelfth Avenue by dusk. It’s the west end of Holy City. By then, the Black Totem Turtle and I will barge into the city from the west. We will do all we can to attract the attention of the Holy Shadows and the Holy Judges. It’s best if we can also keep an archangel busy. Meanwhile, you guys will take the opportunity to blend into Holy City. You will enter from the back of Holy City and into the Reflective Holy City through the inverted hexagram.” Zhao Manyan signaled everyone to listen to his arrangement.

Everyone looked at him. Mu Bai frowned and said, “It’s too dangerous. The first person to enter the city will most likely be executed in a cruel manner. The Black Totem Turtle and you could be cut into eight pieces in just five minutes. Besides, you haven’t dabbled into the realm of the Forbidden Curse yet.”

“Have you, then?” refuted Zhao Manyan gruffly.

“I-I…” It was clear that Mu Bai had another proposal in his mind. After all, if he was able to summon the dark power, he probably could survive a while longer in Holy City.

“Stop interrupting me. Our goal is to remove the divine oath from Mo Fan and not save him from that hellish place. We still have to depend on Mo Fan’s Demon Element power to leave that place alive. I’ll be the bait, and you guys will do everything you can to send Mo Fan to Mu Bai,” said Zhao Manyan.

The group did not say anything. Indeed, they had no other choices.

“Don’t look so depressed. With the Black Totem Turtle, even if I’m not a match for the angels, the angels will have difficulty killing me. Barging into the city is the key. The more Holy City experts I can attract, the higher our success rate!” continued Zhao Manyan.

“But—”

“That is all. Enough of the bullsh*t Holy City! F*ck it!”

“No, it seems like there are some changes to the situation,” said Zhang Xiaohou with great urgency as he ran into the house.

“What is it?”

“You better come with me and take a look at it,” said Zhang Xiaohou seriously.

…

They climbed onto the snowy peak where they could view Holy City. The group of people took turns using the special Alpine distant view instrument. They were so shocked to say anything after seeing the current situation of the actual Holy City.

They had not recovered their senses even after a long time. They looked in disbelief.

“While we’re still figuring out how to barge into Holy City, someone has made his way to the center of Holy City from the First Avenue…” Zhao Manyan looked both surprised and embarrassed.

They no longer needed a plan.

Someone had already settled that hardest part for them!

“Who do you think she is? Am I the only one who thinks she resembles Mu Ningxue?” Jiang Shaoxu said with uncertainty.

“It’s Mu Ningxue!”

“Holy sh*t! Goddess Mu is too… I don’t know what to say about her… W-Why didn’t she discuss it with us beforehand?” Zhao Manyan collapsed.

They had been discussing the most feasible way to save Mo Fan. However, Holy City was too powerful. They had found all the possible ways. Still, they were stuck in the part where they had to barge into the city.

Holy City waited for the people from the ten greatest organizations to barge into the city. The people who barged into the city would be treated brutally. Holy City would do everything they could to ruthlessly trample the first batch of people…

Who would have thought Mu Ningxue single-handedly faced the enemy when they were still caught in the chaos? She had not only barged into the city, but she also made her way murderously to Penal Angel Fahl!

“What do we do now?” Zhang Xiaohou could not make up his mind. They did not expect the sudden changes.

“Trash! We’re looking like real trash standing by and watching the battle,” said Zhao Manyan with heartfelt pain for Mu Ningxue.

“Let’s go! We will head over to Holy City too,” said Mu Bai.

“Go! We’ll rush into the city with Mu Ningxue!”

Plan?

Did they even need a plan?!

Mu Ningxue alone had settled the hardest part. All they needed to do was to do everything they could to release Mo Fan!

“Mu Ningxue is awesome!”

“Yes… She has always been like this.”

“But it’s Holy City, after all…”

Everyone was surprised and delighted to see Mu Ningxue’s appearance. They felt as if God appeared in a group of mortals all of a sudden. It was as though they only had to wave the flag and cheer for her while she slashed the demons ahead of them.
