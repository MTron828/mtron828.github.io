“Someone on the Chinese team is going to be disqualified first!”

“Why do I feel like that woman is a burden to the Chinese team? As a Psychic Mage, she totally lost herself to the enemy’s Psychic Mage without putting up a fight. I didn’t have high hopes in her right from the start.”

“A team’s Psychic Mage can easily decide the outcome of a match. The Chinese team might lose because of her!”

“Luckily, the other girl was very decisive. If the two of them were knocked out, the Chinese team won’t have a chance to turn the tables.”

The spectators shook their heads when they saw Jiang Shaoxu being grabbed by the Granite Inferior Dragon like a little worm.

That being said, the supporters on the side of Germany and Europe cheered loudly. In a match like this, taking out a member would secure a great advantage for their team, and it was likely to be the deciding factor in winning the match!

On the side of the Chinese team, the advisors, students, and leaders all had grim faces.

If Feng Li was to say something, the team had collapsed a lot quicker than he thought. If the opposing team failed to find a breakthrough by targeting Jiang Shaoxu, their defensive formation could still hold on for more than ten rounds!

“Congratulations, you are the first person to be knocked out from this match. You will cry again when the people of your country, your teammates, and your advisors are criticizing you for losing the match. Gorgeous, I’ll send you out like a gentleman.” The tanned Mage was amused by Jiang Shaoxu’s glare.

His Granite Inferior Dragon had already caught the woman. What difference would it make if the woman had woken up or not?

Jiang Shaoxu’s gaze sharpened. The tears had stopped pouring out from her eyes. Even though her face was still wet from her tears, and her vision was still blurred, she had a determined look in her eyes!

“You’re the one that’s going to be condemned and treated disdainfully!” Jiang Shaoxu’s cold gaze suddenly burned passionately as she stared right at the opponent in front of her!

“That’s hilarious. You can’t possibly be thinking of controlling my Granite Inferior Dragon with your mental strength?” the tanned Mage snapped furiously. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I won’t need to control it, I just need to control you!” The strong light emitted by Jiang Shaoxu’s eyes sprang right at the tanned Mage.

The tanned Mage was standing on the shoulder of the Granite Inferior Dragon. He did not think that a woman who was like an arrow at the end of its flight would suddenly unleash such strong magic.

“In your dreams!” the Mage reacted fairly quickly, commanding the Granite Inferior Dragon to tighten its grip.

The grip of the Granite Inferior Dragon was extremely strong. Jiang Shaoxu’s bones started to crack as an overwhelming force was applied to her.

However, the glow in Jiang Shaoxu’s eyes showed no sign of weakening, as if she was unable to feel any pain!

“Crush her!” the Mage yelled at the top of his lungs as he was about to lose his mind to Jiang Shaoxu’s magic.

Jiang Shaoxu was unwilling to give up either, with a strong determination that she had never shown before!

The assistant judges were ready to make their moves. Jiang Shaoxu was currently in great danger, as she did not have any protection. If the Granite Inferior Dragon tightened its grip any further, it would crush every bone in Jiang Shaoxu’s body.

“That girl, she’s out of her mind!” The two assistant judges could not wait any further.

They had to intervene. Otherwise, the whole world would see a young, beautiful woman exploding, and blood splattering everywhere. The tanned Mage had clearly given his Summoned Beast the order to kill the woman amid the great torture he was in!

The assistant judges entered the stage. They would be able to save Jiang Shaoxu within a second, but it also meant that Jiang Shaoxu would be disqualified from the match.

However, the tanned Mage on the shoulder of the Granite Inferior Dragon suddenly cried out in pain and fell to the shoulder feebly.

The Granite Inferior Dragon was trying to kill Jiang Shaoxu just a moment ago, but it suddenly loosened its grip in an instant.

Jiang Shaoxu fell to the ground. The tears on her face were already dry from the blowing wind, but the determination in her eyes was scarily strong!

Jiang Shaoxu did not panic at all, as if everything was completely under her control. She reached out her hand, pointing at the Psychic Mage, Parker.

“Take him out!” Jiang Shaoxu uttered.

The Granite Inferior Dragon immediately turned around, unleashing all its power to attack Parker!

Parker’s face paled. He did not expect his opponent would be able to control the tanned Mage, and even worse, she had managed to control the Granite Inferior Dragon, too!

“Splendid, that was absolutely impressive! She managed to control the Summoner, and used him to command the Summoned Beast. That was brilliant!” Feng Li yelled out in excitement.

—

The tables had turned suddenly. The Ice Mage of the German team had broken down mentally, making him unfit for battle. Furthermore, the powerful Granite Inferior Dragon had suddenly become the Chinese team’s helper, posing a great threat to the Germans!

A great uproar took place in the stadium. The people could feel their hearts racing just watching the sequence. The counterattack from Jiang Shaoxu took everyone by surprise. The way she stood against the enormous Inferior Dragon and the tanned Mage unyieldingly had touched the hearts of the crowd. They immediately felt their blood boiling!

The weak woman that was initially crying in tears had transformed into a firm and unyielding fighter. The crowd could not find any words to describe the excitement they were feeling!

However, it was obvious that the transformation did not just happen instantly.

The weak girl that was tearing up was Jiang Shaoxu eight years ago.

But now, she was no longer lazy or unambitious. She was here just so the man that had passed away would be proud of her.

—

“I promised you that I would be standing on this stage, and here I am.

“But you promised me that you were going to come back safely, why didn’t you keep your promise?...”

—

BANG! The Granite Inferior Dragon fully unleashed its might and attacked the Psychic Mage Parker with rocks and sand.

Parker fled ignominiously. He was not only under the attack of the ferocious Granite Inferior Dragon, but he was also suffering the wrath of Jiang Shaoxu. No one had ever dared touch the deepest secret inside her heart. The man could easily attack her with other illusions, yet he had decided to use the cruelest method.

He initially thought he could crush Jiang Shaoxu’s mind, but little did he know, it was both the most fragile and sturdiest place in her mind. Her tears had fallen, yet her heart had grown even stronger!
