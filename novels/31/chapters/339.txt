Chapter 342: Giant Lizard vs Giant Centipede

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

When his body slammed down on the underground riverbed from to the momentum of the mud plummeting down, Mo Fan finally realized that it was too early to deem his plan perfect!

The feeling of it was definitely not a pleasant one after he had just experienced the impact from the Commander-level demon beast’s trampling a moment ago. If it weren’t for the layer of mud and water, his bones would have broken into pieces by now.

Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou held their breath while being dragged around by the rapid current.

They could feel their minds going blank, but they tried their very best to remain conscious, as they had no idea where the current would drag them to in the end...

Cough cough cough~ Cough cough~

Mo Fan dragged the half-dead Zhang Xiaohou to the shore of the river. It was impossible to tell how many layers of mud was he covered in, as it was so thick that he no longer looked human.

He kept on coughing, trying to clear out the mud that had entered his nose and throat. It felt horribly disgusting!

Li Man soon found the two men. When she saw Zhang Xiaohou lying beside Mo Fan unconscious, she stomped her foot on his stomach without mercy.

A pillar of mud jetted out from Zhang Xiaohou’s mouth as he regained consciousness.

“Water Barrier!” Li Man swiftly cast the Water Spell and produced tiny drops of water. They soon formed a ribbon of water and wiped off the two mud men under Li Man’s control.

The watery ribbon dug into their noses and throats, giving them a thorough cleaning-out.

Li Man ended up casting a few Water Barriers just to turn Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou back to normal. She glanced at the two half-dead young men and giggled, “It’s been a while since I last met teenagers who were so willing to put their lives at risk.”

Li Man was indeed fairly impressed by the two’s courageous spirits. Normally, anyone’s face would turn pale after hearing the term “Commander-level”, and would stay as far away as possible, let alone taking the initiative to provoke them!

Each of them was in charge of luring a Commander-level demon beast, and the hardest thing to believe was, they actually managed to escape in one piece!

“Brother Fan, can you put me in charge of blasting the hole open next time?” Zhang Xiaohou blurted out dully.

“Do you really want a next time?” asked Mo Fan in a similar tone.

Zhang Xiaohou shook his head wildly!

Mo Fan would never want to find trouble with a Commander-level demon beast if it weren’t for the fact that he desperately needed its Soul Remnant.

The ceiling of the underground cavern shook vigorously. It felt like the fragile layer of rocks would crumble at any second.

The two gigantic beasts had begun fighting one another. The endless vibration was the best indication.

“Should we go up?” Zhang Xiaohou asked after finishing his rest. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“A Commander-level demon beast won’t die so easily, it will take days for the battle to come to an end... By the way, Li Man, didn’t you mention something about an Earth Element Soul Seed?” asked Mo Fan.

“Mm, it’s in that direction. Too bad we didn’t bring any harvesting tools with us. Once I blasted it open, the energy of the Soul Seed will be lost fairly soon,” replied Li Man in a rather pitiful voice.

The Earth Element Soul Seed was definitely something remarkable, as Li Man was only able to puncture it with strong Advanced Magic. No wonder many hunters were keen to find it, as they would surely be able to sell it at an incredible price.

“Houzi, aren’t you an Earth Magician, what are you waiting for? Are you going to stand there until its energy is completely lost!” Mo Fan kicked at Zhang Xiaohou, who was lost in his thoughts.

“Me?” Zhang Xiaohou pointed at himself and blurted out with disbelief.

“Li Man and I don’t have the Earth Element. Who else among us can take it, hurry the f**k up! Once you claim the Earth Element Soul Seed, it’s time to go to the surface to deal with the two idiotic beasts!” exclaimed Mo Fan.

Zhang Xiaohou no longer felt miserable from his previous experience. He immediately followed Li Man’s directions to the location of the Earth Element Soul Seed.

Waves after waves of mud were stirred up, each fiercer than the ones before.

On the west side of the valley, the innocent Giant Lizards climbed their way up the mountain while staring at the roaring tides of mud being produced at the center of the swamp. Their instincts were urging them to stay as far away as possible.

Everything within a few hundred meters of a battle between two Commander-level demon beasts was at risk. The closest safe distance would be at least one or two kilometers away.

The Giant Lizards tugged their brains and continued to climb up the mountain. They were like refugees fleeing for their lives after their homes were drowned with mud.

The different segments of land close to the center of the swamp were devoured by the continuous waves of mud rolling in all directions. The two Commander-level demon beasts had been enemies for quite some time in the valley, and each seeing that the other was currently suffering severe injuries, they both assumed that their time of conquering the Xizhao Valley had finally arrived. As such, they totally ignored the two humans who had somehow disappeared, and started a life-or-death brawl between themselves.

The Giant Poisonous Centipede had been living in the valley for around seventy years. It had already conquered a part of Dongting Lake prior to the arrival of the Giant Lizards. However, when the Giant Lizards moved in around twenty years ago, its habitat was overrun with them, not to mention the Xuanwu Giant Lizard who had forcibly occupied its old nest. It had no choice but to move to a smaller swamp nearby.

The two creatures had been enemies for a very long time, thus they totally went all out in the battle. They were aware that the valley had a perfect balance of Water and Earth Elements, thus either a Water Element Soul Seed or an Earth Element Soul Seed would appear every five or six years. Both the Giant Poisonous Centipede and the Xuanwu Giant Lizard agreed that they could not find a better place to cultivate than here in Dongting Lake!

Only one Commander was allowed in this valley!

The Giant Poisonous Centipede could no longer withhold the grudge against the Xuanwu Giant Lizard, which had been building up since its habitat was taken away. It was determined to avenge itself while the Xuanwu Giant Lizard was still recovering from severe injuries!

A purple poisonous mist was discharged from the pores on the Giant Poisonous Centipede’s body. The poison rapidly contaminated the water, and even lingered in the air...

The Giant Poisonous Centipede’s greatest weapon was its poison. Even Commander-level demon beasts that were stronger than it would be turned into its food once they were poisoned.

The Xuanwu Giant Lizard’s stance slightly weakened when it saw the poison spreading.

Its was a fair bit stronger than the Giant Poisonous Centipede. Its body was the size of a mountain, and not merely for decoration purposes. The shell on its back could easily resist the sharp mandibles of the centipede. The reason why it had yet to drive it away completely was because of its poison...

The Xuanwu Giant Lizard was aware of its strong poison, and immediately backed off from it.

To it surprise, the Giant Poisonous Centipede pounced at it with its hundred-meters-long body and tore at its face, biting a huge chunk of flesh off!

The Xuanwu Giant Lizard was thoroughly infuriated. It stood upright and grabbed the Giant Poisonous Centipede’s limbs with its claws, tearing them apart!

The front two limbs were amputated. A great amount of liquid jetted out from the wounds like fountains...

The Giant Poisonous Centipede uttered a furious roar. It tried to spray the liquid onto the Xuanwu Giant Lizard!

The liquid spurting out was also poisonous!

The Giant Poisonous Centipede did not care about the two amputated limbs, as it still had twelve remaining. It was trying to poison the Xuanwu Giant Lizard with its daring move!
