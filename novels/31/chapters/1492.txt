“Let’s hope Amelia’s murderer and the person that poisoned Herr Casa are the same people; that way, we might still have a chance to fix this,” Mo Fan said.

“What do you mean by that? Are you telling me that you still don’t know who the culprit is?” Sheryl said angrily.

“If Herr Casa was poisoned in the school, the culprit must be from the school, instead of an outsider. Therefore, she’s most likely the same culprit that is still hiding in the school. I’ll need to borrow something from you. I should be able to find out the reason behind Amelia’s death with it...” Mo Fan said.

Before Mo Fan could finish, a huge blast suddenly took place outside, like a huge building had collapsed all of a sudden. The rows of bookshelves in the meeting room fell to the ground, books scattering all over the place!

The glass in the room shattered into pieces. They looked outside the window and saw a clock tower close to the edge of the school grounds collapsing. Its debris was blown into the air before crashing onto the delicate statues, bushes, and little bridges in the school.

“This is absurd!” Headmistress Perry was enraged. She was the first to run out of the room.

The other teachers followed. Mo Fan went after them to see what was going on.

The clock tower of Faerun School had been destroyed. The structure had been around for a long time, not to mention it was extremely close to Herr Casa’s room. Headmistress Perry initially thought the culprit had struck again. She was planning to catch the culprit red-handed, but to her surprise, the person responsible did not bother leaving. He stood opposite the structure that collapsed and looked down at the students who were fleeing for their lives in panic.

The man’s black and white suit drifted in the wind. He was glaring at Headmistress Perry.

“It’s you!” Headmistress Perry recognized the man right away. Her face was filled with shock.

“It is me. Headmistress Perry, I’m getting more disappointed in you. I don’t believe you would dare to harm the successor of our clan, but how could you allow such a vicious person to sneak into your Alps Institute without you knowing... consider the fate of this building a warning from the Casas. You better hope the young duke is going to be fine in the end. Otherwise, I won’t just destroy the building, I won’t let a single person leave the building alive!” the elder from the Casas threatened them imperiously.

The elder from the Casas was remarkably strong, obviously an authority figure in the Casas. He even considered himself a senior to Headmistress Perry, and completely ignored her anger.

“We sure will explain ourselves to you, but Elder Ling, aren’t you being a little too ruthless? This is a sacred school, not a place to repay kindness with evil!” Headmistress Perry protested.

“So what? It’s your responsibility to take care of the young duke. I’m already being merciful by not starting a bloodbath!” Elder Ling reported.

“We are already trying our best to get rid of the Curse that the young duke is placed under. May I ask you not to pressure us any further!?” Headmistress Perry exclaimed.

“If I don’t, how would I know that you’re indeed doing your very best to save the young duke’s life? I will give you a day’s time. If you don’t hand over the person responsible, I shall find the culprit in my own way! I’m giving you a chance before it’s too late!” Elder Ling declared coldly.

Elder Ling turned and flew away after finishing his words. He was gone in the blink of an eye.

Ceylan and the others hurried over to the young duke’s room, but discovered that the Casas had already taken him with them. They had no idea where they had gone.

“He’s still in a serious condition, if they take him...” Ceylan said worriedly.

“They are heading for the Holy Judgment Court,” Brianca spoke.

“Perhaps they have a way to crack the poison and the Curse, but...” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The teachers felt helpless. The Casas had been the strongest clan in Europe for a long time, and were extremely proud and arrogant. If they did not hand over the culprit in a day’s time, a lot of the students were going to be in danger. The Casas would rather kill a thousand innocent people than let a culprit go. The students were going to suffer for sure!

“What do we do now? I heard that a renowned clan once accidentally killed a disciple from the Casas. In the end, the Casas took away half the people from the clan. They did find the person responsible for their disciple’s death in the end, but none of the ones taken survived!” Sheryl blurted out in fear.

Mo Fan stared after Elder Ling. He was utterly shocked, too. How reckless were the Casas? They dared to treat a world-reputable school like this, and Herr Casa’s life was not really in danger! They had shown no respect to the Alps Institute. Considering the Alps Institute had more influence than the Pearl Institute, if this happened in the Pearl Institute, wouldn’t they have razed the whole school to the ground right away!?

“They took Herr Casa. We were thinking of searching him for clues, but it’s going to be a lot harder now,” Ceylan observed.

“A day, we only have a day... this is insane!” Brianca protested.

Headmistress Perry looked at Mo Fan. After a moment of hesitation, she said with a sincere voice, “Mo Fan, I first apologize to you for my wrongdoings. We have zero clue what is going on in the school, so please help us now that the lives of our innocent students are at stake!”

Mo Fan was surprised that the old hag would beg him for help. She really cared about her students. She did not want the students to fall into the hands of the Casas, after seeing their violent approach.

“I will try my best. Are the Casas really that powerful? Can they just break the rules of the Magic Associations and the international laws?” Mo Fan asked confusedly.

“They can indeed ignore the rules and laws if they have a valid reason. After all, they have a Forbidden Mage,” Headmistress Perry sighed heavily.

Having a Forbidden Mage surpassed everything. It was the main reason why the Casas were able to maintain their status. As long as the Forbidden Mage was still around, no one in the world could possibly pose a threat to them!

“I see...” Mo Fan murmured.
