It was obvious that Sharjah did not desire to be one of the Archangels.

The role of an Archangel was like a golden cage to her. She could not fly away, even though she had fourteen wings.

The golden cage was not part of an evil scheme or government. It was the sacred duty that had taken her freedom away.

From now on, every word and action from her would affect the whole world. Mo Fan had thought of her as an untainted elf when he met her the first time. She was supposed to live in a mystical forest, one without war and pain.

But now, she was trapped in a seemingly sacred city full of infighting and scheming!

The Sacred City was a lot more complicated than any Magic Association. Were the Archangels really united? Most importantly, it was impossible to tell if the Archangels were righteous or evil when they were executing their duties.

When Sharjah said goodbye to Asha’ruiya and Mo Fan, it felt like she was also saying goodbye to a part of herself who wished to be free and go on adventures as she pleased.

“If you want to be Sharjah, you can come with us!” Mo Fan felt sorry for Sharjah when he saw her struggling.

Sharjah slowly shook her head.

Su Lu was the Chairman of the Asia Magic Association, and had started such a terrifying war. If no one was around to clean up the mess, the Asia Magic Association would have fallen into chaos and destroyed the order of the Sacred City.

“Teacher, I’m just recalling our fond memories, but I already have an answer.” Sharjah looked up with a pure and sincere smile.

She already had an answer…

She admired her mentor Feng Zhoulong, but he had died at the hands of the corrupted Magic Association and the Sacred City.

Without proper systems and supervision, every Magic Association would give birth to someone like Su Lu. Humans could never control their greed and desires, everyone was seeking power and influence. Other ambitious Councilmen might end up as the next Su Lu.

Sharjah had to go back to the Sacred City so the sacrifices of the scholars were not in vain.

She was unwilling to give up her freedom, but she would not run away from her fate. It was her obligation and duty!

—

Mo Fan was feeling upset as he watched Sharjah leave.

He waited until Sharjah had disappeared into the distance before he told Asha’ruiya, “Let’s go.”

“You are pretty impressive!” Asha’ruiya giggled at him like a seductive little vixen.

“Why so?”

“You have slept with an Archangel!”

“...”

——

The two headed for Greece and soon arrived in Athens.

The Mediterranean Sea was not being invaded by the sea monsters. Only the Pacific Ocean was in danger.

The greater the crisis, the higher the status of the Parthenon Temple. Every Servant of the Parthenon Temple was treated like a goddess across the world because of their outstanding Healing and Blessing Elements.

The Parthenon Temple was unusually quiet when Mo Fan arrived. Half of its members had gone outstation.

“It seems like no one is home!” Mo Fan had not seen any familiar faces.

Even Izisha was not around. She had most likely gone to the Sacred Hall of Liberty. The Sacred Hall of Liberty’s support was crucial if she wanted to become the Goddess.

“Isn’t it perfect? We can do whatever we want!” Asha’ruiya seemed very happy.

“What are you so happy about? Your competitors are working hard to increase their performance, while you are wasting time doing nothing,” Mo Fan pointed out.

“I never had a chance in the election. I’m just taking part to make up the numbers. Besides, even if I lose the election, I’m still a Saintess!” Asha’ruiya was very optimistic.

“Izisha has long seen you as an eyesore. If she becomes the Goddess, the first person going to jail will be you,” Mo Fan warned her.

Asha’ruiya rolled her eyes, harrumphed, and said, “She will only put me under house arrest at most. She will still feed me properly, like a pet cat. It’s Xinxia who’s going to send me to jail instead. She has long suspected we are having an affair. I should support Izisha for my own sake. Besides, did you already forget? Izisha is only a pawn to my father.”

“HAHAHA, do you really believe that madwoman’s words?” Mo Fan laughed.

“I would rather think she’s telling the truth,” Asha’ruiya said gloomily.

“So what are you going to give me?” Mo Fan asked, switching the topic.

“I noticed your Equipment is too low-level. How can an unstoppable demon king like you not have any reliable Equipment? I have already asked our best forgemaster to make you a set of Equipment,” Asha’ruiya said.

“I’m surprised. Why are you giving me such a huge gift all of a sudden?” Mo Fan wondered aloud.

Mo Fan had been troubled by the problem of not having reliable Equipment for a long time. His strength had improved too fast, thus much of his Equipment had become useless to him.

Mu Ningxue wanted to craft a set of magic Equipment for him, but she had ended up giving them away to other people on Fanxue Mountain. In the end, the Equipment was no longer useful for him.

“Actually, I have two things to give you. I need your help for the second thing,” Asha’ruiya answered.

“Judging by the look in your eyes, I don’t think we are doing something legal,” Mo Fan judged from experience.

“The Spring of Darkness. I’m sure you haven’t forgotten the thing that can increase your strength by fifty percent?” Asha’ruiya reminded him.

“How could I forget it? It’s a pity that its effects only last temporarily,” Mo Fan sighed.

Asha’ruiya stuck her face close to Mo Fan and whispered into his ear, “Do you want it to be permanent?”

Mo Fan popped his eyes open as wide as a weasel. “Do you have an idea?” Mo Fan blurted out excitedly.

“I can modify the Blessing of the God’s Seal slightly and mix it with the Spring of Darkness to make its effects permanent,” Asha’ruiya confirmed.

“Don’t tell me you stole something from the Dark Plane?” Mo Fan realized something.

“What do you think?” Asha’ruiya put on a cunning grin.

Why would the Lord of Darkness punish Asha’ruiya? Just because her Dark Swordmaster was helping her?

The Lord of Darkness was punishing Asha’ruiya because she had stolen something!

However, the Lord of Darkness did not want to expose what she had done, thus he came up with another excuse to punish her.

“The Dark Blessing… will it permanently increase my strength by fifty percent?” Mo Fan asked with great anticipation.

“Mm, it works with all Elements except for White Magic.. Since you have seven Elements, you are going to benefit the most from it!” Asha’ruiya agreed.
