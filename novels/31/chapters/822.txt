Zhao Manyan’s heart was burning with anxiety when he saw the painful expression on Nan Rongni’s sweat-covered face!

Nan Rongni was a Healer, but it was difficult for a Healer to diagnose herself. She was totally unaware of the deadly poison that was spreading inside her body.

“Zu Jiming, Zu Jiming, come here at once!” yelled Zhao Manyan, when he recalled that Zu Jiming was a Poison Magician.

“There’s no need to summon me[ I can cast poison, or drive poison away, but I can’t treat anyone that is poisoned. Didn’t we bring all kinds of antidotes? Are you telling me that none of them works?” said Zu Jiming.

“We have to bring her away from the battlefield. The poison is too strong, her life might be at risk!” declared Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan and Nan Rongni were fully focused on the fight against the Jagged-Paw Green Demon, and did not realize that Nan Rongni was in so much pain that she could no longer make any noise. When they finally went to check up on her, they realized that the poison had spread all across her leg, and was moving toward her waist and upper body.

There was still a chance to save her ifthe poison reached her liver and stomach, but if it reached her heart, even the Heavens could not save her!

“Can’t do, we’re being surrounded by sea monsters. Trying to break out from the surround would only split the team further, not to mention how dangerous it is when carrying an injured member,” said Ai Jiangtu. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The number of sea monsters rapidly increased as the tide rose higher. It was impractical to break out of the surround with an injured member. They had no choice but to hold their ground defensively. If anyone left their position, the whole group might be overrun!

“The White Sobbing Demon is a rare species. Even I wasn’t aware that its tentacles are poisonous. No one can guarantee that we can find the antidote to the poison even if we brought her to the safe zone. In my opinion, we should send someone to ask the other teams, and see if they know how to cure the poison,” said Jiang Yu.

The number of the sea monsters was increasing when a member of the team was injured, not to mention that the member was the Healer on the team. The whole team was suddenly in a panic.

It was difficult to come to a verdict when there were many people on a team. As such, when there were conflicting opinions, the team members would feel even more agitated.

“I have some herbs that can keep her alive longer. I’ll take care of her, don’t let the Jagged-Paw Green Demons come any closer,” Zhao Manyan told Nanyu.

Nanyu nodded and tried her best to calm down and listen to the movements of the surrounding creatures.

Ai Jiangtu was already making his way to where the other teams were. He was the only person that could still move around freely with his Space Element.

The team did not dare to lower their guard after realizing Nan Rongni was poisoned.

The sea monsters were scarier and more cunning than they had imagined. The tide continued to rise, with endless sea monsters jumping out of the water. Most of the sea monsters in their area were melee types, like the Jagged-Paw Green Demons, but the kinds that could cast powerful magic had already appeared in other zones. The situation looked extremely grim for the humans.

Ai Jiangtu cast Blink continuously as he wove through the streets towards the zone master.

As soon as Ai Jiangtu landed on a building, he immediately saw a huge wave crushing the buildings nearby like a gigantic beast!

“Watch out!” Ai Jiangtu heard the voice of a mature woman amid the blast. He quickly glanced in her direction and drew a Star Pattern, vanishing into thin air.

The huge wave came down, instantly crushing five buildings into pieces in a shocking manner!

The woman only saw Ai Jiangtu being devoured by the wave, yet did not notice a person had appeared behind her out of nowhere. She was about to let out a sigh when Ai Jiangtu tapped her on her shoulder.

“You... how are you behind me...” The woman was surprised, but she was able to recover fairly quickly.

“I have the Space Element,” answered Ai Jiangtu.

“No wonder, that explains it... I remember you, you’re the captain of the seventh team. Why have you come to the second team, we are all Advanced Magicians here? ...oh, you’re an Advanced Magician too, but you should be looking after your zone. Otherwise, it’s going to increase the burden of the other teams. The sea monsters aren’t really the merciful kind,” blurted out the woman.

“Someone on our team is poisoned. It was the White Sobbing Demon,” Ai Jiangtu was not in the mood to chit-chat with the woman. He immediately told her why he had come.

“White Sobbing Demon? Why would your team encounter something like that... don’t tell me you’ve escorted the injured away?” The woman seemed to be surprised. Her eyes were also showing a hint of fear at the mention of the White Sobbing Demon.

“Not yet,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“That’s a relief! Don’t take the injured away, it will only make the poison spread faster inside her. Even if you brought her to the Magic Association in Tokyo, I believe there’s no antidote there, either. The antidote to the White Sobbing Demon’s poison is quite special, it can’t be stored in any container...”

“What’s the antidote?”

“If you’ve seen the White Sobbing Demon, you must have noticed the white meat lump on its head that has a smooth and shiny surface, like the head of an infant. The antidote is inside the lump. Once the liquid leaves the lump, it will turn into powder within an hour. If anyone is poisoned by the White Sobbing Demon, you must not let the White Sobbing Demon run away, or else it’s going to be impossible to deal with the poison... did your team capture or kill the White Sobbing Demon?” asked the woman.

“It ran away...” Ai Jiangtu’s expression sank.

“Then what are you doing here still, go find it quick! The White Sobbing Demon’s poison is exclusive, only the White Sobbing Demon that poisoned your teammate has the antidote. It’s a very rare species, your team is very unlucky to stumble onto one!” added the woman.

Ai Jiangtu immediately took out his communication device and relayed the information about the antidote to the team.

Everyone was still clueless about what to do after learning how to acquire the antidote, since no one knew where the White Sobbing Demon was.

They were also heavily surrounded by the Jagged-Paw Green Demon. It was impossible to search for the White Sobbing Demon without killing all the creatures surrounding them.

“What do we do now?” asked Zhou Xu.

“What choice do you think we have? Let’s get rid of these Jagged-Paw Green Demons, the White Sobbing Demon has fled into the water; God knows where the creature is now.”

“Damn it, why did she have to put herself in danger like that when she’s the Healer? She should have asked someone else to check the cry of the infant out...” someone on the team started grumbling.

Everyone was already in a pinch trying to protect themselves from the Jagged-Paw Green Demons. How could they possibly spare anyone to look for the White Sobbing Demon?

“Mu Ningxue... strange, did anyone see Mu Ningxue?”

“I saw her heading for the nineteenth street...”

“She’s going after the White Sobbing Demon on her own.”

“Don’t panic, stay where you are!” Nanyu’s voice suddenly said in everyone’s ear. Her voice was incredibly loud, which left their ears buzzing. It also helped everyone to calm down.

Nanyu was trying to warn the team. She had just heard lots of Jagged-Paw Green Demons approaching them.

“We...we’re being surrounded...” Nanyu’s voice was suddenly extremely heavy.
