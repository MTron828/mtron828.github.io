The pillar of mud continued to rise. It soon coalesced into the frame of a tall structure.

More mud rose into the air. It looked like the mud was scattering randomly in the air, but it was being stacked higher on the structure.

A magnificent structure was soon assembled in the middle of the battlefield.

Mo Fan lifted his gaze in shock.

The structure was indeed two hundred meters tall! He did not expect the female student to possess such impressive capabilities!

“Construction is my field of expertise,” the young woman smiled after she saw Mo Fan’s shocked expression, but she soon composed herself.

“Thank you!” Mo Fan believed all the real estate companies would fancy talented Mages like her.

Mo Fan climbed to the top of the structure swiftly, and started building the Space-Compressing Bridge. He could not afford to waste any more time.

——

Mu Bai did a great job distracting the enemy spotter. Mo Fan quickly completed the Space Compression Bridge. Two silver arcs emitting silver light served as a magical tunnel in the air.

“Are you sure it’s going to work?” Brigadier General Blair sounded a little doubtful. He had never heard of any magic like that.

“You may ask the Crusaders to start Channeling their spells,” Mo Fan replied firmly.

Brigadier General Blair nodded.

He was holding a Sound Magic device that looked like a shell. It let out loud clanks after it was tossed into the air.

The clanking lasted for a while, signaling the Crusaders to make their move.

The Crusaders were extremely slow compared to the enemy’s Wind Destroyer. They mainly consisted of Basic and Intermediate Mages, whose physical attributes were only slightly better than ordinary people. Most of them were running on foot!

“Just ask them to fire their spells into the tunnel,” Mo Fan instructed them.

The Crusaders started drawing Star Orbits and Star Patterns after receiving the signal from Brigadier General Blair.

A Star Palace was built with twenty-four hundred and one Stars. Its special structure could multiply the strength of a spell, but when thousands of Mages were using their magic simultaneously, the number of Star Orbits and Star Patterns easily exceeded tens of thousand, or even a hundred thousand!

A hundred thousand Stars appeared and transferred their energy between the Star Orbits and Star Patterns, and would soon bring forth a tsunami of spells!

“Cross Chaos Formation!”

Thousands of spells were replicated by the Magic Formation. Every Fire Burst, Lightning Strike, Ice Spread, and Brilliant Light had doubled.

The enormous amount of magic looked like colorful carp swimming in a fast-flowing river as the spells entered the Space Compression Bridge.

They were heading straight for the ocean at the end of the river!

Sparks, lightning flickers, ice projectiles, and scorching light scattered through the air.

The three troops of Crusaders added up to over seven thousand men. The number of spells they were firing was insane, especially after they were duplicated by the Cross Chaos Formation!

The spells poured down from the sky and spread across the ground. The smoke they created surged above the clouds and spread a few kilometers away with deafening blasts!

The four Wind Warships had been in a loose formation in the beginning, until they gathered in the same spot to combine into the Wind Destroyer. As a result, they were not able to split up in time.

The overwhelming number of spells swallowed the Wind Destroyer. Its Armor of Light had little to no resistance to the attack. Countless soldiers on the deck of the Wind Destroyer were turned into ashes, and the wetlands, swamp, and the woods perished together with them!

“Keep going!” Brigadier General Blair shouted in excitement when he saw the enemy’s Wind Destroyer collapse.

It actually worked!

The Space Compression Bridge was marvelous. Not only did it solve the Crusader’s problem of limited range, it did not give the enemy any time to react either!

As a matter of fact, the Brown Rebels had been amused by the Federation Army’s attempt to attack them with Basic and Intermediate Spells when they were two kilometers apart. It was no different from firing at the enemy soldiers on a fort’s wall with mere hunting bows!

As a result, they had not even bothered setting up a proper defense with their Light Element.

The first round of spells had quickly eliminated a few thousand Brown Rebels, but the second round of spells was already pouring down from the sky!

“Ice Spread!”

The second wave mainly consisted of Ice Magic. More than fifteen hundred Ice Mages were Casting their spells simultaneously.

The Ice Spread grew like horrendously quick white vines. The duplication of the Cross Chaos Formation turned them into an icy white forest in the Space Compression Bridge.

The white forest of vines quickly reached the spot where the Brown Rebels had sustained great casualties. They smashed into the ground and turned the Brown Rebels into snowmen.

The frost spread so quickly that it looked like white dye was being splattered across the area. The Brown Rebels started fleeing for their lives, but many of them were still caught by the white vines of death. The vines entangled them before freezing them and converting them into a part of the whiteness.

“Keep going, kill those sons of b**tches!” Brigadier General Blair yelled like a madman at the top of his lungs.

The Wind Destroyer had killed most of his men. How could he not want to avenge his men, whose remains were nowhere to be found?

The more deaths the Brown Rebels had, the crazier he grew!

The Ice Magic was soon followed by heavy boulders.

The Brown Rebels who had escaped the frost thought they had made it out of a close call, and then the boulders fell on them and crushed them to pieces. Not only did the boulders fall from the sky, but they continued to roll for over a hundred meters afterwards.

The Brown Rebels who had been trapped in the white forest of vines were crushed into white powder. The boulders completely tore the Wind Destroyer to pieces!

——

Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh when he saw the Wind Destroyer was finally destroyed.

Even if he exposed his true strength, he would struggle to defeat ten thousand Mages by himself!

Luckily, Mo Fan had painstakingly learned how to construct the Space Compression Bridge from Lin Du before he left Xiamen.

The magic was not that useful for him most of the time, since the enemies he now faced could just dodge spells with ease. He rarely had any problem with the effective range of his spells, either.

However, it became extremely useful in a large-scale battle!

“That’s f**king awesome. Officer Mo, you’ve done a great job! What should I say to the Lieutenant General, so you will be rewarded accordingly?” Brigadier General Blair was having trouble calming down.

“That won’t be necessary. I just want to keep a low profile. I’m not trying to rise through the ranks. However, I’m quite curious about the Crusaders’ Cross Chaos Formation. May I learn it after the war?” Mo Fan requested.

The ability to duplicate spells! It was like Casting spells at half-price!

Mo Fan was looking forward to learning it!
