“Is everyone alright? I couldn’t find you at the previous spot, so I came here instead... I’m glad that everyone is here,” Mu Bai called out.

Mo Fan went on alert as soon as he heard the voice. He quickly reacted by tossing a series of fireballs in the direction of the voice without any hesitation.

Those little pricks still dared to mimic Mu Bai’s voice to trick him? Did they really take him for an idiot?

The students’ eyes widened. How was their lecturer on Magic Theory able to Cast a volley of fireballs instantly, like a magic trick? Was he trying to raze the whole woods to the ground?

“Freezing Dust!” Mu Bai’s came out of the woods.

A freezing breeze came out at Mo Fan’s fireballs as they were about to explode. Their flames were put out before they touched the trees and the ground. The extinguished fireballs turned into white dust sprinkling across the canopy, before the wind swept them into the sky.

“A neat trick, I guess I’ll have to be more serious. Heavenly Flames of the Burning Valley!...” Mo Fan was in a fit of anger when he saw the enemy nullify his Fire Spell with ease.

“Lecturer Mo Yifan, I don’t think Mountain Men can use magic,” Sharjah reminded him.

Mo Fan was constructing a Star Constellation. He was planning to turn it into a Star Palace, but the flames around him disappeared when he heard Sharjah’s words.

Mu Bai came out of the woods with a dark expression. He glared at Mo Fan and snapped, “Are you out of your goddamn mind?”

“F**k me, can you come up to us first before talking next time? How would I know if the Mountain Men aren’t mimicking your voice? Besides, where the Hells have you been? What took you so long just to take care of a single creature? You are supposed to be in charge of the class. Don’t throw your responsibilities to me!” Mo Fan spluttered back indignantly.

“I saw them falling into the Mountain Men’s trap in their den. It took me great efforts to save them!” Mu Bai pointed behind him.

Behind Mu Bai were Miyamoto Shin and three other security guards, who were all limping. They were covered in thick blood, both theirs and that of the enemy. It seemed like they had just experienced a tough fight.

“We thought a student was in trouble, yet it turned out to be a trap. Luckily, Lecturer Mu Han came just in time, or we might have been stuck in their cave forever,” Miyamoto Shin admitted.

“These Mountain Men are too cunning!” one of the security guards snarled.

His arm was heavily bent. The bones at the joint must have broken. It could no longer support his arm’s motion.

“Did you save them from the Mountain Men’s cave?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yeah, the creature we sensed must be their leader. Too bad I didn’t manage to kill it,” Mu Bai sighed.

Mo Fan grinned.

Things were a lot simpler if they knew where the Mountain Men’s cave was!

It was time to get rid of these vicious Mountain Men once and for all!

—

The Mountain Men of the Andes Mountains mostly lived in groups. They would stay in their groups most of the time.

There was a cave close to the Earthworm Gully, around five kilometers away from the plantation.

Around thirty Mountain Men lived in the cave. Their habits were similar to cavemen in primordial times. They lived in caves, fed on raw food they had obtained from hunting animals, and kept on reproducing.

Humans were like delicious deer in the eyes of the Mountain Men. They could eat their meat raw, cook them, or dry them. However, most humans who dared to cross the Earthworm Gully were Mages of a certain strength. They used to hunt humans with brute force, which resulted in a lot of casualties for them. There would not be not many members left in their cave, even if they managed to kill the humans.

They slowly adapted by learning how to split the work up and inflict fear on their prey.

It was similar to a pack of wolves when it was hunting a herd of cows. A herd of cows would easily outnumber a pack of wolves. If the cows worked together to fend off the wolves, the wolves would not stand a chance at all. However, the wolves would abuse the fear of the cows and drive them into a panic first. The cows would then focus on fleeing for their lives when the wolves showed up. They just needed to pick on the cows that were left behind.

The Mountain Men knew human Mages were strong when they were in their formations, and they would only get themselves killed if they faced the humans head-on. As such, they had learned to split a group of humans up and pick on those who had separated from the group.

They might not be as strong as the Mages, but they could still kidnap stray humans and drag them to their caves!

The leader of the Mountain Men was standing in the cave. He looked at his men who had returned excitedly in confusion.

What were these idiots up to? They had already returned with excitement even though they had yet to capture a single human. Did they catch a beautiful woman or something?

The leader of the Mountain Men yelled angrily when he saw his men were back.

He grabbed a Mountain Woman and slammed her head on the ground before asking them what was going on.

The Mountain Woman responded with a wronged face, “Didn’t you tell us you had captured a bunch of humans and ask us to come back to the cave? You even said that whoever arrived first could enjoy the meal first!”

The leader of the Mountain Men spat on the Mountain Woman’s face.

“Idiot, since when did I give you such an order?” He had yet to capture a single human, let alone holding a feast for his men!

The Mountain Woman was utterly confused. If their leader did not give the order, who was it that dared to send them a false message?

The leader of the Mountain Men and the Mountain Woman heard the voice of a human above the cave while they were still feeling puzzled!

“Seal of Lava: Firefall!”

Mo Fan had plenty of time to Cast his spell. He took his time to complete a Super Fire Spell!

A magnificent burning gate appeared above the cave as soon as the Star Palace was constructed. Its doors slowly swung open, followed by scorching lava pouring down at the Mountain Men!

It was like a huge waterfall hanging under the blue sky, over which tons of red liquid were pouring down. The lava fell heavily onto the ground, and huge waves of flames began surging wildly!

The Mountain Men were standing under an enormous firefall of lava!
