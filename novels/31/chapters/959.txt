White Head Harbor...

A boat with neon lights and a bar on it was docked at the harbor. It was a relatively famous bar at White Head Harbor. The people in nearby cities often came to gather there.

On the deck was a table with eight chairs. It was currently seated with a man with an afro in a coat, and a man dressed in fancy clothes like a noble.

The afro man was smoking a cigar. A woman in a bunny outfit was serving him and massaging his shoulders. He placed his legs on the table, his boots stained with mud and blood within inches from the face of the man dressed in luxury clothes. He said with a smile, “Mayor Lauren, I thought we could easily come to a deal today. My brothers will soon become your loyal Magicians, but from what I know, some of my men were sent to prison by your subordinates a few days ago...”

“Didn’t you give me your word that your men would behave? They were arrested by a Hunter Master, he’s not my subordinate,” replied Lauren with a smile.

“I don’t care. I only have so many men, they are willing to listen to me because I care about them. But now, my men are imprisoned in your cells, and are going to be delivered to the Sacred Hall of Liberty. If I still proceed to make a deal with you despite what happened, how am I going to explain it to my men?” Casso said.

“It’s not really a big problem. I knew you’re going to ask for them, so in order to express our sincerity, I’ve already released them,” said Lauren.

“That’s more like it!” Casso smiled. The menacing look on his face faded away.

“Does that mean we’ve come to a deal?” Lauren asked.

“For now, I must see the revocation of the bounty on our heads first. After all, my men might have done some wrong things before. Without the revocation, the people of the Sacred Hall of Liberty and the Hunter Alliance will never stop troubling us. I don’t want to see anyone bringing the heads of my men to you, demanding rewards,” Casso demanded.

“The revocation won’t come any time soon.”

“That’s fine, I have plenty of time to wait. Besides, we aren’t really tired of what we used to do yet,” Casso smiled back.

Lauren’s face turned pale. He said in a softened voice, “Fine, I’ll try my best to request it for you, but the next Red Tide is coming soon...”

“Mayor, don’t you worry about that. Since I’m now the general of White Head City, I won’t let some little monsters disrupt the peace of our city, HAHAHA!” Casso burst out laughing.

Casso’s laugh was still echoing in the air when a Magician in a black outfit silently showed up beside Casso and whispered in his ears.

Casso frowned. His gaze immediately sharpened and glared at Lauren as he snapped furiously, “You better explain this!”

“Explain? Explain what?” Lauren asked with a confused face.

“If you’re thinking of baiting me here with your lies to get rid of me, I can assure you that the cities you are in charge of will be flowing with blood soon!” Casso promised in a heavy voice.

Mayor Lauren was stunned. He immediately glanced at the assistant beside him.

The woman seemed to have just received some news too. She quickly whispered into Mayor Lauren’s ear.

Mayor Lauren immediately came to a realization. He quickly donned a smile, “It’s truly a misunderstanding. We’ve known each other for many years, do you seriously not understand what I think? I’ll deal with them; you and your men can come on board first.”

“You better take care of it. If I have to do it, it won’t be so simple. I don’t care where they are from!” Casso said.

He blew a long whistle, signaling the members of the Red Ornaments Guild to board the boat.

The Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild obeyed Casso’s quickly, boarding the boat in groups and did not dare to move without receiving an order from their boss.

——

Mayor Lauren left the boat with a group of soldiers in dark blue uniforms. They headed for the shipyard.

“Defend this place,” Mayor Lauren ordered. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Battlemages in dark blue outfits immediately spread out and quickly sealed off the paths leading to the boat in a very efficient manner.

Mayor Lauren stood there with a dark face. His glittering eyes were staring at a group of young Magicians approaching the boat, breathing heavily.

“Stop right there! What do you think you’re doing here?” snapped Mayor Lauren coldly.

Shou Watani of the Japanese team was leading the young Magicians He noticed that the paths leading to the boat were guarded by soldiers in dark blue outfits.

Shou Watani was puzzled. Did the local government obtain the information, and was planning to take down the Red Ornaments Guild too?

“We...we are following the Sacred Hall of Liberty’s orders to annihilate the Red Ornaments Guild. Perhaps you have the same goal in mind too?” asked Shou Watani.

“Humph, since when do they need a bunch of kids to do their jobs? Just go back to where you’re from, this isn’t a place for you!” Lauren ordered.

Shou Watani was startled. He glanced at the black floating bar.

He believed his intel was accurate. He was confident that the people of the Red Ornaments Guild were right there on the huge boat. They could basically wipe out the Red Ornaments Guild if they could make their way to the boat. However, he never thought the local government would send soldiers to guard the place.

The one that gave them the mission was the Sacred Hall of Liberty, the most powerful Magic Association in the Americas. To avoid alerting the enemy, they did not even notify the local government. They were planning to tell the government once they were done with the operation.

But now, the government was protecting the boat that was packed with the members of the Red Ornaments Guild, preventing them from carrying out their operation!

“That’s quite a surprise, learning that the local government has a close relationship with a bunch of unforgivable criminals,” Nanyu mocked as she easily guessed the truth.

Mayor Lauren furrowed his brows. He was clearly displeased with the comment.

“Sir, I believe you know who the people on the boat are; please don’t intervene in our mission,” Shou Watani said.

Mayor Lauren harrumphed coldly, “I know who you are, but I’m warning you as the mayor of this city, the people on the boat have been recruited by White Head City as Battlemages. They are loyal servants of White Head City. You have no right to disturb them!”

“Recruit? What kind of joke is that? You’ve recruited a bunch of criminals that have been robbing your cities, towns, and villages?”

“You better leave at once. Otherwise, I’ll accuse you of interfering with public affairs. I won’t go easy on you!” Lauren declared firmly.

“Mayor, you must be Mayor Lauren. Your actions are quite an eye-opener. Don’t you think you’re compromising to the Red Ornaments Guild? How disappointed will the victims and their families be when they realize what you’ve done?” the Japanese girl in the blue sailor outfit snapped angrily.

“What do a bunch of students who live comfortably in an ivory tower know?” The mayor was infuriated.

“Do you think the Sacred Hall of Liberty will agree with you?”

“Sacred Hall of Liberty? Don’t even mention their name. If they really cared, they should have sent their Magicians and annihilated the sea monsters in the Caribbean Sea. However, they are simply enjoying their wines and food when our cities and towns are destroyed by the sea monsters when the season arrives. They only know to point their fingers around, but without me, this city would long have become a breeding ground for the sea monsters!” snapped Mayor Lauren.

“Either way, that doesn’t justify working together with those people that are worse than the sea monsters!” retorted Nanyu.

Mayor Lauren was too stubborn to listen to her.

Their country was not as developed as the countries from which the young Magicians came from, let alone the United States of America and its enormous Magic Association, the Sacred Hall of Liberty.

The number of their soldiers was very limited, and the budget of their government was nowhere enough.

There were many countries in the Caribbean, with different races and religions. However, most of the countries felt greatly threatened by the sea monsters, and as a governor of an impoverished country, the only possible solution was to recruit the Red Ornaments Guild.

The country had promised the Red Ornaments Guild a city in return for protection from the sea monsters. First, they would keep the criminals under control, and second, they would eliminate the threat of the sea monsters. It was a brilliant plan to regain peace in the country, albeit with risks involved.

As for the national teams, the mayor had no reason to receive them warmly!

“If we team up and eliminate the Red Ornaments Guild, wouldn’t that just solve the problem once and for all?” Shou Watani said angrily.

“I don’t need your help, leave at once! If you dare use magic on my territory and cause any damage or casualties, I will arrest you according to the laws of our country!” Lauren proclaimed mercilessly.

“Unbelievable, this is ridiculous, how can the government work with criminals? It’s the biggest taboo. Every country that did the same thing in history always resulted in rebellion!” snapped Nanyu.

The local government was unbelievably useless!

Not only did they not try their best to arrest the people of the Red Ornaments Guild, they even compromised with the bandits. Wouldn’t that simply provoke the bandits to act even more unruly?

They would simply be out of control!.
