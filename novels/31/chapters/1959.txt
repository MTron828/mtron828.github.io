“Look at the proud grin on your face. If this goes on for another few days, I bet you will even forget why you came to the Parthenon Temple in the first place,” Zhao Manyan could not help but scold Mo Fan.

“Stop being jealous, was there any progress?” Mo Fan shot right back.

“Lingling is as reliable as usual. She did find a convincing lead on the Night Amethyst, and interestingly enough, it’s in our homeland,” Zhao Manyan said.

“In our country? That’s great,” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“It’s not. Do you know where it is?” Zhao Manyan promptly shot him down.

Mo Fan remained silent. He knew it had to be somewhere extremely dangerous, based on Zhao Manyan’s tone and reaction.

There were quite a few dangerous places in their country, so much so that were infamous across the world. Mo Fan had not visited any of them since his cultivation was lacking in the past. However, he should not have trouble venturing deeper into them now.

“It’s f**king Tianshan Mountain!”

“THE f**king Tianshan Mountain?!”

“Yeah, that f**king Tianshan Mountain! I bet you’ve heard of the forbidden place called the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. The Night Amethyst we are looking for is inside it. It’s in complete darkness and is cold, like an icy Hell on earth. The demon creatures there are mostly mutated and powerful. It’s a place that dates back to the origin of the Totem Beasts and mankind!” Zhao Manyan groaned in disbelief.

The Scar of the Tianshan Mountain! Mo Fan had heard about it before. He remembered Chief Military Instructor Zhan Kong had some he had regretted left there. Even though he had made up for it now, he and his love were now separated by the living and the dead.

There were many infamous dangerous places and black zones in their country, but the Scar of the Tianshan Mountain was truly forbidden to humans. The people who went there either never came back, or would suddenly return after a few dozen years, having forgotten everything that had happened in the Scar.

Just like the people who did not return, they could not tell the world about what they had seen. It was a mysterious and terrifying place. There were many folk legends about it, and sayings that many had earned a name for themselves after claiming valuable treasure on the Tianshan Mountain. However, both the many brave adventurers who were buried under the snow and reputable legendary figures were not willing to mention anything that happened on the mountain!

“Speaking of Tianshan Mountain, I remember someone telling me that it’s where we should go if we want to learn the secrets of a certain Totem Beast,” Mo Fan thought aloud.

“Tianshan Mountain has been around for so long. It’s even described as a sacred mountain by the locals. I wouldn’t even be surprised to learn that there are a few Totem Beasts living on it, let alone some legends about the Totem Beasts!” Zhao Manyan agreed.

“Have you asked Jiang Shaoxu about it? Her brother Jiang Shaojun never mentioned the Totem Beast on Tianshan Mountain. If we have to go to Tianshan Mountain to look for some Night Amethyst, we might as well find the secrets of the Totem Beast too. I’ve long wanted to visit it!” Mo Fan declared.

There was no doubt that Tianshan Mountain had Totem Beasts. Mo Fan had read many ancient records. Even the records in Egypt and Greece mentioned a mysterious sacred mountain in the east, which obviously referred to Tianshan Mountain. As they gathered more Totem Seals and gradually formed the patterns of Totem Beasts, Mo Fan was eager to learn the real identity of the Totem Beast there. He needed a huge Totem Seal that would reveal the overall outline of the Totem Beast like its skeleton, and the answer currently lay on Tianshan Mountain!

Mo Fan could not remember who had mentioned the Tianshan Mountain to him, but he was told multiple times the Tianshan Mountain was the place to go if he was seeking the truth about Totem Beasts!

“You’re right, the clues about the Totem Beasts we have gathered so far don’t seem to match. It’s not reliable to let Jiang Shaoxu dole out clues by recalling memories of her brother. We will have to pay the Tianshan Mountain a visit,” Zhao Manyan nodded in agreement.

Zhao Manyan was extremely motivated whenever Totem Beasts were involved. He was glad they had decided to look for the Totem Beasts, as not only had it helped him become a Super Mage, he had also finally earned the old turtle’s approval. Zhao Manyan had finally felt the pleasure of having everything under his control during the battle at Xiamen. No wonder so many American dramas had superheroes. He must admit that being a superhero protecting the world felt insanely great. It was just as thrilling as hunting for beauties!

Zhao Manyan was willfully ignorant before. He always thought he would be satisfied living a peaceful life while spending money extravagantly. However, he had changed now. He wanted to be like Iron Man: spending money extravagantly, sleeping with gorgeous women across the world, and saving the world!

It was the biggest reason why he was so motivated to look for Totem Beasts. He could even worry about Mu Bai’s condition later. Everyone was eventually going to die. Mu Bai was just unlucky that he had died at such a young age. Zhao Manyan was willing to sleep with the women Mu Bai was supposed to sleep with on his behalf!

They departed for the Tianshan Mountain without any hesitation. They had to visit the local towns around it to collect more information.

The Dongfang Oriental Tower had the largest collection of information in their country, but information like Totem Beasts and the Night Amethyst that almost no one was interested in would barely travel the distance from the mountain to reach there.

They set out decisively, not returning to the Magic City or Fanxue Mountain first. They decided to meet up at Lhasa, the Capital of God, instead.

On the other side, Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu were already on their way from Fanxue Mountain after receiving the information.

Mo Fan said goodbye to Xinxia before he left.

Xinxia had always been busy. She only had the chance to keep Mo Fan company thanks to Norman.

Mo Fan had to go eventually. No matter how reluctant they were to part, they still had to work toward their respective goals.

“Brother Mo Fan, Little Flame Belle will be staying with me for now. I’ve looked around yesterday and learned that the main reason she wasn’t able to evolve fully is the restrictions of the Contract,” Xinxia said.

“Restrictions of the Contract? What do you mean?” Mo Fan was confused.

“It’s similar to the situation between you and little Apas. Her strength is currently suppressed by your Contract. The same thing is stopping Little Flame Belle from evolving into a Flame Belle Empress,” Xinxia said.

“You’re telling me that I’m dragging Little Flame Belle down?” Mo Fan asked in disbelief.

Xinxia giggled, “You could say that too.”

“Seriously? I’m a Super Mage with two Elements at the Super Level, yet I’m still dragging my Contracted Beast down?” Mo Fa’s face fell glumly.

Are you kidding me!?

Were his two Contracted Beasts trying to overthrow him? It was reasonable that Apas’ strength was suppressed by the Contract, since she was one of the inheritors to the throne of Queen Medusa, yet how was Little Flame Belle, who only knew how to slack off, eat snacks, and sleep making more progress than him too?

“Brother Mo Fan, don’t worry about it too much. You’re only a part of the reason. Little Flame Belle also needs a huge boost. If it’s going to take you a long time to collect the resources needed, I’ll lend you a hand. Besides, I can also strengthen her heart while I’m cultivating,” Xinxia told him firmly.
