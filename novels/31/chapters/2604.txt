Mu Ningxue’s eyes glittered. She was about to stand up when Mo Fan suddenly appeared beside her and placed his hand on her shoulder. Mu Ningxue put her hand on the back of Mo Fan’s hand.

She could feel his body heat. Mmm, he was not an Undead…

“Mo Fan!” “Mo Fan!” everyone in the room yelled.

“I bet none of you have told the newlyweds?” Mo Fan asked them calmly. “Not yet, we wouldn’t want to ruin their day,” Mui Shan acknowledged. “Well, I didn’t bring a gift, so I’ll deal with Mu Fangzhou and Fan Ning for them,” Mo Fan declared.

“I’ll go with you,” Mu Ningxue lifted her head.

Mu Fangzhou and Fan Ning were two of the strongest Mages of the Mu Clan. Mo Fan would have trouble taking them on by himself. Besides, Mo Fan had just come back. He had yet to even catch his breath. “I can handle it myself. All of you are the VIPs of this wedding. None of you should be absent, since it’s going to affect how the others will see you. As for me, I just happened to make it back in time. It’s fine if I’m a little late,” Mo Fan stated.

“Boss, we now have many strong Mages with us. I’ll ask them to go with you. We must teach those bastards that they shouldn’t mess with us! Mu Linsheng exclaimed.

“That won’t be necessary, I’ll be back soon,” Mo Fan said airily.

Mu Ningxue wanted to stand up, but Mo Fan held her down and kissed her forehead in front of everyone. “Just wait for me here,” he reassured her.

“Mm…”Mu Ningxue blushed.

Mui Shan, Mui Ye, and the elders of the Bai Clan were speechless. Did they have to display their affection in front of everyone? Why couldn’t young people be more mindful of others?

Mo Fan no longer had any trouble traveling great distances now that he had the Wings of Dawn and Dusk.

He crossed the mountains and arrived close to Beiyu Mountain

The Beiyu Enforcement Union no longer existed. The area was no longer a part of the Safe Zone, either. Mo Fan could hear the cries of demon creatures nearby.

Mo Fan did not alert the demon creatures while he was flying across their territory.

The competition between renowned clans had intensified after the Safe Zone shrank. The little clans had either joined the bigger clans, or were taken out. Only the powerful clans remained!

Fanxue Mountain was lucky enough to survive during the restructuring. Even though it was considered a powerhouse in Feiniao Headquarters City, it was still incomparable to renowned clans that had been around for a long time, like the Mu Clan and Zhao Clan.

The more limited human territory became the fiercer the competition would be. It was easy for conflicts to escalate into full-scale battles.

It was common for the clans to fight one another in order to survive, completely disregarding the laws. The Magic Association, Enforcement Union, government, and military were busy fending off the sea monsters. They had no time to mind the renowned clans’ business!

“What a pity, the clans you have sworn loyalty to are so ruthless. They weren’t even willing to negotiate with us. They have abandoned you in the cold wilderness!” Mu Fangzhou stood in front of a group of people dressed in gray outfits.

The people were restrained by a Plant Spell. Sharp thoms had stabbed into their skin. Their faces were brimming with anger and fear.

“Bury them, but don’t make it too bloody. Otherwise, people will say our clan is full of lunatics,” Fan Ning waved his hand to signal his men.

“This Luquan Mountain is now ours. We should be able to train many Super Water Mages with the resources here,” Mu Fangzhou agreed.

“You scum, you are going to pay for this! Bai Zangfeng yelled.

“Hah, it’s not our fault. The weak are always prey to the strong. It’s just how the world is. We might have gone on you before the sea monsters show up, but it’s either you being eaten by demon creatures or by humans in a time like this,” Mu Fangzhou pulled Bai Zangfeng’s hair and smashed his head into the mud

Bai Zangfeng’s face was soon covered in blood.

Mu Fangzhou was pressing Bai Zangfeng hard into the ground, making it difficult for him to breathe.

Bai Zangfeng struggled fiercely, but his cultivation was no match for Mu Fangzhou. He was being stepped on like a young puppy. “Clean it up. We’ll cut off their thumbs and send them to the Mui Clan as a gift for the wedding. HAHAHA, that b**ch Mui Nuxin deserves it for targeting our properties,” Mu Fangzhou snarled.

“It’s a pity that we didn’t get to take out Mu Ningxue, too. Otherwise, we could slowly take control of Feiniao Headquarters City!” Fan Ning nodded along. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“All of them will soon become our prey in a time like this. To be honest, I actually like the situation now. I no longer have to avoid the Enforcement Union and government and make sure no one knows the Mu Clan is responsible for the things I do!” “Everyone who dares to oppose us is going to die!” Fan Ning agreed heartily

They no longer needed to worry about reputation and humanism. Only the strong had the right to survive!

When there was a serious shortage of food, the deaths of the weak would make space for the others,

They had gone back to their primitive ways after they were no longer restrained by morality.

The Mu Clan could finally take out every faction that was opposing it. They would either surrender or die!

“As a matter of fact, I like the situation now too,” a voice suddenly came out of nowhere.

“Who is it!?

“Who’s there!?”

Mu Fangzhou and Fan Ning both looked in the same direction.

They were able to pinpoint the uninvited guest’s position right away with their outstanding cultivation. The others were still looking around searching for Mo Fan, who was hiding in the dark.

Mo Fan walked out of the darkness. His eyes were as cold as the moon!

“Mo Fan?” Mu Fangzhou was surprised when he recognized Mo Fan.

“It’s you! Shouldn’t you be dead? Fan Ning chuckled.

“I thought it was some formidable enemy, yet it’s just a petty clown. If this time had come earlier, you and Mu Ningxue would have died on Mu Clan Mountain!” Mu Fangzhou declared.

“Fangzhou, he has Double Innate Elements,” Fan Ning quickly reminded him.

Mu Fangzhou’s eyes immediately glittered like a weasel.
