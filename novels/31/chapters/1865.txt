Mu Bai noticed not many people were on duty when they arrived at the South Wing Platoon. After all, it was only established recently, and most people were not full-time staff, so there were not many people around.

“Chief Mu, what’s going on?” a Maga who worked as a signaller at the headquarters blurted out.

“She seems to be under some kind of curse. We need to transfuse fresh blood into her,” Mu Bai told the Maga.

“Oh... alright, got it!”

The headquarters of the South Wing Platoon did have some medical supplies for emergency purposes. Mu Bai had no choice but to take matters into his own hands since there were no reliable Healers around.

“Mu Xumian, listen to me, tell me what ate in the past three days,” Mu Bai placed the woman on a sickbed and asked sternly.

“I...I don’t remember, the pain, it hurts so much!” Mu Xumian held her stomach. Fresh blood kept pouring out of her mouth even when she tried to cover it. She was struggling to speak properly. She could only stare at Mu Bai with eyes filled with pain, like a dying person begging for help! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mu Bai looked at Mu Xumian. Her face was so pale that he could see the nerves and veins on it. How did she suddenly become like this when she was perfectly fine just a moment ago?

“What happened? What’s going on?” Li Kai rushed into the room and immediately saw Mu Xumian struggling on the sickbed. He immediately charged at Mu Bai like a wild beast when he saw Mu Xumian’s miserable condition.

“What did you do to her!?” Li Kai snarled.

“How we treat her in the next fifteen minutes is going to decide whether she’s going to live or not. If you really care about her, you should let go of your hand and call the City North’s Healer here,” Mu Bai said coldly.

Li Kai realized how serious the situation was. He ran out of the building after glaring at Mu Bai for a moment.

Two minutes later, the signaller arrived with a young woman in a white outfit. She was surprised when she saw the insane amount of blood on the sickbed.

“Did she cut her artery?” the young woman asked.

Mu Bai glanced at the woman and realized she had just graduated recently. She was still wearing the badge of a student of an institution from Hangzhou.

“You’re a Healer?” Mu Bai asked.

“I am, she has lost a lot of blood. We should replenish her blood first,” the young woman said.

“The chief has already done it, but it will take the newly transfused blood some time to circulate in the body. It won’t be quick enough compared to the rate she’s vomiting blood,” the signaller said.

“I’ll cast the Healing Spirit on her for now...” the graduate went up to Mu Xumian and placed her hand on Mu Xumian’s forehead. Light in the shape of leaves began to light up around the graduate.

Pa! Mu Bai slapped the graduate’s hand away. The graduate stared at her reddened hand with a blank face before she snapped, “What are you doing!?”

“Didn’t your teacher ever warn you that you shouldn’t use your Healing Magic before you are sure of the patient’s injuries?” Mu Bai scolded her.

“Am I the Healer or are you?” the graduate snapped angrily. She felt like she was being humiliated.

Mu Bai ignored her. He took out a tiny silkworm from a small box.

The silkworm dug into Mu Xumian’s skin. They could see it moving inside Mu Xumian’s arm to her stomach.

Half a minute later, Mu Xumian started vomiting again. The silkworm was in the pool of blood this time. It landed on the ground and tried to climb its way back into Mu Bai’s box, but it died instead.

“Poison?” the graduate asked curiously while inspecting the silkworm that had been used to probe the injuries.

“It’s not,” Mu Bai shook his head.

“Curse?” the graduate asked again.

“The symptoms are similar, but Curse Magic wouldn’t affect my Blood Silkworm,” Mu Bai shook his head again.

The graduate glanced at the dead silkworm on the floor again. She now understood why Mu Bai did not let her use the Healing Magic right away.

The Healing Magic actually worked by helping the tissues fix the damage ten or a hundred times quicker than its usual speed. It was like a catalyst that would boost a body’s self-recovery ability.

However, it was inappropriate to use Healing Magic when someone was poisoned or Cursed. For example, if a poisonous parasite had merged with its host, the Healing Magic would only serve as a catalyst that would make the parasite grow several times faster, which would speed up the patient’s death instead.

The Blood Silkworm was a special creature that Poison Mages raised. When a Healer could not inspect the conditions inside of a patient’s body with their hands, the little creature was the best way to do so. It could determine if there were any blood clots in the patient’s body, whether the patient was poisoned, or if there were fractures, dead cells, or organs...

If the Blood Silkworm did not make it out alive, the patient was most likely poisoned.

If the Blood Silkworm was perfectly fine, it meant the person was under a Curse, since the Curse would only target its victim.

It was extremely difficult to determine the exact cause this time, since the Blood Silkworm had died after coming out of the patient’s body, but either way, it was still inappropriate to use Healing Magic!

Mu Bai knelt down and picked up the dead Blood Silkworm. He was eager to know how the creature died. What harmful substance did it encounter? Did a parasite in the woman’s body kill it? However, after inspecting the Blood Silkworm, Mu Bai only discovered a strange mark on the creature. The blood was clean, too.

The graduate and the signaller remained silent, not daring to make a single sound. Mu Xumian was also not willing to die just like that. She was hanging on with all her might by withholding the urge to vomit her blood. She had no clue if it was going to help, but it was better than puking her life out!

“Is there anyone with the Light Element in the South Wing Platoon? I want someone with a strong purifying ability!” Mu Bai asked the signaller after inspecting the Blood Silkworm.

“We do, Captain Pan is a Light Mage.”

“Call him over, and have him use the Sacred Chant: Purify on her!” Mu Bai ordered.

“Isn’t the Sacred Chant only effective against the undead?” The graduate was dumbfounded.
