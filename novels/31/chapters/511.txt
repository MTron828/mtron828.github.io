“Such an annoying Electric Field, my Ferocious Ant Scorpion can’t get close to him!”

Dongfang Ming was anxious now.

Back at Hangzhou, he had been destroyed by this guy’s fourth-tier Basic Spell. Now that he was being challenged by him in a ranking battle, he felt like the fight was even harder!

Dongfang Ming had purposely traded his Wing Equipment for an outstanding suit of armor to prepare himself for the duel, as it served as a guarantee that he would be able to face Mo Fan’s Basic Spell.

However, not only did Mo Fan not use his Fire Spell, he had used his fourth-tier Lightning Strike to create an Electric Field. Dongfang Ming’s second Element was the Summoning Element, yet it was completely useless against Mo Fan!

His Ferocious Ant Scorpion was a unique Summoned Beast.

The fighting ability of a single Ferocious Ant Scorpion was similar to that of a Servant-class creature, but even a Warrior-level creature would have to back off when fighting against a pack of Ferocious Ant Scorpions.

Dongfang Ming’s Contracted Beast was the Ferocious Ant Scorpion Warrior. Its strength was nothing outstanding, but he was able to summon more than twenty of them at once to attack his target.

It was basically Dongfang Ming’s trump card, one that he had prepared specifically to fight against Mo Fan...

Unfortunately, he did not realize that Mo Fan was not afraid of a group fight.

The fourth-tier Lightning Strike was basically a tiny Domain. Mo Fan was able to abuse the Electric Field to prevent himself from being flanked back when he fought the Giant Lizards. The number of the Ferocious Ant Scorpions was not as great as the Giant Lizards, hence there was no reason for Mo Fan to be afraid!

“The nineteenth rank is mine!” A smile blossomed on Mo Fan’s face.

“Thunderbolt!”

He pointed his finger at the sky, triggering a thunderbolt to descend out of nowhere and strike Dongfang Ming’s ocean blue armor.

The lightning blasted the thick armor open. Arcs splintered into the surroundings. Dongfang Ming’s height somehow shortened; he turned out to have dropped to his knees from the overwhelming impact!

Dongfang Ming’s legs were trembling badly. The armor had already blocked a few Lightning Strikes for him, and had finally gone over its limit. The energy of the lightning penetrated his body through the gaps of the armor. He could feel his bones almost falling apart!

He could not accept his defeat. Dongfang Ming initially thought he could redeem himself from the humiliation he had suffered in Hangzhou, yet he had lost once again!

The truth was, Dongfang Ming had an innate talent, which allowed him to draw Star Patterns for the Fire Element twice as fast as ordinary Magician. It was a huge advantage for him, which together with his rich background was enough to secure him a spot in the top three in Pearl Institute. However, he was stuck at rank nineteen instead.

After losing the battle, he had no choice but to hand over his nineteenth rank. Meanwhile, his rank dropped all the way to forty-fifth!

“That lazy prick lost, just as I thought,” smiled a young man in the spectator seats.

“Dongfang Lie, how long will it take for you to defeat this Double Innate Elements guy?” said Zhou Shuming beside him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Dongfang Lie raised his head as if he were in a deep thought. A few seconds later, he finally spoke up, “Based on what he has shown until now... probably one or two rounds of attacks.”

Zhou Shuming was startled, before he burst out laughing and tapped Dongfang Lie on the shoulder, “I’ll remember that.”

“It doesn’t mean anything, since there are a few more behind me who he can’t surpass. I don’t think you’ll see me defeating him anytime soon,” said Dongfang Lie.

“True, but I have something to tell you, related to this Double Innate Elements kid,” said Zhou Shuming.

“Oh?” Dongfang Lie raised his eyebrows.

“He has taken a provisional spot,” said Zhou Shuming mysteriously.

“The selection hasn’t started yet. How could he possibly get a spot?” Dongfang Lie was not too happy at the news.

Even with his strength, he was not qualified to get a provisional spot. There was no way this Double Innate Elements guy was able to do so!

“Councilman Zhu Meng, the Lingyin Enforcement Union, and Hangzhou’s City Council all recommended him. I only heard about it coincidentally,” said Zhou Shuming.

“Sounds like a big shot.”

“Not really, I’ve already investigated his background. He was only extremely lucky to help Hangzhou resolve a plague. The Enforcement Union is inclined to recommend him as a candidate for the Huang Ranking. If there isn’t any young Magician that has a higher achievement than him, he’s most likely going to enter,” said Zhou Shuming.

Dongfang Lie finally withdrew his scornful attitude. He glanced at Mo Fan, who was walking down from the dueling ground.

The Huang Ranking! This guy was a provisional candidate of the Huang Ranking?!

There were many talented young Magicians in a country, and most of them went to different famous schools in different places. Normally, it was difficult for them to get the chance to fight against one another. Therefore, how would people evaluate their talents?

Each Element in the schools had their own rankings, while some had rankings for the entire school. Meanwhile, the Hunter Union had the Hunter Ranking...

These rankings were only applicable to their respective environments. It was not enough to become the standard for evaluating one’s strength. As a result, the Magic Associations across the five continents had constructed four rankings, designed through precise filtering and evaluation!

The four World Rankings, which were translated into: Tian, Di, Xuan, and Huang!

The Tian Ranking, Di Ranking, and Xuan Ranking consisted of experts from different levels. Most of the Magicians listed on these rankings had wide reputations and outstanding strength. Mu Dao, whom Shi Gua had sworn his loyalty to, was a Magician of the Xuan Ranking. Even without any title, his status was on par with a Councilman.

The Huang Ranking, on the other hand, was for young Magicians.

Protecting the Underground Holy Spring during Bo City’s calamity, wiping out the Black Vatican in Shanghai, and resolving the plague of Hangzhou City; Mo Fan was involved, and even played a critical role in all of them.

The Huang Ranking would update once every four years, and the Magician recommended to be listed on the Huang Ranking in the China region was... Mo Fan!

Basically, Mo Fan already had a spot reserved in the World College Tournament. Most importantly, his name was submitted to the National Magic Association, and after going through the Asia Continent Magic Association, his name would be listed on the Huang Ranking.

Mo Fan was pretty much a grass-roots Magician. He would never learn about the four World Rankings if no one told him about them.

To an extent, he would not even know he was already quite famous among the young Magicians in the country. Once the announcement regarding the change of Huang Ranking was made, even those from other countries would learn about him.

Both Zhou Shuming and Dongfang Lie considered themselves among the top talents among young Magicians in the country. They were eagerly anticipating taking part in the World College Tournament and entering the Huang Ranking. When they learned the guy with Double Innate Elements had already secured a spot in both of them, it was difficult for them to laugh at him anymore!
