Frankly speaking, if Miyata showed up again, Mo Fan would not hesitate to give her Guan Yu’s name.

Everything was already perfect if he could spend the night with Mu Ningxue in the same room, yet this guy had to come and disturb them. If it wasn’t him, perhaps in two years, their kid would be old enough to buy some soy sauce from the grocery store...

Mo Fan was nodding off, sitting close to the window. The trip on the sea had been extremely tiring, especially for someone who had not gotten used to being tossed back and forth by the waves. It would take a few days to recover.

However, whenever Mo Fan closed his eyes, he would remember the evil grin under Miyata’s innocent face. He had trouble clearing it from his mind.

Mo Fan sat there and quietly watched Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue had her eyes closed. She seemed to be meditating. The girl was really something, still having the mood to cultivate despite knowing Zhao Manyan’s condition.

Looking at her smooth face, Mo Fan realized that her slightly curved eyelashes were quite attractive. He could not help but stare at them longer. However, his focus was soon attracted by her graceful breasts. It was surely a pair of bouncy, firmly beautiful mountains. Her thin clothing and undergarment were not enough to conceal the scenic view.

Below the mountains were a long, slim waist which Mo Fan could wrap around with half his arm. He could not help but wonder what hugging her waist would feel like?

As he further lowered his gaze, he immediately saw the girl’s curves from her upright sitting posture. The curves were not just between her buttocks and her legs, but the elegant lines between her waist and pelvic bones. It was just perfect, without any sign of excess flesh. Her gentle curves and boniness were somehow alluring. Her silver hair dangling to the side was eye-catching even though it was slightly disheveled.

Such a gorgeous beauty! If the asshole Guan Yu wasn’t around, he would have the urge to pounce on her. It was necessary to act first and report later in many cases. The chance to go on a honeymoon with Mu Ningxue for more than a year was hard to come by. In Mo Fan’s opinion, he strongly believed that he would be a disgrace to his identity as a pervert if he failed to make Mu Ningxue pregnant during this time!

If a pervert did not have an ambition, how different was he from a gentleman?

Nothing happened for the rest of the night apart from the rustling of leaves outside. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mo Fan and Guan Yu did not fall asleep for the whole night. Glancing out of the window, they could see a corner of the sea lit up by the rising sun. The waves were like pieces of colorful cloth, resulting in a beautiful scene.

Mo Fan rose to his feet and stretched.

He walked up to Mu Ningxue and nudged her, to let her know it was daybreak.

“It seems like we’ve made a mistake, I think...Mu Ningxue...Mu Ningxue? Mu Ningxue!” Mo Fan nudged the girl again.

Mo Fan initially thought Mu Ningxue was still meditating, hence he tried to wake her up. To his surprise, Mu Ningxue did not open her eyes, even after the second nudge.

Mo Fan felt his heart skipped a beat. He quickly touched her forehead.

Ice cold!

Mu Ningxue’s forehead was icy. Even though she normally had an icy aura too, Mo Fan knew it did not necessarily mean her face and body were ice cold!

She was in the same condition as Zhao Manyan, her body temperature had fallen.

Mo Fan opened her eyelids and saw her pupils covered by a layer of grayness. She did not react even when he blew into her eye.

“Go, tell the others!” said Mo Fan sternly as he glanced at Guan Yu who was feeling drowsy.

“Did she lose her soul too?” Guan Yu was astounded. He quickly checked Mu Ningxue’s condition.

The situation escalated when Guan Yu learned Mu Ningxue’s condition. He glared at Mo Fan, as if he was blaming it all on him. He quickly left to wake the others.

—

Mo Fan was left alone in the room. Mu Ningxue remained in her sitting posture, yet somehow her life force had frozen. She did not wake up no matter how hard Mo Fan tried.

Mo Fan clenched his fists when he saw Mu Ningxue’s condition. His chest pulsed heavily with anger!

That Miyata, he would never forgive her!

Nan Rongni came not long after. After checking Mu Ningxue’s condition, she concluded that Mu Ningxue was in the same condition as Zhao Manyan. Their bodies were ice cold, and they had lost consciousness. According to the residents, they had lost their souls.

“Were both of you keeping an eye on her all the time?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

“I...I might have taken a little nap just before daybreak. I was too tired,” said Guan Yu softly.

“I have been watching her the whole night. Nothing happened, the girl did not even show up in the room,” said Mo Fan confidently.

“Two of you will stay and look after her. The rest should split up,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“I didn’t expect us to encounter something so strange just after we arrived in Japan,” said Nanyu.

“There must be a reason behind every strange incident. Guan Yu, Li Kaifeng, look for the monks who had left the temple for the ritual. They must know the reason behind it if they have been living here for a long time. Mo Fan, Jiang Shaoxu; Nanyu and I will look for the girl. I don’t care what she is, there must be a way to cure them. Jiang Yu, Mu Tingying, the rest of you will ask for information in the city. Find anything you can that’s related to the temple!” said Ai Jiangtu.

Two members of the team had fallen victim. No one had expected the situation to be so serious.

The good news was, they found out that the girl Miyata that Mo Fan mentioned was responsible for it. They would soon find the answers after locking her down.

“We should look around the back of the mountain. I believe there’s some secret there,” said Mo Fan.

The others had already checked the temple, yet they did not find any clue. The girl must be staying somewhere. The back of the mountain was suspicious for sure!

——

The rest of the team immediately split up. Mo Fan, Jiang Shaoxu, Ai Jiangtu and Nanyu proceeded to the back of the mountain. They found an abandoned path. It seemed like someone had been here in the past...

The woods at the back of the mountain were fairly thick. As they continued along the path, they even discovered stone lamps on both sides of the track. They could still see a marble path after clearing the weeds and soil covering the top of it.

“Mo Fan, I don’t understand. If she can really kidnap their souls without us knowing, why didn’t she target all of us at once? Why did she have to learn their names from you? Are the names that important?” asked Nanyu.

“I can’t figure it out either. Damn it, if only the monk was still here. He can see the girl too; he definitely knows more about her,” cursed Mo Fan.

The young bald donkey was not at the temple either. It definitely gave Mo Fan a huge headache!
