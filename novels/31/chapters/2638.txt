“Did I find myself a Kun? It does look like one…” Zhao Manyan suddenly suspected.

{TL Note: A Kun Peng is a mythical sea monster. }

Getting a Kun right at the start of the game; it only needs to eat to evolve!

Asa matter of fact, the creature ate a lot, and it would grow whenever it ate.

While Mo Fan was retrieving the mysterious feathers, this creature had eaten countless boiled Sharkmen eggs, and had grown significantly in size. Sharp bone spikes were starting to emerge across its body now.

Zhao Manyan recalled how the creature had been knocked flying by a single slap from the Dark Iron Sharkman. The Dark-Skinned Sharkman Beast and the Dark Iron Sharkman were of the same level, but it had just eaten the Dark-Skinned Sharkman Beast in an eyeblink!

It could now eat Commander-level creatures in mere seconds!

Most importantly, it had only been born recently. Its rate of growth was insane!

Zhao Manyan was now even more curious about its species.

He had first thought it was the infant of a high-level Sharkman, but it had been acting like the Sharkmen were the most delicious food in the world. It treated them like meat buns!

Zhao Manyan decided to name the creature. “Forget it, you no longer look like an infant now. I’ll call you Little Blue Kun!” 2

He remembered how a dazzling advertisement for a web game had once gotten his attention by saying he would be given an ancient Kun as soon as he registered an account. It also claimed the beast would only have to eat to grow stronger!

But in the end, Zhao Manyan had to constantly pay up throughout the game to make any progress. The beast did not grow through eating; it had grown through paying more money. The more money he spent, the stronger it became!

For some reason, when he saw how gluttonous Little Blue Kun was, Zhao Manyan had a feeling he was being tricked by that shameless video game publisher again.

On second thought, he realized it actually was not a big deal.

If Mo Fan were to take care of Little Blue Kun, he might end up a little worm in the end. On the other hand, he was the son of the richest man in the country. Once he reclaimed the power in his family, why would he have trouble raising a little Kun?

No matter how much he ate, could he possibly eat up all the money that the Zhao Family had?

Ihave plenty of money. Eat whatever you want, as long as you will become stronger!

The pipes were quite large, and the filters and pumps inside them had long stopped operating, Mo Fan and his crew swam into the pipes, escaping from the Sharkmen.

‘They swam up to the surface of the lake after most of the Sharkmen headed after Zhao Manyan.

“Mo Fan, Mo Fan!” Lingling’s voice reached them through their communication devices.

There was no signal deeper in the lake. Their coms only started working again when they were closer to the surface. The devices had been improved, so low-level demon creatures would not detect the signal.

“What is it? We found the things left by the Mysterious Feathers Totem Beast. We are on the way out. The Sharkmen are treating this place as a breeding ground to raise their army,” Mo Fan reported to Lingling.

“You can’t leave yet. I’ve just done a geographical analysis of the area. If I’m not mistaken, there’s an Earth Pistil close to where you are, and it’s of the Fire Element!” Lingling informed him eagerly.

“An Earth Pistil!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

The Earth Pistils were the single most valuable treasure nature had given to humans. Without the support of Earth Pistils, it was impossible to establish a Barrier that protected against demon creatures around a city.

Mo Fan recalled how international organizations, renowned clans, local governments, and many associations had competed fiercely in Taklamakan Desert just for an Earth Pistil that was close to depletion. Countless people had died because of it!

On top of that, many hordes of demon creatures had a great desire for Earth Pistils, too. Every Earth Pistil that was discovered would result in a terrifying war between the hordes and tribes!

“Was the Earth Pistil used to protect the city?” Jiang Shaoxu asked sharply.

“No, the Earth Pistil guarding the city has already been taken away. This Earth Flame Pistil was never discovered. The feathers might have retained their energy despite being left in the water for so long because they absorbed a portion of the Earth Pistil’s energy!” Lingling conjectured.

“Lingling, are the people of Lanyang immune to the Low Body Temperature Disease because the water they normally drank was cooked by the Earth Flame Pistil over a long time?” Xinxia asked quickly.

Mo Fan had discovered the mysterious feathers, but they were not the cure for the Low Body Temperature Disease, nor had they found the reason why the people of Lanyang were immune to the disease.

“Yes, the Earth Flame Pistil is extremely important. The Sharkmen have sharper senses than we do. They discovered the Earth Flame Pistil first, which is why they took over the city!” Lingling confirmed.

“No wonder they didn’t seem to hate me after I took the Feathers. There’s something more important down there!” Mo Fan muttered aloud.

‘There was an Earth Pistil hidden down below!

An Earth Flame Pistil could maintain the temperature of an entire city, even in the current extreme weather. The people there would not catch the Low Body Temperature Disease if they stayed within its Barrier!

“Lingling, do you know its rough location?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“Ican’t confirm its location, but you might be able to use the Feathers of the Totem Beast as a clue,” Lingling proposed.

“Alright, we are no longer in a rush to leave, but the Sharkmen have already seen us. We have to be more careful,” Mo Fan sighed.

“Alot more Sharkmen are coming to this city now. I’l update you when I know more. I’l let you know if the Sharkman Chieftains are here. You must leave at once if they arrive!” Lingling said.

“Got it, we’ll be careful,” Mo Fan agreed quickly.

‘The water pressure was very strong deeper in the lake. Zhao Manyan had to use higher-level spells just to protect himself. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Little Blue Kun was a sea creature. It was able to move freely in the water without being affected by the harsh conditions.

Speaking of which, where the Hell are we now? Wasn’t there a current down here? Why have I not seen the exit?, Zhao Manyan thought.

The strange thing was, it was supposed to be dark in the underwater cave, but his surroundings were being lit up by an unknown light source. It was rather dazzling, like it was currently dusk.. On the other hand, it was also eerily quiet.

‘Okay, I was wrong, not a cachalot… Keep forgetting there are fantastic beasts here!
