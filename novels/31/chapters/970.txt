The team arrived at Mexico’s Training Hall. As a matter of fact, one could easily guess the strength of a national team by looking at the representatives of the defending team at a country’s Training Hall. Mexico was a fairly strong team, providing some resistance when the team was trying to secure the stamp. The team still managed to secure it in the end, leading them one step closer to Venice.

After Mexico, their next destination was the United States of America.

The United States of America was one of the super countries. It would be a great challenge to win the stamp from the USA’s Training Hall.

One of the Five Continents Magic Associations, the highest Magic Association of the Americas, was the Sacred Hall of Liberty located in New York City. It was truly a sacred hall of the Magic Civilization, and the Mages in the Sacred Hall of Liberty were referred to as Sacred Hall Mages, respected and admired by many people of the world. Joining the Sacred Hall of Liberty was one of their greatest ambitions for many mages!

The USA Training Hall was located on Liberty Island, the same place as the Sacred Hall of Liberty. After the team successfully acquired the stamp from Mexico, everyone on the team was interested in visiting the magic sacred hall, and witnessing the grandeur of the most advanced magic civilization in the world.

After arriving in New York, the team headed straight for the Sacred Hall of Liberty. They immediately saw the spectacular Statue of Liberty while they were standing along the shore. The sacred light, a mix of blue and golden emitted by the statue, urged them to kneel and bow before it.

The aura of the statue was beyond the team’s imagination. It felt like a living Greek goddess was standing there, glancing down at her people with her light of freedom and a calm, peaceful gaze!

“Don’t tell me the whole Statue of Liberty is actually the Sacred Hall of Liberty?” Mo Fan glanced at the statue of the goddess and immediately recalled the feeling he had when he saw the Skyscraping Snake for the first time. It was like a skyscraper in the night mist.

Similarly, the statue of the goddess was about the size of a skyscraper. According to the information on hand, the Sacred Hall of Liberty was right here; the statue was the Sacred Hall of Liberty, and the inside of the statue was the magic sacred hall!

The bottom of the statue was similar to the Oriental Pearl Tower, with tourist attractions, a museum, a gallery...

The team took the lift inside the statue. After reaching a certain level, they arrived at the Hall of Mages.

The Hall of Mages was located around the waist of the statue, and consisted of seven floors in total, with all kinds of facilities. The Mages could enter different halls based on their levels.

The team took different lifts in the Hall of Mages to the neck of the statue. It was where the Sacred Hall Mages stayed, the actual Sacred Hall of Liberty.

The Sacred Hall of Liberty did not allow visitors. Only certain groups of people were allowed to enter. The national teams did not really have the chance to tour the Sacred Hall of Liberty. Despite that, they were quite astounded by how marvelous it was from just brief glances.

It was impressive how they had turned the Statue of Liberty into a building. Only the greatest Magic Civilization was able to accomplish such an astounding deed. The Saint Paul Cathedral in England that had existed for the longest time was regarded as the greatest Magic Association of the five continents, but the Sacred Hall of Liberty was the real boss among the Five Continental Magic Associations.

When the Chinese team arrived on the Liberty Island, the Sacred Hall Mage Oleena Rivers made deliberate time to come to receive Mo Fan at the square under the Statue of Liberty.

Oleena was still wearing the same black and gold outfit, with a hint of the flamboyance and aloofness of Northern Europeans. She smiled slightly when she saw Mo Fan.

The student had done her a great favor. They had escorted Casso back to the Sacred Hall of Liberty to be judged and sentenced. The Sacred Hall of Liberty also complimented Oleena for doing a great job.

“I’ll bring you to the Training Hall. Strictly speaking, I was half an instructor there, too,” Oleena volunteered.

“Sure, why don’t you ask your students to go easy on us considering how much of a favor you owed me?” Mo Fan smiled.

A young man with sharp eyes showed up and said disdainfully, “Humph, go easy? Are all Chinese the same? Trying to enter through the backdoor with their connections?”

“He’s my brother, Fred, a representative of the Training Hall. You guys can be friends,” Oleena smiled apologetically. She introduced the young man with long brown hair in a friendly manner.

Just like Oleena, her brother Fred had light blue, amber-like eyes. Even though his facial features were not even half as handsome as Mo Fan, many Chinese girls would surely be fascinated by his eyes. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Even though you two are brother and sister, the difference between you is pretty big, in terms of politeness and courtesy...” Mo Fan fearlessly returned the favor when he saw how arrogant Fred was.

“To be honest, I’m usually like him too. I’m not always polite to strangers,” Oleena admitted.

“Does that mean I’m special?” Mo Fan raised his brows. His eyes had a flirtatious look in them.

Fred could not stand it any longer. The man was flirting with his sister right in front of him. Did he want to die!?

Their mother was no longer around. The relationship between him and his sister was rather complicated. Even though he was not over-reliant on his sister, he still could not bear a man he was not fond of trying to win his sister’s affection.

In Fred’s eyes, Mo Fan was clearly a great eyesore, especially his slacking temperament and the way he dressed, and that sallow, uncaring face... most hilariously, he was asking the representatives of their Training Hall to go easy on them!

“Listen up, there’s no way our Training Hall is going to go easy on you noobs! Taking down the Red Ornaments Guild and challenging our Training Hall are two different things. There’s no way we will give our stamp to an unskilled bunch, it’s a disgrace to our stamp!” Fred swore furiously to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan glanced at Oleena when he saw how Fred was overreacting.

Oleena seemed to be used to it, and remained silent. Mo Fan chuckled and said, “Your brother gets jealous really easily.”

“Yeah, I bet he wants me to stay single for the rest of my life, so I can always take care of him,” Oleena giggled.

Fred was immediately infuriated and embarrassed by their words!

Even though what they said was actually his thinking, it was humiliating that a man in his twenties was still dependent on his sister. In America, if a kid after the age of six kept mentioning what their mothers told them, they would be laughed at and humiliated by their classmates!

Fred’s gaze sharpened as he stared at Mo Fan. Even though he was not saying anything, Mo Fan could easily read the man’s thoughts: You’re dead if you fight me in the duels!

When they first entered the USA Training Hall, the observant Jiang Shaoxu immediately saw a huge wall covered by the flags of different countries.

Besides the flags were different dates, with a giant cross after each of them!

“What’s this?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“It’s the countries that challenged us,” Oleena explained calmly.

“Does the cross mean they have failed? Are you kidding me? The whole wall is filled with crosses. Doesn’t that mean the team is on a long winning streak?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

USA’s Training Hall was obviously stronger than countries that were above average. The team suddenly felt a strong pressure from the USA’s Training Hall.

“Keep flipping the pages, there are all crosses too!” Fred said proudly.

The eyes of the team almost fell out from widening too much in astonishment.

Zhao Manyan started scrolling through the pages in disbelief. He flipped the pages up and saw many countries had come to challenge the Training Hall, yet none of them had a green tick!

“Not a single country has won after so long, that’s...that’s unbelievable!” Jiang Yu exclaimed.

Not a single team had won against USA’s Training Hall, meaning that the team defending the Training Hall did not have a single loss!

The team at the Training Hall were only substitutes for the national team, so it was shocking that so many national teams had lost to them. It immediately increased the pressure on the shoulders of the already-nervous Chinese team!

“Speaking of which, I understand why these countries have a cross on them, since they all failed the challenge, but why is there a cross at the very end, behind today’s date, and our country’s flag, too?” said Jiang Shaoxu.

Fred lowered his head and smiled, “Perhaps the captain knew you guys were coming, so he immediately filled in the date and the result so he wouldn’t need to do it again later... the captain is the kind of person that gets angry if you waste even five seconds of his time!”

“Aren’t you guys a bit too full of yourselves?” Jiang Yu wondered aloud.

Fred shrugged and said, “You can simply look at the list. So many countries that are stronger than yours have failed to win the stamp. Do you seriously think you have a chance?”

“It’s not about the result, but the fact that you’ve drawn a cross before the duels is extremely disrespectful!” Nanyu said.

“Respect? Only strong teams deserve to be respected, don’t you agree? Oh, I almost forgot, your country likes being humble. I’m sorry, our people have trouble learning how to be humble, since it’s totally unnecessary,” Fred shot back.

“...”

Oleena did not comment on it. Everyone on the team defending the USA’s Training Hall was the same. After all, only those that were extremely talented in this powerful country were chosen to represent the Training Hall!.
