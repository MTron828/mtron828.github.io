Chapter 2839: The Three Medusa Sisters

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“She’s my older sister.” Apas woke up from her dreams and warned Mo Fan.

‘Yuri Ellie was the Eagle Witch that sold human skins at Holy City!’ thought Mo Fan. ‘So, it was her!’

Mo Fan had stolen Yuri Ellie’s eye—The Eye of Deception—to enter the sanctuary at Holy City. Even though the Eye of Deception could only be used for a limited number of times, it was one of the world’s rare wonders. Mo Fan had long added it to his personal collection!

He had never expected to bump into his creditor on this day. If Mo Fan had not run into Yuri Ellie, he would have never recalled that he had gouged the Eye of Deception from a wicked witch in the past.

Mo Fan heard a cough. “So, this kid is the one who stole my younger sister’s eye. What a handsome oriental boy! We’ll catch him, turn him into a human specimen, and then put him in the back garden. It will be such fun!” A charming voice rose from the other slope of the White Tomb Palace.

Mo Fan looked in that direction, only to find a woman with venomous snake hair, staring at him. The woman’s body did not resemble a snake. She had a garnet red scorpion body. She was in glass heels with her razor sharp and slender legs. She continued to swing her tail into the sky, as if the tail itself had its own life…

Trishina was the eldest daughter of the mother of Medusa. She was a mixed blood from the mother of Medusa and the Scorpion King. Trishina possessed Medusa’s powerful mental power as well as the Scorpion King’s strong physique.

Mo Fan did not expect to find them there. Even Apas had never thought of running into her two older sisters at the White Tomb Palace.

“I heard that my younger sister has been serving you all this while. Can you ask her to come out? It’s been a long time since we’ve met. How nostalgic…”

Trishina was calm and relaxed. She stood there gracefully. But the pride that came from within her bones was clearly visible on her demonic face.

Apas revealed herself. She stood beside Mo Fan. Her golden-pink eyes carried a hint of fury. She suppressed her anger and projected an intense icy cold aura that belonged to the Queen of Medusa.

The Queen of Scorpion and Eagle Witch roared when Apas showed up. The two demons’ eyes turned golden-pink within an instant. All of them were siblings. However, Trishina and Yuri Ellie’s mothers were from different bloodlines than Apas’.

Apas’ mother was a human. Trishina’s mother was the Queen of Scorpion. And Yuri Ellie’s mother was an Eagle Witch.

Apas was the only one who had the closest bloodline to the mother of Medusa. After all, the mother of Medusa had once been a human.

Yuri Ellie and Trishina had always plotted to kill Apas. They were concerned that the mother of Medusa would pass her throne down to Apas.

Luckily, the mother of Medusa had died. Trishina and Yuri Ellie oversaw the banshee kingdom in Egypt. They possessed the most powerful bloodlines and represented Europe and Africa.

“Since when did Mother’s kingdom become a vassal of the Undead? When did you two become Khufu’s b*tches?” Apas’ pupils continued to expand. Her aura was completely different from before. In fact, she radiated a terrifying aura that Mo fan had felt once before when they had worked together to subdue the Queen of Nine Serenities to subdue her.

Mo Fan instinctively took a few steps away from Apas. He noticed a divine snake shadow on her, like the mythical goddess of snakes. She looked dignified, majestic, and furious!

Mo Fan was surprised. ‘Is this the same Apas? Why had he never sensed such a powerful aura from her before? Why did the divine snake shadow look so familiar?’

Mo Fan remembered when he transformed into a demon form at Dubai, he took on the soul shadow of a Fire Snake Divine King. The divine snake shadow had come from Apas, and she had long mastered the divine skill. When he confronted the Heavenly Scared Sacred Tiger, Apas had revealed part of her afterimage.

At that moment, the divine snake shadow wrapped around Apas’ graceful figure. The coexistence of wickedness and holiness in one body was something shocking to behold. It turned out that Apas had hidden her true self very well.

‘So, she still hoped to achieve Emperor level and break free from our contract!’ realized Mo Fan. ‘What a cunning b*tch!’

If not for the fact that they had run into Apas’ two greatest nemesis, Mo Fan would have never known about this until Apas betrayed him!

Luckily, his cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds. Otherwise, judging from Apas’ current form and aura, she could really break their Contracted Soul by force.

Roar!

Roar!

The roar came from the lifeless land under the stairs. The next moment, an enormous creature appeared from the vast Undead army and charged at Mo Fan. The creature cut across the Bull Monsters, the Mummies, and the Dark Swordmasters.

It crossed the army and charged at the White Tomb Palace’s stairs. The roaring sound swept up the Undead army, and it took a while for the Undead to fall like mud next to the creature.

It was the Sphinx!

The Sphinx was a golden lion with a face that resembled a human. Mo Fan vividly remembered that it had struck him hard when he was in a demon form at Northern Xinjiang. The Sphinx was vengeful. It recognized Mo Fan at a single glance. It squinted its eyes, and its eyes lit up in delight!

“So, it’s you! Puny humans!” The Sphinx smiled.

“Ars*hole, do you have a death wish again?” Mo Fan shouted.

“I’m not a lion. I’m a Pharaoh!” The Sphinx emphasized his words.

“I’m Christ, then!” Mo Fan shot back.

Mo Fan quickly transformed into Flame Demon King when confronting creatures of the Sphinx’s level. He was ablaze with layers of flames. Each layer contained extremely powerful flames. When Mo Fan launched the attack, waves of flames blasted with force.

“Hah! Still the same old trick. You’ve not improved much over the years,” the Sphinx said disdainfully.

The Sphinx was made of sand and soil. It was a stone sculpture. It was not afraid of Mo Fan’s fire power. It had learned about his Fire Element magical power in Northern Xinjiang last time. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At that time, Mo Fan was in a demon form in the face of Khufu’s one hundred thousand vanguard army. Meanwhile, the Sphinx had struck after several Ruler-level demons died.

Mo Fan sneered. The Sphinx would find out about his latest progress soon!
