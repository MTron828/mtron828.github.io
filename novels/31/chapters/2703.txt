Chapter 2704: Grill the Shark

That night when everyone worked, Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan took a little time off. They rarely ever stayed at Fanxue Mountain so they did not have a very good understanding of where they could offer their assistance.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan discussed among themselves, instead. They decided to summon Little Blae Belle, Moon Moth Phoenix, Royal Pattern Wolf, Wind Flame Lightning Vulture, and Little Green Kraken to handle Chief Shark’s huge carcass.

Little Flame Belle was an expert on roasting meat. Nobody could beat her at roasting in the whole of Fanxue Mountain.

“Moon Moth Phoenix, you’ll sprinkle the spices. Make sure to sprinkle evenly. The body is too big,” Mo Fan instructed them.

“Royal Pattern Wolf, summon your eldest, second, and third brothers. Before roasting the wings, we have to slice several areas with a knife to roast the flesh inside. What? You can’t rip Chief Shark’s flesh apart? Useless bunch! Chief Shark is dead! Fine, get a plate and wait for the food.”

Some of Chief Shark’s valuable parts had been taken away by the professionals of Fanxue Mountain to study. Considering that Fanxue Mountain had suffered many losses, Mo Fan offered them Chief Shark’s treasures to auction them off for some gold. He distributed them among the Fanxue Mountain elites. Even though Commander Hua would take care of those who fell in the battle field, Fanxue Mountain made certain that their families were provided for.

Still, a large carcass of flesh was left. If the flesh was left as it was, it would rot and pollute the Fanxue Mountain’s clean air. They didn’t know if it would release toxins. They had grilled various types of Ocean Demons before but this was their first time grilling a Chief Shark.

“Little Green Kraken, enough of eating raw flesh! Eat something cooked, okay?” Zhao Manyan smacked Little Green Kraken’s head with a large iron spoon.

Little Green Kraken came from Lan Yang City. It had stopped growing uncontrollably but the amount of food it ate remained the same. Chief Shark’s flesh was barely sufficient to satiate its appetite. Little Green Kraken drooled all over the ground.

“Shrink yourself, will you? Look at you, you’re so huge, do you want to drown us in your saliva?!” Zhao Manyan scolded.

Little Green Kraken wriggled its round body reluctantly. Its enormous body gradually shrank and soon it transformed into a palm-sized green fish that surrounded Zhao Manyan.

“We’re done! Call everyone so we can begin eating!” Mo Fan shouted.

Little Flame Belle flew out of the hearth and stretched out its tiny flaming hand to high five with Mo Fan’s. They looked like a pair of merry five-star chef and his assistant.

“Let’s eat now!”

Zhao Manyan was the first to use his large iron spoon to dig up a hefty scoop of the roasted meat.

A dozen of staggering light and shadow appeared before Little Green Kraken, and Zhao Manyan’s large scoop of shark meat fell into ‘a pool of piranhas’. It was gone in the blink of an eye.

Zhao Manyan’s face turned dark. He swore to throw Little Green Kraken into the wilderness someday. ‘It has such a huge appetite!’ thought Zhao Manyan. ‘When it eats, it could care less about its father even!’

Zhao Manyan was prepared. He prepared another plate with piles of shark meat and sat down to eat. He placed the plate on his knees, and opened a bottle of beer.

He took a bite of the meat. He found it delicious in the beginning, but as he continued chewing, his face changed slowly.

“Mo Fan, isn’t the taste of this meat a little strange?” he asked.

“What? Are you sure? Maybe you got a bad batch. I mean look at them. They are practically devouring every bit,” said Mo Fan as he gestured to Old Wolf, Eldest Wolf Second Wolf, and the others.

Zhao Manyan took a few more bites. The meat and its aroma were different. He felt that the shark meat wasn’t as good as the sea fishes. Could the Chief Shark’s meat be poorer in quality than the sea bass?

“What are you doing?” Mu Bai returned late at night. He looked tired. He must have been solving the issues with North City and the South Wing Mage Group. He had been very preoccupied lately. He even stayed in Fanxue Mountain most times. He had far less time to relax when compared to Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

“We’re eating grilled shark meat. Do you want to give it a try? Get a beer and join us. It tastes better with ice-cold beer,” said Zhao Manyan.

Mu Bai frowned. He looked repulsed. Zhao Manyan was confused.

“Since you are all so free, maybe read a book or two?” said Mu Bai. “Sharks urinate through their skin. Hence, their flesh is filled with urea. Those who live near the sea are aware that shark meat is neither edible nor tasty.” Mu Bai sighed and continued walking up the mountain.

Mo Fan had been holding his own plate of meat. He had almost taken a bite. Zhao Manyan and Little Green Kraken headed into the woods, as did the others. The air was filled with the sound of people gagging.

Mo Fan then turned to Old Wolf, Eldest Wolf, Second Wolf, Wind Flame Lightning Vulture, and the rest of their group. They ate the meat happily. They even fought for extra shares.

“Fine. I’ll just drink the beer. Let’s drink!” Mo Fan raised the bottle and gulped the beer down. He tossed the shark meat towards the wolf pack.

Old Wolf, Second Wolf, Eldest Wolf, and other wolves jumped at the food and devoured it. Their eyes shone in excitement. They regarded Mo Fan as their master for life.

“Why hasn’t Little White Tiger returned? I miss it,” Mo Fan lamented.

It had been quite a while since Little White Tiger had returned to Tian Sheng. The last time he had met Little White Tiger was in Japan. Little White Tiger had grown up and accepted Heaven Scar’s challenge. It had not returned to Fanxue Mountain since.

Since the Little White Tiger had left, the atmosphere in Yu Shishi’s kindergarten had been a little less lively. Little Flame Belle and Moon Moth Phoenix were ladies. They were far more well-behaved than Little White Tiger.

However, Little Green Kraken was the latest member at Yu Shishi’s kindergarten. Little Green Kraken was fearless, and its presence brought a lot of fun to Maple Mountain and Fanxue Mountain.

“We have once again dragged the issue surrounding the totem,” Mo Fan said, staring at Totem Kindergarten.

“Jiang Shaoxu and Lingling have found some clues. Didn’t you notice they’ve been disappearing occasionally for a couple days now?” Zhao Manyan said. He had finally gotten rid of that awful taste.

He had rinsed his mouth and now was chewing two gums to get rid of the aftertaste. As a flirt, he felt that it was okay if he did not often carry condoms, but he had to always keep his breath fresh.

Meanwhile, Little Green Kraken swung its large tail to request a gum from Zhao Manyan.

“Take it, take it… chew, don’t swallow,” said Zhao Manyan as he threw two chewing gums at Little Green Kraken. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Even before he had finished his words, Little Green Kraken had already caught the gums in its mouth and swallowed.

Zhao Manyan sighed and patted its head. Why bother to tell the truth? There was nothing that the Little Green Kraken wouldn’t eat.
