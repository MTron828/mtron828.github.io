“Hah, he’s only impressive on the surface!” Zhao Manyan laughed.

Karl’s expression darkened.

He had clearly underestimated the Brown Rebels. The enemy had retreated quickly when they sensed the incredible energy of his Super Spell.

“You should focus more on timing. A heavy cannon isn’t necessarily as useful as a dagger in your hand at times,” Commodore chided Karl.

“The bad news is, the enemy now knows we have a cannon. They will react to it?soon,” Mo Fan added in.

Karl glared at Mo Fan.

“Don’t look at me, see for yourself. That guy is probably coming after you!” Mo Fan pointed at a Brown Rebel soaring in the sky with his Wind Wings.

The Wind Mage was maintaining a safe distance from them. He dared not come any closer after seeing the Fearsome Martial Bear.

His eyes were glowing like a cat in the dim sky. He was searching for the person who had Cast the Super Water Spell.

He soon fixed his eyes on Karl. The strange thing was, he was able to pinpoint Karl from such a great height, even though Karl was close to Mo Fan, Commodore, Zhao Manyan, and the others.

“He must be using the Psychic Spell?Homing Eyes. It can track down a Caster through the residual energy in the air,” Commodore noticed.

“Does that mean the Brown Rebels have their eyes on me?” Karl asked warily.

“I’m afraid so. A Super Mage can easily destroy a Wind Warship, so the Brown Rebels will try their best to mark every enemy who can Cast a Super Spell to prevent them from disrupting the balance of the battle,” Commodore analyzed professionally.

Zhao Manyan immediately looked at Mo Fan after hearing those words. “Luckily, we didn’t use our Super Magic. Otherwise, those guys with cat eyes could easily track us down!” he said softly.

It turned out they were right for being cautious on the battlefield. A Super Mage’s spells were very destructive. If the Brown Rebels had not had a way to pinpoint where the enemy Super Mages were, a single Super Spell might have turned the tide of the battle.

Mo Fan looked at the sky. “Even though the Wind Warships are fast, Karl didn’t take much time to Channel his Super Spell, either. I believe the guy was keeping watch in the sky from the beginning. He immediately ordered the Wind Warship to retreat when he sensed the Super Spell. As a result, Karl’s Catastrophe Wave wasn’t as effective as he expected it to be.”

The guy with glowing eyes had disappeared. His job was to observe the enemy from the sky on behalf of the Wind Warships, instead of engaging the enemy.

“We have to get rid of him somehow. Otherwise, they will only back away whenever we use our Super Magic. We can’t defeat them like this,” Su Xi spoke up.

“He won’t give us a chance,” Commodore agreed.

——

The Wind Gear Wheels did not stop coming. There were four Wind Warships in total. The Catastrophe Wave might have driven one of them away, but the other three were still operating as normal.

The female student with a tall nose was in charge of defense. Whenever a Wind Gear Wheel was coming at them, she would Summon a huge rock to block its way, just like a sluice gate.

Most of the students who had come with Professor Xylan were Super Mages, similar to Ritchie and Boleyn.

“Aren’t you going to help?” the female student with a tall nose asked Mo Fan coldly.

“Me?” Mo Fan pointed at himself. He subconsciously wanted to call Zhao Manyan over. Zhao Manyan was a lot better than him at defense!

“I remember you were an Earth Mage, too!” the female student pointed out.

“I’m not good at defense. My Earth Element leans more toward offense, but I can’t use it since the Wind Warships are too far away,” Mo Fan replied.

“Then you can lend me a hand by gathering Earth Magic for me!” the female student went on.

“Fine,” Mo Fan shook his head helplessly.

Why do the students of the Aorus Sacred Institute have to be so aloof?

That being said, Mo Fan was surprised by their strength. It felt like the group was stronger than the teams that had taken part in the open tournament.

“They are moving toward the same spot. They are planning to focus fire on us,” the female student noticed.

“I don’t think it’s as simple as that...” Mo Fan looked into the distance.

The wind was sweeping mud and vegetation into the air, making it difficult to see beyond a kilometer.

Mo Fan noticed the four Wind Warships were regrouping at the same location. Thousands of Wind Tracks had been set up white tunnels for the Wind Mages to travel along quickly.

To his surprise, other Mages who did not belong to the Wind Warships were gathering at the same spot too. More Wind Tracks were Cast to expand the Wind Warships and stack them higher.

“What’s happening? Are those Wind Warships able to combine into one?” Zhao Manyan rubbed his eyes and tried his best to gain a clearer view.

Each Wind Warship consisted of two thousand Mages. As the four Wind Warships slowly combined into one, there were almost ten thousand people on its deck!

The Wind Tracks continued to cross paths and establish boundaries with ferocious winds. They looked like enormous shiny white steel plates from afar!

“You are right!” Mo Fan said with a wry smile.

The four Wind Warships had indeed combined into a Wind Destroyer, which was several times bigger!

The Wind Destroyer had ten thousand men: two thousand on the ground, and eight thousand flying in the air!

It was Mo Fan’s first time seeing a Magic Regiment of this scale. Even Super Mages like them took a few steps back after seeing it.

The wind in their surroundings suddenly blew in the opposite direction. It felt like several hands were shoving them closer toward the Wind Destroyer.

The soil cracked and branches began flying forward. Even the curtain of rain was drawn closer to the Wind Destroyer.

“Perishing Dragon Breath!” the Brown Rebel with cat eyes in the sky shouted.

The wind suddenly stopped. Everything was still moving toward the Wind Destroyer from the momentum as a ferocious gust of wind, similar to the breath of a dragon, greeted them!
