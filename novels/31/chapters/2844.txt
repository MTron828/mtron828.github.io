Chapter 2845: Deadly Bridge

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was not the Black Dragon Emperor but the soul of the incarnation of the Black Dragon. However, the Dragon Flame was still powerful and burned an Egyptian National Beast like the Sphinx into two pieces.

From the Dragon Flames, two balls of flame fell to the ground. One was the Sphinx’s upper body, while the other was the waist and hind legs. They were burnt to crisps!

The vast army froze at this moment as they witnessed the fiasco of Khufu’s messenger.

The Sphinx had an undead body. Its whole body was full of flames. The two parts of the body that fell to the ground were still breaking off. Groups of mummies rushed to the Sphinx. They continued to cast Egyptian magic and even used the Pharaoh’s Source to reconnect the Sphinx’s body.

However, not everyone could touch the Dragon Flame. Those high-level mummies were burning too, and those Pharaohs stood far away by the fire at a loss. The mummy continued to pounce on the Sphinx. Many mummies died to extinguish the Dragon Flame.

The Pharaohs roared, trying to save the Sphinx from disintegration. The mighty army of mummies lost thousands of their own to extinguish the Dragon Flame. Ashes of the burnt mummies filled the sky.

Mo Fan wanted to chase after them, but the number of Khufu’s Undeads was too many. He could not get past them and could only watch those mummies trying to assemble the Sphinx at all costs.

Finally, they succeeded in reassembling the Sphinx. The Dragon Flame had burned its body, so it looked miserable. One of its front legs had not been rescued and was destroyed, so it only had three legs now.

After the Sphinx was reassembled, it roared angrily. It was embarrassing. It had been burnt to a pile of dirty rubble by a human! When the Sphinx glanced at its missing leg, his rotten black face scowled.

“You guys continue to attack. I’ll go back and report to Hades!” Sphinx said gloomily.

The Pharaohs were dumbfounded. ‘How could it run away from the battle? It did not matter if it only had three legs. All the Undeads did not have a complete body.’

Besides, they could not occupy the White Tomb Palace without the Sphinx. Dead Kings of the Eight Directions still had several extremely arrogant and troublesome characters. This army of Khufu undead could not fully obey Trishina and Yuri Ellie.

“Aren’t you a lion and a Pharaoh? Why are you acting like a lame dog? Don’t hide behind those mummies. Come and fight me!” Mo Fan shouted.

The Sphinx was furious. “You’re a stupid human who relies on the Black Dragon Soul. When Hades unifies the underworld, you’ll die!”

“When I defeat the Ocean Demons, I’ll demolish your temple, draw your blood, dig your bones, and step on your grave. Go back and tell Khufu to stop attacking the Ancient Capital. Otherwise, I’ll be sure to visit him next!” said Mo Fan.

Hades, Khufu, was the initiator of the battle in Holy City. Mo Fan would have to settle scores with him sooner or later. However, Mo Fan did not expect Khufu to come to the Dark Abyss. He was thinking of using the Dark Abyss to continue to expand his power.

The Sphinx opened its mouth, as if it was about to bite.

Black dragon energy surrounded Mo Fan once again. When the Sphinx saw this dragon energy, it turned its head and ran in fright. It was lame, but it ran so fast as if it wasn’t even injured anymore.

The immortal body meant that its soul would not be gone. There was no immortality in this world. Even an Undead could die.

…

The departure of the Sphinx affected the morale of the entire Undead army, but it was a pity that Trisina and Yuri Ellie did not plan to let Apas go.

Apas had already shown her Medusa’s Eyes of Destruction. If they did not get rid of her, Apas would kill the two sisters one day when she grew powerful enough. It was useless even if they had many armies of Female Demons. No Female Demon could withstand the attack of the Eyes of Destruction.

Apas and Mo Fan were bound together. It was not so easy for Trishina and Yuri Ellie to kill Apas. Besides, they also needed to fight with the Undeads of the Ancient Capital, which were guarding the White Tomb Palace. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Black Dragon Suit gradually dimmed. Mo Fan realized that the energy of the Black Dragon Suit could only support the Black Dragon Flame once. After using the Black Dragon Flame, Mo Fan would lose the effects of the Black Dragon Horn Helmet, Black Dragon Armor, Black Dragon Gauntlet, Wings of Dusk and Dawn, and Black Dragon Boots.

It seemed that he must use this powerful skill only at a critical time. When he wore the Black Dragon Suit, Mo Fan could ensure his safety when fighting with Supreme Rulers, which could kill him.

Mo Fan let out a sigh of relief. He did not expect the Black Dragon Emperor would protect him at this critical time.

The black Dragon was dead, but its soul resided in this Black Dragon Suit. Perhaps this Black Dragon Suit had many other abilities he had never discovered before. As his strengths improved, he would figure out more of the skills.

…

“Mo Fan, I saw something on the Deadly Bridge. I don’t know if it is the ancient calling spell you were searching for. I tried to wake it up with some of the king’s utensils, but it seemed to need something else to wake it up.” The Queen of Nine Serenities’ voice came from behind.

Mo Fan glanced at Apas. Apas nodded to Mo Fan. “Go ahead. I can handle it here. Anyway, it’s my business.”

“Okay. But if they dare bully you, I’ll not stay behind,” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan could not stay here for too long. They still needed to set up the rain and make other preparations. The Sphinx had left, so the White Tomb Palace should be safe for the time being.

After entering the White Tomb Palace, Mo Fan followed the familiar road to the Deadly Bridges. There seemed to be some special Undeads living in the White Tomb Palace, or perhaps the White Tomb Palace had its own soul. Every path was clear and smooth, contrary to his past visit.

Mo Fan arrived at the Deadly Bridge. There was nothing on the bridge. The corresponding curse was not there.

“I found the Tomb Palace Spirit. It reminded me that it was here. It said that since it was a bridge, there should be water. If the water is pure enough, we could glimpse the true meaning of this bridge,” the Queen of Nine Serenities said to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan looked under the bridge and found that the bottom of the bridge was no longer a dark and terrifying chaotic space. Instead, it became some dry floor tiles with canal-like marks on them. He considered it a while, then he poured the Underground Holy Spring at the bottom of the bridge.

Soon, the spring water became a river. The water passed through nine white arch bridges like a silver ribbon.

The water was clear enough to reflect the incantations at the bottom of the bridge. There were nine rows, like the words on bamboo slips.
