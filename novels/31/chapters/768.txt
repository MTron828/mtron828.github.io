The chill covering Mo Fan from his head to his toes stayed for quite a long time. He stood there blankly until he finally collected his thoughts!

“There are two demon spirits. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to see the memory fragments after Miyata’s death. Those memories belonged to Nara Orisora,” blurted out Ai Jiangtu when he suddenly realized the same thing.

Ai Jiangtu’s words immediately reminded Mo Fan. He looked at Li Kaifeng and asked, “By the way, where did you find the old monks?”

“Manying Mountain, I think that’s how the locals call it. The monk in charge, Xin Yu and the others are all there. What were you two saying? I didn’t understand a single word, what demon spirits?” said Li Kaifeng.

As soon as Li Kaifeng finished his sentence, Mo Fan and Ai Jiangtu exchanged glances with one another.

They both saw the shock in one another’s eyes, as if they were aware that something terrifying was about to happen!

“This is bad, we must go to Manying Mountain at once!” Mo Fan raised his tone.

Ai Jiangtu was most likely the only one who understood what Mo Fan was trying to say. He immediately used Blink without hesitation, blurring and vanishing in the next second. Mo Fan could sense the ripple of the Space Element a few hundred meters away.

“What’s going on?” Li Kaifeng was even more confused.

Nanyu and Jiang Shaoxu knew something serious was about to happen judging from their stern expressions.

“Stop asking questions, bring us to Manying Mountain at once,” urged Mo Fan.

“Al...alright!”

—

They did not have the time to notify the rest of the team. They immediately headed for Manying Mountain at the quickest speed possible.

Manying Mountain was located on the other side of Xixiong City. It was just an isolated mountain, with nothing on it apart from some rocks. It was rare to see any visitors on the mountain, either.

After passing Xixiong City, Mo Fan, sprinting with the Blood Tabi, barely caught up to Li Kaifeng.

Ai Jiangtu was already on his way to the mountain, but it was hard to tell if he could make it in time...

“What the heck is going on?” Jiang Shaoxu could not help but ask as they were running.

Mo Fan glanced at Manying Mountain that was still around two kilometers away and said with a deep voice, “We saw Nara Orisora doing something strange in the illusion.”

“What thing?” asked Jiang Shaoxu.

“After Miyata killed herself, Nara Orisora was carving strange words on some rocks. Ai Jiangtu and I thought he was only venting his anger, so we didn’t put too much attention on them, but we now realized that wasn’t the case!” said Mo Fan.

“Was there anything wrong? I heard Miyata was also carving words on a rock from your sleep talking. Nara Orisora must have done the same thing because he loved her,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“The problem is, the place that Nara Orisora was carving the words was...Manying Mountain, the place where all the monks of Yanming Temple have gone to!” said Mo Fan.

Jiang Shaoxu, Nanyu, and Li Kaifeng immediately came to a realization. They stared at the barren Manying Mountain in astonishment.

A bloody ray burst into the sky from Manying Mountain, still a block away, proving that Mo Fan’s speculation was on point. The light was bright and eerie, like a reflection when sunlight was shining off a lake of blood, a sinister sight!

“The monks are in trouble!” screamed Jiang Shaoxu.

—

Manying Mountain basically had no plant life. The city area at the foot of the mountain was an old block that was scheduled to be demolished. The work had resulted in dust filling the sky. The mountain was barren rocks, even weeds were rare.

A few dozen bloody rocks were floating in the air, forming an eerie curse pattern looming over the mountain.

The ground had some notches filled with fresh blood. The smell of it lingered in the air.

The fresh blood continued to flow through the notches, constructing the same curse pattern formed by the floating rocks. It looked like a three-dimensional skeleton’s head when viewed from the sky!

When the pattern on the ground was completed, the blood rocks gathered together and stacked up into a tombstone at the center of the mountain!

The initial random carvings on the rocks combined into a eulogy. The dried blood suddenly turned fresh and bright, as if someone had just filled them! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“What’s going on? Why is this happening to us all of a sudden!?” the plump monk in charge of the kitchen screamed like a terrified woman.

“It’s the revenge of the ghosts, it must be; I told you we should leave the temple when we had the chance, we’re done for...” a middle-aged monk who was in charge of discipline shrieked hoarsely.

A few other monks who were still dressed in special outfits fell to the ground in fear. A cold breeze with the stench of blood swept in their direction. Under their feet was an eerie pattern, and at the center of stood a tombstone with blood-written words. They had never seen anything so horrifying. They could not even stand properly despite having yet to see any demon creature.

“It’s finally happening. I have already had enough over the past few years...” an old monk sat on the ground and closed his eyes.

They were invited here to conduct a ritual, yet it turned out that the ritual was conducted for them instead. They were the ones who should repent and be transcended!

“Orisora, Orisora, I know we’ve made a mistake. We’ve been chanting the sutras and praying for you and Miyata, hoping that you can find peace in the afterworld...” Xin Yu dropped to his knees and buried his face on the ground.

The others were absolutely terrified. They were only a bunch of ordinary monks. They had never seen a real curse or ghost before. They had been living in fear for the past few years, but it had still happened in the end. Nara Orisora had never planned to forgive them!

Qi Hai pointed at the blood tombstone and yelled, “Stop trying to trick us, Nara Orisora, you shameless prick, trying to scare us with a little trick? We all assumed you who brought disgrace to the temple had died, and everything would remain in the past. However, not only did you fake your death, you even tried to scare us with such petty tricks! Nara Orisora, show yourself, I’m not scared of you!”

“Qi Hai, admit what you’ve done, he might spare us our lives...” said the old monk who had his eyes shut.

“What is there to admit? I didn’t do anything wrong, it was Nara Orisora having a secret date with that little bitch... AHHH!”

Before Qi Hai could finish, he was knocked flying by some force. His body slammed hard against the tombstone.
