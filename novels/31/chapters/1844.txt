Chapter 1845: Evil Caning Imp

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The trees and shrubs scattered all over the place after the Cloud Bursting Waterfall poured down the mountain cascaded down the sides of it. Mo Fan sat with his legs crossed on top of a boulder and waited for Zhu Qi, like the Monkey King when he went to provoke a temple on a mountain.

Chief Zhu Qi raised his head. Anger burst out of his chest when he saw Mo Fan’s attitude. His breathing intensified quickly.

“Do you know how my son died!?” Zhu Qi snarled right away.

Despite Wu Jiao’s advice, Chief Zhu Qi was unable to let go of his son’s death. He had put in so much effort to raise his son Zhu Min, but the young man had died just like that. He had nowhere to vent the feeling of unjust and frustrations in his heart!

Mo Fan did not respond. Chief Zhu Qi added in a cold voice, “Nothing would happen if you and your friends hadn’t come here and caused so much trouble. If you are indeed filled with remorse, you will seal your spiritual strength away and give my son a few kowtows. After that, you just need to behave yourself and wait for another five days. I won’t make things difficult for you and your friends.”

Mo Fan’s mouth hung open for some time after listening to Zhu Qi’s words.

He was already an unreasonable man, yet Zhu Qi was even worse than him. Did he seriously ask him to give Zhu Min kowtows? Kowtow my ass!

“Blaming gravity when you’re struggling to take a poop, the saying is perfect for you. Please, if you knew your son was completely useless, like a little flower in a greenhouse, you shouldn’t have brought him to such a dangerous place to do your shameful deeds. You’re now blaming others after something happened to him, when you yourself failed to teach him proper skills. You’re really something!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

The force of the chain when it snapped in half might be strong, but was unlikely to kill an Advanced Mage right on the spot. Even an Intermediate Mage with slightly better reflexes could prevent the chain from hitting their vulnerable parts. A person who died in such a petty manner was not worth calling himself an enforcer!

Every enforcer was supposed to be prepared to face dangers that might threaten their lives. Did that Zhu Min seriously pass the tests?

It was obvious that Zhu Qi had abused his power to allow his son into the Enforcement Union. The young man was nothing but a bum!

There were only so many branches of the Enforcement Union in their country, so the number of enforcers was limited. The Enforcement Union was supposed to pick the best Mages from among the more talented graduates and Hunters. The greater their roles, the more capable they would have to be. These honorable Mages were able to handle all kinds of danger, yet Zhu Min had died to a chain when it snapped in half. If Mo Fan was his father, he would be too ashamed to tell others. How humiliating would that be?

And yet, this Zhu Qi still dared to put the blame on him? He even demanded Mo Fan give Zhu Min kowtows?

Even a righteous man had no obligation to bear the responsibilities for the young man’s death, let alone an unreasonable, hot-tempered Mage like Mo Fan!

“You knew why you came to the island in the first place. Dawn Island is a mess you left behind. If you are filled with remorse, let my friends go and turn yourself in to the highest Enforcement Union and give Wanggui Town its peace back. That way, I might consider attending Zhu Min’s funeral and perhaps burn him an incense stick or something...

“Screw it, why the hells am I bothering to waste my time with you? You’ve committed so many dirty crimes. You deserve not to have anyone to pay you their last respects when you die!” Mo Fan finally cursed.

Mo Fan began to wonder if his temper had improved the older he was. If it was him a few years ago, he would have simply beat the crap out of anyone who dared to imprison his beloved Miss Tangyue and Lingling. If he did not cripple this person, he would feel ashamed to tell others that people used to call him the Demon King!

“Humph, I have long heard that you are the kind to run amok by abusing the little reputation you’ve earned. It seems like there’s no way you will take the initiative to drop to your knees and repent. I shall break your legs and make you stay beside my son’s grave to keep watch over it!” Zhu Qi’s eyes flickere, his face vicious. Someone had to be responsible for Zhu Min’s death. It was obviously Mo Fan, not the chain!

“If you keep being such a scum, I shall reserve the spirits of your whole family. I’ll definitely bring my favorite disc and play it on loop!” Mo Fan cursed him right back. There was no need to be reasonable with a man like Zhu Qi. It felt much better just to quarrel with him!

Zhu Qi felt like his lungs were about to explode with rage. Breaking Mo Fan’s legs alone was no longer enough to calm his anger!

“You better remember your words when you are begging for mercy on your knees later!” Zhu Qi began to emit a murderous aura. He was an Ice Mage, so a deadly Aura of Ice Magic started forming under his feet.

The Star Patterns instantly combined into an icy-white Star Constellation. Every time it flickered, another Star Constellation would appear as the deadly Ice Magic spread even further.

Zhu Qi was using a Super Spell right at the start of the fight. Mo Fan immediately recalled Mu Bai had just shown him the power of a Super Ice Spell when he used it on the Manta Ray Evil Birds. Even though Mo Fan enjoyed quarreling with the man, he still cast Earth Wave on the ground below his feet to prepare an escape route in advance!

A strange burst of laughter, like the voice of a mischievous kid, suddenly came out of somewhere. Mo Fan thought Zhu Qi had Summoned some kind of demon to ambush him without him knowing. He almost subconsciously cast Blink and ran away from the scene before he noticed an illusionary black mist floating out of his body and approaching Zhu Qi like a dark phantom.

Zhu Qi was unaware of the mist. His Super Spell was completing itself at a quicker rate than Mu Bai’s spell, but the black mist was quicker. The mischievous laughter was still echoing.

A demon spirit with a horn on its forehead suddenly appeared from the mist. It was little like a kid around the age of eight. However, it was holding a huge whip covered in cursed runes in its hand!

The little demon spirit laughed sinisterly as it flung the whip at Zhu Qi’s back as he was about to complete his Star Palace. The huge whip was supposed to be used on monsters and demons. It easily covered a person’s entire back!

Zhu Qi did not react in time at all. The elegant Star Palace collapsed when the Cursed Whip struck him. The force sent him diving to the ground. He ended up eating a mouthful of mud and grass!
