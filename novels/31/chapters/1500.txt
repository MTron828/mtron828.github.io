When Heidi got to Mo Fan’s room, Brianca was indeed inside, dressed in sleepwear with a coat draped over her shoulder. Luckily, Heidi was inexperienced at things like this. She easily believed the lie that Mo Fan and Brianca had worked on together.

“Teacher, Miss Ceylan asked me to visit Yuria’s grave after arriving at the Holy Judgment Court. I don’t know its exact location. Do you know where it is?” Heidi asked.

“I do, but give me some time to change. Wait for me at the Hall of Deities,” Brianca said.

“Can’t I wait here?” Heidi asked curiously.

“Well... Mo Fan said he wanted to visit the grave too. We will meet him there,” Brianca came up with a poor excuse.

“Oh, oh, I didn’t think he was that sensible, but sure,” Heidi nodded. She was deceived quite easily.

Brianca closed the door, but realized she had forgotten to bring any clothes over since she was in such a rush. How was she supposed to change now?

Left with no choice, she sneaked back to her room.

“How did it go? Did she believe it?” Mo Fan asked.

“She does, but you’ll have to come with us to visit Yuria’s grave,” Brianca said.

“Oh, sure,” Mo Fan nodded. He decided not to mention anything that had happened yesterday and just played along.

Brianca bit her lips after seeing Mo Fan’s reaction. She hesitated for a long time on whether she should bring up what had happened last night up. She was quite confused about her behavior.

“Mo Fan, about last night...” Brianca could not stand the silence.

“It’s fine, people say some strange things when they are sick. That’s understandable,” Mo Fan interrupted. He would never admit it was his doing; he had made up his mind firmly about that!

“I’m not good at expressing myself. I hope what I did last night didn’t scare you...” Brianca lowered her head. She tried to make it sound natural, yet she was still blushing a little.

“Not good at expressing yourself?” Mo Fan was confused now. Why would she say she was not good at expressing herself? Did that mean she did not know she was behaving strangely because she was drugged?

Brianca did not continue the conversation. Mo Fan waited for her to change before they headed to the Hall of Deities together.

——

The Hall of Deities was a symbol of the Holy Judgment Court. Its exterior did not differ greatly from other luxurious halls, but its ceiling was a world-class work of art. It was made up of the deities of three hundred and thirty-three different religions, without any sense of incompatibility. It basically depicted all the religions that the world acknowledged. There were a great number of them, yet it did not look messy. The stories and legends that the intertwined backgrounds depicted were passed down for generation after generation...

Some artists could sit here and examine the ceiling for years without getting tired of it. Unfortunately, a blizzard had left the mountain off-limits to the feebler artists and bards. It was extremely difficult for them to visit the Alps; most of the people here came for personal reasons.

Mo Fan was totally clueless about art. He did not even bother raising his head to admire it. He strongly believed this place was good for treating the cervical vertebra...

“Let’s go,” Brianca said.

Mo Fan followed the two women. It was true that when someone started uttering a lie, they would need a few more lies to make up for it. He was not actually interested in visiting Yuria’s grave, but now he had no choice but to follow them.

Brianca’s reaction was outside Mo Fan’s expectations. She was calmer than he had imagined, and... how should he put it, as saying stupid was not really appropriate?...

Yuria’s grave was located under an icy cliff to the east of the Holy Judgment Court. They would have to leave the cliff’s natural protection. The Holy Judgment Court did indeed know how to choose the best places. The top of the cliff was thick with magic. If ordinary Mages were to cultivate here, the location alone was as beneficial as a basic Cultivation Tool!

Their footprints were covered by snow in seconds. Sunlight was scarce, even though it was still morning. The place was dark and gloomy, ruled by the vast whiteness. It would normally see scattered sunlight around noon. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Not long afterwards, Mo Fan finally saw the icy cliff. They were currently at the bottom of it. Huge icy stalactites hung from the jaw of the cliff, extending almost to the bottom. They were pointed like spears, but as transparent as crystals.

Under these stalactites was a rectangular tombstone. It was half-covered in snow, the words on it were covered in ice. Brianca cautiously cleaned off the tombstone and placed a bouquet of Snow Lavenders in front of it.

The two women stood there and crossed their hands in front of their huge busts. They lowered their heads while uttering some memorial chants for the dead. It sounded like a song, pleasant but with a hint of sorrow...

Mo Fan stood behind them and observed the surroundings since he had nothing to do. A patch of frozen soil nearby soon caught his attention.

“The snow here must be at least five meters thick, right?” Mo Fan asked when the two women were done.

“I believe so,” Brianca said.

“Then what’s with the frozen soil? It looks like it was dug up recently,” Mo Fan pointed at the patch of soil.

Heidi and Brianca saw the patch of frozen soil, but it did not look unusual to them. However, Mo Fan had a feeling something was not right.

Considering their current altitude, and how spring was just around the corner, it was unlikely that they would be able to see any soil before summer. The sturdy layer of ice and snow was over five meters thick. There was no way a beast could dig through it easily. Besides, this place was still within the vicinity of the Holy Judgment Court. No demon creatures would come here and get themselves killed.

The soil would be covered up by snow in a few weeks, making it unnoticeable. However, it was only covered by a thin layer of ice right now. Based on Mo Fan’s rough estimation of the weather, the soil was dug up less than a month or two ago!

“What are you trying to say?” Heidi asked. She believed Mo Fan’s brain worked differently from theirs. Any ordinary person would not think there was anything wrong with the soil.

“The soil was turned, and it occurred beside the grave. I think it’s necessary to verify if Yuria’s body is still under here,” Mo Fan said seriously.

Mo Fan had a lot of experience with the undead, so he was very sensitive to the condition of the soil.

That being said, this did not necessarily have anything to do with the undead, but it was obvious that someone had done something to the grave!

“Are you sure?” Brianca glanced at Mo Fan, a little confused.

“Are there any Undead Mages in the Holy Judgment Court? I’m not too sure either, but an Undead Mage just needs to take a brief walk around to know what happened under here,” Mo Fan told them.
