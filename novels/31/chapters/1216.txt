“Can your General really control the Sandstorm Demon Locusts?” Lingling asked. She did not seem to be panicking after facing the man that was planning some mischief.

“Does it even matter? I’m quite curious too; what is a young girl like you doing here? Girls at your age should be studying in schools and playing at home. You should be eating some dessert as you are going shopping, shouldn’t you?” the skinny soldier grinned and slowly moved toward Lingling.

“I hate all of those things,” Lingling replied.

“If it was me in the past, there’s no way I would kill a little girl like you, but you know I can’t disobey the orders of my superior. I am not allowed to let a word leave this place,” the skinny soldier came even closer, his cold eyes fixed on Lingling.

“No one is going to believe the words of a little kid,” Lingling raised her head and said in a serious voice.

The soldier chuckled. He was amused by the little girl.

“Sorry, can’t do, it’s an order. Anyone that comes in here is not allowed to leave. Some things are meant to be buried under the sand. You shouldn’t be digging them up, since more lives are just going to die because of it. The people thought the scariest thing in this desert was the Sandstorm Demon Locusts, but those that are familiar with General Shi know he’s the deadliest king of scorpions in this desert!” the soldier smiled, but it gradually lost its warmth.

He raised his right hand slightly. A black mist circled his hand, and slowly turned into a black blade pointed at Lingling’s temple.

“You do know you’re the bad guy?” Lingling said.

“I know, of course I know.” The skinny soldier was still smiling.

“But I bet you don’t know that most bad guys died in the end because they talked too much. They should have just focused on the job, idiot!” Lingling snapped.

The soldier was startled. As he was about to get angry, a shadowy black bird appeared beside him. The shadow quickly dissipated, and a human figure stepped out from it, standing stood less than half a meter away from him.

The man had dark brown eyes that looked like they were going to spit fire at any second. The soldier had never felt such a strong pressure. His whole body turned cold in an instant.

“I dare you to touch her!” The eyes belonged to Mo Fan. He had found Lingling by following the symbols she had left behind. He happened to arrive just as he saw the soldier threatening Lingling!

“Who...who are you!?” The soldier was shocked.

The soldier also had the Shadow Element, yet he was completely unaware of the man’s presence. It meant the man’s Shadow Element was significantly stronger than his!

It was also his first time seeing the Fleeing Shadow in the form of a shadow bird!

“You won’t need to know who I am. You just need to remember before you die that I’m ten times scarier than your General!” Mo Fan slammed his fist into the soldier’s chest.

His punch was enhanced by the overwhelming force of the Space Element. The soldier’s chest caved in before he flew into the distance like a bullet and slammed heavily into the black rocks.

The soldier vomited blood after slamming into the rocks. His magic Armor barely saved him, but he was in immense pain. as his bones were all broken!

“That’s...that’s all you got, you’re still nothing compared to General Shi...” the soldier said mockingly despite the condition he was in. He seemed to be fearless of death.

However, before he could finish his sentence, a huge flame suddenly burst out of his body. In less than a second, the soldier was completely devoured by the fierce flames of the Ardent Sunset. The flames even burned the rocks nearby into ashes!

The fire was still spreading across the rock of the hill. It had long burned the soldier and his Armor into nothing, but the flames were still spreading uncontrollably, just like Mo Fan’s fury!

“Who is this asshole General Shi?” Mo Fan clenched his fist and extinguished the flames in the distance. He turned around and asked Lingling.

“Forget about that for now, I think you should take care of those demon locusts first,” Lingling pointed in another direction. There were two vague figures out there.

Mo Fan was startled. He quickly realized the figures were Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu, and they were running toward the Burning Mountains. More importantly, they were being chased by countless Sandstorm Demon Locusts!

The demon locusts were like a gray cloud. They slowly turned into a veil in the sky, flying in a line. They gradually closed in on Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu. Some that were closer were already attacking them!

If more demon locusts reached them, they would soon turn into skeletons. Mo Fan did not have time to ask Lingling. He immediately cast Blink.

“I’m fine here, hurry and save them,” Lingling told him.

Mo Fan nodded. He connected the last Star Pattern for the Silver Constellation, a magic formation with a bigger coverage.

With a silver flicker, Mo Fan’s figure faded away in the trembling space. As the light’s brightness reached its limit, Mo Fan vanished into thin air and reappeared at the waist of the hill nearby within the blink of an eye...

Lingling glanced into the distance and saw the same silver Star Constellation. Mo Fan vanished once again after it flickered. Lingling looked further ahead and saw Mo Fan...

The same silver Star Constellation appeared. Mo Fan soon arrived behind the sand dunes. He was getting smaller and when as he drew closer to Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu.

Lingling let out a relieved sigh after she saw Mo Fan able to cover the distance so swiftly.

The demon locusts were beating their wings very quickly. The drone they produced was no longer just a sound, but a sonic wave surging across the sand dunes!

As the Sandstorm Demon Locusts drew closer, the sound was preventing Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu from channeling their spells. The vicious Sandstorm Demon Locusts flew past them. Their sharp claws and teeth tore through the girls’ clothes and skin, leaving cuts on their bodies.

The rest of the Sandstorm Demon Locusts picked up their pace after picking up the smell of blood. The demon locust swarm was going to eat the two girls!

“We are having trouble using our magic!” Jiang Shaoxu forcibly summoned her magic Armor, hoping to buy herself some extra time.

They finally understood why the Sandstorm Demon Locusts were unstoppable. Their wings produced a sonic wave that would stop the Mages from being able to focus on the channeling of their spells, meaning that just the sound they produced was dealing a deadly blow to a Mage!

The magic Armor that the two girls were wearing would not last for long. They were fully covered in the Sandstorm Demon Locusts. The creatures had stacked on top of them like two huge cocoons!

“Little Flame Belle, take them out!” a voice yelled as the two girls were about to reach their limit.

A petite figure flew into the cloud of Sandstorm Demon Locusts, surrounded by a circle of fire that slowly enlarged. The fire set the Sandstorm Demon Locusts on fire with the slightest touch...

Flames the color of the sky at sunset surged wildly through the Sandstorm Demon Locusts. The sky was soon dyed red by the fire. The Sandstorm Demon Locusts stood no chance against the overwhelming heat of the Ardent Sunset. Thousands of them died instantly to the fire!

Little Flame Belle felt like the demon locusts were still burning too slow. She took a deep breath, and blew out a brown fire that swiftly spun into a tornado made of Calamity Fire. It sprang up like a dragon and flew straight at the Sandstorm Demon Locusts!

The Calamity Fire’s damage was no weaker than the Ardent Sunset. The two Soul-grade Fires seemed to be competing against one another, seeing who was going to kill the most Sandstorm Demon Locusts!

The Sandstorm Demon Locusts were soon reduced into ashes and scattered in the air.

The ears of Mo Fan, Jiang Shaoxu, and Mu Nujiao could relax. As a matter of fact, the Sandstorm Demon Locusts were a pain in the arse for even Mo Fan to deal with if he was alone. The sonic wave would reduce a Mage to an ordinary human. Luckily, Little Flame Belle had recently acquired the Ardent Sunset, which seemed to be the Sandstorm Demon Locusts’ natural foe. Otherwise, it was unlikely they could kill the Sandstorm Demon Locusts within a short period.

It was a relief that the Sandstorm Demon Locusts that were sent after Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu were only a small portion. If the entire army of the Sandstorm Demon Locusts was here, Mo Fan definitely would have had no chance of saving the girls. He could not tell how long it would take him to burn them all into ashes.

“Mo Fan!”

“Mo Fan, you’re finally here!”

The two girls were about to burst out crying. Being eaten by the Sandstorm Demon Locusts was surely the worst way to die!

“It’s fine, it’s fine now...” Mo Fan comforted them.

Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu were utterly terrified. Their experiences here in the desert were definitely beyond what they could bear. They were still lost in their thoughts after they somehow survived from the Sandstorm Demon Locusts. They did not even realize their clothes were ragged. Parts of their fair, tender skin that were not hurt were exposed. It was surprising how they were still not tanned after spending some days in the desert...

Mo Fan hugged the girls and comforted them. His eyes were looking back and forth between them.

After some time, the two girls finally realized Mo Fan had taken advantage of them countless times with his eyes. They quickly found a spot to treat their wounds and change their clothes.

“Mo Fan, are you seriously so strong that you can even face the Sandstorm Demon Locusts?” Jiang Shaoxu asked with a hint of admiration.

“Little Flame Belle has resurrected. She also obtained a new Soul-grade Fire that’s extremely effective against the Sandstorm Demon Locusts,” Mo Fan replied honestly.

The Ardent Sunset was indeed the Sandstorm Demon Locusts’ natural foe. Even the mutated Demon Locust that enjoyed staying inside the fire on the Burning Mountains did not dare to come any closer to Little Flame Belle, let alone the ordinary Sandstorm Demon Locusts. They were like little sticks that could be set on fire with the slightest spark!
