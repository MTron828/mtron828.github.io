“What are you looking at? Do you feel sorry for her?” The student glared at Mo Fan.

“Not really, I’m just a little shocked,” Mo Fan replied, bemused.

The woman did deserve some beating, based on how she had treated them in the first place. Mo Fan did not think her attitude would change after guiding them around.

Mo Fan also realized the reason why she was looking down on the tourists after seeing her senior. The woman did not really have any place in the school. She was bullied by her seniors most of the time, so she could only vent her frustrations on the tourists who came to the school without permission.

The slap was not that heavy; it would only leave red marks on the woman’s face at most. Mo Fan had no intention of helping the woman. He could not be bothered wasting his time on someone who lacked both inner and outer qualities. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The woman left after swallowing her anger. Mo Fan quickly stopped the student with the puffy hair, as they no longer had a guide to bring them around, “Can you bring us around then?”

“Why should I bring you around? Are you blind? Even if you are blind, I’m not obliged to help the handicapped!” the student scoffed at him.

She left immediately, leaving Mo Fan and the others behind.

Zhao Manyan was going to teach her a lesson, but Mu Bai waved his hand and said, “Forget it, we have already gone to most of the places we need to. It’s time for us to check in with the school.”

“Speaking of which, since we came later than the others, we couldn’t make it to the welcoming ceremony. We have to start teaching tomorrow. Have you two prepared for the classes? We shouldn’t expose ourselves,” Zhao Manyan inquired, adjusting his glasses .

“What preparations?” Mo Fan asked dimly.

“Seriously? If you didn’t prepare for the classes, how are you going to teach the students? Mo Fan, can you be a little more professional? The Black Vatican can disguise itself in various ways. They can blend into society like secret agents. I hope the school doesn’t unmask you before we find the Black Vatican!” Zhao Manyan sighed.

Mo Fan purposely stayed up all night to prepare for the classes the next day. He thought he could enjoy the luxurious lifestyle at the Aorus Sacred Institute and have a coincidental encounter with the ladies of renowned families on the campus, but instead he was forced to stay in his room and practice how to be a teacher!

An assistant was waiting for Mo Fan outside his unit early in the morning. He was worried that Mo Fan might lose his way around.

The handsome assistant was in his late twenties. He was surprised to see Mo Fan walking out of his room in a simple outfit, as he noticed Mo Fan was only a few years older than him.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan, Mu Bai, and Zhao Manyan had taken the Face-Altering Syrup that Mu Bai had refined just so they would not look too young. It might not be able to change their appearance completely, but it did make them look older. Most people would think they were in their thirties.

Mo Fan was a little disappointed when he saw his assistant was a man.

“Good morning, Lecturer Mo Yifan, we are honored to invite a bright lecturer from China like you to teach our students. I’ve been looking forward to learning more about the culture of your country!” the assistant said respectfully.

“Mm,” Mo Fan pretended to be unapproachable.

The assistant scratched his head. He did not expect the lecturer to be so reserved. He added, “How were your preparations last night? A kind reminder for you, the students of the Aorus Sacred Institute are a lot trickier to teach. They always come up with questions that our professors struggle to answer, so I hope you won’t find it troublesome. They are just passionate about their studies.”

“I understand,” Mo Fan nodded.

“Ah, there’s one more thing. Since you and your colleagues didn’t attend the welcoming ceremony, you might be unaware that there are lecturers from nine other reputable universities who will be teaching at our school for two months. Our school encourages competition in our teaching. Each guest lecturer will be in charge of a class, and these classes will be taking part in a competition in two months. I hope your students will win the competition!” the assistant said.

“Oh? That sounds interesting!” Mo Fan smiled.

Learning without competing with others was no different from relaxing on a farm. Even the women had to fight for the rights to the public square for a place to have their aerobic dances and promote themselves. How could the students of a magic institute not have a competitive spirit?

Mo Fan liked the idea of having competitions. He would be bored to death in a peaceful and doddering society!

“Your colleagues have already finished their classes. They are still getting used to the new environment, but their classes were fascinating,” the assistant said.

Mo Fan followed the assistant to where his class was. He thought it would be a spacious outdoor training ground, but instead it was a classroom with decorations that resembled Star Patterns.

“This is where your class is for today. You will be teaching Advanced Magic Theory... I’ll be attending the class too, so you can ask me anything if you need,” the assistant said.

“Huh? Advanced Magic Theory?” Mo Fan almost dropped his glasses to the floor.

“Is there something wrong? Mr. Zhao Yanzu took the class that teaches about demon creatures while Mr. Mu Han took the class about magic dueling... did I make a mistake? Let me take a look!” The assistant quickly took out his notebook and checked the schedule again.

They were told Mo Yifan was a great lecturer of magic theories in China. He must have profound knowledge in the field which would broaden their students’ horizons.

“No, it’s nothing. It’s just that I’m good in a lot of fields, so I didn’t expect my colleagues to take the classes I was planning to teach,” Mo Fan said.

Those motherf**kers!

How could they let a half-illiterate like him teach the students magic theory? The class about magic duels was obviously his area of expertise. If he knew magic theory, his father would not have had to sell their house to Mu He that old bastard!

Did they want him to expose himself by letting him teach magic theory in a university when he did not even graduate from high school?

“You may start, the students are waiting,” the assistant said.

Mo Fan put on a polite smile and walked into the class with the remaining confidence of a man he had acquired from Xinxia not long ago.

He thought it was only a small class with around twenty students. He could just fool around and get over it, yet he was almost spooked out of his mind when he set foot into the class.

It did not feel like a class, but a conference talk instead!

There were over three hundred students packed inside the hall!

The youthful students of different countries and races sat patiently in their seats.

Mo Fan had never felt so nervous before. It was worse than facing the army of undead from the Great Pyramid of Giza!
