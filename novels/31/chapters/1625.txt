He brought Leng Qing down the mountain to have dinner with the others.

Mo Fan was thinking of having pizza as dinner, but Zhao Manyan immediately rejected his proposal.

Mo Fan’s thoughts were full of pizzas whenever he was around the Mediterranean Sea. He would rather go to Pizza Hut if he had a choice.

Zhao Manyan’s choice was completely different; it was on a mountainside facing the calm sea. The food was delicious, and opposite him were some gorgeous ladies. It was perfect for the atmosphere... huh, why was Mu Bai here, too? Who invited this assh***? Why didn’t he go die instead!?

“And this is?” Brianca asked politely.

“Leng Qing, my senior sister. She’s also the Vice Head of the Lingyin Enforcement Union. She has been convalescing here lately,” Mo Fan introduced her.

“Nice to meet you! Mo Fan told me that you two are from the Alps Institute. I’ve always wanted to visit it,” Leng Qing smiled. She surprisingly had a gentle, elegant demeanor, perhaps because she had spent quite some time resting in the Parthenon Temple. She was not like that in the past. She was simply so busy with the Enforcement Union that she had simply put everything else aside.

It was true that a person’s frame of mind would change after experiencing death. That being said, why did his habit of courting death never change, even though he was constantly roaming in front of the gates of Hell?...

“China’s Enforcement Union, a reputable organization! I didn’t expect their elders to be so young,” Brianca complimented her.

“Stop fawning on one another, will you? It will only make us feel worse,” Zhao Manyan groaned.

Leng Qing was around the same age as Brianca, but both of them were already Super Mages. Zhao Manyan’s mood worsened as soon as he thought about it.

“Speaking of which, Miss Brianca, where did you go after you left us?” Mo Fan asked curiously.

“I went to investigate something, mm...” Brianca glanced at Leng Qing. She paused briefly before spilling the beans, “A Candidate of the Parthenon Temple might be responsible for the conspiracy at the Alps Institute.”

“Oh, I see!” Mo Fan nodded. He did not go any further.

Mo Fan already knew Edith was taking orders from Izisha. Izisha was the one who had put Herr Casa under the poisonous Curse, but as long as Edith did not admit it, Mo Fan could not afford to shed light on it. He had not told Brianca and Heidi about it.

To his surprise, Headmistress Perry, Miss Ceylan, and Miss Brianca were not easy to fool, either. If they had already figured it out, the situation was clearly heading the way Mo Fan favored. Otherwise, that detestable Izisha would still act like she had nothing to do with it, even though she was the one pulling the strings!

“Which candidate are you referring to?” Leng Qing asked.

“It must be Izisha,” Mo Fan said.

Brianca glanced at Mo Fan before nodding, “The whole thing isn’t as simple as it seems. Edith also admitted something shocking at the Holy Judgment Court.”

“It looks like Headmistress Perry’s decision was right?” Mo Fan wondered.

Headmistress Perry was willing to protect Edith, even if it meant provoking the Casas. Edith did not completely lose her rationality. She had admitted Izisha was behind it in the end, but did not confess much. Therefore, Brianca had to investigate further.

As for the details of the conspiracy, or if Izisha was up to something worse behind the scenes, the Alps Institute would have to seek out the truth themselves. After all, he did not know much about it, either!

“Humph, the people of the Parthenon Temple are no good!” Heidi said.

“Not everyone there is hateful,” Mo Fan countered awkwardly.

Mo Fan suddenly realized something troublesome. Heidi and Brianca had never bothered differentiating between Izisha and Xinxia, since they were both from the Parthenon Temple. It was all the Parthenon Temple’s fault. The Parthenon Temple were the bad guys!

At this rate, considering how stubborn the people of the Alps Institute were, they would never accept any funding from the Parthenon Temple, even if it meant closing orphanages!

Mo Fan was thinking of building a bridge between them, but was already getting a huge headache from it.

“Let’s just eat. Why do we have to talk about something so complicated while we are having dinner?” Zhao Manyan interrupted with a sigh.

Mo Fan rubbed his temples. It seemed it was unwise for him to introduce Xinxia to them soon... He sighed. Why did women have to be so complicated? Couldn’t they just sit down and gossip or discuss cosmetics peacefully? Why did they have to fight for power until their heads bled!?

“Does anyone feel the tables shaking?” Mu Bai, who had been quiet suddenly said.

“Zhao Manyan must be shaking his leg,” Mo Fan immediately commented.

“Bullshit!”

The plates on the table suddenly bounced into the air as they were talking. Their food scattered across the table.

Their glasses were softly knocking into one another, clinking. The tables and chairs were shaking.

“An earthquake?” Mo Fan asked.

“Look out the window!” Leng Qing pointed outside.

The spacious windows made it easy for the people inside to enjoy a beautiful view of the sea at night. It felt like they were hanging right above the water. To their astonishment, a huge shadow had appeared from the darkness!

The waves from the sea could only reach its knees. Every step it took triggered a huge quake, and its head almost touched the clouds. When it headed toward one of the cliffs, it turned out that the cliff only reached its waist. The huge figure easily strode right over it!

“Our honorable guests, please remain calm. It’s only a Tyrant Titan. We are very close to the Parthenon Temple’s Mountain of the God’s Seal, and to the south and west are areas the Tyrant Titans are active in. Our restaurant is located inside the safe zone. The Tyrant Titan is actually quite far away from us. If it comes any closer, the powerful Mages of the Parthenon Temple will drive it away. Please enjoy your meals,” a voice announced through the sound system. It sounded like a cabin crewmember on a plane, reminding the passengers to sit tight and put their seatbelts on when turbulence occurred.

Zhao Manyan and Mo Fan almost dropped their jaws.

Holy crap, to think that they would see a Tyrant Titan while they were having dinner, not to mention how the restaurant was brushing it off so calmly! To their surprise, the people in the restaurant did not panic at all. Some of the kids even ran to the windows to take pictures, like they were looking at an elephant in a zoo!

Weren’t Russians normally known for being fearless? Since when were the Greeks so fearless, too?

“It’s pretty common for Tyrant Titans to show up in Athens. I bet the people here have already gotten used to it. These Tyrant Titans aren’t that hostile to normal civilians. They are mainly after the Mages and the Parthenon Temple, so the Athenians aren’t that afraid of them,” Leng Qing explained.

Mo Fan had been told that the Parthenon Temple was constantly fighting the Tyrant Titans. He was quite shocked to witness it in person for the first time.

“It’s at least a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan,” he noticed.

“Mm, I noticed it roaming close to the safe zone lately. It would hide in the water when the Mages showed up. The government also claims that this Tyrant Titan isn’t aggressive, so the people aren’t worried,” Leng Qing said.

The Tyrant Titan’s cry sounded like the cry of a whale. The deep cry broadcasting its strength echoed through the night sky. Mo Fan turned around to take a closer look. He saw the Tyrant Titan slowly disappearing into the mists on the sea, but its cry was still echoing in his mind.

“It sounds desperate,” Apas said softly.

“How can you tell? Why do I feel like it’s showing off its strength, like it is trying to attract a female Tyrant Titan to it?” Zhao Manyan said.

“The despair will soon turn into violence. You should warn the people in Athens about it. It’s going to bring a bloodbath,” Apas said.

The others looked at Apas. They did not expect a young woman like her to say something like that in such a firm voice.

“Are you sure?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm, its cry is full of sorrow. I think someone has taken something precious from it, and it doesn’t know where to look for it. If it was roaming close to the city lately, it means it hasn’t given up yet, but its cry just then... it means it has lost all hope,” Apas said.

The others were confused after hearing Apas’ explanation.

“Mo Fan, come to think of it, do you remember the heart of a young Tyrant Titan that was auctioned off a few days ago? It’s definitely something that a Basic or Intermediate Earth Mage could only dream of. A renowned clan ended up buying it for a huge sum. They gave it to the young disciple of another renowned clan they were trying to establish a connection with on the spot,” Zhao Manyan spoke up after remembering something.

“Oh, I remember that, too,” Mo Fan nodded.

The heart of a young Tyrant Titan! Mo Fan remembered it was the item right after the Horn of the Deer God. He had even exclaimed how lucky it was to be a disciple of a renowned clan. They could afford to spend so much money on these rare resources for young Mages below the age of twenty. These young Mages were clearly going to be unbeatable among the people of their age!
