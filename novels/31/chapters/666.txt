The bridge was shrouded in darkness. The group felt more nervous as they proceeded forward.

The worst thing was, Mo Fan and his crew had no idea if they had chosen the Bridge of Life or the Bridge of Death. It felt like there was no end to the bridge.

Mo Fan had enough of how the Qin Emperor had designed his tomb. Why did the dead man make everything feel like an endless loop? They had spent quite some time on the bridge, yet not a single sound was to be heard. If it was the Bridge of Death, hurry up and send the demons and monsters over. What’s the point of making the bridge so long?

Mo Fan cursed continuously in his heart. The funny thing was, something silver did appear ahead, as if the Ancient King was able to hear Mo Fan’s grumbling.

Mo Fan gradually approached and they could make out a silver mirror!

The mirror looked extremely weird. It was somehow standing on the bridge, with silver ripples on its surface. It simply looked like a portal connected to another world.

“Brother Fan, look behind you,” said Zhang Xiaohou suddenly.

Mo Fan was still inspecting the strange silver mirror. He only turned around when he heard Zhang Xiaohou’s words. He was nearly scared to death at the turn, as the arch bridge they were walking on before had suddenly disappeared!

The disappearance of the bridge was not their main concern. The problem was, the black wind sickles were moving toward them at an increasing speed.

“Holy shit, what the heck?!” cursed Mo Fan.

The wind was getting closer. It did not give Mo Fan and the others any time to inspect the mirror further. They immediately grabbed one another’s hands and rushed into the mirror after taking a deep breath!

As they thought, the mirror was a space tunnel. The group of four were blown away by the turbulent flow of space as they drifted to somewhere unknown...

Mo Fan felt extremely heavy-headed. He could only see himself surrounded by the void. If he really had to describe the feeling, it was as if he was sliding down a smooth tunnel at a rapid pace. The motion kept spinning him around!

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!....”

Four cries of fear came from a silver vortex that suddenly appeared high up in the air, before two men and two women were ejected from it and fell to the ground.

The silver vortex was a certain distance away from the ground. They did not realize it in the first place, but as soon as they saw the ground was made of sturdy rocks, Zhang Xiaohou and Mo Fan immediately cast some spells.

The group had a rough landing. The ground below their feet was sturdy, as hard as stone!

The ground was gray. It was so dry that not a single plant could be spotted. The whole surface was filled with cracks! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I...I don’t think I can see the altar here...” Su Xiaoluo’s face turned pale as she scanned their surroundings.

If they were not brought to the altar, it meant that they had taken the Bridge of Death!

“Another unique space, how many unique spaces did that guy actually put inside his own tomb?” Mo Fan observed their surroundings and discovered that it was only a small, standalone space.

The place was not spacious at all. They could see the curve of the sky when they raised their heads. They could also see the ends of the gray land.

“Is this some kind of cage designed for us to rot in here?” Zhang Xiaohou had also discovered that there was nothing here apart from the land and the sky.

No plants, no animals. They barely believed they were still alive somewhere when they saw the lightning flickering across the sky at times.

“What shall we do now?” asked Liu Ru.

It was obvious that they had taken the Bridge of Death that led them to this weird space.

“I read some books about the Space Element not long ago. A unique space like this must have an exit if it has an entrance. Therefore, there must be an exit somewhere if this place is a standalone space. A space with only an entrance but no exit is dead space. It’s void, which simply means it doesn’t exist,” said Mo Fan.

Zhang Xiaohou, Liu Ru, and Su Xiaoluo failed to understand him well.

Mo Fan added when he saw the confused looks on their faces, “Anyway, a unique space like this must have an entrance and an exit. Don’t worry!”

The group believed in Mo Fan. They picked a direction and proceeded that way. However, even though the gray land was still extending further ahead, they were unable to move forward, as if there was an invisible wall of space in front of them!

Mo Fan tried to use magic. The Fire Burst was able to fly further into the distance, yet he still could not walk past it!

He tried using Fleeing Shadow, but the outcome turned out the same.

“Let’s choose a different direction.”

They went into a different direction and soon discovered something emitting a silver glow in the air!

“A silver realm, that must be the exit!” Mo Fan was overjoyed.

Every space had its rules. Mo Fan was confident that there was an exit, yet he did not expect to find it so quickly.

The thing was not too far away, it was around five kilometers away. They just needed to go straight...

“There’s something in the sky... mm, why is there a silver vortex?” Liu Ru’s sight was sharper than the rest. She immediately discovered something strange in the sky.

Mo Fan raised his head and saw a silver vortex above them. It was floating with the clouds, and seemed to be spinning slowly...

Mo Fan had no clue what it was either, but they only had to make their way toward the exit since they had found it.

“Look, something is falling!” yelled Liu Ru, pointing at the silver vortex.

“They are black, what are they, they are falling like rain?...” said Su Xiaoluo.

Mo Fan was quicker in his thinking. When he saw the things falling from the silver vortex like tiny black raindrops, his expression immediately turned grim!

The things seemed like tiny raindrops from their current distance, but once they were standing under the silver vortex, their size would no longer be the same as raindrops...

“They are undead!” shouted Liu Ru when she finally got a closer look at the things falling from the silver vortex.

“Undead... Heavens, so many of them?” Su Xiaoluo’s eyes were full of disbelief.

She glanced at the land ahead. The things that landed on the ground soon rose to their feet and started walking around awkwardly.

Undead, they were all undead...

The rain falling from the silver vortex was actually raining undead. The zombies, skeletons and phantoms were clustered together like raindrops. Similar to Mo Fan’s group, it seemed like they had just been dragged into this unique space. Their hatred-filled eyes still looked confused...
