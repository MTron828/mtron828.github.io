“Salan won’t hide forever. She’s waiting for the poppies to mature. If we find Mr. Lin’s plantation, it will bring us closer to Salan!” Mo Fan declared.

“That’s a very important clue. Shouldn’t we tell the Holy Judgment Court or the Enforcement Union instead, so they can take care of Salan? We don’t have to do it ourselves, do we? Zhao Manyan asked hastily.

“The Holy Judgment Court was stupid enough to let the Cold Prince escape from their prison. How reliable do you think they are? Our country’s Enforcement Union is determined to hunt Salan down, yet they have trouble doing anything since the other countries won’t allow them to operate freely in their territories,” Mo Fan scoffed at the idea.

“So you are saying that we have to rely on ourselves again?” Zhao Manyan felt like crying.

“We must handle the investigation ourselves. Otherwise, the people of the Black Vatican will quickly erase their traces again. They will do anything to protect their superiors. Besides, I don’t want to involve the others,” Mo Fan said sternly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Yeah, Golden Sun Knight Jiang Bin... he’s blind because of us. If someone like him can’t protect himself from the Black Vatican, who else can stay safe once they decide to take on the Black Vatican with us?” Mu Bai sighed.

Mu Bai was blaming himself for Golden Sun Knight Jiang Bin’s fate. If he had known the Black Vatican was involved, he would not have put the Knight’s life in danger!

“The three of us are nowhere near enough to take on the Black Vatican... Speaking of which, shouldn’t we focus on looking for the Totem Beasts with Jiang Shaoxu and Lingling?” Zhao Manyan proposed.

He felt like searching for Totem Beasts was a safer option. He still remembered what had happened when they went looking for the Cold Prince. It felt like they were walking on thin ice at all times. He did not want to experience that again!

“Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu are still searching for clues. We don’t have any accurate information on any of the Totem Beasts that we haven’t already discovered. Now that you have reminded me, we shouldn’t tell them about the Black Vatican, either,” Mo Fan said quietly.

Going against the Black Vatican was beyond dangerous. Regardless of how clever Lingling was, Mo Fan did not want the Black Vatican to go after her!

Mo Fan had already prepared himself to share the same fate as Xu Zhaoting when he decided to take on the Black Vatican!

“So you are saying my life is cheap like yours is? You can choose not to tell me about the Black Vatican too, since I don’t have the resolution that you two do. I just want to be a carefree writer like Harper, the kind who writes whenever he feels like, instead of being urged to write everyday just to meet a word count!” Zhao Manyan protested.

Zhao Manyan noticed both Mo Fan and Mu Bai were staring at him as he was grumbling. The looks in their eyes were making him uncomfortable. He eventually sighed and said, “Fine, I’m in. I might not hold a strong grudge against the Black Vatican, but without me, the Black Vatican is going to chop you both into pieces at any second. It’s going to be boring without you two as comparison whenever I put on airs and hook up with the ladies!”

Mo Fan was very familiar with Zhao Manyan’s personality. He would play as hard to get as a woman most of the time. He might say no, but his body was very honest.

Even if Mo Fan and Mu Bai had asked Zhao Manyan to not involve himself, he would have said no!

“By the way, there’s one more thing. Mo Fan, I need you to ask your lover about something. Thanks to her, I learned Spectre was going to disguise himself as a member of the Black Church,” Mu Bai suddenly recalled.

“My lover? Where did that even come from? Asha’ruiya and I are just friends,” Mo Fan said.

Both Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan believed Mo Fan’s relationship with Asha’ruiya was beyond friendship. Otherwise, why would a Saintess bother helping him? Mo Fan would claim they were both benefiting from it, yet Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan did not think Mo Fan was giving her any help. On the other hand, Asha’ruiya’s information had proven useful many times!

“I thought you two were just f**k buddies? Since when did you two become friends?” Zhao Manyan pretended to be surprised.

“F**k buddies my ass, I didn’t even touch those two chicks who lived in the same house with me. It’s important for a man to practice self-control, don’t you understand?” Mo Fan swore.

“You are just being a coward.”

“Coward my ass!”

“Go ahead and prove me wrong, then. You can settle that little vixen Asha’ruiya first and eat the two golden sparrows you are keeping in Shanghai later. A man must be free and at ease. The worst thing you can do is let a woman down!” Zhao Manyan declared proudly.

“Can you two idiots stop yelling at one another? I forgot what I was going to say.”

“Shut up, Green Tea Virgin!” Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan yelled back at the same time.

Mu Bai’s face twitched.

He had already had enough of being called Green Tea Man by them. He might have acted like a little prick in high school because he was not mature enough, but he definitely did not deserve to be called a Green Tea Man now.

What the heck did they mean by calling him Green Tea Virgin?

It might only differ by one word, but the damage it dealt to Mu Bai’s pride had multiplied!

Forget about risking their lives to go against the Black Vatican. He swore he would tear these two assh**** into pieces today!

The three needed new identities if they wanted to infiltrate the Black Vatican.

The Black Vatican would not set up its headquarters in the remote mountains or in a pirate cove. They were hiding at every level in society. They were just like ordinary people before their identities were exposed. They might be a businessman, an office worker, a civil Mage, an official, or common folks.

Similarly, Mr. Lin’s plantation was not hidden in a secret location. It was established inside a reputable university in the Americas!

When Mr. Lin’s daughter complained to Harper, she suspected her father was having an affair with a student from the university there.

To think that the Black Vatican was producing the Frenzy Spring Water at a university. The Holy Judgment Court and Enforcement Union would never have guessed, nor them, if it was not for Harper’s sex diary!

“Well, it’s not impossible for you to go there as exchange students, but it might arouse suspicion to request something like that all of a sudden,” Dean Xiao informed them.

“Is there any way we can be assigned there in a more natural way?” Mo Fan inquired calmly.

“Patience, I’ve already asked the national team. There seems to be a conference for mentors being held at the university. In simpler words, many lecturers from different universities will come to our school and attend courses that will last for a few months. We can also send our teachers over there,” Dean Xiao told him.

“You’re asking me to be a lecturer?” Mo Fan’s eyes widened.

“Yes, did you forget you are still a qualified mentor of our school? You did a good job last time,” Dean Xiao praised him.

“Ugh... I think so?” Mo Fan agreed awkwardly.

“If you go there as a student, you will need to control your strength as part of your disguise, but if you go as a lecturer, it’s a lot more convenient for you. You don’t have to conceal your strength. Besides, you will have a lot more power than a student to help you find the things you are looking for,” Dean Xiao said.

Mo Fan nodded. Dean Xiao was truly a wise man!

Being a lecturer at a university? The thought was already sounding quite exciting to him!
