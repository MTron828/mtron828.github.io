“Can’t your leg recover? You’re a great mage in the Imperial Capital. You should be able to find some top Healing Mages to heal your injury,” said a young woman who looked to be in her twenties.

“This is the scary part of the Extreme South Land. The injuries you have suffered there will probably accompany you for the rest of your life. After you get there, you must treat the wound in time, even if it is a small cut. Once those “chronic poisons” erode your wound, you might live with it your entire life,” explained Wang Shuo.

“Mr. Wang, please don’t scare me. I hate having scars!” the woman exclaimed.

“That place will only be even more terrifying and unpredictable. I am not sure why the association is asking two little girls to travel with us. Your level of cultivation doesn’t seem very high,” Wang Shuo said as he looked at Mu Ningxue and the woman in charge of logistics and food.

“Cough. Cough. Brother Wang, this is Mu Ningxue from Fanxue Mountain. She is the person we are going to escort to the Extreme South Land,” said a Royal Great Mage.

The woman in charge of logistics and food hadn’t known about this. She turned around in surprise to look at the quiet Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue wore a black mask to keep the cold out, and her long white-silver hair was strikingly noticeable. However, Wang Shuo and the woman thought it was a dyeing method that young girls liked these days. They did not expect her to be Mu Ningxue, the key person in this important mission.

This mission was led by a Forbidden Mage, who was assigned to protect her. It showed how important the person they escorted was.

“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were Miss Mu.” Wang Shuo apologized, but his eyes seemed to express some other emotion.

He probably could not understand why a female Ice Elemental Mage was considered this important.

Back then, Wang Shuo went to the Antarctic Continent on behalf of the Imperial Capital Exploration Team, and the Imperial Capital only dispatched a few young Royal Mages. Because of those inexperienced and ignorant people, the team was trapped in the ice storm. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wang Shuo wasn’t clear about the exact task of this mission. Nevertheless, it was overblown to dispatch a Forbidden Mage and an entire team for exploration, arming, logistics, and emergency response to accompany a female Ice Elemental Mage to the Antarctic Continent.

“Wow, you are Mu Ningxue? I was in the same grade as you when I was in Imperial College,” said Yan Lan, the woman in charge of logistics.

“Yeah.” Mu Ningxue gave a short response. She had no intention of chatting.

However, Yan Lan was talkative. Perhaps it was Mu Ningxue’s mask covering her cold expression, or perhaps it was the simple-minded nature of Yan Lan, but she seemed excited and kept talking about all kinds of things about Imperial College.

“At that time, our grade had a lot of young talents, and each of them was a dazzling star. After everyone graduated, many people who were famous in school became ordinary. On the other hand, some people who didn’t have much fame started to stand out. Mu Ningxue, you have always been the most talked-about person when the alumni meet. For some reason, everyone likes to mention you. We talked about how you won the World College Tournament, established Fanxue Mountain, defeated various young and powerful mages, entered Mu Pang Mountain alone… Everyone calls you a Goddess! Can I call you the same in the future? If you don’t answer, I will take your silence as a “yes”. In fact, after talking for a long time, Goddess Mu sounds friendly. All the juniors also liked to call you that.”

Yan Lan rambled on. She had finally met the famous person everyone talked about.

Mu Ningxue felt a little emotional when she heard Yan Lan mention the school. She did not say anything and quietly listened to Yan Lan.

Yan Lan seemed to know the past and present of the people in the whole school. She could talk a lot about one person, which made the boring itinerary a little more interesting.

“By the way, Mr. Wei Guang is also a student of the Imperial College. He is our senior. When he became a Forbidden Mage, it caused a stir in our school. If you attend the Homecoming, you will see his photos hanging all over the campus. He should be the youngest Forbidden Mage of this era. I heard that few people knew about Wei Guang before. I wonder what rare encounter he had. Even foreign countries were scrambling to report it,” Yan Lan continued.

Yan Lan babble. Wei Guang was walking toward them. He glanced at Yan Lan and then at Mu Ningxue.

“You can voice out if you have any complaints and requirements. Our team will try our best to meet your expectations. If you have any discomfort, let us know as soon as possible. If you need food, clothes, or special things, you can let her know,” Wei Guang pointed at Yan Lan.

Yan Lan smiled. When she looked at Wei Guang, her eyes lit up in joy. She admired him a lot.

“Mr. Wei Guang, the three of us are alumni,” Yan Lan said.

“So what?” Wei Guang asked.

“Uh…” Yan Lan was a talkative girl, but she did not know how to respond to Wei Guang.

Yan Lan lowered her head and looked at Mu Ningxue, as if she had done something wrong. Mu Ningxue patted her lightly on her shoulders to provide some comfort.

Seeing that Mu Ningxue had nothing to say, Wei Guang returned to his position.

After Wei Guang left, Yan Lan said cautiously, “Wei Guang doesn’t seem to like me. Am I too talkative?”

“He is likely too proud of himself,” Mu Ningxue responded indifferently.

Wei Guang was quite proud, and Mu Ningxue had felt it the moment he stepped into the conference hall of Fanxue Mountain. The way he looked at other people, and the tone of voice always held a certain impatience.

“But he has the right to be proud. After all, not everyone can become a Forbidden Mage, and there are not many people who can have great achievements and become famous at such a young age,” said Yan Lan.

The colder the other person was, the more Yan Lan felt that that was the temperament that an unattainable person should have. It would make Yan Lan think that the other person was less mysterious and respectable if Wei Guang was approachable and friendly.

“Maybe.”

“Oh, I almost forgot. Everyone said that you are the most difficult to approach. You won’t pay attention to anyone, as if everyone in this world is a pile of garbage… I’m sorry. I heard this from a senior, but I don’t think it is true. Is it because I often listen to everyone talking about you, so I naturally feel that you are someone who has been by my side all this time?” Yan Lan suddenly realized.

Mu Ningxue smiled. For a girl with a simple mind like Yan Lan, she did not need to be cold toward her.
