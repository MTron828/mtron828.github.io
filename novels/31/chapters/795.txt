The death penalty was a rather complicated punishment. It did not simply mean taking the lives of the people who had committed serious offenses.

For someone with unforgivable crimes and misdeeds, killing them was not the best punishment. The pain inflicted on the others for the people they killed and their evil deeds would last for years or even tens of years. If they were simply put on electrical chairs or finished off with guns, it would free the criminals instead!

A real, scary punishment did not only consist of a bullet, since that would only inflict a swift pain and eradicate them. It was keeping them alive while taking away their freedom. It was imprisoning them for life inside a pitch-black, cold cage, where they would never see the sunlight or any other human being.

Japan’s Enforcement Union had already canceled the death sentence. The criminals who had committed serious offenses were imprisoned for life instead.

However, since most of the criminals had incredible capabilities and strong cultivation, a normal prison would not be able to hold these evil Magicians. The East Guardian Tower was specifically built to imprison these Magicians.

Basically, the worst criminals that Japan ever had were all kept in the East Guardian Tower, including Magicians who were strong enough to wipe out an entire city, and evil Magicians who were indulged in practicing black magic...

The common evil Magicians were not worthy to be kept here, meaning that those who were kept here were the real devils!

Mochizuki Chihaya’s clan had long supervised the high-class prison. The way the Twin Guardian Towers was constructed basically guaranteed that criminals who were imprisoned here had no chance of escaping. The only way out was the drawbridge to the other side, but that place was basically a military fortress!

Mo Fan subconsciously shivered after learning the truth.

The West Guardian Tower looked like a unique place that seemed to be the combination of a fortress, an academy, and a training hall, yet the tower on the other side turned out to be a prison imprisoning the worst murderers of mankind. As a woman, wouldn’t she feel uncomfortable sleeping every night?

“The evil Magicians of other countries are kept here too. It’s known as the highest-class prison for Magicians in Asia,” added Mochizuki Chihaya.

“If all the devilish Magicians are kept here, aren’t you guys worried that they would team up and tear the East Guardian Tower down? I don’t believe they would have trouble destroying a small tower, considering the evil deeds they have done?” said Mo Fan.

“As long as the formations are active, they are just a bunch of normal people. Their souls are stamped with criminal seals. If they try to use magic, the formations will attack them instantly... besides, the East Guardian Tower has been under a Curse for a very long time. Anyone who stays in there for a long time will have their energy and souls drained slowly. The cultivation of a Super Magician will degrade to the Basic Level in ten years,” explained Mochizuki Chihaya.

“Doesn’t that mean we’re under the effect of the curse, too?” blurted out Mo Fan.

“The short duration won’t bring any harm to us. Come with me, don’t fall behind. The place is constructed with a Shadow Formation, too. The whole structure is like a maze. There’s no way you will be able to tell the directions without a certain trick...” reminded Mochizuki Chihaya. She only took a few steps when Mo Fan bumped into her from behind. She glared at him and snapped, “There’s no need to stay so close to me!”

“Let’s go back, this place feels very weird!” Mo Fan had the urge to run away.

“Are you scared?”

“I was worried about your safety. Think about it, it has been years since the criminals in here have seen a woman, and considering your body...uhh, forget what I said.”

The walkways inside the East Guardian Tower were extremely narrow. Mo Fan did not understand the layout inside the structure. Judging from the narrow paths, stairs, and corridors, it felt like eighty percent of the space inside the tower was taken up by walls.

“I have to tell you something, as a friendly reminder... the duels between your team and the gatekeepers were all recorded. I believe they are going to send the recordings to the national team.” Mochizuki Chihaya was a righteous person. It seemed like she could not accept some of the things that they did.

It was proper to ask the Chinese team for permission if they wanted to record the duels.

“It’s not a big deal.” Mo Fan was not too bothered by it. After all, he had yet to use his full strength. There was no need to be concerned about the little tricks that the Japanese used.

The place was deadly quiet. Mo Fan was not a fan of silence. He remembered the alarm from before and asked, “What was the gigantic creature from before? Is it related to the incident here in the East Guardian Tower?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I have no idea, but I don’t think a creature of that level would be controlled so easily...” Mochizuki Chihaya fell into deep thought.

“You haven’t told me who the person that uses the same Soul Seed as yours is. Why did he kill the guards?” asked Mo Fan.

“I have a half-brother that grew up together with me, but he suddenly went missing last year, and we still haven’t found him...” Mochizuki Chihaya hesitated for a moment, but she still decided to spill the beans.

“So you’re here to look for him?” asked Mo Fan curiously.

“Mm, the Plant Seeds we have are called Stems. They have two flowers on a stem, so both my brother and I took one,” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

“So you’re saying that the person who killed the guards is most likely your elder brother, Iwata? No wonder the Soul Seed was the same as yours, a gray-blue Chinese bellflower. Then again, this prison is full of evil criminals, why is your brother Iwata here?...” wondered Mo Fan.

“That’s something I’m trying to find out too...Commander Takagi is responsible for the criminals in here. If my brother is secretly imprisoned here, he would definitely know something about it. My brother might not have the surname Mochizuki, but he’s loyal to the West Guardian Tower too. He would never commit any criminal offense... I have to find out the truth!” said Mochizuki Chihaya firmly.

“But he killed three guards!” interjected Mo Fan.

Mochizuki Chihaya glared at him and said defensively, “He was left with no choice!”

“Let’s just find him first. Do you know where they are keeping him?”

“If he’s the one that stirred up the mess, they would surely bring him to that place...” Mochizuki Chihaya said confidently.
