1650 A Continent-Level Authority

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Xinxia did not expect the incident of the young Tyrant Titan’s heart and the incident on Mount Lanmu were related. However, she could not get any useful information from Bude. The guy might be terrified, but he still managed to keep a clear mind. He knew he no longer had a future at the Parthenon Temple, so his connection with the other side was his only hope!

However, it did not necessarily mean they had no way of getting the information, even if someone was unwilling to spill it the beans...

Mo Fan had almost recovered by the time he went to the prison cell. He had a proud grin on as he stared at the captive Bude.

Bude’s robe of rank had been torn off him. His hair was as messy as a stray dog. He had never imagined he would lose his title, especially when he had been dreaming of becoming a Great Priest soon!

The Parthenon Temple was very strict with their punishments. If someone failed to fulfill their duties or abused their power, the Parthenon Temple might even remove their power as a Mage!

“I told you I was going to make you pay ten times for what you did. Why don’t you look at yourself in the mirror? They were using you like a simple-minded ox!” Mo Fan tapped on the rail. Bude had an urge to beat the crap out of him on seeing his grin.

“Humph, I will soon be free, even if I am no longer a Mage. As for you, you ignorant prick, you have no idea who you are up against! If that person wants you to disappear from this world, you won’t even have a tombstone for your grave!” Bude snarled back.

Be free? Mo Fan smirked.

That was not going to happen. People that made a mistake at the Parthenon Temple would never be able to live as normal people. They would be given strenuous work constantly to atone for their crimes. Bude had provoked a Candidate. Even if Xinxia was not going to pick on him, how about the people that were trying to pander to her?

Xinxia might not have that much power in the Parthenon Temple, but it did not necessarily mean no one was trying to get in her good graces!

“Oh? Why don’t you tell me who I’m up against? I, Mo Fan, have always been fearless before gods and demons. You should threaten me to let you go by telling me his name. How does that sound?” Mo Fan proposed.

“I won’t tell you!” Bude spat.

“I know you won’t! Apas, it’s all you now,” Mo Fan said cheerfully.

Apas went up to Bude. Her beautiful amber eyes locked his gaze.

Bude looked at the young woman whose beauty was beyond human. He was a little confused when the young woman suddenly turned into a man in a brown coat.

Bude was overjoyed. He had made the right choice! That person did come to save him!...

Mo Fan frowned. He left the prison with a stern face.

“Do you know the guy?” the Blue Star Knight Kris asked when he saw Mo Fan’s reaction.

“No, I don’t know him,” Mo Fan shook his head.

“Then why the reaction? I thought it was someone with a formidable background. By the way, this young woman is so impressive. She managed to place Bude under an illusion. It didn’t take long to make him say the name!” Kris complimented her.

“The guy Ferran who Bude mentioned is actually someone with great power. He’s currently an elder of Dubai’s Magic Association, and also the Vice President of Athens’ Magic Association. Not only is he powerful, he has wide connections across many countries. It explains why Bude was trying so hard to stop us,” Mu Ningxue informed him.

“A Continent-level Elder?” Kris exclaimed.

Mo Fan’s eyes widened. He had assumed Ferran was no ordinary person, but he did not expect him to be an authority at the Continental level!

It was likely that he was even more powerful than a Councilman!

Mo Fan was not very familiar with the Magic Associations, but he knew their directors mostly consisted of a bunch of old monsters. The elders of the Asian Continental Magic Association were most likely around the same level as Pang Lai!

If this Ferran was responsible for everything, would they even have a chance to stop him with their current strength?

“I bet even Xinxia would have trouble stopping him if she intervened,” Mu Ningxue said.

“I agree. An elder of the Asia Continent Magic Association wouldn’t necessarily treat a Candidate of the Parthenon Temple seriously. He might even turn against her if he’s on Izisha’s side,” Mo Fan said. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They could not afford to rely on the Parthenon Temple to apply pressure on a Continent-level authority. The Parthenon Temple was part of Europe. Even though the Five Continents were supposed to be the highest authority in the world, the Parthenon Temple’s influence had surpassed theirs lately. In some ways, the Five Continents were not too fond of the Parthenon Temple.

A Magic Association was involved, and it was at the Continent-level... There was hardly anything they could do!

“If it’s really that tricky, let’s not worry about it anymore,” Mu Ningxue said.

It was important to act within their capabilities. If their enemy was someone like a Councilman, they might still have a chance, but their target was an elder of a Continental Magic Association. The position alone was untouchable, since only the Holy Judgment Court could judge him. Even if the Holy Judgment Court deemed the person guilty, they had to consider the fact if they were strong enough to arrest the guy!

The Holy Judgment Court had lost some of their experts when they were arresting Essendale, who was deemed the strongest Shadow Mage. They had to Summon the Greek God of Death, Hayla, to defeat him!

“Let’s regroup with the others and see if they have discovered anything new. This Ferran might not be responsible for collecting the Tyrant Titan’s hearts and the children’s hearts. He might only be lending Bartholomew a hand,” Mo Fan said.

“Let’s hope that’s the case,” Mu Ningxue said.

If an authority like him turned out to be the culprit, it was only going to bring more misfortune to the world!

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue regrouped with Brianca, Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai, and Heidi after Mo Fan fully recovered from his injuries. The Blue Star Knight Kris, who had nothing better to do, followed them. He was a representative of the Parthenon Temple. If anything happened, an enemy would avoid crossing the line, knowing the Parthenon Temple was involved.

Mo Fan did not want Xinxia to be involved, as they had yet to find out the truth. It was more appropriate to ask Xinxia for help later. After all, they needed to find evidence first. If they did not catch Bartholomew and retrieve the children’s hearts, they had no chance of stopping a great authority of the Magic Association!

Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, and Kris followed the trail left by Brianca and the others. They crossed Mount Lanmu and headed west along the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.

“Kris, this Steel Griffin isn’t too bad! Where did you find him?” Mo Fan asked.

The griffin had a metallic sheen as it soared across the sky. Its reflection was visible on the surface of the sea not far below. The people on the ground lifted their heads with envious faces.

The Steel Griffin was Kris’ Contracted Beast. Not only was it a ferocious beast, it was a reliable mount, too. It could effortlessly carry Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, Apas, and Kris on its back!

“My family spent all their savings on it. It’s also the reason I was promoted to a Blue Star Knight from a probationary knight so quickly, but I’ve let my family down,” Kris answered.

“You didn’t let your family down. I know you’re a good person. Keep it up, I might recommend you to Xinxia, so you can serve under that expressionless Apollo,” Mo Fan encouraged him.

“Are...are you serious? I’ve always admired Knight Apollo. I’ve been working hard to become one of the Twelve Olympians, too!” Kris blurted out excitedly.

“It takes a lot of training to become stronger,” Mo Fan chuckled.

Xinxia had a regiment of knights, led by Apollo. It was made up of Blue Star Knights and Golden Sun Knights. The knights would always be on her side, whether or not she won the election and became the Goddess. The knights would be loyal to her even if she quit the election!

“Thank you so much!” Kris said with a sincere smile. He did not expect his kindness to give him a chance to return to the Hall of Knights!

Mo Fan wrapped his hands around the back of his head and exclaimed, “Ah, I’ve always wanted a flying Contracted Beast. Such a pity, I accidentally wasted my second Contract on someone!”

Apas was right beside Mo Fan. It was obvious who he was referring to. The successor of Queen Medusa almost jumped up and bit the shameless prick to death!

Apas withheld her anger and answered coldly, -Get rid of the Contract, and I’ll give you a Golden Serpent with nine wings, a Ruler-level creature!-

-Forget it, I think you have a greater potential than the Golden Serpent. It’s fine if you can’t fly, but I can still ride you if it’s necessary. I wonder if there’s any spell that can let me fly once I reach the Super Level!- Mo Fan replied shamelessly.

Mo Fan was communicating with Apas mentally. If Mu Ningxue knew what he had said, she would have kicked him off the griffin from a height of a thousand meters! On the surface, Apas seemed to have no idea what Mo Fan was hinting at, and did not treat his words seriously.

She had been enduring every day!

The most important thing she learned from wandering in human territories to escape from her sisters over the years was nothing other than endurance!

One day, she would figure out a way to bite Mo Fan on the neck without harming herself. She would poison the shameless prick to death with her deadly venom!
