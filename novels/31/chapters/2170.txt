Chapter 2172: Spectre’s Magic Trick

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Mu Bai avoided the people of the Black Church and safely reached a cave close to the olive grove.

The Tyrant Titans did indeed fancy poppies a lot. It was normal for them to go berserk after eating too many of the opiate flowers. However, as an herbalist, Mu Bai had a feeling that something was not right.

“This must be where Mr. Lin was secretly planting the poppies. How many kilograms of poppies did a two-hundred-meter tall titan have to eat to lose its cool? Mo Fan fought the Cross Mark Demon Titan for so long, yet it didn’t really lose control of itself. It still targeted him after the Corrupted Black Moon appeared. It didn’t attack others indiscriminately...” Mu Bai murmured to himself as he went into the cave.

The cave was soaked in cold seawater, and the poppies were all drowned. The Parthenon Temple and the military obviously had not discovered the place. They might have searched the cave, but they did not link the incident on Green Sprouts Island with the poppies.

Mu Bai took off his jacket and dove into the water.

He soon found some decomposing petals from the poppies in the water. The stems and leaves were piled up at the bottom of the pool. Mu Bai swiftly collected the flowers and seeds that were still intact and carried them to the surface.

Mu Bai placed the flowers and seeds on his palm and analyzed their composition.

The flowers and seeds oozed a clear liquid when Mu Bai applied pressure to them. The liquid permeated Mu Bai’s skin and slowly entered his blood.

A few minutes later, Mu Bai’s face began to redden and heat up. Blue veins surfaced on his body as a strong urge to kill filled his mind, like a thirsty man desperately searching for water!

Mu Bai quickly used his Poison Element to remove the strange substance from his blood. Ten minutes later, he found himself soaked in sweat after he fully recovered.

“What just happened... does this mean the poppies aren’t the only thing that caused the incident?” Mu Bai murmured.

Strong waves kept coming from the distance, obviously caused by the battle between Mo Fan and the Cross Mark Demon Titan. The trees that were soaked in water swayed continuously and created a mist in the area.

The mist was spreading toward the land. A faint outline appeared behind a tree around three hundred meters away from Mu Bai. It was spying on Mu Bai as he was deep in thought.

Mu Bai seemed to notice something. He looked in the direction of the figure, but it had already disappeared, as if it was just his imagination in the strong wind.

Mu Bai was lost in thought for a moment. He stowed the flowers and seeds of the poppies in a transparent bag, deciding to bring them back to conduct thorough experiments on them.

The figure that vanished appeared behind Mu Bai. It no longer looked like some optical illusion occurring because of the wind. It was raising something that resembled a scalpel, and slicing at the back of Mu Bai’s neck! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The figure let out a strange chuckle, as if it was pleased with itself.

It was waiting for fresh blood to jet out from Mu Bai’s neck, but instead a layer of frost suddenly surfaced on his skin there. Not a single drop of blood jetted out.

The figure was startled. It immediately stabbed Mu Bai again.

Mu Bai’s body shattered like ice. He had turned into an ice statue in the mist!

“I won’t fall for the same trick twice!” Mu Bai slowly walked out from the shadows around a hundred meters away. The leaves of the olive trees were drifting around in the open area. His eyes were fixed on the figure in the mist.

“Tsk!” the figure in the mist uttered anxiously.

The figure vanished into thin air with a gust of wind. It seemed to have merged with the mist and faded into the distance.

“You won’t escape so easily this time!” Mu Bai stared at the spot where the figure had stood previously.

Did the killer think he could trick him with such a petty trick?

It looked as if the mist and the leaves had flown into the distance, yet Mu Bai knew it was just a little trick.

His enemy was still in the same spot!

It was like a transparent cloth on a white wall. The person under the cloth was using the wall to camouflage himself when the cloth was flipped upward. Mu Bai might have fallen for it in the past, giving his enemy the chance to ambush him from behind, but he had seen a lot of similar tricks in the Dark Plane. To him, Spectre’s tricks were as laughable as a clown’s act.

“Are you trying to deceive yourself?” Mu Bai’s eyes remained fixed on the same spot.

He flicked his finger, firing ice spears at the figure from different angles!

The ice spears surrounded the spot and attacked from all angles. A black shadow suddenly appeared out of nowhere, like a rat looking for food in a bin. It quickly ran past and snuck into a little gap nearby.

“Show yourself!” Mu Bai demanded.

Rows of ice spears lunged at the little gap and blasted it apart. A black shadow jumped out of the crack in a panic, before charging at Mu Bai as if it was his last resort!

The true attack came out of nowhere. Mu Bai did not have time to react after firing the ice spears. However, his body only shattered like an ice statue again.

“You’re not the only one with tricks up your sleeves!”

Mu Bai appeared on the other side. More ice spears were emerging in the area where he had been standing at previously!

The number of ice spears was shocking. There were hundreds of them on the ground, clustered as densely as bamboo shoots!

It was only the first wave. More ice spears were forming above the shadow in all directions. There were enough ice spears to form a cage and trap the shadow when they were stuck together!

There was not a single gap between the ice spears. Their tips were pointing at the shadow in the center. They eventually formed a sphere as they converged, trapping the shadow!

“Is my life really that valuable to you, Spectre?” Mu Bai asked coldly as he stood in the cage he had created.
