The wind started growing from a breeze to a strong gust. Mo Fan’s skin was hurting from even the slightest touch of the wind. He glanced around himself and discovered that he was surrounded by layers of an orange-yellow sandstorm.

The killing sand’s attack was incredibly high to begin with, but it was even deadlier after it was sped up by the strong wind.

“Wind Element!” Mo Fan’s heart sank.

Throughout the fight, Casso had only used two Elements. He had not shown his third Element at all, but now, after suffering a serious injury, he was finally willing to use all his strength!

Casso’s Earth Element and Poison Element were both quite outstanding. If it wasn’t for the upgrade to Little Flame Belle’s strength, he simply had no chance of matching Casso’s strength. But now, Casso had displayed his Wind Element. Even Mo Fan was intimidated by the seemingly-calm yet powerful wind, as if he had caught a little glimpse of a storm at sea. He could easily imagine how disastrous the storm was!

-The guy’s strongest Element isn’t the Earth Element, nor was it the Poison Element. It’s the Wind Element!-

“You are barely a worthy opponent for me, but too bad it’s coming to an end, since I have had enough fun today!” A grin slowly surfaced on Casso’s stiff flesh.

Casso suddenly vanished into thin air!

Mo Fan was shocked. He immediately cast Space Rhythm: Time Stasis to slow everything down. However, even in the space under the effects of the Time Stasis, Mo Fan could only see a blurred shadow!

“I’m eager to see how thick your armor is!” Casso’s voice suddenly appeared beside Mo Fan.

Mo Fan could not react in time. Casso grabbed Mo Fan’s throat in his muscular arms. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Casso’s strength was shocking. Mo Fan felt like his throat was being held by a monstrous titan; he was having trouble breaking free from it!

While it was happening, Mo Fan saw a pair of giant wings made of orange-yellow wind appearing on Casso’s back. The wings were mixed with wind and sand. They sounded like a helicopter when they were beating rapidly!

Casso grabbed Mo Fan and soared into the sky. The Sky Veil and tornado stuck closely to his feet, propelling him over three hundred meters into the sky!

The clouds were right above their heads. Mo Fan could see all of White Head City from his current height.

Casso’s strength was not enough to snap Mo Fan’s neck while he was wearing the Black Snake Armor. He treated Mo Fan like a stone and hurled him at the ground.

Mo Fan did not have the ability to fly. As he was falling, he saw a giant rock less than thirty meters above him falling at the same speed.

The side of the rock that was pointing at him was sharp, and the other end was flat. Casso was standing on the flat end and stomping his feet on the rock to speed it up and further increase its momentum!

The sharp end struck Mo Fan while he was still in the air. The pain was still bearable since he was still falling in the air. However, Mo Fan clearly knew that his body would be smashed to pieces when he landed on the ground with the rock pressing down on him!

The wind howled in his ears. He was falling too quickly. He would most likely fall to his death even without the rock pressing down on him.

“HAHAHAHA, HAHAHA!” Casso stood on the falling rock. He held his arms and burst out laughing. It was time to bury this arrogant kid!

“Mo Fan!” Zhao Manyan raised his head and was shocked to see Mo Fan falling through the air at a terrifying pace with a pointy rock pressing down on him.

The boulder-sized rock was going to plunge Mo Fan into the ground. There was no way he could survive the impact!

“Go, protect him!” Zhao Manyan clenched his teeth. A wooden clapper carved with ancient runes immediately flew into the sky.

As soon as the wooden clapper appeared, it unleashed a spiraling golden light. The light swiftly transformed into a golden barrier in the shape of an enormous wooden clapper, catching Mo Fan as he fell from the sky.

The golden barrier quickly surrounded Mo Fan. The runes seemed to transform into a sturdy armor!

BANG!

The rock plunged into the ground. Both the boats and the waters swayed wildly after the loud impact. Rocks and dirt broke off from the solid ground of the harbor. Lines of shocking cracks spread across the place, as if the whole harbor was going to break into pieces and fall into the water.

“Mo Fan!” Jiang Shaoxu’s eyes widened as she let out a scream, staring at the pit.

The impact was so strong that no one could get close to it. There was no chance Mo Fan could survive the impact on his own.

“Shit, he’s dead!”

“Damn it, we’re so close to completing the formation. We’ve been too careless!” Oleena said with a hint of self-accusation.

They should have intervened instead of being eager for a quick success. After all, the young man was only a student. There was no chance he could take on the greatest tyrant of the Caribbean Sea alone.

“What do we do now...”

“Keep going, we can’t let Casso escape now!” Oleena said firmly.

The main reason why they were unwilling to show themselves was because Casso was an Advanced Mage with the Earth and Wind Elements. A Mage with these two Elements had unmatchable speed. No one could possibly stop him if he wanted to escape. On top of that, he was daring enough to apply the Poison Element to his own body, turning himself into a monster. Many Sacred Hall Mages had died at his hands!

They initially hoped that the student would be able to take down Casso on their behalf. Who knew that Casso would kill the student straightaway when they were busy constructing the Light Binding Formation. They did not even have time to save him...

“Mo Fan, don’t you f**king die!” cursed Zhao Manyan.

Didn’t he warn Mo Fan not to meddle in someone else’s business? Why didn’t Mo Fan take his advice seriously? Didn’t he know how strong the Red Ornaments Guild was? That Casso had three Elements in the Advanced Level! Even everyone teaming up would still have had trouble defeating him!

“Do you seriously have the time to care about others? How ridiculous,” the dark-skinned, female bandit uttered a hollow laugh. “Without that thing, your defense isn’t impressive!”

An icy glow flickered on the female bandit’s hand. A spear made of ice appeared in her hands before thrusting fiercely at Zhao Manyan’s Rock Barrier!

As soon as the ice spear made contact with the Rock Barrier, it turned into ice instantly. The spear then broke the Rock Barrier into pieces that scattered across the ground.

“A Magic Spear...”

Zhao Manyan immediately regretted his decision. The spear came up to him and performed a dance of death around him. The spear soon left lots of cuts and blood on his body after he lost his defense.

There were now at least ten bleeding cuts on Zhao Manyan’s body. He initially thought he had chosen someone he could easily defeat. To his surprise, the dark-skinned woman was incredibly strong. Zhao Manyan was no longer able to hold his ground without the wooden clapper that doubled the effects of his defensive spells.

“A competition of magic equipment? Humph, not many people in this world have more magic equipment than I do!” Zhao Manyan was too stubborn to admit his defeat. He immediately summoned his magic boots and Deathstrike Magic Equipment!

Both pieces of magic equipment were of the Light Element. The light encapsulating Zhao Manyan’s figure immediately overwhelmed the icy spear in the woman’s hands.

“There’s more!” Zhao Manyan spread his arms. Golden feathers appeared gradually and formed a pair of glowing, golden wings.

Zhao Manyan had summoned three pieces of magic equipment within an instant, and judging from their auras, each piece was more or less a luxury good. The female bandit was startled.

Leaving the Deathstrike Magic Equipment and the magic boots aside, it was still absolutely ridiculous that the man would own Magic Wings at his age. Even all the loot that the female bandit had scavenged over many years were not enough to buy her Magic Wings!

Zhao Manyan was still fully kitted out with Magic Equipment, even without the wooden clapper!

The others might laugh at Zhao Manyan for having the weakest cultivation on the team, but no one could possibly own a better set of Equipment than him!

“Blessing of the Fountain Ring!”

Zhao Manyan did not stop after summoning the three pieces of magic equipment. The middle finger of his right hand started glowing, as the seemingly ordinary blue ring suddenly emitted a sacred glow.

“Water Barrier!” The circulating Water Barrier revolved around Zhao Manyan. A few more Water Barriers appeared under the effects of the ring’s sacred light. Zhao Manyan was only able to apply four or five stacks of Water Barrier normally, but with the help of the ring, the number almost doubled. He now had around eight layers of Water Barrier circling him endlessly!

“Fierce Rolling Wave!”

The effects of the ring were able to strengthen every Water Spell Zhao Manyan had. The ordinary Rolling Wave had now turned into a surging tide, lunging at the female bandit like a beast.

The woman nimbly jumped onto a boat to find some cover. Zhao Manyan flew onto the rolling tide and fired a golden crescent forward with his Deathstrike Magic Equipment...

The slash was utterly shocking, cutting through prow of the boat with ease. The woman was forced to summon her Magic Armor, yet even with its protection, the slash still sliced her arm off. Blood started pouring out from the cut unendingly!

“Serves you right!” Zhao Manyan uttered sarcastically, staring at the woman whose lips had gone pale.

The woman trembled in anger. She had never seen a Mage as rich as the man before her. He had just used four pieces of Magic Equipment in one breath, and it seemed like he still had more on standby, including his necklace, his bracelet, and the other three rings on his other hand...

With a series of bone-cracking sounds, Mo Fan out from the debris and rose to his feet. His Black Snake Armor had turned into scrap. Not a single spot of his skin was unmarred.

Pain, he was in extreme pain. The burning sensation felt like he had been set on fire.

Luckily, his Demon Element had come in handy. His body was actually several times stronger than ordinary Mages. That being said, he was glad that Zhao Manyan had tossed the wooden clapper at him. Otherwise, he would have been unable to survive the impact with only the Black Snake Armor and his sturdy flesh.

“He’s still alive?” Casso exclaimed in astonishment as he stared at Mo Fan with wide-open eyes. -Is this guy’s body made of steel!?-

Even with two layers of protection, the impact was more than enough to shatter every bone inside the body of an Advanced Mage!

Meanwhile, the guy only looked like he was suffering from serious injuries, but none of them were life-threatening!
