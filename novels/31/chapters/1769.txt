Chapter 1770: Black-Silver Rock Demon

Translated by XephiZ

Wen Xia was surprisingly quick, and adept at using the Earth Wave. She could manipulate flat and angled terrain to increase her speed, like she had put on a pair of boots that had zero friction with the ground. It felt like she was riding the wind as she surfed across the waves.

Mo Fan’s control was outstanding, and he was learning from the more experienced Earth Maga on the spot to catch up to her. He was also skidding across the surfaces, but unlike Wen Xia, who was nimbly dodging the attacks of the Rock Monsters and jumping around, Mo Fan was more like a rookie who had put on ice skates for the first time. Not only was he waving his hands wildly, trying to balance himself, he kept crashing into trash cans, electric poles, advertising boards, and stalls along the way!

Mo Fan pursued the woman relentlessly, immediately putting the skills he had learned into practice. He was badly battered before he even reached the center of the city.

A Rock Monster that had just formed suddenly rushed out of an alley.

It was a Mud Morphing Monster that had just ambushed its prey successfully. He could see mud still flowing on the Rock Monster’s body and solidifying in reaction to the air. However, the impatient creature was already attacking pedestrians on the street.

“I have no time to waste on you!” Mo Fan ducked and slid past between the Rock Monster’s legs in style.

The Rock Monster was a little slow with its reaction. Mo Fan was already nowhere to be seen by the time it bent forward. He was already a hundred meters away by the time it turned and saw him.

“Turn, turn, turn, f**king turn!”

The street had a ninety-degree turn in front of a mountain wall. Mo Fan tried to manipulate the ground with his control of the Earth Magic so he could drift perfectly at the corner like Wen Xia did. Unfortunately, there were things that were impossible to learn just by observing someone doing it, nor was yelling going to make any difference. The dramatic move required great experience in using the Earth Wave.

Bang!

Mo Fan failed to step on the brakes in time, and slammed right into the wall. Golden stars were spinning above his head.

The Rock Monsters were still chasing after him. Mo Fan quickly wiped the blood gushing from his nose and quickly used another Earth Wave to leave the area.

Mm, mm, Mo Fan had learned how to travel in a straight line with the Earth Wave, but he was still struggling to turn the corners, let alone running along the walls and drifting around a ninety-degree turn like Wen Xia!

Wen Xia frowned after she arrived at the center of the city. There were a lot of buildings at the city’s center, most of them were built with stone. To the south was a busy marketplace, and to the north were some ordinary commercial streets.

A modern city would normally consist of steel, concrete, and reinforced glass, but the city center of Dingcheng only had concrete. There was not even any greenery nearby.

The buildings had blocked off most of the view as she looked ahead, but she could still see strange mud creatures wriggling in different locations. Several Rock Monsters were destroying everything about them recklessly. It felt like a bunch of bandits had found their way into a rich mansion. They were overturning trunks and boxes, searching for the Barrier Core.

It was dangerous for demon creatures to invade a city. Luckily, the city was more like a battle fortress that only allowed Mages to enter it. Otherwise, there would be a lot more innocent lives lost.

Mo Fan was panting heavily. A lot of strange things were hanging off of him. He already lost count of the things he bumped into along the way!

“Get rid of the Seal, and I’ll eliminate these creatures for you,” Mo Fan gasped.

“Getting rid of the Seal is no different from giving the Barrier Core to these creatures. No non-Earth Element energy is allowed, especially so close to the Barrier Core!” Wen Xia replied instantly.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Then what are you going to do? Do you think you can take them all out with your Earth Element? There are large numbers of Mud Morphing Monsters hunting their prey in the city now! The number of the Rock Monsters are only going to increase, and these creatures don’t just stop there, they can also...” Mo Fan suddenly paused in the middle of his sentence.

Wen Xia was confused. She asked, “What were you trying to say?”

Mo Fan did not answer her. He pointed ahead with a stern face.

Since it was dark, Wen Xia and Mo Fan subconsciously assumed the two black shadows before them were some tall commercial buildings when they looked down from a great height. To their surprise, the buildings suddenly started moving by raising their thick and strong legs. Their steps left huge cracks on the ground, and even knocked the houses nearby to the ground!

Wen Xia was dazed for a moment.

A Rock Monster over fifty meters tall?

The tallest Rock Monster they had encountered so far was only four meters, which was about the height of a single-story building. How did such enormous creatures show up in the well-protected city center? How did they make their way past the rampart? How could the soldiers and Brown Earth Mages possibly let them pass?

“You saw it, they can evolve continuously. Not only can the Mud Morphing Monsters transform into Rock Monsters after pouncing on humans, these Rock Monsters are attacking Mages to devour them, too. Every Mage they devour will increase their size and strength... damn it, how many Mages did those two Black-Silver Rock Demons even devour to reach their current size? The people inside them are probably enough to stack up into a human pyramid!” Mo Fan said.

These dangerous and destructive creatures were born in such a short time. Heaven knew what they would do if they were left alone!

“They are turning the energy of the Mages into their own. The Research Union has done some research on them, but we didn’t discover the Mud Morphing Monsters until it was too late,” Wen Xia admitted.

“I thought so too. The people we rescued were very weak, as if all their energy was drawn away,” Mo Fan said.

“Come with me, we can’t let those two monsters reach the Barrier Core,” Wen Xia seemed to know of a hidden passage, and Mo Fan off to a remote area.

“Hey, don’t you dare drag me into a mess! I’m just being kind-hearted trying to remind you of the threat so the military won’t be taken by surprise, so hurry up and get rid of the Seal. I promise you that I won’t use my other Elements before the Barrier Core is done setting up. Besides, if those things do find the Barrier Core, who knows if they can evolve any further with the energy of the Barrier Core. It won’t be just the Rock Monsters we have to worry about, but a Rock Demon Emperor. I still need my other Elements to flee for my life... ah, to protect the vulnerable residents of the city!” Mo Fan corrected himself.
