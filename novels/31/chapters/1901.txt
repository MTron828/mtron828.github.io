Chapter 1902: Teaming Up against the Ruler-level Creature

Translated by XephiZ

A layer of icy clouds were frozen above the bridge, right above a skyscraper with a few dozen floors. It was within the reach of the people who were taking shelter on top of the building. It felt like a world of ice was hanging upside down above the city, a spectacular yet terrifying sight!

Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou were extremely close to the sheet of ice. They flew under it and reached the strait.

The Ice Mages were still using their magic. The wild sea needed some tranquilizers to calm down, so freezing it was the best option. If they could control the waves, it would weaken the sea monster’s ability to manipulate the water!

“These things are so disgusting,” Zhang Xiaohou spat, pointing at the demon leeches on the water.

The demon leeches were falling down in huge clusters. The sea monster’s body was basically their nest. An army made up of thousands of demon leeches was moving freely atop the frozen water.

The demon leeches seemed to be heading toward the bridge too. The Super Mages were busy fending off the enormous sea monster. They had no time to worry about the army of demon leeches!

“Those demon leeches are like rubber. Normal destructive spells aren’t effective against them,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan had already fought the demon leeches. He knew their bodies were soft and elastic. Their multiple skin layers allowed them to extend their bodies to more than several times of their size without any effort.

As such, when ordinary spells landed on the demon leeches, they would just absorb the energy of the spells like a sponge!

The army of demon leeches was moving across the frozen water like black mud. Some Advanced Mages were already handling them, but they were not very efficient.

“You two, back away, you’re going to die if the energy ripple from that powerful creature’s attack hit you!” the Sound Mage who was giving orders shouted.

“Old man, we were summoned here by the order!” Zhang Xiaohou shouted back.

“We are gathering Super Mages, not young Mages like you!” the Sound Mage said impatiently.

“Ugh... we are Super Mages, although we just advanced recently. What do you need us to do?” Zhang Xiaohou replied patiently. He was not offended.

Mo Fan had been in the same position many times. People were used to judging the strength of Mages based on their age. A Mage in their twenties was just like a kid in the eyes of older Mages. They would be relieved if such younger Mages did not cause more trouble.

It was true that people like Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou were considered geniuses at their age. Not many Mages with white hair were even Super Mages, let alone them!

“You are Super Mages? What Elements?” The Sound Mage was astounded, and took a closer look at Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou.

“Mine is the Lightning Element, and his is the Wind Element,” Mo Fan said. He knew that only their Elements in the Super Level would be effective against the sea monster.

“Lightning, Wind, perfect! You with the Lightning Element, have you learned the Seal of the Nine Laws?” the Sound Mage asked seriously, his stern expression easing slightly.

“I’m a little slow at it,” Mo Fan confirmed.

“It’s fine, can you see that Space Mage? He’s preventing the sea monster from destroying the bridge and city...” the Sound Mage went on.

“I can,” Mo Fan nodded.

“That monster has a whipping clawed tentacle along its backbone, hidden under the layer of demon leeches on it. The Space Mage is hindering it from attacking the bridge, so it’s very likely that the creature will attack him with the tentacle. I need you to focus and find the root bone of its tentacle while we are fighting it and use your Seal of the Nine Laws to Seal it so it won’t be able to use the attack again!” the Sound Mage said.

Mo Fan glanced at the area with all the waterspouts. He noticed something like a cobra’s tail was whipping around whenever the creature moved around. It barely missed the three powerful Super Mages a few times!

“It’s one of the creature’s main attacks. If you can get rid of it, it will lift the pressure that the three advisors are under significantly. However, you must be extremely cautious too! We aren’t as strong as the three advisors, and you are certainly within the creature’s attack range when you are casting the Seal of the Nine Laws. You can’t let it notice what you’re up to. Otherwise, you might die right away if it attacks you with full force!” the Sound Mage said.

Young people were usually impetuous, as they wanted to make some contributions. The Sound Mage was well aware of the traits of younger Mages, but the sea monster was far stronger than anyone could imagine. A new Super Mage would die instantly to its attack, so the young man could not afford to be targeted by the creature. He had to be very careful!

“Don’t worry, I am well aware of the risk,” Mo Fan nodded. He was considering the old man’s advice seriously.

“Mm, I’ll leave it to you,” the Sound Mage turned to Zhang Xiaohou after he was done explaining the details to Mo Fan. “What level is your Wind Element’s speed?”

“This is my Soul-grade Wind Seed, the Feathers of the Wind Spirits.” Zhang Xiaohou knew how critical the situation was. He immediately showed the old Mage what he was capable of.

The Sound Mage was a little surprised. The Soul-grade Wind Seed was extremely rare. More importantly, it felt like it could be controlled very easily!

“We haven’t found the creature’s eyes yet. The other two advisors are trying to target its blind spots, yet they were spotted every time. The layer of demon leeches keeps nullifying their attacks,” the Sound Mage told him.

“Should I be looking for its other weaknesses?” Zhang Xiaohou asked.

“No no no, don’t even bother finding its weaknesses. This Vast Sea Monster is like an emperor in the sea. If we could find its weaknesses during our first encounter with it, it would long have been fed on by other creatures in the cruel world of the oceans. If it could make it to the top of the chain, it means the creature doesn’t really have any obvious weaknesses! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Your job is to find its blind spots. We humans have flexible limbs, yet we still have blind spots on our back, the back of our neck, and behind our legs, not to mention an enormous creature like that. It doesn’t have many limbs, nor is it relying on other senses. Its mainly relying on its vision, so there must be a limit to it. I want you to find its visual range and its blind spots so the advisors can inflict serious injuries on it before it can defend itself with the demon leeches!” the Sound Mage said.
