“It’s called the Dragon Sense,” Asha’ruiya returned to the main topic and continued, “It’s a permanent ability that the helmet grants to you. Even if you don’t put on the Black Dragon Helmet, you can still use the Dragon Sense, but it will consume a lot of your mental strength, so you should only use it briefly until your mental state improves further.”

“Dragon Sense!” Mo Fan repeated happily.

“It also has an Awakening ability. You can try it out in the future,” Asha’ruiya pointed out for him.

“Sure, I can already feel it’s something extraordinary,” Mo Fan agreed with anticipation.

Asha’ruiya pointed at Mo Fan’s hands. “The next is your Dragon Claw Gauntlets. They can directly improve your close combat power. I remember you enjoy fighting at close distances. With your Demon Flesh, even if your energy has depleted, you can still brawl with an enemy using the gauntlets.”

The long sleeves covered Mo Fan’s arms from his shoulders to his fingers, without affecting the movement of his arms. They also wrapped over the back of Mo Fan’s hands in the form of claws.

The sleeves were surprisingly flexible, and Mo Fan was still able to move his arms and hands freely. The gauntlets proper not only extended like claws, they could also take the shape of fists.

It seemed like Asha’ruiya had told the forgemaster to add the option of turning the claws into fists so Mo Fan could enjoy using them.

Claws were suitable for assassinating targets. Fists were useful for inflicting explosive impacts!

Mo Fan had once been quite jealous when he saw Guan Yu’s special gauntlet when he was on the national team. He now owned a rare piece of equippable magic Equipment similar to it!

An equippable magic Item was not one-off, like Deathstrike Magic Equipment was. It was a weapon that Mo Fan could wield constantly!

A common shortcoming of most magic Equipment was its duration. Most of them could only be used once in a while, but equippable magic Gear could easily cover a Mage’s weakness when fighting at close quarters, or while their spells were on cooldown.

Mo Fan could finally forget about his dream of taking out Guan Yu on a random night, as he now owned an equippable magic Gauntlet too!

“Thank you,” Mo Fan could feel the Black Dragon Magic Equipment was forged according to his fighting style. Asha’ruiya had clearly put a lot of effort into it.

“Marry me then.”

“No problem.”

“...” Asha’ruiya realized she should not joke around with a shameless man like Mo Fan...

“The Wings of Dawn and Dusk. The Black Dragon represents both the dawn and the dusk. It was neither light nor darkness, but it could represent both. That sounds just like you, who are neither righteous nor evil,” Asha’ruiya went on.

“Mmm, I like the sound of that. The Wings of Dawn and Dusk! May I ask if you are interested in experiencing the fresh air ninety thousand meters above Athens with me?” Mo Fan reached out his hand like a gentleman inviting a lady for a dance.

“Thank you.” Asha’ruiya was natural and unrestrained, just like many Western women.

She leaned forward while holding Mo Fan’s hand and wrapped her other arm around Mo Fan’s shoulder. Her posture slightly raised her chest and her hip, setting off her perfect curves.

Mo Fan soared into the sky through the invisible barrier around the Parthenon Temple. He soon saw the mystical buildings and mountains far below him.

The speed he took off with was shocking, pushing through the clouds in an instant. The whole of Athens was soon visible beneath him.

The streets, buildings, parks, and churches had turned into a painting on the ground. Mo Fan had a feeling he was looking down at a model of the city. The clouds drifting past him were adorning the spectacular land. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He flew all the way to a height of ninety thousand meters.

It was the height the Emperor of Feathers had reached during the Ceremony of the Winged Beasts, but the Ceremony had been held in a different region.

The air was chilly. As the clouds shrank under Mo Fan’s feet, the two began to feel cold.

Mo Fan was holding Asha’ruiya’s waist. He did not move his hand down or stick his face closer, as if he was actually having a dance. He must admit he was impressed by Western men’s ability to remain calm while maintaining this posture.

“Dragons have the best endurance in the world. You should be able to fly across the breadth of the Pacific Ocean with the Wings of Dawn and Dusk,” Asha’ruiya said.

The Black Dragon Set had many special attributes. Asha’ruiya had only explained the main functions to Mo Fan.

“I think I know how I’m getting back to my homeland,” Mo Fan nodded.

He finally had his own Wings Magical Equipment! The life of a non-swimmer and non-flier had come to an end. He no longer had to rely on Zhao Manyan’s fancy golden Wings Magical Equipment.

“It’s getting cold…” Asha’ruiya’s lips had lost their usual bright red. They were the normal color of a young woman’s lips.

“Let’s head back down,” Mo Fan said.

Asha’ruiya rolled her eyes. Was he really a straight man of steel!?

{TL Note: A Chinese slang used to describe men who can’t read the mood when it comes to women.}

“I don’t want to miss out on such a great chance. You can hug me closer,” Asha’ruiya said.

Asha’ruiya had never enjoyed the view of Athens from ninety thousand meters above the ground, either. It had to be a spectacular sight!

“Oh, I’m sorry,” Mo Fan said awkwardly.

“The Wings of Dawn and Dusk will grant you the Realm of Dawn and Dusk, which will reverse the restraints between Elements. Normally, Water and Ice restrain Fire, but in the Realm of Dawn and Dusk, it will be reversed. Your Fire can restrain Ice and Water. Your Darkness can restrain Light. Your Earth can restrain Plants,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan dropped his jaw wide.

Every effect of the Black Dragon Set was ridiculous. Every piece of it could be sold at an insane price on the market!

“I will let you find out the uses of the last piece yourself,” Asha’ruiya smiled.

The Black Dragon Boots were the final piece.

The Dragon Horns, Dragon Claws, Dragon Scales, and Dragon Bones had all been used to forge the Black Dragon Set.

Asha’ruiya had only held onto the Dragon Fangs, which were not as valuable in comparison.

Mo Fan still did not understand why Asha’ruiya was giving all this to him. If she was trying to thank him, she could have just split them evenly. If she had not woken up the Black Dragon Emperor’s soul, he would have been torn to pieces.

“An inch away makes you a gentleman, but an inch closer makes you a pervert.”

“Oh, I’m not really familiar with the boundaries.”

“You assh***, put me down!”

“We are here. It’s so pretty. Such a beautiful planet.”

Being sincere to a woman had always failed to win her heart. One had to use some tricks to win a woman’s affection.

They were literally in a place where calls and screams would not be heard, a place where they could cleanse their souls, but at the same time, it was difficult for a woman to put up any resistance if a man were to do some bad things to her…
