Chapter 2655: Doing the Dirty on Another Villain

The Magic Formation teleported Mo Fan and his crew sixty kilometers away. They were quite some distance away from Lanyang.

They left Lanyang behind in a terrible state. Ruler-level Sharkman Beasts were roaming close to the city. A Sharkman Chieftain was hovering above the city like a giant mountain. Their bodies were all as sturdy as high-density metal. Their flesh was tough enough to smash through mountains.

They were angrily looking for the humans who had stolen the Earth Flame Pistil. It was easy to predict what the members of the Northern Sacred Bears would go through when the Sharkmen finally surrounded the nursery home by Fenghe Mountain City!

“I wonder if the other survivors have managed to escape,” Mu Bai wondered aloud, looking worried.

There were some survivors left in a hotel in Lanyang. He did not know if they had escaped when the Sharkmen were surging over to Fenghe Mountain City. If they had not left at the right time, their chances of surviving in the city were extremely slim.

There was nothing Mo Fan and his crew could do to help the survivors now.

“We are now closer to Fanxue Mountain, we should head there first,” Lingling said after checking their location.

It was late at night. The group could see irregular mountains and thick trees around them.

Lingling did a quick check. If they were to go back to the Magic City, they would have to travel a great distance. However, if they headed south, they would reach the outskirts of Fanxue Mountain after traveling around four hundred kilometers.

The Earth Flame Pistil was extremely valuable. They had to hand it over to the government and the military. Their best move was to go to Feiniao City first and look for help.

“Sure, let’s go to Fanxue Mountain!” Mo Fan nodded.

They could not afford to overstay their welcome in this area. The Sharkmen were not to be underestimated. There were creatures on par with the Black Totem Snake among their ranks. The little Space Magic Formation was clearly not enough for them to truly shake off the Sharkmen.

A distance of sixty kilometers was not considered that far for the Sharkman Chieftain. The powerful existences among the Sharkmen would be following the trail left by the Space Magic Formation by now.

Huge bolts of lightning suddenly appeared in the dark sky as they were about to leave.

The lightning bolts soared into the clouds and scattered around Mo Fan and his crew, like the God of Thunder had just stuck a lightning flag into the mountain.

“A Super Lightning Spell!” Mo Fan gasped. He quickly looked around.

It was obviously not an ordinary Lightning Spell. It had been enlarged several times with a special method, making it stronger than normal Lightning Punishment Formations!

The question was, why would such a shocking Super Lightning spell appear out of nowhere? It felt like a troop of Lightning Mages had been waiting to ambush them for a long time!

“What’s happening?” Zhao Manyan yelled.

A burned smell lingered in the air. The lightning bolts were incredibly strong. The group tried to leave the Lightning Punishment Formation, but they ended up running into impenetrable walls of lightning.

“It’s a powerful Magic Formation. It’s an ambush!” Mo Fan warned them grimly.

Mo Fan was a Lightning Mage. He knew it was impossible for a Lightning Mage to have set up such a powerful Magic Formation without external help.

The Magic Formation was already stronger than the one Zhu Meng had used on the Black Totem Snake in the past!

A man with purple-red hair walked out of the shadows. “HAHAHA, Kunoy, Yangel, thank you for finding the treasure for me. I, Zhao Jing, have waited a long time for you… huh? Who are you guys?”

The man’s hair was as upright as a broom, and he had a skinny, pale face. His eyes were as sharp as an eagle, and flickering coldly as he sported a cold grin.

“You are not the Northern Sacred Bears?” The man was startled for a second, before he burst out laughing.

His laughter sounded strange, like the sound of someone coughing. It was sharp and annoying, with a strong hint of mockery.

“So you were the silkworms! Interesting, how interesting, I thought I was going after those Northern Sacred Bear kids, but if you managed to take them out, it means you should be more interesting than them!” the man exclaimed.

Mo Fan’s face darkened.

It turned out there was really an oriole waiting for them behind...

They thought they were already dirty by robbing the Northern Sacred Bears, but a dirtier guy had set up a Magic Formation and waited for them at the other end of the Teleportation Portal!

Mo Fan felt sorry for the Northern Sacred Bears. Even if they had managed to escape with the Teleportation Portal, they would still have died in the end.

It only showed how valuable the Earth Flame Pistil was. Everyone wanted to get their hands on it!

“A spy in the Northern Sacred Bears must have leaked their escape plan, allowing this guy to set up a trap at the other side of the Teleportation Portal...” Lingling deduced.

“It’s no surprise, considering how their organization lacks discipline and ethics. It was only a matter of time before it fell apart from personal interests,” Mu Bai agreed dryly. He was quite familiar with human nature.

“Now isn’t the time for discussion, this guy is a strong enemy. We have to be careful,” Zhao Manyan interrupted them, looking grim. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Old Zhao, you know him?” Mo Fan noticed something.

“He’s from the Zhao Clan. I have never met him before, but I have long heard about his infamous reputation. Many renowned organizations are afraid of him. My father mentioned him before. He said that if this Zhao Jing was willing to devote himself to the right path, he would have easily become a Forbidden Mage,” Zhao Manyan informed them all.

The Zhao Clan was mainly famous for its wealth. However, there were still some powerful Mages in the family that many organizations across the world were wary of. This Zhao Jing was one of them.

He had been traveling between countries after all four of his Elements had reached the peak of the Super Level. He would kill anyone that he found an eyesore. He had been challenging powerful Mages who had great reputations, but if he was not satisfied with the fight, he would torture his opponents instead!

The Zhao Family had spent a fortune just to settle the messes Zhao Jing had left behind.

“All four of his Elements have reached the peak of the Super Level?” Mo Fan repeated.

“Mm, I believe it has been several years.”

“No wonder he was planning to take on the Northern Sacred Bears by himself. He’s pretty confident!” Jiang Shaoxu nodded slowly.

“I’ll find a way to get rid of the Lightning Punishment Formation. You all should preserve your energy and don’t let the Super Lightning Spell wear you out,” Mo Fan reminded them.
