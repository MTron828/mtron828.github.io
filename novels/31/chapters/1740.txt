Mo Fan was not in a rush to return to Fanxue Mountain. He decided to go to the Magic City first.

Zhang Xiaohou was still keeping watch at the Qinling Mountains. If the Silver Skyruler ended up becoming the new Emperor of Feathers, he would be very busy for some time.

If the Silver Skyruler was not the new Emperor of Feathers, it would be a lot easier to manage the Qinling Mountains. After all, Xiaohou had been blessed and acknowledged by the Tree of Vows, so most winged beasts that had been around for a long time were respectful of someone like him. He could resolve the potential threats from the Qinling Mountains much more easily.

Zhao Manyan, on the other hand, kept complaining about wanting to go back to the Magic City. He owned a number of luxury suites there. Every property he had represented a ‘canary’ he was hiding, so every time he returned to the Magic City, he would live the life of an ancient emperor, where he had the freedom to flip the token to decide on the woman he was interested in spending the night with.

It had been a while since Mo Fan last visited his two gorgeous housemates, too. He walked past the entrance of the Pearl Institute and saw many young faces around. He subconsciously straightened his chest and lifted his chin.

He remembered how he was only a little Intermediate Mage when he first came here.

He had now reached the Super Level. He was stronger than most of the teachers at the Pearl Institute. He could not help but feel pleased with himself!

“Ah, isn’t that Mo Fan!?”

“Which Mo Fan?”

“The one that won the World College Tournament!” a girl with round glasses glanced at Mo Fan with glittering eyes.

Mo Fan followed the voice and made eye contact with the girl!

Damn, someone finally recognized him in real life! He seriously wondered what was wrong with the people of his homeland. It was like they could not even recognize a celebrity if they were not handsome enough or followed around by a few cameras. Mo Fan had long waited to be recognized in public. Couldn’t they just satisfy his vanity for once!?

Finally, someone had recognized him, not to mention that it was an adorable-looking girl. Even though her round eyes made her look a little nerdy, the little ribbon on the side of the frame of her glasses still made her look rather fashionable.

Mo Fan smiled like a celebrity normally did. He calmly waited for the girl to approach him. From a first glance, he roughly estimated her bust size to be C. To think that her cup size was C despite having such a petite figure. Her body ratio could easily make a certain body part bloat!

“It’s really Mo Fan, oh my, I did hear someone mentioning that he had returned to school last month. I didn’t expect to stumble into him here!” a boy who was obviously a new student of the school exclaimed.

“I only enrolled in the Pearl Institute because of Mo Fan. I even gave up on the recommendation of the Imperial College,” another new student said.

Mo Fan stood there and listened to the praise. He was wearing a calm smile, as if he was already used to the praise, yet his heart had already flown to the top of the Oriental Pearl Tower.

Lately, he had been either cultivating, traveling in foreign countries, or contributing to the peace of the world. He rarely strolled in public places like today, hence he was a little surprised to find so many admirers of his at the entrance of the Pearl Institute.

“Juniors, there’s no need to be so excited. I will often come back to school from now on, so please calm down,” a voice at the entrance of the school said.

Mo Fan had already reached the entrance. He was currently standing under a tree.

He was confused about why someone had stolen his lines. He was still smiling proudly in front of his admirers.

Mo Fan followed the voice and discovered that the new students were not even surrounding him. They were running toward another handsome man wearing a shirt with wisteria on it.

“Hey, I’m right here,” Mo Fan said when he saw the girl with round glasses running past him.

The girl turned around and glanced at Mo Fan briefly. He could read the question from the doubtful look in her eyes, Is there something wrong with this guy?

Mo Fan was dumbfounded, too. Most students were running to the entrance excitedly, while those that were calmer stood still and glanced at the man wearing a wisteria shirt from a distance.

“The demon king has now become a symbol of the Pearl Institute. What kind of luck did that Mo Fan have?” an old student blurted out jealously.

Those that called Mo Fan the demon king were most likely from the same batch as him. Mo Fan and his friends had graduated from the school in advance, but the rest were still working hard to graduate from the school.

Mo Fan did not recognize the student. He asked with a confused look, “Brother, do you know who I am?”

“Who are you? why would I know you... huh, you do look a little familiar...” the student observed Mo Fan carefully, but he soon scoffed, “Is there something wrong with you? Mo Fan might be impressive, but there’s no need for you to mimic him by having the same haircut, dressing up the same way, and even having the same skin tone as him. Why don’t you go get plastic surgery instead?”

“Friend, I’m the original. I’m not mimicking anyone, nor did I get plastic surgery. I’m Mo Fan, take a closer look!” Mo Fan pointed at his own face.

The student took a closer look again. His expression finally shifted after some time. “Are you really Mo Fan?”

“Mm, I’m the real one,” Mo Fan nodded.

The student had obviously seen Mo Fan during the welcoming ceremony or somewhere else before. He looked a little surprised. He kept glancing back and forth between Mo Fan and the guy at the entrance.

“To be honest, even though you are the low-spec version, you look more like the real one,” the student admitted.

Mo Fan’s face darkened. Low-spec version?

Damn it, that idiot who was gorgeously dressed and decorating himself like a male prostitute was obviously a fake! Did he really refer to him as the high-spec version? It was more like the coquettish version!

Mo Fan admitted that he was not too fussy about how he dressed, nor was he fond of making himself presentable, but that did not necessarily mean the guy that was wearing colorful clothes and appealing to the eyes was real!

Was someone seriously impersonating him!?

In addition to it, the impersonator had come to the Pearl Institute to trick the beautiful young ladies. How vicious!?

Mo Fan’s phone rang when he had the urge to beat someone up.

Mo Fan glanced at the screen and saw the call was from Mui Nujiao. He immediately picked up.

“Someone told me you were recognized at the entrance, and a bunch of juniors have you surrounded?” Mui Nujiao teased.

Mo Fan had not told Mui Nujiao he was back in the Magic City. He was planning a spot-check, Perhaps he might stumble into the two canaries in their underwear. However, Mui Nujiao was obviously referring to the guy at the entrance.

“Even I couldn’t believe that someone is f**king impersonating me!” Mo Fan grunted, glaring at the handsome man at the entrance of the school.

“Ah? I know many people are mimicking you, but impersonating... that’s quite absurd, especially when it’s happening right at the school’s entrance,” Mui Nujiao agreed.

“That idiot does look like me, but are these juniors blind or what? I’m obviously a lot more handsome than him! How did they even recognize the wrong guy!?” Mo Fan was initially in a great mood, but he was now filled with rage because of the impersonator.

“I’m still a distance away from the school. I’ll be there soon.”

“Mm.”
