Bobby felt like fainting from overwhelming fright. He subconsciously drove the boat away into the distance.

The waves that the Black Sea Drake was making were around eight meters tall. Each of them was enough to smash the little boat into pieces!

“Ningxue, over here!” Mo Fan yelled at Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue was still being chased around by the Black Sea Drake. The creature had two long whiskers on its head, conducting a black energy. It combined with the dragon’s breath into a black shockwave firing in Mu Ningxue’s direction.

Mu Ningxue summoned a strong gust of wind to help her land nimbly on the shallow reef. However, the black breath of lightning promptly landed on her with outstanding destructive force!

Mu Ningxue kept on summoning ice to form an oval, ice shield in front of her. The shield caved in to protect her.

The black lightning spread to the seawater. It seemed to trigger a reaction with the dense electric field in the water. The lightning arcs produced by the Lightning Explosion Cuttlefish started to move closer to the giant creature.

The Black Sea Drake appeared to be quite intelligent. When it realized that its lightning was attracting the electric field toward it, it quickly stopped attacking with its Lightning Element.

It was reluctant to bring death upon itself. The electric field was strong enough to cook its skin and its flesh. The school of Lightning Explosion Cuttlefish was something it could not afford to offend!

The Black Sea Drake had other abilities, even without relying on the Lightning Element. Its body had turned dark gold, and its scaly armor started to glow, granting it an unmatchable strength!

It raised its claw and swung it in Mu Ningxue’s direction. The dark blue light produced by the claw swept forward and sliced the water and the rocks in half.

Mu Ningxue knew the ice shield could not hold on for any longer. She decisively abandoned her ground and quickly distanced herself from the Black Sea Drake!

“My turn!” Mo Fan was totally engulfed in the scorching Calamity Fire and Rose Flame.

The two different flames combined into a powerful fist, which turned into a fiery dragon surging forward and tearing at the Black Sea Drake!

The Black Sea Drake did not try and dodge when it saw the fiery dragon approaching. It lifted its gaze arrogantly and uttered a roar. A water barrier similar to a Water Curtain appeared in front of it. The fiery dragon collided into the barrier and immediately evaporated. It failed to inflict any damage on the Black Sea Drake.

“Sky-Flame Funeral!” Mo Fan was fairly quick at channeling his spells. He raised two lumps of fire into the air, which soon turned into a fiery cloud looming over the Black Sea Drake!

Dense fireballs started pouring down from the burning cloud rapidly, turning the shallow reef into a scorching sea of flames.

The fireballs landed on the Black Sea Drake and set a huge chunk of its scales on fire. The Black Sea Drake realized the pinch it was in and tried to sneak back into the sea to escape from the flames. However, as soon as it turned around, it was shocked to see that the seawater was already dominated by the wild lightning. If it entered the water now, it would suffer serious injuries from the lightning!

The Black Sea Drake did not dare enter the water. It straightened itself and uttered a ferocious roar.

Streams of seawater started pouring down from the sky and splashed on Mo Fan’s sea of flames.

The sea of flames was extinguished fairly quickly. The Black Sea Drake seemed to dislike fire a great deal. It immediately directed its wrath at the human who had attacked him consecutively.

The Black Sea Drake leapt into the air. It was trying to smash Mo Fan into minced meat by crashing onto him like a giant mountain!

As the creature landed on the surface, a dark blue ripple of energy surged forward. Mo Fan did not notice how strong the ripple was. He managed to avoid being trampled by the creature, but he did not dodge the energy ripple in time. It instantly knocked him flying a few hundred meters into the distance. Luckily, Mu Ningxue managed to catch him with ice chains in time. Otherwise, Mo Fan was unsure how far from the creature he would have ended up!

“Such a savage creature!” Mo Fan rose to his feet and stared at the Black Sea Drake.

Little Flame Belle was excited when she saw the powerful beast.

Mo Fan knew Little Flame Belle had a strong desire to participate in challenging fights. He immediately communicated with Little Flame Belle through his soul, summoning fiery tongues of the Calamity Fire around him!

“Rocket Wings!” At Mo Fan’s order, the Calamity Fire turned into feathers and attached themselves to Mo Fan’s back, forming a pair of brilliant, burning wings!

The feathers exploded, thrusting Mo Fan forward like a ray of light slicing across the air. The flames bursting out from his body all accumulated on his wrist!

“Meteorite Fist!”

The Meteorite Fist was accompanied by several fierce dragons circling it, with scorching lava bursting out from them!

The fist slammed into the Black Sea Drake’s chest. The enormous creature slid over a hundred meters backward. Its pitch-black scales had an obvious burn mark that was slightly caved in.

Bobby gaped when he witnessed the scene.

He never thought Mo Fan’s strength was this shocking, considering how young he was. He managed to knock the enormous, mighty beast back with a single punch!

“Ten Thousand Ice Arrows!”

Mu Ningxue had also finished casting her spell while Mo Fan was keeping the Black Sea Drake busy.

Mu Ningxue could control her magic slightly better than Mo Fan with the help of her Domain. She pointed her hands ahead, firing around ten thousand ice arrows at the creature!

The ice arrows might seem small, but their numbers and strength were not to be underestimated! The Black Sea Drake was forced to protect its vital parts with its tail and arms. The ice arrows had the freezing ability, and even though the arrows failed to penetrate the drake’s defense, its scaly armor turned rigid after it was covered in frost!

“Gravity!”

Mo Fan immediately took hold of the opportunity. Instead of using a Fire spell, which would destroy Mu Ningxue’s ice, he decided to compress the space instead. The rhomboid encapsulating the Black Sea Drake multiplied the gravitational force within it ten times over, making it extremely difficult for the enormous Black Sea Drake to move freely!

The Black Sea Drake stomped the ground and waved its claws fiercely, trying to break the ice covering its body. However, the number of ice arrows was simply too shocking. The Black Sea Drake’s body was soon covered in a layer of frost.

“Ice Domain!” Mu Ningxue immediately gathered her Ice Magic.

The Ice Element was visible to the naked eye as it rapidly gathered around Mu Ningxue. The water above the sunken reef was soon turned into a thick layer of ice!

Snow started to fall from the sky. Mu Ningxue continued to channel her magic with outstanding focus. Several glaciers dozens of meters tall surrounded the Black Sea Drake and weighed it down with thick, heavy chains!

Not long afterwards, a whole hill of ice circled the Black Sea Drake, trapping it in the middle. The creature was extremely slow as it struggled to move. It was having difficulty gathering its strength. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Nyx Regime!” Mo Fan laid out his Shadow Domain upon seeing this!

A giant, black formation stacked on top of the icy mountain range. Giant Shadow Spikes lunged at the Black Sea Drake, sealing off every single joint on its body.

The number of Giant Shadow Spikes needed was proportional to the size of the target. Even though the Black Sea Drake was being suppressed by the icy mountains and the formation of Giant Shadow Spikes, the creature seemed to still be struggling still. It could still utter a roar and twist its body...

“How...how impressive!” Bobby just watched from the distance. He could not help but exclaim when he saw Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue teaming up to subdue the Black Sea Drake. The two young Mages actually stood a chance against the powerful creature!

The Black Sea Drake was greatly infuriated. Even the sky stared to shake following its blasting roar.

The destructive, dark blue energy ripple appeared once again. It was most likely the extraordinary dragon might that the Black Sea Drake possessed. As the energy ripple swept outward in a circle, it immediately shattered the icy mountains of Mu Ningxue’s Domain into pieces.

Mo Fan’s Shadow Formation did not survive the impact, either. The Giant Shadow Spikes rapidly dispersed after they were struck by the energy ripple. Even Mo Fan’s Nyx Regime was greatly affected, and was on the verge of dissipating from the impact.

The Black Sea Drake opened its huge mouth and spat at Mo Fan after breaking free from the chains!

An extremely thick pillar of water flew right in Mo Fan’s direction. Mo Fan was about to dodge it when he saw the Black Sea Drake swinging its head at him, too!

The water pillar was incredibly powerful. Mo Fan was struggling to stand still. The Calamity Fire engulfing him was put out as the impact sent him flying. He almost fell outside the boundary of the sunken reef.

The Black Sea Drake similarly spat at Mu Ningxue. The huge water pillar rammed forward. Even Mu Ningxue’s ice chains were no match for it. She was also knocked flying by the impact.

Before Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue could recover, the Black Sea Drake chased after them and raised its huge claw!

As soon as the creature lifted its claw, a huge wave rose and came pouring down together with the beast’s claw.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue gasped when they saw the raging waves and the claw descending upon them. The Black Sea Drake was most likely starting to go serious on them!

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue fled in different directions, but the claw of raging waves split in half and chased after them. It was impossible for them to outrun it...

The huge claw swept forward through the waves. Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were utterly helpless against it when the claw eventually landed on them. It was not as simple as breaking a few bones. They both fell to the ground feebly as they almost lost consciousness!
