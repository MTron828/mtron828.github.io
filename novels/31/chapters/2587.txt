“If you don’t want to say it, I will say it. Some people don’t deserve their reputation, and some people don’t deserve to be forgotten!” the Saintess of Darkness exclaimed coldly.

Mo Fan could feel the Saintess of Darkness’ murderous intent. It was strong, like a shark eying its prey. It would soon dash out of the waves and bite him in half.

Mo Fan knew the battle was not going to end with just a few sentences.

Some people might justify their actions proudly, but in the end everything they did was only for their own interest and benefits. Greed was like a seal that had been forever imprinted on the Saintess of Darkness’ soul. Otherwise, why would she have ended up in the Dark Plane, even if she lost the election?

Mo Fan had grown stronger after receiving the third Spring of Darkness. He could establish a thick wall with his Will with a single stare. It blocked the Saintess of Darkness’ icy tsunami.

The Saintess of Darkness began to transform. She still had the power of Evil Faith. The disdain, hatred, and grudges that others held against her were a source of power!

She took off the sacred robe and revealed her skin, which was now covered in tattoos. A pair of horns emerged from her forehead and extended above her head.

A dark red tail burst out of her dress. A strange darkness spread like pollen as the tail waved back and forth, making her look like a filthy lizard spreading its poison across the area.

The horns and tail had turned the woman into a monster with very thick dark skin. The Saintess of Darkness’ transformation was similar to the Cold Prince, but her horns and tails were obviously bigger and stronger.

Her horns were surprisingly massive. They almost reached the dark clouds hanging above her.

Red sparks were flickering in the clouds. The Saintess of Darkness suddenly swung her head and smashed her horns at Mo Fan, dealing a destructive blow to the ground.

The sparkles of red light had scattered across the ground like thorns and chains in order to limit Mo Fan’s movements and prevent him from dodging the horns!

Even though Mo Fan had received the Spring of Darkness thrice, he was still under enormous pressure against the Saintess of Darkness’ evil power. She was almost as strong as a Supreme Ruler like the Sea Skeleton King.

Mo Fan glanced at the black string on his head, noting that it was slowly fading away.

The Saintess of Darkness had not only told everyone a huge secret, she had also brought Mo Fan a lot of time.

The Saintess of Darkness was the attacker, meaning that Mo Fan’s strength was reduced by thirty percent. That was crucial to the outcome of the battle.

But, the restriction to his strength would be reduced over time! The string that was fading away was clear proof. After a certain amount of time, Mo Fan would be able to fight with his full strength!

It was unnecessary for Mo Fan to fight the Saintess of Darkness head-on for now, especially after seeing how strong she was. He decided to drag the battle out until the restriction was gone.

—

Mo Fan snapped his fingers several times. Each snap produced a ripple that spread out like a silver net, catching the red sparks and relocating them.

Mo Fan’s movements were no longer limited after getting rid of the red sparks. He began moving from one spot to the other like a ray of light.

The tile was bigger than it looked. Mo Fan quickly left the Saintess of Darkness’ sight after Casting only a few Blinks.

The massive horns left huge gashes on the ground, but Mo Fan was no longer there.

The Spring of Darkness had also improved Mo Fan’s Space Magic. He could even set up a few Space Star Constellations and quickly step into the next Space Tunnel after leaving the previous one.

He felt like he had become an experienced Mage who had mastered Space Magic, now able to move across the tile freely. His opponent had no way of telling where he was going to appear next!

“Space Compass: Axis of Death!”

Mo Fan was not just running all the time. He was also looking for a chance to attack.

He connected the portals he used to travel around the tile rapidly into a compass. Its red axis slashed at the Saintess of Darkness’ neck fiercely.

The Saintess of Darkness had remained in one place throughout the process. The Axis of Death sliced through her neck in the blink of an eye.

It was the Super Spell of the Space Element, the Axis of Death!

Mo Fan had never had the time to practice it after his Space Element had reached the Super Level. However, the boost from the Spring of Darkness had allowed him to Cast the difficult spell with ease.

The Axis of Death was even stronger than the Holy Essence spells of the Light Element. However, the damage of a Space Spell was based on the Mage’s mental strength.

Mo Fan’s mental state was quite strong right now. The Axis of Death successfully penetrated the Saintess of Darkness’ neck.

Yet, there was no blood pouring out of the Saintess of Darkness’ throat!

The Saintess of Darkness was still able to turn her head, and simply glared at Mo Fan.

She was not dead. Her neck was not her weakness.

Mo Fan had never thought that a single Super Space Spell would be enough to defeat the monster. He continued to keep a safe distance from his enemy and probe her.

He was also waiting for the black string to vanish completely!

“Mo Fan, the Evil Faith is continuously supplying her with energy, like the red strings you encountered before. You must sever the connection between her and her believers,” Mu Bai informed him.

“Are the red strings similar to the Red Demon’s power?” Mo Fan asked quickly.

“Sort of, but they are different. Look closely and find the red strings around her. They should be floating about her like spirits,” Mu Bai told him.

Mo Fan had no idea where Mu Bai had learned all of that, but he followed Mu Bai’s instructions and studied the Saintess of Darkness closely.

Mo Fan soon discovered strange flickers dancing around the Saintess of Darkness every time she used her power. They were supplying her with energy, just as Mu Bai had mentioned.

The red strings had to be connected to something. What would it be?

Mo Fan looked up as he followed the strings. He soon discovered a huge group of spirits hovering above the Saintess of Darkness like a dark cloud. Their faces were filled with anger and hatred!

The Saintess of Darkness looked like a woman who was selling balloons at a festival. She was tugging at strings which were attached to a huge bundle of balloons.

However, the strings extending up to the heads and faces on one end were actually attached to her back!
