“Damn it, I’m supposed to take that guy on! what do you think you’re doing?” Gamennon of the Greek team yelled, and hurried over to the area where Ai Jiangtu was.

Gamennon was an absolute madman. He totally disregarded the pact between the two allied teams. He broke into Ai Jiangtu’s space and knocked him flying, just so he could take on Zorro on himself.

Ai Jiangtu was infuriated. The man was obviously stirring up trouble with him. He activated the trap of the Cursed Evil Spider to affect both Zorro and Gamennon!

Since the Greek team had broken the pact first, there was no need for Ai Jiangtu to keep calm!

The crimson-red silk of the evil spider densely scattered across the place when the curse was triggered, covering an area of two hundred meters. When the silk touched the trees not far away, the trees wilted away rapidly.

The Curse was just as effective against Zorro and Gamennon. The two did not dare stay in the area any longer. They quickly fled in two different directions.

Zorro was slightly quicker because of his Wind Element. As soon as he left the spider silk, Gamennon quickly chased after him like a mad hound. He cast a Light Spell and fired a bunch of light arrows at Zorro.

These light arrows were very good at tracing their targets down. While Zorro was nimbly dodging the arrows, he realized that he had been tagged by a Seal on his back that allowed the light arrows to pursue him relentlessly!

“You two, I guess I’ve been going too easy on you!” Zorro was extremely annoyed. After getting rid of the light arrows, he started spinning in place.

The white winds spun at an incredible pace and turned into long whips, lashing at Ai Jiangtu and Gamennon. The wind whips struck the ground and the trees, leaving scars across the place.

“Since you’re so eager to show off your strength, I’ll let you handle the winds instead!” Gamennon glanced at Ai Jiangtu and suddenly unleashed the restraining power of the Shadow Element.

Gamennon swiftly left the area being lashed by the winds, but restricted Ai Jiangtu’s movement to prevent him from leaving the area!

“You won’t be going anywhere either!” Ai Jiangtu was clearly not going to fall for it. His eyes glittered as he used his will to drag Gamennon out of the shadow, and applied the Gravitational Space to Gamennon. The smug man immediately noticed that he was struggling to move his feet!

The alliance between the Chinese team and the Greek team was not firm to begin with. After Gamennon took the initiative to break the pact, the battle between the three teams was suddenly a lot messier.

Seeing the situation was getting out of control, Mo Fan immediately backed away to preserve his strength and energy.

Mo Fan had expended too much of his energy when the Chinese team was picked on by the two teams. Knowing that he only had half of his energy left, he was unwilling to go all out before he could assert control over the situation.

“That idiot, why couldn’t he wait until we eliminated the English team?” Asha’ruiya was displeased when she saw Gamennon breaking the truce between the two teams.

She seriously did not understand why the Greek team chose such a brainless man to be their captain. It explained why they had lost to the cunning Egyptians!

“Mo Fan, we’ll pretend to be fighting one another close to a member of the English team, and find a chance to take him out,” Asha’ruiya knew that the three teams were soon going to end up fighting one another. Everyone had been waiting to vent their frustrations, no one would care if they were still one another’s ally.

“Good idea!” Mo Fan agreed with Asha’ruiya’s suggestion. “Let’s take that guy with fair skin out. He has been staring at me for a long time. I bet he wants to take me out to make a name for himself!”

“Sure!”

Mo Fan teamed up with Asha’ruiya again to set up the man who had just entered the match.

It was true that the man was planning to take Mo Fan out to earn himself some fame. Even an obstinate man could tell the two were putting up an act from the expressions and the looks in their eyes. Mo Fan had pretended to provoke the man when Asha’ruiya suddenly came and attacked him...

“You little b**ch, didn’t you promise you won’t hurt our team? Look at what Gamennon is doing. That’s nothing like what you’ve promised me in bed last night!” Mo Fan yelled when he saw Asha’ruiya playing along with the act.

The English mage with a pale face was startled. He looked at Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya in disbelief.

These two had actually made a deal with their flesh. Such a disgrace, so infuriating... why didn’t Asha’ruiya choose me instead!?

“Shut up, or I will cut your tongue off!” Asha’ruiya snapped furiously. Pieces of black armor appeared and covered her body. Even her glamorous face was covered by a silver mask, while her hair was tied up in a ponytail, reaching her waist like a waterfall.

Black energy erupted from Asha’ruiya’s body. Mo Fan suddenly felt like the woman had turned into a completely different person, like she was possessed by some black energy!

A long sword engraved with patterns appeared in her hand. The black aura silhouetted a black unicorn approaching from the distance, at a speed comparable to a flash of lightning.

“What the hell, you can transform too?” Mo Fan was stunned.

Asha’ruiya was fully covered in black armor while holding a dark sword. If it wasn’t for her alluring body, Mo Fan would have thought a female Dark Swordmaster had appeared out of nowhere!

“It seems like you are completely clueless about what Dark Magic can do!” Asha’ruiya’s voice appeared from the silver mask.

The black unicorn was approaching rapidly. Mo Fan suddenly felt the light in the surroundings was being accumulated on the tip of the sword that Asha’ruiya was holding. The tip was emitting a deadly beam! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The sword stabbed forward, followed by multiple afterimages. After Asha’ruiya put on the black armor, it was like she had transformed from a Mage to a female Dark Swordmaster. Her speed, strength, and power were comparable to the Dark Swordmaster that Mo Fan had fought against!

Mo Fan was very quick at dodging the stab, yet the sword glow still pierced his shoulder. The blood only started pouring out of the cut after a few seconds, just when the pain came. It felt burning first, before it felt like his shoulder had just exploded!

“Are you for real?” Mo Fan grinned. The injury was barely anything serious.

“I thought we were putting up a realistic act,” Asha’ruiya smiled.

“I bet you’re the most cunning and dangerous person here,” Mo Fan replied seriously.

“I can’t help it if that’s what you think of me,” Asha’ruiya responded lightly.

“Actually, I was quite bothered by one thing. It really hurts my ego,” Mo Fan said.

“Tell me about it,” Asha’ruiya lifted her sword as she straightened her upper body. Her slender body was extremely alluring when wrapped tightly by the black armor. Her skinny ankles formed a great contrast with her muscular thighs!

“You said I was no match for you on Mount Tyrant, so I’m pretty interested to see how strong you are!” Mo Fan stomped the ground, engulfing himself in both the Calamity Fire and Rose Flame. The fierce flames attached to Mo Fan like a blazing red robe, and the scorching heat clashed with Asha’ruiya’s dark energy.

The bright flames and the pitch-black darkness formed a clear boundary. A strong aura of destruction rose as the two types of energy clashed!

Their appearanced were unlike any ordinary Mages. Mo Fan was engulfed in flames after he was Possessed by Little Flame Belle. The exploding flames had transformed him into a fiery figure. Meanwhile, Asha’ruiya had obtained the power of the Dark Swordmaster through the Dark Contract, turning herself into a Dark Swordmistress. The English mage suddenly found himself in an awkward situation, as he did not have any way to transform himself!

The English mage, Muwen by name, decided to attack both Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya simultaneously. The only way for him to make a name was to boldly challenge the strongest destructive mage, Mo Fan, and the Candidate for the role of the Goddess.

A petrifying power burst out of Muwen’s eyes. The trees, soil, and river were turned into a hard rocky substance quickly. The energy rapidly approached Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya.

“Go away!”

“Piss off!”

Both Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya fought back as Muwen attacked.

Mo Fan Summoned the Flame Sword and slashed forward. The flames surged at the English mage like a fierce tide.

Asha’ruiya’s black sword moved at lightning speed and swept past Muwen in the blink of an eye.

The fiery tide and the sword shadow both landed on Muwen. The man stood no chance against their attacks. He was instantly covered in wounds and bruises as he fell to the scorched ground, shrouded by two different auras.

The difference in strength was way too ridiculous. Muwen was clearly not on the same level as either of them. He would have struggled fighting either of them, let alone facing both of them!

—

The assistant judge had recognized Muwen. He grumbled as he dragged the severely injured away, “Why would you even bother intervening in their fight?”

Muwen felt an urge to cry too. He knew those two were strong, but he did not expect their strength to be this ridiculous. He was bullied like a dog, when he was already an elite on the English team. He began to doubt the meaning of his life.

How was their ability in close combat so remarkable when they were Mages, just like everyone else!?

—

Asha’ruiya was incredibly fast. Even though her strength was not as overwhelming as the Dark Swordmaster that was able to destroy an entire troop of Battlemages with a single slash, Mo Fan was having a hard time defending against the woman’s rapid slashes. To make it worse, she was also an expert of the Space Element.

When the woman utilized the Sword Shadow Strikes of the Dark Swordmaster and the Space Element’s Blink at the same time, Mo Fan felt like she was everywhere around him, making it impossible for him to trace her down!

“Try to run from this! Volcano Fist!” Mo Fan slammed his fist on the ground.

The ground cracked open as scorching lava poured out fiercely. It started with nine burning pillars, but more pillars began to show up and connect in the pattern of the Nine Palaces. It eventually turned into a huge, roaring volcanic crater!
