For the next few days, everyone was totally released from their burdens. Venice was a charming city, meaning that the team could enjoy themselves for a few days after the tournament came to an end.

Since the team mainly consisted of young adults, they had no limit on when they were allowed to do whatever they pleased. Even Mo Fan was drunk for almost a full day. Unfortunately, alcohol had no effect on Mu Ningxue. Otherwise, he could easily have taken hold of the opportunity to finish the job with her!

Mo Fan’s approach toward Mu Ningxue had always been that he would not mind forcing something if he had to, even if it meant crossing the line. Otherwise, he simply had no idea how long he would have to wait before the harvest. He had already expressed all his feelings to her!

“F**k, I almost vomited myself to death, what exactly did Jiang Yu, that asshole recommend to us? It tasted like cow’s piss, not to mention its strong aftertaste. I almost had s** with a stripper in her forties. It’s going to haunt me for the rest of my life!” Zhao Manyan cursed, finally sober again.

Mo Fan was amused when he saw Manyan struggling to stand properly on the balcony outside his room.

It was true that someone around the age of forty had helped him back to his room, but the person was not even a woman...

It was almost evening when they woke up. The brilliant sunset shone upon Venice, reflecting colorfully on the well-decorated windows and the surface of the water in the canals. The beautiful and mature women of Venice walking on the streets were also part of the soothing scenery!

That being said, nothing could be compared to the sense of achievement after winning the final match. The more Mo Fan recalled the details of the tournament, the more impressed he was with himself.

How brilliant was the decision of his father to sell the old house just to send him to Tian Lan Magic High? He was a f**king magic genius!

“Come, let’s go have a walk, to sober up!” Zhao Manyan proposed.

“Sure, let’s head to the beach,” Mo Fan agreed.

They had no idea where the rest of the team had gone. Perhaps they were hanging out together, or picking up chicks on the street. Since they were the champions of the tournament, they only needed to stand still on the street for a minute before someone recognized them, and would jump straight into their arms.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan did not need to be secretive. They were not movie stars or singers. Even though the World College Tournament had grabbed the attention of the whole world, it was unlikely that people would be able to recognize them on the street, since the spectators could only watch from a distance away. Besides, when they were dressed casually, they looked no different than the other people on the street, apart from being slightly more handsome, of course...

They went to the seaside of Venice. As a matter of fact, Venice was a spacious bay, its shape like an irregular half-moon. Most interestingly, it also had a long beach, like the string of a bow.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan had nothing much to do, and so they decided to walk along the bay. It was not an attraction in Venice, and the two had no idea what it was called, either. They only knew the scenery was quite nice.

There were quite some people along the bay, as many luxurious hotels were located here, glittering under the sunlight.

“Strange, since when is there an artificial island here?”

“Why is that strange? The island of the final match is also an artificial island. Maybe we just haven’t been here in a while.”

“That’s true, it’s been some time since I came here. Haaaa... the older you get, the easier you miss out on the latest news. I swear I’ve never heard of a new artificial island in Venice.”

Two old men were taking a stroll along the bay. They would occasionally look toward the city.

Between the bay and the city was a huge body of seawater. The island of the final match was located there.

“I bet you aren’t just thinking of a normal walk, bringing me to such a remote place?” Mo Fan broke the silence as he felt that Zhao Manyan had something to tell him.

“How did you know? Are you a parasite in my stomach?” Zhao Manyan was shocked.

“Just spit it out,” Mo Fan replied impatiently.

Zhao Manyan was slightly hesitant, still deciding if he should tell Mo Fan about it.

“It’s about my father. He’s quite old, and has lots of health issues because of his living habits when he was young. I have lived up to his name now that we’ve come in first, but he happened to fall sick. I bet he didn’t even see the match...” Zhao Manyan sighed.

“That’s a pity. Aren’t you going to visit him?” Mo Fan asked.

Every son would want their father to feel proud of them, and prove that they could still achieve greatness in society without their father’s protection.

Mo Fan could understand Zhao Manyan’s feelings. It was true that the people of Zhao Manyan’s clan and his father had always assumed that Zhao Manyan was frivolous. They never expected him to have any kind of achievements.

“I’m just worried,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Worried?”

“He’s been very sick. The old Healer of our clan already told us that if he falls sick again, he might pass away. Even though we’ve been preparing ourselves for it... whenever the thought of my father not having much time left hits, I’m overwhelmed by sorrow,” Zhao Manyan admitted in a soft voice, unlike his usual demeanor.

“That serious?” Mo Fan was startled.

He had no idea that Zhao Manyan’s father was approaching the end of his life, since Zhao Manyan never mentioned it to him.

“That’s why I want to make him proud, so he can pass away in peace. I’m just afraid, afraid that once I tell him the news, he will just pass away in relief. If he doesn’t see me, he could live longer. It’s the reason why I’m scared to visit him,” Zhao Manyan said. He had been carrying the burden for some time, and had not told anyone before.

“Is there really no chance of healing or extending his time?” Mo Fan asked.

Zhao Manyan shook his head. His father had been sick for more than ten years. He was only alive because he was being treated by a powerful Healer.

“Only the Spell of Resurrection can save him. Otherwise, it’s pretty much terminal cancer,” Zhao Manyan said.

When he saw that Zhao Manyan was indeed mentally prepared for it, Mo Fan exclaimed, “I have always wondered why a fuerdai like you would bother joining the national team and cultivate so diligently, instead of wasting your time on women. Well, in my opinion, you should just pay him a visit. You should just go to him and tell him your heroic achievements rather than using such an extreme method just to keep him alive. He can leave in peace, and you can at least bid farewell to him!”

“You’re right, it’s just that I’m worried about my brother...” Zhao Manyan sighed.
