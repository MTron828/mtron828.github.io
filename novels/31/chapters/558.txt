The Giant Corpse General’s blood and liquid were splattering across the place. Its wild attacks had finally weakened.

The rain still fell heavily. Suddenly, a huge lump of mud sprouted into the air. Mo Fan was just about to cast a Lightning Spell to inflict serious damage on the Giant Corpse General. To his surprise, several zombies covered in mud suddenly appeared nearby. The zombies were heading for Mo Fan with their filthy mouths at surprising speed!

Mo Fan turned around and saw the zombies breaking through the defense set up by A Li and A Xing. The wave of them was rolling forward like a black current.

Mo Fan had no choice but to interrupt his Intermediate Spell. His figure was surrounded by a Lightning Strike, creating an electric field around him!

The electric field covered the area within thirty meters of Mo Fan’s feet. The zombies that were lunging at him were paralyzed instantly...

Lightning Strike was ineffective against the Warrior-level Giant Corpse General, yet it was more than enough to handle these Servant-class undead!

A huge number of Undead were immobilized by Mo Fan’s electric field. The lightning serpents dashed across the ground and struck the zombies. Those that were close to Mo Fan were quickly scorched by lightning!

“There’s too many of them, we can’t hold on any longer!” yelled A Li.

His voice had come from a huge group of zombies. It seemed he was completely surrounded by the Undead.

“Same here,” Liu Ru’s voice said from the distance at the same time.

There were simply too many zombies after every undead within a kilometer was summoned here. The longer the fight went on, the more zombies would show up. On top of that, the Giant Corpse General never stopped uttering cries, summoning the zombies nearby as cannon fodder!

The team was completely surrounded by the undead. Despite the upper hand that the Dark Knight had granted them, the team soon found themselves in a pinch.

“Didn’t I ask you to run away before? Great, none of us can leave now!” complained Shorty.

The Giant Corpse General did not charge at them recklessly. It had suffered quite serious injuries. It continued to cry endlessly and watched from afar, waiting for the zombies to wear out the team!

The zombies uttered cries and shoved one another around to get closer to their target. Some even crawled onto the bodies of others.

Mo Fan was able to keep the situation under control with the electric field. Meng’e was standing close to Mo Fan, relying on his electric field to provide her with some relief. However, she wore a huge frown still, as the situation was fairly grim for the team.

She glanced at the sky and saw a thin ray of light barely making it through the rain!

“It will be daytime soon!” she reminded everyone.

Mo Fan glanced at the Giant Corpse General in the distance, and saw the creature wearing a vicious grin as it uttered an unsatisfied cry. The frenzied undead suddenly halted in place.

Faint sunlight shone down upon the place. The presence of death quickly dissipated.

Without the presence of death, the undead were like stranded fish, and began to jump around in a panic!

They uttered terrified cries and covered their heads, extremely vulnerable to sunlight, and proceeded to dig into the ground...

The Undead entrapping A Li and A Xing quickly ran away. As a matter of fact, it had been daytime for quite a while, yet the thick clouds and rain had delayed it.

Regardless of how weak the sunlight was, it was still light. Most importantly, once the presence of death which they breathed in dissipated, they would soon die to the sunlight if they did not return to the underground or back to their tombs!

The zombies flowed away like a falling tide, similar to how they came. The undead had given Mo Fan and his crew a horrifying experience. If the darkness had only lasted just a little longer, they would simply have died to the surrounding zombies!

“Thank Heaven...” swore Shorty, who was too lazy to wipe the sweat off his face.

Meng’e’s two subordinates, A Li and A Xing, no longer looked relaxed as before. They regrouped with Meng’e, not knowing what to do with the injuries they had. They simply lowered their heads and apologized for failing to protect their master.

Meng’e did not comment on it. She glanced at her rain-soaked clothes and her disheveled hair.

“Let’s find a place to hide from the rain first. It’s too cold. It’s easy to get sick like this,” said Liu Ru.

“It’s still some distance to Hua Village,” said the muscular man.

“Head for the Qinling Mountains, there should be a cave somewhere, we can stay there for now...” suggested Shorty.

“The demon beasts of Qinling Mountains aren’t easy to deal with...”

“Don’t worry, I know a place without them,” said Shorty.

——

The team followed Shorty towards the Qinling Mountains. The place was like a natural barrier, standing upright and firm. It was quite difficult to find a cave based on the structure of the mountain walls. After all, the walls were fairly steep. Not everyone could walk on the steep walls.

However, Shorty managed to lead everyone to a cave. It was located halfway along the walls, and could only be reached by climbing up some vines...

“There used to be a Blood Beast here. Our team killed the beast around a year ago, so there shouldn’t be any demon beasts living inside it,” Shorty spread apart the weeds covering the entrance of the cave. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A Xing snapped his fingers and summoned a puff of flame at the tip of his finger.

The flame lit up the cave. Even though there was a foul smell inside the cave, the air was fairly dry. It was a lot better than staying in the rain outside.

“You two, guard the entrance,” Meng’e said to her subordinates calmly.

The two nodded and guarded the path, not allowing anyone to go any deeper into the cave. Only Liu Ru, who was also a woman, was allowed to go past.

The eyes of Shorty and Mo Fan, the two perverts, flickered. They stood on their toes, trying to peek into the cave over the two subordinates...

Unfortunately, it was completely dark inside. It turned out that Meng’e had summoned a dark curtain, preventing Mo Fan, who also possessed the Shadow Element, from peeking inside.

The cave was quiet, with two men guarding the path and three other men waiting at the entrance. They could hear rustling from the cave as clothes slid across the women’s soft, tender skin. The men simply stared at one another, feeling their throats and mouths turning dry...
