On top of the library...

Mo Fan was already channeling his fourth Lightning Spell, constructing another magnificent Star Palace. Its strong presence gathered the Lightning Magic for a dozen kilometers around to him. The whole strait could see its brilliance.

A student with the Water Element hurried over and blurted out in a panic, “Miss...Miss Biling, sea monsters are approaching from the beach garden. There’s a whole lot of them!”

“The beach garden? Isn’t that just below us? What kind of sea monsters?” Miss Biling asked urgently.

“The Scarlet Soaring Demons! They were hiding in the water previously, so we didn’t notice them until now!” the student answered.

Biling frowned. She purposely glanced at Mo Fan, who was channeling the Super Spell.

Mo Fan did not lose focus even after he heard every word from the student. He believed anyone with a brain would understand why he had not assigned roles to the rest of the students!

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were not a brainless species. They were obviously going to attack the university when they realized they were being flanked and attacked!

The continuous blasts from Mo Fan’s Lightning Spells and the students with Elemental Magic were similar to a super magic cannon firing at the sea monsters. The army of sea monsters was obviously going to suffer great casualties if they did not take out the magic cannon as soon as possible!

Therefore, there was only one reason why they had sent a troop of sea monsters to the university: to kill everything that posed a threat to their plans of invading the city!

Biling saw Mo Fan had no intention of responding, but she now understood why he had asked them to be on standby.

“The rest of you whose Primary Element isn’t Elemental Magic, come with me to the outside! We can’t let the sea monsters reach the library!” Miss Biling took over the responsibility of defending the library. Her Sea Gong Fighter was already in position on the hill.

The Sea Gong Fighter roared when it saw a few Scarlet Soaring Demons approaching the hill. It intercepted them quickly and smashed them into pieces before the rest of the students arrived.

“There are more of them down there!” the student representative said. He was looking excited again, as if he finally had a chance to show his capabilities.

“Stay on the hill. Don’t go any further. Our job is to defend the library!” Miss Biling ordered.

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were having trouble climbing the hill with Biling’s Sea Gong Fighter in the way. Many Scarlet Soaring Demons were immediately reduced to gore splashing across the place when they tried to sneak past the Sea Gong Fighter!

Mo Fan looked down the hill and was relieved when he saw the students sticking close to the Sea Gong Fighter while fighting the Scarlet Soaring Demons.

Mo Fan was not necessarily afraid of the Scarlet Soaring Demons, but he would not be able to cast his Super Spells so easily if the Scarlet Soaring Demons got too close to him. He was still not adept enough with the Super Spells!

The fourth Lightning Spell was completed. It went through the Space Bridge and killed a lot more of the sea monsters instantly. Happily, the Soul Remnants of the Scarlet Soaring Demons still ended up flowing into the Little Loach Pendant, even though they died over a kilometer away!

The blast came down after the number of sea monsters in the area peaked. The spell ended up killing even more Scarlet Soaring Demons than before!

“Qiu Zi is starting to get impatient. It has ordered the sea monsters to charge recklessly. If they waited a little longer and invaded the city through Wuyuan Bay and other places that were relatively lower, my spells wouldn’t be able to kill so many of them!” Mo Fan grinned as he stared at the Scarlet Soaring Demons.

Qiu Zi was oddly furious. It kept screeching loudly, giving orders to the sea monsters and demanding they attack the bridge and the city. The sea monsters had no choice but to push forward recklessly despite their fear.

Normally, a Super Spell with a large area of coverage would only kill about a hundred Warrior-level creatures at most. It was rare for a Super Spell to kill almost five hundred creatures at once like Mo Fan was pulling off!

The sea monsters were packed too tightly. Normally, they would maintain a distance of a few dozen meters from one another, but in order to break through the defenses and invade Gaoqi Airport, the gaps between the Scarlet Soaring Demons were less than three meters. Some Scarlet Soaring Demons were even climbing on top of their comrades’ bodies!

The creatures were densely packed together, without any reliable defenses. Mo Fan’s Super Lightning spell with twelvefold damage amplification could easily ignore their numbers and kill every sea monster caught inside it!

The Lightning Tyrant was able to kill the Scarlet Soaring Demons instantly. The army of Scarlet Soaring Demons that was initially clogging the entry point to the Gaoqi Airport was thinned out by half.

This outcome was significant, since Mo Fan was only the first cannon tower at the front line. As a matter of fact, the numbers and strength of the students here were not comparable to a platoon of five hundred Battlemages, but Mo Fan’s damage output had already surpassed that of a troop of five hundred Lightning Mages!

Lightning Magic was the deadliest among the Elemental Magicks, but not many divisions had enough people to form a force of five hundred Lightning Mages. The Scarlet Soaring Demons were supposed to be the sea monsters’ main forces, but Mo Fan had eliminated too many of them before they even reached the shore. It was absolutely insane!

“Keep going, I need some rest!” Mo Fan’s head was spinning after he completed the fourth Star Palace.

He had only become a Super Mage recently. His energy was still lacking, so he was definitely going to struggle after casting a Super Spell several times within such a short period.

“Commander, you’ve killed too many Scarlet Soaring Demons. Some of their leaders are coming after us! We don’t have enough firepower at the beach garden to fend them off!” the teacher with the Wind Element spoke up.

“I’m aware of it,” Mo Fan nodded. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were finally treating him seriously. They had sent almost eight hundred Scarlet Soaring Demons to attack Jimei University. They were all Warrior-level creatures, and fairly close now. He could no longer take out a few hundred of them with a single blast like before.

“We might have to retreat. We won’t be able to hold on for any longer,” the Wind Mage continued.

“That won’t be necessary!” Mo Fan shook his head and began searching for the director of the Water School. He noticed the man was not too far away from him. He said, “Ask the director of the Water School to come here.”

His Lightning Element was currently out of gas, but it was not the only Element Mo Fan had. He might not stand a chance against powerful creatures like Qiu Zi and Qiu Chi, but he was definitely experienced at massacring little demons!
