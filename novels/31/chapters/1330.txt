“Sister Xinxia, can you wake my sister up? Just a brief moment is enough,” Lingling said.

“I can, but her life force will deplete faster when she’s conscious,” Xinxia said.

“There’s no other choice,” Lingling said.

“Lingling, what are you planning to do?” Mo Fan had no clue how Lingling was going to lure the assassin out of hiding, but he believed Lingling had recovered her wisdom.

“There’s a traitor in the Enforcement Union, so much of the information relayed to the Enforcement Union will be intercepted. If sister is being targeted because she has learned something about the Cold Prince, their aim isn’t really about killing her, but to prevent her from bringing the information back to the Enforcement Union,” Lingling said.

Mo Fan’s eyes glittered. He agreed with Lingling’s analysis.

-Yeah, weren’t they trying to kill Leng Qing because she learned something crucial about the Cold Prince?-

In other words, the assassin was after anyone that had the information and was trying to bring it back to the Enforcement Union.

“Even though sister can’t tell us the information since she’s unconscious, we just need her to tell the Lingyin Enforcement Union personally that she has entrusted us to bring the information back to the Lingyin Enforcement Union. That way, the assassin will come looking for us. At the same time, we should use the traitor, too,” Lingling said.

Xinxia realized what Lingling was up to. She murmured a chant to allow Leng Qing to momentarily regain consciousness. She used the Psychic Element to tell Leng Qing what she had to do.

Leng Qing woke up. Even breathing was extremely strenuous for her. She tried her best to transmit a secret message with a code that only the Elder of the Linyin Enforcement Union had access to...

When Leng Qing finished transmitting the message, Mo Fan noticed the flower on his palm had lost two of its petals. Leng Qing’s life force had depleted by so much in such a short time!...

“Senior Sister Leng Qing, don’t you worry, we will save you. The important information you’ve risked your life for won’t be lost! If the Black Vatican dares to set foot in our country, we’ll uproot it without mercy!” Mo Fan’s hatred of the Black Vatican was off the charts.

They had tried so hard just to drive Salan away. How could they allow the Cold Prince to establish his influence? Too many people had died in the Calamity of the Ancient Capital. They could not afford to let the same tragedy happen again!

Leng Qing looked at Mo Fan. Her eyes closed heavily. A black tear slid down from the corner of her eye.

The Enforcement Union had never taken the lead in the battle against the Black Vatican. Too many people were afraid of the Black Vatican. They were scared of being targeted by its vengeance and intimidated by their brutality. It was all more the reason for them not to cower!

Leng Qing had witnessed too many of her comrades die in the battle against the Black Vatican. She had also seen many that had fallen victim to the Black Vatican’s conspiracies. Every time she saw the family of the victims grieving over the deaths of their loved ones, she always told herself that it would be the last time...

And yet, the number of victims kept on increasing. More people were hurt. The seniors of the Enforcement Union told her that if she kept pursuing the Black Vatican, she would end up in the same fate. A person could not do much against the formidable Black Vatican, but a person might be everything for a family!

Was that really the case?

Just because the effort of a single person was negligible, they should let more innocent families suffer, to be stranded, and to live in darkness and despair?

Leng Qing could not bear to be a bystander. Every death and sorrowful family she saw would make her feel even more guilty, and when the guilt accumulated to a certain level, she even believed it was worth sacrificing her life for the information on a Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican!

The only worry she had was that Lingling was still so young. She had decided to infiltrate the Black Vatican deeply to assuage the guilt that had long stacked up inside her. She did not bring disgrace to her role as a member of the Enforcement Union, she did not let the families that were destroyed by the Black Vatican down, but she had forced Lingling to bear all the pain.

The little girl was surely going to hate her, just like how she hated the dumb decision that their father had made.

Leng Qing closed her eyes. In her brief moment of consciousness, lots of things had crossed her mind. It was like the reflection of her life prior to her death, everything from her birth to now, everything she remembered, everything she forgot had surfaced in her mind!

A blue swimming pool was surrounded by colorful spotlights, giving the pool a magical appearance.

Inside the mansion beyond the swimming pool, a man was hanging from a balcony, his body swaying in the wind. His neck was wrapped by a thick rope. His face had turned blue and his eyes had rolled up.

“How dare he bring an Elder of the Enforcement Union to us? Humph, he almost ruined my plan. Useless prick, leave him there for a few days!” A teenaged young man with purple eyes glared at the swaying corpse with a hint of disgust.

“Master Cold Prince, a message for you,” a glamorous woman in a flowery dark purple cheongsam showed up with a smile.

“Got it.” The teenage boy went to another room. Around five minutes later, he returned with a dark expression. He picked up a paring knife from the table and threw it at the target swaying on the balcony. The knife stuck into the corpse that had no longer shed blood. There were lots of those stab wounds on the corpse.

“Bei Jiang, that unreliable prick, didn’t he tell me he had already killed the woman? If she’s already dead, how was she able to relay a message back to the Linyin Enforcement Union!?” the Cold Prince raged in a tantrum.

“We can still fix it. Let Bei Jiang deal with it. He’s still one of the best we have.”

“Humph, let’s hope he doesn’t let me down again. I don’t have a high tolerance for trash!”

—

The glamorous woman put the paring knife back on the table. She approached the pool and took off her clothes, revealing her tender skin before she went into the cold water.

After swimming a lap, she flung her hair back and spoke towards a dark corner, “Don’t tell me you’re going to stay there and watch for the whole night? You heard the Cold Prince, don’t you have some matters to attend to?”

“I’m just confused. Why didn’t Leng Qing die? No one has managed to survive the Dark Wither!” A tall figure slowly materialized from the shadow.

“The man carrying the information that Leng Qing mentioned is called Mo Fan. He was the one that managed to get the better of Salan a few times. If you can kill him, the Cold Prince will be impressed...” the woman said.

“I’ve fought against him, there wasn’t anything special about him.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
