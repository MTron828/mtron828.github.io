Chapter 2664: Soldiers at the Mountain’s Foot

“Isn’t this a little overkill against a third-rate renowned clan?” asked the leader of the Southern Mercenary Alliance, a fellow by name of Du Tongfei.

Du Tongfei was an old friend of Zhao Jing. The two of them had colluded together and committed a lot of evil crimes together back in the day.

Zhao Jing might be a madman, but he had his considerations, too!

Either way, Fanxue Mountain was now an official renowned clan. Going after it without a valid reason would only attract unwanted attention from the Enforcement Union and the people.

Since they were trying to take over the Mountain, there would surely be casualties. They had to do it quickly in order to have the only say in the matter!

The plan was to take out Fanxue Mountain swiftly and use their connections in the government to control the media. It did not matter who was supporting Fanxue Mountain behind the scenes. The whole thing would be done and Zhao Jing would have gotten what he wanted.

The whole operation mainly relied on the speed of execution!

They could not afford to give the Enforcement Union and Fanxue Mountain’s allies any time to react. They had to destroy the Mountain or at least secure the Earth Flame Pistil and run away. Zhao Jing would just stay discrete and use money to settle the loose ends. No one would remember what he had done after a few years.

Zhao Jing wondered where Fanxue Mountain had found the courage to compete with him. Did they think they could take on the renowned clans just because they had made a little name for themselves in recent years? Fanxue Mountain was just a stray dog compared to the real powerful organizations. How would it stand a chance against the tigers and the dragons?

The big names could destroy it as easily they pleased!

“We shouldn’t waste any more time. Fanxue Mountain has accumulated some power and resources in Feiniao Headquarters City over the recent years. We must act quickly,” Lin Kang stated.

“Fellow leaders, can I go and negotiate with Fanxue Mountain? I believe they are at a loss too. They might have regretted their action for crossing the wrong people and taking something they shouldn’t. Perhaps we can settle it peacefully if I talk to them,” Li Dong of the Dali Clan suggested cautiously.

He was surrounded by some powerful people, each with an unmatched reputation in the south. Li Dong did not understand what Fanxue Mountain was thinking, poking such a huge beehive.

“Why would we bother negotiating with them? Do you think a tiger would bother negotiating with a little pup?” Nanrong Xu replied, amused by Li Dong’s suggestion.

“Little pup? You are overestimating Fanxue Mountain. They are just some petty earthworms rolling around in the mud who think they have everything,” Nanrong Ni scoffed.

“Go, I would like to know what their attitude is. I already said I’m going to give them some time to think how they are going to beg me for mercy,” Zhao Jing grinned. He was relieved after having gathered so many reliable helpers.

It was still the same, after all. He could take out a renowned clan with a few words if he wanted!

Unfortunately, he had long grown tired of being able to do anything he wanted in China. It was more exciting to fight the stronger organizations in other countries now.

That being said, Zhao Jing was very excited right now. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After all, he had been out of the country for some years. Some young Mages thought they were unstoppable and dared to offend anyone who crossed them. It was time to teach these young Mages who the real king was!

Li Dong headed off to Fanxue Villa as a mediator after obtaining permission from his superiors.

Lin Kang was a little displeased by that. He said with a dark expression, “Zhao Jing, I’m not asking a lot in return, but you did promise me you were letting me take over Fanxue Mountain. I’m under a lot of pressure, as many leaders of Feiniao Headquarters City have already warned me harshly, but I insist on taking full responsibility for it.”

“Oh Lin Kang, do you think I’m the kind that is satisfied with just taking back what is mine?” Zhao Jing asked with a smile.

“What do you mean? Didn’t you send that kid from the Dali Clan to negotiate with them?” Lin Kang asked.

“Negotiating is one thing. Securing the Earth Flame Pistil is important so they won’t destroy it out of spite. If they are scared, they will hand it over. We can then make our move without any worries. Don’t worry, I already said Fanxue Mountain is going down, and I will keep my word!” Zhao Jing laughed.

“HAHAHA! I see, there’s no problem then! We can also let them know what they have signed up for. They are just a new faction, after all. They have yet to learn their place. If it was a few years ago, they could continue to grow under the protection of the Magic Association and the government, but the times have changed. They can only be our lackeys if they aren’t strong enough!” Lin Kang burst out laughing.

“You are absolutely right! There is only one rule for clans to survive: either fawn upon us, or be eliminated!” Zhao Jing knew the situation of the clans now, as he was one of the leaders of the Zhao Clan.

“I don’t really care, I just want Fanxue Mountain to be gone,” Nanrong Ni smiled.

“Oh right, it’s almost Sister Nanrong Ni’s birthday, isn’t it?” Zhao Jing squinted at her.

“I didn’t think Brother Zhao Jing would remember my birthday. It’s nothing important,” Nanrong Ni lowered her head with a hint of surprise in her voice.

“It is important for me. I know the conflict between you and Mu Ningxue, so her misery will be my gift to you,” Zhao Jing declared with a confident smile.

“Actually, it’s just a little misunderstanding between us, but that narrow-minded woman keeps holding a grudge against me and even threatened to cripple my cultivation. I didn’t have a choice, since I was just trying to protect myself,” Nanrong Ni grumbled and sighed.

“How vicious is that Mu Ningxue?” Zhao Jing wondered aloud.

Nanrong Ni lowered her head to look helpless and looked down.

Zhao Jing grinned when he saw Nanrong Ni’s expression. He did not say anything else to her.

Fanxue Villa…

Li Dong strode through a garden with bamboo trees and arrived at the main hall.

Li Dong saw Mo Fan as soon as he reached the hall. He was sitting in the hall with Mu Ningxue in a Mage robe on one side and another woman with a unique temperament on the other side.

“Seriously? How are you able to sit here so calmly!?” Li Dong felt like crying when he thought about Fanxue Mountain’s situation.

“Opportunist, why are you here?” Mo Fan was surprised to see Li Dong.

Li Dong’s expression darkened.

Did Mo Fan really have to call me that!?
