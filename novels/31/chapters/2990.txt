2991 A New Heart

Lingling pulled the tip of the Sacred Tooth Staff out from the back. The tip passed by Mo Fan’s heart leaving a scary hole in his torso.

The red lava slowly flowed into the hole in his chest. The Frost of Alternate Space that remained in his heart slowly subsided as the hot lava melted it. The lava was like the blood in Mo Fan’s body. It was expanding the shriveled heart and reviving it!

Badump!

A clear heartbeat reverberated. At the same time, a sharp fluctuation occurred in the lava pool and river that covered the entire hole!

Badump! Badump!

The heartbeat resounded twice in a row. The red world suddenly went crazy. There was a raging eruption of lava and flames. Numerous fire pillars shot up into the sky.

Badump! Badump! Badump!

The heart began to beat rapidly. The area to the west of Osaka instantly erupted with spectacular and violent flames like volcanoes. It was quite startling!

In the flames of the volcano, a body drifted up. He was bathed in the inexhaustible lava fire. He regained his vitality and was eventually reborn, just like the son of the sun!

Shalitha slumped against the swaying rock in fright.

He thought he had killed Mo Fan and won the battle. However, he hadn’t expected that an inconspicuous girl would be the reason for his defeat!

When Mo Fan came into contact with fire, he was reborn!

The Wicked God was immortal and had the most powerful flame in the world. If he was not killed in time, no one knew what catastrophe he would bring to this world.

Shalitha could not move his eyes away from Mo Fan at all.

Mo Fan’s heart kept beating as though it had never been frozen by the Frost of Alternate Space. After his rebirth, his heart seemed to have gotten even stronger. It was like a scorching sun that kept burning.

The aura of the Red Sun hit Shalitha’s festering face. He could sense that this Wicked God with a new heart was even stronger than before. The flame might be even superior to the Flame Saint of the Holy City!

The Wicked God had been growing all this time. Shalitha was terrified not just because he was powerless to fight this Wicked God but also because he had created an invincible demon!

If he did not kill Mo Fan today, he knew Mo Fan would become terrifying as time passed!

“Y-You have no idea what you’ve done!” Shalitha’s voice trembled. He no longer sounded arrogant.

“If the Holy City is full of ruthless scum like you, it shouldn’t exist in this world at all!” said Lingling.

Flames were everywhere, but the ground was not hot at all. Mo Fan, who had a new heart, landed beside Lingling. His body had no raging flames and shocking demon patterns anymore.

Mo Fan looked neat and clean, just like an ordinary man. The flames all over the sky had already shown his extraordinary power despite the lack of demon aura on his body. If he issued an order, the flames in the sky would descend. The flames of the Wicked God would burn Osaka, the vast mountains nearby, and even the ocean at a distance!

This was the real power of a god that could crush thousands of lives in a single move.

If Mo Fan were a real Wicked God, with resentment toward the world and endless contempt in his heart, he could burn everything to the ground.

Mo Fan only wanted to kill one person. Archangel Shalitha, who represented the Holy City, was his target.

Mo Fan walked toward Shalitha.

Shalitha’s eyes betrayed the fear he felt. He also felt annoyed and regretful.

‘Why did I create such a dangerous creature?’ he thought.

“You probably can’t honor the Holy City in the way that you want, but you can die in the Holy City, if you want.” Mo Fan smiled brightly.

“You won against me, but you can never win against the Holy City. So, I still win even if you kill me now. You have become the enemy of the Holy City. So, now you are a criminal everywhere around the world. You can run away, hide, and fight, but what about the people around you? They will also be rejected by this world. You still lose, no matter what. You still lose!” Even though Shalitha was afraid of death, he provoked Mo Fan.

“You’re right.” Mo Fan nodded.

“If I’m alive, I’ll be your only enemy. If I’m dead, your enemy is the Holy City, the Five Continents Magic Association, the Forbidden Curse Association, and countless countries and powerful people loyal to the Holy City,” Shalitha continued.

“Does it mean I’ll have a way out if I don’t kill you?” Mo Fan smiled.

“Yes. We can let go of the past and stop fighting. In fact, there are many secret agreements like this in the Holy City,” said Shalitha.

Shalitha has already lost, so he could only bargain with Mo Fan with his identity as an Archangel. He knew what Mo Fan needed and what was important to him. He could use it to his advantage.

“I agree to your second condition,” said Shalitha. He knew Mo Fan was questioning what choice he should make. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Next time, you should agree to my condition before destroying half the city. Unfortunately, I don’t want there to be a next time.” Mo Fan reached Shalitha.

Mo Fan extended his hands and held Shalitha’s ugly head. With a smile, Mo Fan slowly applied force and lifted Shalitha’s head while he stepped on Shalitha’s body to hold him down.

Shalitha’s neck stretched, and he felt the pain of suffocation as his head was pulled up. He struggled.

“You’re such an exquisite and perfect Archangel. How can you have such an ugly head? I’ll help you remove it slowly. This is also a great time to reflect on what you have done wrong and why you made the situation worse. Try not to make such a mistake in your next life, or your head will be pulled off like this again,” said Mo Fan as he continued to pull his head off.

He sounded like a gentle elder giving sound advice. But the bones of Shalitha’s neck cracked. His agony was apparent in his struggle.
