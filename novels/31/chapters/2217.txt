“I believe most students in the Aorus Sacred Institute have already learned how to accumulate Elemental Magic. You learned there are different Elements in the air when you first learned about Domains. A Domain allows you to quickly accumulate the energy of its respective Element so you can Cast spells quicker, and it will also strengthen your spells. What happens if you gather the energy around the enemy instead?” Nelson proposed.

Gathering energy around the enemy?

Wasn’t that a pretty stupid move? They were supposed to use the energy to Cast their own spells, so they should accumulate the energy around themselves instead!

“You can form a Seal by gathering some of the particles around the enemy. When you are Casting your spells, even if you can’t see your enemy, you can easily sense the distribution of energy particles. Your target will glow like a luminescent light amid the darkness, which will greatly improve your spells’ accuracy!” Nelson said. He seemed very proud of his invention.

By attaching the particles onto his enemies, he could tell his enemies’ whereabouts instantly, even if they tried to hide or move around at high speed. He would know where they were even with his eyes closed!

The words were followed by a round of applause. Most people had never tried the technique before.

Nelson then explained how to gather the magic particles and attached them to the enemy to form a Seal. Simpkins followed the steps on the dueling ground. He subconsciously straightened his chest as he left the dueling ground, like he was already better than others!

“As expected of Lecturer Nelson, he has taught everyone such a great technique for free, right at the start of the class!”

“Many lecturers prefer to hide their secret techniques, but Lecturer Nelson is willing to teach everyone the technique selflessly. He’s indeed a great role model for us!”

Every student learned something new in each of Nelson’s classes. No wonder his classes were always packed!

“Not bad, he does have some tricks up in his sleeves!” Mo Fan nodded when the class was done.

“Not bad my ass; you’re here to kick his ass, not to compliment him!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

“We can’t just deny someone’s talents just because we aren’t pleased with him,” Mo Fan retorted.

“Since when are you such a saint?” Zhao Manyan mocked him instantly.

“We should be more open-minded. That way, we’ll feel a lot better whenever we beat up some assh****!”

“Enough with your nonsense, go beat him up. What useless technique was that? Only students who have mastered a Domain can use it. How many people in the world had a Domain when they were only students? The technique is only useful for these rich students of the Aorus Sacred Institute. It’s useless for students from other schools!” Zhao Manyan repudiated instantly.

Mo Fan nodded. Zhao Manyan was right. Nelson’s technique might be useful, but it was only applicable to a certain group of people.

A Soul-grade Seed was only common at the Advanced Level. Those with a Domain were already experts among the Advanced Mages. It would be perfect if the technique was applicable for Basic Mages, Intermediate Mages, and Advanced Mages without a Soul-grade Seed. It could be included in the magic textbooks across the world!

“Alright, does anyone have any questions?” Nelson asked.

“I do!” Mo Fan said.

He was seated with the rest of the Lecturers, so it was unlikely Nelson would ignore him.

Nelson had always treated Mo Fan with disdain. He did not mind Mo Fan trying to mess with him in his class. “Lecturer Mo Yifan, go ahead,” he replied calmly.

“Well, one of my students was badly injured in your class. He couldn’t recover from the injuries because of the unique magic effects of the guy who did it. He’s currently in bad shape. I was wondering, shouldn’t you interfere with the duel when the students are overdoing it?” Mo Fan cut straight to the topic.

He did not bother running in circles. Others would prefer to settle their personal conflict privately, but Mo Fan enjoyed doing it right in front of the crowd!

“Lecturer Mo Yifan, we shouldn’t discuss this in a public class. We’ll talk about it after the class is done,” another lecturer who was teaching the class frowned.

Many leaders of the school holding great authority had attended the class. This one did not want Mo Fan to ruin the atmosphere.

The other leaders of the school did not speak. They watched silently, as if they were looking forward to something exciting.

Why would they interfere with the conflict between two guest lecturers? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ritchie was one of the talented students I had my eyes on, but he ended up joining your team for some reason. I was quite disappointed when he did not seize a better opportunity. It’s normal for students to be injured in a duel. The more he suffered, the greater the motivation for him to become stronger would be. I was hoping to motivate him. I meant no harm,” Nelson replied calmly.

“But his injuries were so serious that he couldn’t even take care of himself now. He might even miss out on the tournament and the golden period for him to achieve a great height in the next few years. I’m not too sure if you are motivating him or you were trying to turn him into a cripple,” Mo Fan shot back.

“Lecturer Mo Yifan, you are over-exaggerating it. Like I said, I was just trying to motivate him. It’s the only way I can motivate him to work harder since I’m no longer his teacher. I’ve worked in the Sacred Hall of Liberty for twenty years as an instructor. I have faith in my teaching skills,” Nelson said proudly.

Mo Fan was about to say something when Herr Casa rose to his feet and interrupted Mo Fan.

“Lecturer Mo Yifan, I’m the one who injured Ritchie. It was my fault for not controlling my power appropriately. The students always described Ritchie as a genius, so I thought he could withstand my attacks at full strength. If Lecturer Mo Yifan isn’t pleased with it, I will bear full responsibility for it. You shouldn’t blame Lecturer Nelson for it,” Herr Casa said in a gentle yet aloof tone.

Mo Fan glanced at Herr Casa and harrumphed coldly, “Who gave you the permission to interrupt us when we two lecturers are talking? Shut your mouth!”

Herr Casa’s face darkened. He almost lost his temper when he was scolded in front of over a thousand students and the leaders of the school.

This lecturer was out of his mind!
