Both sides had their swords drawn and bows stretched!

Leng Qing waited for the other side to make his move with an icy, proud stance, taking consideration of the fact the man was a guest visiting their country.

Meanwhile, Digaeus did not show any mercy. He waved his arms forward strongly, forcing the wind to gather from all directions!

The airflow was actually visible since it was surprising golden-brown, one that Mo Fan had never seen before. The golden-brown wind rose and immediately formed a giant wind wall surrounding Mo Fan and Leng Qing

The wind wall contracted swiftly, greatly reducing the available space for the two.

“This guy, he cast the Spell fast!” murmured Mo Fan.

The Intermediate Spell was almost completed within an instant. It was obvious that the man’s cultivation was rather impressive. He was most likely able to finish a Star Pattern with a single thought!

The ability to draw a Star Pattern with a single thought allowed him to cast an Intermediate Spell in an instant, absolutely terrifying!

“You should go down first!”

Leng Qing remained aloof as always. She loosened her grip, dropping Mo Fan.

Luckily, they were not too high up. Otherwise, he would simply fall flat on his back since there was no shadow nearby for Mo Fan to flee into due to the blazing sun right above his head.

As soon as Mo Fan landed, he lifted his gaze and discovered that the brown wind wall had already shrunk to one meter away from Leng Qing. The strong tornado could easily tear a five-meter-tall Warrior-level creature into pieces, let alone a woman like Leng Qing with soft skin and tender flesh!

“Humph!” Leng Qing harrumphed disdainfully. The energy of some unknown Element burst out of her body and shattered the wind surrounding her.

The brown wind dissolved into several streams of air flowing in all directions. Leng Qing’s eyes emitted a dark brown flicker, as if an ancient rock demon that was hiding inside her pupils had suddenly woken up!

“Eyes of the Rock Demon: Sky Muslin!”

The sky was suddenly covered in a layer of dark brown curtain of sand, surrounding Leng Qing gently, like a piece of fabric.

“Go!” The Sky Muslin formed of tiny sand particles followed Leng Qing’s gaze. The sand rapidly gathered into sharp stalagmites around two meters long before shooting at the teacher of the Parthenon Temple!

The stalagmites sprang forward with loud howls. However, Digaeus burst into hollow laughter when he saw the attacks.

“Eyes of the Rock Demon, I can cast the same spell too. Why don’t we find out whose Earth Element is stronger!” Digaeus smiled.

His eyes flickered and gradually turned red-brown, as if something was covering his pupils.

It was obvious that Leng Qing and Digaeus both possessed different kinds of Earth Seeds. Even though they were casting the same spell, the hues and effects of the Earth Seeds were different.

Digaeus’s Eyes of the Rock Demon seemed spookier. Red-brown sand swiftly gathered around him into the same Sky Muslin.

However, Digaeus did not attack. The stalagmites under Leng Qing’s control were already approaching him, and he was forced to defend himself.

The Sky Muslin was able to change its shape freely. With a flicker from the Eyes of the Rock Demon, the sand swiftly gathered in front of Digaeus into an armor plate and defended him from the attack.

The damage of the stalagmites was greatly reduced as they landed on the armor plate. Leng Qing did not waste the rest of Sky Muslin. She immediately disintegrated the stalagmites by turning them into a long whip, thrashing Digaeus with great power!

Digaeus was unable to defend himself. He hadn’t thought Leng Qing’s mastery of the Eyes of the Rock Demon was this outstanding. She managed to disintegrate the Sky Muslin and reshape in almost no time!

The thick whip lashed forward amid the sand that was drifting in the wind. The attack broke down Digaeus’s defense and knocked him to the ground.

Digaeus rose to his feet and glared at Leng Qing in humiliation. “It looks like I’ll have to be more serious!” he swore..

“I haven’t even warmed up yet,” replied Leng Qing indifferently. Digaeus almost failed his channeling upon hearing her response.

—

While Leng Qing and Digaeus were busy fighting one another, Mo Fan made use of the chance to approach the plane.

“People inside the plane, come out at once, or else I’ll blast it open. How dare you kidnap a woman in broad daylight? This is not your home!” snapped Mo Fan, pointing at the plane.

The flames of the Fiery Fist set his fists aflame. It was Mo Fan’s last warning.

The cabin door slowly opened. A middle-aged man with golden hair walked out of it and stared at Mo Fan coldly with golden eyes.

“You dare challenge the Parthenon Temple’s authority?” stated Glorkian coldly.

“Are you a SB?” cursed Mo Fan.

{TL Note: SB = shabi}

Glorkian was not fluent in Chinese, thus he did not really understand what it meant. However, he could easily tell that the guy was humiliating him!

“You just cursed the teaching staff of Parthenon Temple College. We have the right to punish you accordingly!” said Glorkian.

“Go f**k yourself!”

Mo Fan felt like it was impossible to communicate with the retard in front of him. He simply threw a punch at the plane’s wings.

The raging flames of the fourth-tier Fiery Fist lunged at the wings of the plane in the form of nine fiery dragons and blasted them into pieces!

Glorkian raised his brows. No one had ever dared to treat him so disrespectfully in Parthenon Temple. When he saw the wings of the plane falling to the ground in pieces and the glass of red wine that he just poured a moment ago smashing to the floor, he immediately jumped down from the plane!

“Don’t hurt him, or else...” warned Xinxia with a frown when she sensed Glorkian’s overwhelming aura.

“I’m only going to teach him a lesson. Such a disrespectful kid; no one is allowed to disrespect the people of Parthenon Temple!” Glorkian walked toward Mo Fan without turning his head.

Glorkian was already less than ten meters away from Mo Fan. He indifferently raised his hand. It was hard to tell what spell he was casting.

Mo Fan looked at the man cautiously. When he was about to attack preemptively, the field under his feet suddenly cracked open. A thick vine burst out from the ground and grew four meters long within the blink of an eye, before whipping in Mo Fan’s direction with overwhelming force!

Mo Fan failed to react in time. He was knocked over ten meters away.

“There are always twenty misbehaving brats like you on the first day of school that I must teach a lesson to. You’ve destroyed my plane, and interfered with our sacred duty...” Glorkian continued to walk forward. He raised his hand once again, which was emitting a faint, green energy.

Mo Fan looked at the ground, assuming that the strange vine was going to appear again.

“Behind you, idiot!” said Glorkian disdainfully.

A thick vine burst out from the ground less than half a meter behind Mo Fan, and swiped in his direction with great force!
