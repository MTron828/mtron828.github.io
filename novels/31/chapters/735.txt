The mountain range on the other side of the island rumbled all of a sudden.

The group immediately turned their heads toward the sound and saw the mountains collapsing. The rocks fell onto the thawing thickets.

“Err... Mo Fan, did we forget something?” asked Zhao Manyan with a stiff expression when he saw the collapsing mountains. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Mo Fan smacked his leg hard!

“Damn, I forgot to seek revenge from that Sea Monkey!” Mo Fan rose to his feet.

Nanyu had just eliminated the last Scarlet Soaring Demon, and felt her lips twitching.

-Revenge my ass!-

Wasn’t he supposed to bring the team over to fight the Commander-level Scarlet Rending Demon together after getting rid of the Scarlet Soaring Demons? Yet he still had time to eat something here!

“Hehe, I’m joking...let’s hurry over to give Ai Jiangtu some backup,” Mo Fan laughed under his breath. He quickly led the team to the other side of the island.

——

The ice on the other side of the island had broken into pieces. Fierce waves splashed across the place as the sea roared furiously.

Ai Jiangtu nimbly landed on a piece of floating ice on the water. He immediately saw the Scarlet Rending Demon flying at him like a missile before he could secure his foothold. Ai Jiangtu quickly summoned his Magic Shield knowing that he did not have enough time to cast a Space Spell.

With a flicker of brown light, a rock crystal shield in the shape of a gem appeared in front of Ai Jiangtu and materialized!

BANG!

A huge chunk of the thick shield broke into pieces after receiving the powerful blow from the Scarlet Rending Demon. The impact knocked Ai Jiangtu flying.

The Scarlet Rending Demon felt some numbness from its body after ramming into the shield. It was extremely angry, as it had failed to smash the human into pieces together with his shield!

In the distance, Ai Jiangtu landed on another ice floe. It was not as sturdy anymore, it felt like he was about to fall into the icy water as the thin layer of ice that remained would break into pieces at any second.

Ai Jiangtu slid some distance on the ice. When he rose to his feet, a line of blood was rolling down his face!

“Demon Torture!” Ai Jiangtu uttered coldly. His eyes suddenly turned hollow and dim. The aura of the Curse Spell spread rapidly, and lunged at the Scarlet Rending Demon like menacing ghosts...

An enormous phantom appeared behind the Scarlet Rending Demon. It ferociously grabbed the limbs of the Scarlet Rending Demon and pinned the creature onto a pitch-black altar. It looked like it was going to tear the limbs off the creature!

The Scarlet Rending Demon did not react in time. Its limbs were completely pinned down, preventing it from moving!

The enormous phantom grinned with a twisted look and uttered ghastly cries. Its powerful arms extended further, pulling the creature’s limbs. The Scarlet Rending Demon struggled fiercely, yet even its Commander-level strength was helpless against the evil curse!

The Demon Torture grew even scarier. The Scarlet Rending Demon’s eyes flickered with a red light The water under the ice immediately rose and lunged at the phantom.

However, the phantom was illusionary. The water had no effect on it. It applied a greater force, leaving the Scarlet Rending Demon screaming in agony...

The truth was, the Scarlet Rending Demon was not actually being physically harmed at all. Its soul was being torn apart. The pain was greater than having its limbs torn apart physically!

When the Scarlet Rending Demon realized that its physical self was still unharmed, its soul had already suffered a severe damage. The pain spread throughout its entire body, making it stagger...

The soul of a Commander-level creature was extraordinarily powerful. The Demon Torture could at most inflict serious damage to its soul, and not kill it.

However, it was more than enough for Ai Jiangtu. The soul was linked to the mind. It was likely that the Scarlet Rending Demon could no longer control the seawater with its eyes, making it less threatening.

Ai Jiangtu continued to back off. The Scarlet Rending Demon would drag him into the water at any second. Once he fell into the sea, he would be an easy target.

Taking a deep breath, Ai Jiangtu felt his chest filling with blood, making his breathing difficult. He could not afford to make a mistake; he simply stood in the distance staring at the Scarlet Rending Demon.

The Scarlet Rending Demon had just suffered enormous pain. Its soul and mind were badly damaged, and it did not dare to make a move boldly. The human was a lot more difficult to handle than it had imagined. It was glaring at Ai Jiangtu as it tried to catch its breath.

——

“Ai Jiangtu, are you alright?” Nanyu hurriedly made her way over. She frowned when she saw Ai Jiangtu was injured.

“Fine... I’m fine,” Ai Jiangtu barely responded, as he had difficulty breathing.

“As expected of the captain, to be alive still after fighting the Scarlet Rending Demon for so long!” Mo Fan raised his thumb at Ai Jiangtu.

“Are you done throwing salt? You’re an Advanced Magician too, go on and fight the creature!” Nanyu gave Mo Fan a death stare.

“Together, we’ll fight together, it’s not like you didn’t see how slow I am when casting an Advanced Spell. The Scarlet Rending Demon would have killed me more than ten times before I finished my chants,” said Mo Fan modestly.

“I’ve injured its soul with the Demon Torture, it won’t be able to cast any spells, now is the best time to kill it...” Ai Jiangtu reminded them.

The representatives of the national team were indeed super freaks chosen from the entire country. None of them showed any sign of fear, even when they were facing a Commander-level creature. Gong Yu was the first to engage, but this time, he did not simply walk up and attack with his claw gauntlet. After all, a Commander-level creature was definitely stronger than him when fighting at melee range...

He stayed a distance away and began casting Wind Disc. The fierce gust of wind swept over the Scarlet Rending Demon, yet the creature simply stood still as the wind struck its armored scales. It did not even act like it was under attack.

Gong Yu grinned when he saw the Scarlet Rending Demon not treating his attack seriously!

“Poison Cavity!”

Zu Jiming was obviously Gong Yu’s old partner. He spread his poison after Gong Yu cast the Wind Disc.

A wind hole appeared in the center of Zu Jiming’s palm. Countless fine particles flew out of the hole and circled the Scarlet Rending Demon, together with the Wind Disc.

Unlike the fierce wind that was lashing at the Scarlet Rending Demon, the wind produced by the Poison Cavity consisted of tiny poisonous wasps. They were as tiny as dust particles, and were like a soft breeze when they were flying. However, they were little demons that were sensitive to wounds, fresh blood, and open injuries.

The Scarlet Rending Demon’s chestplate had already cracked open. It was the spot where Mo Fan had landed his Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons. Ai Jiangtu had also managed to enlarge the wound, and blue blood was dripping from it.
