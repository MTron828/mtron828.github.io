Mo Fan stood on a tall balcony and glanced down. He saw that the crowd was already squeezing their way out of the building.

Their tiny heads were swarming forward with a loud noise, as if a huge protest was going on with boards and banners waving “Say No to the Undead!”

He roughly estimated the crowd numbered at least seven hundred people!

There were not many Magicians in the crowd. Previously, there were only thirty Magicians in the building, but after recruiting six hundred more people, there were ninety Magicians in total, less than a hundred. On top of that, most of them were only Basic Magicians.

There were only seventeen Intermediate Magicians, including himself, Shorty, Zhou Ming, and Mu Bai.

As for the other thirteen Magicians, only two of them had Soul Seeds. Therefore, it was extremely impractical for them to try clearing a path through over a thousand undead.

The world had always been cruel. Mo Fan felt like he had done everything he could. He could only pray that fewer people would die when they were trying to cross to the other side of the street on the zebra-crossing...

The thousand undead were scattered along the dead street, therefore not everyone would be immediately targeted by an undead. Mo Fan speculated that around a hundred people would be dragged into the water by the crocodiles.

A one-seventh chance of dying. Apart from those whose brains had already gone blank because of overwhelming fear, most people would rather bet their lives on it instead.

When Mo Fan was thinking about how petty the human race was, a quarrel broke out on the surface.

“Don’t let me repeat it again; let people with infants stay in the middle!” said Shorty coldly as he grabbed a man in a leather jacket.

“What right does he have, he’s an adult too! Is it just because he’s carrying a baby? I would have picked up an infant along the way too! I’ve seen many kids who no one even cares about!” challenged the man in the leather jacket.

“Are you daring me to throw you onto the street now?” Shorty did not waste any time with the man. He simply dragged him out from the crowd.

“Alright, alright, I’ll listen to you, I’ll let him go inside...” The man in the leather jacket was no match for Shorty. He had never seen such an immoral Magician.

“Damn it, you just have to force me to be rough with you. Everyone, listen up; kids who are shorter than one twenty centimeters will stay in the middle. Those who are on the outside, shut the f**k up, since us Magicians who are risking our lives for you without getting paid will be on the outermost layer!” yelled Shorty furiously.

“But people who are carrying kids when they are adults themselves...” someone blurted out among the crowd.

It was difficult to control the situation involving so many people. Everyone was seeing their own life as precious, no one would want to be on the outer layers, since they were the easiest targets.

“I’ll leave this little guy to you,” To stop the crowd from rioting, the man carrying the little boy expressionlessly handed the kid to one of the elderly women.

The woman was wearing dancing shoes. She had most likely woken up early in the morning to attend a dance in the public square. The woman received the crying kid and said, “I still haven’t heard from my poor grandchild. Don’t worry, I’ll look after your son.”

The man with gray hair nodded. He proceeded to the outermost layer without commenting further.

“Humph, are you satisfied now? If so, then shut the f**k up. Us Wind Magicians worked hard to keep the undead away just so everyone can group up here. I don’t want you attracting their attention again,” Shorty snarled unpleasantly.

After venting his grudge, Shorty raised his head and gave Mo Fan a signal, telling him that the crowd was about to cross the street!

A crowd of seven hundred people... the truth was, it did not really matter who was on the inner or outer layers. The people would surely panic while crossing the street, the situation was going to be messy. It was purely a matter of luck when it came down to who would survive in the end...

“Mo Fa, I’ll leave the high ground to you.” Mu Bai, who had somehow become the leader of the group without him noticing, said to Mo Fan up on the balcony. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Mm,” Mo Fan nodded.

The truth was, Mo Fan was not a natural leader. He was able to make quick decisions in his own view, thus he had no problem leading a small group of Magicians. However, he was not very capable of leading a large group like this.

For those who kept complaining, if Mo Fan felt annoyed, he would simply end those idiots’ lives before the undead were involved.

“By the way, shouldn’t I be covering the high ground? My primary Element is Wind, and my secondary Element is Water. Either the Wind Disc or the Rolling Wave has a huge coverage area to sweep the undead away, I’m more suitable for the job,” said an ordinary-looking Magician, who obviously came from a renowned family.

“Du Lekang, stop trying to make decisions on your own. Let’s focus on crossing the street,” said the girl with him.

“I’m just worried, he looks like he’s only in the twenties. How strong could he be, at least I’m-” said Du Lekang.

“Enough with your crap, the people are moving, we Magicians should focus on protecting them.”

Du Lekang glanced up at Mo Fan on the higher ground. He was not too convinced about leaving such an important role to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was not too bothered. He was responsible for eliminating huge groups of undead and communicating with the Imperial Magician Zuo Feng from before.

With such a large crowd, it was impossible to hide their presence for long. They would soon attract the attention of the Flesh Mound Corpse Official in the middle of the street. Once the Corpse Official started making its way toward them, there would not be one to two hundred casualties, it was possible that the whole group would be wiped out!

Therefore, they had to wait until the Imperial Magicians engaged the Corpse General and lured it and some other Warrior-level undead far away from the crowd. Otherwise, they would have trouble crossing the street safely.

“Shadow Magician, we’re about to engage, ask your people to prepare themselves. Remember, you have to be quick, we can’t guarantee that the Corpse Official won’t turn around and focus on the crowd instead!” Zuo Feng voice came.

His voice was still echoing in Mo Fan’s ears when a sudden gust swept across the street, breaking the glasses on the nearby buildings!

Mo Fan glanced ahead and immediately saw the Imperial Magician named Zuo Feng!

The Wind Wings on his back were extraordinarily glamorous, almost four meters long when fully extended. A gust in the shape of a spiral followed behind his figure...

As Zuo Feng beat his wings, he glided rapidly across the buildings utilizing the Wind Track the wings had produced. Even the puddles on the ground could only reflect a blurry figure!

The undead on the ground felt something sweeping past above them. As they slowly turned their heads around, the Imperial Magician had already flown a hundred meters past them. The group of idiotic creatures finally chased after him!

“This Zuo Feng purposely lured a group of undead away just so it’s safer for the people to cross the street. He’s a nice guy!” exclaimed Mo Fan.

A moment later, while the undead was less dense, Mo Fan gave Mu Bai the signal.

Mu Bai finally ‘blew the horn’ to signal the people to advance forward. The people in front did not want to move at the start, but when the people behind shoved them forward, they were forced to move, as they would be trampled to death if they remained still...

As such, the crowd began to move forward. Seven hundred people had suddenly turned into a suicide squad as they rushed out from the building, straight toward the street that was crawling with undead!
