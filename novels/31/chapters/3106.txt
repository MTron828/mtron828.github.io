Chapter 3107: Demon King’s Dream

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The milky white clouds resembled floating fortresses in the sky. They hovered in the infinite green sky and reflected in the turquoise sea.

A silvery beach stretched out across the horizon. As the horizon unfolded, one could see that the beach was larger than expected. It was like a desert in the middle of the ocean.

Suddenly, cold air swept across the silvery beach and filled the green sky.

There were ripples on the sea. The ripples became still in just a few seconds. They then transformed into beautiful, crystal-clear sea patterns.

The sea was frozen.

Not only was the sea surface frozen but also the green sky. It didn’t matter how strong the wind was, the clouds resembling fortresses remained unchanged. They looked as if they had turned into real glacial fortresses. As their weight increased, they began to fall…

Bam!

The ice cloud fortresses smashed into the sea, but the sea surface, which was covered with patterns, did not shatter. The ice layer was unimaginably thick. It was unbreakable!

Swish!

On top of the green sky dome appeared a sword as thin as a leaf. The sword glistened in the glaring sunlight. Its fluctuating aura and glow spread across the sky.

The sword plunged straight into the silvery desert island.

A miserable scream was heard from the silvery desert. The gravel creatures somehow came back to life suddenly. They struggled in pain under the sword’s glow and tried to flee.

The Exotic Frost Sword glowed brightly. The resurrected silvery gravel creatures withered in an instant. They went from being alive to losing their lives in moments. They lost their luster and became dull. The silvery desert island with its breathtaking sea view turned into a black Gobi Desert within moments.

“Xuexue, let me do this… shouted a man from the sky.

His cry echoed in the sky. A flawless and fair silhouette had teleported to where the slender sword was. She took a proud stance. Suddenly, the sword divided into millions of streams and formed a massive ice sword vortex.

The vortex made up of millions of frost swords moved downward. The remaining silvery gravel creatures were wiped out. No one survived, including the enormous silver demon that was hidden under the silvery desert.

When the entire silvery desert vanished, all that was left was a frozen and deserted island in the blue sea beneath the green sky.

MO Fan arrived late. When he saw the beautiful woman on the island, he let out a long sigh.

‘Why are beautiful women so aggressive?’

“You could have left some creatures for me to kill. You killed the Silver Shell Demon Army and the wounded Shell Demon Ruler. We agreed that this is our honeymoon demon-hunting trip. You could have let me in on some of the action!”

MO Fan sighed. Teaming up with Mu Ningxue wasn’t fun at all. ‘Maybe I should just focus on flirting with her…’

The silvery desert did not contain real gravel. In fact, the gravel itself was an army of Shell Demons that had multiplied and flooded the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean was like a massive breeding ground for the two most terrifying populations—Salamanders and Shell Demons.

The scholars from the Sacred Hall of Liberty had prepared the statistics, and their calculations included mages from all over the world. Theoretically speaking, if the mages unleashed and exhausted their destructive magic on the Salamander Kingdom and the Shell Demon Kingdom, the demons would still have about one-third of their population left.

Moreover, the remaining one-third of the population could be restored to the “peak” of their population in just a few years.

Without their natural predators, they could expand to the land after exhausting the resources in the ocean. By then, even the forests, soil, and rocks may become their source of nutrients.

MO Fan and Mu Ningxue had recently been wandering in the East Ocean and distant ocean. They did everything they could to destroy anything that could threaten the ocean in the next five years. However, there were too many unknown factors in the world. The threat that they identified might not even be considered real threats. Even though MO Fan and Mu Ningxue had reached a high realm in their cultivation, they could only do their best to minimize the upcoming threats.

“Let’s go back.” Mu Ningxue glanced at the dirty ocean. She disliked the smell of the mutilated carcasses.

“Okay.” MO Fan drew something in the air with his finger, as if there was a transparent touch screen before him. Silver dots were seen connecting the lines before slowly stretching into a silver spatial pattern.

MO Fan drew a teleportation formation. The magic did not have much use in real combat. After all, one couldn’t find time to slowly construct the pattern in a fight. However, the teleportation formation was convenient if they wanted to go home early during their leisure time.

Of course, there were not many people in the world who could draw the teleportation formation. Most of the teleportation formation included a huge device that was not portable.

“Let me help you.” Mu Ningxue walked to him and channeled her magic into areas of the teleportation formation that MO Fan still needed to light up.

“No need..

“I want to learn,” said Mu Ningxue.

“Okay. Outline the Constellation space nodes,” said MO Fan.

Mu Ningxue was also a Space Element Mage. However, she had not reached MO Fan’s realm.

Although MO Fan possessed most of the magic elements, he still needed to solidify the foundation for each element. As such, his cultivation path extended..

Everything had boundaries. The reason they were at the top of the world but could not see a higher realm was because they had not broken the bottleneck.

“Done. With my skill, even if there’s some deviation, it can still teleport us back to the shallow sea in the East Ocean. If there’s no major problem, we will arrive at Flying Bird Base City,” said MO Fan to Mu Ningxue.

He stretched out his hand and guided Mu Ningxue to stand in the center of the teleportation formation. MO Fan hugged Mu Ningxue tightly so that they would not be blown apart by the space turbulence.

They looked like a couple dancing in the center of a stage as they stood in the teleportation formation. After MO Fan snapped his finger, silver energy glowed brilliantly. The interwoven silver dots and silver threads were dreamy to look at. The atmosphere was romantic.

They disappeared in the teleportation formation when the glow was at its brightest. The blue sea became tranquil again in just a few seconds. Just when the sea became still, something boiled within.

Small creatures with horns were making noises in the boiling water. They grabbed the Shell Demons’ carcasses in excitement. It seemed like those would be their lunch. As they ate, they grew. Some of them had scales growing on their bodies, some of them developed wings, while others began to transform…

In the Indian Ocean tropical zone, there was a turquoise-blue island that looked breathtaking. A luxury hotel was built somewhere nearby. Silvery diamond specks of dust were sprinkled on the white sandy beach before they gradually dissolved.

MO Fan and Mu Ningxue stood on the soft sand. They were puzzled as they experienced the warmth that was very unlikely in the autumn and winter seasons.

“Um… It seems like there’s a minor deviation.” MO Fan scratched his head in embarrassment. Fortunately, it was a populated area. Besides, there was a stunning hotel on the island.

“We’re in the Indian Ocean,” said Mu Ningxue gruffly.

Mu Ningxue saw some signs on the buildings. If she wasn’t mistaken, they were somewhere in the Maldives.

Maldives was located at the equator of the Indian Ocean. It was more than just a “minor deviation” as MO Fan put it. They were off by a quarter of the earth!

“Ahem… it’s just an accident,” said MO Fan awkwardly.

Mu Ningxue stared at MO Fan. She was now determined to seek a better mentor to teach her Space Element Magic.

She surveyed her surroundings. Although the area was surrounded by the vast ocean, she did not sense any danger from the Ocean Demons. The place was so serene that it felt like they were in an isolated country. There was no pollution. It was truly pure and uncontaminated…

Mu Ningxue recalled the silver forest and lake.

“Let us take a rest here,” said Mu Ningxue.

“I still don’t know where this place is,” said MO Fan.

“This place is quite nice…”

Mu Ningxue stood with her hands behind her back. She stretched up to the tips of her toes and breathed in the clean air.

MO Fan watched her in a daze. Her unguarded side was something that was rarely seen. He understood her because he had struggled in the darkness of hell too. She had survived the Eternal Night in the Extreme South Land.

They both knew that the most difficult thing to deal with wasn’t the harsh and hopeless environment, but the fear and the loneliness of the possibility that they might never see the person they loved ever again.

It did not matter where they were. It was enough if they could spend some time together in comfort…

It was enough if they could hug, kiss, and make love to each other throughout the day.

“MO Fan?”

“Huh?!”

Mu Ningxue called his name multiple times. She saw his dirty thoughts in his brightly lit eyes.

‘Why does he always have such dirty thoughts every second of every day?’ “Come, let’s sleep together! Um… I mean, let’s go to the island!”

“MO Fan, did you purposely bring us here?” Mu Ningxue began to suspect that the deviated space travel was done on purpose. MO Fan had planned it a long time ago!

“So what?” MO Fan realized that Mu Ningxue wasn’t fooled by his poor acting. He decided to be honest.

He lifted Mu Ningxue in his arms. There was one line he had read somewhere when he was young. “My princess, I have intruded into your castle. I can build a more robust and magnificent castle for you. From here on out, you are still the princess, but you are solely mine.”

A castle with towering walls and small streets…

To Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue was like a princess who lived inside a huge castle with towering walls. Stories were often told about the prince defeating the demon king and marrying the princess.

MO Fan knew he was not a prince, but he wanted to be an undefeatable demon king so that he could imprison the princess in his castle forever…

And he would get rid of those shameless princes who had nothing but handsome faces!

He wanted to make the princess his beautiful captive. They would live happily ever after and have many children together..
