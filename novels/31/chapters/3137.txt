Chapter 3137 - 3137: There Was Nothing Wrong With Using a Little Trick

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation       Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’ll repent!

“Let me explain, please!”

MO Fan’s neck felt colder and colder. He made strange noises like a panicked bird.

However, it was hard to understand someone who was repenting. Eventually, the cold blade pierced MO Fan’s neck.

Creak! Creak!

Strangely, the sound of the blade cutting into MO Fan’s neck was very unusual. It sounded like it was slicing through ancient metal.

The Trickster God noticed something odd. After looking closely, he realized that there was strange black metal covering MO Fan’s neck.

At first, the Trickster God did not think much of it and even looked down on the metal.

Even if MO Fan had metal around his neck, the Blade of Repentance could still cut through it effortlessly.

However, the Trickster God soon realized that something was off. MO Fan’s body felt too cold!

It was unnaturally icy and even sent shivers down his spine.

Why would someone who controlled the Holy Fame be so cold?!

Finally, the Trickster God realized what was going on. Meanwhile, the Blade of Repentance had already cut through MO Fan’s neck. It was fast, and no blood came out!

To the other Einherjar Spirits, it looked like MO Fan had lost his head. But strangely, MO Fan’s “body” moved a few steps forward like a unique divine being. He even picked his head up from the ground.

This made all the Einherjar Spirits shudder. They wondered if this was the divine art of the Wicked God. Did cutting off his head still not harm him?

“Hahaha. I was just teasing you all. You sneaky old guy. Do you think my dragon sense is useless?” the Black Dragon Armor under the ancient wall suddenly spoke.

The Black Dragon Armor slowly moved forward in the shadows. As the shadows cleared, a lifelike MO Fan appeared.

Meanwhile, the “headless” MO Fan had transformed into black armor. This armor had some intelligence and could copy all of MO Fan’s movements.

“Dark Puppet Magic?” The Trickster God quickly realized his grave error. The Blade of Repentance could lock onto enemies and make them undergo repentance no matter how strong they were.

However, if the person had already used Dark Puppet Magic before the Blade of Repentance could lock their soul, it would end up slicing into empty armor!

“I’m not someone you can boss around!” MO Fan sneered and glared at the Trickster God.

He raised his hand and summoned many black evil blades around him. Each blade carried a deadly curse, and their glow was too intense to look at directly!

With a gesture, the blades transformed into a rushing river and headed straight toward the Trickster God. Their piercing sounds made the others tremble.

However, the hanging Trickster God showed great agility. He landed on the ground first, then jumped into the air like a circus performer.

In the sky, there was a patch of mist, and it seemed to belong to him. The river of evil blades began to rush toward the sky, but the Trickster God cast a spell and made all the evil blades vanish in the mist. The corners of MO Fan’s mouth curled up slightly.

The Trickster God was foolish.

Compared to MO Fan, the master of deceitful abilities in the Space Element, Chaos Element, and Shadow Element, the Trickster God’s tricks were mere illusions, not real destructive Forbidden Curses!

MO Fan could tell that the Trickster God was seen as a god because he possessed the Blade of Repentance. He was essentially just a servant who had maximized the blade’s power.

Suddenly, MO Fan changed his hand gesture. Then, the evil blades that vanished surged out from the mist. This time, they multiplied through the Sealing Spell. As MO Fan controlled them, the evil blades merged into a bloody evil dragon!

The bloody evil dragon exuded a lot of holy and evil energy. It was just like a dragon from a dark legend. With a swing of its tail, it dispersed the mist and hit the Trickster God who was hidden within.

The Trickster God crashed to the ground and coughed up blood.

The bloody evil dragon suddenly turned into a formation of destruction and fiercely attacked the ground from above!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Its attack left many holes in the Four Spirits Killing Fields. The Trickster God’s body was pierced all over by those sharp evil blades, like a criminal nailed to the spot.

There was no hint of misery, pain, or grievance, just a humble plea. The Trickster God begged MO Fan to kill him directly to ease his torment before his soul departed to the Nether Ocean.

MO Fan was understanding. He quickly finished off the Trickster God. Otherwise, with the power of the Wicked God, he could have tortured the Einherjar Spirits endlessly and made them wish for a swift end to their suffering!

The Trickster God’s Soul Remnant dispersed into the Nether Ocean and added more shine to the Azure Dragon’s scales.

MO Fan turned around and arrogantly faced the large group of Einherjar Spirits, who were ready to attack him.

Who else dared to challenge him?!

The Evil Saint King’s power, which MO Fan displayed in executing the Trickster God, was enough to intimidate these souls.

They just had to exist in this world in another way. No matter how powerful they once were or how many people submitted to them in the past, they were all just souls in the end. Some would join MO Fan, some would be refined, and some would contribute to this world.

“MO Fan…” Asha’ruiya’s voice came from behind.

MO Fan planned to turn around and smile charmingly at his sweetheart. But as he turned his neck, it felt stiff, like something had caught him.

Suddenly, MO Fan felt a cold shiver.

Oh no, the Blade of Repentance!

When did it end up back around his neck?!

“I let my guard down. The Trickster God and the Blade of Repentance are two different entities.” MO Fan sighed deeply.

He knew the Trickster God was not the real threat; it was the blade. He should have dealt with it first.

“Will repenting again make a difference now?” MO Fan forced a smile.

This time, the Blade of Repentance did not give MO Fan any chance to repent. It pierced MO Fan’s skin and left a bloody mark on his neck!

At the same time, outside the vessel, MO Fan’s still body was affected. Blood started trickling from his neck!Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even the Bright Blood King, who had been watching, was surprised.

It was indeed a divine weapon. Not only did it cut MO Fan’s soul inside the vessel, but it could also kill his physical body!

It was powerful and frightening!

No wonder the Trickster God remained the top Shadow Element Mage for a century. It was all thanks to the Blade of Repentance!

MO Fan could not move in the Four Spirits Killing Fields, and he felt the despair of facing execution.

At the last moment, the Azure Dragon on the battlefield suddenly opened its eyes. Its powerful gaze focused on the Blade of Repentance that was about to strike.

At that moment, time froze.

The waves in the Nether Ocean, the Einherjar Spirits in the Four Spirits Killing Fields, and the lifelike divine skeletons on the ancient wall all became a frozen scene!

In this scene, only the Azure Dragon was moving.

It got up from the “judge’s seat” on the battlefield and moved to the ground. Its eyes stayed fixed on the Blade of Repentance the entire time.

The Blade of Repentance appeared still, but it continued to cut slowly into MO Fan’s blood vessels.

However, it was clear that the Blade of Repentance was also feeling immense pressure. It was like a terrified criminal. Despite holding a knife and a hostage, facing the Azure Dragon felt like being surrounded by an army.

The Azure Dragon opened its mouth and blew a breath. This breath flew toward one of the divine skeletons on the ancient wall.

The divine skeleton immediately glowed with a swirling light, like a gateway to rebirth.

The Azure Dragon kept its gaze on the Blade of Repentance.

It only gave the Blade of Repentance one chance.

It either joined the sixty-four Einherjar Spirits or faced destruction.

The Blade of Repentance had its own thinking.

It was making a decision.

Would it kill the master of the Azure Dragon’s world, or would it submit?

“How about you repent, too?” the unmoving MO Fan suddenly suggested.

This unexpected voice startled the Blade of Repentance. It nearly sliced MO Fan’s major artery!

“Haha. This is the Azure Dragon’s power to freeze time. We’re one, so I won’t be affected. Don’t worry. To the outside world, it’s just a moment. Even if you repent for days, they won’t know you’ve surrendered,” MO Fan explained.

“I have to admit it. You’re the strangest and most powerful weapon I’ve ever encountered. Your divine art is so great that even if you target a puppet, you can still kill the original body. This original body includes my body in the outside world, right?” MO Fan knew the Blade of Repentance could not talk, so he tried to persuade it.

“Let’s not forget I can be reborn. Even if your strike carries a death curse that would turn me into an inanimate object like others here, I’m still the Evil Saint King. My soul belongs here. Removing my physical body from the mortal world will only speed up my rise to the throne of the Wicked God. By then, I’ll still come for you. So, think carefully. You can sacrifice everything to destroy my body and face the true wrath of the Evil Saint King. Or you can join me, and I promise you’ll live well under my rule.”

The Blade of Repentance hesitated.

In fact, it was not entirely sure it could kill MO Fan.

It was inside the world that belonged to the Azure Dragon, and the Azure Dragon could freeze time. No matter how fast the Blade of Repentance was, it had to surpass the freezing time.

It had locked MO Fan’s soul and could execute him. He could not do anything about it.

However, with time frozen, MO Fan could find unexpected ways to resolve the situation. Although the Blade of Repentance appeared to have the upper hand, it actually had no other choices.

Clank!

Suddenly, the Blade of Repentance retreated.

It ultimately gave up.

Whether it could kill MO Fan did not matter anymore.

Even if it succeeded, the consequences were severe.

Between the Shadow Element Mage, who could only dominate an era with its support, and the person who would still be the Evil Saint King after dying, the

Blade of Repentance knew which was the wiser choice.

The Blade of Repentance moved away from MO Fan’s neck.

As it retreated, the time unfroze.

When it tried to cut MO Fan’s neck, it faced resistance from time, so it was difficult to proceed.

Just this show of power was enough to make the Blade of Repentance surrender.

“Great. You’re a good one. You can go now. You’ve earned your place among these sixty-four divine skeletons,” MO Fan said happily. He even reached out to touch the Blade of Repentance floating in the air.

There was still some blood on it. After choosing to submit, it started to feel ashamed.

“No worries. Let’s see it as a contract between us. If I ever get killed, you don’t need to avenge me. I also hope you live well in this world, regardless of the method.

“Of course, there’s probably nothing in this world that can kill me. My only weakness is time, but I don’t see time as my enemy.”

MO Fan’s bold words shocked the Blade of Repentance.

It was just a weapon. It did not understand the complex language used to show off. However, it felt that its new master was impressive and profound. No wonder his confession of repentance was so poetic.

“Alright. Blade of Bagua, go back to your spot.” MO Fan pointed with his hand and showed where the Blade of Repentance could stay.

If the Blade of Repentance had a body, it would have thanked MO Fan.

MO Fan called it the Blade of Bagua.

The Four Spirits Killing Fields had the Bagua pattern. Did it mean it was the most powerful Einherjar Spirits there?

So, the powerful weapon that could hear others’ secrets before they died happily flew toward its new home. It merged with the divine skeleton of a falcon.

After dealing with the Blade of Repentance’s divine art, the Azure Dragon returned to its “judge’s seat.”

Since it was its place, there was nothing wrong with using a little trick.

MO Fan was proud of the Azure Dragon’s timely help.

However, the Blade of Repentance was indeed impressive.

If MO Fan ran into a Forbidden Mage wielding such a weapon outside, he might meet his end.

The strange treasures and powerful spirits in the world were formidable. MO Fan should keep a healthy respect for them. Otherwise, if he failed in a fight one day and his soul returned to the throne of the Evil Saint King, he would be laughed at by his subordinates for a lifetime.

The life of the Evil Saint King should be very long. His legend might not last forever, but his shame would surely stand out for thousands of years without fading!

“Everyone, no need to take turns. It’s a waste of time and not fun to watch. I prefer a scuffle. I’ll fight with all of you at once!” MO Fan was bold. It gazed at all the Einherjar Spirits with provocation.

To the Einherjar Spirits, the Blade of Repentance disappeared suddenly.

It was about to cut MO Fan’s head off just a moment ago. Why did it suddenly disappear?

They could not understand what had just happened. They only knew that MO Fan was powerful and that he liked to show off.

Generally, when someone had impressive abilities and had an air around them, people tended to respect them and hesitated to challenge them. But when they encountered someone like MO Fan, even though they knew MO Fan was powerful, they could not bear his arrogant attitude.

Seeing the Einherjar Spirits getting a bit worked up, MO Fan continued to hurl insults.

MO Fan might not have many other skills, but he was a master at verbally outsmarting his opponents.

Even powerful villains would do foolish things sometimes. They could maintain their arrogance only because they had not met someone strong with a dirty mouth. Such individuals could fight while hurling insults. Both upright people and villains would struggle to not lose their cool..
