“It’s not that complicated. My brother did something wrong to me, so I can no longer treat him as my brother. If I don’t kill him, he will do everything to kill me,” Zhao Manyan informed the monk.

“If I was your brother, I’d also do everything to kill you after what you did,” Wu Ku said.

“It’s not what you think it is. It’s true love between my brother’s fiancée and me,” Zhao Manyan stated righteously.

“Do you hear what you are saying? Brother, I can’t really give you good advice considering what I’ve done, but when it comes to the relationship between a man and a woman, as a dedicated believer of Buddhism, I must warn you about the consequences. You should have heard of the phrase ‘three knives and six holes’...” Wu Ku said delicately.

“Monk, you’re surprisingly experienced, but I ain’t Chan Ho-Nam,” Zhao Manyan chided him.

{TL Note: Chan Ho-Nam is a fictional character in ‘

Young and Dangerous’.}

“Chan Ho-Nam did it under the influence of drugs, but you weren’t. You didn’t use force on her, either. You have completely abandoned your basic virtue as a family member for your own pleasure. Forget it, I’m not going to convince you to join us. You might lay your hands on our brothers and sisters too!” Wu Ku placed his palms together and murmured “Amitabha” repeatedly under his breath.

Zhao Manyan blushed angrily. Why did no one believe in him?

He and Sancha were compatible soulmates. He resonated greatly with her interests, hobbies, and even the tiniest things. Why couldn’t they be together?

“Let’s not stray from the topic. Aren’t you supposed to give me guidance if you are a monk? Tell me, should I kill my brother, or should I spare his life and continue living like a fugitive?” Zhao Manyan demanded.

Wu Ku rubbed his sleeves and answered, “From your perspective, if you insist on stealing your brother’s lover, you should get rid of your brother, too. It’s in line with our teachings in the Black Vatican too, every man for himself.”

“Didn’t you say the Black Vatican’s mission is to free people?” Zhao Manyan pointed out.

“We are discussing your family now. Don’t be distracted,” Wu Ku rebuked him.

“Mm, actually, I’ve never told anyone these things. I’m not sure who I could discuss them with,” Zhao Manyan smiled wryly.

“That’s the nature of it. There are a lot of things we can’t talk about to our close ones, since they might be worried. We can’t tell our friends, either, as they won’t be able to relate what they have been through to your situation. You can only share your vicissitudes of life with strangers. Why do you think people like visiting temples and burning joss sticks so much?” Wu Ku exclaimed.

“Monk, I can tell you are an expert in this field. Why do you insist on sticking to the salvation plan when you don’t even believe it yourself? Why don’t you open a temple? I’ll invest in you. You can just give people advice everyday. It’s better than being a Head Priest in the Black Vatican. You’re not earning much from doing illegal stuff,” Zhao Manyan suggested.

“If I had met you earlier, I might be satisfied being a little monk in a temple. I could do a little fortune-telling and listen to people’s troubles...” Wu Ku admitted.

“It’s not too late now. You can save a lot of lives without doing anything. I can talk to Mo Fan and Mu Bai on your behalf too, so they can forgive what you did and let you be a proper monk,” Zhao Manyan said.

“It’s a little difficult,” Wu Ku sighed and shook his head.

“Why is it difficult? Just listen to my advice and lay down your knife to repent and be absolved of your crimes,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Fate has brought us together. I’ll read some scriptures to help your soul find peace in a moment,” Wu Ku said.

“Help my soul find peace? I’m not dead,” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

The rocks surrounding them turned into sand as soon as Zhao Manyan finished his sentence, blown away by the wind.

Sand drifted in the rain as the ring collapsed. Two men dressed in dark red and blue raincoats stood beside Wu Ku.

The men in raincoats were emitting an icy Aura, and glaring at Zhao Manyan as menacingly as leopards.

“My men are here. I’m afraid you won’t be alive for long. That being said, I’m a man of my word, so I will still read the scriptures for you,” Wu Ku smiled like a wily old fox.

“Bald donkey, how dare you set me up when I’m being honest with you!” Zhao Manyan snarled.

“It’s very simple to resolve your problems. If you die here, your mother won’t be sad, and your brother will never know you have slept with his fiancée. He can still marry her happily and you will be able to serve your father in Hell. Isn’t it perfect?” Wu Ku grinned like a mad monk. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Zhao Manyan backed away nervously.

“Farewell,” Wu Ku called out. He was only talking to Zhao Manyan to buy time until his men arrived to back him up.

He was not that good at fighting. He would let his men handle the killing instead!

“Likewise,” Zhao Manyan replied generously.

Wu Ku did not understand what Zhao Manyan said. He thought Zhao Manyan was only saying that after accepting his fate, when he suddenly sensed something deadly approaching from behind.

Wu Ku quickly dodged to the side and used the man in a dark red raincoat as cover.

The man in the dark red raincoat could not react in time, and the incoming lightning bolt blew a hole through his chest. His blood splattered across the ground.

“Asshole!” the other guy yelled angrily. He turned around and glared at the young Mage who was standing there soaked in the rain.

“You have no right to yell in front of me!” Mo Fan switched to the Shadow Element.

A black chain lunged at the man in the dark blue raincoat and wrapped around his neck. The hook at the end of the chain extended as the chain was pulled!

The front of the chain was covered by black spikes, which penetrated the man’s body without any resistance. His neck, chest, arms, and waist were impaled by the spikes, like a criminal undergoing trial.

The hook was stuck into the man’s body. Mo Fan whipped the chain and tossed the man to the side like he was just a piece of trash.

“I’m afraid you weren’t the only one waiting for backup. I might not be able to kill you, but my brother can!” Zhao Manyan grinned like a wily old fox too!

They were both adults. They were not naïve enough to think they could convince the other to change their beliefs in just a few sentences.

They were also both waiting for backup. Zhao Manyan was extremely confident he could trap the Head Priest of the Black Vatican for two hours!

Wu Ku began to panic. He could sense the demon inside Mo Fan was waking up!
