Two tongues of flames slowly rose on Mo Fan’s palms. As the heat of the flames reached its highest point, Mo Fan shoved them into the sky.

The flames rose into the air and set the clouds ablaze. The light of the fire dyed the whole sky red.

“Fall!” Mo Fan uttered, his eyes blazing. A rain of fireballs immediately poured down from the burning clouds.

The rain of fireballs had a huge coverage area. Mo Fan did not need to worry that the Scarlet Rending Demon was outside of the range of the spell. Mo Fan even centered the fire clouds right above the Scarlet Rending Demon to maximize the damage output.

The fireballs immediately turned the reefs into a sea of flames trying to devour the whole island.

The sea was filled with the color of fire. It looked as if the water had been set aflame. The Scarlet Rending Demon was already suffering serious injuries, and the dense fireballs landing on it burned down its remaining armor. The creature was directly suffering the burns from Mo Fan’s strongest Fire Spell.

The Scarlet Rending Demon was in great pain. It kept uttering a piercing screech, and tried to break free from Little Flame Belle’s suppression and flee into the ocean.

Mo Fan controlled the rain of fireballs to drop rapidly in the direction that the Scarlet Rending Demon was heading into. The area immediately surged ferociously. The Scarlet Rending Demon did not dare to risk its life and wove through the ocean of flames, running around frantically, like a headless fly!

The Advanced Spell was incredibly effective against a Commander-level creature. The Scarlet Rending Demon’s body began to turn scorched black, and its struggles gradually weakened. Mo Fan believed that the creature was approaching its death!

Just as Mo Fan thought the creature was about to fall in the ocean of flames, the Scarlet Rending Demon rushed out from the flames with shocking suddenness.

The creature was scorched completely black. Its flesh had festered from the burns, yet the incredible pain had given the Commander-level creature a strong will to live. Since it could not find its way into the water, it had no choice but to go all out and eliminate Mo Fan, who was channeling the spell!

Mo Fan was shocked by the Commander-level creature’s astonishing vitality, able to launch such a strong counterattack in its current condition!

It was the same in every fight between Magicians and demon creatures. No matter how favorable the situation was to any side, the outcome of the fight was still unknown as long as their enemy was still alive. Most Magicians failed to defeat creatures of their level, as these demon creatures’ savage natured surfaced when their lives were endangered!

Mo Fan did not predict the counterattack. The Scarlet Rending Demon was simply too cunning. Its intention to flee into the ocean while being surrounded by the flames was merely a ruse. It never tried to run away, it was determined to kill Mo Fan.

It simply allowed the flames to burn its body beyond recognition. Even when it was dying, it continued to search for Mo Fan’s position to deliver the final blow!

Once it killed Mo Fan, it could immediately jump into the sea and find a place to hide. It would soon recover after some rest. No matter how miserable it was in the fight, it would be the last one standing!

Mo Fan did not have time to dodge the attack. The Black Snake Armor was on cooldown, and he had already used the Departing Nether Shield too.

The long claws slashed down on Mo Fan’s right shoulder, tearing his chest open!

Fresh blood sprayed in the air from the cut. The blackened Scarlet Rending Demon uttered a mad chuckle, as if it had avenged all its people by killing Mo Fan!

Mo Fan’s face twitched when his chest was torn open, yet his eyes flickered icily amid the pain!

“Nine...Nine Dragons!”

The Scarlet Rending Demon did not notice that Mo Fan’s left fist was engulfed in flames!

The Scarlet Rending Demon was just about to dig its claws deeper into Mo Fan’s body to totally destroy his organs when Mo Fan threw his left fist right into the Scarlet Rending Demon’s chest!

The fist exploded at close proximity. Mo Fan could feel his fist penetrating into the Scarlet Rending Demon’s ribs!

The flames burst forward, nine fiery dragons exited through the Scarlet Rending Demon’s back and formed a brilliant flame geyser.

The Scarlet Rending Demon’s claws were stuck in Mo Fan’s flesh, yet they could not go any deeper as the creature’s organs were destroyed first. Its claws stiffened halfway as it lost its remaining life force!

The Scarlet Rending Demon slowly fell backward, its bloodshot stare replaced with a blank look. Perhaps it could never believe how calm the human was, to dare counterattack with his life at stake!

The charred Scarlet Rending Demon fell to the ground, dying after its body twitched a few times. No matter how tenacious the creature was, there was still an end to its life. Mo Fan’s punch at point-blank simply sealed the deal.

The Commander-level sea monster had ruled this area for many years, yet its dominance had ended today.

The shadows looming over the children of Feiniao City had been destroyed!

Fresh blood clots fell to the ground, and soon turned into a great pool of blood.

Mo Fan was completely exhausted and fell on his back, exposing the shocking wound on his chest to the sky, as if the sunlight could heal it.

Little Flame Belle flew over to Mo Fan’s side. Her giant eyes began to tear up like bursting taps, yet instead of crying tears, red boiling liquid poured out from her eyes and turned into crystals when they landed on the ground...

“Why are you crying; daddy isn’t going to die, I’m just a bit tired,” Mo Fan painfully extended his left hand and patted little Flame Belle’s head.

Mo Fan chose not to dodge the attack or try setting up some meaningless defense, but he did not just stand there, either. He had decided to play the game of seeing who was going to die first, and he had emerged victorious. He was the one that survived!

It was Mo Fan’s first time killing a Commander-level creature by himself. He experienced a great emotional ride after the difficult fight.

Unlike fighting with the Demon Element’s power, the fight felt much more (ow) realistic to Mo Fan.

That being said, the awakening of the Demon Element did make Mo Fan’s flesh a lot stronger than ordinary people, so even if his chest was torn open... he should still be fine, right?

“Mmm?” Mo Fan discovered a glowing light dot that looked like a crystal flying toward him while he was still thinking about the punch that decided his life and death. More accurately speaking, it was flying toward the Little Loach Pendant.

It was the creature’s Soul Remnant. The Soul Remnant of a Commander-level creature was quite valuable, or so Mo Fan thought.

However, Mo Fan realized something after taking a closer look. -Hang on, that’s not a Soul Remnant. It’s a Soul Essence, a Commander-level Soul Essence!-

“Holy-” Before Mo Fan could cry out the word ‘shit’ in joy and astonishment, he immediately groaned in pain!

-That f**king hurts!-
