“Holy crap! If the tide does rise, there’s no way we can evacuate the city in eight hours. These sea monsters are seriously smart!” Mo Fan cursed.

They had sent some high-level creatures to scout the island first. Then they sent the Viscera Hunters to sneak into the island to find a good entry point for the magical beasts that were able to trigger a tide rise and speed up the rate the sea water was devouring the city, so the rest of the sea monsters could invade the city too! Mo Fan had witnessed how cunning and evil these sea monsters were. They were not giving the city any chance to survive!

“There are a few more magical beasts further away, if they all use their power at the same time...” Shen Qing’s eyes were filled with despair. Even though she was only watching the beasts swimming to the island, she could already imagine the terrifying tide rising above the hills and the higher ground, including some of the tall buildings and bridges!

The number of sea monsters was many times that of the number of demon creatures on land. If the tide rose, the city would be full of sea monsters. The place would turn into a bloodbath before the eight-hour mark!

“Backup... someone, call for backup right now, tell the authorities that four Magical Sea Beasts have appeared. They are going to bring in a huge tide!” Zhang Xin had already lost his mind. He kept telling the others to call for backup, yet he was constantly backing away like he had an urge to flee for his life at once.

“It’s too late. It doesn’t take a long time for these Magical Sea Beasts to Summon the tide, not to mention there are four of them here! I doubt we can find any backup now under the circumstances, and even if we did, the tide will already be approaching like a gray line of mountains by the time our backup arrives,” Lingling said, shaking her head.

If only they could have found out what the Viscera Hunters were up to and learned of the existence of the Magical Sea Beasts half an hour earlier, they might have had a chance to stop the tragedy, but it was too late now. The Magical Sea Beasts could Summon a tide from a great distance away. It was already disastrous that the Magical Sea Beasts were in the vicinity of the island, let alone letting them reach Wuyuan Bay!

“What if we take out the Magical Sea Beasts?” Zhang Lulin asked.

“Didn’t you see the Viscera Hunters holding their positions like guards around the Magical Sea Beasts? If they can come up with the plan to bring the Magical Sea Beasts here, they are obviously going to protect the Magical Sea Beasts! Each of the Magical Sea Beasts has around a hundred Viscera Hunters by their sides, without including those that are still hiding in the water. These Viscera Hunters have already invaded the bay, yet they didn’t attack any person or building. It simply means their mission is to protect the Magical Sea Beasts. They can easily overwhelm any troop that is trying to kill the Magical Sea Beasts!” Zhang Xin blurted out in a trembling voice.

Even Advanced Mages were not going to last for more than half a minute against so many Viscera Hunters. They were thinking of helping the city just a few moments ago, but Zhang Xin’s mind was now completely occupied about how to guarantee his own safety. Once the Magical Sea Beasts Summoned a huge tide, countless sea monsters would invade the city by riding the waves.

“Lingling, how do these Magical Sea Beasts Summon the Tide?” Mo Fan asked urgently.

Lingling did not answer, since she did not necessarily know everything. The Magical Sea Beasts were an extremely rare species. Humans did not know much about them in the first place. Lingling had only read some books that mentioned them, but not much detail had been included.

“Can you see the thing that looks like a huge bell on their backs? It’s called the Tide Commanding Shell. When the Magical Sea Beasts shake their bodies vigorously, the Tide Commanding Shell will produce a sonic wave beyond our hearing range. The wave will manipulate the tide and gather the waves and undercurrents to its source. A Sea Magical Beast can double the height of a normal tide. The sonic waves are stackable too, meaning that if a Sea Magical Beast can double the tide’s height, two Magical Sea Beasts will multiply the tide’s height by four. Therefore, a single Sea Magical Beast might not matter much, but if two of them show up, the rising tide can easily overwhelm a lot of things!” Shen Qing explained what she knew.

Mo Fan gasped when he learned the principles behind the Sea Magical Beast’s power.

If two Magical Sea Beasts could multiply the tide’s height by four times, wouldn’t it mean the tide would be thirty-two times taller if there were four Magical Sea Beasts!

{TL Note: I’m not a Mathematician, but shouldn’t it be 16 times instead?}

A one-meter-high wave would turn into a giant wave thirty-two meters high!

Besides, the waves were already very high due to the wild weather. If they were pushed even higher...

“Why does such a terrifying species exist in this world?” Mo Fan did not expect the power of the Magical Sea Beasts to be even scarier than he thought.

“They are spirits of the sea in the first place. Otherwise, why do you think people worshipped them in ancient times? However, with four of them showing up at the same time, I’m afraid the tide is going to be...” Shen Qing was more familiar with the terrifying ability of the Magical Sea Beasts than anyone else there.

However, why would these magical beasts allow the army of sea monsters to control them and bring great disasters to their land?

Zhang Lulin was already firing regrouping signals into the sky. The light soared into the gray sky and made the raindrops sparkle. The light was reflected on Shen Qing’s face as she turned to Mo Fan.

For some reason, Shen Qing was placing all her hopes on Mo Fan. The man was clearly not afraid of Viscera Hunters, judging from the strength he had displayed.

“Mo Fan, could you...” Shen Qing realized how naive she was in the middle of her sentence.

How was it even possible? People would be fleeing for their lives like Zhang Xin when facing so many Viscera Hunters. There was no way Mo Fan could handle the situation by himself. They were too late!

“You shouldn’t place too much hope on me. The things I can do are very limited,” Mo Fan knew what Shen Qing wanted to say. Her eyes were filled with helplessness and pleading. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I...I know, I’m sorry,” Shen Qing was a little disappointed. She said, “Let’s go, we should warn the Donghai Magic Association and the military.”

“Go? I didn’t say I was leaving,” Mo Fan sniffed.

Shen Qing raised her head and looked at Mo Fan with confusion. She did not understand what Mo Fan meant.

COMMENT

“I can’t resolve the crisis since there are too many Viscera Hunters. I won’t be able to kill them all even if I use up all my energy... however, I might be able to kill one Sea Magical Beast if I try my best. It’s better to reduce the level of the rising tide, even if it’s only by one level!” Mo Fan told Shen Qing.
