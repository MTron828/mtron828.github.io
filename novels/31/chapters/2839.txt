Chapter 2841: The Real Medusa

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Queen of the Eagle God, Yuri Ellie, let out a sharp cry. She had been hovering close to the abyss.

The Undead sank into the tomb slope. Eagle Witches with sharp claws and vicious eyes flew up from the abyss. At first, there were only a few of them, but soon, countless numbers of them appeared!

The army of Eagle Witches had arrived and was waiting for Khufu’s Undead Army.

After giving their orders, the Eagle Witches either hovered or flew down. Every time the Eagle Witches flew down, they would pick up an Undead of the Ancient Capital. Once the Eagle Witches dragged the Corpse Generals, Corpse Officials, Ghost Generals, and Ghost Officials into the air, the other Eagle Witches snatched them away. Their sharp claws tore apart the thick flesh of the Corpse Generals and Corpse Officials.

“Attack his eyes first!” Yuri Ellie hated Mo Fan so much that she ordered the Eagle Witches to charge towards him.

When the Eagle Witches circled the ground, they created a frightening storm. This storm was aimed at Mo Fan. Thousands of Eagle Witches created a formidable storm to blind Mo Fan.

“Well, it seems like you all like sacrificing yourselves.” Mo Fan smiled.

Yuri Ellie was a hot-tempered and brainless demon. ‘Did she already forget about the Black Dragon Wing?’ wondered Mo Fan.

“Fall!” Mo Fan shouted angrily and flew to the sky with the Black Dragon Wing.

When the shadow of the Black Dragon Wing plunged down, the Eagle Witches in the storm suffered. Their flexible and muscular wings could not move at all. They were frozen in mid-air and could not fly.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Eagle Witches who wanted to charge at Mo Fan all fell one by one and smashed against the white stairs. They were severely injured, and their feathers scattered in the air.

It did not matter whether they were dead or not. Once they fell to the ground, they were practically harmless. The Skeleton Soldiers could kill them easily.

Yuri Ellie was furious. Trishina was on the ground and glared at her sister as if she was an idiot. Despite the presence of Black Dragon Wing, she had sent a group of Eagle Witches! Witches could never win against the Black Dragon Wing.

“Order your daughters to kill those Corpse Generals of the White Tomb Palace,” Trishina said to Yuri Ellie.

Yuri Ellie realized that she needed to join forces with Trishina and the Sphinx if she wanted to take down Mo Fan, who had the Black Dragon Soul. Yuri Ellie changed her plan and ordered the Eagle Witches to attack and occupy the White Tomb Palace.

There were many Eagle Witches, and they occupied the sky above the White Tomb Palace. Their feathers were everywhere, and it turned everything chaotic.

The Eagle Witches had learned their lessons and did not dareapproach Mo Fan or provoke Mo Fan’s Wings of Dusk and Dawn. They bypassed Mo Fan and attacked the White Tomb Palace from the sides and the back.

“Ah!” There was a cry. It was as powerful as the last note of a powerful song.

Mo Fan turned to see Apas bent at her waist. Her face turned to the sky. Her posture made her look as agile as a dancer and like a snake at the same time.

Apas’ golden pink eyes had accumulated a kind of energy. A ray of light shot from her eyes as her long cry came to an end, forming a pattern of flowers in the sky. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The light stopped thousands of Eagle Witches. Some were flying low, some downwards, others were trying to attack the White Tomb Palace. Every one of them stopped.

Time itself seemed to have stopped at the area captured by the light. All movements had suddenly stopped, including the scattered eagle feathers. The barbs of a light eagle feather began to harden. After a while, the whole eagle feather turned to stone.

The eagle feathers fell slowly, but when Apas’ high-pitched cry echoed around the White Tomb Palace, it suddenly fell at an impossible speed. Finally, it smashed against the ground and shattered into pieces.

The insignificant eagle feather was not the only thing that had undergone such a strange change. In the sky, all the Eagle Witches who had been attacking the White Tomb Palace, and the army of Eagle Witches who stood at stand-by for orders, all became petrified like the eagle feather.

They could not fly after being petrified. The stone eagles slowly fell to the ground and shattered.

The Eagle Witch army that was raging just a moment ago were all petrified by Apas’ gaze. The eagle sculptures fell to Apas’ side and turned into gravel. That was what remained of the Eagle Witches. There was no blood.

Apas’ gaze not only petrified the skin and feathers of those Eagle Witches but also turned every part of their body into stone. Apas had killed them in the sky and their falling sculptures were tragic.

This was how the real Medusa subdued the enemy. She turned them into gravel.

Yuri Ellie was enraged. Apas had wiped out her entire Eagle Witch army.

It happened because of this poor girl she had accidentally let go off. It happened because of this girl with a human bloodline who looked the most useless among the three sisters.

Trishina and her army of scorpions on the ground were not affected. However, when she saw Apas use the stare of Queen Medusa, jealousy hit her. She felt uncomfortable, as if something pricked her whole body.

It was the Eyes of Destruction, the most powerful force of the mother of Medusa.

Once, the mother of Medusa used these eyes to kill a hundred thousand Female Demons. These eyes made her the highest-ranking Female Demon in the world, and all races of Female Demons in Europe and Africa surrendered to her!

‘How could such filthy and petty Medusa with a human bloodline inherit such imperial eyes? It was not fair. It was not fair!’

Trishina, the Queen of Scorpion, grimaced. She had fangs, a green face, snake hair, and a scorpion body.

“There is only one Medusa Queen in this world, and that’s me!” Trishina shouted.

She wanted to tear Apas apart and transplant her eyes onto her own.
