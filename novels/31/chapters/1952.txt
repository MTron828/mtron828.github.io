The Hall of Knight’s Mount Beauty Training Ground was open to members of the Parthenon Temple. As the duel kept going, more people from other halls came to watch it.

“My Heavens, I thought the Blue Star Knights were fighting another team. Why did they team up to bully two people?” a Mage of Faith who had just arrived asked.

“What bully? They are being crushed!.”

“Another one is taken out...”

“(Sigh), the Blue Star Knights are too young. The man was clearly using a Lightning Spell, yet they didn’t immediately dodge it or defend themselves with the Earth Element.”

“Do you really think ordinary Earth Spells can endure the damage of that terrifying Lightning Spell? Didn’t you see their defenses collapsing like bubbles?”

The twelvefold damage amplification of Mo Fan’s Lightning Tyrant had played an important role in the fight.

Many people were familiar with Soul-grade Seeds after reaching the Advanced Level. They knew there existed some Soul-grade Seeds that could strengthen a person’s magic up to sixfold. However, even though they were very cautious when facing Mo Fan’s Lightning Magic, their efforts were still meaningless against the Lightning Tyrant!

With its twelvefold damage amplification, even Mo Fan’s Intermediate Lightning Spells were enough to pose a huge threat to the Advanced Mages!

When Mo Fan cast an Intermediate Lightning Spell, a Blue Star Knight naively thought he could withstand it, but was instead scorched black by the Lightning Strike. Another of his opponents was taken out instantly!

The battle hadn’t started very long ago, but the Blue Star Knights had already lost ten people.

Most of the Blue Star Knights were thinking of proving themselves. The proudest ones among them had attacked Mo Fan, while the others were preserving their strength.

However, when they saw Mo Fan taking out their comrades and thinning out their numbers, they realized the young man they had challenged to a duel was much stronger than they had expected. They might actually lose if they did not fight with their full strength!

As a matter of fact, if they had not witnessed ten of their comrades being taken out right before them, they would never have thought that a young man around their age could take on their entire class of Blue Star Knights!

“Kris, piss off. You’re a disgrace to the Blue Star Knights!” Wandi cursed anxiously.

Kris’ strength was actually on par with Wandi. He had even secured the upper hand in the fight against Wandi.

Wandi was extremely annoyed. He did not want to fight Kris. His target had always been Mo Fan!

“You can’t even defeat me!” Kris scoffed back.

“How amusing, who do you think you are? Did you forget you were just a disciple of a falling clan half a year ago? Even though you joined the Parthenon Temple at the same time as us, you were just a lackey back then. Do you think you would have the right to stand in front of me and talk to me now if you weren’t lucky enough to earn the favor of a Candidate!?” Wandi snarled.

Kris’ expression darkened after hearing those words.

Kris might have been a naïve muddlehead, but his thoughts were not slow. After he was chosen to serve a Candidate, he had noticed Wandi, whom he had treated as a friend, was acting strangely toward him. He would sound envious and disdainful, and most importantly, he had forced Kris to make a choice that might affect his career.

Wandi had always been jealous of him. He envied Kris because Kris was chosen to be a probationary Guardian Knight!

Kris finally toughened up. “Wandi, stop deceiving yourself. Can’t you tell? Even if you and the others win the duel, you won’t be able to withstand a single attack from Mo Fan... You had already lost at the start of the battle. He didn’t even bother taking you out, so he asked me to deal with you instead!”

“You... shut the f**k up!” Wandi was enraged. The golden armor he was wearing began to unleash all its power. The Deathstrike Magic Equipment in his hand burst into flames again.

“You have indeed lost your mind. Did you forget that I’m a Summoner?” Kris huffed.

A Steel Griffin dove from the sky while they were talking. Its sharp claws sliced into Wandi’s chest just as he thought he could defeat Kris. Crimson blood jetted into the air.

Injuries were pretty common in a duel. The Steel Griffin had perfectly controlled its attack. If Kris was a little crueler, the Steel Griffin could have broken Wandi’s ribs with ease!

“I haven’t received any benefits and resources from the Candidate even to this day. I’ve been practicing diligently myself, yet all of you assumed I managed to come so far because of mere luck?... Wandi, you have such great talents and a good background. You also have a full set of luxurious magic Equipment, yet you can’t even defeat me! You’ve wasted all your time on trying to feel superior over others and fawning one another with others who are as narrow-minded as you are!” Kris was extremely disappointed in Wandi.

They had joined the Hall of Knights at the same time. They used to be quite close, yet their friendship had gone bad after Kris was selected as a probationary Guardian Knight. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You...What right do you have to say those words to me! Even if you’ve won, it doesn’t mean you’re stronger than me!” Wandi clutched his wounds with a resentful face.

“What about Mo Fan? Does he have the right? Would you still be standing if you were fighting thirty-nine Blue Star Knights alone?” Kris instantly rebuked him. “The truth is, you just can’t admit that other people are stronger than you. You keep telling yourself that they are stronger because of luck!”

Kris’ words stabbed Wandi in the heart.

Wandi was not retarded. He already knew Mo Fan was stronger than some Super Mages after taking out ten Blue Star Knights by himself. The Blue Star Knights were clearly no match for him.

He was around their age, yet the difference in their strength was already so huge. Even if he was struggling to admit it, the truth was right before his eyes!

“Shadow Mirage: Thousand Troops!”

The Dark Material had spread across a great area without alerting the Blue Star Knights. It was not as obvious as the Swamp of Darkness, nor was it like the Nyx Regime. Mo Fan’s Realm of Darkness had arrived like dusk. The people in the duel thought they were still in the day, but night had long arrived. Countless shadows were nurtured and strengthened while waiting to be Summoned by Mo Fan!
