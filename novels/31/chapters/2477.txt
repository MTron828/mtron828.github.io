Chapter 2478: More than One Emperor

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

“We were fighting the Totem Beasts, but it was the Totem Beasts who drove away the sea monsters.

“During that battle, the four Sacred Totem Beasts were killed. The direct descendants of the Totem Beasts were wiped out, too.

“Humans survived, but the Totem Beasts fought the Sea Gods over the course of several dozen years. Both sides suffered great casualties.

“After the war, the old Totem Beasts died off and the Sea Gods started to decline. Humanity took hold of the opportunity to grow and build our own cities. We began to have our own lands and civilization.”

Mo Fan was lost in thought.

The sea monsters had invaded their land thousands of years ago, and almost killed all their Mages.

The sea monsters were also the reason why the old Totem Beasts had died. The old Totem Beasts had fought a prolonged war with the Sea Gods, and dyed the seas red!

“The kingdom of sea monsters that is invading our coasts is led by the Sea Gods. They have recovered their strength after resting for several thousand years. They have reclaimed their thrones in the Pacific Ocean and have returned to our seas…” Hua Zhanhong went on.

Mo Fan kept wondering how the Totem Beasts had died, but he had never expected that the kingdoms of sea monsters were the culprit!

The kingdoms of the sea monsters were made up of the descendants of the ancient Sea Gods!

“The Sea Gods have reclaimed their glory after resting for a long time, but not only are the Totem Beasts unable to rise again, they are on the verge of extinction, too!” Hua Zhanhong let out a sigh.

Mo Fan was unable to calm down.

Was this the truth behind the Totem Beasts’ decline?

Humanity had declared war against the Totem Beasts after Awakening Magic. At the same time, the Sea Gods came to invade their land. Humans did not stand a chance against them. The Totem Beasts paid a great price to protect their homes!

The Sea Gods had returned once again, but the Totem Beasts were no longer around.

Mo Fan immediately thought of the Black Totem Snake.

It had worked extremely hard just to stay alive in the face of humanity’s distrust, but when the White Magic Falcons attacked Hangzhou, it had still stepped forward to protect the city. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“There are too many powerful creatures among the sea monsters. They are not afraid of our magic. Even though we have to rely on ourselves in the war against the sea monsters, we still need the Totem Beasts’ help. Only their ancient and mysterious power can defeat the sea monsters,” Hua Zhanhong admitted.

“So that’s why Shao Zheng wants me to talk to you,” Mo Fan mused.

“Exactly. I know you young ones must feel extremely lost and helpless against the waves that are destroying our coasts, but you have an important duty, too. Every ancient Totem Beast you find will increase our odds of winning the war!” Hua Zhanhong declared.

Chairman Shao Zheng kept emphasizing the importance of finding the Totem Beasts.

Mo Fan finally understood why he was so desperately looking for the Totem Beasts after hearing the truth from Chief Hua.

Their army, Mages, and Hunters did not stand a chance against the sea monsters’ invasion. They desperately needed the ancient Totem Beasts to fend off the sea monsters!

“I thought you were going to send us to the cities that are needing some help, but I’m more than willing to take the job you offered,” Mo Fan replied.

Mo Fan had close ties with the Totem Beasts. If their leaders were so keen to look for the Totem Beasts, he would do his best to find them!

“I never said you wouldn’t be going to battle,” Hua Zhanhong warned him.

Mo Fan raised his brows. He did not understand what the man was implying.

“Not every Totem Beast stays on land. The old Totem Beasts fought the Sea Gods in the Bohai Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea. Many of their descendants have moved to these places, or to nearby lands and mountains,” Hua Zhanhong told him.

“Do you have any clues?” Mo Fan’s eyes glittered.

It was difficult to find the Totem Beasts. There were no traces, no records, and no clues. It was challenging to locate them using just the notes of Jiang Shaoxu’s brother.

It was not like they had not worked hard, but they did not have any leads, even after finding Aofu’s remains!

“The Sea Skeleton King in the Magic City should have a Totem Seal,” Hua Zhanhong informed him.

“Do you mean?…” Mo Fan gasped.

Mo Fan could sense the Sea Skeleton King’s terrifying Aura just by looking at it through a recording.

“I bet it’s one of the strongest Rulers out there!” Mo Fan cursed.

“It’s up to you how you are going to acquire the Totem Seal,” Hua Zhanhong said.

“Can you handle that thing?” Mo Fan asked.

“Of course, but I have my own duty,” Hua Zhanhong said firmly.

Mo Fan was left speechless.

On second thought, a Forbidden Mage like him should indeed have important work to do…

If Mo Fan had not been accidentally caught up in this mess, he would never have thought there was a traitor among the Forbidden Mages.

A Forbidden Mage could cause massive destruction. Who knew how much damage the traitor might have caused if they had not gotten rid of him?

“Are there Emperors among the sea monsters?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes, and more than one of them,” Hua Zhanhong said.

“Oh, I will handle the Totem Beasts. You big shots just worry about the Emperors. Promise me not to let them show up in front of me,” Mo Fan said proudly.

Mo Fan had witnessed how strong an Emperor was. He believed it was far more appropriate for him to handle Ruler-level creatures instead of Emperors!

“So are you still lost?” Hua Zhanhong asked.

“Not anymore. It’s normal for people to feel helpless in a war, but once we find our places and stick to our roles, we can make significant changes too!” Mo Fan answered.

“Oh, I think you have misunderstood the main reason why I’ve spent so much time discussing these things with you today!” Hua Zhanhong raised his brows. He had a mischievous look on his face.

“I will only focus on my job,” Mo Fan said firmly.

“Just do your best to look for the Totem Beasts. Otherwise, I’ll suggest that we forcibly include you in our operations to fight the Emperors. I have yet to witness the Demon Element’s strength in person. No one knows the potential of the Demon Element better than I do,” Hua Zhanhong said with a knowing smile.

Mo Fan excused himself by saying he drank too much water.

He was not crazy enough to challenge any Emperors.

His Demon Element was only available for a limited time, but the Emperors and Forbidden Mages possessed extraordinary strength all the time. He was nothing but cannon fodder in a battle between them, even with the Demon Element!
