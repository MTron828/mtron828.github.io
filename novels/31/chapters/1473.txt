1476 Eating Wild Game

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

A long howl echoed on the snowy mountain under the starry sky. The icy blue-furred Flying Creek Snow Wolf sprinted along the edges of the mountain. He howled like an emperor declaring his dominance over the night and the snow after he reached the top!

Mo Fan hopped down from the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. He took out a small knife to clean the hare he just hunted while setting up a fire with his other hand.

The snow melted quickly under the heat of the fire. However, Mo Fan could not care less about it. He took out some seasonings and quickly sprinkled them on the hare. Its flesh soon emitted a pleasant aroma. The golden-yellow oil dripped into the fire from the half-cooked meat, whetting Mo Fan’s appetite.

“Old wolf, go catch a few more,” Mo Fan told the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf enjoyed staying on the mountain. Three thousand meters of altitude served as a boundary line. Most areas above that height were completely covered in snow, and a huge portion of the Alps was above it. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf immediately turned into a joyful husky as he sprinted freely along the beautiful white valleys, snowy hills, and spectacular peaks.

“Mu Bai, I have to say that I’m impressed; you actually brought your own seasonings!” Zhao Manyan took out a huge bottle of Sprite that he had bought before coming to the mountain. He also took out a few cups that he swiped from the school and filled them with the soft drink.

“I’ve spent a lot of time in the wild. I normally bring them along in my bag. I didn’t think they would come in handy this time...” Mu Bai explained calmly.

Mu Bai had been in the wild frequently over the years. He could not afford to eat dried jerky all the time. He would occasionally hunt some wild game and put some seasonings on them to make them more edible.

“The Alps Institute is seriously the most f**king impressive school I’ve ever been to. No mobile coverage, no Wi-Fi, no little grocery stores, there is nothing but mountain springs and vegetable soup. I’m about to starve to death!” Zhao Manyan cursed.

“I seriously don’t know why they are so proud of themselves, like they are living in a sacred land. It’s no different than staying in prison,” Mo Fan grumbled in agreement.

“I’m seriously going to lose my mind if I stay here for a month. By the way, we must teach those two b**ches a lesson. They seriously think they can just bully us as they please!” Zhao Manyan said.

“I find them to be an eyesore, too. By the way, why did you end up in a fight with Heidi after going into the cave?” Mu Bai snapped the hare’s leg off and munched it.

“She wasn’t wearing any clothes. I saw it all. Speaking of which, her body is really hot. I thought she was a statue at first...” Mo Fan said.

“Holy crap, why do you always get to enjoy the good things? If I knew there would be such an open-minded woman in there, I would have gone too! I don’t think the waterfall is going to stop me,” Zhao Manyan was anxious. He regretted not taking the challenge.

Heidi was very attractive; she had a tall nose, sapphire-blue eyes, small and fleshy lips, and with her curly ash-brown hair, it was not exaggerating to call her an angel. Zhao Manyan was already drooling when he heard Mo Fan had seen the girl naked...

“Let’s discuss the other two first,” Mu Bai said.

“Right, Sheryl and Edith, those cunning b**ches... I swear I’m going to make them kneel down and sing ‘Conquer’! Did you see the food they gave us? It’s no different than pig feed! Only Shi Junsheng kept saying it was delicious. I don’t understand, is that guy a dog? Why is he still fawning upon them after how they treated us? He would surely be a traitor if he was born in the ancient times!” Zhao Manyan swore.

Sheryl and Edith clearly knew Heidi always trained in the cave, yet they did not say a single word about it. Mo Fan was injured because of it, and his wounds were still hurting.

Mo Fan was a vengeful person. He would not forgive them, even if they were women!

Trying to set him up? Hmph, the last person that tried to do so was a Red Cardinal called the Cold Prince, but he was now counting down the days he could live in the VIP room of the Holy Judgment Court prepared for the criminals that were sentenced to death. How dare those two girls whose hair was not fully grown yet get them into trouble!? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Mu Bai, I know you’ve brought a lot of things; did you bring any knockout drops?” Zhao Manyan asked.

Mu Bai’s eyes widened. He said angrily, “Who do you think I am? Why would I have something like that!?”

“I saw a pharmacy when I was taking a stroll back then. I don’t know how to mix the drug. Do any of you know how to do that?” Mo Fan asked.

“I know how to do it... but isn’t that a little excessive?” Mu Bai whispered.

“What excessive? They were treating us like dogs from the countryside the moment we set foot into their school! The look in their eyes and their tones, as if they are the only clean and sacred people in the world, and everyone else is nothing but trash... I will not tolerate it, even if you can,” Zhao Manyan said angrily.

Zhao Manyan loved women, especially the pretty ones with alluring figures, but it did not necessarily mean he liked these self-important b**ches who kept looking down at them!

They were going to be here for a month. If they did not teach those two girls a lesson, the girls might bully them again!

“Knockout drops are crossing the line. Let’s wait for another chance, we must teach them a lesson,” Mo Fan shook his head. He agreed that it was a little immoral.

“I didn’t say we were going to do anything to them. We just need to put some fake blood on their bedsheets to scare the shit out of them,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Forget it, we shouldn’t be that fussed with those two women,” Mu Bai said.

Zhao Manyan did not know how to mix drugs. Meanwhile, there was not even a grocery store within a few dozen kilometers, let alone a drug store. He had no choice but to give up on the thought and focus on enjoying the delicious meat of a wild hare.

A long and piercing siren suddenly went off on the snowy mountain. Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai were munching the delicious meat to cleanse away the disgusting food they had for dinner when they noticed a dozen pairs of milky-white wings surrounding them.

A bunch of Magas in white uniforms landed before them. One of them with thick brows came forward and frowned when she saw the grilled wild hare.

“We received a report that someone is endangering little creatures on the mountain. I believe you were told not to harm any living creatures on the Alps when you set foot in here. You three will come with me; the disciplinary teachers will punish you accordingly,” the Maga ordered, very displeased.

Zhao Manyan exploded in rage. He pointed at the Maga and grunted, “F**k me, we’re just hunting some wild game for food; are you being serious now? Do you really think the whole mountain is yours!? It’s not like we are eating in the school!”

“Take your hand back. Otherwise, I’m going to assume you’re resisting arrest. We won’t be going easy on you!” the Maga said coldly.

“Just bring it on! If any of you can touch a single strand of my hair, I’m willing to be called your grandson!” Zhao Manyan yelled. He had had enough of this.

“Old Zhao, Old Zhao, let’s calm down...” Mo Fan quickly advised. He smiled at the Maga and said, “We’ll go back ourselves. There’s no need to complicate things further.”

“We won’t make things difficult for you if you’re willing to cooperate,” the Maga said.
