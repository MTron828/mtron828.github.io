Chapter 2796: Eye Parasite

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Red Cardinal, Jiu Ying, was on the verge of death. He fell to his knees, and blood gushed out even more.

Blood was oozing from his pores. His blood was not the typical red color. There was a strange green tinge to his blood, like something remnant of chemical tests for pharmaceutical drugs!

Jiu Ying’s body tightened and shrank. He bled all over the ground, and he fell in his own puddle of blood. His body emitted an unpleasant odor…

Mo Fan found it very strange and asked Apas about it. But Apas’ golden eyes registered only confusion. Mo Fan noticed something in her pupils when he looked at her.

It looked like a demonic bug kept inside a crystal ball. It was alive. It was scurrying to hide as though it did not want to draw attention to itself. It hid in the depths of her eyes. Mo Fan was caught by surprise. Apas almost closed her eyes.

“Don’t close your eyes! There’s something in them!” yelled Mo Fan. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Apas panicked. She had not recovered from her previous shock. But she trusted Mo Fan. She opened her eyes wide. She was scared but determined.

“I don’t know what that is. But it’s not good. Do you have a way to get rid of it?” Mo Fan was anxious.

“What do you think?!” Apas retorted.

Mo Fan sighed. He could not think of a way to solve the problem at hand.

“There’s something more terrifying than the mastermind. I saw its back. It almost trapped my mind there. I would have died if I hadn’t escaped fast,” Apas said, still shaken from the encounter.

Mo Fan did not understand what exactly had happened. ‘Wasn’t Apas searching through Jiu Ying’s memory? How did she run into a terrifying silhouette and nearly lose her life?’

“It could be some sort of curse or a supreme demonic spell. Its demonic body can draw all living things that look at it into its mental trap. Luckily, I only saw its back. If I had looked into its eyes, my mind could have been trapped inside there forever…” said Apas.

......

“What will happen to you if your mind is trapped like that?” Mo Fan asked.

“I’ll go into a coma,” said Apas.

‘How could there be such a bizarre demonic power? How could one’s soul be sucked away the moment they saw someone else’s back through other people’s memory?’ thought Mo Fan.

Apas was a Medusa. She was the young Medusa Queen with relatively pure blood of her species. People usually died when they looked into her eyes instead of the other way around.

“Is it related to the Ocean Godly Horde?” asked Mo Fan.

“Yes. It has a strong mental connection with the Godly Horde Prophets. Their connection is strange but stronger than the connection you have with your Contracted Beast.” Apas calmed down and recalled what she had seen.

Jiu Ying had used his manipulation ability that was similar to the Godly Horde Prophet. Meanwhile, Apas had noticed another living thing that had a strong mental connection with Jiu Ying…

‘Could it be that the Godly Horde Prophets were not the actual commander of the Ocean Demons, but they were just one of the pawns whose minds had been manipulated just like the other Ocean Demons?’ reasoned Mo Fan. ‘What was the creature Apas had seen? What was that bizarre thing in her eyes?’

Mo Fan was certain he had seen something. It wasn’t just his imagination. ‘Could it be some sort of Mental Parasite?’

Jiu Ying was dead. When Apas searched his mind, the Mental Parasite hidden in his eyeballs had taken advantage of the opportunity and burrowed into her eyes.

If that was the case…

Mo Fan was deep in thought when he felt something buzz in his mind. It felt as though he had hit his head on a wall. The pain was excruciating. It felt as if his skull would crack open.

“Apas!” Mo Fan cried as he held his head. Apas held him up. She had sensed something strange when she had looked into his eyes.

“Sh*t! Something is attacking you through our Contracted Mind connection!” Apas cried out.

“Quick… Figure something out! It hurts!” Mo Fan was in so much pain that he found it hard to speak.

It had to be the mental parasite. It had failed to control Apas, so it took advantage of the psychic connection that they both shared.

“Hold on, I’ll dig it out!” said Apas.

When the Mental Parasite hid itself, it was difficult to find but once it attacked, it was easy for her to get its location.

It appeared that the parasite was the same as the one that had shown up in Apas’ eyes. It attempted to kill Mo Fan using Apas’ Medusa gaze. Apas could die if Mo Fan was killed because of their Contracted Soul connection.

The Mental Parasite was wicked! If they didn’t kill it, both would be dead.

This was Mo Fan’s first time facing such a terrifying and demonic mental attack. He summoned his Black Dragon Helmet.

The Black Dragon’s deterrent power was strong. Mo Fan’s mental power was strengthened and almost reached the Ninth Realm. He felt better.

The Mental Parasite was not intimidated. But when it realized that it only encountered a wall so strong as if made of bricks, it tried to retreat. But Apas’ murderous intent was clear.

The Mental Parasite was, after all, a parasite. The moment Apas located it, it was destined to die. Mo Fan and Apas worked together to stop it and killed the strange Mental Parasite in between the Mental Bridge.

Mo Fan regained his senses. The pain was gone but his body was drenched in cold sweat. Apas breathed out a sigh of relief.

She thought she had escaped from the mysterious figure that had almost captured her soul. But the Mental Parasite had turned out to be the real culprit.

It was only then that Apas felt that she had truly broken herself free of that evil demonic shadow.
