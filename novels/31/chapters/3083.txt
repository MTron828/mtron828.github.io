3084 One Less Monster

Regardless of whether it was the Reflective Holy City or the Holy City on earth, everyone fell into dead silence.

The tanned Penal Angel Fahl represented the Holy Shadow. Although she hardly showed up before the world and was more inclined toward handling dark execution affairs, she represented the ruling class of Holy City.

Her death undoubtedly had a huge impact on Holy City!

Ramiel retrieved his angelic birth soul. His lips turned pale.

The Frost of Alternate Space had burned his angelic birth soul. Although his angelic birth soul was temporarily attached to Fahl, he, too, was affected by it. His lips turned pale, and he trembled in the cold. Frostbite cracks slowly appeared on his skin…

Ramiel was shocked to see the changes in his body. The Frost of Alternate Space was like an infectious disease. Even though he was slightly infected, the Frost of Alternate Space could suffocate a living being to that extent. If he did not find a way to stop it, his life would be threatened too.

The arrow was made up of many doses of Frost of Alternate Space. It could even strip the life force of an immortal and indestructible thousand-year-old national beast!

Crushing space and using Frost of Alternate Space as arrow material was something beyond the scope of the existing power in the world. It was no surprise that Mu Ningxue had the courage to barge into the huge Holy City on her own.

Holy City and the Forbidden Curse Alliance were the ones who forced Mu Ningxue into a desperate situation. The purpose of doing so was so that they could get rid of the potential threat as early as possible.

Who would have thought Mu Ningxue was so tough? Entering the forbidden land in Eternal Night was no different from entering a realm with little or no hope. However, Mu Ningxue fully demonstrated her talent, ability, and survival instinct in such an environment. She had completely transformed during a desperate situation.

No one could survive in the Eternal Night at Extreme South, but she did. This showed that she had transcended the human extreme realm and mastered the power to surpass space in the era.

Even the fourteen-winged Blazing Angel was no match for Mu Ningxue. Although Fahl’s power was upgraded because of Ramiel’s birth soul, the archangel’s level of strength was no more than that only.

“Ramiel, pay attention to her breathing.” Just then, he heard Michael’s voice.

Initially, Ramiel did not understand what Michael was trying to say. It was only after Ramiel paid close attention to Mu Ningxue for several seconds that he noticed one detail.

Mu Ningxue’s hand trembled slightly.

Her breathing was not as calm as before.

As a mage in possession of the Natural Soul Seed as well as an Ice Element disaster maker, snow from the Alps Mountain gushed at the city endlessly. Even the ice elements from hundreds of kilometers away obeyed the queen’s call and gathered together like clouds to come to her.

At that moment, Mu Ningxue’s breath weakened.

The aggressive cold invaded more than half of the city. She stood motionlessly in place for a very long time. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“She’s recovering.” Ramiel noticed an inkling.

“She can’t use her magic bow for a short period of time. She exhausted ample of her spiritual essence when she shot Fahl with the arrow. Unless she doesn’t care about her own life, she can’t cast the same powerful arrow again.” Michael looked calm. He was somewhat indifferent toward Fahl’s death.

The Holy Shadow was the dark side of Holy City. They did things from the shadows. The birth of the Holy Shadow was to sacrifice for Holy City from the beginning.

In Michael’s opinion, without Fahl, they would not find out Mu Ningxue’s true power. Mu Ningxue was very good at hiding her true self, her level of cultivation, her mastery of the Ice Crystal Bow, and the Extreme Dust from the Eternal Night at Extreme South Land.

Most of the disaster victims found it hard to suppress their majestic ability that surpasses the law of nature. They tended to die young. They could easily expose themselves and do something that led to self-destruction if they had not truly mastered the ability.

But Mu Ningxue hid her ability very well. She was also very clever. She knew the disaster victims would either end up self-destructing or be executed by Holy City long ago. Before she was strong enough to fight with Holy City, she would not expose her talent. She even escaped into the Extreme South Land to avoid Holy City and bought more time for herself.

Before she entered the Extreme South, she could have easily been killed by Holy City. Today, she killed Chief Holy Shadow Fahl.

“Got it. We’ll do everything we can to kill her!” Ramiel nodded.

Mu Ningxue was too powerful.

She was likened to the ancient emperor-level creatures in the Eternal Night at the Extreme South. If she stayed longer in the Extreme South or snow world, Holy City might not be able to take her down even if it meant sending an army to fight her.

However, Holy City’s greatest advantage was that Mu Ningxue was in their territory.

The snow world in the Alps Mountain was the greatest disaster that Mu Ningxue could summon. She had exhausted ample energy when she shot the arrow. Meanwhile, if Holy City could eliminate the greatest threat by sacrificing one Chief Holy Shadow, then the victory was still theirs.

“Indeed, it is the wisest choice to hang you up here and let your soul be slowly sucked away, and also help to lure the demoness out to us.” Michael revealed a cocky smile on his pale face.

It was clear to see that he was happy from the bottom of his heart.

Michael devoted his life to fighting against all the monsters in the world.

One less monster meant that there would be more peace.

After all, both Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue topped his list.

Michael was never afraid to fight a war. He did not mind sacrifices. What he feared most was the existence of people like Zhan Kong, Qin Yu’Er, Mo Fan, and Mu Ningxue that went unnoticed.

Seeing that Mo Fan kept quiet, Michael started the conversation. It was clear to see from his eyes that he could not quite contain his excitement.

“Are you sick?!” asked Mo Fan.

“Sick?” Michael grinned and said strangely, “All of us are sick. Didn’t you realize that anything that surpasses the Forbidden Curse life force is considered a virus to the world?”

Mo Fan paid attention to Ramiel’s position. During his time in Holy City, Mo Fan realized that it was not Archangel Michael that made Holy City so powerful. It was the combination of both Michael and Ramiel, with Michael as the supreme leader that made the city so powerful.

There were other archangels in Holy City. Aside from Sharjah whose rights had been stripped, they still had Archangel Rafael and Archangel Uri.

However, Archangel Michael was the one who had control over the huge governance in Holy City.

Archangel Michael was the earliest person to return to Holy City. He had been re-elected from the last angel election until today. He was in charge of the Holy Shadow, clergymen, the Heresy Judgment, the Guardians of Holy City, the rankings of the angels…
