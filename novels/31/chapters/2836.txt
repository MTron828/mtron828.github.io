Chapter 2838: The Corpse King

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the Dark Abyss…

Ghosts covered the White Tomb Palace like moving clouds. They also resembled a huge hurricane above the palace.

Blood rain fell from the sky. There were endless Undead remains. Even though the remains had turned into powder form and mixed with the blood water, they put themselves together like piles of clay. Like a child who had no sense of artistry, the remains simply put themselves together. Their limbs and chest bones faced inside while their hearts, spleens, and stomachs faced outside.

The bizarre Undead did not belong to Khufu’s army. They were the Corpse King’s subordinates. The Corpse King’s small fries continued to put the crippled Undead together into one piece to fend off the solid Mummies.

The Skeleton Army piled up into mountains. They provided a layer of protection made of bones and shells for the White Tomb Palace to prevent the monster with a cow’s body and human’s head from destroying the precious palace. The monster was covered in gold and had already made its way under the White Tomb Palace’s extensive white stairs.

It ruthlessly banged against the stairs with its body. The white stairs cracked, and the cracks spanned all the way to the middle.

Moo!

The Bronze, Silver, and Gold Bull Monsters became the main force in trying to collapse the Undead guardian army of the White Tomb Palace. The strong tremors caused the land beneath the White Tomb Palace to crack.

“Divine Flame—Phoenix Nirvana!”

A figure, ablaze in flames, stood on the White Tomb Palace’s stairs. The flames on his body sprang like a flaming mountain peak.

Wings of flames appeared on top of the mountain. The sight was terrifyingly beautiful. It was like the awakening of the mythical Phoenix Mountain from its deep slumber, and it looked down furiously at the creatures below.

Mo Fan’s arrival was like the descent of divine fire. The blood rain vaporized into red gas. The sky turned blood red. The fire blades arched across the sky like thunderstorms, creating terrifying light in the sky. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Phoenix Nirvana was ablaze with unprecedented destructive flames. Then it swooped down from the mountain peak.

Although the length of the Phoenix Nirvana’s wings were only fifty meters, its flames spanned up to two kilometers when it spread its wings and brushed past the stairs. As the Phoenix Nirvana approached the Bull Monster’s territory, it brushed past them and killed the Bronze and Silver Bull Monsters!

The Phoenix Nirvana could produce flames that spanned up to a kilometer from each wing. The Phoenix Nirvana’s greatest strength was the ability to produce exaggerated and terrifying flames. Even though the Bull Monsters were not reduced to ashes, the area where the Phoenix Nirvana had brushed past had turned into a sea of flames. Even if some of the Bull Monsters did not die on the spot, they suffered excruciating burns, and their suffering was more painful than those that died on the spot. Not many of them could escape the powerful fire divine power!

The flames illuminated the sky. The Gold Bull Monster remained standing under the stairs. Its golden skin was distorted slightly by the flames. Its face filled with rage. It radiated a terrifying dark aura, and it targeted the human with divine flame power.

Moo!

The Gold Bull Monster roared. It fixed its gaze on Mo Fan begrudgingly. The Bull Monster’s stare contained a strange mental spell. When Mo Fan met its gaze, a strong sense of fury sprouted from his chest suddenly. It made him feel as if he had to kill the Bull Monster, no matter the cost.

‘Was the stare provocative?’ Mo Fan quickly summoned his dragon sense.

When Mo Fan summoned his dragon sense, he was covered by a cloud of black substance. The black substance gradually expanded as the flame faded. It expanded and turned into a dragon.

One of the dragon’s favorite foods was bull-type creatures.There were various bull-type magical creatures in Western countries. Their flesh was juicy and tasty. Their primal fear of the dragon came from within their bones, much like chickens’ fear of the eagle hovering in the sky.

The arrogant and provocative Gold Bull Monster trembled and almost fell to its knees at Mo Fan’s transformation.

The Corpse King took advantage of the opportunity and flew out of the White Tomb Palace. It aimed at the Gold Bull Monster’s neck with its lance and slashed it. The Gold Bull Monster’s head fell from its neck. Gold splashed all over the ground. Its heavy head smashed on the white stairs. Some of the stairs cracked.

Mountain Zombie was enormous, and the Corpse King was different from it. The Corpse King was entirely in the human form. It wore ancient martial arts robes and wielded a lance. It had killed many Undead with its lance. The tip of its lance was bone white color, and razor-sharp.

To Mo Fan, the Corpse King looked more like an Undead. It was agile, powerful, and intelligent.

Mo Fan had never encountered the Corpse King before. The Corpse King turned its head around and looked at Mo Fan. He must have learned about Mo Fan from the Queen of Nine Serenities. It paid obeisance to Mo Fan for killing the troublesome Gold Bull Monster. It paid its respect to Mo Fan solemnly.

This was Mo Fan’s first time encountering such a polite Undead spirit. For a moment, he did not know how to respond to it, and he scratched his head awkwardly.

“Uh… It’s you! Give me back my eyeball! Return my eyeball!” A harsh female voice cried out from a nearby cliff.

Mo Fan found the voice familiar. When he turned to the direction of the sound, he saw a witch in eagle form fly up from the cliff. It charged at Mo Fan furiously.

Mo Fan was certain that he had never seen the witch before. A black eye patch covered one of her eyes. She bared her fangs. She looked hideous and frightening. She looked like she had run into her nemesis finally! Gray feather nails poured down densely like rain.There was nowhere Mo Fan could hide.

Just then, several Iron Corpses lunged at Mo Fan and shielded him from the feather nails. Unfortunately, the Eagle Witch grabbed them and flew to the sky, then tore the Iron Corpses apart!

Mo Fan felt sorry for the Iron Corpses. On second thought, the Iron Corpses were brainless and had no consciousness. He needn’t have felt burdened.

Meanwhile, he tried to recall if he had seen the eagle Witch before.

“My eyeball! My eyeball! Give me back my eyeball!”

The Eagle Witch’s high-pitched voice formed layers of sound waves and struck the ground.
