3028 The Birth of The Goddess

Was this really the case? Was there another ambitious self that existed in the blank spots of her memory?

It was true that the memory about the Black Vatican had flashed in her mind. She remembered some parts of it but…

‘What about the Supreme Pontiff, the Supreme Pontiff’s coat of arms, and the Supreme Pontiff’s ring?’ wondered Ye Xinxia.

Those memories had indeed appeared in Ye Xinxia’s memories before, but was that person truly herself?

!!

“This was what Wen Tai was concerned about the most. He was worried that once you possess the Divine Soul, you will be more inclined toward the Black Vatican. This will mean that the world he put in great effort to protect would fall into the abyss of eternal destruction,” said Izisha.

“Why are you telling me all this only now? You could have told me from the beginning,” said Ye Xinxia.

“Are you aware that your father has expectations of you?” refuted Izisha.

“Expectations?”

“For thousands of years, only the Goddess could possess the Soul of Parthenon Temple. The moment you were born, the Divine Soul resided in your soul like a loyal slave. The Divine Soul is the Soul of Parthenon Temple. The previous Goddesses, saintesses, and the Great Mages, including myself, gave everything we could just to get a little favor from the Divine Soul. We don’t even mind becoming its slave.” Izisha stared at Ye Xinxia.

Izisha had no intention of concealing her jealousy for Ye Xinxia. “Although Wen Tai was highly reputable and the Greeks elected him as the divine person or Holy Son of Parthenon Temple, he was not acknowledged by the Divine Soul. He was a Holy Son without the Divine Soul. But you, you’re his daughter. Ever since you were born, you have possessed the Divine Soul.”

“The more one aspires to walk in the light, the more rooted one becomes in darkness. These were the last words he spoke to me on this earth. He chose darkness and became rooted in the rotten, filthy, and foul-smelling mud. And you are his only hope in the middle of darkness. He expects you to be God’s Chosen Daughter who could bloom radiantly in the light. He expects you to be a pure pistil uncontaminated by mud, dirty water, or stale miasma.”

Ye Xinxia looked at Izisha. Even though she could not trust Izisha as a person, her words made sense. She could not bring herself to doubt them.

She remembered that no matter where she was, she would always find herself curled up in Wen Tai’s arms. She recalled him talking to her gently and stroking her hair. Words that she could not understand at the time.

The burden from the Divine Soul exhausted Xinxia ever since she was young. Hence, she easily fell asleep. When those childhood memories flooded Ye Xinxia’s mind, she remembered she had, most of the time, fallen asleep and woken up in Wen Tai’s arms.

Those memories were so indelible that she wondered why she had forgotten them in the first place.

She felt as if she had been under an “Obliviate” spell whereby someone had forcefully erased everything about her father from her memory, especially after knowing that she could start remembering things at that age.

The more he aspired to walk in the light, the more rooted he was in the darkness. Wen Tai chose to stay in darkness and gave the light to her. This was his expectation.

“But even a wise man is not infallible. Wen Tai foresaw future catastrophe, so he dealt with the present crisis in order to pave the way for a brighter future. Unfortunately, he could do nothing to help that one person.” Izisha looked up into the sky and stared at the Daughter of the Fire Soul standing on the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan’s shoulder.

Wen Tai chose the dark hell.

He foresaw the turmoil in the Dark Plane. Regardless of how he protected the light of the world with care, he could never change one thing. Once the Dark Plane was torn apart, it could destroy and trample the fragile human world with ease!

The only way was to make himself fall into darkness and become the Dark King.

He sacrificed himself in exchange for a thousand years of freedom from the darkness for this world. However, one woman refused to let the world continue to exist. She was hellbent on destroying the world that Wen Tai had given everything to protect.

And that woman was Salan.

“Perhaps you think that Salan is here for revenge. She’s avenging Wen Tai. But she wants to destroy what Wen Tai wants to protect. She wants to trample Wen Tai’s expectations!”

“Wen Tai wants to protect the world, but she destroys it. Wen Tai hoped you can be the purest God’s Chosen Daughter, but Salan turns you into the most depraved person in the world, the Supreme Pontiff!”

It was unthinkable for the Black Vatican’s Supreme Pontiff to become the Goddess of Parthenon Temple.

And it fits perfectly with Salan’s madness!

…

“My lady, the barrier is about to be shattered,” said the Lord of the Hall of Knights, Haylon, with great urgency.

“Haylon, did my father say anything to you before he…?” asked Ye Xinxia.

Haylon was one of the earliest leaders who pledged his loyalty to Parthenon Temple. Ye Xinxia was aware that the reason he supported her was mostly because of Wen Tai.

“I…” The Lord of the Hall of Knights glanced at Izisha.

Izisha said calmly, “I already told her everything.”

The Lord of the Hall of Knights sucked in a deep breath and sighed. “Regardless of who you are, I swear to follow you to death.”

“Haylon, have you forgotten Wen Tai’s orders? She is not who you are supposed to be assisting. Her soul is no longer pure. She is the Supreme Pontiff. She has been polluted by Salan. She doesn’t deserve to be the Goddess!” Izisha said in agitation. ‘Idiot!’

Ye Xinxia had revived the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan. This showed that she had fallen from grace.

The battle was not a feud between Izisha and Salan. It was also not a battle between the Black Vatican and Parthenon Temple. It was a showdown between Wen Tai and Salan.

Wen Tai had lost the battle because his daughter had become the Supreme Pontiff!

Ye Xinxia was the Supreme Pontiff. Wen Tai’s former subordinates of Parthenon Temple had to do all they could to stop her from becoming the Goddess!

“You are resurrected from the dead with the power of darkness. The Blessing of the Goddess would turn you into a pool of dark water. Given the situation, you still compete with me. Is it because you’re afraid?” Ye Xinxia questioned Izisha.

Ye Xinxia’s Healing Magic had worsened Izisha’s wound. Izisha was resurrected from the dead by the Dark King. She belonged to the dark. It would be a punishment for her once the Blessing of the Goddess fell on her.

It was impossible for Izisha to become the Goddess.

The only purpose of her participating in the campaign was to stop the Supreme Pontiff from becoming the Parthenon Temple Goddess.

“This is the true purpose of my resurrection. I can’t let the Black Vatican have the world. This is also Wen Tai’s will!” said Izisha, with much emphasis.

Izisha knew the truth the moment the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was resurrected from the dead.

Ye Xinxia could not be the Goddess. She was the Supreme Pontiff! Therefore, whatever Ye Xinxia did, everything seemed pretentious to Izisha.

However, Izisha was unaware that Ye Xinxia had no idea she was the Supreme Pontiff herself.

If Ye Xinxia’s true conscience remained in her heart, she should know it would be wise to withdraw from the Goddess election before the soul of the Supreme Pontiff was awakened.

“Izisha, you said you trust my current self,” said Ye Xinxia. “I won’t give up the Goddess throne. I have no other choice.” Ye Xinxia radiated an imposing soul energy.

Her soul energy glowed in extraordinary light. It was as tall as a divine statue that reached the sky. The divine statue was graceful and majestic. It had a razor-sharp gaze that could see through everyone’s soul.

“I-It’s the Divine Soul!”

Athenians panicked. Meanwhile, Parthenon Mages who were in the middle of the battle, Izisha, and Haylon were transfixed as they watched the appearance of the Divine Soul.

“No! You can’t do that!” Izisha screamed.

The Divine Soul’s divine Healing Light covered the land. It healed the army with its Healing Light. At that moment, its Healing Light fell on Izisha…

Izisha was resurrected from the dark. She could not be healed with the light. In fact, the Healing Light would only melt her away… ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The divine light fell on Izisha. She had many bodyguards around her. Her bodyguards could have stopped Ye Xinxia, but they did not think anything was wrong with Ye Xinxia trying to heal Izisha.

The bodyguards assumed the two saintesses had joined forces. Izisha was hurt in the battle, so they thought Ye Xinxia was healing her.

However, only Izisha knew that Ye Xinxia wanted to make her disappear from the world!

Her Divine Soul was too powerful. As a result, Ye Xinxia’s Healing Light turned into a killing light beam and destroyed Izisha. Izisha’s body was gradually pierced by the light. She suffered great pain. Her eyes were filled with resentment.

The people could not quite believe what they saw.

‘Why was Izisha not healed by the Healing Light?’

She belonged to the darkness. She was a corrupted resurrectionist! Indeed, the rumor was true.

Izisha was not a true resurrectionist. She was no different from the filthy and lowly Undead! How could this type of person become the Goddess?!

The divine Healing Light was powerful, but it had been used as a weapon to kill Izisha. As her body was in the process of being reduced to ashes, her face was filled with resentment and remorse. Before she died, her hysterical laughter was heard as the Healing Light pierced her throat.

She laughed at herself herself for being so stupid. She fell for Ye Xinxia’s innocent look, just like others. She trusted Ye Xinxia’s seemingly pure heart. She actually trusted Ye Xinxia’s words when she said she was under the “Obliviate” spell.

In fact, Ye Xinxia remembered everything. She remembered her true identity.

But what else could Izisha do? Izisha could not take down Ye Xinxia, much less the terrifying Salan. She had lost.

The moment the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was resurrected from the dead, and the moment Salan surrounded Athens, Izisha had already lost. The Hall Mother expected Athenians to make the final decision, but they did not want to take the risk. They had to have complete victory. Therefore, the election result was not important.

What happened was that Parthenon Temple, Greece, and Athens had fallen into Salan’s hands. She would be the one to decide their life or death.

Wen Tai was also defeated. He had taken great pains in protecting the world. He had placed endless hopes on his daughter…

But all this deviated from what he wanted for them.

Under the crowd’s gaze, Izisha melted away under Ye Xinxia’s Divine Soul’s Healing Light. All that was left behind was Izisha’s clothes and a pool of black water.

Parthenon Temple’s Adjudicators could not quite believe the truth.

“Haylon, take over the Hall of Judgment and have the Adjudicators form a mountain of walls. We must not let the Twin Tyrant Titans take another step forward,” said Ye Xinxia to Haylon.

“Noted, my lady.” Haylon placed his fist on his chest. He did not question Ye Xinxia’s decision.

He should not doubt her either. Regardless of what she represented, Haylon had pledged his loyalty for her. Too much questioning would only disrupt Parthenon Temple’s final order.

Moreover, did Izisha not even have the slightest ulterior motives? Based on what she said, was it true that she did everything according to Wen Tai’s will?

Regardless, Haylon only had one choice. He would follow Ye Xinxia’s footsteps.

…

The flowers turned into a sea of fire and filled the city.

The crowd looked everywhere for refuge. The terrifying heat waves struck them. Some fainted on the streets. Their lips were cracked, and their eyes were filled with helplessness.

Meanwhile, the merciless Salan stood on the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan’s shoulder. She looked down at the city and instigated the Ancient God Apollo to head to areas where most people were gathered.

The Ancient God Apollo possessed the Golden Ring of the Sun. The Ring of the Sun made its body indestructible. Parthenon Temple’s knight formed a magic barrier that resembled long, blood spears. The spears were shot ruthlessly at the Ancient God Apollo.

However, the Ancient God Apollo remained motionless. As a result, the knights were frustrated. Just then, the Ancient God Apollo caught one of the Golden Sun Knights and its flying dragon.

The flying dragon’s tail and one of the Golden Sun Knights’ legs was exposed. The Ancient God Apollo squeezed them in its hand. Blood spilled from its fingers. It looked as if the Ancient God Apollo was holding a rotten tomato!

The knight was a Knight of the Seal! He was one of the best of the Golden Sun Knights. Even so, he could not escape the tragic fate!

“Kill them,” said Salan coldly to the Ancient God Apollo as she looked down at the T-junction Street.

The Ancient God Apollo ignored the blood spears aiming at him from every direction. It charged and crashed the weak Temple’s Protection. The next moment, the Temple’s Protection was shattered into colorful pieces. The shattered pieces in midair transformed into countless Four-colored Sparrowhawks. They were bleeding and broken. They were heavily wounded.

The Temple’s Protection Barrier neutralized itself. The enormous multicolored barrier that shattered into countless Sparrowhawks, gathered together, despite their injuries, to charge at the Ancient God Apollo!

There were countless Four-colored Sparrowhawks. The sky above the city was filled with Four-colored Sparrowhawks. They were the elves that protected Athens. They charged fearlessly at the mighty Ancient God Apollo!

Ye Xinxia on the eaves of the tower on top of the church. She glowed in four colors. She was the one who cast the spell of Temple’s Protection. She fought with the Ancient God Apollo alone.

The Four-colored Sparrowhawks were not powerful creatures. Regardless of how strong their will was or how numerous their numbers, their efforts were in vain. When they reached the Ancient God Apollo, they became like feathers that melted away. The Four-colored Sparrowhawks were burned in midair within a few seconds, like the firecrackers that faded immediately after they were ignited.

Ye Xinxia glowed in Divine Soul light, but she had not received the Blessing of the Goddess. Hence, her Divine Soul could not bring out the true Parthenon Temple power.

Her magic was still weak. She could only temporarily stop the Ancient God Apollo.

“The saintess is protecting us. But she can’t do it for long.”

The people on the T-junction Street, buildings, and balconies saw Ye Xinxia. They also saw many Four-colored Sparrowhawks charging at the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan like moths around a big flame.

On the election altar, Hall Mother, Pamise, and Old Priest, Falmer, fixed their gazes on Ye Xinxia. Ye Xinxia had no more competitors. She was the Goddess of Parthenon Temple.

Today’s disaster would be her first challenge after succeeding to the Goddess throne.

“I summon the true Soul of Parthenon Temple in the name of Goddess. Only my Divine Soul can protect Athens!” Ye Xinxia’s Psychic Voice rang out in everyone’s mind.

“Old Priest, Falmer, please take the oath and inscribe my name on the divine tablet!

“Hall Mother, please pray for me.”

Her words sounded in everyone’s mind. She neither solicited nor requested for it. Instead, she declared the results with solemnity.

Only the Goddess could protect Athens. It was a coronation in the middle of danger. Everything seemed to be predestined.

On top of that, she was a Goddess who did not require the Blessing of the Divine Soul. She had her Divine Soul for the rest of her life. Her Divine Soul had acknowledged her. All she needed was the Hall Mother and Athenians’ acknowledgement.

The prayers were in the hands of Hall Mother alone. Hall Mother had to awaken the sleeping, Divine Soul.

Parthenon Temple needed a name, and the name had to be a symbol of supremacy.

Ye Xinxia was dressed in white. She was the only one dressed in pure white color.

God’s Chosen Daughter appeared in the middle of a sea of blazing Mad Poppies and the crowd in black. Even the independent Golden Sun Tyrant Titan felt a sense of fear that came from within its bones when it saw her. It subconsciously wanted to retreat.

She was pure, solemn, and holy!

When the crowd saw the true Divine Soul appear before Goddess Ye Xinxia, they were no longer fearful. They knew the Goddess would save them. They willingly worshiped her as their Goddess without any complaints.

“Izisha was not acknowledged by the Divine Soul even after being the Goddess for so many years. Even if Izisha becomes the Goddess, she can’t protect Athens!”

“We saw her melted away under the Healing Light. She came from the dark and had already fallen. She was the one who cast evil resurrection spells to awaken the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan!” An Asian woman shouted on the T-junction Street.

“Ye Xinxia is the true Goddess!”

“She’s God’s Chosen Daughter!”

“Let’s pray!”

Everyone began to pray once more.

They did not beg for mercy from a god of vanity. They prayed with devotion to a person with true divine nature and sought protection in the middle of the chaos!

…

The sky was filled with Four-colored Sparrowhawks. They turned into fireballs for defense.

Ye Xinxia’s white dress swayed in the middle of the strong breeze. The white dress accentuated her graceful and upright posture. At that moment, she heard the Supplicants’ prayers. They were like drops of holy spring raining down on the depleted Divine Soul!

The Divine Soul was awakened in the rain of light. It grew rapidly and changed Ye Xinxia.

Ancient Athens was surrounded by the black-striped flames and Mad Poppies. A rain of light fell from the sky above the city. The rain of light quenched the heat and cleansed everyone’s wound like a liquid of life.

Those who almost died under the heat waves gradually recovered under the rain of light. Those who were panicked and cried in despair somehow regained peace upon witnessing the rain. The arrogant Golden Sun Tyrant Titan’s Ring of the Sun slowly extinguished under the rain of divine light.

This was the power of the Goddess!

The lone woman in her white dress stood proudly on top of Athens Church. She dispelled the darkest hour and ushered the dazzling white light of dawn!

No one would die tragically again. And no one would be trampled by the Tyrant Titans again!

Parthenon Temple killed the Tyrant Titans once. It had risen to power again because of the Divine Soul and the birth of its Goddess!

…

Without the protection of the Ring of the Sun, the knights’ blood spear finally pierced the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan.

Golden blood gushed out of the Ancient God Apollo’s body. The Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was so angry that it smashed black, enormous stars one after another at the land like a god.

The sky was vast, but black flames fell like black dragons. The majestic power could turn Athens, as well as the mountains and lands outside the city, into ashes.

The Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was an emperor-level creature. Its supernatural power could destroy the world!

Ye Xinxia glowed in divine light. Her white and graceful silhouette appeared in the middle of the light. She gently put her hands on her lips and murmured something that sounded like a song.

The ashes of the Four-colored Sparrowhawks in the sky exploded into a blazing light upon Ye Xinxia’s soft calling. The light appeared in seven colors, and these colors intertwined into an absolute holy white…

They became Divine Blessing White Finches!

Under the Ancient God Apollo’s trample, the Four-colored Sparrowhawks were reduced to cinders. However, they rose to power from the ashes. The Divine Blessing White Finches spread their wings. They covered the sky and formed a Divine Blessing White Barrier on the sky above Athens. The pattern of the barrier belonged to the White Finches. They looked striking.

The black-striped fire could not penetrate the White Finches Barrier. The people looked up at the sky. For the first time, they found true peace. The power of the Divine Blessing could isolate the powerful emperor-level Golden Sun Tyrant Titan!

The Divine Soul was truly powerful.

No one could provide this type of protection.

“Knights, let your God Hunting Will be awakened!

Ye Xinxia’s Psychic Voice rang out in their minds once again. Her voice reached the souls of all the members of Parthenon Knights.

The Goddess was the only one who could summon the Knight’s Contract.

God Hunting Will was an extraordinary Parthenon Temple power used to defeat the Tyrant Titans. Even the weakest Blue Star Knight could pierce the Tyrant Titans with any magic after they were granted the God Hunting Will.
