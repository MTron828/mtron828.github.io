Chapter 315: Nine Halls Fiery Fist!

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

“How is this... how was he able to make a breakthrough in this situation?” Jiang Yi was utterly astounded.

Even the most daring soldiers in their ranks would not dare to act so boldly after being surrounded by demon beasts. A Magician could not be disturbed by any external factor during the process, as they had to put one hundred percent focus on it.

He was surrounded by hundreds of Giant Lizards, who could easily take his life with a single bite!

Wasn’t he worried that the Swift Star Wolf would fail to protect him, allowing just a single Giant Lizard to break through? Didn’t he doubt that his life would be at risk while he was trying to expand his Nebula?

The fiery Rose Flame burst out above the debris, engulfing his entire body. His appearance, similar to burning lava, was more imposing than the heat of the flames.

“Swift Star Wolf, well done. Leave it all to me!” Mo Fan wore a smile. It was relatively wild under the illumination of the flames.

The Swift Star Wolf quickly withdrew to Mo Fan’s side.

The raging flames were quickly withdrawn under Mo Fan’s control, including the heat wave surging toward the surroundings and the fire spreading across the ground. They were rapidly drawn to his right wrist.

His wrist was wrapped by a ring of flames, which were swaying slowly to the wind.

“Rose Flame!”

“Fiery Fist!”

Mo Fan’s hair was standing upright in the overflowing flow of energy. Even his eyes burned like fire in the process.

He threw a mighty punch from the top of the debris. An enormous amount of energy was directed straight into the ground.

The energy was transferred at an insane speed. The surrounding ground began to crack open as if it could not hold the energy within it.

“Nine Halls!”

The energy finally reached its limit. Under Mo Fan’s ferocious roar, pillars of flames began to spurt upward in the area a hundred meters around him!

The pillars of flame were bursting out from deep beneath the ground. Not only did they cause lava to surge to the surface, they had also transformed into burning pillars.

The first one appeared right on Mo Fan’s body. The flames rising from his body sprang into the air!

The second pillar appeared a great distance ahead. The two pillars were around thirty meters apart, but it felt like the area between the two pillars was being utterly destroyed.

The third pillar appeared behind Mo Fan, which was parallel to the pillar on Mo Fan’s body and the pillar in front of him.

Another great explosion took place.

Three pillars parallel to the ones that had sprouted from the ground appeared on both sides as the ground cracked open once again, which meant there were six other fire pillars bursting into the air from underground.

The first three pillars had already eliminated every single Giant Lizard within a hundred meters around Mo Fan, almost a hundred of them.

However, the remaining six pillars had brought utter destruction across the place. The troops of Giant Lizards were burned into black ashes under the blazing fire, including the piles of corpses on the ground.

Nine Halls!

The nine pillars were the formation of Nine Halls!

The fiery pillars were bright red due to the Rose Flame. The Giant Lizards were gradually burned into ashes, regardless of if they were alive or dead. The pillars were around five or six floors high, the Giant Lizards looked incredibly tiny and helpless before them.

Jiang Yi was also an Intermediate Magician who had ranked up to the third-tier, but she did not have a Soul Seed.

Mo Fan’s Soul Seed had made his Fiery Fist: Nine Halls extremely powerful. It was strong enough to annihilate an entire Giant Lizard’s den!

They were still surrounded by the Giant Lizards, but Mo Fan’s surroundings were totally empty, with no sign of flesh or corpses, just piles of black ashes.

On a side note, there was a Warrior-level Tyrant Lizard among the troops of Giant Lizard. It had been confidently making its way towards its prey, but after its whole body was scorched by the Fiery Fist: Nine Halls, it immediately fled for its life.

Even a Tyrant Lizard with an outstanding defense was unable to endure the damage from the Fiery Fist: Nine Halls. It would share the same fate as the Giant Lizards if it did not run away in time.

The Giant Lizards surrounding Mo Fan seemed to be commandeered by the Tyrant Lizard that had fled. As their commander ran away, the Giant Lizards in the distance remained in place with blank faces. None of them were daring enough to move forward.

“This is our chance, time to run!” Mo Fan climbed onto the Swift Star Wolf’s back while the Giant Lizards were dazzled.

The space around the Swift Star Wolf was more than enough for him to gather his momentum up for a sprint. He dashed forward and used the scorched ground as a springboard, jumping onto the collapsed building nearby.

He ran across the roof before dropping down. Even though the path below was densely packed with Giant Lizards, the fearless Swift Star Wolf ran across using their bodies as stepping stones for a short distance.

The Giant Lizards revealed their fangs and tried to snap at him. There were times when Mo Fan almost felt that the Swift Star Wolf’s tail was being bitten, but in the end, he was too fast for the sluggish Giant Lizards, who only ended up biting the air and the fur on the Swift Star Wolf’s tail.

The Swift Star Wolf only sprinted across the Giant Lizards for three seconds, but the fear and excitement from it urged Mo Fan to curl his legs upward subconsciously.

Brother, don’t pull such a prank on me next time. I almost shit my pants!

The Swift Star Wolf turned the corner and arrived at another street covered in shadows, with only a few Giant Lizards around...

Mo Fan instantly released the Swift Star Wolf into the Summoning Plane. He hugged the walls and immediately cast Fleeing Shadow.

Mo Fan had been keeping an eye out at the sky throughout the whole battle. He was not pretending to be an artistic emotional young man before his death. He was waiting for the sun to poke out from the clouds!

The buildings would only cast shadows when there was sunlight!

Mo Fan had disappeared around the corner, and when the Giant Lizards chasing after them reached the spot, they had already lost sight of the human and the wolf.

Meanwhile, the Giant Lizards who were being attracted to the street due to the sounds produced from the battle had not seen Mo Fan and the Swift Star Wolf, nor did they notice a lump of shadow moving between the buildings. They continued to move toward the group of soldiers who were busy killing their comrades.

Jiang Yi had seen Mo Fan disappearing around the corner. However, by the time she reached there, Mo Fan was no longer there...

He had vanished into thin air!

Even though he had only turned the corner, and the entire street was still filled with Giant Lizards, the demon beasts were only rushing toward her men. They did not act as if they had seen anyone rushing past them.

“He’s gone?” Jiang Yi stared into the distance in disbelief. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jiang Yi initially assumed that there was an element of luck when she learned that the kid had saved Bo City and fought back against the Black Vatican. However, she was more convinced that that was not the case now.

She had lost sight of Mo Fan!

Her instincts were telling her that Mo Fan had escaped with some hidden abilities. She would be able to track him down eventually, but the problem was, her troop was still surrounded by the Giant Lizards. She did not even know if they could make it out alive!

Chapter 316: Just in Time, Zhan Kong!

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

“Crap, a pack of Tyrant Lizards are heading toward us!” a soldier who was in charge of observing the surroundings blurted out.

The Giant Lizards would never be able to break through their defense. After all, they were Battlemages who had gone through countless battles. They knew how to exploit the weaknesses of the demon beasts to set up a temporary fortress.

However, the Tyrant Lizards were a completely different story!

Each Tyrant Lizard that had appeared would inflict some damage to their formation. They would need a couple of Intermediate Spells to hold them off.

However, a pack of Tyrant Lizards was definitely a nightmare for them.

They were all trying to hold the overwhelming number of Giant Lizards back. Who would have the spare firepower to deal with the Tyrant Lizards?

Seeing the pack of Tyrant Lizards taking up half of the street with their different-colored skins indicating the Element they possessed, the soldiers could no longer remain calm as before, as death was just around the corner!

“Clear a path, now!” Jiang Yi demanded.

They had to break free from the demon beasts. Otherwise, their entire troop would be wiped out here!

——

Meanwhile, Mo Fan had used the Fleeing Shadow to distance himself from the main street.

He was still at the center of Jinlin City, but for some reason, the buildings nearby had all collapsed. The whole place was full of debris. He could not see the end of it with a glance.

There was no swamp nearby. Although he could still see the towering nest in the distance, there were barely any Giant Lizards nearby.

Mo Fan stood on the remains of an observation tower and looked at the soldiers who were slowly drowning among the demon beasts.

He could imagine the fear replacing their arrogant looks. He could also imagine the disbelief on Jiang Yi’s face when she lost sight of him.

This bunch of idiots, still thinking they stood a chance against him. They would never expect him to be a Shadow Magician, too. He could easily move around as long as there were shadows near him.

The Giant Lizards were extremely slow with their reactions. They would never notice him when he was using their shadows to move around. It was the main reason why Mo Fan had decided to venture deep into their territory.

Most importantly, he had managed to rank up!

Mo Fan now understood why many of their seniors had encouraged the younger Magicians to have more battles against the demon beasts.

Meditating was indeed important, but the best way to improve a human’s potential was through fighting. If he weren’t surrounded by the demon beasts, Mo Fan believed that he would have needed at least another half a year to improve his Fire Nebula to the third-tier.

“Fiery Fist: Nine Halls... I’ve finally mastered such a domineering attack.” Mo Fan clenched his right fist as he recalled the destruction wrought by the giant fire pillars.

He still remembered his first time seeing the attack from Tangyue. Back then, Tangyue was so powerful that Mo Fan had the urge to bow before her. She might have reached a greater height by now, but at least he had caught up to her strength back then. Besides, she was an agent of the Magic Courts!

Leaning back, Mo Fan began to take a rest.

He was slightly worn out from the battle before. Now that he was safe, he was not in a rush to leave, since he was interested in admiring the fate of the evil Battlemages when they ended up dead!

“Mm, what’s that?” Mo Fan realized a pair of white wings were flapping in the sky.

He gathered his thoughts and glanced ahead, taking a clearer look.

The following second, his body began to tremble as if he had been struck by lightning.

It was a Heavenly Eagle with a pair of snowy white wings, slightly bigger than an ordinary one.

It was flapping its wings as it soared across the sky above Jinlin City...

Its claws were extremely huge, and were carrying a giant net.

Four people were trapped inside the net. It looked like they had lost control of their minds. They were utterly helpless against the net and were being dragged around like little chicks. Their eyes were looking at their surroundings helplessly.

Mo Fan was utterly familiar with them, as they were Zhao Manting, Mu Nujiao, Mu Ningxue and Bai Tingting...

Flames of anger ignited within Mo Fan’s heart. He finally realized why Lu Nian was not going after him. It turned out that the devil was chasing after his friends. He was hanging them in the air just to display his bargaining chips.

Mo Fan was exceedingly furious!

How could someone be so despicable! If he could turn his anger into fire around his fist, he would surely have smashed that son of a b**ch’s face with his bare hands!

“Mo Fan, I’ll only say this once, whether if you can hear it or not!”

“Come and kneel in front of me at once. Otherwise, I’ll be throwing them down from this height!

“Don’t you worry, I’ve sealed their souls. I can guarantee you that they won’t be able to cast a single spell during the fall. According to my experience, even a Warrior-level demon beast will be smashed into minced meat from this height. Forget about the little kid from the Zhao Family who’s on the verge of dying after I’ve beaten the crap out of him. However, it would be a pity for the girl with the Ice Element who’s still unconscious. I believe she’s very important to you. If that’s not good enough, how about the three of them together?”

Lu Nian’s devil-like voice echoed in the sky. He had purposely enhanced his voice with his magic, making sure that it would spread to every corner of the city.

As Mo Fan heard the words, flames uncontrollably burst out under his feet. He could no longer control the rage inside him.

Even the outrageous Black Vatican had never made him so angry before. He never thought it would be a person wearing the uniform of a Battlemage!

“Mo Fan, this devil will still kill us even after you’ve shown yourself. Go back to the capital, to the Magic City. You have to let the Enforcement Union and the army know what happened here...” Zhao Manting who was severely injured let out a scream.

He was unable to yell out with magic, as his soul was being sealed. He could only scream at the top of his voice, hoping Mo Fan could hear him somewhere down there.

That being said, there was no chance Mo Fan could hear him due to the height!

Bai Tingting and Mu Nujiao remained silent. Their ears were filled with the echoes of Lu Nian’s terrible laughter.

——

Up in the sky, a great burst of wind swept forward, parting the clouds in a blue line...

A pair of Wind Wings slowly appeared in the blue sky, as a man wearing a wind jacket embroidered with a different pattern on its back flew toward the city rapidly.

The man had a handsome, stubbled face. Although his collars were upright, an obvious scar going across his neck all the way to his chest could still be seen.

“Lu Nian, you’ve committed a terrible crime! Let go of the students at once!” the man approached the giant Heavenly Eagle and snapped furiously.
