“Come with me to the mountain, I need your help to burn the weeds,” Yu Shishi told Mo Fan.

“Are you kidding me? I’m not your servant. Burning the mountain and fertilizing the soil aren’t my job!” Mo Fan was left speechless. Was the woman seriously asking him to do every kind of favor for her?

Did she think she could do as she pleased after convincing Mu Ningxue to take her in? Mo Fan could not care less about her!

“Don’t you want to know my secret? Didn’t I promise to tell you?” Yu Shishi said.

“Only you can hold on to the fragrance. What’s the point if we can’t mass produce it? Just focus on raising your moths, and find someone else to burn the mountain for you,” Mo Fan replied.

The unique fragrance that Yu Shishi had was surprisingly effective, yet it was some ability that only belonged to her, like a natural talent.

It was impossible to replicate natural talent. Otherwise, the Magic Association would have tried to replicate his Double Innate Elements. Wouldn’t that simply double the strength of all Mages?

Mo Fan did not hold a grudge against Yu Shishi. Instead, he was hoping that she could help protect Fanxue Mountain.

Yu Shishi was afraid of fire, but Feiyue Mountain was full of Moss-skinned Weeds that ordinary fire could not burn down. The weeds covering the mountain had claimed most of the nutrients in the soil. If they were not taken care of, it was unlikely she could plant the Blue-Golden Berries.

Burning the weeds would also return the nutrients to the soil!

Yu Shishi went ahead and called a number. As she expected, the unwilling Mo Fan obediently showed up to be her ‘gardener’. Yu Shishi was amused when she saw how reluctant and displeased he was.

“It turns out there’s still someone that can order you around in this world,” Yu Shishi said.

“You shouldn’t disturb Mu Ningxue unless it’s urgent. She’s very busy!” Mo Fan snapped.

“You killed so many of my moths. I’m not asking much at all, I just need your help for some labor. That way, I might forgive you slowly,” Yu Shishi said.

1“That doesn’t make much sense. You do realize that it was me that spared your life!” Mo Fan retorted. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mo Fan soon noticed the weeds that Yu Shishi had mentioned when they arrived at the mountain. Even plants had different levels. These weeds were obviously some higher-level species, meaning that ordinary fire was not as effective against them.

“I’ll start burning the weeds here to the north,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was very good at controlling his flames. He could precisely target the weeds without endangering other plants. It was the main reason Yu Shishi was eager to ask him for help. The work required a reasonable amount of skill, and she needed to find someone reliable.

Yu Shishi found herself a resting spot. She glanced down at Yueyang Land from the mountain and discovered that the town was starting to take shape. She believed she would be seeing rows of spectacular buildings in no time...

Roads were being constructed too. They had invested a lot of money in the roads, so it was most likely going to be a slow and huge project.

They needed time to build the harbor and the canal in the valley, too.

For some reason, Yu Shishi felt calmer seeing the town slowly developing. She was surprised to be looking forward to it, too...

Flames were surging to the north of the mountain. They were like the bright clouds at sunset. The flames soon spread across the mountain.

The fire immediately dyed the sky red, but it did not produce any smoke. The flames surged across the mountain like agile dragons and rapidly burned the weeds into ashes. Heat waves kept coming from the direction of the flames.

Yu Shishi felt nervous when she saw the flames. The moths around her were uneasy, too.

Yu Shishi tried to stay calm while comforting the moths with a soft voice.

Meanwhile, a huge fire broke out in another direction. It was golden in color. It burned vigorously to the south of where Yu Shishi was. It immediately spread across the mountain when Yu Shishi was still lost in her thoughts!

Yu Shishi turned around and was dumbfounded!

Mo Fan was clearly in the north, yet why was there a fire in the south too!?

Most importantly, the direction that the fire broke out was where her moths were!

Yu Shishi had purposely gathered them to the other side of the mountain as she knew they were vulnerable to Mo Fan’s fire. However, the place was currently devoured by the golden fire. The sight of it was nothing but a nightmare to Yu Shishi!

—

Mo Fan also saw the golden fire burning on the mountain.

He was initially confused about why Yu Shishi would want to waste his time if she had already asked someone else to help her.

However, he quickly realized something was wrong after a second thought.

He quickly headed over to where Yu Shishi was, but the woman was nowhere to be seen. He caught a glimpse of a pair of wings flying in the direction the golden fire was soaring into the sky.

“What...what’s going on?” Mo Fan had no idea what happened. He quickly Summoned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf and headed in the same direction.

—

The golden flames were incredibly strong. The moths that were less energetic in the day had no chance of escaping from them when they realized they were in danger. Their wings were swiftly burned into ashes in the fire, and their bodies fell to the scorching ground. Even though they could last for a moment, it was impossible to go anywhere without their wings.

Huge groups of moths fell to the ground and stacked up in piles. The moths that lost their wings soon turned into dried remains in the golden fire.

The moths on the mountain were the remaining moths that Yu Shishi had brought with her from Tongxiang. They had suffered a great loss in numbers from Mo Fan’s fire, and now they were on the verge of being wiped out by the golden flames. The merciless golden fire did not even leave them a chance to cry out in agony. They tried their best to clump together, trying their best to preserve the remaining few of them.

“I hate these things the most. Bugs with wings, how disgusting,” A man in a golden robe stood in the fire at the top of the mountain. He had a disgusted look.

“Err...we’re just trying to lure the moth woman out. I believe we’re currently in someone’s private land, we shouldn’t be making a huge fuss,” the committee member of the Research Union, Ke Lingxi, said.

Ke Lingxi was from the Donghai Magic Association. He was well aware that Mu Ningxue had secured the land as her private property. The government and the Magic Association had strictly forbidden Mages from using destructive spells at the Advanced Level or above in cities or private lands.

Zeng Guanglie burning the entire mountain was clearly inappropriate!

“I’m not even scared of the renowned clans, why would I worry about a little clan that was recently established? I just want to get things done as soon as possible. Don’t you forget, if we mess this up, Mr. Su Lu is going to be very mad at us! Once that happens, it won’t be as easy as burning a mountain!” Zeng Guanglie said.

Zeng Guanglie continued to spread his golden flames wildly across the mountain. The flames started spreading to the hills nearby!

“I seriously don’t understand how you’re a member of the Research Union. The Donghai Magic Association is taking orders from the Asia Magic Association. Why do you even care what the others think, apart from the Donghai Magic Association? It’s a direct order from Mr. Su Lu, you’re worrying too much! We will take out their entire clan if necessary, let alone burning the mountain of a private land!” Zeng Guanglie snapped.

1“We didn’t know Mr. Su Lu was in charge of it,” Ke Lingxi said humbly.

Ke Lingxi had accidentally stumbled into traces of a Totem Beast. He quickly reported it to the authorities of the Donghai Magic Association. He never thought they would bring it straight to Councilman Su Lu...

Ke Lingxi was many ranks lower than a Councilman, and never thought he would be taking orders directly from one. No wonder Zeng Guanglie did not treat the local government and the Magic Association seriously. Who dared to stop them after learning that Councilman Su Lu was supporting them?

“Stop it! Stop it right now!” a hoarse voice screamed from the air.

Ke Lingxi, Zeng Guanglie, and their men raised their heads and saw Yu Shishi flying up there with the wings of a moth.

“A moth woman...she really exists!” a member of the Research Union blurted out in astonishment while staring at her.

“Is she the one?” Zeng Guanglie asked with a grin.

“Yes, she’s the one we are after!”

“See how effective is my simple and violent approach? It didn’t take us long to find her,” Zeng Guanglie’s grin widened. His half-squinted eyes were flickering with a hint of cruelty.

Even Ke Lingxi was slightly intimidated after seeing how vicious the man was. He could not help but wonder what other things he might have done under the orders of Councilman Su Lu.

“Moth lady, you’re pretty lucky that you’ve caught our boss’s attention. Do you know how valuable you are to us?” Zeng Guanglie said.

He stomped on the remains of the moths while speaking.

Yu Shishi looked into the golden fire. She almost lost her mind when she saw the piles of moth remains on the ground...

She had finally found a place to settle down. She was finally able to live a carefree life without being disturbed by the others. She had clearly done nothing wrong; why did it end up like this again!?

Seeing the moths that were like her family turning into dried ashes in the fire, Yu Shishi’s face of rolling tears was soon covered in blue veins!

She let out a painful cry as her fangs were exposed!

It was like she was going to eat these men that had brutally killed her moths!
