1504 Drag Him Into the Water

Translated by XephiZ

The Queen of Netherworld stood in front of the grave with her eyes closed, searching for the spirit that used to live here.

After some time, her expression shifted slightly. She said to Mo Fan, “You shouldn’t mess with the guy that took her body.”

“What do you mean by that? Do you know who it was?” Mo Fan asked curiously.

“I don’t know what it is, but it’s very powerful, at the very least stronger than me,” the Queen of the Netherworld said seriously, warning Mo Fan not to continue searching for the corpse. Otherwise, his life might be in danger!

Mo Fan was even more confused. Who could the person that stole Yuria’s dead body be? What were they trying to achieve?

Mo Fan finally gave up on the thought after the Queen of Netherworld warned him a few more times. He had no other business here at the Holy Judgment Court. He went to pack his stuff after deciding it was time to leave.

—

Mo Fan went back to the Alps Institute to bid farewell to Li Yu’e and Brianca. The Queen of the Netherworld left without a trace after leaving Li Yu’e’s body. Anyway, she would be staying close to him since her duty was to help him open the gate to the Underworld, allowing the undead of their country to vent their frustrations at will!

“Miss Ceylan, what I’ll be doing in Egypt is extremely dangerous. Are you sure you want Heidi to come with us?” Mo Fan asked seriously.

“You do know that her cultivation is currently at a bottleneck. She only has a chance of achieving the Super Level through some special encounters and experiences on the brink of death. I believe your journey won’t be boring, so it’s definitely in Heidi’s favor,” Ceylan answered sincerely.

“Mo Fan, Miss Ceylan has seriously considered it. Can’t you do her a favor?” Professor Li added.

Brianca spoke up, too. She hoped Heidi was able to benefit from the adventure. Meanwhile, Mo Fan was hoping Brianca would go with him, too. Whether it was because of her strength or something he did not have the chance to finish, he had more than enough reason to invite Brianca to come along!

“Miss Brianca, why don’t you come with us and have a tour around Egypt, too? If you agree, I won’t mind bringing Heidi along,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was not willing to let Heidi tag along easily. Their destination was Egypt, and they were involved in a very dangerous mission. He did not mind having beautiful women keeping them company, but if anything happened to Heidi during the trip, he could not afford to bear the consequences!

Inviting Brianca to come along was a good excuse that Mo Fan came up with. It was unlikely that Brianca would leave the Alps Institute. That way, Mo Fan could smoothly turn down their request to bring Heidi along.

“This...”

“Miss Brianca, Mo Fan is only worried that he can’t take care of Heidi on his own. You’re around their age; why don’t you go with them?” Professor Li asked.

“Professor Li is right. We will be less worried knowing that a teacher is with them,” Ceylan nodded.

“Brianca, you do need to go out. Staying at the school will only bury your talents,” Headmistress Perry agreed, too.

Mo Fan glanced at the two teachers in astonishment, before looking at Brianca.

Brianca hesitated for a while, but finally nodded, “Alright, but please give me some time. I’ll need to pack my stuff.”

“Miss Brianca, you don’t have to force yourself. I didn’t really want to go with them either...” Heidi said with some reluctance.

She did not understand why her teachers were asking her to go on an adventure with a few perverts. She would rather go alone!

On second thought, if Brianca was tagging along, the trip would not be as terrible as she imagined. If these jerks teamed up to bully her, Brianca could eliminate them all by moving the tip of her finger!

“I...I didn’t mean it like that,” Mo Fan was going to turn it down, but the teachers and professors did not give him any chance to speak any further. His face immediately darkened.

-What the heck is going on here!?-

Mo Fan had not told them the true goal of his visit to Egypt. How could he just tell the others he was planning to open up a gate to the Underworld? He only told Li Yu’e since he knew she had no clue what he was talking about...

“Forget it, I’ll just settle them somewhere in Egypt. The Queen of Netherworld and I will proceed from there,” Mo Fan comforted himself knowing that things had already gone out of his control. However, why was he feeling a little excited inside?

——

The student exchange that Professor Li and Professor Zheng were in charge of successfully came to an end. They brought Li Ximei, Shi Junsheng, and the others back to the Pearl Institute. The Alps Institute and the Pearl Institute had established a closer relationship through the exchange. The two schools would be working closely from now on. Mo Fan sincerely believed the old folks of the Pearl Institute should thank him for his opening up such a bright future for them...

Mo Fan, Mu Bai, Zhao Manyan, Brianca, and Heidi took a flight to Egypt. Zhao Manyan suddenly realized he had never asked Mo Fan why they were going to Egypt after they were on the plane.

“Mo Fan, why are we going to Egypt? Stop keeping me out of the loop,” Zhao Manyan demanded.

“You remember when the Great Pyramid of Giza came to invade our land?” Mo Fan asked him.

“Of course, I’ll never forget that for my entire life!” Zhao Manyan swore.

“We are going to return the favor,” Mo Fan declared solemnly.

“Are you kidding me now?”

“Do I look like I am?”

“Holy crap, just calm down!” Zhao Manyan immediately had a bad feeling about it.

“Calm down, we aren’t attacking them. Didn’t the Cold Prince open up the gates of the Underworld inside our country, allowing the Underworld creatures to invade our land? We are doing the same thing he did. We are opening up a gate close to the Pyramids in Egypt, so the Kingdom of Undead in our country can attack them. You do know that our country is busy handling threats along the shoreline, but the undead have nowhere to vent their lust to kill. The only way to solve the problem is by waging a war against the undead in Egypt!” Mo Fan explained to him.

“I’m leaving,” Zhao Manyan declared firmly before Mo Fan even finished the sentence.

“We are on a plane.”

“Then I’m jumping off the plane! Are you out of your mind? Why would you even volunteer for a job like that!?” Zhao Manyan said.

“What choice did I have? I didn’t want to take it, either, but the Kingdom of Undead needs to eat and drink, too. Why don’t we give Egypt a huge gift, instead of letting the undead harm our people? Egypt’s government will welcome us with their legs raised. They hate the undead like we do; they want the undead of their country to go away forever,” Mo Fan said.

“I promised to help you look for the Totem Beasts! Do you see how bizarre the things you are doing now are?” Zhao Manyan protested.

“I promise it’s the last time. After we are done, we will focus on looking for the Totem Beasts, so your turtle shell can evolve too...” Mo Fan said.

“How about those two chicks?”

“We’ll find an excuse to send them away. We can’t afford to involve them.”

“How about Green Tea Man?”

“He doesn’t really have anything to live for, so of course we are dragging him into this mess,” Mo Fan said. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Zhao Manyan grinned, and immediately felt a lot better.
