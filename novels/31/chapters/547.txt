The stormy clouds were dense as black silk, covering the sunlight. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

There was no rain, yet the sky was dark. The gray and wilting plants from the current season made the place look dead.

As the final flight slowly descended from the stormy clouds, the passengers on board mostly consisted of the last batch of tourists who dared to come to the Ancient Capital in the middle of the chaos stirred up by the Undead.

“Even the flights have stopped, luckily we made it on the last one,” Liu Ru sighed as they came out from the plane.

Her attractive eyes looked around Xianyang Airport.

Strictly speaking, it was her first time traveling to somewhere far away, and her destination was the Ancient Capital, a city with a whole different reputation than the Magic City, Shanghai!

A man in a uniform stopped the two at the entrance and said sternly, “Sorry, every passenger is required to prove their identity to us and explain their purpose of coming here.”

“Am I out of the country now?” Mo Fan frowned. He never knew the check existed.

“Emergency period, please cooperate,” said the man.

“We’re here for travel, she’s my young lover, so I don’t want anyone to know who she is,” rejected Mo Fan.

Liu Ru’s face blushed when he heard his response.

Can’t he think of a better lie? Why young lover!?

The man’s face stiffened, he had never seen anyone act so righteously when he was traveling with a lover.

Liu Ru did not have any way to prove her identity. Officially, she was already declared dead, all thanks to forensic doctor Nie Dong.

After that, she was turned into a vampire, forcing her to leave her old life. They had yet to make her a new identity.

As for boarding the plane... Liu Ru had used her old identification card. The funny thing was, there seemed to be some loopholes in the airline, as a dead person was able to board the plane with their identity card.

Although vampires were considered a kind of undead, from Mo Fan’s observation over the time he had spent with her recently, her presence felt exactly like a human, the only difference being that she could only digest blood. She even retained the youthful spirit and energy of a teenage girl!

——

It was still daytime, and the undead was sleeping in their tombs.

Xianyang was a certain distance away from the Ancient Capital. Mo Fan and Liu Ru were too lazy to hail a taxi. They simply summoned the Swift Star Wolf and rode him to the Ancient Capital Xi’an along the side of the highway.

They could easily tell that the Ancient Capital was on alert, as even the outer city walls were being patrolled and work was being done on them.

The Ancient Capital of Xi’an had the old city walls. Inside the old city walls was the city center, and outside of them were other districts, like Yanta, Beilin, etc. The places inside the old city walls were mostly attractions for tourists...

Currently, a bigger outer wall was being constructed outside of the old city walls. The coverage of the outer wall was five times bigger than the inner wall, as most people living in the outskirts had moved here instead.

“This is my first time seeing such a giant-sized safe zone,” Liu Ru looked up, glancing at the mountain-like wall.

“Not sure how many Earth Magicians are needed to build it, it’s indeed spectacular... It also implies how grim the situation is. It’s likely that the territory outside of the walls is off-limits to the residents,” said Mo Fan.

The outer wall was an enormous project. From where Mo Fan was standing, he could not even see the end of the wall in either direction.

He remembered that the perimeter of the inner wall was only around fourteen kilometers, but he was clueless about the perimeter of the outer wall, which would completely surround the entire city.

The entrance was guarded by the people of the Magic Association, while the Battlemages were in charge of the checkpoints.

During the day, the inspection was not too strict, but as evening approached, the military would not allow anyone to leave the city, as commoners who were outside of the wall were basically food for the Undead.

After crossing the heavily-guarded outer wall, the situation inside the wall looked fairly normal. It was no different than any other city. However, the streets were fairly lively and crowded as people from the outskirts had moved here.

With the new outer wall protecting the civilians like an enormous dragon, the people were not so worried about the chaos happening outside of the wall. Perhaps they had gotten used to similar situations, hence they just focused on their lives!

Mo Fan did not stay too long in the districts. He headed straight for the Clock Tower Magic Association.

The Clock Tower Magic Association and the Bell Tower Hunter Union were basically right at the center of the city, standing firmly even in stormy rains. Mo Fan was initially planning to learn more about the situation from Zhang Xiaohou’s headquarters, but he decided to ask the person who had sent the death news to him instead...

The guy told Mo Fan that Zhang Xiaohou had gone missing in action during a rescue operation. They had yet to locate his corpse, since they decided not to send anyone else out there. However, he was sure that the incident took place between Sunny Goat Village and Hua Village.

The miracle villages were the only ones left outside of the walls. The villages were still unharmed even today, but as they did not use any modern technology, communication between the villages and the Ancient Capital would take a very long time...

The news about the squad being wiped out was delivered to the army by a villager. The army was not able to validate it.

Mo Fan talked to Zhang Xiaohou’s instructor Fei Jiao for a fairly long time. The instructor basically told Mo Fan everything. It was obvious that the instructor was very concerned about Zhang Xiaohou too, yet because of the important mission on hand, he did not have the chance to go and seek the truth.

“Where do we go now?” asked Liu Ru.

“We’ll find a few experienced Hunters to go to Sunny Goat Village with us,” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was unfamiliar with the place, and most of the time the Undead were scarier to deal with than demon beasts. Whether he was trying to investigate the truth or rescue someone, he would need a reliable team.

Mo Fan was hoping to find some experts from the Magic Association, yet none of them seemed interested in going outside of the walls. In the end, Mo Fan had no choice but to look for members in the Bell Tower Hunter Union...

He could easily find a handful of fearless Hunters!

——

The lobby was crowded.

You could always find Hunters at dangerous places, as the more dangerous a place was, the more treasure it would contain. The Hunter Union at Ancient Capital was fairly active!

Mo Fan glanced at the rolling screen filled with quests, and discovered that lots of them were listed as ‘rescue’...

Since the chaos started, many people were still in danger outside of the walls. Therefore, those who were safe inside the walls would submit quests to rescue them.

“It’s basically all rescues, looks like many people are in danger...” said Liu Ru.

“I won’t call them rescues, it’s more like corpse retrieval,” corrected a hoarse voice.

Liu Ru turned around and saw an adventurous-looking shorty standing nearby. Even with her height, she had to lower her gaze to see his face.

The shorty cleared his throat and said sternly, “Those who submitted the quests are only hoping that their close ones won’t turn into those filthy things outside of the walls. Therefore, our Hunter Union of the Ancient Capital will soon turn into the Corpse Retrieval Union!”
