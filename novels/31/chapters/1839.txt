Mo Fan continued swimming toward the surface. He could finally see the sunlight again after the Featherless Birds forced him back down to the bottom of the sea.

It was bright above the surface. It was obvious that dawn had arrived. Mo Fan finally reached the surface by keeping the Featherless Birds at bay with the murderous aura of his Fiendish Night. He was relieved to see light again.

“~~~~~!” The Bird Emperor had let out a faint cry.

Mo Fan glanced at it and told it, “I’ll get you ashore.”

Mo Fan helped the Bird Emperor out of the water and placed it on a soaked area covered in seaweed. The place was most likely a shoal, but the tide fell back in the morning and exposed the ground. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They seemed to be at the seaward side of Dawn Island. The place had a lot of reefs and undercurrents nearby, so his team had never considered landing here.

The waves were extremely fierce. Mo Fan could feel the ground shaking as the waves splashed on the reefs, even though it was still early in the morning. The sunlight brought new colors to the reefs and the shoal. The Bird Emperor was enjoying the heat from the sun too, as if it was taking an enjoyable nap and ignoring the shocking wound on its belly. It did not seem surprised after its descendants turned against it.

The Lesser Featherless Birds and the Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds had no intention to spare Mo Fan’s life so easily. It was like the creatures were suffering from amnesia. They were traumatized by Mo Fan’s Shadow Magic just a moment ago, yet they began charging at him recklessly again, and surrounded the reefs and shoal in no time.

The waves rolled fiercely as more Featherless Birds and Manta Ray Evil Birds burst out of the water. Some landed on the reefs like bats, quickly looking like bunches of black grapes. Their numbers were just so terrifying. Others were circling in the air like a pack of vultures who had found a battlefield with scattered dead bodies. They would either fly at a lower height or soar into the sky cautiously. They did not want to give anyone on the ground a single moment of peace. Some of them were leaping across the surface of water like schools of fish. They were able to hide and ambush their prey from the water, too!

“You sons of b***hes, you no longer have a chance now that I’ve come ashore. I’ll kill every single one of you!” Mo Fan shook the water off himself as flames spread rapidly under his feet. The familiar energy engulfed him. His confidence and unruliness grew together with the flames, even as the Lesser Featherless Birds and the Manta Ray Evil Birds were approaching him!

The three Soul-grade Flames erupted ferociously from Mo Fan’s body. The Fire Magic formed a Domain under Mo Fan’s control, burning the Featherless Birds and Manta Ray Evil Birds within a hundred and fifty meters from him with scorching heat.

However, Mo Fan suddenly felt light-headed as he was about to unleash his power. His vision darkened as he almost fell to the ground.

Mo Fan staggered a few steps and quickly held onto a rock nearby. The flames he had accumulated had dissipated by half too.

“What just happened?” Mo Fan was astounded. The situation had never occurred to him before.

Mo Fan immediately looked at his thigh and noticed a strange blue color surfacing on his flesh. It had permeated into his arteries and veins.

“Damn it, I forgot these things are poisonous!” Mo Fan realized.

Zhao Manyan had also been in a feeble state not long after he was injured. He soon fell unconscious after that.

Meanwhile, on top of the huge wound on Mo Fan’s thigh, there were lots of other cuts and bruises on him too. He might have the Demon Flesh, but the poison would still affect him after reaching a certain level.

The Bird Emperor noticed Mo Fan was poisoned. It let out a faint cry, telling Mo Fan not to waste his time on it. It was satisfied as long as it did not die while being chained.

“I won’t let a poison like this stop me. You better lie still. I’m going to save you, I already gave you my word!” Mo Fan swore.

The poison slowly spread in Mo Fan’s body. He was unsure how much of the paralyzing poison had permeated into his body. The flames that faded away returned once again. Mo Fan was already preparing the Sky-Flame Funeral for the Manta Ray Evil Birds that were circling in the sky like vultures!

Flames poured down from the sky like a rain and spread across the shoal, turning the place into a sea of flames. The waves struggled to put out the flames.

The flames were meant to last for a little longer and spread over three hundred meters away, but Mo Fan suddenly felt light-headed once again. He fell to his knees after losing control of his legs. He almost went face-down into the water.

The flames were in complete disorder. Mo Fan was extremely annoyed by the dull shrieks of the Manta Ray Evil Birds.

He had finally made it out of the water, yet he was going to lose to their disgusting poison. It explained why the Manta Ray Evil Birds were unwilling to come too close to him for some time. They were not intimidated, they were simply waiting for the poison to spread, so he would soon be like an animal injected with anesthesia, waiting to be slaughtered.

The carnelian Manta Ray Evil Birds immediately knew what was going on when they saw Mo Fan losing his strength all of a sudden. The creatures were cunning hunters. They immediately gave the order after the flames on the shoal dissipated. The rest of the Featherless Birds that were waiting on the reefs, circling in the sky, and leaping on the surface of the sea began to charge at him.

The army of Manta Ray Evil Birds soon formed a brown cloud rolling forward. Their ugly and greedy appearance had rid them of their former imperious bearing. They were more like a bunch of lowly bats now. They were all trying to be the first, yet they were purposely slowing down so they would not die in the front like cannon fodder.

The Bird Emperor knew the creatures were after it. It slowly moved its body and struggled while moving toward the shoal.

Mo Fan was having trouble moving his body due to the paralyzing effect of the poison. He had the option to flee into the woods with his Fleeing Shadow, but how could he possibly leave like that? He did not take half a step back during the intense battle. How could he possibly admit his defeat when he was up against these twisted creatures?

“Cry of the Woman of Snow, Icecloud Crystal Realm!” came a loud voice from the top of the hill behind Mo Fan. He immediately sensed a powerful magic aura, strong enough to change the weather and make the sun dim!
