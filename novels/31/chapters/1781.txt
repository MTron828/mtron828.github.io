“That man... is crazily strong!” Wen Xia’s subordinates were dumbfounded.

It turned out that they were indeed here just to provide the man with some support. They did not have to cast a spell to defeat the Black-Silver Rock Demon. The young man had defeated it on his own!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was struggling to remain intact amid the fierce flames. Wen Xia simply followed up with a strong Mountain Drill Spinning Top to disintegrate it.

The creature’s remains fell into a pile. One Mage after another covered in ash was rolling down the little hill. Wen Xia’s men were unsure what to do, seeing the huge number of feeble victims.

“Fang Di, I’ll leave them to you. We’ll head over to the next location,” Wen Xia ordered, leaving one of her men behind.

“Affirmative!”

Time was running short. There were still three Black-Silver Rock Demons throwing a tantrum in the city. They had realized the Barrier was stopping their lackeys from advancing, so they were ramming into the Barrier with their powerful bodies.

“There, those creatures are serious about wiping us out,” Wen Xia said angrily when she saw the Black-Silver Rock Demon on the other side of the Barrier.

“It’s...it’s so big!” Deputy Lieutenant Hou blurted out in shock.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon that was attacking the Barrier was around ten meters taller than the Black-Silver Rock Demon they had just defeated. It no longer felt like a rock creature, given the hue and luster it had. It was more like a black metal demon with a strong mechanical vibe to it!

“What is it doing?” Wen Xia asked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Black-Silver Rock Demon suddenly walked toward a park around five hectares in size. It was built on a higher ground than the city streets. It even had a rockery with trees and flowers and a small waterfall. It was a fine little park.

To everyone’s surprise, the Black-Silver Rock Demon suddenly pulled the cement park right out of the ground with its insane strength!

A huge hole was left behind. The terrifying Black-Silver Rock Demon lifted the whole park and used it to beat on the Barrier.

The park had somehow become the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s weapon. The park would shatter a little every time it slammed into the Barrier.

The scene had left the whole city center in awe. How could they possibly stand a chance against a creature with such godly strength?

“That’s...that’s insane!”

“Can we really beat that thing?”

The aides-de-camp immediately lost their courage when they realized how weak they were compared to the Black-Silver Rock Demon.

Wen Xia clenched her teeth. This Black-Silver Rock Demon was a lot stronger than the others they had encountered. It would be impressive if they could survive it, let alone defeat it!

“Mo Fan, should we try and take out the other two first?” Wen Xia was a little intimidated.

“It will do. Once we defeat it, the other two will no longer be a problem for us!” Mo Fan rubbed his palms together. He went ahead and engaged the creature without bothering to discuss things.

Wen Xia was thinking of coming up with a plan with Mo Fan, yet the man was bolder than everyone imagined. He immediately engaged the Black-Silver Rock Demon while everyone else was intimidated by its overwhelming strength!

“I would like to see how long you’re going to be able to lift that!” Mo Fan Blinked onto the park that was being raised into the air.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was swinging the park at the Barrier when a silver light encapsulated the entire thing and applied enormous pressure to it. The Black-Silver Rock Demon even sank half a meter into the ground. The mountain trail was not too sturdy in the first place, and almost collapsed under the weight.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon finally realized someone was standing on the park. It was confused as to why the park was twice as heavy when the human was only around the size of a small bush!

The park gradually became even heavier. The Black-Silver Rock Demon had no choice but to drop it to the ground with a boom. It quickly scanned its surroundings, searching for the tiny human that had shown up to mess with its plan as it angrily pulled a long rocky spear out from thin air!

The creature tossed the long spear at Mo Fan once it spotted him. He immediately turned into a shadow bird and disappeared into the darkness. The long spear flew over a kilometer, sweeping dust into the air along its trail. It eventually landed in the street of a business district, quivering there like a new flag pole.

Mo Fan’s eyes emitted a silver glow after he landed on a transmission tower. “Rise!”

An invisible aura began to spread into his surroundings as his Will split into different streams, scattered across the remains of the fallen buildings. The debris slowly rose into the air under Mo Fan’s control.

“Go!” Mo Fan swung his hand. The debris, pillars, and beams accelerated as they were fired at the Black-Silver Rock Demon.

The projectiles were quite heavy. The Black-Silver Rock Demon had to struggle to withstand the impacts.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon slammed its fist into the ground. A sand dune suddenly emerged there, forming a shield standing firmly in front of the Black-Silver Rock Demon. Most of the projectiles Mo Fan was controlling ended up smashing into dust!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon lifted its leg and stomped the ground.

A fan-shaped quake blew forward rapidly, almost like a herd of sprinting wild beasts, destroying and knocking aside everything along its path, including Mo Fan!

The fan-shaped wave covered a wide area, and Mo Fan had nowhere to hide from it. He had no choice but to use Blink to distance himself from the Black-Silver Rock Demon.

Mo Fan initially planned to damage the outer shell of the Black-Silver Rock Demon and focus his spells on the same wound to inflict serious damage on it. However, the creature’s Earth Magic was so strong that he had no choice but to back away instead.

His spells were obviously out of range with the current distance between him and the Black-Silver Rock Demon. However, the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s attacks could still reach Mo Fan still, placing him in a very passive situation.

“The presence of the Earth Element is very strong here, so its attacks are a lot stronger too,” Wen Xia called out to him.

“I know that. I wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage if my Earth Element was stronger!” Mo Fan said angrily.

He was considered an Earth Mage too, but his Basic and Intermediate Earth Spells were useless in the fight against the high-level creature.

“I’ll help you!” Wen Xia said.
