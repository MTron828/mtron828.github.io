Zhao Manyan was suddenly enlightened!

Golden tail fur, golden tail fur, wasn’t there one not far away?!

“At your seven, the one that is moving left and right, I’ll mark it for you!” Zhao Manyan had sharp eyes. He immediately noticed a White-Headed Monster Ape with golden tail fur!

He tossed the spell Brilliant Light at the White-Headed Monster Ape with golden tail fur. The light shone down upon the creature, and it was suddenly glowing golden, standing out among the others.

“Well done!” Mo Fan locked his gaze on the glowing monster ape.

The monster ape realized it had been compromised. As it started to retreat, Mo Fan slammed the ground with his fist to cast Groundbreak.

The shiny monster ape was about to run for its life when the ground under its feet cracked open. Scorching lava burst out in the shape of a blossoming flower of death, completely devouring the monster ape.

Following its death, a huge group of monster apes ahead turned into dust and scattered in the wind.

The path ahead soon cleared up. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan quickly proceeded and reached a slope.

Glancing down from the slope, they immediately saw the whole basin crawling with White-Headed Monster Apes, as if they were having some kind of gathering. The entrances to the mines were tightly packed.

The cries of the White-Headed Monster Apes were like roars of thunder, the mountains were shaking in a deep rumble.

Before, Zhao Manyan would surely have run for his life after witnessing such a scene, his scalp numb. The army of monster apes was clearly not something he could take on alone.

However, after learning their secret, his eyes quickly scanned the creatures for those with golden tails.

“I’ll mark them!” Zhao Manyan tossed the spell Brilliant Light out. The golden light shone down upon the place. It did not make any difference when shining on the White-Headed Monster Apes, but when the light struck a creature with golden tail fur, the creature would glow with a golden light.

“Can Brilliant Light seriously do that?!” asked Mo Fan curiously.

“Don’t underestimate me!” Zhao Manyan smiled confidently.

After Zhao Manyan tagged the symbol-wielding creatures with Brilliant Light, they had no chance of hiding from Mo Fan. Mo Fan adeptly cast his spells to kill the symbol-wielding monster apes instantly!

When an Intermediate Spell, or even a Basic Spell, could instantly eliminate over two hundred monster apes, the battle was nowhere as terrifying as anyone thought. They cleared the path from the slope to the basin, and gradually approached the entrance of the mines.

“Let’s pick up the pace! If the army of monster apes at the front returns, it’ll be tricky to deal with them,” said Mo Fan.

If the number of monster apes suddenly increased overwhelmingly, they would have trouble targeting the symbol-wielding monster apes, and the two of them would be in great danger. It was necessary to eliminate the monster apes as quickly as possible!

——

“What’s going on out there?” a manager of the mines close to the entrance asked.

“Two people are moving closer to us!” replied a Magician in the mines.

“Two...two people?” the person-in-charge was stunned.

“It’s indeed just two of them.”

A few Magicians were standing close to the edge of the Barrier, allowing them to see outside the Barrier.

Two young Magicians were making their way toward them. They were able to kill hundreds of monster apes with a single wave, like they were simply patting the dust off their shoulders.

The Magicians in the mine could not believe what was going on. Did someone actually send Super Magicians to save them?

But, how could they possibly reach the Super Level at such a young age?

“Open the Barrier, let us in!” Mo Fan shouted at the mines over a huge bunch of monster apes.

The Magicians did not dare to open the Barrier. They watched the two young Magicians taking on the creatures in fear.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were speechless. They could only force their way to the entrance. There were simply too many monster apes surrounding them to identify the symbol-wielding creatures, they had to enter the mines as quickly as possible.

“Mo Fan, two of them on your left!” Zhao Manyan tossed a Brilliant Light and tagged the two monster apes with golden tails.

“Back off!” Mo Fan waved his hands and summoned a strong spatial energy to knock the monster apes pouncing at them away.

With a quick glance, he immediately zeroed in on the two symbol-wielding monster apes. As he took out a Lightning Constellation Scroll, lightning bolts immediately descended upon the place!

A lightning beam surged forward and penetrated a few dozen monster apes in a straight line, hitting the two symbol-wielding monster apes accurately...

Mo Fan had picked the perfect time to attack. The two creatures happened to be in a straight line, allowing the lightning beam to kill them in less than a second. The remaining illusionary monster apes disappeared instantly!

As the bunch of monster apes vanished into thin air, the two finally woke up from the nightmare of being surrounded by thousands of demon creatures. The whole place suddenly emptied out, not a single creature was nearby. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Damn it, those two symbol-wielding creatures summoned at thousands of mirror images!” cursed Zhao Manyan when he saw the creatures around him disappearing.

As soon as the symbol-wielding creatures were dead, thousands of illusionary monster apes vanished too. The outside of the mines suddenly became a lot safer.

The Magicians in the mines were stunned after witnessing what had happened.

-Aren’t these two young Magicians a bit too powerful? They just eliminated over a thousand monster apes within the blink of an eye!-

“Open the Barrier now!” yelled Mo Fan.

The Magicians finally came to their senses. They quickly deactivated the Barrier, allowing Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan to enter the mines.

“Are...are you two here to save us? Our Barrier won’t hold much longer,” the dark-skinned, plump manager cried out excitedly.

The other Magicians burst into tears too. They seriously thought their lives would end here, as they would soon be torn to pieces by the fierce monster apes.

“We’ll talk later... hurry up and find this guy,” Mo Fan handed a portrait to the manager of the mines.

Before coming to the mines, Mo Fan had already asked General Mott’s men to find out the person that stole the Nazca Gem. Zhao Manyan, Ai Jiangtu, and Jiang Yu had all seen the person before. After describing him and comparing the facial features to the miners and Magicians in their database, they soon found the suspect after filtering out those that did not resemble the picture provided.

Their information stated that the thief was just an ordinary miner. They had no clue how the man was able to trespass into Nazca and steal the gem.

It was none of Mo Fan’s concern. His main priority was to put an end to the curse by giving the eye of the geoglyph back. Otherwise, the fifth wave of Nazca Monster Birds would come soon. Even if they knew about the symbol-wielding creatures, they still had no hope of surviving against an army of a million monster birds!

“Why are you looking for him?” the person-in-charge asked with a confused face.

“Do you want to live? Then hurry up and find this guy!” snarled Mo Fan impatiently.

The man had witnessed Mo Fan’s destructive power. He did not waste any more time after seeing how Mo Fan was pissed off. He quickly asked the Magicians to search for the man.

—

Even though there were around three thousand miners, it was not difficult to find the person, since they already knew his name.

The miner called Selton was soon brought to Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan by the Magicians. Zhao Manyan studied the man and said to Mo Fan confidently, “He’s the one.”

Selton pretended to be innocent, but when he realized they had figured out what he had done, he immediately broke free from the Magicians holding him and ran into the mines crazily.

“Still trying to run away? Not even showing any resentment after stirring up such a great mess, do you seriously want the three thousand people here to die with you?” Mo Fan harrumphed coldly and tossed a Giant Shadow Spike from his hand.

The fourth-tier Giant Shadow Spike had outstanding effects. Countless shadow needles immediately nailed the miner to the ground, sealing off every inch of his muscles and immobilizing him!

Zhao Manyan immediately went up to the man and searched his body.

“What are you doing? Who do you think you are, trapping me here!?” Selton screamed.

Zhao Manyan turned around and frowned. “Mo Fan, he doesn’t have it.”

“He must have hidden it in the caves,” said Mo Fan.

Selton was just an ordinary human. Even though they were unsure how he managed to move freely in the dangerous forbidden land of Nazca, he must have been targeted by the Nazca Monsters when he took the eye of the Nazca Monster Bird’s geoglyph. He did not come back to the mines to work, but more likely to hide the stolen eye. There was no better place to hide it than a mine.

After the manager of the mines learned the truth, he immediately asked the miners to search every place. Since it was important to save their lives, the miners searched for the stolen eye diligently. They swore to find the gem even if they had to dig three inches into the ground.

Not long after, a minor found the Nazca Gem inside a hollow rock.

Selton’s face turned pale when his hidden treasure was discovered.

“You...you can’t do this!” Selton screamed in a frenzy.

“If my guess is right, you must be a descendant of the native Indians?” Mo Fan asked, staring at Selton.

Selton was startled. He did not expect Mo Fan to guess his identity so easily.

“Don’t you feel ashamed that you’ve brought disgrace to the emblem of Li Fan Flower you’re wearing?” said Mo Fan.

Selton was an ordinary human, but he was actually not that ordinary. He happened to be a descendant of an ancient tribe among the Indians. It was the reason why he could enter the forbidden land of Nazca without being attacked.

Mo Fan managed to guess his identity because Lingling had discovered a flower called the Time Flower when she was digging up information about the Time Liquid. Another flower that existed in the same era was the Li Fan, the flower that had gone extinct, which Jiang Shaoxu mentioned in the ancient city at the center of the storm.

This miner called Selton had the emblem of Li Fan Flower tattooed on his chest!

Despite having the inerasable emblem, it did not necessarily mean his soul had inherited the spirit of sacrificing himself to protect the heritage of the Indians.

The Time Flower and Li Fan Flower had both gone extinct as time passed. The descendants of the Indians had also forgotten their past and were corrupted by the modern world. Only the geoglyphs left by the ancient Indian civilization continued to protect their heritage from invaders and thieves at all costs!
