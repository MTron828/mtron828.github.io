Chaos Magic was different from illusions. Everything the person saw was like an illusion, yet the scene that felt like a dream was actually real. The Chaos Magic was actually manipulating the laws and order of space!

Xing Hui was not totally clueless about things. He straightened his face after he realized he was trapped in an isolated distorted space!

His options were to defeat the person who had created the distorted space, or to destroy the weak points and shatter the whole thing like glass.

However, Xing Hui was not great at perception. He would rather defeat Mo Fan instead of wasting the time and energy to look for the weak points. He preferred the simpler approach!

“You have sent the Sound Mage outside too. It seems you are stupider than I thought,” Xing Hui looked around and grinned. His yellow teeth glittered under the sunlight.

Xing Hui was standing at the top of the peak. The hillside was jagged with many sharp edges. In front of him was a steep slope, covered in ice rocks scattered irregularly across it.

Behind him was a steep slope with the same ice rocks. Most importantly, he would see the same things whether he was looking forward or back. A steep slope, Mo Fan, and the enormous rift!

The world was like an endless loop of mountains, valleys, rifts, mountains, valleys, rifts...

Xing Hui had seldom fought against Chaos Mages, so it was his first time being trapped in such a strange space. He could tell that Mo Fan did not want him to leave, going as far as setting up a space with endless loops just to trap him.

Having less experience with the Chaos Magic did not necessarily mean he was going to lose the fight miserably. The Chaos Element was not destructive on its own. He just needed to figure out his opponent’s weakness. The Chaos Magic would end up like an amusing and meaningless clown’s trick!

“You are overestimating yourself. I’m in a rush here. Otherwise, I could easily beat the crap out of you with a handicap of just using half my Elements!” Mo Fan harrumphed coldly.

“Half your Elements?” Xing Hui was amused, but on second thought, half of Mo Fan’s Elements would mean the same number of Elements as his!

Xing Hui had no idea where Mo Fan had gotten the courage to fight him alone without the Sound Mage’s help. He had reached the Super Level at least a year or two faster than Mo Fan. Even though he had wasted the past two years on gambling and drinking, he could still defeat a novice Super Mage like Mo Fan with ease!

“You should focus on mastering your spells instead of coming up with these boring tricks!” Xing Hui yelled.

The mountain began to tremble. The thick snow covering it began to fall.

The ice mounds started breaking. The snow rolled down the mountain with the ice.

It was only a part of the ice and snow at first, but by the time it reached the middle of the hill, it had turned into a terrifying avalanche after half the hillside was shaved clean!

Xing Hui stood on the avalanche like he was commanding hundreds of ferocious beasts charging at Mo Fan. The avalanche was already big enough to overwhelm the entire valley by the time it reached the foot of the hill!

“It seems like your Earth Element is just a little baby. Unfortunately, you will no longer have the chance to practice it, HAHAHA!” Xing Hui looked down at the little barrier that Mo Fan had set up.

Rock Barrier: Mountain Screen?

The spell was like the little fence around an ancient village. It might be slightly effective against a small flood, but even ten times its sturdiness was no match for his avalanche! The whole village would soon be destroyed by the spell!

The avalanche devoured everything in its path mercilessly. The barrier Mo Fan had established had collapsed too. Xing Hui slid all the way to the edge of the crevasse. He turned around and grinned when he confirmed Mo Fan and his petty spell were buried under the snow.

Having more Elements was just a joke compared to his absolute strength!

“Climb out, get out of the snow, I don’t believe you will die so easily,” Xing Hui yelled disdainfully at the snow.

“A brain is a good thing, if you actually have one,” Mo Fan’s voice suddenly came from higher up.

Xing Hui was startled. He immediately looked at the top of the hill.

He was at the top of the hill! How was he up there?

He was clearly at the base not long ago. The snow had devoured both him and his Rock Barrier. How did Mo Fan get to the top of the hill? Didn’t he just come down from there?

Xing Hui suddenly realized something was off. He immediately looked behind him and noticed the space behind him spinning and the ground under his feet shaking. Everything around him had turned into pieces of a puzzle that was being shuffled. They were being reconstructed under someone else’s control!

The process only lasted for a few seconds. When everything returned to normal, Xing Hui realized the avalanche had gone in the wrong direction. The real Mo Fan was actually at the foot of the hill behind him, instead of the one in front of him!

The principles of the space that Xing Hui was trapped in were quite simple. It was like placing a mirror both in front and behind Xing Hui, but the only difference was, the world within the mirrors was real too!

Mo Fan was clearly behind Xing Hui, but he kept yelling at the Mo Fan inside the mirror in front of him. He had even made an avalanche to attack the Mo Fan in the mirror!

As a matter of fact, anyone with a basic understanding of the Chaos Element knew they could estimate the distance of something they saw within via the transmission of sound, and determine if what they were seeing was actually in front of them.

Xing Hui’s stupidity was beyond Mo Fan’s imagination. He seriously wondered where the guy had gotten the confidence to provoke him and Mu Ningxue!

“I have nothing but time, but you are in a rush to save someone. Keep using your stupid tricks!” Xing Hui realized how stupid he was too, but he would never admit it.

Mo Fan almost burst out laughing after hearing Xing Hui’s words.

He had set up the distorted space long ago. Did the man really think he was doing nothing all this time?

Couldn’t he see the dark energy surrounding him that was about to drag him into the abyss of death?

Didn’t he notice the Star Palace of the Lightning Tyrant with twelvefold damage amplification was accumulating its energy and ready to kill him at any second?
