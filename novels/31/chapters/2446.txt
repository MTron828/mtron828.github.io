Zhang Xiaohou had several guesses on what the mission was about. He also knew it was confidential and urgent.

However, he did not expect it would involve a Forbidden Curse!

The countdown for a Forbidden Curse. Wouldn’t that mean the culprits in the Bohai Sea were so strong that they had to rely on a Forbidden Curse?

Forbidden Curses and ordinary magic were completely different. A Forbidden Curse was at least a hundred times stronger than a Super Spell, and that was only describing the initial damage a Forbidden Curse would cause. Most terrifyingly, a Forbidden Curse would often inflict irrecoverable damage on the surrounding areas and environment.

The power of Forbidden Curses had to be treated with extreme caution. They were usually treated as a last resort when mankind was at stake. The Magic Associations across the five continents and many countries had forbidden every organization, faction, country, and Forbidden Mages to use Forbidden Curses.

“Chief, will you be handling it?” Zhang Xiaohou could not withhold the shock in his heart.

They were going to use the strongest magic in the world! It did not matter what creature they were up against. It was going to perish for sure!

“The Ice Emperor will handle the Forbidden Curse. The Induction has already begun. We now need the coordinates for the Seal,” the man said.

“Coordinates for the Seal?” Zhang Xiaohou soon realized why he had been called here.

The Induction of a Forbidden Curse was a massive process. Most Forbidden Mages were unable to complete a Forbidden Curse by themselves.

Forbidden Mages were usually the main Inductors. They needed other Inductors and magic Formations to provide the Forbidden Curse with an enormous amount of energy.

The Forbidden Curse did not involve a mere Star Palace made up of twenty-four hundred and one Stars. They would have to construct an imperial city full of shiny Star Palaces, meaning a lot of Super Mages would be involved!

Zhang Xiaohou was not an Ice Mage. None of his men were outstanding Ice Mages either, which meant his troop was called here for a different job.

“The trickiest part of a Forbidden Curse is its Induction. The whole Bohai Sea will be alerted during the Induction, but we have already made the necessary preparations. We will not allow the sea monsters to interrupt the process.

“After the Induction, the Forbidden Curse will need specific coordinates for its landing point.”

The destructive might of a Forbidden Curse was immeasurable. Its power was just too overwhelming due to the Induction performed by a Forbidden Mage with the help of countless Super Mages, Advanced Mages, and Elemental Formations.

The Forbidden Curse had an insane coverage area, too. It might even trigger disastrous events like tsunami, landslides, earthquakes, hail, and volcanic eruptions.

It was difficult to tell how long the Forbidden Curse would last, and what level of Elemental Storm it would trigger and where it would go to.

A Forbidden Curse would also disrupt the stability of space and create a Black Hole. Even as the space was repairing itself, the Black Hole would devour everything within a certain range as it was shrinking.

They had to consider a lot of factors before using a Forbidden Curse, especially since every area of land was utterly precious to mankind. Once a Forbidden Curse was used, the whole place would be cursed and become uninhabitable!

Therefore, the coordinates of the Forbidden Curse’s first impact point were crucial due to the uncertainties involved.

The Dragon King Culprits posed a huge threat to the entire coastline of their country. If the coordinates missed the Dragon King Culprits’ nest, many of them would survive the Forbidden Curse.

However, if the nest of the Dragon King Culprits was too close to human territory, they would have to compromise and find the coordinates with the perfect balance between the safety of human territory and the damage the Forbidden Curse would inflict on the enemy!

The landing point of the Forbidden Curse! It was a tough mission for Zhang Xiaohou’s platoon of Violet Imperial Mages!

“Xiaohou, even the main Inductor couldn’t estimate the damage of the Forbidden Curse. Once the countdown ends, the Forbidden Curse will be released. Therefore, you must flee as soon as you find the coordinates.”

“I promise I’ll finish my mission!”

“I want you to complete the mission and come back safely!” the man ordered him.

“Affirmative, sir!”

Zhang Xiaohou was excited and a little uneasy when he returned to his troop.

It was the highest order he had been given since he joined the army. The safety of all of China was at stake, not to mention they were going to use the strongest magic in the world to resolve it.

He looked at the sea now covered in darkness. Many powerful creatures were hiding in the shadows and under the waves.

Even though Zhang Xiaohou had no idea what they were going up against, the fear in his heart gradually diminished after learning they were backed by a Forbidden Curse.

The stars were still glowing brightly in the sky. People always said the brightest star was the eye of a person who remained at the bottom of one’s heart after they had left during one’s childhood.

They would see the person’s gaze when their heart was as calm as the night sky.

Zhang Xiaohou could only hug his head and cry in the past, but he now had the power to protect an entire sea!

“You should worry more about your own safety first next time,” Zhang Xiaohou murmured. He pulled his cap lower and headed for the brightly-lit camp.

The sun had just risen. The cold of the dawn mixed with the sea breeze greeted Zhang Xiaohou.

He washed his face to quickly get rid of his sleepiness and looked at the clock tower on the mountain.

The clock was adjusted to indicate days, meaning a complete cycle of the minute hand was equivalent to a day. A complete cycle of the hour hand would mean twelve days. The Forbidden Curse would take place when all three hands were pointing at twelve.

Only twelve days left until the deadline.

They did not have much time. They could not afford to waste a single second!

“General, we’ve received the information on the Dragon King Culprits. Should I read it out to everyone?” the Head of the Royal Guards inquired of him.

“Yes!”

The Flying Dragon beat its wings and took off into the sky, stirring up huge waves and strong gusts of wind. A group of dragon beasts followed the Flying Dragon and soared into the clouds.

The Bohai Sea’s coastline was extremely long. They had to keep searching along it all the way to Dalian.

Their information stated the Dragon King Culprits were residing close to the coastline. They might also be staying on the islands that were close to the mainland.

They could not exclude the swamps and wetlands, either. After all, the Dragon King Culprits were active in other areas than the Bohai Sea. Buildings were collapsing mysteriously in the East China Sea and South China Sea too, including the Magic City!

“Let’s go to Luning County first,” Zhang Xiaohou said after reading the information.

“Are we finally going after the creatures that are keeping the people around the Bohai Sea in constant fear? Humph, we’ll soon learn their secrets!” Captain Tian declared.

The Dragon King Culprits would definitely have left some clues behind after destroying so many buildings in Luning County. That being said, it was not going to be easy to look for the clues!
