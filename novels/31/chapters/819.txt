The Jagged-Paw Green Demons had outstanding jumping ability. They dashed out of the water and climbed along the narrow balconies of the buildings. These balconies were meant to be used by the Magicians as landing spots, yet they were now occupied by the ferocious creatures with jagged paws. The flicker in their gray eyes was full of bloodlust!

“Formation!” ordered Nanyu when she saw the sea monsters advancing.

The team immediately split up across the buildings while maintaining the distance between them, giving them sufficient space for the fights.

The length of the street was around five hundred meters, and the buildings on the same row were less than thirty meters apart. The distance to the opposite row was around forty meters. Currently, the alleyways and the streets were all flooded. The water was around eight meters high, and it seemed to be rising still.

The Jagged-Paw Green Demon were amphibians. They could easily climb up the buildings to fight the Magicians!

“Jagged-Paw Green Demon, experts at close-combat, likes to sever the limbs of their target, not poisonous, but be careful of the urchin-like spikes on their heads, it has a paralyzing effect. The spikes will immobilize the target they hit...” Jiang Yu told everyone what he knew about the Jagged-Paw Green Demon as quickly as he could.

“Any weaknesses?” Ai Jiangtu looked around him and took note of the number of Jagged-Paw Green Demons climbing onto the building.

“No.”

“What magic can they cast?”

“Running on water, spitting water as projectiles, nothing special,” said Jiang Yu.

Nanyu closed her eyes, as if she was paying attention to the sounds around her.

Around three seconds later, Nanyu opened her eyes and said to Ai Jiangtu, “There are thirty-seven of them climbing up the buildings. I can’t tell how many are in the water still.”

“Stay here and look after Nan Rongni, and stay on alert for the White Sobbing Demons. Let the team know if you detect their presence, I’m placing you in charge of commanding the team,” Ai Jiangtu told her.

Nanyu nodded.

“So you’re a Sound Magician,” murmured Zhao Manyan in surprise.

Since the Sound Element was the rarest among the secondary Elements, most people were unfamiliar with it. However, Zhao Manyan was still knowledgeable enough to know the special capabilities that a Sound Magician would have.

Every Magician had a sensing ability, which basically involved unleashing their will to detect movement within a few dozen meters, perhaps up to a hundred meters away. A strong cultivation would lead to a stronger motion sense.

However, in a Sound Magician’s eyes, the so-called sensing ability of every other Magician was good for nothing.

Every movement would involve sound, and whenever Sound Magicians listened closely, they would be able to capture every movement nearby.

It was said that even Shadow Magicians were unable to escape a Sound Magician’s hearing. If Nan Rongni had not voluntarily jumped into the White Sobbing Demon’s trap because of its bait, the White Sobbing Demon would have had no chance of ambushing the team while Nanyu was around!

“Watch your six!” advised Nanyu, without answering Zhao Manyan’s question.

Zhao Manyan looked behind himself in confusion, but quickly saw a Jagged-Paw Green Demon staring right into his eyes after reaching the roof.

Zhao Manyan raised his thumb at Nanyu and decided it was not the time for chit-chat. He indifferently summoned a golden light orb into his hand and tossed it at the Jagged-Paw Green Demon.

The light orb turned into a blinding flash in front of the Jagged-Paw Green Demon. The creature immediately let out an unpleasant screech while hanging onto the edge of the building. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The creature was most likely surprised by the blinding light. It managed to calm down after a few seconds and jumped into the air, before landing less than ten meters away from Zhao Manyan. Its slightly burned eyes moved back and forth, looking at the Magicians.

“They are creatures from the ocean. Their eyes have most likely degenerated. Your Brilliant Light: Blind won’t be useful against them!” Nanyu reminded him.

Zhao Manyan’s expression immediately darkened as if he had accidentally f**ked a dog. {TL Note: A modern Chinese slang that is commonly used for self-mocking purposes.}

As a Magician whose primary Element was Light and secondary Element was Water, the most effective offensive spell he had was Brilliant Light: Blind. If the spell was not effective against the creature, he basically had no other move!

How about his Intermediate Water Spell, Rolling Wave? His opponent was a sea monster! If he cast the Rolling Wave at the creature, it might even reflect it back at him. Wouldn’t he be lifting a rock only to drop it on his own feet!?

Nanyu was left speechless. Could this Zhao Manyan be any more useless? Did he really consider Brilliant Light: Blind an offensive spell?

“Move aside!” Nanyu snapped, believing it was hopeless to count on him. Zhao Manyan backed off without hesitation.

“Killing Tone: Bow!” Nanyu straightened up. She opened her mouth slightly and produced a sound that was impossible for ordinary people to make.

The sound of a bowstring being released twanged out of nowhere. The note that Nanyu made turned into a sonic wave resembling an arrow, shooting rapidly at the Jagged-Paw Green Demon!

The Jagged-Paw Green Demon could not react in time. It was knocked flying by the sonic arrow.

The impact of the sonic wave was incredibly powerful. Zhao Manyan could hear the creature’s bones breaking as the sonic wave struck it, sending it flying into the opposite building.

More shockingly, the trail of the arrow was vaguely visible, extending from the building they were on and across the street. It was over twenty meters long!

“Awesome!” It was Zhao Manyan’s first time seeing the Sound Element in action. His thoughts were still stuck on the sight of Nanyu firing the sonic arrow.

“Just focus on protecting us,” Nanyu was not in the mood to fool around with Zhao Manyan. She heard quite a number of Jagged-Paw Green Demons climbing up the building.

“Leave it to me, the sea monsters won’t even touch a single strand of your hair!” said Zhao Manyan confidently.

When it came to defense, no one on the team was better than him. Looking at it seriously, Zhao Manyan actually had the same ancestor as these sea monsters. He was referred to as the Turtle Shell Magician!

Nan Rongni’s life was still in danger. The pained expression on her face showed no sign of fading away. It was likely that the White Sobbing Demon’s tentacle had other unknown effects. Not only was the pain lasting for a long time, it also hindered the effects of the Healing Spell.

“Should we have someone escort you to the safe zone first?” Nanyu asked when she realized that Nan Rongni’s condition was not improving.

“Don’t...don’t worry about me, the sea monsters are...are all around the place, you’ll need to spare a few people to escort me to the safe zone, I’m...I’m fine, I just need a rest,” Nan Rongni refused, showing her strength of will.

Nanyu did not force her. After all, the battle was indeed not as easy as they had imagined.
