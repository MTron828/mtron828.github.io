Chapter 1551 Catching Everything in One Ne

Translated by XephiZ

In addition to the snake and scorpion demons, the undead, mostly mummies, gradually showed up, too. Cairo was already struggling to fend off the snake and scorpion demons, and now the undead army that was so tough to kill with its overwhelming numbers was pressing forward, too. It was difficult to tell how long Cairo could defend itself!

Cairo was in the worst situation possible. Half of the city had been taken by the undead. They had slowly reclaimed their land after holing up and waiting patiently for a long time.

The deathlight of the Pyramid of Khafre reached even further away than it usually did. The deathlight covered the entire city, and awakened the undead scattered across Gisele and the Bargo Land.

The longer the deathlight lasted, the more likely the mummies that were in deeper slumber would awaken. Even though Cairo’s army was very experienced at defending the city, their defense would collapse without a doubt once a few Pharaohs showed up!

Thanks to the undead, the Battlemages no longer had time to waste on Mo Fan and the others!

There were a few patrol Mages still chasing them. A few squads showed up to intercept them, too, but as long as it was not a troop full of Intermediate Mages, they had no chance of stopping the three Advanced Mages.

Breaking into the city with force was a lot easier than they had imagined. That being said, they were not relieved at all, as their destination was obviously a lot more dangerous than just breaking into the city. They were going straight for the central military base!

The base was the army’s headquarters, so the people in it were at least officers. There were captains all over the place, too...

“Mo Fan, are you sure she’s at the headquarters?” Heidi asked him.

“Mm, I left some Dark Material on her, but it’s very faint,” Mo Fan replied.

The trio managed to shake the soldiers chasing them off after crossing a district. They had successfully snuck into the city. Mo Fan did not want to waste even a second further, as he still might be able to save Apas’ life.

Fenna had brought them to the military base before. Mo Fan homed in along the trail left by the Dark Material. The base was exactly where the trail was leading them to, but the Dark Material was too faint. He was unsure if Apas was still alive, but if he was in the evil soldiers’ shoes, Apas would be long gone by now!

“Let’s go and save Zhao Manyan first, we’ll be a lot safer with his help,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan had to struggle to cast powerful spells when he was surrounded by too many soldiers. However, if Zhao Manyan was around, he could easily blast the enemy with his spells without worrying about his safety!

“But we don’t know where he is!” Mu Bai protested.

“I do,” Mo Fan said.

Zhao Manyan always carried his national team Emblem. The Emblem was made of some special substance. Most warding spells could only shorten an Emblem’s signal, instead of completely blocking off the communication between them!

Zhao Manyan should not be imprisoned too far away from Apas. Mo Fan believed the Emblem would start glowing once he reached the place. He had to save the idiot first, to increase their odds of saving Apas!

The fortress in the central base had an underground chamber used to lock up soldiers that had severely violated military law. However, many people were unaware of another level of cells beneath it, where some secret operations were going on.

The issue of the European University Institute’s students was rather sensitive. Captain Saks could not afford to let the others know about their existence, so they were all locked up in the secret prison. Every cell was covered by powerful magic, preventing the prisoners from casting any spells.

“Are my students alright?” Vani asked worriedly.

“Don’t worry, they are fine. We aren’t a bunch of bandits, why would we do anything to them?” Captain Saks laughed.

“Humph, don’t let me see that Mo Fan again, or I swear I’m going to skin him alive!” Gangma grunted.

Gangma had been greatly tortured by Mo Fan. The wounds still hurt even now, but luckily, Vani had been smart enough to escort him here safely.

Vani took a few steps forward, and saw his students sitting in the cells in low spirits. They seemed to be overwhelmed by fatigue, but apart from a little frostbite, they did not have any injuries.

Vani let out a relieved sigh when he saw they were alive.

It was fine as long as everyone was still alive. If any of them died, the European University Institute was definitely going to fire him! On top of that, these students were all from formidable backgrounds and factions. They would clearly hold him responsible, too! Even if he blamed it on the Egyptian army, they would not dare to trouble a country’s army, meaning that he would still have to take the blame! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Vani walked to the cells and called out, “That’s great, you all are still alive!”

“Mr. Vani, you came to save us. What did I tell you? If we placed our hope in Mo Fan, our hair would have turned gray by the time he showed up!” Galba exclaimed.

“He was so full of himself. If he didn’t provoke the giant snake, we wouldn’t even be here in the first place!” Ferrero sneered.

Zhao Manyan looked up and stared at Gangma and Captain Saks behind Vani.

Zhao Manyan might be trapped in ice, but he had clearly seen Mo Fan seizing Gangma as a hostage to guarantee their safety, yet the man had now returned...

He could guess with his toes that Vani must have secretly brought him back here!

They were in deep trouble; Mo Fan no longer had a bargaining chip! If the military was vicious enough, the soldiers might kill them all at any time!

Zhao Manyan did not feel relieved at all. He noticed Gangma and Captain Saks whispering to one another...

“What now? Should we release them?” Captain Saks asked softly.

“Are you out of your mind? Of course we can’t let them go! Lock this Vani up, too! We’ll deal with them later. There are three others still on the loose. They are clearly no ordinary people, judging from their strength. We should get our hands on them first, then decide what to do about them!” Gangma said coldly.

If they were planning to silence them all, they had to catch everyone first! If they decided to kill the hostages now, the other three would immediately run away and sue them at the International Court of Justice. The Egyptian army might not be afraid of the International Court of Justice, but it would still be very troublesome for them!

Their best option was to catch the rest, and then decide to either silence them or let them go!

Captain Saks looked at Gangma and saw a vicious look in his eyes. If they did get their hands on the rest that were on the loose, he believed Gangma was more inclined to silence them permanently!
