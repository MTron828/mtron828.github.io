3064 Never Misjudged

The courtyard was filled with gray and white statues. Michael held a carving knife and carefully polished the patterns on the marble statue. It was the statue of a mermaid. The mermaid statue was not fully clothed. Its lower half was carved with delicate thin scales as if clothing it with a special dress…

Haylon watched quietly by the side.

“You’re not here to catch up with me. You’re here to ensure I won’t do something outrageous. After all, Holy City and the Holy Palace hardly welcome a new Goddess. There is a certain period when Holy City and Parthenon Temple don’t go along with each other,” Michael finally said to Haylon.

“You haven’t returned the ancient Goddess’ orphan to us even today,” said Haylon without hesitation.

!!

It was an issue that happened many years ago. It did not happen in this era.

Holy City had killed Parthenon Temple’s Goddess.

They invited the Goddess to Holy City and the Holy Palace, only to control her in the same way as they did a heretic.

As Michael mentioned earlier, Haylon did not come to catch up with him.

Haylon came to set his sights on Michael.

Even though it was unlikely for Holy City to do so, Haylon refused to let history repeat itself.

“My craft is still not as skillful as yours. The scales that I carved look like scales. But the scales that you carved glowed in multicolor as if a real-life piece appeared before you…” Michael put down the carving knife and patted the stone dust on his body.

“You and I have different mentalities. I work hard to bring out the beauty of life in an object. You, on the other hand, turn all the beauty in life into your personal collection,” said Haylon.

“You’re right. Speaking of which, I truly wish you were here to catch up with me. I would be very happy from the bottom of my heart. After all, it’s been a long while since an old friend of mine came to visit me. My craft is far inferior to you, but your battle prowess is far inferior to mine,” said Michael to Haylon.

Haylon stared at Michael. He noticed Michael’s gaze looked wild and savage. Michael’s imposing aura made him look like a savage beast. Haylon was just a young elk before him.

Michael was right.

His level of strength had reached a realm beyond human limits.

Even though Haylon possessed Holy Soul Hades, it was hard for him to fight against Michael.

Michael grew increasingly powerful. This was especially after he returned to Holy City.

A majority of the mages who had achieved the realm of the Forbidden Curse had extreme difficulty in taking another step forward. After all, the Forbidden Curse itself had broken through human limits. However, Michael continued to undergo his transformation and surpassed the mages exponentially!

Haylon sucked in a deep breath. He was shocked to sense Michael’s intense aura.

However, Haylon was not intimidated. He fixed his gaze on Michael. If Michael wanted to lay his hand on them, Haylon would not give in to him.

…

Outside the Holy Palace, the Golden Sun Knights lined up and marched under the sun in Holy City. They marched toward First Avenue.

The Holy Judges did not let down their guard. The streets were cleared. They watched the Parthenon Temple knights and the Goddess leave. The sand-golden light that fell on them made them look even more majestic and holy.

After the knights went farther away, the people in Holy City expressed their envy for them. Parthenon Temple’s extravagance certainly exceeded that of Holy City…

“My lady, Michael’s level of strength is second to God only. Moreover, he is the chief of the archangels. Even if the twelve Knights of Seals have their Holy Souls awakened, we are still no match for Michael,” Haylon walked up to Ye Xinxia’s side and whispered to her.

Ye Xinxia turned her head around wistfully and cast a glance at the gilded Holy Palace.

“Ramiel has been keeping a close watch on him too. Besides, the courtyard is filled with seals…” Ye Xinxia was annoyed.

In fact, she brought the bizarre Star Bugs that Mo Fan needed during the visitation.

Unfortunately, she did not have the opportunity to hand them over to him.

Not only did Ramiel keep a close eye on them, but Mo Fan’s surroundings were also filled with seals. Regardless of how good she was at handling the bizarre Star Bugs over to him without anyone noticing, it would immediately trigger the seals…

Mo Fan also noticed that the archangels grew increasingly strict in setting their sights on him. Therefore, he tried to hint at Ye Xinxia through his eyes to stop her from taking any action.

At that moment, Ye Xinxia had to give up. After all, the place was filled with seals. If they angered the people of Holy City, Michael could make Ye Xinxia stay in Holy City. By then, there would be no turning point.

It looked like she had to find another way.

…

Ye Xinxia did not stay around somewhere near Holy City. She returned to Greece.

She returned the artifact box that was filled with the bizarre Star Bugs to Mu Bai. Mu Bai was not surprised by the outcome of her visitation.

Ye Xinxia was the only one who could see Mo Fan. But Ramiel and Michael could not possibly make such a low-level mistake.

They must have also considered the possibility of Mo Fan using a certain strange spell to break the divine oath. Therefore, the prison was equipped with foolproof security.

It was already risky to let Ye Xinxia enter Holy City. Holy City had been laying its eyes on Parthenon Temple like hungry wolves. After Ye Xinxia became the Goddess, the archangels simply did not mess with her.

It had been a long time since Parthenon Temple had a Goddess. Holy City constantly oppressed them.

She could only hand the task of passing the bizarre Star Bugs to Mo Fan to others.

Ye Xinxia had to focus on several forces. No matter what, she must not let Holy City collect six black stones. Otherwise, it would truly be the end for Mo Fan!

…

The time interval of the trial became shorter. It looked like Holy City gradually lost its patience.

They were anxious to get rid of Mo Fan. Several angels had been pressurizing the other important forces. The angels requested the forces to vote for the black stone.

Unfortunately, after several hearings, the forces revealed the side they were on by giving Holy City an unsatisfactory answer.

As the chief of the divine magistrate, Ramiel was so angry that he almost wanted to pry open the brains of those who had not expressed the party they supported.

Why did they have to put in so much effort in convicting the Wicked God? Moreover, Mo Fan had killed Parade Angel Shalitha!

There were seven archangels in Holy City.

Shalitha was to be crowned as one of the seven leaders in Holy City.

Mo Fan was filled with a dark aura and evil powers. Shouldn’t he be cast into hell for killing an angelic leader?!

What power did Mo Fan have that even Holy City could do nothing to him?!

…

“Michael, I think everything you said is correct. Certain things are not as simple as we thought,” said Ramiel sulkily after he left the Holy Court.

“There are many extraordinary people in this world. Many of them are more gifted than me, but they never bother me. Instead, I admire them more than everyone else. This is because I believe extraordinary people will never cause an upheaval. In fact, some people are born to wreak havoc, and these people will lead to endless strife. I always have a good sense of judgment,” said Michael to Ramiel.
