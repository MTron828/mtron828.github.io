Chapter 2445: Leading Dragon Beasts

Mo Fan believed it was fine being a gigolo at times. He just had to pick a random creature and ride it. No one would dare to look at him provokingly!

“Brother Mo Fan, I’ll think of a way,” Xinxia told him.

“No, it’s fine, the three of us are only looking for mounts. The Flying Dragon suits us best. We can switch to a stronger mount once we are stronger,” Mo Fan said quickly.

Tamed Beasts were not as reliable as Summoned Beasts. Even a Five-Star Tamed Beast might revolt if their master was not significantly stronger than them.

The stronger a Tamed Beast, the higher its intelligence. The chains binding their hearts would loosen up gradually as they spent more time with their master. They would eventually betray their master and escape one day.

Tamed Beasts could also not be stored in another dimension like Summoned Beasts and Contracted Beasts could, and they were not allowed in the cities if their levels were too high. If Mo Fan received a Five-Star Tamed Beast from Xinxia, he would have nowhere to keep it!

It would be easier if it was a Six-Star Tamed Beast, which he could just keep at Fanxue Mountain. He would have to live in the mountains away from the cities if he had a Five-Star Tamed Beast!

“Mm, it’s important to reach a Tamed Level of six stars,” Xinxia agreed on the phone.

It was important for a Tamed Beast to be obedient. The Parthenon Temple had few outstanding Six-Star Tamed Beasts. The Radiance Unicorns were the only Six-Star Tamed Beasts it had at present.

Unfortunately, the Radiance Unicorns were only willing to be mounts to those with the unique Blessing Aura of the Parthenon Temple’s Muses. Ordinary people had difficulties approaching Radiance Unicorns.

Xinxia had one to ride. Mo Fan had tried touching it, but the creature had regarded him with disdain.

Zhao Manyan quickly asked about the outcome after Mo Fan hung up the call.

It was inconvenient not having a reliable mount after reaching the Super Level. Mo Fan might be a Summoner, but the old wolf was from a different dimension. He was not on standby twenty-four hours a day. He had his own battles to fight in the Summoned Beast Plane.

Besides, the old wolf was more of a fighter. He was not good at rapid travel over land and water. He also lacked endurance compared to Tamed Beasts who were specifically trained to be mounts. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Fan was starting to regret using his second Contract on Apas!

Not only was he unable to ride her, she kept playing mind games with him and only knew to act coquettishly around him. All his problems would be solved if he had a strong and reliable Contracted Beast instead!

“Ayleen invited us to her place,” Mo Fan relayed to them.

“Huh? Are we going overseas again? I haven’t even enjoyed myself after coming back,” Zhao Manyan half-protested.

“I’m a Summoner, so I don’t really need a Tamed Beast. If anything, I can just find a flying creature with my Dimensional Summoning to make up for it,” Mo Fan said indifferently.

“Damn it, what do you mean? Fine, we’ll go! It’s just a renowned clan in England who’s even richer than my family! Do you think I’m scared of them?!” Zhao Manyan was desperate to get his hands on a Flying Dragon.

Mu Bai was more interested in the technology Ayleen’s clan had used to tame the Flying Dragons. He knew the technology would be confidential, but he might learn something when they visited Ayleen and in doing so expand his knowledge on raising his insects.

“I feel like Ayleen will need a favor from us,” Mo Fan commented.

“Well, we don’t have the money to afford the Flying Dragons, so we can only work for them. It’s nothing,” Zhao Manyan had to agree.

“Does that mean we might get ourselves a Flying Dragon each?” Mu Bai’s eyes glittered.

“She said she has another species that is better than the Flying Dragons that are being sold on the market…”

Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai immediately became more energetic.

“By the way, the government has canceled a lot of flights. We won’t be able to leave the country easily,” Mu Bai said after recalling the latest news.

“We’ll just ask Ayleen to arrange a private jet for us. Besides, we no longer have to worry about that once we have the Flying Dragons. We can fly wherever we want and visit any country!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed enthusiastically.

——

Ayleen was a true heroine. She immediately made the arrangements when she heard about the strict restrictions on international flights.

A Flying Dragon landed on a helipad at Fangxue Mountain the next morning. A middle-aged man in a butler’s outfit was waiting for them.

“Are you three Duchess Ayleen’s honorable guests?” the butler asked with a smile.

“Ugh… this private jet isn’t bad, either!” Mo Fan had to admit.

“Come, let’s pay England a visit!”

“We’ll be crossing a few infamous mountain ranges, so the journey might be a little dangerous, but don’t you worry, the Flying Dragon’s presence will stop ordinary demon creatures from troubling us,” the butler informed them.

“Sure, let’s go!”

The land was spreading before them like a giant painting. Some gray-blue areas were occasionally visible meandering to the east.

Thick white clouds like a sea of bubbles were floating under them. It felt like they could just walk on the clouds while the bright sunlight was shining on them from above.

The air was slightly chilly, but it was fresh and clean compared to the air below the clouds.

The Flying Dragons were able to fly above the clouds. Even though they were covered in sturdy scales, their scales were almost combined with their skin. The strong cold wind could not inflict any damage on their skin, making it useful when flying at great altitude. They could also avoid the brainless demon creatures and prevent unwanted troubles.

“General Zhang, these dragon beasts are so much better than our Heavenly Eagles. The Heavenly Eagles have to rest and eat after flying for two to three hours. It was a waste of time and effort just to find a safe landing spot, but now, we can fly for a whole day after buying these Flying Dragons. We will arrive at our destination soon!” Advisor Tan Feng spoke up.

“Isn’t that right? A bunch of Predator Demon Hawks just flew right past us. I was ready for a fight, but they ran away as soon as they saw the dragon beasts. It feels good to have green lights throughout the journey!” a soldier exclaimed excitedly.

“General Zhang, why are you so quiet?” another soldier asked.

Zhang Xiaohou collected his thoughts and looked behind him.

Even though the Triumphant Eagle Dragons were only Pseudo-dragons, they were covered in sturdy scales and had powerful eagle’s claws. They were strong enough to lift an armored Commander-level creature a thousand meters into the sky!

The soldiers behind him were each riding a Triumphant Eagle Dragon. It was impressive when over fifty Triumphant Eagle Dragons were beating their wings and flying in pattern.

Zhang Xiaohou was quiet because he was recalling the dream he had a long time ago.

When he had first joined the army, his greatest dream was to become an officer, even if it was only the lowest rank. He just wanted to have a Heavenly Eagle as his mount!

He formed the dream when he saw Zhan Kong and his men leaving on their Heavenly Eagles to hunt the Darkwing Wolf.

But now, he was riding Flying Dragons and dragon beasts!

He was riding a Flying Dragon and leading his men on their dragon beasts!
