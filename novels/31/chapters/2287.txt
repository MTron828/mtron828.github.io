The Circle of Crystal Teeth did not hinder Mo Fan from using his magic.

The Lightning Acupuncture Points on Mo Fan’s upper body lit up during the time that the Circle of Crystal Teeth and Star Dust had bought him. More lines intertwined on Mo Fan’s skin.

The Aura alone was utterly terrifying, even before the magic was unleashed!

Previously, when Mo Fan had crossed his arms to construct a Star Pattern with the Lightning Acupuncture Points, the lightning flashing across the sky above Banlo City had been assisting him.

This time, a huge lightning explosion suddenly took place in the city as Mo Fan activated half of his Lightning Acupuncture Points to construct a Star Palace!

Lightning was arcing everywhere in the city. There were quite a lot of Lightning Mages in the city right now.

The moment Mo Fan activated his Lightning Acupuncture Points, every circuit, wire, and electrical appliance in the city exploded simultaneously..

The city fell into darkness following it. The whole area was suddenly as dead silent as if a blackout had occurred.

The plaza of the Furniture District was on the city’s west side, between the residential areas and the commercial areas.

The whole city had lost power, except for the Furniture District. The dark city and the gloomy sky were brightly lit up by the lightning arcs shining down like the sun upon it!

The lightning arcs were the Star Palace Mo Fan’s Lightning Acupuncture Points were constructing!

The Star Palace was not formless or just an energy-transferring medium. It was an actual palace made of lightning!

The magnificent palace was a great calamity that had fallen to the mundane world from the Heavens. The ground of the mundane world had no chance of withstanding its weight.

Every building in its area was destroyed completely.

Every person caught in its lightning was turned into ashes!

The Furniture District was flattened very suddenly. The buildings inside an area over ten thousand meters square turned into ashes. The Mages of the Brown Army were falling to the ground like ants and insects, together with the falling trees they were hanging onto.

Those who were caught by the slightest arc of lightning from the Lightning Palace vanished into thin air with the buildings.

Everyone was struggling to keep their eyes open. They almost fainted upon witnessing the astonishing sight after their vision recovered.

The buildings in the Furniture District were gone. Mages were moaning in pain on the ground. The number of Mages who had gathered at the plaza was clearly a lot higher than the ones who had survived.

“Is...is he still human?”

The choir was dumbfounded. They could not sing even a single note right now.

The Mages on the streets froze as if a blizzard had just swept through the area. Only a few minor spells were still lingering in the air, like little sparrows in front of a huge dragon.

The people were too shocked to notice the dark swamp that was appearing under their feet.

The streets were suddenly covered in a dark ooze, as if the roads had melted. Not only was it emitting a foul smell, it was extremely sticky, and was grabbing firmly at the Mages’ feet.

An icy dark aura slowly penetrated their bodies through their feet. The Mages who had yet to recover from the great shock were soon trembling in fear!

What if the Lightning Palace had targeted them? They would have perished like ashes, regardless of their numbers!

“Attack, attack now, kill them at all costs!” Cook yelled. “What are you waiting for? You bunch of useless pricks! Captains, commander, give your orders at once!”

Cook could not care less about the casualties. His only thought was to stop the monster from getting away!

“The loss is nothing compared to the war we are about to fight. Kill them, and we’re one step closer to victory!” Cook shouted at the Mages overwhelmed by fear.

It was not like Mo Fan’s Superpower had truly frightened them. Anything could happen in a war, even though Mo Fan’s strength was rather ridiculous.

However, Cook, Wolf Chief, and the female commander had not noticed Mo Fan’s Shadow Magic spreading to the other side of the bridge.

The Dark Swamp was an evolved version of the Nyx Regime. It did not have to attack the soldiers. It just needed to enhance the fear and panic in their hearts!

The Brown Army’s numbers might be overwhelming, but its soldiers were mostly low-level Mages. Mo Fan’s powerful Shadow Magic could easily suppress them!

Mo Fan had caused massive destruction with the Lightning Palace, and was using the Dark Swamp to pressure thousands of Mages on the other side of the bridge.

He had crushed the enemies in front of them with the Lightning Palace, and kept the enemies behind at bay with the Shadow Element, giving him and his friends the perfect chance to escape!

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai did not hesitate. They forced their way through the debris in the plaza instead of retreating. There were a lot of enemies?still?behind them, but Mo Fan’s lightning had cleared a huge path ahead!

The choir was overwhelmed by the fear coming from the Dark Swamp. They were not able to interrupt Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan’s magic in time.

Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan immediately took over Mo Fan’s role and charged forward recklessly once they were able to use their Advanced and Super Spells.

“Rapid Growth of All Things!”

Mu Bai was in charge of stopping the enemies behind them. He tossed some special magic seeds in all directions. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The seeds would cause the things they came into contact with to grow rapidly, including a human’s body.

A huge forest appeared out of nowhere while the Brown Army was still gaping in shock. It forcibly created a national park in the middle of the warzone!

Thick vines were intertwining like spider webs. The sturdy trunks were as tall as buildings, while the branches were dangling from the trees like curtains.

Still, Cook’s shouts were quite effective at helping the soldiers come back to their senses.

However, all they could see were green plants when they began searching for their targets. The twisting vines were like a bunch of snakes woven together!

“F**king useless, you can’t even stop three people from running away, yet you are thinking of seizing control of a country?” Cook was so mad that he felt like tearing his scalp off.

He vented all his anger on the female commander. After all, she was the person in charge of the regiment.

“It was you who underestimated the enemy’s strength, resulting in unnecessary casualties to my regiment,” the commander scoffed. She was coldly amused by Cook’s attempt to put the blame on her.

“It seems like a regiment alone isn’t enough to take them down,” Wolf Chief spoke up calmly, after collecting his thoughts.

“There’s nothing the Brown Army can’t do. We can easily seize control of a country! If a regiment isn’t enough, we’ll send two. If two isn’t enough, we’ll send three or four regiments after them. If a thousand people aren’t enough, we’ll send ten thousand people… the Brown Army is unstoppable!” Cook yelled like a mad man.
