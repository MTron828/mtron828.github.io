Breathing out, white mist spread to the side of the lips. The weather was getting colder, it would start snowing in less than a month.

Yao Nan glanced at the frozen Corpse Official and discovered that its veins were blocked because of the frost. The poison had penetrated through the creature’s greasy and transparent fat, making its way toward the undead crystal inside its stomach... ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A huge chunk of ice fell from the huge Icebound Coffin. The piece that broke off was made of the Corpse Official’s frozen flesh.

Soon, other body parts reacted the same way, huge chunks of frozen meat fell to the ground.

“I’ll be taking the Soul Remnant!” Yao Nan took out an undead container and acquired the Soul Remnant of the frozen creature.

Wings appeared on his back. With a soft flap, the wings lifted Yao Nan into the gray sky. The black sandstorm behind him gradually dispersed after the death of the Corpse Official, no longer posing any threat to the army.

Flying above a huge pack of zombies, Mo Fan saw flames burning across a large area on the ground. The flames were not far away from where he was fighting the battle, too. As he recalled, he did remember that he had thrown the kid Mo Fan down around here?

As he glanced down, he could see scorched corpses everywhere, and in addition to that, he could also see Mo Fan standing in the circles of flames, with a wolf-type creature whose body was covered with scratches and poison standing beside him.

“Not bad, you’re still alive! Any other Intermediate Magician wouldn’t have lasted even a few minutes after falling into the middle of zombies like that!” Yao Nan landed and handed a seemingly expensive serum to Mo Fan, “Use this, or else your Summoned Beast will die soon after the wounds fester!”

Mo Fan quickly applied the serum to the wounds that were affected by the poison. He was not feeling too pleasant after seeing his wolf’s dying expression.

The Swift Star Wolf had been fighting against a Poison Tumor Corpse General on its own. On top of that, there were hundreds of zombies trying to tear him apart, too. He could not stay in the flames as he was not immune to Fire, thus the battle was incredibly tough for him!

After applying the antidote on the Swift Star Wolf’s body, the shocking wounds soon showed signs of recovering on their own. Mo Fan was instantly relieved.

The Swift Star Wolf was a creature with outstanding self-healing ability. Many of the minor injuries would simply recover after the end of a battle, but when affected by the poison, the Swift Star Wolf would lose his life force too fast.

“Your antidote is pretty good, where did you buy it?” asked Mo Fan when he saw that the poison affecting the Swift Star Wolf was almost cleansed.

“I made it myself,” replied Yao Nan with a smile.

“You’re a pharmacist?” Mo Fan asked in astonishment, looking at Yao Nan.

“Yeah, my third Element is Poison,” said Yao Nan.

“Poison?” Mo Fan’s eyes widened. It was his first time hearing about that Element.

“Black Magic: Poison Element. Seems like you’re quite the ignorant one, but it’s true that this Element is very rare in our nation. It’s more common in foreign countries,” said Yao Nan.

“Right, I’ve never seen a Magician with Poison Element before. By the way, I’ve never seen the infamous Undead Element from the list of Black Magic Elements, either. Is it an Element that’s more common in foreign countries, too?” Mo Fan continued to treat the Swift Star Wolf’s wounds.

“You can find Undead Element in our country too, but because the Magic deals with dead things most of the time, it’s easy to violate the code of conduct established by the Magic Association. Normally, Magicians with Undead Element don’t usually show themselves... Besides, some Elements can only be Awakened at higher levels, such as Secondary Magic like the Space Element, Music Element, Chaos Element, and so forth. Basically, Basic and Intermediate Magicians will only be looking at Elemental Magic, but at Advanced Level, they have more chance of interacting with Black Magic, White Magic, and Secondary Magic,” said Yao Nan.

Mo Fan nodded. It turned out that he was still at the bottom of the Magic Pyramid. The vast world of Magic was still not something he could peek at now!

Mo Fan did admit that his life motto of trying to maintain the world’s peace and protect the millions of girls in the cities was overly fake. However, the drive to pursue greater Magic was long implanted deep inside his heart. He could not help but feel excited when he heard Yao Nan mentioning that he had a chance of Awakening other types of Magic after reaching the Advanced Level.

What cool Elements would he Awaken with his Double Innate Elements at the Advanced Level?

“I can see that your Fire Element Nebula is pretty much saturated. You’re not that far away from achieving the Advanced Level. Keep it up! Oh, here is the Soul Remnant you asked for, as your reward for helping me to deal with the little mobs,” Yao Nan shoved the container into Mo Fan’s hands.

Mo Fan did not reject it. He secretly placed the Commander-level Soul Remnant into the Little Loach Pendant when Yao Nan was not paying attention to him...

Both the Iron Arms Corpse General and the Poison-spitting Corpse General did not drop any Soul Essence. The zombies burned to their death by the flames did not drop any natural Soul Essences, either. He initially thought he would be able to level his Fire Element up to the fourth level, but he was still four Stars short!

It was hard to tell if the Little Loach could refine any Soul Essence from the Commander-level Soul Remnant. Even Servant-class Soul Essences were sufficient.

“Let’s go, the Light Formations are activated. They are most likely going to be surrounded by countless zombies and Corpse Generals. We won’t have any chance of regrouping with the army. Let’s head back to the walls and watch there,” Yao Nan lifted Mo Fan up as his wings began to beat rapidly.

Yao Nan had fulfilled his role after escorting the squad to the destination. He would leave the rest to the Commanders and the experts among the Hunters...

Mo Fan was worn out from the previous battle, too. Apart from his Shadow Element, the energy of his other three Elements was basically depleted. That old jerk Zhu Meng would no longer be able to blame him for not contributing...

Flying through the air, Mo Fan was able to observe a wider area. He shockingly discovered that not only did the number of zombies show no signs of going down, there were more Corpse Generals than before, too!

Corpse Generals already posed a great threat to many Magicians. Mo Fan was able to see lots of Corpse Generals making their way toward the army...

Mo Fan thought handling five Small Corpse Generals on his own was his limit, yet there were even Giant Corpse Generals among the dozens of Corpse Generals making their way toward the army. He immediately felt his scalp turning numb!

Glancing further into the distance, he could see a few creatures as huge as hills among the army of undead. Their roars were clear even from the walls a few dozen kilometers away. Every attack they made would shake the sky and cause the ground to sink...

Commander-level undead, those Commander-level undead giants were standing among the dense army of undead. The spells hitting them in the form of colorful rainbows were merely making them sway slightly!
