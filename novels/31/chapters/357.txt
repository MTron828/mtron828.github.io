Chapter 360: Threat-Elimination Strategy

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

“Relax, Senator Zhu Meng, I believe that you’re well aware of the Skyscraping Snake’s capabilities. The situation would be a lot worse if you were to trouble him with such a strong murderous intent. We have to take it slowly,” said an aged elder of the Magic Court with a smile.

“Enough with the nonsense, you won’t be able to make excuses for him this time!” Zhu Meng demanded. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Make excuses, why would we need to do that? The Black Totem Snake has been living in this city for God knows how many years. It’s his habitat. I seriously don’t understand what right we have to drive him away?” An elder who was obviously on the side of protecting the Totem Beast said in a righteous tone.

“It’s your Totem. It has nothing to do with us. All I care about is whether this beast will pose a threat to us!” said Zhu Meng.

“I think you’re not worried about the Black Totem Snake disrupting peace. You’re just concerned that as long as he’s still here, your threat-elimination strategy would never be in full swing, thus it won’t be able to get you more supporters, which means you will never become the President of the Magic Palace!”

Zhu Meng glanced at the old man with a goatee and burst out laughing.

The elder with the goatee harrumphed coldly in return. No one in the meeting dared to offend this senator from the Enforcement Union, but he, Luo Mian, was never afraid of him.

Luo Mian was also a senator himself, but he would never allow the Black Totem Snake to be sacrificed as a stepping stone for someone pursuing power!

“I’ll make this clear, Senator Luo Mian. The demon god that they worshipped is harming humans. If you think I’m purposely picking on him, go ahead and try calming the public after the terror that arose recently. Comfort the people living in this city. I bet you can publicly admit that you’re worshipping a gigantic snake, and see what they would think!” said Zhu Meng.

The guardian of the Totem Beast, Tangyue finally ran out of patience and blurted out, “The Black Totem Snake would never harm anyone. How do you prove that the two corpses were his doing?”

“Where did this brat come from? Do you have the right to speak here!” a Palace Guard standing beside Senator Zhu Meng snapped.

Zhu Meng cast a glance at Tangyue and immediately recognized her. He waved his hand, signaling the Royal Guard to stand down.

“Everything has to come with the evidence. Don’t you think it’s hilarious accusing the Black Totem Snake for the deaths of two random corpses you found?” snapped Tangyue.

“Tangyue, enough with that, back off.” The Head of the Magic Court, Tang Zhong rose to his feet and glanced at Zhu Meng, “My niece is right. The accusation needs to be backed up with evidence. If our Totem Beast truly wants to kill, I don’t think he would leave the corpses behind, either. Why would there be two rotten corpses that were only discovered a week after the incident... Or maybe you think you can treat us like retards and just falsely accuse our Totem Beast of being responsible for the deaths of the two corpses!”

“That’s right, we have to investigate the matter further,” said a mediator.

“Investigations aren’t my specialty. My job is to eliminate any possible threats. The fact that he had shown himself in the busy city is enough to list him as our highest priority target. You have two days to hand over the Black Totem Snake, or I’ll deal with him myself!” Zhu Meng pointed with two fingers in a fairly strong attitude.

“You’re unbelievable. Stop using your bullshit threat-elimination strategy to condemn our Totem Beast!” the old man with the goatee roared furiously.

“I’m a senator. I have the highest authority granted by the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Magic Palace. Now, if I say he’s a threat, he is a threat!” Zhu Meng had no intention to waste his time further with the stubborn people defending their Totem Beast.

The Black Totem Snake had posed a threat to the city with its sudden appearance. There were casualties being discovered. The people would demand an explanation from the government. Be it a decree or the will of the people, the Black Totem Snake would be eliminated!

Zhu Meng brought his Royal Guards and left, leaving the room of people speechless.

Those who were neutral and leaning toward the Oriental Pearl Tower and Magic Palace took their leave.

The outcome was basically decided. Zhu Meng had come with a strong statement and evidence. The Black Totem Snake would not be able to escape this time.

Most of the people attending the meeting had left, with only the Head of the Magic Court, Tang Zhong; the old man with the goatee, Luo Mian; the man with the long black hair, Heiyu; Tangyue, and Mo Fan left.

“I didn’t expect it to turn out like this, when we’ve been extremely cautious protecting it,” Tang Zhong sighed. He looked rather tired.

“What should we do now? Zhu Meng is resolved to deal with the Totem Beast. He has the upper hand this time. Even if we were to submit a written statement to a higher authority, we won’t be able to calm the crowd,” said Heiyu.

“I think that Zhu Meng is just trying to act tough. If he wants to take on the Totem Beast, just let him do it. If he could outmatch the Black Totem Snake, he would have already done so ages ago, why would he wait until today... he’s just scared of the Totem Beast’s strength,” said Senator Luo Mian, while stroking his goatee.

“Senator Luo, you might not know this... the Totem Beast undergoes ecdysis every ten years. He only showed himself in the city because he is rather hot-tempered during this period. His strength would be significantly weaker during ecdysis,” said Tang Zhong.

“Are you implying that he will be having his ecdysis soon?” Luo Mian was stunned.

“Absolutely.”

“That’s troublesome. This Zhu Meng knew how to pick the right time...”

“We think there’s a traitor among us,” said Heiyu in a soft voice.

It was too much of a coincidence. Zhu Meng had been demanding because he was well prepared.

It was most likely that the traitor had told Zhu Meng about the ecdysis.

“Tangyue, I want you to bring the Totem Beast away in advance, and find a safe place for him to finish his ecdysis,” said Tang Zhong.

“Mm, got it,” Tangyue nodded.

“I’ll be responsible for their safety, then,” said Heiyu.

Tang Zhong shook his head and said, “The Totem Beast is very sensitive during this period. He will be hostile toward any Commander-level demon beast or Advanced Magicians within twenty li of him. Tang Zhong is the only person he will allow within this distance...”

Tang Zhong specifically glanced at Mo Fan and immediately saw his cultivation without asking. “This young Magician isn’t Advanced Level yet, so it shouldn’t be a problem for him.”

“Him? How could we let an outsider be in charge of something so important? Besides, would an Intermediate Magician be any use to us? The Royal Guards that Zhu Meng brought are all experts.” Heiyu immediately opposed the suggestion.

“Heiyu, you’re wrong about that. This young Magician might actually be a great use to us,” stated Tang Zhong.

Mo Fan, naturally, was utterly confused as he listened to the conversation.
