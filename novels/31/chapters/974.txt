Jiang Yu immediately asked the others to protect him when he realized that the situation did not seem right.

However, it turned out that everyone was pretty occupied. Mu Tingying was laying out her frost, trying to spread it across the stage. Meanwhile, Ai Jiangtu and the enemy’s captain Roberts were having a showdown on their own. They were both extremely strong, so it was unlikely that the outcome would be decided anytime soon.

Nanrong Ni too was unable to offer much help. She was only acting as support on the team. There was no way she could lend Jiang Yu a hand. It was a relief that the enemy did not come bother her.

Jiang Yu felt pretty helpless. In the end, he had no choice but to summon the Night Rakshasa back to his side. Otherwise, he would be the first person to be knocked out from the duel!

“His Summoned Beast has returned!” the big Wangchi shouted.

“Focus on the other one instead!” Fred said.

Fred actually wanted to fight Mo Fan the most. He immediately asked the huge man to attack at the same time.

“His Contracted Beast is a certain distance away from him. Let’s take him out as quickly as possible,” Fred said.

Little Flame Belle was in a bad mood after she just woke up from a deep sleep, and simply went on her own way. She almost charged into the enemy’s formation. She was keeping two of the Americans busy, who had to place all their attention on fighting Little Flame Belle just to prevent themselves from being injured.

“Do it quick, we can’t hold on for much longer. This Contracted Beast is too strong!” the golden-haired Maga said.

“You can count on me!”

Fred arrived above Mo Fan. The big Lucky Wang was in position, too.

“This guy still didn’t call his Contracted Beast back. He’s dead for sure!” Fred grinned.

A Summoner was extremely weak without the protection of their Summoned Beasts. Their big man and Fred immediately attacked without hesitation when they realized how slow their target was!

Fred had Wind Wings beating like a hummingbird on his back. He dove down rapidly, his body circled by a strong blue airflow.

The airflow flowed in a spiraling motion. Its pointy end was aimed right at Mo Fan!

On the ground, the huge bloke cast several Rock Barriers in a row to seal off Mo Fan’s escape routes. Mo Fan could only endure the approaching attack with his flesh.

Fred seemed to think that the power of the wind alone was nowhere enough. He quickly applied layers of ice chains around the wind. The blue airflow immediately combined with the thorny ice chains and plummeted with a terrifying force!

“Impressive teamwork!” Mo Fan lifted his eyes and studied the strong vortex of icy thorns.

Waving his arm, a huge electrical field appeared on the ground under Mo Fan’s feet. Dense lightning arcs spread rapidly like pythons, forming a sphere of lightning with Mo Fan at the center.

Purple-black lightning arcs swept past under Mo Fan’s feet. Rings of spiralling lightning circled around his arms!

“Lightning Arm!” Mo Fan did not bother dodging the attack. He simply threw his fist at the blue winds spinning with icy thorns!

Perhaps Mo Fan was too used to throwing Fiery Fist around recklessly, and so when he was casting the Advanced Lightning Spell, he always utilized his control of the Element to unleash the spell by punching out!

Black bolts of death soared into the sky, followed by purple-black lightning rings rising like dragons, a stunning sight!

The lightning death bolt fist slammed into Fred. The tremendous force of the lightning clashed fiercely with Fred’s strong vortex. A piercing and screeching ripple spread out from the impact!

The wild energy spread in all directions. The ground under Mo Fan’s feet immediately turned into debris. His clothes were torn apart, revealing the bloodstains left by the icy thorns.

It was obvious that someone would get hurt when two different forces clashed with one another directly. Not many people had the guts to use the approach that Mo Fan did.

Fred was in a worse state than Mo Fan, knocked flying by the impact. He was having trouble maintaining his balance even with the Wind Wings on his back. He fell to the ground around three hundred meters away. Purple-black lightning arcs were still flickering on his convulsing body!

“Fred!” Lucky Wang yelled, before staring at the lightning-cloaked Mo Fan with a stunned expression.

This Summoner... the word weak did not fit him at all, he was actually as strong as a monster!

The direct clash of their spells was so powerful that it had even knocked Fred, who had an advantage when fighting in the air, flying! He was too strong to be true!

“Lightning...Lightning Element!” Fred’s Armor was out. His defensive Equipment was the only reason that he managed to rise to his feet.

Fred wiped the dust from his face. He was looking very grim now.

He had made a mistake!

Normally, a Summoner needed a huge amount of resources to nurture their Summoned Beasts. After all, a powerful Summoned Beast basically allowed the Summoner to take on demon creatures of the same level. For example, if a Summoner in the Advanced Level was able to nurture their Contracted Beast to the Advanced Level, they would easily crush anyone at the same level. After all, it would usually take a whole team of Advanced Magicians to take on a Commander-level creature.

Mo Fan’s fiery Summoned Beast was ridiculously strong. Even its simplest fire magic was enough to force his teammates to flee for their lives.

Therefore, Fred had assumed Mo Fan had invested everything he had on the Summoned Beast. The personal strength and other two Elements of most Summoners like Mo Fan were usually quite weak!

Fred almost lost his mind he realized this guy was able to cast Silent Deadly Bolt with such outstanding control!

-F**k, how is his Lightning Element so strong, too!?-

“Should we focus on the other one first?” the big guy asked in a low voice. He could tell that Mo Fan was not an easy target for them.

“We’ll take him down. He poses a greater threat to our team. We can’t let his Contracted Beast do whatever she wants!,” replied Fred unrelentingly.

The two launched their attacks at Mo Fan again, one in the air and one on the ground. The big guy abused his strength and chased after Mo Fan fiercely while summoning Rock Barriers along the ground to block Mo Fan’s path.

Mo Fan dodged continuously while observing the big guy, trying to find his weaknesses. His stone armor and incredible strength had turned him into a stone tank. His physical strength was comparable to some of the stronger demon creatures. The duel would not be in their favor if they did not take out this guy!

“Did you guys realize something?” a representative of the Training Hall wearing a pair of sunglasses asked from where he was standing outside the stage.

“Realize what?” another woman asked.

“We keep on talking how strong the guy with the Space Element is, since he’s able to take on Captain Roberts on his own, but didn’t you notice that guy who’s being flanked by Lucky Wang and Fred? His teammates aren’t bothering to help him,” the man with sunglasses observed, analyzing the situation.

“It does look that way; the only help he got was a Healing Spirit from the healer to treat his wounds. His teammates aren’t willing to help him. Our team will soon take out one of them and win the duel with numbers.”

“Something doesn’t seem right.”

“His primary Element is most likely Summoning, you have seen how strong his Contract Beast is! But his teammates aren’t bothering to help him when he’s being flanked by two of our teammates. Doesn’t that mean his team believes he doesn’t need any help?” the man with sunglasses wondered.

“How is that possible? His Contract Beast is already keeping two of our teammates busy!...”

Up on the stage, Jiang Yu, Nanrong Ni, and Mu Tingying indeed had no intention of lending Mo Fan a hand. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As a matter of fact, it was not like they did not work together on purpose. They subconsciously thought Mo Fan could handle the situation when they saw two of their opponents targeting him, so they simply minded their own business.

The truth was, Mo Fan was indeed unlikely to be taken out by the two Americans in a short period of time. If he cast Nyx Regime, he could easily move freely in the zone of darkness and fool around with them for a whole day. He could also challenge the two Americans in the maze set up in the Nyx Regime to waste more time.

“What are they doing? Why haven’t they taken out the Summoner!?” the golden-haired Maga yelled furiously.

The other Maga in a green shirt was in a pinch, too. She did not have time to speak at all.

Where did such a strong little Fire-type creature come from? Even the simplest move from her was equivalent to an Advanced Fire Spell. The two Maga had Water and Light as their primary Elements respectively, yet they were unable to hold their ground against the endless flames pouring down on them!

With a loud rumble, another fireball over thirty meters wide appeared.

What scared the two Maga the most was that the enormous fireball was still expanding, as if the little fiery demoness was blowing air into a balloon to make it bigger!

How could they possibly stop it!? The two Maga fled for their lives, not daring to stand still...

Meanwhile, Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying were finally done with their setup. They were both preparing a huge spell without any burden since Mo Fan was keeping their opponents busy. Both the Ice Element or Plant Element needed some time for their magic to accumulate. When the Plant Element spread across the stage, the roots, magic vines, and Demon Tree Hands would simply be everywhere.

The Ice Element needed time for the frost to stack up, allowing the Ice Mage to freeze their enemies quicker.

The two Maga of the American team were just about to run away when they were trapped by Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni’s spells. Icy glaciers and magic vines sprouted up and surrounded them like a cage, making it impossible for them to escape the blast area of the little fiery demoness’ fireball!.
