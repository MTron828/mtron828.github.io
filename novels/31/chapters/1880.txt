Mo Fan returned to the second floor. The demon leeches were obviously intimidated by him now, and did not dare go to the higher floors. Mo Fan reached the elevated bridge that was connected to the other building, but only saw a dark tunnel crawling with demon leeches. It felt like he was walking into the throat of a monster. He could not bear to look at it very long.

Mo Fan let out a sigh. It was unlikely there were any survivors from the looks of the building.

He glanced at the spots the demon leeches were crawling toward and fixed his eyes on the connecting points on the bridge. His eyes emitted a sharp flicker.

With a crack, the bridge snapped in the middle. The side of the bridge that Mo Fan was on shattered into pieces in the next few seconds. The cracks continued until they reached Mo Fan’s location!

Mo Fan turned and left after destroying the bridge.

Meanwhile, Shen Qing had finished constructing the walkway to the highway for the civilians with her ice zip lines, purposely placing the zip lines close together. The other Mages guided the terrified civilians into moving to the highway as quickly as possible.

Some people preferred to stay behind in the shopping mall. After all, the place was huge and had five stories, with plenty of supplies for them. They could easily survive until the water fell. Shen Qing blatantly told the people who were reluctant to leave that sea monsters deadlier than the demon leeches would show up in just a few hours. At that time, everyone hiding in buildings would end up as monster food.

Those people were horrified at the mention of sea monsters. They immediately followed the Mages’ instructions without any more hesitation.

The people were taking the Haicang Route. Mo Fan glanced at the map and noticed the shopping mall was located at the center of the route. In other words, these people just needed to head west to reach the Haicang Bridge, which would bring them to the mainland.

“Escort them to Haicang Bridge. Someone will receive you along the way,” Shen Qing told the Mages in the group.

“Got it,” the middle-aged Mage who was leading the group nodded.

Shen Qing glanced at the young teenager Liu Xi and the teenage girl Fang Xiaoxue. She said, “Be careful, I must go to other places for now.”

“Mm, we understand!”

Liu Xi and Fang Xiaoxue were very brave. Not only did the teenage girl brought her blind mother over from the residential building not far away, they also brought a few old folks who could not move around well to the rapid transit route. It had been extremely tricky, since neither of them knew magic, but they were obviously calmer and more capable of handling themselves now compared to the panic they were in previously.

After sending the group in the shopping mall away, Mo Fan glanced at Shen Qing, saw the worried look on her face, and asked, “What’s our next destination?”

“It’s a primary school,” Shen Qing said.

Shen Qing was carrying a communication device. Normal voice and text communication were not functioning properly under the circumstances. The military could only place markings on display to communicate with the troops. The Donghai Magic Association was using the device to inform the rescue teams and the Mages of the locations that needed backup. The faster the red dots were flashing, the more urgent the situation was.

Mo Fan took a quick glance at the communication device, which looked like a pocket watch. He noticed a lot of red dots were flashing on it. There were roughly around a hundred of them in the Jiangtou District. Many buildings had some survivors trapped in them.

The one that was flashing the fastest was Zhongxin Primary School. It was around two streets away from the shopping lot. It would not take long for them to reach the place.

“Someone has already gone to Zhongxin Primary School, but they seem to be having trouble,” Shen Qing noticed.

“Lead the way then! Those students are the future of our country. We can’t afford to let anything happen to them!” Mo Fan said.

The Haicang Route happened to pass between the Huwei Mountain and the Xianyue Mountain. Many people had gathered in the mountains now. Authorized personnel were currently leading them to the highways.

“We are safe once we cross the Haicang Bridge,” Liu Xi let out a relieved sigh while talking to Fang Xiaoxue.

“Thank you for staying by my side,” Fang Xiaoxue said softly, standing beside her mother.

“It’s nothing, it’s what I’m supposed to do...” Liu Xi was overjoyed when he sensed the changes in Fang Xiaoxue’s tone and attitude toward him. However, he was a little embarrassed, since her mother was with them. He glanced at the blurry bridge through the falling rain ahead and changed the topic. “There are a lot of people in front of us. I bet it’s going to take a while for us to cross it.”

There were three main bridges. Vehicles were not being permitted, so everyone was traveling by foot. Liu Xi could see the rapid transit route was connected to the spectacular bridge that crossed the sea to the mainland. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

More than a hundred steel cables were hanging from the massive cable tower in the middle. The bridge was hanging above the sea like a long silver ribbon. The sky was dark because of the rain, so it was difficult to see the other end of the bridge. However, the people in the city knew the other end of the bridge was Haicang Wharf, which was connected to the mainland.

The bridge had three lanes in each direction and was extremely spacious, yet it was congested with long queues, especially on the side of the island.

“So many people, how long is it going to take to cross the bridge? I remember the bridge is around seven hundred meters long,” Liu Xi spoke up.

“Let’s take it slowly. We are already very lucky to be able to reach here in one piece. Many people are still trapped in the buildings.”

Liu Xi nodded. He subconsciously glanced at the Mages who were flying in the rain.

The bridge was being guarded by plenty of Mages, Battlemages, members of the Magic Association, Hunters, and government personnel. They were escorting the groups below them in the heavy rain. Liu Xi greatly admired the Mages who were capable of flying in the air. If he could fly too, he would have no trouble bringing Fang Xiaoxue and her mother to safety.

“Captain Chu, there are some unusual movements in the water!” a Mage of the Hongling Division reported loudly.

Liu Xi looked to the side and saw a troop leader he had met at the Sheraton Hotel was also here. He was standing on the back of a Heavenly Eagle that was flying along at a low altitude. The Heavenly Eagle was slightly different from the rest, as its feathers were emitting a golden glow. It seemed nobler than the normal Heavenly Eagles with white feathers.
