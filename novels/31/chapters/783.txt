Mo Fan often had friendly duels with Mu Nujiao. She was also an expert with the Plant Element. He knew he would definitely find himself in a pinch if he dared to fight a Plant Magician within the coverage of the Seed of Kun.

Mo Fan immediately sprinted and ran a few hundred meters away. He would occasionally stomp his feet on the ground while staring at Mochizuki Chihaya alertly, checking if the area was under the Seed of Kun’s control.

Mo Fan only felt safe enough to connect the Star Orbits after he confirmed the area was safe.

However, Mochizuki Chihaya was a lot tougher than Mo Fan had imagined. The woman was able to cast Intermediate Spells at quite an impressive speed. Mo Fan had just accumulated the energy into an explosive Fiery Fist when a wretched seed landed less than five meters away from him.

Mo Fan started running again. The saplings immediately transformed into savage beasts in just a second. They rolled across the area like a tide and turned it into a colony.

“HAHAHA, the monkey show has officially started!” the Japanese student with spiky hair burst out laughing.

Mochizuki Ken and Fujikata Tegami smiled, as if they had already predicted how the battle would turn out.

“The Chinese student is quite impressive. If his reaction speed was any slower, he would be trussed up by now,” said Mochizuki Ken.

Many students who fought against Mochizuki Chihaya could not even survive the first round of attacks. This student from China with Lightning and Fire Elements was fairly quick-witted, not showing any hesitation to move.

However, just running was not enough to defeat a Plant Magician.

His opponent only needed to toss a seed on the ground to gain control of an area. The space of the dueling ground was limited, after all. If the whole dueling ground was placed under the Plant Magician’s control, she would easily dominate the duel.

“Time to teach him a lesson,” Mochizuki Chihaya’s gaze sharpened with a cold smirk.

She watched Mo Fan closely and predicted the direction he was running to.

Using the plants as cover, Mochizuki Chihaya flicked her finger and tossed a dark glowing seed.

The seed weaved through the densely-packed plants. Despite the long distance, it landed accurately on Mo Fan and stuck to his body!

“He’s screwed!”

“Oh, it’s that move, I can’t bear to watch it any further!”

“Serves him right, that’s what you get for being so cocky. I believe he will soon regret picking Miss Chihaya as his opponent,” said Koike Shoko.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan admitted that he had underestimated Mochizuki Chihaya. Her control of the Plant Element had reached a level he had never seen before.

The growth rate of her plants was absolutely stunning. Not only was she tossing the Seeds of Kun around like they cost nothing, she was able to implant a seed on her target too!

Mo Fan realized he had messed up when the seed stuck to him.

Even as he thought, a few seconds later, a few saplings started growing atop him.

The saplings grew incredibly fast, turning into thick vines in an instant and wrapping around their host. The plants covered him before he could think of a plan.

“F**k me!” Mo Fan was dumbfounded. He felt like he was trapped inside a cage.

That was still not the worst. The plants continued to grow over him in layers. It was so tightly sealed that not even the slightest trace of sunlight could penetrate inside.

It was impossible to tell how many layers were stacked on top of him, so thick that even a knife was unable to cut through them. Mo Fan could no longer move his limbs.

Mo Fan was entirely wrapped into a huge ball of plants, and it seemed like the outer layer was still growing!

The watchers were startled upon seeing this. The members of the Chinese team exchanged glances with one another, not knowing what to say.

“Isn’t that woman a bit too strong to be real? Such an outstanding control of the plant element!” said Zhao Manyan.

“She’s ridiculously strong I’ll give you that. Mo Fan is really snookered.”

“How can he even break free from that?”

“I believe he’s going to lose the duel.” Gong Yu immediately added insult to the injury when he saw that Mo Fan was completely pinned down, “Luckily we still have another attempt. Otherwise, we would have lost the challenge. The advisors are surely going to scold the crap out of us.”

Mochizuki Chihaya’s strength completely impressed those watching. The truth was, Gong Yu clearly knew he would also stand no chance against Mochizuki Chihaya if he was fighting the duel now. She was the ace of the West Guardian Tower!

“It seems like we’ve indeed underestimated the Japanese team. If someone like Mochizuki Chihaya isn’t even representing Japan, how strong are their actual representatives?” wondered Nanyu.

They were able to tell the difference in strength between the two fighting the duels quite easily. Mo Fan was suppressed throughout the entire duel, and had only managed to cast two spells. The team found it hard to believe it.

“Chihaya, that’s enough,” Mochizuki Ken looked at the cocoon of plants and interrupted her.

“This duel won’t count. After all, Mochizuki Chihaya is representing us,” said Fujikata Tegami.

“A loss is a loss, there’s no need to...” Ai Jiangtu did not accept the favor.

“Lose my ass, there’s no way I will lose the duel!” Mo Fan’s scream came out from the cocoon of plants that was almost the size of a small house.

“Aren’t you the stubborn kind?” Mochizuki Chihaya smirked. She slowly turned around, her back facing Mo Fan in the cocoon and said, “Apologize to me before I walk off the stage, and I’ll consider letting you go. I bet it doesn’t feel pleasant inside there?”

Mochizuki Chihaya had no intention of continuing the duel. She was heading off the stage. She knew she had gone too far today, yet who asked the kid to disrespect her?

“Apologize my ass, I wonder who’s the one that scolded us first? We were already being kind since we didn’t ask a bitch like you to apologize to us first...” Mo Fan yelled back. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Mochizuki Chihaya came to a stop with a cold face. It was her second time being cursed by the kid. She had yet to settle the score with him, and now he was scolding her again?

“Listen up! Since this is an unfair battle, I didn’t let the plants grow inside your body, but if you dare scold me again, I won’t mind letting the plants drill into your body just so you can experience the pain that I usually inflict on criminals given a death sentence!” Mochizuki Chihaya turned around and glared at Mo Fan with her cold eyes.

Mochizuki Ken could no longer remain seated when he heard Mochizuki Chihaya’s words. He immediately rose to his feet and exclaimed, “Chihaya, that’s enough, he’s only a proud student!”

“The kid is too disrespectful. It’s fine to let Chihaya teach him a lesson. Don’t worry, Chihaya knows how to control herself,” interrupted Tegami.

Mochizuki Chihaya slowly walked toward the cocoon. She wanted to hear if there was any noise coming out of it that would make her feel unpleasant.

“Bitch!” Mo Fan cursed once again.

Mochizuki Chihaya almost exploded in rage. Her chest was heaving.

“Humph, serves you right!” Mochizuki Chihaya giggled with a fierce expression.

She knew they were in the middle of a duel, thus she would not kill Mo Fan, yet she would not mind letting him experience a pain that he would not forget for the rest of his life!
