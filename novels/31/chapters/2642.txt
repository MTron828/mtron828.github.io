Mu Bai stepped forward and stopped Zhao Manyan. “Old Zhao, forget it, these people came prepared. They even brought the necessary equipment to retrieve the Earth Flame Pistil. We won’t stand a chance against them. We have already found what we came for. Let’s pretend we didn’t see the Earth Flame

Pistil.”

“If you have any other ideas, we are right here to play with you. However, you should think twice before doing anything. We don’t mind getting our hands dirty!” the man with aubum hair proclaimed.

“Do you think I’m going to give it up so easily?” Mo Fan glared at the man.

“You seem pretty strong. You are worthy to be my opponent!” The man with auburn hair was ready to fight.

“You are the client. You should pay me first, now that I’ve brought him back to you alive. Don’t you forget about that!” Mo Fan threw the job letter at the man.

‘The man was ready to use his magic. He did not expect the guy to be asking for the reward instead!

“HAHAHA! Don’t you worry, the Northern Sacred Bears keep their promises! It does say bring the man back to me alive, instead of bringing him out of the city. You have finished the job, so I’ll pay you as soon as I get back,” the man laughed. He was amused by Mo Fan’s actions.

The leader of the Northern Sacred Bears was willing to play along with Mo Fan. He carefully put the letter away.

Mo Fan immediately took his leave after he saw the man put the letter away.

The leader of the Northern Sacred Bears grinned. He thought they were serious about challenging the Northern Sacred Bears, but they were only cowards in the end!

Mo Fan and his crew did not stay any longer, turning around and leaving.

The Northern Sacred Bears did not lower their guard, making sure Mo Fan and the others left. They then set up a magic Barrier and went to work.

They had a team of professionals who were skilled at the job to handle the Earth Flame Pistil. They knew how to get rid of the flames on its surface and take out the core of the Earth Flame Pistil without damaging it. Even the Chinese military could not have matched their skills.

They clearly had the skill and technology advantage in retrieving Earth Pistils!

Their boss quietly observed his men as they put the Earth Flame Pistil into a box made from Fundamental Crystals. He could not help but express his joy.

“I don’t think it was appropriate to let them leave. Once they spread the news, we will have trouble leaving the country,” vice leader Yangel said quietly.

“Tve already sent a signal to our men outside to jam every signal coming out of the city. They won’t be able to contact anyone for the time being. Once they get somewhere that is out of the jammer’s range, we will long be gone with the Earth Flame Pistil. We will stick to our escape route. Even if their

whole military came to intercept us, they won’t be able to stop us,” snickered the leader, Kunoy.

“You’re right. If we wasted too much time on them, the Sharkmen would seal off the entire city, making it difficult for us to leave. How long is it going to take? I don’t want to be trapped by those vicious creatures,” Yangel nodded after a moment.

The person in charge of the professionals was an Asian, but judging from the way he spoke and acted, he had long gotten used to the lifestyle in northern Europe.

He glanced at Guan Songdi.

Guan Songdi was his nephew. He was sent here to look for clues and almost got himself killed. To everyone’s surprise, he was able to discover an Earth Flame Pistil!

“Five minutes at most. Boss, you should clear a safe passage first!” Guan Mingzhong said.

“Very well! Once the objective is brought back to our territory safely, the two of you will earn your reward!” Yangel agreed heartily.

Mo Fan and his crew left through the pipes.

‘The underground lake was full of Sharkmen, so it was impossible to go back the way they had come. However, they could just take the drinking water pipes back to the drinking water plant.

Once they regrouped with Lingling, they were told their communication devices had stopped working. They would have to move at least a hundred kilometers away to get a signal.

“Mo Fan, it’s not too late to ask Fanxue Mountain for backup!” Jiang Shaoxu said urgently.

‘An Earth Pistil was extremely valuable to a nation, not to mention that many Headquarters Cities were struggling against the Low Body Temperature Disease. Jiang Shaoxu was unwilling to let the Europeans get away with the Earth Pistil!

“Yeah, since when are we able to swallow our anger?” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

‘They were not afraid of the Northern Sacred Bears. It was hard to tell which side was going to win in the end. Those people had no clue how strong Mo Fan’s team was!

“If we fought them close to the Earth Pistil, even if we beat them, we would still be surrounded by the Sharkmen. What good was that going to do to us?” Mo Fan replied.

“But anything is better than giving them the Earth Pistil for free! If we can’t take it, they aren’t getting it, either!” Zhao Manyan insisted.

“Why bother? Isn’t it better to rob them once they are done retrieving the Earth Pistil?” Mo Fan grinned.

“You’re planning to rob the Northern Sacred Bears?!”

“Exactly!…” Mo Fan nodded sagely.

They did not have the equipment to harvest the Earth Pistil. If the Northern Sacred Bears had not shown up, the Earth Pistil would most likely have ended up in the Sharkmen’s hands.

‘The Northern Sacred Bears were doing them a huge favor instead!

“Mo Fan, I don’t agree with your words,” Lingling interjected sternly. “This is our homeland. Every resource that we have discovered belongs to our people. We are stopping thieves from stealing what is ours. We are not robbing them. We are protecting the country!”

“Ugh?…” Mo Fan was left speechless.

The others stared at the young woman. They did not see any cunning in her eyes. It was impressive how she had justified their motives when they were clearly trying to rob someone!

“The Northern Sacred Bears aren’t stupid, either. They will surely keep an eye out for us and stop us from learning their whereabouts. We have no clue if they have already retrieved the Earth Pistil or how they are going to leave the city,” Jiang Shaoxu reminded them all..1
