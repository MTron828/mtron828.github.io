Dust-like pollen sprinkled down in the air. It had a unique fragrance. The pollen carried by the wind entered Bai Hongfei’s nose. He was overwhelmed by strong drowsiness.

“Who are you?” Bai Hongfei tried his best to stay awake and asked the woman.

“You sure have a lot of questions!” the woman said.

Bai Hongfei tried to run away, but the drowsiness gradually became stronger. He eventually fell unconscious onto the grass beside the lake.

Countless moths soon landed beside him and formed a stretcher to lift him up into the air.

The woman went deeper into the woods. The moths carrying Bai Hongfei followed behind her. The woman and her moths soon disappeared under the moonlight. The lake returned to calm, too!

Mo Fan and Cao Qinqin ran all the way to Qinyi Lake, but they did not see anything out of the ordinary. The clouds had started to block the stars, but they could still see some reflections on the surface of the lake. The moonlight glimmered on the lake when the wind blew, resulting in a stunning view.

“Sir, Bai Hongfei isn’t here,” Cao Qinqin searched around the place, but she did not see Bai Hongfei.

“He was here, and he’s most likely in some kind of danger,” Mo Fan frowned.

Mo Fan had found Bai Hongfei’s school badge on the ground. It was likely that Bai Hongfei had purposely left it behind, since it was hidden below the grass to prevent someone else from noticing it.

“Ah? Was he taken away by demon creatures?” Cao Qinqin said worriedly.

“I don’t think so. There’s no sign of a fight here. I didn’t see any trace of blood either,” Mo Fan said.

There was no sign of a fight, but there were no other traces either. Mo Fan fell into deep thought. Where exactly was Bai Hongfei? Did he see something abnormal about the lake?

“Sir, what should we do now?” Cao Qinqin asked.

“Take this, visit the closest Hunter Union’s branch and ask them to send someone over,” Mo Fan handed his Hunter Master badge to Cao Qinqin.

A Hunter Master had the right to put up a quest. Many Hunters were willing to accept the quest of a Hunter Master to earn contribution points. Mo Fan had saved up quite a lot of contribution points. As long as he offered a certain amount of contribution points, many Hunters were willing to accept a quest, especially when the place was not far away from a safe zone.

“Sir, you’re a Hunter Master too? That’s so cool!” Cao Qinqin said in admiration.

“Go on, I’ll continue to search around in the mountain,” Mo Fan said.

“Sure, I’ll be going.”

——

After Cao Qinqin left, Mo Fan searched around the lake again, but he did not discover anything useful.

He went back to the spot where he found the badge and fell into deep thought again. Meanwhile, the moon that was hiding behind the clouds gradually poked out from behind them. The bright moonlight shone upon the area that Mo Fan was standing on. Mo Fan immediately saw something glowing around him.

“What is this?” Mo Fan sharply noticed the glowing dust.

The glowing dust was sparse, but he could see a trail leading deeper into the woods. Mo Fan could not tell what creature would leave the trail of glowing dust behind. He decisively followed the trail into the woods.

The woods were extremely dark, as the moonlight was unable to penetrate the canopy. The glowing dust continued to grow fainter, making it difficult for Mo Fan to recognize the trail.

Mo Fan suddenly heard the sound of water flowing. He also heard something else.

Mo Fan went closer and discovered a stream. The water was very clear. He could even see the pebbles on the bed under the moonlight.

Mo Fan looked toward the source of the sound and saw an alluring figure sitting on a rock beside the stream. She was soaking her slender legs in the water.

Her hair was black and long, like a waterfall. It seemed like she had just taken a shower. She was combing her wet hair with her hands.

Mo Fan was intrigued. Why was there a woman here? Was she a Hunter hunting some demon creatures around the area?

Maybe he could ask her if she had seen Bai Hongfei.

Mo Fan walked up to the woman. However, he immediately realized he had made a mistake when he went closer!

While the woman was combing her hair, her busty chest was fully exposed to the air. They were shaking a little due to her movement. The moonlight was providing Mo Fan the perfect angle. He could even see glimmering drops of water slowly sliding down her breasts...

It was dark, and the moonlight was the only source of illumination, but Mo Fan could still see how perfect the woman’s skin was. It was fair like jade; her shoulders, waist, and legs were slim, but her bust was shocking. The shape of her bottom imprinted on the rock was like an exquisite piece of art, too!

Mo Fan immediately felt his mouth turning dry. He wanted to back away slowly, but the woman had already turned around. She looked a little confused at first, but her eyes were soon filled with shock and anger when she discovered Mo Fan’s presence!

“It’s a misunderstanding, I didn’t know you didn’t have any clothes on. It’s very dark too, so I wasn’t able to see anything clearly!” Mo Fan turned around and explained himself.

The woman obviously did not believe it. The moonlight was so bright, and she could also sense an aura of darkness from the man. It meant that the man was able to see in the dark to a certain degree. He must have seen everything!

The woman clenched her teeth. If he had not been concealing his presence, she would have noticed him way earlier!

“What are you doing here?” The woman quickly put on her clothes. She was surprisingly calm.

“One of my students is missing. I’m wondering if you have seen him around here. Speaking of which, it’s pretty dangerous for a woman like you to be taking a shower outside the safe zone.” Mo Fan was a little disappointed when he saw the woman quickly put on her clothes.

Why was he so stupid as to expose his presence to the woman? He could have taken a few more glances at her outstanding physique. It was extremely rare to find a woman with such a nice body!

“Could you come closer? I couldn’t hear you properly,” the woman said.

“I was saying that one of my students is missing, so I’ve come here to look for him. Did you happen to see him?” Mo Fan walked closer.

Mo Fan was able to see the woman’s face clearly this time. She was so gorgeous that it felt like she had come out of a painting. Her beauty was surreal. Even Mo Fan, who had seen many pretty women, was astounded by her looks. Mo Fan was aroused when he recalled how he had seen the woman’s naked body just a second ago.

“I haven’t seen him!” the woman snapped.

“Oh, oh, that’s a pity, but why are you here alone?” Mo Fan asked.

“It’s none of your business!” the woman snapped furiously.

“You don’t look like a Mage,” Mo Fan said. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Who told you that only Mages are allowed to leave the safe zone!?”

“Aren’t you afraid of demon creatures?” Mo Fan asked again.

“Not at all,” the woman said.

“I heard there’s a female man-eating monster in this mountain. Surely you aren’t the one they are referring to?” Mo Fan asked curiously, looking at the woman.

The woman was startled. The color of her eyes gradually shifted.

“HAHAHA, I was just joking. I have never seen a monster as gorgeous as you. By the way, I honestly didn’t see anything just then. I hope you won’t mind. If you do, I’m more than willing to be held responsible for it. I don’t really have any strength, but I’ve always been a responsible man...” Mo Fan said.

The woman had a cold face, yet she was trying not to show it. She pointed in another direction and said, “I heard some strange noise that way. You can go take a look if your student is missing. By the way, if you did see anything just then, I swear I’m going to dig your eyes out. I’m indeed a female monster!”

“I honestly didn’t see anything. Is this the right way?” Mo Fan headed in the direction the woman was pointing to. The path was covered by dense bushes and vines. It was difficult for an adult to pass through.

Mo Fan quickly summoned a tongue of flame to clear a path. The light of the Ardent Sunset lit up the surroundings and drove the darkness away.

The light shone upon the woman’s face. The icy expression on her face vanished. She seemed a little scared when she glanced at the fire on Mo Fan’s hand.

“Back away!” The woman quickly waved her hand, signaling the ‘branches’ to stop moving.

Mo Fan turned around. When he saw the strange look on the woman’s face, he asked, “Aren’t you planning to go back? It’s too dangerous out here. My student has gone missing in this area.”

“I’ve been living close to this place since I was young. There aren’t many dangerous creatures around here...” the woman smiled, trying to conceal her intentions.

Mo Fan smiled too. He looked into the woman’s eyes and said, “Or maybe it’s because you’re the most dangerous creature here!”

The woman was startled by his words. She quickly looked angry.

She never thought the young man could see through her disguise so easily. She could not help but wonder how the young man had managed to learn her true identity, since most people would not be suspicious of her because of her looks and her temperament!

“A gorgeous woman like you is always deadly to men... HAHAHA! What is it? If you didn’t like what I was saying, I’ll take it back then,” Mo Fan suddenly burst out laughing. He was acting like a completely different person.

The woman was stunned once again. She immediately felt an urge to curse at the boorish man!

It had given her quite the scare. She thought the man was a Hunter trying to set her up. She almost decided to silence him!

“Lady, what’s your name? I’m Mo Fan, nice to meet you,” Mo Fan said.

The woman let out a relieved sigh after seeing that the man had not seen through her disguise. She said, “I’m Yu Shishi, I’m quite familiar with this area. Should I help you find your student?”

“That would be great,” Mo Fan nodded.

The thought of having a gorgeous woman keeping him company in the wild under the moonlight was so enticing. Tsk tsk tsk... right, why was he here again?
