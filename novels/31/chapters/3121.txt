Chapter 3122: Holding The Senior Hunter Hostage

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The Pharaoh’s Source must not fall into the traitor’s hands! The Hunter Masters are scattered in different parts of Egypt. I can’t locate all of them, thus it will be difficult to grab the Pharaoh’s Source.” Apas emphasized the gravity of the issue.

The Pharaoh’s Source could retain the dead object’s original abilities to a great extent during its process of becoming an Undead.

The mother of Medusa was a creature truly worthy of being crowned as an emperor-level creature. Its eyes were what made it more terrifying than other emperor-level creatures. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“There is one person who can help make things simpler. At least the teams who discovered the location of the Pharaoh’s Source will report to him. Once we have control of the person, we can find out the Hunter Master teams’ movements and progress,” said Lingling.

That person was Black Elephant King.

Lingling remembered that he was the one who distributed the tasks to the Hunter Master teams.

Black Elephant King was a Senior Hunter. It was not a simple task to take down someone of his level.

“You have to find a way to subdue Black Elephant King. After that, tell me what information he has. I will go and capture the Pharaoh’s Source one by one!” said Apas.

Her two older sisters had gone crazy and were going all out to destroy her!

“I have to think of something, ” Lingling was troubled.

‘Why must a young lady, who was still under the age of twenty, handle something as big as this? Where have all the important and talented people gone?’ wondered Lingling.

On second thoughts, if an unreliable guy like MO Fan could become someone so famous that he ended up as the center of attraction among other people, it was only normal that someone so young had to handle such a mess.

“Don’t you have your teammates with you? I’ll release them all,” said Apas. “Yes, I have. Alright. Having them is better than having nothing.” Lingling heaved a sigh.

She had tried to behave like a schoolgirl who did not use her head in the slightest. However, it seemed that she still had to make use of her ability as a Seven-Star Hunter Master in the end.

“By the way, how are you going to explain everything to them?” asked Apas.

“That’s simple.”

Black Elephant King was an important figure who controlled the Hunter Union. He was the one who obtained all the Pharaoh’s Source.

After Lingling walked out of the Sacred Hall of Sunset, she thought carefully about the mission before glancing at the members of the Hunter Society.

They had just escaped from the brink of death. They were justifiably in poor spirits. Fortunately, they were on her side.

“Is it true that only the Pharaoh’s Source can lift our Snake Pupil Curse?” Jiang Bingming looked pale. His lips trembled as he spoke.

“Right now, all the Hunter Masters are doing everything they can to find the Pharaoh’s Source to win the Hunter Tournament, and we have to find seventeen Pharaoh’s Sources to… How is this possible? This curse will torture us all to death!” Chen He wailed. He covered his face and almost sobbed.

Meanwhile, Tong Zhouzheng remained silent. He was their professor. The more he kept quiet, the more the students panicked.

“Professor, I have an idea,” Lingling decided to speak up after noticing everyone was upset.

“Go on,” said Tong Zhouzheng.

“We will take the host of the tournament, Black Elephant King, as our hostage. The Hunter Masters are gathering information about the Pharaoh’s Source. Once we capture Black Elephant King, we can have other Hunter Master teams look for the Pharaoh’s Source for us. With that, we will have hope of breaking the Snake Pupil Curse,” said Lingling.

“Are you kidding us?! He’s a Senior Hunter!”

“If we do that, we will be completely removed from the hunter’s list! That’s a crime!”

“I agree. It’ll be worse than the curse torturing us to death!”

“That’s true! Don’t we have any other way? It was a mistake to accidentally barge into the Evil Temple!”

Tong Zhouzheng considered Lingling’s proposal carefully.

After some time, Tong Zhouzheng nodded. “We’ll do it this way. I’ll act as if I’ve obtained the Pharaoh’s Source. After that, I’ll use it to set up a trap and poison the Black Elephant King. We can then control him.”

“Professor, are you sure you can do this?” Lingling asked with concern. “Provided he is not wary of me,” said Professor Tong Zhouzheng.

The members of the Hunter Society looked depressed.

How did the tournament turn to this all of a sudden? They were going to become traitors and attack the tournament’s main referee and other participating teams.

The issue was, they were poorly skilled. Could they really pull it off?

When they walked out of the Sunset Slope, everyone looked so tired that their limbs felt heavy.

They eventually returned to Orange Sand City. They were greeted by the prosperity and vitality of the city, but they were not happy. After all, the Red Python Evil Dragon’s curse was branded in the depths of their souls. Whenever they closed their eyes, the image of the terrifying vertical pupils would appear in the darkness of their thoughts.

Apas was the mistress of the Evil Temple. She warned the members of the Hunter Society that the curse would consume them within a week. The curse would make their lives a living hell. To frighten them, Apas deliberately created some illusions and implanted them in their spiritual world so that they were convinced that they were haunted by the curse.

The Pharaoh’s Source was the only cure.

Besides, one Pharaoh’s Source could lift only one person’s curse.

Out of desperation, Lingling was forced to fool them in this way. She could not find any better helpers in Cairo.

Moreover, Black Elephant King was a Senior Hunter. He was certainly very powerful!

They could not use the hard approach. Tong Zhouzheng’s proposal was the most suitable one.

They were participants in the tournament, and Tong Zhouzheng was a senior professor as well as a Hunter Master. Black Elephant King would not doubt the origin of the Pharaoh’s Source if it was given by Tong Zhouzheng. It was unlikely that Black Elephant King would set up a defense against Tong Zhouzheng

“Rest for the night. We’ll take the Black Elephant King as a hostage tomorrow, ” said Tong Zhouzheng to the crowd.

“Professor, do we really have to do this?”

“Yes. None of us want to die. Besides, I heard that those who die from a curse are never at peace.”

The crowd could not sleep in peace. Lingling knew that they had fallen into her trap. She breathed out a sigh of relief.

She opened her portable notebook. She was about to check the progress of the Hunter Masters whom she had been tracking when someone knocked on her door.

Lingling opened the door in confusion. Professor Tong Zhouzheng stood there, looking solemn.

He often looked strict. So, nothing seemed amiss.

“Professor, what’s the matter?” Lingling asked.

Did he suddenly remember something, or did he purposely come to talk to her in private?

“You know the mistress of the Evil Temple, don’t you?” asked Professor Tong Zhouzheng.

Lingling was caught by surprise. She did not expect the professor to be so observant.

It seemed that Professor Tong Zhouzheng had found out something.

“I need a more realistic explanation, not some funny curse story,” said Professor Tong Zhouzheng.

“Please come in.” Lingling had to let the professor into the room.

“I know you are the Cold Hunting King’s daughter, Leng Lingling. I believe you won’t simply collude with a demon to harm humans. But I don’t understand why you must ruin the tournament,” said Professor Tong Zhouzheng.

Lingling was taken aback. The professor knew everything!

“Then will you believe me if I explain everything?” asked Lingling.

“I need to hear everything first,” said Professor Tong Zhouzheng..
