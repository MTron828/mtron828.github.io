“It’s that Egyptian again! He brought a whole team this time. Didn’t they already lose the challenge? Why are they here?” protested Dongfang Lie furiously, immediately recognizing Sayed with a single glance.

“They are planning to challenge us again. It seems every team has a certain number of attempts to take the same challenge again,” said Mu Nujiao.

“How shameless could they be? Didn’t he say he could take on a few of us by himself? He finally brought his team here after he lost the challenge. These Egyptians are seriously lacking in class!” cursed Dongfang Lie.

“Mu Ningxue isn’t here, what shall we do?” said Yue Tangxin.

The team realized that Mu Ningxue was indeed absent. It had been days since she last came to the Training Hall. She was apparently cultivating in seclusion.

If she was absent, Sayed could easily take on a few of them. Everyone immediately frowned.

“Why are we so scared? Aren’t I here?” Mo Fan patted his chest and said confidently.

“Who are you again?”

“Yeah, we’ve never seen you before...”

Dongfang Lie did recognize Mo Fan, but he never had a good impression of him. He said with a cold harrumph, “You shouldn’t embarrass yourself here with your little tricks, you’re not even a member of the national team!”

“My little tricks? You still lost to me!” bantered Mo Fan in return.

Bai Dongwei looked at Mo Fan and said, “Are you Mo Fan, the other member of the national team that was sent here?”

“That’s me,” said Mo Fan.

“You didn’t come to register yourself after so long, I was going to cross out your name!” accused Bai Dongwei in an unpleasant voice.

“Aren’t I here now?”

While the team was discussing, the Egyptians totally ran out of patience. Sayed had already forgot his lesson from before and stepped forward, pointing at the Chinese team, “What is it? Are you scared to fight us?”

“Humph, you won’t be taking the stamp with your second attempt!” said Dongfang Lie.

“Let’s get on with it. How is the challenge going to be? You are the host, so you can decide,” said Sayed.

As the instructor at the Training Hall, Bai Dongwei was really annoyed after getting provoked by the Egyptian team twice in a row.

However, Mu Ningxue happened to be absent today. They did not have much chance of winning the duels against the Egyptian team.

Bai Dongwei was still thinking about how their team was going to handle it when he saw Mo Fan heading for the stage.

“Hey, what are you doing? Did I ask you to go?” Bai Dongwei scolded the kid that was not following his rules.

“Instructor Bai, I heard from Mu Nujiao that they only sent a single person here to fight the three of us, is that right?” said Mo Fan.

“Yeah, damn it, stop changing the topic! Come down right now, I haven’t decided what the challenge is going to be like. Where are your manners!” said Bai Dongwei.

“Alright then, I will be standing here today. Ask the Egyptian team to send out three representatives, if they can knock me out of bounds, they can take the stamp!” said Mo Fan confidently.

“Who do you think you are!?”

“Fighting three of them? I can’t even beat one of them, let alone you! Mo Fan, stop causing a scene here!” said Dongfang Lie.

“Your inability doesn’t mean I can’t do it,” replied Mo Fan. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Dongfang Lie felt like vomiting blood. He had never seen anyone so full of himself. This was a duel between a national team and a defending team at the Training Hall. How could he treat it so simply?

“Instructor Bai, just let him try,” said Mu Nujiao.

“Are you kidding, our opponents are candidates of the national team! Even if Mo Fan was demoted from the national team, there’s no way he can take on three of them!” said Instructor Bai.

Meos on the Egyptian team was getting impatient. She glanced at Mo Fan, who seemed to be the representative and asked, “Have you made up your mind?”

“We’re done. Your team will pick three people and take turns fighting me. If you can knock me down from the stage, you can take the stamp. It’s as easy as that,” said Mo Fan.

The Egyptian team snorted disdainfully at Mo Fan’s words.

Arrogant, smug, retarded!

“Are you sure about that?” Meos burst into laughter. There really were a lot of idiots nowadays. Did someone on the team defending the Training Hall just ask to challenge three members on their national team?

“What’s with your nonsense? Hurry up and send someone to the stage! I can’t wait to beat the crap out of you all! After you’re done, pack your stuff and leave! China doesn’t welcome you!” Mo Fan’s mouth was like a gatling gun, setting fire to the Egyptian team in an instant.

“We’ll give him what he wants since he asked for it. Meos, let me take care of him first!” Sayed volunteered.

“Alright, I’m not that interested in fighting a mentally-retarded guy.” She had come to the conclusion that there was something wrong with the Chinese guy’s head.

It went without saying that the candidates on the national team were stronger than people defending a Training Hall. Sayed was quite strong on their team. It was reasonable for him to challenge three defenders by himself.

However, a defender was challenging three members on the national team? Not even a chance!

Sayed was already moving into position. They did not even realize that the Chinese team had yet to agree.

Instructor Bai felt his balls hurting. Where the heck did this kid come from? Not only did he disregard the rules, he totally treated the Training Hall as his own home, deciding on the rules by himself!

Bai Dongwei went forward, trying to put an end to the farce. To his surprise, Mo Fan turned his head to him and said, “Instructor Bai, just about time, can you be the judge for us?”

Bai Dongwei was startled. Before he collected his thoughts, Mo Fan was already casting a Fire Spell. Strong flames burst out of his fist and flew at the Egyptian team’s representative, Sayed.

“Damn it, I didn’t even say you could start!” Bai Dongwei was dumbfounded.

Sayed did not care either. His opponent had already attacked. Would he seriously wait for the judge to declare the start of the duel?

He reacted as soon as he saw the magical light from Mo Fan. He turned into a shadow and swiftly backed away from Mo Fan.

That was all Sayed could do with the Shadow Element. His real strength lay with the Undead Element.

Soon, the muscular Iron Mummy was summoned. Sayed hid in a safe corner and directed the Iron Mummy to fight Mo Fan.

“Swift Star Wolf, have some fun with this poor mummy!”

Mo Fan had his underlings too. He immediately Summoned the Swift Star Wolf.

The Swift Star Wolf was a strong Warrior-level creature. Although it was slightly weaker than the Iron Mummy, it would not lose to it quickly.

“Damn it!” Sayed did not expect Mo Fan to have the Summoning Element, too. He proceeded to Summon his strongest undead, the Death Saber Mummy!

Mo Fan did not really have a lot of experience fighting an Undead Magician. He was astounded when he saw the Death Saber Mummy’s strength was incredibly close to a Commander-level creature.

No wonder this guy was able to fight three people by himself! The Death Saber Mummy was clearly able to dominate among Intermediate Magicians.

However, in Mo Fan’s eyes, the Death Saber Mummy was unable to pose any threat to him. It was still nothing compared to a real Commander-level creature!
