Chapter 1602 Wolf Wave Attack

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The Dark Swordmaster was surprisingly tough, and was still standing despite being attacked continuously now. It was enraged when it saw Mo Fan charging at it!

It simply ignored Mu Bai and Meos’ spells. The ice spikes and light daggers stabbed into its body as it forcibly summoned its huge sword back to it while a black aura engulfed it!

“One-Word Slash!”

The Dark Swordmaster pointed its sword, and black sword intent thrust at Mo Fan in a straight line.

Mo Fan was currently in mid-air. He was familiar with the Dark Swordmaster’s move. Asha’ruiya’s Dark Swordmaster had used the same move on him!

Using the swiftness of the sword to maximize its damage. The sword could instantly kill its target if it hit!

The Dark Swordmaster could also blink forward with the move, going from the point it drew its sword to the point the slash ended at. The Dark Swordmaster was planning to kill him first, then take Mu Bai and Meos out too!

The Dark Swordmaster could easily kill the two Advanced Mages!

Mo Fan clenched his teeth. He would not dodge the attack! He would break its sword with his fist!

“Rocket Wings: Meteorite Fist!”

Mo Fan transformed into a meteorite. His fist enlarged after it was engulfed by the three Soul-grade Flames. He went right at the Dark Swordmaster’s attack with the propulsion from the Fiery Wings.

The black sword flickered past in a straight line!

Mo Fan’s Meteorite Fist looked unstoppable, but the terrifying sword also possessed a remarkable power!

Blood suddenly poured out from Mo Fan’s punching arm.

Mo Fan did not feel much pain, yet he saw his right arm separate from his body. The arm spun away, blood scattering in the air. It landed a few dozen meters away and rolled across the ground.

The Meteorite Fist had stopped the Dark Swordmaster from moving past Mo Fan; it was instead knocked flying by Mo Fan’s punch. It had to stick its sword into the ground to stop itself!

The Dark Swordmaster lowered its head and saw the armor on its chest breaking into pieces. Zhao Manyan’s light spear had already left quite a few holes on it, but Mo Fan’s Meteorite Fist had completely destroyed it!

“Little Flame Belle, it’s your turn!” Mo Fan could sense no pain. However, a black mist had surrounded him and stopped him from moving.

He could not move, but Little Flame Belle could. He decisively separated himself from her!

Little Flame Belle was infuriated. How dare this pitch-black creature hurt her father!

The Flame Belle floated in the air while gathering her Fire Magic. The blazing flames combined into a raging phoenix above her.

The phoenix spread its wings before diving at the Dark Swordmaster with all the Flame Belle’s rage!

The flames howled like the wind when the phoenix collided with the Dark Swordmaster and sent it flying again. The flames spread wildly and poured into the Dark Swordmaster’s armor.

The creature inside the armor cried out in pain. It did not expect it to suffer serious injuries when it was going up against a bunch of insignificant human Mages!

“Come out here, wear it out and kill it!” Mo Fan knew it was time to Summon his powerful army of wolves. “Summoning Gate: Beast Tide!”

Mo Fan cast the Summoning Gate while Little Flame Belle kept the Dark Swordmaster busy. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Countless howls were heard from the gate, followed by many magnificent figures erupting forth. A few of the clumsy Enormous White Wolves had changed significantly. Their build had improved, their hair was elegant, and most importantly, they all had a black crescent with a hint of nobility and savagery on their forehead!

“Moon-Devouring White Wolves?” Shreev recognized the wolves immediately. His face was filled with shock.

The Moon-Devouring White Wolves were Commander-level Summoned Beasts! Mo Fan’s Summoning Gate was already strong enough to Summon Commander-level creatures! More importantly, it did not Summon just one or two Moon-Devouring White Wolves!

Nine Moon-Devouring White Wolves charged out of the Summoning Gate, noble yet elegant. The others could only see blurred white figures running past as the wolves were sprinting by.

These Moon-Devouring White Wolves were only the leaders of the pack. Behind them, an army of white wolves rushed out of the gate like a bursting dam!

“Go and kill it!” Mo Fan pointed forward with his remaining arm. He was extremely excited.

The wolf tide soon dominated the scene. The others subconsciously backed away.

The Moon-devouring White Wolves led the way. The nine Commander-level creatures pounced at the Dark Swordmaster, who was now swaying a little.

The Dark Swordmaster had impressive vitality, and was still standing despite the injuries it had suffered. It raised its sword and swung it around wildly. It managed to drive a few of the Moon-Devouring White Wolves back, but the rest of them were able to attack it from different angles. They either bit off a piece of its remaining armor, or left a deep gouge on it.

The Enormous White Wolves joined the fight, too. These wolves had sturdy skin and thick flesh. The Dark Swordmaster struggled to hold its ground when so many of them were ramming it at the same time.

In addition to that, the insane number of White-Marked Wolves was quite a nuisance for the Dark Swordmaster. They kept jumping around, aiming for its wounds. The Dark Swordmaster did manage to kill some of them while waving its sword around, yet it did not really make a difference!

The Flame Belle did not stop attacking with her flames as the wolves were keeping the Dark Swordmaster busy. It had no choice but to back away. It was covered in more and more injuries as time went on!

“Let’s see if you can survive this!” Mo Fan cursed it.

Mo Fan had not Summoned the wolf army right at the beginning. If he had done so while the Dark Swordmaster was still healthy, the wolves would only have ended up as cannon fodder. Even the nine Moon-Devouring White Wolves would have struggled to stay alive!

The Dark Swordmaster was now suffering from serious injuries, yet was not finished; it was not so easy to kill a Ruler-level creature. If Mo Fan had kept attacking recklessly, the creature might use everything it had left to kill him. Therefore, he decided to Summon the wolf army now so they could abuse their numbers. Not only would he minimize the losses, the wolves would eventually wear out the Dark Swordmaster!
