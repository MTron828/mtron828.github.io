Translated by Xephiz

Yangel returned to the nursery home hastily, surveying the people who were setting up the Teleportation Portal. They would be done very soon, and the team could finally leave the Sharkmen’s territory. “How did you end up like this?” Kunoy asked him.

“I underestimated him. He will be here soon. We should figure out a way to take him out,” Yangel replied, ashamed of his failure.

“A demoness who came out of nowhere has messed up our Magic Formation. It will take us a little longer to set it up,” Kunoy snarled impatiently.

Anyone who was not deaf could hear the loud rumbling approaching from the lower mountain. The horde of Sharkmen would arrive very soon!

If the Magic Formation was disrupted again, they would surely end up as food to the Sharkmen! “We’ll settle the score with them after we leave this place!” Yangel nodded. “Why wait? We can settle the score here now,” Mo Fan contributed. Yangel turned around and saw Mo Fan standing there in his black Armor. He immediately burst into a fit of anger. “Brother, he’s a formidable enemy! We should take him out as quickly as possible to prevent him from messing with the Magic Formation!” Yangel snarled.

“No one can last for more than three minutes against the two of us!” Kunoy was even more confident in himself than Yangel.

“His Armor is a little special,” Yangel warned his brother.

“There’s no need to be afraid of him. Let’s go!”

Kunoy did not waste any time. The young man’s intention to destroy the Magic Formation was no different from trying to feed them to the Sharkmen!

Kunoy could not care less about the ethics of being a mercenary. His only concern was to take out his enemy!

Auburn flames emerged from Kunoy’s body. They did not look sacred like Yangel’s flames, but they were clearly stronger in comparison. Yangel engulfed himself in golden flames once again. The two brothers transformed into Sacred Bears, standing side-by-side. Their bulky and muscular physiques could easily intimidate Great Rulers!

For some reason, Mo Fan noticed Yangel’s power had grown when his brother was around. His eyes had grown fiercer, too! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The red-brown flames and the golden flames were complementing one another. Mo Fan immediately felt a strong Aura coming from them, like two suns.

It seemed like Yangel was not lying about how the brothers had always fought alongside one another. They were stronger when they were together! “Little Flame Belle!”

In that case, Mo Fan had no reason to fight them alone!

Mo Fan Summoned Little Flame Belle. She appeared beside Mo Fan in her Flame Belle Goddess form. Burning maple leaves were now circling her slender figure.

New burning leaves rose continuously under Little Flame Belle’s feet. They dissipated in the air after drifting around her in circles a few times.

Mo Fan also unleashed the Phoenix Flame. It was brighter after its full power had been Awakened by the Mysterious Feathers. Its color was changing constantly.

The Ardent Flames were not as elegant. They were more like lingering flames, with a strong embodiment of darkness. Under their calm surface lay a fierce nature!

The Sacred Bear Brothers’ main Element was Fire.

Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle were like a fire demon and a fire demoness standing side-by-side. Their Auras were not necessarily weaker than the two half-beasts. Four different flames were clashing fiercely in the air before the battle even took place.

“I’ll handle the elder brother while you fight the younger brother,” Mo Fan told Little Flame Belle.

Little Flame Belle nodded. Her unseen face had a noble temperament under her new burning veil, as if the Mysterious Feathers had granted her a Totem Beast’s pride.

Kunoy and Yangel were stomping the ground simultaneously. Mo Fan initially thought the two clumsy bears were just playing around, as the soil was splashing around like mud.

However, the ‘mud’ turned out to be scorching flames. Their temperature was even higher than lava. The scorching mud began to spread across the ground.

The scorching mud was spreading slowly, but it posed a huge threat to Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle, as they had no idea what it was. The tarry stuff suddenly splashed into the air, and a blazing creature jumped out from it and lunged at Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle!

The muddy creature opened its mouth and engulfed Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle in fire. Its insides were full of boiling oil! The bubbles on the surface of the oil were exploding like bubbles on a pool of lava. The creature’s throat was somehow as large as a canyon. The whole place was filled with boiling

oil!

“I think we are stuck in some kind of Domain,” Mo Fan remarked.

It was unlikely for the creature’s insides to be so huge. The two brothers were clearly using their true strength.

The boiling oil was flowing like a landslide, and the whole place was now sealed up by the boiling pitch. There was no escape for Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle. They could only watch the tarry stuff closing in on them. “Ling!” Little Flame Belle cried softly as burning leaves appeared under her feet.

The leaves scattered across the canyon as if a strong wind had just swept across a forest of maple trees. The leaves drifted dazzlingly in the wind.

The leaves flew at the approaching oily muck. The creature’s throat was filled up by explosions as the two clashed fiercely.

The boiling oil had covered the entire ground, while the leaves were scattering to fill the air!
