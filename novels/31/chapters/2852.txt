Chapter 2853: Waiting for The Sacred Totem Beast

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

President Hong Wu looked stunned.

He never thought that Dean Xiao would say such a thing. He could ask Mo Fan to cooperate with the Forbidden Curse Association, even order him as the president. But he could not force Dean Xao to obey him.

In terms of strength, Hong Wu was stronger than Dean Xiao. However, Water Elements Mages could defuse and suppress the power of Ocean Demons far more easily. When the Ocean Demons fought with Water Elements Mages, they were not much different from the demons on the land. It was very crucial in the fight against the Ocean Demons.

“Dean Xiao, please think once again. Their plans for Sacred Totem Beast are just mere guesses. The most important thing right now is to fill the gap in the sky above Magic City and the incoming Heaven-shaking Demonic Waves. The Forbidden Curse Association swears by our souls that the Demon Lord will do all these things. If we defeat it, it will ease the current situation in Magic City!” said Hong Wu earnestly.

Several Forbidden Mages were fighting with the Cold Moon Demon Lord, and the situation on their side was not optimistic. Even if they had not thought of a way to defeat the Demon Lord, the mere presence of Dean Xiao, a Water Element Forbidden Mage, could reduce the pressure and offer some morale to the Forbidden Curse Association.

Regardless of whether Dean Xiao could deal with the Prime Waves or not, his presence here was of utmost importance. He could not let Dean Xiao leave.

“We also know nothing about this creature. Even if we can solve the threat of the Prime Waves, can we conquer the Demon Lord? It stands there so fearlessly, almost unbothered by everything. How do we ensure that a more terrifying Ocean Demon won’t appear after we solve the problem of the Prime Waves?” Dean Xiao asked.

Since everything was uncertain at this time, no decision was perfect.

Although it was the Forbidden Curse Association’s decision, it did not necessarily represent the solution. Dean Xiao knew very well that the Totems had once expelled the Ocean Godly Horde. If they could awaken them, they might be able to change the current situation in the Magic City!

As a Mage, Dean Xiao believed that the Sacred Totem Beast was important in such a desperate situation.

“Dean Xiao!” Hong Wu raised his tone, and his face darkened. “This matter is related to the survival of Magic City, and your choice is particularly important. No matter how things turn out, the Forbidden Curse Association will stand by you if you choose to stay. However, if you leave and Magic City falls, you and your students will be considered traitors in the future. I beg you to think about that!”

“President Hong, all Mages are responsible for the destruction of Magic City. Our neglect, and inattentiveness have led to today’s catastrophe. However, I have nothing to say even if you choose to place the entire blame on me and my students. When a crisis and catastrophe emerges, the first thing you do is not reflect but find a person or a group to take responsibility for this matter and become the target of everyone’s anger. It is the ignorance of thought and the retrogression of civilization, and there is no cure for this!” Dean Xiao was unmoved by President Hong Wu’s attitude and retorted fiercely.

“Very well. Dean Xiao, I’m looking forward to the Sacred Totem Beast. Along with the lives of millions that will be lost in the Magic City, the unimaginable wreckage and an ocean full of human blood, I will wait here for your Sacred Totem Beast!” Hong Wu said coldly. His bloodshot eyes showed his anger and despair. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He cared about Magic City. So did Dean Xiao.

Those families, who were hugging each other and crying silently in the shattered house, were all waiting for the Mages they revered and respected to eliminate the wandering Ocean Demons and find a solution to remove the Black Alert.

However, when two people with the same goal had a major clash, they became indifferent towards the common enemy.

Dean Xiao could not say that his way was the right way. No one knew the results when facing the unknown. He just followed his heart.

“Shaoli, send them away.” Hong Wu was expressionless, and his tone was cold.

Dean Xiao bowed and turned to leave. Regardless of the outcome, Hong Wu’s generosity on the edge of despair deserved Dean Xiao’s salute.

However, Dean Xiao had become insignificant to Hong Wu.

…

Everyone left with the Green East Sea God.

Magic City became smaller and smaller as they flew further. They were lucky to survive and leave the Magic City at this time. But how many would be as lucky as them?

This place was also their home. Although they were outnumbered, everyone was fighting for their world against those Ocean Demons in their own way.

The Green East Sea God flapped its wings and increased its speed.

Finally, Magic City disappeared from their sights. However, Dean Xiao, Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai, Jiang Shaoxu, Song Feiyao, Eagle-winged Shaoli, and Mr. Bai Mei looked on with heavy hearts.

In Magic City, they felt at ease for some reason. But once they left Magic City, They felt sad and guilty.

What should they do to save Magic City from this disaster?

Those evil Ocean Demons did not slaughter ordinary humans but chose to kill the Mages first. It meant that their failure would be the beginning of a disaster. What kind of torture and humiliation would those powerless people face in the city at the hands of the Ocean Demons?

“Can we do anything to help?” Mr. Bai Mei asked in a daze.

No one could answer.

“At least we didn’t pin all our hopes on the Forbidden Curse Association, which is stronger and more authoritative than us. We are doing what we feel is right,” said Dean Xiao.

“Can the Sacred Totem Beast really save us? Aren’t we pinning all our hopes on it?” said Eagle-winged Shaoli.

At this point, it was pointless to argue.

“We’re too weak. Under the cruel survival law, we’re nothing but food for other races. Magic can never stop advancing,” said Dean Xiao.

“I finally understand why Mo Fan wanted to attack Asian Magic Association and kill Su Lu,” Mu Bai suddenly said.

Dean Xiao nodded. He knew what Mu Bai meant.

Many people felt that Mo Fan acted impulsively, and he was often reckless. But Mo Fan and the others were not looking at things the same way.

If no one stood up for certain things in life, it would continue unquestioned.
