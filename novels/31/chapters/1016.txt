The black sword light was devoured by the lightning. The lightning arcs encapsulated the Brutal Sword Death Servant. The might of the fist knocked it flying, before it eventually rammed into the boulder that it appeared from!

“Humph, trying to overwhelm me with brute force?” Mo Fan said disdainfully, staring at the creature that slammed into the boulder.

The lightning arcs were quite powerful, too. The boulder slowly cracked apart after the creature rammed into it...

As Mo Fan was currently standing on a slope, his vision further up basically blocked off by the boulder. After the boulder cracked open, Mo Fan discovered he had unknowingly arrived at the top of the hill. However, he gasped when he saw more than fifty of the pitch-black undead scattered across the hill. They were all holding black swords and had terrifying, bloodshot eyes...

These Brutal Sword Death Servants were a lot stronger than the Poisonous Golden Mummies. Even the creature that Mo Fan sent flying with the punch did not die instantly. There were not many Warrior-level creatures that were able to survive Mo Fan’s lightning fist!

“Holy crap, I’ve poked a beehive!” Mo Fan’s face contorted.

Mo Fan initially thought he had only stumbled into a little boss enemy in the fight, since its pitch-black appearance seemed a lot nobler than the rest of the hideous-looking undead. However, if Mo Fan had known there were more than fifty of them on the hill, he definitely would not have bothered to pick a fight with them!

It was obviously too late to run now. Mo Fan felt like he was being grabbed firmly by more than fifty hands. Even moving his body was incredibly difficult.

The first Brutal Sword Death Servant rose from the debris of the boulder and let out an unpleasant sound, like the jaw of a skeleton crackling.

Even though Mo Fan could not understand the language of the undead, he knew the creature was basically trying to say, “Brothers, he was bullying me, let’s chop him up into pieces!”

Countless slashes, like the flickering of stars, came rapidly in his direction. Some were straight while the others took the shape of crescents both vertically and horizontally...

Mo Fan immediately felt a pain surging across his body as the Black Snake Armor took the slashes.

“Damn it, I dare you to fight me one at a time!” Mo Fan tried to break free from the surrounding Brutal Sword Death Servants miserably.

The area was suddenly covered in shocking scars and clefts as Mo Fan fled from one end to the other. If it wasn’t for the Space Element Time Stasis buying him some extra time to dodge the incoming attacks, the Black Snake Armor would have been completely destroyed!

The shadowy crescents of the slashes surged forward like a strong wind, combining into a single blow, and struck Mo Fan’s pitch-black figure.

Mo Fan’s figure was torn into pieces by the powerful impact. The pieces were further shredded into tiny bits by the wind following the first wave of attacks...

The Brutal Sword Death Servants finally halted in their tracks when they saw their enemy had been eliminated.

Little did they know, an invisible dark ripple had woven through them and appeared behind them!

“Time to settle our debt!” Mo Fan’s voice suddenly appeared as he went up to the Brutal Sword Death Servant that was already injured.

Mo Fan flung his arm, summoning a silver rhomboid. The incredible pressure descended upon the area. The Brutal Sword Death Servant was crushed by the compression force before it could react in time.

The other Brutal Sword Death Servants immediately turned around, and were infuriated when they discovered the human was still alive. Not only that, he managed to sneak behind them and kill one of their comrades!

The target that the Brutal Sword Death Servants torn into pieces with their slashes was only a shadow clone left by the Dark Noble Mantle. It was the highest level of the Shadow Spell, Fleeing Shadow. Without the Dark Noble Mantle’s unique effects of strengthening Shadow Spells, Mo Fan would never be able to summon the shadow decoy.

It was very hard to tell the difference between a real person and a shadow decoy. Even the Black Sea Drake was tricked by a shadow decoy, allowing Mo Fan to gain an advantageous position. The Brutal Sword Death Servants’ senses were weaker than the Black Sea Drake, so it was unlikely they could differentiate between Mo Fan’s shadow decoys and himself!

“Come over here!” Mo Fan grabbed out. The Illusionary Claw dragged one of the Brutal Sword Death Servants forcibly to him.

The Brutal Sword Death Servant reacted fairly quickly. It did not panic even when it was being targeted. It utilized the chance to slash at Mo Fan’s head instead.

“Off you go!” Mo Fan threw a fist burning with nine fiery dragons right in the face of the Brutal Sword Death Servant.

The flames erupted ahead, fiery dragons following behind it. The Brutal Sword Death Servant was knocked flying, ramming into a few of its comrades like bowling pins...

The Brutal Sword Death Servants were extremely fast. Mo Fan could only see black shadows moving swiftly across the hill.

The creatures actually knew how to work as a team. It was quite rare to see, especially when most undead were unintelligent. The ten Brutal Sword Death Servants leading the way were trying to confuse Mo Fan with their rapidly moving shadows, while the twenty Brutal Sword Death Servants following up behind were the actual ones that were designated to take out Mo Fan.

If they failed to give Mo Fan a deadly blow, the first ten Brutal Sword Death Servants would immediately take hold of the opportunity to aim for Mo Fan’s weaknesses!

Mo Fan had to admit that these undead were a lot smarter than most undead he had fought before. It felt like he was up against a bunch of well-trained assassins. He had only killed one and crippled one after spending so much time on them!

“Come, you don’t seriously think I am scared of you!”

Mo Fan knew running away was not an option, thus he decisively went all out against the Brutal Sword Death Servants instead!

The flames of a Sky-Flame Funeral surged across the place, turning it into an ocean of fire. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wild lightning strikes kept appearing and landing on the ground in a spectacular manner. Some landed beside the Brutal Sword Death Servants, others landed right on target.

Mo Fan was initially planning to use the only Domain he had mastered, the Nyx Regime. However, when he remembered that the Domain made any Shadow-type creature within it stronger, he immediately decided against it.

The Nyx Regime would at most strengthen his Shadow Spells slightly, but it would only quicken his death if the shadow assassins were given a great buff all of a sudden!

Even though the Nyx Regime was fairly powerful, its main difference when compared to other real Domains was that it was unable to distinguish between friend and foe!
