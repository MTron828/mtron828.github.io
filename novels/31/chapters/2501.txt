Chapter 2502: The Lord of the Sea Shakes the Ocean

Translated by XephiZ

The Wasteland Battlefield was falling into the sea as the platforms and bridges collapsed into the water.

Strong waves swept across the place with deafening roars. The water was pouring down like a storm, the strong winds blowing the heavy stones and material into the air. The Battlemages had to stick together and set up huge Barriers with their defensive spells to stand their ground.

Mo Fan, Lingling, and Jiang Shaoxu were watching far away from the battlefield. The Battlemages had pretty much formed a sturdy wall in front of them, but they could still sense how terrifying the storm was.

For a moment, Mo Fan thought the Sea Skeleton King was right under the Wasteland Battlefield. He had assumed it was less than a kilometer away.

However, he realized the creature was actually still far away as it rose from the water, but its Aura was already causing massive destruction.

He had only seen recordings and images of the Sea Skeleton King, but he could hear its roar and feel the trembling of the sea and the sky now. The Aura alone had even blasted some of the Battlemages with weaker defenses into pieces!

It seemed like he had to reevaluate the Sea Skeleton King’s strength. It was definitely stronger than the Disaster Duo he had encountered in Xiamen!

The creature was extremely dangerous. The Sea Skeleton King would easily kill him if there were no powerful Mages around to share the burden.

Mo Fan was struggling to calm down right now.

The Sea Skeleton King was easily the strongest sea monster he had encountered so far. The fact explained why no one in the Magic City had managed to defeat it so far. It was like the king of the apocalypse, ruling over every living creature. It could trample a human city to dust by itself!

“Why do I feel like Chief Hua is setting us up? I’m afraid only Forbidden Mages would stand a chance against it,” Mo Fan muttered.

Jiang Shaoxu nodded in agreement with him.

There were different levels of strength between Ruler-level creatures. The Ruler-level creatures they had fought so far were only Lesser Rulers. Some of them were even Inferior Rulers, and Mo Fan had not had any trouble taking them on. However, after seeing how massive the Sea Skeleton King was, Mo Fan was starting to doubt if the Creator had granted the sea monsters too much physical strength and power, while He had only given humans a little extra intelligence.

The difference in strength between the sea monsters and humans was too great. The wall that the Battlemages had established was taken down in an instant, countless Battlemages dying as it fell.

“Almost half of the Mages from the sphere of the Dongfang Oriental Tower came here, but they still could not fend off the Sea Skeleton King,” Zhang Xiaohou said sadly.

The membership of the Dongfang Oriental Tower was mainly made up of Advanced and Super Mages. They were working together with the military to kill the Supreme Ruler, but it did not seem to be effective.

Mo Fan was feeling helpless now. The sea monsters that invaded the Huangpu River were only weaklings. The Sea Skeleton King was the real deal!

The Sea Skeleton King was forcing its way forward.

Every step it took would cause the destructive Aura to grow stronger. More people were dying suddenly to the Aura, their blood washed away by the fierce waves.

The pressure kept growing. Mo Fan was already feeling uncomfortable, even though he was already a Super Mage. He felt sorry for the Battlemages who were clenching their teeth and holding their ground.

They were not using their magic to fend off the Sea Skeleton King. They were using their bodies instead!

“That thing is playing with us like a fiddle. We can’t ignore it any longer!” a general yelled furiously.

Was holding their position really going to stop the Sea Skeleton King’s advance? Why weren’t they going after it? Were they going to watch the lower-level Mages die one by one?

“General, if we gather the rest of the generals and the High Seaters of the Dongfang Oriental Tower, we should be able to inflict serious injuries on it, even if we can’t kill it!” the commander shouted.

The people who were talking were in charge of the Wasteland Battlefield. Their eyes were reddened with anger at the Sea Skeleton King.

“Just kill it! If we keep probing it, more of our men are going to die while the Sea Skeleton King remains unharmed!” the general said.

“We better wait for Chief Hua’s orders.”

“Chief Hua is currently busy fending off the sea monsters in the South China Sea. He doesn’t know what’s going on here. We can’t be too passive in a battle. Sometimes, attacking is the best solution!” the general countered.

The commanding officer seemed a little hesitant.

Chief Hua did order them to stand their ground, but the officer also had the right to act according to the situation at hand.

They were familiar with the Sea Skeleton King’s abilities after probing it for the past few days. They had also estimated how many Super Mages they might need to kill the Sea Skeleton King.

It was time to proceed with the plan. Everyone was on standby. If the Sea Skeleton King continued to push forward greedily, they would launch the operation to eliminate the creature.

“Let’s wait a little longer until it steps into the Formation of Heaven-Rupturing Swords to make sure we can inflict serious injuries on it,” the commander ordered.

“But what about my men…”

“Just wait!” the commander insisted.

The general took a deep breath and swallowed his words.

Zhang Xiaohou was going to join the others, but the commander glared at him coldly, not saying a word. Zhang Xiaohou had no choice but to step back.

Mo Fan took a quick glance and discovered many powerful Mages had gathered on the Wasteland Battlefield. He could also see the Top Seaters from the Dongfang Oriental Tower gathering on the other side.

They were all Super Mages! They were here to kill the Sea Skeleton King!

They had waited for so long while probing the Sea Skeleton King’s strength. They were going to strike after they had evaluated the Sea Skeleton King’s strength.

They could not afford to fight the strong sea monster without evaluating its strength first.

Every Super Mage was a precious asset. If they made a mistake evaluating their enemy’s strength, they might end up losing many Super Mages.

If they lost too many Super Mages, they would find it difficult to fend off other Ruler-level creatures that were as strong as the Sea Skeleton King, or some other creatures with special abilities similar to the Black Totem Snake’s poisonous mist.

Holding the enemy back, resisting the enemy, driving the enemy away, and killing the enemy were four very different things

The firepower required to fend off the enemy was lower, as they could just rely on magic Barriers and Formations to suppress the enemy.

They had to have at least the same strength as an enemy to resist it.

Driving the enemy away meant they had to be stronger than the enemy!

As for killing the enemy, they needed even more people to overpower the enemy completely. They also had to come up with a flawless plan to prevent the enemy from escaping!

The Sea Skeleton King was made of water.. If they did not figure out its traits and abilities, sending too many powerful Mages to hunt it would only alert it, yet if they focused too much manpower on taking down the Sea Skeleton King, the sea monsters might be able to break through their defenses elsewhere!
