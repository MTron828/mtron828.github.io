“That undead isn’t huge in size, but its weight is rather shocking. Take a look at its feet; the ground has sunken even though it’s only standing there. Therefore, anyone would end up like Dongfang Lie if the undead rammed into them...” analyzed a female student with short hair and black-framed glasses.

“Dongfang Lie lost earlier than expected. This Egyptian might be one of the strongest on their team. The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy alone is troublesome to deal with. Even the fourth-tier Fiery Fist didn’t do much against it.”

“It’s a tough loss, indeed. If he actually took the initiative, it wouldn’t have ended like this. He could at least have defeated that iron mummy.”

“Who’s going next?”

“I’ll go, my Plant Element can easily handle the undead,” said the female student with glasses.

“Mu Nujiao also has the Plant Element.”

“I’m better than her,” said the female student calmly. She stepped forward from the team and adjusted her heavy glasses.

Bai Dongwei was still lost in his anger. He was getting more annoyed when he saw the widening smile on the Egyptian’s face.

“Yue Tangxin, do you have the confidence to take him on?” said Bai Dongwei, looking at the girl with glasses.

Yue Tangxin nodded.

Sayed’s eyes squinted when he saw his next challenge was a girl; he seemed rather intrigued.

“The big guy here won’t go easy on you. You better prepare your defensive equipment,” Sayed reminded Yue Tangxin like a gentleman.

However, it felt more like the man was provoking her. She remained silent and waited for Bai Dongwei to declare the start of the duel.

It was the same Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy. As Yue Tangxin had speculated, even though the mummy was only three meters tall, its weight was rather shocking.

For example, if a three-meter-tall figure made of wood collided into an ordinary person, they would most likely suffer a few fractures. However, in the case of the iron mummy, most people would have died from the impact!

The iron mummy was incredibly heavy, which was also the reason it could unleash such shocking force with a punch ten meters away, and had taken out Dongfang Lie with a single collision, even though he was still wearing his armor.

Apart from its weight, the Gray-clothed Iron Mummy was nothing to be afraid of.

Yue Tangxin stared at the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy, channeling her magic secretly. Even the brilliance of the Star Orbit was hidden under her feet, to prevent her opponent from seeing it.

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy was pretty straightforward with its attack. It charged at Yue Tangxin once again.

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy seemed to know that Yue Tangxin was preparing her trick under the ground. It decided to jump into the air. The creature could reach ten meters in the air every time it jumped, and each landing would send shards flying, clearly showing its shocking weight.

Yue Tangxin quickly backed away. She no longer had any time to finish her setup as the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy kept chasing after her. As she raised her hands and waved, a faint green light sprinkled across the place like a drizzle.

The ground that had received the drizzle changed immediately, as magic vines as thick as an adult’s arm drilled out and grew rapidly...

“Magic Vine: Grow!”

Yue Tangxin continued to channel the magic. The magic light served as a catalyst to the growth of the magic vines’ saplings. More vines emerged from the ground. The vines gradually thickened as they grew longer. Some grew thorns upon them!

“Magic Vine: Attack!”

Yue Tangxin remained calm. She was not in a panic to attack when the iron mummy was getting closer to her. She purposely waited until the magic vines were in position before making her move.

The spells of the Plant Element needed some time to grow, and with sufficient time, the spells would be able to unleash their maximum potential.

As Yue Tangxin gave the order, the matured vines lunged at the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy.

It was difficult to dodge all the vines. The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy had no chance of escaping regardless of how agile it was.

“Drag it down!”

Yue Tangxin stood between the vines. She did not show the slightest fear towards the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy. She pointed her finger up, commanding the magic vines to seal off its escape when the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy was trying to break free from the vines.

The magic vines were like serpents. They quickly wrapped around the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy’s legs and dragged it to the ground fiercely.

As soon as the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy landed on the ground, several magic vines burst out from the ground and wrapped around its body a few times.

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy tried to break free with brute force. It snapped a few vines in half as it was struggling, but new vines appeared faster than it could break them. The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy soon found itself surrounded by vines, unable to move at all.

“Nice one!”

“Using softness to conquer strength; I would like to see how the iron mummy is going to break free from the vines!”

The students cheered when they saw Yue Tangxin securing the edge in the duel.

The iron mummy who was unstoppable against Dongfang Lie turned out to be a puppet waiting to be trampled on against Yue Tangxin.

“Forest of Kun!”

Yue Tangxin did not give the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy any chance to break free. She immediately cast an Intermediate Spell and summoned a large thicket, surrounding the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy like a sturdy cage!

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy was unable to escape in a short period of time. Bai Dongwei was relieved upon seeing this. Yue Tangxin was very calm and rational with her approach.

She did not cast the Intermediate Spell right at the start. The truth was, the Intermediate Spell, Forest of Kun needed some time for preparation too! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yue Tangxin first used the Basic Spells to produce enough vines under the ground. The vines were used to temporarily restrain the enemy’s movement, buying her time to prepare her Intermediate Spell. Once the ground was fully occupied by the plants, the Forest of Kun would be more efficient.

The fighting style of a Plant Magician was different than most offensive Magicians. It was necessary to focus on the arrangement during a fight, to slowly lure the enemy into the trap according to the situation...

“We don’t have many Plant Magicians in our country...” Sayed seemed rather calm despite the circumstances. He did not seem too bothered when his Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy was entrapped. He slowly said, “However, the fact that you’ve easily dealt with my undead means you’re a lot smarter than the guy from before.”

“Show me what you’ve got!” said Yue Tangxin.

“I don’t really have much, the Undead Element is all I have. The question is, can you trap all of them... Come out!”

The hole from before appeared once again. When everyone thought the undead’s head would pop out first, they were shocked when they saw a huge, black bone saber coming out from the hole first!
