Chapter 2677: Protection of the Star Talismans

“Uh...” Shao Yu was lost for words. The others were also puzzled by Xinxia’s decision!

If they had a Moon Talisman, why weren’t they giving its Blessing to their strongest Mages? Shao Yu’s cultivation was indeed stronger than most people of Fanxue Mountain, but wasn’t it better to give it to Mu Bai, Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, Zhao Manyan, or Mu Jiang? They did not have to care about their dignity in a situation of life and death!

“Go and settle your debt with that scum,” Mo Fan told her.

Mo Fan had already heard about the conflict Shao Yu had with the Southern Mercenary Alliance from Mu Ningxue. It was the reason why Zhao Jing was able to convince them to join the crusade so easily. Bai Hongfei had also offended the Southern Mercenary Alliance when he had stepped forward to protect Shao Yu!

“But Zhao Jing is the strongest among them. How are we going to stop him if he comes?” Shao Yu asked with a puzzled expression.

“The Moon Talisman is only one of my Blessing Spells,” Xinxia said. She looked down the mountain and encouraged Shao Yu, “Your opponent is here!”

Shao Yu saw the mercenaries, who had already reached the Hundred Pines Battlefield. All the mercenaries were elites, led by Du Tongfei. He had a menacing face on, displaying that he had come prepared to kill!

Shao Yu looked at her men behind her.

The elites of the Foehn Hunter Squad were already in position. They had no intention of letting the outsiders reach Fanxue Villa. They had set up a line of defense before charging at the mercenaries.

“We shall dye the Pine Woods with the blood of the intruders!” Shao Yu shouted.

The Moon Talisman Blessing made Shao Yu look like a knight showered by the moonlight, especially since she always wore a leather outfit. The roots of the trees emerged from the ground under the effects of her magic. They interwove and grew into a huge snake before charging at the Southern Mercenary Alliance.

Gu Ying, Zhong Li, Xie Hao, and the rest followed the lead of the snake. Countless Advanced Spells of different Elements began pouring down the mountain like a huge waterfall.

“Guidance of the Stars, Spirits of the Heart!”

Starry lights appeared as the spells clashed fiercely. Spirits in the form of glimmering lights landed unerringly on Fanxue Mountain’s people.

“Power of the Stars!” Shao Yu had just obtained the Moon Talisman Blesing. To her surprise, the lights that followed granted her a different power!

“The spirits of the Stars will look after you on my behalf,” Xinxia’s voice echoed gently in their minds. It felt like a powerful goddess had blessed them with her protection!

Shao Yu and Bai Hongfei looked behind them and saw everyone being surrounded by the special lights. The lights flared brighter when the enemy’s spells landed on them.

The lights would appear just in time and turned into glowing shields, absorbing the damage from the hostile spells!

“Holy crap, it’s giving each of us a shield that can withstand the damage of Advanced Spells!” Zhong Li exclaimed excitedly.

The Star Talisman Blessing was given to every member of Fanxue Mountain. They had no idea that such a powerful spell existed, one strong enough to completely absorb the damage of Advanced Spells!

Countless spells were fired in the first wave. Some of the people were caught by the massive forces unleashed. Casualties were inevitable.

However, the people of Fanxue Mountain were completely unharmed. The Southern Mercenary Alliance was the first to lose some of its men! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What’s going on? What spell is that!?” Du Tongfei yelled when he saw the strange sight.

He did not recognize the Star Talisman Blessing. He could only see that every member of Fanxue Mountain had put on some kind of sturdy armor that did not restrict their movements.

It felt like two armies had crashed into one another. Their enemies were wearing heavy armor, while his men were fighting with bare fists. The difference was extremely obvious!

“The Star Talismans are still brimming with power. Such an impressive spell!” Bai Hongfei noticed the Star Talisman Blessing had remained around his men without showing any signs of dissipating.

“We are unstoppable!” Zhong Li burst out laughing.

“These scum dare to loot a burning house? They are all going to pay for it!” Gu Ying was even more fearless after receiving the Star Talismans’ protection. She Cast a Sky-Flame Funeral at the front line.

Her third-tier Sky-Flame Funeral could easily kill a bunch of the invading mercenaries!

—

The clash between Fanxue Mountain’s people and the mercenaries was the first big-scale fight between the two sides, but both sides were surprised by how one-sided it was.

The alliance consisting of the Nanrong Clan, Zhao Clan, Mu Clan, and North City’s soldiers watched in disbelief.

The Southern Mercenary Alliance had sent out their elites, all of which were at least at the Advanced Level. They were supposed to break down the enemy’s defense with ease and give the others an advantageous opening.

To their surprise, the outcome was decided right at the start of the battle. It was only a matter of time until the mercenaries were defeated!

How was the difference in their strength so huge? Was the outcome of the battle decided by a single person’s spell?

“Star Talismans, the protection of the Stars… Humph, she has given all her Blessing Magic to that useless troop!” Nanrong Ni’s expression darkened when she saw the light of the Stars.

“What’s going on? Does Fanxue Mountain have a Blessing Mage, too?” Nanrong Xu demanded to know.

“I don’t know, but it’s clearly a stupid act. The Star Talismans consume a lot of energy, especially when they are used on more than a hundred people. The person is basically giving all their energy to that troop,” Nanrong Ni smirked.

“They are trying to preserve their men,” Nanrong Xu deduced.

“Mm, but they are still going to die once Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, and the others are taken out,” Nanrong Ni nodded.

Zhao Jing could easily take out the entire troop of Fanxue Mountain by himself. Nanrong Ni was not going to waste her precious magic on the mercenaries!

Their lives had nothing to do with her!
