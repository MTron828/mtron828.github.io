Chapter 3149 ¬†Pick the Weak King

"W-What the hell is that?!" The Duke of Shadow had been sitting confidently outside the city. When he realized that the Black Dragon Flame was aimed straight at him, he quickly moved aside in a panic.

The flame ripped through the empty land outside the city and turned it into a blazing river.

"Is he using the Summoning Element, the Soul Element, or something else?" a tall, shadowy Dark King asked.

The Dark Kings could not figure out what magic Mo Fan was using.

"Darn it! He has stolen my collection!" the King of Night and Day exclaimed angrily.

He was talking about the Black Dragon Emperor, Austin!

In the past, the King of Night and Day had taken the Black Dragon Emperor's soul and buried it under his royal court.

The Black Dragon Soul was tough to control. The King of Night and Day had planned to subdue it by stepping on it for a hundred years, but Mo Fan had managed to awaken it soon after arriving in his territory!

Wen Tai and Asha'ruiya were surprised to see the Black Dragon Soul.

The Black Dragon Emperor used to follow Wen Tai, and Mo Fan learned about it from Asha'ruiya.

However, they did not know that the King of Night and Day had secretly stitched up and sealed the Black Dragon Soul, which should have been freed, under his royal court.

"King of Night and Day, you've gone too far!" Wen Tai expressed his displeasure.

"Do you think the Black Dragon Emperor still belongs to you?" the King of Night and Day replied nonchalantly.

The Black Dragon Emperor was just a collectible from a past battle. He had put in some effort to put its soul back together.

The actual consciousness of the Black Dragon Emperor was gone, and its soul was damaged. Nevertheless, it could still blow out flames as strong as its original form. This attack was deadly in Forbidden Curse battles!

The King of Night and Day never expected Mo Fan to get help from the Black Dragon Emperor. It looked like the Black Dragon Emperor's original consciousness was already more obedient to Mo Fan!

‚Ä¶

Mo Fan possessed a full set of Black Dragon Armor.

He had initially planned to use Summoning Element Magic to call forth a bunch of creatures to fight for him. But as he opened the star vortex, he felt a powerful dragon soul responding to his call.

Hence, Mo Fan tried to connect with it. Soon after, the Black Dragon Emperor unleashed a blast of flame that wiped out the Duke of Shadow's spell. This outcome surprised Mo Fan as well.

"Come back here!"

Mo Fan closed the star vortex to prevent the Black Dragon Soul from disappearing.

He then merged the star vortex into his Black Dragon Armor and gave the Black Dragon Soul an actual place to stay.

With the soul, the Black Dragon Armor evolved once again. It became an invisible aura and surrounded Mo Fan like the Soul Shadow. With a mere thought, it would cover his body in armor.

For a moment, Mo Fan felt like the Black Dragon Emperor was not just a broken soul but more like his Contracted Beast.

He still remembered his battle with Su Lu. He would not have escaped the Dark Abyss without the Black Dragon Emperor's help. Seeing both the body and soul of the Black Dragon Emperor back with him brought him immense relief.

Despite being a black dragon, Austin had faced countless hardships throughout its life.

It finally found a place to call home.

Summoning the Black Dragon Flame was not just a one-time thing.

Mo Fan could summon it again in upcoming battles when the time was right. Once the opportunity came, he would summon the Black Dragon Emperor's fiercest flames!

The flame he had just summoned was just the appetizer.

While lower-level emperors posed little threat to the Dark Kings, they could not afford to underestimate the full power of the Black Dragon Emperor's flames.

At this moment, Mo Fan felt more confident than ever.

"Mo Fan, I can confirm that the Duke of Shadow and the King of Night and Day are here in their physical forms. The others could be in their duplicate forms or physical forms. But even if they're duplicates, they're still powerful," said Mu Bai.

"Got it. We don't need to fight all eight Dark Kings. If we get rid of two of them, the rest will accept us," Mo Fan replied.

"So, the rules are simple. We'll fight the first two who attack us with everything we've got. We won't stop unless we die," Mu Bai added.

"Since you're sure the Duke of Shadow is in his physical form, I won't hold back," Mo Fan declared.

"Sure. That's what I'm thinking too. Let's get rid of the Duke of Shadow first. He's the key to their defeat." Mu Bai nodded.

Wen Tai was standing in the east, with his green eyes hidden under a classy black robe. Although he did not have the biggest, he had a dark presence.

As he rose high into the sky, Asha'ruiya unfurled her six wings and hovered next to his shoulder like a black fairy.

"Since you've made up your mind, don't hesitate," Wen Tai said.

"I get it, but the Duke of Shadow's power‚Ä¶" Asha'ruiya expressed her worry.

Wen Tai and Asha'ruiya had already figured out Mo Fan and Mu Bai's plan.

They were going to get rid of the weak ones first.

If Mo Fan and Mu Bai were to become Dark Kings after they died, two of the present Figures in Eight Directions would need to be removed.

It was smart of Mo Fan and Mu Bai to go after the Duke of Shadow first.

However, they were still facing one of the Dark Kings. Even the weakest Dark King was not someone ordinary humans could take on.

"Stay calm," Wen Tai said.

"I guess seeing Austin affected me. I didn't expect it to follow Mo Fan."

"It's not a bad thing."

‚Ä¶

Perhaps the Dark Plane was always this complicated.

Battling for the throne was the most common source of conflict.

Mo Fan had mentally prepared himself when he decided to enter the Dark Plane.

He kept his eyes on the Duke of Shadow. Even though he had no personal grudge against the duke, he still had to fight him. On the Dark Plane, everything boiled down to the survival of the fittest. Only the strong were respected here!

Since Mo Fan and Mu Bai had disrupted the order of the throne on the Dark Plane, they could not avoid battle. Otherwise, the Dark Kings at the bottom of the ranking would not be at ease!

"No holding back," Mo Fan reminded himself.

He followed the river of fire that the impressive Black Dragon Flame created, and he walked toward the Duke of Shadow, who was still in a panic.

"Duke of Shadow, you're the dirtiest, ugliest, meanest, and most disgusting Dark King I've ever seen. I want you to step down from your throne today. If you're willing to submit to me, I'll spare you. But if you refuse, I'll kill you!" Mo Fan pointed at the Duke of Shadow's figure as he spoke.

His words echoed throughout the Dark Plane.

Challenging a Dark King was like asking for death.

Black Magic existed in the mortal world because of these Dark Kings. They were the ones who gave humans this power. You could also say that Black Magic existed because humans looked up to them.

The Duke of Shadow was the ultimate master of the Shadow Element.

Mo Fan was basically challenging its founder!

The Duke of Shadow sat there with a grim expression.

Why did Mo Fan say he was the dirtiest, ugliest, meanest, and most disgusting Dark King?

Why did Mo Fan not confront Wen Tai? It was Wen Tai who had tricked him into coming to the Dark Plane!

Was it because the Duke of Shadow was weaker than Wen Tai? Or did Mo Fan decide that among the Figures in Eight Directions, the duke was the only one he could challenge?

Mo Fan was picking on the weak one!

Even though the Duke of Shadow was considered weak compared to the other seven kings, someone who had just achieved sainthood had no right to insult and disrespect him like that!

"Do you think you're on my level just because you inherited the Evil Saint King's legacy?" the Duke of Shadow started mocking Mo Fan.

"Listen up, everyone. I'm challenging the Duke of Shadow to a battle. If anyone interferes, I'll fight you. Even if I can only defeat your duplicates or injure you, I still won't hold back!" Mo Fan made up his mind and warned the other seven Dark Kings.

The locals of the ancient dark city were not the only ones watching this battle of the century.

Many dark heroes were also watching from the sky, the ground, the dark mountains, and underground. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

However, due to the intimidating presence of the Figures in Eight Directions, they dared not approach the ancient dark city. They knew that the Dark Kings were "feasting." Anyone capable of making the Dark Kings appear together was no small fry. They were curious and eagerly awaiting this battle.

The Dark Plane was about to see some changes!

The ranking of the Dark Kings was going to shift!

"Hehehe!"

"Hahahaha!"

"Hehe."

Whether they were in their physical forms or duplicates, the Dark Kings merely responded to Mo Fan with laughter.

His challenge was met with arrogant mockery.

"As the future Evil Saint King, you're quite bold. It looks like the Bright Blood King's kindness has given you the wrong idea about the Dark Plane. We don't have to respect you," a tall and thin figure said. It was a female Dark King.

"I'm just stating my conditions. What you all choose to do is up to you," Mo Fan replied.

The female Dark King was probably the Cursed Queen, the most cursed Dark King.

Back when Asha'ruiya guided Mo Fan on the Dark Plane, she had talked about the Cursed Queen, who was almost as strong as the Bright Blood King. The Cursed Queen and the Bright Blood King were sworn enemies, so they would never show up together.

Sure enough, the Bright Blood King was not there.

Her absence showed her stance; she acknowledged Mo Fan as the Evil Saint King and would not stop him from taking the throne in the future.

"Handle your business on your own. It's not your place to tell us what to do," the Cursed Queen said.

"Maybe I should choose you instead." Mo Fan suddenly changed his target and glared at the Cursed Queen.

She trembled slightly when she heard this.

How bold!

Mo Fan's sudden hostility toward her surprised her, but she wore a sharp gaze.

"Although we might not defeat every one of you even if we give our all, we can surely kill one of you. So, think twice before you speak or act from now on." Mu Bai showed no fear toward the Dark Kings.

If all eight of the Dark Kings were there in their physical forms, Mo Fan and Mu Bai would certainly die.

However, Mu Bai had already realized that not all of them were in their physical forms. Some were just duplicates.

While the duplicates might be much stronger than ordinary emperors, Mu Bai knew that if the two of them did not put on a fierce fight, they would be devoured.

The Cursed Queen suddenly fell silent.

She did not expect Mu Bai and Mo Fan to target her.

They were the new Evil Saint King and the undying Dark True Soul. No one knew what abilities the Dark Plane would give them.

Despite being one of the Dark Kings, the Cursed Queen backed down, and her silence caused a stir on the Dark Plane.

Even the Dark Kings got scared sometimes!

"Duke of Shadow, you're still the dirtiest, ugliest, meanest, and most disgusting fellow I've ever seen. I'll kill you!" The awkward atmosphere was gone following Mo Fan's shouting. The ultimate showdown was about to begin, and the Duke of Shadow cursed internally.

Mo Fan's heroism was nothing but a show. He only went after weak individuals!
