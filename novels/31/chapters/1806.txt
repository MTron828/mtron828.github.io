Fanxue Mountain was not open to the public, thus the huge crowd had to gather below the mountain like a riot.

Being unable to watch the duel was torture for those people, who were keen to learn its outcome. Fortunately, people were not to be underestimated when they were united. They finally found a few people who had permission to enter Fanxue Mountain and were willing to broadcast the duel live!

Mu Ningxue was not purposely trying to hide anything. She was simply not fond of having too many unauthorized personnel in her territory. Therefore, she did not mind those who had permission to enter Fanxue Mountain broadcasting the duel.

A video recorder was unable to capture magic spells; the spells would only end up as white flashes on the screen. However, most people were satisfied with the blurry broadcast. It was not like they understood the complicated spells. They just wanted to know the rough situation, who had the upper hand, who was injured, and who had lost the duel!

Humans could behave very strangely at times. If they were unable to watch a duel, they would be extremely anxious and impatient, and would easily spread rumors and exaggerate the situation. As a result, both Fanxue Mountain and Fanxue City were crowded now. They were all waiting for the result.

“A duel of this level is already getting so much attention? The duel between Mo Fan and Zu Xiangtian is going to be even crazier!” Mu Ningxue pulled the curtain to the side. She was able to see the tiny figures gathered on the mountain path from her room. The crowd of people was densely scattered outside Fanxue Mountain.

“Ningxue, are you ready?” Shao Yu asked, standing beside Mu Ningxue. “That He Yao is pretty strong. Both Bai Hongfei and I couldn’t beat him.”

“I’ll need to change first. I didn’t expect him to come today,” Mu Ningxue replied.

“Mm, should we let him wait for an hour or two first? I can’t stand his arrogance,” Shao Yu said.

“Just give me ten minutes,” Mu Ningxue said before going into her changing room. She had initially planned to meditate in her room today, so she was wearing simple clothes that were not suitable for a duel.

Mu Ningxue believed it was unnecessary to give the man the cold shoulder. There was no point wasting one another’s time after she had accepted the challenge. It was rare to find an opponent like him, too. It was definitely a worthy duel!

Fanxue Mountain had a huge dueling area. It was initially designed for the master of demolition, Mo Fan. Only the high-level duels between Advanced Mages would be held here. After all, activating the defensive barrier cost a fortune.

There were only two ways to the dueling ground. One was from the area designated for Fanxue Mountain’s core members, and the other was from Mo Fan’s house. Mu Ningxue was currently living in Mo Fan’s house. Meanwhile, He Yao was brought to the dueling ground from the other path. Bai Hongfei led him to the venue.

“Why are there only a few people? Are you guys planning to make it private to preserve your reputation?” He Yao looked around and did not see any spectators around, not even the people of Fanxue Mountain.

“It was the same for every other challenger who came to us,” Bai Hongfei answered calmly.

Bai Hongfei still held a grudge against He Yao after losing to him during the Young Adults Contest. He was annoyed by the smug look on He Yao’s face. He brought his hands together after bringing He Yao to the venue. “Make yourself at home!”

Bai Hongfei could not be bothered serving the guy. He simply turned around and left.

He Yao was not too bothered by it all. It was normal for him to wait, since he was currently in someone else’s territory. He did not even mind waiting until sunset, as long as Mu Ningxue did not call off the duel.

Everyone would soon know that Mu Ningxue of Fanxue Mountain was not as impressive as the rumors described!

—

He Yao waited patiently at the dueling ground, not bothering to wander around.

He was hoping that there would be some spectators doing a live broadcast, but Fanxue Mountain completely forbade anyone from entering their private land.

Every person enjoyed getting some attention, but he did not mind if the duel took place behind closed doors. It was not like Fanxue Mountain was going to deny their defeat after losing the duel. If they seriously tried to do that, they would no longer have a place in Feiniao City!

A duel behind closed doors. It basically meant they were afraid to let people watch if they somehow lost the duel.

“Huh? Why is someone here?” a voice suddenly came from the entrance.

He Yao collected his thoughts and glanced in the direction of the voice. He saw a well-groomed man with an icy air about him.

“Hurry up and bring Mu Ningxue here,” He Yao said.

“You’re looking for Mu Ningxue? Who are you? What do you want from her?” The man was just about to leave, but he turned around when he heard He Yao’s words.

“Humph, is this how Fanxue Mountain is going to treat me? Or perhaps you guys realize you are going to lose the duel after witnessing my strength, so you’re making fun of me, instead? I thought Fanxue Mountain was better than doing something so absurd!” He Yao was enraged.

Didn’t one of you bring me here and ask me to wait for Mu Ningxue here?! But now, someone has come and asked me why I was here instead! No wonder they do not want any spectators to witness the duel!

“You’re not a core member of Fanxue Mountain. I didn’t ask you why you’re here in this private dueling ground in the first place. Are you trying to stir up trouble here?” the young man shot back after seeing how arrogant He Yao was.

“I’m here to challenge Mu Ningxue! I’m having a duel with her! You piece of trash, hurry up and get Mu Ningxue down here! I’m starting to lose my patience on this trashy mountain of yours!” He Yao was even madder when he realized the man was wasting his time on purpose!

Mu Ningxue had put up a great act by boldly accepting his challenge to a duel in front of the public, yet she had arranged for the duel to be held behind closed doors and did not show herself. She even sent a retard to utter nonsense to him and waste his time. She was not even treating him seriously!

The young man’s face darkened at He Yao’s yell. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The young man was standing at the entrance in the first place. However, he slowly entered the dueling ground and unzipped his jacket, revealing the training shirt under it.

He had just left the Room of Seclusion. He was planning to practice his spells, but to his surprise, he had stumbled into such an unreasonable man!

“First of all, Mu Ningxue is the leader of Fanxue Mountain, so not every nobody has the right to challenge her to a duel. I don’t know how you got here in the first place, but I’ll ask someone to carry you down the mountain very soon!”

“Second, the pain you are going to suffer will seriously remind you that someone like you will never have the right to dishonor Fanxue Mountain’s name!”

“Last, I’m not a piece of trash, my name is Mu Bai!”

Mu Bai was already standing opposite He Yao after he was done with his speech. His eyes were filled with an angry and disgusted light!
