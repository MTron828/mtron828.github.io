The orchestra was trying to assassinate the officials? Was this a terrorist attack?

“Are they out of their minds?”

“So many people are dead!”

The orchestra turned out to be a magic Formation. No one expected that the live background music would turn into a deadly cannon!

Most terrifyingly, the officials went crazy when they realized they were the targets.

The orchestra could not have cared less about the tourists and spectators. They kept firing their spells at the important officials of the Andes Federation!

The Sound Element had a huge area of effect when it was used destructively. Hundreds of people died after a sonic wave swept across the spectator seats.

The tourists there collapsed to the ground.. Blood splattered like paint everywhere as the enjoyable music turned into a butcher’s knife and slaughtered the crowd!

“Stop them, quick!”

“Protect the people!”

“Run, there’s an ambush. All Councilmen, please follow me!”

“Damn it, why do you even care about them? Didn’t you see so many people have died?”

The officials had many powerful bodyguards, yet they did not attack the assassins right away.

Their priority was to guarantee the officials’ safety!

As the situation worsened, a few assassins who had disguised themselves as spectators lunged at the officials, carrying out kamikaze attacks. They were all using terrifying destructive spells!

The people of the Aorus Sacred Institute were on the other side of the arena. Not only was there a barrier in the way, there were thousands of spectators in between them too!

It was not like they were watching the fire burn across the river, but they did not dare to use powerful spells, as they might harm innocent lives.

The seats collapsed as flames surged wildly across the arena. Sonic waves were crushing the crowd like huge and deadly hammers. Their bones were broken as their ears exploded. The dead and those who had sustained heavy injuries were stacked on top of one another. It was nothing but a slaughterhouse!

“Why is this happening?” Boleyn was struggling to stand properly after witnessing the shocking sight.

Even Sunny, who was a Sound Mage, stood there like a statue. He did not know that a group of Sound Mages could deal such a destructive blow.

The whole place was filled with screams, cries of agony, and shrieking.

The murderous music was still playing and the whole process did not last very long, but the casualties were extremely high.

Most people were unsure of what was going on. They were fleeing for their lives mindlessly.

The Mages who were responsible for maintaining order had surrounded the arena, but the problem was there were ‘kamikaze bombers’ among the crowd. They kept tossing destructive spells at the innocent people after the officials had left.

Even an Intermediate Spell could kill over a dozen people in an instant!

A middle-aged man rose to his feet and started murmuring like he was possessed, “Liars, you liars, you drove us away by threatening us with the invasion of sea monsters, yet you turn our lands into factories for your own greed. I have nothing left! I have nothing left!”

Many people were running for their lives in fear, yet he seemed to be enjoying the atmosphere.

He started emitting an icy aura after muttering to himself for a while. It was spreading in all directions without any clear targets.

The walkways began to freeze while the seats were covered in frost. The people on the walkways slipped and caused even more chaos.

“Die, you filthy new federation!” The man was holding heavy ice chains. He flung them at the people who had slipped on the walkways.

The ice chains could easily kill a healthy adult if they fell from a few meters high, let alone when they were being swung around wildly. They could even leave cracks on the cement.

Mo Fan fixed his eyes on the man and instantly cast a Shadow Spell. “Shadow Spikes Bind!”

A lump of shadows appeared under the man’s feet. They stuck out of the ground like wooden spikes and punctured his shoulders, knees, chest, and neck.

The man was no longer able to move after the Shadow Spikes nailed him to a pitch-black cross, like preserving a moth for collection.

Mo Fan did not kill him. He had only Sealed away his mind and body.

—

Soon enough, the law enforcement Mages finally got the orchestra under control.

They only managed to control the situation after killing more than half of the orchestra. The rest of the orchestra was as good as dead, too.

Unfortunately, the kamikaze orchestra had already finished their job. The whole place was littered with corpses and severed limbs.

—

“Those people are f**king crazy!” Zhao Manyan swore.

“What the heck just happened!?”

Mo Fan looked around the bloody stadium before staring at the cloudy rain in the sky.

Why did it happen again? It just happened out of nowhere!

The thing he was worried about had happened again in a different way!

Did the Black Vatican arrange so many assassins for a mere terrorist attack on the Andes Federation?

Mo Fan was still feeling uneasy, even after the situation was already under control.

Blue Bat was willing to sacrifice her life to regain the Black Vatican’s trust, yet what exactly was she trading her life for?

Was the Black Vatican only planning to attack the public tournament?

Impossible!

It was only a single clap of thunder before a wild thunderstorm. It might have gathered a lot of attention, yet it was far from the end.

“Sir!” Miyamoto Shin weaved through the crowd and made his way to Mo Fan with a panicked expression. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What is it?” Mo Fan said.

“Councilman Zhu Meng is asking everyone to retreat.”

“Why?” Mo Fan asked. The battle had only just begun!

“Councilman Zhu Meng just received an update from Half-Ridge Mountain City. The Brown Army has just taken over the city! It will soon cross the Scorching River to attack Banlo City!”

“What do you mean?” Mo Fan was unfamiliar with the different factions that were involved in the Federation here. Besides, the situation of the Federation was very confusing, since there were so many countries involved.

Miyamoto Shin stared at the bloody arena.

“The new Federation will soon announce its disintegration. This city will soon turn into a war zone.”

A war zone!

The new Federation had fallen!

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai stared at him with blank faces.
