Angelo was trying to summon his Wind Wings to protect him, but he had no chance of casting the complicated Advanced Spell. His head was already spinning after he was struck by the lightning. He had no choice but to Summon his armor instead!

Unfortunately, the lightning was strong enough to penetrate his magic armor, too! Most defensive equipment was unable to fully protect a person unless their Elemental type happened to be the Lightning Element’s weakness!

The lightning claws surged across the sky spectacularly. Angelo was as minuscule as an ant facing the giant, astonishing claws of a demon. His thin armor was soon crushed to pieces!

The Sky Lightning Claws exemplified Mo Fan’s rage. If Angelo had been willing to call off the attack targeting Mo Fan’s soul, Mo Fan would not have bothered torturing Angelo with the lightning claws, Since Angelo did not do so, Mo Fan would not show him any mercy, either!

—

Jack, Shreev, Meos, Pinole, and the others were stunned. The icy brilliance of the lightning strikes left them in astonishment and disbelief!

Lightning Element! Since when did he possess the Lightning Element?

And why was his Lightning Element so powerful? Wasn’t the Fire Element his strongest Element?

Hearing Angelo’s cries of agony, the participants saw that the Sky Lightning Claws had finally stopped attacking, but they soon heard Mo Fan invoking coldly, “Tyrant Call!”

Angelo was falling from the sky helplessly, but dense, yellow lightning arcs formed a thick lightning bolt above Angelo’s head and slashed down at him like an axe, slamming Angelo right to the ground at a terrifying speed, forming a scorched pit over a hundred meters wide!

Angelo lay still, his skin completely blistered, even his face was not preserved. His body was still twitching even though he had lost consciousness, as if the claws of demon were still ripping at him.

—

The Observer Eagles had captured the entire scene. Watching it through the eyes of the Observer Eagles were the spectators across the world, including some authoritative Mages.

The stadium fell deadly silent, as if all their minds were struck by lightning, leaving them in awe!

There was clearly no escape for Mo Fan. Even some of the reputable Super Mages assumed that Angelo was going to land his attack. Not a single person thought that Mo Fan was able to turn the tables around. It was like he had completely transformed into a different person, a Lightning Tyrant, severely punishing Angelo for offending him!

“This...this...Miss Conti, that guy is cheating, he’s a member of the Black Vatican!” Prince Beny was the first to react. He desperately wanted some tragedy to befall Mo Fan!

Conti stared at the screen displaying the broadcast from the Observer Eagles, and the student with such an imperious lightning field. It took her a while to respond to Prince Beny’s accusation, “As I thought, his innate talent actually Awakens two Elements at every level. The information I gathered clearly says that his Primary Element is Lightning, and Fire...”

At the seats reserved for the Sacred Hall of Liberty, Oleena noticed the Vice Elder Gisele looking at her and said with a smile, “I did mention to you that this Chinese candidate was the one that helped us arrest Casso, the leader of the Red Ornaments Guild, but you didn’t treat him seriously back then.”

Gisele had no interest in the younger generation. All her focus was on her disciple, Jack. Hearing Oleena’s words, she immediately recalled that the Chinese team had indeed defeated the Red Ornaments Guild, and the magic equipment that Essendale, the master of the Shadow Element, had once worn had been given to the Chinese team as a reward...

No wonder, it all makes sense...

With the Dark Noble Mantle, stealing from other participants would be as easy as flipping a hand!

—

“I told you, the person you should be worried the most isn’t Mu Ningxue, or Ai Jiangtu, but this Mo Fan,” Mochizuki Chihaya said from the seats reserved for the Japanese team.

Fujikata Tegami, Mochizuki Ken, and the advisors and instructors of the national team could only smile poorly.

When the Japanese team was up against the Chinese team, they did not even let Mo Fan take part in the match. In other words, if they ended up facing the Chinese team in the finals, they clearly had no chance of winning!

“That guy managed to take a person out when he was taking on six of them at once. Is he from space?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“My God, we were all wrong! We thought the Fire Element was his strongest Element, but his Lightning Element has a top-tier Domain, and his Soul-grade Seed is one of the strongest, too!”

“How many Elements does he actually have? Why is every Element he has so powerful?”

The people had witnessed Mo Fan’s unstoppable flames in the match against the Spanish team. He almost won the title of the strongest Fire Mage among all the participants in the World College Tournament after just a single match, yet his Lightning Element was even stronger!

Any participant with a single outstanding Element would easily be considered an all-star student during the World College Tournament. Students like Mu Ningxue, Ai Jiangtu, Pinole, and Shou Watani were examples of all-star students, but not only did Mo Fan have two outstanding Elements, he was able to turn the tables when he was greatly outnumbered. The counterattack had he executed to recover from the seemingly impossible situation was incredible, too. The series of moves – knocking the target into the air, tearing the target with the Sky Lightning Claws, and finishing it with the Tyrant Call – was extremely smooth. It was extremely violent, like a piece of artwork, and left Angelo with no chance to react at all!

“He never used the Lightning Element and his Domain, even when he was in a pinch, just so he could take his enemy by surprise when it mattered the most, and deal a critical blow to the enemy! He’s calm yet bold; impressive, that’s the true spirit of a member of the Chinese team! His ability to scheme, to compromise, to fight with all he has, and to endure patiently... and to show no mercy when necessary!” Chairman Shao Zheng exclaimed excitedly, smacking his thigh!

Pang Lai, Han Ji, Feng Li, Song He, and the others were utterly surprised by Mo Fan’s actions, too. Even under those circumstances, he had decided to keep his Lightning Element a secret until the very end, to deal a critical blow and eliminate a threat once and for all. Even they were utterly impressed by Mo Fan’s decisiveness!

“Han Ji, this disciple that you’ve recommended is truly a gem,” a woman official complimented him.

“No no, you’ve misunderstood, he is self-taught, he’s not my disciple... speaking of which, he’s the savior of the Ancient Capital,” Han Ji replied.

“What do you mean by that?” the Chairman asked.

“It was he who brought Captain Zhang Xiaohou into the Dark Abyss, and all the way to the Blood Emperor Throne of the Ancient King...” Han Ji said, but he did not mention the Demon Element.

“Impressive, so it was him!”

“The Calamity of Bo City, the plague in Hangzhou, and the operation that wiped out the Black Vatican on Chongming Island; I believe most of you have heard of them? He is the one that contributed the most in all of them,” Han Ji continued.

The Chairman and other leaders were dumbfounded. It went without saying that they had heard about the incidents before, yet they never thought the same person that saved the Ancient Capital was involved in all of them, and the person was only a student on the national team!

“So you’re saying that his performance in this treasure hunt is actually nothing worth mentioning,” Councilman Shao Zheng murmured.

“Did he actually go too far? Since we’re currently in Venice, Italy’s home ground... strange, Mo Fan normally knows to behave himself, he didn’t need to follow up the attack with the Tyrant Call.”

“It’s a bit too much, but don’t worry about it. It’s reasonable for a young man like him to be hot-blooded. He might have a reason for doing it too; we’ll ask him once it’s over,” Councilman Shao Zheng said.

Mo Fan had overdone it, as Feng Li had mentioned. There was no need for him to follow up with the Tyrant Call, since Angelo would hardly be fit for battle after the initial blow.

However, Mo Fan did not want Angelo to be able to stand when he left!

Besides, he was planning to intimidate the others with it too, since they were still in a disadvantageous position!

“Asshole, it’s only a tournament, are you trying to kill Angelo?” Jack yelled when he saw Angelo in bad shape.

“You can ask what he did when he wakes up,” Mo Fan replied calmly.

Saying this, Mo Fan grabbed in Angelo’s direction to retrieve an insignificant ring from his finger. He quickly put it away.

Jack and the others had no clue what Mo Fan was up to. They simply thought Mo Fan was trying to humiliate the man further.

“I was actually thinking of going easy on you, yet you’re so stubborn! Guess I’ll have to do it the hard way!” Jack said.

“Show me what you got then! I really enjoy stomping arrogant people like you to the ground!” Mo Fan was extremely infuriated. He showed no mercy with his words too.

One versus six?

When Mo Fan first enrolled in the Pearl Institute, he had beaten up every new student. When he first arrived at the school, he had fought every student in the Fire School!

“Scorpion Beast, second form!” Jack ordered coldly into the distance.

The enormous beast with a scorpion tail groaned as it suddenly raised its glowing scorpion tail...

The beast raised the scorpion tail above its head. Surprisingly, it did not lash its tail at Mo Fan, but stabbed itself instead!

Mo Fan could clearly see the poison from the tail pouring rapidly into the beast’s body. The poison acted as a stimulant and swiftly spread to every part of the beast’s body.

The flesh of the beast’s underwent tremendous changes. Poisonous armor surfaced on its skin and attached itself to the beast.

The poisoned armor was not smooth; it was covered in jagged spikes and hooks, like bee stings or cactus thorns, all over its joints, arms, shoulders, spine, and tail. The spikes were firm and sharp!

“The soul that you took from me was supposed to help my Contracted Beast evolve to its third form. No one could possibly stand a chance against me if that had happened. However, its second form, the Poison Armor Scorpion, is enough to make you regret for the rest of your life!” Jack leapt onto the creature’s head.

The creature happened to have a depression on its head that Jack could hop into and cover himself in. It was similar to a pilot seat so he could drive the mecha-beast!
