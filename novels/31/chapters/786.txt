It was the Demon Tree Hand!

Mo Fan clenched his teeth. He already had a taste of the Demon Tree Hand before. That Glorkian who came from India used the same spell when Mo Fan fought him not long ago!

It was the Advanced Spell of the Plant Element. However, the form of the Demon Tree Hand was dependent on the Magician’s Soul Seed. Mo Fan remembered President Han Ji’s Demon Tree Hand was not a tree, but a man-eating demon flower. A whole bunch of Warrior-level undead were completely eaten by his plant. Han Ji was able to cast the Advanced Spell in an instant, too.

Mochizuki Chihaya was also casting was the Advanced Plant Spell. The terrifying Demon Tree Hand would easily knock him flying for a few dozen meters if its attack landed on him.

Mo Fan was aware of how terrifying the spell was. He immediately put on the Black Snake Armor.

As soon as the Black Snake Armor covered him, the Demon Tree Hand appeared out of nowhere, digging out of the ground behind him. Its thick branch slammed down on Mo Fan and pressed him onto the ground!

Mo Fan crawled to his feet and checked his surroundings alertly, trying to predict where the Demon Tree Hand would come from next. To his surprise, he heard the ground underneath him cracking.

“F**k me!” Mo Fan lowered his gaze and his face turned pale.

It turned out that all the ground within a few hundred meters of him was already covered in cracks. The stage under his feet was already infiltrated by the Demon Tree Hand. Only the surface was made of rocks. The area below the surface was crawling with the roots of the demon tree!

Mo Fan could not react at all. The surface cracked open in an instant, revealing a huge pit full of vines wriggling like enormous pythons. The demon tree had dug a shocking trap under the ground. It was planning to drag Mo Fan right into its mouth!

The mouth of the demon tree was incredibly huge. The dueling ground was made up of layers of rock, yet the demon tree managed to infiltrate them and gain control of the area. A hole with a radius of a hundred meters appeared at the center of the stage, inside it vines and branches that would shred a victim to pieces. Below the hole was a bottomless pit!

The representatives of the Chinese team were completely stunned. They found it hard to believe how strong Mochizuki Chihaya was.

She seemed quite adept at casting the Advanced Spells. The abyss of the Demon Tree Hand was not something they had a chance to escape from.

Mo Fan felt absolutely minuscule as he fell into the hole made by the Demon Tree Hand. If Mochizuki Chihaya was trying to kill him, the others would not be able to find his remains!

“Strange, something isn’t right!” Ai Jiangtu had already noticed something. He slowly walked toward the Japanese team.

Mo Fan was already very strong. He had already cast an Advanced Spell and followed up with the powerful combination of the Fire and Lightning Elements. If his opponent was only a student, she would have already lost the duel. Even if Ai Jiangtu was fighting Mo Fan, he would be injured too.

On the other hand, Mochizuki Chihaya was only in a troublesome situation, but she was perfectly unharmed until now. It did not make any sense!

“Who would have thought, Miss Chihaya had to cast this spell just to defeat him,” sighed the Japanese man with spiky hair.

He rose from his seat when he saw Ai Jiangtu approaching. him

“Who is she?” Ai Jiangtu fixed his eyes on Mochizuki Ken and Fujikata Tegami.

“Why did you ask?” asked Fujikata Tegami calmly.

“Her strength...”

“We never said she was a student,” said Fujikata Tegami.

Ai Jiangtu frowned. He was about to say something when Mochizuki Ken spoke, “We made it clear that Mochizuki Chihaya wasn’t an option. He could only choose the nine students in the front row.”

“HAHA, I bet he has already learned his lesson! There’s no point hiding the truth now; Miss Chihaya is our battle instructor! She’s not a student of the National Training Hall!” exclaimed the Japanese student with spiky hair.

“She...she’s not a student?”

“Mm, although she used to be my disciple, she’s no longer a student. She’s currently the instructor of the gatekeepers,” said Fujikata Tegami.

“Damn, I was wondering why the woman is ridiculously strong. She’s a battle instructor, a teacher!” Zhao Manyan’s jaw almost fell to the ground.

“Are you serious, asking a teacher to fight a duel with us? This doesn’t count!” Jiang Yu immediately jumped up from his seat.

How shameless were these Japanese, to let an instructor fight against a student? No wonder Mo Fan was having trouble winning the duel despite his outstanding talents. It was never a fair duel to begin with!

“Humph, didn’t we try to stop him? He insisted on choosing Miss Chihaya as his opponent, and he even provoked us!” shot back the Japanese man with spiky hair.

As a matter of fact, he was the actual captain of the students. Mochizuki Chihaya never sat in the same row as them, but in the row behind them. Even Guan Yu had assumed Mochizuki Chihaya was their captain, thus she was sitting behind the others on her own. To their surprise, that was not the case.

“It doesn’t matter if the duel counts or not, we’ve already asked you to choose another candidate before the duel. It’s not like we’re purposely hiding the truth, but someone is just too stubborn, who insisted on fighting Mochizuki Chihaya,” said Fujikata Tegami.

Ai Jiangtu, Jiang Yu, Nanyu, Zhao Manyan, and the others immediately recalled how Mo Fan did not even give them a chance to explain. He simply yelled out and demanded to fight Mochizuki Chihaya like a maniac...

The person he was picking on was an instructor. How could she possibly stand it when Mo Fan was pointing at her and provoking her?

“To be honest, I would rather say I don’t know who that idiot is,” Zhao Manyan slapped his forehead. After learning Mochizuki Chihaya’s true identity, he immediately had a headache when he recalled how scornful Mo Fan was before.

Mu Ningxue stared at the enormous pit and heard Mo Fan’s screams of agony coming out from it. She began to wonder whether Mo Fan actually had a brain.

If Mo Fan had not barked like a mad dog at the start and asked carefully, he would not be tortured so badly now...

Inside the pit, Mo Fan was continuously being struck by the vines and had no clue what was happening on the surface.

The Black Snake Armor had significantly increased his defense, yet it was still extremely painful when the vines continued to bat him around like table tennis!

“Goddamnit, she’s so strong! It looks like I can no longer give her an advantage by using one less Element!

“Little Flame Belle, possess!” Mo Fan roared. He had finally to take the duel seriously!

Mo Fan had only summoned Little Flame Belle before to break free from the cocoon. He did not rely on her power in the duel, but judging from the situation, he would lose horribly if he hesitated to use his trump card!
