“That guy is an Executioner of the Black Vatican. He’s extremely strong, and most of them are arrogant and lawless. There is no assassination or murder that they won’t do. These guys are pretty scary,” Oleena told Mo Fan.

It was Mo Fan’s first time hearing about the Executioners. The Blue Deacons that he had stumbled into before were nowhere as strong as that man. Most of them only hid in the dark, plotting great schemes against defenseless people!

“If they sent an Executioner for you, they must be really keen to take you out,” the Purple Wind Mage said.

“Either way, it’s best for you to stay at the Sacred Hall of Liberty for now. The Executioners are unpredictable, and are good at disguising themselves. Once, an Executioner of the Black Vatican managed to murder someone in the National Magic Association and snuck away unharmed. If you don’t want to die at such a young age, you should only leave after we’ve investigated the matter,” Oleena told Mo Fan seriously.

Their superiors of the Sacred Hall of Liberty were infuriated too. The Black Vatican was bold enough to stir up troubles in their city. They immediately sent out lots of Sacred Hall Mages to search for the Executioner in the city.

However, for some reason, Mo Fan had a feeling that they would not bring back any good news. If the Executioner dared to show up at a place like this, he must be confident that he would not get caught...

—

As he thought, the Sacred Hall Mages did not find any trace of the Executioner despite searching the city for three days.

It did not make sense for Mo Fan to stay at the Sacred Hall of Liberty for the rest of his life. Knowing that a girl was severely injured and was admitted into the hospital because of him, he immediately picked up his phone and dialed the number on the card.

“Hello, is it you, the Mage?” he immediately heard the girl’s sweet voice from the other end.

“How did you know it was me?” Mo Fan was curious.

“I came to this city on my own, so the only person that could call me has to be you,” the girl said. Her voice was light and cheerful, she did not sound like she was feeble and weak. She must have recovered well, and had a cheerful spirit.

“I’m sorry for dragging you into this mess,” Mo Fan said apologetically.

“How is that your fault? You saved my life. So, did you catch that guy?” the girl asked.

“Not yet, I think he’s good at disguising himself,” Mo Fan said.

“Is that so? But I think I’ve seen him before,” the girl said.

“You met him before?” Mo Fan asked curiously.

“I will remember anyone that I’ve met despite the makeup or disguise they put on. I also know his surname,” the girl said.

“But how?”

“He came to buy a drink around ten minutes before you arrived. There were quite a few customers there, so I asked for his surname so I could put it down on his order. He told me a surname straightaway without hesitation. I feel like he wasn’t trying to hide it. I guess a powerful and evil Mage like him would never expect I would remember him,” the girl said to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was enlightened. He did not expect the girl he had protected at the cost of injuring himself was such an observant person!

“Great, can you describe his appearance in detail? I’ll ask someone to investigate him!”

Mo Fan immediately contacted the all-knowing Lingling. Lingling was a Hunter, thus she was quite an expert when it came to drawing portraits. She proceeded to draw the man’s appearance from the girl’s description.

“Do you think his surname is real?” Mo Fan asked Lingling.

“According to the coffee girl, it’s most likely his actual surname, or a surname that he always uses as his disguise. Either one is good enough for me to hunt him down. Give me a second, I’ll link up to New York Police Department’s database; they should have a better collection of data of the criminals there,” Lingling said.

In the garden of a Duke’s mansion, a man in a public worker’s uniform was sweeping fallen leaves in the rain. He was wearing a raincap, and had a slight hunchback. He looked rather feeble.

“HAHA, the Sacred Hall Mages of the entire city are looking for you, and yet you’re sweeping leaves here so casually. How daring of you!” A young boy who seemed to be around the age of sixteen walked up to the cleaner. His glittering purple eyes had a unique charm to them, and his mixed-blood face had the handsomeness of an Asian with clear and defined facial features of a Westerner, making him a Prince Charming!

“The most dangerous place is actually the safest place,” the worker lifted his gaze slightly. His sharp jaw was pointing at the purple-eyed young boy.

“You did well,” the purple-eyed young boy grinned.

“It hasn’t been this exciting for a long time. I remember my last encounter with the Sacred Hall Mages was around twelve years ago... I feel like they are as useless as they were during the past ten years,” the cleaner said.

“Don’t worry, we’ve already paid them our respects on your behalf. But, I’m a Virgo, so I prefer that everything is done perfectly,” the purple-eyed young boy said.

“You are referring to the fact that I didn’t kill him on the street?” the cleaner asked.

“Yeah, Salan seems to be very interested in that kid. It’s good enough if we can kill him, but if we can take him in alive, I believe Salan is willing to give you a great present,” the purple-eyed young boy said.

“I prefer to kill. Don’t worry, once the situation improves, he won’t live for long!” the cleaner declared.

“I’ll leave it to you then. Executioner, we’ll be leaving tonight.”

“Please express my gratitude to Salan for the favor twelve years ago!” the cleaner said.

“I will!”

In the meeting room of the Sacred Hall of Liberty, ten Sacred Hall Mages were seated at the table. Their eyes were staring at the enlarged face projected onto the screen.

“This is bullshit!” the Sacred Hall Mage seated at the leading spot rose to his feet furiously.

“It’s what I’ve learned from my investigation. You can choose to believe it or not, but what you think is none of my business,” Mo Fan said.

Oleena sat in the middle of the table. She also found the result hard to believe.

The man that Mo Fan found from his investigation was quite shocking, as he was a Sacred Hall Mage dismissed around ten years ago!

The man was called Philip. He had joined the Sacred Hall of Liberty around twenty years ago. He was an Ice Mage, but because of a mistake he made, he was expelled by the Sacred Hall of Liberty, and had since disappeared.

The man’s appearance and surname fit Lingling’s investigation perfectly. Most importantly, he had mastered the Ice Domain a long time ago, and the effects of his Domain was in summoning hailstones across the area five hundred meters across!

If it wasn’t for this characteristic, Mo Fan would not dare to reveal his findings to the Sacred Hall of Liberty. After all, it was extremely humiliating that the Executioner of the Black Vatican was once a Sacred Hall Mage. Their sacred code and vows to never betray the organization were nothing but pure bullshit now.

“Captain, I actually wanted to tell you a few days ago, but since I didn’t get a clear look at the man’s face, I didn’t want to accuse him falsely. The Executioner indeed looks like Philip, and he seemed to recognize me, too. He left as soon as I arrived,” the Purple Wind Mage said in a deep voice.

There were four aged Sacred Hall Mages on the table who had been in the organization for more than twelve years. Their faces fell dark when Philip’s name was mentioned, as if they did not want to remember him again for the rest of their lives. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Humph, if it’s really him, we can’t possibly let him escape. How dare he join the Black Vatican? He’s a disgrace to the Sacred Hall of Liberty!” the captain, a man named Luther, snapped furiously.

“The question is, how are we going to find him? I’m afraid it’s going to be really tricky. Philip is an expert at carrying out undercover missions. He’s able to disrupt anyone’s vision with his Psychic Element, and he’s great at tricking people’s minds, too. His ability to disguise himself is unmatched,” the Purple Wind Mage said.

“Just some petty tricks! All of you, stop sitting here and getting all rusty, move out with the others. As long as he’s still in New York, there’s no way he can run away from us. A person like him must be held on the torch, so the sacred flame of the Statue of Liberty can cleanse his corrupted flesh and spirit!” Captain Luther said.

New York Airport, a cute little girl with two ponytails was dragging a suitcase by herself as she slowly moved her way up some stairs.

The escalator had broken down. Her luggage was pretty heavy, thus she was having quite some trouble moving it.

A young boy who was heading for the entrance spoke some words to the man in a red shirt beside him before he approached the young girl with a polite smile.

“Do you need any help?” the young boy asked politely.

Lingling lifted her gaze and saw the mixed-blood young boy. She was intrigued by his purple eyes.

Before Lingling could respond, the young boy lifted the heavy luggage with a single hand...

“It’s pretty heavy, what do you have inside?” the young man smiled gently and asked in an indifferent manner.

“Just some electronic devices, you can put it down if it’s too heavy, I’ll ask an adult for help.”

“I am an adult,” the purple-eyed young boy used both his hands and slowly dragged Lingling’s luggage up the stairs. Most people had not Awakened at his age. Even if he was a Mage, his flesh would not be that much stronger than an ordinary boy. The young boy tried his very best and finally moved the heavy suitcase to the top of the stairs.

After arriving at the top, the wheels would simply do the favor for Lingling. She pulled the handle out and continued on her way along the smooth surface.

“Hey, not even a thanks?” the purple-eyed young boy yelled at Lingling.

“Thanks,” Lingling turned around and said.

“Do you have a phone?”

“I do.”

“What’s your number?”

“I have no intention of telling you that,” Lingling proceeded to where the cabs were without turning her head around.

The purple-eyed young boy awkwardly rubbed his nose, staring at the girl’s back.

The man in a red-shirt came over and said with a grin, “It’s quite a let-down, isn’t it?”

“Just a bit.”

“I’ll kidnap her for you.”

“Am I the kind that really needs to go to that extent just to win a little girl over?” the purple-eyed young boy said.

The man pondered for a while, before he nodded confidently and said, “You are!”

The young boy rolled his eyes and continued on his way.

“Is it fine to leave the Executioner alone here in New York?”

“He can handle it.”
