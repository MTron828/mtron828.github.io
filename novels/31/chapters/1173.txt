“What... Izisha’s corpse was chopped into pieces?” Both Haylon and Shawshank were infuriated.

A few older Golden Sun Knights were furious too.

Izisha was their previous Goddess. Many had devoted their lives to her. The Golden Sun Knights were willing to risk their lives to take down anyone with the slightest disrespect to her!

“How is that possible? Did you make a mistake!?” Haylon demanded in disbelief.

“The Great Muse said perhaps Asha’ruiya has always held a grudge against Izisha for voting the Stone of Guilt. She took hold of the opening amid the chaos to get her revenge. It doesn’t matter if she did it or not, we have to stop her from leaving the Mountain of the Goddess,” Lanjin said.

“But... she already went into the magic formation!”

“I will lead some men and go down the mountain through the Starry Mountain Path, to intercept her and prevent the Black Totem Snake from leaving with the offender, Ye Xinxia,” Lanjin stated.

“Alright, Vice Hall Master Lanjin, you will bring these men to the other side of the magic formation!” Haylon immediately dispensed his men to Lanjin without hesitation.

Lanjin led the elites among the knights and quickly proceeded to the mountain path. It was the only way down the mountain without being targeted by the magic formation.

The knights and Adjudicators led by Haylon and Shawshank were occupied with the battle against the Black Totem Snake. They were totally unaware of what was going on at the top of the mountain. Asha’ruiya had only gone to the Hall of the Goddess when she had sensed that a great conspiracy was taking place, and she had almost died because of it!

—

After entering the magic formation, Asha’ruiya raised her head and glanced at the Skyscraping Snake.

The magic formation was not targeting her. After all, her adoptive father was the one that set up the magic formation. No one was more familiar with it than Asha’ruiya.

“Mo Fan, I will bring you guys out of the magic formation!” Asha’ruiya yelled at the Black Totem Snake.

Mo Fan and Xinxia were being targeted by the magic formation too. If the Black Totem Snake had not protected them, the magic formation would have turned them into ashes long ago.

Mo Fan was a little suspicious when he saw Asha’ruiya. However, he decided to believe in her. If she was actually trying to set them up, she just needed to stand aside and watch.

“Big guy, don’t hurt her,” Mo Fan said to the Black Totem Snake.

The Black Totem Snake moved his tail and scooped Asha’ruiya up, lifting her to his head.

Asha’ruiya landed on the Black Totem Snake’s head. The wild energy of the magic formation suddenly halted, allowing the Black Totem Snake to catch his breath.

“Ask the snake to move toward the valley, I’ll clear a path for you,” Asha’ruiya blurted out with a grim look.

Mo Fan immediately relayed the information to the Black Totem Snake.

The Black Totem Snake was struggling to move inside the magic formation. He would trigger strong traps if he was too careless.

However, when following Asha’ruiya’s instructions, the Black Totem Snake clearly sensed that the magic formation was growing weaker, allowing him to move closer toward the exit.

“You’re injured?” Mo Fan quickly noticed that Asha’ruiya had scorch marks on her.

“The whole thing is a conspiracy!’ Asha’ruiya said.

“What happened?” Mo Fan asked.

“The four Saintesses aren’t the candidates of the election; the only candidate is the previous Goddess, Izisha!” Asha’ruiya snapped furiously.

“Isn’t that woman dead already?” Mo Fan said.

“Yes, or so everyone thought, but you forgot that the Parthenon Temple has the Spell of Resurrection!” Asha’ruiya said.

Spell of Resurrection!

The Parthenon Temple had such an exalted status mainly because of their Spell of Resurrection. However, the role of the Goddess had been unoccupied for quite some years, thus no one had seen the Spell of Resurrection for years!

Asha’ruiya glanced at Ye Xinxia and said, “You were always treated as a sacrifice to resurrect Izisha. Someone already learned your true identity the first day you stepped into the Parthenon Temple. They have been setting you up and have long waited for this day, to sentence you with the Dark Execution. Once Izisha is resurrected, she will reclaim the role of the Goddess, and be granted the Spell of Resurrection that she was never able to get her hands on!”

“My true identity?” Ye Xinxia was utterly confused. Didn’t everyone accuse her of being Salan not long ago?

“Have you really lost all your memories when you were still a kid? Or did Salan use the Amnesia Bug on you so you won’t remember it?” Asha’ruiya said.

“I really don’t know,” Xinxia said.

“Asha’ruiya, what do you mean by that? Xinxia is not Salan!” Mo Fan said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s true that she isn’t Salan, but she’s still closely related to Salan!. Mo Fan, you must admit that there’s no way she can’t remember what happened in the past, before she was staying at your place,” Asha’ruiya said.

“I really don’t remember, I only know that I’ve been to a lot of strange places. I initially thought I don’t remember because I was still too young. I can only remember the things after I moved to Bo City with my mum...” Xinxia said.

“Do you know why you and your mum went to Bo City?” Asha’ruiya said.

Xinxia shook her head.

“Back then, Izisha was hunting you and your mum. The two of you were on the run, and you eventually reached Bo City. You are Wen Tai’s daughter!” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan was greatly confused. Wasn’t Asha’ruiya Wen Tai’s daughter? Why was Xinxia her daughter all of a sudden?

“I was adopted, Ye Xinxia is his true daughter! She has Wen Tai’s blood flowing in her, but that’s not the main point,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Then what is?” Mo Fan said.

“Wen Tai was called the Holy Saint because his cultivation and mental power surpassed his sister, Izisha. Izisha was elected as the Goddess, but there was one thing that she didn’t inherit, the Soul of the Parthenon Temple. The Soul of the Parthenon Temple will attach itself to the new Goddess that is elected. It will grant the Goddess the Spell of Resurrection, making her the true ruler of the Parthenon Temple. Back then, Wen Tai’s name had spread across the world, and the Soul of the Parthenon Temple intuitively attached itself to him. Wen Tai was the one with the Spell of Resurrection. Even though Izisha was the Goddess, she gained her power through violence and brute force. She did not earn the approval of the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, hence she did not have the Spell of Resurrection,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan immediately remembered Asha’ruiya once mentioned that Izisha had voted with the Stone of Guilt to sentence Wen Tai to death. The reputable man was then executed without mercy. It turned out that Izisha did not cast the vote because she believed that Wen Tai was guilty, but because of the jealousy that had long filled up her heart!

Despite being a Goddess, she had never earned the approval of the Soul of the Parthenon Temple. It was obviously a humiliating blow to her. On top of that, Wen Tai’s reputation had exceeded hers. Even as his sister, Izisha could not stand Wen Tai’s existence!

“So this is the truth behind Wen Tai’s death?” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was not interested in the reason behind Wen Tai’s death, but he was quite surprised that Xinxia was actually Wen Tai’s daughter. Wouldn’t that mean Xinxia was living incognito in Bo City before she ended up staying in his house?

“Does that mean Xinxia enrolling in the Parthenon Temple and being promoted all the way to a Saintess was part of their arrangements too?” Mo Fan said.

“The Hall Mother should know Xinxia’s identity. She voted Wen Tai guilty, thus she decided to promote Xinxia to a higher position. However, her decision was reckless; she basically placed Xinxia in the control of the people who are planning to resurrect Izisha!” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan still had lots of things he did not understand. He was about to ask further when he saw the Black Totem Snake had left the magic formation of the sacred mountain.

Asha’ruiya had brought them out of the magic formation as she promised, but Mo Fan could not feel any joy, as lots of Mages of the Parthenon Temple were already waiting for them outside the magic formation.

The Parthenon Temple had even sent out their Mages of Faith. Mo Fan saw a whole army of them standing on the top of a mountain nearby. There were at least a thousand of them!

More troops were on standby at the base of the mountain. As for the Adjudicators and knights, some were flying in the sky, some stood on high grounds in formations. They had no intention of letting the Black Totem Snake escape!

They had wasted too much time breaking through the magic formation, yet it was the only way out of the Parthenon Temple. Based on the information that Asha’ruiya had given them, Mo Fan knew the Parthenon Temple was determined to kill Xinxia, as she played an important role in the resurrection of Izisha.

Mo Fan let out a hollow laugh when he saw the armed force of the Parthenon Temple moving into position.

Xinxia was not Salan, the accusation was no longer valid, yet these people still insisted on murdering the innocent girl.

The truth never mattered, nor was the question if the girl was guilty or not, since power was the most important thing. With power, they could sentence a person guilty or innocent; with power, these evil people could do as they pleased! Both Wen Tai and Xinxia were sharing the same fate!

“Did that b**ch Izisha really come back to life?” Mo Fan turned around and glanced at the magnificent Hall of the Goddess.

“Yeah, I saw her open her eyes. Her loyal subordinates have gotten rid of all the Saintesses. Once she comes back to life, she could easily tell the people that she had no choice but to reclaim the role of the Goddess since all the candidates were involved in accidents.” Asha’ruiya immediately felt hopeless when she saw the scale of the army in ahead. She said in a self-mocking voice, “What difference would it make now? There’s no way we can escape this place.”

Even a Forbidden Mage would have trouble breaking through the army!

It was the reason why those people would use even the most detestable methods, just to hold on to their power!
