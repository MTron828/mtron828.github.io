Chapter 2526: Lab Rat Mo Fan

Translated by XephiZ

Mo Fan instantly walked back to Feng Zhoulong and Sharjah.

Did they really figure out how to put Magic Fusion into practice?

Wouldn’t that mean altering the current structure of human magic?

“The tougher the environment, the easier it is for a species to evolve. Our enemy was once a species on land, but they have evolved into a stronger species in the sea. We can’t allow ourselves to be stuck in a rut if we are to fight them!” Feng Zhoulong declared.

He was absolutely right. The Light Element, Shadow Element, and Dimensional Magic had been discovered while mankind was in great danger.

Powerful enemies had washed the cities along the coastline with blood, but humans were gradually improving and innovating while defending their territory!

Feng Zhoulong had devoted his whole life to discovering new power, but it had been extremely difficult to find something that was achievable by everyone.

He had only made progress after he found a special organ crystal and learned the secrets of Magic Fusion through it!

“This belonged to a rare species of sea monsters with four colors. It has the attributes of the Water, Ice, Earth, and Shadow Elements. It can also fuse the Water and Shadow Elements, and the Ice and Earth Elements. It took us great effort just to secure an organ crystal of the Four-Colored Demons, the key we have been searching for to open up a new gate!” Feng Zhoulong was extremely excited.

As a matter of fact, he had yet to disclose his discovery to the public.

Finishing the research was one thing, but putting it into practice was another thing. It was like writing a program. They had to run the program to find out the bugs!

Mo Fan was the first person to come to Feng Zhoulong’s mind. It was very important to keep such a valuable discovery confidential to avoid theft or sabotage. Feng Zhoulong had to carefully choose who he tested it on.

Most importantly, Mo Fan had double the number of Elements of normal Mages. The Magic Fusion involved combining different Elements, so Mo Fan, who possessed the Lightning, Fire, Earth, Shadow, Summoning, Space, and Chaos Elements, was the perfect candidate to be the lab rat.

As for Mo Fan, his first priority was to become stronger!

The Dark Material he currently possessed was already mixed with substances of the Chaos Element. The combination of the Chaos and Shadow Elements was extremely powerful. The assassin Bei Jiang was the perfect example.

Bei Jiang had merged the Shadow and Chaos Elements, but that was only possible because of his Innate Talent.

Feng Zhoulong’s goal was to give every Mage the special ability to combine different Elements, allowing Mages with two or more Elements to use the new power.

It would increase the overall strength of human Mages by diversifying their magic!

“We’ll try it on you first, and if it’s suitable, we will spread it through the whole country!” Feng Zhoulong exclaimed.

“Sure, I’ll be the beta tester!” Mo Fan agreed.

Mo Fan decided to stay in Guangzhou for a few more days. It would also give Lingling, Jiang Shaoxu, and Zhao Manyan more time to collect information about the lightning serpent!

Magic Fusion was a very difficult thing to achieve, as every spell had to follow a fixed structure.

The general procedure was focusing one’s attention, connecting the Stars, completing the Star Orbits, and Casting after releasing the spell.

It was like a standard formula. If any of the steps were missing or manipulated, the process would fail.

Most people could only focus on one thing at a time. It was like when a person was drawing a circle with one hand. It would be difficult to draw another shape with the other hand.

The biggest challenge of Magic Fusion was mastering the ability to focus on two things at the same time. Not many people could draw a Star Constellation of the Fire Element while drawing a Star Constellation of the Ice Element.

Secondly, different Elements would often clash and trigger an Elemental explosion. The energy became extremely unstable when two different Elements were combined. Not only would they go out of control, the explosion might also injure the Caster!

Feng Zhoulong claimed Sharjah was a blessing for him because of her Innate Talent that gave her the ability to multitask.

She had given Feng Zhoulong the chance to experiment on his speculation. It was no longer just a plausible idea he was thinking about!

With Sharjah’s help, Feng Zhoulong was able to determine the challenges of Magic Fusion. They eventually solved the challenges and had a desirable outcome!

“So I’ll have to practice multitasking first, right?” Mo Fan clarified.

“That won’t be necessary. Not everyone can do that. Just construct the simplest Star Orbit,” Feng Zhoulong told him.

Mo Fan followed Feng Zhoulong’s instructions.

He constructed a Star Orbit of the Fire Element by connecting the seven Stars. He was extremely familiar with the process, and could even do it subconsciously. He remembered how he had practiced it until his head hurt when he first learned magic.

“I’m done. What now?” A bright sprout of fire was burning on Mo Fan’s palm.

The small Fire Burst was still giving off great heat because of his Phoenix Flame. Feng Zhoulong and Sharjah were astounded.

“A Heaven-grade Flame? Mo Fan, you are going to drive the old Fire Mages of the Magic Association mad!” Feng Zhoulong chuckled.

“What’s next? I must tell you, I won’t be able to Channel a different spell before I toss this somewhere,” Mo Fan warned him.

“Take this!” Feng Zhoulong quickly handed a short rod to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan took the rod. He noticed the thing was like the magic wands from Harry Potter. It was thin and silvery, like the baton that conductors used. He immediately looked at it strangely.

Mages had never needed weapons. The staves that some old Mages used were just some Equipment with special effects.

He had to say that he did not want to wave a little wand around in a fight. It would make him look like an idiot if it had no special effects.

“Don’t mind the Wand. It could be a ring, a bracelet, or a necklace. It’s just a medium. Try it again, but this time, focus the magic on the Wand instead of your hand,” Feng Zhoulong told him.

Mo Fan was doubtful, but he still followed Feng Zhoulong’s instructions.

He constructed a Star Orbit and Cast Fire Burst.

The Phoenix Flame should have set the Wand on fire. To his surprise, the Phoenix Flame instead erupted from his palm a second later.

It was delayed by a second of time?

“See that? The Wand can store the Fire Burst for a second. You are free to use other Elements during that time!” Feng Zhoulong said excitedly.

Mo Fan immediately gave it a try. He Cast Lightning Strike during the delay.

Lightning flickered between the fingers on his left hand after he constructed the Star Orbit.

The lightning had appeared at the exact same time as the Fire Burst on the Wand! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the past, Mo Fan was able to hold lightning in his left hand and fire on his right hand because he was switching between spells rapidly, but he still had to cast the spells in order. He had to finish the first spell and release it before using the second spell.

But now, the two spells were coexisting!

After all, he had yet to release the Fire Burst.. He was basically holding it with his hand!
