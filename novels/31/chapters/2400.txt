“Mo Fan, we should go with them to the Advanced Enforcement Union. We can’t really explain what happened just by giving them a little information and evidence,” Lingling urged him.

Lingling was not asking Mo Fan to go easy on Wan Tong. She also needed to go to the Advanced Enforcement Union to investigate something.

“Sure, we can go, but not under their custody. I’ll drag them with us instead!” Mo Fan declared. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The four of you, stay here and collect evidence from the scene. The three of you, and Wan Tong, you are going to the Advanced Enforcement Union with us!” Lingling ordered them.

The Enforcers were dumbfounded.

Why was the little girl acting like she was their leader? They were the ones who had attacked the Enforcers first!

Mo Fan was not kidding about dragging Wan Tong to the Dongfang Oriental Tower.

He took the lift to the highest level.

The Enforcement Union was the law enforcement body established by the government and the Magic Association. It was mainly there to ensure Mages obeyed the laws of the country and the Magic Association.

As for the Advanced Enforcement Union, Mo Fan had never met anyone from there before, even though it had been stationed in the Magic City all along.

—

“What do you think you are doing? You shoved a knife into his throat like a hoodlum. You came into the Oriental Pearl Tower holding an Advanced Enforcer hostage like a terrorist!” the Vice President of the Enforcement Union snarled at him.

Wan Tong felt relieved after he was escorted to the Vice President. He almost dropped to his knees as he pleaded his case.

“Vice President, this man is nothing but a criminal! My instincts are telling me he’s the culprit behind everything! It is reasonable for us to arrest him since he isn’t willing to cooperate with us and even dared to attack us! He’s disrespecting the Magic Constitution, the country, and the Advanced Enforcement Union!” Wan Tong exclaimed, his eyes red with emotion.

The feeling of the shadow blade being stuck in his throat had been absolutely miserable. Wan Tong had never felt so humiliated in his life!

“President Feng, we can’t forgive him easily regardless of his background!” Wan Tong persisted loudly.

“Go rest outside for now,” President Feng waved his hand impatiently at the enforcer. Wan Tong could only glare at Mo Fan before leaving the room.

President Feng fixed his eyes on Mo Fan after having Wan Tong leave.

Mo Fan had remained smiling throughout the conversation. He did not treat his vile behavior as anything serious.

“You’re pretty full of yourself right now, aren’t you? There’s no place for your advisor in your eyes anymore, is that it?” Feng Li asked him.

“Advisor Feng, if I knew you were the Vice President of the Advanced Enforcement Union, I would have made sure that guy called Wan Tong wouldn’t have made a sound anymore, instead of coming here so politely,” Mo Fan assured him.

Feng Li, one of the five advisors of the national team!

Mo Fan had been quite surprised. Didn’t Feng Li have an official post in the capital? How did he go from being the advisor of the national team to Vice President of an Advanced Enforcement Union?

“I was the chief instructor of every Enforcement Union in the country. I have trained over a thousand Enforcers! Being an advisor of the national team is only my part-time job!” Feng Li blew his beard out with a straight face, the typical way for a middle-aged man to display their pride.

Mo Fan thought about that.

The World College Tournament only took place once every four years. Advisor Song He was the Dean of the Imperial College, and also part-timed as an advisor for the national team.

With that thought in mind, the other advisors obviously had other jobs as well. Mo Fan just had not expected Advisor Feng Li to be the Vice President of an Advanced Enforcement Union!

“That being said, I was just assigned to be the Vice President here not long ago. I was at the Supreme Enforcement Union in the capital before,” Feng Li went on.

“Is this a demotion or a promotion?” Mo Fan teased him.

“A demotion on the surface, but a promotion behind the scenes. After serving as Vice President for two years, I’ll be taking over the Dongfang Oriental Advanced Enforcement Union as its President,” Feng Li stated proudly.

Mo Fan was shocked by the words.

Just how impressive was Advisor Feng Li? It turned out that the organization had assigned him to be in charge of the Advanced Enforcement Union here!

Even if Mo Fan had crippled the arrogant Enforcer Wan Tong today, he would not have had any trouble!

He was a member of the national team Advisor Feng Li had been in charge of. The relationship between them was like master and disciple. How dare the little Enforcer put on airs in front of him?

“You should watch yourself, too. The Advanced Enforcement Union represents the entire Magic Association. We are in the Oriental Pearl Tower. If it was some other officer here, your actions would be treated as challenging the dignity of the Dongfang Oriental Magic Association!” Feng Li warned him.

“I got it, boss!” Mo Fan nodded quickly.

“Speaking of which, are you improving your cultivation just by eating? At this rate,?even?I won’t stand a chance against you in just a few years!” Despite Feng Li’s complaint, he was actually proud to see that Mo Fan was able to hold an Advanced Enforcer hostage.

Mo Fan used to be his student on the national team. Not only had the team won the championship, Mo Fan had also become a Super Mage!

Wan Tong was not particularly strong as a Super Mage, but the fact that Mo Fan was able to drag him here like a dog was a clear display of Mo Fan’s current strength!

Feng Li had taken the education path to power. He had been the director of a magic high school when he was younger, and climbed his way up to being the instructor to all Enforcement Unions in the country. He was also an advisor of the national team, but he had never seen his job title as his greatest achievement. He was prouder of those students of his who were able to make a name for themselves across the world!

“Boss, how can you say that? I worked very hard to train myself!” Mo Fan said righteously.

The national team had referred to the five strictly impartial and incorruptible advisors as their bosses in secret. Only Mo Fan dared to call them boss in front of them!

“I heard what you did overseas in South America, too. The Head Priest of the Black Vatican...” Feng Li finally could not keep the smile off his face.

The Supreme Enforcement Union in the capital itself had granted Mo Fan permission for his operation overseas. The Advanced Enforcement Union in the Magic City had been unaware of it.

However, Feng Li had been assigned to the Advanced Enforcement Union by the Supreme Enforcement Union. He obviously knew about the operation!

“I’m planning to visit Bo City before handing the Head Priest’s remains over to the Supreme Enforcement Union,” Mo Fan replied calmly.

“Of course,” Feng Li nodded.

Wu Ku!

Red Cardinal Salan had always headed the biggest evil organization in their country, and the Head Priest Wu Ku who Mo Fan had taken down was the highest-ranked member of the Black Vatican that the Enforcement Union had ever eliminated.

On a side note, since the Cold Prince had been handed over to the Holy Judgment Court, the Court instead of China had taken all that glory.

This time, Mo Fan was planning to hand Wu Ku’s remains to the Supreme Enforcement Union in the capital, but only after he was finally able to account for himself to Bo City!

As for the Ancient Capital, he would need Salan’s remains for that!

“Do you have two Elements at the Super Level now?” Feng Li asked.

“I actually have three. Lightning, Fire, and Shadow,” Mo Fan had no reason to lie to Feng Li.

Feng Li took a deep breath.

The young man was even more impressive than he had thought. He already had three Elements at the Super Level!

He was already a cornerstone of the Super Level Mages!

“I’m about to get my fourth Element in the Super Level, too. I have just gotten my hands on a complete Universe Vein,” Mo Fan informed him.

Feng Li had just lifted his cup to take a satisfied sip of tea, but his hand slipped and he almost dropped the cup.

Coughing and exclaiming, “It’s hot!” Feng Li tried to cover his awkwardness, but it was Mo Fan’s words that had scorched him, not the tea!

Four Elements at the Super Level?!,?he thought.

Other Super Mages only had four Elements! According to normal standards, Mo Fan was close to reaching the peak of the Super Level!

How crazy could Mo Fan be?!
