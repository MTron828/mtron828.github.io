“I see them!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

Mo Fan was not in a rush. After all, the restraint from the Lord of Darkness’s rules was still around. He just needed to drag the battle on for a little longer to unleash his full strength.

The Saintess of Darkness had a twisted face. Not only was she showing her strong hatred for Mo Fan, she also bore a strong hatred toward the entire world.

It was not exaggerating to call her a madwoman. It was completely unnecessary for Mo Fan to face her while she was recklessly destroying everything.

The black string attached to Mo Fan finally disappeared.

The Lord of Darkness sneered. He felt sorry for the Saintess of Darkness’ idiocy. He had held a chance to win the match. He could have made a comeback with just his queen and king.

However, the chance o that was even slimmer now, by the looks of it!

“I’m going to cut off the strings first!” Mo Fan was ridiculously fast. He could now Cast Blink four times in one second!

Each Blink would send him around eight hundred meters away. If he had more time to Channel the spells, he could easily have traveled over two kilometers with each Blink.

He zipped around swiftly, like a beam of irregular light.

The Elder of the Shadow Tribe’s aura grew stronger, too. It took the shape of a massive mace behind Mo Fan.

The mace slammed heavily into the red faces in the sky. They shattered into pieces, like masks made out of clay.

The Saintess of Darkness lost a portion of her power every time a face was smashed to pieces. Her body began shrinking, gradually losing the armor, claws, and horns the Evil Faith had granted her.

Mo Fan took his time.

The Saintess of Darkness had completely lost her mind. He could not afford to rush it when fighting an enemy like her.

Mo Fan eventually destroyed all the faces, but the Saintess of Darkness found an opportunity to lunge at Mo Fan. She swung her claws at Mo Fan’s belly.

She was going to pull his intestines out! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lightning Seals suddenly surfaced on Mo Fan’s body, like armor made out of lightning, standing between Mo Fan and the Saintess of Darkness.

The lightning exploded, knocking both Mo Fan and the Saintess of Darkness away and sending them flying.

Mo Fan rose to his feet after dodging the attack. He stared at the Saintess of Darkness coldly.

“Hell is the best place for a lunatic like you, who thinks the whole world is as filthy as yourself!” Lightning and fire appeared simultaneously between Mo Fan’s fingers.

The purple lightning and red fire fell off Mo Fan’s fingers like leaves of two different colors. They triggered a huge explosion as flames forming the feathers of a giant phoenix surged wildly. The lightning coiled into huge pillars, forming the bodies of dragons!

The lightning dragons and fiery phoenix dived forward. The purple lightning and red fire clashed and triggered a mighty explosion!

The explosion turned everything within its radius into ashes. The Saintess of Darkness struggled fiercely as her skin melted away. The bright light lit up her face, which was now looking quite pained.

“Shadow Fiends: Thousand Spears!”

Dark spears emerged from the ground even before the lightning and fire had dissipated. They stabbed the Saintess of Darkness in her soul, torturing her with the worst pain.

The Saintess of Darkness’ body burned into a dried corpse, even as her soul was tortured by the shadowy spears. She gradually turned from an evil monster to a hunchbacked old woman.

Mo Fan did not feel sorry for her.

He Cast another spell of the Chaos Element. It ignored the Saintess of Darkness’ defenses and rent her into two halves.

The Saintess of Darkness did not cry out in pain. She was crawling on the ground like a vengeful spirit.

“Phoenix Flame!”

Mo Fan summoned a huge fireball from the sky and burned the Saintess of Darkness into ashes.

Evil Faith?

That evil magic was even worse than the Black Vatican sorcery that turned humans into Dark Beast Monsters.

The Saintess of Darkness kept claiming she was being used like a pawn. However, she was the one who had invented the Evil Faith.

She had also raised the Cold Prince!

The Evil Faith was not supposed to exist in the world. It was better for the Saintess of Darkness to perish, preventing her from seducing more people into learning the Evil Faith and abusing its power while she was serving her sentence in the Dark Plane!

—

“It’s getting boring.” The Lord of Darkness was clearly unsatisfied with the outcome.

However, the Lord of Darkness had to admit that he did not expect his opponent’s move of having Mo Fan grow strong enough with the Spring of Darkness to take out the Lord of Darkness’ queen.

After all, if Mo Fan had not received the Spring of Darkness, there was no way he could have beaten the Saintess of Darkness!

“Only one more step left!” Mu Bai smiled.

“You have won. You and your friends may leave now,” the Lord of Darkness said.

Su Lu was enraged when he heard the words.

What did he mean?

The battle between him and the Black Dragon Emperor had not even taken place. How could the Lord of Darkness forfeit the match?!

“Are you looking down on me?” Su Lu asked.

“I don’t think you are that stupid to realize you have little chance of beating the Black Dragon Emperor,” the Lord of Darkness said.

“I will dig out its heart, liver, and lungs!” Su Lu swore fervently.

“Then I look forward to your performance.”

—

The Lord of Darkness did not have high hopes for Su Lu.

The Black Dragon Emperor was covered in scorching blood, looking like a black mountain. Its burning blood was flowing down its body like streams of lava. It was almost felt like an erupting black volcano.

Su Lu was the defender, so his strength was reduced by thirty percent.

The Black Tide had dragged a lot of people into the Dark Plane. The spell had consumed a huge portion of Su Lu’s mental strength. He was also severely injured after the Contract between him and the Black Dragon Emperor was forcibly terminated.

The Black Dragon Emperor did not care if Su Lu was ready to use some other strange magic. The Lord of Darkness’ game had given him the perfect opportunity to take his revenge!

Su Lu could no longer escape, nor did he have any backup!

In order to defeat the Black Dragon Emperor, Su Lu had used an evil spell to destroy the Black Dragon Emperor’s throat, preventing him from using his dragon breath.

The flame the Black Dragon Emperor had spat out when he was fighting Mo Fan was only a small fireball he had stored inside his stomach. It was not the real breath of a dragon!

The Black Dragon Emperor lifted his head.

The real dragon breath was burning in his throat. The heat almost broke through the barrier around the tile and burned the others nearby.

The poison in the Black Dragon Emperor’s throat spread rapidly.

However, the Black Dragon Emperor insisted on giving Su Lu a taste of his dragon breath, despite the risk of destroying his throat!
