The Desolate Ice Rifts were a nightmare to all living creatures. The peak of Tianshan Mountain did not welcome anything living. Many powerful species never woke up after falling into the cracks.

The crevasse that Zhao Kang had challenged was only about thirty meters long. Those that were hundreds or thousands of meters long were common in the Desolate Ice Field, and could not be crossed easily!

They were forbidden territory in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. Even the strongest creatures had to cast their pride aside and avoid them!

—

The ice rifts were impassable, meaning that the ice field was as complicated as a maze. Their destination was just ahead, yet they had to go up to a thousand meters around to avoid the rifts. They still had no idea if there would be other crevasses in their way after they avoided the first one.

The Tianshan Sacred Lotus was almost within sight, yet reaching it was harder than anyone had imagined.

A huge blast suddenly echoed in the quiet Desolate Ice Field. Everyone looked in the direction it came from.

There was a hill there fully made up of crystalline ice. The fact that it existed in the Desolate Ice Field indicated it was sturdier than most of the mountains around, but it had suddenly collapsed. Its spectacular body smashed onto the spacious ice field and shattered.

The ice shards scattered across the place, some flying at Mo Fan and the others. Everyone fixed their eyes on the area and saw glowing wings weaving through the fallen hill. They were quick, like rays of light, covering several thousand meters in the blink of an eye.

“It’s them!” Klope exclaimed.

“Are they here for the Tianshan Sacred Lotus too? If so, we are wasting our time here.”

“It doesn’t seem like it. The Tianshan Sacred Lotus is located at the Nine Flowers Scar, but they are fighting in an area with fewer ice rifts. If they are here for the Tianshan Sacred Lotus, they should be heading toward the Nine Flowers Scar,” Yassen observed.

“Who are they? Why are they fighting here, especially with their outstanding cultivation?” Kuma asked.

Mo Fan looked ahead. He already furrowed his brow when he saw the glowing wings. He could not help but curse under his breath when he saw the outfit that one of the figures was wearing.

Son of a b**ch!

Why did he have to stumble into these retarded assh**** after coming to such a distant and deserted place?

“They must be the people who entered the Scar of Tianshan Mountain before us,” Jiang Yu commented.

They had noticed a group of people had entered the Scar of Tianshan Mountain before them after they crossed the frozen lake. It was obvious that the people they were watching were from the same group. They wondered if the group ahead would have any conflicts of interest with the alliance. Hopefully they were after different things, or they were all going to die trying to fight the group of powerful Mages!

“Mo Fan, you know who they are?” Guan Yu asked when he heard Mo Fan’s swear.

“Only those scum of the Heresy Judgment Court would wear outfits like that!” Mo Fan spat.

Mo Fan had met an arrogant Judicator in the Divine City of Lhasa not long ago, giving him a better understanding of the infamous Heresy Judgment Court. He did not expect to see them here so soon!

“Mo Fan,” Mu Ningxue whispered beside Mo Fan’s ear.

“What is it?” Mo Fan asked when he saw the nervous look on her face.

“The person they are fighting...” Mu Ningxue pointed at the icy wall rising across the field in disbelief.

Mo Fan had just noticed the Heresy Judgment Court was surrounding a person, a woman in a long purple robe. To Mo Fan’s surprise, the woman had the same silver hair as Mu Ningxue!

The color was not available as a dye at a hairdresser. Its unique noble temperament and the fair skin that further set off its beauty made her look like a Goddess of Ice had descended upon the mundane world.

Mo Fan had always been dazzled by Mu Ningxue’s unique and natural beauty!

“That woman?” Mo Fan glanced at Mu Ningxue before looking at the woman with silver hair, who was slightly more mature. He almost thought she was Mu Ningxue’s twin sister!

“Qin Yu’er,” Mu Ningxue replied.

Mu Ningxue had shared a fate similar to Qin Yu’er. Mu Ningxue had only realized how fortunate she was after meeting Qin Yu’er. She was utterly impressed by Qin Yu’er’s unyielding spirit.

Mu Ningxue had just told Qin Yu’er’s story to Mo Fan recently. She did not expect to meet Qin Yu’er on Tianshan Mountain, the Ream of Ice, as if they had never left!

However, Mu Ningxue clearly remembered that Qin Yu’er had returned to the city after she left Tianshan Mountain. Why did she come back here? And why was she fighting the Heresy Judgment Court? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“She’s taking on four experts of the Heresy Judgment Court on her own?” Mo Fan was surprised at how strong Qin Yu’er’s Ice Element was. Four Judicators of the Heresy Judgment Court were attacking her, yet they could not secure the upper hand.

“She had already reached the Super Level after leaving the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. She is significantly stronger than me, too. Give her a few more years, and she might even become a Forbidden Mage,” Mu Ningxue explained.

Qin Yu’er had an Innate Soul-grade Seed!

Mu Ningxue’s Innate Spirit-grade Seed had given her a head start among those of her age. Qin Yu’er just had to improve her cultivation to better control her Ice Magic. She was an empress in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain!

“Mo Fan, look over there!” Zhao Manyan suddenly pointed in a direction.

Mo Fan followed Zhao Manyan’s finger and saw a woman dressed like a Muse from the Parthenon Temple, covered in the sacred light of the Blessing Element. She was strengthening the Super Spell of one of the Adjudicators.

“Pelina?” Mo Fan’s eyes widened.

Wasn’t the woman helping the Heresy Judgment Court looking for a heretic? Why was she here?

“Didn’t she say she was going to Tianshan Mountain?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Right... but we set out first,” Mo Fan said slowly.

“Look at her formation, and look at ours,” Zhao Manyan pointed out.

Both sides had Super Mages, but it was obvious that the four Adjudicators and Pelina were experts among Super Mages. They did not require much time to channel their Super Spells. They even had multiple Elements at the Super Level!
