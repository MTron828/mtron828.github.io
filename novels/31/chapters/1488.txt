1491 A Capable Poser

“It’s...it’s over?” Li Ximei was so shocked that her mouth was hanging open.

Professor Li and Professor Zheng finally collected their thoughts. In addition to the joy of witnessing Mo Fan winning the duel, they were also greatly astounded by Mo Fan’s strength.

Those flames were clearly on par with the level of a Super Spell! Even they had to admit that the Pearl Institute was fortunate enough to have the monstrous Mo Fan as their student...

“You’re a madman!” Zhao Manyan immediately raised his thumb after Mo Fan returned. He subconsciously glanced at the old hag, Headmistress Perry.

A moment ago, Headmistress Perry was busy proclaiming how brilliant the students of her school were, but in the end, her brightest student was taught a great lesson by Mo Fan’s fiery dragon. She might still be standing, but she was no longer fit for battle. She was going to lose quickly if Mo Fan kept attacking. There was no point in continuing the duel!

“Oh Mo Fan, didn’t I tell you to preserve your strength? You were up against the Alps Institute and the Casas, you should really have given them some face. Our country has always been respectful. Next time, you should really be mindful of our foreign friends’ dignity, do you understand?” Professor Li said with a big wide smile.

They were finally able to get their revenge!

Professor Li was utterly pleased. He had the urge to ask his granddaughter to hook up with Mo Fan, even if she ended up being his concubine. He had never seen any young man so pleasing to him; he was such a capable poser!

Professor Zheng was not as blatant. He said calmly, “On behalf of the Pearl Institute, I thank you for the generous gifts.”

“It’s only some resources. Us Casas have always been generous with our donations,” Herr Casa responded flatly, his face expressionless.

Even though the amount of resources was nothing for the Casas, he was still giving money away to the Pearl Institute for nothing in return. Any person was going to feel it was a pity. He also had to come up with an excuse to explain this to the elders of the clan. He could not possibly tell them he had given the resources to the Pearl Institute because he lost a bet, right?

“Well... regarding what we agreed on, I’ll have to discuss it with the elders first...” Prince Beny was left in an awkward situation... again!

Prince Beny was different from Herr Casa. Even though he was a prince and Herr Casa was only a duke, their status still greatly differed. Prince Beny was only a public figure representing the royal family of Spain. He did not actually have any real authority, nor did he have any power. He was just acting high and mighty to remind the public that the royal family still existed.

Prince Beny did not really have any real power. How could he possibly convince the Royal Naval Academy to agree to the Pearl Institute’s request?

The young duke, Herr Casa, was different. His talents meant he would be an important pillar of the clan in the future. He did indeed have great authority, in addition to the outstanding status of the Casas in Europe. In fact, the renowned clan’s reputation clearly exceeded that of Spain’s royal family. As a result, Prince Beny was more like Herr Casa’s subordinate!

“Little Benny, you shouldn’t boast so much if you can’t fulfill your own promise. You should learn from me. I’m a man of my word, and I usually go above and beyond,” Mo Fan said with a smile.

Prince Beny hated Mo Fan’s guts. He was on the verge of losing his temper when he heard Mo Fan’s words.

Unfortunately, he could not change the fact that he had lost the bet miserably. He looked at Headmistress Perry and grunted in displeasure, “Headmistress Perry, you should have sent your best student instead!”

Miss Ceylan was treating Heidi’s injuries at the side. Heidi’s eyes flickered angrily when she heard his words.

Heidi also had a formidable background. If she was not currently a student of the Alps Institute, she would not have to go easy on Prince Beny or Herr Casa!

“Heidi, mind yourself,” Miss Ceylan glanced at Heidi.

“Yes, teacher.” Heidi immediately withdrew her Will.

“Losing isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially for you,” Ceylan said seriously.

Ceylan was not surprised by the outcome at all. She already knew Mo Fan had not used his full strength during the fight at the waterfall. She was looking forward to seeing the duel between the two young talents, but she did not expect it would end so quickly!

“Teacher, I can beat him!” Heidi declared.

“Yes, you can beat him, but that’s not really you. A Dimensional Mage who can’t even control her heart is no different than a demon creature killing recklessly,” Ceylan replied.

Heidi fell silent.

“You have incredible talents and great potential that easily outmatch anyone, including me. I didn’t ask you to train at the Alps Institute because I wanted you to prove that you are better than anyone. You must first learn to defeat yourself first. Dimensional Magic has no limit to its power, but without a firm heart, you will stay a weakling,” Ceylan stated.

“Miss Ceylan, when will I be able to face everything calmly like you?” Heidi asked ruefully.

Ceylan was always a strict but patient teacher. Heidi had learned a lot from her.

Ceylan was a little lost in her thoughts after hearing the question, as if reminded of something sad. She answered with a wry smile, “I was actually more ruthless than you in the past.”

“Teacher, what happened to the student that secretly asked you for advice?” Heidi asked. She knew her teacher had recalled something after seeing her reaction. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ceylan shook her head. She did not want to share what was on her mind. She instead told Heidi, “I think it’s time for you to train yourself in the outside world.”

—

The Casas who were planning to show off their strength through the duel felt uneasy the whole day. Herr Casa briefly went on a tour around the Alps Institute before leaving with his men to take a rest.

Headmistress Perry was extremely displeased by events. How could she possibly discuss important business with Herr Casa if he was in such a bad mood?

Headmistress Perry had the urge to drive Mo Fan out of the school. Never had any student given her such a huge headache. She wondered what the Dean was thinking, inviting the Pearl Institute over at this time. The Dean had done nothing but bring her trouble!
