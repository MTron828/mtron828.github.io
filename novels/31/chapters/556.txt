The sound of rapid galloping came from the gap, sounding like it was approaching from a great distance...

The next second, Mo Fan who was still recovering from the blow, saw a great black horse leaping out from the lunar-white gap. Its body was covered in dense black hair, with a black mist floating around it.

The horse had a single horn, which was also black in color, emitting a flicker of black lightning.

A figure wearing black armor was sitting on the back of the horse. It looked similar to a human, yet the heavy, European-style armor was completely empty inside!

“What the hell is this?” asked the astonished Mo Fan.

He was also a Summoner, yet his Dimensional Summoning was only able to Summon a wolf-type creature. It was quite impressive that he had managed to level up his beast to his current stage. To Mo Fan’s surprise, the girl’s Dimensional Summoning had Summoned an even rarer creature.

A Dark Knight?

The figure indeed resembled a warrior sitting on an elegant black horse, holding a half-crescent scimitar in his hand. However, for some reason, the raindrops were evaporated instantly when they landed on it.

“Dark Knight!”

Meng’e immediately ordered the imperious Dark Knight to deal with the Giant Corpse General.

Mo Fan did not summon the Swift Star Wolf, as his Summoned Creature was no match for the Giant Corpse General. It was likely that the creature would die in the fight, but the Dark Knight whom Meng’e had Summoned looked fairly promising. But since Dimensional Summoning was only a Basic Spell, there would be a limit to the Summoned Creature’s strength.

It was possible that the woman was only trying to buy them some time!

Mo Fan could still feel his blood rumbling inside his body. The Black Snake Magic Armor had negated most of the damage, yet the same principle applied; the Magician still had to endure the force from the hit.

Mo Fan, who was unable to move for the time being was watching Meng’e from afar, hoping that she could hold on until he recovered.

The horse uttered a shriek and raised its front limbs as the knight signaled from atop the saddle.

The stomp sent the muddy water splattering. However, the horse had already turned into a black arrow dashing forward with a wild gust of wind at the Giant Corpse General before the droplets even landed.

The knight on the horse held the scimitar with a reverse grip and leaned forward...

Meanwhile, the Giant Corpse General raised its four arms, waiting for the unique Darkness Creature to present itself!

The knight and the horse almost became one, sweeping through the rain like a black arrow.

The Giant Corpse General was just about to fling its arms down, but the Dark Knight was already behind it...

The scimitar was drawn out from its sheath, leaving a long slash in the rain. The Giant Corpse General had yet to realize that its body was already left with a giant hole. Its sturdy body shuddered for a second, before blood and water poured out from it!

Mo Fan took a deep breath.

Wasn’t this Dark Knight a bit too quick? It simply finished the attack within the blink of an eye!

The Swift Star Wolf was well-known for his speed, yet he was still a few levels lower than the Dark Knight. The Giant Corpse General was already left with a great hole before it managed to bring its arms down!

The Dark Knight did not stop and remain in his cool posture, quickly turning the horse around after finishing his blow. He utilized the momentum of the spin to execute a slash to the General’s back!

The black half-crescent sword slashed forward, the view even more stunning in the rain.

The sharp edge landed on one of the Giant Corpse General’s limbs. Its limb, with flesh as hard as rock, was cleanly amputated after making contact with the blade.

As the Giant Corpse General’s arm fell to the ground, the filthy creature uttered a seemingly pained or furious cry. It raised its other three limbs and charged at the Dark Knight.

The Dark Knight was incredibly fast with his sword. Despite facing the sequence of wild attacks from the three arms, it looked like he was drawing a web with the movements of his sword, completely nullifying the attacks from the Giant Corpse General.

Mo Fan was left speechless. Isn’t this Dark Knight somehow too powerful? Not only did he inflict serious damage to the Giant Corpse General with only two attacks, he could defend himself against the filthy creature’s attacks!

“Try to recover quickly, my cultivation isn’t strong enough. I can only Summon him for a limited time,” Meng’e reminded Mo Fan.

Mo Fan felt better after hearing the words.

Meng’e had obviously cast a Basic Summoning Spell, yet if a Basic Spell alone could summon such a powerful Darkness Creature, she would not be afraid of the Giant Corpse General.

As he thought, an exceedingly strong Summoned Creature would have limitations. Not only was the Dark Knight able to fight fearlessly against the Giant Corpse General, he had the upper hand in the battle, too! It implied that the Dark Knight was one of the strongest species in the Summoning Dimension, and usually, it was fairly difficult to control such creatures!

“<Sword Burst Ultimate!>” the Dark Knight uttered in English. Mo Fan did not understand him, but he could easily tell that the knight was speaking in the human tongue! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A few rounds later, the Dark Knight moved nimbly and secured the perfect chance for a counterattack. He struck at lightning speed and immediately pulled back...

A few moments later, the arm where the hit landed suddenly burst apart with the formidable energy of darkness. The energy exploded and blasted another limb of the Giant Corpse General to pieces!

The Dark Knight had amputated another arm of the Giant Corpse General!

The Giant Corpse General was now covered in wounds. As Mo Fan was hoping the Dark Knight could simply finish the Giant Corpse General off, the knight suddenly sheathed his sword and galloped off into the distance!

His figure slowly merged with the darkness in the rain. Even though he was fairly close, it looked like he had gone into a different dimension, slowly vanishing into thin air...

If it weren’t for the blood, amputated limbs and sword marks around him, it felt like the Dark Knight had not even appeared. He had simply come and gone in a mysterious way!

The time was too short!

The Dark Knight was powerful, yet the duration he could stay was less than a tenth of the Swift Star Wolf!

“It’s seriously injured. Don’t give it any chance to come close to us,” said Meng’e.

“My turn!” Mo Fan decisively drew another Lightning Star Pattern.

“Thunderbolt!”

Stormy clouds appeared above. Mo Fan, who had managed to catch his breath, immediately unleashed the full strength of the Thunderbolt: Wild Strikes.

The power of the lightning was more than enough to inflict damage to the Giant Corpse General, and slammed its enormous body to the ground, leaving the creature covered in blood and holes trembling in fear!
