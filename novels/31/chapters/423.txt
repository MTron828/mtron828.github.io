The teachers opened their eyes wide. Bai Mei said, “He has three Elements to cultivate. His Fire and Lightning Elements are quite impressive. If his Summoning Element has also achieved the Intermediate Level, isn’t his cultivation rate a bit too terrifying?”

The teachers let out relieved sighs when they discovered that Mo Fan was not casting the Intermediate Summoning Spell.

They were almost scared to death by this guy. It was a relief that he did not have a Contracted Beast.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan’s Summoning Element had already reached the Intermediate Level. He could also cast the Spell adeptly. The problem was, he did not have enough money to buy a suitable Contracted Beast.

Among the Contracted Beasts he had seen, those that could match the Swift Star Wolf’s strength after they matured were forty million RMB or above. It was rather meaningless to buy a Contracted Beast that was weaker than the Swift Star Wolf.

Zhao Ji was soaked in cold sweat on the dueling ground.

When he discovered that Mo Fan did not have a Contracted Beast, he could not help but chuckle. Everyone already knew about the duels, and if he ended up defeating the demon king, it would be a great boost to his reputation. His clan would take him seriously from now on!

Zhao Ji knew that Mo Fan was running out of energy. He did not give him any chance to catch his breath. The Intermediate Fire Spell was already burning on his right fist.

Meanwhile, his figure was surrounded by glowing shields. The golden glow formed a full circle of protection around him, shielding him inside perfectly.

Despite the power of Mo Fan’s Basic Spells, he was unable to blast Zhao Ji’s Light Element shields away. Zhao Ji was using a Spirit-grade Light Element Soul Seed, granting him a sturdier defense.

Mo Fan hated fighting against Magicians with Fire and Earth Elements. Similarly, Mo Fan was not a fan of the Light Element either, as it perfectly countered his Shadow Element.

“Qianjun: Thunderbolt: Yaksha!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan cast an Intermediate Spell without hesitation. His finger swiped across the night sky, summoning a purple-black storm cloud above Zhao Ji. Following the flicker on his fingertip, a wide thunderbolt plummeted toward the ground.

In the midst of striking down, it forked into several lightning arcs, like a black claw tearing the air apart. The place began to tremble before the formidable power.

The power of Thunderbolt: Yaksha was fairly shocking. It was pretty much Mo Fan’s strongest attack besides the Fiery Fist: Nine Halls. However, it felt like the cunning Zhao Ji was baiting Mo Fan to cast an Intermediate Spell. When he saw the Thunderbolt, he quickly extinguished the fire on his right fist and cast a Light Element Spell.

“Light Protection: Rampart!”

Several golden rays intertwined above Zhao Ji, forming a floating golden wall.

The Thunderbolt struck the glowing wall. However, it felt like its power was being absorbed. The destructive Spell was quickly nullified without causing much destruction.

The purple-black lightning arcs broke down rapidly on the Light Protection: Rampart, soon disappearing from the surface of the wall.

“Trying to defeat me in one blow? How much energy do you have left to fight against me?” Zhao Ji asked with a sinister grin.

Mo Fan was not bothered by Zhao Ji’s provocation. He stood on the spot, like a lamp that was running out of fuel.

“It’s time for you to pay the price,” Zhao Ji’s right fist was engulfed in flames once again.

The flames that were spreading in all directions quickly gathered on his wrist, a strong energy bursting out from it.

“Fiery Fist: Groundbreak!” Zhao Ji also had a Spirit-grade flame. The power of his Fiery Fist: Groundbreak was comparable to Li Yujie’s.

The blazing red flames lit up the entire stage. Mo Fan was forced to use his Departing Nether Shield. He quickly backed off, trying to avoid the region with the strongest power.

The Departing Nether Shield had blocked most of the power, but the scorching flames managed to penetrate it, burning Mo Fan’s favorite shirt into ashes, and revealing his scorched chest.

The flames covered Mo Fan’s figure. If it weren’t for his fire resistance, his body would most likely be beyond recognition after the burning.

The Departing Nether Shield had blocked the tremendous force that could burn him into ashes, yet the lingering burning effect still applied.

Mo Fan was injured. He clenched his teeth in pain as he was burned. A few parts of his body were obviously scorched.

Zhao Ji wore a smile when he saw the damage he had inflicted on his opponent. His victory was just around the corner.

His Light Protection: Rampart had already disappeared. Basically, he only needed to throw his fist at Mo Fan to end the battle.

The scorching flames continued to burn on the stage. Mo Fan stood in the midst of the fire, holding his Departing Nether Shield. The light of the fire revealed a strange grin on his face.

Suddenly, a long spike thrust forward from the Departing Nether Shield!

It was the counterattack of the Departing Nether Shield, the Departing Nether Spike!

It penetrated the scorching flames and appeared in front of Zhao Ji within the blink of an eye.

The Departing Nether Spike was like a cold sword piercing through the night sky. It swept across the burning zone of fire. Zhao Ji had no idea it existed until the icy spike that could penetrate everything was already coming toward him.

“Rock Barrier!” Wei Rong reacted fairly quickly and cast an Earth Spell.

No one had seen him drawing the Stars. A Rock Barrier suddenly emerged in front of Zhao Ji.

The Departing Nether Spike penetrated the Rock Barrier. Its tip was inches away from Zhao Ji’s face.

Zhao Ji broke out in cold sweat, his body froze in place. He stared at the Rock Barrier in front of him in disbelief, before glancing at the Departing Nether Spike that had almost taken his life.

“Zhao Ji, you’re already dead if you’re fighting against a demon beast. You’ve lost the fight,” Wei Rong harrumphed coldly.

Zhao Ji totally lost his mind. He never thought Mo Fan, who had already used up all his energy would lunge back at him like a poisonous scorpion’s last struggle. He had lost the important duel just because he had lowered his guard too early.

He raised his head, and saw the burns on Mo Fan’s body. He gathered his remaining dignity after suffering the loss, and sneered, “Injuring you is more than enough!”
