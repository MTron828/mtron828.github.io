The sea monsters finally jumped out of the water after they were exposed, springing twenty meters into the air. Their skinny figures were similar to humans, but their heads and bodies were made up of twisted bones.

Their backs had a bone sack that resembled a box. People could easily mistake them for backpackers in the heavy rain!

“Viscera Hunters!” Lingling recognized the unusual species right away.

Mo Fan had heard of the species too. He remembered these Viscera Hunters had been ambushing and killing Mages when Fanxue City was first established. They were even more brutal and cunning than the Scarlet Soaring Demons! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

These Viscera Hunters mainly resided in ravines along the ocean floor, but they were active on islands and peninsulas, and along the coastlines too. They had been spotted by almost every country connected to the sea. They were infamous for their savage nature!

“Why do I feel like these creatures are formed from the bones of the dead fish in the ocean?” Mo Fan wondered aloud, observing the Viscera Hunters calmly.

The Viscera Hunters were completely exposed above the water, and able to stand on their feet. Some had landed on the houses that were still standing in the area, but many were standing on the lake. They were able to stand on water!

“They are a mixed species of sea monsters and phantoms. You can think of them as sea ghosts. They don’t have any particular obsession, nor do they need to eat. They just like killing and collecting the organs of living creatures and humans,” Lingling explained with a disgusted face.

Some species of demon creatures were absolutely detestable. Lingling had found a book and read the author’s account of how he had escaped from the Viscera Hunters. The author had witnessed how the Viscera Hunters tortured their prey by removing their organs while they were still alive.

People were naturally afraid of a lot of powerful species in the sea. The Viscera Hunters were not necessarily a strong species, yet no Hunter or Mage wanted to stumble into them. These creatures would drag them to deep waters and dissect them if they were at all careless!

“Viscera Hunters, huh?” Mo Fan let out a hollow laugh.

Mo Fan had heard of incidents where members of Fanxue Mountain were ambushed by the Viscera Hunters. Shao Yu had conveyed her hatred of these creatures, and Mu Ningxue had also told him the detestable acts of these creatures on several occasions.

Mo Fan finally had the chance to stumble into so many Viscera Hunters today. He could not help but crack his knuckles. As a righteous young man with a strong sense of justice, he felt obliged to remove this abhorrent species from God’s list of creation!

People had long loathed these Viscera Hunters.

In addition to Shen Qing, Zhang Xin, and Zhang Lulin, the Intermediate Mages who had fought the Scarlet Rending Demon previously had also come to Wuyuan Bay. They too were brave and had a strong sense of responsibility. They had volunteered to lend a hand when they heard Wuyuan Bay might become an entry point for the sea monsters.

However, their expressions shifted when they saw the Viscera Hunters. Even the Mages who rarely went out to sea had heard of the Viscera Hunters’ brutal methods of killing humans. They could not help but shiver at the thought despite the anger that was rising in them.

More than a hundred Viscera Hunters had jumped out of the water. How could they possibly gather their courage to fight these creatures when they struggled to take out just a single Viscera Hunter?

“We...we should ask for backup instead!” Zhang Xin’s legs were already trembling.

His organs were clearly not enough for these Viscera Hunters to split evenly among themselves!

“They can smell our fear. The uneasier we are, the more excited they would be. Our fear will make them stronger too,” Lingling said.

Many cursed, undead, and darkness creatures were able to feed on the hatred, fear, and anger from other living creatures. These negative emotions were like fresh oxygen to them. The Viscera Hunters were an undead species. They liked to kill their prey brutally since it would inflict fear on their prey, which would make them stronger in return!

It was similar to the mummies in the Pyramids, who nurtured themselves with hatred!

Fear would only provide the Viscera Hunters with more power, especially when the Intermediate Mages were subconsciously backing away. The scent of their cowardice was producing a fresh meal for the Viscera Hunters. Their white bones started to gain a dark red glow as they turned as sturdy and sharp as metal!

The Viscera Hunters acted like they had a weird fetish when they could easily pounce on the Mages. They remained still despite the strong fragrance of the Mages’ flesh. They stared at the humans and constantly absorbed their emotions, like gourmets who were admiring delicacies. They would first appraise the appearance of the dishes before eating them.

Suddenly, a disgusting aroma from one of the dishes completely ruined the mood of the gourmets. The creatures realized the pungent smell was coming from a young man.

His Aura was outstanding among the humans, yet he was scorning the fear the creatures were inflicting on the other humans!

A bad apple would spoil the whole barrel. The Viscera Hunters glared at Mo Fan, utterly disgusted by his Aura. They were eager to take him out first or make him afraid, which might make his flesh taste the best among the humans!

“Isn’t it annoying?” Mo Fan could feel the anger of the Viscera Hunters from their twisted expressions. “That’s right, it’s only the entree, it’ll soon be so bad that you’re going to regret being born in this world!”

Mo Fan did not give the Viscera Hunters any chance to put on airs. Since his lightning had provoked them to show themselves, he would use lightning to eliminate them during the storm now!

“Electro Cannon!”

Mo Fan used one of his strongest attacks right away. Lightning began to coil around his arms. The storm already made the presence of the Lightning Magic strong. Mo Fan merely turned himself into a magnet absorbing the Lightning Magic. He was rapidly charging his arms with lightning!
