Throughout this long Drifting Sand River dwelled horrifying creatures called the White Sand Demon. Looking ahead while standing on the edge of the Gobi Desert was a descending dry slope.

Although they called it a river, it seemed more like an ocean in everyone’s eyes as it followed the descending continental shelf. This sand was covered in very thin and winding white sand silt. The sizes of these silt dunes looked like waves within a white ocean.

“Didn’t they say that this place had White Sand Demons dwelling around? Why haven’t I seen a single one of them?” Zhang Xiaohou used his hand to shade his eyes as he surveyed the area from an elevated position.

Everyone also had some doubts in their hearts. At this moment, they could still see the white silt a couple of kilometers away from them. There was nothing moving within the silt. Other than the occasional layer of white waves being blown by the wind, there was nothing else moving.

At this moment, Lingling finished extracting the internal organs of the Sand Howl Tiger. She gave them to Zhang Xiaohou, who was standing next to her, and said, “Here, throw this into the distance.”

Zhang Xiaohou gathered his strength and threw the innards far into the river of dust and sand. After they landed, waves of silt suddenly exploded forth within the tranquil white scene.

Several three meter tall giant-like creatures stood up while supporting themselves with broadswords made from sand. They all began to surround the smelly, bloody organs. After they cautiously examined them, they all turned back into sand that sprinkled all over the Drifting Sand River. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The entire process took just a couple of seconds. The serene ground with white sand had suddenly turned into over forty white giants with broadswords, who then returned back to the sands and restored the peaceful scene. This shocked everyone.

“There were quite a number of creatures appearing from just such a small disturbance. If a whole group of us were to go there, wouldn’t there be a whole White Sand Demon squad appearing?” Zhang Xiaohou asked, his shock totally visible.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan nodded their heads after nearly peeing themselves from surprise.

Fortunately, they didn’t step right in. Who would’ve expected so many White Sand Demons to explode forth in front of them?

“Let’s set a camp by the riverside and rest. It’s about to become dark, it won’t be too late if we were to set out first thing tomorrow,” Lingling advised.

No one was better at setting up the camp than Zhang Xiaohou.

It was as though this guy was on steroid. He would have leftover energy every single day, and it seemed like he was familiar with doing everything.

While everyone was resting, Zhang Xiaohou had already finished setting up the tent for everyone. There were two tents in total, and separated by gender.

Mo Fan walked up to the Swift Star Wolf. He used his hand to comb the fur on the Swift Star Wolf’s neck while he asked Xinxia, who was sitting on top of the Wolf, “Are you tired?”

Xinxia shook her head. Just when she was about to open her mouth, the Swift Star Wolf raised his head in annoyance, as if he was saying that should’ve been a question asked of him!

Mo Fan couldn’t help but smile as he patted the Swift Star Wolf’s head.

The Swift Star Wolf was doing lots of labor. Not only did he carry Xinxia, he also had to carry the little undeveloped loli, Lingling. Lingling was petite, while Xinxia’s physique was very slim. The two girls together were probably not as heavy as Mo Fan. What the Swift Star Wolf found was very annoying was that he could not fight in the same way as he usually did.

“Those White Sand Demon looks like they only want to protect their own territory. Their characteristics are not as vicious as the Sand Roaring Tiger, I should be able to appease them,” Xinxia said with a smile on her face.

Seeing the beads of sweat on her forehead, Mo Fan still took pity on her. However, he was able to tell that she was very happy. She had come to a place that she had never been to before, and it was also her first time being able to fight with Mo Fan shoulder-to-shoulder.

The curtain of the night descended quickly.

The temperature difference between day and night in Gobi Desert was extremely big. As the last little bit of heat retreated from this white ground, a hint of cold silently assaulted them.

The three girls were already sleeping inside the tent. The three guys were alternating the duty of night watch.

Mo Fan was in charge of the latter period of the night. When he woke up, he immediately felt as though he was in a different world. This kind of cold, along with the unrestrained vicious wind striking his body, felt like a blade was cutting right through his skin.

Mo Fan lit up a ball of fire, and then casually threw it onto the ground to form a small bonfire.

He was bored as he repeatedly extinguished the fire and reignited it, and this continued for about an hour. Suddenly, Mo Fan heard something moving in the distance.

Although he had excellent night vision, the sky was still filled with white dust. This lowered visibility by a lot.

Mo Fan woke Zhang Xiaohou up and had him guard the tents. He started toward the area the sounds came from.

The noises in the distance sounded like footsteps. They came one after another; who knew how many creatures were currently walking through the Gobi Desert.

Mo Fan arrived at a stone wall. He didn’t go through it, instead looking through the small cracks in the stone. Fortunately, his field of view to the front was not blocked by the white dust. He could clearly see a small group of Sand Roaring Tigers moving beneath the moonlight.

Their roars were ear-splitting. As their feet hit the ground, the ground trembled constantly.

As he looked further along, he saw a group of Hunter Magicians running for their lives, clearly extremely frightened.

There was a total of about six or seven Sand Roaring Tigers. If such a group appeared, they would also force Mo Fan’s squad to scatter and run.

Mo Fan was able to clearly identify two of the people in the Hunter Magician squad. It was the mean girl with tanned skin and the leader with the black beard.

They already lost their path in their panic, their escape route bringing them toward the Drifting Sand River.

Not too long after, they finally hit the white silt of the Drifting Sand River. They did not stop at all as they ran four to five hundred meters deep into the area.

At the same time, the Sand Roaring Tigers that pursued them suddenly halted by the river’s edge, all standing at a place at the very edge. Even though it looked like they really wanted to wolf down those human Magicians, they did not dare to take even a single step forward.

They were all staring restlessly. They were filled with regret and anger, feeling like ducks had escaped from their mouths.

Just when Mo Fan was puzzled over why those Sand Howl Tigers, known to be so vicious in nature, had suddenly stopped pursuing them, a terrifying scene appeared in the Drifting Sand River, shocking him yet again.

He saw rows of White Sand Demons rising from the white sands. The sand in their hands had turned into large broadswords as they chopped down on the group of Hunter Magicians...

The Hunters let out wild screams before the skies were instantly filled with blood!
