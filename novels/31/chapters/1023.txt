A black sword, Mo Fan somehow felt the sword’s size was just as huge as the sky and the ground. It was meaningless no matter where he tried to run to.

He did not dare to waste even a second. He immediately summoned the Black Snake Armor.

The Black Snake Armor quickly attached itself to Mo Fan’s body, but the overwhelming force of darkness showed no sign of weakening even though the armor was serving as an extra layer of protection. Mo Fan still felt a great chill, as his body began to tremble.

It was Mo Fan’s first time facing a Ruler-level creature apart from the Black Totem Snake. Even though the Dark Swordmaster was a lot weaker than the Black Totem Snake, it was barely inferior to a Ruler-level creature. Any Commander-level creature was no match against its unstoppable sword of darkness.

The sound of the sword was like wild thunder. As the sword swung forward, Mo Fan could see a black wave with the size of a tsunami that could erase a whole city coming at him!

Any defense was utterly useless in front of the force.

The black sword wave landed on Mo Fan and swept him flying like dust. The dark energy covered Mo Fan’s entire body, his skin withering as sword cuts sliced his body!

Mo Fan felt great pain. His body was swaying wildly in the tsunami of sword wave. He was unable to stabilize himself.

Some time later, Mo Fan landed on the ground hard. The Black Snake Armor on him had broken, revealing the wounds under it.

Mo Fan rose to his feet while clenching his teeth. He glanced at the destroyed Black Snake Armor. There was a different look in his eyes.

——

“Mo Fan!”

Outside the dark dueling ground, Xinxia’s eyes reddened immediately when she saw Mo Fan being tossed around in the sword wave.

She could not endure seeing Mo Fan being harmed. When the thought of him dying in the dark dueling ground crossed her mind, she had trouble controlling her temper.

“Mo Fan, hurry up and think of a plan, you’re going to be killed soon!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

The sword was simply way too powerful. Mo Fan’s defense had crumbled almost instantly, leaving him totally defenseless. He was surely going to die to the Dark Swordmaster’s next attack!

“I overestimated him. I thought he could at least last for five rounds,” Zu Jiming laughed hollowly. For some reason, he was gloating over it, as he believed Mo Fan dying here would actually save him lots of trouble.

Ai Jiangtu remained silent. He glanced at the pyramid.

As Mo Fan mentioned, once the Dark Swordmaster was challenged to a duel, it completely ignored everything else that was happening around it. It was definitely their best chance of making it to the pyramid. Ai Jiangtu did not stay any longer, he picked a different direction and started approaching the pyramid.

“He won’t survive the next attack.”

“(sigh) It doesn’t make any difference, even with the Dark Contract. The duel won’t even last long enough. The Dark Swordmaster is going to kill us all.”

Fenna stood outside the dark dueling ground and stared at the fearless young Mage with mixed feelings.

It was meant to be her duel, yet a student Mage had to replace her...

—

Inside the dark dueling ground, Mo Fan stood upright, his armor had basically turned into broken junk, and his clothes were torn with holes.

The Dark Swordmaster stood a hundred meters away. It was proud as usual, its eyes displaying utter disdain toward Mo Fan.

Why would such a weak human think he could come and challenge it?

An opponent like him, it would just toss his corpse away after killing him, as his head was not even worthy to be included in its collection!

The brown Calamity Fire erupted under Mo Fan’s feet out of nowhere, spreading across the area and forming a ring of flames with Mo Fan at the center.

An illusionary teenage girl made of flames slowly appeared within the fires. Her body was combined with lava, fire, and the Rose Flame. Her eyes were burning in rage, as if she would turn into a scorching sun and slam into the undead that had injured Mo Fan at any second.

Teenage Flame Belle unleashed her flames to cover the whole dark dueling ground. With a screeching cry, a stronger flame resembling the Calamity Fire of nature surged forward and collided with the Dark Swordmaster’s aura.

Flames spread wildly and rolled fiercely. The Domain of Calamity Fire unleashed by Teenage Flame Belle surprisingly overwhelmed the Dark Swordmaster’s aura, and suddenly its disdain was gone, replaced with alertness!

“Is it working already? That’s faster than I thought,” Mo Fan grinned, looking at Little Flame Belle before him.

Before starting the duel, Mo Fan had fed Little Flame Belle the remaining Time Liquid he had.

Mo Fan had actually considered demonizing right away, since the number of undead in the pyramid was probably enough to replenish his energy. However, he decided against it when he recalled that the World Magic Association would surely be startled by his Demon Element. He did not want to be taken away to be experimented on like a white mouse, nor did he want to expose his Demon Element to the world, since he was still not strong enough without relying on it.

The best option was to let Little Flame Belle... oh, no, it should be the Flame Belle Empress!

The Time Liquid had temporarily allowed Little Flame Belle to enter her mature phase. With the Flame Belle Empress, he should be able to take on the Dark Swordmaster!

The burning Calamity Fire forced the Dark Swordmaster to back away. The Mages outside the dueling ground that were fighting with the army of undead were dumbfounded.

“Such powerful flames!” Fenna and Sherlock exclaimed simultaneously.

The flames were basically a strong Domain, so strong that it had suppressed the Dark Swordmaster’s aura.

“This...this...right, the Flame Belle Empress!”

“It’s the Flame Belle Empress!” Zhao Manyan, Jiang Yu, and the others shouted in joy.

Her hair reaching her ankles and burning as it was drifting with the wind... she was utterly breathtaking to look at. Her slender silhouette was like a goddess from a painting, surrounded by flames like an army of soldiers that further setting off her sacred demeanor. Those watching subconsciously felt the urge to submit to her while being dazzled by her beauty.

—

In the Calamity Fire, Teenage Flame Belle had completely evolved into Flame Belle Empress. Every movement fully displayed her nobility, and even the darkness structure that was proud of its heritage was ashamed of itself!

“I will not forgive you!” Flame Belle Empress spoke in the language of spirits. Her eyes did not have their usual naive look, but imperious, raging fury!

She was speaking to the Dark Swordmaster, who understood her perfectly. It glanced at Flame Belle Empress, before looking at Mo Fan again. It said with the same voice of disdain it had directed at Mo Fan, “As a Ruler of Flame, how are you satisfied with submitting to the will of such a weak, useless human? If you want, I can recommend you to my master. He possesses great power that you have never seen before. He is the ruler of darkness, and he will help you conquer the Capital of Flames!”

Flame Belle Empress was even more infuriated after hearing the words!

The blood lineage of demon creatures mattered a lot. Only those with strong blood lineages were respected by the others. Both Commander-level and Ruler-level creatures had a certain level of intelligence. They actually treated the human race as a bunch of rats that were impossible to wipe out, as they were able to reproduce so quickly.

That being said, even with the level of intelligence that Flame Belle Empress had acquired after evolving, she would not allow a filthy undead to humiliate the master she was contracted to!

Knowing that it was unnecessary to waste her time talking to an undead whose head was filled only with the lust for blood, Flame Belle Empress turned to Mo Fan and surprisingly charged at him with the fiery tornado encapsulating her figure.

Flame Belle Empress was able to eliminate the undead by herself, but after hearing its scornful remarks, Flame Belle Empress decided to possess Mo Fan instead, and teach the Dark Swordmaster how it would feel when it was defeated by a human it was looking down on!

As Flame Belle Empress charged into Mo Fan’s chest, he suddenly erupted into huge flames. The dueling ground laid out by the Dark Contract was shaking to contain them!

Clenching his fists, the air was immediately flowing with Fire Magic in the form of fairies. They were like soldiers on standby, waiting for their orders. The control he acquired felt the same as he the unlimited power he had when he was in his Demon Form!

Mo Fan raised his head slightly. The Soul Shadow of Flame Belle Empress was behind him, blazing red. Mo Fan was less than two meters tall, but he suddenly looked like a giant engulfed in flames. He no longer looked petty and tiny in front of the Dark Swordmaster!

—

“Oh my, Mo Fan’s strength is off the charts after merging with Flame Belle Empress!” Zhao Manyan totally lost his mind when he saw the Calamity Fire surging across the place.

They almost forgot that Mo Fan was able to summon the Flame Belle Empress with the Time Liquid.

In Peru, when they were dealing with the Strange Birds of Nazca, the Flame Belle Empress had driven back an entire horde of the demon birds on her own. Now, with the Flame Belle Empress possessing Mo Fan, he would surely be able to obtain her power!

—

Inside the dark dueling ground, the human who was awaiting his death had suddenly turned into a wild beast of flames. The fires surging all over the place greatly astounded the watching Mages.

“That...that Mage...”

“A possessing-type Elemental Creature... and it’s a fiery creature with a Ruler-level bloodline!” Fenna felt tears bursting out as she was watching Mo Fan.

It was divine intervention!

God had heard their prayer!

He had sent the Chinese national team here, just so the young Mage with such a remarkable strength was able to light up the flames of hope in the hopeless sea of undead, letting everyone see that the victory they so desired was right in front of them!

“All soldiers, kill the Brutal Sword Death Servants with me at once!” Fenna vented out all the rage in her chest with a roar.

Without the Dark Swordmaster’s help, the Brutal Sword Death Servants were nowhere enough to stop their drive to victory!
