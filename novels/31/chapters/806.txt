Sea monsters!

Their skin was darker than the usual azure blue. They were standing on the street around a hundred meters away. One of the sea monsters had sharp gills like fans under its head that were higher than the roof nearby. They had descended upon the residential area like demons, staring down at the minuscule humans like livestock waiting to be butchered!

“Holy shit, right in the middle of the day...”

“I’m really impressed by the public order of Japan’s town. One, two, there are two of them, both over ten meters tall!”

“What kind of a shitty fortress is this? The sea monsters are able to break into the place just like that!” cursed Zhao Manyan.

While the team was dazzled by the scene before them, an announcement in English suddenly echoed in the air!

“All personnel, sea monsters have appeared in the nineteenth street. Those who are non-combatants should leave or hide in the shelters at once!

“All personnel, sea monsters have appeared in the nineteenth street. It has been confirmed that the sea monsters are two Commander-level Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts. Combatants are advised to eliminate them as soon as possible!”

The announcement repeated for a long time. Everyone was able to hear it clearly.

The crowd on the street was still in good order at the start of the incident. However, when the announcement mentioned the Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts, they began to flee in panic.

“The monsters are Commander-level! Run, run for your lives!”

“This way, the shelter is this way!” The man with orange hair seemed to be an enthusiast. He quickly pointed the direction to safety for those fleeing for their lives.

“Two Commander-level sea monsters have already shown up before the tide has risen. People might die if the Advanced Magicians do not make it in time!” A Wind Magician stayed back, knowing he could outrun the creatures with his speed. He was curious enough to take a closer look at the two Commander-level sea monsters.

“What are you doing here, hurry up to the shelter... hey, hey, what are you all waiting for? Didn’t you hear the announcement? Those creatures are Commander-level!” a middle-aged man yelled at Ai Jiangtu and his crew.

As a matter of fact, the national team who had just arrived in the East Maritime Fortress was still lost in their thoughts.

If it weren’t for the fact that the two ferocious beasts were only less than a hundred meters away, they would never believe that sea monsters were reckless enough to show up in human territory like this!

“The East Maritime Fortress is basically a battlefield. It’s common for the sea monsters to invade the town just like that,” Nanyu said to the others.

“Let’s stop them. Otherwise, these Commander-level monsters will surely result in lots of casualties,” suggested Ai Jiangtu fearlessly.

“I’ll pass. Those two are Commander-level, after all...” said Jiang Yu.

“We’ll see how it goes first,” said Ai Jiangtu after second thought. There was indeed no reason to put the team at risk, not to mention that most members on the team were still in the Intermediate Level. Even those who had achieved the Advanced Level were unable to cast Advanced Spells fluidly. The Commander-level creatures would kill them in an instant!

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts had muscular upper limbs, and their bodies were covered in glowing, icy scales. On top of that, the scales had sharp spikes between them, especially on their four arms, which were as thick as hammers. Their arms were covered by spikes. If the creatures hit them with their arms, they would most likely be impaled on them!

Their lower bodies were like giant shrimp, covered in blue armor that glimmering like jewels. The legs of a shrimp were thin and long, like whiskers, but the legs of the Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts were sharp and long. They looked more like the legs of a gigantic mantis instead...

A shrimp was usually considered a gentle creature, yet these Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts were giving off a ferocious aura. Even without their spiked arms, it felt like their legs could easily stab through anything. They looked extremely dangerous and menacing!

Obviously, creatures like these were considered were exceedingly dangerous in the East Maritime Fortress. After the announcement and alarm went off, the people who initially thought they were only some small sea monsters immediately fled to the shelters in panic.

Luckily, the people in the town were quite used to emergencies like this. Most of the people were Magicians, so the Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts had yet to kill anyone. They were venting their frustrations on the buildings! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Not all buildings in the East Maritime Fortress are occupied. Some are built just to distract the sea monsters,” Nanyu informed them.

“That’s good to hear. Otherwise, it’s difficult to tell how many would die if the buildings were full of residents.”

The two Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts were extremely hot-tempered. They simply grabbed onto a building and dragged it off of its foundation, before lifting it above their heads.

Unfortunately, the sea monsters happened to be tossing the building in the direction of the team. Ai Jiangtu realized the approaching danger and immediately unleashed his will to slow down the building flying at them.

“The building is too big, I can’t stop it completely!” Ai Jiangtu told the others behind him.

“Don’t worry, we can handle ourselves!”

“Such violent sea monsters!”

Lifting a building and tossing it at them; it clearly showed the terrifying strength of the creatures!

Luckily, the members of the national team had simultaneously cast defensive spells. A huge Sacred Shield: Rampart and Rock Barrier immediately appeared in front of the team and protected them.

The gray-white building smashed into pieces after colliding with the Sacred Shield: Rampart. It totally collapsed as it hit the Rock Barrier, sweeping the dust into the air across the street.

“They discovered our presence, back off!” Jiang Shaoxu was a Psychic Magician. She immediately sensed the anger of the two ferocious beasts.

The team immediately withdrew. They were almost at the end of the street when one of the Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts caught up to them.

The creature had smashed its way through the debris. It stood on the wreckage of the building as its third eye poked out and glared at the members of the national team through the dust scattered in the air.

“Run, run, run!”

“Go right!”

“Why not left?”

“What’s with the nonsense!”

It was difficult to come to a consensus when there were too many people. Li Kaifeng, Guan Yu, Jiang Shaoxu, and Zu Jiming were initially heading left before they realized Zhou Xu, Zhao Manyan, Nan Rongni, Mu Ningxue, Ai Jiangtu, and the rest had gone right instead. They quickly turned around to regroup with the team.

The speed of Commander-level creatures was rather shocking. Since the Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts were smaller in size than other Commander-level creatures, it usually implied that they either had impressive speed or were able to cast powerful spells.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast lunged out from the debris. The long legs on both sides of its body were moving rapidly as it caught up to Jiang Shaoxu and Zu Jiming in mere seconds!
