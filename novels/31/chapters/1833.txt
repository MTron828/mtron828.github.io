Mo Fan initially thought there was only a single wave pouring down at him. However, he soon witnessed an astonishing sight.

The white wave was like a heavenly river falling rapidly from a cliff, yet it just kept coming until it had filled up half the sky. It felt like it was going to cover half the island!

Mo Fan was smaller than even the tiniest tree on Dawn Island, not to mention the waves were pouring right down onto his location. He even gave up on the urge to run away. He could only watch the waves fall onto him with wide eyes!

The force of the waves was comparable to a heavenly soldier slamming his fist on the ground. Mo Fan naively thought he could find a safe corner somewhere, but the whole forest was instantly devoured by the waves!

Mo Fan’s flames were put out once again. He barely moved away from the area where the waves were the strongest, but he was still dragged to the bottom of the mountain by the unstoppable waves.

The waterfall lasted for quite some time. The water even filled the valleys nearby. The domestication ranch was now thoroughly soaked in water.

“How insane is that creature? Is it trying to drown the whole island?” Zhao Manyan had run a fair distance away. He watched the waves surge past him like an angry sea.

Zhao Manyan also knew how to cast the spell Sky Waterfall, but his version of the spell was like a little sink-tap compared to the Manta Ray Bird Emperor’s dam. He somehow believed Mo Fan’s provocation had a greater chance to become his last words, compared to the chance of the words he previously uttered becoming his last words.

“Did anyone see Mo Fan?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“I think he was knocked to the bottom of the valley,” Lingling said indifferently.

“Tell Miss Tangyue to retrieve his corpse from the valley. Let’s leave this place while there’s still time before it’s morning,” Zhao Manyan said. His life was already in great danger, before he even found a single trace of a Totem Beast. Zhao Manyan realized he should not be so stubborn sometimes. It was just a chance to achieve the Super Level. He still had plenty of ways and opportunities if he failed here. There was no need to go all out with these unfriendly birds!

“You were the one who insisted on coming here, and you’re the one asking to leave first? Where the hell is your integrity?” Jiang Shaoxu sneered disdainfully.

“Mo Fan is as tough as a cockroach. He’s going to be fine, but I’m not sure if he can still fight the Bird Emperor after being swept away by the waves,” Lingling said.

“I think we should give Evil Star another shock with the magic netting to weaken it. Otherwise, that young man won’t have a chance to defeat it,” Chen Shuo spoke up.

“But the domestication ranch... oh, it’s slowly surfacing from the water. Were the buildings ten years ago so sturdy then? It did not collapse after being hit by such powerful Water Magic!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The domestication ranch was built on a slope. The buildings slowly resurfaced after the waves flowed into the valleys and lower ground. The devices in the buildings were well-protected. Chen Shuo knew they were going to be fine.

“We should give the Manta Ray Bird Emperor another shock while Mu Bai and Miss Tangyue are still able to hold their ground!” Zhao Manyan said.

Zhao Manyan, Lingling, Jiang Shaoxu, and Chen Shuo returned to the domestication ranch. The waves were Summoned with magic, so they had dissipated fairly quickly.

They suddenly heard footsteps from the corridor when they were about to operate the devices. The footsteps were oddly clear, as if they were stepping on water.

Jiang Shaoxu glanced toward the corridor in alarm. Zhao Manyan was shocked too!

Was it a ghost? Why would there be footsteps when the domestication ranch was abandoned ten years ago? Tangyue and Mu Bai were busy fending off the Manta Ray Evil Birds. He could still see the light of their spells flickering out there. There was no way they had come back to the building!

“Who’s there!?” Jiang Shaoxu asked coldly, her face alert.

The footsteps approached. Several figures soon came into the room from the corridor. They were wearing different outfits, but they all had the same logo on them.

The group was led by a bulky man. His eyes scanned the place, his face cold and stern, before saying, “I’m the chief of Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, Zhu Qi!”

As a matter of fact, Jiang Shaoxu already knew who the people were before the man spoke, as she had recognized two of the people behind the man who claimed to be the chief. They were none other than Zhu Min and Li Dong, while the others all had the logo of Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union on their outfits.

“It’s the Enforcement Union! Great, we just happen to need your help!” Chen Shuo was overjoyed.

Chen Shuo thought he could no longer rely on Mo Fan to defeat the Bird Emperor, and the chief of the Enforcement Union was the perfect candidate to take over Mo Fan’s role. As the highest authority in Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, his strength was definitely on par with some of the Councilmen!

“How bold of you! Dawn Island is clearly off-limits! Will you be able to bear the consequences if you end up provoking those creatures to attack the nearby towns!?” Zhu Qi harrumphed coldly. He was extremely displeased by them.

“Well, we were trying to eliminate the threat!” Chen Shuo was lost for words.

“Where’s the vice chief?” Zhu Qi asked.

“She’s on the mountain in the south.”

“Is there anyone else apart from the people here?” Zhu Qi asked.

“Chief, I think there’s another Mage on the mountain in the north, too,” Li Dong said.

“It must be the guy named Mo Fan,” Zhu Min said. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhu Qi glanced at the mountain in the south, as if he was looking for Tangyue.

He blurted out a moment later, “Is it morning?”

“Yes, the sun had risen,” a senior enforcer said.

“Mm, we’ll go and get Tangyue, while the rest of you regroup with the guy in the north. As for you people, you will behave yourself and stay here. I hate people who bring me trouble the most! You’ve already done it once, but if there’s a second time, I won’t go easy on you...” Zhu Qi said expressionlessly.
