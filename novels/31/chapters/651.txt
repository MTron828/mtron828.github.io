“Well done, Elder Ling Xi!” yelled Han Ji in excitement.

It had been a while since Han Ji had participated in a thrilling battle against demon creatures; basically ever since he was promoted to the president of the Clock Tower Magic Association. The endless demon creatures in their surroundings and the fearless comrades at his side reminded him of the battles he had once fought against the sea creatures at the shorelines of the nation.

“For the Ancient Capital!” The shadowy figure turned out to be a glamorous woman. Her waist was tied with a blue silk cloth. Both her drifting hair and the silk illustrated her determination to kill. She must have been quite a talented beauty back in the days.

The woman was the Elder of the Hunter Union, Ling Xi. Her status was higher than a Senior Hunter. Even though she was on the list of authorities that were initially going to be executed, it did not stop her from having the resolve to clear a path for the sake of the Ancient City.

That spell was the real ultimate of the Wind Element. Zhang Xiaohou’s primary Element was Wind, too. It was his first time experiencing the strength of a Super Wind Spell. The deadly formation consisted of a thousand wind blades, and the Slaughtering Wind Slash had almost slashed the ground in half. Zhang Xiaohou always thought Wind was more about utilizing its agility to harass his enemies, but after witnessing the attack, he could not help but have a new understanding of the Wind Element!

A real Wind Magician would leave nothing alive within several hundred meters. The wind blades would simply cut apart every single enemy within their range!

Zhang Xiaohou was utterly impressed by that strength. His eyes were filled with the anticipation of achieving the Super Level.

“Protection on both sides, full speed ahead!” Han Ji’s voice came into everyone’s ears.

Squads of Magicians with different magical glows appeared on both sides of the Imperial Magicians. Perhaps they were not strong enough to kill hundreds or thousands of undead with a single Spell, but when their Star Orbits and Star Patterns combined together, the storm of Spells they cast could still match the strength of a Super Spell as they blasted the lines of undead coming from both sides!

The place ahead was covered in bones. The Imperial Magicians continued to press forward. Elder Ling Xi had cleared a long path ahead, allowing the Imperial Magicians to advance smoothly.

The Water Curtains were not a static defense, either. They followed the formation as the Magicians moved forward. The blue barriers flowed like waterfalls around Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, Fang Gu, and Su Xiaoluo as they advanced, shoving the undead that managed to break through the defense away!

“Zombies, a large pack of zombies is coming!” some Commander’s voice echoed in the sky above the army of Magicians.

Mo Fan and the others had already traveled a kilometer. The land between the inner walls and them was covered in corpses, the spectacular scene was utterly breathtaking.

Obviously, clearing the path was not enough. They had just finished slaughtering the skeletons, but a large group of zombies was already heading toward them. They were initially attracted to the small gate where the volunteers were. Either the volunteers were all dead, or the undead commanders with higher intelligence had realized that their group was actually the main force, and had sent the zombies after them!

The army of undead was mostly made up of zombies, so the incoming army looked like a black ocean. Whenever they attacked, they would surround their target and isolate it like an island. The path leading back to the city was already blocked off.

“The Mountain Zombie is sending the zombies over here. They are coming, prepare for battle!” The Commander was a Psychic Magician, using Psychic Voice to make sure that everyone could hear him.

Glancing into the distance, even though the black tide of zombies was still a few hundred meters away, it felt like they were about to overrun them. The Light Magicians had barely cleansed the presence of death surrounding them, but a new wave was already spreading in their direction with the zombies!

“Poison, It’s a Poison Storm!”

A poisonous storm was sweeping toward the humans before the army of zombies even arrived. The poisonous mist turned into a storm, which rapidly consumed the groups of Magicians...

The inner city was shaking from the movement of the zombies. The people behind the golden barrier watched the army of Magicians being devoured by the poisonous storm...

Black, black everywhere, even the magical glow surrounding the Magicians had disappeared, let alone their tiny figures. It looked like an enormous poisonous beast had just swallowed the whole army of Magicians into its stomach. The people felt a chill go down their spines as the place fell into dead silence!

“Were...were they wiped out, just like that?”

“I can’t see anything, apart from zombies.”

“So it still comes down to this, leaving the barrier is only going to get us killed.”

The Magicians left behind to guard the city, and the civilians waiting with hope, suddenly fell silent. They could not make any noise despite the strong urge to burst into tears. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The small gate was covered in bodies and fresh blood, and the battle to the north had disappeared inside the poisonous storm. The whole city was dumbfounded.

“There’s light, look, there’s light!” a Battlemage standing on the walls suddenly yelled.

“There’s light indeed...the storm is weakening, oh! It’s disappearing, the poisonous storm is disappearing!” yelled another Battlemage.

More people on the walls soon saw the sacred golden light bursting out from the storm. It was like ten thousand golden rays piercing through the body of an enormous poisonous beast. The poisonous storm slowly dissipated, split apart by the light...

Golden rays shone upon the Magicians. Dense Star Orbits, Star Patterns and Star Constellations had constructed the most spectacular magic formation on the battlefield, its brilliance lighting up the whole place with a formidable aura!

“They are fine. The Light Magicians managed to cleanse the poisonous storm. They are preparing for a counterattack!”

The first voice erupted from the walls, before it spread further into the inner city and across every street and refugee shelter.

The majority of the people were not at the walls, and thus they were unable to see the situation of the battle between the humans and the undead. However, as they listened to the roars of the people on the walls, they could feel their hearts hanging in their throats. The traditional method of spreading the information across the city using shouts made their hearts beat rapidly.

Kill them, kill them all! The ocean of undead was no match for the protectors of mankind. Even though the number of undead was ten, even a hundred times higher than that of the Magicians, it would never extinguish the raging flames inside the Magicians’ hearts after their city was invaded!

“Hail Magicians, Hail Magicians!”

“Hail Magicians! Hail Magicians!”

The Magicians had become the people’s hope. When the undead was massacring them and trampling their homes, only the Magicians were able to butcher these demons!

When the people trapped in the inner city saw the overwhelming number of corpses on the ground and the army of Magicians moving into the distance, they completely vented their anger toward the humiliation from the disaster. No one was willing to be trampled on or surrender to the undead. Even when they were at a disadvantage, even after losing half their city, the Magicians would surely avenge them!

The people were deeply moved by the unyielding Magicians and the path they had cleared, and burst into an uproar hot-bloodedly... who cared if the path could not lead them to dawn!?
