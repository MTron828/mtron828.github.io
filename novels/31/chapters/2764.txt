Chapter 2766: Silver-Blue Valley Trap

Night Rakshasa had been leading everyone forward. They could not use magic at will, so their progress was slow.

After passing through the mountains near the cone-shaped volcano, they entered a valley with a long silver-blue river. The terrain in the valley was vast, and there was a town with gray and silver buildings.

The town had not been damaged and was relatively well preserved. It was probably because the residents here had completely migrated not long ago. The whole town seemed alive, and the streets looked very clean.

‘Could it be that Commander Hua was hiding in the Silver-Blue Valley City to recover from his injuries?’ wondered Mo Fan.

Mo Fan used his dragon sense to observe the surroundings, including the distant mountain, to ensure there were no traces of Ocean Demons or Hunter Dirty Demons.

“You all go to the hilltops and keep an eye out for the enemy. If there is any news about the Ocean Demons, you must send us a signal immediately. Understand?” Pang Lai instructed several Royal Mages.

These Royal Mages were all middle-aged. Some of them looked very familiar. They had probably attended the Magic Association or some important events since they were the experts of the Forbidden City. Their cultivations had all reached the top, but they were still careful.

According to Pang Lai’s instructions, the three Royal Mages occupied three mountains which overlooked the Silver-Blue Valley City.

“Let’s go. The Scroll of Dawn that we brought should be able to make Commander Hua recover faster,” said Pang Lai.

The mission of the Royal Mages was not to rescue Commander Hua. It was impossible to save a Forbidden Mage from the pursuit of an orthodox emperor in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with their cultivation. What they had to do was get the Scroll of Dawn to Commander Hua.

It was a magic scroll engraved with a great healing method. By reading the forbidden language on it, they could apply pure great healing magic to one of them. Even a Forbidden Mage could restore life functions, mental state, and repair damaged souls in a short period of time.

“Night Rakshasa, are you sure that Commander Hua is here?” Ye Mei was somewhat skeptical.

Night Rakshasa was running along the street. It only stopped when it reached Hexagon Fountain Square in the center. Tall buildings surrounded the fountain square.

......

The floor of the fountain square was not flat tiles but countless pieces of transparent semi-blue tempered glass. When they looked at the glass floor, they saw the water in the hexagonal fountain flowing outward in a beautiful vortex.

Many buildings around the square had glass walls, which made the entire Hexagon Fountain Square look very modern and artistic. It could be a symbol of Silver-Blue Valley City.

Night Rakshasa ran a few laps along the hexagonal fountain. After a while, it picked up a military glove from the clean water in the fountain. The glove was very thin, and there was blood on it. It was unknown how long it had been soaking in this fountain.

“Where’s Commander Hua?” Ye Mei became a little anxious when she saw the military glove.

Night Rakshasa found a military glove, but there was no trace of Commander Hua.

“Is that Commander Hua’s blood?” whispered Jiang Yu.

Night Rakshasa nodded.

“Why would Commander Hua throw the bloody military glove here? Is it to confuse theOcean Demons?” Pang Lai said.

“In my opinion, we might have fallen into a trap.” Said Mo Fan.

Right then, signals appeared on several mountains in different directions. The Forbidden Mages, who were on the lookout, had sent these signals.

Pang Lai’s face darkened. Could it be that this was a trap set by the siren?

They knew that humans would send experts to rescue Commander Hua, so they deliberately dropped a bloody military glove left by Commander Hua when he fought against the Black Claw Emperor to lead the human reinforcements into this trap.

“These bloody Ocean Demons! Let’s go!” Pang Lai shouted.

Ye Mei glared at Night Rakshasa. Night Rakshasa was innocent. How could it have known this was a trap? It had only followed the scent.

“Night Rakshasa?” Jiang Yu hugged Night Rakshasa. He touched its small head and comforted it. “It’s okay. I believe you will find Commander Hua.”

“Meow.” It seemed to be telling Jiang Yu something else.

Jiang Yu listened carefully. Then, he began to search around. It wasn’t clear what he was looking for.

The Great Mages who were assigned to keep a lookout for the enemy in the mountains returned with solemn faces.

“Chief, we’re surrounded. There’s an army of Hunter Dirty Demons in the west.”

“The Stingray Legion is coming from the south.”

“There are a few big monsters in the north, and they are coming.”

The three Great Mages reported.

Pang Lai’s face became serious. He observed the terrains around the Silver-Blue Valley City.

“Chief, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and choose a place to attack right away!” Ye Mei said.

“Don’t panic. Instead of rushing and attacking randomly, it’s better to set up Heavenly Bottle Magic Formation here. Then, we can look for an opportunity to escape. Did you three do what I specifically told you before?” Pang Lai asked the three Royal Great Mages.

The three Royal Great Mages nodded.

“Great!” Pang Lai’s face softened a little. “Ye Mei, you go get some water from the river. Make sure that the water source is not interrupted.”

“Guards of Four Directions, you guys immediately go to the entrance of Valley City, which is the intersection point. Make sure you defend it.”

“The rest of the people attack the city!”

Pang Lai appeared formidable when giving commands. He instantly transformed from an old and gentle man to a battle-worn veteran. His steady commands and razor-sharp focus inspired others.

Mo Fan had never seen Pang Lai like this. Most of the time, Pang Lai was an old, gentle professor in a big hat. He was full of knowledge but had no power, until now. Mo Fan had admired the chief Royal Great Mage.

Pang Lai stood in the middle of the square street and cast some spells. He was a well-known Formation Mage in the country, and Mo Fan had always been weak in the profound meaning of formation. He knew nothing about formation.

“What is the Heavenly Bottle Magic Formation?” Mo Fan asked Jiang Yu next to him.

Jiang Yu was absent-minded. He was still looking around.

“What are you looking for?” Mo Fan asked again.

“Night Rakshasa said that the bloody glove was not the only thing it smelled. There should be something else,” Jiang Yu replied
