With a heavy heart, Mo Fan quickened his pace.

Heavens knew if the creature was chasing after them, or was actually right above them. The black poisonous miasma might be able to murder most creatures within an instant, but it did not necessarily mean no creature was able to reside in it!

The truth was, Mo Fan had already noticed that something did not make sense not long after he entered the place. It was unlikely that the organizers would place the treasure at a place like this. It was obviously a forbidden land that could easily cost the participants their lives.

As he thought, something did go wrong. The team ahead of them was dead, and were hung upside down to let their blood drain. It seemed like the creature above the stone was not a fan of blood... Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Some time later, Mo Fan asked Ton, “Where are we?”

Tony turned around, his forehead covered in cold sweat while his eyes were filled with terror.

Mo Fan immediately realized something when he saw the man’s reaction. He quickly asked Ayleen to light up their surroundings.

Ayleen cast the Brilliant Light, revealing the tall walls nearby. The place ahead was spacious, and it seemed to be the bottom of a pond... and right at the middle was a pitch-black boulder!

Mo Fan could feel his skin crawling!

“Asshole, what are you thinking?” Mo Fan was enraged.

“I...I panicked a little and took the wrong path. There were seven paths at the exit, so I must have taken the one beside the right path, but even if I took the wrong path, we shouldn’t be back here, either!” Tony fell to the ground with a pale face.

“Go back!” Mo Fan said decisively.

The group of four immediately took the same path they came. After leaving the zigzag path, they could simply follow the landmarks and made their way toward the mountain they came from, since it was the only spot where the poisonous fog was thin enough for them to leave the place safely!

Under great pressure, it was Mo Fan’s turn to lead the way. He strictly followed the path that he had memorized before, since he had not trusted Tony fully yet. He should not have a problem finding the exit.

The group quickened their pace, their hearts pounding heavily. After some time, when the Brilliant Light revealed the same pitch-black boulder with blood dripping on it, they felt like they were about to go nuts!

“We...we are back here again!” Ayleen looked at the boulder in front of her in disbelief. Her voice was filled with fear!

“Come, let’s try again, there’s no way we are trapped here, we must leave this place!” Tony said. “Even if we’re trapped down here, I don’t want to stay here!”

The corpses of Kelly and his group were hanging above them. It was likely that their blood had dried up too. The blood in the hole on the boulder had already overflowed, and was flowing down it like a spring. It did not matter how many times they had seen it, it was still terrifying!

Mo Fan raised his head slightly. Even though he was extremely unwilling to face the creature above them, he knew it was meaningless to try running away. They kept coming back here. It turned out that the creature did not mind them leaving either, since it already knew the group was eventually going to come back...

“Ayleen, slowly lift the Brilliant Light, but not too quick,” Mo Fan said to Ayleen in a deep voice.

Ayleen was panicking too. She bit her lips and followed Mo Fan’s instructions, using the Brilliant Light to light up the eerie darkness above them...

The orange light slowly peeled the darkness away and lit up the bodies that were hanging in the air. Their bodies were a lot skinnier, as their blood had run dry.

It was hard to imagine that the students who were alive not long ago would end up like this in such a short period. Mo Fan wondered what the organizer and spectators would feel if they saw this.

The light continued to rise, and they finally managed to get a clear view. They noticed some transparent strings, like woven silk attached to the dead bodies...

As the light continued to rise, they noticed even more strings, and to their utter surprise, there were lots of corpses hanging higher up!

Many corpses had fully dried up, like mummies; it was hard to tell how many years they had been here for!

“Are...are these some kind of specimens?” Tony said through chattering teeth.

Mo Fan did not speak. He knew the creature was somewhere above them, between the woven silk.

“Something is moving!” Ayleen said as she saw something.

Mo Fan followed the direction that Ayleen was pointing at and saw a creature with multiple legs on the sides of its body, like a scorpion or a spider. He was struggling to count the number of legs because of the cloudy air, but he could see the creature moving freely between the strands of silk. If they had not seen the silk, they would simply think that the creature was moving through the air!

The creature was crawling down, its body was surprisingly similar to that of a human. It had a tiny head compared to its muscular body, and a long tail like a snake...

Most of its body was covered in poisonous scales. Its appearance resembled the combination of a human, a scorpion, a spider, and a snake, and was several times scarier than the demon creatures in the outside world. Ayleen felt her scalp turning numb and her limbs turning feeble as soon as she saw the creature.

“There...there’s another one!” Tony pointed at a wall nearby.

The wall was perfectly straight, and right where the light had reached its maximum range, a similar-looking creature was climbing down along the wall. Its eyes had no focus, yet they could sense the greed and savagery of the creatures, and the strong scent of death they were emitting, as if they had come from Hell!

“Does...does...does anyone recognize these creatures?” Tony asked.

Both Ayleen and Mu Ningxue had never seen anything like them. They had never even read anything about the creature in their books.

However, the fact that they could murder an entire group in such a short time clearly implied how dangerous they were!

“Mo Fan, I’m afraid we won’t be able to take them on with our current strength. I might have to use the Ice Crystal Bow...” Mu Ningxue whispered to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan nodded.

The creatures were clearly nothing to be messed with. They were going to end up just like the other team if they were careless. If Mu Ningxue believed she had to use the Ice Crystal Bow, it meant they were unable to take the creatures on with their current strength!
