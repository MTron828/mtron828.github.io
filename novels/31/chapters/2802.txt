Chapter 2803: Unprecedented Harvest

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Little Loach had been absorbing the energy from the Underground Holy Spring. Its small world had transformed into a vast and endless underworld ocean with limitless Soul Remnant and Soul Essence. They glowed in ethereal blue like a small mica cluster.

Mo Fan was confident that Little Loach was undergoing a transformation. It was compatible with the Underground Holy Spring energy. Its transformation was more palpable than when it had absorbed the Ancient King’s soul. Mo Fan even suspected a connection existed between the Underground Holy Spring and Little Loach.

Mo Fan basically did not have time to cultivate in peace these days. However, he clearly sensed that his cultivation had improved as Little Loach continued to indulge in the rich holy spring essence.

It was as if Little Loach had built a greenhouse for Mo Fan, allowing his eight elements to grow dramatically in a perfect environment. Even though he had not truly cultivated them, he felt several of his elements were about to break through the barriers. The energy was terrifying!

Mo Fan had been busy fighting the war in Hawaii. His cultivation would have increased drastically if he had found some time to cultivate. That was why he was so defensive when Song Feiyao had mentioned the Underground Holy Spring.

!!

He could not afford to forgo such a treasure!

“I understand that negotiating with you in this situation is very selfish. But I’m hoping you can help me seek mercy from the law enforcers at Licheng City so that the islanders can take practical actions to atone for their misdeeds,” said Song Feiyao. She stared expectantly at Mo Fan.

“The law is not under my control.” Mo Fan did not agree to Song Feiyao’s request.

God had condemned the Licheng Afterglow Islanders because they had been willing to let others die. Their sin was unforgivable. Therefore, the people at Licheng City had the final say. Mo Fan couldn’t do anything.

“How about another Underground Holy Spring in exchange?” Song Feiyao was determined.

Mo Fan’s jaw dropped. ‘They still have another Underground Holy Spring?! Where is it? What in the holy hell?’ Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Underground Holy Spring at Licheng Afterglow Island provided a massive amount of energy. It was no surprise that Mo Fan could complete three or four elements within a very short period.

If he was given another Underground Holy Spring, achieving Super level in all his eight elements would no longer be wishful thinking!

......

Mo Fan was thrilled. He was so excited that he almost shot up into the sky. He restrained himself from falling to his knees and pleading for the other Underground Holy Spring. He kept his cool.

He said calmly with a tinge of hypocrisy, “I’ll try my best to negotiate with the law enforcers of Licheng City,” he said calmly, cursing himself for being a hypocrite. “But I can’t interfere with their decision if they have already made the judgment.”

Song Feiyao smiled radiantly. It took his breath away. He had never seen her this happy ever. She was beautiful just like he had thought when he had met her at the temple.

...

It was not very difficult to fulfill Song Feiyao’s request.

Licheng Afterglow Islanders had a high level of cultivation. In this era filled with threats, the law enforcers could charge them as guilty mages and use them for battle reformation. By doing so, they could make up for their sins by earning some merits by helping in the battle. This would be the best way to punish them.

That was what Song Feiyao needed. She wished the islanders could be given a chance to atone for their sins.

Mo Fan could easily deal with the law enforcers at Licheng City. Licheng City had become a fortress. The army there would handle criminals from Licheng Afterglow Island.

Mo Fan had assisted them in tackling the lightning disaster. Hence, the people at Licheng City owed him. If Mo Fan was willing to talk to them about the islanders, the people at Licheng City would listen. The issue wasn’t that great.

“I’ll talk to the men over there. They are willing to listen to my suggestion.”

“Thank you so very much.”

“Now, what is this about the other Underground Holy Spring?”

“Wait for me at Hang Zhou. I’ll return to Licheng Afterglow Island. Eldest Granny is the one who has the exact knowledge about it. You have spared them, so I’ll try to negotiate with them. I believe they won’t keep this a secret forever,” said Song Feiyao.

“So, you don’t even know where it is?” Mo Fan felt like he had been cheated.

“I swear with my spirit soul that I’ll provide you the location for the other Underground Holy Spring,” Song Feiyao said firmly.

“Okay. But the Green East Sea God must stay at Hang Zhou. We need to conduct an experiment with the totem beasts,” said Mo Fan.

“Okay.” Song Feiyao nodded.

...

Song Feihyao had a very high level of cultivation. Her cultivation was as high as the Royal Great Mages. However, just like the other ladies from the island, she was poor at actual combat.

She had a way to return to Licheng Afterglow Island instantly. The Green East Sea God was reluctant to separate from her. However, with the Moon Moth Phoenix around, the Green East Sea God obliged.

After Song Feiyao left, Mo Fan returned to Hang Zhou with the three greatest totem beasts.

He sat on the Green East Sea God’s back. He took out his pendant excitedly and kissed it. “Little Loach, did you hear that? There’s another Underground Holy Spring!”

Little Loach glowed. It desired the other Underground Holy Spring, too!

Mo Fan possessed Fusion Magic. If he achieved Super level for all of his eight elements, his strength would not be different from those who had completed their four elements because he possessed the power of the Blessing of God’s Seal and Darkness Source. By then, he would be capable of taking on Ocean Demons of the Eight-headed Serpent’s level. His strength would be comparable to that of the Royal Great Mages even without the help from the totem beasts!

The three greatest totem beasts had gathered. A more powerful and ancient totem beast would appear soon. If Mo Fan found it, his strength would undergo another round of transformation. By then, he could face the battle on his own even without the assistance of his Demon element magical power.

Mo Fan was very powerful. He felt depressed after what Commander Hua had said to him.

‘Was it true that he would be able to protect humans and reclaim the territories along the East Coastline only after five years?’

If Mo Fan found another Underground Holy Spring or ancient sacred totem beast, he didn’t need to wait for five years!

...

“The Eight-headed Serpent’s Soul Essence? You’ve absorbed the Ocean Demons’ Soul Essence that the Black Totem Snake killed? Little Loach, are you expanding your factory of Soul Essence? That’s too much to absorb. I believe the absorption today alone can overtake Old Wolf’s group...”

“Here’ s the Red Hunter Dirty Demon Soul Essence... and here are another few Ruler-level Ocean Demon Soul Essence.... Take them all. We’ll exchange them for some Rock Element Heaven Seed materials.”

“The four combined effects of Heaven Rock can multiply. The Stardust, The Country of Sand... Tsk! Tsk! I can cast a perfect spell even without being in a demon form!” Mo Fan grew increasingly excited.

There was a spiritual connection between Mo Fan and the Black Totem Snake because of the Totem Orb.

The spiritual connection allowed Little Loach to absorb all of the Ocean Demons’ Soul Essence after the Black Totem Snake killed them. As a result, Mo Fan had reaped an unprecedentedly great harvest.

Mo Fan even had the thought of putting Commander Hua inside the Totem Orb. By doing so, he could even absorb the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother’s Soul Essence. It could be as valuable as an Earth Fire Pistil!
