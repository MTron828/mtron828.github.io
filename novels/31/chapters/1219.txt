Mo Fan immediately suppressed the Shadow Mages that were naively trying to seal his movements, infuriating Zhang Qihu even further.

In the pitch-black darkness, no one had noticed a petite figure moving silently to the members of the Golden Battle Hunters that were kept prisoner. She was able to remove the strong magic binding them with some unknown method.

Xu Pingdong, Yang Bao, Fei Shu, and the others were set free. They immediately cast Advanced Spells at the traitorous soldiers they were holding a huge grudge against!

“What happened!?” Zhang Qihu turned around and saw his men being ambushed.

“Someone has set the Hunters free. Leader, we should ask General Shi for backup!” a soldier exclaimed.

“Useless pricks, how is it that we can’t handle a few Hunters and a few kids!?” Zhang Qihu yelled.

He was staring at Mo Fan. He charged at Mo Fan fiercely, like a rhinoceros wearing thick stone armor, moving at an insane speed. He was somehow able to see where Mo Fan was in the darkness.

“You’re dead for sure!” Zhang Qihu laughed hollowly.

Mo Fan needed some time to use Blink. Zhang Qihu had found Mo Fan hiding in the darkness through the vibrations on the ground. He was quite confident that the young man had no time to use Blink.

The impact when Zhang Qihu rammed into Mo Fan was shocking. It instantly disintegrated Mo Fan as he froze in astonishment.

Zhang Qihu skidded a long distance away from the momentum before finally coming to a stop. He turned around to take a look at Mo Fan’s remains. Even a person wearing magic Armor was unlikely to survive the impact!

“How is that possible?” When Zhang Qihu turned around, he only saw clouds of black smoke scattering in the air.

There was no sign of Mo Fan’s blood or remains. The thing he rammed into was just a shadow clone!

“Scum, die!” Mo Fan had silently come up on Zhang Qihu’s side. Dark lightning was coiling about his arms.

Zhang Qihu was startled, then burst out laughing.

“Do you seriously think you can penetrate my rock armor? You’re the one that’s going to die!” Zhang Qihu stood disdainfully, as if daring Mo Fan to attack him.

Mo Fan did not say a word. The lightning coils on his arms gradually grew stronger, and fired a Silent Deadly Ray at Zhang Qihu’s chest!

When the lightning with a twelvefold damage multiplier transformed into a ray of light, even Advanced Spells had no chance of stopping it. The lightning swiftly penetrated the rock armor protecting Zhang Qihu’s chest; the unstoppable lightning ray punctured his chest too!

Zhang Qihu spat out a mouthful of blood and fell backward. The Silent Deadly Ray had left a scorched hole the size of a fist in his chest. His eyes were wide open even after he fell to the ground. He could not believe it!

The Earth Element was supposed to have a strong resistance toward the Lightning Element; why did the lightning still manage to penetrate his defense!?

“Not dead yet? You’re pretty tough!” Mo Fan looked down at Zhang Qihu lying on the ground.

Zhang Qihu was twitching. The Silent Deadly Bolt had not fully punctured his body, yet it had left him with serious injuries.

Mo Fan had no intention of letting the man live. As he clenched his fist, fire engulfed his hand and rapidly turned into a fiery sword...

“Leader!” Lao Yin recklessly rode a gust of wind and dashed over to Zhang Qihu when he saw the man’s life was in danger.

Mo Fan did not even bother looking at Lao Yin. His other hand emitted a silver light as he indifferently swung his arm in Lao Yin’s direction, like he was chasing a fly away.

A strong force of the Space Element struck Lao Yin and sent him flying.

Mo Fan raised the fiery sword and stabbed the bloody wound on Zhang Qihu’s chest.

The flames dug into Zhang Qihu’s hardened body. The flames of Ardent Sunset were strong enough to burn the rocks on the Burning Mountains to ashes; they would soon devour Zhang Qihu’s body and reduce him to dust!

Zhang Qihu cried out in agony. The pain of his organs being turned into ashes when his flesh was still intact was unbearable. He could easily tell that Mo Fan was not planning to kill him straightaway. Mo Fan wanted the man to suffer before his death!

“Be a good man in your next life, don’t be scum,” Mo Fan spat coldly.

Mo Fan inserted more scorching flames into the fiery sword. The flames surged wildly inside Zhang Qihu’s body. They eventually exploded, killing the man on the spot!

Zhang Qihu was thinking of avenging his brother, yet he too died a horrible death...

“Leader!” Lao Yin’s eyes reddened. He charged forward like a wild beast.

The female lieutenant was making her way over, too. It was obvious that Zhang Qihu’s death had infuriated them.

“Aren’t you two loyal? Unfortunately, you weren’t able to distinguish right and wrong. You have taken the side of the evildoer, which makes you guilty too!” Mo Fan glanced at the two lieutenants. Lightning was flickering wildly on his palm.

“Sky Lightning Claw!” Mo Fan targeted Lao Yin. The lightning sprang forward ferociously, and tore the man and his magic Armor to pieces. His blood sprayed and his flesh scattered across the ground.

The female lieutenant was startled. Her heart was filled with terror when she looked at Mo Fan again!

How was it possible for such a young Mage to possess such overwhelming strength? He was an Advanced Mage just like them, yet they could not survive a single attack from him!

Mo Fan looked at the female lieutenant, Huang Yi, and said, “Since you’re a woman, I’ll grant you a gentler death.”

Huang Yi had no intention of sitting and waiting for her death. She clenched her teeth, prepared to have a final showdown with Mo Fan...

Suddenly, a Flying Creek Snow Wolf pounced on Huang Yi from behind. His fangs bit her in two.

Her upper body was inside the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s mouth, while the other half with blood pouring out fell limply to the ground.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf did not want to waste its food. He swallowed the lower half of her body after gulping down upper. His mouth covered in blood, the Wolf even gave Mo Fan a smile.

Mo Fan was left utterly speechless.

He bet the female lieutenant was feeling some strong hatred for him prior to her death. He had just promised to grant her a gentle death, but she ended up being bitten in half. It was not Mo Fan’s fault either, as he never knew the Flying Creek Snow Wolf had such a weird fetish of treating bad women like that.

“Go wash your mouth, and don’t ever eat humans without my permission again!” Mo Fan said disgustedly when the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was trying to come closer.

“Awooo~” The Flying Creek Snow Wolf seemed excited, but when he saw Lingling looking at him with disgust too, he immediately realized he had done something wrong. He obediently went to the side to rinse his mouth. He spat out the remains that he had just eaten and buried them somewhere.

The truth was, humans didn’t taste that special at all... DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After taking out the stronger Mages among the enemy, the remaining soldiers no longer posed any threat once the members of the Golden Battle Hunters joined the fight. The rest of the soldiers were mostly Intermediate Mages. They could not possibly do anything after they were suppressed. Mo Fan and the Flying Creek Snow Wolf eliminated half of them, Jiang Shaoxu subdued around ten, and a bunch of them were trapped by Mu Nujiao’s plants. The rest were taken out by the angry members of the Golden Battle Hunters.

“You guys are too kind,” Mo Fan looked around the basin and realized the Golden Battle Hunters had left many of the soldiers alive.

“We should let the army decide what to do with them. We just needed to kill those that tried to resist,” Xu Pingdong said.

“Brother Mo Fan, I have not been impressed by many people in my life, but you have definitely impressed me the most, apart from our leader!” Yang Bao blurted out excitedly. His eyes were brimming with admiration.

“I did hear that the strongest participant in the World College Tournament has Double Innate Elements, and every Element he had was incredibly powerful. I didn’t believe it at first, but I do now. I bet only Mages at the Super Level and above can stand a chance against you!” Fei Shu added.

The group had all seen how Mo Fan faced more than a hundred soldiers on his own. Not only did the Advanced Mages not stand a chance against him, even the spells cast by the squads of soldiers failed to do any harm to him. The man had also killed experienced soldiers like Zhang Qihu, Huang Yi, and Lao Yin as if he was slaughtering a few chickens!

“They weren’t that strong. They were trying to abuse their numbers, yet numbers don’t really make any difference to me,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was not afraid of being overwhelmed by numbers. The abilities of his six Elements allowed him to fight against huge groups of Mages with ease!

The greatest threat among the enemy had been Zhang Qihu. The man was a strong Advanced Mage, his strength equivalent to the Ice Mage that attacked him on the street in America since he had a unique Domain. However, Mo Fan had already had the strength to defeat that Ice Mage back then, so now that many of his Elements had improved significantly, he had no problem taking Zhang Qihu out!

“Where are Ge Ming and Zhang Xiaohou?” Mo Fan asked Xu Pingdong.

“They were brought into that passage. They were looking for the Earth Pistil,” Xu Pingdong pointed out.

“They should have some special way to keep in contact. The people inside are most likely aware of what happened here. Zhang Qihu isn’t scary, Shi Qianshou is the real threat to us. That guy is a Super Mage, even Ge Ming struggled to take him on.”

“Leader was set up by Tong Zhuang and Zheng Tong. He is definitely strong enough to face Shi Qianshou. Mo Fan, we know how capable you are, but Shi Qianshou is a lot stronger than these soldiers here. It’s going to be difficult for you to save the others alone. I believe we should save the Leader first, since he’s the only person that could take on Shi Qianshou,” Fei Shu said.

“Yeah, we’ll head inside and act according to the situation,” Mo Fan agreed.

“What should we do to them?” Jiang Shaoxu glanced at the soldiers that were left alive.

“That’s why I said it’s better to just kill them all. Otherwise, someone has to stay to look after them,” Mo Fan said.

The soldiers felt a chill running down their spines after hearing his words. The young man seemed approachable and dignified, yet he had shown them no mercy with his words. He had no intention of sparing their lives. Even they did not kill the members of the Golden Battle Hunters immediately after subduing them!
