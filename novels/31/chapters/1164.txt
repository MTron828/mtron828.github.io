Mo Fan glanced around him and saw the Saintess’ Hall was surrounded by people. The people that were allowed to enter the Mountain of the Goddess were at least Advanced Mages, and these Advanced Mages were only the ordinary soldiers of the Parthenon Temple’s army!

Ten Golden Sun Knights were lining up at the entrance of the Saintess’ Hall, staring at Mo Fan alertly.

“So you’re the guy that overcame the Starry Mountain Path? You don’t look special at all,” a captain of the Golden Sun Knights named Yafa inspected Mo Fan and grinned disdainfully.

Yafa was the youngest Super Mage of the Parthenon Temple. He was initially Saintess Andi’s Guardian Knight, but after she died, his hope of becoming the Guardian Knight of a Goddess was gone with her. He was appointed to guard the Saintess’ Hall instead.

Mo Fan’s achievement of overcoming the Starry Mountain Path had spread wildly through the Mountain of the Goddess. Yafa was extremely proud. Instead of behaving like a senior, he seemed rather displeased by Mo Fan’s reckless behavior.

On top of it, Yafa found Xinxia an eyesore. They had failed to find the reason for Andi’s death. He believed the vicious woman was somehow related to Andi’s death, too. She had been planning to take out every competitor all along, just so she could become the Goddess! Otherwise, how could she possibly rise from being just an insignificant Probationary Servant to a Saintess, and be only one last step away from becoming the Goddess?

Mo Fan did not even lift his gaze. He simply disregarded the mockery from the captain of the Golden Sun Knights.

The fact that he had overcome the Starry Mountain Path was like a loud slap to the face of every talented Mage in the Parthenon Temple, hence it was quite reasonable that he would be mocked by them.

Mo Fan walked forward and saw another person standing at the entrance. It was Asha’ruiya, with a veil over her face. Her simple, yet noble outfit reminded him of their first encounter.

However, his frame of mind was completely different.

Mo Fan looked at her. Asha’ruiya lifted her gaze and looked back at Mo Fan too.

Asha’ruiya was the first to speak, “Are you suspicious of me?”

“Yes,” Mo Fan nodded firmly.

“It’s true that Andi and Panijia were my biggest competitors. If nothing happened to them, I could never become a Goddess. Obviously, I’m the true winner if I can use Xinxia to take out Panijia, and as a matter of fact, I did consider it before. Deceit is just a part of the competition for the role of the Goddess. The last one standing that claims the seat of the Goddess will take all the fame and glory,” Asha’ruiya said blatantly in front of the knights.

“I’m only suspicious, I’m surely going to find the truth!” Mo Fan said coldly.

“Perhaps your suspicion is utterly meaningless, since you will realize that no one is manipulating her after seeing her in person. It was only an accident that Panijia discovered her true identity,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan did not respond. He demanded of Yafa coldly, “Open the door!”

Yafa did not like being ordered around. His expression twisted slightly.

“Open the door, so he can see the true colors of the person inside,” Asha’ruiya said.

The heavy door slowly opened. The magic spell on it vanished too.

The Saintess’ Hall was very dim. The light of a burning torch hanging on the tall pillar was nowhere enough to light up the spacious hall.

Mo Fan was unable to see inside the hall clearly. He hesitated slightly at the entrance before stepping into the hall.

As soon as he stepped inside the hall, the Vice Hall Master of the Hall of Judgment, Shawshank yelled, “Close the door!”

“He’s only an Advanced Mage. Vice Hall Master, aren’t you being overly worried? So what if he has overcome the Starry Mountain Path? I can take him out easily still,” Yafa said proudly.

“Humph, God knows what that evil woman has up in her sleeves. I have already let Panijia down, I will not allow anything to go wrong during her funeral. I will execute the woman myself, so Panijia can rest in peace!” Vice Hall Master Shawshank said.

The Hall of Judgment was supporting Panijia in the election, but now their candidate had died. They had no way to vent their rage and frustration. They could not wait to make Xinxia pay with her life!

—

The heavy door slammed shut. Magic Runes covered the door, preventing anything from entering or leaving the hall, including via use of Space Magic.

Mo Fan followed the dim light of the torch. The Saintess’ Hall was sealed tight. It felt slightly chilly.

The pillars had lots of faces on them, like a bunch of undying creatures looking down at a prisoner. There was no light or sacred brilliance in the Saintess’ Hall. It felt more like an altar of darkness.

Mo Fan followed the pillars and caught a glimpse of some flames ahead. Braziers were placed in a big circle up a flight of stairs.

The flames of the braziers swayed despite the lack of wind. It looked no different than the site of a burning execution.

At the top of the stairs was an extremely thick pillar. It was clearly the main pillar of the Saintess’ Hall, supporting the magnificent building.

A silver chain was wrapped around the pillar looming like a one-thousand-year-old ancient tree, and its other hand was fastened around the waist of a skinny woman.

She could not stand for too long, thus she had to sit on the icy, cold stone, surrounded by the braziers. The light of the flames shone upon her pale, lifeless face, setting off her haggardness...

She was still wearing the dress of a Saintess. The huge dress spread on the stand like white snow, setting off her unique, sacred temperament.

Mo Fan went up the stairs. He could feel his heart breaking.

Xinxia remained still with her head lowered. She did not see Mo Fan approaching her.

“Xinxia, I’m here,” Mo Fan walked up to Xinxia and called out. He could not tell if she was asleep, or she was unwilling to face him.

Xinxia opened her eyes, filled with complicated feelings.

She knew Mo Fan would come for sure, but... she did not want Mo Fan to come. She was afraid of herself, afraid to face Mo Fan’s eyes.

She finally raised her head and looked at Mo Fan, and was shocked to see him covered in wounds and bruises. Some were still bleeding.

Xinxia covered her mouth as tears started rolling down her cheeks.

Mo Fan could not stand to see her cry. He quickly hugged her.

After hearing the shocking news, Mo Fan had totally lost control of his emotions. He finally reclaimed them when he touched Xinxia’s soft, feeble body. He was finally relieved when his chest was pressing hard against her!

“I’m bringing you out of here,” Mo Fan rose to his feet and broke the chain that was tying Xinxia down.

The chain was not enhanced by magic. Mo Fan took it off with ease. After all, the thing that was trapping Xinxia was not the chain, but the Saintess’ Hall, and the armed forces of the Parthenon Temple outside the Saintess’ Hall!

Mo Fan carried Xinxia in his arms. The girl was a lot skinnier. He could barely feel her weight. He could feel warm tears on the side of his face...

Mo Fan’s words had melted Xinxia’s heart and broke the struggle inside her, but she knew it was not the right thing to do. She was already satisfied she was able to see Mo Fan for the last time.

“Brother Mo Fan, aren’t you going to ask me anything?” Xinxia finally broke the silence.

“Ask what?” Mo Fan said.

“That I...I am someone else,” Xinxia bit her lips and said after a long pause.

Xinxia was struggling even more when Mo Fan did not mention it.

“I still have some blurry recollections in my mind that I was the one that killed Panijia, and even though I could have saved her with my Healing Magic, I watch her blood pour onto my hands. I didn’t feel anything, as if it was perfectly normal. It didn’t feel like me, but it was me,” Xinxia said.

Mo Fan did not speak. He just looked at the girl.

Xinxia did not dare to look Mo Fan in the eyes. She glanced at her legs that were too weak to walk.

Even the strongest Healing spells of the Parthenon Temple had failed to fix her legs. Xinxia had been bothered by it for quite some time, and she finally found an answer to it.

“I placed my blood on the Cardinal Blood Stone, and I saw it responding,” Xinxia said. She did not want to lie to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan remained silent still. Xinxia added, “When I was very young, I remember going to a place, I believe it’s the main altar of the Black Vatican, and I remembered seeing the Cardinal Blood Stone...”

“Before you moved to Bo City?” Mo Fan asked.

Xinxia nodded.

Mo Fan fell silent.

Xinxia bit her lips. She did not tell anyone about it, as she was still unsure if the blurry recollections were actually part of her memory.

“They did not accuse me falsely, Brother Mo Fan. I think... I’m really Salan,” Xinxia hesitated before spilling the beans.

It was utterly ridiculous, yet the evidence was there. No matter how ridiculous it might sound, it was still the truth.

There were different memories hidden inside her body, different personalities. She would be awakened at times to carry out the mission that the Black Vatican had long given her. When everything was done, the other soul would fall asleep, and the Amnesia Bug would hide the truth like it was all a dream.

It was the main reason why no one had seen Salan in person, and why no one knew who Salan was. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If even Salan herself did not know her true identity, how could the Enforcement Union possibly trace her down?

“I, I’m just a decoy to hide her identity... let me go, if I die, she will die too,” Xinxia had no idea how she could convince Mo Fan, but she had to. They could no longer alter the outcome.

“You are not,” Mo Fan said.

“It doesn’t really matter, everyone believes I am, and I did go to the Black Vatican. The Cardinal Blood Stone reacts to my blood, too...Bother Mo Fan, I hope that you are the one that will end my life,” Xinxia’s voice softened. She knew better than anyone else how cruel of a decision it was for Mo Fan.

But she wanted to be selfish for one last time, she just wanted to sleep quietly in Mo Fan’s arms, even if she would never wake up.

“I already told you, you are not Salan!” Mo Fan’s tone intensified.

“Brother Mo Fan...”

“Xinxia is Xinxia, and Salan is Salan, there’s no way they are the same person, nor would they exist in the same body! I don’t care what evidence they have, and I don’t care how many people believe you are her. I only know you are my Ye Xinxia, and no one can harm you, not even the Parthenon Temple and the Holy Judgment Court, not even me!” Mo Fan said firmly, looking at Xinxia’s eyes that were gleaming with tears.

Mo Fan’s words echoed in Xinxia’s ears and landed a powerful blow on her heart. Seeing the firm look in Mo Fan’s eyes, the disguise that Xinxia had put on in order to stay calm collapsed entirely. She immediately turned into a sobbing little girl, hiding inside Mo Fan’s arms...
