Chapter 2890: The Plague Ruler

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Black-Patterned Dragonwasp was unstoppable. Many Ruler-level Ocean Undead were scattered among the Undead army, especially those that were newly born on China’s continental shelf.

The other Ruler-level Ocean Undead were more experienced and possessed a certain level of intelligence. They were aware that the Netherbone Dragon would devour them if they were infected by the Black-Patterned Dragonwasp.

However, the Undead from China’s continental shelf lacked intelligence. They were like newborn Undeads with only the instincts to hunt and gather.

The Black-Patterned Dragonwasp pierced into the skulls of the Undead from China’s continental shelf with its sting. An evil black mark appeared behind the Ruler-level Undead’s skulls.

The black mark spread throughout the Undead’s body rapidly like a disease. The Undead changed from red to black. The strong smell of sickness came from within its bones. It was horrifying.

The Black-Patterned Dragonwasp not only targeted the Undead, but also the powerful Ocean Demons. When it stung the living Ocean Demons, their flesh and organs turned purulent, as though they were covered in mud and water. Their flesh and organs fell off their bodies and they turned into evil black bones!

The Netherbone Dragon flew past them from above. The black bones flew toward the Netherbone Dragon like irons to magnet and repaired its shattered parts. They also added venomous horns and spikes to it.

For a moment, the sky was filled with the Netherbone Dragon’s necrotic gas. The evil aura covered the Pudong area for a short moment before spreading rampantly through the city like a swarm of insects.

An Undead Rat appeared from a pile of carcasses. It was made up of black and hideous bones. Even though it was small in stature, the necrotic gas spilling out of it was terrifying.

More Undead Rats gushed out from the piles of corpses. Their greedy eyes sparkled like emeralds in a dark pool. There were too many of them.

Flap flap flap flap!

Undead Flies hovered in the sky. They came from the Ocean Demons that were rotting. The Undead Flies flew toward the dense epidemic clouds to make them bigger.

Undead Rats, Undead Flies, and the Black-Patterned Dragonwasp…

The Nertherbone Dragon had become the embodiment of all the plagues in this world. It had summoned two other great armies. It became even more powerful. It could even stay independent of the Ocean Queen and become the new ruler of the Plague Empire!

The Azure Dragon’s sacred totem light failed to dispel the terrifying epidemic clouds. On the other side of Huangpu River, Light Element mages constructed Walls of Light. They were aware of how much devastation the creatures within the epidemic clouds could bring to humans.

“What the hell is the Cold Moon Demon Lord doing?!” Mo Fan glanced at it before looking at the transformed Netherbone Dragon.

It had not been easy for the Azure Dragon to wound the Ocean Queen. They thought they had successfully stopped the Cold Moon Demon Lord from chanting, but little did they know that the Netherbone Dragon underwent transformation twice in a row!

“Mo Fan!” Councilman Gu and the Forbidden Mages were nearby.

“We’ll join forces against the Netherbone Dragon,” said Chief Zhu.

“Retreat and go to the river to stop the Undead Rats and Undead Flies. No matter what, you must stop them from flooding into the city,” said Mo Fan.

“I’m afraid that the Azure Dragon and you will have difficulty holding back these creatures. Besides, the Azure Dragon is severely wounded,” said Councilman Gu with concern.

The Azure Dragon’s neck was stung by the Netherbone Dragon’s poisonous tail. The long sting was just under its neck. It was unlikely that the Azure Dragon could stir up a powerful hurricane like before.

The poison would spread throughout its body and affect the Azure Dragon’s ability.

“We’ve cut the connection between the Ocean Queen and its Undead from China’s continental shelf. The Lingyin Monk has cast his spell. The Undead from China’s continental shelf will collapse soon. By then, they will pose little threat to us. We’ll stand guard over the river to give citizens sufficient time to evacuate. After that, we will leave so that we won’t end up perishing in this place,” said Councilman Gu.

The Azure Dragon had severely wounded the Ocean Queen which was very crucial for their survival. This allowed the members from the Forbidden Curse Association to complete their decimation plan to reduce the Undeads’ threat over time.

Still, their reaction had been a little slow. If they had reacted to it before the Netherbone Dragon’s transformation, there would have been fewer terrifying enemies, including the Plague Ruler that threatened the citizens’ lives.

The plague creatures were different from usual demons. Regardless of how the demons roamed about the land or attacked the people, as long as they were killed, they could not regenerate.

But the plague creatures were contagious. They lived in the city sewers and on daily items that most migrants frequently used. They produced garbage. A tiny Undead Rat or Undead Fly could infect a large group of people. Furthermore, if they failed to control the epidemic, it would result in more infected creatures and cause more deaths.

Even if they did not die from the plague or the war, the people would eventually fall sick and suffer in pain. It was a torture to those who were already going through a difficult time.

The Undeads were scary. But the plague was terrifying.

And Undead Plague was the world’s most terrifying thing. It could wipe out any horde in a single blow!

“The waves are coming!” Mo Fan pointed at the high skyline waves.

The entire Pudong was covered by a rainstorm. The rainstorm did not come from the sky, it came horizontally from the ocean.

‘Was it a horizontal sweeping rainstorm?’ he wondered.

When they looked up, they saw that the horizon and the skyline had been engulfed by the massive waves. The Heaven-shaking Demonic Waves were even more monstrous than it appeared to be. It looked as if the other side of the world had drowned. It was dark and depressing.

They turned to the other side and saw that it engulfed souls. The people were unable to fight back and sank into their deepest fears. They lost their mobility and their ability to think. They were paralyzed on the ground and waited for the inevitable doomsday.

Once the Heaven-shaking Demonic Waves reached them, more than half the people were trapped. They couldn’t migrate. Moreover, the Ocean Demon army was in their way. The Magic City and its citizens would sink to the bottom of the ocean.

All battles and efforts would be meaningless if they couldn’t crush the Eye of the Tide.

“We’ve no way out,” Councilman Gu let out a sigh. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“We don’t have any other choice,” said Mo Fan.

Chief Zhu nodded. He did not plan to retreat. If he failed to destroy the Eye of the Tide, his previous effort and perseverance would be meaningless. He decided to fight the Cold Moon Demon Lord to death.

He was a Light Element Forbidden Mage and could inflict damage to the epidemic most effectively.

Just then, he noticed an enormous segment of the Ancient Wall on the north through his peripheral vision. It looked like an ancient war fortress flying toward him.

Chief Zhu was stunned. He asked Mo Fan, “A-Are they sending help?”

Mo Fan turned to see a familiar segment of the green walls. They were flying toward the Azure Dragon. The seal on its forehead was like an eye glowing in divinity and giving out heat!
