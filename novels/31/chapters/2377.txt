Lu Zhengxin was willing to work diligently for the new car. He took off his shirt and jumped into the filthy water.

Mo Fan was suddenly impressed by Chicken Cutlet Brother.

The water was not only full of trash left by the people who had once lived here, the dirt beneath had a foul stench, too. It would be tough to dig up any traces of blood after the place was soaked in water for so long. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

To his surprise, Lu Zhengxin had jumped straight into the water and was digging into the ground!

“Where’s our driver?” Lingling had returned. She asked with a troubled look, “Did the sea monsters take him? Why didn’t you help him out? We have to walk all the way back now.”

“...” Mo Fan had a feeling Lingling was only concerned that they no longer had a lift back.

“He’s looking for traces of blood down there. He studied Magic Substance Theory at the Pearl Institute. We are in luck!” Mo Fan smiled.

“Oh… I just finished testing the samples of the claw. It had a faint trace of skin tissues, but there were also traces of other microorganisms after it had been washed by the rain over a long time. I can’t determine its exact species,” Lingling said with a disappointed face.

The fight had happened too long ago. The clues left on the scene had been damaged.

It was like investigating an old murder case. You were unlikely to find any useful evidence from the scene since it was now mixed with other non-significant clues.

“Let’s see what Lu Zhengxin can find. If we can’t find any useful clues in this area, we’ll have to go elsewhere,” Mo Fan said.

“Yeah.”

Lu Zhengxin was down in the water for a long time. The occasional bubbles rising to the surface indicated he had not drowned.

Mo Fan knew Lu Zhengxin would need more time to do his job. He looked around out of boredom.

A building covered in moss around a kilometer away suddenly collapsed.

The building seemed to have lost its supports. The floors collapsed one by one, and smashed into debris on the ground.

The whole building eventually sank into the sea, leaving only a small pile of debris above the surface. People might assume it was just a pile of construction waste if they did not know the building had existed in the first place.

“Are there any demon creatures?” Lingling asked, also seeing it fall.

“I can’t pick up any presences,” Mo Fan shook his head.

Mo Fan could pick up the presence of a demon creature within a few kilometers, unless the creature had a special ability to conceal itself.

A creature would have had to unleash a huge force to destroy the building. No creature could bring down a whole building without unleashing any strength.

Mo Fan was more leaning toward the possibility that the building had collapsed on its own.

Many jerry-built building projects had never considered the possibility of the building being submerged in water. Pudong District had been drowned for a long time. It was normal for the buildings to collapse eventually, as the tide rose and fell on a daily basis.

Luckily, the buildings close to the airport were of higher quality. If the buildings here had collapsed, Lu Zhengxin would not be able to dig up any traces, even if he worked to his death.

Two other buildings over ten floors tall collapsed in the same direction as the first building. The loud noises were oddly spooky in the deadly silent district.

Mo Fan frowned.

“More jerry-built buildings?” Lingling asked skeptically.

“I don’t know, but I still didn’t pick up any presences...” Mo Fan answered, his face grim.

The buildings were quite some distance away. Mo Fan did not feel the need to investigate the area.

Knowing the size of Pudong District, it was normal for strong sea monsters to be hiding in the dark, not to mention lesser creatures that had built their nests in the area.

It was annoying to fight the lesser creatures. Not only did they have overwhelming numbers, they did not have the common sense to stay alive.

These lesser creatures would keep coming, regardless of their casualties, after someone intruded their territory.

As for the higher-level creatures, most of them would flee for their lives when they sensed a powerful Mage nearby.

Another huge collapse took place. This time, it was a huge office building less than five hundred meters away, with sturdy concrete walls and relatively small windows.

The building was like a gray barrel in their eyes, definitely the sturdiest building in the area. It would be fine even if it soaked in the water for another ten years, but it had collapsed too!

It was like a person who had suddenly lost his skeleton, his skin and flesh were sloughing off and turning into mud.

“Is someone trying to demolish the district?” Mo Fan wondered aloud.

“You still can’t sense anything?” Lingling asked quickly.

Mo Fan shook his head.

The sea monsters were seriously annoying. What were they up to now?

They should just show themselves if they were asking for trouble. Mo Fan would not mind cooking them all with his furnace!

Huge bubbles suddenly appeared under Mo Fan’s feet.

Mo Fan’s heart skipped a beat.

How impressive! It was around five hundred meters away just a second ago, but it was already under his feet!

He had no reason to wait. He should serve it with a Lightning Explosion first...

“Hey, what the Hell are you doing!?” a wet face screamed after popping out of the water.

“Oh, it’s you, I thought you were a sea monster,” Mo Fan quickly withdrew his Lightning Magic. He was able to unleash and withdraw his Lightning Magic freely with the Lightning Acupuncture Points.

“What have our Lu Clan ever done to you!?”

“Did you get the samples?” Mo Fan asked, ignoring the question.

“I did.”

“Then it’s time to go. Something doesn’t feel right here,” Mo Fan said.

They went back to the highway. Lu Zhengxin had already heard the loud collapses in the distance while he was underwater. He started the engine quickly.

He stepped hard on the pedal. The Miami blue sports car swiftly wove through the darkness on the highway.

They suddenly heard a loud rumble inches away, and it kept going!

Lu Zhengxin turned around and immediately shrieked like a terrified crow.

The road behind them was falling off continuously, shattering like flour!

It was less than five meters behind the car, and continued to follow the car as it sped along the highway.

It felt like an invisible pulverizer was following right behind the car. The road continued to fall away. The sections the car was driving on a second ago had already fallen into the sea!

“Holy crap, what the Hell is that thing?” Lu Zhengxin was terrified. He had already slammed the gas pedal to the bottom.

“I don’t know, just drive faster!”

Mo Fan was feeling nervous, too. He would not feel like this if he knew what the creature was.

The problem was that he could not see or sense anything!

There was nothing on the highway, but the bridge was still collapsing behind them. If the car was a little slower, they would have fallen off the bridge by now!

Lu Zhengxin was a street racer, and was able to drive calmly under the shocking circumstances. The car gradually picked up its speed and left the collapsing road behind.

“Well done!” Mo Fan raised his thumb at the driver.

“Holy crap, aren’t you an impressive fighter? Couldn’t you just jump out of the car and get rid of that thing?” Lu Zhengxin yelled at him.

“I would have slapped it to death if only I could see it!” Mo Fan snarled in reply.
