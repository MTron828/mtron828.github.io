Mo Fan could not feel any joy, as the same number had just sent him a text just five seconds earlier. The message only had three letters, SOS, that combined into an international distress signal, basically meaning HELP!

However, before Mo Fan could collect his thoughts, he received a call from the number. The girl was asking him to come over with a calm, yet scared voice. Mo Fan was immediately on guard..

Mo Fan showed the text to the group. Zhao Manyan was about to say something and immediately thought better. “What’s going on?”

“Mind Control, that guy is controlling Li Yu’e, he’s using her to bait us into his trap!” Mo Fan said confidently.

Even though he had only known Li Yu’e for a few days, he could tell that she was a very optimistic and strong girl. Mo Fan could not imagine her saying those words.

That being said, if Mo Fan had not received the weird text from her, he would only be confused by it. However, when he linked the two together, he immediately thought about Philip. It must be Philip controlling her mind!

This Executioner of the Black Vatican was indeed extremely cunning and vicious!

“What do we do now? She might be in danger,” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Don’t panic yet, I don’t think Philip is going to do anything to her. I told her that I’m going to call her when I reach the hospital, so she should be fine until I call her again,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan had reacted quickly. If he had not emphasized it, there was a chance that Philip would have killed Li Yu’e straightaway after the call!

“Should we alert the Sacred Hall Mages?” Mu Ningxue asked.

Mage and Lingling shook their heads. It was obvious that they did not want the Sacred Hall Mages to be involved.

Philip was once close to the Sacred Hall of Liberty. He would surely flee for his life once the Sacred Hall Mages showed up.

However, they had to deal with the Executioner here in New York. Otherwise, it would only bring unending trouble to Mo Fan. The Sacred Hall Mages would only scare the enemy away.

“That guy thinks he’s the hunter that’s hiding in the dark to take my life, but I’m going to tell him who’s the real Hunter!” Mo Fan swore coldly.

Night had fallen, the main streets only had a few vehicles left. Occasionally, a sports car would drive past, leaving a trail of brilliant tail lights behind. The street racers thought the roars of their engines would attract some attention, yet they were only a nuisance, just like a pile of garbage.

Orange-yellow street lamps were lighting up the streets. A few nurses who were done with their shifts walked along the street. Their laughter was quite clear in the quiet night.

The light greatly extended out the shadow of a man. One of the nurses glanced at him, but discovered that he had vanished in the blind spot between the lamps in a mysterious and eerie manner.

The lights in the hospital were mainly white. Mo Fan stood at the entrance of the hospital. There were a lot fewer people present at night, and since the USA was not as densely populated as China, the hospital felt rather empty.

It was actually good news for Mo Fan, as it would not be as tricky to evacuate the hospital if a fight broke out.

In the room on the fifth floor, Li Yu’e was lying on the white bed. Her eyes were staring at the ceiling.

Philip had changed his clothes and was standing by the window, peeking to the outside by lifting the curtains. He did not seem to be in a rush.

He was incredibly patient, since he could strike again if he missed out on the opportunity this time.

“Why must you kill him?” Li Yu’e asked.

“Little girl, you don’t look afraid at all,” Philip turned around. The smile on his face was quite spooky.

“I’ve fallen into your hands. It’s useless being afraid,” Li Yu’e said.

“You’re quite special, aren’t you? Oh, speaking of which, if you are tired of selling drinks, you might be able to become a Psychic Mage. You’re almost twenty, aren’t you aware of how talented you are?” Philip walked to the bed. He picked up an apple in boredom and started peeling its skin.

“I know, but I don’t like it,” Li Yu’e said.

“You’re very interesting,” Philip peeled the apple and cut it in half. He handed one half to Li Yu’e and shoved the other half into his mouth.

Li Yu’e ate the apple without showing any worry.

“I didn’t have a grudge against the kid. I’m only following an order. He has offended someone that he never should have offended,” Philip admitted casually.

“Who is it?” Li Yu’e asked.

“Oh, it’s better if you don’t know... knowing the person won’t do you any good,” Philip said.

“I’m about to die soon, so what difference does it make?” Li Yu’e replied.

Philip looked at the girl and burst out laughing.

“You know what? You are pretty amusing. But then, I have to remind you, dying isn’t the scariest thing. Many people who have offended the person kept begging her to kill them, just so they could die a comfortable death. They were willing to kill their close ones just to earn that wish. Are you sure you want to know a person like that?” Philip answered.

“Forget it then, but I saw a big scar on the back of your hand, with lots of scratches on it. I believe the cuts were meant to cover it up, but I can tell it’s the symbol of the Sacred Hall Mages. Were you a Sacred Hall Mage once?” Li Yu’e asked.

Philip raised his right hand and looked at the back of it.

He hated the symbol. He was willing to cut up the skin of his hand just to get rid of it. Even though it was beyond recognition, the girl was still able to recognize it. If the girl was willing to become a Mage, she would surely be an outstanding Psychic Mage. She was already this observant before Awakening her magic!

“It’s my greatest shame.” Philip raised his head and stared at the ceiling.

“Many people think of becoming a Sacred Hall Mage as the greatest glory,” Li Yu’e observed.

“That’s why the people in this world are dumb... unfortunately, I was one of them, too. I never doubted their beliefs, and even wasted half my life fulfilling responsibilities that did not belong to me. I only wanted them to take care of my daughter, but they couldn’t do it. The marvelous Sacred Hall of Liberty, where the strongest Mages of the world gathered, yet they couldn’t even protect a little girl around your age.” Philip smiled bitterly. He did not seem to be in pain when he was recalling the past. Even his tone remained the same.

However, Li Yu’e knew it was not that the man was extremely calm. It was his way of expressing his hatred!

“What happened?” Li Yu’e asked.

“I had a daughter, I was willing to sacrifice everything to protect her, to watch her grow up. The day when she was chosen to join the Hall of the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple, I was actually happier and prouder than when I was chosen to join the Sacred Hall of Liberty. I once had a superior, he made a mistake, but the Sacred Hall of Liberty was hoping that they wouldn’t have to punish him. In the end, I volunteered to take the blame for him, since he was like an elder brother to me. I was expelled by the Sacred Hall of Liberty, and forced to forfeit my cultivation as the punishment. My superior promised me that he would make sure my daughter become one of the greatest Mages of all time, better than a little Sacred Hall Mage that I was. I believed in him, I was willing to live an ordinary life, I didn’t even mind working as a cleaner on the streets. I thought it was all worth it.

“But one day, something wanted my daughter dead, it dragged her into the Abyss of Death, and wouldn’t even spare her soul. I begged my superior to save her, but he didn’t do it! I fought the thing with my life at stake, but I didn’t have any magic. Do you understand how desperately I hoped that I still had my magic? I was on the ground like a useless dog watching it all happen while hearing the cries of agony of my precious daughter...” Philip’s expression did not shift by much. It was strangely calm in a terrifying way.

Li Yu’e fell silent. She was clueless about the World of Magic, but she could sense a cruelty like nothing she had heard before from Philip’s description!

“But the person I mentioned to you helped me regain my magic, and she even helped me to become stronger, so do you think I will reject a little request as simple as killing a kid?” Philip asked.

Li Yu’e was about to say something when her phone started ringing.

Li Yu’e accepted the call at her quickest speed and was about to scream into the phone. However, Philip was quicker than her. She was unable to let out a scream in time. Her eyes lost their usual glow, and were replaced by a blank expression.

“Are you here?” Li Yu’e asked.

“Yeah, which room are you in?” Mo Fan asked.

“On the fifth floor, the room at the end of the corridor. Did you come alone?”

“Yeah, do you seriously want me to bring a light bulb around?” Mo Fan smiled.

{TL Note: Being a light bulb here means someone else that spoils the atmosphere between a couple trying to have some intimacy.}

“Mmm, there isn’t anyone in the hospital at this time, I’ll be hanging up...”

“Wait, I don’t know where you are still. I’m on the fifth floor, which room at the end of the corridor is yours? Is it the one on the left or the one on the right? There are two rooms here, I don’t want to take the wrong one,” Mo Fan said.

“There’s only one, it’s the one with the lights,” Li Yu’e replied.

“Oh, but weren’t you in the room all this time? How did you know there’s only one room?” Mo Fan responded. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Philip was still controlling Li Yu’e’s mind, and was stunned. He immediately turned around as he realized something.

Several black spikes flew at him. He was completely unaware that Mo Fan had arrived even though he was still on the phone...

The Giant Shadow Spikes were incredibly powerful. Even with his cultivation, the Giant Shadow Spikes would still paralyze him if they landed on him. He would not be able to cast a single spell!

Most importantly, Philip was focused on his conversation with Li Yu’e as he was recalling his ugly past. He did not notice the light in the room dimming all of a sudden, nor did he notice the dark aura lingering in the building and the room!

Nyx Regime!

The Giant Shadow Spikes were able to construct a Dark Formation in the Nyx Regime. Philip did not dare stay in the room a second further. He immediately smashed his way out through the window!
