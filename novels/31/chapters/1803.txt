The White-Marked Wolves opened their mouths and stuck their tongues out. They were spreading their limbs, struggling to recover their balance like dogs that could not swim after falling into a deep lake.

Mo Fan looked up with a grin and studied the White-Marked Wolves floating in the air.

“Come down,” Mo Fan swiped his finger, reverting the order of the area.

The White-Marked Wolves were still getting used to the change in gravity. Their fur immediately stood on end as they fell rapidly when everything returned to normal.

The White-Marked Wolves poured down like a rain, slamming heavily into the ground with their legs facing upward. They were all groaning in pain.

Old Wolf’s eyes widened as he looked on from a distance away. What the heck are they up to? The Mega Drop!?

“Alright, you can send them back and reward them accordingly,” Mo Fan told the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

The energy of the Summoning Element could be used to feed the Summoned Beasts, which Mo Fan was referring to as the reward. The White-Marked Wolves could use the energy to strengthen their claws and become stronger. The White-Marked Wolves were delighted, despite the suffering they had gone through. They stuck their tongues out as if they were telling their master to Summon them whenever he needed a sandbag for practice. They had no dignity whatsoever!

Mo Fan was very pleased with the outcome of the experiment. He was able to understand the practicality of the Chaos Element better. Unfortunately, his Chaos Element was making slow progress. It would be perfect if he could learn the Chaotic Vortex!

——

Mo Fan left the training ground. He was planning to go back to his place to take a nap, yet something had gotten his attention instead. He looked up at the Canton Tower and its glorious lights.

“Damn it, I’ve seriously fallen for his tricks. I swear I’m going to drag him out of that place and butcher him in front of the people of Canton!” Mo Fan cursed. He immediately turned around and went back to the Canton Tower.

Little Flame Belle was confused. She thought Mo Fan was going to buy more chicken wings. She happily flew over to Mo Fan’s head and hummed pleasantly.

Some people were destined to be poor forever, since they were always investing their money in themselves. Mo Fan was a great example: as long as he had yet to fulfill his ambition, all the money he had was only going to end up as a cobblestone along the journey of his cultivation, no matter how much money he had!

He initially thought he could get rid of Feng Zhoulong’s blatant marketing after leaving the Canton Tower. He would eventually calm down and think Feng Zhoulong was merely uttering nonsense, yet after he calmed down, he could not stop thinking about an Earth Element with four additional effects!

Feiniao City...

A selection contest for young adults was occurring in the city center. The participants came from different cities and provinces and gathered in the headquarters cities. Almost every year, the contest would attract a lot of great talents. Barring the World College Tournament, it usually got the most attention in the country.

The contest was more like an influential selection to give capable Mages a stage to make a name for themselves. The contest became even more important after the crisis along the coastline arose. The Mages that came out on top in the contest would most likely be appointed to an important position in Feiniao City.

Feiniao City was considered a new and developing city compared to other headquarters cities. The city had gone from a tier-three city to an important keep, port, and fortress on the southeast ocean. It obviously needed a lot of fresh bodies.

Mu Ningxue was invited to be the judge for the finals of the contest, since Fanxue City was included in the northern district of Feiniao City. She could not find any excuse to turn it down since it was the finals, and Feiniao City had sincerely invited her to be the judge.

The term ‘young adult’ was quite ambiguous.

The World College Tournament was very straightforward. The participants had to be students, and those who purposely did not want to graduate were not allowed to take part, either.

Meanwhile, the Young Adults Contest was open to anyone below the age of forty!

“Didn’t Fanxue Mountain send any representatives to take part in the contest? Many reputable people and organizations will be taking root in Feiniao City soon. If your Fanxue Mountain doesn’t get an impressive result in such an influential contest, it might be difficult for you to have any say in some important meetings in the future,” Li Kuang of the Dali Clan, who had also been invited as a judge, spoke mockingly to Mu Ningxue.

The Dali Clan and Fanxue Mountain were known rivals in Feiniao City.

Feiniao City was developing quickly, and the two factions had suddenly gotten a lot of attention in the country. Fanxue Mountain had secured the best location in the northern district as the port and the traffic hub, not to mention the ore veins nearby. Many renowned clans, even the government and Magic Association, were envious of it. It was not Mu Ningxue’s first time being picked on by multiple organizations while she was constructing Fanxue City. However, she managed to help Fanxue Mountain secure a foothold even as everyone was trying to trip her up. She had joined hands with the Dongfang Clan in Hangzhou and the Mui Clan in the Magic City to finally stand out and rise as a faction.

On the other hand, the Dali Clan was a subsidiary clan under the Mu Clan. The Mu Clan had dominated the country and secured the leading position among the renowned clans. They obviously would not give up on a prosperous area like Feiniao City. Their main influence was in the capital, thus Feiniao City was beyond their reach. Therefore, they were giving great support to the Dali Clan that was based in Feiniao City.

They wanted the Dali Clan to get rid of Fanxue Mountain and take over Fanxue City. Unfortunately, Fanxue Mountain was no longer the little faction it used to be. Fanxue Mountain’s vote was as powerful as a Councilman’s during the meetings held by Feiniao City!

The people of the Dali Clan had secured three spots among the top ten participants in the contest, but not a single person from Fanxue Mountain had made it to the top ten. The people in Feiniao City were already discussing it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The rounds before the top ten haven’t ended yet,” Mu Ningxue said calmly.

“I believe it’s only possible if you, the master of Fanxue Mountain, were participating in the contest. Otherwise, it’s unlikely that anyone from Fanxue Mountain is going to secure a spot in the top ten. You have to do everything on your own, despite being the leader. You’re no different from those ignorant leaders of small factions. A person’s capabilities are limited. You won’t be able to do everything on your own.” Li Kuang smiled like he was having a casual chat with Mu Ningxue, but they were already giving one another tit for tat!
