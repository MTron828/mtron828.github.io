“I thought you were going to sacrifice yourself again,” Tangyue’s voice, with a weird tone to it, came into Mo Fan’s ears.

Mo Fan purposely stood on his toes at the edge of a cliff. A strong wind was blowing past his ears. Before his feet was a deep abyss shrouded by a white mist.

“Hello, hello, yeah, I’ve eaten, the food here is pretty light, the old taoist told me to abstain from eating meat, but I normally go hunting in the mountains. The mountain beasts are absolutely delicious. Pure natural and pollution-free...” responded Mo Fan in a loud voice.

After testing various cliffs and almost fall off the edge a couple of times, Mo Fan found out that this peak had the best reception across all of the entire Mount Hua.

“Who asked you about food, I’m being serious, you should stay away from those maniacs from the Black Vatican. I’m worried that you’ll be gone all of a sudden,” said Tangyue.

“What? My cultivation? It will soon recover, I’m still in the Advanced Level. Not only did I manage to restore the Nebulas of other Elements, they are now all in the third-tier too. This place is perfect for cultivation. I almost fell in love with it. The only downside is there isn’t any taoist nuns around. Oh, I didn’t even find a female monkey. Miss Tangyue, why don’t you come and spend a few days here with me? Spending too much time in the city full of concrete isn’t good for your health. You should come here to stand close to nature...” It had been a while since Mo Fan last conversed with someone. He kept on talking into the phone.

Tangyue’s forehead was covered in black lines.

She knew the signal in the mountain was bad, but it should not be this bad.

“Oh, I’ve got something to tell you,” said Tangyue sternly.

“Yeah, go on, I can hear you clearly!”

“Do you remember how the big guy showed up in the city?” said Tangyue.

The big guy that Tangyue mentioned was referring to the Black Totem Snake. He was now treated as Hangzhou’s precious possession, attracting lots of tourists to the West Lake. They were not hoping they could see the real Black Totem Snake. They were satisfied enough listening to the tales, enjoying the scenery and watching the giant shadow under the West Lake!

“I do, I almost wet my pants!” Mo Fan managed to hear the sentence clearly.

Mo Fan remembered that he was enjoying a date with Xinxia at the time. He even booked a romantic room for the night through his phone under the table. However, the Black Totem Snake’s sudden appearance between two skyscrapers completely destroyed his plan.

Either way, the Black Totem Snake owed him a hotel room!

“Initially, I thought he only showed up there because of his unstable emotion during the ecdysis. However, the big guy has woken up recently, so I’ve asked him about it,” said Tangyue.

Mo Fan remembered it now. The Black Totem Snake was staring right at the building he was in. More accurately, the snake was staring at his floor, right at him!

The Black Totem Snake only showed himself when he had a dangerous feeling, and for a creature like the Black Totem Snake, not many things were able to make him feel threatened. Mo Fan still did not understand what exactly was in the building that had caught his attention!

“Is it because of the Demon Element in my blood?” asked Mo Fan.

Tangyue and her people were aware of the Demon Element. The Enforcement Union in Hangzhou was his ally. With Tang Zhong in power, they would surely keep it a secret for his sake.

“I thought so too, but it’s obviously not the reason. He told me that someone behind you was making him uneasy. However, he quickly disappeared when he found out that the person was not as dangerous as he thought,” said Tangyue.

“Behind me?” Mo Fan was even more confused.

“Think carefully, do you remember who’s behind you? Big guy says the person was very close to you,” said Tangyue.

“Behind me...at that time...” Mo Fan paused in the middle of his sentence. His face was filled with disbelief.

Soon after, he quickly shook his head.

Impossible, that’s not possible!

The person behind him was Xinxia! Why would she possess an aura that even the Black Totem Snake felt threatened by?

“Think about it, I’m just reminding you,” said Tangyue.

“Mm, I got it,” Mo Fan nodded.

Hanging up the call, the smile on Mo Fan’s face disappeared.

The Black Totem Snake would not lie to them, which meant that he had only shown up because of the person behind him, and Xinxia was the only one behind him!

Why would Xinxia make the Black Totem Snake feel uneasy?

“Hey, old Taoist, I’m heading down the mountain,” said Mo Fan in a serious tone.

“Are you sure you don’t want to spend more time cultivating here? Most of the people have asked to stay longer here,” replied an old man in a taoist outfit. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’m reaching the bottleneck, it’s meaningless to cultivate here any further.”

“Mm, you’re right, go on an adventure, it’s a vast world full of wonders. The path of cultivation needs you to go experience and widen your vision...”

“See you again!”

“I wonder; the next time you come, I might have passed away!” said the old man.

“What’s up with that... should I introduce you to a chick?”

Cough, cough ! “I’m a monk...”

“You’re a Taoist!”

“It’s the same as a monk, it’s not my interest, not my interest,” said the old man with an awkward face.

“Hypocrite, but I have to say, you’re quite an interesting old man. You remind me of the old man behind my school in the past. Such a pity, he has already left the world. I’m sure that you two would be good friends if I introduced him to you... forget it, maybe you two will report in to the same King of Hell after you’re dead, time to leave!” Mo Fan smiled.

The old man watched Mo Fan leave with a smile.

As Mo Fan disappeared into the distance, the old man mumbled to himself, “Old friend, you’ve chosen a very interesting young man...”

——

The sky was a clear blue with flickers of blinding sunlight. Below was a giant cotton candy field spreading across like a white land. It felt like it was possible to run on it.

Mo Fan had chosen a seat close to the window on his flight. The scenery outside the window was breathtaking. He could see vague figures soaring into the sky between the clouds and the blue sky. Maybe some beasts were trying to break their record of the highest altitude they could reach!

“Passengers on board, we’ll be landing at Hangzhou International Airport in fifteen minutes. Please put on your seatbelt and...”

The announcement sounded in the plane. Mo Fan could now see the silhouettes of the city under the clouds. From his height, both the skyscrapers and the highways were like models scattered densely on a tabletop drawing...

Mo Fan got off the plane and was about to call the number in his mind when his phone began beeping non-stop with messages containing the scoldings and roars of the authorities, ordering Mo Fan to report in at the national palace!
