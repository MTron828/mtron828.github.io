It had all happened so quick. Everyone was taken by surprise.

Who would have thought that the undead that would only appear at night would ambush them in the day, and seemed extremely keen to murder them.

After Mo Fan finally managed to get the situation under control, half of the villagers had died.

Mo Fan had started killing the zombies as soon as the ambush took place. If the villagers had not run in all directions and stayed together, the only casualties would have been the ones that were attacked first. Mo Fan could simply blast most of the zombies coming out from the ground with a single Spell.

Unfortunately, despite warning the villagers not to panic when anything happened, they had totally forgotten about it. Their instinct to run simply lead them to dead ends.

Zhang Xiaohou’s Rock Barrier was fairly effective. He had somehow set up a wall surrounding the group in a circle. The villagers would be safe as long as they stayed inside the circle, as the undead would have to climb a wall that was around seven to eight meters high! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The chief and Shorty stood on top of the wall to prevent the undead from making it to the top. The zombies’ jumping ability was only average, but their claws were very sharp, allowing them to climb the wall quickly. The two were responsible for killing the zombies that were climbing the wall.

Zhang Xiaohou was inside the circle. Apart from maintaining the Rock Barrier, he was also keeping an eye out for any zombie trying to enter the circle.

Mo Fan and Liu Ru were outside of the wall. Several villagers were still running wildly in the open. They were trying to save them.

Not far away, Liu Ru was lifting the villager called Gouzi up as if she were picking up a little chick. The villager did seem like he was given quite a nice name, since dogs were tough to kill. A few other zombies were chasing after another middle-aged villager, yet none of them seemed to be interested with that guy after Liu Ru came to rescue him.

{TL Note: The name ‘Gouzi’ here means dog.}

“Help...help me!” a young kid screamed. His legs were torn apart by a zombie. The deep wound had reached his bones.

Grabbing Gouzi with a hand, Liu Ru leapt forward and glided in the air before landing right before the kid.

Liu Ru let go of Gouzi. She clenched her hands into claws and swept sideways. Ten crimson flickers like blood-colored slickers slashed at the three zombies that were running toward them.

The three zombies were slashed into several sections by the blood-colored sickles. Their bodies stiffened and fell beside Liu Ru.

“Kid, stay behind me,” Liu Ru helped the kid to his feet.

At that instant, Gouzi glanced at the young man and immediately had a weird expression.

He pointed his trembling finger at the kid who Liu Ru was helping and yelled, “He...he’s not from our village!”

However, it was too late when Gouzi screamed. As soon as Liu Ru went over to help the kid, an eerie grin appeared on his pale face. He reached the hand he was hiding with his body forward, which only had white bones left...

The hand with only white bones was sharp as a dagger, stabbing fiercely at Liu Ru’s heart!

An icy flicker flashed across the air. Liu Ru was so close to the young kid. There was no way she could react in time. The kid’s hand went right into Liu Ru’s chest through her heart.

Liu Ru’s face was filled with disbelief.

She did not expect the kid to be an undead too, and one that possessed such a vicious mind!

The kid was a different kind of undead compared to the zombies.

“That’s what you get for being a busybody, now die,” the undead kid burst out laughing. He pulled his hand out from Liu Ru’s chest and was about to enjoy her fresh blood...

However, as he withdrew the hand toward him, he was shocked to discover that the hand did not have a single drop of blood on it.

The kid was stunned. He could not understand; why was there no sign of blood on his hand after he had stabbed the woman’s heart with it/ He was not moving his hand that quickly.

“Knowing how to trick someone at your age, with such a vicious manner,” Liu Ru stared at the undead kid without showing any sign of pain. Her eyes were displaying a hint of disappointment instead.

“How...how is this possible!” the undead kid screamed as if he had just seen a ghost.

“Sister will now send you to reincarnation. Stop trying to hurt people,” Liu Ru smiled, completely displaying the natural charm of the Blood Tribe.

The stab into Liu Ru’s heart did not hinder her movement. She simply grabbed the undead kid by his throat and suddenly applied great force.

The undead kid was still experiencing great fear when his neck was snapped by Liu Ru. His head slanted sideways with the same terrified expression...

Liu Ru’s smile did not disappear when she glanced at the undead kid who died after his neck was snapped.

“Stop teasing me; I’ve never seen an undead that would die after breaking their neck...” Liu Ru’s eyes curved into crescents when she saw the undead kid pretending to be dead.

Saying this, Liu Ru slowly moved her hand to the undead kid’s skull, as if she were going to fondle his head gently.

“No, no!” the undead kid pleaded horrifyingly when he realized Liu Ru’s intention.

Liu Ru did not show any mercy. Her index finger turned into a long claw, which extended and penetrated the undead kid’s head from above...

The undead had something like a crystal that allowed them to move, similar to a human’s heart. As long as the crystal was not destroyed, the undead would not die...

Liu Ru soon discovered the Undead Crystal in the undead kid’s brain. She simply crushed the crystal with her claw and sent the living dead to the underworld!

The crystal was pierced by the claw, leaving the undead kid crying in agony.

Black gas immediately came out from the holes on his face, as if it had drawn all the energy from his body. The undead kid turned into a dried corpse within a few seconds.

After confirming that the undead kid was dead, Liu Ru rose to her feet and fell into deep thought.

She did not understand. The undead she had encountered before were all zombies and skeletons. Why would a living dead appear out of nowhere...

“Follow me, don’t run away on your own,” Liu Ru said to Gouzi, who was standing behind him.

Gouzi stood in his place. He did not dare to move a step, as if he was completely frozen.

Just a moment ago, he thought he was safe, yet the woman... the woman...

What did she mean she had never seen an undead that died after she had broken their neck...

Her heart was punctured just then!

Gouzi simply felt like he was going to have a mental breakdown. It was one new nightmare after another!
