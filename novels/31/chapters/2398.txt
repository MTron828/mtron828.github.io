Lingling’s speculation was bold, but fairly reasonable. Otherwise, why had the job letter only appeared after so many years?

If Senior Hunter Leng had opened the job to every Hunter in the world, the job would still be available in the Hunter Union, and would have become a high-ranking job.

The only problem was, if the first Red Demon Kazuaki was indeed their client, why did he want them to kill Lu Kun?

Mo Fan recalled Lu Kun’s strange behavior after he learned the contents of the job letter.

Now that he thought about it, the Red Demon had acted a little crazy after it found out it was betrayed by its superior.

“Why did the first Red Demon Kazuaki want to kill Lu Kun?” Mo Fan could not figure out the answer.

Lingling was also thinking the same question. “I can’t think of an explanation right now. Perhaps Lu Kun has been doing things too recklessly, and might have exposed the first Red Demon’s secrets?” Lingling rubbed her temples.

If she could not find a valid explanation, her speculation would be flawed. She would have to visit the Hunter Union to find out more about the job.

Perhaps the job letter was delayed because of some other reason?

“Eight evil gods are worshiped in the Temple of Evils,” a pleasing voice suddenly spoke up.

Apas’ alluring figure walked out of a silver Rift and stretched out like she had just finished taking a nap.

“Did your hibernation finally end?” Mo Fan rolled his eyes.

“I don’t hibernate, I just sleep a little longer sometimes,” Apas replied with an innocent smile, like she was in a great mood.

“What were you saying, you snake?” Lingling interrupted them.

Apas stuck her face closer to Lingling and noticed her new hairstyle. She burst out laughing.

“Lingling, a middle-part hairstyle might make you more feminine, but it doesn’t fix the problem of your bust size,” Apas mocked her in return.

“Alright, that’s enough. You shouldn’t be arguing as soon as you see one another. Apas, what do you know?” Mo Fan intervened.

“I wasn’t too sure before, but I was convinced after the Red Demon killed the little Red Demon.” Apas was aware of the existence of the Red Demons now.

Apas did not show Lingling any respect. She deftly snatched up a pen and a notebook from Lingling’s bag.

She drew eight evil temples on a blank page in the notebook, each occupied by a special soul. She quickly wrote the name ‘Kazuaki’ on one of the temples.

She then wrote the name ‘Senior Hunter Leng’ on another temple.

“What does this mean?” Mo Fan and Lingling were confused. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You two have underestimated the Red Demons, especially the first Red Demon!” Apas drew a question mark on the rest of the temples.

“Don’t keep pausing, just tell us already,” Lingling said.

“The first Red Demon is collecting these eight souls, with Kazuaki as the host.”

“Kazuaki represents the Soul of Justice. Senior Hunter Leng is the Soul of Righteousness.”

Apas wrote the titles ‘Soul of Justice’ and ‘Soul of Righteousness’ on the roofs of Kazuaki and Senior Hunter Leng’s temples.

Mo Fan and Lingling exchanged glances.

Lingling began to recall something. She said, “I read something similar in grandfather’s room, but it wasn’t as detailed as what she’s saying.”

“How is this related to the reason why Kazuaki wanted Lu Kun dead?” Mo Fan asked, totally blank.

“Normally, souls of the dead linger in this world because they still have some wishes that are unfulfilled. They are unwilling to leave until they see the outcome. It’s the same for Senior Hunter Leng. His character represents righteousness, but he died at the hands of evil. He is qualified to be a Soul Frame in the Temple of Evils,” Apas told him.

Mo Fan still did not understand.

Apas rolled her eyes and explained in a simpler way, “Fine, think of it this way. You are right that the first Red Demon Kazuaki is the client of the job. He gave you the job letter so you would kill Lu Kun for him.

“The reason is very simple. The first Red Demon is collecting the eight Soul Frames of the Temple of Evils. Each Soul Frame represents a unique trait of this world. They consist of the four Souls of the Good: the Soul of Justice, the Soul of Righteousness, the Soul of Loyalty, and the Soul of Resolute. They also include the four Souls of the Evil: the Soul of Violence, the Soul of Greed, the Soul of Jealousy, and the Soul of Hatred.”

“Kazuaki is the Soul of Justice. Senior Hunter Leng is the Soul of Righteousness.

“These souls all have unfulfilled wishes that tie them to the world. Only when they are freed from their ties will they be able to enter the Temple of Evils and be upgraded into Soul Frames.

“The way to free them from their ties is very simple too: by fulfilling their last wishes. Senior Hunter Leng’s last wish was to complete his job and kill the Red Demon!

“There’s no way Kazuaki was going to kill himself to fulfill Senior Hunter Leng’s wish, so he took out the job letter and hired you to kill Lu Kun. Lu Kun is also a Red Demon, albeit a little one, but it is enough to fulfill Senior Hunter Leng’s final wish. Once Senior Hunter Leng’s final wish is fulfilled, he will be upgraded to a Soul Frame in the Temple of Evils.

“These Soul Frames are what the Red Demon is after!”

Apas did not really explain it in a simpler way, but Mo Fan was able to understand some of it.

“Does that mean Mochizuki Ken is here because his job is to fulfill Kazuaki’s final wish?” Mo Fan asked hesitantly.

“Mm, I believe you can guess what Kazuaki’s final wish was, too, or perhaps Kazuaki has already fulfilled his final wish. The Red Demon just needs some confirmation. After all, Kazuaki is the Red Demon’s host!” Apas said.

“What about the other Soul Frames?” Mo Fan had to ask.

It basically proved everything Lu Kun said prior to his death was real. They were all working for the first Red Demon, Kazuaki!

Anzark’s speculation was on point, too. The whole thing was a big operation, with every Hunter handling a small branch of the operation. They were not allowed to communicate with one another to ensure the confidentiality of the operation.

“Do you remember the girl called Yuria from the Alps Institute? The girl whose grave was dug up and whose soul went missing?” Apas prodded him.

Mo Fan was stunned. He had even asked the Queen of the Netherworld about it, but she reacted strangely and warned Mo Fan not to investigate the matter any further.

Did the Queen of the Netherworld already sense that the one who stole Yuria’s soul was the first Red Demon?

“Yuria represents the Soul of Loyalty. She was loyal to the Alps Institute, but she was executed because of it.. Her blood tainted the flowers, but the flowers did not blossom, so she allowed herself to bleed to death in order to prove her loyalty.”
