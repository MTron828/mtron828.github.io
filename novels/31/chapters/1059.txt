“Brother Mo Fan, take me somewhere higher,” Xinxia said.

“Aye!” Mo Fan lifted Xinxia, together with her wheelchair and headed to the top of a signal tower constructed recently.

“What I said before was pure speculation; if it doesn’t work, we’ll have to leave right away,” Lingling reminded Mo Fan and Xinxia.

Mo Fan nodded without saying a word.

—

Up on the signal tower, they could easily see how the quarantine zone had turned into a landfill where people were gathering at the boundary of the magic barrier and slamming into it violently.

It was unclear where the people had gotten their strength from. Usually, the magic formation could easily hold out against normal people, regardless of their numbers. However, these patients seemed to possess some kind of evil power that granted them greater strength!

Xinxia bit her lips upon seeing this.

“Let’s begin, I’ll be holding the orb,” Mo Fan said.

Xinxia nodded. She crossed her hands in front of her chest, as if she were trying to unleash the power deep within her soul.

The Spirit Ripple was untraceable. Mo Fan only felt a pleasant tone ringing inside his mind like a flute, yet he could not detect anything when he focused.

Mo Fan knew Xinxia’s Spirit Ripple was spreading across the city, and was patting the minds of the patients like a pair of gentle hands.

Xinxia frowned. As she was pacifying the patients, she too was influenced by their negative emotions. Xinxia could clearly sense the anger and hatred deep within their hearts.

They were being tortured by the disease, and yet the government was helpless, and the world organization was reluctant to lend them a hand. It was as if they had been abandoned by the world, waiting for their deaths in the quarantine zone!

As she listened to the thoughts of the patients, she began to recall some faint memories in her mind.

Abandoned...

Her mother had abandoned her, just like the people who abandoned her in Bo City amid the calamity...

A strange sadness and anger rose inside Xinxia’s heart. How could people be so merciless? She had always treated them sincerely and with utter kindness, and yet, why did Gulan try to place the blame on her? It was her that was bold enough to come to save the people!

Xinxia wanted to open her eyes, but she realized that she was unable to wake up, surrounded by darkness, and an icy aura... it felt like... a fridge, the fridge in the supermarket that she hid inside in order to stay alive...

“Xinxia!”

She heard a voice all of a sudden. It sounded so familiar.

“Xinxia, Xinxia!”

Mo Fan shook Xinxia softly. For some reason, Mo Fan could feel Xinxia being infected by the evil presence, it was trying to remind her of her painful, infuriating past!

“Quick, transfer the energy to me, stop letting the evil energy influence you, do you understand!?” Mo Fan held her trembling hands tightly as he spoke in a serious voice.

Xinxia could not wake up, yet she saw someone shoving the door of the fridge open and carrying her out of it. She could feel Mo Fan warm hands on her hands and shoulders...

“Did I let the thing influence me, too?” Xinxia slowly calmed down. She recalled how Mo Fan had always protected her, not allowing her to suffer even the slightest. Her heart that was initially like a rolling black tide immediately calmed down, and the black water started to clear up too. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xinxia finally opened her eyes. They were pure and clean, and were so pretty that Mo Fan could not move his eyes away from them.

She looked at Mo Fan with a hint of relief.

Once she gathered her thoughts, the evil power could no longer influence her!

Her faltering expression was replaced by a firm look. Her thoughts transformed into a greater tide, driving the evil presence into the Essence Orb on Mo Fan’s hand!

The chime of the Spiritual Bonsho echoed throughout the quarantine zone. The people could not hear it, but their hearts reacted to it. Holy chants in Sanskrit echoed in their minds, pacifying them.

{TL Note: A bonsho is a large bell found in Buddhist temples.}

The patients fell to the ground, starting with those that had gathered at the boundary of the magic barrier. As the spiritual disease was cleansed, they all fell into a deep sleep. The evil driving them was actually overdrawing their energy, so they were immediately overwhelmed by fatigue as soon as it vanished!

“What’s going on? Is she hypnotizing the people?” The commander raised his head and glanced at the Candidate on the signal tower.

“That’s not hypnotizing, it’s extremely difficult to hypnotize someone with strong emotions, she’s healing them, with her heart...” the general without a badge deduced.

An official hurriedly came up and said to Commander Darrel, “Commander, the patients that fainted no longer have the marks on them. It seems like they have been cured!”.

“Are you sure!?” Commander Darrel’s composure cracked. He stared at the woman sitting on a wheelchair up on the signal tower in disbelief.

“How...how did she do it?” Gulan was dumbfounded too. Even a Muse would struggle to resolve the plague, how did a mere Servant who had just been promoted do it?

“It seems like there’s a reason why she’s selected as a Candidate,” the general without a badge observed.

More patients fell to the ground. Some Healers had entered the magic barrier boldly. After a brief inspection, they determined that the patients’ lives were no longer endangered. They were just weak and feeble physically.

The marks on them had vanished. It was easily the best finding for everyone, as it implied that the woman from the Parthenon Temple standing on the signal tower had actually found a cure to resolve the disastrous plague!

——

The patients were lying still across the spacious camp, filling up the space.

The plague was eventually cleansed. The patients were wearing calm, relaxed expressions. They had all fallen asleep under the cleansing melody Xinxia had performed for them!

“Are you sure they are all fine?”

“Yeah, they only fell asleep, meaning that they will wake up eventually. Commander, the plague is gone; this is unbelievable!”

“We’ve conducted experiments on the disease for many days, yet we could not find any cure to it. As expected of the Parthenon Temple, it’s indeed the Sacred Hall of the Healing Magic!” the old Healers exclaimed.

Zhang Xiaohou looked at Lingling excitedly and said, “Awesome, you’re so impressive, you really found a cure to the plague!”

“Sister Xinxia has been communicating with me using Psychic Voice. I simply organized the information and come up with the idea. I believe if any other Healer took her place, we wouldn’t be able to resolve the plague,” Lingling replied.

It was quite fortunate that Xinxia was also a Psychic Mage, and her mental strength had greatly surpassed Lingling’s imagination!

Not every Psychic Mage could transfer someone’s hatred to somewhere else, as the hatred would easily penetrate the caster. Only those with a firm, pure heart were able to use the method!

“HAHA, as I thought, there’s nothing the few of us can’t resolve!” Zhang Xiaohou burst out laughing.

However, Zhang Xiaohou soon realized that something did not feel right. A while later, he finally recalled that he was supposed to come here on vacation!

——

Up on the signal tower, Mo Fan could easily tell how worn out Xinxia was. She was so weak that she could not speak properly. She could only look at him with her beautiful eyes.

Mo Fan felt extremely sorry for her. Due to the number of patients, it was a huge operation just to transfer the evil energy in them to somewhere else. Xinxia had basically expended all her energy.

“Brother Mo Fan, the...the orb...” Xinxia said in a weak voice.

“Don’t worry, it’s not my first time dealing with the orb. The evil presence is even stronger when I first discovered it, but it still can’t do any harm to me,” Mo Fan wrapped the Evil Essence Orb with a piece of silver paper. Mo Fan had asked Zhang Xiaohou to prepare some, as it was able to prevent the energy inside the orb from leaking out.

“That...that’s a relief,” Xinxia leaned back against the wheelchair. She could no longer hold herself upright.

Mo Fan carried her away, and let the local commander handle the rest. Xinxia desperately needed some rest.

Any Healing Spell was useless for people that had overdrawn their energy. The patients would surely be asleep for quite some time, and Xinxia, who had saved their lives, would be asleep even longer.

After finding Xinxia a place to rest, Mo Fan was deeply moved as he studied her pale face.

Mo Fan had only now realized that Xinxia was just like him, Zhang Xiaohou, and the others. She had dug out something deep within her heart during the Calamity of Bo City, something that she would try her best to fulfill!

——

“Mm? The evil presence is weakening?” Mo Fan inspected the Essence Orb as he was taking care of Xinxia. He was surprised to see the evil aura growing weaker.

Mo Fan was utterly confused. He observed it carefully and discovered that the energy inside the Essence Orb had suddenly expanded. It had almost filled up the entire orb!

Mo Fan was overjoyed. Once the Essence Orb was filled up, it meant he could use the power of the Demon Element!

“Could it be that Old Bao has also inserted a filter in the orb when he modified it, so it’s able to filter any harmful energy, and transform it into energy to fill up the orb?” Mo Fan exclaimed excitedly.

The evil presence was still weakening. Mo Fan believed he could no longer call it the Essence Orb, but the strongest trump card he was currently holding, the Demon Orb!

He did not expect he would obtain such incredible benefits when he first offered to come with Xinxia to help the people!
