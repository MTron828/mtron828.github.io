Translated by XephiZ

“The first Medusa was a Maga with the Curse Element. You must be closely related to her since you look like a human, right?” Mo Fan prodded.

Apas remained silent.

“Does the army of snakes and scorpions take orders from you? You can Summon them to lend me a hand if I’m in any kind of trouble, right?” Mo Fan asked further.

“In your dreams!” Apas’ chest heaved angrily.

“Who were you talking to just now?” Mo Fan inquired.

“Just an attendant in the hotel,” Apas said.

“Tsk tsk, you still dare to lie to me? Don’t forget that our souls are bound by the Contract. I know everything you are up to,” Mo Fan said.

“It was Ethan,” Apas admitted sharply.

“What’s the secret between you and him?” Mo Fan pressed her.

“I always come to the city for fun. He makes the necessary arrangements,” Apas said.

“He even kidnapped innocent girls to fawn upon you. How disgusting are you? Not only did you eat them alive, you even stole their appearance! I’m a little obsessed with the cleanliness of the soul. I can’t believe I accepted you as my Contracted Beast!” Mo Fan said.

“Assh***, do you think I wanted to sign the Contract with you!?” Apas was poked right on her most tender spot. She almost jumped up and fought Mo Fan to death, but her rationality told her that she would just be hurting herself if she tried to harm him. She had no choice but to withhold the urge and continue, her eyes burning with rage, “A real Medusa doesn’t have to eat young girls to keep their youth and beauty. Only the Medusae with the lineage of the Red Scorpion Gorgon feast on young girls. Don’t you dare compare me with those lowly Medusae!”

“I’ve asked someone to verify it. Major General Gangma did kidnap many young girls, so stop pretending like you’re innocent here. Tell me the truth right now!” Mo Fan ordered.

“They were doing it to fawn on my servants. What do I have to do with it?” Apas scoffed.

“Humph, you are their master, so you are just as vicious as your servants!” Mo Fan rebutted.

“How amusing! My servants only need to feed on young girls once every season. If Gangma did bring them girls based on their needs, there’s no way you would have noticed them missing!” Apas said.

“The numbers of missing girls I know of are clearly greater than you have claimed!” Mo Fan snarled.

“Then why don’t you find out who’s really eating them?” Apas mocked him back.

Mo Fan was startled. He could easily tell Apas was telling him the truth with the Contract.

If the young Medusa he tore apart was Apas’ servant, and even if she had quite a number of them, why would the numbers of missing girls reach a hundred every season?

Did Gangma eat them all instead? Mo Fan’s heart skipped a beat.

The Medusae did eat the girls, but the girls they fed upon were a lot less than the girls Gangma had eaten!

“You accuse us of being vicious, but you humans are the most vicious instead!” Apas said.

“This...” Mo Fan was lost for words.

“Ethan is on the rooftop. If you really care about what happened to the girls he kidnapped, feel free to ask him in person,” Apas smiled at him.

—

Mo Fan went to the rooftop and saw Ethan standing by the pool. He had put on a little disguise so people would not recognize him.

“It’s you!” Ethan was enraged when he saw Mo Fan.

“You claimed that you were sacrificing those innocent girls to save more lives, but can you tell me why so many of them went missing when the Medusae only needed to feed on a few of them every season!?” Mo Fan asked coldly.

“You’re ridiculous, what do I have anything to do with the missing girls? I’ve never done anything like it. It was all Gangma!” Ethan said.

“Your heartless men were murdering innocent people while abusing your reputation, yet you did nothing to stop them!” Mo Fan cursed him right back.

“He’s responsible for what he did himself. I knew he had a fetish for toying with little girls. I also knew that he was using the little girls to pander to the authorities in the military and the government. He deserved to go to Hell, but it wasn’t my job to condemn him. I’m a general, my job is to keep the city safe!” Ethan replied disdainfully.

Mo Fan’s heart turned cold after hearing those words.

It turned out that the most vicious snakes and scorpions were nowhere as terrifying as humans driven by their own desires.

Mo Fan realized he had gone too easy on Gangma. He should have drawn his soul out and tortured him first!

“Stop being so naive and thinking you can be the good guy. If you go and look for the missing girls, you have no idea how many authorities you’re going to offend as a result. Gangma made friends with people that shared the same fetish as him, and most of them have formidable statuses and backgrounds if he catered to them. Do you think you can punish them all?” Ethan went on.

“I’m going to punish you first! You knew what kind of assh*** your subordinate was, yet you kept letting him be!” Mo Fan grunted.

“HAHA, do you really think you’re a savior because you’ve opened the entrance of the Underworld, and let the two kingdoms of undead fight one another? The crisis that humans are facing is greater than you could ever imagine! They are ten, even a hundred times scarier than what we are facing now!

“People are going to die and be born continuously. Cities will fall and rise. You might have prevented a disaster from happening, but the casualties during the next calamity will easily outnumber the number of lives you’ve saved. It’s going to have the same outcome. Humans are still going to live like cowards in the safe zones while the wilds are full of demon creatures...

“There’s one thing that won’t change: the status of the upper class! They are the only ones worthy to be called humans. If we lose the war, who do you think is going to make it out alive? The authorities have already planned their escape. Only idiots believe in the government’s lies, and if they don’t, there is nothing they can do but go onto the streets in some meaningless protests and vent their frustrations!”

Ethan never hesitated to share his beliefs. Mo Fan’s expression sank after hearing his words. His temperature had dropped significantly!

“Besides, do you really think people are all kind and innocent? The people in the upper class are from the middle and lower classes, too! The truth is, those so-called kind people might even do something crueler and worse than Gangma did if they were given the power! Human society is built on the basis of killing one another. How many humans do you think the demon creatures can eat?

“You do have the option to punish every authority figure involved, but I can assure you, those people are holding important positions. Killing one of them might even put a town or a city in danger, and the number of casualties when something like that happens in times of war will easily surpass a hundred young girls!”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
