Tuis did not think what he said was inappropriate.

Nobles learned etiquette starting at the age of three. Every smile, gesture, and step had strict requirements, so they would emit a different demeanor from others!

Everyone knew Xinxia was from China, and from a family of the lowest level in the social hierarchy. The Parthenon Temple was not concerned about a person’s background or nationality. They would take anyone as their Goddess if they were chosen by the Soul of the Parthenon Temple. Therefore, the Parthenon Temple had never cared about Ye Xinxia’s background and nationality.

However, Tuis thought she was too arrogant, even discussing etiquette and customs with a clan that had existed for over a thousand years around the Mediterranean Sea!

Without their support, even Izisha would struggle to retain her role as the Goddess. How dare a mere Saintess who was picked up halfway act so arrogantly in front of him?

Luckily, the banquet was only an internal event, and there were not many outsiders. Otherwise, this would definitely have a bad influence on them.

“Mister Tuis, in China, even the poorest family will teach their boys not to offend, bully, or do evil. They will also teach their girls to be self-loving, polite, and respectful. I do like the etiquette in European countries, and the people are passionate, friendly, and carefree. But I will stick to the traditions and customs which my family taught me, so I ask you to respect my culture too,” Xinxia remained calm for the first half of her words, but her tone hardened in the second half.

A person who did not respect others’ culture and tried to apply their ideas forcibly on others was already a great offense. Xinxia did not mind telling him if he did not realize that. If he persisted with this behavior, he would only demean himself!

Tuis might be Izisha’s enemy, but Xinxia had only attended the banquet as a friendly gesture. It did not mean she was asking him for a favor. Even if they were on the same side, Xinxia had the right to decide who she danced with. The rules of etiquette for the Saintesses forbade her from dismissing people rudely, or she would already have asked Tuis to piss off after he mocked her family!

The belief that men and women should not have intimate contact casually might be a very old tradition, but there were many girls who retained the old beliefs, despite being in a society that was now heavily influenced by ideas from across the world. The people who had abandoned the old beliefs in pursue of free will were not condemned, but it did not mean that others were not allowed to follow the ideas they believed in!

It was more important for people to respect one another without mocking their beliefs!

“Mister Tuis, the Saintess has her own customs from her country, so please don’t force her to dance with you. She was not being biased toward you.” Tata quickly intervened once she realized the tense atmosphere between them.

“I wasn’t biased toward Mister Tuis before, but I am now,” Xinxia added sternly.

“What do you mean by that?” Tuis was startled.

Before Xinxia could answer, Mo Fan had already walked up to her. He raised his thumb at Xinxia and said, “It means she’s asking you to piss off. Do you understand now?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Tata, Haylon, and the Great Priests’ faces darkened like they had been smeared with dirt when they saw Mo Fan. As they expected, Mo Fan had ignited the whole banquet with a single sentence. Everyone, including Tuis, had contorted faces, as if they had just eaten dung!

“HAHAHA, asking me to piss off? I’m afraid no one in the world dares to talk to me like that!” Tuis burst out laughing.

“Listen carefully, my name is Mo Fan. I’m from the simple family that you just mentioned. My sister Xinxia isn’t wrong. Our father taught his son not to offend people, bully the weak, and do evil, but when it comes to someone like you, even though we aren’t really told what to do, I think it was along the lines of ‘don’t beat him up too badly, so he can still walk away himself!‘” Mo Fan made sure he was being extremely clear.

Tata rolled her eyes after hearing those words, and almost fainted.

Even if they were not planning to fawn on the Tuis, they should avoid becoming enemies with them!

Tata was thinking of sending for someone to get rid of Mo Fan, but Xinxia glared at her and stopped that thought.

“Your Honor, this is going to be a huge problem at this rate. The Hall Mother will be very angry at you,” Tata whispered.

“Tata, if the Hall Mother only wants me to be a Goddess who is willing to abandon her principles for the sake of people’s support, I’m afraid I’m not a suitable Candidate for her. I’m competing for the role of the Goddess because I want to become the Goddess that blesses the world, not the Goddess who tries to win over everyone’s hearts as you and the Hall Mother prefer,” Xinxia replied sternly.

“Well said!” Asha’ruiya agreed with a smile.

While Xinxia was clarifying her stance, the atmosphere between Mo Fan and Tuis had intensified further. The air around them was even colder.

“Mo Fan? So you’re the guy who claimed to be the strongest Mage in the world?” Tuis grinned.

“I see the news has been spreading quickly, as even an assh*** in the deep mountains like you has heard it! For some reason, I found you disgusting when I first saw you on the street. I thought I was only being envious of you, yet I realize it was the Jerk Scanner in me doing its work. It accurately locked onto you!” Mo Fan condescended to reply.

“It sounds like you two brother and sister have brought your savage ways to the Parthenon Temple. No wonder I noticed a weird smell when I came here. I kept feeling something was different. Since when does a filthy mouse like you have the right to talk in our Greece, our Athens, and our Parthenon Temple?” Tuis was obviously the kind to say anything that came to mind. He no longer had to watch his words after they had fallen out with one another!

“I was just telling my friend that you were the rotten apple here,” Mo Fan agreed.

“I don’t like arguing with filthy people like you. It will only put an ugly stain on my character. I’m Tuis the Seventh, and my ancestors have protected the Parthenon Temple and Athens from the Tyrant Titans. What about you?” Tuis demanded haughtily.

“That was your ancestors’ doing. What do you have anything to do with it? It’s not like a respectful family will never give birth to an assh***,” Mo Fan shot right back.

“You! You are dishonoring my family!” Tuis snapped.

“I didn’t dishonor your family. I was only talking about you. Let me ask you, what exactly are you good for? What have you done except for acting like an arrogant and disrespectful scum? Nothing. If anything is dishonoring your family, it would be your existence. You despised someone’s background just because she turned down your invitation for a dance. I believe a real respectful clan wouldn’t teach their disciples to act like that, so I believe your pride is the reason behind it. Please don’t say another word. You will only embarrass your clan,” Mo Fan sniffed.
