The Scar of Tianshan Mountain had remained in its unspoiled state. Living creatures here would either eat or be eaten. There was no law of the jungle. It was all about survival!

The alliance was strong once the Mages came together. They kept advancing by killing the demon creatures, but their lives were at stake as they continued to attract more scavengers. These scavengers were good at teaming up against a common enemy. They were not as ignorant as the humans!

The beasts had found a huge piece of cake. A single scavenger could not possibly eat the entire cake. If it chose to wait for more scavengers...

“A Ruler-level Flying Snow Fox has appeared,” Nanyu said softly.

“It feels like they are preparing a crusade against us,” Jiang Yu said grimly.

“We’ve left a trail of blood and magic presence behind us, not to mention the noise of the battles... it is going to attract all the scavengers within a few kilometers,” Ai Jiangtu warned them.

“When do you think they will make their moves?” Mo Fan asked Jiang Shaoxu.

“When we arrive at the next species’ territory,” Jiang Shaoxu surmised.

“We are screwed then; these scavengers are too united!” Zhao Manyan complained.

Most scavengers were solitary creatures. They would have long ended up as other creatures’ food if they were not strong enough to protect themselves!

“Should we stop somewhere and deal with the things that are on our tail?” Bertan proposed.

“And how can we do that? They are maintaining their distance from us. If we attack them, they will just scatter and run!” Xing Hui said impatiently.

“We don’t have the time to stop here. These scavengers are just like us. Their coalition will break easily. They are planning to take us out first before fighting among themselves. The first storm is on its way, so this hunt must make sure they have enough food supply to last until spring. They are very cautious, but they are determined too,” Yassen declared.

“Are we really running out of time?”

“Yes, it will be a close call, and that’s assuming our path back is clear and smooth!”

“Let’s do it then. We have no choice but to force our way through the Ice Mountain Beasts ahead,” Klope said.

“We have to be careful. The Ice Mountain Beasts aren’t our only worry!” Yassen glanced at the walls nearby.

The figures moving in the shadows, the cunning grimaces of the demon creatures, the peeping eyes hidden in the blind spots, and the greedy intentions surrounding the alliance from all directions... those were the ones they should keep an eye on!

“We are getting closer to the Tianshan Sacred Lotus. This will be a very important battle!” Yassen said.

He had already told everyone where the Tianshan Sacred Lotus was. The opening in the two huge walls was already within their view. They should be able to see the light of the Sacred Lotus once they crossed the Ice Mountain Beasts territory. Everyone was aware of the Sacred Lotus’ value, even if it was not the reason they had come to Tianshan Mountain in the first place.

“Charge!”

“Charge!”

A few leaders took the initiative to charge at the Ice Mountain Beasts’ den, riding their Wind and Ice Magic. The den was inside a spacious canyon full of ice pillars and spikes. They could see complicated bridges made up of irregular sculpted ice when they looked into the canyon. They were as thick as the branches in a forest.

The Ice Mountain Beasts resided in their little kingdom. They were a Commander-level species with a pure lineage, and most importantly, they lived in groups!

A Commander-level species that lived together was pretty rare outside the safe zone of any country, but it was very common in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain!

The scavengers stayed outside the Ice Mountain Beasts’ territory. They did not dare set foot into it.

The scavengers had formed a weak coalition. Their strength might be comparable to the Ice Mountain Beasts, but they lacked synergy and teamwork. The Ice Mountain Beasts were willing to fight to their death to protect their territory, but that was not the case for the scavengers. They would leave right away when faced with such reckless creatures.

The humans had gone into the Ice Mountain beasts’ den. The scavengers had no choice but to wait until the battle in the canyon came to an end. They would then take out whoever won the battle so they could survive the winter!

“Did they follow us inside?” Zhao Manyan looked behind him. The scavengers had vanished behind the ice pillars.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come inside. That would only provoke the Ice Mountain Beasts,” Nanyu said.

“It’s usually us humans abusing the stupidity of the demon creatures and letting them fight one another, but they are doing the same thing to us now,” Zhao Manyan noticed.

“We don’t have a choice. As a matter of fact, high-level demon creatures are intelligent too. Otherwise, we would have long conquered the world, instead of hiding in our safe zones and cities,” Nanyu pointed out.

“So who’s familiar with the Ice Mountain Beasts? Can anyone tell me what their capabilities are before the fight?” Jiang Yu said.

“Jiang Yu, aren’t you an expert when it comes to demon creatures, yet you’re asking us now? Are you being serious?” Mo Fan had to ask.

“...I’ve never seen these creatures before, nor have I read about them. It’s Tianshan Mountain. Not many people have been here,” Jiang Yu said awkwardly. He subconsciously looked at Lingling.

Lingling was weak. She had to rely on magic Equipment to survive in the harsh environment. She was currently in Mo Fan’s arms, as she had to rely on Mo Fan’s Fire Magic to fend off the cold.

Mo Fan was worried when he saw her struggling to stay awake.

He should not have brought Lingling along. Her fragile body was unable to withstand the cold.

“Be careful of the bones that grow out of their joints. Those bones can break through almost every defensive Equipment, so you shouldn’t rely on your Equipment too much,” Lingling said softly.

“Our defensive Equipment is useless?” The eyes of everyone on the team opened wide.

The truth was, their team had only managed to preserve its numbers because of their outstanding Equipment!

Their Equipment was far better than anyone else’s in the alliance. Their factions were only worried about one thing, their safety, so their Equipment was capable of defending them from attacks far beyond what they could handle themselves.

Their hearts turned cold when they heard the Ice Mountain Beasts’ attacks could penetrate their defenses!

“Look at you, you bunch of... (sigh), didn’t I tell you not to rely on your magic Equipment so much? Look at me, did I panic?” Mo Fan grinned. He finally had a chance to school these rich second generations!
