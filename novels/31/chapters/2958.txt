Chapter 2959: Give The Name List

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Before Lingling and Mo Fan entered the Twin Guardian Towers, they subconsciously thought that the Red Demon Kazuaki would make radical changes to the towers and stir it up before the moonless night. However, both were wrong.

The Red Demon did not lay its hands on the Twin Guardian Towers at all. It would not simply lay its hands on its people.

This was because the Twin Guardian Towers were already within its grasp. The Evil Gang was one of the Red Demon Kazuaki’s evil sprouts. It had grown into a gigantic tree. The shade of the tree covered the towers like a mass of dark clouds.

The moonless night was about to arrive.

The Twin Guardian Towers was its fortress that would protect it during its ascension. The moment it ascended and became the emperor, it would use the Twin Guardian Towers as its base camp to infiltrate and grow rampantly. It would turn Osaka into a prison.

“Ms. Lingling, do you mean that the Twin Guardian Towers have been substantially infiltrated?” asked Officer Ozawa in horror.

“Officer Ozawa, you may have underestimated the Red Demon’s ability. Its doppelganger appeared in Kun Mountain of China. Since its inception, it has maintained solid control over a sizable prison. If not it, then who else gained control of the Twin Guardian Towers?” said Lingling.

“Oh, my god! Ms. Lingling, is it because the Twin Guardian Towers are completely under the Evil Gang’s control that you didn’t mention all this during the meeting?!” Officer Ozawa could barely control the pitch of his voice.

He was informed that the towers had only been breached. He believed the impact to be quite minor, much like the proportion of corrupt officers among the officials.

But according to Lingling’s argument, the Twin Guardian Towers had completely fallen! ‘How could this happen? Everything appeared to be in order, didn’t it?’

“Officer Ozawa, you’re the Chief and Takuichi’s right-hand man. When the meeting was over, didn’t the Chief allow you to draw up a name list of the suspected people?” asked Lingling.

“Not yet,” said Officer Ozawa while shaking his head.

“Oh, perhaps he wants you to send me back first. Officer Ozawa, how about we make a bet?” said Lingling.

“What’s the point of making a bet?”

“So that I can know if you’re trustworthy,” said Lingling.

“I-I need to digest your words first.” Officer Ozawa was scared. He found his world view disintegrating.

“You’re the one who pleaded with me to tell you the truth with sincerity. I am telling you the truth now, but you refuse to hear it and you want to retreat,” said Lingling.

“I… fine, Ms. Lingling, I admit that I’m starting to get scared. After all, I grew up here. I spent my childhood and most of my adulthood here. I served the Twin Guardian Towers. It’s my home. I’m very familiar with everyone. They are very dear to me.” Officer Ozawa’s tone changed.

At that moment, he did not know what to do. Lingling’s words shocked him. He wondered whether he could trust her, or if he was even willing.

“That’s very common. Most people would rather live in a dream. Even after they are inadvertently woken up from it, they want to return to it. However, a dream is, after all, just a dream. Dreams are illogical without any common senses and connection to reality. Dreams show things that appear in one’s subconscious minds. When they are able to think normally and revisit their dreams, they’ll find that everything in their dreams is like a sketch. The faces of the people they have been obsessed with are distorted with a hypocritical smile. The beautiful scenery behind their backs is drawn with a few rough lines. The outlines are blurred. They don’t actually like the things inside the dreams, they are only placing their hopes on them so they have the feeling of relying on them,” said Lingling.

Officer Ozawa was rendered speechless.

Lingling had used an appropriate to depict the circumstance. The Twin Guardian Towers were very much like a dream. Everything looked normal when they did not notice its problems. However, the moment they probed into it, thought of them carefully, and got to the bottom of them, they realized many things appeared bizarre and unusual.

Did the situation involving the few young individuals from the State House, for instance, appear normal? It was clear that it was just a minor incident, but many people were hurt by it.

It was deformed once they touched it.

“I’ll go back to my room and take a rest first. The moon is disappearing soon,” said Lingling to Officer Ozawa.

“What is the bet you mentioned?” Officer Ozawa asked.

Lingling whispered a few words to him. He fell deep into his thoughts. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

…

After Lingling closed her room door, Officer Ozawa still smelled her lingering fragrance. However, at that moment, he felt ambiguous.

Who should he trust?

He trusted the place where he grew up. He also trusted the elders and peers he had known since he was a child…

But Lingling, the Chinese girl who had wandered here by accident, made some terrifying remarks!

Officer Ozawa sucked in a deep breath before returning to his post. He was in charge of maintaining the security of the Twin Guardian Towers. All of the events were within his purview to handle.

Right after he returned to his office, a slender silhouette stood before the window.

Officer Ozawa was stunned. The faint moonlight reflected the person’s appearance. He was a familiar figure. It was Chief Shigekyo.

“Chief, why are you here?” Officer Ozawa asked in surprise.

He was about to switch on the light, but the Chief stopped him.

Chief Shigekyo turned around, looking depressed.

“Ozawa, you have been in charge of the order of the Twin Guardian Towers over the years. You handle almost all the internal incidents that happen inside the towers. You know the ins and outs of every department, level of management, and the staff. I hope you can draw up a list for me of the people who may have been affected by the Evil Gang,” said Chief Shigekyo.

“H-How could I simply convict people without any evidence?” said Officer Ozawa in shock.

“It’s just a name list with suspected people. Everyone in the country has the right to list out suspects. They have nothing to fear if they haven’t broken the rules. With your current position, you communicate, interact, reconcile, and handle everyone from the institute to the families, Ministry of Security, and the military. You deal with Katano, Tegami, and Takuichi. You’re familiar with their subordinates. No one knows better than you what they are doing, or what they have done over the years. The Twin Guardian Towers are in great danger. You’re my most trusted man. The reason I came alone is because I need to seek your assistance as you’ve been an honest and loyal person. I need your help for the sake of preventing the towers from rotting…” said Chief Shigekyo solemnly.
