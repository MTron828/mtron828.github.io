The Wolf Queen looked down at Mo Fan and noticed the deadly silver lights he was emitting. They were stabbing at her fur like thousands of silver swords!

The Wolf Queen was surprised at seeing a human able to unleash such a strong Aura in an instant.

Mo Fan had already moved onto her back before she realized he was a powerful Mage.

A strange force grabbed her tail strongly. Pain shot up from her tail as her body was lifted off the top of the mountain.

Mo Fan was hovering in the air, surrounded in a bright silver light, looking like a sacred silver knight. He had hoisted the Wolf Queen off the ground by grabbing her tail, and now tossed her at a jagged mountain ridge!

The wall of the mountain ridge collapsed, and the Wolf Queen fell into the deep canyon there. Her fur scattered in the air while her blood splattered on the road.

The Battlemages and Hunters on the fortress were dumbfounded.

Was that guy a god? He just threw the Wolf Queen, a Ruler-level creature, around like a wild dog!

The imperious Wolf Queen immediately found herself in a pinch. The mysterious silver light had overshadowed her ferocity.

“Be careful, that creature is extremely fast and cunning!” Zhou Yuan shouted as a warning.

The canyon was full of huge boulders. They had fallen from the ridge-wall and stacked into a pile atop the Wolf Queen.

The Wolf Queen was bleeding now. It seemed like she was unable to move because of the boulders atop her, but a sinister light flashed in her eyes.

The rocks on the Wolf Queen exploded into pieces. The Wolf Queen had pretended she was hurt, but she suddenly jumped into the sky and opened her mouth wide while unleashing her deadly mist.

The canyon was instantly dyed red as thick fangs burst out of the ground and the walls, covering the nearby hills.

Mo Fan was amused by the attack.

The Wolf Queen was just a demon creature, after all. Could she be more cunning than a human?

Mo Fan murmured the name of his Super Lightning Spell, “Lightning Punishment: Seal of the Twelve Laws!”

He had finally improved the Seal of the Nine Laws to the Seal of the Twelve Laws. Its strength and binding power were much greater than the previous version.

The fangs were heading for Mo Fan from below. He swung the giant purple halberd in his hand and created a deep lightning scar in the canyon!

The mighty blow knocked the Wolf Queen out of the canyon as paralyzing lightning arcs attached themselves to her body.

The Wolf Queen fled to the other side of the canyon. She adjusted her stance like she was going to lunge at Mo Fan and attack him with her claws.

Mo Fan’s lightning halberd was quicker. He threw it right at the Wolf Queen!

Lightning powerful enough to inflict waves of dizziness struck the Wolf Queen’s head. The Wolf Queen did not expect the lightning halberd to be so heavy, and the blow forcibly knocked her to the ground!

More lightning halberds appeared, each imbued with powerful lightning. Their lightning arcs swept the canyon and mountains around her like countless writhing serpents!

Twelve lightning halberds now towered among the mountains in a spectacular fashion.

The Wolf Queen was trapped in the Lightning Punishment Magic Formation. Their lightning was whipping at her continuously.

The Wolf Queen was lacerated multiple times. Her back and stomach were soon covered in scorched wounds!

“Such a powerful Mage!”

The people on the fortress stared in disbelief.

They had thousands of people ready to fight the Wolf Queen, but they were like a flock of sheep waiting to be slaughtered. They were defeated easily when they tried to fight back.

To their surprise, this Mage was fiercer than the Wolf Queen. The strong Ruler-level creature was covered in wounds in just a few minutes!

“It looks like I was being ignorant,” Zhou Yuan mocked himself.

He was worried the man would get the worst of it by trying to fight the Wolf Queen directly. He did not expect the man’s Lightning Magic to be so outstanding. It had instantly trapped the Wolf Queen and prevented her from using her speed.

The Wolf Queen was giving off a strong burnt smell after being assaulted by the Lightning Magic. The venomous insects hiding under her fur were slaughtered by the lightning, and her wounds were unable to heal quickly without the venomous insects’ help.

The venomous insects could drain the life force of living creatures and use it to heal the Wolf Queen’s injuries. However, the Lightning Punishment Formation was so strong that it had killed all the venomous insects upon her instead!

The Wolf Queen was angered and humiliated. She had assumed destroying a little human city was going to be an easy task, but she had ended up biting a steel plate as soon as she set foot into human territory.

“Move the mountain!”

Mo Fan immediately followed up on his attack. The Wolf Queen had desperately broken free from the Lightning Formation when a huge mountain nearby suddenly exploded into pieces!

It was shocking to watch the top of a mountain breaking apart. On top of that, the mountain’s peak was somehow floating in the air. It crashed down onto the Wolf Queen with a little push from Mo Fan.

The peak was made up of sturdy rock and was covered in pines and shrubs. It plummeted onto the Wolf Queen with overwhelming force. The Wolf Queen had just climbed to her feet, and the impact broke her backbone right away!

The Wolf Queen shrieked in agony. The mountain began to crack apart under the force of her power and the shockwaves. The ground the broken peak landed on had cracks spreading out for kilometers. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Aim your spells at my vortex,” Mo Fan instructed the Mages on the fortress.

Zhou Yuan and General Nan did not understand Mo Fan at first, but they quickly gave out the right orders when an expanding Chaos Vortex appeared close to Mo Fan on the road.

There were several thousand Mages atop the fortress. They might not stand a chance against the Wolf Queen, but it did not necessarily mean their magic was useless.

“Everyone, listen up! Fire your spells into the Chaos Vortex!” General Nan ordered loudly.

The Battlemages and Hunters had witnessed the man who kidnapped the wolf pups being eaten alive, but they had not dared make a sound. They had even heard the Wolf Queen threatening to butcher the whole city.

How could they not be angry?

The demon creature had claimed she had control over their lives, just like a cruel tyrant. Were they really that puny?

Their hearts, which had fallen into the abyss of despair, had risen again when they saw Mo Fan beating the crap out of the Wolf Queen.

Now, even their blood was boiling for some reason!

Their magic only had the brilliance of fireflies at first, but their spells suddenly erupted like flames and dove into the Chaos Vortex!

“I shall lead you to slaughter the Wolf Queen today!” Mo Fan’s voice spread across the Snowy Peak Mountain.

The man was demanding that they slaughter a Ruler-level creature, the Ruler of the Nanling Mountains. It sounded so very arrogant, but it definitely made everyone’s hearts pound heavily!
