Chapter 2743: Taking Instead of Robbing

“Hi cutie, we meet again,” said Mo Fan as he placed Ruan Feiyan’s weak form on the street in front of Shu Xiaohua. “Look, your Big Sister Ruan fainted. Could you help her out?”

Shu Xiaohua spit out her tanghulu, looking disgusted at Mo Fan.

“Be good and show me the way. I would like to meet up with your grannies. After all, you’re nothing to me. I don’t want to waste my time killing you in my wasted fit of anger.” The corners of Mo Fan’s mouth curled up into an annoying smile.

Shu Xiaohua was a scheming and cunning woman. But she wasn’t stupid. She knew she was no match for Mo Fan. She did what Mo Fan told her to. She led him to Granny’s Mountain villa.

“I used to enjoy devouring b*tches like you.” Unbeknownst to them, Apas had sneaked out from her Contracted Space. She glared at Shu Xiaohua.

Apas was Medusa, and most Medusas were of demonic bloodline. They ate young ladies to maintain their youthfulness. When Mo Fan first saw her at the ruins, some corpses and bones were scattered around the pitiful Apas.

Apas herself had half human bloodline so she did not consume young women, but she did not stop her handmaiden, who was also a Medusa, from having her fill. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Shu Xiaohua was definitely the handmaiden’s cup of tea. Those who were b*tchy, fragrant and wicked but pretended to be na?ve and sweet tasted delicious.

“Hiss! Hiss!” Apas flicked her tongue out, revealing her fangs and forked tongue. She bared her fangs as she sized Shu Xiaohua up.

Shu Xiaohua had assumed Apas was just an ordinary woman. She was shocked and scared to see that Apas was actually a snake-haired creature. Shu Xiaohua feared snakes. She had been plotting how to drive Mo Fan to death, but when Apas appeared, her mind went blank.

“Are you aware that Medusas are a type of marrow-sucking snakes? Our fangs are like syringes. We can suck a creature’s blood, fats, and bone marrows without hurting their skins. It’s similar to you humans drinking coconut water. Once you finish the coconut water, you coat the outer layer with antiseptic herbs and hang it inside the wardrobe, don’t you? Likewise, my older sister loves to do that. She has endless young lady skins to change throughout the year,” Apas whispered in Shu Xiaohua’s ear.

Shu Xiaohua seldom ventured outside. So, she did not have the slightest knowledge about skinning. But listening to Apas made it seem too painful and real that she almost fainted.

Mo Fan was very satisfied with Apas’s intervention.

......

In the past, Apas used to do this to scare Lingling. However, Shu Xiaohua wasn’t as intelligent and experienced as Lingling. Lingling wasn’t unaware of morbid and bizarre things. Lingling had read many books on ancient curses and rituals. Whenever Apas used to whisper something gory to Lingling, she would turn right back and narrate something macabre at Apas without flinching.

...

Mo Fan threatened the two ladies and headed towards Licheng Afterglow Mountain villa. He saw some men and women in strange clothes along the way. He did not care. Mo Fan ignored them if they did not ask for trouble.

“Have you heard of the Underground Holy Spring?” Mo Fan asked.

Shu Xiaohua lowered her head. Her face darkened. She remained silent.

Mo Fan chuckled. He then signaled Apas to apply soul-searching technique. Apas’s snake pupils flashed. Shu Xiaohua became petrified and stood frozen in her place.

“Suit yourself,” Apas said bewitchingly while tidying her elegant long hair.

Mo Fan asked Shu Xiaohua about the island. It turned out that she understood Licheng Afterglow Island’s past quite well.

A hundred years ago, there were two famous hidden clans in Licheng City who had inherited powerful ancient magic. They were called Afterglow Island and Mingwu Ancient City. Those who came from the two greatest hidden clans were basically dragons among men.

However, the hidden clan from Afterglow Island had offended the ruler of that time. As a result, the ruler lured out the people from Afterglow Island and killed all of them, leaving not even a single soul behind. Since then, no one knew how to find the ruins of the Afterglow Island.

In order to stay out of trouble, people from Mingwu Ancient City began to recruit outsiders, transforming Mingwu Ancient City into a normal city in Licheng City instead of a place purely for hidden clans.

After the ruler died, the foreign population had assimilated with the people from Mingwu Ancient City. The minority hidden clan in Mingwu Ancient City refused to let the two greatest hidden clans from their past to just disappear. They decided to look for Afterglow Island and get out of the Mingwu Ancient City.

They were aware that Afterglow Island contained the Underground Holy Spring. If they managed to discover that blessed land, they could revive the glory of the two hidden clans.

The ancient statues had the most value in Mingwu Ancient City. Moving the statues to the secretive Afterglow Island was tantamount to combining the two greatest hidden clans. By doing so, they could protect themselves in the middle of chaos while nurturing experts!

They soon discovered the Underground Holy Spring at the Afterglow Island. The hidden clan from Mingwu Ancient City migrated to the Afterglow Island. They carried the most important ancient statue away from Mingwu Ancient City when they went to settle down on the island.

Little did they expect that carrying the ancient statue would lead to an immense lightning disaster. The lightning storm struck Licheng City rampantly, causing the people in Licheng City to suffer tremendously.

They were afraid that the destructive disaster would befall them once more. Hence, they shifted all the blame to the totem, and wiped them all out before escaping to the Afterglow Island.

An enormous ancient statue from Mingwu Ancient City alone was sufficient to ensure their safety at Afterglow Island, after all. They lived there for many years and did not bother with the other statues in the Mingwu Ancient City for others

However, when they noticed a rise of sea levels and an increasing number of ferocious and powerful Ocean Godly Horde and Hunter Dirty Demons lurking near the Afterglow Island, they knew that the powerful Ocean Demons had laid their eyes on the land.

In order to gain wider protection, they decided to take the remaining ancient statues from Mingwu Ancient City back to Licheng Afterglow Island. By doing so, they could ensure their safety regardless of how long the war with the demons lasted.

‘So, it looks like the two hidden clans are connected to the Weiju clan from Ancient Capital. The descendants of the Ancient King are scattered in many places, keeping an eye on an ancient holy relic. But most of them have assimilated with other commoners. No one knows who owns the ancient holy relics. The sacred Underground Holy Spring is considered to be in good hands at Licheng Afterglow Island.’ Mo Fan now understood the entire story.

Well, he was at least half of the Ancient King’s disciples, so he had not actually robbed the holy spring essence.
