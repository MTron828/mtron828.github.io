In the past, Mo Fan’s Lightning Strikes could only fire a hundred lightning bolts at a certain area randomly, but his control of the Lightning Element had now reached the Super Level. Not only did his Lightning Element have a much higher energy output, Mo Fan could also continuously cast Sky Lightning Claw in the area above him every half second. Several Sky Lightning Claws might even show up at the same time. It was like the apocalypse when the sky was filled with terrifying talons of lightning!

A burnt smell lingered in the air, together with the blood, ashes, and remains of the Featherless Birds. The lightning claws were like a demon with control over lightning holding a gleeful massacre, slaughtering its opponents in the most brutal way. The sturdy flesh of the demon birds did not even stand a chance against the Lightning Magic with twelvefold damage amplification!

“Nice kill!” Zhao Manyan felt a lot better when he saw the sky above him clearing up, like the sunlight had finally penetrated dark clouds that had been around forever.

Mo Fan looked around him and noticed that even though many Manta Ray Evil Birds nearby were slain, more of them were gathering in the distance. They once again filled up the area, before Mo Fan even had a chance to catch his breath!

“Lightning Tyrant Scars!” Mo Fan’s Lightning Magic did not stop there. He activated the additional effects of his Lightning Magic as a new batch of Manta Ray Evil Birds arrived!

Mo Fan was very experienced at fighting large groups of demon creatures. He knew he needed time to cast a powerful destructive spell, and his low-level spells could not kill the creatures faster than the rate they could show up. Therefore, he had to make use of every spell to maximize his damage output.

Mo Fan had purposely left the Manta Ray Evil Birds that were tagged with the Seals of the Lightning Tyrant Scars alive. Lightning was able to spread rapidly by itself, especially after the dance of the lightning claws just a moment ago. Even the weakest lightning chain that only caused the Manta Ray Evil Birds a slight numbness was extremely useful, since it would continue to spread to another seven or ten nearby Manta Ray Evil Birds after hitting its first target. Those arcs would rapidly dissipate, yet they would leave a Lightning Tyrant Scar on the creatures as long as they were within the Lightning Tyrant Domain!

Even the weakest lightning arc could trigger a punishment as powerful as Thunderbolt: Exploding Apex! Mo Fan hid inside Zhao Manyan’s Water Curtain and waited until the lightning arcs had fully spread among the creatures.

“Tyrant Call!” Mo Fan roared out when the time was right to activate the Lightning Tyrant Scars. Thick lightning bolts began to pour down rapidly from a huge storm cloud where he had long accumulated his Lightning Magic!

The lightning strikes fell like a blinding downpour, surging down like a great calamity. The people of the town gaped as they witnessed the spectacular sight!

Lightning densely spread across the sky, as if there were as many lightning bolts as there were Manta Ray Evil Birds!

The Tyrant Call was not very effective to most people who gained it, since it could only trigger a lightning strike equivalent to the strength of the Intermediate Spell, Thunderbolt: Exploding Apex. The spell would only inflict average injuries on a Warrior-level creature, while it would merely scratch the itch of a Commander-level creature.

However, it was a deadly weapon in Mo Fan’s hands, due to the twelvefold damage amplification of his Lightning Element. The Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds could barely endure the damage, but the Lesser Featherless Birds did not stand a chance. They absolutely died if they were caught by any of the lightning bolts, not to mention the extra damage when the lightning was chaining continuously as more lightning strikes fell from the heavens!

Ashes scattered like dispersing smoke. The black cluster of the Manta Ray Evil Birds’ wings and heads had disappeared completely after the strobing assault. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan could no longer see any of the Manta Ray Evil Birds within a kilometer of them!

“You’re f**king Thor!” Zhao Manyan was shocked by the damage of Mo Fan’s Tyrant Call.

“They are too dumb. They had no idea that my lightning could spread among them!” Mo Fan grinned.

Mo Fan was very pleased when he saw all the Soul Remnants being absorbed into Little Loach Pendant’s world like fireflies.

It seemed like he would have to enlarge his wolf valley again!

Not all of the Manta Ray Evil Birds had died. As a matter of fact, there were still a lot of them approaching from the distance. After all, Mo Fan had only killed the first ones to recover from being drugged. There were a whole bunch more of them on the other side of the mountain. They were currently circling the area, while maintaining their distance from Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

They were a high-level species, after all. They did not dare to charge at the two recklessly after being taught a lesson. The Lesser Featherless Birds only engaged them after making sure the lightning had dissipated.

“They seem a little afraid of us... damn it, they are heading for the city!” Zhao Manyan cursed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Mo Fan looked into the distance and noticed a huge group of Manta Ray Evil Birds was avoiding him and flying directly to the city.

There was nothing Mo Fan could do. He and Zhao Manyan could only stop so many of them. The Manta Ray Evil Birds might be savage, but they knew it was unnecessary to waste their time on a strong human Mage like Mo Fan. They just needed to dispatch a group of Lesser Featherless Birds to keep the two busy!

“I don’t think Mu Bai and Miss Tangyue can look after so many people at once, either. There are no emergency shelters and the people are too scattered. There’s no way we can stop the creatures,” Zhao Manyan sighed.

“Let’s hope the people of the Hongling Division will be here soon. That way, they might be able to save more lives. What a shitshow!” Mo Fan cursed.

They had already done their best. The rest was in the hands of the Heavens!

“Mo Fan, look over there! That light seems a bit familiar!” Zhao Manyan suddenly noticed a special light, glowing like a sacred moon, coming from the direction they had arrived from. It was flying toward Honglai Town at outstanding speed.

Mo Fan’s gaze went past the demon birds and noticed the object with a sacred aura, too. He also noticed another figure with jagged edges inside the holy light with his outstanding night vision.

“It seems to be little Moon Moth Phoenix!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed jubilantly.

“It’s her...” Mo Fan also recognized the little Moon Moth Phoenix.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix’s light was too distinctive, especially at night. It was both elegant and imperious, like a deity that had descended upon the mundane world.

A loud and powerful cry suddenly drowned out the racket the Manta Ray Evil Birds were making!
