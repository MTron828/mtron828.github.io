Pearl Institute did not have any societies. It focused on bringing up students with outstanding achievements in the hunting fields. It also provided more opportunities for students who wanted to gain real-life experience.

The Hunter Tournament was about to begin. The Hunter Society received an invitation from the Hunter Union. The Hunter Society would send a team to participate in the tournament.

Lingling was a Hunter Master. Even though she was qualified to participate in the tournament on her own, she could not fight independently. Without someone as great as MO Fan, Lingling could not do much with the given task.

It was out of the question to drag MO Fan to join her in the Hunter Tournament right now. Lingling had to find her own way. Thus, she decided to join a new team. Above all, she had to train herself to handle the given task independently.

She finally turned eighteen and could choose to work on her own.

‘Hmph! Without the help of MO Fan, I can still become a great Senior Hunter!’

The Hunter Society was her best option. Joining the other hunter team at the age of eighteen was out of the question. She would be seen as too young for the job and would be mistreated.

The Hunter Society was an important institution in the Imperial College. She would be under the protection of the college and led by teachers and students of similar age.

It was a good plan to complete her studies while becoming a Senior Hunter.

The college was very different from the previous magic high school. Fighting for the basic magic resources with a group of freshmen and sophomores would be no different from wasting her youth.

It was boring to be a student. It was more fun to be a hunter.

The Hunter Society was located at the edge of the woods. The courtyard was spacious with several open houses. When they entered through the courtyard, they could see many people busily going in and out of the place.

A professor was in charge of the Hunter Society. The Hunter Society in the Imperial College was famous. Many students would do everything they could to join as one of its members to gain more resources. They could also gain an effective hunter network compared to outside.

“Lingling, Tong Zhouzheng is the professor in charge of the society. We have nine graduated seniors. They are established Hunter Masters. The rest of the members are composed of freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. They also want to become hunters. There are a total of more than seventy members in the society. Welcome to our society!” said Jiang Bingming.

He led Lingling through the courtyard of the Hunter Society. Some people were facing the main entrance inside the main hall. One of them was a lady with long orange hair. Despite wearing a very short skirt, she sat on the table.

“She is our senior, Guan Yao. She is a Four-Star Hunter Master. She is fearless and executes bounty tasks. From the time she joined the Hunter Society, she has argued with the seniors and juniors alike. She is quite hot-tempered,” whispered Jiang Bingming.

Right after he finished speaking, Guan Yao turned and looked in their direction. She raised her voice at Jiang Bingming, “Bingming, how’s the progress of the thing I asked you about? Do you still want to participate in the Hunter Tournament? Why do you still have time to take your girlfriend around… Oh well, she’s pretty and younger, so I guess she’s not your girlfriend.” Jiang Bingming was about to respond, but his face turned dark at her words.

“Nice to meet you, senior. I’m an exchange student from Pearl Institute. My name is Leng Lingling.” Lingling introduced herself.

“So, you’re an exchange student. Most of the exchange students are extraordinary.” Guan Yao slid down from the table.

She quickly walked to them and stared at Lingling. She looked at her from head to toe.

“She is Dean Song He’s niece,” said Jiang Bingming. “Dean Song He wants her to join us in the tournament. He wants her to learn with us. Senior, please take care of her in the future.’

“So, you can join us because of your relationship with the dean. How enviable! The Hunter Tournament is not a game. Lingling, you look delicate. Can you endure the hardships of fieldwork, the long journey, as well as mingling with a bunch of lusty and stinky men?” Guan Yao approached Leng Lingling.

Leng Lingling kept a distance from her. Although Guan Yao was pretty, Lingling felt strange getting too close to her.

“You’re quite shy! Don’t worry. You’re Dean Song He’s niece. The rest of the mighty and powerful seniors will take great care of you. They are good for nothing. They curry favor with the top management with the hope of breaking through,” said Guan Yao.

“Guan Yao, stop talking nonsense!”

“Just because you’re a Four-Star Hunter Master doesn’t mean you can look down on us!”

“So, you’re Song He’s niece. Welcome to our society. Our society is a good place to intern. The Hunter Society in Imperial College is reputable.”

Several seniors chipped in. Some of them refuted Guan Yao. Some of them welcomed Lingling. A few of them remained silent.

“We are preparing a name list of the students who are joining us in the tournament. Most of the students are top-tier hunters with great strength. Unfortunately, we lack an outstanding bounty performance. Do you have a hunter title? If you don’t, we must figure out another way,” asked Guan Yao.

“I have.”

“That’s good. Add your name to the list, then,” said Guan Yao.

“I think Qi Lan is quite good. His Poison Element Magic can greatly reduce a lot of nature’s threats.

“Shou Feng is good too. He possesses Lightning Element Magic, which is a key combat power. If we face any troublesome demons or horrible hunter competitors, we might really suffer without someone like him.”

“Get off! Let me finalize the list!” Guan Yao scolded.

For a moment, the hall was in chaos. Most of the students stood far away. They dared not speak up. Meanwhile, Guan Yao acted as if she was the boss and the ultimate decision-maker. The rest of the seniors were extremely dissatisfied with her.

They fought for a few minutes. Suddenly, someone faked a cough. The next moment, the crowd became quiet. A handsome man walked toward them.

“He’s Professor Tong Zhouzheng. He is very strict,” said Jiang Bingming. “The professor looks quite young.” Lingling watched as Tong Zhouzheng walked toward them.

“He is. He’s the youngest professor at the Imperial College. There is hardly any professor who is as influential as him. Even the elders from the Hunter Union respected him,” said Jiang Bingming.

Professor Tong Zhouzheng saw Leng Lingling. He glanced at her but didn’t say anything.

“Have you prepared the name list?” asked Tong Zhouzheng.

Guan Yao said softly, “We’ve basically confirmed the list. Professor, do you want to change anything?”

“If it’s confirmed, let’s depart now.”

“Huh? Now?!”

“Yes. There have been some changes to the tournament..”
