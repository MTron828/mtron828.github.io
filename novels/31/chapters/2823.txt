Chapter 2824: Totem Holy Spring

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Mo Fan tried to get closer so that Little Loach could identify it. But after considering it carefully, these ancient images were presented using the contortion of space and chaos to show them some sort of a holographic movie. How could it emit energy and let Little Loach absorb it?

Mo Fan was familiar with the water in the well. It was soft, flowed slowly, and the molecules moved differently than water. Its purity and luster were very distinctive.

“Is it the Underground Holy Spring?” Mu Bai and Zhang Xiaohou took a closer look.

They had not seen the Underground Holy Spring in so long, so they were unfamiliar with it. They looked at Mo Fan for confirmation.

“Yes, it must be the Underground Holy Spring,” Song Feiyao answered affirmatively.

She had been cultivating on Licheng Afterglow Island’s spiritual land from very young. That spiritual land had let her build her cultivation base to what it was now. So, she was very sure of what she saw.

“If that’s true then the Sacred Totem beast should be here all this time, but why haven’t we noticed anything so far?” Mo Fan was confused.

They had found the Underground Holy Spring, so where was the Sacred Totem Beast?

All they could see were some soldiers of the Ancient City who could ‘survive’ in the ancient city walls, but they did not see the Sacred Totem Beast, not even a trace of it.

‘If this place was the tomb of the Sacred Totem Beast, where is its skeleton?’ wondered Mo Fan.

“The Underground Holy Spring is the totem power of the Sacred Totem Beast,” Lingling walked around the source of the Underground Holy Spring to Mo Fan.

Zhao Manyan sighed. “It is hopeless now. We should have traveled along the four oceans to see if Dark Tortoise is still alive. My Black Totem Turtle likes to follow the ocean currents when it has nothing to do. When I asked what it was doing, it said it was looking for something, but it wasn’t sure what it was. In my opinion, the Black Totem Turtle is looking for its dad, the Dark Tortoise. It’s either in the Arctic Ocean or the Antarctic Ocean,” he said.

They felt disappointed at having worked so hard and achieved such a result. It felt like they were back at square one. They finally figured out the origin of the Underground Holy Spring and knew what the totem power was, but it did not make any difference at all.

“Forget about the Dark Tortoise. What happened to the magical city walls? Why is it gone now?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“People most probably demolished them. There are some in Mingwu Ancient City, and the gate is here. The others were part of some cities for thousands of years and have long disappeared,” Zhao Manyan said.

“We can ask Xiao Tai’s father about it. Since he has been guarding this place, he should know—Wow, look at that guy with the rotten face!” Zhang Xiaohou suddenly pointed at a general on Heavy Military Avenue.

The general was wearing tattered armor. His hair was disheveled, and he walked wearily towards Moon Observing Well. He looked like Xiao Tai’s father!

“Oh my, this guy has lived for a long time! This city probably existed two or three thousand years ago,” Zhao Manyan said in surprise.

He had lived for that long! They wondered what his level was now. Fortunately, they did not have to fight him.

“Should we keep on searching? I feel like this is the end. The Sacred Totem Beast already died thousands of years ago.” Zhang Xiaohou felt undecided.

“Let’s get out of here and ask the Undead.” Mo Fan sighed.

As everyone walked to the Ancient City Gate, the scene in the Ancient City Pond returned to its original state. It was quiet and still. Soon, the sky would be red again. Day after day, this anomalous phenomenon would keep repeating. They did not know what message it held for them or the future generation. Or if it was just an echo which had become natural in its repetition.

It was like those guardians of the Underground Holy Spring they had come across. They had forgotten why they guarded it.

The undead in the tomb were no longer obsessed with preventing people from entering this mysterious realm.

“Should we find those divine walls? I think they will be helpful to us,” Jiang Shaoxu suggested.

“We have no clue where exactly the walls were moved. The only information we have is that there are some statues in Mingwu Ancient City, but those statues are only a small part of it.” Mo Fan shook his head.

He did not think they could progress any further with what they knew. The Sacred Totem Beast had disappeared thousands of years ago, he saw no point in looking for its remains.

The Totems that were still alive, such as the Black Totem Snake, White Tiger, Green East Sea God, and Moon Moth Phoenix, may have been the incarnations of the Sacred Totem Beasts.

Two of the four Sacred Totem Beasts had died. They did not know where to find the other two and did not know if it was too late to find them.

“Let’s go to Kunlun. Kunlun must have things we want to know, and there are some Totems that we have never learned about,” Zhang Xiaohou suggested.

Mo Fan shook his head. They would go to Kunlun but not right now.

There was no clue to the Seal of Totem Beast, so it was just a waste of time to go to Kunlun. They must have a clear direction of the location of the White Tiger before going to Kunlun otherwise their journey would be unnecessarily long.

“We should go to the Ancient Capital. It just so happens that we need to wipe out the Undeads in the Ancient Capital. Once we take care of the back, we can fight in the east at ease,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“The situation in the Ancient Capital has always been like that. The Ancient King suppressed the Undeads, so it is natural for them to have grievances. It’s just like dams and rivers. How can the dams block the rivers all the time? We should open a small gate that won’t flood the farmlands and villages. In this way, the Undeads can provide us with some supplies and protection instead,” Mo Fan suggested.

The Undeads of the Ancient Capital had maintained that state for thousands of years.

The Undeads would not go extinct, and the Ancient King could not protect the Ancient Capital forever. As the Queen of Nine Serenities predicted, the Ancient Capital must handle itself by coexisting with the Undeads, relying on their protection, and battling them, if necessary.

Mu Bai nodded. The Ancient Capital had always been this way.

The catastrophe caused the Ancient Capital to suffer heavy losses. At that time, the Ancient King restrained the Undeads and gave the Ancient Capital time to recuperate. The Ancient Capital had become prosperous again. The existence of the Undeads resulted in strong Mages and incomes. It was part of the land.

There were hurricanes in the south, earthquakes in the mainland, and sandstorms in the north. However, people could protect themselves from hurricanes, earthquakes, and sandstorms. Most people had accepted these disasters as part of their lives and did not leave their homes.

“Let’s follow Brother Zhao’s suggestion and go to the Arctic Ocean to find the Dark Tortoise. I haven’t been to the Arctic Ocean yet,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Zhao Manyan slapped Zhang Xiaohou on the back playfully. He laughed. “I was just joking. How can we go to the Arctic Ocean? The Iceberg Beasts are vicious, and the whole of northern Europe suffers from it.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Xiaohou, you seem to want to keep us engaged in something else.” Mo Fan frowned and stared at Zhang Xiaohou.

“No, I don’t. I’m just…” Zhang Xiaohou was tongue-tied as he faced Mo Fan.

Zhang Xiaohouwas always nervous and flustered when he faced Mo Fan since childhood. Whenever Mo Fan turned serious, he forgot that he was a famous general who didn’t have to feel so nervous.

“Could it be that Commander Hua doesn’t want us to return? Did something happen along the coast?” Mo Fan asked.
