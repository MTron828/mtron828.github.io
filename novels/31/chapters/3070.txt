3072 Hexagram Mark 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The sound of uniform footsteps kept ringing in the surrounding area. They would search even the most inconspicuous street several times. Even though this was a city made entirely of magic, everything in this city was real.

In a dim attic, several white pigeons were also thrown into the Reflected Holy City. They seemed to have doubts like people and could not tell whether they were in the sky or on the earth.

There was another group of hurried footsteps on the street below the attic. A pair of eyes appeared in the gap in the attic window. This pair of eyes were purple and bright, and the owner of the eyes seemed anxious at the same time.

A ray of polarized light shone on the wooden floor in the attic. A book flying around like an elf was shaking restlessly beside a woman.

!!

The woman had purple hair, and she was using some medicine to treat the wound on the young girl lying on the ground.

There were Michael’s people everywhere. Sharjah did not dare use magic and could only rely on this relatively primitive way to bandage Lingling.

Lingling had regained consciousness. Her face was a little pale.

Mo Fan sighed with relief when he saw she was fine.

If Michael dared kill Lingling, Mo Fan would eat him alive!

“Michael’s strength is still beyond my expectations. I have no better way to help you. We can only hide for the moment,” Sharjah said to Mo Fan while feeling embarrassed.

“We didn’t expect things to turn out this way. Alas, we were too naive.” Mo Fan sighed.

No one expected this outcome.

Perhaps all of them were working hard to turn the black stones into white, and they had indeed changed some situations. It was just that things suddenly developed in this uncontrollable direction.

They underestimated things.

Holy City had been making some unpopular decisions for decades, and the accumulation of anger and resentment was far greater than they thought. In the end, these resentments completely broke out in this judgment.

Mo Fan knew very well that this battle would come sooner or later. The balance between the top ten organizations and Holy City had long been disturbed. However, he did not expect this to happen to him and became the trigger of all this.

No one framed him, but it seemed as if everyone framed him.

Regardless of whether the top ten magic organizations or Holy City would control in the future, he was destined to become a victim between the two.

Mo Fan looked through the gap in the window and looked at Holy City, which had become a battlefield. He suddenly understood why Zhan Kong and Qin Yu’Er made such decisions.

They chose not to fight and leave.

What was the point of winning and losing?

Everything just changed from one ruler to the next.

Even if the top ten organizations won, new forces would be born in the future, and the new forces would overthrow the dictatorship of the top ten organizations. The cycle would repeat itself. Countless people were doomed to sacrifice for each change.

He was a victim, and so were Zhan Kong and Qin Yu’Er. All those who did not obey this law and did not stick to these forces would become victims. It was because these people were so out of place before and after the battle!

It was not easy to live as oneself.

“Mr. Mo, your chest…” Sharjah realized that there were wounds on Mo Fan’s chest.

These wounds formed a hexagram shape. Michael took Mo Fan’s soul through this hexagram chest mark and tried to shatter the divine oath that protected Mo Fan.

“I don’t know what it is.” Mo Fan lowered his head and looked at his wound.

“It is impossible to break the divine oath. Even if Michael reaches the realm of the gods, he still has to abide by the divine oath. There must be something wrong.” Sharjah extended her palm and pressed the hexagram mark on Mo Fan’s chest.

Sharjah closed her eyes and looked for something along the wounds. She soon noticed that the hexagram connected to one of Mo Fan’s souls!

Sharjah withdrew her hand. A hexagram mark appeared on her palm and burned her skin.

“What’s wrong?” Mo Fan looked at Sharjah in surprise.

“You are not on Shalitha’s list, but Michael’s. One of your eight souls has been branded with this hexagram!” Sharjah said to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was stunned. Before he understood what Sharjah meant, his chest suddenly felt hot, as if someone had stamped his chest with a hot iron. The mark that had turned into scars glowed with scorching light again, and blood flowed down. In a short time, the mark turned black!

At the same time, Mo Fan’s soul was also in pain. The Eight Souls of Wicked God appeared behind Mo Fan, and they seemed to be enduring this pain together with Mo Fan.

Mo Fan endured this torture and stared at his Eight Souls. Finally, he saw a hexagram mark on Kazuaki’s soul. It was also on Kazuaki’s chest!

Among the Eight Souls, Kazuaki’s soul had already been branded with the sinful mark of the angel!

In other words, all of this was arranged by Michael!

It was no wonder Michael could draw his soul through the divine oath. As long as he absorbed the power of the Wicked God and integrated into the Eight Souls, it was equivalent to absorbing the poison Michael fed to the Red Demon Kazuaki’s soul into his body!

In other words, even if the final result of the trial was not guilty, it did not matter as Michael had made another plan.

His chest was getting hotter and hotter. Suddenly, Mo Fan felt as if he was sucked by something. He crashed into the roof of the attic and smashed the roof.

It was like a magnet endowed with enormous suction power.

The hexagram mark on Mo Fan’s chest and in his soul complied with the huge magnetic force and flew between the two Holy Cities.

In the attic, Sharjah could not stop him and saw Mo Fan’s figure getting smaller and smaller. The frightening part was that in the middle of the boundless Holy City, a huge black Hexagram Formation that was like a spider web was capturing Mo Fan, who was sucked into the air.

The golden divine oath kept shining, like a piece of golden holy armor. They kept shining and guarding Mo Fan’s body and soul.

However, there was a gap in this armor, and this gap was the hexagram mark in Kazuaki’s soul. Mo Fan’s soul energy would be drawn out through this gap!

Between two Holy City, a giant black Hexagram Formation appeared out of thin air. The majestic formation was designed to trap a person. Even though that person was guarded by golden divine oath armor all over his body, he was still like an insect stuck to a spider web.

Michael, an angel with brilliant feathers all over his body, was like a spider catching its prey. He watched his prey coldly and patiently let the prey struggle on the web. He knew that the more the prey struggled, the more the spider web would stick to its body. Eventually, the prey would have no strength and ability to resist!
