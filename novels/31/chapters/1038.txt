No one was more familiar with the pieces of the Ice Crystal Bow that had merged with her soul. When the pieces were separated from a soul, it would bring extreme harm to the person, and it might even endanger their life!

“Don’t worry, those that lost their pieces didn’t die, but when the pieces were taken away, they completely lost their cultivation that they had worked hard for over the years and became ordinary humans. Of course, some ended up committing suicide after losing their cultivation, but I don’t really have time to care about them,” Pan Xi said.

Mu Ningxue grew even angrier the more she heard! If she knew the contract revolved around claiming someone else’s cultivation, she would not have accepted it. It was simply an evil art!

“By the way, your mother was one of the slaves to the contract, too,” Pan Xi suddenly burst out laughing. The smile on his face was eerie.

“What...what did you say?” Mu Ningxue shuddered.

Mu Ningxue’s memory of her mother immediately came to her mind. She recalled how haggard her mother was all of a sudden, and her hollow eyes, as if she had lost her soul. She eventually died of depression!

“Don’t be so surprised, it’s the decision she made. She spent all her life trying to join the Mu Clan, to join the board and become the best among everyone. Unfortunately, she wasn’t as talented as you are, so she placed all her hopes on you. When she lost her piece and her magic, she had let you inherit her contract. You are stronger than her, thus you deserve more of our attention. You didn’t disappoint us either, but it’s quite unfortunate that a member of your family was closely related to the Black Vatican. Do you understand how much of an impact that dealt to the entire Mu Clan?” Pan Xi snapped coldly.

“It’s my own decision too, but you never told me I was actually claiming someone else’s cultivation!” The anger on Mu Ningxue’s face was even more obvious.

“I did tell you, but you weren’t able to interpret it correctly. Nevertheless, I’ve told you everything you’re supposed to know. It’s time for me to take the Ice Crystal Bow that is almost completed from you, or you can hand it over yourself. I initially thought you were our best candidate. It’s such a pity, I’ve only told the people that had lost their pieces the truth, but I never thought I would be telling you, too. Just give up on the difficult path of cultivation and be an ordinary person. At least I can guarantee you a comfortable life from now onward,” Pan Xi took a step forward. His aura suddenly turned oppressive!

Mu Ningxue giggled self-mockingly when she looked at Pan Xi’s icy expression.

She had managed to come so far by working hard all the time. What right did this man have to snatch her cultivation away?

It turned out that even a formidable existence like the Mu Clan was relying on such an evil, forbidden magic that abused the souls of young disciples to breed the pieces of the Ice Crystal Bow. The pieces would eventually be given to a single person that would claim the complete Ice Crystal Bow. It was an inhumane way to obtain power!

“The Mu Clan has always been like this. Those that are valuable will be treated preciously, but those that lose their value will have to sacrifice themselves, so that the strong could become stronger!” Pan Xi looked at Mu Ningxue, who did not show any sign of trying to run away. As such, he was not in a rush, either.

“So, who are you going to give my piece to?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“Who do you think?”

“Mu Tingying?” Mu Ningxue knew the Mu Clan had been placing all their attention on her lately. “But she doesn’t own a piece.”

Pan Xi had said it. No one from the direct line was involved in the contract. The Mu Clan would not allow them to be a sacrifice to the Ice Crystal Bow!

“It’s me,” came a familiar voice from the side. Mu Ningxue could immediately identify the owner of the voice, without needing to turn around.

She did not turn to the person, even though she was aware that they were slowly walking toward her on the bridge.

Mu Ningxue was breathing heavily. She stared at the water flowing under the bridge, and could see her pale face in the reflection on the clear seawater.

“You’re not an Ice Mage.” Mu Ningxue still had a glimpse of hope. She was hoping that it had all been a mistake.

“The bow is a magic weapon. A Mage of any Element can use it, as long as it has been fed enough to recover its power. It doesn’t matter who uses it,” Pan Xi said.

“So, the strongest clan of the Ice Element is nothing but a joke. Those with the Ice Element are mere sacrifices to the people in power in the clan,” Mu Ningxue tried her best to stay calm.

“Exactly. It goes without saying that such an enormous clan needs powerful Mages to support it. Our reputation has convinced many Mages to join us, they feel extremely honored, even if it meant forfeiting their surname, and among these people, a portion of them are selected as fertilizer, to serve the talented people. You were meant to be in the talented group, but not anymore. The Mu Clan will not let you take part in the World College Tournament. It would simply destroy the reputation of the Mu Clan that we have built over so many years. When you chose to take this path, you were actually heading toward self-destruction. I did ask your father to convince you, but you’re too stubborn to listen. Without the clan’s support, it’s meaningless for you to participate in the World College Tournament. Not following the clan’s decision, doing things your own way is an act of betrayal, and a betrayer must be punished,” Pan Xi stated.

“How unbelievable...” Mu Ningxue raised her head and let out a long sigh. It was a sigh of both relief and disappointment. “I never thought i would hear that from a member of the clan’s board.”

“Cruel, isn’t it? I bet you still saw me as your mentor not long ago,” Pan Xi said.

“You’re overthinking it. I was never grateful toward you,” Mu Ningxue corrected coldly.

Pan Xi shrugged indifferently.

Mu Ningxue slowly turned around. She looked at the person walking elegantly in heels and said, “As for you, Nanrong Ni, I’m interested in knowing, were you being real back in the East Maritime Fortress?”

Nanrong Ni shook her head.

“I see,” Mu Ningxue wore a mocking grin, “Is it really necessary to lie to me now?”

Nanrong Ni was startled. She then burst out laughing and said, “Why did you ask if you already knew the truth?”

Mu Ningxue placed her hand on the bridge. An icy aura started spreading from her body. In order to prevent the others from noticing it, she was keeping the energy close to her hand.

“It’s useless, your capabilities are a mere joke in front of Pan Xi,” another woman’s voice came from the other side of the bridge.

Sharp heels clicked on the bridge. Mu Tingying, dressed in a royal purple outfit, reached the highest point of the arc-shaped bridge and walked forward slowly, like a proud princess.

She was followed by two men in luxurious silver robes.

Mu Ningxue recognized the outfits. They were worn by the disciplinary Mages under the clan’s board. They were responsible for hunting down and punishing the members of the clan who had broken the rules!

The disciplinary Mages of the Mu Clan were like the members of the Enforcement Union. Mu Ningxue had never thought a day like this would come. It was as ridiculous as an unreasonable nightmare.

Two Mages in silver robes also showed up on the other side of the bridge. The four disciplinary Mages fixed their eyes on her, as if she was an unforgivable criminal!

“Watch out, she still has the Ice Crystal Bow,” one of the disciplinary Mages warned sternly.

“Don’t worry, as long as I’m here, the Ice Crystal Bow won’t listen to her,” Pan Xi remained in place. It seemed like he had no intention of involving himself.

As a matter of fact, it was quite torturous for him if he had to kill someone he had always treated as a genius. Unfortunately, the clan’s board had already made the decision. They could not allow the Ice Crystal Bow to be in the hands of a person who was no longer a part of their clan.

“If I get her contract, does that mean I can use it immediately? Can I use it in the World College Tournament?” Nanrong Ni asked.

“You’ll need to erase the mark of her soul imprinted on it first. Don’t worry, the World College Tournament forbids forbidden magic, but it doesn’t forbid magic equipment that is refined with forbidden magic. It’s safe to use the Ice Crystal Bow,” Pan Xi said.

The four disciplinary Mages moved closer and blocked Mu Ningxue’s escape, leaving her trapped on the bridge.

The pedestrians close to the bridge started to gather in a circle after noticing what was going on. However, one of the disciplinary Mages showed a document to the Mages that were on duty to maintain the order in Venice, telling them that they were arresting a betrayer of their clan, and they were already been granted permission by the local government.

The Mages on duty surrounded the bridges, but they did not intervene.

The Mu Clan was incredibly powerful, that they could even legalize a battle taking place in a city. They could even accuse Mu Ningxue who did not even do anything of being a criminal, and lie to the others that they were simply arresting her!

“So, what does it feel like to have nothing left?” Mu Tingying laughed recklessly.

She had been waiting for this day for a very long time. To her amusement, Mu Ningxue had always treated Nanrong Ni as her friend, when she was actually her enemy. Since the Nanrong Clan had attached themselves to the Mu Clan, the clan’s board had agreed to grant them the Ice Crystal Bow!

Mu Ningxue’s hard work over the past ten years was only a gift to be given away!

“The truth is, even if your family wasn’t involved with the Black Vatican, you would have ended up the same way in order for our clan to persuade the Nanrong Clan. Our clan is never short of young, talented Mages, but having an ancient, mysterious clan joining us is like adding wings to the clan! You thought you were the chosen one of our clan, yet you’re only a gift that was wrapped up elegantly!” Mu Tingying was laughing so hard that she could no longer stand straight.
