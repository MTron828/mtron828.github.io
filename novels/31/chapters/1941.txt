“Yeah, my life will really be in danger if I tell you. I’m not like Xinxia, who’s protected by the strongest knights in the Parthenon Temple. I basically became Wen Tai’s illegitimate daughter after she came here. The way they treated me changed entirely,” Asha’ruiya declared.

“What else do you know?” Mo Fan asked.

“My goodness gracious, do you want me to give you his address, phone number, and hobbies, too?” Asha’ruiya replied cheekily.

Mo Fan could only smile awkwardly. It was already a surprise that Asha’ruiya was willing to give him the killer’s name right away.

Now that he knew who the culprit was, he was not going to get away, especially since the Queen Bee of Revenge was still tracking him down!

“You can figure out a way to get rid of Spectre. I don’t think it’s going to be difficult for you guys, but I suggest you not look into the matter any further...” Asha’ruiya said.

“Because of the person’s background?” Mo Fan asked.

“It has nothing to do with his background. I just have a feeling that the person is extremely dangerous. Mo Fan, I see you as a friend, so consider this a friendly reminder from me,” Asha’ruiya told him.

Mo Fan stayed quiet.

Asha’ruiya was obviously not going to tell him who the person that actually wanted Mu Bai dead was. She had also hinted to Mo Fan that Spectre was not the person who wanted Mu Bai dead. Spectre was only an assassin.

Their only option was to get rid of Spectre, who was threatening Mu Bai’s life, then wait until Mu Bai was awake so he could tell them who actually wanted him dead!

The question was... would Mu Bai actually wake up again?

Mo Fan went to the sacred mountain early in the morning on the following day.

Xinxia was already waiting. Her previously flushed face seemed a little pale. She must have spent the whole night trying to figure out a solution.

She had even put on a little makeup. She was just as gorgeous as ever, yet Mo Fan felt sorry for her. He gave Xinxia a huge even though they were people around him.

“Brother Mo Fan, his condition is even more complicated than I thought before...” Xinxia went straight to the point, as she knew Mo Fan was dying to know the answer.

“What’s wrong?” asked Mo Fan.

“Based on Mu Bai’s condition, I won’t be able to bring him back to life even if I became the goddess and mastered the real Spell of Resurrection,” Xinxia said.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan exchanged glances with one another in shock. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

What exactly was going on? How was Mu Bai beyond redemption after a single night?

If even a candidate for the role of the Goddess in the Parthenon Temple could not save Mu Bai, he would be Sealed forever in the ice cocoon!

“Xinxia, are you sure about that?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm!” Xinxia nodded.

“I...I guess that can’t be helped,” Mo Fan let out a sigh.

“Brother Mo Fan, the ancient Greeks have a saying about death. Everyone’s final destination has already been decided when they are alive, whether it’s going to Heaven or Hell. As a matter of fact, Hell isn’t just a fictional place where people suffer because of the sins they have committed when they were alive. It’s a place that actually exists, called the Dark Plane,” Xinxia told Mo Fan.

“Dark Plane? Does that have anything to do with curing Mu Bai?” Mo Fan was confused.

“I’ve read some documents about the Dark Plane. It’s an independent plane from our world, parallel to the Summoned Beast Plane. The creatures in the Dark Plane can live forever, but they aren’t able to reproduce. They have their own hierarchy of species and ranks there... Normally, the Dark Plane has no affiliation with our world, but ever since the invention of Dark Magic, humans have been obtaining energy from the God of Darkness. The Dark Plane has been exchanging resources with us ever since the God of Darkness granted humans access to Dark Magic,” Xinxia said.

Zhao Manyan was totally puzzled after hearing her words, but Mo Fan was able to understand some of them since he was a Shadow Mage.

“The God of Darkness has countless avatars spying on our world. His sub-selves will drag the souls of those who have died to Dark Magic to the Dark Plane at times to replenish the number of denizens of the Dark Plane,” Xinxia went on.

“Brother Mo Fan, the Spell of Resurrection is powerful because it can reconstruct a dying person’s flesh. Most people’s souls will still wander in the living world and remain on certain objects, but there’s one scenario where the Spell of Resurrection won’t work: when the person’s soul is chosen by the God of Darkness’ avatar...”

Mo Fan had never heard anything like this before. Xinxia must have read some confidential secrets about Dark Magic!

“You’re saying that Mu Bai has been chosen by the God of Darkness’ avatar?” Mo Fan blurted out. He roughly understood what Xinxia was trying to say.

“Mm, he has died to an Undead Spell. Even though he isn’t completely dead yet, he’s already on the very edge. As soon as he dies, his soul will be dragged into the Dark Plane and become an entity there,” Xinxia stated.

Zhao Manyan was utterly dumbfounded.

Why did it sound so bizarre? He knew the souls of some people could stay behind because of hatred and resentment. They would turn into vengeful spirits, but he had never heard of souls being dragged into another realm called the Dark Plane!

“The God of Darkness didn’t grant us Dark Magic out of kindness. It’s constantly taking fresh blood into the Dark Plane through our deaths,” Mo Fan murmured.

He had always thought the Dark Magic was not as simple as it seemed. The leaders in the Magic Association must know this too, yet they simply ignored it because humans were too weak. Humans needed the Dark Magicks! If Dark Magic was forbidden, the overall strength of human Mages would drop significantly!

“I still don’t understand,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Old Zhao, you must have heard of Yama, the King of Hell before, right?” Mo Fan asked him.

“Of course,” Zhao Manyan said.

“The God of Darkness is like Yama. He now has his eyes on Mu Bai. He was going to make Mu Bai his envoy after he died. In other words, Mu Bai is currently on Yama’s wanted list, so Xinxia’s Spell of Resurrection won’t work on someone who’s already dead in Yama’s eyes,” Mo Fan explained.

“Damn, that’s a thing!?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Mo Fan would also have thought it was ridiculous if he did not practice Dark Magic. However, after he learned about ancient Greece, and the undead in Egypt and China that were unknown to the general public, Mo Fan believed the God of Darkness did exist, and so he also believed Xinxia!
