“Monster, don’t you dare hurt her!” yelled Hirose.

However, apart from Sound Magicians, the shouts of a human were as weak as the squeaks of a little mouse to the sea demons, almost negligible considering how soft they were, and their poor hearing in the air.

Hirose immediately controlled the water around him when he saw the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast almost catching up to Mu Ningxue.

The water turned into a huge wave under Hirose’s control, pouring down fiercely like a waterfall.

The attack did not inflict any damage on the savage Blue Valley Ferocious Beast, but it successfully infuriated the creature. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The remaining eyes of the creature almost poked out of their sockets, glaring at Hirose, who was like a clown in its eyes.

The creature raised one of its sharp legs and stabbed it at Hirose with great force. He could not even see the attack, but the huge crack across the building was telling him a deadly attack was coming right at him!

The sharp leg pierced through the spell that Hirose cast, penetrated the building in front of him and hit his right shoulder with its sharpest point.

The attack was initially aimed at Hirose’s heart. Although the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast looked enormous and fierce, it was incredibly precise with its attack, planning to stab and kill Hirose instantly with its sharp leg.

Hirose barely reacted by dodging aside when the sharp leg landed on his shoulder. As the creature pulled its leg back, blood poured out from the cut and scattered over the debris on the ground...

Hirose clenched his teeth. He did not make any noise despite the enormous pain.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s attack was simply too fast. Hirose did not even have time to summon his armor.

“Run away, quick!” Hirose pressed his hand on the cut, yet it did not stop the blood from pouring out between his fingers.

Mu Ningxue did not notice Hirose until now, but she did not respond to his shout.

Run away? Didn’t he see she was already trying her best to run away?!

The problem was, the creature was a lot faster than a Wind Magician. It was impossible to escape from the creature unless she was able to fly into the air with a pair of Wind Wings.

“Freeze!”

Mu Ningxue saw half of the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s body was still submerged. She drew close to the surface of the water and tapped the surging current softly with her foot.

The splashing waves turned into ice. The surging current calmed down suddenly as a layer of frost gradually covered the surface...

The frost spread further into the water. The layer of ice was almost instantly half a meter deep.

The ice continued to spread rapidly. It first covered an area within a few dozen meters, but it soon spread more than a hundred meters away.

The mist covering the area was a result of the water vapor from the continuous splashing of the waves, and it gradually turned into snow falling from the sky.

The snow fell densely and the water was frozen into ice. Mu Ningxue had utilized her Domain. Only the power of a Domain was able to freeze the whole place in such a short amount of time.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was initially slightly intimidated when it saw the thick layer of frost approaching it.

During their last encounter, it was turned into an ice statue by an arrow after it had underestimated the power of the Magician. It had yet to fully recover from the injuries, and now the strong frosty aura had appeared once again. It was afraid that the Magician would fire the same arrow at it.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast stood two hundred meters away and took some time observing the area. Only Commander-level creatures would act so cautiously.

A while later, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast finally dared to move forward after realizing that the aura of the Magician was not as strong as it was before.

The thick layer of ice did slow it down, yet it only needed to smash its way through the ice. It was nothing difficult for it.

Meanwhile, as the ice grew thicker, the Fierce Shark Demons’ movements were greatly limited by the frost. The Ice Domain restricted their ability to control water, and would even freeze them into ice if they were careless.

“Phew...” Mu Ningxue panted heavily, vapor coming out of her mouth.

Normally, she would be able to spread the Ice Domain further and increase its coverage, just like how she froze the water between the islands when fighting against the Scarlet Soaring Demons. She managed to turn the entire sea close to the Scarlet Soaring Demons’ nest into an island of ice.

However, the arrow she fired not long ago had drained away too much of her energy. Even though she was able to unleash her Ice Domain, its effects had been greatly reduced. She could not help but feel worried.

“This is a great chance for you, isn’t it?”

Mu Ningxue was frowning when a strange voice entered her ears.

The voice was very clear, as if it was speaking right beside her ears. Even the furious roar of the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast and the sound of everything freezing nearby failed to cover it.

Mu Ningxue looked around, but she did not see anything nearby.

“After Japan, one of you will eventually be replaced, and it’s most likely going to be you!”

The same voice spoke again. It was impossible to identify if the person was a male or a female. After hearing it again, Mu Ningxue realized that the voice was not talking into her ears, but it was right inside her mind.

It was similar to the transmission of a Psychic Magician, delivering a message into her mind without actually talking.

“Who are you, why are you talking to me!?” Mu Ningxue was instantly wary.

“Look at the creature in front of you, do you really stand a chance? If you force yourself further, you might die, and even if you manage to survive, you’ll still be kicked out of the team. Are you seriously going to accept that? No one knows the pain you’ve endured, and no one has ever feel compassionate toward your condition...

“This is a great opportunity for you. The girl is poisoned, it’s not bad news, it’s a blessing from the Heavens for you.

“If you do nothing and withdraw your petty Domain, I can let the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast chase after the cat demon that took its eye instead. You’ve tried your best, she was just being unlucky, that’s all.”

The voice was soft and gentle, like a mother whispering her child to sleep. There was no need to think or do anything, but close the eyes and fall asleep.

Mu Ningxue felt dizzy. A strong hint of fatigue struck her like the huge tide that had swamped the East Maritime Fortress.

– No, no way...-

“What exactly are you!? Stop saying those disgusting words, and you better hope I don’t find where you’re hiding. I’ll let you vanish from the world!” yelled Mu Ningxue furiously.

The yell seemed to have shattered the strange, evil voice immediately, allowing Mu Ningxue to reclaim her thoughts mind.

The voice had taken her by surprise. The frost that took Mu Ningxue a great effort to produce had weakened significantly. Meanwhile, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was also running toward her after realizing that Mu Ningxue was unable to fire the arrow that had frozen it before!
