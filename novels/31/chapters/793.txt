As Mo Fan recalled it, he believed that he would have trouble grabbing the woman’s boobs with a single hand. If he dug his face into them, he would most likely suffocate!

As for her lower body, the curves of her waist and pelvic were extraordinarily elegant. The tenderness and gloss of her skin made her visually exhilarating. The excitement simply surged through his cells, as if they were going to raise their flags and revolt, just so they could all move onto her body.

However, honestly speaking, if Mo Fan knew he would be dangling on a tree by the edge of a cliff, with a magic formation above him that could easily shred him into ashes, he would be more than willing to give up on the alluring encounter!

Damn it, he knew the woman was not something he could handle easily!

“Say, do we really have to sneak in through here? Aren’t you a member of the Mochizuki Clan that protects the Twin Guardian Towers? Why do we have to climb the cliff instead of taking the drawbridge? I can feel my legs weakening!” Mo Fan lifted his gaze and looked at Mochizuki Chihaya, who was standing on the top of the pine tree.

Mochizuki Chihaya’s legs were right above Mo Fan. Luckily, she was not wearing her kimono. Otherwise, Mo Fan would have seen it all from his angle.

Mochizuki Chihaya was wearing a black outfit. The soft cloth was wrapping her figure tightly. Her body ratios, which could only be found on characters in an anime, were even more alluring. Mo Fan believed that it was a waste for her to become a Magician. She should learn from the great teacher Sola Aoi and service the millions of disciples of the Right Hand Religion, benefiting mankind.

“The fact that I’m a member of the Mochizuki Clan is exactly why this is the only way for us to sneak into the East Guardian Tower,” answered Mochizuki Chihaya.

“Do we really have to go in there?” asked Mo Fan.

“There’s no other way!”

“Just let me apologize, I know it’s my bad sneaking into your room like that...”

“Don’t you ever mention it again!” Mochizuki Chihaya’s tone was murderous.

Mo Fan immediately shut his mouth.

That’s right, Mochizuki Chihaya was settling the dispute by asking Mo Fan’s help to sneak into the East Guardian Tower.

Even though Mo Fan had no clue what was happening inside the East Guardian Tower, he was sure that Mochizuki Chihaya was very concerned about the person who had the same Soul Seed as hers.

The security of the East Guardian Tower was extremely tight, not to mention the terrifying magic formation protecting it. Mo Fan never thought he would be dragged into this mess just because he was curious once.

Forget it, he had already seen the woman naked. It would not hurt to go on a crazy adventure with her. Otherwise, how would he possibly survive the night?

“Since we’re sneaking in, aren’t you going to tell me something? Like who the person that uses the same Demon Tree as yours is? Why did he kill the guards? Why is the East Guardian Tower off-limit, like they were doing some secret experiment in there?” said Mo Fan.

Mochizuki Chihaya did not answer. She stood on the tree with her eyes closed. She was using a spell to control the vines growing along the cliff.

The vines served as a ladder for them to climb. The whole mountain was protected by the invisible magic formation. A bird that stopped on a rock poking out from the wall would be scorched within an instant. If it weren’t for the fact that Mochizuki Chihaya was extremely familiar with the magic formation, there was no way they could sneak into the East Guardian Tower.

“When you cross that spot, stick closely to the rocks,” Mochizuki Chihaya specifically reminded Mo Fan who was climbing up the vines behind her.

“Why aren’t you sticking to the rocks?” asked Mo Fan.

“I’m skinnier,” answered Mochizuki Chihaya unpleasantly.

“But your boobs and ass are huge...”

“What did you say!?”

“I said, you should be more careful too!”

Mo Fan stuck closely to the jagged rocks. He felt like the world’s greatest thief trying to avoid the infrared sensors inside a museum.

He had witnessed how terrifying the magic formation was in person, so he was particularly cautious when climbing up the vines. Even though the alluring buttocks were right within reach of his arms, he did not dare to lose focus. After all, he had to stick right along the cliff as he moved up. If he kept staring at her derriere, he would have difficulty sticking close to the rocks, since his size was around eighteen centimeters...

The East Guardian Tower was shrouded in darkness. Not a single light was on. It was so dark that the structure almost blended into the darkness. Even the light of the stars and the moon could not reach it.

The two climbed up the steep rocks along the cliff behind the East Guardian Tower. They could already see the base of the tower.

“The walls of the tower are protected by magic formations, too. They would burn my plants instantly if they made contact with the walls. I sensed the Shadow Element when you snuck into my room. You can cast Fleeing Shadow, which is why I didn’t notice you at first, correct?” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

“Well...” Mo Fan did not want too many people to know that he had more Elements than he should.

“I’m not interested in other people’s secrets, but you’ll need to use Fleeing Shadow to move into that spot and throw a rope down for me to climb up,” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

Mo Fan had no choice but to follow her order.

He let go of the vines. His shadow immediately stuck closely to the walls of the tower and glided upwards.

The wall of the tower was quite tall, like a huge dam. A human was tiny like a fly compared to it.

The shadow moved closer to a spot above the base of the tower. It was a gutter facing the cliff with nowhere to stand. Mo Fan had to fix the end of the rope into a hole to barely make it possible for someone to grab onto it.

The night breeze swept past. The perfectly straight cliff looked eerily spooky. A rope was dropped down from the back of the tower to the rocks.

Mochizuki Chihaya grabbed the robe and swiftly climbed up. She soon reached the gutter where Mo Fan was.

“There’s a vent above us. We can climb into the East Guardian Tower from there,” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

“I’ve already helped you to reach here, I’ll leave the rest to you... just put down that Demon Tree, fine, I’ll follow you inside.”

“What’s with all the nonsense!?”

—

The vent was extremely narrow. Luckily, Mo Fan was able to cast Fleeing Shadow, or he would be stuck inside the vent. Meanwhile, Mochizuki Chihaya had no problem climbing in since she was skinnier.

“Can you now tell me what exactly is in this East Guardian Tower?” asked Mo Fan.

“You really want to know?” asked Mochizuki Chihaya in return.

“Are you kidding, I’ve already snuck inside it!”

“It’s Japan’s S-Class Prison.”

“A...a prison?” Mo Fan almost dropped his jaws to the ground. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mm, a place where all the world infamous criminals are kept.”

“Criminals like murderers and drug vendors?”

Mochizuki Chihaya shook her head and said, “Everyone in here is an evil Magician who has killed more than a hundred Magicians on average!”
