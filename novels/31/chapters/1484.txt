1485 Indoctrinating Mo Fan

Translated by XephiZ

“How bold of you to utter such disrespectful words as a student! It seems like the Pearl Institute only taught you how to use magic, but they didn’t teach you how to respect the elderly!” Headmistress Perry took a step forward.

As she landed her foot, Mo Fan immediately heard the loud chime of a bell in his mind. He was in such pain that he felt like his head was about to explode. His thoughts were in such a mess that it was extremely difficult to even think. He barely remembered why he was standing here enduring the great torture in the first place!

Headmistress Perry’s gaze sharpened. She took another step forward. Mo Fan felt like the images around him had shattered into pieces. He was falling endlessly into a bottomless abyss. The sense of falling inflicted enormous fear on him!

Headmistress Perry’s cultivation was devastating. Her two mere steps had shattered Mo Fan’s Will, forcing him to submit to her. He was on the verge of losing consciousness. If he kept enduring the pressure forcibly, he was going to suffer a mental breakdown!

“There are always people like you, who are so full of themselves just because of some mere achievements! I believe Dean Xiao of the Pearl Institute will be very grateful to me. He will thank me for teaching you how to lower your head in humility no matter how strong you are. I have taught you the true way of survival, to assess your capabilities and act accordingly instead of acting recklessly!” Headmistress Perry halted her steps and rebuked coldly.

“Stop... uttering nonsense. Keep going, I’m going to spit on you when you stand in front of me. That’s the only kind of respect you are worthy of!” Mo Fan lifted his gaze. He still had no intention of backing off!

Having extra Elements had granted him a stronger and firmer Will. As long as he did not give up, his body and mind would have no problem enduring the pressure. The pressure from Headmistress Perry was significantly greater than the pressure he had felt from Faerun Waterfall, but it did not necessarily mean he would compromise. The greater the pressure from a stubborn tyrant was, the more tenacious Mo Fan’s relentless Will of the Demon Element was!

Headmistress Perry was enraged and humiliated. Normally, whenever she was rebuking a student, no one ever dared to talk back to her, let alone scold her!

She could not care less anymore. She kept walking toward Mo Fan. The pressure from her continuous steps was overwhelming. Mo Fan immediately felt like the sky was collapsing and the ground was cracking. He felt like he had turned into a dust particle floating endlessly in the universe.

He could no longer feel his body or consciousness. He was as insignificant as a mayfly. He felt like he had lost the meaning of life!

The mind could bear terrifying power. When Mo Fan was caught by Scorpion Lord Medusa’s stare, he had experienced immense torture and pain inflicted on his mind. These attacks not only originated from the pain inflicted on a person’s soul, but the ability to manipulate a person’s sense of time too!

There were different levels of pain. Even the slightest pain would be unbearable if it lasted for a few months, a year, ten years, or a hundred years!

The pressure Mo Fan felt from Headmistress Perry was twisting his sense of time, putting him into an endless loop. It was a never-ending torture where he could not see the sunlight again, the highest level of mental attack. He had experienced it facing the Scorpion Lord Medusa and after jumping into the Dark Abyss!

If it were Mo Fan’s first time wandering in the dark, cold universe like a mayfly, he would soon lose his mind and faint, losing his determination and unyielding spirit. He would completely forget his guilt and promise to Li Yu’e. All he would think of was freeing himself from the torture.

However, after experiencing the stare of Scorpion Lord Medusa, Mo Fan’s will was a lot stronger than before. Otherwise, he would not have had any chance of crossing Faerun Waterfall so easily!

Headmistress Perry’s mental attack was weaker than the Scorpion Lord Medusa’s stare. The stare was so strong that it could make a person deny their own existence and seek their own destruction. Meanwhile, Headmistress Perry’s mental attack could only make her target suffer endlessly...

It was nowhere near enough to overwhelm Mo Fan’s Will!

Mo Fan’s eyes sprang open, lightning bursting out of them. He was using his gaze to tell Headmistress Perry that her self-assumption of her superiority was a meaningless fantasy, too. It was nowhere enough to force him to compromise and submit to her!

“Headmistress Perry!” a teacher blurted out. She could not afford to watch any longer.

Headmistress Perry had unleashed all her aura. It was so strong that some of the patrolling Magas had almost suffocated. One of them with slightly weaker cultivation had even fainted and fallen to the ground.

“Such a weakling, and you call yourself a student of the Alps Institute!?” Headmistress Perry yelled furiously when she saw her student falling to the ground first.

She was targeting the outsider that dared to challenge her authority with the mental attack. She was focusing the attack on him, yet someone other than him had fainted instead. Did she even train hard enough?

She did not stop. If she stopped now, it would mean she had failed to punish the misbehaving student. How could she possibly fail to administer a proper lesson? She could turn the worst students into courteous, well-mannered students...

Headmistress Perry’s eyes were as sharp as the scorching sun. She had started using a Psychic attack!

Mo Fan was no longer floating in the void. The Psychic attack and the enormous pressure had shoved him into an illusionary world that Headmistress Perry had established.

In the illusion, Mo Fan’s thoughts were as naive as a kid. Whenever he uttered something inappropriate, a huge ruler would fall from the sky and smack him...

“Stop it!” A familiar voice appeared as Mo Fan was going to lose himself in the illusion.

Mo Fan woke up from the illusion. He looked at Headmistress Perry in disbelief. His face was soon filled with contempt and disdain.

“You even used your Psychic Magic and placed me in an endless loop. Headmistress Perry, I now realize how you have forced every student to be so well-behaved...” Mo Fan grinned, staring at Headmistress Perry.

“Mo Fan, are you alright?” Professor Li and Professor Zheng quickly went up to Mo Fan.

Headmistress Perry did not withdraw her aura right away. Professor Li and Professor Zheng had to unleash the aura of their Domains to counteract it!

“Let’s calm down, I always believe it’s important for a student to have the right attitude instead of outstanding performance. Your student here might be very impressive in terms of cultivation, but his attitude desperately needs a reform. He will easily go astray if you don’t discipline him strictly. It’s not that much of a problem for an ordinary person to go astray, but he’s a very talented Mage. He will bring nothing but disaster to the world. Consider this a lesson for you, you won’t be leaving my Alps Institute empty-handed,” Headmistress Perry’s tone shifted to placid calm.

Mo Fan was confused about how she was able to change so quickly, as if she was a completely different person. She was acting like she had done it merely for educational purposes!

“Headmistress Perry, I can understand if you try to apply some pressure on my student with your aura, but how could you use the Psychic Element? Did you really just use the Psychic Element on a student? Don’t you know the damage it can cause to a student’s mind?” Professor Li was infuriated.

Even if Mo Fan was being disrespectful, he would at most utter some unpleasant words, yet this Headmistress Perry had to go as far as using magic on him? A Super Mage like her, using the Psychic Element on a student who was only an Advanced Mage?

“I was just teaching him a lesson. I know what I’m doing. It’s what I normally do to students who are too stubborn to admit their wrongs,” Headmistress Perry said.

“Headmistress Perry, your Alps Institute has seriously broadened our eyes. We will never use magic to discipline our students, especially the Psychic Element!” Professor Zheng was angry too.

“Her way of teaching is forcing others to submit to her will and ideas. She is basically crushing a person’s innate character, turning the students into puppets and machinery... no wonder all of you did not have any common sense at all. No wonder you insist on forcing an innocent new student to be the scapegoat! Impressive, you’re so impressive! You describe yourself to be as sacred as the snowy mountain, but you are worse than the latrine pits and broken wells in the city in my eyes. At least they can still water the vegetables, but the vegetables are going to rot if we watered them with your blood!” Mo Fan grunted.

Headmistress Perry’s nose shuddered after hearing the words.

Unforgivable, unforgivable!

This guy had just compared them to the water in latrine pits. They lived on the sacred Alps and were accompanied by the purest snow all the time. They were well respected by the world, and many people were honored to even visit the Alps Institute, yet the guy described them as the water in latrine pits!

Most infuriatingly, the guy had undergone such a strong mental attack, so how was his tongue even more vicious after suffering the attack!?

“Mo Fan, forget it, we are leaving. We will tell the dean everything that happened here!” Professor Zheng lost his temper, but he knew they were in someone else’s territory. It was meaningless to stir any trouble here!

“Using the Psychic Element on students to indoctrinate them? Only your own students can tolerate such nonsense. I would like to ask the World College Institute if it is violating human rights!” Professor Li condemned.

“Do whatever you want, it’s none of our business! Goodbye!” Headmistress Perry said.

Professor Li and Professor Zheng gave Mo Fan a hand when they saw he was unable to walk properly. He was already in such a state, when his mental strength and flesh were stronger than normal people. If it was anyone else, it would most likely turn them into a human vegetable!

It was impossible to heal the damage inflicted on a person’s mind. They could only bring Mo Fan out of there and tell the dean and the school what happened. Headmistress Perry was too strong and powerful. They would not be able to do anything here.

“We can’t leave yet!” Mo Fan stated.
