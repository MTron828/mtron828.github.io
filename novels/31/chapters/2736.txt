Chapter 2737: Onwards to Licheng Afterglow Island

Apas decided to stay away from Mo Fan. He was like a faulty, high-voltage electric box that could occasionally cause an electric leakage and shock anyone near him. But she didn’t leave him. She needed to keep an eye on him so that he didn’t hurt others with his lightning.

It had not been easy to save the people in the fortress from the lightning disaster. She did not want these people to be wiped out just because Mo Fan could not control his lightning magic.

Apas sat at the edge of the bamboo bed. Mo Fan was motionless. Apart from the occasional flash of white lightning on his skin, he slept like the dead.

Apas was bored. She found a pen and drew on Mo Fan’s face. The European Three-eyed Snake King had an eye on its forehead. So Apas drew an eye on Mo Fan’s forehead. She thought he possessed a similar temperament to the Three-eyed Snake King.

Apas then painted Mo Fan’s lips black-purple. Now he looked like those evil and wild but charming male concubines found in snake temples.

The sky was dark, and flaming-red lightning arched across it. The light occasionally reflected on the stone courtyard. The front door was open, and the bamboo bed was visible.

On the bamboo bed, an enchanting snake woman knelt over the figure on the bed. She appeared bold and yet shy, like how she used to be when she spent the night with her husband in the past.

The snake woman was thrilled. She was very pleased that she could do whatever she wanted to the motionless man before her. After all, Medusas were dominant women.

The young Medusa enjoyed her freedom. She could finally release all of her pent-up frustrations. After drawing on Mo Fan’s face to her satisfaction, Apas took out her phone and took a picture of his face. It would act as leverage in the future.

...

Mo Fan was famished when he woke up. He rushed out for some food. Fortunately, the fortress had plenty of food. There were elderly men at their stalls selling noodles and bread in the morning.

“Master Mo Fan, you’ve woken —Oh my!” Fang Xiong patted Mo Fan’s shoulder. When Mo Fan turned around, Fang Xiong was shocked. Fang Xiong soon understood the situation.

He cleared his throat awkwardly. “Master Mo Fan, you are masculine and dominant on the outside. But things are completely different behind shut doors, huh? I used to be forced to submit to my woman, too. No shame in that, of course. But I always resisted although I enjoyed it very much… physically.”

...... Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Mo Fan was puzzled. He ate his noodles while listening to Fang Xiong tell him about his dilemma of balancing his own bizarre hidden desire and acting macho.

“Since a great man like you don’t mind showing it to the public, there’s no reason for me to suppress my desires either. I’ll try it out next time. I’ll ask my woman to tie me up, or better yet, chain me. Eh, Master Fan, don’t go! Since you have no qualms showing this side to the public, I think it’s fine for me to share with you my side of the story. Eh, you’re my idol now! We relate to each other so much!”

Mo Fan ignored the lunatic. Others, who were having their breakfast, kept glancing at him and giggling. Who would have expected a tough and rough man like Fang Xiong to have such a hidden side?

Mo Fan realized that the people around him still glanced at him and giggled as if he was no better than Fang Xiong.

‘Are they laughing at me?’ wondered Mo Fan. He looked at his reflection in a mirror. Mo Fan was red in anger. ‘That snake woman is asking for trouble!’

Mo Fan would spare her no more. If he did, she might make him walk on his hands next!

Soon, a loud, crisp sound spread throughout the stone courtyard followed by a woman’s reluctant grunts. The noise was out of place in the morning.

“He really has good stamina. Last night, they were already going at it. And in the morning again?” muttered Liu He, who stayed next door. She sat by the window resentfully.

...

The fortress was not very big. The day before, Mo Fan had entered this city with the majesty of a god. He had gained the respect of the citizens. The next day, it had all fallen apart. Although the people did respect him, they seemed to be trying to maintain a kind front towards him.

He couldn’t believe it! Apas had single-handedly smeared his reputation he had tried so hard to build! Fortunately, no one knew who he actually was. Otherwise, he would find the remaining statues and destroy them so that the entire place was wiped away.

He could not stay at the fortress for long. He was relieved that the barrier had loosened but he still would need an auxiliary means to break through that layer.

Little Loach had transferred a new energy supply to his Summoning Element a while ago, allowing his Summoning Element to advance to Super Level. If he did not acquire another set of auxiliary means, he would have to entirely rely on Licheng Afterglow Island or the totem.

The fortress was safe. So, it was time for Mo Fan to find Licheng Afterglow Island and settle some things with the b*tches who had fooled him by taking advantage of his sincerity and kindness.

“Let’s go to Licheng Afterglow Island!” Mo Fan summoned an Elf Moon Dragon and prepared to leave the fortress with Apas.

Elf Moon Dragon was from the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower. It had part of the Moon Dragon bloodline. Its wings were transparent, and its body looked as if it was made entirely of crystal. It looked more like a creature straight out of a fairytale.

Aside from its aesthetic appearance, it had no other useful purpose. It couldn’t even be used in battle. Mo Fan had summoned it because it was a master of camouflage. He needed to make sure he wasn’t discovered as he dove towards Licheng Afterglow Island.

After reaching Super Level and opening the ancient magic portal, Mo Fan realized that he could use his Summoning Element to open wider portals. If he encountered anything that was too powerful, he could always summon creatures to fight for him.

“How did you locate Licheng Afterglow Island?” Apas asked in confusion.

“Look into the water.” Mo Fan pointed at the surface of the sea.

The surface of the sea was light gray. The lightning had not entirely disappeared. It caused the tides to become very turbulent. The waves crashed against each other and continued to rise higher.

Apas’ golden-pink snake pupils lit up. It was only then that she noticed an almost invisible creature swimming in the sea water.

That creature was a long and slender sea lion. It had an anchor-like tail. It looked like a servant-class or warrior-level creature. In the eyes of a high-class bloodline like Medusa, Apas did not find that creature to be of any worth to her. However, when she studied the creature carefully, she noticed that the anchor-tailed sea lion was strange. It was making a huge effort to hide itself.

“Didn’t I ask the Bewitching Female Spider to watch out for a headless sea lion? This is it,” Mo Fan said.

“I was sleeping, so I have no idea what happened,” Apas said.

“It killed one of my dimensional beasts, and it nearly killed Old Wolf. While we’re chasing after the b*tches from Licheng Afterglow Island, I’ve asked Little Flame Belle and Old Wolf to settle an account with it at Mingwu Ancient City. The anchor-tailed sea lion was aware that it was no match for Little Flame Belle, so it begged her to let it go and that it would help her find a certain spiritual land,” Mo Fan said.

“And that spiritual land is Licheng Afterglow Island? Are you sure?” asked Apas.

Mo Fan nodded.

Never in their wildest dream would the women from Lincheng Afterglow Island expect the anchor-tailed lion sea to expose their sacred land.

‘Running away from me, huh?’ thought Mo Fan. ‘I will see where else you can run and hide. Even without the pathetic sea lion, I will still move heaven and earth to dig you all out!’
