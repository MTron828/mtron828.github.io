Chapter 2347: Darkness vs Light

“Lightning Element, Fire Element, Shadow Element, Space Element…” White Leopard kept watching Mo Fan, figuring out the Elements he was using.

Ice Tiger was treating his wounds with an Ice Gem. He was fortunate that his brother owned a valuable magic artifact that was effective at treating injuries inflicted by the Fire Element, or the burns would have kept spreading and torturing him for months. Certain Fire Mages could even leave burns that would slowly kill their enemy, much like poison!

To his relief, the young man’s flames did not possess such an ability…

“Brother, something doesn’t feel right. He was also using the Chaos Element. I clearly saw a Chaos Vortex!” Ice Tiger reminded his brother.

White Leopard was stunned.

That’s right, he did use the Chaos Element!

Five Elements?

Was the guy a Forbidden Mage? Otherwise, how could he have five Elements?

White Leopard shook his head. There was no way he would believe Mo Fan was a Forbidden Mage. A Forbidden Mage could easily turn the tide of the war around!

“He must be using a special piece of magic equipment to grant him the power of the Chaos Element,” White Leopard speculated.

“Brother, I don’t think these people can stop him.”

“Why are you being so impatient? Didn’t you see the Heavenly Sensei’s man is already on the move?” White Leopard pointed out.

There were plenty of soldiers in the camp. They could easily wear out a whole platoon of enemy soldiers with their numbers, let alone a single Mage!

Wolf Chief was waiting close to the lava scars. He shared the same thought as White Leopard, planning to let the soldiers serve their purposes as cannon fodder.

Unlike White Leopard, he was also constantly looking for an opportunity to strike at Mo Fan. Mo Fan would eventually expose himself when fighting so many Mages at once. All he needed to do was take Mo Fan’s life with a single blow once he was unable to defend himself.

Unfortunately, he and White Leopard had overestimated their elite soldiers’ strength. The soldiers had failed to force Mo Fan to use any of his trump cards. The battle had become a one-sided slaughter!

“General White Leopard, why haven’t the army sent stronger troops to take him down?” Wolf Chief demanded.

“Aren’t they on their way?” White Leopard pointed at the camp.

A group of Mages in brown armor was swiftly approaching from the camp. They were led by none other than the Super Light Mage with a thick beard, Damon!

Damon chuckled coldly when he saw the area covered in darkness.

He lifted his hand and Summoned a sacred light to drive away the darkness. It instantly removed the darkness that was suppressing the company of elite soldiers.

The elite soldiers who were screaming in agony were finally freed from their horror, like the sunlight had finally pierced through the dark clouds after a heavy rain. It felt great being able to see the sky again!

“Humph, so it’s you!” Damon stared at Mo Fan. He could smell the aura of Shadow Magic on Mo Fan.

His senses were on point. Someone did infiltrate their camp. Damon even felt sorry for the man for invading their main camp!

—

Mo Fan was also looking at Damon.

The guy was obviously a passionate leader of the Brown Rebels. He could not care less about Mo Fan’s identity or goals. In his eyes, anyone who broke into their camp must die for trying to stop them from fulfilling their ambitions!

“The cat will always be the cat in a game of cat and mouse!” Damon drew closer to Mo Fan while tossing out light spheres from his fingers.

The light spheres were bouncy. They flew into the darkness and drove away the Shadow Magic there before bouncing to the other areas with the presence of Shadow Magic.

They were like a group of Light Hunters hunting down Shadow Elves. Damon’s appearance had completely uprooted the seeds of darkness Mo Fan had planted across the area.

“You are overestimating yourself,” Mo Fan grinned when he saw Damon’s arrogant attitude.

Shadow Magic normally needed time to slowly conquer its surroundings, like a flock of bats hiding inside a cave, waiting for the sun to set in the west.

However, that was the?old?limit of Mo Fan’s Shadow Magic!

After obtaining the Dark Vein, Mo Fan was like a huge carrier of darkness. Even if the darkness had not spread across the area and the place was brimming with light, it would never penetrate and drive away the abyss of darkness inside Mo Fan’s body! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Dark Execution Ground: Guillotines!” a cold voice spoke in the minds of the elite soldiers who had been freed from their nightmares. Their bodies trembled as they lowered their heads and saw chains around their feet, while they were fixed onto black guillotines.

Merciless sharp blades fell from above their heads at the same time!

The sound of a few hundred crisp cuts combined into a loud and clear blast of sound. Heads scattered across the ground!

Headless bodies tied to dark chains began to struggle fiercely, as if they were finally reacting after losing their heads so quickly.

The sacred light shining upon the area had become a spotlight for a dark opera, merely highlighting the gruesome sight.

It was meant to be a purifying spell of the Light Element, effective against darkness and every presence of evil!

Damon shuddered after he witnessed the deaths of the soldiers.

They were murdered right under his Light Magic!

It was no different from committing a crime in front of an inspector, or inflicting a foul act on one’s wife in front of their husband. It was an utter humiliation!

How bold of the young man!

Mo Fan’s actions had infuriated the Super Light Mage, especially since it took place right in the Brown Rebels’ camp.

The Brown Rebels would have blasted the disrespectful scoundrel into pieces by now if they had not sent most of their strong Mages to the front line!

—

Mo Fan had displayed the true strength of his Shadow Magic. His darkness was competing with Damon’s light like equal rivals, instead of the relationship between a cat and a mouse!

Strong darkness had always been on equal footing with light!

“Brother, why isn’t his Shadow Magic suppressed by Damon’s Light Magic? Is his Shadow Magic Heaven-grade too?” Ice Tiger exclaimed.

Not only was his Fire not weakened by Ice and Water, his Shadow was able to challenge Light, too!

“A Super Power of the Shadow Element, that guy has Awakened a Super Power! No wonder he was able to sneak to the back of our camp without alerting anyone…” White Leopard frowned.

This enemy was a lot stronger than he had imagined.

“Seriously? How many abilities does he have!?” Ice Tiger trembled in fear.

“That’s why you shouldn’t go all out before knowing your enemy’s capabilities, understand?” White Leopard scolded him.
