Chapter 2757: The Moon Moth Phoenix And The Green East Sea God

“I’m different from them,” Song Feiyao emphasized her words.

“Then, try to act like it. Let the Green East Sea God come with me. We need to find other totem beasts through it,” said Mo Fan.

Song Feiyao hesitated. She was unsure if she could trust the man before her. But he did sound like he had a better understanding about the Green East Sea God than her.

“Show me the way,” said Song Feiyao. “I am not handing the Green East Sea God to you until you can prove that I can trust you with it.”

“Of course, I’ll prove to you that you can trust me.”

...

Mo Fan led the way. With the help of the magical tool—Black Dragon Wings, Mo Fan flew several thousands of kilometers within a short period of time.

It was midnight. Bone-chilling breeze continued to blow from the sea area to the dry land. Regardless of whether it was summer or spring, it always seemed like winter was around the corner. They felt freezingly cold. Ice began to form even in the warmest part of the abandoned city.

Mo Fan noticed on his way that most of the city was in such a state. The situation was dire. He wondered if Commander Hua had made any substantial progress and inflicted severe damage to the Ocean Godly Horde. He believed the end of the days on the east was the day the Ocean Godly Horde army surged to the east coast.

Mo Fan led Song Feiyao toward Flying Bird Base City. By midnight, they reached Yu Shishi’s Spirit Moth Mountain Forest. The mountain forest still hadn’t regenerated from the damage it had taken in the war not so long ago. Some areas were still bare.

The Green East Sea God made a sound. Some dim light glowed visibly in the middle of the dark blue mountain forest under the reflection of moonlight. The dim light was everywhere, like the mountain forest leaves. The light gradually appeared from the trees and jungles, forming a dimly lit Galaxia in the middle of the dark sea of mountain forest. It was serene and beautiful, like a fairyland night view.

Song Feiyao, on the other hand, frowned. She felt that it was more like a trap set up to besiege her. However, the Green East Sea God did not show any hints of suspicion. It continued to make sounds toward the gorgeous Spirit Moths. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A soft response rang out in return. The dazzling Moon Moth Phoenix gradually flew up to the sky from the Galaxia. Moon Moth Phoenix was responding to the Green East Sea God. It fluttered its illuminating wings and flew toward the Green East Sea God with surprise and curiosity.

“Mo Fan, what’s happening?” Just then, a woman with a pair of moth wings flew to the sky like a night elf. She saw both the Green East Sea God and Mo Fan.

“It’s a totem beast, the Green East Sea God. It belongs to the same lineage as the Moon Moth Phoenix,” explained Mo Fan to Yu Shishi.

Yu Shishi’s eyes lit up. She jumped onto the Moon Moth Phoenix’s back and flew up to the sky.

The Green East Sea God was majestic and magnificent. Each of its feathers gave off a striking lightning power. It contradicted greatly with the Moon Moth Phoenix’s gentleness. However, when these two totem beasts appeared in the night sky, the Green East Sea God’s majesty and Moon Moth Phoenix’s holiness matched perfectly. There was no sign of discrepancies in their bloodlines.

The Moon Moth Phoenix had grown up. It was no longer as frail and tiny as it was a few years ago. If all of its totem beast power was awakened, it could draw closer to other totem beasts.

“Are you a Totem Guardian, too?” asked Yu Shishi after she noticed Song Feiyao.

“I-I…,” Song Feiyao was at a loss for words.

“Yu Shishi, let’s go to the West Lake. I’ve informed the rest to gather there,” Mo Fan said.

“Okay.” Yu Shishi nodded. She believed Mo Fan and trusted him in his endeavor to find the rest of the totem beasts.

The Moon Moth Phoenix was a friendly totem beast. Its gentleness soon made the Green East Sea God let down its guard.

The Green East Sea God had been enslaved and chained for many years. Even though it had regained its freedom, it was filled with anger and hatred. If not for the fact that Song Feiyao had come from Licheng Afterglow Island with it, it would have crushed the entire island in its resentment.

The Green East Sea God met with the Moon Moth Phoenix. The Moon Moth Phoenix’s serene aura gradually dissolved the Green East Sea God’s resentment. Most of the totem beasts were spiritual creatures. They understood one another.

When Song Feiyao noticed the Moon Moth Phoenix’s unique spirit rhyme, she also began to let down her guard. After all, the fact that the Moon Moth Phoenix could relieve the Green East Sea God’s hatred showed that the Moon Moth Phoenix was trustworthy.

Moreover, the Green East Sea God and the Moon Moth Phoenix communicated in a very special way. They whispered to each other. Even though they had never seen each other, they communicated like close friends.

The Moon Moth Phoenix was happy. It flipped its crystal-clear wings and flew around the Green East Sea God. It left shiny frost with its tail over the area it brushed past. It took several seconds for the shiny frosts to disappear from the air.

The Little Spirit Moths sensed the Moon Moth Phoenix’s happiness. They flipped their wings and flew out of the jungles. The Little Spirit Moths flew gracefully like glowing leaves. They flew around the Moon Moth Phoenix and the Green East Sea God in the night sky, as if putting on a starry night veil for the night sky. The view was simply breathtaking.

“We’re leaving soon. Go to rest now… Oh, I forgot! You are night creatures. Go on, then.” Mo Fan waved his hand and bade farewell to the Little Spirit Moths.

Mo Fan continued to lead the way while the Green East Sea God and the Moon Moth Phoenix flew together side by side. The two totem beasts were practically entwined with each other, as if they had known each other since birth. Whenever Mo Fan turned his head around, he felt a sense of discomfort while being reminded that he was still single.

“Don’t get too close with each other. Based on the analysis of the sacred totem beasts, there’s a high probability that both of you are siblings,” Mo Fan said to the Moon Moth Phoenix and the Green East Sea God.

Yu Shishi rolled her eyes at him.

...

When they arrived at Hang Zhou, Mo Fan asked the Green East Sea God and the Moon Moth Phoenix to suppress their imposing totem beast aura to prevent disturbing the citizens. They carefully flew past Hang Zhou. Still, Mo Fan sensed someone was watching him from the city.

They were in the war era. The existence of two powerful creatures in the sky above Hang Zhou would certainly alarm some old mages. There was a chance that some of these old mages might be Forbidden Mages, and the Magic Association kept their identities a secret.

The Forbidden Mages were present in every base city in case the Ocean Demons launched sudden attacks. There were many common citizens around, hence the Forbidden Mages tried not to reveal too much of themselves. They would not simply show up and fight unless it was an emergency.
