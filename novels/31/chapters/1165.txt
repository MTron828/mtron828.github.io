“Why am I considered rebelling when I was only mentioning a past incident? Or perhaps the Holy Judgment Court knew it was a mistake all along, but in order to protect its reputation, it has forbidden others from mentioning it?” Song Qiming harrumphed coldly. He did not hesitate to accuse Dulanc in return.

Dulanc’s expression darkened. He said, “It seems like you’re determined to protect them, but I’m telling you, they still are going to die. The Holy Judgment Court has never wrongly accused anyone. Calling us unjust is nothing but a one-sided statement!”

Song Qiming kept quiet. After all, it was true that he wanted to protect Mo Fan and Xinxia. He was extremely familiar with Mo Fan’s personality.

“Captain of the Golden Sun Knights, what are you waiting for? Why aren’t you taking down the prisoner’s accomplice? The Holy Judgment Court has the right to execute the prisoner on the spot. If he dares resist, you have the right to execute him!” Dulanc declared.

The people nearby were startled by his words. Many had learned that Mo Fan was the hero of the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, yet Dulanc was not showing any face to China by giving the order to execute Mo Fan on the spot.

Normally, the Holy Judgment Court would only detain the offender and ask China’s Enforcement Union to send their representative over to decide how they would deal with the offender. However, regardless of how infuriated the Enforcement Union was, they would surely be merciful considering Mo Fan’s contributions. Dulanc was not willing to let Mo Fan go!

“Dulanc, what do you think you are doing!?” Song Qiming snapped.

“What am I doing? I’m just doing what a Great Magistrate should do. If you try to defend them, I’ll treat you as their accomplice too!” Dulanc said.

“Old Bao, it’s meaningless to talk with someone like him.” Mo Fan understood Old Bao’s intention. He wanted to argue in favor of Xinxia, hoping that someone reputable would step forward and question the verdict, so they could further investigate the matter.

However, Mo Fan knew it was unlikely, judging from the Great Magistrate’s reaction.

Mo Fan was observing the situation calmly. Somehow, he felt that the Great Magistrate was very eager to sentence Xinxia to death. What exactly were the benefits tied to the conspiracy that they had to go to such extremes?

—

Mo Fan felt a great pressure directed at him. He lifted his gaze and saw a man with a malicious grin approaching him.

“Yafa, he hasn’t left the hall, you are not allowed to do any harm to him,” Glorkian said.

“The Great Magistrate has already given the order, I’m just following it. It’s quite obvious that he’s trying to save the prisoner!” Yafa continued forward.

He was very curious where this Advanced Mage had gotten the courage to dare provoke the crowd. He could not even defeat the weakest Golden Sun Knight with his petty strength!

“Mo Fan, don’t come out!” Tisu warned.

As long as Mo Fan did not bring Xinxia out of the hall, no one would do anything to him. Mo Fan’s status had risen too far. Even the Great Magistrate would be punished if he abused his power!

“I’m leaving with her. If any of you try to stop me, I won’t show any mercy!” Mo Fan said coldly.

Mo Fan stepped out of the entrance after finishing the sentence.

He was holding onto Xinxia tightly. He walked down the stairs under the crowd’s stare. The Golden Sun Knights nearby were at loss. Perhaps they were confused by the incident too, and could not believe the kind-hearted Xinxia had suddenly turned into a murderer and a Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican.

“You are too full of yourself. It doesn’t matter if you’ve won the World College Tournament, you’re nothing but a little ant in our eyes!” Yafa shouted furiously.

Magnificent Star Constellations appeared around him. Seven of them combined into a brilliant Star Palace containing an overwhelming amount of energy in front of Yafa.

“Thousand Leaves Saber: Slaughtering Wind Slash!”

Fierce golden winds, like giant scythes, swept at Mo Fan from all directions.

The golden scythes combined into a giant scythe as tall as the Saintess’ Hall. It came down rapidly, aiming right at Mo Fan and Xinxia!

Mo Fan calmly faced the Super Spell. He was holding an orb covered in ancient runes in his hand. He tossed the orb into the air when the Slaughtering Wind Slash approached him.

A huge mist instantly spread across the place, limiting the vision of those watching. A faint, black outline appeared in the mist, before growing rapidly...

The stairs at the entrance of the Saintess’ Hall were soon fully occupied. The Golden Sun Knights surrounding Mo Fan and Xinxia realized that something was not right. They quickly fled into the distance.

Yafa’s Slaughtering Wind Slash landed on the enormous figure in the mist, yet it did not seem to inflict any damage on it. Mo Fan and Xinxia were behind the black figure, and perfectly unharmed!

Yafa stood still, staring at the mist that was expanding and dissipating into the surroundings. He saw a pair of huge, terrifying eyes in the mist, and immediately felt a great chill running down his spine, as if he was soaked in icy water.

“What...what on Earth is this thing!?” Yafa screamed.

As soon as he cried out, an enormous head poked out from the mist. Instead of doing anything fancy, it simply opened its mouth and swallowed the arrogant Yafa with a single bite! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even the Vice Hall Master of the Hall of Judgment subconsciously took a few steps back. The two hundred Adjudicators behind him were stunned, too. Why would such an enormous creature appear out of nowhere in their Parthenon Temple? Was it a Tyrant Titan?

The entire mountain top was in an uproar. The mist continued to expand, and almost reached the gloomy sky. A bolt of lightning swept across the pallid sky as a huge rain started pouring down.

Strong winds followed the rain, blowing the colorful, soaked petals into the air. It was a spectacular yet uneasy sight.

As the rain poured down, the people were finally able to see the true appearance of the creature.

It was a Skyscraping Snake. The mist had prevented the people from seeing its entire body, but the head of the giant snake head had risen above the curtain of rain. It was staring down at the people on the mountain coldly.

“My...My God!”

“It’s a snake!”

“A Ruler-level creature, it must be a Ruler-level creature! How did it appear in the Parthenon Temple!?”...

The people were all crying out in shock. Even though there were quite a few Super Mages on the mountain, not many had seen a creature of the Black Totem Snake’s level.

A Ruler-level creature?

The Black Totem Snake was no ordinary Ruler-level creature! When he revealed himself and stared at the humans on the mountain, he was like an icy Snake God. His pride and dominating aura completely overwhelmed the hearts of the Mages on the mountain!

The Black Totem Snake slowly opened his mouth and spat Yafa out.

In a short time, the previously imperious Golden Sun Knight ended up falling to the ground in ragged clothes. It was like the creature was provoking Great Magistrate Dulanc on purpose. Yafa, covered in sticky gastric fluid, had landed right at his feet...

Dulanc’s face began to twitch when he saw Yafa trembling on the ground!

This Mo Fan had come prepared!

“The Mountain of the Goddess is well-protected. Even a Commander-level creature was not allowed to enter, let alone a Ruler-level creature. Is this snake Mo Fan’s Summoned Beast? Otherwise, how did it appear out of nowhere!?” The Hall Mother said.

“I saw a Totem Orb just now. Totem Beasts are able to hide inside Totem Orbs whenever they encounter danger. I believe Mo Fan did not accept the challenge of the Starry Mountain Path just so he could see Xinxia. He was planning to bring the Totem Orb into the Mountain of the Goddess too!” Mellaura said with a dark expression.

“It’s only a huge snake. How dare it behave unscrupulously in the Parthenon Temple? Shawshank, lead your men and kill the snake!” Dulanc snapped furiously.

He could not care less about the snake’s background. Anything that dared to challenge the authority of the Holy Judgment Court would die!

—

The Black Totem Snake slowly lowered his head to the ground, allowing Mo Fan to hop onto his head while carrying Xinxia.

The Black Totem Snake had a little hollow on his head. It would protect Mo Fan and Xinxia from the effects of spells.

Mo Fan gently placed Xinxia inside the hollow, but he stayed on the outside.

“He’s going to protect us, don’t worry,” Mo Fan knew Xinxia was extremely terrified. He forced a smile and comforted the girl.

The Black Totem Snake slowly raised his head. Mo Fan stood on it amid the rain and the drifting petals, and glanced down at the crowd.

“Mo Fan!”

“You’re out of your mind!”

Haylon pointed at the head of the Black Totem Snake and yelled angrily, “Are you seriously going against the Parthenon Temple!?”

The people below the mountain could also see the enormous snake at the top of the mountain. They were immediately struck with terror, as the previous Tyrant Titan was like a little finger compared to the skyscraping snake!

Mo Fan had made up his mind. He was going to bring Xinxia away today!
