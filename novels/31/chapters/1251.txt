After going back to the Magic City, Mo Fan was wondering if it was possible to construct Dean Xiao’s Water Circulation Magic Formation in their new territory. Wouldn’t it significantly increase the safety of the area?

He would have to give the Earth Pistil back to Advisor Shao eventually, but Mo Fan would only feel relieved if Fanxue Mountain had a barrier protecting it. After all, Feiniao City was constantly under the threat of sea monsters, and it was unlikely that Mu Ningxue could recruit enough people to protect the land for a short period of time.

Having this thought, Mo Fan visited Tongxiang again to check on the progress of the Water Circulation Magic Formation.

To his surprise, Cao Qinqin came looking for him after he had just arrived.

“So this is your mentor?” A man in casual clothes, wearing the badge of the Magic Association, glanced up and down at Mo Fan in disbelief.

Mo Fan looked far too young to be a mentor of the Pearl Institute.

“Yeah, didn’t you say you have something important to talk to him about? Sir, they are from the Magic Association’s Research Union,” Cao Qinqin said.

“Oh? What is it?” Mo Fan did recall receiving a letter sent to his apartment. He vaguely remembered that it was from some Research Union of the Magic Association. The letter told Mo Fan to pay them a visit, but Mo Fan had completely ignored it.

Apart from a summons from the Enforcement Union, Mo Fan could not have cared less about the other departments of the Magic Association!

“I’m a committee member of the Research Union under Donghai (East Ocean) Magic Association, the highest Magic Association of Asia, Ke Lingxi. We heard that you are the one that let the moth woman that we’ve been trailing for some time escape?” the lofty man said.

“What do you mean by that?” Mo Fan demanded, displeased when he sensed hostility from the man’s voice.

“Humph, what do we mean? The moth woman is an eccentric being that we’ve been investigating for a long time. She’s very important to us, yet you’ve let her go instead! We are now having a hard time tracking her down. Who gave you the right to make the decision? You’ve ruined our important experiment!” Ke Lingxi snapped at him.

Mo Fan’s eyes widened when he heard the man’s accusation. “Who the hell cares about your experiments? I can let anyone go as I please. I suggest you leave if you have nothing else, I have no time to waste with the likes of you!”

“What’s with that attitude? We are under the highest Magic Association of Asia; every Magic Association in Asia is obliged to conform with our instructions and investigations. I now order you to track the moth woman down, or we won’t go easy on you!” Ke Lingxi frowned and ordered him angrily.

“Don’t force me to ask you to piss off!” Mo Fan returned coldly.

“How dare you disrespect our Magic Association at your age? You should know that the Research Union has the right to deprive a Mage of their cultivation!” Ke Lingxi threatened him.

“An imbecile like you dares to threaten me? Even if you are a member of Asia’s Magic Association, I’ll beat the crap out of you so badly that your mother won’t even recognize you, let alone the f**king organization that’s attached to it. Leave before I get mad!” Mo Fan was fed up by these people who kept thinking they were superior just because of their positions.

1Did they seriously think they could point their fingers around just because they belonged to a committee of the Magic Association?

“You’ve asked for it!” Ke Lingxi’s face went dark. He had never seen such a disrespectful kid. He would not mind venting his frustration on him!

Layers of frost appeared on Ke Lingxi’s body, soon turning into ice spikes surrounding him. The number of ice spikes was shocking. They looked like arrows bundled together, their tips pointing at Mo Fan.

Ke Lingxi did not attack right away. He let out a hollow laugh and said, “This is my Sharp Ice Domain. Do as you are told and find where the moth woman is, it will save you the trouble! Our Research Union focuses on the invention of magic. Without us, there wouldn’t be any magic equipment or magic barrier. It’s because of us that you’re able to live comfortably in the cities, instead of facing the starving demon creatures!”

“Piss off!” Mo Fan immediately unleashed a fierce ring of flames. He had enough of the man’s constant nagging.

The Ardent Sunset’s flames were utterly imperious. The heat immediately turned Ke Lingxi’s Sharp Ice Domain into water vapor. The flames extended out like a rug and burned vigorously under Mo Fan’s control.

“You...you dare attack members of the Research Union!” Ke Lingxi’s eyes widened. The two men he had brought along were dumbfounded too! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They were being harsh toward Mo Fan after seeing how young the man was, and how he had messed up their experiment. The Research Union never bothered paying any respect to young, inexperienced Mages.

Ke Lingxi initially thought the kid would wet his pants after unleashing his Sharp Ice Domain. To his surprise, he was miserably driven a few steps back by the young man’s flames instead.

“You have really gotten on my nerves!” Fiery dragons were rolling on Mo Fan’s fists. The three members of the Research Union quickly summoned their defensive Equipment to resist the Fiery Fist.

To their surprise, Mo Fan’s Fiery Fist was stronger than a normal Advanced Spell after the added imperious power of the Ardent Sunset. It ended up knocking the three men flying!

Ke Lingxi was the strongest among the three, but they were all burned by the scorching heat. Their flesh blistered as they stood amid Mo Fan’s flames with twisted faces.

The Magic Association had always been the one that dared to use magic against other Mages. Was the kid out of his mind to cast such a strong spell at them!?

“Kid, you’re dead, you’re dead for sure!” Ke Lingxi pointed at Mo Fan and swore.

“You just go back and train for a few years before saying that. I don’t understand why a piece of trash like you dares to act so full of yourself in front of me!” Mo Fan harrumphed coldly.

He initially thought the members of the Research Union were strong, but he had left them in such a miserable state with a single punch. How amusing!

“Icebound Coffin!” Ke Lingxi yelled, casting the Advanced Ice Spell.

Ke Lingxi had a Domain. The Icebound Coffin he summoned was surrounded by the same ice spikes from before. They flickered coldly as the Icebound Coffin descended from the sky. Cao Qinqin quickly hid in the distance when she saw the men were serious about the fight.

Mo Fan did not try to dodge as the Icebound Coffin descended with its spikes. The ground below his feet cracked apart as scorching flames burst out like a wild geyser.

A thick burning pillar rose into the sky. Mo Fan remained under the pillar. The wild flames punched through the Icebound Coffin and instantly melted it!

Even though the Ice Element and Fire Element were effective against one another, it solely depended on which side was stronger. The stronger side would always overwhelm the weaker side.

It was obvious that Mo Fan’s Ardent Sunset was stronger than Ke Lingxi’s Domain. Ke Lingxi had never fought against anyone with such unstoppable flames. His Ice Element was completely useless!

Ke Lingxi did not attack again. He muttered petulantly, “We will report your misbehavior to the Magic Association. The Enforcement Union will deal with you!”

“If I were you, I’d just tug my tails between my legs and leave. You’re so weak!” Mo Fan spat back disdainfully.

Ke Lingxi was so mad that his face was twitching.

The Research Union mainly focused on inventing and improving magic. They were more like builders, armor forgers, or formation constructors. Their cultivation was not weak, but their fighting ability was significantly weaker when compared to the Enforcement Union.

However, they were the ones that started the fight. They had no choice but to swallow the humiliation!

They were not in a rush to get their revenge. The other departments of the Magic Association would occasionally ask the Research Union for favors. They had the right to send out members of the Enforcement Union, too. This man was going to pay for what he did!

“Let’s go!” Ke Lingxi left with his two subordinates.

They were injured and their clothes were ragged. They had completely lost their arrogant bearing.

One of the men whispered, “How is this kid so strong!?”

“It seems like he’s really a mentor of the Pearl Institute...”

“Humph, I don’t care who he is; anyone that goes against the Research Union will suffer!”

—

Cao Qinqin only dared to come up to Mo Fan after the fight ended. Her eyes were glittering like stars, with a strong hint of admiration.

Mo Fan’s fire was just too outstanding. Cao Qinqin did not have a chance to observe it closely when he was battling against the moth woman. She finally had a chance to see the Ardent Sunset in person this time. The flames with the color of the sky at sunset, with an overwhelming heat that could even set the sky on fire!

“Sir, you’re so strong. What training did you normally do? You’re perfectly synchronized with your fire! Can you control it as you wish?” Cao Qinqin asked excitedly.

“Too many questions, and stop bringing weird people to me,” Mo Fan snapped.

“Oh, I didn’t know they were trying to stir up trouble. The Research Union is an impressive department of the Magic Association, how are they weird? I’ve graduated, but I haven’t found an organization to join yet. I’m thinking of joining the Magic Association, but I’m not even qualified to be an intern,” Cao Qinqin said.

“What’s the Donghai Magic Association about?” Magic Association asked.

1“Sir, are you being serious? The Donghai Magic Association is a branch office of the Asia Magic Association in our country. It’s only inferior to the Dongfang Oriental Magic Association!” Cao Qinqin said.

“I didn’t really have much business with the Magic Association. By the way, you’ve been around for quite some time. Have you learned how the Water Circulation Magic Formation works?” Mo Fan asked.

“Only the basics, I’m quite interested to learn more about it. If I can master the art of constructing a magic formation, I believe I can become a well-respected Mage... Unfortunately, I’m just a student. The mentors aren’t willing to share the essence of the magic formations with me,” Cao Qinqin grumbled.
