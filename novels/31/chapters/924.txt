“No...no way, how did they survive it?”

“Holy crap, if I took that punch, I would have died eight times in a row, yet these maniacs from England are still alive!”

Wasn’t the English team’s defense a bit too impressive to be true? An Advanced Water Spell, Water Curtain, an Intermediate Light Spell, Light Protection: Sacred Shield, and three sets of Magic Shields. Their teamwork was absolutely stunning!

If only one of the three representatives of the English team had summoned their Shield, Mo Fan’s punch would still have been able to crush their defense, yet they somehow stacked the three shields together...

Everyone sighed. It wasn’t like Mo Fan was not strong enough. It was just that the members of the English team were too good, and were well-trained, too!

“It’s not done yet!” Mo Fan suddenly oared. As he landed on the ground, the wings behind him extended along his shoulders, with the feathers scattering across the place.

Thousand Piercing Fire Feathers!

The flames from the punch were still burning, but hundreds, maybe even a thousand fiery feathers, were already flying toward the three members of the English team.

The feathers exploded in waves, long-lasting flames surging at the three members of the English team before they could prepare themselves.

They had to Summon their Magic Armor in a panic, right after they used their Shields!

The defense of different sets of Magic Armor was almost the same. The good ones usually cost a fortune. As such, even among the members on the national team, it was unlikely that anyone would spend lots of their resources on Magic Armor, since it was not as reliable as their own cultivation.

Apart from Ayleen’s red-green Armor that actually protected her from the explosions, the other two were injured after the explosions tore their Armor apart...

“I...I can’t hold on any longer,” Sade’s primary element was Summoning. He immediately jumped down from the stage when he found himself in a disadvantageous position.

The explosions were still continuing. If he stayed on the stage any longer, he would soon be burned badly. He did not want to suffer serious injuries in an unimportant battle like this, as it would surely affect his cultivation if he had to rest in bed for some time.

The other teammate had trouble resisting the explosions, too. The damage of the Thousand Piercing Fiery Feathers was even higher than the Fire Sword when they were focused on just a few targets. It was unlikely that a set of Magic Armor was enough to defend against it.

As for the golden-eyed Ayleen, her Armor was obviously of superb quality. The explosions of the Thousand Piercing Fiery Feathers only managed to leave some scratches on the Armor instead of inflicting any real damage to her. It turned out that this Ayleen was the strongest of the four representatives.

After two of her teammates withdrew from the stage, she was the only one left on her team.

As the smoke finally dispersed, Ayleen seemed to have gone through a lot of hardship. Her beautiful hair was disheveled now.

Despite that, she retained her graceful demeanor and said, “I had heard that the Chinese Training Hall had a very talented candidate. I suppose it’s referring to you, but to be honest, you’re even stronger than I imagined.”

“Two on one, you have no chance of winning, just surrender,” replied Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had revealed all his trump cards today. It was not a good thing for him, since they would have to meet again during the finals at Venice. Most representatives were unwilling to show their true strength so early, but Mo Fan was left with no choice. He had to defeat the English team if he wanted to rejoin the national team!

“Not necessarily,” Ayleen tied her hair back, displaying her stunning face. Her golden eyes were remarkably attractive, highlighting the beauty of a foreigner.

“Don’t be like that, it’s just a friendly match. Just let us win, it doesn’t benefit any of us if we show all our trump cards here...” replied Mo Fan.

Mu Nujiao immediately rolled her eyes. Their opponent had obviously decided to take the battle seriously judging from her words, yet was he seriously trying to convince her to surrender like that!

“You still have other trump cards?” Ayleen blinked, looking surprised, and intrigued.

“Of course, just ask any person you stumble into in China what kind of a Magician I, Mo Fan am! I know you still have moves that you haven’t used yet, but it’s clearly not wise to go all out here... and besides, we still have two people on our side,” said Mo Fan.

Ayleen looked at Mo Fan and fell into deep thought.

The crowd watching the duel was left speechless. Was Mo Fan seriously asking his opponent to surrender? Was that even allowed?

“Alright, losing a stamp doesn’t really matter to us. I believe you will surely join the national team, let’s have a rematch when the time comes,” Ayleen agreed.

Saying this, Ayleen walked down the stage under the crowd’s astounded gaze, indicating that she had conceded the duel.

The atmosphere exploded instantly!

“Did...did that really work?” Dongfang Lie, still in great pain, screamed out excitedly.

“We won? Did we win?” Mu Nujiao stood stock still in shock. It took her quite some time to recover from her astonishment.

Mu Nujiao seriously thought Mo Fan’s asking their opponent to surrender was utter nonsense, yet the golden-eyed girl was even more unreasonable!

Anyone could easily tell that she was the strongest among the four representatives on the English team. However, apart from casting the Water Curtain twice, she basically did not use any of her other spells. She even managed to block Mo Fan’s strongest move. As such, her strength was surely even more outstanding than what she had shown. However, Mo Fan managed to convince her to surrender when everyone thought she was about to fight back fiercely...

Not only were the defenders left utterly speechless, even the people on the English team looked totally stunned!

“I’ll buy you some delicious food later, authentic Chinese delicacies, hehe!” Mo Fan smiled. He suddenly found this golden-eyed Ayleen fairly interesting.

“Sure, I really like the food here!” Ayleen’s eyes sparkled. From her Chinese outfit, it was easy to tell that she was quite a fan of the Chinese culture...

“Ayleen, are you sure about that?”

“Did he really convince you like that?”

Ayleen glared at the people talking to her. They immediately shut their mouths despite having conflicting thoughts in their minds.

-Alright, you’re the little princess, whatever you say...-

Either way, their team was not worried that they could not make it to the finals at Venice. Having one less stamp did not really make any difference.

That being said, they were indeed surprised by Mo Fan’s outstanding strength. It was quite shocking to find such a strong Magician at a Training Hall. It went without saying that he would surely join the national team. As such, he would eventually become an opponent worthy of their extra attention!

“Grandpa, I think they won,” exclaimed the girl with a ponytail.

Feng Li slowly closed his mouth. Even he was unable to say anything about the duel.

Mo Fan’s strength was absolutely shocking, without a doubt. Even a strong team like the English team had trouble resisting his Rocket Wings Fiery Fist, followed by the Thousand Piercing Fiery Feathers!

If the guy was a little bit more disciplined, Feng Li would surely have complimented him for his performance.

“It’s surprising to see how strong he is now...” Dean Song He fondled his beard.

It was very impressive that Mo Fan was able to win against the English team, not to mention that he basically led a team consisting of mostly peak Intermediate Magicians and won against a team of Advanced Magicians!

Feng Li walked down from the spectator seats and came up to Mo Fan.

“Are you going to stay here, or move your ass back to the national team?” Feng Li asked in an unpleasant voice.

“Don’t be so harsh, of course I’m going back to the national team. An old man like you shouldn’t be pulling a long face all the time. You look like everyone in the world owes you a few hundred million,” replied Mo Fan.

“Where are your manners when talking to a senior!?”

“Grandpa, look, I wasn’t the only one telling you that, you shouldn’t be pulling a long face all the time, hehe!” the girl with a ponytail giggled.

Feng Li had totally lost his temper in front of his granddaughter. Knowing that Mo Fan had earned some glory for their Training Hall, he decided not to be too fussy about how Mo Fan demanded to leave the national team without his permission.

“Pack your stuff, we’re going to South America in a few days,” Song He said to Mo Fan with a smile.

Song He’s attitude was totally different than Feng Li’s. Mo Fan had no idea why the two advisors were so different in terms of temperament. One was stinky, like a rock in a latrine pit, and the other was gentle and friendly.

“Sure,” Mo Fan nodded.

Mo Fan was a man of his words. He already gave his promise to treat Ayleen to a meal, thus he brought her to a local lobster restaurant. Ayleen was hesitant when she saw the next table eating the red, spicy lobsters wildly, but when Mo Fan peeled one for her to have a try, she could not stop eating. She ate a whole kilogram of lobsters on her own, leaving chili oil all over her mouth.

“That was so delicious, I have never eaten anything like it before!” Ayleen could feel her stomach protesting. The lobsters did not have much meat, so it was quite shocking that she actually felt bloated from the meal.

Mo Fan brought the little princess from England, who was both a foodie and a thrill seeker, to other interesting places. The English team almost thought Mo Fan had kidnapped her away.

“It’s time for us to leave, the training is still a long way ahead, the next time we meet is most likely going to be at Venice. I’m looking forward to seeing your true strength,” Ayleen had totally enjoyed her time here, but still spoke to Mo Fan in a serious voice.

“When the time comes, I won’t go easy on you just because you’re a beautiful woman. Speaking of which, I’m going to South America tomorrow too!” Mo Fan clarified his stance.

“Our next stop is Japan, see you again!”

Ayleen bade Mo Fan goodbye. Mo Fan also packed up his stuff and prepared for his trip to South America early the next morning.

The lands in South America had retained their primitive appearance. The deserts, forests, and rivers still looked the same after more than a thousand years. The place was not very developed.

That being said, it was not like the humans were not planning to expand their cities, factories, and roads, but South America was actually a giant nest for demon creatures. The demon creatures there were well known for their brutality and enormous numbers!
