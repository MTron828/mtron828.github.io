Mo Fan could not react in time.

The main reason was that he had no idea what Lingling’s surname actually was. Did she inherit Old Bao’s surname, or did she have the same surname as her sister Leng Qing?

Either way, Mo Fan only knew that Leng Qing and Lingling in the Clearsky Hunter Agency were bound by blood, unlike the others.

It was common for Hunters to lose their lives while doing dangerous jobs, thus there was an unspoken rule between friends who were Hunters: if someone died while doing their job, their friends would take in their kids and treat them like their own.

It was the reason why Lingling always referred to Old Bao as her grandfather, even though they did not have the same surname.

Could Senior Hunter Leng be Lingling’s father?

It turned out that Lingling’s father was a Seventh-Generation Senior Hunter, just like Senior Hunter Xiao!

There were only two slots every ten years, and Lingling’s father had been one of them. Mo Fan knew Lingling’s father was someone reputable among the Hunters, but he did not expect him to be so impressive!

“As a Seven Star Hunter Master, you are surprisingly clueless about the Hunters’ system?” Mochizuki Chihaya giggled at him.

“It’s because she’s mainly in charge of our operation. I just have to focus on doing the dirty work!” Mo Fan pointed at Lingling.

Lingling rolled her eyes. The idiot had no idea how lucky he was to join the Clearsky Hunter Agency right after he became a Hunter!

He even had the knowledgeable daughter of a Senior Hunter as his partner!

“Here, allow me to introduce everyone,” Mochizuki Ken had brought a huge group of people over without them noticing. Everyone was holding a glass of wine in their hands.

Most of the people in the group were from different countries, but they were all Asians with unknown nationalities, except for the Middle-Easterners with their unique outfits.

“This is my granddaughter, Mochizuki Chihaya. She will be competing for the title of Eighth-Generation Senior Hunter. Please take care of her on my behalf when the time comes,” Mochizuki Ken said with a smile.

“Of course!” the old Hunters assured him in a friendly manner.

As a Third-Generation Senior Hunter, Mochizuki Ken had a great reputation in the group. His reputation even overshadowed his clan at the international level.

Mochizuki Ken pointed at Mo Fan and said, “This is Mo Fan, a Seven Stars Hunter, the one who solved the mystery of the Drowning Curse.”

“An impressive young man, the Drowning Curse was a pain to deal with. Some of us tried to tackle it, but we couldn’t figure out an entry point.”

“So he’s the one who solved the Drowning Curse. Well done!”

Everyone was eager to give Mochizuki Ken face, except for Anzark.

He was from Dubai and was a close relative of a royal family. He was brimming with a sense of superiority hat stemmed from his wealth.

“The Drowning Curse was caused by a strange species. People were over-exaggerating because they didn’t know the truth. It was nothing too special,” Anzark sniffed.

“You are saying that because your country wasn’t close to the sea. The difficulty of the Drowning Curse wasn’t an overstatement,” Mochizuki Chihaya calmly corrected him.

Japan was a country surrounded by the sea. The Drowning Curse had impacted it greatly. Certain people still claimed the Drowning Curse was the sea’s way of demanding living sacrifices from them!

Mochizuki Chihaya could not believe it when Mo Fan solved the mystery of the Drowning Curse. She was sincerely grateful to Mo Fan and had been impressed by him ever since.

She always had a good temper, but was quite displeased when she heard Anzark’s words.

Anzark was left speechless, mainly because someone else was rebuking him. He felt like he had stepped on a land mine, and did not argue further.

“Our current job is trickier than the Drowning Curse. It’s true that I didn’t know much about the Drowning Curse, but I won’t allow someone like him to get ahead of us!” Anzark promised.

“Let’s not waste our time arguing with one another. I still have no idea what our job is and who our client is. Why are we all gathered here?” Mo Fan came back to the main topic.

Lu Kun had already walked over to the group. The representatives of the rest of the Hunter Agencies were also facing him.

“Everyone, the truth is, I was hired by the client to organize you here and relay the information on his behalf,” Lu Kun announced.

“Is the client unwilling to see us in person?” Anzark asked narrowly.

“The client wants to remain anonymous due to some special reason, so I’ll be your contact person for the time being,” Lu Kun confirmed.

“Let’s get down to business. I believe Brother Lu Kun knows a lot more than we do,” Mochizuki Ken added in. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was quite normal for clients to keep their identities hidden. The Hunters were not too bothered by it.

“I’m only here to tell everyone the rules and act as a supervisor on behalf of the client. I have no idea what the job is, either. I’ll only pass the information to each of you in your rooms after dinner. Until then, I have no idea what the client wants,” Lu Kun explained with a smile.

The group was confused. Pass the information to each room?

“So everyone has a different job?” Lingling quickly deduced.

“That’s right, that’s very smart of you, little girl. Every Hunter Agency and Senior Hunter has a different job. The client also says that you aren’t allowed to tell anyone but your team members what your job is. Otherwise, the client will be taking back the deposit,” Lu Kun stated.

The Hunters were even more puzzled.

Weren’t they supposed to be tackling the same job together, if so many experts had been gathered here?

It turned out they each had a different job to do!

“It must be part of a huge operation,” Anzark was the first to speak up. “Perhaps a Forbidden Mage or someone close to that level needs a bunch of experienced Hunters to sort out the trifles for him, but we are separated to handle the jobs to prevent us from leaking the information.”

The others nodded in agreement.

Only a few people or organizations across Asia could afford to hire all of them at once. Even a formidable clan like the Lu Clan had no chance of setting something like this up!

“The deposit is a semi-manufactured Universe Vein. As we have agreed, you will be paid with high-quality Universe Veins once you finish your jobs. In the meantime, you are not allowed to tell anyone what your jobs are, nor can you intervene with other Hunters’ jobs or stalk them,” Lu Kun emphasized.

“It sounds like a big operation. A Forbidden Curse operation, perhaps?” a Hunter asked.

Lu Kun shook his head and said, “I’ve been hired, just like you. I also received the deposit. My job is to organize and supervise you, and my payment is the same as yours. I am also not allowed to ask anyone about the details of their jobs.”

“It seems like it really is a big Forbidden Curse level project, and we are its subcontractors!” Someone fully agreed with Anzark’s speculation.
