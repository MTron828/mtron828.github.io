Chapter 2904: Cultivating Sanctuary

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The sunlight was dazzling, especially when it shone on some icebergs that were like prisms. The reflected light was intensely bright. When humans bathed in sunlight for a long time in the cold, their skin felt tingly. It was a strange feeling.

They were in a cold place but could feel the scorching sun. As a result of the ice invasion, every gust of wind scraped the skin like blades. Their muscles and bones ached constantly.

“The sunlight almost makes my skin crack,” the Royal Great Mage complained.

“Ha! You should be grateful that we are here this season. If it were any other season, we wouldn’t even have the qualifications to step into this forbidden area. The area of ??the Antarctic ice will double in size, and the ice invasion will be five times more powerful than it is now. Even many Ice Beasts die that season,” Wang Shuo said.

The Royal Great Mage, Li Wenbin, looked around in confusion.

He had been feeling uncomfortable ever since he had stepped into the Antarctic Continent. ‘How could such a harsh environment be suitable for humans to live in?’ And this was not the worst-case scenario!

“I don’t quite understand what you mean. Will the climate here change?” asked Li Wenbin.

“Didn’t you notice? It hasn’t set in a long time,” Wang Shuo said as he pointed at the sun in the sky.

Only then did Li Wenbin realize that the day had been so long. Li Wenbin saw the sun hanging in the sky from a long while ago. It should have set, and the night should have fallen by now. ‘Why did it feel like the sun kept shining in the sky as if it had just risen?’

“Polar day,” Wang Shuo explained. “From here on, we won’t see the night if we don’t go back.”

This phenomenon only occurred in the Antarctic Continent and Arctic Continent. Mu Ningxue knew the principle of it.

Mu Ningxue roughly calculated the time and frowned. It was true that they would not see the night anymore, but soon, the “eternal night” would rule the Antarctic Continent.

This month was the time when polar day and polar night alternated.

The Antarctic Continent, especially the pole, would have only nightfall for up to six months. The pole and the area around the Antarctic Continent would become dark and cold like icy purgatory.

The Five Continents Magic Association and the experts of Holy City chose to fight with the Extreme South Emperor in such a month…

‘Did it mean that if they did not do anything this month, people would not even have the qualifications to step into this place for the next six months of eternal night, let alone go to the pole to fight with the Extreme South Emperor?’ Mu Ningxue wondered.

The cold was all over the world. Several important magical developed countries were over the northern hemisphere. As for the impact of the cold, the northern hemisphere would be affected more. Many countries were even constantly recruiting Fire Element Mages to relieve the freezing problem for important rivers and waterways.

“They are eager to fight with the Extreme South Emperor at the last minute. Could there be a disaster coming to the Extreme South Land in the future?” Mu Ningxue muttered to herself.

Mu Ningxue roughly calculated. More than twenty days had passed this month, and the remaining polar days were about only a week.

However, they stepped into the Antarctic Continent at this time. If they could not complete the task of this recruitment in seven days, they would face the most terrifying eternal night in the Extreme South. Only a few people could probably leave from here alive.

From the beginning, Mu Ningxue had a lot of questions, but so far, no one could tell her the truth. Even Wei Guang, who led the team, did not seem to know what they were supposed to do.

…

The two brothers, with their White Panther and Black Panther, returned. They explored a long way and told everyone with certainty that the road ahead was safe. They had checked some blind spots in the refraction area, and there were absolutely no ferocious Ice Beasts there.

As the Ice Wheel Flying Boat started to move, the ice invasion had already begun. Mu Ningxue noticed that everyone’s skin, including the Forbidden Mage Wei Guang, became extremely pale. It felt as if their blood had congealed.

“Don’t you feel cold?” Yan Lan asked in a trembling voice while wrapping herself in a magic jacket.

“I’m all right.” Mu Ningxue felt nothing.

Everyone here had been tortured by the ice invasion. They wrapped themselves in layers upon layers of warm clothes which had little to no effect. No matter how strong the sunlight was, they still felt cold. The coldness was accompanied by soreness, stiffness, and tingling all over their bodies.

However, Mu Ningxue found that the ice invasion did not seem to have any effect on her.

Everyone else’s muscles were stiff, and they were tired and weak. It was similar to how ordinary people felt after running a long distance. The only way they could recuperate was by going to the Clear Fire Formation in the Ice Wheel Flying Boat.

Everyone wished to stay in that Clear Fire Formation all the time to stay away from the torture of the ice invasion.

“You should go to the Clear Fire Formation to rest for a while. We have already taken turns to go there.” Yan Lan looked at Mu Ningxue. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Mu Ningxue had put on a jacket that could cover the whole body and wore a mask on her face which only revealed her eyes.

Yan Lan could not see Mu Ningxue’s complexion. She just felt that Mu Ningxue should go and rest for a while.

Mu Ningxue thought about it and then nodded.

…

When Mu Ningxue reached the Clear Fire Formation, she felt a bit distressful. Other people felt warm and comfortable as though they had just taken a hot bath. But she felt so uncomfortable in this hot temperature.

After reluctantly staying for a while, Mu Ningxue went out. When she walked to the deck of the Ice Wheel Flying Boat, she felt that the cold and crisp air outside was much more comfortable.

“It seems that the ice invasion doesn’t work on me,” Mu Ningxue muttered to herself.

It was probably because she suffered from extreme icy torture of the Ice Crystal Bow since she was a child, or because the ice invasion of the Extreme South and the effect of the Ice Crystal Bow were of the same type. Mu Ningxue was surprised to find that she was completely immune to the ice invasion of the Extreme South.

Mu Ningxue even felt that her body was constantly absorbing the purest ice element in this ice invasion environment and transforming and strengthening her ice ability bit by bit.

“Maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea to come here.”

For others, this place was tortured. For Mu Ningxue, who had listened to the ice and snow and felt the wind and frost, it seemed to be a rare cultivating sanctuary.

Mu Ningxue felt that her level of cultivation, which had been close to its bottleneck, was a little subdued again.

However, she would soon become a Forbidden Mage if her cultivation advanced further.
