Mo Fan could leave if he wanted, but since the Space Element and the Summoning Element needed more time to consolidate, and he was also planning to improve his Fire and Lightning Elements, meditating for a month was not enough. Besides, the mountain was quiet, and more suitable for cultivating in seclusion.

Even though Mo Fan had obtained the imprint that would double the base strength of his Lightning Spells, he was not in a rush to leave. He decided to stay here for another month and purify his magic.

The mountain was off-limits for anyone else, ensuring the national team that came first in the tournament could cultivate here in peace.

The path of cultivation had always been time-consuming and dull. After all these years, Mo Fan no longer felt the need to show his improvements to the people around him. If a person could not cultivate with peace of mind, their achievements would surely be limited.

He was already ahead of the others. If he worked even harder, it would only be a matter of time until he conquered the world!

The Flying Flower Festival was a celebration for the Parthenon Temple’s sacred mountain, but it had somehow turned into a famous festival for all of Greece.

When the day came, the thin, yellow petals and the bluish-green leaves on the sacred mountain would drift into the air every time the wind blew from the Mediterranean Sea. They would circle the peak and the waist of the sacred mountain before slowly entering the Citadel of Athens and falling into the residences and streets, setting off the unique charm of the entire city!

On this day, believers of the Parthenon Temple from across the world would come. The usually quiet Citadel of Athens would be bustling with noise. People would line up on the night before, hoping they could be the first person to enter the Hall of Faith, so they could listen to the prayers and reveal their wishes...

—

“There are people ahead of me still. I thought I would make it into the first one thousand people, but look at the number of people here! They are lining up all the way to the Ten Thousand Stairs...” an old man sighed.

“There are always people that are more faithful than us. Huh? What’s happening to the people ahead? It looks like something just happened...” An old woman stood on her toes as she glanced ahead.

The people at the front of the line were moving around, while the people at the back had filled up the entire space, making it extremely difficult for anyone to move through the crowd. The people at the front were grumbling as if they had just received some bad news.

“Time to go back, the sacred mountain is closed today!”

“Closed? Are you kidding me? We’ve come so far! We’ve been waiting since last night too,” someone complained.

“That’s the order. If you aren’t pleased with it, you can tell the Mages of Faith.”

“Seriously, why would the mountain be closed out of nowhere?”

“Who knows, perhaps something serious happened... guess we’ll have to come back again tomorrow or the day after.”

“Let’s go, time to leave... oh my, there are so many people behind us. How are we supposed to leave?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The crowd was having difficulty moving. The people that had received the news were trying to leave, yet all they could do was turn around.

Luckily, the government was in charge of maintaining order in the crowd on behalf of the Parthenon Temple. Despite how massive the crowd was, the people slowly managed to return to the city with the help of the authorities.

However, they still did not understand why the Parthenon Temple would suddenly close the mountain. The Flying Flower Festival had always been a grand festival. The mountain would only be off-limits if something extremely serious had happened. Unfortunately, the Parthenon Temple did not announce anything, and it was meaningless for the people to speculate any further.

Xinxia’s brain was hurting slightly, The pain had been around for quite a long time. She had no idea why her body was so weak, even when she was already a Mage. It was like she was unable to use the strength of her body, like she had just woken up from a deep slumber.

She opened her eyes and realized that she was not in her bed, but in her wheelchair. Xinxia finally realized that she was reading a book until late at night, and ended up falling asleep in the wheelchair.

However, she immediately noticed a pungent smell that woke her up immediately. She was surprised to see people standing around her. They were looking at her with wide eyes, and they seemed fairly alert too!

“We are seriously disappointed by your words,” the Hall Mother sighed.

“How vicious! Are human lives really so insignificant in your eyes, that you have to use such methods to eliminate anyone that is stopping you from becoming the Goddess?” Great Muse Sinsiya glared at her and snapped furiously.

“The demon’s blood is flowing in her body!”

Xinxia looked around her and discovered that all the authorities of the Parthenon Temple were surrounding her.

She was extremely calm. For some reason, she was able to remain calm despite the situation she was currently in. It felt like a dream, and she just had turned into a woman without any emotion.

She lowered her head, searching for the source of the pungent smell.

As she thought, it was the scent of blood.

Her hand, sleeves, and dress were all stained with blood. A familiar woman was leaning against the wheel of her wheelchair. The dead woman was staring at her with wide eyes, like she was struggling to believe something.

“Did...did I kill her?” Xinxia mumbled.

For some reason, she had a feeling that it was her that murdered the woman, but she had no idea why she did it. She was trying hard to recall the scene of her killing the woman.

“Did you seriously forget what you have done!?” Haylon said furiously.

“Panijia?” Xinxia took a closer look at the woman’s face. It clearly belonged to Panijia, the most merciful and kindest Saintess!

Xinxia took a deep breath. She needed some time to organize her thoughts.

“Panijia sacrificed her life to bust you out. It also helped the Parthenon Temple to prevent a great disaster!”

“How disastrous the election has been...”

Asha’ruiya was among the crowd too, protected by a few Golden-Sun Knights.

Asha’ruiya slowly walked forward and looked at Xinxia carefully.

Xinxia lifted her gaze and asked, “Is this your doing too? Should I be glad that you are treating me as a worthy competitor too?”

Asha’ruiya shook her head and said, “Are you Ye Xinxia?”

Xinxia was confused about why she had asked the question.

Asha’ruiya added, “You never knew your other identity, right?”

Xinxia looked at Asha’ruiya, not knowing what she was trying to say.

“It looks like you really have no idea. Your soul is innocent, but the other soul is unforgivable!” Asha’ruiya declared coldly.

Mo Fan went back to his country after spending two months cultivating in seclusion.

Mo Fan knew the election was still ongoing. He proceeded to visit the Three Step Tower at the Pearl Institute to achieve the second-tier of his Fire and Lightning Advanced Spells, since his cultivation had improved significantly over the past two months.

He was only able to cultivate in the Three Step Tower for a limited time. He successfully improved the Advanced Fire Spell to the second-tier, allowing him to cast the Sky-Flame Funeral: Hellish Flames.

When Mo Fan finally returned to the Clearsky Hunter Agency, he immediately went to see Lingling, to see how much she had grown.

Lingling seemed to have reached early puberty. She had grown a lot, almost reaching Mo Fan’s shoulder, and her physique was more feminine, too.

“Lingling, let’s find some work. I’m thinking of buying a magic Shield. My Departing Nether Shield is broken already.” Mo Fan’s strength had improved a lot recently, so he was eager to test it out. He believed he could take on quests with huge rewards now!

Lingling was lying on the bar table. She slowly lifted her gaze.

She had a strange look. Mo Fan was struggling to describe it, but it felt like something serious had happened.

“What?” asked Mo Fan.

“I don’t know how I should tell you... my sister will explain to you when she comes,” Lingling said.

“Why would you think that? Don’t tell me it’s your first menstruation? HAHAHA, you are officially a woman now, Lingling...” Mo Fan burst out laughing.

Lingling did not react to Mo Fan’s joke, and did not even look at him disdainfully like she usually did.

Mo Fan quickly stopped smiling after seeing Lingling’s reaction. It seemed like something serious did happen...

“You better prepare yourself for it,” Lingling said.

“Me?” Mo Fan was startled.

Leng Qing came while they were still talking.

Tang Zhong and the Elder of the Magic Court, Tang Zhong, were with her. The three of them immediately had strange looks when they saw Mo Fan.

“Something happened?” Mo Fan asked.

Tangyue nodded and sat down beside Mo Fan.

Leng Qing stayed quiet.

The atmosphere was extremely weird. No one dared speak the truth.

“Are you all just going to stay quiet?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mo Fan, we really don’t know how we should tell you. We had a hard time believing it in the first place too. It sounded very ridiculous, but when we were shown the proof, we had no choice but to accept it,” Tang Zhong said.

“Just say it, is there anything that can scare me in this world?” Mo Fan demanded.

“Salan is caught,” Leng Qing said.

Mo Fan was startled.

His first reaction when he heard the news was thinking that it was impossible.

He believed Salan was not the kind of person that would be caught so easily. The woman was so smart that she was almost not human!

“Where?” Mo Fan asked.

“The Parthenon Temple,” Leng Qing said.

Mo Fan burst out laughing. Salan was hiding at the Parthenon Temple?

They always said the most dangerous place was actually the safest place, but how did they find her?

“Don’t you want to know who she is?” Tangyue asked softly.

“Who else could she be? She’s Salan. It’s good that she was caught, but I feel like the Parthenon Temple shouldn’t come to a conclusion so soon, because the person might not be Salan. No one has seen her true face... I did hear her voice before, but there are ways to change a person’s voice. Even appearance is changeable too,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was not too excited by the news, since it was impossible to tell if the person was actually Salan.

“There’s solid evidence to prove that she is.”

“What evidence? Oh, tell me who she is first,” Mo Fan said.

The three immediately fell silent. They looked at one another, yet none of them were willing to spill the beans.

Mo Fan was amused by them.

“It’s...it’s Xinxia,” Tang Zhong finally gathered his courage and said.

The smile on Mo Fan’s face instantly vanished!

The three could suddenly feel a savage aura from the blood flowing inside Mo Fan’s body. His temperament suddenly turned extremely terrifying!
