3001 The Chosen Goddess

After a long silence, Xinxia placed her hands gently on the armrest. She ignored Izisha’s accusations.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back and rest.” Xinxia turned around and faced Izisha with her back as she said the words.

Izisha did not move. She fixed her gaze on Ye Xinxia, like the snake king from the jungle, as if wanted to see through Ye Xinxia’s soul.

Even after Ye Xinxia was out of Izisha’s sight, Izisha remained on the same spot. She gave a radiant smile in the direction of Xinxia, as if she had discovered a great secret. As she was smiling, her emotions gradually changed. She became indifferent and slightly annoyed. In the end, she looked bizarre.

Izisha never expected Ye Xinxia would be her competitor in the final stage of the election. Of course, what upset Izisha the most was the Divine Soul!

She was a former goddess. During her tenure as the goddess, Izisha had never been recognized by the Divine Soul. As a result, she received numerous criticisms during her tenure.

Even though she took control of the Parthenon Temple to the point that hardly any forces dared to go against her, everything she did that came with minor flaws would be deemed as “not recognized by God” because she lacked the Divine Soul.

She was a goddess who was not recognized by God.

She was a goddess who forced her way into that position by killing, intimidation, and power!

This was the crowd’s comment about Izisha!

On the contrary, the pious, ancient, and godly faction always praised Ye Xinxia’s insignificant deeds exaggeratedly. They praised her to the skies when she spread blessings to the temple or contributed greatly in other areas.

She was a God chosen goddess!

Given such a saintess, even gods would abandon them if they failed to worship her as the supreme faith in Parthenon Temple!

When Ye Xinxia first arrived at the Parthenon Temple, she had nothing and was just a trainee maid.

The Hall Mother and the other old sages were superstitious about the Divine Soul. Hence, the Divine Soul was the factor that had exalted Ye Xinxia to the position where she could share equally with Izisha. Today, Ye Xinxian became Izisha’s greatest competitor in the re-election of the goddess.

Izisha’s previous arrangements and sacrifices were meaningless. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She had mastered the Resurrection Divine Art.

She had engineered her own death, after which she had resurrected from the Crystal Ice Coffin. She did all this to make people aware that she had mastered the Resurrection Divine Art despite not having the Divine Soul. Her ability to resurrect from the dead was the best example.

However, when she woke up from the Crystal Ice Coffin, she realized nothing had changed.

All the Parthenon Temple cared about was the Divine Soul. It was God’s choice. They only cared about obtaining the recognition of the Divine Soul instead of that supreme divine art.

During her tenure in ruling the Parthenon Temple, those who had long dissatisfied with her finally found a way to vent their frustration, which was to provide unconditional support for Izisha’s competitor.

Izisha stood at the crossroad of the Saintess’ Hall.

She looked increasingly hideous.

She had paid an unimaginably heavy price in order to be re-elected.

However in the end, she might be overthrown by the people who expected her downfall.

She had gotten rid of her greatest threat in the world—Wen Tai.

Although Wen Tai was dead, his soul seemed to dwell in this world and manipulate everything from the shadows.

...

After Izisha returned to the Saintess’ Hall, she looked indifferent.

A female sage, Mera, walked up to Izisha and bowed to her solemnly. The way she bowed was different from usual. She bent down a lot. She was close to half-kneeling and with her face totally facing down.

“What are you doing?” Izisha frowned as she asked.

“I’m bowing to you,” said the female sage Mera with a smile.

“I know.” Izisha sounded indifferently.

She had been with the Parthenon Temple for many years. How could she not be able to distinguish the difference between the salutations? The way the female sage Mera bowed to her was a salutation shown to a goddess. The election was not over yet, before the result was released, this salutation should not appear in any occasions, including private homes.

“My lady, why do you have to be so strict? I just thought you are almost certain owning the throne of the goddess. It’s been many years since I performed the salutation. It’s getting rusty, so I practice it lest anything goes wrong during your succession ceremony. If I do it wrongly, the rest of the sages will mock me,” said the female sage Mera.

“Stop doing such meaningless gestures.” Izisha looked cool. Apparently she was not interested in Mera’s flattery.

She disliked this type of useless red tape. A person who was powerful enough to take control of everything did not care about superficial etiquette.

What she needed was everyone’s respect and fear that came from the bottom of their hearts!

“Noted, My Lady.” Mera was embarrassed. She thought she could please Izisha with her cleverness. Mera quickly switched the topic and said, “Someone sent you a lot of exquisite small jars.”

“I saw them.” Izisha saw the jars as soon as she stepped into the Saintess’ Hall. Mera arranged the exquisite small jars very neatly. This was the only thing that Izisha found pleasing to her eyes over these days.

“It has to be someone you’re very familiar with who delivered them over. The person who delivered them also made a point of explaining that the contents are stored in a sealed package. You have to personally open them. It seems like each pattern represents a different gift. I guess this old friend of yours is celebrating for you in advance,” said Mera.

Mera was under Izisha’s lead for a long time. Thus, Mera understood Izisha’s habits and interests very well.

Izisha disliked exquisite objects that most female attendants and sages did such as jewelry, expensive clothes, and luxury courtyards. She did, however, have a special liking for artistic jars with exquisite patterns and unique shapes.

The place where she lived was decorated with various flower jars, celadon vases, and antique porcelain. She replaced them once in a while.

Despite this, very few people knew about her interest. As such, Mera was confident that the artistic jars collected from all over the world were given to Izisha by someone who knew Izisha very well. Besides, that person had to be a detailed-oriented person and also cared very much about Izisha.

Izisha walked into a hall with an exhibition of flower bed. She sized one of the short, small jars up and took it. She then opened the small lid with the shape of the leaf.

She thought the jar contained some kind of exotic fragrance. However, a pungent smell filled her nostrils.

Izisha was irritated with the smell. When she looked into the jar, her expression immediately changed.

Smash!

She smashed the exquisite jar onto the floor ruthlessly. It shattered into pieces, and the gray powder inside the jar spilled out.
