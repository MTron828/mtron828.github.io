“I’m about to do something crazy. If you’re not scared, you can come with me,” Mo Fan said to Bola.

“In the world’s eyes, we have always been crazy!” Bola rose to his feet with an evil grin.

Mo Fan’s appearance had allowed the vampire to be reborn, and rebirth always took place amid flames and disasters. He would simply assume the madness was part of the disaster he had to go through!

“Are there any other demon servants like you in this world?” Mo Fan asked.

“From what I know, I’m the only one.”

“Oh, then you have a sister, starting today,” Mo Fan told him.

Bola seemed enlightened. “I would like to meet her, if we can leave this inviolable, sacred mountain in one piece.”

—

What...what is Bola doing? How could he kneel to an intruder? Is he out of his mind!?” Haylon yelled furiously.

The people of the Hall of Knights and the Hall of the Goddess were dumbfounded. The vampire that was the most mysterious among the four statues had half-knelt in front of someone, and he seemed to be following Mo Fan to the fourth statue...

No one understood what was going on. Finally, the Great Muse, Mellaura harrumphed coldly, “I always knew this vampire was not loyal to us. Perhaps he’s already thinking of rebelling, and he decided to use this chance to challenge the Parthenon Temple. We should have killed him long ago!”

Tisu, Kulun, and Fiona were dumbfounded. How did Mo Fan convince Bola to join him? They were clearly fighting one another to death just a moment ago, and Bola clearly had the upper hand.

“Humph, since he’s quitting, we’ll let Haobu kill them both!” Haylon snapped.

Mo Fan had already passed the third statue of the Starry Mountain Path. The believers and some busybodies were already stirring up chaos among the crowd. It felt like the Parthenon Temple had lost half of its reputation today.

The person who managed to defeat all four statues was allowed to meet the Goddess. Even the Hall Master of the Hall of Knights had to submit a request to the Hall Mother just to meet the Goddess in person. Once the Goddess granted her permission, he could only meet the Goddess in an official meeting, as the Great Muses would be present too. On the other hand, the person that overcame the challenge could meet the Goddess in person and alone, and the knights would have to wait outside!

The Goddess was respected and worshiped by the people. Many wanted a chance to meet her in person. If Mo Fan really overcame the challenge, or if the others assumed the Starry Mountain Path was actually not as difficult as it seemed, lots of bold challengers would come for the challenge. The Parthenon Temple would need to be renamed to Guarding Athena instead.

Mo Fan and Bola approached the final stairs. The place was extremely spacious, with thick woods on both sides and cliffs rising at the back of the woods.

There were cliffs on both sides, like it was some sort of entrance. The path grew narrower as it approached the Mountain of the Goddess.

“Where’s the last guy?” Mo Fan looked around him, yet he did not see the last statue.

Bola was on alert. He had never seen the final statue, but he had sensed its aura many times, as it was shockingly powerful.

As they proceeded forward, Mo Fan immediately saw the entrance to the Mountain of the Goddess at the end of the woods. However, a huge shadow suddenly loomed over him. His hair stood on its end after feeling an incredible pressure.

Mo Fan raised his head and saw an enormous foot!

The creature’s skin was made of white rocks. Even its smallest toe was as big as Mo Fan!

“Watch out!” Bola reacted quickly. He grabbed Mo Fan and dragged him to the side, and hid in the bushes nearby.

BANG!

Mo Fan saw the enormous foot stomping on the spot he was previously standing on with a loud blast. The ground was smashed into pieces, a shocking footprint left on it!

Mo Fan took a deep breath. Before he could collect his thoughts, the same giant shadow loomed over him once again, blocking the sunlight!

“Let’s split up!” Bola swiftly turned into a bat and flew away from the enormous foot.

Mo Fan was well prepared this time. He also turned into a shadow bird and left the area.

The bushes and trees were smashed into the pit. A part of the dense woods was missing suddenly.

Standing in the distance, Mo Fan felt the encounter to be quite familiar. He jumped into the canopy and gazed at the mountain.

As he lifted his eyes, he discovered a humanoid figure close to the mountain cliffs after taking a closer look. Its outline was vague. Mo Fan would have had a hard time noticing it if he was not searching for it on purpose!

The outline was incredibly huge, covering half the cliffs. Even the trees were like bushes, barely reaching its knees. It was a stunning sight for Mo Fan, who was only around six feet tall!

“It’s a Tyrant Titan!” Mo Fan called out to Bola.

Bola had flown into the canopy too. His bloodshot eyes were staring at the face of the mountain.

“Why didn’t we notice something so enormous? Can it turn invisible?” the vampire asked.

“Tyrant Titans have the ability to change their color, like chameleons. They live in the mountains, and when their bodies are close to the rocks, their colors will turn so they can blend in with the mountains!” Mo Fan said.

“You know quite a lot, considering your age,” Bola said.

It was Asha’ruiya that had told Mo Fan about the Tyrant Titans. The Tyrant Titans hid in the mountains, and would appear out of nowhere. Many Mages that had died to the Tyrant Titans did not even realize what had killed them.

The Tyrant Titans were huge, but their ability to conceal themselves was outstanding. They could perfectly cosplay a little mountain. Even if they attacked, since most of their bodies retained the colors of the mountain, people would only realize they were in danger when the titans’ feet were hanging above their heads!

The Tyrant Titan revealed itself, knowing that it had lost its concealment.

It immediately scared the believers watching from the Hall of Faith. The enormous titan was standing in the woods along the mountain path. Even though it was quite a distance away, it was still incredibly huge. Some ordinary people that had not learned magic fell to the ground feebly.

The believers were regulars to the Hall of Faith, and yet such a terrifying creature was living on the mountain not far away! They immediately lost all their faith.

“Everyone, please remain calm, that Titan is a guardian of the mountain. It only targets intruders on the Mountain of the Goddess. There’s a magic barrier in place, so none of you are in danger!” A few Mages of Faith had come to maintain order.

Despite their attempt to calm the people, the Tyrant Titan was simply too shocking to see. The ordinary people were having a hard time believing it!

—

“Aren’t Tyrant Titans enemies of the Parthenon Temple since the ancient times? Why would it defend the Parthenon Temple?” the knowledgeable Zhu Meng immediately blurted out.

“I...I have no idea either. The truth is, even many core members of the Parthenon Temple were unaware that the fourth statue guarding the mountain was actually a Tyrant Titan. It has been a long time since anyone managed to reach the fourth statue. Most people lost to Bola,” Pang Lai said.

Pang Lai was having complicated feelings, too. He was not sure if he should be happy knowing that Mo Fan had overcome the third statue, or should he be ashamed of himself. The vampire that he had lost to even with his cultivation of the peak Super Level had submitted to Mo Fan!

—

“Stay calm. Haobu is an orphan of the Tyrant Titans that the seventh Goddess of the Parthenon Temple adopted when she wiped out the tribe of Tyrant Titans. It did not inherit the savagery of the Tyrant Titans, and it is utterly loyal to the Mountain of the Goddess!” Great Muse Mellaura said calmly.

The people of the Hall of Faith were nervous when they saw the Tyrant Titan. Every now and thenTyrant Titans would come and provoke the Parthenon Temple. Many of the Mages of Faith and knights had died under the enormous feet of the Tyrant Titans, and their hatred of the Tyrant Titans was off the charts!

It was obvious that it had been a very long time since anyone had made it to the fourth statue of the Starry Mountain Path. Apart from the highest authorities, the rest of the people had no idea that the fourth statue guarding the Parthenon Temple was a Tyrant Titan!

“Aren’t the ranks of the knights, Blue Star, Silver Moon, and Golden Sun, taken from the lineage of the Tyrant Titans? This one here is a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan!” Kulun exclaimed.

A Blue Star Tyrant Titan was enough to inflict serious damage on the cities of Greece. A Silver Moon Tyrant Titan would immediately trigger a Blood Alert. If they failed to eliminate the threat in time, it would result in lots of casualties, and smaller cities would even be destroyed!

Silver Moon Tyrant Titans were rather terrifying, and this Tyrant Titan shrouded by a silver light was an elite among the Tyrant Titans!

——

Mo Fan knew a little about the ranks of the Tyrant Titans too. The one they stumbled into on Mount Tyrant was only a Blue Star Tyrant Titan. The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was clearly a lot stronger than the one he saw before. No wonder he could not react in time when its foot was hanging above his head!

Mo Fan believed he had no chance against the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan without Bola’s help.

Meanwhile, the Tyrant Titan was making its move!

THUD THUD THUD!

The titan trampled the woods and slammed its fist down at the ground. The Silver Moon Fist Shockwave it created shook the mountain and destroyed the woods. Mo Fan and Bola had already withdrawn a fair distance away, yet they were still knocked flying by the terrifying force!
