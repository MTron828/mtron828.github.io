When the evening arrived, the fresh blood smeared across the land and the changing colors of the sky portrayed the cruelty of war.

The main army had launched an assault on the pyramid. The fourth camp was the last camp before the final showdown. It was time for them to advance fearlessly to reach the pyramid... what stood behind them was no longer their reinforcements, or their city, but they would find themselves surrounded by lots of undead.

Mo Fan had faced a similar experience before. It was at the Ancient Capital, when the army of undead was many times bigger than the human army. They had quite a few Super Mages back then, but they only had two this time.

The last five kilometers!

It was the stretch with the highest density of undead, and the undead here were the strongest, too. The dark undead sprawled throughout the yellow basin, and the mirage of the pyramid was right in the center of them

All the undead within ten kilometers seemed to be aware that the humans were plotting a scheme against their sacred pyramid. The undead were moving into position, like a huge forest covering every inch of the area with their savage faces, broken bodies, rotting poisonous gas, and eyes filled with hunger...

“Charge!”

As General Fenna gave out the command, a blue light of protection rose into the sky, serving as a signal to the army.

“Charge!”

“Destroy the pyramid!”

“All hail Egypt!”

The army turned into a fierce tide, shoving the undead aside. The blasts of magic and their brilliance lit up the evening sky, as their destructive auras surged across the place...

The ghastly cries of undead traveled across the area like a chilling breeze. Their anger and hatred were crushing down on every person’s heart like giant mountains. They were fearless creatures, with only a single thought in their minds: tearing the humans apart and eating them!

The place was sprawling with the living and the dead. The soil soaked up the strong smell of blood. The scale of the battle was similar to the battle that had taken place at the maritime fortress in Japan, and it was rather helpful in training a bunch of powerful, fearless Mages!

The battle went from being orderly to a complete mess. Surrounded by the undead, the humans could no longer tell where the pyramid was. Many squads totally lost their way, and could only fight the undead instinctively.

—

“General, we have lost contact with the troop in the west!” Old Mage Mudin reported back.

“Are they all dead?” General Fenna asked in a hard voice.

“The Brutal Sword Death Servants are giving us a hard time, the troop is most likely wiped out.”

“That’s too quick, did anyone see anything?”

“No...”

General Fenna finally lost her patience. A few gusts appeared from her back and transformed into three pairs of wings behind her!

The wings were extremely quick and nimble, allowing her to move and change her direction freely in the air...

“Thousand Leaves Saber: Slaughtering Wind Slash!”

The fierce wind around Fenna turned into thousands of wind sabers sweeping forward. Hundreds, or even thousands of undead ahead were sliced into pieces within an instant, and scattered across the ground like fallen leaves. The path ahead suddenly cleared up, the undead could no longer stand.

After the Thousand Leaves Sabers achieved their goal, another fierce wind sliced further into the distance. The powerful wind slash extended to within a kilometer of the pyramid!

“Follow me!” With General Fenna clearing the path, the morale of the soldiers immediately skyrocketed.

A few of the squads immediately followed General Fenna and pressed forward into the area a kilometer away from the pyramid.

“You better protect her. If she loses even a single stand of her hair, I’m going to feed you to the undead!” Mo Fan snapped at the worthless knight Kulun standing beside Xinxia when he saw the path ahead being cleared.

“Even if you said nothing, it is my sacred responsibility as a knight to protect her!” Kulun replied with a stern face.

Mo Fan seriously found this Kulun an eyesore. His noble temperament, as if he was superior to the others, was urging Mo Fan to beat all his teeth out, yet the guy’s strength was fairly impressive, too. Mo Fan saw him kill ten Warrior-level undead instantly, and despite how chaotic the situation was, he did not allow a single undead to get within a hundred steps of Xinxia. It turned out that the bodyguard that the Parthenon Temple had assigned to protect Xinxia was not just mere decoration! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Brother Mo Fan, you’re going off to do something dangerous again?” Xinxia said.

“Don’t worry, I can protect myself better than anyone else. We must end this battle soon, or none of us will make it back alive,” Mo Fan said seriously.

They were deep in the surrounding undead. Mo Fan knew better than anyone else how relentless the undead were. If they could win the battle by just reaching the pyramid, Mo Fan believed he could easily do it with his Dark Noble Mantle.

“I’m going with you,” Xinxia said.

“Just stay her... fine,” Mo Fan changed his mind when he saw the serious look in her eyes.

Xinxia was riding a Blue Fantasy Horn Beast that she had subdued with the Psychic Element. It was blue and furry, with huge horns like an elephant, a robust build, and a long dragon tail...

The Blue Fantasy Horn Beast was in sync with Xinxia’s will, allowing her to move around easily even in a skirmish like this. In addition to that, the Blue Fantasy Horn Beast was fairly strong, too. Leaving its fighting capacity aside, its ability to evade attacks was comparable to the Night Rakshasa!

“I’ll come, too!” Kulun declared to Xinxia.

“Let’s go!”

Mo Fan turned into a shadow bird and wove through the shredded corpses of the undead to catch up with the army heading for the pyramid.

Xinxia followed behind on the Blue Fantasy Horn Beast. Even though she felt like vomiting when she saw the corpses, organs, and blood scattered all over the place, her eyes showed no intention of running away.

She fixed her eyes on Mo Fan, as she was afraid to lose sight of him. The Mages and undead were fighting everywhere. Mo Fan’s figure could suddenly vanish at any second. She had to follow tightly behind him, as she wanted to face any danger together with him.

“Mind Control!”

Xinxia’s eyes emitted a sacred blue light. The face of a mummy in heavy armor suddenly went blank, before it turned around and slammed its giant hammers at the other undead.

Mo Fan’s right arm was just about to erupt in flames he was planning to throw it at the mummy. He was stunned when he saw the mummy clearing the path for him instead.

The Heavy Armor Mummy was almost as strong as a Commander-level creature. It was even stronger than a Brutal Sword Death Servant, yet Xinxia had managed to control its mind with a single attempt, turning it into a tank clearing the path ahead!

“Holy Blessing: Strengthen!”

Xinxia cast a spell that Mo Fan felt familiar with. The Heavy Armor Mummy was soon bathed in the light of the sacred spell, encapsulating it and its hammers in a glowing light. When the hammers slammed into the undead, the light further increased the damage inflicted by the hammers!

The Heavy Armor Mummy immediately turned into a ferocious, battling beast after receiving the blessing, knocking whole swathes of undead to the ground.

“Incredible!” Mo Fan directed the flames on his fist in the other direction and gave Xinxia a huge thumbs-up.

Xinxia immediately smiled too, as if she had been waiting for the compliment all along after spending a year training diligently.

Xinxia lifted her eyes. She faintly caught a glimpse of some silver hair through the army of undead. Her long robe was tightly wrapped around her stunning silhouette. Even when she was in the middle of a battlefield crawling with filthy, ugly undead, she was still sacred and cold like an ice lily under the moonlight!

“It’s Ningxue, I think she has gone ahead,” Xinxia alerted Mo Fan as soon as she saw Mu Ningxue.

“Damn, why is she going so deep? She’s almost at the pyramid, is she out of her mind!?” Mo Fan was shocked when he saw Mu Ningxue.

Couldn’t Mu Ningxue be a little more patient and stay by his side? He was already a crazy maniac, but Mu Ningxue was even crazier than him!

Mo Fan, Xinxia, and Kulun immediately altered course and headed for Mu Ningxue.

Snow fell rapidly in the messy battle. Ice spikes poked out of the ground without stopping. The spikes totally disrupted the undead’s formation, preventing them from being able to get closer to the person casting them.

“This woman is very impressive!” Kulun exclaimed, staring at Mu Ningxue floating ten meters in the air.

In her Domain, every undead below the Warrior-level basically stood no chance, as they were killed within half a minute by the dense and accurate ice spikes lunging forth. Only Warrior-level undead with sturdy flesh remained.

Mo Fan was like a fire cannon, blasting through an area sprawling with undead with his destructive spells.

However, Mu Ningxue’s Ice Domain was even crazier. The undead’s numbers were totally insignificant in her Domain. A hundred Servant-class undead would freeze entirely in her Domain in under a minute, and the same thing would happen to a thousand of them. As long as a powerful undead did not show up, Mu Ningxue was a nightmare for all Servant-class undead. Thousands of them shattered into pieces like ice, covering a distance of half a kilometer.

“Ningxue!” Xinxia used Psychic Voice to transmit her voice into Mu Ningxue’s ears.

Mu Ningxue noticed them. When she was about to speak, her gaze suddenly sharpened as her lips mumbled something under her breath.

“Icebound Coffin!” Mu Ningxue pointed ahead, summoning a huge ice crystal above Mo Fan and Xinxia.

Mo Fan was stunned. What the hell was Mu Ningxue thinking? Did she already lose her mind from killing too many undead, that she could no longer tell who her allies were?
