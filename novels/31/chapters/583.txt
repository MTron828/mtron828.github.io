“I literally have no clue why that feminine man would appoint such an idiot as our Vice Captain; shouldn’t the Vice Captain be a Magician who had gone through hundreds of battles like me?!” Qing Lajiao’s hatred was almost on par with the Dark Abyss’s.

Using the terms of the scientific society that Mo Fan had come from, the members of the Magic Association were like public functionaries and government officials. Every Magician with or without titles or factions was under their control. If she were assigned as the Vice Captain for the team and successfully completed the important mission, it would only be days until she got promoted. After all, she had spent too much time in the Intermediate Level. If she were given resources that were actually useful to her for once, she was confident that she would break through the barrier of the Intermediate Level, gain control of her third Element and the stronger Advanced Spells!

“Yu Qingsu, why are you being mad over two Magicians who are only here to fill the numbers? Let’s get rid of this Corpse General first. Its strength approaches that of a Giant Corpse General,” said Scar Face.

Yu Qingsu could not stomach the grudge, yet a mission was a mission. Not only would she be punished if she failed to accomplish it, the whole team would be surrounded by the army of undead, too!

Glancing at her surroundings, a new tide of undead was rolling in their direction. If they were left behind, there was no way they could possibly find a way out. The undead would simply stack up like layers of walls. The only way to survive was to regroup with the army!

“Die!” Yu Qingsu seemed to be venting all the hatred in her heart onto the Corpse General wrapped in winding sheets. Purple flickers of lightning danced on her right palm, and swiftly transformed into countless lightning serpents striking the Corpse General, scorching the air they traveled across.

The lightning struck the Cloth-wrapped Corpse General like whips, but the undead creature was shockingly fast. The Lightning Strikes ended up hitting the slope where the creature stood a moment ago, leaving scorched marks on the ground. ( B oxnovel.c om )

The Cloth-wrapped Corpse General’s gray-white shadow suddenly appeared behind Yu Qingsu with a flicker. Its arms were as nimble as a living human as they waved around, whipping the winding sheet forward and wrapping around her body!

“Don’t get caught by the winding sheet. Otherwise, it will swap its body with yours!” reminded Scar Face quickly.

Scar Face was an Ice Magician. His ice spells needed some time for preparation. The Corpse General was not just a mere Servant-class zombie. He did not dare to charge at it ruthlessly with the ice chains.

“Magic Vine!” Yu Qingsu was definitely stronger than that. She leapt a great distance backward with quick reflexes while controlling her Magic Vine to grow out of the ground.

The Magic Vine grew surprisingly fast. It was most likely due to a Plant Seed that had improved the growing power of her Magic Vine. The vines rapidly constructed a wall right before the Cloth-wrapped Corpse General lunged at Yu Qingsu...

The winding sheets were flexible, but was hard to break free from once they caught their target. However, it was simply meaningless for them to wrap around the wall constructed by the vines. As such, the winding sheets simply returned to their owner’s body!

The Cloth-wrapped Cloth General was not brain-dead. It quickly threw a punch at Yu Qingsu after retrieving its winding sheets.

The winding sheets still played a major role in its attacks. The sheets spread out from the undead and spiraled through the air in the shape of screws. The screws expanded rapidly into a horizontal vortex, giving the impression of a monster with only a giant mouth and an esophagus looking to devour Yu Qingsu together with the wall of vines!

“So many sheets, just in time for me to stay warm in winter! Fiery Fist!” uttered Shorty teasingly, whose little fist turned into the tiny opening of a volcano, firing blazing flames at the winding sheets in the air...

The gray-white winding sheets were all set afire. The remaining sheets slowly drifted to the ground.

Yu Qingsu immediately broke free from the winding sheets. She glanced at Shorty, whose fist was still on fire and said coldly, “You should have blasted the Corpse General instead!”

“Don’t worry, it’s my turn... Fiery Fist: Groundbreak!” Mo Fan spoke up.

As Mo Fan slammed his fist on the ground, he directed his fiery energy down. When the surface could no longer endure the erupting flames, the place where the Corpse General stood was instantly devoured by rose-colored flames bursting out from the ground. The spectacular fire swept the black mists in the surroundings away!

The flames of the Groundbreak raged fiercely. When it came to a single target, Groundbreak was a lot more effective than a single pillar of the Nine Halls.

Mo Fan flames burned fiercely ahead of them. He believed that the Groundbreak would inflict serious damage on the Corpse General, yet the confident smile about to surface on his face suddenly disappeared, as it was replaced with astonishment when he discovered the Corpse General was approaching him rapidly!

“Damn it, this asshole is pretty quick!” Mo Fan finally realized that he had only blasted the afterimage left by the Corpse General with his spell.

If he was aware of the creature’s speed, he would have served it with Fiery Fist: Nine Halls instead, leaving it with no chance of dodging the spell!

“It’s hard to land your spells on agile zombies like this, but their bodies are not as sturdy as the enormous Corpse Generals, so if you manage to land a destructive spell on it, it’s pretty much half-crippled,” Shorty said immediately, as he was also an experienced Hunter.

“You don’t need to tell us that... Forest of Kun!” said Yu Qingsu disdainfully. ( B oxnovel.c om )

The Plant Element was Yu Qingsu’s main Element. Her Plant Seed had the ability to speed up the growth of the Forest of Kun.

Normally, the enormous Forest of Kun would require some time to be constructed and set in place. However, her Forest of Kun was readily available to sprout from the ground anytime, entrapping the Corpse General in a giant cage of plants before it could reach Mo Fan.

“Ice Lock!” Scar Face adeptly utilized the opportunity. He quickly cast his Ice Lock when the Corpse General’s range of movement was limited.

The flying speed of the ice chains was not as fast as the Corpse General could move, but the creature no longer had any space to dodge the attack. When the four ice chains entered the Forest of Kun, the Corpse General kept ramming into the walls while it was pursued by the ice chains.

“Pin it down tight, I’ll blast it to death!” Shorty rolled up his sleeves, as if it was his time to shine.

“Forget about using the Fiery Fist, you will only destroy her forest!” Mo Fan stopped Shorty.

Yu Qingsu who had been very aggressive with her attacks had already drawn another Star Pattern. Wild purple lightning arcs flickered endlessly around her figure, making her look even more imperious and unstoppableALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
