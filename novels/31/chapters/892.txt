“I don’t know her name. She has brown hair, a small face, a tall nose, brown eyes, and I saw her wearing the uniform of service staff with a red bowtie. I also heard Zhao Pinlin mentioning that he had met her at the bar, so I guess she’s a waitress there. Zhao Pinlin was treating her respectfully, like a toady pet,” Wang Xuxu said quickly.

Wang Xuxu described her encounter with the woman to Mo Fan, hoping that it could be of help.

-Is she a Gray Priest, or a Blue Deacon?- Mo Fan started thinking.

Normally, whenever the Black Vatican was recruiting new members, the Gray Priests would be in charge of the process. They would carefully observe candidates and determine if they were suitable. They would then approach these candidates as ordinary people, before slowly turning them into members of the Black Vatican.

Judging from how the woman was teaching Zhao Pinlin how to obtain his own Dark Beast Monster, she was most likely a Gray Priest, yet Wang Xuxu said that the woman seemed to be controlling the manor...

-She could be a Blue Deacon too. It looks like this waitress is my priority target, but it’s too difficult to find her now. She must be hiding somewhere. There’s no way she’s going to be mucking around at the bar still,- Mo Fan said to himself confidently.

Either way, Wang Xuxu had surely helped him a lot, giving him a clearer direction to stop him from wandering around like a headless fly.

It would be great if the waitress was really a Blue Deacon. Her bounty would not be low, and money was the reason that Mo Fan had agreed to come!

“The space I set up for you will last for some time. If any other members of the Black Vatican come here, you should pretend that you’re in great pain. Don’t let them notice any difference,” said Mo Fan.

“You won’t leave me here, right?” Wang Xuxu’s eyes were pleading. Even though the pain had greatly reduced, she was still inside a pool surrounded by darkness. She wanted to see sunlight, her classmates, and her family again!

“Mmm!” Mo Fan nodded.

“Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me yet, the poison is still our biggest problem. We won’t be able to leave this place if we can’t find the cure,” said Mo Fan.

“I’m already grateful that you’re willing to help me,” said Wang Xuxu.

Knowing that death was inevitable was scarier than death itself. Even a single minute felt incredibly long for Wang Xuxu. Mo Fan’s promise had at least given her a reason to hang in there.

“Let’s hope we can all leave this place in one piece,” sighed Mo Fan.

Closing the door of the room, Mo Fan started heading back using the same path that had brought him here.

Unfortunately, two Gray Priests were patrolling nearby. Mo Fan hesitated for a while, before deciding to go after them. After all, the Gray Priests were his only clue to locate the Blue Deacon, and also learn about the cure to the poison.

———–

The dark hall of the orange building...

Rong Sheng, Mu Ningxue, and Guo Wenyi were still waiting in the dim room. At times, a Dark Beast Monster would pass by the room on the outside, searching for traces of someone alive.

Guo Wenyi leaned against the door and watched through the gap. She suddenly saw a gray creature with strange runes on its body slowly approaching the room.

Unlike the Dark Beast Monsters from before, the creature’s eyes were sharper and scarier. Rong Sheng carelessly exchanged glances with the creature and felt goosebumps all over his body.

The gray Cursed Beast immediately headed for the room. Its nose and senses were a lot more sensitive than the Dark Beast Monsters. They saw the creature approaching the door while uttering a strange cry.

“Gulu!~ Gulu!~” The Cursed Beast let out a deep cry.

Mu Ningxue immediately went to the door when she heard the cry.

“Looks like they’ve found us!” Rong Sheng said in fear.

Mu Ningxue closed her eyes to sense the surroundings, and noticed that lots of Dark Beast Monsters were making their way to the room. Their pungent smell had already filled the room...

It turned out that the Cursed Beast had indeed found them. It was summoning its comrades to surround the place.

Mu Ningxue went to the window and saw that they were tightly sealed off. If they escaped through the window, there would be lots of creatures waiting for them outside too.

“I thought this place should be clean after we killed those people. What a surprise, a few mice have sneaked into here again... tsk tsk!” a voice came from outside. It sounded rather familiar.

Rong Sheng and Guo Wenyi exchanged glances with one another. Rong Sheng was the first to speak, “Isn’t that Zhao Pinlin’s voice?”

As soon as the words were spoken, the heavy doors of the hall were flung open fiercely. The pungent smell immediately lunged at the group and almost choked them.

Guo Wenyi backed off to the table. She was trembling in fear. A dozen monsters with black skin,the source of the pungent smell, had swarmed into the room.

Among the Dark Beast Monsters was a gray creature covered by curse runes. Its size was twice that of any other Dark Beast Monster. Its glowing green eyes were staring at them. It felt like the creature was about to tear them into pieces before it had even moved closer to them!

A man wearing a blue outfit stood beside the Cursed Beast. He looked surprised when he saw the intruders were Rong Sheng and Guo Wenyi. However, when he realized that the silver-haired woman he had the desire to pounce on was also in the room, he was utterly excited.

What a surprise, who would have thought... he was still figuring how to take her himself. Their time at the ranches was almost coming to an end. To his surprise, she had walked right into the trap herself. It simply sped up the time needed for him to achieve his dream!

“Another bunch of intruders, kill them,” a man in a gray outfit slowly entered the room and took a glance around.

“Leave them to me, since I personally know them,” Zhao Pinlin smiled.

“Whatever, but don’t take too long. We have things to do still. The new poison eggs have already hatched. We need more help with the preparations, so we can kill more people before the Enforcement Union arrives, hahaha!” the Gray Priest burst into laughter.

The Gray Priest was obviously interested in killing. His eyes were filled with a strange passion.

“Why don’t we kill them all?” asked a disciple beside him.

“Idiot, if everyone here is dead, how can we blend in with the crowd and leave?”

“Brilliant, Senior Li Kai is brilliant as usual!” the disciple fawned over the Gray Priest.

“Rookie, deal with them and regroup with us at the Slanted Hall as soon as possible,” ordered the Gray Priest Li Kai.
