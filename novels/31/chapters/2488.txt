Chapter 2490: Getting their Revenge on the Sea Monsters

Translated by XephiZ

Ding Yumian believed she was to blame.

She should have been on alert. After all, she was going up against a sea monster that could control human minds.

The Trench Demon had controlled Dean Fu to call her here.

It had controlled everyone and made it look like some of them were being controlled, while others still had clear minds. It kept using Dean Fu and the others to call for backup and lure them into its trap!

If they had not seen through the Trench Demon’s trick, they would have ended up as one of the dead bodies, too.

It was a clear display of the sea monsters’ intelligence. They were vicious and brutal beyond the imagination of their human foes!

If Mo Fan had not killed Dean Fu, Dean Fu would have ambushed him and killed him in the end, too!

“How did you figure it out?” Ding Yumian asked Mo Fan curiously.

The Trench Demon must have realized Mo Fan’s extraordinary strength, so it tried to confuse Mo Fan while it was fighting Ding Yumian, so that he would have no idea who his enemy was.

The Trench Demon had been planning to take out Ding Yumian before dealing with Mo Fan. To its surprise, Mo Fan had seen through its plan!

“One of my friends encountered its species before. He told me these creatures are good at playing with our minds, so I was cautious from the beginning. Besides, Dean Fu sounded very confident when he asked me to kill you. Normally, he should be hesitant and puzzled too, so I used something special to see through the creature’s tricks,” Mo Fan explained. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mo Fan was referring to the Eye of Deceit!

Mo Fan realized the Eye of Deceit was able to determine whether a person’s mind was being controlled, but since the old Forbidden Mage and the South Pole Emperor were stronger than him, the Eye of Deceit did not have a clear answer back then.

The Trench Demon was not as strong as them, so it was easier for the Eye of Deceit to see its treachery.

Unfortunately, despite the Eye of Deceit’s usefulness, he was telling Apas’ vicious sister his location every time he used it. If he had not been on alert right from the beginning, he would have avoided using it in normal situations. He was still surprised that Dean Fu who had called them over was being controlled!

“They…they are buried behind there,” a director who regained his consciousness pointed behind the signal tower.

Mo Fan and Ding Yumian were puzzled. They went closer to the signal tower.

They blew the feathers on the swamp away and revealed countless distorted bodies there. There were over a hundred corpses behind the signal tower. They all belonged to the teachers and students of the Pearl Institute.

They were like dead poultry abandoned in the drains and covered in filthy feathers. Mo Fan and Ding Yumian felt their hearts squeezing in pain.

“You two aren’t the first backup that came. They were tricked here by us. We could only watch them die, before the next batch was tricked here again…” The director covered his face, stammering to speak.

Mo Fan and Ding Yumian both felt like something was clenching their throats. They were struggling to breathe.

How many people had died?

The Trench Demon had set a trap here and kept using Dean Fu and the others to call for backup, luring them all into the trap.

Mo Fan and Ding Yumian were only two of them. There were a lot more victims before them!

Ding Yumian turned away from the corpses. She had not used her Psychic Element on Dean Fu because she trusted him.

She had almost made a terrible mistake!

If Mo Fan had not been decisive enough, the two of them might have fallen into the trap, and more people would have died after them!

Ding Yumian was trembling.

“Look on the bright side, at least no one will fall for the trap again.” Mo Fan patted Ding Yumian’s shoulder reassuringly.

“Mm,” Ding Yumian took a deep breath, getting control of her anger and grief!

It was a relief that the Trench Demon was dead!

The Pearl Institute had many teachers and students. If they had not killed the Trench Demon, there would be more corpses buried in the swamp.

Ding Yumian tried her best to control her emotions. She did not want them to influence the others, as the consequences were far worse than what the Trench Demon had done.

“Screw these sea monsters!” Mo Fan was enraged.

“We have no idea what’s happening out there,” Ding Yumian said.

The Huangpu River covered a large area. Mo Fan was cleaning up the sea monsters as quickly as he could, but he still could not save the people of the Pearl Institute in time.

Many students and teachers of the Pearl Institute were like moths diving into a huge fire. They were no match for the sea monsters, but they had to sacrifice themselves to save the residents close to the river.

“Ding Yumian, how do your emotions influence the people around you?” Mo Fan asked her directly.

“It must be my Innate Talent, but I can’t control it most of the time. It’s almost like a disaster to others. It has brought nothing but misfortune to the people around me,” Ding Yumian said helplessly.

She was unwilling to leave the Pearl Institute because it was a great shelter for her, helping her to stay calm at all times.

She was afraid the same incident that had happened when she was younger might occur again if she left the school.

Mo Fan fell into deep thought.

Ding Yumian’s Innate Talent was similar to Qin Yu’er’s. Qin Yu’er had an Innate Soul-grade Seed. Wherever she went would soon be covered in snow and ice.

Ding Yumian’s Innate Talent was able to influence people’s minds and emotions, causing them to overreact when her emotions were stirred up.

It was a powerful Innate Talent that she could not control. She was considered a Disaster-bringer because of it.

“Can you use it to influence the sea monsters?” Mo Fan asked her.

“Well…” Ding Yumian had never thought of using it against the sea monsters.

“It’s a powerful ability. Even a Super Mage like me can feel your anger and grief, but it’s a waste if you just have to suppress it. I’m wondering if you could spread your emotions to the sea monsters. It might help us get rid of the sea monsters and avenge the teachers and students!” Mo Fan said.

Ding Yumian stared at Mo Fan in surprise.

Most of the people here were still overwhelmed by grief and the cruelty of the sea monsters, but Mo Fan was already thinking of resolving the situation and avenging the dead.

Ding Yumian was shocked by Mo Fan’s unyielding spirit.

Losing themselves in pain was meaningless. They had to get their revenge on the sea monsters and protect those who were still alive!
