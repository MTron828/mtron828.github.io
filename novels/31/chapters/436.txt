North Country Club...

The club had a spacious bar at the center. The fairly dull environment had crimson red lights on the ground, acting like a layer of glowing red carpet.

The bar had a Western style, with the head of a deer hanging above the wall, which was painted with lots of religious patterns. A few silver glasses and cutlery were ready at the end of the bar. Even the bartender was a fairly handsome Westerner.

“What drink would you like?” asked the bartender inside the bar.

“Marina, not too full. I’ve got a better drink to enjoy later,” said a pale-faced customer.

The customer emptied the drink into his throat quickly, without leaving a single drop behind, as if he were trying to boost his courage for whatever he was planning to do later.

“Asshole, who’s trying to mess with me? If I knew the kid was the only person there, I would’ve killed him on the spot. They shouldn’t have seen my face. This is unacceptable! Never have I let prey escape from my palm, and Liu Ru won’t be an exception, either!” murmured the pale-faced man.

The man did not notice a harmless looking Little Loli was sitting not far away from the bar. She was drinking a glass of juice while secretly observing the man.

The place was a club for the rich. There were a few residential areas nearby with mansions, thus occasionally, some of the rich residents would bring their kids to the club. As such, it was not strange to see a kid hanging out in the hall.

The Little Loli was holding a phone in her hand. She seemed to be talking with someone.

“Hey little gorgeous, why are you here on your own?” asked a well-groomed middle-aged man with a smile.

Lingling raised her head, and her eyes had an innocent look instead of her usual intelligent gaze. She pouted and said grumblingly, “I hate learning Magic. There’s an endless amount of questions to answer every day. Why can the adults come here and drink, while we kids have to learn those boring topics? I want to drink too, but that irritating foreigner doesn’t let me order one.”

The middle-aged man burst into laughter, who could not respond to Lingling’s interesting remark at first. He replied after a while, “Kids who don’t listen to adults are naughty. How about this, I haven’t drunk from this glass of wine which I just ordered. I’ll let you take a sip, and you’ll understand how bad the taste it has no matter how expensive the wine is.”

Lingling nodded with the same naive look.

After the middle-aged man left, Lingling glanced back at the pale-faced man at the bar. To her annoyance, the guy had already left without her noticing.

Lingling cursed in her heart, “Goddammit strange uncle, you’ve ruined my plan.”

She did not manage to get a clear look at the vampire’s face. Strangely, the vampire’s face seemed to have an automatic censoring functionality. Every time she tried to look at his face, a cloudy mist would be shrouding his face. If she could get a clear look, she could easily track the vampire down.

On a side note, since he was a regular visitor here, he must be one of the rich people living in this residential area.

“Come, I’ll give you just a sip,” the middle-aged man returned with a smile, having switched the glass of wine into a small cup.

“Uncle, do you know the guy at the bar?” asked Lingling.

“Why are you asking?” said the well-groomed man.

“I heard that girls always come to the bar to hook up with guys. I want to do that, too,” said Lingling.

“Why him? Am I not a man too? Besides, you’re the most interesting little girl I’ve ever seen,” the middle-aged man chuckled.

“You’re right, so do you know him?” asked Lingling.

The middle-aged man’s eyes which were reflecting the light from the bar stared at Lingling, as if he were trying to read her mind. However, all he could see was an innocent, determined expression.

A moment later, he smilingly shook his head, “He looks familiar, but I don’t know who he is.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Such a pity, I want to be friends with him,” said Lingling.

The middle-aged man chuckled again, who said to Lingling, “He might not be interested in young girls like you. He must be interested in mature girls, instead of a little girl who came to an adults’ club and vented her spleen because she doesn’t like studying.”

“Alright, I should be going home. My dad will surely come searching for me if he didn’t see me when he went home. Thanks, uncle,” said Lingling, while poking her tongue out.

The middle-aged man glanced at the little cup and asked with his brows raised, “Are you sure you don’t want to take a sip? I’m sure that you won’t want to grow into an adult after having a taste.”

“Maybe not, I heard that drinking alcohol will make your face red. If my father knew, he would lock me up in my room for a month,” Lingling finished the juice in one go and quickly left the place.

The middle-aged man watched the adorable Lingling exit the bar. His gaze seemed calm on the surface, yet it felt like he was wearing an eerie grin.

——

Soon after Lingling left, the pale-faced man previously at the bar slowly walked up to the middle-aged man and said, “Your taste is still the same after all these years.”

After saying this, the pale-faced man finished the wine in the glass at one go.

“Such a pity, she was interested in you instead. I’ve roughly sounded her out. She seems like an ordinary little girl. Of course, if I were to see her again, she won’t be ordinary anymore,” the middle-aged man smiled.

“Why did you let her go then? It’s rare to see such a smart little girl,” said the pale-faced man.

“Wasn’t that your fault?! Someone now has their eyes on you, which means that they are aware of our Blood Tribe’s existence. It’s easy for us to be exposed if we do anything extra during this period. We should stay low for a while, and be cautious with everything,” said the middle-aged man.

“There’s nothing to be scared of, I just happened to stumble into a small Magician. Besides, I haven’t done anything yet,” the pale-faced man said arrogantly.

The middle-aged man suddenly wore a sharp gaze and thrust the knife in front of him at the pale-faced man, before stopping in front of the man’s eyes!

“How many times have I told you, not to let your prey die within a short period of time, and not to pick on the same prey repeatedly? You’ve made someone suspicious, which is going to worsen our situation. I’ve already asked the others to stay low, and I don’t want to lose any more members of our family,” the middle-aged man snarled, his face outraged.
