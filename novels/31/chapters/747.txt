A Commander-level Soul Essence!

The thing was shockingly valuable. It was between five to six times more valuable than a Warrior-level Soul Essence, if he wasn’t mistaken.

-A Warrior-level Soul Essence was around twenty million, so five times that... doesn’t that mean it’s a hundred million!?-

Mo Fan was totally thrilled. The pain on his chest immediately disappeared!

He had never seen so much money in his entire life. A hundred million, he was finally a man with over a hundred million...

The representatives in the national team either had incredible strength or luxurious equipment. Even that son of a bitch Zhao Manyan had already got his hands on some Magic Wings. How was it acceptable if he could not get his hands on some worthy weapons or defensive equipment, too? The Heavens had finally shown him some kindness, to prepare such a huge gift for him. The effort he put in to kill the Scarlet Rending Demon was all worth it!

“Mm, little Flame Belle, what are you doing?” Mo Fan heard little Flame Belle high-spirited cry, which sounded like she was giving orders to someone while he was still immersed in his great excitement.

Mo Fan painfully turned his head around and saw an ugly Sea Monkey standing beside him, like a slave with its hands cuffed up. It was slowly placing a strange kind of seaweed in front of little Flame Belle.

Mo Fan did recognize the Sea Monkey. It was the creature that had brought them here!

It turned out that little Flame Belle could not bear to watch Mo Fan bleeding non-stop. She immediately found the hidden Sea Monkey and asked the creature to find some medicine for her daddy Mo Fan.

The Sea Monkey was watching the fight from far away. It was utterly shocked after witnessing Mo Fan killing their vicious king. It immediately went to find some herbs for Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was amused when he saw little Flame Belle waving her arms around at the Sea Monkey like a demanding princess.

Mo Fan sniffed the seaweed to confirm it was a medicinal herb before asking little Flame Belle to apply it to his wounds.

The effort he put in his studies was not in vain. Mo Fan could recognize some common medicinal herbs, and some of them did grow in the ocean. There was even a city that blossomed economically after discovering a huge supply of high-quality medicinal herbs in the sea nearby...

The seaweed also had an anesthesthetic effect, in addition to stopping his bleeding and easing the pain. Mo Fan could feel his consciousness falling away after the medicinal herb was applied to his wounds.

Little Flame Belle was her daddy’s considerate companion. She tapped her chest to imply that she would take good care of him.

Mo Fan nodded. He was indeed worn out. There was no need to worry with the little Flame Belle watching him. He immediately fell asleep...

——

The vast ocean was serenely spectacular. However, if glancing down from a great height, one could see a silver line splitting the blue mirror in half...

Taking a closer look, the silver line turned out to be a path of ice that kept spreading further out, as if the sea water was frozen. However, its range was only limited to a narrow path. If the path was raised above the sea water, it looked more like a long white dam!

Ai Jiangtu, Nanyu, Gong Yu, Zu Jiming, and the others followed behind Mu Ningxue. They followed the ice dam and made their way toward the reef island...

“I can see it, it’s right ahead!” said Ai Jiangtu.

Ai Jiangtu immediately used Blink to reach the island when it came into his sight.

Not long after, Mu Ningxue made it too. She did not like Mo Fan jumping around her like a monkey, yet she honestly did not want anything to happen to him.

Mu Ningxue jumped onto the reefs island and saw Ai Jiangtu standing on a rock with a stern face.

Mu Ningxue walked up to him. She did not see the Scarlet Rending Demon, but she saw Mo Fan lying still on the ground...

It was the worst scene she had imagined, yet it was happening right in front of her. She subconsciously took a deep breath as her vision began to blur.

“We’ve come late,” Ai Jiangtu let out a sigh.

Mu Ningxue did not dare to walk up to the body. She was lost in her thoughts.

He had managed to survive the Calamity of Bo City, the incident in Jilin City, the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, but ended up dying here? Didn’t they always say the bad guys wouldn’t die so easily? Since when did he become so righteous, to sacrifice his life in exchange for a child’s!

The others arrived in turn and fell silent when they saw Mo Fan covered in bruises and his chest torn open.

“Say, am I the only one that thinks he’s still breathing?” asked Li Kaifeng softly.

“Is he? Let me take a look,” Nanyu knelt down beside Mo Fan and put her hand over Mo Fan’s nose.

Soon, she felt a hot breath on her hand. Nanyu stared at Mo Fan in surprise.

Mo Fan happened to open his eyes at the same time and saw Nanyu putting her hand in front of his nose. He glanced around and saw everyone surrounding him as if they were mourning for him. He felt like they were going to cremate him at any second!

“What...what are you all up to!” Mo Fan rose to his feet.

Mo Fan gave the team a good scare.

Mo Fan’s chest was injured, so his breathing was weak. Ai Jiangtu straight away assumed Mo Fan was dead when he saw him lying still on the ground.

The others thought the same, too. On top of that, they had all assumed that Mo Fan would most likely be dead by the time they arrived, since he was going against a Commander-level creature alone. Even though Mo Fan was an Advanced Magician, a recently leveled-up Advanced Magician was only slightly stronger than an Intermediate Magician. Besides, the Scarlet Rending Demon would never give Mo Fan a chance to cast his Advanced Spell...

As such, they all thought Mo Fan was dead meat. It would be a relief if they could recover his corpse.

And now, Mo Fan was alive and well. Everyone’s mind immediately went blank!

-He’s not dead?

-This guy is not dead?-

-How is this possible? Did the Scarlet Rending Demon run away?- Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Why the heck are you lying still there if you’re not dead!” Nanyu snapped furiously after recovering from her surprise.

“I was asleep,” replied Mo Fan honestly.

“...” Everyone was left speechless.

“Look at you, sleeping soundly here. Mu Ningxue was so terrified...” said Nanyu.

Mo Fan finally realized Mu Ningxue had not dared to come any closer, and was standing some distance away.

The girl was extremely cold to him, and claimed that she had no interest in him, yet it seemed like her body was rather honest!

“Where’s the Scarlet Rending Demon? There’s no way that savage beast would spare your life...” Gong Yu asked with mixed feelings.

“The scorched thing you’re standing on is the Scarlet Rending Demon,” said Mo Fan.

Gong Yu was startled. He immediately moved his feet and realized that he was not standing on some burned rocks, but a scorched corpse!

The Scarlet Rending Demon’s corpse hardened soon after its death. It looked just like rocks, so the others did not even notice it.

“This thing is the Scarlet Rending Demon, it’s dead?” asked Zu Jiming in disbelief.

“It’s indeed the creature,” Ai Jiangtu inspected the corpse and confirmed its identity.

Once again, the group fixed their eyes on Mo Fan.

-What...what on Earth?

-Mo Fan is alive, but the Scarlet Rending Demon is dead!

-The Commander-level creature is dead!

-So did Mo Fan kill it?

-By himself?-
