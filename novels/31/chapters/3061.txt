3063 The Person Before Her

They had drawn their swords. Even so, Ye Xinxia had no intention of stopping them. Just then, Archangel Ramiel walked out from the side and faked a cough.

“Since you’re here to visit, shouldn’t you follow the rules of visitation?” Archangel Ramiel walked over to them. He waved his hand at the Holy Shadow and Holy Judges, signaling them to put away their unnecessary hostility.

“Am I not worthy of your trust?” asked Ye Xinxia with a smile.

“Haha! Of course, you’re worthy of our trust! Come, I’ll stay by your side. Your knights don’t have to be too worried about your safety. I’ll personally protect you. Even the Dark King won’t be able to harm you.” Archangel Ramiel made an inviting gesture.

“Hua Lisi, you and your group will stay here.”

“Okay.” Hua Lisi nodded.

“My lady, can I go in and visit my old friend?” asked the Lord of the Hall of Knights Haylon.

“Sure.”

…

Archangel Ramiel took Ye Xinxia to the courtyard filled with weeds. The courtyard was filled with dangerous barriers. Without the Holy City’s angel, the visitors could easily trigger the barriers that could inflict a terrifying destructive power that surpassed the level of the Forbidden Curse.

Ye Xinxia followed Ramiel. They passed through a long path before seeing a person laying in the middle of the weeds. Mo Fan was daydreaming. He had a reed stem in his mouth. He placed both of his hands behind his head and stared at the sky…

Holy City was filled with many lush green mountains. Whenever Ye Xinxia could not find Mo Fan, she would walk to the end of the old streets. When she arrived at the first place with old stone steps, she would shout at the top of the mountains. It did not take long before Mo Fan would stick his head out, then run down from the mountain agilely. He would carry her and leave her wheelchair on the steps.

There was a small piece of land.

Many times, Mo Fan had laid down in the middle of the weeds. He did not mind the dirt or mosquito bites. When no one was around, he would daydream. When someone was around, he would chat incessantly. Even when that someone was just one of his fantasies, the feeling was so real.

“Big Brother Mo Fan.”

Ye Xinxia walked toward the weeds and found the daydreaming Mo Fan.

Mo Fan turned his head. When he realized the person who came to visit him was Ye Xinxia, he went from boredom to surprise!

Mo Fan jumped up from the ground. He charged at Ye Xinxia and gave her a warm hug. Perhaps hugging alone was insufficient to express how much he had missed her. Mo Fan wrapped his arms around her and spun several times.

Meanwhile, Archangel Ramiel had his eyes blinded by the sight before him. He looked away and ignored the young couple’s intimacy. On second thought, Mo Fan was a heavy criminal, he could not let Mo Fan escape. In the end, Ramiel was forced to keep a close eye on them.

Holy Shadow Brooke was around. He looked strange.

At that moment, Mo Fan did not care how those people felt when they saw them. Mo Fan kissed and hugged Ye Xinxia. He even had the thoughts of shattering the shackles bound around him and killing Holy City’s angels. He wished he could bring Ye Xinxia to a place where they could live in intimacy.

“You can walk now.” Mo Fan went around Ye Xinxia and sized her up.

Ye Xinxia was shy. After all, she never stood in place and allowed someone else to check on her from various angles and distances.

Still, she obeyed Mo Fan. Even though there were two people in the courtyard paying close attention to them, Ye Xinxia stood motionlessly in place…

“Okay. The Divine Soul is no longer a burden for you. But—” Ye Xinxia answered Mo Fan. Suddenly, a surge of sadness sprouted from her heart.

It had taken great pains for her to finally walk normally.

The first thing that Ye Xinxia wanted to do was to take a stroll with Mo Fan. She hoped they could walk on the noisy streets or quiet paths. She wished they could hold hands together like a couple and walk at a slow pace…

However, her wish was far from reach.

Mo Fan was imprisoned in Holy City.

He was guarded by several of the world’s most powerful people. If the next trial did not go smoothly, it was likely that she would never have such an opportunity in her life again.

The feeling was unbearable. Mo Fan was someone irreplaceable in her heart!

“What is it?” Mo Fan saw through Xinxia’s emotions. She looked down. He knew she was sad because of a certain thing.

“N-Nothing.” Ye Xinxia dared not tell him. She smiled to hide her own feelings.

Mo Fan looked at her.

He had to admit that Xinxia had changed a lot over the years. She could hide her own feelings very well. Even though she was sad and disappointed, she covered her emotions with a natural and elegant smile. The others who noticed her sadness would have thought their minds had drifted away.

But Mo Fan understood her very well. He knew her habits. She cultivated her habits since childhood. Only her closest ones could notice her subtle changes.

“Don’t worry about me. I mean what I said.” Mo Fan stroked her hair.

“Okay. I’m not worried about you.” Ye Xinxia nodded.

Ye Xinxia had stopped worrying and feeling sad about certain things.

She knew certain things were pointless to worry about and be upset about.

She had to do everything she could to fight for certain things, like the person before her.

Even though Ye Xinxia had many successful and famous relatives, she did not feel even a trace of warmth and affection from them.

She remembered when she hid inside the freezer, it was Mo Fan who crossed Holy City and melted the cold in her with his temperature.

She remembered when she was in the darkness of the abyss of death, Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle refused to let go of their hands even though they were close to exhausting their fire of life.

‘Big Brother Mo Fan, you’ve been protecting me all this while. This time, let me protect you. No matter what, I won’t let the people in Holy City hurt you,’ said Ye Xinxia from the bottom of her heart.

She did not say the words to Mo Fan. She thought to herself.

She would not let anyone in the world take away Mo Fan’s freedom, his life, and his soul, even if that person was someone from Holy City!

…

She was truly reluctant to leave Mo Fan. Still, she followed the rules and left Mo Fan in the courtyard filled with weeds according to the stipulated time.

Holy Shadow Brooke escorted Ye Xinxia down the long path and toward the hall. Archangel Ramiel examined Mo Fan thoroughly to prevent Ye Xinxia from handing Mo Fan something that could help him to escape. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Holy Shadow Brooke walked very slowly. He fixed his eyes on Ye Xinxia’s graceful figure.

Holy Shadow Brooke had to admit that he was jealous of Mo Fan.

It was hard to believe the Goddess with an imposing aura that suppressed the Holy Judges and the Holy Shadow, was so soft and gentle before that damned prisoner.
