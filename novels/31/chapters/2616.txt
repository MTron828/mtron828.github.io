Wei Rong could no longer talk properly after he began sobbing. He sensibly

backed away.

The teacher with white brows stared at Ding Yumian. He could not find any

words, even after a long time.

He was simply staring at the spirit who was staring back at him.

“Can you tell us what happened?” the teacher with white brows asked softly.

“L.I can’t remember..” the spirit spoke in a soft and gentle whisper. It was Ding

Yumian’s voice.

“Don’t let her recall the scene prior to her death. It will only add to her pain.

The harmless fragment of her soul might turn into an evil spirit too,” Professor

Luo reminded everyone.

The teacher with white brows let out a sigh and stepped away.

Ding Yumian was a kind student who would volunteer to help the school. The

teacher with white brows often had patients and traumatized students whom

he did not have time to attend to. Ding Yumian had worked as his assistant for

time.

The teacher with white browS was not a talkative man. He had only discussed

the treatments of the patients with Ding Yumian.

However, not only did he feel sorry for Ding Yumian after seeing what she had

become, he was very angry, too!

How could Dean Lee do such a wicked thing behind their backs? Shouldn’t he

take care of every student as a Dean of the school? How could he take away the

Woman’s right to live so cruelly?

Magic was human’s proudest discovery. Magic schools were treated like sacred

places!

And yet, Dean Lee had forced a student to sacrifice herself in exchange for

temporary peace, instead of using what he had learned for many years to fend

off the sea monsters!

Mo Fan went forward and inspected the spirit

The spirit instantly recognized Mo Fan. She smiled, turning the dark presence

of death around her into a warm light.

“It’s good to see you made it back alive!” The spirit seemed pleased.

“Sorry for worrying you.” Mo Fan was ashamed. He did not expect so many

people were caring about him while he was in the Dark Plane.

“I told myself I could be like you and do something for the Pearl Institute and

the Magic City, but I ran away like a coward in the end. I’m so useless,” the

spirit admitted.

“Then I must have left you with a terrible impression. The truth is, I would

consider the odds of my own survival first before I do something.

If l’m surely going to die, I wouldn’t bother with it. Many people are wrong about one thing

They think they can die a worthy death by sacrificing themselves to help the

others, but how can you guarantee that you couldn’t make a bigger difference if

you were alive instead?

“You have only seen my good deeds, but you have no idea how many times I’ve

watched others die just to stay alive. If I’m only trying to enjoy my life in peace,

but the whole world wants me to die just so they could live in peace, you can

bet that I would choose to let everyone die with me, too

There were good and bad in the world. When the bad were in charge, it was not

necessarily evil to let the world destroy itself.

Ding Yumian was too kind!

If Mo Fan was in her place, he would make sure everyone was going to suffer if

they were forcing him to die.

Ding Yumian’s eyes glittered, as if Mo Fan’s words had untied a knot in her

heart that had troubled her for a long time.

“Mo Fan, won’t you make her think her intention to get her revenge is right?

The other half of her soul that has turned into an Undead can already comer

the Magic Association,” Professor Shi said urgently.

“Mo Fan, you should be more positive,” Dean Xiao coughed out. Mo Fan’s words

would seriously lead a lot of good students astray!

“I’m not a teacher. I’m just telling her as a friend what she should have done

when she was being threatened,” Mo Fan shrugged indifferently. He added, “I

should have told her earlier.”

Mo Fan’s words stabbed everyone in the heart.

Yes, why didn’t we tell her earlier?

If anyone among them had realized what was happening and found out she

was feeling hopeless because she had nowhere to go, none of this would have

happened!

They could still admire her beautiful hair as she was walking happily through

the school. They would not be talking to her while she was in the state of a

wandering spirit who had nowhere to go.

What was the meaning of this war? Wasn’t it to let a kind and beautiful woman

like her live peacefully in her beloved school? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yumian, do you know your spirit has turned into an Undead?” Professor Luo

asked her quietly.

“I…I do, but I’m not willing to go with them,” the spirit said.

“Them? thee others were puzzled.

“It means she has multiple Soul Frames. The one that is left here is her Soul of

Kindness,” Professor Luo explained.

Soul Frames. Mo Fan had heard the term before when he was going after the

Red Demon, but in the case of the Red Demon, each its clones represented a

Soul Frame, but Ding Yumian alone had multiple Soul Frames!

“Ding Yumian’s metal strength was unusually high. It was already on par with

the mental state of a Forbidden Mage, so it is normal for her to develop

multiple Soul Frames,” Professor Luo went on.

Her mental state was already comparable to a Forbidden Mage, when she was

only a Super Mage?

Councilman Zhuang and Dean Lee were seriously retarded! With more time

and training, Ding Yumian could easily have taken out an army of sea monsters

on her own, without having to sacrifice herself!

Every Disaster-bringer Mo Fan had learned of so far had unlimited potential if

they used their talents wisely.

Unfortunately, not one of them was treated fairly. The Heresy Judgment Court

accused them of being Heretics who would bring disasters to the people around

them. Most people chose to believe in the Heresy Judgment Court. Were they

afraid of the disasters they might bring, or were they afraid they would become

too strong and grow out of their control?

If only they were given proper treatment and training…

Ding Yumian’s unique power could even have been the most effective weapon

against the Tribe of Sea Gods, since she could sever the connection between

them and the sea monsters. That way, the sea monsters would never be able to

threaten the Magic City!

“Can you come with us to Dongfang Oriental Tower? Your other Soul Frames

have sided with the Tribe of Sea Gods and invaded the city,” Dean Xiao said.

“Min, but I don’t think I can convince them. They are in great pain and are

driven by anger. They..” Ding Yumian said.

“It’s fine, just do your best,” Dean Xiao said.

If they could not find a resolution, the Magic City would have to face a new

enemy.

She was the new empress of the Undead who had risen from the bottom of the

sea. She would continue to grow stronger over time!
