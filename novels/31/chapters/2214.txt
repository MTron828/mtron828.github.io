They could not afford to be impatient when going up against the Black Vatican. They still had to maintain their cover as lecturers of the Aorus Sacred Institute as they continued to follow their leads. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan helped Lily with her Awakening while pretending nothing had happened. If the villagers had already colluded with the Black Vatican, the Magic Association would also be affiliated with the Black Vatican. He had to stick to his plan.

Lily’s Awakening was surprisingly successful. She ended up Awakening the Wind Element as her First Element, which was the most ideal Element for her. She almost forgot about the Black Vatican when she left the Magic Association with a smile on her face.

“What should I do next? How do I use my Wind Magic? Will I suddenly fly into the sky with angelic wings on my back like my seniors?” Lily asked several questions all at once.

“You should calm your thoughts and focus on sensing the Stars in your Spiritual World. The Awakening is only the first step for Mages. You still have much to learn before you can Cast a spell. You must cultivate diligently. The path to becoming a Mage isn’t as easy as it seems. Look at her, she was very excited to become a Mage like you too, but she’s only an Intermediate Mage after so long,” Mo Fan pointed at Apas.

Apas harrumphed in disagreement. She had been cultivating diligently too, but as a noble Medusa, she had to have plenty of sleep to have smooth skin and powerful magic. She could only spend the rest of her free time cultivating. She was already making some impressive progress!

“Stars? What Stars?” Lily asked.

“Mu Bai, can you explain to her since you were the top student in our class. Oh, you’re a teacher now too,” Mo Fan said.

“You teach magic theory,” Mu Bai replied blandly.

“Screw you, we are from the same class. You know my scores in exams. Just cut the crap and treat the herbalist’s adopted daughter nicely. We need her to help for the leads we have on the Black Vatican!” Mo Fan chided him.

“You are a genius too, if you can score only six marks on an exam. You have the guts to teach university students in one of the top schools in the world. If it was me, I would have detonated myself on the spot so I wouldn’t embarrass my country,” Mu Bai shot back.

Mu Bai explained the Stars properly to Lily despite complaining about it. Luckily, Lily was a smart girl. She was able to pick up the basics very quickly.

“Ugly chick, I’m telling you, this is only the beginning for you. Making your way into the Aorus Sacred Institute is like climbing the tallest peak of the Andes Mountains from the ground. Don’t act so full of yourself,” Zhao Manyan warned her.

“It’s fine. I’m glad that I’m a Mage now. One day, I’ll own a school badge and attend the classes as a student. I’ll be living in a luxurious condo and enjoy my meals in the restaurants with a sea view while chatting with handsome seniors...” Lily had high hopes for her future.

Zhao Manyan poured a bucket of cold water on her. “A dumb girl like you only lasts for a few episodes in a drama or an anime. You also made the biggest mistake, like watching your family’s photo before going to war or promising you are going to retire after one last job. People like you always die in the films, especially when you are involved with the Black Vatican. Those guys will kill you without hesitation if things get spicy to protect their secret!”

“I think people who utter too much nonsense like you die the quickest instead!” Lily retorted.

“Lily, the people of the Black Vatican are merciless. You might be related to one of them, but they won’t show any mercy when they feel threatened. You should pretend you have gone back to the Aorus Sacred Institute for work. Apas will be protecting you. Be careful with everything, do you understand? Otherwise, the things you desire are the imagination the little match girl has before she dies in the cold,” Mo Fan said coolly.

Lily could not afford to treat her life as a joke. If she sided with them, the Black Vatican would eventually notice them as the trio continued to pry into their business. Lily had no chance of protecting herself, and would die if they failed to keep a close eye on her. Mo Fan did not want Lily who had just become a Mage to be sacrificed in their fight against the Black Vatican.

“Mm, I’ll keep it in mind!” Lily nodded. She was quite friendly toward Mo Fan now after he had helped her with the Awakening.

The herbalist had taught her many things, but none of them were to her interest. She had no interest in insects, spiders, toads, and rats. She hated the creatures in sewers. She wanted to stay at the Aorus Sacred Institute, which was like Heaven to her, and enjoy a life as a slutty university student!

They went back to the Aorus Sacred Institute and were about to take a rest when some students carried an injured man up to them.

Miyamoto Shin was with them. He told Mo Fan with a sorry face, “I’m sorry, Lecturer Mo Yifan, I tried to stop it, but I wasn’t strong enough to stop Herr Casa’s attack in time. I’m afraid Ritchie won’t be able to take part in any duels for quite a while.”

“I’m sorry, Lecturer Zhao Yanzu, I lost the duel...” Ritchie was badly beaten up. He was hurting even as he talked because of the wound on his face.

“Boleyn, what happened?” Mo Fan asked with a frown.

Ritchie was in very bad shape. An overwhelming Ice Magic had damaged his bones, making them very fragile. Even the slightest movement could break them. Boleyn had no idea how to treat his injuries.

“Ritchie stumbled into Herr Casa in a duel. Herr Casa used it to get his revenge on Ritchie... He was using his strange Ice Magic to inflict serious injuries on Ritchie so he couldn’t recover in the near future. The Ice Magic drives my Healing Spirits away when I tried to heal him,” Boleyn reported grimly.

Normally, the Healing Element was only ineffective against injuries inflicted with Dark Magic as both the Healing Light and Healing Spirits would dissipate quickly under the strong influence of any Dark Magic.

It was rare to see the Ice Magic hindering the Healing Element. Even the medicine that Xinxia gave Mo Fan was only a little helpful to Ritchie.

“He can’t move now. His bones would break if he tried to move his finger,” Boleyn said.

“That Herr Casa is pretty vicious to go so far in just a duel!” Fan Ding snarled.
