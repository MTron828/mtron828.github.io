“If the islands aren’t too far apart, maybe I can freeze the water between the islands,” said Mu Ningxue.

“Freeze the water? Do you need the help of Ice Magicians?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

Mu Ningxue shook her head and said, “I can handle it myself, but I won’t be able to participate in the battle.”

“If we can freeze the water between the four islands, it would greatly restrict the Scarlet Soaring Demons strength. We can handle the rest,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“Cool, let’s get to it!”

“We should escort Mu Ningxue to a suitable position first. Once the water is frozen to a certain thickness, even if the creatures broke a hole on the ice and went underwater, they wouldn’t be able to attack us, either. Brilliant thinking!”

The four islands were densely covered in plants. However, most of them were scarlet. From afar, the islands looked like four enormous flames burning on the surface of the ocean.

Gong Yu found a perfect route to sneak into the islands when he went scouting. It was the advantage of having a smaller team, as a whole troop of Battlemages would easily catch the Sea Monkeys’ attention before getting close to the outer islands!

These beast-type creatures possessed a certain level of intelligence among the demon creatures. They knew how to weigh the advantages and disadvantages. When they saw a large group of Magicians approaching, they would jump straight into the boundless ocean, and the humans could only retreat in vain!

The group sneaking into the islands only consisted of ten people. Nan Rongni did not follow them to the islands. She was in charge of looking after the boat, to secure their escape if the situation became too dangerous for them. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The group of ten included Ai Jiangtu, Nanyu, Mu Ningxue, Mo Fan, Gong Yu, Zu Jiming, Li Kaifeng, Zhou Xu, Jiang Shaoxu, and Zhao Manyan. Gong Yu was a typical wind assassin. He had already eliminated the Sea Monkeys patrolling the shore before the others arrived. Li Kaifeng’s fighting style was similar to Gong Yu’s, but Li Kaifeng’s Elements were Shadow and Wind. His attacks were not as aggressive as Gong Yu, but his infiltrating ability was more impressive. The weak Sea Monkeys were nailed by Giant Shadow Spikes before they even realized it!

Li Kaifeng fired the Giant Shadow Spikes continuously, sealing the movements of the Sea Monkeys that were tanning on the shore. They could not even make a single sound.

Gong Yu turned into a rapid blur. There was almost no pause between his movements.

The Sea Monkeys only survived for a few seconds, before they fell to the ground after their throats were slit open...

A Sea Monkeyclimbed out from a gap between some rocks. It was shocked to discover that all of its companions were falling to the ground. It was stunned for a moment, before coming to senses and fleeing!

“Damn it, we’ve missed one!” Gong Yu was anxious. He did not expect there was one hiding between the rocks.

The Sea Monkeywas very quick. It was already a few tens of meters away. Its cry was not loud, the sound of the waves were covering it. However, if it ran another hundred meters, the Sea Monkeys in other areas would hear it!

“Blink!”

As Gong Yu’s heart sank, he heard a cold voice behind him!

Gong Yu was startled when he saw a blurry figure appear ahead. Space rippled as the blurry figure slowly turned into Ai Jiangtu’s well-proportioned physique...

Ai Jiangtu was standing on a rock, only around sixty meters away from the fleeing Sea Monkey Monster. He quickly reached out his hand and grabbed at the air, stopping the Sea Monkey in its tracks.

Ai Jiangtu indifferently swiped his hand to the side. The Sea Monkey started flying and was hurled at a coral reef with great strength.

The Sea Monkey hit the reef with its head. Its brains splattered everywhere. It had died a cruel death before having a chance to let out a cry!

The group looked on in disbelief, especially those who were still on the boat.

Ai Jiangtu was still on the deck just a second ago. He was at least a hundred meters away from the shore, yet in the next second, he had already appeared on the shore and caught up to the fleeing Sea Monkey!

From the grab, to the toss that instantly killed the creature. The whole process took less than two seconds. The man was indescribably elegant and imperious!

Many in the team had only witnessed the capabilities of their captain for the first time during the training. They were absolutely dazzled by his mastery of the Space Element.

Mo Fan already met Ai Jiangtu before. He never forgot how the man had knocked the teachers of Pearl Institute away when he got angry!

“He’s already an Advanced Magician!” Jiang Shaoxu’s eyes flickered, as if she had found new prey.

“He achieved the Advanced Level quite some time ago,” added Zhou Xu.

“Is that... Blink, such a fascinating ability. He was already a hundred meters away in the blink of an eye, the movement spells of the Wind, Shadow and Earth Elements are nothing compared to it!” yelled Zhao Manyan.

Ai Jiangtu was a cautious man. He closed his eyes and used his Space Element to inspect the area.

He gave Nanyu a hand signal after confirming that no Sea Monkeys were nearby.

Nanyu was most likely the only one that understood Ai Jiangtu’s military sign language. Nanyu told the others that they were clear to go ashore. The boat then moved away from the islands. Nan Rongni used the Disguise Device to conceal its presence.

The Disguise Device was a kind of Light Element camouflaging device. It was similar to an enormous mirror covering the boat. From afar, it looked like there was nothing there. Only the military would have access to devices like these... it too was a prohibited device.

After the boat was hidden, Nan Rongni stayed to keep an eye on it while the others successfully sneak onto the islands.

“We’ll proceed to that spot and let Mu Ningxue freeze the water between the islands. Not only will it help us to wipe out the Scarlet Soaring Demons, it will also give us an upper hand in the fight. However, we’ll need a few people to attract the Scarlet Soaring Demons’ attention and lure them away, just so they won’t realize what we’re trying to do until the ice is thick enough,” Nanyu revised the plan with the others.

“If you need some huge action, just leave it to Mo Fan. He has Lightning and Fire, he only needs to fire a few Spells at the islands to provoke the whole pack of Scarlet Soaring Demons...” Zhao Manyan immediately elected Mo Fan to do the job.

“I don’t mind, but I’ll need someone to protect me while I’m channeling the Spells,” said Mo Fan indifferently.

Ai Jiangtu nodded and said, “You two, head over to the other side and attack the nest, the louder the better.”

Zhao Manyan’s face fell dark upon hearing this.

When it came down to blasting a demon creatures’ nest, it was fine if everything went accordingly to the plan. However, if anything went wrong, they would soon find themselves surrounded by the infuriated Scarlet Soaring Demons.

-Mo Fan is such a bitch, to seek revenge for the smallest grievance!-
