The Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon was already unstoppable, but Mo Fan had basically added oil to the fire. It felt like the whole city was going to collapse under the enormous pressure from the massive creature now clad in dazzling gold. Its overwhelming Ruler-level presence surged like a wild storm, turning the clock tower into a stranded island that might be devoured by fierce waves at any second. The people defending it no longer had a say in their lives.

“Let’s take the Barrier Core and run away!” Xie Qinghua ordered with a pale face.

It was all meaningless. The little spark had set the whole valley on fire. There was now no chance of putting it out. Xie Qinghua no longer had any hope of defending the Elemental Capital. She only hoped the Barrier Core did not fall into the terrifying creature’s hands. If the creature absorbed the Barrier Core, they would have basically created a terrifying rock demon that would bring even greater calamities to the country!

“Master...” Wen Xia was dismayed.

“Wen Xia, deactivate the barrier. You must bring the Barrier Core to safety, do you understand!?” Xie Qinghua said sternly.

“Master, Wen Xia isn’t afraid of dying,” Wen Xia said.

“It has nothing to do with your resolve. Do you really want to see a terrifying rock demon be born? We have already lost the fight. Are you going to let the monster absorb the Barrier Core and flatten our province? We will never forgive ourselves if we let that happen!” Xie Qinghua said.

Wen Xia bit her lips so hard that they almost bled. She did not expect it to come down to this.

Perhaps if they chose to give up on establishing the barrier and focused on fending off the demon creatures, the city and their men might still be standing now, even if they had failed to set up the elemental capital. But now, those Mages had all become part of the Rock Monsters. Their city was destroyed, and they were still struggling to figure out a way to save the Mages trapped inside the bodies of the Rock Monsters.

The unstoppable fire had spread across the valley... the city was about to become history.

—

Apas, wearing a short T-shirt with her midriff bared, stood on top of a building that was relatively intact. The cold moon was right above her, its icy brilliance setting off her noble, alluring figure. Her golden dust eyes made her look even more mysterious!

“These monsters don’t have a fixed leader. Even if I force that thing to detonate itself, the Rock Monsters will still attack the clock tower,” Apas said, as if she was mumbling to herself.

“You can’t let it detonate itself, Apas!” Mo Fan’s voice came out of the Contract.

“What are you doing?” Apas said.

“Cut the crap, use everything you have to help me. Otherwise, you’re screwed if I die.”

“You lunatic!” Apas snapped.

Apas gathered her focus. Her golden-dust eyes reflected the cold brilliance of the moon, like it was the only source of light in a city devoured by darkness, looming over the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon!

The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon grabbed its head and let out a painful screech, as if its soul had just received a serious blow.

Its bloodshot eyes suddenly shifted. As Apas’ stare gradually became more menacing, the Ruler-level creature’s ferocious aura dissipated suddenly.

Its body turned cold and lifeless. It suddenly stiffened as its arms fell to the side.

The people on the clock tower were confused when they saw the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon suddenly fall still, like a soulless creature.

What had just happened?

Why did the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon, whose aura alone was enough to destroy the city, fall dead all of a sudden?

The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon’s eyes suddenly sprang open. A terrifying dark red light burst out of them.

Its eyes did not have the same savage look as before. They surprisingly displayed some kind of emotion, like the pride and ruthlessness of a powerful human.

It slowly raised its hand. As someone with the power of the Demon Element, Mo Fan was familiar with the feeling of being imbued with overwhelming strength, but it was his first time taking control of a hundred-meters tall body. His eyes were on the same level as the top of the skyscrapers. The buildings and streets were like toys to him. The humans were as tiny as ants!

“What exactly is this evil power in your blood and your soul!?” Apas’ voice suddenly interrupted his thoughts. She sounded a little uneasy.

Apas was shivering in fear on top of the building she was standing on. She had encountered something inside Mo Fan’s body that sent chills down her spine, as if she had accidentally entered an underworld where a demon was about to break free of its chains!

Mo Fan knew what Apas was referring to. However, if he knew the demon in his body would not have allowed anyone to take over his body in the first place, he would not have had to inject himself into the creature’s body like a microchip!

The Demon Element!

Mo Fan initially thought Apas was going to take over his consciousness, or the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon would absorb him, but when he went into the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon’s body, not only did he retain his consciousness, but the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon’s attempt to absorb him backfired too!

Apas’ Medusa’s Gaze and the wrath of the Demon Element simply tore the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon’s soul into pieces, leaving behind only an unusually strong body that was now under Mo Fan’s control!

Mo Fan felt like he had just entered a huge mecha warrior. The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon was him, and he was the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon!

Mo Fan grinned. The stiff face of the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon grinned too. The people on the clock tower were bewildered. They wondered if they were imagining things.

The rock demon turned around and faced the huge army of Rock Monsters. Its gaze greedily scanned the Rock Monsters.

The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon wrapped one hand over the other fist and cracked its knuckles.

It extended its neck to the sides and rotated it in a circle, producing huge cracking sounds too. Its body parts felt a little stiff still after the recent evolution.

The soldiers and Mages on the clock tower were absolutely dumbfounded when they saw the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon’s hijinks.

Was the terrifying Ruler-level creature seriously warming up with its back to them before it started to destroy the city?

The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon let out a deafening roar. It took a step forward and extended its arms before swinging its huge fist at the Rock Generals.

A huge gust of wind swept forward with the blow!

Everything in front of the fist was smashed into pieces, leaving a ravine over half the city’s length along the trail. Countless Rock Generals were killed and turned into dust instantly!
