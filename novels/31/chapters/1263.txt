“If they are here for the Totem Beast, they won’t give up so easily,” Mu Ningxue stated.

“Not many people know about the Totem Beasts. I bet there’s someone giving orders behind the Research Union. You should be more careful from now on. Try not to fall into their hands,” Mo Fan advised her.

“Maybe we should assign Bola to protect her for the time being,” Mu Ningxue ventured. Mu Ningxue did not want to lose Yu Shishi after learning her extraordinary capabilities that were perfect for defending their territory.

“Bola has his own mission,” Mo Fan was unwilling to assign Bola to protect Yu Shishi. Mo Fan was only helping Yu Shishi because he was bored. He would never assign Bola, who was assigned to protect Mu Ningxue, Lingling, Liu Ru, and the others to protect someone else. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After settling Yu Shishi down, Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue stayed behind and discussed matters.

“Things are getting serious now that a Totem Beast is involved. Those guys clearly have a great authority giving orders behind them. It’s going to be tricky if we want to protect Yu Shishi,” Mo Fan said.

“But if we can help her overcome the trouble, she might be willing to swear loyalty to us. I can’t think of anyone more suitable than her to protect our land,” Mu Ningxue agreed.

“By the way, I should pay Professor Shi a visit. He might not even believe there are Totem Beasts still alive apart other than the Black Totem Snake, and Yu Shishi is the main lead,” Mo Fan said.

“Mm, it’s better if we ask for more information.”

Mo Fan went back to the Magic City. Instead of going straight to Professor Shu, he went to the Clearsky Hunter Agency first.

He pushed open the door with the little bell on it; the crisp chime echoed inside the room. He looked into the room and saw Lingling leaning forward onto the bar with a schoolbag on her back. It was like she was about to become moldy from boredom.

Lingling smiled as soon as she saw Mo Fan. However, her smile was soon replaced with a strong grievance. The little girl harrumphed coldly!

Mo Fan walked up to Lingling and gave the little girl a huge hug. He said with a grin, “My little Lingling, have you been missing me?”

“I thought you forgot that you’re still a Hunter of the Clearsky Hunter Agency!” Lingling snapped back.

She had to go to school obediently whenever Mo Fan was not around. The problem was, sending someone as intelligent as Lingling to school was like asking a university student to go to kindergarten!

She was happy that Mo Fan had come, as she could finally hunt some demon creatures, go on an adventure, or start some high-reward quests!

“Any jobs worth doing lately?” Mo Fan asked with a shameless grin.

“We’ve missed out on the good ones. The rest are either too dangerous or not rewarding enough.” Lingling was clearly still holding a grudge against Mo Fan.

“Let’s put our Hunters work aside for now, then. I need you to investigate the Totem Beast that once ruled over the Huang He region in the past, as much information as you can!” Mo Fan said.

“A Totem Beast?” Lingling’s eyes suddenly glittered. The little girl immediately livened up.

The Totem Beasts were legendary existences. The Hunter Union had many quests that had been around for a long time, since no one had managed to accomplish them; some of them were related to the Totem Beasts. Lingling had already collected the information that the Hunter Union had on the Totem Beasts. She was waiting for Mo Fan to become stronger before they attempted to solve the mysteries of the Totem Beasts. To her surprise, Mo Fan had found the clues about a Totem Beast first!

Information about the Totem Beasts was extremely lacking. The ancient ruins had either faded into history or were buried in the territories of demon creatures. It was extremely difficult to dig up any trace of the Totem Beasts, let alone have any clues about their whereabouts.

“Which Totem Beast is it? Gramps might have some information about it!” Lingling was more cheerful now that she finally had something to do.

“I only came because Old Bao might know something about it. I heard from Liu Ru that he has a lot of information about the past. It’s the Moon Moth Phoenix. Do you remember the moth woman that I was dealing with? Mu Ningxue is willing to take her in so she can protect our territory. To our surprise, the moth woman is somehow related to the Totem Beast, the Moon Moth Phoenix! She’s currently being targeted by the people of the Research Union, but I believe there’s someone else behind the Research Union. I’ll need you to investigate and see who the people trying to get their hands on the Moon Moth Phoenix are,” Mo Fan told her.

“Alright, wait here, I’ll take a look upstairs!” Lingling dashed up the stairs. There were gaps between the stairs. The little girl completely forgot that she was wearing a short skirt. She carelessly climbed up the stairs right in front of Mo Fan.

Mo Fan quickly moved his gaze away. It was inappropriate to have evil thoughts on the gorgeous little Lingling, even when she was purposely exposing her cute baby blue panties in front of him.

Lingling came down the stairs with a huge book. “I found something. The human tribe under the Moon Moth Phoenix flourished quickly, but they declined rapidly, too. They were only around for a short period in history. I believe it’s mainly because of the short lifespan of the Moon Moth Phoenix... based on the information I have, moths are short-lived creatures. Some only live for a few nights. Although the Moon Moth Phoenix is a Totem Beast, she could not violate the laws of nature. She could only live for seven months, and will then revert into a cocoon after seven months!”

The little girl was very engrossed in things she was interested in. She did not even realize she was about to trip. Luckily, the observant Mo Fan quickly used his Telekinesis to stop her from falling.

“Seven months, that short?” Mo Fan was surprised.

The Black Totem Snake would only go through ecdysis once every ten years or so. However, it was not born again with the ecdysis, it was only changing his skin.

The Moon Moth Phoenix was a Totem Beast too, yet her lifespan was only seven months. How did she manage to survive for so long?

It was just as Yu Shishi had mentioned. The Totem Beasts might be powerful, but they were vulnerable too similar to the moths. If someone was plotting against them on purpose, they would die very easily!

“Are we trying to find the Moon Moth Phoenix?” Lingling asked.

Mo Fan shook his head and said, “We’re trying to stop the people of the Research Union from finding her. Totem Beasts have always been kind to humans. We might even need their help against the demon creatures in the future...”

“Alright, I’ll investigate who’s behind the Research Union. It’s quite serious if it has something to do with a Totem Beast! You should discuss it with Zhu Meng and my sister,” Lingling said.
