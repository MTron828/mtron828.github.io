“Did you all remember what I said?” Mo Fan was pretty calm even though he was flanked by two strong opponents.

Mo Fan was obviously not talking to the cunning vixen, Asha’ruiya. He was talking to his teammates.

Ai Jiangtu, Zhao Manyan, Mu Tingying, Guan Yu, and the others still remembered Mo Fan mention that if they found themselves in the worst situation possible, they had no choice but to fight with all they had!

The five members of the English team were clearly more aggressive than the Greek team. They kept blasting Zhao Manyan’s defense with their destructive spells.

Zhao Manyan did not preserve his strength either, using all his magic equipment and spells to defend the team from the attacks.

While resisting the attacks from the English team, Ai Jiangtu, Mu Tingying, Guan Yu immediately attacked the members of the Greek team. They immediately cast their strongest spells and focused on the same target. They were not hoping to win the match, but aiming to injure the enemy!

Mo Fan did the same thing too. Even though Zorro who was said to be the strongest in the tournament, he was not actually a pure destructive Mage. It was unlikely that he could knock Mo Fan out in a short period.

Mo Fan aggressively attacked Asha’ruiya like a mad hound, as if he was completely disregarding Zorro’s existence.

At the start, the Greek team could still hold their ground; they were a powerhouse, after all. However, they immediately realized that something was not right after a few rounds.

Even though both the English team and the Greek team were picking on the Chinese team, the members of the Chinese team were fighting the Greek team recklessly. They were willing to take the risk of being disqualified just to inflict serious damage on the Greek team!

The Chinese team was using their magic equipment at will, thus the Greek team was forced to use their magic equipment, too.

Magic equipment was like a consumable in a match, as they would no longer be available for the rest of the match once they were used. Despite the two teams agreeing to take the Chinese team out, the Greek team was the only one that was paying the price, to the extent that someone on their team was at risk of being disqualified, too!

—

Not long after, the Greek team realized that the situation was unfavorable to them.

Asha’ruiya panted heavily. She briefly freed herself from Mo Fan’s aggressive attacks and glared at Zorro, “Keep him busy.”

“I’m planning to, but he’s ignoring me completely!” Zorro said helplessly.

“Why do I feel like you’re letting us fight instead?” Asha’ruiya could easily tell that Zorro was obviously not giving his best.

Mo Fan was only targeting Asha’ruiya, thus Zorro was more than willing to be a bystander. If Asha’ruiya ended up being injured or using a piece of important magic equipment, it would be easier for Zorro to fight her later.

Zorro had also discovered that Mo Fan was not the only one that was targeting the Greek team. All the other members of the Chinese team were going all out at the Greek team too! When the assassin Mage of the Chinese team was disqualified, he even managed to leave the Healer of the Greek team with serious injuries!

The Healer of the Greek team was still in the match, yet it would clearly take him some time to fully recover from his injuries. It would significantly weaken his performance!

“Mo Fan, are you out of your mind? What good will it bring to you?” Asha’ruiya protested anxiously.

“Enough talk! Eat this, you cunning, little foxy!” Mo Fan was not in the mood to talk to Asha’ruiya at all. He would not have been so aggressive if Asha’ruiya had not tried to set him up. If Asha’ruiya wanted to pick on the Chinese team first, he would make her team pay a great price too!

Mo Fan had six Elements in total. As he went all out, even Asha’ruiya was struggling to take him, on despite her outstanding strength. The destructive spells just kept coming. Asha’ruiya had already used two of her defensive items. Even though Zorro had been quiet throughout the fight, Asha’ruiya knew the man was gloating over it secretly!

“AHHH!!!” A cry of agony came from the woods not far away. Asha’ruiya created some distance between him and glanced into the direction of the cry.

She grinned when she saw the defensive Mage of the Chinese team being eliminated. However, her grin froze when she saw one of her teammates being knocked out by Ai Jiangtu, too!

Their plan to disqualify the Chinese team first was working like a charm, since they had managed to disqualify two members of the Chinese team when the match had only just begun. However, the Greek team had also lost a member, and their Healer was seriously injured!

On the other hand, the English team was perfectly fine. They did not seem like they had gone through any battle at all!

Asha’ruiya did not think the Chinese team would react like this. She glared at Mo Fan, who was pursuing her relentlessly.

“Everyone, fall back immediately, and stop attacking the Chinese team,” Asha’ruiya finally ran out of patience. She quickly gave the command to the members of the Greek team.

The members of the Greek team were not idiots. At this rate, both their team and the Chinese team were like two shepherds in a quarrel, while the English team was obviously the wolf running a winning game!

“Asha’ruiya, stop running! Come play another three hundred rounds with your daddy!” Mo Fan yelled when he saw Asha’ruiya fleeing into the distance.

There was no way Asha’ruiya would continue fighting the maniac. If she did, their team was surely going to lose the match!

—

Asha’ruiya quickly regrouped with her team and started evaluating their condition.

Their substitutes would soon enter the battlefield. They had to ensure that their new substitute was not ambushed by the enemy.

The teams in the mixed battle could only substitute members during certain time frames that occurred every fifteen minutes. A new member could only enter the match during that time, and regardless of how many members of a team had been knocked out, the teams were not allowed to send their members in outside of the time given, even if they still had chances to do so left.

In addition to it, if a whole team was knocked out before they could substitute new members in, the team would be disqualified from the match.

As such, the teams had to be extremely careful to not get knocked out by the enemy before new members were substituted in!

The substitute members of a team would be teleported to a certain spot on the battlefield. Therefore, the teams had to prepare themselves to receive the substitute members. Otherwise, the opposing teams could easily take their teammate out when they were still alone, meaning that their teammate would have been disqualified for nothing!

Since the Greek team had lost one of its members, a substitute member would soon enter the battlefield.

If the English team ended up taking out their substitute after they were teleported onto the battlefield, the Greek team would be in great trouble, since the scales were slowly leaning toward the English!

The Greek team was unwilling to find themselves in such a pinch. The truth was, if they continued to work with the English team for fifteen minutes, they were most likely going to disqualify the Chinese team. Their substitutes had no chance of turning the tables again. However, were they still willing to work with the English team?

Quite obviously not!

“We should just ask the English team to keep targeting the Chinese team while we are recovering,” Karolina, a member of the Greek team, proposed.

Karolina was a student of the Parthenon Temple, a destructive Maga with the Plant Element as her primary Element.

“They wouldn’t agree to it, since they are currently in an advantageous position,” Asha’ruiya replied.

It was exactly as Asha’ruiya had thought. Since the Greek team had stopped attacking the Chinese team, the English team had also stopped pressuring the Chinese team.

They had to be cautious too. If they pressured the Chinese team too much, the Chinese team might target them instead, meaning that they would be throwing their advantage away.

At this rate, they only needed to be slow and steady. With the advantage they currently had, they could easily secure the win!

They really had to thank China for weakening the Greek team for them.

“Those Chinese, why are they insisting on fighting us!?” Karolina complained anxiously.

The English team was not going easy on the Chinese team either, yet it felt like the Chinese team held a huge grudge against their team!

“They are only trying to protect themselves. If they tried fighting both teams at once, or just focused on defense, their whole team would surely be wiped out in no time, and they would no longer stand a chance in the match. However, if they only focus on one of us and fight with all they have, the alliance between us and the English team will surely crumble, allowing them to overcome the pinch they were in,” Asha’ruiya explained.

Asha’ruiya was fairly impressed with Mo Fan’s strategy.

She was planning to disqualify the Chinese team first, eager to get her revenge. The Greek team would then take on the English team once the Chinese team was knocked out.

In terms of strength, she was confident that she could take on Zorro on her own.

However, the mad hound Mo Fan had disrupted her plan, placing the Greek team in a disadvantageous position.

“Then what are we supposed to do now? Are we still going to attack the Chinese team? Or should we turn on the English team instead?” Karolina asked.

“Let’s probe the English team,” Asha’ruiya said.

“What about the Chinese team?”

Asha’ruiya bit her lips and replied, “Leave them be.”

The three teams called a truce when it was almost time for the substitute members to enter the battlefield.

It went without saying that only China and Greece were waiting for substitute members. The English team was actually looking for any substitute member separated from their team. Unfortunately, they were not in luck, and did not find any free pickings.

Meanwhile, Mu Ningxue and Nanyu successfully rendezvoused with the team.

Nanyu frowned when she realized that the three remaining members of the team were injured.

She knew their team was going to struggle in the mixed battle, yet to her surprise, it felt like their team was on the verge of losing the match only fifteen minutes into the fight!.

“We’re in pretty bad shape. We can’t really tell how long we can last still,” Ai Jiangtu sat on the ground, Nanyu treating his injuries.

Nanyu was not a true Healer. She was only giving Ai Jiangtu some basic treatment to prevent his injuries from worsening.

Mu Ningxue was inspecting Mo Fan’s injuries, too. Mo Fan’s condition was pretty bad. Both Zorro and Asha’ruiya were incredibly strong. It was impressive that Mo Fan had managed to stay in the match when he had to face both of them at the same time! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Luckily, Mo Fan was surprisingly tough. He was still able to fight as long as his injuries did not worsen.

“What should we do...” Ai Jiangtu was just about to discuss strategy with the team when Nanyu suddenly signaled him to keep quiet.

Everyone immediately focused their attention on her.

Nanyu transmitted her voice into the ears of her teammates, “I just tracked down the Greek team’s substitute member. He’s pretty close to us!”

Everyone’s eyes glittered immediately!

“F**k, let’s take him out!” Mo Fan was the first to rise to his feet.

The others were nursing a strong grievance after what the Greek team did to them. They immediately directed their hatred onto the new member that had not linked up with the Greek team!
