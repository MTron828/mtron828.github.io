Mo Fan’s thoughts were simple: he would return to the Fiery Sorceress straight away, and ask her to guide him and the soldiers out of the Fire Cloud Woods.

After interacting with the Fire Sorceress for a few days, Mo Fan was confident that she would not reject his simple request. Not only was she kind, she was basically very approachable if he did not mention about the Fire Calamity Fruit.

Nanyu had brought around ten people here to search for the Fire Calamity Fruit, and there were only five left, not a great start at all.

Mo Fan managed to find his way back to the Starry Tree. In other words, he also brought Nanyu and her squad to the Fire Calamity Fruit. However, Mo Fan wanted the military to know that, as long as the Fiery Sorceress was still here protecting the Fire Calamity Fruit, there was no chance they could get their hands on it, as it was pretty much committing suicide trying to do so.

“What is this place...” Nanyu was still unwilling to lower her guard when she saw the little slope.

On the slope, the Starry Tree stood alone at the highest place in the valley, with the stars and sun keeping it company.

Not a single Fire Cloud Tree could be spotted across the spacious area, nor was there any creature nearby. The slightly bent trunk of the Starry Tree almost covered the space on the slope, and its dense branches were within the reach of a hand.

“I’ll make this clear; don’t think about doing anything stupid, regardless of what you see. She lives here, and as long as you’re not hostile toward her, she’s very willing to lend anyone in need a hand. I’ll ask her to bring us out,” Mo Fan reminded Nanyu and her crew.

The other soldiers were extremely obedient, probably because they were utterly terrified by the Three-headed Demon Python. They fully obeyed Mo Fan’s words.

“I’ll go ahead and greet her. Don’t worry, she won’t...”

Mo Fan was just about to calm the squad down when a shocking fireball erupted on the Starry Tree.

The fireball was like a blazing sun hanging on top of the tree, burning the surroundings in a fiery red flame. Its fiery tongues could almost reach the ground.

The temperature rose rapidly. The heat was unbearable to begin with, yet it felt like the fireball was going to roast the humans dry.

Nanyu was shocked, and quickly went into a defensive stance. She glared at Mo Fan furiously, as she assumed that Mo Fan had purposely baited them here to harm them.

As Nanyu was about to interrogate Mo Fan, a fiery creature burst out from the fireball.

She stood on the fireball, her figure engulfed in flames. Her outline resembled a woman’s shape, glamorous and dignified.

The fireball under her feet made her temperament colder and unapproachable; none of the Magicians dared to resist her after seeing her appearance!

The flames spurted out in waves. The red fire rings spread forward in an arc, until they reached into the distance and formed astonishing flame clouds!

Raising their heads, the furious, scorching flames almost set the entire sky aflame, like the terrifying scene of an apocalypse!

“Asshole, you dared set us up!” Nanyu felt herself suffocating due to the pressure of the fiery aura. She endured the suppression and roared furiously.

“I would’ve left you guys in the woods if I was trying to harm you...don’t panic, I’ll ask what happened. Someone else must have infuriated her. Damn it, which idiot did that, they almost killed us!” cursed Mo Fan.

The Fiery Sorceress was extremely furious.

When the Three-headed Demon Python tried to eat him, the Fiery Sorceress had unleashed her Ruler aura to express her anger. However, the Fiery Sorceress seemed to have lost her rationality in her anger. Her flames were sprouting into the sky uncontrollably, forming a shocking ocean of flames.

The fireball under her feet was even more shocking. Once it exploded, God knew if Mo Fan and the others would simply be erased together with the Fire Cloud Woods.

Through Mo Fan’s experience with the Black Totem Snake, he had a certain degree of understanding toward the personalities of an extremely powerful creature. He knew that the Fiery Sorceress was not the type of creature that would massacre aimlessly. In fact, she was kinder and more compassionate than the Black Totem Snake.

Someone must have stepped on her tail!

The Fire Calamity Fruit?

The Fire Calamity Fruit on the Starry Tree had disappeared!

The Fire Calamity Fruit was like the Fiery Sorceress’ inverse scale. Now that the Fire Calamity Fruit was gone, it must be the reason why she was so furious.

Mo Fan quickly arrived at that conclusion. When he saw that the Fiery Sorceress was about to throw a destructive fireball in their direction, he quickly jumped forward.

“It’s me, it’s me! I know someone must have stolen your Fire Calamity Fruit, but as I told you, there were people coming here to take away your treasure... your act of killing is meaningless, tell me what happened. Maybe we can help you take the Fire Calamity Fruit back,” Mo Fan calmed his thoughts and tried his best to calm the Fiery Sorceress’ rage in his own language.

The Fiery Sorceress was infuriated. Her first instinct when she saw humans was to butcher them all...

Even when Mo Fan jumped forward, she showed no sign of stopping!

The fireball grew bigger. It was impossible to predict the destruction it would bring once it exploded. Mo Fan knew that even with his Fire Resistance, he had no chance of surviving the blast. His only chance was to convince the Fiery Sorceress!

The Fiery Sorceress was able to understand human language. Her fiery eyes were filled with rage. Just a thought would detonate the shocking fireball.

She glanced at Mo Fan. The flames on her figure burned wildly at a faster pace.

In the end, the flames on her body slowly weakened. She descended from the fireball and landed in front of Mo Fan.

She stared at the soldiers behind Mo Fan coldly. The hearts of the soldiers, including Nanyu were already beating wildly. They did not dare to even move their fingers, let alone try to fight back...

They finally understood why Mo Fan had asked them to forget about getting the Fire Calamity Fruit. The guardian of the Fire Calamity Fruit was too terrifying. She was pretty much the ruler of the Burning Valley!

“Tell me what happened,” Mo Fan calmed his thoughts and asked the Fiery Sorceress sternly.

The Fiery Sorceress did not interact with Mo Fan. She realized that these people were not the same group who had stolen the Fire Calamity Fruit. She glanced toward the west, before her figure flew into the distance.

Mo Fan was about to say something when he shockingly discovered a dark blue spike with an icy aura sticking into the Fiery Sorceress’ back!

The spike had almost penetrated the Fiery Sorceress’s body. It had poked fairly deep into her back.

It was obvious that the icy spike was specifically prepared for the Fiery Sorceress. The chill was suppressing her flame, and seemed to be spreading to the other parts of her body.

The icy spike must have been some Magician’s equipment, and since it had penetrated the Fiery Sorceress’ back, it must have been a surprise attack...
