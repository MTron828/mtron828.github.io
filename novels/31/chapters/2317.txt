Zhao Manyan harrumphed softly when he heard the professor’s words. “She sounds righteous and all, but she’s just using it as an excuse to justify the school’s intervention with the war,” he muttered.

Mo Fan could not agree with him?more.

The Aorus Sacred Institute had already decided to side with the Federation, but they did not want the public to think they were intervening because of politics. It was using the Venomous Insect Shamans as an excuse to join the war.

We suspect the enemy is using biological weapons. We decided to intervene for the sake of mankind!

They could even convince themselves they were doing the right thing if they repeated the slogan a couple of times.

Nevertheless, it was good news for Mo Fan and his friends.

The Venomous Insect Shamans were a group of powerful Poison Mages. According to Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan’s description, they raised insects for many years to turn themselves into monsters, like Insect Men.

These Insect Men were very strong. Ordinary Mages would not stand a chance against them!

“The Venomous Insect Shamans have indeed broken the Magic Laws. If you can help us take them out, the people of the Andes Mountains will be very grateful,” the general went along smoothly.

“We will need a few of your men who are outstanding and familiar with the battlefield to assist us,” the professor said.

After all, they were going to war. The Brown Rebels were not going to show them mercy just because they were from the Aorus Sacred Institute!

“That won’t be a problem. All the colonels and generals are here. They will recommend their best men to you,” the general agreed quickly.

Brigadier General Blair immediately looked at Lt. Colonel Mason. Lt. Colonel Mason quickly glanced at Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai, whom he assumed were blessed by the gods.

“Didn’t you say you are students of the Aorus Sacred Institute? Perfect!” Lt. Colonel Mason exclaimed.

Mo Fan had an urge to kick the idiot to death! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The professor immediately put her attention on them. Every colonel and general in the tent was staring at them now.

The three were clearly wearing uniforms of the military. Why would they be students from the Aorus Sacred Institute?

“Are you from the Aorus Sacred Institute?” the professor asked.

“Mm, sort of,” Mo Fan replied stiffly.

“Show me your badges,” the professor demanded.

It seemed like they could no longer conceal their identities...

The badges of the Aorus Sacred Institute’s branch were clearly not going to work. They only had the badges for teachers; their identities as guest lecturers would be exposed!

They had no idea if the Black Vatican had spies in the Federation Army...

“Oh, it’s you, I didn’t expect to see you here!” one of the female students blurted out. She was looking at Mu Bai in surprise.

“Oh, it’s you. What… what a coincidence!” Mu Bai was surprised too.

The professor looked at her student and asked, “Su Xi, you know him?”

“Yes, professor! Do you remember you once asked me to do research on the rarer species of insects in the Andes Mountains? Mu Bai here was the one who helped me find the Evil Bull Beetle. We often stumbled into one another in the library!” Su Xi had a charming smile. She looked more like a teenage girl around the age of fourteen than an adult.

“Oh,” the professor answered. She no longer needed them to show their badges.

Mo Fan put his badge back into his pocket with relief, a mischievous grin rising on his face.

“Why did you join the Federation Army?” Su Xi asked Mu Bai.

“Ugh... I feel like I should do something instead of wasting my time every day. The Federation Army happened to be recruiting,” Mu Bai explained.

“Aren’t you a Poison Mage, too? That’s great, since we are going after the Venomous Insect Shamans, you might be able to figure out their weaknesses, knowing how knowledgeable you are!” Su Xi was very confident in Mu Bai’s capabilities.

——

Time was of the essence. The general quickly gathered their most reliable men and prepared to face the Venomous Insect Shamans in the next battle.

The raindrops were tapping the tent loudly at night. Mo Fan and his friends were assigned to the specialized troop that was established to deal with the Venomous Insect Shamans. Everyone gathered for a quick briefing. They would set out with the army in the morning.

“Seriously, you always accused me of flirting with the students, but look at you… what a hypocrite!” Zhao Manyan teased Mu Bai.

“I thought you were visiting the library every day to equip yourself with knowledge, but it turns out you were hooking up with someone between the bookshelves!” Mo Fan went along with him.

Hooking up between the shelves? What the actual f**k?

They just happened to be studying in the same section of the library because of the topics they were interested in. They would chat occasionally when they bumped into one another, so why did it sound so filthy when it came out of Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan’s mouths?

“Enough with your wild imaginations,” Mu Bai said coldly.

“You told her your true name, yet you’re asking us not to overthink it?” Mo Fan had already noticed that peculiarity.

“If you didn’t have any ulterior motive, why didn’t you tell her you were a guest lecturer? Tsk tsk tsk, I’m well aware of what you are thinking, since I’m a man just like you. She might be hesitant to approach you if she knew you were a teacher. It would only hinder your progress in getting closer to her!” Zhao Manyan went on with relish

Mu Bai was having a hard time explaining himself.

They’d had a very academic discussion on the species of insects in the Andes Mountain Range when they first met in the library.

Su Xi did not ask who he was at first. She had only asked for his name after they met several times there. Mu Bai told her his true name as he did not want her to feel estranged. He had treated her like a classmate.

“Fine, I admit I was a little interested in her at first… Either way, she did us a huge favor,” Mu Bai forcibly changed the topic.

“That’s true.”

“You’re right. Otherwise, that professor would have insisted on seeing our badges.”

Professors were a level higher than lecturers. Even though they had never seen the professor in the Aorus Sacred Institute before, it was unlikely they would know every professor in the school, especially since many professors were devoted to their research.

She might be someone who did not like attention, or who rarely wasted her time on social events.

“Get some sleep, we are going to war tomorrow,” Mu Bai told both of them.

“I have a question,” Zhao Manyan asked with a serious face.

“If it’s something about Su Xi, you should keep your mouth shut,” Mu Bai said, his eyes narrowed.

“Fine. Mo Fan, why do you think he didn’t take the next step to become closer with Su Xi?” Zhao Manyan turned to the side and spoke to Mo Fan instead.

“Perhaps he assumes he would eventually win the girl’s affection with his knowledge, yet he eventually realized the girl already had a boyfriend?” Mo Fan grinned.

Mo Fan had noticed something during the meeting.

A male student had pulled Su Xi to the side and grumbled after she chatted happily with Mu Bai. The guy was obviously not pleased with Su Xi’s action of befriending a stranger in the library.

As soon as Mo Fan stated his speculation, he heard someone turning away?on his bed?to face the wall.
