When the Fire Calamity took place, various factions began to take action!

Mo Fan’s party, who was currently at the Drifting Sand River was totally unaware that a huge bunch of people was rushing their way to the North Burning Valley.

It was none of the party’s concern for the time being, as the demon beasts in the Drifting Sand River had suddenly become agitated. If they stayed any longer in the Drifting Sand River, even Xinxia’s Psychic Element would be useless against the White Sand Demons.

“Damn, what is going on here!” cursed Zhao Manyan unpleasantly.

First, they were almost devoured by the Fire Calamity at the North Burning Valley, and when they finally made it back to the Drifting Sand River, the demon beasts here were going out of control.

“Are we heading back or going to the North Burning Valley? We have to make a decision now!” said Zhang Xiaohou.

“It’s too late to turn back now, we should head to the Burning Valley as soon as possible...” said Xinxia with a frown.

The crowd felt their hearts going half-cold when they heard Xinxia’s words. The Fire Calamity had completely disrupted their initial plan. That place was a lot more dangerous than they had expected. In Mo Fan’s opinion, it was not worth it to place everyone’s life in danger when the existence of the Flame Belle was still an unknown for the time being.

As such, even though Chen Yi had insisted on continuing on with the adventure, everyone else had lost the interest in searching for the Flame Belle.

To their surprise, even the Drifting Sand River was rebelling too, as Xinxia’s Psychic Element seemed to be losing its effect. From their current location, the distance back to Dunhuang was at least ten kilometers. The time left would not be enough for them to reach safety, and they would most likely be trapped in the middle of the Drifting Sand River.

They might be able to deal with the White Sand Giants in a small area, but Heaven knew how many White Sand Giants would appear in the center of the Drifting Sand River. Once the Psychic Element lost its effect, the White Sand Giants could easily wear the party down with their numbers.

“It’s not possible to go back now, our only option is the North Burning Valley. Let’s hope the Fire Calamity won’t happen again,” said Mo Fan as he quickly made the call.

“Don’t worry, the Fire Calamity has never happened twice in a year, and I think it will be even longer this time,” said Chen Yi confidently.

“We’ll talk later; let’s leave this horrifying Drifting Sand River!” said Lingling.

The party quickly proceeded forward. Xinxia was currently sitting on the Swift Star Wolf’s back with her eyes closed, fully focused on clearing the path for the party. The frown on her face clearly implied the resistance she was receiving from the restless White Sand Giants as she tried to pacify them.

Luckily, the group had not gone too deep into the Drifting Sand River. The barren land of the North Burning Valley soon appeared in front of them. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When they arrived at the shore, they could see a pile of corpses stacked up into a pile in a shocking manner!

Mo Fan clearly remembered that the Warrior-level Killing Armor Beasts were roaming around this area before they escaped into the Drifting Sand River.

It was obvious that the creatures were devoured by the fire while they were hesitating. They were turned into skeletons without any sign of struggling before they could jump into the Drifting Sand River.

“I have to say that I’m done with this place. If I knew it was so scary, I wouldn’t agree to come even if I was beaten to death!” said Zhao Manyan, who felt a chill going down his spine.

The Killing Armor Beasts were as strong as an army troop, yet they were burned instantly into a pile of bones, clearly highlighting how scary the Fire Calamity was.

“Stop bitching like a little girl there; we’re already here, might as well listen to Chen Yi and try searching for the good stuff. Otherwise, how could we possibly profit from all the risk we took just to get here?” Mo Fan mocked him.

“Let’s follow the initial plan by finding the Fire Element Soul Seeds nearby. However, if what Chen Yi mentioned was true, there will be many fresh resources after the Fire Calamity, thus the number of Soul Seeds will increase, which makes it harder to locate the Flame Belle,” said Lingling.

“I don’t think that’s bad news for us,” said Xinxia, who was aware of how nervous everyone was.

Xinxia’s words served as a reminder to everyone.

That’s right, why did they have to look for the Flame Belle?

If they managed to find a few Soul Seeds, or some Fire Element resources which were even rarer, it would still be a win for them. It was rare to find such a good opportunity.

The North Burning Valley had just undergone a Fire Calamity. As such, they would be the only ones here in the greatest Brazier of China. Didn’t that mean they were pioneers, exploring the fertile land?

As they pictured a land full of gold, the fear they had toward the Fire Calamity immediately shrank by half.

“Forget about the plan, let’s go!” Zhao Manyan might be afraid of death, but he adored money as much as he favored his life. It was probably a trait for everyone in the Zhao Family, and the reason why the family was extremely wealthy!

As they ventured deeper into the North Burning Valley with some anticipation, they could feel that the place was incredibly still, as they were unable to see any demon beasts roaming within their range of vision.

After traveling for two kilometers, Mo Fan had already found some Soul Seed Pieces, almost exposed on the surface of the ground.

There were three Soul Seed Pieces. Mo Fan clearly remembered that each such Piece had a price of three to eight hundred thousand on the market. The Soul Seed Pieces he had found were rather high-quality; he could easily sell them for five hundred thousand each!

The place was indeed full of gold if he were able to pick up Soul Seed Pieces from the ground. Oh, it should be full of diamonds!

“Let’s gather as many resources as we can. We’ll split the profit evenly among us later,” said Mo Fan.

“Soul Seed Pieces aren’t bad, but I think there is more valuable stuff around here. Let’s make use of the fact that we’re the first group here to find all the valuable resources. We shouldn’t be wasting too much time on little things like this,” said Lingling.

Zhao Manyan was startled. They had fought and challenged one another at school just to climb higher in the ranking for some Soul Seed Pieces, yet the same Soul Seed Pieces were somehow the least valuable at this place!

As the thought of finding many Soul Seeds, or the things that were more valuable than Soul Seeds crossed Zhao Manyan’s mind, he immediately became energetic, a completely different person from the one who had insisted on going back after seeing the Fire Calamity. He was now walking in front of the party with gleaming eyes!

“Place the Element Sensors here, there shouldn’t be any demon beasts nearby, we’re safe to use them here to analyze to a great distance,” said Lingling.

The others knew it was only a matter of time until they found some Soul Seeds. They quickly buried the Element Sensors into the ground at the most efficient pace they possibly could!

A Soul Seed was priced around fifteen to thirty million, the price for Fire Element ones averaged more than twenty million...

If they could find a few of them, everyone would be rich!
