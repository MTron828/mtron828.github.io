Mu Nujiao and Ai Tutu never wanted to talk to Mo Fan again. This idiot had not listened to their warning or advice at all!

Top ten, top ten, top ten, he’s challenging someone in the top ten, not just some random rookie. Is he really that brainless not to even look at his opponent’s name when he sent out the challenge?!

“Calm down, calm down... hehe,” blurted out Mo Fan when he saw the outraged reaction from the two girls.

“Let’s go, let him suffer himself!” The angry Mu Nujiao grabbed Ai Tutu and left.

“Humph, we even wanted to collect the information for you, I can’t wait to see you being defeated by a girl!” Ai Tutu did not show any mercy either.

Mo Fan felt his balls hurting. He simply wrote his opponent’s rank down without caring who the person was. He never knew the goddess of their Fire School was the expert ranked tenth... great...

It’s all the Flame Belle’s fault. Mo Fan felt like he was losing his sanity lately. Raising a kid was indeed tough!

“Mo Fan, I’m telling you, don’t you think that you’re good just because you successfully challenged the whole Fire School. The students in the top ten are completely different than the students lower than one hundredth rank. Ding Yumian’s strength is actually stronger than her current rank. You’re dead for sure trying to challenge her!” Huang Xingli walked up and slammed her hand on Mo Fan’s desk.

“It doesn’t hurt to try,” said Mo Fan hollowly.

“Try? Who do you think our Ding Yumian is, for you to practice on? Those who want to challenge her have to consider for a month before sending out the notice!” yelled Huang Xingli.

“...” Mo Fan was speechless. He could not help but shake his head when he saw Huang Xingli’s furious face. It seemed like he had offended... three and a half girls today...

A huge crowd had gathered outside of the dueling ground. Normally, the duels related to someone in the top ten would attract lots of spectators, including Magicians from outside of the school.

However, the dueling ground was not open to the public. Not everyone was allowed to enter.

Mo Fan was rather famous due to his outstanding performance among the new students. Apart from earning the title Demon King, he even challenged the entire Fire School after he somehow came back to life. The news about his Double Innate Elements was spread widely too, thus many had come to watch his duel...

However, more students had come to watch Ding Yumian. Not only was she ranked top ten in the Fire School, she was also one of the Pearl Institute’s top ten beauties.

People in China simply liked to create lists of top ten for everything: top ten experts of Pearl Institute, top ten most handsome men in Pearl Institute, top ten beauties of Pearl Institute, etc.

Ding Yumian was easily qualified to enter the list, and was quite famous due to her outstanding strength, too.

The news about the Demon King challenging the goddess of the Fire School spread wildly among the students, and even the owner of the breakfast stall knew about it, so it was not surprising that the dueling ground was crowded with people.

Mr. Qiu Yuhua immediately came over when he saw that Mo Fan was stirring up a scene again. He asked curiously when he saw that Mo Fan was still not heading for the stage, “Mo Fan, why are you still outside? You’re the main protagonist today, many people are waiting for you.”

“I’ll go in a second,” replied Mo Fan.

“Alright, your opponent is quite strong today. Try not to lose too hard...” Mr. Qiu Yuhua clapped on Mo Fan’s shoulder.

Not long after Qiu Yuhua entered the place, Mo Fan brought a young man around the age of eighteen into the dueling ground.

The young man seemed rather inexperienced with huge occasions like this. He looked quite nervous and excited, and seemed to have lots of questions, yet was not sure how to ask them.

As the two entered the dueling ground, Mo Fan realized that there were more spectators than he had expected. Almost every seat in every row was filled up.

There were duels every day, yet the place was pretty much empty when other students were participating in the duels. At times, there would only be one student as a spectator to testify to the outcome of the battle.

However, it was a different story for the duels that involved students in the top ten. Those were spectacular sights.

On top of that, the top ten students were highly respected outside of the school, too. Any change to the ranking would attract the attention of lots of people!

The barrier was established. Ding Yumian seemed to treat the duel more seriously than Mo Fan. She was already on the stage when Mo Fan arrived, like a beautiful white rose, innocent yet glamorous. Her hair that was tied up in a bun, with fringes hanging in front of her chest, every bit as attractive as usual!

If Mo Fan knew Ding Yumian was ranked tenth, he would have skipped her and challenged the ninth rank instead...

A beautiful woman would naturally have a weakening aura, stopping her opponent from being too harsh on her. Mo Fan was a man who had protective feelings for the fairer sex. He was aiming to get stronger by winning the duels, hence he preferred not to be restricted by his principles.

Most interestingly, it felt like Ding Yumian was able to read Mo Fan’s mind. Her pale face wore a determined look as she said to Mo Fan, “You better use all your strength.”

Mo Fan was astonished. Was his expression really so obvious? Or, was the woman so good at reading one’s expression?

Mo Fan finally knew the reason when the duel began. His intention to go easy on the girl was gone instantly, as his expression was replaced by a stern look!

“Soul Impact!”

Ding Yumian was extremely fast at drawing her Star Pattern. The unique energy of the Psychic Element struck Mo Fan’s mind fiercely while the judge’s voice was still echoing in the noisy dueling ground.

Mo Fan initially planned to use his fourth-tier Lightning Strike to secure the advantage. To his surprise, his opponent was faster. The Soul Impact immediately interrupted his channeling, leaving him dazzled for around two seconds.

“Psychic Element, f**k me!” cursed Mo Fan. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan had just learned how powerful the Psychic Element was a while ago. He never thought he would instantly bump into a powerful Psychic Magician in his first duel against someone in the top ten!

The scariest thing about a strong Psychic Magician was their casting speed. If her Soul Impact was faster than every Spell he had, he would never be able to cast an effective Spell throughout the entire battle!

Mo Fan’s style was pure brute force. His outstanding Basic Spells had helped him to dominate opponents with similar strength to him. However, if he could not even finish drawing a Star Pattern, he was pretty much useless!

“Swift Star-”

“Soul Impact!”

“-Wolf...wolf, f**k me!”

Mo Fan immediately had a bad feeling.

Mo Fan was trying to summon the Swift Star Wolf to lift the burden of not being able to cast any Spell, yet he did not even have the chance to cast a Basic Summoning Spell!

He was seriously in a bad position!
