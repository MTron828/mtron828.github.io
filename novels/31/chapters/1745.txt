Mo Fan visited the Awakening Room again under Mui Nujiao’s lead.

The Awakening Room was located in the Oriental Pearl Tower, and made up of reputable Awakening Mages. Not only did they have access to many Awakening Stones, they were able to use their unique methods to increase the odds of Awakening specific Elements.

However, these Awakening Mages were also called Forecasters, since the Awakening was similar to a weather forecast: they necessarily happen every time.

Guo Liyu’s female disciple Xiao Mian, wearing her thick glasses, was the one who received them afte they arrived at the Awakening Room.

“Sister Mui, why are you here!?” Xiao Mian immediately pounced at Mui Nujiao happily, like a little sparrow.

“I brought my friend here to Awaken new Elements,” Mui Nujiao smiled.

“Oh, him?” Xiao Mian studied Mo Fan.

“I’ve been here before,” Mo Fan smiled at her.

“We should have your information in that case. What’s your name? I’ll go take a look,” Xiao Mian dug her head into a cabinet.

She went to another room. Mui Nujiao was initially planning to wait for her, but Xiao Mian soon returned with an apologetic smile. “I forgot the keys.”

Mui Nujiao did not say a word. Xiao Mian ran back to the room, but she soon returned with a blush. She picked up the glasses still on the table.

“Why are you still so clumsy? I’ll go with you. Otherwise, it’s going to take you half a day to sort it out,” Mui Nujiao said.

“Alright!”

Xiao Mian led Mui Nujiao into the archive. It was quite dark inside the room. She switched on the table lamp.

“Sister Mui, it’s rare to see you here with a man. Is he your boyfriend?” Xiao Mian asked curiously.

“Nope,” Mui Nujiao said.

“Oh, is he chasing you, then?” Xiao Mian asked.

“We are just friends. Go look for your stuff and stop asking so many questions!” Mui Nujiao sniffed.

“Oh, oh, his name is Mo Fan, right? I found it,” Xiao Mian flipped through Mo Fan’s information and realized it was quite simple. It only had the time when Mo Fan last visited the Awakening Room, the time and cost for the Awakening, and the Element he Awakened in the end.

Xiao Mian quickly scanned the information with an intrigued face and said, “He’s pretty impressive. He managed to reach the Advanced Level in just a few years after he reached the Intermediate Level. However, Sister Mui is even more impressive in comparison. You are close to reaching the peak of the Advanced Level, right?”

“I still have a long way to go compared to him. Besides, who even said he’s only in the Advanced Level?” Mui Nujiao said.

“If he did not just reach the Advanced Level, are you telling me that he’s in the Super Level?” Xiao Mian rolled her eyes. She assumed Mui Nujiao was joking with her.

Mui Nujiao did not answer. She only stared at Xiao Mian with a smile.

Xiao Mian realized something after some time. She adjusted her glasses and asked cautiously, “Sister Mui, don’t tell me he’s really a Super Mage?”

“Mm, he’s indeed a Super Mage now,” Mui Nujiao confirmed.

Xiao Mian opened her mouth wide. She had only seen a few Super Mages since she started working here, let alone one that was around her age!

“Sister Mu, are you trying to trick me? Is...is he a monster? How did he go from an Intermediate Mage to a Super Mage in such a short time?” Xiao Mian gasped.

Xiao Mian thought it was already impressive that he was able to go from the Intermediate Level to the Advanced Level in a few years. It would be crazy if he actually reached the Super Level!

Mui Nujiao was amused by Xiao Mian’s reaction, but did not explain further. She took the file and went outside. Mo Fan was still waiting for them.

—

“Are you smiling at me?” Mo Fan asked curiously when he saw Mui Nujiao’s reaction.

“I was discussing something interesting with Xiao Mian. Why would I be smiling at you?” Mui Nujiao replied.

Mui Nujiao pouted after finishing her sentence. Speaking of which, why was she feeling happy after seeing Xiao Mian’s reaction after learning that Mo Fan had reached the Super Level? Shouldn’t she be reflecting on herself? They had enrolled in the Pearl Institute at the same time; how did her cultivation fall behind?

“Master Guo, Master Guo!”

They suddenly heard Xiao Mian’s exaggerated cries.

“What’s with the noise? Didn’t anyone tell you that people in our field must remain calm at all times!?” Guo Liyu came out of a room, immediately scolding Xiao Mian.

“Master Guo, Master Guo, that...that guy is a Super Mage. He’s here for the Super Awakening!” Xiao Mian acted like she had just seen a ghost.

The truth was, it was harder to meet a Super Mage like Mo Fan than seeing a ghost!

“What? Super Level! Him?” Guo Liyu looked at Mo Fan. He did find him a little familiar.

“Yes, him!” Xiao Mian repeated. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Guo Liyu walked up to Mo Fan and lifted his hands in a strange posture. He closed his eyes and probed Mo Fan’s Divine Sense with his will.

Mo Fan did not interfere with him, allowing Guo Liyu’s Will to study his Lightning Element.

“Star Ocean... it’s really the Star Ocean!” Guo Liyu’s eyes sprang open. His face was filled with astonishment as he exclaimed, “My Heavens, how did you do it? I only reached the Super Level in my forties, but you have reached it more than ten years earlier than me!”

“Master, didn’t you say we should remain calm at all times?” Xiao Mian reminded him.

“Calm my ass, this is absolutely unfair! Right, who’s your master? You must be the son of a Forbidden Mage, only that can explain it,” Guo Liyu said.

“Uncle Guo, he’s Mo Fan, a student of the Pearl Institute,” Mui Nujiao said.

“Mo Fan? Oh, you’re that Mo Fan... the guy that won the World College Tournament... Hang on, even if you’re that Mo Fan, it doesn’t make sense for you to achieve the Super Level so soon, too! You must have had some special encounters!” Guo Liyu exclaimed.

It was normal for Mo Fan, who spent most of his time in the wild, to have some special encounters!

“I’m come to Awaken new Elements. I came here when I was still an Intermediate Mage and managed to Awaken the Shadow Element, so I believe you can bring me good luck,” Mo Fan told him.

“What good luck? It’s my skill!” Guo Liyu snarled. However, he soon thought of something. He blurted out, “Didn’t you have the Double Innate Elements? Speaking of which, you didn’t just Awaken the Shadow Element the last time you were here! What was the other Element, again!?”

“The Summoning Element!” Mo Fan did not keep it a secret. After all, everyone already knew the truth about his Double Innate Elements.

“Right... give it to me!” Guo Liyu said.

“Give what?” Mo Fan was confused, staring at Guo Liyu, who had reached his hand out.

“Money, you’ve Awakened two Elements, but you still paid the same price for Awakening a single Element. Hurry up and pay what you owe!” Guo Liyu said.
