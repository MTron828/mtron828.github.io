After the Undead were gone, the Water Mages and Light Mages of a high school volunteered to clean up the mess and filth left by the Undead in the area of the Skyscraper Fortress.

‘The Undead were truly gone. They had broken through the dam in the form of a Crimson Tide and attacked the headquarters of the Magic Alliance, but they were gone in no time after the revenant leading them died.

It was like a nightmare, leaving the people who had seen it with lingering fears.

“By the way, is the tide still falling?” Mo Fan pointed at the dried-up sea in the east.

“I don’t think Ding Yumian’s revenge has anything to do with that,” Dean Xiao guessed.

“The Shoreline Alliance is already investigating it. They should find something soon,” Professor Shi said.

“Maybe we are finally going to see that thing…” Dean Xiao seemed to know something, but he did not explain the details.

‘The Undead and the army of sea monsters were gone, but everyone knew there were more Sea Gods leading the sea monsters. The Sea God who had hosted Ding Yumian was not the strongest one, either.

The sea monster tribes were several times the size of the tribes of the demon creatures on land. Many species were still a threat to humanity’s survival. They could only enjoy a temporary peace for now.

The land was colder after the tide had fallen away, and the dried areas began to freeze. There were even icebergs floating close to the shores that were facing the Antarctic Ocean.

No matter how dazzling the lights in the city were, everything felt dim and cold. Households kept their doors and windows shut. The houses in the Magic City did not have heaters like the cities in the north. The people felt like they were walking on needles when they were walking around in their bare

feet.

Many shops closed up. It was the last thing Mo Fan wanted to see, as it meant he would not be able to enjoy delicious food. Life in the city became boring and dull. It was no longer about enjoying life, but a grim survival in a cold season, hoping that winter would pass soon.

“Many people are sick. Their body temperatures remain lower than the normal temperature. Their bodies are unable to stay warm. Many elderly and kids have died in their sleep,” Xinxia reported anxiously.

Many people had failed to adapt to the humid weather and the prolonged cold season.

Many people were suffering from the cold in the five Headquarters Cities. Even if the environment was warm, their bodies had failed to stay warm.

They would feel tired and sleepy. Many had failed to wake up again after losing consciousness.

Xinxia was busy looking for a cure. More people had fallen sick to the strange disease. Its symptoms were similar to a normal cold.

Only a tenth of the people had died in their sleep, but that would significantly reduce the population of the five Headquarters Cities!

“Is it caused by some virus or parasites?” Mo Fan asked her.

Xinxia shook her head. The Parthenon Temple was experienced in dealing with plagues and viruses. She would not have struggled to find the source and the cure if it were that simple.

However, the situation was quite unusual. The people’s body temperature had fallen because of the weather.

Their bodies were finding it hard to endure the cold. Even if they brought the people who were sick to a warm place, their body temperature would still struggle to return to normal.

It was dangerous for a person’s body temperature to drop by even a degree for a short time, let alone for a few weeks or a month!

“Mages are no exceptions,” Xinxia told him.

“What about Fire Mages?” Mo Fan asked.

“They too have fallen ill!”

It was Mo Fan’s first time hearing Fire Mages having a problem keeping warm.

It was a tricky disease. If it was a normal disease, Xinxia could easily stop it from spreading!

“I’ve asked Lingling to collect data about the patients to find those with immunity or those who are prone to it so they could take precautions against it.” Xinxia was so troubled by the matter that she did not have any appetite. She only took a few bites. The dishes had already tumed cold.

“Let’s go together, I’ll help,” Mo Fan said.

“Mmm!” Xinxia nodded.

Xinxia was supposed to enjoy her holiday, but she still had to work. She was not expecting to get any rest considering the precarious situation the five Headquarter Cities were in.

The two headed to the Clearsky Hunter Agency. Jing’an District’s Longtang was oddly cold and quiet right now. The old men who enjoyed smoking outdoors were all tucked in their beds. They no longer had the freedom to go outdoors.

After all, the cold plague had spread through every Headquarter City. No one wanted to catch the disease and die in their sleep!

The Clearsky Hunter Agency was still open. Hunters who could survive in the wild were in high demand in the current situation!

The city was running low on supplies, so the people who were able to collect resources outside the safe zone and retum safely could still make a living.

“Are you guys having a hotpot? We haven’t eaten either!” Mo Fan exclaimed. The Clearsky Hunter Agency was surprisingly lively when they arrived. A large pot was being heated on an induction cooker, and a pleasant aroma had filled the place.

“It’s Mo Fan and Xinxia, here, take a seat. You came just in time!” Old Bao greeted them with a smile.

Lingling was sitting beside Leng Qing. The two looked even more alike after Lingling had grown up. It was hard to differentiate them without taking a close look.

Leng Qing smiled politely. She was still not the talkative type. Lingling was happy to see Xinxia, and quickly got her a chair.

Mo Fan awkwardly discovered there was no seat for him. His three seniors of the Clearsky Hunter Agency were present. He had no choice but to share a seat with Old Bao.

“Sister Xinxia, you should eat more. I’l tell you my latest discovery after we are done.” Lingling was in a great mood, most likely because she had made some discoveries from her experiments. Lingling also blinked at Mo Fan, “Mo Fan, I have some interesting information to tell you, too.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was rare to see Lingling so excited about something.

Mo Fan roughly had an idea what she was going to say, but his focus was on the delicious food on the table. It was less appealing when only the two of them were eating. It was better when everyone was sharing a hotpot together, especially in a cold season like this!
