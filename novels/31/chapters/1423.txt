“I’m really not interested in it,” Mo Fan shook his head.

If he became a Councilman, he would have to worry about the wellbeing of the country and the people. Most importantly, if he made the slightest mistake, it would be magnified and spread wildly. He would have to look after his image at all times and be a role model to others. Frankly speaking, Mo Fan was not that kind of a person. He was the kind that enjoyed teasing young women in broad daylight!

“I won’t force you if it’s against your wishes. I just don’t know how I can possibly repay what you’ve done for the country,” Chairman Shao Zheng did not press the issue. He felt apologetic if he could not offer Mo Fan something in return after everything that he had done.

“I didn’t do them because I wanted to get something in return,” Mo Fan stated.

Stopping the invasion of the Great Pyramid of Giza was proof that it was indeed possible for him to prevent a bitter and hateful tragedy from happening!

“I knew you would say that. A person that hopes to get something in return would never have determination like yours. Either way, I still owe you one. Feel free to contact me if you need anything...” Chairman Shao Zheng said.

“Sure, I shall gladly accept the Chairman’s offer,” Mo Fan nodded.

Despite that, he was most likely not going to ask for anything.

His hometown, the cities he lived in, and his Fanxue Mountain were all along the coastline. Chairman Shao Zheng had done everything he could to guarantee their safety. His stopping the Great Pyramid of Giza suddenly felt insignificant compared to what the Chairman had done. How could he possibly ask the Chairman for anything further?

He was truly a Chairman that deserved admiration!

“If there’s nothing else, I shall not disturb the reunion between you and your little girlfriend,” Chairman Shao Zheng rose to his feet. He gave Mui Nujiao, who was brewing more tea, a polite smile and headed for the door.

“We aren’t...” Mui Nujiao smiled and tried to explain their relationship.

“Oh, oh, I understand, bosom friends, the younger generations are quite open-minded nowadays, unlike us in the old times. We have been thinking too much. The truth is, it’s all about mutual benefits. I won’t be disturbing you guys anymore,” Chairman Shao Zheng said with a serious voice.

“...” Mui Nujiao was lost for words.

Even Mo Fan was completely dumbfounded. As expected of the Chairman, he was well aware of how the society was now. He even used the term bosom friends to describe it; how impressive!

“Ah, right, about the Totem Beasts... I’m asking you for a favor, before I could even repay your kindness, I’m so sorry about that,” the Chairman remembered as he reached the door.

“I’ll continue searching for the Totem Beasts. They are my hope for achieving the Super Level as soon as possible, too. It’s part of my own interests, anyway.” Mo Fan walked the Chairman to the door.

“Sure, I have high hopes in you, as always. Go inside, and safety first!” The Chairman closed the door himself. He did not give Mo Fan a chance to walk him out of Pearl Institute. He was planning to take a stroll around the school and enjoy its night view.

Mui Nujiao completely blushed. What the heck? Why couldn’t he act like a decent and proper Chairman?

——

The door closed, leaving Mo Fan and Mui Nujiao in the room. Ai Tutu had gone out for the night with her classmates. Mui Nujiao recalled the term bosom friend that the Chairman mentioned. She felt extremely uneasy after looking Mo Fan in the eyes.

“I have something to tell you. Ai Tutu and I will be moving away. Are you going to stay here?” Mui Nujiao asked while cleaning up the cups.

“You’ve decided?” Mo Fan asked seriously.

“I think it’s inappropriate for us to stay together. Besides, we’ve already graduated,” Mui Nujiao explained.

“It’s the typical scene where people break up after they graduate!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“What break up? It’s not like there’s anything between us, it’s just...”

“Living apart?”

“...” Mui Nujiao was left speechless again. Why did she feel like Mo Fan was able to take advantage of her the more she spoke?

As a matter of fact, Mui Nujiao did feel at home when she was here. She came from a huge clan; it had bigger houses and lands and more family members, but the bigger a clan was, the more disappointing it was to witness the infighting for power within it. Mui Nujiao felt at ease staying here. She never felt lonely with Ai Tutu by her side. Mo Fan would come back at times, too. He had always been a great motivator to her, and most importantly, she was happy whenever he was here. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ai Tutu liked fooling around. Even though Mui Nujiao had to clean up her messes at times, she was still able to relax here.

Mo Fan was an interesting and reliable person, too. They were not really that close, yet they did not feel distant either, and Mui Nujiao wanted to keep it that way.

However, time was passing gradually, and everyone was heading in different directions. Some paths were eventually going to crumble, and once they did, it would mark the end of their days of living together as students.

“You don’t have to move,” Mo Fan said.

“Mm?” Mui Nujiao did not expect Mo Fan would want her to stay.

“Just treat it as an extra place to stay. You can come whenever you feel like having some fun or relaxation time, or when you miss us. You know that I’m not around all the time, so someone still has to live here,” Mo Fan told her.

Mo Fan did not tell Mui Nujiao that he had bought the unit. If she knew, she would insist on leaving to avoid rumors going around. How could Mo Fan not feel it to be a pity for his plan of keeping two mistresses in the splendid abode to be ruined? He would not mind just watching them, even if he was not allowed to touch them. Perhaps he might decide to be a scumbag one day, and he would need some targets to prey on too. Besides, the unit had great soundproofing, thus it did not matter how loud the girls screamed...(cough cough...)

“I still think it’s better to move out of here,” Mui Nujiao said.

“Don’t, I’m going to miss you two,” Mo Fan blurted out.

He would not let his two gorgeous flatmates run away!

“Move out? Who’s moving? Demon king, are you finally moving? Awesome, you are finally going to move out of here. I have been waiting for this day all along. I won’t have to worry about you peeking on us anymore, you didn’t even give us money after taking advantage of us. It’s such a great loss for Sister Mui and I!” Ai Tutu came in through the door. Her voice immediately filled the whole unit.

“Tutu, what the heck are you even talking about!? What do you mean he’s not giving us money!?” Mui Nujiao blurted out in embarrassment.

Ai Tutu was the only one who would wear revealing sleepwear in the living room. Mui Nujiao would rarely wear anything like that. She might wear some thin sleepwear, since it was comfortable to sleep in it, but she would only do so when Mo Fan was not around. Mo Fan might have seen her in them a couple of times when he came back suddenly, but she would go change right away. It was clearly not her problem!

“Demon king, you’ve occupied us for so long. We would have kicked you out of here if you weren’t paying the rent. Do you know how many men would want to stay with us?” Ai Tutu went on.

“Miss Ai Tutu, can you please talk after you’ve understood the situation? It’s your Sister Mui that wants to move away, not me!” Mo Fan said.

“Ah? Jiaojiao, why are you moving away? Did this pervert bully you? Did he go into your room and set up hidden cameras? Or did he cross the line even further and did something to you when I’m not around... ah, you son of a b**ch, Mo Fan, how could you do this? Why did you target her first instead of me? Don’t I have the hotter body!?” Ai Tutu started screaming.

Mui Nujiao almost dropped the cup in her hand when she heard those words. Mo Fan had his jaw drop, too. It took him some time to collect his thoughts.

“Tutu, what the heck are you talking about!? It’s not what you’re thinking. Besides, why are you even competing for something like that!?” Mui Nujiao was completely lost for words.

“I just thought it wasn’t fair; I’m a girl too, yet why do the perverts always target you even when my size is bigger than yours?” Ai Tutu protested.

Mui Nujiao felt like she was about to faint. Did Ai Tutu not realize Mo Fan was still around? It was fine if they were discussing this in private, but how shameless was she to say it right in front of someone else?!

Mui Nujiao was afraid that Ai Tutu would say something that embarrassed her even more. She quickly dragged the buffoon into her room. At this rate, she would have no chance of redeeming herself!

“Sister Mui, there’s no need to try avoiding rumors anyway. Everyone is already talking about how we are the demon king’s concubines. If you move away, they might think the demon king has driven us away because we are no longer as attractive. No man is going to be interested in us anymore!” Ai Tutu’s voice echoed in the room.

Mo Fan was utterly impressed by Ai Tutu. She had spoken everything he had in mind!

Tsk tsk, setting up hidden cameras in Mui Nujiao’s room... That did sound like a great idea!

——

Some time later, Mui Nujiao came back down to the living room.

She saw Mo Fan sitting on the couch, enjoying some tea. She hesitated for a moment before brewing a new pot of tea and bringing some snacks to the couch.

Mo Fan was immersed in his thoughts. His heart was filled with warmth when he noticed Mui Nujiao’s actions. He could not help but think how lucky the man that married such a gorgeous, elegant, and understanding woman would be... Ahhhh, should he just be a scumbag now? Why would he give such a nice woman away!?

“I think she’s drunk. She’s asleep now,” Mui Nujiao sighed.

If she really did move away, she would have to go separate ways from Ai Tutu. After all, she was going back to her clan. It was unlikely that Ai Tutu would be able to stay with her.

Mui Nujiao was like Ai Tutu’s sister and mother most of the time!

“Didn’t she choose to stay at school?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm, I was offered a job by the school, too. Dean Xiao is hoping that you, me, and Zhao Manyan will take a position in the school. We can come and give the new students some lectures whenever we are back. The schools and institutes are playing an important role in raising reliable Mages under these circumstances... It’s time for me to think about the path I want to take, too. I’m hoping to visit more institutes and schools, and use my clan’s connection to build more magic schools in the Headquarters Cities,” Mui Nujiao said.

“You are thinking of taking the education path?” Mo Fan asked, curious.

“Mm, I can use the reputation I’ve earned from the World College Tournament. My clan is helping me to take hold of the opportunity I have, too... I’m not that good at doing business, either. I’m a Mage, not a businessman. I’ve thought it through recently, and it also happens that my clan has some connections in the education field...” Mui Nujiao poured herself a cup of tea and took a sip.

It was the path she had chosen, and she wanted to hear Mo Fan’s thoughts about it.
