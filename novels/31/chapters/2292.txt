“It’s a blessing from Forneus!” the apish captain cried out excitedly.

The enemies who had been posing a great threat to them had disappeared so suddenly. Some Intermediate Mage must have taken care of them, even though he did not see the spell!

What other reason could he possibly think of to explain his incredible luck, other than saying it was a blessing from the gods?

He was relieved that his parents had forced him to kneel on a huge banana leaf in the garden and pray to their goddess since he was five!

The apish captain led them forward with only eight of his men remaining. He no longer relied solely on his mouth, taking hold of the opportunity to cast an Intermediate Spell of his own.

He was an Intermediate Wind Mage.

He advanced straight into the enemy’s line. The militia, who were only Basic Mages, failed to react in time..

“Wind Disc!” A cloudy tornado appeared above the trench behind the barricade at the apish captain’s shout.

The tornado swept the trench and tossed a few dozen militiamen into the sky. They fell back to the ground after a few seconds.

“There’s an opening! Follow them!” The attacking commander immediately noticed the tornado.

It was surprising that the commander saw the opening amid the rapid flashes of spells from his angle, but still more than three hundred assault troopers raced in the apish captain’s direction!

Most of the enemies on the barricade wall were militia. They were initially abusing their high ground when attacking the Federation Army, but they quickly lost their ground after the Federation Army broke through their lines.

They were not as disciplined as proper soldiers when it came to obeying orders. They lost their cool as soon as the Federation Army broke through the walls.

Two rocks the size of cars fell onto the barricades and wiped out two groups of Brown militia. The militiamen were standing in clusters to maximize the damage of their spells, making them easy targets for the rocks.

The sight was like scoring a strike in bowling, knocking down all the pins perfectly, except for the blood that was splashing everywhere.

The assault troopers climbed up the walls and wiped out another two enemy squads in an instant. The militia on Hope Street were no longer able to hold their ground after the Federation Army broke into the trenches behind their barricades.

“Kill all of these sons of b***hes, HAHAHA!” Black Chimpanzee burst out laughing.

His men let out relieved sighs, not because they were victorious, but because they were still alive!

Mo Fan stood at the side expressionlessly. He casually cast a few Earth Spells to pretend he was contributing.

“These idiots, they probably have no idea we are the ones who created the opening for them,” Zhao Manyan spat on the ground casually.

The Federation Army’s strength was worrisome if it took them so much effort just to break through the enemy’s first line of defense, especially when it was only guarded by militiamen who had been assembled at the very last second. It was likely that they had only undergone some military training in middle school. They were nothing but sheets of loose sand, yet the Federation Army had almost failed to break through their defense.

Mo Fan was clueless about the situation on other streets, yet he could not help but worry after seeing the Federation Army’s strength on Hope Street.

He had created the opening Captain Black Chimpanzee had ‘discovered’.

If he had not lent the Federation Army a hand behind the scenes, he would have found himself once again in the same awkward situation where only the three of them were still standing!

“I wonder if these idiots are going to wet their pants when they encounter the Brown Rebels’ main army!” Mo Fan muttered to no one.

——

The Federation Army had claimed a little victory on Hope Street!

More surprisingly, the battle on Hope Street was the Federation Army’s first breakthrough. The whole army?pressed forward through the opening to advance the destructive brigade of Rock Tanks into the other half of the city.

“Well done, I didn’t expect you to be the first one to reach the top, Mason!” the Lt. Colonel complimented his underling.

“I’m your man, after all, Lt. Colonel Blair,” Black Chimpanzee replied humbly.

“My superior is very satisfied with the victory. He says we are the spears of the Federation and the Brown Army’s rippers!” Lt. Colonel Blair exclaimed.

“I’m really honored!” The apish captain’s smile was so wide that his whole face was shining.

Since when had he ever won their superiors’ favor!?

“They have promoted us right on the spot. You are now a Major. I want you to ambush our next target with five hundred men and launch a surprise attack!” the new Colonel Blair went on.

“Huh? Wasn’t I supposed to withdraw to the second line of duty?” The new Major Mason’s smile froze.

“If you succeed, I will introduce you to the general. You should understand that this is the time when our Federation needs warriors like you the most. When there’s peace, soldiers have to work for generations to be promoted from a little captain to a major, but when there’s a war, one can easily rise to the role of a leader through it, even if you’re just a little recruit!” Colonel Blair encouraged him.

The new major straightened his face after hearing the words! Even the eyes of the survivors by his side glittered.

“You are now my assistant, which makes you the second-in-command. Your soldiers are all promoted to senior sergeants, too!

“It’s true that the odds of surviving are low when you are leading the front, but not many people can rise so quickly in the army even if they died a few times. The Federation has only been established recently. I believe you understand how important our ranks are better than anyone else!” Colonel Blaire announced to all of them.

The new major could feel his blood boiling.

Yeah, they were currently fighting a war. Anyone who contributed during a war would rise quickly through the ranks once the country was stable!

The Federation might become the strongest nation in South America. If he managed to stand out in these dangerous times, he no longer had to worry for the rest of his life. Even his descendants would be respected by the people of the nation!

The survivors were already impatient, let alone the new Major Mason!

“We were promoted to senior sergeants?”

“Were we really promoted to senior sergeants?”

“The general is right, we must contribute to the Federation!”

—

Major Mason felt like a different person when he left the command tent. The sky was oddly clear despite the heavy rain.

Second-in-command! He had become a major just because he was the first person to climb up the wall!

The trend of events brings forth the hero! It is all thanks to Forneus!

“To be honest, I’m a little excited myself!” Zhao Manyan told Mu Bai softly.

“You’re crazy. The feel-good motivational stories during wartime are specifically written for idiots like you,” Mu Bai scoffed.

Mo Fan looked at his uniform.

It was different now. They were no longer little recruits of the Federation.

They were three glorious senior sergeants now!
