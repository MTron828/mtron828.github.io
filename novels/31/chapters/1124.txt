Zorro smiled when he heard the chime of a bell in the distance.

The English team had lost three members, yet Zorro did not seem to be bothered at all. After all, apart from Ayleen and him, the other three were only average on the team. The three substitute members were the real core members of the English team!

“Such a pity, you have failed to take me out even after giving your best!” Zorro mocked them.

The black insects crawled along the ground and continued to attack anyone nearby.

The insects and the tornadoes of Zorro’s Domain were not particularly troublesome to deal with, but when the two combined, things immediately got a lot more complicated.

The members of the alliance had to cast their spells a lot more often to fend the insects off. However, every time they cast a spell, Zorro’s Domain would immediately target them with the tornadoes. As a result, they still received damage from their tornadoes as they were killing the insects, wearing out their defense.

“This Zorro is very good at using his magic to his advantage. We need to send someone to take care of him,” Nanyu said. She had noticed the trick to handling Zorro too.

It was unwise for a bunch of people to fight Zorro at the same time. The man was clearly the strongest among them in terms of cultivation. His Chaos Element seemed to be much stronger than the primary Elements of the others, even though it was only his tertiary Element. It had even managed to reflect Mo Fan’s destructive spells!

“I’ll do it,” Ai Jiangtu said. “I’ll fight him alone, he won’t be able to defeat me so easily!” Ai Jiangtu volunteered.

They could not afford to send too many people after Zorro, since it would only worsen the situation. They only needed a strong Mage with outstanding self-defense to keep Zorro busy. It turned out that Asha’ruiya had made the right choice by focusing on his teammates in the first place.

“Old Ai, don’t push yourself, our alliance with the Greek team is as fragile as a piece of paper . They will turn against us at any second. If that woman is so familiar with the English team, she must be familiar with us, too. We have to be very careful,” Nanyu reminded Ai Jiangtu quietly.

“I understand,” Ai Jiangtu nodded.

From what Ai Jiangtu had observed, his best bet to take Zorro on was the Space Element. Seeing that Zorro was immersed in the pleasure of bringing chaos upon the place with his insects, Ai Jiangtu cast Blink and instantly appeared behind Zorro.

Zorro’s cultivation was outstanding, which meant he also keensenses. He instantly noticed Ai Jiangtu’s action. A small vortex appeared behind him. If Ai Jiangtu tried to attack him, it would immediately trigger the Chaos Gate to reflect the attack back at him.

However, Ai Jiangtu had no intention of attacking Zorro. He knew it was unnecessary to try attacking Zorro if even Mo Fan’s spells were unable to inflict any damage on him. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A silver Star Constellation appeared around Ai Jiangtu. The space it contained shuddered as the Star Constellation was completed, tearing a silver gap in the air.

Zorro was startled, and immediately looked anxious again.

“It’s the same trick again!” Zorro was getting utterly annoyed by the Space Element.

When Asha’ruiya sent him away twice in a row, his team was almost wiped out as a result. If he was unable to help his team, he was as good as a disqualified member!

Space trembled. Zorro was not able to leave the area in time, and was dragged right into the turbulent flow of space forcibly.

“Blink!” Ai Jiangtu teleported both himself and Zorro away. He even expended a significant amount of energy just to bring Zorro further away.

They disappeared from the area within the blink of an eye. The others had no clue where they had gone.

Unfortunately, the three substitute members of the English team had arrived! After the battles the members of the alliance had gone through, it would be quite difficult for them to eliminate the elites of the English team!

“Is there any meaning to this? Sacrificing yourself just to buy time for the others?” Zorro said arrogantly as he was being transferred to another place on the battlefield.

“Sacrifice myself? You’re thinking too highly of yourself,” Ai Jiangtu replied.

“Why, do you think you stand a chance against me? If I’m serious about taking you out, you won’t even last more than ten rounds,” Zorro said.

Zorro did not want to waste his time with Ai Jiangtu. It was tricky taking out a Space Mage, since the man could easily blink away if he realized that he was about to lose.

Buzz...

Their surroundings continued to shift rapidly. Ai Jiangtu did not talk any further, using his will to construct a battleground. Silver rays extended rapidly into the distance before falling perpendicularly to the ground.

Three other lines extended in the air and formed a silver cube to encapsulate Ai Jiangtu and Zorro within it.

Zorro was even angrier upon seeing this.

These people just kept finding ways to mess with him! If it weren’t for their dirty tricks, he could easily dominate the battlefield!

“I guess I’ll have to take you out first!” Zorro yelled. He Summoned a strong wind to target Ai Jiangtu.

“Bring it on!” Ai Jiangtu stood inside his Domain fearlessly.

Zorro had his Wind Thrall Domain, but Ai Jiangtu also had his Space Domain! As long as he was inside the cube, it would significantly raise the power of his Space Element.

Wind cones appeared in all directions. These enormous white cones of wind had a terrifying penetrative ability. The cones spun at shocking speed and could easily penetrate many defensive spells.

Ai Jiangtu’s movement suddenly became unpredictable. He blinked to a corner in the silver cube, dodging the wind cones flying at him from different directions. However, Zorro had the higher cultivation and could predict where Ai Jiangtu was going to show up. He dashed forward and waved his hands to summon two intertwining, chaotic marks like two black axes tearing the space apart. They did not produce any sound, but it felt like everything in their paths would disappear into nothing!

“Back off!” Ai Jiangtu sharpened his gaze as a silver light burst out of his body.

Zorro immediately felt a strong resistance, preventing him from advancing any further.

The Chaos Axes swept at Ai Jiangtu from both sides. Ai Jiangtu knew it would be difficult to stop the attacks of the Chaos Element with only his will. He decisively activated his magic Boots and dodged the Chaos Axes!
