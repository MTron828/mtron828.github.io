Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Mo Fan stared at Apas, and she returned his gaze. They made sure nothing was amiss.

“What exactly was that thing? What was that evil demonic shadow that you encountered?” asked Mo Fan. He felt fear.

“The Godly Horde Prophets manipulate the Ocean Demon troop of the Pacific Ocean. At the same time, the Godly Horde Prophets are under another ocean creature’s manipulation. I believe the Ocean Demons are controlled by a well-defined mental network. The evil demonic shadow is the brains of the Ocean Godly Horde,” said Apas.

Hearing Apas’ words sent a chill down his spine. It was no wonder most countries on the coasts had been attacked by the Ocean Demons. With such a supreme Ocean Godly Horde as the brains of the Ocean Demons to control the entire Pacific Ocean, the Ocean Demons could eat up the remaining thirty percent of the dry lands and trap the world under the bottomless ocean.

“The brains of the Ocean Godly Horde and the Godly Horde Prophets communicate through psychic connection much like humans and their Contracted Beasts. The Godly Horde Prophets control the Ocean Demon troop with their powerful demonic spells. As a result, the Ocean Demon’s kingdom at the Pacific Ocean becomes organized. They have a clear goal.”

It was only then that Mo Fan truly understood how terrifying the Ocean Demon’s civilization really was.

They did not rule the Ocean Demons. Even if the cleverest ruler were given to rule the vast ocean creatures, there would still be a split among themselves, including internal wars and different goals. However, controlling their minds eradicated all these problems.

Even humans failed to achieve such cohesiveness. They were forced to unite during crisis and oppression. However, their unity wasn’t as strong as the Ocean Demons’ unanimity.

Mo Dan understood why Commander Hua was worried.

The moment the evil demonic shadow captured sufficient information; the Ocean Demons would attack on a large scale.

There was a rumble. The earth shook violently. The mountains and rivers were growing and expanding.

The sea level retreated, revealing a large area of land. The beach stretched for dozens of kilometers. The ocean that was originally visible seemed to have been sucked by a powerful force and drawn further away from the island. The mountains towered. The earthquake grew stronger in intensity. It shook so violently that the buildings began to crack and fall.

The Green East Sea God sensed something. It hovered above Mo Fan and Apas, and continued to crow.

......

Meanwhile, the Moon Moth Phoenix took Jiang Yu and Night Rakshasa to reunite with Pang Lai. Mo Fan stayed where he was, stalling for time, so that Jiang Yu and Night Rakshasa had enough time to reach safety.

He had obtained the Healing Scroll and Space Bracelet. He had to find Commander Hua!

Mo Fan had no idea what caused the violent earthquake. But he sensed that a great disaster was about to unfold.

“Let’s go!” Mo Fan and Apas hopped onto the Green East Sea God’s back.

The Black Totem Snake swung its tail. Its scales transformed into many small green snakes. The glowing green snakes swarmed the Ocean Demons that charged toward them in a frenzy and bit them to death. The Ocean Demons’ carcasses piled up.

“Big guy, hurry up!” Mo Fan took out the Totem Orb and called back the Black Totem Snake.

The Black Totem Snake had been wounded in battle. Fortunately, it could heal rapidly. If it recuperated inside the Totem Orb, it could restore its power soon.

The Black Totem Snake fought to prevent the Ocean Demons from getting close to it. It was a Supreme Ruler, and it demonstrated its terrifying and majestic aura in the middle of the Ocean Demon army.

Mo Fan sensed that the Black Totem Snake had grown stronger compared to when he first saw it at Hang Zhou. It no longer glowed in a demonic aura. Instead, it radiated a divine and holy green glow.

“How’s the situation now?” Mo Fan asked Song Feiyao.

“The island is rising again. It seems that there’s a powerful force suppressing the entire island. Look!” Song Feiyao pointed.

The Green East Sea was the fastest flying creature in the sky. If it fought the Feather Crown at the Feathered Demon Heaven, the Silver Sky ruler would not even exist. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Stingray and Sword Fish Legions attempted to break themselves free from the terrifying earthquake, only to disintegrate into beads of blood in mid-air, like blood roses blooming everywhere.

Mo Fan looked down.

The mountains rose slowly. The frightening cracks were clearly visible. They stretched across the mountains, forests, beaches, and cities of Hawaii. They reached up to thousands of meters high in the air. Mo Fan could not see where they ended.

The Green East Sea God let out a panicked cry. It had been flying high steadily and rapidly. But now it began to shake as if it could fall.

Mo Fan felt an inexplicable pressure. He felt as if the sky had darkened suddenly. A dark, demonic figure stood on the edge of the gloomy sky. Its claws stretched out like a black cloud that could cover a large mountain!

Mo Fan’s heart almost stopped beating when he encountered such a terrifying threat. This was not Mo Fan’s first time witnessing such enormous demonic claws. When he was at Pudong coast, the same frightening claws had killed three Apex-grade Mages!

It was the mastermind—The Black Claw Emperor! It had finally showed up!

The entire island was in catastrophe because of its violent arrival. Even a solid steel fortress would collapse under such a tremendous earthquake, let alone humans…

It was pointless to fight such a terrifying force. The Black Claw Emperor was as strong as the Black Dragon Emperor. It could kill them in the blink of an eye.

“Mo Fan, get behind me!” said a firm voice.

Mo Fan felt a vibration in the space before him. A man in a military coat appeared next to him. He had black hair and black beard. He had pure black eyes. He looked calm and resolute even in the face of the Black Claw Emperor.
