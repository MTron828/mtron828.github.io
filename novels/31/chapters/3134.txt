Chapter 3134 - 3134: An Old Enemy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A grand ancient wall made up of sixty-four divine skeletons stood beneath the imposing statue. Each Einherjar Spirit seemed to have an ancient mystical energy swirling around them, like a special blessing. Thanks to this mystical energy, it looked as if every Einherjar Spirit had resurrected. They even gained powers they never had before.

A dragonkin covered in scales from head to toe stood beside Asha’ruiya. It stared at her as if it wanted to eat her.

However, there was a boundary separating Asha’ruiya and the dragonkin. Before the Azure Dragon at the center woke up, no Einherjar Spirit could cross the boundary between the two sections.

Asha’ruiya started paying attention to herself.

She knew that she had to be involved in this epic battle between the Einherjar Spirits, and she could not avoid it.

Her priority at the moment was to figure out how to stay alive in the battle!

She did not want to end up as leftovers used to feed MO Fan’s magic tool!

Asha’ruiya had three pairs of wings. However, she noticed that after she received the Dragon Sparrow’s blessing, she grew an even more radiant pair of wings.

This extra pair of wings was bigger. They made Asha’ruiya’s original wings, which indicated her status as the Six-Winged Fallen Angel, look average in comparison.

The Dragon Sparrow Wings were colorful. They were reminiscent of peacock feathers and dragon scales. A large amount of mystical energy surrounded her and made her feel incredibly light. Additionally, her blessed eyes became sharper. When she glanced around, she noticed that the movements of others seemed slower and sluggish.

“Roar!”

Just then, a loud dragon roar echoed like the beat of war drums.

Asha’ruiya glanced over and noticed that the Azure Dragon at the center had awoken.

It opened its eyes and slowly flew into the air.

Its body was bigger than anyone could have imagined. When it stretched out in the air, it seemed to create a giant dragon-shaped canopy over the entire Four Spirits Killing Field, which had sixty-four divine skeletons!

The Azure Dragon looked down and stared at the enslaved Einherjar Spirits with fiery eyes.

It was the rule and law.

All living beings trapped in this place would be under its control.

However, when the Azure Dragon saw a familiar man standing in the Four Spirits Killing Field, it looked puzzled.

What was going on?

Did its divine servant come here for an inspection?

Inspecting was one thing, but how did he end up on the battle ground?

He was not a kid. Why was he still so careless?!

“Ahem… How do I explain this? I want to try it out too. Can I join the competition and maybe have an extra spot on the White Team? That shouldn’t be a problem,” MO Fan said to the Azure Dragon with an embarrassed look.

The Azure Dragon nodded slightly. As long as MO Fan was happy and understanding, it did not mind him coming here.

“Hey, you’re the ruler here, right? Since you’re the ruler, you should make fair rules. Why do we have thirty-two members on our side while they have thirty-three?” a Demonic Monk in ancient black robes said. He was standing beneath a Sacred Python.

The Demonic Monk was unhappy with the rules of the battle.

If there were two teams, both teams should have equal members.

However, the Black Team had thirty-two Einherjar Spirits, while the White Team had thirty-three.

The White Team had an extra one, who happened to be MO Fan.

MO Fan had to do this. He could not just watch Asha’ruiya suffer.

She was his guide on the Dark Plane, and the journey ahead was still long. If he upset her, it might be difficult for him to return to the mortal world.

“Hmph! You’re the ruler of this territory, yet you don’t know the basic rule of keeping two teams balanced.” The Demonic Monk in black robes seemed to be a renowned mage from ancient induk. He was once a prominent figure. He appeared knowledgeable in Eastern magic arts and could not resist complaining.

The Azure Dragon’s eyes gleamed.

Suddenly, it opened its mouth, and a magnificent dragon wave surged!

It went through the body of the Demonic Monk, who was in the Einherjar Spirit state, and left a gaping hole in his chest!

The Demonic Monk widened his eyes in shock and fear. Although it tried to defend himself with his black robe, it was as ineffective as a wisp of smoke.

The dragon wave pierced his soul and even shattered a part of the divine skeleton of a Monkey Monk, who was standing behind him!

The Demonic Monk stood there in disbelief over what had happened. His body dispersed like ashes and eventually turned into strands of light that fell into the vast Nether Ocean.

The other sixty-three Einherjar Spirits fell silent, including Lilith, who had volunteered to join.

In this world, the Azure Dragon was the law!

At first, there were thirty-two Einherjar Spirits against thirty-three.

However, after the Demon Monk complained, the Black Team lost one member, so it became thirty-one against thirty-three.

The other thirty-one Einherjar Spirits were also wise. It was better to have fewer people than to risk being killed before the battle began.

“Great, we’re back to sixty-four Einherjar Spirits,” Lilith said with a smile.

“How silly to hope for fairness in someone else’s territory,” said the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, who appeared just like any other person.

“No worries. I enjoy a challenge.” The dragonkin showed its teeth.

“Are we fighting one-on-one, or is it a group fight?”

“Let’s wait and see what the ruler decides.”

“But the ruler’s divine servant is on the other team, so doesn’t it depend on what they want?” the Giant Armored Demon King asked.

“Don’t worry. Once he enters the Four Spirits Killing Fields, he has to follow the rules of battle.’

“If we kill the divine servant, can we be free?”

“Of course not. The ruler will find a new one eventually.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“So, what’s the point of us fighting?”

“The point is whether we end up being worshiped here or becoming scattered souls!”

MO Fan did not receive the divine skeleton’s mystical energy.

After all, he was the owner here.

He was just like the organizer of a fighting arena.

However, he had locked himself inside the cage. The wild beasts in the cage did not care about who he was. They would tear him apart and eat him!

MO Fan and Asha’ruiya were on the White Team, also the white section.

The other section was black and shrouded in deep, dense fog. When the chosen Einherjar Spirits stepped into the black section, they vanished from sight. Others could not see what they were doing or find where they were.

“Someone’s coming!” a man in white robes suddenly exclaimed.

He was dressed in ancient court attire, which made him look like a royal advisor.

“What?” A middle-aged Wind-curse Element Mage with unkempt hair was opposite him. It was unclear which country he came from.

The royal advisor in white robes took a few steps back.

At the same time, he edged closer to the side and got a bit nearer to MO Fan and Asha’ruiya.

The thirty-three Einherjar Spirits on the White Team were unsure who MO Fan was. They only knew that he could make the Azure Dragon change the rules.

Getting closer to someone like that could not be a bad idea.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a massive sword with jagged edges emerged from the darkness on the Black Team’s side. It was as large as a mountain peak and engulfed in golden flames. These flames formed several Golden Divine Markings as the sword flew, and that made its impact on the ground even more imposing. The scorching heat spread all around!

The flames burned some of the weaker Einherjar Spirits, and they quickly flew away.

The wandering Wind-curse Element Mage from earlier took a direct hit from the sword. So, his body split in half, and the flames soon consumed him.

In an instant, the Wind-curse Element Mage vanished.

However, he was not the only one who had taken a hit. The force also struck a dark demon holding a scepter. The Golden Divine Markings had a strong killing effect on it and caused it to vanish as well!

Finally, a bare-chested man with the physique of an ordinary person stepped forward at the boundary between the two sections.

It was the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, the oldest Godlike Human!

Although he was not as physically imposing as the mountain-sized Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, the Golden Flame-Toothed Sword in its hand surpassed even the real Golden Sun Tyrant Titan!

“Well, isn’t that balanced again?” The Godlike Human Titan smiled.

With a single swing of his sword, the number of Einherjar Spirits on both sides became equal again.

However, his arrogance left all the Einherjar Spirits in shock!

In the Four Spirits Killing Fields, the Einherjar Spirits’ powers were based on their abilities when they were alive. The Godlike Human Titan would likely cause a catastrophe if brought back to the present world!

In the white section of the Four Spirits Killing Fields, a noticeable crack appeared beneath the Einherjar Spirits’ feet.

MO Fan followed the strange force emanating from the crack and looked toward the ancient wall. He noticed that the glow of two divine skeletons had vanished.

“If the glow of our side’s divine skeletons is fading, everyone’s mystical energy will weaken,” MO Fan explained.

“That mixed-breed Golden Sun Tyrant Titan can’t be this powerful. I’ve heard of it,” said a female ancient mage.

“It must be the blessing from the divine skeleton behind it. Everyone, don’t underestimate the blessings from your own divine skeletons!” The royal advisor in white robes quickly observed and concluded.

“If reducing the blessings from the divine skeletons depends on taking out one of our targets, then let’s start by targeting the weaker ones!” someone suggested.

“That’s right. The stronger ones become stronger after receiving the blessings, and the weaker ones also become stronger. Since we’re split into two teams, we must come together because our destinies are linked.”

They were all former champions from different eras and could see the situation clearly. They also understood how to gain greater benefits within the limited rules.

“But the problem is, we can’t even see the situation on the other side.”

“So, we need someone to charge in like the Godlike Human Golden Sun Tyrant Titan and take out their weaker ones first. It’s like chess. If you only let pawns cross the border, it’s hard to win,” explained the white-robed royal advisor.

“Hey, you seem strong and reliable. How about you take the lead and charge ahead?” Someone quickly turned to MO Fan.

“I don’t have any blessings, which puts me at a disadvantage. Plus, someone on

the other side knows my identity. If I charge in, they’ll all attack me, and you’ll

lose one of your reliable allies,” Mo Fan immediately refused.

Asking Mo Fan to charge in was like asking him to seek death. Lilith knew he was the ruler of this world.

These Einherjar Spirits had been trapped for thousands of years. They were slaves forced to perform battles in an arena like gladiators. If the ruler accidentally fell into the arena, they would surely want to tear apart every inch of his flesh.

“A bunch of cowards! I’ll go!”

At that moment, a brave warrior stepped forward. It was the Giant Armored Demon King. Its entire body was clad in armor forged from an otherworldly metal. Whatever within the armor was concealed.

The Giant Armored Demon King became the forefront of the White Team. It soon plunged into the darkness.

Whether it was dismantled outright or successfully defeated the weaker opponents of the Black Team remained unknown.

“You lowly Wicked God. I can smell your foul odor already. Do you think you can refine my soul? Dream on!” Suddenly, a raspy and resentful voice came from the black section.

A headless figure then slowly approached from the black section.

He had eight bloody wings protruding from his back and had twisted scars burned by flames on his body. These terrifying wounds looked fresh, with blood and pus still flowing from them.

Asha’ruiya frowned as she looked at this headless angel with broken wings. She could not determine if he was a Parade Angel or Fallen Angel.

“MO Fan!

“You lowlife!

“Our grudge isn’t settled yet!”

The anger of the headless angel with broken wings was intense. The surrounding powerful Einherjar Spirits instinctively backed away.

One had to pay for one’s sins. The angel was seeking revenge.

“Who are you?” MO Fan stared at the vengeful Archangel but could not remember who he was.

He did not even have a head.

How was MO Fan supposed to recognize him?

MO Fan’s rude question only made the Archangel angrier.

Even without a head, he could still lock onto MO Fan.

MO Fan did not expect the Archangel to be this bold despite being in his territory. Regardless of who he was, since it came looking for trouble, MO Fan decided to deal with him first!

“MO Fan, I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!” the headless angel with broken wings kept screaming.

He held deep hatred toward MO Fan.

Why did Mo Fan have no memory of him?

“Could he be the War Angel?”

“Archangel Albaferra from Holy City?”

“But aren’t Archangels supposed to have fourteen or sixteen wings? He only has eight.”

“Look at his back. There are many broken wings. His wings were clearly torn off while he was still alive!”

Soon, several Einherjar Spirits recognized the identity of this vengeful angel.

After this reminder, MO Fan finally figured out who he was.

It was the War Angel, Albaferra, the one who was supposed to hunt him down on the day he became the Wicked God!

How did his soul end up in the Bright Blood King’s place? When he was in the garden, he did not notice that Little Loach had swallowed its soul.

This was interesting.

He was meeting an old enemy.

Yes. MO Fan had broken his wings and cut off his head!

On the day MO Fan became the Wicked God, the War Archangel paid a visit and claimed that he wanted to rid the world of all unruly demons.

MO Fan must admit that the Archangel was strong. He tried to kill MO Fan on the day MO Fan became the Wicked God. If Lingling did not remove that ice spike that had pierced MO Fan’s heart, MO Fan would have died long ago.

Albaferra was one of the top five strongest enemies MO Fan had ever fought with.

The War Angel, Albaferra, was the biggest threat on the day he became the Wicked God.

He was also the first enemy MO Fan encountered after being a Forbidden Mage.

At this moment, he had become a headless angel with broken wings.

The grudge from the mortal world was likely even stronger on the Dark Plane.

It was a perfect opportunity to see how much MO Fan had improved since then!

“Look at your wings. They’re all uneven now. Let me help you with that and make them look better,” MO Fan mocked his old enemy.

“You’re unforgivable!” The headless angel with broken wings transformed into a furious spirit of vengeance.

His wings produced a bloody wave that surged toward MO Fan!
