Chapter 1932: The Disappearance

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The storm above Xiamen started to dissipate after Qiu Chi and Qiu Zi were gone. As it left, the rain finally stopped falling.

Sea monsters were still roaming in the city, but the majority of the city was already evacuated. The Mages began to exterminate the sea monsters that were damaging the city.

The sea monsters were like a sheet of loose sand without the two Great Rulers. As the water in the city started to fall, their strength dropped significantly with it.

———————-

Two days later, the sunlight finally pierced through the thick clouds and shone upon the drenched city around dusk. The shadows of the buildings that were still standing dragged across the water, swaying as the tide gradually fell.

The weather was most likely going to be clear tomorrow if there was sunlight now. The city would soon regain its warmth and charm. By then, the sea monsters would all have retreated to their dens. For those who stayed, there was only one ending: death!

Mo Fan did not join the others in exterminating the remaining sea monsters. He was completely worn out. It was already afternoon before he even woke up. He could hear giggles on the field outside the window. He knew they were ladies in the prime of youth as soon as he heard the giggles.

Mo Fan rose to his feet and pulled the curtain to the side. He realized he was still at Jimei University. Even though the school was close to the sea, it did not suffer much damage from the sea monsters and the storm due to its higher terrain. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The storm that had loomed over Xiamen not long ago felt like a nightmare when he heard the giggles of the young and attractive girls. Everything was just as peaceful and fine after he woke up from his sleep.

Mo Fan stood in front of the window and watched the ladies in short skirts for some time. He was starting to miss the day when he first set foot into Pearl Institute. The days back when he was still a student had indeed been more relaxing. He did not have to go rushing about to so many different places that were on fire to put out the flames. He might not be able to wake up again someday, which meant he would not be able to see those pretty skirts and beautiful legs swaying outside his window.

The door opened. The little beauty Lingling came in with a cup of milk tea. She twisted her lips when she saw Mo Fan awake, standing at the window to peep on the girls in their dorm’s garden.

“The water level has fallen by half. Most of the buildings were destroyed, but it shouldn’t be much of a problem to repair them. The main roads and city core are still intact,” Lingling informed him.

“That’s great, at least our efforts were not in vain!” Mo Fan answered.

“Is your Shadow Element at the Super Level now?” Lingling asked him.

“Yeah, I didn’t expect it either.” Mo Fan finally remembered what had happened.

Yeah, his Shadow Element had reached the Super Level. He was struggling to recall everything that happened, since he had just woken up. He was completely worn out after fighting for so long.

“You can do a lot more things now,” Lingling said.

“Of course, and my Shadow Element has evolved again. I feel like it’s on par with my Lightning Element,” Mo Fan said.

“You’ve claimed the Dark Moon Crystal from Jimei University, which is said to be of the finest quality. It’s not surprising that your Shadow Element has evolved again,” Lingling told him.

“I’ll need some time to stabilize my cultivation when we are back. That way, it will be easier for us to achieve our goals,” Mo Fan smiled.

“The duel between you and the guy from the Zu Clan is just around the corner too,” Lingling reminded him.

“Mm, I bet he didn’t expect my Lightning Element to break through to the Super Level in such a short time. My Shadow Element is now at the Super Level too.” Mo Fan was now looking forward to the duel!

Zu Xiangtian had purposely hired people to impersonate him and ruin his reputation to gather more attention before the duel. Mo Fan had been given no choice but to keep a low profile since then. Zu Xiangtian had done everything to secure the limelight for himself. He had even sent out invitations for people to watch the duel a long time ago, so he could claim the title as the strongest young Mage in front of the whole country.

It was true that Mo Fan was no match against Zu Xiangtian when they were still in Greece, as he had only been an Advanced Mage. However, that was no longer the case now. Zu Xiangtian did not have much time left to be full of himself, as Mo Fan would soon beat the crap out of him when the time came!

“By the way, where’s Old Zhao?” Mo Fan remembered Zhao Manyan and his Totem Beast, Baxia.

It was a relief that Old Zhao had managed to bring the old turtle to their aid in time. If the Jimei Bridge had collapsed, Xinglin Bridge would have been the only escape route left. They would have had no chance of evacuating the city within eight hours.

Baxia had played a very important role during the battle!

He now understood why Shao Zheng insisted that they find the Totem Beasts. Most Mages did not stand a chance against the powerful and ancient sea monsters. Only the Totem Beasts were strong enough to face them!

“He left quietly,” Lingling said.

“Really? That’s not like him. He would normally stay here for some time after contributing so much, so he could enjoy the fame and admiration from the people. The ladies would fall into his arms. He wouldn’t leave until he had enough!” Mo Fan was amazed.

“People might link Baxia’s appearance to the incident in Venice. Zhao Manyan might want to enjoy the benefits like you mentioned, but he still needs to keep an eye on his brother, and the Zhao Family who’s currently under his brother’s control. Let’s just say he has grown a lot. It was best if he left quietly,” Lingling said.

“That’s true. Zhao Youqian is vicious. If he knows Old Zhao is still alive, who knows what crazy acts he would try to pull off,” Mo Fan agreed.

The Zhao Family was able to match the Mu Clan in terms of influence. Money could do a lot of things. They would never be short of tricks if they wanted someone dead. Zhao Manyan wanted to improve his strength in peace, so he should avoid the public eye as much as possible.

“There’s something I need to tell you.” Lingling sat down on the edge of the bed. She tossed back the cup of milk tea and straightened her face.

“What’s wrong?” Mo Fan could not figure out any reason why Lingling would be so serious all of a sudden, as if something was bothering her.

“I’ve asked many people, and even asked the people of the Donghai Magic Association for help. I also asked Sister Ningxue to investigate the Dali Clan, but we haven’t learned anything useful...” Lingling said.

“What do you mean?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

“Mu Bai,” Lingling paused briefly, as if she was having a hard time believing it. “Mu Bai is missing.”
