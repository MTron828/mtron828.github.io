“If I’m not one of the descendants, so be it. Jumping into the Dark Abyss now is no different than jumping into it when it shifts here into the inner city. Besides, I was standing right beside the Dark Abyss at Xianchi, but the space vortex didn’t suck me into the Dark Abyss. Perhaps that’s a sign that I’m still a pure descendant of the tribe that moved to Bo City,” said Zhang Xiaohou with a forced smile.

“If you’re going, I’ll go with you too,” said Su Xiaoluo with determination.

“Houzi, are you sure about this?” Mo Fan looked at Zhang Xiaohou grimly.

“Brother Fan...” Zhang Xiaohou looked at Mo Fan. He suddenly choked with emotion as he continued to speak, “So many people here are going to die. I just can’t bear to watch it anymore. It’s great to stay alive...when everyone’s alive too. I don’t actually know if the tradition that my family follows has anything to do with the villages, nor do I know if I still have the lineage after so many years...but if I only have one-thousandth, or one ten-thousandth, even if I don’t even have a trace of it... I don’t want to wait until the Dark Abyss devours the city. It’s going to eat the people and all my friends. If the city is destroyed, and everyone is dead, but I somehow survive, I strongly believe that I’ll just kill myself, because I could have... saved everyone’s life!”

When the place was covered in bones and ruins, especially when everyone he was close with had died right beside him while he alone had survived the calamity, he believed that he would not feel relieved at possessing the bloodline of Bo City, but he would forever live in self-condemnation and the shadows of his sin.

Zhang Xiaohou’s voice was shaking as he spoke. He had already witnessed how terrifying the Dark Abyss was. He strongly believed that the most painful way to die was jumping into it.

He was scared. He had never faced fear like this before, yet the words he had spoken were of utmost sincerity.

He had not made the decision because he wanted to show how great a person he was. He just did not want to be the left person alive, even if the chance was only one-thousandth or one ten-thousandth. It was better to die than to live like an empty shell.

Zhang Xiaohou’s words echoed under the clock, in the hearts of the people. Even the Super Magicians with cold faces were touched.

Mo Fan was initially going to convince Zhang Xiaohou to change his mind, yet he was the one being convinced instead.

“Fang Gu, I’ve drunk the Underground Holy Spring. Do you think I’ll be fine jumping into the Dark Abyss?” Mo Fan asked, looking at Fang Gu.

“I wouldn’t know, but according to the information passed down to us, the Underground Holy Spring of your Bo City should be a lot more effective than our Water of Kun... wait, did you drink it all by yourself? I think the undead in the Dark Abyss won’t do any harm to you. The old ancestor is going to chop you into pieces himself!” replied Fang Gu.

“Mo Fan, you’re going too?” Zhou Ming looked at him in great surprise.

“We’re going to die either way, I would rather die trying. Well, we have candidates to jump into the Dark Abyss now, but the question is, how are we going to reach the Dark Abyss? Don’t forget that the Dark Abyss is still a few kilometers away from the An Yuan Gate. The undead across that distance is enough to stack into human pyramids,” said Mo Fan.

The question immediately puzzled the crowd.

The question was on point, the Dark Abyss was located outside of the walls, the whole place was crawling with undead. It was already impossible to reach it!

Zhu Meng snorted into his beard and said righteously, “Humph, do you think we’re just going to stand here and watch?!”

“We’ll clear a path for you!” Du Xiao declared, stepping forward.

“I already have a bet with Li Yujian. Whoever kills less undead is going to be the other person’s servant in Hell. We can start whenever, let’s do it!” Elder Shi Zheng was a straightforward person, too.

“We’re going to survive, but the bet still counts!” Li Yujian responded.

The spirit in Han Ji’s eyes slowly recovered when he saw the authorities willing to contribute.

The information had awakened their spirits after a long silence!

He was only curious what Salan would be feeling right now.

“To prevent Salan from disrupting our plan, I’ll personally escort them until we reach the Dark Abyss!” said Han Ji.

“President, you’re going too?” said the mysterious man in astonishment.

“Salan is here among us. I believe with how vicious he is, he will surely try to murder them in the midst of chaos. I’ll look after them, and I bet Salan won’t have the courage to face me!” said Han Ji in cold voice. He looked like a different person than before.

“Alright, since even the president is willing to fight together with us, what else could we say? Every person that was kept in custody just now will be going out. We’ll leave a few men behind to guard the city, just in case the Ruler undead suddenly decide to attack!” Commander Yao Ting ordered.

“Zhang Xiaohou, well done, we’re proud of you!” Chief Military Instructor Fei Jiao patted Zhang Xiaohou’s shoulder solemnly.

“The Dark Abyss will be shifting very soon. We’ll have to organize the people responsible for clearing the path. We must escort them to the Dark Abyss!”

“People, you are our only hope. If you succeed, you’ll be heroes. If you fail, it won’t matter much, either. We’ll just gather and enjoy ourselves a grand meal in Hell.”

“This is more like it; the more depressed we are, the happier the Black Vatican will be. We won’t let them have their way even if we’re going to die. F**k the Black Vatican, try fighting me on the bell tower now, I’ll torture them until they beg for mercy!”

“President, how about that Hu Jin? He’s still kneeling there?” said the mysterious man.

“That guy must be ready to die for Salan if he dared to show himself. Tie him to the clock, let the whole city see his face...” said the president.

Mu He had indeed prepared to die for Salan. He simply knelt on the ground, like he was worshiping a god. He was completely insane!

It was meaningless to even kill someone like him. It was better to tie him up first. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Once they managed to resolve the situation, they would be sure to make him pay!

The Magicians proceeded to seal Mu He’s mind and hang him on the clock with chains.

However, Mu He was ready to sacrifice. He continued grinning madly and mumbling words about the festival, apotheosizing, Salan, God of Death, and so forth, like a maniac.

The people simply ignored him. Everyone shared the same goal now, and they would try their best to achieve it!

“Yao Ting, are these people all you can arrange?” asked Han Ji.

“These are the only ones available. We still need people to guard the city. Otherwise, if the safety barrier crumbles when we’re out of the city, the undead will simply invade the inner city. The outcome is still going to be the same...”

“He’s right, we need enough men to defend the city, just so the Black Vatican won’t be able to do much in the midst of chaos,” said Lu Xu.

“It’s nowhere enough, we won’t be able to reach the Dark Abyss with this number,” said the mysterious man.

“I’ve got a plan, but it might involve lots of sacrifices... well, voluntary ones,” said Shi Zheng.

Everyone’s expression changed when they heard Shi Zheng’s suggestion. Some even shook their heads.

However, Shi Zheng still insisted that it was the only way, “I’ve made it clear. It’s voluntary. We should gather the volunteers, and regardless of how many they are, we’ll have to proceed with the plan. Time is running short.”

“Then... we will tell them the truth.”

“The commoners are weak. I doubt they would even volunteer; they are not Magicians, after all.”
