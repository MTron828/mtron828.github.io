Zhao Pinlin walked up to the group of three. His eyes scanned Mu Ningxue with dark desire.

If the woman did not reject him, perhaps Zhao Pinlin would still be admiring her beauty with a pure heart. However, since his wild ambitions were being answered lately, he found his lust for Mu Ningxue’s silver hair and her sacred face growing stronger.

He initially thought he would have to contribute more to the Black Vatican before he could fulfill his dream. After all, the woman he lusted after was a Magician. To his surprise, she walked into the trap herself. When Zhao Pinlin’s eyes stared at Mu Ningxue, it felt like he had already dominated and ravaged her countless times!

Mu Ningxue finally understood why she was being cautious around Zhao Pinlin. Every time the man looked at her, he was like a starving beast. He did not even bother hiding his intentions.

“Zhao Pinlin, you animal, tell us where Wang Xuxu is at once!” Rong Sheng was enraged when he saw Zhao Pinlin. He immediately went up and grabbed his neck.

Zhao Pinlin stood still, as if he was looking at a petty being.

The Cursed Beast beside him attacked, swiping its claw at Rong Sheng.

The sharp claws penetrated Rong Sheng’s sturdy figure like they were slicing tofu. Luckily, Mu Ningxue managed to pull Rong Sheng back in time. Otherwise, the claws would have tugged his organs out instead of just cutting him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Keep your cool!” ordered Mu Ningxue.

Rong Sheng held his chest and glared at Zhao Pinlin.

Zhao Pinlin smirked coldly. The Cursed Beast could take on Magicians with ease, let alone an ordinary person like Rong Sheng.

“You’re still thinking of her! I can guarantee that if you see her now, you’ll try your best to avoid her, hahaha!... If you are smart enough, you will quietly follow me to the dungeon. I can consider sparing your lives. However, if you don’t listen to me, humph, I’ll ask it to tear you into pieces right here!” said Zhao Pinlin.

“You... why did you become like this!” Guo Wenyi looked at the man as if she was looking at a stranger.

“I’ve been like this all along!”

Mu Ningxue did not make her move. She could sense the presence of many members of the Black Vatican other than Zhao Pinlin. She had no problem dealing with Zhao Pinlin, yet it would be troublesome if they were surrounded by the Black Vatican.

It was obvious that Zhao Pinlin was not planning to kill them. She could use it as a chance to move around their territory.

Zhao Pinlin did not bother tying or placing any restrictions on the group of three. In his eyes, the Cursed Beast watching them was the best restriction.

They were brought to a level below the ground floor. This was likely the true nest of the Black Vatican. They could see a disciple in a black outfit every few steps, and Dark Beast Monsters like hounds with chains around their necks.

“Who are these three?” asked the Gray Priest Lu Geng, glancing at them coldly.

“My new slaves,” answered Zhao Pinlin.

“Why didn’t you place any restrictions on them?” asked Lu Geng.

“They are just a bunch of ordinary people. I don’t think there’s a need for that,” responded Zhao Pinlin.

“Lock them up in the dungeon, and come immediately to the Slanted Hall.”

“Got it.”

Mu Ningxue was listening to every word they said. She began to wonder what the Slanted Hall was.

Could it be the place where the poison is coming from? Either way, it must be a very important place for the Black Vatican!

As they arrived in the dungeon, Mu Ningxue discovered that although there were mechanisms to restrict them in the cells, they were not too strong. She could easily break free with her full strength.

Zhao Pinlin had obviously assumed they were a bunch of ordinary people. He did not bother locking them up in stronger cells. Mu Ningxue let out a relieved sigh.

Unfortunately, she was not an expert at sneaking around. If she wandered through the Black Vatican’s nest on her own, she would quickly find herself in trouble.

The dark hall in the orange building...

When Mo Fan returned, he discovered that the place was completely empty. Judging from the marks on the floor, it seemed like a bunch of Dark Beast Monsters were crawling around the place.

Mo Fan started to worry, but he eventually calmed down when he saw a white block of ice in a corner.

It was the signal that Mu Ningxue and he had decided on. If the situation was indeed dangerous, nothing would be left behind since she had to react as quickly as possible. However, if she was able to leave the ice crystal behind, it implied that she was rather safe.

“Mo Fan, Mo Fan....” Lingling’s voice came from the communication device.

“What is it?” asked Mo Fan.

“The poison has struck again. More than ten people are dead. The number is still increasing. Some people are already running around wildly in panic,” said Lingling.

Mo Fan stood at the window and saw the main building that was well lit up. He could vaguely hear cries and screams, and tiny figures running across the dark ranches. However, those people eventually disappeared as they were running...

Mo Fan knew that they must have fallen into some shrubs, with blood pouring out from their mouth and their bodies turning into a black substance...

The pitch-black night did not have many stars. The clouds were looming over the spacious ranches. Terrifying cries and screams were echoing endlessly. The people hiding indoors were trembling in fear. Their faces were extremely pale due to their fear and uneasiness...

The captain of the Golden Battle Hunters, Pan Jin, sat on the stairs close to the main entrance. His bloodshot eyes were looking at the black corpses just a few steps in front of him. He was clenching his fists tightly. He wanted to fight the Black Vatican, even if it meant risking his life.

However, they could not find a single member of the Black Vatican. Some of them might even be hiding among the guests, pretending to be terrified, yet they were actually laughing disdainfully in their hearts as they were enjoying the painful cries and screams of the victims!

It felt utterly torturous knowing his cultivation was utterly useless as he watched his comrades die with none of the smoke and blast produced by magic.

It seemed like the Golden Battle Hunters was going to be wiped out entirely... they were being wiped out before they could even catch a single member of the Black Vatican!

“Leader, I don’t want to wait and die like this...” Pan Jin raised his head and looked at Ge Ming in tears.

“I don’t want it to end like this either, we’ve really underestimated the Black Vatican. We can only hope that...” said Ge Ming helplessly.

“Hope what?” asked Pan Jin.

“Hope... hope...” Ge Ming’s eyes widened. He tried very hard to speak, yet he could not make any noise.

“Leader!” Pan Jin immediately rose to his feet.

Ge Ming could not believe it either. Something was stuck in his throat. It was so thick that he could not even cough it out.
