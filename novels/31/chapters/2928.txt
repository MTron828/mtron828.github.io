Chapter 2929: The Holy Shadow Apostle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There was a small bonfire without any firewood within the embers. It looked as if it had appeared by itself out of thin air. A tiny, flaming tongue occasionally appeared to lick the aromatic, sizzling roast meat.

When Mo Fan sprinkled some cumin, the aroma grew stronger. He sat on a pile of ruins and nibbled at the meat with satisfaction.

The manatee flesh tasted better than Wagyu beef. The outer layer of the manatee flesh was muscular, so it did not burn easily even under high temperature. The tender flesh inside was cooked very quickly.

Inside the city ruins, Mo Fan sat by the campfire and enjoyed his delicious food. Demons and monsters roared but he did not seem bothered.

Even if powerful Ocean Demons wanted to approach him, they dared not come closer when they saw the Ice Ax Manatee carcasses everywhere.

The city was dimly lit. The surroundings around the campfire were slightly brighter. However, the area where the brightness of the campfire reached was limited. The shadow of a pair of slender legs slowly walked toward Mo Fan.

The man wore a pair of exquisite brown leather shoes. The surface of the shoes was lustrous. Those who managed to keep their shoes clean were neither germaphobe nor suffered from OCD, at least not in this area. It meant that they were confident in their ability to overcome most crises.

Mo Fan saw the man walk out from the dimly lit city. He noticed the man’s clean leather shoes. Even so, Mo Fan was not affected. He took a bite of the tender flesh and chewed it.

“Are you Wei Guang?” The man approached Mo Fan.

“No. You’ve got the wrong person.” Mo Fan’s mouth was full, so he only responded briefly.

“You don’t have to cover up. I saw you kill those Ice Ax Manatees. You can disguise your appearance, but your strength is in line with the description I received from others. As far as I’m concerned, Wei Guang, you’re the only one whose strength has reached that level here in China.” The middle-aged man of mixed blood grinned.

Mo Fan was confused. He looked up at the stranger. ‘Why does everyone here think I am Wei Guang? Is Wei Guang very strong? Is Wei Guang really as handsome as me?’

“China is huge. There are many hidden talents and experts inside the country. I’m not Wei Guang. You’ve got the wrong person. You, on the other hand, I notice gold patterned lining under the lapel, the kind only those in the Holy City wear. Are you from the Holy City?” asked Mo Fan.

“You’re quite observant. Do you want to surrender, or do you intend to challenge me? You’ve been severely wounded in the Extreme South Land and have been sealed with the Bridge of the Forbidden Curse. You’ve lost the forbidden spell. You’re no different from a normal Super-level Mage now,” said the middle-aged man. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“For the last time, I am not Wei Guang, and I don’t know any person with that name. If there is nothing else, please stop badgering me. I want to eat the roasted meat in peace.”

“Do you know who I am?” The middle-aged man of mixed blood asked calmly.

“No, I don’t.”

“Of course, you don’t know me. I come from the Holy City. However, I never mention the Holy City when I carry out my duties. You can call me the Holy Shadow Apostle, ranked as an Able Angel.” The middle-aged man of mixed blood looked proud when he said this.

“Aren’t there only seven angels in the Holy City?” asked Mo Fan in confusion.

“The seven people are Archangels. The world is huge. Dirty works are carried out in many places. The seven Archangels can’t possibly do everything by themselves,” said the Holy Shadow Apostle.

“So, what exactly are you here for? You only mention your title, but you didn’t even tell me your name. Don’t you have a name?” Mo Fan stared at the man.

“I’m Clark. I have come to kill you,” said the Holy Shadow Apostle.

Mo Fan looked shocked. He stared at Clark at length. “You appall me. I thought you wanted to take away my roasted meat. I don’t like sharing my food with others.”

The corners of Clark’s lips twitched. He glanced at the delicious roasted meat and sneered. “I don’t mind waiting for you to enjoy your last supper.”

“That’s not necessary. The meat must be roasted over a low fire. While waiting for it to cook, I might as well beat you up and kick you out of here so that you won’t disturb me anymore.” Mo Fan stood up. His aura changed.

The dimly lit city was filled with ruins. Some of the twisted steels suspended in mid-air. The soft moonlight shone on them and made their shadows look elongated. It made everything look frightening.

Mo Fan met Clark’s eyes. Their surroundings became even darker. The city, the ruins, and the moonlight looked as if they had been soaked in black ink. For a moment, the illuminated area around the small campfire was the only light in the dark world.

Inside this slightly bright area, two slender figures confronted each other. Even though they were unarmed, the sound of sharp weapons clashing rang in the air.

‘So, he’s a Forbidden Mage.’ Mo Fan sensed Clark’s imposing aura.

The extraordinary power seemed to have expanded Clark’s figure indefinitely. His aura grew so imposing as if he had transformed into a giant and intended to trample Mo Fan under his foot!

This was truly very unexpected. The annoying middle-aged man of mixed blood was a Forbidden Mage.

Mo Fan thought that made logical sense. After all, Wei Guang was a Forbidden Mage, so another Forbidden Mage would be sent to kill him. Mo Fan barely recalled the past, but he felt that Wei Guang’s name was familiar from a year ago.

‘Why is Clark here to kill China’s Forbidden Mage? Did the Archangels from the Holy City have a few screws loose in their heads? Had Wei Guang committed a wicked crime and been sentenced by the Holy City?’

Mo Fan had a lot of questions in his mind. But knowing how Holy City did things, he assumed that Wei Guang might not have done anything wrong. He must have gone against Holy City with good reason.

Mo Fan did not feel anxious about facing a Forbidden Mage. Instead, he felt excitement

Aside from being in the demon form, he had not truly fought with a Forbidden Mage before. He wondered if the man before him had achieved the level where he could cast any forbidden spell independently.

After Mo Fan finished practicing his cultivation, the strength for all his elements had increased by leaps and bounds. He no longer found the common ruler-level creatures and experts to be challenging.

Mo Fan planned to look for a Semi-Forbidden Mage to practice his skill. He had not expected to bump into a Forbidden Mage who was here to kill him.

Mo Fan was not bothered about Clark casting a forbidden spell.

Casting a forbidden spell in the Magic City was no different from a death wish. The emperor-level Ocean Demons still lurked around the city. Casting a forbidden spell would only lure and trigger them. Mo Fan believed Clark was aware of this, too.

Even though Clark was a Forbidden Mage, he could not cast a forbidden spell in the city as of yet. If that was the case, Mo Fan saw no reason to avoid this challenge.
