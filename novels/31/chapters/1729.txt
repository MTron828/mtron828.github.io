A Contracted Beast?

It meant the Flamebird belonged to a Summoner; why did it show up at the ceremony of the winged beasts?

“A Contracted Beast... but it must have repeated the same action for many years, judging from its feathers!” Zhang Xiaohou was confused when he heard Mo Fan’s exclamation.

It was difficult to imagine that the creature was actually a Contracted Beast. Where was its master, then?

A loud cry suddenly came from not far away as the others were puzzled about this.

The group followed the sound and saw a silver-white light piercing through the blue sky and sweeping past the pitch-black Flamebird at crazy speed.

The silver-white light was extremely sharp. It seemed to be streaking past the Flamebird unintentionally, but it ended up slicing the Flamebird’s back open. Fresh blood jetted out from the cut and scattered in the strong wind, shocking them!

“Damn it!” Zhang Xiaohou yelled, glaring at the silver light.

The silver light eventually stopped not far away from Little Moon Moth Phoenix. Mo Fan glanced at it and recognized it as a Great Ruler-level creature he had seen before!

Its body was covered in silver feathers like jagged metal. They could be as sturdy as needles or as flexible as silk. Its massive body was an embodiment of outstanding strength. The feathers on its tail spread like fangs, and wisps of lightning were flowing throughout its body occasionally.

It was the Silver Skyruler!

The tyrant of the West Ridge, the highest leader of the horde of White Magic Falcons!

The Silver Skyruler had arrived a little later than the rest of the winged beasts. It was constantly overtaking the winged beasts like Little Moon Moth Phoenix, but every time it overtook a target, it would brutally slice their back open with its sharp feathers.

The Flamebird was no exception. Its back was sliced open, fresh blood pouring out into the air, yet it was still beating its wings relentlessly with no intention of giving up!

Even though they had no idea why the creature was being so stubborn, they could not help but feel a strong grievance surging in their throats after seeing how much it was struggling!

The Silver Skyruler had obviously done it on purpose. Its eyes were glancing down at the Warrior-level Flamebird on purpose after reaching a greater height, as if it was mocking the Flamebird for not knowing its place!

So what if the Flamebird had managed to reach its current height? A Great Ruler-level creature could still kill it with ease!

Little Moon Moth Phoenix was intelligent. She immediately unleashed a purifying light when she saw the Flamebird was seriously injured.

The light descended upon the Flamebird, now staggering in the Wind of Sorrow, protecting it.

The Light of Moth Feathers supported the damaged and worn-out body of the Flamebird as it began to fall towards the deep canyons below. It vanished from their sight in the blink of an eye.

It was the best the Little Moon Moth Phoenix could do. Mo Fan and the others were powerless to help, as the Wind of Sorrow was too strong, and they were quite a distance away from the Flamebird. They had no chance of providing it with any assistance.

The Flamebird had been wounded already. It was unlikely that the creature would survive after receiving the deadly blow from the Silver Skyruler!

“What a disgusting prick!” Jiang Shaoxu grunted, staring at the Silver Skyruler.

“I didn’t expect the tyrant of the West Ridge to be here, too. It’s the creature that forced the betrayal of the Heavenly Eagles in Hangzhou, giving the White Magic Falcons the opening to invade us, which almost ended up as a huge tragedy!” Mo Fan pointed at the Silver Skyruler.

If the Black Totem Snake had not fended off the demon creatures by himself, the White Magic Falcons’ plan might have succeeded. Mo Fan had been extremely pleased while watching the Black Totem Snake beating the crap out of the Silver Skyruler.

Since then, the tyrant of the West Ridge had no longer dared to invade Hangzhou again.

“The horde of White Magic Falcons has always been a huge threat to us. They are merely one species of the winged beasts in the Qinling Mountains, but the White Magic Falcons have always been ambitious. They keep invading other creatures’ territory every now and then, and are responsible for many killings,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“I can feel how unstoppable it is!” Bai Hongfei spoke up.

“That creature is stronger than the Mountain Crusher Ruler. It might be aiming to claim the throne of the Emperor of Feathers,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“Does that mean the winged beasts of the Qinling Mountains would have to follow its orders once it became the Emperor of Feathers?” Li Dexin said.

“The Qinling Mountains have been peaceful for a long time, mainly because the Emperor of Feathers has always been a gentle species like the Moon Moth Phoenix. If the Silver Skyruler ended up taking control over the winged beasts, it would start a never-ending war. The Silver Skyruler would use the winged beasts as its tools to expand its territory!” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Zhang Xiaohou had been watching over the Qinling Mountains for a long time. He was well aware of the stakes involved. The White Magic Falcons were invasive, and extremely hostile toward humans. If the Silver Skyruler claimed the throne of the Emperor of Feathers, it would pose a huge threat to many of the cities of their country!

The situation along the coastline was already very grim. Many cities had very weak air defenses, especially when the military generally used the Heavenly Eagles as their mounts.

The Heavenly Eagles would betray the military due to the rank of the Silver Skyruler, hence the White Magic Falcons were considered the greatest threat to the country’s skies!

If the Silver Skyruler claimed the throne of the Emperor of Feathers, it was difficult to imagine the consequences!

“Oh my, that thing is so quick, it’s like a jet among the winged beasts. It will soon overtake the Mountain Crusher Ruler!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed, lifting his head.

The Mountain Crusher Ruler was already one of the best among the winged beasts. Not many creatures were ahead of it, but the Silver Skyruler continued to overtake the winged beasts after it showed up!

The Silver Skyruler was an extremely cunning creature. If the winged beast it overtook was not a Ruler-level creature, it would launch a sneak attack on them, but if the creatures were Ruler-level creatures like it, it would not attack them. It was a typical example of bullying the weak and fearing the strong!

The Silver Skyruler did not want to provoke the other Ruler-level creatures, since they might join hands against it. However, the Silver Skyruler had no intention of sparing the Commander-level creatures!

“I was wondering why it didn’t attack us. It must have noticed that Little Moon Moth Phoenix is a Ruler-level creature, right?” Bai Hongfei said.

“The Silver Skyruler has always been a b**ch,” Mo Fan cursed it.

The Silver Skyruler only dared to invade Hangzhou when the Black Totem Snake was at its weakest during the ecdysis. However, when the Black Totem Snake stepped forward and slapped the Silver Skyruler a few times in the face after it was done with the ecdysis, the Silver Skyruler immediately fled for its life after realizing it was no match for the Black Totem Snake...wasn’t it a b**ch?

“There are fewer winged beasts at this height, apart from those that are brought along as cheerleaders,” Zhao Manyan said after looking around.

“It might come down to whoever has the best support squad,” Zhang Xiaohou said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The sky was high and the Wind of Sorrow was strong. Those that had reached the current height were most likely Ruler-level creatures whose strength did not differ by much. Therefore, by taking out a rival, they would be able to claim a higher spot in the competition!

Judging from their current circumstances, the Emperor of Feathers was not necessarily the one that had reached the highest altitude, but the one that had remained aloft in the end!
