Chapter 2676: Power of the Moon

“It seems like we have overestimated our enemy. Fanxue Mountain is about to lose, even though I wasn’t involved in any of the fights!” Nanrong Xu put his hands inside the warm sleeves of his mink coat smugly.

“It’s better to settle it confidently than to be surprised,” Zhao Jing replied.

He was not talking to Nanrong Xu. His eyes were on Nanrong Ni instead.

“What spell did you use on Lin Kang? I had a brief fight with that man who’s using a brush. He’s not weak at all, but he’s about to die under Lin Kang’s Curse. Your magic is surprisingly effective!” Zhao Jing complimented him.

Nanrong Ni was flattered. Being able to play an important role in such a crucial battle was something to be proud of, especially since most of the renowned clans did not treat women seriously.

However, Nanrong Ni was not going to show her thoughts on her face. She knew what Zhao Jing was trying to imply.

“Mayor Lin is about to take out his opponent, but his men are still a little hesitant due to the lack of morale on our side. I have a Moon Talisman that can grant a Super Mage the Power of the Moon.”

Zhao Jing was delighted to hear that. He had thought Nanrong Ni’s Blessing Magic could only strengthen a single person at a time. To his delight, she could strengthen other people simultaneously!

They actually did not have to ask other people for help. The three of them could easily take out Fanxue Mountain!

“What does this Moon Talisman do?” Zhao Jing asked curiously.

“It will increase the basic damage of all destructive spells by roughly fifty percent,” Nanrong Ni told him.

Nanrong Ni had spent all her efforts on improving specific Elements with the help of the Mu Clan and Nanrong Clan’s resources. She was now one step closer to becoming a member of the Mu Clan Committee, not because of her cultivation or her fighting capacity, but because she was able to do what others could not!

The Moon Talisman had the same effect, be it on a Super Mage with a single Element in the Super Level or a Super Mage with all four Elements at the peak of the Super Level, but the difference in strength was shocking.

It was a huge reason as to why the Blessing Element was so highly regarded!

“She has spent almost a year just refining the Moon Talisman. You are most likely the best person that she can give the Moon Talisman to. Not only will it decide whether you can take back the country’s treasure, it would also help her reputation, since this is the first operation she has been involved in after coming out of seclusion,” Nanrong Xu said when he saw Nanrong Ni give Zhao Jing the Moon Talisman.

“So you haven’t tried the Moon Talisman before?” Zhao Jing asked her.

Nanrong Xu shook his head.

“I’m extremely honored then! Don’t worry, you have clearly made the wisest choice by giving it to me!” Zhao Jing declared with a confident smile.

The effect of the Moon Talisman wrapped around its wearer like faint moonlight fairies. They looked like some ancient Runes related to the creation of the universe.

Zhao Jing could feel the effect he was receiving every time the Moon Talisman magic flickered. It felt like all of the Lightning Magic within a hundred kilometers was responding to it.

A destructive aura from his Lightning Magic was already lingering in the air, even before any spell was used. It felt wonderful being filled with such energy!

“Sister Nanrong, can you please give me a Moon Talisman Blessing, too? I also want to massacre the enemy!” Du Tongfei, the leader of the Southern Mercenary Alliance, requested eagerly.

Nanrong Ni pointed at the sky and answered, “It only works on a single target, and it only refreshes after the moon rises above the horizon again.”

Even though it was currently day, the moon was still in the sky. The Moon Talisman could only be used once a day on a single person. The Blessing Element was extremely useful, but it also had a lot of restrictions. It was not always the same as other Elements, which were available at all times.

“I see, but it doesn’t matter. I have no intention to continue wasting my time. Brothers, come with me, let’s avenge our fallen comrades!” Du Tongfei shouted at his men.

The Southern Mercenary Alliance had a huge conflict with Fanxue Mountain during a battle against the sea monsters in the past. They had blamed Fanxue Mountain for the death of their people.

Du Tongfei headed to the Stepped Fields. His target was Bai Hongfei. He grinned coldly, his face murderous.

—

Bai Hongfei was not afraid to take the fight, but Shao Yu stepped in front of him instead. “Let me handle him,” Shao Yu stated.

Bai Hongfei’s cultivation was not high enough. The difference in cultivation would give him a disadvantage. Shao Yu did not allow Bai Hongfei to lose his calm after being provoked.

“But you won’t be able to face him alone, either!” Bai Hongfei protested to her.

Du Tongfei was a Super Mage with three Elements at the Super Level. He had also Awakened his Super Powers!

Du Tongfei would be one of the toughest people to fight among their enemies, but Fanxue Mountain did not have anyone else who could take him on! Zhao Jing was obviously going after Mo Fan after he had received the boost from the Moon Talisman.

“Boss, Shao Yu is going to struggle against Du Tongfei. Should I fight him instead?” Mu Jiang asked Mo Fan, since Mu Ningxue was currently occupied.

“There’s no rush,” Mo Fan shook his head and then looked at Xinxia.

Xinxia understood Mo Fan’s intention. She flipped her hand and revealed a moonlit Seal. It was shining as brightly as a full moon.

“A Moon Talisman!” Mu Jiang, Bai Hongfei, and Shao Yu were shocked.

Zhao Jing and his men were not far away from them. They had all seen Nanrong Ni using her Moon Talisman.

Most people had never seen Blessing Magic above the Advanced Level, hence why the Moon Talisman was so surprising to them.

“This Moon Talisman Blessing is for you!” Xinxia gently pushed her hand forward. The glowing talisman floated toward Shao Yu.

Shao Yu could not react in time even as she subconsciously tried to dodge it.

She was dodging it because she knew how powerful the Moon Talisman was. It was better to give it to Mu Ningxue or Mo Fan to maximize its potential.

Unfortunately, Shao Yu could not escape it. The moonlight wrapped around her with a sacred and powerful Aura.
