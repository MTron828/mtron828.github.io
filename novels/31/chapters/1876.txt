The stronger the Telekinesis, the greater the rate of consumption of Mo Fan’s energy. There were so many demon leeches on the first floor and outside in the parking lot. Mo Fan’s Space Element would be depleted in less than half an hour at this rate!

Even if his energy was depleted, the number of the demon leeches did not seem to be dropping.

“Don’t worry about killing them. Just keep them away!” Lingling said when she noticed Mo Fan’s troubled look.

“My Advanced Spell should be able to kill them,” Mo Fan said.

“That won’t be necessary! Use some other way to make sure everyone is safe. You’re too naive if you think you can kill them all,” Lingling said.

The demon leeches’ numbers were too overwhelming, not to mention the huge group that was surrounding them in the parking lot outside. Mo Fan would not have trouble killing them, but what difference would it make? He would be consuming his energy for no reason. No one knew how many sea monsters they would have to face in the next eight hours. These demon leeches were only Servant-class creatures. In simpler words, they were merely the cannon fodder of the army of sea monsters, even though the demon leeches were trickier to deal with than they had thought.

Mo Fan focused on saving the civilians with his Telekinesis. He was grabbing a civilian on one side while tossing another on the other side. He would mix in the Chaos Element too. When a group of people was heading for the stairs, which were crawling with the demon leeches, Mo Fan simply reversed gravity and lifted them to the third floor like they were taking a lift.

“There are more of them ahead!” Shen Qing immediately ran in the direction of someone’s scream.

Mo Fan’s Telekinesis was struggling to keep up with the pace of the demon creatures. Rescuing was more difficult than killing demon creatures most of the time, especially when the civilians were knocked to the ground by the demon leeches. Mo Fan could not afford to use his Lightning or Fire Spells. He had to separate the civilians and the demon leeches first before killing the leeches with a Fire Burst.

“Help...help me!...” came a loud scream from a brand-name fashion outlet.

Mo Fan was in the corridor opposite the shop. He had just rescued a family of four surrounded by a bunch of demon leeches, and did not even have the chance to catch his breath when he heard the scream.

Mo Fan jumped over the rail and launched himself to the opposite corridor. However, several demon leeches suddenly jumped into the air from the water below to intercept Mo Fan like he was a piece of flying meat.

“Damn it, you disgusting pricks, die!” Mo Fan reacted swiftly. He clenched his fists when he saw the demon leeches jumping into the air after him.

Scorching flames emerged around Mo Fan like a burning flower. The demon leeches instantly curled up after making contact with the flames. If they were just ordinary flames, the demon leeches could protect themselves by curling up, but Mo Fan’s flame was a Soul-grade fire! The flames easily broke through their protective outer layer before burning through their thick skin and bodies.

If Mo Fan was not worried that his flames would burn some civilians to ashes, he would have used a Sky-Flame Funeral to wipe out these disgusting creatures!

“I dare you to come at me!” Mo Fan scoffed after he successfully reached the opposite corridor. He glanced back at the demon leeches who were falling into the water as ashes.

“Help, help me!” the unpleasant voice inside the fashion outlet yelled again.

Mo Fan immediately picked up a disgusting smell after going inside the shop. He looked inside and saw a fatty who most likely weighed over a hundred kilograms screaming for help on the ground. He was pressing his body down on a demon leech around a meter long. There was a huge mirror between him and the demon leech.

Blood was pouring out from the demon leech, but the fatty was perfectly unharmed. It was likely that the clumsy demon leech had made a mistake and hit the mirror when it was pouncing at the fatty, and the fatty somehow ended up on top. The fatty was pretty smart, and knew he could not make direct contact with the demon leech, as he might get stuck to it.

“Damn it, I thought you were dying. Why the hell were you screaming so loudly for?” Mo Fan grunted. He was left speechless by the sight before him.

“Brother, isn’t it obvious that I’m in a pinch here? I don’t even dare to move anywhere. It might pounce on me again. Won’t I be dead if another one of these things shows up?!” the fatty sobbed.

“Fine, your voice is the loudest in this building...”

“I’m loud because I’m still f**king alive. Those who can no longer shout are already dead!”

“That does make some sense... by the way, can you do me a favor? I’m having trouble rescuing everyone when you all are scattered across the shopping lot,” Mo Fan told the fatty.

“F**k me, I’m screaming for help so someone can save me from this pinch here! However, not only aren’t you helping, you are asking me for a favor instead? Damn it, damn it, I’m going to crush you! How dare you try to drink my blood! It has always been me sucking my customers’ blood! Since when did I give you the permission to drink mine!” the fatty cursed.

“We should be helping one another in their time of need. If you don’t agree to help me, I’ll go and save the others first,” Mo Fan said.

“Brother, I really don’t have any money!”

“I’m not asking for your money.”

Mo Fan was surprised when he noticed the badge of a manager on the fatty’s chest after getting rid of the clumsy demon leech for him.

The fatty was the operating manager of the shopping mall, an employee with a high position. He had asked the right person to do him a favor!

“Brother, brother, can I go back and lay on the mirror instead? You can find someone else for the job. I’m begging you,” the fatty pleaded.

“Don’t worry, I’ll keep you safe,” Mo Fan said.

“You don’t look so reliable to me. I’m being serious, I’m begging you, I’m not necessarily a piece of fat meat. They won’t bother eating me even if you hang me in the air...” the fatty almost burst into tears.

“Enough talk, let’s do it!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mo Fan ignored the fatty’s plea. He tossed the man into the air and kept him hovering in the center of the shopping area.

The fatty was currently beyond the corridor. The seawater was around eight meters below him. Countless demon leeches were swimming in the water. The surface of the water started bubbling when the fatty was hung in the air like bait.

Most people had been evacuated to the third floor. Shen Qing was keeping an eye on them, but many demon leeches were still climbing their way up. They would soon occupy the third floor, the fourth floor, and finally the fifth floor!

The people in the shopping areas would have nowhere to run to eventually. Having this thought, Mo Fan believed they could not afford to remain passive anymore!
