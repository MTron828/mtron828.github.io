The most powerful Shadow Spells were related to a Domain that was established beforehand by spreading out the Caster’s Dark Material.

The spells of the Dark Element had a great weakness. Whenever the Light Element was used and the light it produced was too bright for shadows to stay around, the Shadow Element would no longer work, making it difficult for Shadow Mages to use spells like the Fleeing Shadow and Giant Shadow Spike.

Mo Fan was in the middle of the exploding spells, yet he was able to cast Ink Shadow freely thanks to the Dark Moon Crystal he had obtained from Jimei University! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The magical Dark Moon Crystal had thoroughly modified the traits of Mo Fan’s Dark Material, building a powerful Dark Vein into Mo Fan’s body.

The Dark Vein was similar to Mo Fan’s blood veins, and was located inside Mo Fan’s body. The reason he could use Ink Shadow without being affected by the Light Element was because the Dark Energy was constantly flowing through his body. The lack of Dark Energy on the outside would not affect Mo Fan’s magic now!

His Ink Shadow left only a faint presence in the area where the spells had bombarded. The real Mo Fan had woven through the Blue Star Knights and reached a safer spot.

“He’s over there!”

“Damn it, was it Blink?”

“No way, I have been staring at him all the time. I was going to interrupt his Space Spell as soon as I saw its flicker. There was no way he could escape with Blink when our spells landed on him!” a Blue Star Knight with the Psychic Element exclaimed.

It was difficult to use Blink in an area being blasted with Elemental Spells. There had no clue as to how Mo Fan relocated himself.

“Look out, under your feet!” An alert Light Mage had noticed something.

Many immediately lowered their gaze and noticed the ground they were standing on had been replaced with a huge black swamp. Their shoes had already sunk a few millimeters into it.

When did the black swamp appear?

“Get rid of it!” Everyone knew the Light Element was effective against Dark Magic!

The benefits of having an advantage in numbers was displayed, as many of the Blue Star Knights were Light Mages. They immediately drove the dark swamp below their feet away when they realized something was not right.

The Light Spells were very effective. They managed to drive away the Dark Magic, even though Mo Fan’s Shadow Element had reached the Super Level.

Mo Fan was not too bothered by it. It was only one of his attempts. It had managed to keep a few Blue Star Knights busy.

“Mo Fan, look out!” Kris’ voice suddenly appeared amid the blasts.

Mo Fan turned around and saw four Blue Star Knights sneaking up from behind him. They were rapidly firing Lightning Spells at him, intending to paralyze him!

Mo Fan was able to absorb Lightning Magic, but that did not necessarily mean he would be able to endure every Lightning Spell. Those Lightning Spells were obviously imbued with the power of Soul-grade Seeds. He would obviously lose some strength if the lightning hit him!

Mo Fan raised his hands without turning around. “Rock Stele!”

His hands were emitting a golden-brown light. A huge stele suddenly emerged from the ground around a meter away, standing firmly behind Mo Fan.

The Lightning Spells struck the golden-brown stele, preventing them from reaching Mo Fan. The Lightning Magic was unable to penetrate it.

“Damn it, he has the Earth Element too!?” The Blue Star Knights with the Lightning Element were frustrated.

The Earth Element was perfect at restricting the Lightning Element’s conductivity. Almost any Lightning Mage would roll their eyes as soon as they saw the thick barrier of rock!

“It’s fine, we’ve distracted him.”

“Look above him.”

A dozen terrifying ice caskets were falling down on Mo Fan just as he nullified the sneak attack from behind!

Even if the Icebound Coffins did not inflict serious injuries on Mo Fan, their chill was still beyond an ordinary person’s tolerance.

Mo Fan reacted swiftly, and the soil under his feet rippled as he increased his speed with Earth Wave. The Icebound Coffins were not all falling at the same rate. Mo Fan was able to avoid their direct impacts with his nimble footwork!

As he expected, the Icebound Coffins were not dangerous because of their force of impact, but from the insane freezing energy that was unleashed when they smashed into the ground.

The cold surged wildly instead of spreading slowly like a normal Ice Spread.

Mo Fan could not afford to preserve his strength any further! “Blazing Ignition!”

Mo Fan was engulfed in flames as the Calamity Fire, Ardent Sunset, and Meteor Scarlet were unleashed simultaneously, forming a Domain in the shape of a ring. It was like an impenetrable wall, stopping the Ice Magic from pushing any closer!

If Little Flame Belle was around, the Ice Element would not necessarily suppress his Fire Element. The truth was, when the Fire Magic was stronger, the Ice Element was the one that would be suppressed instead.

The Icebound Coffins were nullified too! The Blue Star Knights began to feel ashamed. Their spells were stronger as they were Casting them in a group, yet they still could not take Mo Fan out after a few volleys?

“Keep attacking, use Intermediate Spells if you need to, don’t stop!”

The Blue Star Knights were overwhelmed by anger. They did not give Mo Fan any chance to catch his breath.

They needed some time to recover from the Casting of their Advanced Spells, but they could fire their Intermediate Spells continuously. It was almost impossible to defeat a group of Mages alone. Even a demon creature would have to withdraw from the fight, let alone a human!

Intermediate Spells were easy to cast since they were all Advanced Mages. The damage of Intermediate Spells being fired at a high rate could be just as significant. It was unlikely that Mo Fan would be able to defend himself by hiding behind an Earth Spell. Mo Fan was not Zhang Xiaohou, after all. He was unable to weave through a rain of bullets like a ghost.

Mo Fan did not dodge the attacks. He relocated himself to a spot where he was facing most of the Blue Star Knights to ensure no one was going to sneak up on him from behind.

Kris was quite intelligent. He noticed Mo Fan was wary of enemies showing up behind him. He immediately advanced closer to Mo Fan and kept a close eye on the Blue Star Knights with the Shadow Element.

The Intermediate Spells were too easy to cast. Every Blue Star Knight was firing them like an automatic weapon!

Mo Fan did not Blink away when he saw the destructive spells approaching him.

Blinking away would not make any difference. His enemies were casting Intermediate Spells continuously. They would simply keep firing Intermediate Spells at him after he relocated to a safe spot.

Mo Fan stood there, observing the paths the spells were flying along.

“Chaos Vortex!”

Mo Fan suddenly executed a spell that took every Blue Star Knight by surprise!
