3010 The Person With Strange Irises

A red spot slowly appeared on the clear blue sky above Athens. It expanded and covered the whole sky. The people on top of the buildings sensed an enormous figure covering the large area.

It was a red dragon. It flapped its wings and flew past the skyrise buildings of Athens flashily. It left a torrent of dust and leaves in its wake over the streets as it flew to the Parthenon Temple.

“It must be Lady Karolina. It’s her red dragon!”

“How can she fly over our city at her own will? The enormous dragon looks extremely dangerous,” said several Mages of Athens.

“Her red dragon has a green certificate issued by St. Petersburg Church. Thus, her dragon can fly all over the sky of Europe. It naturally is Lady Karolina’s expensive and luxurious private jet.”

“Speaking of which, why is she heading to the Parthenon Mountain?”

“The Victorian family often pays a visit to Greece. The news frequently reported that they are very close with the saintesses and Duke Ayleen.”

“I suppose the Victorian family supports Ye Xinxia, right?”

“I suppose so. But Lady Karolina is Ayleen’s stepmother. She, too, has the same right to inherit the Victorian family’s fortunes. Hence, it depends on who Lady Karolina wants to support. If she supports Izisha, then the Victorian family and a vast majority of the ancient, British great families will share equal number of votes.”

The election was around the corner. The focus of the topic was on the two saintesses sculptures in Athens. Many Greek restaurants divided their menus to join in the fun of the election.

It was clear that Lady Karolina was an important figure in the election. She represented a certain number of the British votes.

Her high-profile appearance sent the people of Athens into a strange circle of “deep discussion”.

The discussion involved the election matter and the unspeakable relationship between a certain person with the two saintesses…

The most shocking news of all was that the choice of goddess was already pre-decided. The insider information was appalling. Everyone preferred to do things that captured the crowd’s attention.

The goddess election had a more exaggerated influence than the World Cup.

The World Cup was a celebrated event for the men. Meanwhile, the goddess election was an important occasion for both men and women.

The election lasted for a month. Before the start of the official election, the worshippers of the Parthenon Temple would fill Athens. Various traditional rituals and events surrounding the election would take place in Athens. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Therefore, that month was the best time for travelers from all over the world to come to Athens and enjoy the unprecedented serenity, elegance, luxury, and amazement of the events in the city.

…

Flowers bloomed after an abundant rainfall last month. Truckloads of fresh olives were delivered to Greece and were used to adorn every corner of the city. The flowers looked pure and pretty. They were seen in every corner of the city.

Greece without its goddess was like a city without a soul.

It had been many years since a goddess was elected to lead Greece. The signs of deterioration of the city were obvious.

Today, the election finally kick-started.

The Parthenon Temple’s ultimate leader possessed Resurrection Divine Art, and she would descend to the city soon.

…

The streetlamps were decorated with flower chains. The draping flower chains glowed brightly with luster even in the middle of the night. When they walked on the streets in Athens, they thought they had accidentally stumbled into a European aristocrat’s grand wedding. They were intoxicated by the beautiful sights, not to mention that each turn was a surprise in itself.

At that moment, The Great Mage Parina was on the “dream” streets. She wore a light gray sweater and covered her hair and part of her forehead with a hood. She looked like a night runner who did not want to grab people’s attention. She enjoyed her own peace and music under the quiet city.

After shedding the luxurious robes that belonged to a Great Mage, Parina blended into the dimly lit corners of the city perfectly well. The place was far away from the city and the Parthenon Mountain. There were no streetlights in the remote place. Even the administrative officers refused to pay attention to that place, because the tourists would not visit it. The sparsely scattered floral remnants was a pathetic indication that they, too, were celebrating the “festival”.

Parina trotted along. Her steady breathing was audible on the quiet but filthy path.

As she passed by a jumble of forest, a pair of greedy eyes lit up in the middle of the darkened tree trunks. The eyes were glued to Parina’s shapely gray figure.

Parina ran into an even more remote, narrow path. The pair of eyes vanished before resurfacing from a dilapidated hut next to Parina. The owner of the eyes coveted her graceful, athletic figure.

The path was so quiet that even the sound of stray cats rummaging through trash cans was loud.

When Parina trotted to a dilapidated house with dead ends, the owner with that pair of greedy eyes appeared before her suddenly!

Under the faint moonlight, she saw a man with a skinny jawline. He looked like someone suffering from anorexia. He was a bag of bones. However, he had a pair of gleaming eyes. His gaze was so sharp as if they could skin someone alive.

“How can I help you?” Parina stopped and stared at the person with strange irises.

“I suffer from a disease. I’m in unbearable pain,” said the person.

“I’m not a doctor. You can go to the hospital for your… condition,” said Parina.

“Any woman who is as beautiful and mature as you can cure my sickness. After you make me happy, I can turn your skin and bones into a beautiful small jar as a token of my appreciation. My handiwork is regarded as a treasure in some of the world’s most famous men’s vaults. Isn’t this every woman’s wish?” The man with strange irises spoke eagerly.

“You’ve been making a lot of these small jars lately, haven’t you? Your hands are shaking. Is it due to overworking?” asked Parina.

The man was surprised at her words.

Under normal circumstances, a beautiful night jogger like her would be afraid of him. He expected Parina to flee in shock, and cry for help in the deserted streets. Meanwhile, the man himself would pursue her while enjoying the chase.

“I’ve indeed made a lot of jars. A big client provided me with many perfect materials,” said the man with strange irises.

“Okay. I’ve come to the right person, then.” Parina removed her hood and revealed her forehead with the sanction mark, as well as her tawny-blonde, long hair that gave off an air of nobility.

“Y-You are the Daughter of Resurrection, Parina!” The person with strange irises was so shocked that his eyes flickered.

“Who gave you the materials to make the forty urns?” Parina approached the person slowly.

“I hunted them myself…” The person with strange irises slowly retreated. He looked stunned.
