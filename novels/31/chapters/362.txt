Chapter 363: The Interns of the Magic Courts

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

Zhu Meng fondled his thick beard.

The truth was, it was not his first affair with the Black Totem Snake. He was well aware of its outstanding senses. Since his Royal Guards were unable to track the Totem down, it was indeed a better idea to send the interns after him.

The Magic Courts had quite a number of interns, and not only interns, but those who were on probation before officially joining the Magic Courts, too. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He would not believe that a group of elites was not enough to handle Tangyue, who had just become a member of the Magic Courts!

“Go, get every single person that’s available and make sure you bring them back here,” ordered Zhu Meng.

The Royal Guards saluted before proceeding with the order. They began to arrange every intern and those that were on probation.

In Zhejiang Institute’s campus, located in Jinxi, a man yelled out in excitement in the student lodge, “Brother, are you serious about that?!”

“How could I lie to you? This operation can only be done by interns and people on probation. I immediately listed your name when I heard the news from my superior...” a rough voice said on the other end.

“Thank you so much, I’ve always wanted to join the Magic Courts! Even if I’m only considered on probation now, it would still give me a great advantage competing for a spot on the main campus,” Liu Yilin blurted out in excitement.

“It’s a very precious chance for you. I heard that if you performed well, you will be promoted straight to an official member of the Magic Court, with a bright future ahead!” agreed the man on the other end.

“An official member of the Magic Court... this... brother, what operation is it exactly?” asked Liu Yilin.

“I don’t know yet, but I was told that it’s something to do with the Skyscraping Snake. Don’t ask too many questions. Pack your stuff and come to me at once. Your brother is only an intern, too. It’s already hard enough to get you a spot.”

“Right, I’ll be there soon.”

Becoming a member of the Magic Court straight away. The title alone was a guarantee that the Enforcement Union would fully support him to become an Advanced Magician!

What was the biggest difference between Magicians? The amount of effort they put in their cultivation?

Of course not! What a Magician really needed was resources, a formidable background or faction that was willing to train you!

The Enforcement Union was almost every student’s ambition. Whenever Liu Yilin thought about the possibility of becoming an official member of the Magic Court if he performed well, he could feel his little galaxy exploding!

He would not have such a great chance at leaping into the dragon door again, thus he had to make good use of it!

“Liu Yilin, where are you going?”

“I’ve been told to do a mission for the Enforcement Union,” replied Liu Yilin in a proud tone.

“Bullshit, you’re only on probation. Even though it sounds rather cool among the students, I’m pretty sure you’re far away from becoming an official member of the Magic Court. Why would they send you on a mission?” the man with brown hair asked with a smile.

“I can tell you that if the mission is a success, I’ll soon be promoted to an intern, or if I’m lucky enough, I can even become an official member. When the time comes, who else in this Zhejiang Institute is worthy to be compared with me?” answered Liu Yilin.

“Are you sure about that?” The man saw Liu Yilin was being rather serious about it.

“Of course!”

Heading west, Mo Fan did not dare to ride his beloved mount, knowing that he could not afford to attract any attention. He had no choice but to leave Hangzhou City with Tangyue on foot.

The sky was slightly lit when they arrived at the outskirts of the city. Mo Fan said to Tangyue when he saw the sweat on her forehead and her nervous look, “Your god is better than my little loli.”

“What little loli?” asked Tangyue.

“Lingling from the Clearsky Hunter Agency, my partner. It’s been a while since I last met her. I do miss her now,” said Mo Fan.

“Oh, are you talking about the little girl Leng Qing? She’s an extremely talent among the people in the Magic Court. Among the girls in the Magic Court, I’m the most impressed by her. I was occupied when the Black Vatican was targeting you, so I asked Leng Qing to seek help from the Clearsky Hunter Agency, but I didn’t expect you to be a hunter under them... Speaking of which, they only recruit the best elites, why would they let you join?” said Tangyue.

“I don’t like the sound of that. It feels like you’re saying that I’m normal,” protested Mo Fan.

Tangyue smiled. Her nervous face slightly relaxed. She glanced at the Totem Orb, then at the magnificent Hangzhou City behind them.

“Miss Tangyue, don’t you worry. With me, Mo Fan, here, I’ll make sure you both arrive at the White Mountain Thousand Caves safely.” Mo Fan softly patted Tangyue’s shoulder.

“Thank you...” Tangyue felt a little sorry for him.

She never thought it would turn out like this. The Enforcement Union would have sent out a warrant after them, and Mo Fan was only involved in this mess because of her.

Tangyue thought Mo Fan would only escort the Black Totem Snake to the White Mountain Thousand Caves with her. He was an outsider, and someone she could trust, thus it would help them avoid the traitor in her tribe. To her surprise, Zhu Meng was already given power by the two organizations with the highest authority in the nation. As a result, Mo Fan had no choice but to face the people of the Enforcement Union with her.

“Miss Tangyue, in my opinion, I think you can only repay my sacrifice of putting my life at stake by pledging to marry me,” said Mo Fan with a stern look.

Tsk tsk, the two mountains with the urge to burst out from her buttoned shirt, and the booty so firm that not a single wrinkle could be seen on her skirt. Mo Fan had already spent quite some time indulging in his lewd imaginations when he attended her classes back in the days. He could not help but recall the intense situation in the backseat of the taxi. If he failed to secure such extraordinary beauty, Mo Fan felt like he would be letting his father Mo Jiaxin down by not producing enough kids for the Mo Family!

“If you managed to help the big guy escape from the danger...” Tangyue bit her red lips and said after a slight hesitation, “I’ll promise you.”

Mo Fan’s jaw almost dropped to the ground. Was Miss Tangyue actually thinking of pledging to marry him?

“Miss Tangyue, that has to be a joke, right?” he asked hurriedly.

Tangyue stared into Mo Fan’s eyes seriously, but she soon shifted her focus and said sincerely, “My father left me at a very young age, I remember he once said that even if he’s not around, he would be watching me like a star in the sky, protecting me... I didn’t know what he meant back then, until the god’s figure slowly surfaced from the West Lake.

“Mo Fan, maybe you find it hard to believe that the god is actually guarding the city, and I do admit that I’m clueless if he’s done anything harmful in the past. The people of our tribe are only obeying the teachings passed down to us from our ancestors, but at least I’m confident that he’s looking after me. He has done so for many years, and now when he’s the most vulnerable, I really want to try my best to protect him to overcome the current situation. He’s really important to me, and you’re willing to take such a huge risk just to help me, so I don’t think any request from you can actually outweigh how much you’re helping me.”

Mo Fan softly patted Tangyue’s shoulder to comfort her. He could easily tell that the Snake Boos was protecting her like her father, he was her family.

Therefore, he should not be taking advantage of someone else’s precarious situation!

It was not like Mo Fan wasn’t extremely touched by Tangyue’s words, but he assumed that if he were to do anything harmful to Tangyue, the Snake Boss which had been looking after her would swallow him with a single bite, not even leaving his bones behind.

It was wise for him to examine his attitude closely. Sometimes, you shouldn’t totally believe a woman’s words...
