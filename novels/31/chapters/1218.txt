The group went close to the cave that Lin Feili lived in. Mo Fan quickly discovered two soldiers guarding the entrance. They clearly had no intention of letting let anyone pass.

“Jiang Shaoxu, can you take them out?” Mo Fan pointed at the two soldiers in gray-blue outfits.

“Their cultivation isn’t strong, I’ll handle them,” Jiang Shaoxu agreed.

“Be careful, they might be communicating constantly to see if everything is fine. If they don’t respond, the others might notice something is wrong,” Mo Fan reminded her.

“Don’t worry, I know how to control their minds.”

Jiang Shaoxu went into the rocks and cast an Advanced Psychic Element Spell to control the minds of the soldiers from over a hundred meters away.

The mental strength of the two soldiers was not high. Jiang Shaoxu was able to control them easily.

Mo Fan, Mu Nujiao, and Lingling strutted past the soldiers, yet they did not even react. One of them was still reporting through his communicator.

They walked inside and soon arrived in the valley. Hiding behind the rocks, Mo Fan peeked through the cracks and saw the people of the Golden Battle Hunters surrounded by a hundred soldiers. The person in charge was a bearded man with a bulky build. His face was like a brown-haired tiger.

“That guy is Zhang Qihu. He’s pretty strong. Shi Qianshou was only focusing on Ge Ming, while that Zhang Qihu took out the rest of us. We didn’t even have time to fight back,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“They have a lot of men. Can you tell how many Advanced Mages and Intermediate Mages they have?” Mo Fan asked.

“Sure, but it will take some time,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

It was necessary to understand the strength of their enemy. Jiang Shaoxu sneakily used her Psychic Element to inspect the soldiers’ cultivation levels, while Mo Fan silently moved into the valley with the Dark Noble Mantle.

The Dark Noble Mantle was extremely handy at preventing his presence from being exposed. Even a Super Mage was unable to notice him if they weren’t close enough.

Mo Fan observed the surroundings and realized only a few people were guarding the valley. The others had gone deeper into the valley through the passage.

It was good news for Mo Fan. It was incredibly difficult to take on the entire army, but if the soldiers split up, it was easier for him to take them out one by one!

“There are seven Advanced Mages, the rest are Intermediate Mages. I’m afraid we can’t really take them on, right?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

A hundred Intermediate Mages were stronger than ten Advanced Mages. If they could not make it past the entrance of the valley, how were they supposed to save Zhang Xiaohou, Lin Feili, Ge Ming, and the others that had gone deeper inside?

“We still have a chance if there’s only seven of them. Mu Nujiao, don’t show yourself. I’ll keep them distracted while you lay down a Demon Tree. Jiang Shaoxu, take care of those with the Psychic Element and the Curse Element, leave the rest to me!” Mo Fan said.

“Mo Fan, are you sure about going up against over a hundred Mages on your own?”

“Why not?”

Mu Nujiao did not say a word, she was already preparing her Demon Tree in the dark. All Plant Magic required a certain time to prepare. Once they planted enough roots and branches across the area, they were basically unbeatable inside it.

The ground was surprisingly sturdy in the area, so it was even harder to penetrate it with plants. However, it also had an advantage; the ground did not shake much, so the Mages with the Earth Element would not notice any abnormalities easily.

That being said, if the plants reached under their feet, and if the cultivation of the Mages was on par with Mu Nujiao’s, they would still sense her magic...

“Keep your chin up; when boss secures the Earth Pistil, we are all going to be living it up. We can do whatever we want, without having to be wary of what the army thinks!” Zhang Qihu said to the soldiers.

“Captain, it’s such a waste to let those two girls go. Shouldn’t we just have kept them so we could relieve the boredom?” a soldier replied promptly.

“Humph, you are all soldiers, but you are acting like bandits instead!” a female soldier snapped furiously.

“Lieutenant Huang Yi, you’re quite wrong about that. Aren’t soldiers basically the same as bandits in the old times? It simply depends on who’s holding the power in their hands. You can ask even the honest men among us if they were interested in the two girls just then. Not only were they gorgeous, their bodies were hot, too. They must have come from a nice background. It was the only chance that soldiers like us could taste them...” the upright soldier said. “Am I right, brothers?”

“Yes! HAHAHA!”

“We’ve been following orders from the military and guarding the cities and outskirts. We are sent to the most dangerous places, yet we don’t even get any benefits from it. We are risking our lives for the army, but we are living like refugees. Since we followed General Shi, even though we are still putting our lives at risk, the benefits he gave us are nothing like before!” Zhang Qihu agreed with the proud soldier, “Huang Yi, you should just turn your back on something like this. Us men who live on the edge have a lot of desires to satisfy still!”

“Captain is right, I’m just wondering if Black Falcon managed to catch up to them... perhaps he’s already enjoying the girls himself!”

The hidden Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu flushed. Their hearts were burning with anger.

What the proud soldier said about soldiers being the same as bandits was absolute nonsense. They had seen a lot of righteous soldiers!

Evil could not be justified. If anyone let the evil in their hearts take control, they would be scum and degenerates, regardless of their appearance on the outside. That Zhang Qihu and the proud soldier might be lieutenants, but it was ridiculous how they thought every other soldier was the same as them!

“It seems these people knew what they were doing all along. They are prepared to take the risks, too. I believe I won’t have to go easy on them!” Mo Fan scoffed.

Mo Fan had a good impression of soldiers because Chief Military Instructor Zhan Kong and his men were willing to sacrifice their lives for others, without asking for anything in return.

It was obvious that these soldiers were corrupted!

They had abused the remoteness of the desert to foster the evil thoughts in their hearts. Mo Fan believed it was necessary for their souls to wander in the wild winds of the desert for hundreds, or even a thousand years, so they would realize how idiotic the path they had chosen was!

“Summoning Gate: Beast Tide!”

A lunar light shrouded Mo Fan as he swiftly constructed a Star Constellation. It glowed brightly as a giant Summoning Gaye slowly opened, and enormous white wolves rushed out!

The white wolves just kept coming. They were bulky and muscular, and the whole valley was shaking from the force their limbs were exerting.

—

The wolves charged into the valley, taking the soldiers that were expressing their ideas so freely by surprise!

“What’s happening!?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Demon creatures, we are being attacked!”

“Don’t panic, stand in your formations, prepare for battle!” the female Lieutenant Huang Yi yelled.

The soldiers were well-trained, since they were elites in the army. They moved into their positions in no time, despite the surprise attack. They quickly summoned Rock Barriers accurately around their formation to stop the wolves from getting any closer!

A Flying Creek Snow Wolf dashed out from the group of wolves. It pounced at the rocks and smashed them into pieces, then swung its claws at a soldier nearby.

The soldier was instantly torn to pieces with blood splattered across the area. The man had a perverted smile while talking to the proud soldier just a minute ago, but he had died a horrible death!

The Rock Barriers only managed to hold the enormous wolves back temporarily. Their thick flesh endured the flames, lightning, and wind directed at them as they tore savagely at the soldiers they could get their claws on!

“Maintain the formation! It’s only a bunch of wolves, there’s nothing to be afraid of!” The proud soldier was one of the people in charge. He stood on the higher ground and commanded his men.

The troops cast Fire Spells simultaneously. The Star Patterns stacked up before numerous fiery red rays swept past and landed on the wolves in the form of Fiery Fists!

Not long after, strong gusts of wind appeared and swept at the wolves, scattering them.

“Rain of Burning Fists!” Mo Fan stood on the shoulder of one of the wolves and fired flames into the air. Huge Fiery Fists soon poured down from the sky and landed on the soldiers, forcing them to split up!

“Who’s there!?” the proud soldier shouted furiously when he saw Mo Fan.

“Your ancestor!” Mo Fan leapt into the air as a pair of burning wings swiftly appeared on his back.

Using the wings, Mo Fan glided across the sky with the Fiery Fists. He locked his eyes on the proud soldier and threw a punch, sending a fiery dragon at him!

The fiery dragon sprang forward and easily penetrated the defense of the Light Element that the soldiers had set up. The flames of the dragon devoured the proud soldier and immediately burned him to ashes.

Both Mu Nujiao and Jiang Shaoxu were satisfied when they saw the proud soldier being incinerated. They knew the man was harboring evil thoughts on them when they were still in the soldiers’ custody. It served a man like him right!

“Mo Fan, it’s Mo Fan!” Yang Bao blurted out in joy.

“He’s a man of honor, he actually came to save us!” Xu Pingdong and the others were lost for words.

Despite being overwhelmed by numbers, Mo Fan had still forced his way in. They were very grateful, yet was it really wise for him to walk right into the trap?

“Brother Mo Fan, we are grateful for it, but you should run and leave the desert. Tell the army what happened here, so we can die content, knowing that justice has been served!” Xu Pingdong shouted out.
