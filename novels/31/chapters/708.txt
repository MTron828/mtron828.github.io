The Lingyin Enforcement Union...

A clear stream flowed down the slanted wall of stones, making the words carved on the wall wet so they would flicker under the sunlight of the setting sun.

In a small bamboo wood, golden light shone down. A simple table and a few seats made of stone stood in the middle. The place was often used as a meeting room by the Enforcement Union to discuss matters with outsiders.

“The plane, do I need to pay for the loss?” Mo Fan tapped his finger on the table and interrogated the two teaching staff of Parthenon Temple College sternly.

“No... there’s no need for that, it’s covered by insurance, don’t worry about it,” said Glorkian with a friendly face.

This time, his smile was sincere. It was no longer the polite yet disrespectful kind. The truth was, he was still occupied by the experience of being brought here by the flying Black Totem Snake.

No wonder the old priests specifically warned them not to stir up any trouble in China. Did the state government seriously not care when there was such an enormous snake in the city? Holy crap!

“Are you still going to take her away?” Mo Fan pointed at Xinxia beside him. He had completely turned into a class teacher with a drink in his hand.

“Err... Brother Mo Fan...”

“Call me teacher!”

“Teacher Mo, Miss Ye Xinxia is indeed very suitable to study at our college. We’re just following orders. The person that has an interest in her is a lot more powerful than us,” said Glorkian in a slightly embarrassed tone.

Ye Xinxia was amused by the man’s attitude. This Glorkian was extremely well-behaved after losing the fight. He was a totally different person compared to his previous proud behavior.

“I don’t really care, my decision is final for the girl. Take a plane and go back to India yourself, and tell that person Xinxia is fine staying in her country. There’s no need for her to go there!” said Mo Fan.

“It’s Greece...” Glorkian emphasized.

“It’s the same!” said Mo Fan.

“I’m afraid we can’t accept that. The truth is, we’re pretty strict at selecting our students. We won’t give up on those we’ve chosen...” Glorkian said firmly, but he immediately glanced in the direction of the West Lake.

“Still not giving up?” asked Mo Fan.

“We don’t want any trouble. We’re sincerely inviting Miss Ye Xinxia to our college. If we fail to bring back the student that the Great Mentor is interested in, we’re doomed,” said Glorkian.

“I guess that concludes our discussion, I’ll ask the Black Totem Snake to send you back to In...oh, Greece,” Mo Fan rose to his feet.

Glorkian and Digaeus wore troubled looks, not knowing what to do.

“Mo Fan, there’s no need to be so harsh. Let’s listen to what they have to say,” advised Tang Zhong.

“Yeah, Teacher Mo, you too know that Miss Ye Xinxia’s legs are troubled by some strange disease. The Parthenon Temple is known for healing all kinds of weird diseases. Perhaps Miss Ye Xinxia can find a way to heal her legs while studying there? At least, the Great Mentor would try her best to help. We’re eager to bring her back just so she can be treated as soon as possible. After all, the Great Mentor is fairly busy. Even her students will only be taught by her a few times,” said Glorkian.

Mo Fan switched his attention to Xinxia, who was looking at him.

“Are you being serious?” demanded Mo Fan.

“We’ve already told Professor Lu about it. Didn’t she mention it at all?” said Glorkian.

Mo Fan shook his head.

Glorkian let out a wry smile. “Teacher Mo, you must believe in the Parthenon Temple. You are still young, so it’s likely that you’re not familiar with the organizations across the world, but you can ask President Tang Zhong here. There’s almost nothing that our Parthenon Temple can’t treat once we have agreed to heal the person. We even have the ability to revive someone if the conditions are met,” said Glorkian.

It was not Mo Fan’s first time hearing about Parthenon Temple. When Xu Zhaoting was turned into a Cursed Beast and Wang Xiaojun’s soul was shattered, they said that only the Parthenon Temple could save them. However, Mo Fan was still unfamiliar with the organization. He needed Tang Zhong to give him some advice.

“Mo Fan, Glorkian is right. Parthenon Temple is actually a lot more impressive than he has said. Lu Ping has spent lots of time trying to cure Ye Xinxia’s disease, but she still can’t figure out anything. I heard that you’ve also asked Han Ji of the Clock Tower Enforcement Union to take a look, yet he has no clue how to treat her, either. If even Han Ji is clueless, I’m afraid you won’t find any effective cure in our country,” said Tang Zhong.

Mo Fan fell silent.

Han Ji was a talented Healer. After the calamity, in order to express his gratitude toward Mo Fan, he had paid a visit to Hangzhou when Mo Fan while still training on the mountain. However, Mo Fan soon heard from Han Ji that he had no idea how to treat Xinxia’s disease, either.

“The Healing School of Parthenon Temple is a lot better than our Magic Association’s. If there’s still no cure there, I believe there’s no better place you can go in this world,” said Tang Zhong.

“Correct, and besides, our Parthenon Temple does not simply treat anyone... but it’s a different story if Miss Ye Xinxia is a student of our college,” said Glorkian.

“Mo Fan, Parthenon Temple is perfect for her. I know you’re worried that no one is looking after her there. If Lu Ping’s guarantee isn’t enough for you, I’ll pay a visit to Parthenon Temple with her. I have an old friend there, I can arrange for Xinxia to live with her. I believe she’s more than willing to have a girl like her to keep her company,” said Tang Zhong firmly.

As the President of Lingyin Enforcement Union, he had the responsibility to settle the dispute. After all, Glorkian was currently representing Parthenon Temple.

Parthenon Temple might be pushy since they wanted to take Xinxia away without this little devil Mo Fan’s agreement, but it was definitely something they could settle with a nice talk. They were both concerned for Xinxia’s wellbeing.

“Xinxia, what do you say?” Mo Fan asked Xinxia for her opinion since he could not make up his mind.

“How long will it take?” asked Xinxia.

“A year at least, two years at most. If your performance is just average, we’ll send you back after a year. Although we’ve invited you sincerely, we won’t let you stay for long if your results are just average. However, it’s going to be longer if your performance is impressive. That way, it will help you learn more things to a higher degree, don’t you agree?” answered Glorkian.

“Mo Fan, I suppose there’s no need to worry about her safety?” asked Tang Zhong.

“Mmm, I trust your arrangement,” Mo Fan nodded.

“Aren’t you going overseas for the training that’s going to last for more than a year? You won’t be coming back anytime soon during the training, and Ye Xinxia will be studying at Parthenon Temple College. When you return, she will almost have finished her studies, too. Maybe her legs will be healed by then. Isn’t that wonderful?” added Tang Zhong.
