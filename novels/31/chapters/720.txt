Mo Fan’s rash actions had totally disrupted Nanyu and Ai Jiangtu’s plans to engage the sea monsters cautiously.

However, they were a bunch of proud young Magicians, too. Everyone had gone through the selection process of their respective institutes and the voting process, implying that they were the best from their institutes.

Gong Yu was definitely eager to show off his talents. Mo Fan was still figuring out how to teach the annoying guy a lesson when he took the initiative to walk up to Mo Fan and challenge him. “Hey substitute, how about a bet?”

Mo Fan was not the kind to back down easily. He simply said indifferently, “Sure thing, but let’s go big or go home. I like the feeling when my heart is beating fast,”

Gong Yu smiled. He was extremely troubled when he could not think of a way to get rid of this annoying pest that kept staying close to Mu Ningxue. He immediately thought of using the fight against the Scarlet Soaring Demons to carry out his plan. To his surprise, the guy even asked for a bigger stake! He could not tell where the guy got his confidence from.

“What do you have in mind?” Gong Yu withdrew his thoughts and let Mo Fan make the decision.

“We’ll collect their gall bladders, whoever collects the most gall bladders from those creatures wins. The winner can ask the loser for a favor.” Mo Fan never ran short of wicked thoughts.

“Any favor?” emphasized Gong Yu.

“That’s right, any favor,” Mo Fan nodded.

Gong Yu was quite surprised. The stake would be extremely high if the winner could ask the loser for anything. Did that mean he would have to kill himself if that’s what Mo Fan asked?

“You know that the advisors strictly forbid infighting among ourselves. They will expel us from the national team if they know about it. Are you sure it’s any favor?” Gong Yu needed to make sure.

Gong Yu never thought Mo Fan would seize the initiative when he was the one that suggested the bet. Somehow, he already had the urge to wuss out.

“We’re teammates, of course it shouldn’t involve something too crazy, don’t you agree? Don’t worry, it’s just a harmless favor. It won’t destroy the peaceful relationship between us,” Mo Fan started to bullshit.

“Self-harm?” asked Gong Yu.

“It won’t be... say, do you still want the bet or not? Don’t ask for it if you don’t have the courage, seriously,” Mo Fan looked at Gong Yu with a mocking grin.

-Kid, your Grandpa Mo Fan is going to kick your ass!-

“Bring it on, you think I’m scared? But you must promise that it’s not going to affect our position in the national team,” said Gong Yu rationally.

Gong Yu was not stupid. The national team was their first priority now. He did not want to mess up his future just because they were rivals for Mu Ningxue’s affection.

“Definitely not, I’m still looking forward to amazing the world at the City of Canals! There’s no way I’m going to do anything stupid, but I have not been pleased with you over the past few days, so I’m going to feel unpleasant if I can’t teach you a lesson. Ai Jiangtu won’t let me pick a fight with you for sure, and that maniac’s strength is a bit too scary, I don’t think I can beat him,” said Mo Fan blatantly.

Gong Yu’s expression darkened. He had never seen such an honest asshole!

It sounded like he was any better when he saw Mo Fan sticking with Mu Ningxue like a little Chinese Shar-Pei. -Does this guy even have the dignity of a man? What difference is there between him and a street thug?-

“Alright then, I also found you annoying. Don’t blame me for being too cruel if you end up with fewer gall bladders,” Gong Yu smirked coldly.

—

The bet had begun. The person with fewer gall bladders was the loser.

The undead tribe had undead crystals that contained their life essence and energy. It was the second most valuable loot after their Soul Essences. Meanwhile, the monster tribe had their gall bladders. They could instantly kill a monster by landing their attacks on its gall bladder. The gall bladders acquired from monsters were valuable too, a favorite loot for Hunters.

As soon as the bet took place, Mo Fan and Gong Yu immediately lunged at the Scarlet Soaring Demons like mad dogs.

Gong Yu was quite the cunning type. He had already noticed a Scarlet Soaring Demon that nailed to the ground by a Giant Shadow Spike. He quickly sprinted forward with Wind Track, leaving a blurry afterimage behind. In the blink of an eye, he had already reached the Scarlet Soaring Demon whose movements were hindered by the Giant Shadow Spike... Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

His palm flickered with brown light, and hardened his arm. The effect spread from his arm to the back of his hand, where sharp claws grew out and slashed forward!

Mo Fan was surprised by the scene. Gong Yu was already using his Claw-type Magic Equipment as soon as the fight broke out. Did he really need to be so serious?

Gong Yu’s blurry figure rapidly sprang forward as he stabbed at the chest of the Scarlet Soaring Demon with his hardened claws.

The claws were half a meter long. They penetrated the Scarlet Soaring Demon’s body without any sign of resistance, its sturdy skin standing no chance against the claws. It was almost torn apart by them!

Gong Yu mercilessly pulled the sharp claws out of the monster’s body. Fresh blue blood jetted out from the wound. The Scarlet Soaring Demon trembled in extreme pain.

“How weak,” Gong Yu wore a disdainful grin. He simply stood in front of the dangerous Scarlet Soaring Demon.

The Scarlet Soaring Demon whose chest was torn a hole apart uttered a screech. It flung its sharp claws at Gong Yu, trying to tear the human into pieces!

Its upper limbs were thin, but they actually possessed remarkable strength. The claws formed a cross slashing through the thick rock in their path.

However, Gong Yu’s reaction was quicker. He had already moved to the back of the Scarlet Soaring Demon the very moment it attacked.

Gong Yu was like a phantom assassin. He purposely waited until the Scarlet Soaring Demon to turn around before he burst into grim laughter.

The claws on the gauntlet struck forward at lightning speed, penetrating the same wound again. This time, Gong Yu grabbed the gall bladder inside the Scarlet Soaring Demon and pulled it out with great force!

Gong Yu was extremely quick with his attack, his movements were like an icy flicker in the eyes of an ordinary person like Liu Meng. The next thing he knew, a gall bladder covered in blood was raised into the air.

“One!” Gong Yu smiled.

After losing the gall bladder, the Scarlet Soaring Demon would surely die in the next few seconds. Gong Yu completely ignored its dying struggles. He quickly vanished as a gust of wind circled him.

The Scarlet Soaring Demon waved its claws wildly, trying to tear the human who took its gall bladder away apart in its rage. However, it began to stagger after taking a few steps...

Soon, the Scarlet Soaring Demon fell from the rocks onto the sands. Its blue blood splattered across the place!
