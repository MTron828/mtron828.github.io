Mo Fan soon contacted the leader of the Golden Battle Hunters. Ge Ming gladly accepted him into the group.

Mo Fan learned from Ge Ming that they were not bringing everyone from the Hunter Group to the Taklamakan Desert. Mere numbers would not make a difference when they were visiting such a dangerous place. They were only choosing the elite and experienced Hunters.

The team consisted of twelve people. Ge Ming was a Super Mage, while the others were all Advanced Mages.

Mo Fan was quite relieved after hearing Ge Ming’s explanation. Bringing a huge group sounded impressive, as they could just blast every demon creature they encountered with magic. Unfortunately, the numbers of the demon creatures were in the hundreds or thousands of times the number of human mages. Even if the government sent out a whole army, it had no chance of eliminating the demon creatures in the outer part of the Taklamakan Desert, let alone a Hunter Group...

“Mu Ningxue is too busy; we’ll have to find another person to look after you,” Mo Fan said.

“I don’t need anyone to protect me, but it’s going to be difficult finding the right person. Not only does the person have to be reliable, it has to be someone we can trust, too. After all, our focus is to bring Little Flame Belle back to life, instead of searching for loot,” Lingling told him.

Mo Fan was troubled too. Mu Ningxue would be very busy during this period, so Mo Fan did not even tell her what had happened at the Parthenon Temple, as he did not want to make her worry. He did not tell her that Little Flame Belle had been reduced to a Calamity Fruit once more.

Mo Fan did not plan to bring Mu Ningxue along. She had something important to focus on, but the problem was, Mo Fan was struggling to think of someone that he could rely on.

Mo Fan tried to contact Miss Tangyue, but she seemed to be on a mission. Her phone stayed off for some time.

“Why don’t we ask Mu Nujiao?” Lingling suggested.

Mu Nujiao was trustworthy, and she was reliable too, especially now that she had received the Blessing of the God’s Seal. Her clan was more than willing to provide her with any resources she needed. She was a lot stronger than before.

“Are you sure? Asking her to go to such a dangerous place?” Mo Fan hesitated.

“Then what about Zhang Xiaohou?”

“He’s different; he’s very smart and experienced. He won’t die so easily...” Mo Fan replied awkwardly.

“Just ask her, I stumbled into her recently. She did ask me if there’s any quest. It seems she has reached a bottleneck after cultivating in seclusion for too long. She needs practical experience to improve further,” Lingling informed him.

“Mm, alright, I’ll ask her.”

—

Mo Fan was about to pick up his phone to ask Mu Nujiao if she was interested in coming along when his phone rang.

It was a unique ringtone he had set for his father, Mo Jiaxin. The man’s smiling face showed up on the screen. Mo Fan was quite surprised. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Did someone tell his father about what had happened to him and Xinxia at the Parthenon Temple? Otherwise, why would the old man call him all of a sudden?

Since he had moved to the Magic City and Xinxia had gone off to study, Mo Jiaxin was completely freed from his burdens. He did not even call for months, enjoying his life in Bo City. Many times, it was Mo Fan that had given his father a call to see how he was doing. It had been a while since the old man took the initiative to call him!

“Hello, what do you want?” Mo Fan asked casually.

“Mo Fan?” another person’s voice came from the other end.

Mo Fan immediately frowned after hearing the voice.

Even though the voice was trying to hide it, Mo Fan still identified its owner instantly. It was someone that Mo Fan hated to the guts!

“It’s you!” Mo Fan’s face immediately turned icy.

“HAHAHA, it’s quite a surprise that you can still recognize my voice...” the man on the other end burst out laughing.

“What do you want?” Mo Fan asked expressionlessly.

“What do I want? It’s all your fault that I’m in my current situation. Your father is now in my hands, do you think I will go easy on him?” the man said.

“You have only yourself to blame,” Mo Fan said.

“Sure, your father has himself to blame, too. You can come to Beiyu (North Rain) Mountain now. If you’re late... you know what I did to Xu Zhaoting!” The man’s laughter was extremely piercing.

Mo Fan felt his heart was about to explode. However, he could not afford to lose his calm, as it would make him act irrationally. Things would only worsen if he did not act calmly!

Mo Fan tried his best to calm his thoughts, even though there was a dark, blood-colored flicker in his eyes.

Mo Fan dialed Lingling’s number right away. “Lingling, my father is in danger!”

“Your father? That’s impossible, he’s at Bo City. The city is now a military fortress. The military is surely looking after your father, not allowing any danger to befall him. Is it the Black Vatican?” Lingling said.

“It’s Yu Ang: he’s not dead!” Mo Fan replied in a deep voice.

“Yu Ang? That’s even more impossible. The Black Vatican has to send a Blue Deacon or someone with a higher rank to do any harm to your father. Yu Ang is just a stray dog, he will be killed instantly if he dares to set half a foot into the city, let alone kidnapping your father. There’s something wrong; did you hear your father’s voice?”

“I did, it didn’t sound like it was recorded,” Mo Fan said.

“Head to that Beiyu Mountain that Yu Ang mentioned; I will investigate it right away. Believe me, there’s no way the Black Vatican can hurt your father. It must be a trap,” Lingling said confidently.

Mo Fan had been a pain in the arse for the Black Vatican. As such, his immediate family members were all protected by the Enforcement Union and the military. Mo Jiaxin was living in Bo City, and Bo City was currently a military fortress. It was impossible for the Black Vatican to do any harm to him, let alone Yu Ang.

“Alright, thanks!” Mo Fan said seriously.

“Mm!” Lingling said. She had rarely heard Mo Fan thanking her so seriously before. She clearly knew how important Mo Jiaxin was to him.

—

Not long after, Lingling managed to contact the military in Bo City. She soon received an update from a reliable source. She immediately relayed the information to Mo Fan so he would not lose his calm.

“So you’re saying that some organization took my father away from the military? What organization?” Mo Fan demanded.

“Yes, they said that the people followed the right protocols, but I bet someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes, since you weren’t alerted. Give me a few minutes, I will find out the organization that took Uncle Mo away,” Lingling said.

“Alright, I’m on my way to Baiyu Mountain,” Mo Fan said.

In less than five minutes, Lingling called Mo Fan again. This time, her tone obviously shifted.

“So who took my father?” Mo Fan asked.

“It’s...it’s the Enforcement Union!” Lingling replied.

“Enforcement Union? Why did the military let the Enforcement Union take my father? And how is Yu Ang right beside my father?” Mo Fan asked.

“Gramp and sister are both away. They aren’t around at such an important time, how frustrating!” Lingling snapped.

Leng Qing was the Vice Leader of the Enforcement Union. If the Enforcement Union took Mo Jiaxin away, they would have told Leng Qing about it, too. It seemed like they had skipped Leng Qing, too!

Leng Qing was not in the Magic City, while Tang Zhong was still cleaning up the mess that Mo Fan had left at the Parthenon Temple. Tangyue was away on a mission, too. The people of the Enforcement Union that Mo Fan knew were not around to help him.

“It seems like there’s something that we don’t know yet,” Mo Fan gradually calmed down.

“Mm, something must have gone wrong. There’s no way Yu Ang could kidnap Uncle Mo without alerting anyone. It’s likely that Uncle Mo is in the hands of the Enforcement Union. As for why Yu Ang is in the Enforcement Union... you will have to visit Beiyu Mountain to find out the truth, but I still think Yu Ang is just bluffing,” Lingling said.

“Alright, I got it.”

—

Mo Fan was furious even after he had learned it was the Enforcement Union who took Mo Jiaxin.

Mo Fan knew better than anyone what kind of a person Yu Ang was. Why would the people of the Enforcement Union be involved with him?

Mo Fan headed to Beiyu Mountain. Along the way, a pair of black wings approached him rapidly, hanging low under the gray clouds. Mo Fan only noticed their presence when they finally caught up to him.

“My master, you seem very angry!” The black wings spread open, revealing Bola’s face.

“Just in time; come with me to the Enforcement Union!” Mo Fan was overjoyed to see Bola.

“It seems like I have come at the right time!” Bola grinned.

“There’s no need to show any mercy,” Mo Fan said. He had zero tolerance.

Mo Fan knew the Enforcement Union had taken Mo Jiaxin through official procedures, yet he would not allow the Enforcement Union to have anything to do with a jerk like Yu Ang, especially after the scum was threatening him with his father’s life!

“That’s more like it. I don’t care if the person is righteous or evil, I won’t show any mercy to those that infuriate my master!”

Bola quickened his pace. He turned into a pair of black wings and brought Mo Fan with him as he flew toward Beiyu Mountain.

Bola had just gotten off a plane not long ago. He was looking for Mo Fan by following his scent. Somehow, he felt free in the land of the east. He was free, and his power was free too...

As for the Enforcement Union, he was not really afraid of it.

It had been a while since he had last unleashed the true power of the Blood Tribe, so long that he almost forgotten what it felt like.

He remembered he had fought an evil beast before he became a Guardian Statue at the Parthenon Temple. The fight lasted for a day and a night. In the end, he managed to kill the beast with his poisonous blood. The creature was most likely a Ruler-level creature, a savage man-eating tyrant that had ruled a mountain to the east of the Mediterranean Sea!
