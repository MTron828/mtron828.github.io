Mo Fan was left speechless by Xinxia’s mentor.

The people of Parthenon Temple should have at least given him a call regardless of how urgent they were. If they did not even bother calling him, there was no way Mo Fan would agree!

Mo Fan could not care less after learning the address. He asked Tangyue to send someone who could fly and had the flying license for Hangzhou to bring him straight to the private airfield that Lu Ping had mentioned.

The person that came did surprise him. It was his Senior Sister, Leng Qing!

Leng Qing had the Wing Magical Equipment. She lifted Mo Fan and brought him to his destination. The strong wind slapping his face made the experience significantly more realistic than flying in a plane.

“Senior Sister Leng Qing, why are you so free today?” teased Mo Fan.

“I thought something important happened, but it turns out that you’re trying to stop your little girlfriend from going overseas. If you ask me to do something like this again, I’ll toss you in the lake to feed the snake,” snapped Leng Qing unpleasantly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Come on, we’re one family, I’m no outsider... how is Lingling? It’s been a while since I last saw her, she must be missing me a lot,” said Mo Fan.

“You should be more worried about your little girlfriend. The people of Parthenon Temple have always been arrogant. Once someone catches their eyes, they will snatch the person at once, not wasting any time with others,” said Leng Qing.

“The problem is, Xinxia never agreed to it. What right do they have to take her away? Isn’t that kidnapping?” said the disgruntled Mo Fan.

“They wouldn’t care!”

“Assholes!”

Lishan...

A long airstrip extended all the way across the field that was covered in perfect green turf similar to that of a golf course, surrounded by lakes and hills.

At one end of the airstrip was a white private jet with a sun pattern on its body. The plane was moving slowly.

“I’m sorry, but we urgently need to return to Greece now. Miss Ye Xinxia, just come along. Your mentor has already agreed. We’ll notify your family later, too. I know it’s a bit of a rush, but we’ve shown you our utmost sincerity!” exclaimed a middle-aged teacher of Parthenon Temple politely.

“Mr. Glorkian, please allow me to leave if you’re in a rush. I can go back to school myself. As for going to Greece, I have to discuss it with my father and brother first,” Ye Xinxia replied firmly to the teacher of Parthenon Temple.

“We’ll let your family know. Don’t worry, if you wish, we can even send someone over to invite them to Parthenon Temple as our guests, so they will learn the greatness of the college that you’re studying in. I believe they will agree that you’ve made a wise decision. Captain, time to hit the sky. We have to reach Greece before night falls,” said Glorkian.

The man seemed polite, yet his temperament was irresistible, as if everything he said only served as a notice. There was basically no room for discussion!

“Sir, someone is in the sky ahead. They are preventing us from taking off!” said the vice-captain.

“Digaeus, go handle it. Just chase them away. If a fight breaks out here, the people of Lingyin Enforcement Union are going to trouble us,” said the blond, curly-haired Glorkian.

“Got it!”

Xinxia puckered her lips and fell silent.

She could feel that this Glorkian had no interest in listening to her. Regardless of her decision, they would still bring her away.

It was meaningless to say anything further. Xinxia was wondering why these people were in such a rush. Were they actually having some trouble, or was it because of other reasons...

“Damn, isn’t this kidnapping!

“Xinxia! Xinxia!

“Xinxia, are you on the plane?!

“Damn it, listen up, if you don’t stop the plane now, I’ll smash it into pieces!”

Still dangling in the air, Mo Fan yelled at the people in the plane.

Xinxia could hear Mo Fan’s voice, yet she did not have her phone with her and she had difficulty moving around.

When she saw the golden-haired Glorkian going into the pilot cabin, she immediately gathered her voice in her mind and transmitted to Mo Fan, “Brother Mo Fan, I’m here!”

Mo Fan was overjoyed. He blurted out, “Are they taking you away? Are you sure they are from Parthenon Temple? Why are they acting like bandits?”

“They are indeed from Parthenon Temple. The dean and teachers have already confirmed their identities. They are sincerely inviting me to Parthenon Temple College, but I don’t know why they didn’t give me time to consider the offer and have to leave in such a rush,” Xinxia soon responded.

“Don’t worry, I’m here now. They won’t take you anywhere!” said Mo Fan.

“They are very strong. Brother Mo Fan, please be careful!” said Xinxia.

“It’s fine, I have a helper too.”

While Mo Fan and Xinxia were talking through telepathy, someone had already flown out from the plane.

The man had Wind Wings on his back, implying that he was a relatively high-cultivation Wind Magician. He was hovering not far away from the plane. His light blue eyes were looking at Mo Fan and Leng Qing with a hint of disdain.

He only glanced at Mo Fan briefly. In his eyes, Mo Fan was just an insignificant character. He placed his attention on Leng Qing, as he could tell that her cultivation was fairly impressive.

“I’m Vice President Leng Qing from the Lingyin Enforcement Union. The girl on your plane, let her go,” Leng Qing revealed her identity.

Both sides were respectable and powerful. A fight between them would escalate quickly.

“I’m sorry, we don’t have time to waste here. Our classes start tomorrow. Since she is chosen, she is obliged to follow our arrangements. If you have any problems, talk to the school. We’ve already told the dean,” said Digaeus

“She didn’t agree, and her family didn’t agree either,” said Leng Qing.

“Please don’t block our plane. Otherwise, we have the right to use violence since you’re obstructing the work of personnel of Parthenon Temple. Time is precious to us,” replied Digaeus.

“Did you forget whose territory it is and who you’re talking to now? Your rules don’t apply here. You’re kidnapping a student in Hangzhou, I have the right to kill you right now!” Leng Qing did not show any mercy. She did not go easy just because she was facing people from the reputable Parthenon Temple!

“This...” Digaeus was stunned. He did not expect the other side to be so stubborn. Normally, people would leave once they used the name Parthenon Temple.

“Stop wasting time with her, blast her away!” Glorkian’s voice appeared from the pilot cabin.

Digaeus nodded. His gaze sharpened as he spoke, “Then I shall witness the strength of China’s Enforcement Union. I’ve been looking forward to this!”
