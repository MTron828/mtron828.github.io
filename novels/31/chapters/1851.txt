“Are you Tangyue, the Vice Chief of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union?” a middle-aged man in a bright armor came over. He was followed by a troop of impressive Mages.

“There are so many people in this town, yet you were able to find me right away. How impressive,” Tangyue harrumphed coldly.

“We are just taking orders. Please hand over all the information you have so it’s easier for us to eliminate the threat on Dawn Island. We are running short on time. Please don’t make trouble for us. If you interfere with our work or don’t want to cooperate with us, we will have to rely on disciplinary actions,” the Battlemage threatened with a stern look.

“Damn it, we worked so hard on Dawn Island, but these guys have come to reap what we have sown instead!” Jiang Shaojun snarled. She went up to the middle-aged man and pointed at his nose, “Leave with your men at once! Don’t be a scumbag Councilman’s lackey, or you’re going to regret it.”

“Miss Jiang, right? We respect your father, but it doesn’t mean you can disrespect us. We don’t take orders from any Councilman. We are just following the orders from our superior. If you really think a Councilman’s personal gains are involved in this operation, please submit the evidence to the Martial Court or the highest Enforcement Union to prove he’s guilty... but even if he’s guilty, as long as we don’t receive any new orders, we are obliged to follow the previous order still!” the Battlemage said righteously. His voice was as firm as steel. Jiang Shaoxu did not dare to cross the line any further.

“Jiang Shaoxu, forget it, don’t pick a fight with the military,” Zhao Manyan pulled Jiang Shaoxu to the side.

It was meaningless to argue with a bunch of soldiers who were merely following orders. What mattered more was the person giving them the orders. Who was abusing their power to try covering up the truth!?

“All the evidence will be destroyed if the town goes into lockdown for five days. How could we possibly prove the man guilty after that? Why are the people from the highest Enforcement Union so slow? They have let the military take over instead,” Tangyue spat.

“I think the people from the highest levels of the Enforcement Union are being late on purpose,” Lingling said.

Tangyue had already submitted the evidence that Zhu Qi was involved in the incident in the morning. The highest authorities of the Enforcement Union should have come on the same day, since an Enforcement Union’s chief and a Councilman were involved to validate the accusation. They would then bring Chief Zhu Qi to court and investigate Councilman Nan.

However, the investigators from the Enforcement Union had not arrived even by the second day. The military had shown up instead. It basically meant the evidence had actually ended up in Councilman Nan’s hands. He just had to keep those who knew the truth busy and arrange for the military to take charge of the matter...

There had to be people supporting Councilman Nan among the army’s division. Their benefits would also be affected if something happened to Councilman Nan.

It was not easy to overthrow a Councilman. It was not difficult to replace him with someone else, but the problem was the factions who were tied to him were in the same boat. It might be an entire province, or even the entire southeast part of the country!

“Let’s give them what they want,” Lingling said.

“But...” Tangyue was unwilling to give up.

Even though the threat on Dawn Island would still be resolved after the military took over, Tangyue felt terrible sparing the corrupted Councilman so easily. It was probably the reason she was struggling to sleep last night. The chief of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, Zhu Qi, was just a lackey. The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union was just a small branch of the Enforcement Union, but as long as it had Councilman Nan’s support, it was allowed to exist. Zhu Qi was going to be fine soon. He might even be assigned somewhere with greater benefits and power!

“Just give it to them, Dawn Island will cease to exist in five days. The evidence won’t be of any use to us, since there won’t be any way to validate it,” Lingling said.

It was unwise to oppose the military. There was nothing they could do, so they had to accept it.

“Luckily, Mo Fan was not around. Otherwise, he would seriously pick a fight with these soldiers, considering his hot temper. He wouldn’t even care if they were just taking orders. He would make them pay if he’s not happy about it,” Zhao Manyan spoke up.

Mu Bai nodded in agreement. Starting a fight with the army would definitely complicate matters!

“Thanks for your cooperation,” the Battlemage nodded when he saw Tangyue handing over the information. He waved his hand and left with his men, not troubling Tangyue and the others any further.

“Should we tell them about the Anesthetic Seaweed?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“Yeah, we should. These soldiers are going to suffer great losses if they try to reach the island with brute force. They might be taking orders from Councilman Nan, but they are still soldiers of our country. There’s no need for unnecessary casualties,” Tangyue could only sigh.

She could not punish Zhu Qi and Councilman Nan accordingly, but it was inappropriate to vent her frustrations on the Battlemages. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Mm, I’ll tell them,” Mu Bai agreed.

Mu Bai caught up to the middle-aged commander and told him about the Anesthetic Seaweed he had scattered on the seabed.

To his relief, the officer was not the stubborn kind. He decided to accept their suggestion after hearing they had figured out a perfect plan to wipe the Manta Ray Evil Birds off of Dawn Island.

“It’s not too bad since we still managed to eliminate the threat,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“We did get what we came for. As for that Councilman Nan, someone will take care of him eventually,” Zhao Manyan said.

Tangyue’s initial goal was to eliminate the threat of Dawn Island and guarantee Wanggui Town’s safety. The Manta Ray Evil Birds would be wiped out soon, meaning that she had accomplished her mission.

Zhao Manyan had also found the Totem Beast he came for. He had acquired the clue that would lead them to the next Totem Beast from the Totem Seal. He was looking forward to achieving the Super Level much more than taking down a black-hearted Councilman. As long as he was strong enough, even a Councilman was only worthy to wipe his shoes clean!

“Speaking of which, where is the election that Councilman Nan is participating in? I don’t recall any elections for important roles along the coastline. Could it be Feiniao City?” Jiang Shaoxu asked after she had a sudden thought.

“Feiniao City has already elected a Great Councilman. It’s not him,” Mu Bai said confidently. He had already seen the list of Councilmen when he was appointed the chief of the South Wing Platoon. He did not see Councilman Nan’s name on it.

“It’s a new capital inland. It will have a lot of influence and power in the future,” Tangyue said.
