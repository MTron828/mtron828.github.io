Despite being disappointed, what happened had clearly crossed Mo Fan’s bottom line. He had decided to take matters into his own hands.

He could not care less about the truth behind the incident or how many superiors of the Guild of the Wicked were involved. He only wanted to put an end to everything!

It was stupid to leave a malignant tumor inside a person’s body and let it worsen just because it was close to their vital organs. It was necessary to remove the tumor, despite the risks involved. Otherwise, the whole body would eventually rot until it was beyond redemption.

Crete Military Academy was the cradle of many outstanding officers from Greece, but Mo Fan’s heart had gone cold when he saw Babbitt trying to seek shelter there.

Why couldn’t it be a den of thieves? Why did it have to be such a sacred and authoritative place?

Most people, including the Holy Court Mages, would simply turn back if they followed the clues to the entrance of a military academy.

They could not afford to cross the entrance, as it would mean going against their own people.

Fortunately, Mo Fan was not representing any organization. He was not from the International Military Tribunal, the government, the Parthenon Temple, or the Holy Judgment Court. He was here on behalf of himself.

Only the International Military Tribunal had the right to condemn a military academy, but since Mo Fan did not belong to any organization, he could just do whatever he pleased without restrictions.

“Hold it right there!” The guards stopped Mo Fan at the entrance.

Mo Fan did not stop. He pointed at Babbitt, who had just gone inside not long ago, “Why did you stop me if you could invite him in?”

“Mr. Babbitt is the president of Crete’s Merchant Guild. He has serious business with our chief. Enough talk! Tell us who you are, or leave at once!” the guard demanded.

The guard was an officer. Normally, his men would be watching the entrance, but he occasionally checked on his men.

“I see, but he’s from the Black Ornaments of the Guild of the Wicked. They refer to him as the Black Wrist. Here is a recording of him admitting it in person. Here is also some information that proves he’s involved with the Guild of the Wicked.” Mo Fan took out his phone and showed the officer the evidence.

The officer was startled.

He did not doubt Babbitt’s identity. He was only wondering if the young man before him was out of his mind.

“I’m only in charge of the military academy’s safety. Why are you showing this to me? You should show them to the military tribunal instead,” the officer answered.

“I came to take him down, so could you let me in?” Mo Fan asked.

“Are you out of your mind? I don’t care if he has a secret identity, but for now he’s Mr. Babbitt, who is working closely with our Secretary! He has permission to enter the military academy, unlike you. Do you understand?!” the officer snarled.

“So you do admit that your boss has colluded with a member of the Black Ornaments, but you don’t have the power to judge them. That being said, you do have the power to let me in so I can settle them,” Mo Fan said.

The officer was dumbfounded. Where did this maniac come from?

“How dare you slander our Secretary! Leave at once, or I’ll arrest you on the spot. Slandering a flag officer, that’s five years’ worth of jail time for you!” The officer sounded very angry.

“(Sigh), if it wasn’t for the banner that said this is a military academy, I wouldn’t even bother wasting my time with you,” Mo Fan replied.

Many people in his country kept calling him a lunatic, demon king, bearer of ill luck, troublemaker, or a god of disaster.

Seriously, he was trying to be reasonable here!

He had shown the officer evidence and asked the officer to let him in nicely. He was almost as polite and humble as an outstanding politician.

Despite his efforts, the officer did not want to listen to him. It was a military academy, not a secret military base. It was not against the rules to let a Mage in. Besides, he had already shown the fool the recording. He had clearly heard Babbitt admit he was a Black Ornament from the Guild of the Wicked!

It was not like Mo Fan did not try to change his wild behavior, but there were too many bitchy people in this society that deserved a beating!

Mo Fan gathered his Will on his right foot in a layer of steel before the officer could react. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He picked up momentum with the Space Element and kicked the gate down before flying towards the training grounds.

The alarm rang out immediately. The military academy was unlike normal organizations. They were very quick to react!

Many people in military uniforms came running in from from all directions. When they reached the training ground, they saw Mo Fan, the guards who were on duty, and the officer with a relatively high rank.

“Mo Fan?” General Jessica came over when she heard the racket. She recognized Mo Fan instantly.

“General Jessica, you are here too? What a coincidence!” Mo Fan greeted her with a smile.

The officer climbed to his feet and yelled, “This assh*** is trying to break into the military academy by force. He has broken the rules of our country! I order you to execute him on the spot!”

Around eighty Battlemages had gathered around the training ground. They were part of the patrol platoon assigned to deal with situations like this.

The soldiers started Casting their spells even though the man seemed to know General Jessica.

Most of the soldiers were Intermediate Mages using Intermediate Spells. The combination of eighty spells was like a terrifying magic storm.

“Stop it, stop it right now!” General Jessica yelled.

General Jessica might have graduated from the military academy, but her current role was mainly at the front line. The Secretary was in charge of everyone in the military academy, so they were not in her chain of command.

“Time Stasis!”

Mo Fan stood in the center of the storm, and casually waved his hand. The spells approaching him immediately froze. Those watching could only tell the spells were moving by a small margin after watching them closely.

However, the spells could only last for a certain period of time. They soon dissipated into the air.

The magic storm looming over Mo Fan quickly disappeared under the power of his Time Stasis.

Unharmed, Mo Fan stood in front of the officer and demanded of him, “Why didn’t you follow the normal routine? Shouldn’t you arrest me first? Why did you ask them to execute me on the spot? Do you really want to kill me so badly? Are you afraid that the others might hear the recording and see the evidence? Does that mean you have colluded with the Guild of the Wicked too?”
