“Listen up, you only need to beat the crap out of that guy, don’t cross the line. Otherwise, someone might make a huge fuss about it and put the blame on me,” Prince Beny said to Frank, a representative of the Spanish team, in a soft voice.

Although Frank had grown up with the royal family of Spain, he did not inherit the bloodline of the royal family. He was only adopted by the family, and although Prince Beny and Frank were like brothers on the surface, many people knew that Frank was Prince Beny’s subordinate, and was usually responsible for doing inhumane acts on behalf of Prince Beny.

“Don’t worry, I won’t go easy on someone like him!” Frank said seriously.

The representatives stood in their positions, waiting for the judge to declare the start of the match.

The spectator seats surrounding the stage were rather special. Most of them were a platform supported by a pillar, scattered across the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground at varied heights. As a result, the cheers of the crowd sounded like a wave!

Initially, everyone thought the Earth Mages would have an advantage in the match because of how the stage was set up. It was obvious that the mounds scattered across the place would be useful for those with the Earth Element. However, just as the match was about to begin, the officials did something to make the dueling ground even more stunning!

Ten Water Mages stood at the boundary of the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground. They cast Rolling Waves simultaneously, pouring water into the dueling ground.

Within an instant, it was like ten waterfalls poured into the dueling ground from the boundary. The crowd was left in awe at the spectacular view.

The water gradually rose, and a few of the shorter mounds were totally covered by it.

The water continued to rise, and not long after, the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground that initially consisted of jagged, rocky mounds had turned into a lake. The participants had no place to set their feet down, apart from the pointy, mountain peaks! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This is bad!” Mo Fan scowled.

If it was just an ordinary stage, Mo Fan was fairly confident that he could defeat the Spanish team, as it was unlikely they would send out all their best members knowing that they had more strong opponents to face later in the tournament.

But to his surprise, the stage had suddenly turned into a lake. Fortunately, there was still limited ground for him to move around. If the whole stage was covered in water, a non-swimmer like Mo Fan would simply be done for!

“It has suddenly turned into a marine battlefield. Mo Fan isn’t good at fighting underwater. The situation isn’t in our favor, right from the start,” Jiang Yu said.

“Not only is the environment unfavorable to him, even his teammates are unfavorable to him.”

“You’re right, both Zu Jiming and Nanrong Ni have conflicts with Mo Fan. It’s up to Nanyu on how she’s going to convince them to focus on the match.”

“Don’t forget there’s Zhao Manyan too. Even though he isn’t participating in the match, he already gave Mo Fan a huge blow right to the head.”

The main judge signaled the participants to enter the stage!

The matches in Venice were all team battles, with the standard five-versus-five format.

The representatives of the Chinese team were Mo Fan, Nanyu, Jiang Shaoxu, Nanrong Ni, and Zu Jiming. From what the team could tell, it was basically a formation of four supports and one carry!

Mo Fan was utterly clueless about what old Feng Li was thinking. Both Nanyu and Jiang Shaoxu were Mages without outstanding offensive abilities, and together with Zu Jiming and Nanrong Ni, he basically was the only damage output on their team!

As for the Spanish team, for some reason, Mo Fan had a feeling that the environment of the stage was in their favor, as he could see faint grins on their faces while the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground was turning into a lake.

“Spain is a maritime country, so many of their Mages are likely to be experts of the Water Element. Even those without the Water Element will know how to utilize the environment to their favor, so it doesn’t really look good for us,” Nanyu observed.

“Let’s just try our best,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“Mo Fan, did you see the person with curly blue hair?” Nanyu said.

“Yeah, why?” Mo Fan replied.

“He’s Frank, one of the strongest members of the Spanish team. He takes orders from Prince Beny, so you should look out for him.”

“Got it!”

——

After the main judge’s declaration, the magic battle between China and Spain officially began.

The Spanish team was clearly more experienced at fighting in water, as they thought. At least three of their opponents had the Water Element, and with the readily available supply of water around, they totally felt at home casting Water Spells.

The spiked mounds were Mo Fan’s only relief. However, the Spanish team was quite cunning. They seemed to assume that most members of the Chinese team did not have the Water Element. As soon as the match started, they immediately summoned fierce tides, trying to destroy as many of the mountains as possible!

Nanyu began to panic when she saw the mountains where they could set their feet on starting to sink and submerge into the lake.

Mo Fan was the core of their team. If a non-swimmer like him had nowhere to stand, they would basically lose the match!

“We can’t let them destroy the Dragon Fangs, stop them!” Nanyu said.

“How can we possibly stop them? It’s not like they are attacking us, they are aiming for the rocks, as if we can stop that...” Zu Jiming said.

“A bunch of assholes, if that’s what they want, I won’t go easy on them!” Mo Fan was infuriated too!

He was currently carrying a debt of two hundred million. Apart from the fury burning in his chest, the thought of the debt served as a great motivation to him. Seeing the Spanish team trying to pull a dirty trick on them, he immediately connected the Star Orbits into Star Patterns, which eventually combined into a Star Constellation...

If they were so interested in hitting the rocks, he would simply blast them to death!

“Sky-Flame Funeral!”

Mo Fan was the kind that would go all out even with the slightest disagreement. The fiery clouds rose high up in the air, before flames started pouring down rapidly where the Spanish team was.

The flames set the surface of the lake aflame, turning it into a blazing red sea of flames.

The Spanish team was no longer in the mood to destroy the Dragon Fangs when their lives were being threatened by the raging flames. They quickly summoned rolling tides and rain to put out Mo Fan’s flames.

“It seems like a person of their team has gone missing?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

Mo Fan quickly cast a glance at them. One of the members of the Spanish team had indeed disappeared after the first wave of attacks.

It was obvious that the person who had disappeared must be an expert underwater. They must be sneaking up to the team from underwater.

Nanyu moved her ear closer to the water and focused.

She blurted out suddenly, her face startled, “There’s an undercurrent coming from below us, brace yourselves!”

Not long after Nanyu’s warning, the water under them started to flow in a strange manner.

The water deep under the surface started to spin, dragging the water above it. Not long after, a whirlpool gradually took shape. It was like a giant beast in the lake, with its giant mouth located right under the five of them!

The water started to spin quicker, smashing some of the weaker Dragon Fangs nearby into pieces. Mo Fan glanced downward and saw a vague figure at the center of the whirlpool, waving his hands around and controlling the water.

Clearly, the attack was not as simple as a giant whirlpool. The man was trying to drown them! The opening gap was slowly rising, aiming to devour them all!

“They are trying to separate us, we can’t let them get their way!” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“You guys will have to come up with a plan, my magic isn’t useful in this situation,” Zu Jiming said.

Nanyu had already closed her eyes. Her short hair was disheveled in the strong wind and the watery mist.

A vigorous sonic wave penetrated the spinning wave, and as it crashed into the rapid current, the whirlpool started to twist in a strange manner!

Following that, the formidable whirlpool collapsed, water rising high up into the sky, reaching a over a few dozen meters high.

The sonic wave not only shattered the current, but it reached all the way to where the Spanish Mage was, producing a loud buzz that made his ears ring and his head shake!

The Water Mage did not stand a chance against Nanyu’s Sound Element. He immediately fled toward his team, not daring to stir up any trouble further underwater.

Nanyu did not plan to let him go. She flicked her finger and fired a sonic wave through the water. It shot deep into the water, like a long string!

The sonic wave lashed forward like a whip in the water. Nanyu flicked her fingers continuously, firing more strings into the water. It looked like the lake was about to split in half by the strings.

The water splashed wildly as the strings whipped the Water Mage continuously. The Spanish member did not expect to find an expert of the Sound Element on the enemy team. The water had no chance of stopping her Sound Spells, which landed on him mercilessly.

When the Spanish member was finally out of the range of Nanyu’s spells, his armor was already damaged beyond recognition!

—

“A Sound Mage!” Frank squinted as he stared at Nanyu in the distance.

It was rare to find a Sound Mage in Europe. As a matter of fact, a Sound Mage was incredibly rare in any country in the world. If Prince Beny had not ordered Frank to deal with someone specifically, he was quite interested in dueling the rare Sound Mage!

“Just hide underwater and don’t attack so recklessly again. Wait for us to create a great opening for you,” Frank said to the Water Mage.

“I won’t dare stay underwater if we don’t take care of that Sound Mage first,” the Water Mage said helplessly.

“Don’t worry, she won’t be staying in this match for long!” Frank grinned. Those who were familiar with him knew that it meant he was starting to make his move!
