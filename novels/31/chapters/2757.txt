Chapter 2758: The Three Greatest Totem Beasts Reunited

When they arrived at the sky of the West Lake, Mo Fan asked the Green East Sea God if it had any transformational skills. It would be eye-catching if such an enormous creature appeared in the West Lake suddenly.

Unfortunately, the Green East Sea God did not have any. Moon Moth Phoenix transformed into a small moth and stood on Mo Fan’s shoulder.

Mo Fan was out of solutions. So, he let the Green East Sea God land tentatively on the Su Causeway.

The Green East Sea God’s claws were as big as the willow at the Su Causeway. Having it land on the Su Causeway was like having a whale swim in a pond.

Splash!

The lake water shook. An enormous black figure from the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon was swimming toward them at a breakneck speed. The water splashed out of the lake and sprayed all over the Su Causeway. Even the toughest willow almost broke with the force.

The Su Causeway was almost submerged. The Green East Sea God’s claws were soaked in the water. It did not fly away. Instead, its eyes flashed with lightning and focused on the lake water.

Song Feiyao sucked in a deep breath. There was something huge inside that lake. It radiated a frightening and threatening aura by swimming towards them alone.

Its aura was not inferior to that of the Green East Sea God. In fact, it felt even more imposing than the Green East Sea God. Green East Sea God had been chained with lightning chains for many years, and its soul energy was still weak. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Big guy don’t scare them. This is the Green East Sea God, it shares the same lineage as the Moon Moth Phoenix,” Mo Fan said, facing the moving lake water.

The huge ripples in the lake water gradually spread on both sides. The creature that had been moving aggressively under the water slowed down and swam toward the Su Causeway much more gently.

An enormous snake head appeared from the lake water and slowly rose to the Green East Sea God’s eye level.

Unlike Apas, the Black Totem Snake was not afraid of the Green East Sea God at all. The Black Totem Snake had only shown its head and neck, and it was already the same height as the Green East Sea God. The Black Totem Snake was still half submerged under water. Its body was long and curled terrifyingly in the reflection.

......

“What is it…?”

A bird’s shadow slid across the water surface before landing on the Black Totem Snake’s head. A black figure revealed itself.

It was a woman in a rose trench coat. She looked elegant and dignified. She wore the Enforcement Union’s leather uniform under her trench coat.

“Ms. Ms. Tangyue, it’s been a while. I’ve brought you a living totem beast. Its Totem Guardian seldom ventures outside, and she doesn’t quite trust my words,” said Mo Fan with a smile.”Besides, I hope we can discuss the current totem beasts in order to search for the next Sacred Totem Beast.”

“I-I’m not a Totem Guardian.” Song Feiyao said quickly.

“Regardless, the Green East Sea God trusts you alone. You have formed a bond with it,” said Mo Fan. “I don’t think it will follow anyone else except you. You can get to know Ms. Tangyue. She’s nice.”

Since ancient times, women’s holiness and compassion easily attracted totem beasts. The Moon Moth Phoenix, the Green East Sea God, and the Black Totem Snake’s guardians were all women.

Of course, not all totem beasts chose women as their guardians. For instance, Zhao Manyan was the Totem Guardian for the Black Totem Turtle.

The three women introduced themselves to one another. Song Feiyao seemed to be less suspicious of everything now. She turned to Mo Fan. “Are you also a Totem Guardian?”

“I am not very sure,” said Mo Fan. “My totem beast lives here.” He pointed to his chest.

The Chongming Divine Bird could be reborn from ashes. It was a rare immortal totem beast in this world. However, it turned into Mo Fan’s heart in order to save his life.

The totem beast lived within Mo Fan’s heart. Perhaps the Chongming Divine Bird would transform into a red stone and wait for its next rebirth after he died.

“When the King Skeleton attacked Shanghai Base City, Mo Fan killed the King Skeleton with the help of the Chongming Divine Bird…” Ms. Tangyue explained to Song Feiyao.

Song Feiyao had left Licheng Afterglow Island a long time ago. But she only wandered around the Licheng City area and was unaware of the happenings of the world.

‘So, he is the one who killed the King Skeleton?’ thought Song Feiyao, looking at Mo Fan in a completely new way. No wonder he could overthrow the whole of Licheng Afterglow Island alone.

“The Chongming Divine Bird…” Song Feiyao mumbled to herself. She had never seen other totem beasts in her life until now. She realized that Mo Fan was telling the truth.

She knew nothing about the totem beasts. She felt fortunate to have saved the Green East Sea God. He had been nearly destroyed by her elders.

“The Black Totem Snake, Black Totem Turtle, Moon Moth Phoenix, Green East Sea God, Chongming Divine Bird, Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger, Aofu, Divine Deer… Also, Jiang Shaojun has collected the remnants of extinct totem beasts—The Seal of Totem Beast. I wonder if all these are sufficient to fill up the entire totem beast blueprint to find the next one,” Mo Fan said.

How many totem beasts were still alive in this world? How did the totem beasts defeat the powerful Ocean Godly Horde back then? They still had a very long way to go to find out.

Even though the Black Totem Snake, Black Totem Turtle, and Green East Sea God were of the level of the Supreme Ruler and were able to face the war by themselves, the Emperor-level Ocean Demons were the ones that caused the whole country on the East Coastline to struggle.

Mo Fan had once witnessed the mastermind behind the war—The Black Claw Emperor. Even the Black Snake Totem, Black Totem Turtle, Green East Sea God, and other similar totem beasts were no match for it.

They had to find one of the Sacred Totem Beasts. Otherwise, they could not possibly improve their current desperate situation.

Even Aofu, one of the Dark Tortoise lineage totem beasts, had its remains left under the sea. It would be difficult to expect the appearance of another Dark Tortoise totem beast this soon.

White Tiger totem beast was the rarest. Mo Fan and his group dared not enter Kunlun Ancestor Tiger. Finding a complete White Tiger totem beast was a major concern for them.

If the mysterious feather belonged to a Sacred Totem Beast, did that mean that the Maple Leave Divine Feather scattered at Lan Yang City suggested that it had died long ago, or did it mean it was still alive in some other way in some part of the world? They were still missing a piece related to the mysterious sacred totem beast feather of this lineage.

There was also the Cloud Ancestor Snake that overrode the Black Totem Snake. What were the other totem beasts that were related to the Cloud Ancestor Snake?

“Mo Fan, do you plan to find one of the Sacred Totem Beasts?” Ms. Tangyue was aware of Mo Fan’s purpose of gathering the totem beasts together.

“Without the Sacred Totem Beasts, we can’t change anything in the war against the Ocean Godly Horde,” said Mo Fan.
