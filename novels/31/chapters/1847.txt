Mo Fan remembered the first time he had marveled at a Super Spell. It was back at the West Lake in Hangzhou. Zhu Meng had greatly enlarged his Super Lightning Spell with the help of the Royal Guards. The Seal of Nine Laws he had established on the lake had been enough to shake an entire city. The light of the nine lightning halberds shone down upon the surface of the West Lake and the towering Black Totem Snake that had been trapped in the formation.

Now, he was using that very same spell. He was extremely pleased when he saw Zhu Qi struggling in pain within the Seal of the Nine Laws.

This was the strength of a Super Spell. Even the Chief of an Enforcement Union branch had to kneel before him! It felt like his magic was no longer the same from today forward. It was truly able to destroy everything. It was no longer tiny; its power could easily make a person feel minuscule!

The enormous lightning Formation lasted for a long time. Zhu Qi was in a very weak state after being tortured by lightning strikes, scorched completely black. He was currently on his knees, supporting himself with his trembling hands, trying to stop himself from falling to the ground.

“You...you piece of...” Zhu Qi was both furious and humiliated. He totally believed his cultivation was stronger than the younger Mage. He could easily crush the younger man with a single Super Spell!

However, he had lost to some weird spell. Every time he was about to cast a Super Spell, he would be whipped on the back, leaving him in immense pain. Otherwise, he would have long defeated the arrogant younger man!

Zhu Qi was not willing to admit his defeat. He could tell that Mo Fan had only learned the Super Spell recently. He was not even that adept with the spell, but it was a typical battle between Super Mages. Had Zhu Qi cast the Demon Judgment Sword successfully, the outcome would have been the opposite!

“Didn’t you want to know what power I used to interrupt your Super Spells?” Mo Fan approached Zhu Qi and glanced down at the man, who looked like a dying old dog.

Zhu Qi lifted his head. His eyes were brimming with anger.

Before Mo Fan could answer, the cursed whip struck Zhu Qi in the same spot once again. Zhu Qi acted like he was never going to surrender, but his face contorted in pain as soon as the whip landed on his back. At the same time, the shocks from the Lightning Magic were still torturing him on the inside. He was rolling on the ground as the two kinds of pain stacked up.

“Don’t worry, it seems like my Evil Caning Spirit is pretty fond of you. I believe it will slowly entertain you with all kinds of tricks,” Mo Fan observed.

The rest of the enforcers were no threat after Zhu Qi was taken care of. The enforcers did not want to fall out with Tangyue, either. They completely lost their will to fight when they saw Mo Fan return with their helpless chief.

“Mo Fan, did you do something crazy again?” Zhao Manyan gasped.

“Shut up if you can’t speak properly,” Mo Fan snapped.

Tangyue was overjoyed when she saw Mo Fan.

Both Mu Bai and Mo Fan were her former students. They were absolute beginners back in Bo City, but they had become Super Mages now. Mo Fan’s strength was even crazier. Even Zhu Qi had lost to him!

The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union might be slacking a lot, yet there was no doubt about its Chief’s strength. It was quite ridiculous that Mo Fan had managed to defeat Zhu Qi on his own!

“I thought you were only going to lure him away?” Mu Bai glanced at the Chief, who was in a pitiful state.

“I was going to do that, but he’s an unlucky man,” Mo Fan smiled.

As a matter of fact, if it weren’t for those crucial whips from the Evil Caning Spirit, Mo Fan would not have stood a chance against Zhu Qi.

Zhu Qi was using his Super Spells right from the beginning of the fight. Meanwhile, Mo Fan had just set foot into the Super Level. He was already performing outside his own expectations when he managed to construct a Star Palace successfully. If he was asked to cast the Super Spell again, the Star Palace might collapse right away!

Whether it was luck or overperformance, Mo Fan was finally able to take on a Super Mage!

That being said, it would be even more perfect if he could actually control the Evil Caning Spirit. Even a Super Mage had failed to defend himself from the powerful Curse Magic!

“By the way, Old Zhao, the thing you are looking for is underwater,” Mo Fan informed him.

“Are you sure?” Zhao Manyan’s eyes glittered.

“But it’s a bit old... I’m not sure if it’s going to be of any help to you,” Mo Fan added.

The huge corpse at the bottom of the sea had already turned into the seabed that was supporting the whole island. Mo Fan was still amazed as he recalled the sight. He believed only the ancient mystical Totem Beasts could grow to a size like that.

Mo Fan did not discover a Totem Seal among the remains. It would take him a lot of time to look for one underwater. Besides, Mo Fan could not keep spoon-feeding Zhao Manyan, either. He had not even done anything useful. He should be looking for the Totem Seal himself!

“We’ll wait until it’s dark and let Mu Bai lower the temperature of the water. We can then leave this island,” Tangyue said.

“I afraid I can’t wait that long,” Mo Fan blurted out.

He still had no idea how long Evil Star could hang on for, even though Mu Bai had frozen its injuries. Mo Fan was worried that it could not make it.

“Either way, we still have to wait until it’s dark. How are we supposed to fend off so many Featherless Birds while guarding the water?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“I have no other choice,” Mo Fan said.

“Mo Fan, are you seriously considering breaking through with force? I’m telling you, the number of Featherless Birds underwater is many times the number of Featherless Birds on this island. Besides, you have nowhere to stand in the ocean. It will hinder your strength. You are going to get yourself killed too!” Zhao Manyan said.

“There’s no time to wait. I’m saving this bird,” Mo Fan stated firmly.

Mo Fan was well aware of the Bird Emperor’s condition. Every minute they wasted was bringing the Bird Emperor a step closer to death.

“Damn it, can you at least figure out a plan instead of blindly rushing ahead? How about this: Mu Bai will make a floating ice platform while I handle the defense underwater. Miss Tangyue will handle the creatures coming from the sky while Mu Bai looks out for our rear. You will focus on clearing a path for us with brute force,” Zhao Manyan said.

“I can do it myself. It’s safer if the rest of you wait until it’s dark,” Mo Fan said.

“Nonsense, just do as I say!”

“You’re leaving the Totem Beast behind?”

“We’ll save your bird first. Didn’t you say it’s already a corpse? Are you telling me it’s going to run away!?”
