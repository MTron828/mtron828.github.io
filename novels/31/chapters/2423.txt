Chapter 2424: Ice Phoenix, One of the Strongest Talents

The dueling ground’s altitude was high enough for snow to be falling on it. The sky was gray and free of clouds, tiny snow particles falling from it like white sand.

A woman was already standing in the dueling ground. She was wearing a luxurious emerald green long robe with a mink-hooded windbreaker draped over her shoulders.

The woman was Mu Yinfeng. She was waiting for Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue’s hair was already silver-white. The traces of snow on her hair did not look out of place, and were sparkling like crystals.

“The disciples of the Mu Clan are scattered across the country. The clan will never run short of great talents or rising stars.” Mu Yinfeng was pacing back and forth. Her antique embroidered shoes left faint footprints on the ground as she gradually raised her voice. “Why do you think of yourself as someone unique and special? Do you really think your Innate Talent is that powerful?”

Mages with Innate Talents were the minority, but there was still a difference in strength between their Innate Talents.

“The Ice Phoenix, second on the Innate Talents Ranking,” Mu Ningxue answered calmly, calling out Yinfeng’s Talent.

Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng both had extraordinary Ice Innate Talents. That fact alone made them irreplaceably powerful Mages.

It was the reason why the two of them had retained their superior status in the Mu Clan, even when their cultivation had not reached the peak of the Super Level.

The Mu Clan had high hopes in their Innate Talents, the Ice Luan and the Ice Phoenix. Mages opposing them of the same level might lose the fight before they could make their moves!

Not only did they grow up with golden spoons in their mouths, they also possessed extraordinary Ice Innate Talents that many people wanted.

As a result, Mu Yinfeng had not lost a fight against any Ice Mage in recent years. Even the Ice Mages of some ancient clans from foreign countries did not stand a chance against her.

Mu Yinfeng was not too surprised that Mu Ningxue was able to defeat Hou Ze.

Mu Ningxue’s Innate Soul Seed was unmatchable on its own, while Hou Ze had nothing.

However, the situation was different if Mu Yinfeng were to fight Mu Ningxue.

Mu Yinfeng’s Innate Talent could easily be regarded as the strongest, if the late Qin Yu’er was excluded from the comparison.

The outcome of the duel was too obvious.

“I believe you still aren’t sure about the details of everything that happened in the past. I have some time to spare today. I can explain them all to you, especially things about your mother…” Mu Yinfeng grinned coldly.

“Such a similar event, your arrogant mother also challenged me here, but after suffering a humiliating defeat, I exiled her to the mountain in the south for her to die in grief and sorrow, and today, it’s your turn…”

Mu Yinfeng was still walking back and forth, not even looking at Mu Ningxue. She kept talking to herself.

“Sometimes, I feel sorry for you for having such a useless mother. I can imagine how wronged she felt and how much she wanted to come back here, but sadly, she was just a cripple. She could only place all her hopes on you. She was strict on you so you could be stronger and reclaim the things she had lost… the things she couldn’t take back herself.

“And neither will you! No woman dares to stand opposite me in the Mu Clan!”

“I went too easy on you and your mother in the past. This time, I’ll make sure I kill you over and over again!”

Silver wings made of ice feathers erupted from Mu Yinfeng’s back. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She went from a delicate woman to an imperious empress by just changing the look in her eyes.

Her eyes were full of disdain and murderous intent. A cold chime exploded in Mu Ningxue’s head.

She felt dizzy, as if an icicle was stabbing her bones!

Mu Yinfeng did not feel like a human. She was more like a phoenix about to take off into the Nine Heavens, and bring a bloodbath upon the land!

Mu Ningxue rubbed her temples. The screeching cry was still echoing in her mind, leaving her in great pain.

However, Mu Yinfeng was already diving at her!

The phoenix was a greater ruler of the sky than eagles, but Mu Ningxue was as vulnerable as a rabbit. The dive was deadly!

“Ice Wing Crystals!”

Mu Yinfeng picked up her speed and flew at Mu Ningxue like a silver ray.

She flung the sharp-feathered ice wings forward. The wind they produced was chilly and bone-piercing, and instantly covered a distance of half a kilometer!

Mu Ningxue’s mind was still in a mess. She had no choice but to back away, but the area covered by the powerful wind was utterly shocking. She failed to escape from Mu Yinfeng’s ability, even with Wind Trace.

“Heavenly Phoenix Scattering Feathers!”

Mu Yinfeng soared into the sky. Her figure looked tiny, but her magnificent phoenix wings were extremely clear.

She fully extended her wings, and the sharp silver feathers started falling from the sky. The dense feathers even left silver trails in the gray sky, like they were tiny white raindrops.

Mu Ningxue did not have any chance to catch her breath. The feathers falling from the sky were deadly. Not only could they puncture the rocks, they landed around her like ice needles.

Mu Ningxue did not have a spot to step on because of the ice needles. She had no choice but to fly into the sky.

Her Wind Wings provided Mu Ningxue with a layer of protection. The feathers were bouncing off them with metallic chimes.

“Down you go, you only have the right to crawl on the floor!” Mu Yinfeng opened her mouth and let out a piercing screech.

It was the same Wind Cry. It entered Mu Ningxue’s head and attacked her mind.

Her Wind Wings disappeared under the influence of the Wind Cry. Mu Ningxue started falling from a hundred meters in the sky.

The bed of needles formed by the sharp feathers was right beneath her. It would hurt her badly if she fell right on top of the needles.

In the nick of time, the ring on Mu Ningxue’s hand emitted a blue light. A special barrier wrapped around Mu Ningxue like a bubble. Not only did it absorb the impact of her falling to the ground, it also kept the needles away.

“Nice one, aunt, she had to use the Ring of Venice so quickly!” Nanrong Ni blurted out with a smile. She was standing a great distance away from the battle.

Mu Ningxue had obtained the Ring of Venice from the World College Tournament. It was like a one-time protective talisman that would be activated when her life was in danger. Nanrong Ni naturally knew about it all along.

Mu Ningxue had to use the Ring of Venice when the fight had only just begun. She would no longer stay unharmed if the same sequence happened again!

“Ningxue, you say you don’t like red, but I’m afraid you will have to wear a bright red outfit today. Didn’t people always say you are beautiful regardless of what you wear? I bet you can handle a red outfit too!” Nanrong Ni mocked her.
