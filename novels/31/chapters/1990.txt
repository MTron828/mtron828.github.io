Chapter 1992: The Predator in White

Translated by XephiZ

Mu Ningxue stared at the pine trees. A woman with her hair in a braid from the seventh team was walking toward them, intending to pluck a Lantern Fruit from them.

The Lantern Fruits of the Alpine Level were utterly delicious. The mercenaries had been stuck eating dried food, so the Lantern Fruits were obviously more appealing to their stomach.

“Don’t go over there!” Mu Ningxue yelled at the braided woman.

The woman looked at Mu Ningxue and grinned disdainfully. She purposely took a huge step toward the Lantern Fruits and plucked one. She took a huge bite on it to assert her ownership of it!

The same rustling sound occurred again. Even though Mu Ningxue could not see a thing, she knew something was hiding nearby.

As she thought, a very quick white blur suddenly jumped out from the pines.

The white figure pinned the female mercenary to the ground in the blink of an eye. It bit down on her shoulder and jumped onto a tree that was growing out of a wall, carrying the screaming woman with it.

The white creature jumped again after landing on the tree, hopping to a rock that was sticking out of a cliff. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The others nearby finally realized what was going on. They immediately looked up, yet they could only see the bottom of the cliff. They did not see the white creature, nor could they see the woman being carried away!

“They are above the cliff!” Mu Ningxue shouted.

However, the mercenaries nearby were not that strong. Their speed was nowhere close to that of the white creature.

Mu Ningxue told the Flying Creek Snow Wolf, “Take care of Lingling.” A gust of wind circled Mu Ningxue and lifted her up.

She stopped briefly when she was around twenty meters up, a pair of elegant white wings spreading on her back. They were made up of milky-white lines of wind, and were quite noble and spectacular.

Mu Ningxue beat her wings and launched herself further into the sky, nearly rising above the cliffs on both sides.

She immediately scanned the cliffs from above and noticed the white creature moving rapidly on the irregular terrain. It was climbing, bouncing between walls, and sprinting across the ground at times.

“Such an agile creature!” Mu Ningxue was surprised by the creature’s speed.

The area had a lot of huge pine trees. Mu Ningxue would not even notice where the creature was going if it weren’t for the needles that were being swept into the air.

The wings on her back beat once. The Wind Wings suddenly turned into propellers that pushed Mu Ningxue a few hundred meters away in an instant.

Unfortunately, she soon noticed the white creature disappearing into a cluster of boulders. She was unable to tell where it had gone from her angle.

Mu Ningxue had no choice but to transform the Wind Wings and rise higher into the air, similar to a bird that was trying not to lose its prey.

A piercing screech came from the sky. Mu Ningxue looked up and saw an eagle, shining like a metallic fighter jet under the light of the setting sun as it spread its wings. It was glaring at Mu Ningxue, who was gliding below it, with great hostility.

Mu Ningxue realized she had almost reached the height that belonged to high-level species. She quickly lowered her altitude.

After descending to a height of around a hundred meters, the eagle stopped staring at Mu Ningxue so hostilely.

However, it was harder for Mu Ningxue to stay on the white creature’s trail. She had no choice but to fly close to the walls and cliffs, and quickly found herself in complicated terrain. It was not easy to dodge the odd rocks that were poking out of the walls, let alone the huge pines that were growing from the cliffs.

The white creature was obviously familiar with its surroundings. It knew where the caves, streams, and trees that could hold its weight were. The complicated terrain did not hinder its movements.

Mu Ningxue kept chasing after it. She could only search for it during the remaining sunlight.

The sun finally set. The Rift Valley was getting darker.

A gust of wind blew down from above. The seventh team of the Mailong Private Military Group immediately went on alert and looked up.

An alluring figure surrounded by white Wind Wings descended from above. It was Mu Ningxue, who had gone chasing after the white beast.

“How was it?” Mo Fan immediately went up to her.

“I only found this.” Mu Ningxue placed a severed bloody hand on a rock.

“Even you couldn’t catch up to it?” Zhao Manyan blurted out in surprise.

Mu Ningxue was extremely fast, an expert of the Ice and Wind Elements. If she struggled to catch up with the white beast, the others would have no chance to track it down.

“It wouldn’t be able to escape if we were on a prairie, but in these mountains...” Mu Ningxue sighed in resignation.

“What else did you notice?” Mo Fan asked her.

“It was a Tianshan Demon Tiger. Half of its body was white,” Mu Ningxue said.

It was very easy to evaluate a Tianshan Demon Tiger’s level. The more white fur it had, the higher its lineage and level!

An ordinary Tianshan Demon Tiger was ice-blue with white stripes. However, the one that Mu Ningxue was chasing after was half-white, indicating that it was a high-level Tianshan Demon Tiger.

“It must be the same creature that killed three members of team seven,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“Seriously? I thought we had already left its territory.”

“Yeah, we were moving pretty quickly. We even made sure nothing was on our trail. How did it find us?” Aubern wondered.

“Stay on alert and rub your eyes to keep alert of your surroundings,” Kuma warned them.

“Vice Leader...” the leader of the third team, Tommy hurried over like there was something urgent. “Two of our members that were on patrol have gone missing.

“When did it happen?” Kuma asked.

“Fifteen minutes ago,” Tommy said.

Kuma frowned immediately.

“Three victims again,” Mu Ningxue murmured.

If it happened fifteen minutes ago, it implied the woman with a braid was the third victim. The creature was seriously unpredictable!
