Mo Fan did not agree straightaway. He was still caught up in his anger.

He was not scared if Lu Xin was not willing to compromise, but what Zhu Meng said was reasonable, too.

Mo Fan was willing to trust Zhu Meng. If the man gave his word, it was very likely that Lu Zhantian’s career was done for.

“Lu Xin, I’ve already made it clear, you should express your stance too. It was your Lu Clan that started it all. As Lu Yilin and Lu Zhantian’s father, you knew better than anyone else the personalities of your sons. If they hadn’t provoked Mo Fan in the first place, nothing would have happened to them!” Zhu Meng scolded Lu Xin.

Lu Xin was very unhappy with the outcome. His sons were meant to have bright futures. One had become a Leader in the Enforcement Union at such a young age, and the other had joined the national team. His clan was going to surpass the status of the Mu and Bai Clans and dominate the Magic City, but both his sons had fallen at Mo Fan’s hands.

As a matter of fact, Lu Xin was actually quite afraid of the young man. Mo Fan was simply a time bomb!

Zhu Meng knew Lu Xin was still unwilling to compromise. He went up and asked the man to go to the side to have a little talk.

Lu Xin kept feeling that Zhu Meng was biased toward Mo Fan, so he was not willing to talk any further. He simply glared at Zhu Meng.

“Lu Xin, we have known each other for a long time. Do you seriously want the Lu Clan to be ruined at your hands? Do you have any idea at all of the contributions Mo Fan has made? Even us Councilmen haven’t have done as much as he has! As a word of advice, you should just put your pride as a Councilman aside,” Zhu Meng advised him.

“He’s threatening me with my son’s life!” Lu Xin snapped.

“You should be relieved that he’s still willing to negotiate. Do you have any idea how many people died at the Parthenon Temple just because they falsely accused Xinxia? Do you seriously think your Lu Clan is stronger than the Parthenon Temple?” Zhu Meng asked in a soft voice.

“What Parthenon Temple, what does that have anything to do with the kid?” Lu Xin was utterly confused.

“I thought you were always well-informed, including news that was off-limits to the public. You weren’t told who was responsible for the disaster that befell the Parthenon Temple? Do you think the Black Totem Snake showed up at the Parthenon Temple because he happened to pass by while on vacation?” Zhu Meng said.

“Well...” Lu Xin was stunned.

Zhu Meng had once insisted on taking out the Black Totem Snake because of his Threat-Elimination Strategy, but had failed in the end. Lu Xin heard it was because of a young man, and that young man had also resolved the plague in Hangzhou... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Mo Fan saved the Black Totem Snake’s life back then, so in order to repay his kindness, the Black Totem Snake was willing to overturn the Parthenon Temple for him! Mo Fan also subdued that powerful Blood Tribesman there at the Parthenon Temple. Luckily, Mo Fan brought him along. If your son really had done anything to his father, I’m afraid he would have Summoned the Black Totem Snake and razed your Lu Clan to the ground...” Zhu Meng said.

“Can...can this kid really Summon the Black Totem Snake?” Lu Xin’s eyes widened.

Lu Xin had heard about the Parthenon Temple, but he was unaware of the details, as they were kept confidential. He had no idea Mo Fan was behind it.

Zhu Meng nodded slowly.

The Black Totem Snake only listened to two people: one was Tangyue, and the other was Mo Fan. If anything tried to hurt them, the Black Totem Snake would be enraged! How many Mages in the entire country would dare to take on the Black Totem Snake?

“Besides, the Black Totem Snake isn’t necessarily the scariest thing about him. You’re really playing with fire. If Mo Fan is forced to Summon the other thing, your Lu Clan is going to be in huge trouble!” Zhu Meng said.

“What are you talking about? Are you telling me that this kid has something scarier than the Black Totem Snake?” Lu Xin was stunned. He was struggling to believe it.

“I know it doesn’t sound convincing, but you can go ask the Chairman about it. Either way, you should be relieved that you can still settle the matter the easy way. Don’t escalate things further,” Zhu Meng told him.

Lu Xin felt like Zhu Meng was only bluffing. How could the kid have such great powers?

“It’s from the Chairman, you going to take it or not?” Zhu Meng handed his phone to Lu Xin.

Lu Xin hesitated slightly. He ended up picking up the call.

Lu Xin did not speak. He listened carefully to what Chairman Shao Zheng had to say. The man did not speak much, but Lu Xin had already paled.

“Don’t you worry, Chairman. I will never tell anyone about this,” Lu Xin said.

Lu Xin ended the call and gave Zhu Meng a grateful look.

If Zhu Meng had not arrived in time and persuaded Mo Fan and him to take a step back, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

Lu Xin was not dumb enough to sacrifice his entire clan just because of his narrow-minded sons. He was only trying to stop Mo Fan from destroying the clan’s reputation. However, he immediately gave up after listening to the Chairman’s advice.

“Mo Fan, spare my son’s life and I can promise you that our Lu Clan will not trouble you or your family again!” Lu Xin promised.

“Before, Lu Yilin tried to kill me, so I killed him. This time, Lu Zhantian wanted me dead too, and you’re asking me to spare his life by saying that you won’t trouble me or my family again? How naive are you?” Mo Fan spat.

Lu Xin clenched his teeth. He saw Zhu Meng shaking his head at him. He let out a sigh and said, “Mo Fan, it’s my fault for not teaching them the right manners, resulting in their misbehavior. I will compensate you for the things that they have done. That’s all I can do, but I’m hoping that you can spare my son’s life, considering he didn’t really do any harm to your father!”

“Humph, if I had found a single scratch on my father, your son would already be a dead man,” Mo Fan declared coldly.

Mo Fan signaled Bola to release the man.

Bola released his grip, and Lu Zhantian fell feebly to the ground. The people of the Lu Clan could not even recognize him.

Lu Xin quickly went up. He thanked Mo Fan while asking the others to treat Lu Zhantian’s wounds.

“Lu Xin, your son has abused his powers as a Leader of the Enforcement Union. Once he recovers, I will bring him to the Chairman. I hope you will stay out of the process. You know what the Chairman will do. After all, Lu Zhantian’s actions are just too disappointing,” Zhu Meng advised him.

Lu Xin already knew things would turn out badly, but he never thought it would be this bad. It was his fault for not stopping Lu Zhantian from using such dirty tricks to get his revenge.

Luckily, his son was still alive...

Lu Xin seriously thought both his sons were dead when he heard Mo Fan had managed to wipe out the Enforcement Union on Beiyu Mountain.

As a matter of fact, even if Lu Zhantian’s plan had worked, he could not have guaranteed Lu Zhantian’s safety. Even he, a Councilman, did not dare touch Mo Fan now, let alone his son, who had only recently been promoted. It did not matter what kind of excuse he had, he was basically digging his own grave!
