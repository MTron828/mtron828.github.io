3033 Question the Hall Mother

Mera tried hard to think. Soon, a look of astonishment appeared on her face.

She wanted to ask something, but she saw that Ye Xinxia had already gotten up from the chair. She only saw her slender back with long brown hair draped across it. The firelight reflected her silhouette on the gray wall.

Mera did not say anything in the end and watched Ye Xinxia’s graceful shadow gradually move away.

…

It was a long night.

The mountain and forest were windy. The leaves rustled.

Ye Xinxia could not close her eyes. She lay on her side and leaned on the recliner and looked at the mountains and forests.

The lights of the Parthenon Temple would last all night because of the birth of the goddess. The lights were even more dazzling than in the past. People in the Hall of Faith would also stay up all night, like Ye Xinxia. They needed to prepare for the Blessing Day tomorrow morning. At that time, the big worship team would be established at the foot of Parthenon Mountain, and the grand succession ceremony will also be held at the main peak of Goddess Peak.

It was like an ancient founding ceremony. The first day of the Blessing Day of the Parthenon Temple’s goddess would also identify all organizations and individuals who shared a new era with the temple.

“Your Majesty, did you let the Black Druggist go?” Hua Lisi asked after hesitating for a long time.

Hua Lisi was a female knight who seldom spoke. She never asked questions like Tata.

“Yeah, he will bring me some lists overnight. The people on the lists will also attend the Blessing Ceremony,” said Ye Xinxia.

“The list will be full of people from the Black Vatican?” asked Hua Lisi. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I think so. The Blessing Ceremony is to commend those who have contributed to the succession of the goddess. They have indeed made a lot of contributions,” Ye Xinxia said.

Hua Lisi looked at Ye Xinxia. But she did not say a word.

“The Hall Mother said that you should go see her. No matter how late, she will wait for you,” Hua Lisi said after a pause.

“Hua Lisi, I need you to do something for me.” Ye Xinxia stood up and walked to Hua Lisi.

She was very close to Hua Lisi. She was almost touching the tip of Hua Lisi’s nose.

Hua Lisi looked at Ye Xinxia’s black, pearl-like eyes. They were so pure that one would like them at first sight, but even Hua Lisi could not see through the things hidden in these eyes.

But Hua Lisi could tell that Ye Xinxia believed in her. She believed that Hua Lisi would do everything she asked her to do.

“How may I help you?” Hua Lisi stepped back half a step and knelt with her hand on her thigh.

…

The Pavilion of Goddess Peak was like a paradise where the Hall Mother resided. It was away from the intrigues of the Goddess Peak. It wasn’t known for its grandeur and did not have any symbols that showed off the power. It was plain and simple.

“Hmph She has just become a goddess, and she wants Her Highness to meet her at her place. People do change.”

“Yeah. Don’t forget that she was a trainee saintess and a candidate for becoming the goddess only because of the training of the Hall Mother.”

“When Izisha served as a goddess, she was always respectful to the Hall Mother.”

Outside the pavilion door, the female attendants criticized Ye Xinxia. However, they did not know that their innermost thoughts lingered in Ye Xinxia’s ears.

Ye Xinxia could hear them clearly. She stepped into the hall. It was empty inside, except for the Hall Mother sitting alone on the chair near the gurgling spring.

There were no lights and candles, so the entire pavilion was dark. More than fifteen meters away, the Parthenon Temple’s night lights shone through the windows. She could barely see the face of the Hall Mother.

The Hall Mother wore a black robe. Almost everyone would wear black for the day and the day after.

“Xinxia,” said Hall Mother.

“Hall Mother.” Ye Xinxia bowed and saluted.

“Why do you want to see me?” Hall Mother, Pamise, looked very tired. It was probably because she was old and had experienced so many things during the span of a day.

“There’s one thing I can’t figure out.” Ye Xinxia stepped forward. She found that the spring water flowing under the emerald-colored glass stairs had power that prevented Ye Xinxia from approaching.

“You shouldn’t ask. You’re already a goddess. Some things can be ignored,” said Hall Mother, Pamise.

“Actually, there are two things I would like to ask you.” Ye Xinxia stood where she was.

The Hall Mother watched her and noticed that Ye Xinxia could walk properly. Ye Xinxia’s soul was strong enough to accept the complete awakening of the Divine Soul, and it didn’t put a strain on her body anymore.

“Go back to your own hall now. It is still not too late,” said the Hall Mother, Pamise, sternly.

“As you see, I didn’t bring any knights, including Hua Lisi,” Ye Xinxia said to the Hall Mother. Her attitude was also firm.

The pavilion suddenly became silent. The sound of spring water overflowing from the marble statue was very loud. Under the dim environment, the two did not look away. They looked firmly at each other.

“Fine,” Hall Mother, Pamise, said.

“First, and this isn’t a question. I wanted to inform you that the Dark King has resurrected Izisha. Her body can’t accept the healing and blessings of White Magic, and her death has proved that she doesn’t have the ability to resurrect the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan,” Ye Xinxia said, as she observed the face of the Hall Mother.

“What do you mean?” asked the Hall Mother.

“I didn’t resurrect the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, so you lied about the Ancient God Apollo. It was not killed but was sealed and imprisoned by you in the Tulce Hidden Clan,” Ye Xinxia said to the Hall Mother.

The Hall Mother, Pamise, did not respond.

To Ye Xinxia, her silence was an affirmation. Ye Xinxia also saw the surprise on the Hall Mother’s face.

The Hall Mother knew that Ye Xinxia would figure it out, but she hadn’t expected her to know about the Tulce Hidden Clan!

Ye Xinxia was right.

The Ancient God Apollo did not die. During that time, the Hall Mother lied to execute the last Golden Sun Tyrant Titan for some selfish reasons. In fact, she imprisoned the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan in the Tulce Hidden Clan, and the elders of Tulce Hidden Clan were guarding it.

Therefore, the Hall Mother was furious when she saw the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan. She reprimanded the Tulce family for betraying them and colluding with the Black Vatican!

“So, you’re here to condemn me. Don’t forget how you became a saintess and gained the election advantage through my Divine Soul,” Hall Mother, Pamise, said.

“Salan stole your loyal Tulce family and your Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, didn’t she?” Ye Xinxia asked.
