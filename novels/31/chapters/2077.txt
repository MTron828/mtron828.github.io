“Such nonsense! I, Walker Evans, the Sacred Judge of the Heresy Judgment Court, will purge you on behalf of the Evans Clan!” Sacred Judge Walker Evans snarled.

Some people would respond with anger when they were struck by fear. Walker was the same as Reynold. He felt humiliated when his beliefs were being challenged, and that sense of humiliation would quickly turn into anger.

Sacred Judge Walker was a Super Lightning Mage, and his Lightning Magic was quite reputable in the Sacred City. Lightning kept flashing in the stormy clouds as he lost his temper. Dense lightning strikes kept landing on the stairs Zhan Kong was walking up.

The stairs were blasted into pieces. The falling lightning was like nails of wrath from the Heavens, striking the ground with blinding sparkles.

“As you wish!” Zhan Kong replied.

Ghastly hands suddenly reached out from the clouds of twisted faces. The hands stacked up and formed a huge face that resembled Walker!

The ghastly face opened its mouth and swallowed Sacred Judge Walker. Walker controlled his powerful lightning to destroy the hands, yet the lightning only managed to peel off its skin. It was nowhere enough to destroy the face!

The ghastly face ate Sacred Judge Walker. He was greeted by countless ghastly faces that could not wait to transmit their pain to a living person, intending to torture his unyielding spirit and turn him into one of them!

“Nothing but lies!” another Sacred Judge snarled.

Zhan Kong did not even bother looking at him. A wisp of dark soul flew at him.

The dark soul wrapped up the Sacred Judge like a snake. A few seconds later, the man suddenly held his throat and fell to the ground in pain.

“Please forgive me, please forgive me, I was controlled by the evil powder. I didn’t want to hurt the kid...”

The sins deep in his heart were exposed. The Sacred Judge with thick brows was writhing on the stairs as if he was having a nightmare.

“Blessed be...to God...”

“Blessed...be to God...”

He no longer sounded as confident as he was at the start of the battle. It sounded more like he was drawing a cross on his chest while begging for mercy.

Blessed be to God. He was hoping God could protect him to survive the terrifying darkness and dawn would arrive quicker.

Zhan Kong had already reached the middle of the stairs. Every Sacred City Mage that attacked him was suffering from different circumstances. The Mages were fallen and mumbling on the stairs. They were either overwhelmed by their fear of death or lost in their sins. Only a few righteous people with firm wills remained in the end.

They stood beside Michael, the last line of defense for the Sacred Residence.

Michael was struggling to hold his ground. A blue light stood between the curtain of ghastly faces and the mirrored Sacred City, stopping the faces from falling into the city like meteorites.

He had used the golden dragon, sunflowers, and sacred feathers, yet he had still failed to stop the Undead Emperor. Michael had guessed right, in that the Undead Emperor was scarier than Khufu, but he had still underestimated the Undead Emperor’s strength.

The truth was that not many humans had ever dared to challenge an Emperor-level creature. People had known for a long time that there were Emperors among the demon creatures, and thought that because the strongest humans might stand a chance against them, the Emperors would not dare to invade their lands.

But there was no exact reference for their strength, it was merely based on intuition. As long as they took the appropriate actions, they thought they would be able to defeat the Emperors, too!

But the truth was before them; the strength of the Emperors was beyond their imagination!

The sunflowers were constantly weakening the Emperor, but they needed more time. They were like an enfeebling drug, which would slowly make an adult weak. Theoretically, even kids could beat an adult if there was no antidote.

However, the adult could easily trample the kids before he lost his ability to fight!

The sunflowers were Michael’s trump card, giving the Sacred City a chance to fight the Emperor, but they were unable to hold on for that long.

The ghastly faces finally came down from the clouds. They were not just phantoms or some cloudy mists, they were crashing into the Sacred City like terrifying meteorites. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Even the Sacred Residence fell. The golden stairs were left with craters. The sacred halls collapsed to the ground. The tall magical towers broke in half.

The majestic Sacred Residence was turned into debris right before the eyes of the crowd. Even though it was happening in the mirrored Sacred City, those with common sense knew that the battlefield was no different from the real Sacred City. If the Undead Emperor had been in the Sacred City on the ground, the Sacred Residence there would have shared the same fate as the building that had fallen into debris.

There were six other powerful Angels than Michael in the Sacred City, but the people were far more relieved right now by the fact that the Undead Emperor had chosen to enter the mirrored Sacred City. Otherwise, how many living would the evil dragons have devoured, and how many more would have been sacrificed to the rain of ghastly faces?

It was a battle fighting for peace a thousand years from now, but now the people had learned how ignorant and insignificant they were.

If any of the Emperors decided to start a war against humanity in the next century, how many cities would survive in the end? Let alone a thousand years from now?!

The being above them was only one of the Emperors in the world!

What if... what if the Emperors in this world all wanted to erase the existence of humans from the world? Would the magic they always thought so highly of be able to save mankind?

The Magic Civilization that was worshiped in the books was like the mirrored Sacred City above them. It was shown to be full of holes when it encountered a real threat!

The people below did not feel humans were strong in this era after seeing this battle. They realized they had only been living in a light they had invented for themselves.

A single Emperor was enough to topple the Sacred City!

——

“Michael can win against the Undead Emperor, right?”

“We still have the golden dragon. It’s still around. They haven’t shown their true strength. If Michael and the golden dragon join hands, they will eliminate the Undead Emperor!”

“If they fail to take the Undead Emperor out, will he come to the real city?”

The people down in the city could not possibly disregard the battle. It was not a movie where they would only comment enthusiastically if one side won or lost.

What would happen to them if they lost?

If an Emperor like that went on a massacre, the blood would easily form a lake under the Alps!
