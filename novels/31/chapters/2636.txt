The Phoenix Flame was comparable to a Heaven-grade Flame. It had granted Mo Fan the ability to be reborn in the presence of pure flames. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was also incredibly powerful, allowing Mo Fan to crush Super Mages of the same level as him. Little did Mo Fan know, the Phoenix Flame had not reached its maximum potential!

After the feathers of the same color as the Phoenix Flame merged with it, Mo Fan had a feeling the furnace in his heart was filled with feathers constantly releasing heat, just like logs in a hearth. The flames were stronger as a result, but they were still under his control!

They seemed to have granted the flames the unique temperament of the Mysterious Feather Totem Beast, powerful yet gentle!

“Did the Phoenix Flame level up to a Greater Heaven Seed?!” Mo Fan could not withhold the joy rising inside him.

The Phoenix Flame was already incredibly strong, but Yu Shishi had only ranked it as a Lesser Heaven Seed. In other words, the Phoenix Flame had only been completed now, and was now equivalent to the level of a Greater Heaven Seed!

Another gust of ‘wind’ blew at the remaining feathers. They were also set on fire as they flew at Mo Fan in an orderly manner.

Mo Fan was astounded.

He only had the Phoenix Flame. Why would the feathers that represented other Totem Beasts fly at him, too?

As Mo Fan was thinking he was the Chosen One, he abruptly noticed Little Flame Belle had come out of her Contract Space. She was now standing in the center of the feathers.

It turned out the rest of the feathers were not flying toward him. They were circling Little Flame Belle instead!

It looked like Little Flame Belle was being reborn again as she was surrounded by the feathers. She was emitting the purest light of the Calamity Fire!

She was also growing!

The feathers, save for those that had merged with Mo Fan’s Phoenix Flame, were unusually friendly to Little Flame Belle, now unleashing a strange light upon her.

Little Flame Belle was like a small sapling being nurtured by the rain and sunlight simultaneously, slowly growing into a huge tree.

Little Flame Belle was evolving!

She had already reached her Adult phase, which was called the Flame Belle Empress. However, Mo Fan knew the Flame Belle Empress had a stronger phase after it, which Little Flame Belle was currently growing into!

“The Completion Phase! Little Flame Belle is about to reach the Completion Phase!”

Most Contracted Beasts had several phases in their life cycles. The Adult Phase was the usual limit for most creatures, but if Contracted Beasts stayed healthy and had access to plenty of resources throughout their growth, they had a chance to reach the final phase, the Completion Phase.

The Completion Phase would not occur to every Contracted Beast, as it required certain strict conditions.

‘Mo Fan was overjoyed. His Phoenix Flame had just evolved. To his surprise, Little Flame Belle was evolving toward the Completion Phase, too!

The Flame Belle’s Completion Phase was none other than the Soul Shadow resembling a fiery goddess who had been attached to Mo Fan’s back whenever he Demonized.

Little Flame Belle had finally reached her strongest phase and become a real goddess of fire, the ruler of all flames!

Little Flame Belle was not a Totem Beast, but she had earned the affection and favor of the ancient Totem Beast.

Perhaps the ardent-hued feathers would have circled Little Flame Belle and aided her growth along with the others if the Four-Eyed Bird had not replaced his heart.

“What’s happening? Why does it feel like those mysterious feathers are giving him all the benefits as soon as he approached them?” Zhao Manyan grumbled jealously.

How lucky could Mo Fan be?

“It seems like the Mysterious Feather Totem Beast died a long time ago. It only left its feathers, which are endlessly releasing heat. Mo Fan had the Phoenix Flame, allowing him to absorb the feathers that were of the same branch as the Four-Eyed Bird. Meanwhile, Little Flame Belle is a Sacred Fire Spirit,

so the rest of the feathers have given her the energy to evolve into the final phase. Speaking of which, Mo Fan absorbed the feathers, but Little Flame Belle did not absorb them. It looks like the feathers have retained their future uses,” Jiang Shaoxu said after watching carefully.

The ardent feathers had merged with Mo Fan’s body and become fuel to the Phoenix Flame. They were burning permanently inside Mo Fan’s heart.

On the other hand, the feathers that surrounded Little Flame Belle had returned to the pond and continued to release their heat.

“Little Flame Belle is not a Totem Beast, so she can only obtain a portion of their power, instead of absorbing them,” Xinxia deduced.

That being said, Little Flame Belle had benefited greatly from the portion of power she had received. After all, her Calamity Fire was already the strongest flame in the world. She just needed to improve the Calamity Fire, it was unnecessary for her to replace it!

“The ardent feathers of the mysterious Totem Beast have allowed Mo Fan’s Phoenix Flame to evolve to the level of a Greater Heaven Seed, while the rest of the feathers have helped Little Flame Belle to reach her final phase. It means there is more than one strongest flame in the world!” Mu Bai exclaimed.

Each of the mysterious Totem Beasts’ flames were unmatched. If the Mysterious Feather Totem Beast was still alive, it would obviously be stronger than the Black Totem Snake or Baxia!

“By the way, the logos of the Drinking Water Plant, the enterprise, and the school have different colors, just like the feathers!” Zhao Manyan recalled suddenly.

“Yeah, we have found an ancient Totem Beast, but it’s no longer around. However, its feathers have given Mo Fan insane benefits!” Jiang Shaoxu agreed with a sincere smile. She had achieved an important goal!

“Mo Fan is seriously becoming a demon king. Meanwhile, I didn’t receive any benefits from it,” Zhao Manyan sighed gloomily.

Mo Fan’s Fire Element was already outstanding. He could easily crush Fire Mages of the same level now that his Phoenix Flame had reached the level of a Greater Heaven Seed!

Furthermore, Little Flame Belle had also reached the Completion Phase. She was already a Fire Empress. Many Ruler-level Creatures would have to kneel before her and regard her as their queen.

Most importantly, Mo Fan and Little Flame Belle could also transform into the combined King of Hell form. The two of them could conquer the world with the Fire Element alone!

“Didn’t you find yourself a strange beast with an insane growth speed?” Mu Bai teased Zhao Manyan back.

“Tdon’t even know what it is… huh? When did it come out of the Ring? Holy crap! It’s eating those rocks!” Zhao Manyan yelled..
