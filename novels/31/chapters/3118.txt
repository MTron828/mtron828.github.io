Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hiss!

The low hiss sounded again. It came from all around them. The members of the Hunter Society stayed alert. Chen He immediately formed a constellation, creating several barriers like light curtains to protect everyone around him.

“Old Siro, you…” Tong Zhouzheng was about to question the mercenary, but he saw that Old Siro was grinning strangely with his yellow teeth exposed. It was eerie.

Old Siro backed away slowly, like a ghost having completed its mission of bewitching living people into a trap. Tong Zhouzheng frowned.

“He is under the control of something else,” Lingling said to Professor Tong Zhouzheng.

“He is a Three Elements Super Level Mage.” Tong Zhouzheng was stunned.

What level of creature could easily control a Super Level Mage? Although Old Siro often used alcohol to anesthetize himself, he would never be as careless as to let anything or anyone control him at such a critical moment!

Hiss!

The sound got closer, but there was not much sunlight to see inside the hall.

They looked at the broken walls. There seemed to be countless pairs of eyes hidden in the darkness. They watched these people who had broken into the Sacred Hall of Sunset.

“Be careful! There are creatures above the Ruler-level!” Tong Zhouzheng seemed to sense something dangerous.

Tong Zhouzheng was confident that they could escape even if they encountered an emperor-level creature since they had Old Siro with them. However, he lost a powerful comrade, so he could not protect everyone if they had to face powerful creatures in the Sacred Hall of Sunset.

Hiss!

It finally appeared! It was a dark red evil figure. Its body was so long that it could wrap around the giant stone pillars easily.

It had a huge face and a head of curly hair that twisted and rattled by itself as if it was alive.

The terrifying vertical eyes had the same golden color as Old Siro’s eyes. This evil creature had controlled Old Siro and led them all into its trap.

The members of the Hunter Society held their breath. Unlike the monsters they had seen until now, this Dark Red Evil Snake seemed extremely dangerous. It looked like an intelligent creature that playfully looked at its unexpected guests.

A few graduates like Chen He and Guan Yao had just set up some barriers with the effect of thorns. However, these barriers were like thin, useless paper in front of the dark red creature and could not stop its approach.

Chen He gulped. He was holding Flying Star Thorn and the Plummeting Rays, but he was frozen in place. He could not even lift a finger!

Hiss!

More hisses came from the nearby darkness. A group of Silver Snake Warriors and Golden Female Snake Swordsmen appeared one after another. They were half snake and human.

The Silver Snake Warriors were known to be the most powerful snake demons in the long Sunset Slope, but the Golden Female Snake Swordsmen were extremely rare. They were at least at the Commander-level. Some Golden Female Snake Swordsmen had even reached the level of the Snake King! In the Sacred Hall of Sunset, more than a dozen Golden Female Snake

Swordsmen appeared. They were the female attendants of the Dark Red Evil Snake. They had six arms and six golden swords and were all waiting for an order from the Dark Red Evil Snake to attack.

Tong Zhouzheng’s face turned pale.

If there were only the Dark Red Evil Snakes, he still had a chance of leading his students away. However, with the appearance of more than a dozen Golden Female Snake Swordsmen and hundreds of Silver Snake Warriors, the possibility of escape looked slim.

“W-Why is there such a powerful demon in the Sacred Hall of Sunset?” Anna looked around in horror.

“We’re in the Evil Temple,” Lingling said in a low voice.

“How?!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The entrance is not a secret passage or a dark cave, but the dusk itself.” Lingling pointed at the dark sky. She finally solved the mystery of the Evil Temple!

The Sacred Hall of Sunset was the Evil Temple!

The Sacred Hall of Sunset that people usually saw was a dilapidated old site. It was desolate on ordinary nights. However, it would reveal its true form only on specific nights.

Entering the Evil Temple did not depend on a physical gateway.

The key was the timing. Dusk changed the sacred Hall of Sunset into the Evil Temple.

If they entered the sacred hall at dusk, they would reach the real Evil Temple! This was the secret of the Evil Temple.

This was why the people who had entered the Evil Temple had difficulty finding the entrance of the Evil Temple again.

“You all can cut any part of your body to offer it as a tribute to stay alive in this space,” said Old Siro. “You must do it yourselves. Only then will the Wicked God acknowledge you.” Old Siro laughed strangely.

He was an old drunk man, but his voice was sharp. It was terrifying.

“Professor, s-shall we?”

“If we don’t do it, we’ll all die!”

“But what should I cut? My ear or my finger?”

“I don’t want to lose any part of my body!”

The students were on the verge of a breakdown. They had to cut off a part of their bodies to survive, but how long could this little tribute keep them alive? If their time was up, would they need to cut something else as an offering?

If they could not escape soon, would they be required to dismember themselves bit by bit?

“I can give you this as a tribute. Look and see if it can replace the body parts.” Lingling took something out and handed it to the bewitched Old Siro.

Old Siro took the thing wrapped in the gray cloth and was about to open it in confusion, but the Dark Red Evil Snake hissed.

Old Siro hurriedly handed the wrapped thing to the Dark Red Evil Snake. The Dark Red Evil Snake seemed to recognize the thing inside the gray cloth. It stared at Lingling with golden vertical eyes.

Tong Zhouzheng thought this evil creature would attack Lingling, so he stood in front of her with a solemn expression.

However, the Dark Red Evil Snake did not attack her. It turned around and slithered into the darkness.

Its body slowly stretched out between the broken walls and stone pillars. They saw its whole body. It was not a giant snake but a Red Python Evil Dragon.

The Red Python Evil Dragon left, but the Golden Female Snake Swordsmen surrounded them while holding six extremely sharp golden hook swords in their hands. It felt like they would cut them into pieces at any given time. “Follow us, and don’t be reckless. Otherwise, you’ll stay here forever,” Old Siro said in a sharp voice..
