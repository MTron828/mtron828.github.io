Chapter 2827: Rain in the Sky Hole

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When people stood on the terrace of the library of Treasure Mountain Excellence High School, they could see the turbid blue sea immediately. Although it was not the most intoxicating blue, it was enough to put a person in a daze.

Mu Nujiao was in a rebellious state because of the difficult demands of the family. She had left Jing An’s school and went to Excellence High School in Treasure Mountain. She wanted to stay away from the complicated battles and meaningless comparisons in her own family.

At that time, she had always liked going to the library terrace. She could study alone and quietly watch the sea not very far away.

She served as the Deputy Director of Excellence High School. When she came here again, she saw a tall seawall. Many soldiers patrolled the dyke, and she could not see the sea anymore.

Today was a day for Excellence Magic High School’s students to practice. In this era, it was not easy for these students, who could not even cast spells, to find a suitable place to practice, but every high school must get it done.

The weather was good. Mu Nujiao took her lunch break to meditate on the terrace. It was a habit, and it was this place that always helped her calm down even when she was fifteen. She would always come here to practice, study, or think when she was annoyed.

“Why did it suddenly rain?” Mu Nujiao was about to close her eyes when she suddenly felt a drop of cold rain fall on her forehead.

She looked up and found that a strange black spot appeared in the clear sky. If the sky and clouds were a light blue drawing board covering the earth, then there was a small hole in the middle of the drawing board. The water droplets fell from the small hole and were blown away by the wind before falling on her forehead.

Mu Nujiao stared at the hole. She found that the water droplets formed a thin line of rain and landed straight on the school playground.

The students gathered on the playground. They would set off for the northern border of the base city in half an hour. Even though it was only for practice, it was no less than visiting the military fortress on the edge of the protective barrier. They could no longer handle the Ocean Demons.

“It’s raining. The rain is so strange. How does it only fall in a straight line in one place?” Someone questioned on the playground.

There was only one white line of rain, and it hit the concrete playground softly. A group of teenagers in school uniforms thought it was strange and amusing, so they watched the splashing water from the side.

Mu Nujiao did not look away. She soon discovered that the small hole in the sky was getting bigger, and the raindrops that fell were getting thicker. It was as thin as a strand of hair at first but slowly became as thick as a finger. When the rain hit the playground, they could hear some sounds.

Mu Nujiao’s expression changed. When she discovered that the hole in the sky was still expanding, she realized something was wrong.

“Get out of there! Get out of there!” Mu Nujiao shouted at the students who were still at the playground.

The hole in the sky was getting bigger, and a thick water column descended. The icy water overflowed the entire playground.

More water fell from the sky at an impossible speed. The white-water column smashed down and shattered the ground of the playground. The water splash rose high and spread out toward the surrounding area like waves in a beach. Those who did not stand firm would fall or get swept away!

“Hurry up and go to the emergency shelter!” Mu Nujiao shouted again.

“Deputy Director, the weather may be weird for a while. Everything is fine, right?” asked the principal.

The principal was a middle-aged woman. Her hair was permed and dyed into a beautiful color to cover up the signs of aging.

Mu Nujiao’s decision to evacuate immediately felt very drastic to Principal Fan. After all, they had already made an appointment to go to the north to visit the battlefield. If all of them rushed to the emergency shelter, it would delay the visit and the practice session.

“It is not an ordinary climate. I think the war is starting. It is high-level sorcery. Cancel the practice and take the students to the shelter!” Mu Nujiao said with certainty.

Mu Nujiao had been to the sea and Japan, and she had dealt with many Ocean Demons. Although she had never seen this kind of sorcery, the icy water that poured down was unusual.

Mu Nujiao had no direct evidence that this was the Ocean Demons’ doing. However, her intuition told her that the Ocean Demons were behind it.

“Deputy Director Mu, you have provided many resources to this school and won many practical opportunities for our school. We are very grateful, but we can’t cancel the school’s plan because of such a trivial matter. Besides, we must apply with the officials of Treasure Mountain for emergency evacuation, or the Treasure Mountain Security Department will issue a warning signal. We have not received the relevant documents yet,” Principal Fan said solemnly.

Mu Nujiao frowned. Indeed, school affairs were not under her control, but this phenomenon was too strange. No matter what, it was illogical to risk the lives of these students.

“I also hope this is a false alarm, but if you insist on letting the students gather here, I will immediately propose a transfer to the board of directors. Your lack of sense of urgency in such a situation shows that you are unfit to be the principal of this school.” Mu Nujiao did not want to talk to principal Fan. It was pointless to argue with her.

“Mu Nujiao, you are only a Deputy Director!” Principal Fan said angrily.

Principal Fan was displeased. Mu Nujiao had no right to give her orders in the Excellence High School. She was from a renowned family, but it did not mean she could do whatever she pleased.

“Every school director is a member of the Talent International Union University, and I am the president. You can either evacuate the students to the emergency shelter immediately or pack up and leave. I will personally organize the evacuation!” Mu Nujiao did not want to play meaningless games with this principal.

Principal Fan had gotten in the way of Mu Nujiao many times, causing her to withhold many of her educational ideas and reforms. Since Principal Fan was older and wiser than her, Mu Nujiao had always respected her and backed down. But this time, it was very important for her to stand her ground.

Some people lived comfortable lives. They became so neglectful and ignorant that they habitually became lulled even in danger.

It would kill many people!

The longer people lived comfortably in the metropolis, the harder it became for them tosense a crisis.

Several other directors and teachers looked at Mu Nujiao in surprise. They did not expect this young Deputy Director to be so assertive today.

She even asked the principal to pack up and leave! It was not something ordinary people could do.
