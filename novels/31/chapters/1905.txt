“Great, you’ve done well. Go treat your wounds,” the Sound Mage told him.

Zhang Xiaohou put a grin on his nearly unrecognizable face. “Senior, these injuries don’t matter. Is there anything else that I can help with?”

“The Vast Sea Monster is acting strange. The water under its body seems to be boiling, and keeps firing waterspouts into the sky like a volcanic eruption. The mist they produce greatly hinders our vision. I have a feeling it’s trying to hide something. It would be helpful if you could find out what it is,” the Sound Mage told Zhang Xiaohou.

“Leave it to me!” Zhang Xiaohou nodded.

Zhang Xiaohou had no chance of harming the Vast Sea Monster. His offensive spells would struggle to hurt a normal Ruler-level creature, let alone a powerful Ruler-level creature like the Vast Sea Monster. However, harassing and scouting were his areas of expertise. He could learn the dangerous abilities of the Vast Sea Monster in advance, which would basically save the lives of others!

Zhang Xiaohou flew to the right of the Vast Sea Monster and happened to see Mo Fan backing away from the Vast Sea Monster. The Parasitic Steam Locusts were chasing after him.

“Brother Fan, come to me!” Zhang Xiaohou flew toward Mo Fan while riding the Feathers of the Wind Spirits.

“Look out!” Mo Fan was startled when he saw Zhang Xiaohou and quickly warned him.

A deadly object resembling a white dragon appeared from the pillars of water. It was heading straight at Zhang Xiaohou.

Mo Fan had obviously provoked the Vast Sea Monster after sealing off its right bone whip. Its other bone whip went into the sky from its left before it was flung to its right. The bone whip was initially targeting Mo Fan, but it immediately locked onto Zhang Xiaohou when the creature saw him approaching. Zhang Xiaohou was being too careless!

Zhang Xiaohou finally noticed the danger hidden in the waterspouts. After a slight pause, the Feathers of the Wind Spirits circled him like a tornado and altered the direction of his flight with shocking speed. He began to dive into the water like a spinning top.

The bone whip was aiming at the sky. Mo Fan could even see the energy ripples spreading like spiderwebs as it was flying through the air. It did not hit anything, yet it had left cracks in the space. If even a Space Mage had reacted too slowly, they would still suffer serious injuries, even if they tried to escape through the other dimension. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Space Element was the most stable Element in the world, as only energy of a certain level could influence it. Mo Fan had always thought the Space Element was unmatched in terms of its ability to escape from danger. He could basically avoid any danger with it, but after he went with the madwoman Asha’ruiya to Mount Tyrant and witnessed the strength of the Black Dragon Emperor’s claw attack, he realized that space could be shattered too. The Black Dragon Emperor had almost destroyed the other dimension when they ran away with the Scroll of Space!

The Vast Sea Monster had only left a few cracks across the space, which were fixed in mere seconds, but only a few Ruler-level creatures were strong enough to do so!

“Brother Fan...” Zhang Xiaohou came out of the water and appeared behind Mo Fan like a wind.

Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh. He could not help but scold, “How reckless were you? What if you didn’t dodge it?!”

“Brother Fan, that thing has a blind spot. I was in its blind spot, so it could only attack by roughly estimating my position,” Zhang Xiaohou explained.

“If it was that accurate, you won’t be so badly burned!” Mo Fan chided him.

“Well, that was because I hadn’t found out its blind spot yet,” Zhang Xiaohou admitted.

“Is your blind spot reliable?” Mo Fan asked.

“The bone whip would have killed me if it wasn’t. It only gave up because it didn’t know where I went,” Zhang Xiaohou said confidently.

Mo Fan shook his head helplessly. Zhang Xiaohou had seriously become much braver. He dared to take a bet against a creature like the Vast Sea Monster!

“Alright, we’ll go to the other side and seal off its other bone whip,” Mo Fan said.

There were two bone whips. Mo Fan had only Sealed one of them, so the other was still a huge threat to them. It could even damage space slightly. It could kill anyone present with a single hit, other than the three advisors. They could not afford to lose any Super Mages again, or they would struggle to stop the creature from advancing toward the bridge.

“Sure, Brother Fan, we’ll go around it. There won’t be any problem. I also need to check out the water on the other side in case it’s preparing some deadly attacks,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Zhang Xiaohou was a lot bolder after deducing the creature’s blind spot. He was not worried about bringing Mo Fan along while he was flying.

The creature was incredibly huge. It felt like they were going around a huge mountain. The holes on its back were crawling with demon leeches, no different from nests of demon creatures.

“The sea is indeed resourceful. It has grown so huge. Only the sea has enough space to hold huge creatures like that,” Zhang Xiaohou murmured.

The biggest creature in the Qinling Mountains was only a fifth of the Vast Sea Monster’s size. A creature of its size would have no chance of getting so close to a city without using the sea as its cover. This kind of size was the main reason why naval battles were not very friendly to humans.

“Sea monsters are generally bigger, but there’s a downside to that, too. People with great speed like us can easily take advantage of their size, since they have relatively bigger blind spots,” Mo Fan agreed.

“Mm, that creature probably knows it will be at a disadvantage if the battle goes on for too long, so it immediately left after destroying the bridge. Luckily, we managed to spot it early this time. If the Jimei Bridge collapses too, more than half of the city won’t be evacuated in time,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Zhang Xiaohou might be acting boldly, but he was extremely cautious when he was flying around the Vast Sea Monster. He kept staring at the back of the creature’s neck.

The creature was able to turn its head around, yet it was focusing on the fight with the three advisors and the other Super Mages. Zhang Xiaohou was using the chance to move around the creature.

“It should be aware of our existence, right?” Mo Fan asked worriedly.

“It knows we are behind it, but it doesn’t know our exact position since it can’t see us,” Zhang Xiaohou confirmed.
