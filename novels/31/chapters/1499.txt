1500 You Came to the Wrong Room

The snow drifted down in the sky like soft down. The fire crackled in the furnace, burning with passion. They could hear one another’s heavy breathing.

No man in the world would need to rely on an aphrodisiac. When a woman was breathing heavily while standing in front of them and staring at them with tender feelings, as if she had been drugged with a ton of sex medicine, the only way to save her was to pounce on her and fight to the end!

“Well... I have a girlfriend already,” Mo Fan suddenly blurted out, as if his mind had gone haywire.

“Huh? I didn’t ask about that,” Brianca said.

“What did you ask?” Mo Fan said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I asked if you hated me,” Brianca was clearly not in her right mind either.

-F**k me!-

“Miss Brianca, I think you are actually a little sick. I’ll help you to the bed so you can get some rest.” Mo Fan was aware that Brianca was being extremely weird, yet he did not dare leave.

Brianca was in such a vulnerable state. If she went outside and allowed an assh*** to take advantage of her, he would rather be the assh*** instead!

“Oh, I believe so. I said something strange to you,” Brianca seemed both conscious and absent-minded right now.

Mo Fan helped her into the room and pulled the blanket away. He immediately saw some delicate undergarments. -Oh my, look at their sizes, are they really enough to cover her body parts?-

“Lay down, I’ll get rid of the tea for you. It’s not suitable for a fever...” Mo Fan said.

“Alright,” Brianca laid down under the blanket. She was staring at Mo Fan like a little girl. She seemed embarrassed, a little lost, but with a little anticipation too.

“Get some sleep, and you’ll be fine. Don’t go anywhere, I’m worried about you,” Mo Fan told her.

“Sure,” Brianca nodded. She added after some time, “Can you keep an eye on me, please?”

“My life is going to be in danger,” Mo Fan murmured. He quickly added when he saw the confused look on Brianca’s face, “I’m afraid that’s inappropriate.”

“It’s fine, I’m just a little scared. It’s been so long since I last fell sick,” Brianca said.

Mo Fan was seriously worried that she would go outside. He nodded and said, “I’ll be in the living room. If there’s anything... oh, don’t bother calling me. I’m quite tired too.”

“Mm, as long as you’re with me,” Brianca had totally lost it.

Mo Fan realized he had blamed Mu Bai wrongly when he saw how Brianca had turned into a naive, innocent little girl. Mu Bai was no amateur, he was a true professional!

Mo Fan went back to the couch and sat down, facing the burning fire.

A while later, he turned to the side and peeked through the gap of the door he had left open, staring at Brianca, who had curled up like a kitten on the linen bed. He could not imagine a woman with such a mature physique could be so petite in bed, revealing only her shoulders and collarbones. She looked so fragile and weak, giving him the urge to protect her.

“It looks like I can achieve great heights if I were to become an arhat,” Mo Fan mocked himself.

He could even reject such a great foreign beauty. What other things could stop him from improving his cultivation?

“I’ll let it be, since she is under the effects of an aphrodisiac. Humph, if she really fell for me, I wouldn’t hesitate to push her down and fight until dawn!”

The heat from the furnace was oddly soothing. Mo Fan eventually fell asleep too.

Mo Fan was quite impressed with himself too. Did he really fall asleep in a situation like this? Wasn’t he worried that the starving lamb would pounce on the tiger?

Surprisingly, he still managed to fall asleep, mainly because he had not been able to get enough rest for the past few days. On the other hand, his lower body was going to explode if he did not fall asleep quickly. Brianca’s face and body were too astonishing. Her elegance and maturity were very alluring. Something bad would have happened if he did not knock himself unconscious in time!

The snow continued to fall. A pile of snow would fall from the roof at times, but the sound it produced was not enough to disturb their dreams.

Brianca had fallen asleep, too. She was aware that something felt strange about herself. She forced herself to go to sleep...

However, she was still bothered by a thought...

Was she really that ordinary in Mo Fan’s eyes? Why did it seem like he was not interested in her at all? He would occasionally peek at her like a rascal normally, but did he only have intentions, but was not bold enough to act on them?

Meanwhile, the thoughts that troubled Mo Fan before he fell asleep were: did I set my ambitions wrongly in the first place? Should I not dream of having two wives? If I only wanted to have a single wife, wouldn’t it be forgivable if I made a mistake or two at times? However, now that I’ve set my ambition to have two wives, wouldn’t it be an indignity if I continued to flirt with other women?

Knock knock knock... The knocks on the door woke Mo Fan up. He rose to his feet and went over to open the door in a half-awake state.

When he opened the door, he saw Heidi standing in front of him with a polite smile. However, her expression froze when she saw the person opening the door. It took her a moment to collect her thoughts.

Mo Fan immediately realized something was wrong when he saw her reaction.

However, Mo Fan was no amateur. He quickly asked indifferently, “Is there something wrong? Why are you here so early?”

“This...this is Miss Brianca’s room,” Heidi was a little lost. She sounded a little nervous.

“Oh, she wasn’t feeling well, and the furnace of this room isn’t working, so I changed with her,” Mo Fan said.

“I see, you scared the crap out of me! Where is your room, then? I’m looking for Miss Brianca,” Heidi let out a relieved sigh.

“The South Snow Cliff, the last cabin close to the mountain spring is mine,” Mo Fan said.

“Alright, thanks,” Heidi nodded. She left doubtfully.

Mo Fan slowly closed the door with a “you’re welcome” look.

The moment the door was closed, he went right to Brianca’s bed. The woman was obviously awake, and had heard Heidi’s voice too.

She clearly remembered everything that had happened last night. She did not blame it on Mo Fan right away, but looked at Mo Fan with wide eyes. She was extremely lost. She took her reputation very seriously!

“What are you waiting for? Put this on and go to my room along another path!” Mo Fan could not care less. He flipped the blanket up and shoved a huge coat into Brianca’s hands.

“Oh!” Brianca hurriedly draped the coat over herself. She quickly left to make Mo Fan’s lie plausible, as if she had truly done something shameless.

Mo Fan was stunned as he watched Brianca leave. Hopefully, she wouldn’t think that he was responsible for drugging her. Otherwise, he would die and his corpse would not be left intact!

-Damn it, which idiot was it that came up with the worst possible plan of drugging her with an aphrodisiac!?-
