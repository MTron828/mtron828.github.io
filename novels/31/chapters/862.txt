Sayed stood still, glaring fiercely. His heart was engulfed in fury as he watched Mu Ningxue proudly turn around and walk away.

He was incredibly furious at the humiliation. His dignity as a member of an ancient, noble family from Egypt did not allow defeat, especially to a woman!

Sayed’s face started twitching when he felt the pain coming from his leg. It was growing stronger gradually.

He clenched his teeth. His expression was twisting.

He tried to stand straight still with his remaining leg, yet he had underestimated the pain from his right leg after his senses recovered!

“Ugh!” Sayed let out a deep groan, like a beast who was about to go crazy.

“AHHHH!” Finally, the true agony came. Sayed let out a miserable cry. His ridiculous pride no longer existed. He could not even stand properly.

He fell to the ground. Blood started pouring out from the wound. His face turned extremely pale as cold sweat ran down his face.

“Treat my wound! Hurry up and treat my wound! You shameless and uncivilized scum!” yelled Sayed.

He crawled toward his shattered leg, as if he could stop the pain by connecting it back to his body. However, he started rolling around halfway. His cries even spread to the outside of the building.

This was the meaning of reaping what one had sown!

Instructor Bai Dongwei did not show any pity, nor did any of the students.

A severed leg was nothing compared to what he had done to Yue Tangxin. His life was not even in danger. Besides... he had actually snapped his leg off himself!

He naively thought he could sacrifice it in exchange for the victory. A shattered leg did not really affect him as long as he could treat the wound in time. However, he did not expect Mu Ningxue to come out on top. She waited until he proceeded with his little trick, and punished him for his deed in the simplest way!

No one would feel sorry for him since his actions were utterly detestable, not to mention that he had done it to himself!

As for treating his injury, it was obvious that Yue Tangxin needed treatment more than he did, since she was still in a critical state. Besides, the cold had actually slowed down the bleeding. It was unlikely that he would die of excessive blood loss.

“You...you assholes... I...I, Sayed, swear I’ll make you all pay!” screamed Sayed in pain.

The more he screamed, the stronger the urge for the crowd to ignore him grew. They did not even bother giving him a blood serum.

“Ugh! AH!” Sayed continued to roll on the ground. His face was distorted, his tears and snot all mixed together.

He had totally lost his noble, arrogant demeanor in front of the pain. He quickly grabbed the remaining snow on the ground and pressed it on the wound, trying to use the cold to ease the pain.

However, Mu Ningxue had withdrawn the majority of the ice. He only managed to grab a limited amount of it.

“Please, I’m begging you, please treat my wound...” Sayed finally understood his position. He could barely endure the pain using the ice left behind by the merciful Mu Ningxue.

“Will you stop cursing?” asked Bai Dongwei calmly.

“I...I won’t curse anymore,” Sayed’s expression recovered slightly. The ice was able to ease his pain slightly.

“Apologize to Yue Tangxin,” added Bai Dongwei.

“I’m sorry, I was being too full of myself...” Sayed wiped at the mixture of tears and mucus on his face. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He lowered his gaze and saw the ice melting. The pain from his leg was returning slowly.

“Quick, treat my wound. Please treat my wound. I have already apologized!” Sayed was so terrified that his body was curling up.

It was not like Sayed had never experienced pain before, but the pain grew several times stronger as his nerves gradually recovered from the frozen wound. Most people would find it unbearable.

Bai Dongwei did not go too far with the punishment. He quickly called the student Healer over.

Yue Tangxin’s condition had stabilized, although she still had to be admitted into the hospital for further evaluation. It was difficult to tell how long it would take for her to fully recover.

Meanwhile, Sayed’s injury was not as complicated as it looked. By attaching the broken-off limb to the wound and treating it with Healing Liquid, it would take only a day to reattach the limb.

“Seriously, why are we helping him? Just let him suffer,” said Li Yijun unpleasantly.

The others agreed, too. Wasn’t he looking down on their National Training Hall? He should figure out how to treat his wound himself! They had fought many duels with national teams from other countries, and had stumbled into strong foreign students, but they had never seen anyone so proud and arrogant. This Sayed from Egypt was simply scum!

“Mu Nujiao, well done!” said Mu Nujiao sincerely.

Mu Ningxue nodded. She was behaving like an ice statue as normal.

“They won’t be taking the challenge stamp. We finally stopped our losing streak.”

“Yeah, it’s a relief that Mu Ningxue was here. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be getting any resources again. We are already behind, yet we are getting even fewer resources. It’s so unfair; everyone is focusing on the national team, but no one cares about us.”

Sayed was carried to the resting room. He had suffered a humiliating defeat. Even he was ashamed to stay in the hall.

Bai Dongwei immediately asked the team to gather after the asshole left.

The students kept quiet, as they knew Bai Dongwei was about to deliver his admonitory speech. They quickly returned to their spots. The entire hall fell silent.

“I believe you’ve clearly felt the humiliation today. If Mu Ningxue hadn’t happened to join our team today, we would have had no choice but to swallow the defeat. I suppose I don’t need to describe how horrible it felt. I believe some of you would rather break every bone you have rather than experience it. Everyone has their own pride, and as the elites from your respective institutes, I’m assuming that your pride isn’t weaker than most Magicians.

“I want you to understand that there are all kinds of people in this world; those that are kind, courteous, and well-behaved despite their incredible talents, but there are also scum who are reckless, cruel, and disrespectful, too. I want you to remain modest, polite, and friendly to the former kind, but I also want you to be strong enough to trample the latter kind, so they will know that they shouldn’t be messing with the Magicians from China!” Bai Dongwei did not yell at the defenders as usual, but conveyed his thoughts sternly.

They had the option to be a courteous nation, or a nation of savages. Bai Dongwei was hoping that the defenders would not think of themselves as backups for the national team, but young protectors of the nation. They should not let the other countries think their nation was timid and weak, nor should they be forced to swallow the insult when the same situation happened again!
