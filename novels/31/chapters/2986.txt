2988 Frost of Alternate Space

Time seemed to have frozen. There were slight differences, but they were almost the same as Temporal Stasis.

“The most powerful skill of the Eyes of Medusa is the Temporal Stasis!” Apas’ voice sounded in Mo Fan’s mind again. “But it is only visual awareness, a kind of pseudo-Temporal Stasis that allows you to gain more time to tahink. As a Wicked God, you’re just a baby right now. There’s still a lot of power you need to master.”

Although Apas made him sound weak, he knew she was trying to help him.

Mo Fan’s opponent was the Archangel Shalitha, so he needed more powerful abilities to deal with him. The golden eyes that Apas bestowed on him were crucial. Mo Fan was able to see Shalitha’s movements and get rid of the fear he had felt because of the dragon’s teeth.

“So, this is space duplication?”

Mo Fan finally discovered the source of those powerful phantoms. Shalitha’s Sacred Tooth Staff duplicated the space and the power of the staff itself!

It was similar to the Cross Seal Formation of the Chaos Element, but Shalitha could copy the magic in progress! Shalitha was the most skilled Mage in dimensional magic Mo Fan had ever met.

With golden eyes, Mo Fan could use Temporal Stasis. However, he had to speed up to resolve this. The Eight Soul Mountains on his back suddenly disappeared. He turned into a silver arrow and passed through the gaps of those duplicated spaces.

The outer layer of the silver arrow was full of the flames of the Sacred Feather Vermilion Bird. Mo Fan spread these flames into those Phantom Spaces, and they were duplicated as he predicted.

Shalitha created nine layers of Phantom Space. The flames of Mo Fan’s Sacred Feather Vermilion Bird also turned into nine layers. Shalitha’s face changed when the nine layers of raging Sacred Feather Vermilion Bird Flames swept toward him.

It was too late for Shalitha to put away the Phantom Spaces. He never thought Mo Fan could see through it so fast. After he saw it through, he used the nine layers of Phantom Space to duplicate his flames too.

Each of the nine layers of Vermilion Bird Flames was like an ancient flaming mountain when attacking. Shalitha kept waving the Sacred Tooth Staff to create a safe space in front of himself.

However, Mo Fan was also a Dimensional Mage. With the demon blood, his ability in Space Element had become stronger. It was easy for him to connect the cut section.

The raging flames still engulfed Shalitha in the end. The silver armor on his body was deformed, and he was in pain. His distorted face looked no different from those vicious prisoners.

The battle silver armor on his body melted and flowed onto his body. Shalitha realized that his skin and muscles might blend with the armor, so he discarded this precious battle silver armor.

Shalitha revealed his burnt and ugly skin. He finally used the Combat Staff to open a dimensional tunnel in the nine layers of flames and escaped.

Mo Fan already saw where Shalitha was heading and waited at the end of the dimension tunnel.

The claw of the Wicked God grabbed Shalitha’s wing.

Shalitha was also a ruthless person. When he realized Mo Fan wanted to drag him and pierce through his throat with the claw, he waved the staff and cut off his wing himself. Then, he rushed toward the coastal mountains while bleeding profusely.

Mo Fan chased after him. He transformed into a Wicked Flaming Phoenix and shuttled across the coastal mountains.

Shalitha suddenly turned around to attack with the end of the Combat staff. The thorny spears hit like torrential rain and destroyed the big mountains.

Mo Fan flew in the air, but he suddenly stopped, as if his soul had left his body. The Wicked Flaming Phoenix he had just transformed continued to move forward through the thorny spears to Shalitha.

Shalitha was furious. He held the Combat Staff and drew a swirl mark on his chest with the other hand.

Where his fingers passed, blue tracks like star fragments appeared. This track was in the shape of a vortex. When he finished drawing it, he pushed it forward. The blue trajectory formed by the fragments rapidly expanded and turned into a giant painted vortex. The star fragments filled the painted vortex, which looked like a mysterious sunken area in the starry sky.

The Wicked Flaming Phoenix that Mo Fan had transformed crashed into the painted vortex and disappeared. The raging flames also disappeared when they touched the painted vortex. The sky that was still red became dark and silent.

It was indeed difficult to deal with someone proficient in dimensional magic. He could not withstand the attack with normal defensive magic, and his powerful magic was easily thrown into another space, which was equivalent to disappearing from this world.

Even if Shalitha’s wings had been cut off and his back was bleeding, he had no intention of running away. He held the Sacred Tooth Combat Staff and used the tip to slash toward Mo Fan in the air. A strange substance splashed out and quickly solidified around Mo Fan.

An extreme coldness engulfed Mo Fan. He observed and realized that it was the Frost of Alternate Space! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It appeared that there was a cold substance in the sky, which was also present in many planes not in this world. The wandering creatures in alternate dimensions would be frozen instantly by them.

That was the Frost of Alternate Space. It was rare in the sky but could still freeze those powerful feathered demons into dead objects.

The Frost of Alternate Space that Shalitha sprinkled around Mo Fan would spread. They could quickly spread in the air. A small drop from the alternate space could instantly freeze dozens of kilometers of mountains and rivers, and the creatures in these mountains and rivers would die.

The Frost of Alternate Space did not have to cover objects to freeze them like ice cubes. It just needed to shroud them a little. It was capable of suffocating living things.

Mo Fan quickly fled the area that was covered by the Frost of Alternate Space. Shalitha continued to wave the Sacred Tooth Staff to summon this terrifying substance from the alternate space to this fragile world.

The creatures in the mountain range slowly died, making it look like a black mountain on a distant planet.

The flames of Sacred Feather Vermilion Bird on Mo Fan’s body were also extinguished, and his body became stiff and cold.
