Chapter 2656: Soldiers of Snow

Thunder kept rolling through the Lightning Punishment Formation that had covered the whole mountain. It felt like a drum was constantly pounding above them. Each drumroll made them feel like they were being electrocuted.

The sound and shocks were constantly inflicting damage on their bodies. The constant electrocution could damage the internal structure of a sturdy rock. It would gradually loosen their bones, tear their muscles, and shatter their organs!

To stop the lightning from damaging their bodies, they had to constantly focus their energy and resist the rolling thunder!

Mo Fan had rapidly gotten used to the thunder’s pattern. He was going to use the Lightning Acupuncture Points to absorb the Lightning Magic when Zhao Jing suddenly jumped into the Magic Formation and headed straight at Lingling, who was holding the Earth Flame Pistil.

Lingling had put the Earth Flame Pistil’s container inside her Space Bracelet, but Zhao Jing somehow knew where it was. His eyes were brimming with excitement.

“Little girl, don’t force me to cut off your little arm!” Zhao Jing threatened her.

Lingling quickly backed away. Mu Bai and Jiang Shaoxu stepped in front of her.

Zhao Jing shoved his hands forward. Lightning bolts flickered densely in the sky and formed a ghost ship flying across the sky. The entire ship was made of lightning, moving across the dark mist in a spectacular display!

“A Ghost Ship!?” Mo Fan was flabbergasted by Zhao Jing’s unusual Lightning Magic.

The Ghost Ship made from lightning eventually dove to the ground and smashed over a dozen hills in the vicinity into pieces.

There were mountains and woods everywhere just a moment ago, but the whole area was flattened when the Lightning Ghost Ship fell to the ground. Dust lingered in the air, as if even nature’s order had been disrupted by the terrifying Lightning Magic.

The group was utterly shocked by Zhao Jing’s strength. The powerful Ghost Ship had left them in misery. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Zhao Manyan was the group’s shield. He had immediately taken out the Water Praying Beads and imbued them with Baxia’s Seal. He had used everything to strengthen his defenses, but his hands still burst out bleeding in the end.

There were not many people in this world who could hurt Zhao Manyan. His eyes burned with anger when he saw the horrible condition of his hands.

This Zhao Jing had clearly crossed the line. He was only after the Earth Flame Pistil. There was no need for him to kill them for it, but he clearly had no intention to spare their lives, judging from the spells he was using!

“Tsk tsk, I’m impressed, as expected of the group that took out the Northern Sacred Bears!” Zhao Jing mocked them.

He retreated to the edge of the Magic Formation, without taking his gaze off Zhao Manyan. He said, “Unfortunately, the world is never fair. You have used everything you had and assumed you have escaped death, but it’s only the beginning!”

Zhao Jing continued to target Zhao Manyan with powerful spells.

Thick and flexible vines wriggling out from the cloud of dust formed when everything was razed to the ground a moment ago.

If anyone was looking down from above, they would see the vines emerging from the ground and growing upward rapidly. They kept intertwining together, growing thicker and taller.

The vines eventually grew to the size of a hill. A huge claw reached out from its top and slammed down at Zhao Manyan and the others.

The evil vines had emerged from the ground like a mountain and turned into huge claws that could unleash devastating destruction!

Zhao Manyan had thirteen Water Praying Beads in total. Every Water Praying Bead he refined had strengthened the defenses of his Water Magic.

Thirteen beads had been Wu Ku’s limit. The thirteen Water Praying Beads had granted the dead man a solid defense.

However, when the huge claw collapsed onto Zhao Manyan, the thirteen Water Praying Beads all broke into pieces, while the impact knocked him deep into the ground.

“Old Zhao!” Mu Bai quickly jumped into the hole to inspect Zhao Manyan’s condition.

Zhao Manyan lay on the ground. He was struggling to rise back to his feet.

Mu Bai helped him up and saw Zhao Manyan’s mouth was full of blood, but nevertheless, his face was brimming with anger, too!

“That guy is ridiculously strong!” Zhao Manyan coughed.

“Don’t worry, once Mo Fan takes care of the Lightning Punishment Formation, there’s no way so many of us would lose to him!” Mu Bai carried Zhao Manyan out of the pit.

Jiang Shaoxu gasped when she saw how serious Zhao Manyan’s injuries were. Even a defensive Mage like Zhao Manyan could not withstand the enemy’s spells?

“I’ll hold him back for a while. Look after him for me,” Mu Bai stepped forward. He was holding the Ice Brush tightly, and his Ice Palette was floating above his right hand.

The air started freezing. The fierce lightning strikes that were flashing through the air like evil dragons diminished a little as snow started pouring from the sky. The whole area had turned white. The moonlight also added a hint of chilliness to it.

“Impressive Ice Magic, it has weakened my Lightning Spells,” Zhao Jing observed, unconcerned.

“Soldiers of Snow!” Mu Bai’s Aura had changed significantly. He was holding the Ice Brush like a sword used by a general commanding three thousand elite soldiers!

The frost danced wildly in the air. The white snow falling to the ground was somehow giving off a deathly aura!

Soldiers in ice armor rose from the ground like an army that had fought to their deaths at the borders of the snow-covered country. They had returned to life again to fight the enemy!

The snow was turning into soldiers and horses. Mu Bai had drawn a whole army with the Ice Brush.

He gave his order to the soldiers. They charged ahead fearlessly as Mu Bai pointed the Ice Brush at Zhao Jing!
