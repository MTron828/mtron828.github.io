Yu Shishi beat her wings strongly, and a blue poisonous gust quickly circled her and surged across the place. The poisonous wind struck the members of the Magic Association and left them with scratches.

“Watch out, it has a strong hypnotizing effect!” Ke Lingxi immediately warned the others.

As the wind penetrated the skin, the pollen’s hypnotizing effect would enter their blood and spread throughout their bodies.

“Your little trick isn’t going to work against me!” Zeng Guanglie glanced at Yu Shishi coldly. Strange Star Patterns appeared under his feet.

The Star Patterns quickly formed a Cursed Seal, landing on Yu Shishi accurately. The Seal swiftly emitted deadly rays. An enormous demon showed up behind her. It grabbed Yu Shishi’s waist with its claws and held her in place!

“AHHH!!!” The pain from the Demon Torture spread across Yu Shishi’s body. Her mind was tortured by the Curse Spell. The ghastly-looking demon was tearing at Yu Shishi’s soul with its claws.

“Women only know how to behave after feeling some pain. Don’t worry, I will make sure she’s still alive,” Zeng Guanglie controlled the Curse Demon with a wild grin. He seemed to be having fun using the Demon Torture on his target. He was oddly satisfied when he heard the painful cries of beautiful women and saw them struggling in pain!

The demon continued to tear at Yu Shishi’s soul. The woman suddenly looked haggard. She did not expect the Research Union to bring someone so powerful. She had no chance to break free from the spell.

When Zeng Guanglie was still laughing, a giant fiery sword suddenly appeared from the distance. It was approaching the mountain at a crazy pace.

The fiery sword stuck into the mountain at a slanted angle less than ten meters away from Zeng Guanglie, Ke Lingxi, and their men. A strong wave of flames spread into the surroundings from the fiery sword. Ardent flames swiftly devoured the place, forcing Zeng Guanglie, Ke Lingxi, and their men to defend themselves with defensive spells and magic Equipment.

The flames were incredibly strong. They managed to resist the scorching heat, but they failed to resist the enormous force completely.

“Who’s there!?” Zeng Guanglie lifted his gaze angrily and stared at the enormous fiery sword.

The fiery sword stood firmly. Mo Fan was on top of it, engulfed in a different brown fire. As soon as he touched the fiery sword, its flames grew even stronger, knocking Ke Lingxi and the others back even further.

“It’s...it’s him!” Ke Lingxi blurted out, pointing at Mo Fan standing on the sword. He would never forget Mo Fan’s Ardent Sunset.

“Humph, how bold of you to intervene with the Donghai Magic Association’s business. Kid, are you tired of living!?” Zeng Guanglie spat.

“I believe it’s you that’s tired of living. Why don’t you see whose territory you are in? Who gave you the permission to brutally kill the protected species of Fanxue Mountain? Drop to your knees and apologize at once, and pay us a billion to compensate us for the loss. Otherwise, you won’t be leaving Fanxue Mountain today!” Mo Fan demanded.

“A billion to compensate for the loss?” Zeng Guanglie was amused.

The Magic Association had always been high and mighty. They were the ones that normally demanded penalties from the renowned families and clans. No one had ever dared to ask them for money!

“I know you have no intention to pay the money, so I guess I’ll have to beat the crap out of you all!” Mo Fan had freed Yu Shishi from the Demon Torture while he was bullshitting.

The level of the Demon Torture was surprisingly high. A normal Demon Torture would only focus on its target. The Curse would disappear once the target was out of its reach.

However, Mo Fan had triggered a revenge Seal while he was helping Yu Shishi breaking free from the Curse. It meant the person that tried to break the Curse would be targeted by the Curse instead!

The ghastly-looking demon suddenly emitted a terrifying blood-colored light. It had evolved further after the revenge Seal was triggered. Blood-red eyes began to appear on its body, arms, legs, and chest...

“Vengeful Eyes Fiend!” Mo Fan recognized the creature. It was the effect of the tier-three Advanced Curse Spell. Mo Fan subconsciously glanced at the man in a golden robe. He was quite surprised that the man had upgraded his Advanced Spell to the third-tier!

Every tier advancement in the Advanced Level would bring significant changes and improvements to the spell.

Yu Shishi had broken free from the Demon Torture, but Mo Fan had ended up triggering a worse Curse instead.

The fiend covered in red eyes charged at Mo Fan. It thrust claws that were capable of dragging a person’s soul out right at Mo Fan’s chest!

There was no way Mo Fan would let the demon drag his soul out. He quickly rode the waves of fire and moved in the opposite direction.

The Vengeful Eyes Fiend was surprisingly quick. It caught up to Mo Fan in the following second. Terrifying rays burst out of its eyes, targeting Mo Fan’s mind!

Mo Fan had not fought against the demon before. He felt like his Spiritual World was being stabbed by countless needles. He quickly activated the Focus Necklace.

A watery blue light rippled and gently wrapped around him. It gradually erased the effects that the red light was inflicting on his mind.

“Son of a b**ch, have a taste of my lightning!” Mo Fan backed away a little. A dark lightning flickered on his palm.

A stormy cloud appeared in the sky as lightning bolts swiftly gathered toward Mo Fan. They slammed down on the Vengeful Eyes Fiend under Mo Fan’s guidance!

The lightning with a damage multiplier of twelve was very effective against the Curse Demon. The fierce lightning disintegrated the demon’s arms, head, and body.

“What...” Zeng Guanglie was stunned.

The Curse Demon of his tier-three Demon Torture was as strong as a Commander-level creature. How did the kid disintegrate it with a single Lightning Spell?

“Mo Fan, kill them! I’ll do everything you ask me to!” Yu Shishi snapped angrily.

Many of her moths had died in Tongxiang, but after she calmed down, she did believe she had only herself to blame for it. However, she had completely lost it after seeing what happened today. She had a strong urge to kill, she wanted to murder every single one of these assh***es!

“Moth lady, you’re overestimating this kid’s strength. He’s still too weak to take me on!” Zeng Guanglie was not intimidated by Mo Fan’s Sky Lightning Claw. After all, he considered himself one of the strongest Advanced Mages in the world. He would not believe the young man would stand a chance against him!

“Young man, since you’re a Fire Mage too, why don’t you have a piece of my Sky-Flame Funeral!?” Zeng Guanglie lifted two enormous fireballs into the air.

He tossed the golden fireballs into the sky. A burning flower with an overwhelming deadly aura descended from the sky. The flower consisted of a thousand burning petals. As they began to fall from the sky, the suffocating pressure they brought was enough to overwhelm anyone with despair!

The flames resembling burning petals fell rapidly, like a volcano that had been deeply asleep suddenly venting its wrath at the world. Even the mountains nearby were devoured by the golden flames of the petals!

A series of explosions took place. The mountain was soon left with holes with fires burning everywhere. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan had no chance of dodging the spell. He quickly dragged Yu Shishi to him and unleashed his two Soul-grade Fires, trying to block the golden flames from breaking through.

Even so, Mo Fan could still feel the incredible heat of the golden flames. The man was using the tier-three Sky-Flame Funeral. The spell was terrifyingly strong; even Mo Fan was barely holding his ground with his Fire Resistance!

The burning petals kept falling onto Mo Fan, resulting in continuous explosions that were followed by Zeng Guanglie’s wild laughter.

“I, Zeng Guanglie, ain’t someone a kid from the poor countryside like you can measure yourself against!” Zeng Guanglie proclaimed arrogantly. He continued to toss fireballs into the sky to summon more burning petals.

The flames were already around thirty meters high, yet Zeng Guanglie showed no sign of stopping. He could tell that the kid was using Soul-grade Fires too. He would have a hard time taking the kid down if he did not strengthen his attack!

Fanxue Mountain, someone was screaming about the fire.

Mu Ningxue glanced at Feiyue Mountain in the distance.

“It’s nothing to be worried about. It must be Mo Fan burning those annoying weeds. Let’s get back to work,” Mu Zhuoyun said.

Mu Zhuoyun was aware of the call from Yu Shishi, asking to borrow Mo Fan to burn the weeds on the mountain, thus they did not seem too bothered by it.

“That’s not Mo Fan’s fire,” Mu Ningxue frowned.

Mo Fan’s Rose Flame, Calamity Fire, and the Ardent Sunset that he had recently acquired were not golden. Judging from the shape of the fire burning in the sky, it was the tier-three Advanced Fire Spell!

Mo Fan had only reached tier-two not long ago, and the color of the fire was different...

It was not Mo Fan’s fire!

“Something’s wrong, I’ll go check it out!” Mu Ningxue immediately summoned a gust of wind as soon as she realized something was off.

The white wind circled her and quickly turned into wings on her back. The wings beat and launched her into the sky. Mu Ningxue soared into the sky like a wind fairy and headed into the direction of Feiyue Mountain.

“Six wings...” Mu Linsheng stared at Mu Ningxue’s departing figure in astonishment. He blurted out in disbelief, “Isn’t Ice her primary Element? How is her Wind Element so strong too?!”
