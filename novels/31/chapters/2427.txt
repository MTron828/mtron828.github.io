The Ice Crystal Bow!

Mu Ningxue had placed an arrow on the Ice Crystal Bow with the time Mo Fan had bought her.

Mu Yinfeng and Mu Feiluan did not sense its presence at first, but a strong chill struck their souls as soon as the crystalline arrow touched the bow.

Mu Ningxue pulled the string back.

The siblings felt their hearts pounding heavily, as if the God of Death was staring at them. Their pupils dilated as a strong chill spread from their heads to their feet.

Mu Ningxue was standing in the middle of fierce flames. The aura of the arrow swept the red Element into the air. She looked like an absolute beauty with her silver-white hair surrounded by falling maple leaves of fire!

Mu Ningxue took a deep breath. The fiery maple leaves drifted wildly as a silver arrow wrapped in wind strings flew straight at Mu Feiluan.

Mu Feiluan’s expression shifted instantly.

Not long ago, he had mentioned the Ice Crystal Bow was not a threat to him, and that the magic Bow was a mere trick compared to his Innate Talent!

However, his reaction said otherwise.

He quickly withdrew the Ice Magic around Mu Yinfeng, forming a giant mountain to be his shield while he was backing away.

The icy arrow swept forward and left a tiny hole in the mountain.

A second later, cracks started spreading from the hole. They were as tiny as the lines on a leaf, but they quickly grew as thick as the trunks of aged trees!

The whole mountain collapsed into pieces!

Mu Feiluan was hiding behind the mountain and given a massive fright. His defenses were able to stop Mo Fan’s Heavenly Flames, yet they could not stop a single arrow. How much power did the magic Bow give that arrow?

“Tungsten Clam Shield!”

Mu Feiluan held his arms and braced himself for impact. The backs of his arms had the pattern of a clam emblazoned on them. When the two patterns combined, a dark light burst out of them and formed a giant black shield in front of Mu Feiluan, which sank into the ground.

The ice arrow, still wrapped in white winds, struck the shield with a piercing clank.

Mu Feiluan and his shield were driven backward as the shield was covered in frost.

“Damn it!” He initially thought his incredibly expensive Magic Shield could stop the arrow, but he saw the frost was penetrating it regardless!

The Black Tungsten was not the same as ordinary rocks, which had a loose composition the frost could pass through easily. But the chill of the ice arrow still penetrated it without effort, making its internal structure as fragile as ice!

The Tungsten Clam Shield shattered into pieces as Mu Feiluan was knocked into an indoor training area by the impact.

A strong wind swept across Mu Feiluan’s face.

He was standing on the remains of the Tungsten Clam Shield. He turned around and saw an icy rift valley had replaced the training ground. He only let out a deep breath after a long moment!

Luckily for him, the Tungsten Clam Shield had deflected the ice arrow slightly before it shattered into pieces. Otherwise, the arrow would have split Mu Feiluan in half while he was defenseless.

It was too terrifying!

No wonder Mu Yinfeng was forced to use the Ice Phoenix’s Reincarnation after Mu Ningxue fired an arrow at her. Mu Feiluan’s defenses were stronger than Mu Yinfeng’s, but he had still barely survived the arrow!

“Sister, we can’t let her use the Bow again,” Mu Feiluan wheezed.

The Tungsten Clam Shield was Mu Feiluan’s best defensive Item. He would die for sure if he was unprepared for the next arrow!

The battle was happening behind the main buildings, back where the training grounds were located. There were over thirty such areas of varied sizes. Even the smaller ones were the size of a soccer field.

The vast opening had been replaced by an ice rift valley. It extended from where Mu Ningxue stood to the furthest training area, somehow creating a rift valley which would normally be found on a wild and ancient ice mountain.

The disciples of the Mu Clan did not dare get involved in the battle, and were watching the battle from a great distance. They subconsciously moved even further away after seeing the damage caused by Mu Ningxue’s arrow!

The arrow was strong enough to shake the Heavens and leave ghosts in tears. Even the threads of wind wrapping the arrow would shred anyone under the Super Level to pieces!

Mu Feiluan was soaked in cold sweat. He was now considering whether he should accept Mu Yinfeng’s suggestion of asking the elders for help!

“Stay in the air and keep them busy!” Mu Feiluan snarled. He did not want the others to see he was afraid.

Mu Yinfeng remained flying at a great altitude. She was a little relieved that the arrow had not been fired at her.

“There’s no way you are using that Bow again!” Mu Yinfeng screamed. Her voice echoed in the sky, stabbing at Mo Fan’s mind like a needle.

Mo Fan frowned. He found Mu Yinfeng’s ability annoying.

She was acting rampantly again after the Soul Formation Arrow’s duration had ended. Sharp ice feathers had started falling again.

Mu Feiluan’s multi-layered wings loomed over Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue like clouds, firing their icy feathers at Mo Fan and Mu Feiluan with every beat. The sharp feathers did not disappear after reaching the ground, and were spreading across the place like a carpet of needles.

Mo Fan did not immediately understand why Mu Yinfeng kept using the same move. He immediately set up a barrier with his Will to protect Mu Ningxue and himself when he saw Mu Feiluan approaching from the other direction.

“Ice Feathers Explosion!”

The new wave of feathers struck the feathers on the ground and created strong explosions. Mo Fan’s barrier struggled to fend off the combination of sharp feathers and the splinters from the explosions.

“Eyes of the Rock Demon: Heavens Gate!”

Mo Fan realized his Space Magic was at its limit. He immediately added an extra layer of protection with his Earth Element. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He activated the Circle of Crystal Teeth with a Star Constellation. A huge gate emerged from the ground, but it was covered in holes in just a few seconds!

Mu Ningxue immediately gathered more Ice Magic to strengthen Mo Fan’s defense.

However, Mo Fan shook his head and said, “I’m fine. You should gather your breath and take them out with your next arrow!” Mo Fan held his wrist after finishing his words. “Hand of Silent Thunder!”

He activated the Magic Tool that would transform all incoming destructive energy into Lightning Magic!

The powerful Ice Magic did not weaken when it passed the special Magic Tool. After all, it was not a defensive Item. It was just a Magic Tool capable of transforming other Elements into lightning!

The sharp feathers turned into lightning drills after passing through the vortex created by the Hand of Silent Thunder!
