“You’re the one that I wanted to teach a lesson. If you’re scared, hurry up get out of my sight with your team!” shouted Mo Fan, pointing at Meos.

The faces of the Egyptian team fell dark, especially that of Meos.

Get out of my sight! That was what Meos said to Mo Fan before, and now the arrogant man had used it on them in return! It was obvious that he was trying to humiliate her!

How could the proud Meos possibly let it go? She took off her coat, showing her tanned skin as she approached the stage.

“Meos, why don’t you let me handle it? Something is strange about this man. I don’t think he’s an ordinary defender.” Their captain, Schindler, had a stern look as he spoke to Meos in a serious voice.

The others were startled. Captain Schindler was planning to participate in the duel?

They were only taking on a mere defender. Were they seriously that desperate, sending out their captain even though they had yet to see a single representative of the Chinese national team?

Meos turned around and snapped furiously, “Humph, do you seriously think I’m going to lose?”

“I didn’t mean that, but at least I have a higher chance of winning the duel. Judging from his strength, I bet you only have a sixty percent chance of winning against him,” said team captain Schindler.

“Sixty percent? You’ve overestimated his strength!” Meos ignored Schindler’s warning and walked up to the center of the stage.

Mo Fan’s tongue was so sharp that Meos had the urge to tear his mouth into pieces with her own hands!

She did admit that she had underestimated Mo Fan’s strength, yet that did not necessarily mean he could speak harsh words to her! No one in Egypt was daring enough to humiliate her publicly!

Flames of anger were burning in Meos’s heart. As she walked onto the stage, a thin layer of sand was drifting in the air around her.

Instructor Bai Dongwei soon noticed the flying sand in the air with his outstanding cultivation. He immediately frowned.

The candidates were not allowed to use their magic before the judge announced the start of the duel.

Bai Dongwei was about to intervene when Mo Fan disregarded the rules as expected and made his move, as if he finally had the chance to vent out all his anger inside his stomach.

“Little Flame Belle!” Mo Fan summoned Little Flame Belle right away.

Little Flame Belle flew out of his body and stood on Mo Fan’s shoulders. She was barely taller than Mo Fan’s head.

She quickly recognized the detestable woman. The little universe in her immediately exploded, unleashing the brown Calamity Fire across the place and set the ground aflame like a bright-red carpet.

Little Flame Belle flew into the air. She seemed inclined to teach the Egyptian woman a lesson. The flames lingering in the air gathered around her as she turned into a blazing fireball three meters across, and went hurtling in Meos’ direction.

—

“That little creature... has outstanding strength!” a student among the defenders exclaimed.

A fireball with a diameter of three meters was extremely large. It would definitely raze everything to the ground at its current rate!

“It looks like an Elemental Creature, one of the rarest kind!”

“I heard that if a Fire Magician has a Fire Elemental Creature as their contracted beast, their Fire Element will grow a lot stronger. Is that true?” asked Yue Tangxin.

“Mo Fan’s Flame Belle is pretty remarkable. You will know soon,” Mu Nujiao finally spoke up.

—-

Meos was an Advanced Magician too. The sandstorm circling around her was the passive ability of her Advanced Earth Element.

Her Soul Seed was obviously related to sand. As Little Flame Belle was charging at her like a bright sun, she used her will to gather the sand particles in the air, which immediately formed a wall of sand in front of her.

Half of the wall was razed to the ground. Unfortunately, the Calamity Fire was unable to penetrate her defense. Little Flame Belle had no choice but to use another approach.

“Do you seriously think that little creature is enough to defeat me?” Meos’s voice was full of disdain.

With a thought, the sand that fell to the ground gathered once again. Little Flame Belle raised her head and saw a giant claw in the air, like the paw of an enormous creature in the middle of a desert!

The sand paw slapped at Little Flame Belle like she was a mosquito.

Mo Fan noticed Little Flame Belle had trouble dodging the attack. A silver glow appeared on his palm as he grabbed Little Flame Belle and dragged her back through the air.

Little Flame Belle barely escaped from the sand paw. The little creature cried out in shock!

“You can’t fight her on your own, come over here!” Mo Fan told Little Flame Belle.

Meos was obviously an Advanced Magician, since she was able to control the sand to form a claw. Her control was almost as outstanding as someone like Mu Ningxue, who possessed a Domain! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

With her outstanding control, she was able to control the sand around her to attack or defend herself. She was pretty much unbeatable. If someone on the national team stumbled into her, they would find themselves in a pinch too; at least, someone like Guan Yu was definitely going to lose against her!

“Possess!” Mo Fan did not waste more time probing his opponent’s strength. He ordered Little Flame Belle to enter his chest.

The bright-red Rose Flame and the Calamity Fire merged into one, forming a fake Domain with a diameter of a hundred meters around Mo Fan, flames sprouting randomly in the air.

The defenders and Bai Dongwei were stunned when they saw Mo Fan turning into an imperious, fiery man!

“That Elemental Creature... can even Possess!?”

“Holy crap, with such an incredible Contracted Beast, a Fire Magician is pretty much unbeatable...”

Everyone finally understood what Mu Nujiao was referring to. Increasing the power of their Fire Element?

That was nothing significant compared to being Possessed by a Fire Elemental Creature! Not only was it able to improve the power of Mo Fan’s Fire Element, his control and skills of the Fire Element would escalate, too!

“You should be humble at all times, do you understand? I can easily defeat someone like you with a single punch!” Mo Fan was engulfed in flames. Even his words were full of explosive power.

“The ability to possess is very rare indeed, but you’re too naive if you think it’s enough to defeat me!” Meos was as proud as ever.

Despite that, Meos was actually losing confidence. Otherwise, she would not be gathering the sand to set up a defense.

“You will have plenty of time to rethink that lying on the ground later! Little Flame Belle, Thousand Piercing Fire Feathers!”

The flames around Mo Fan swirled wildly as the brown fire and the blazing red flames started to turn into a dense spread of feathers covering his back...

Very quickly, a pair of fiery wings appeared on Mo Fan’s back. The crowd was astounded by the stunning sight!

Dongfang Lie, who was also a Fire Magician, had the urge to dig a hole and hide inside it now. His Fire Element was incredibly petty compared to Mo Fan’s spectacular wings!
