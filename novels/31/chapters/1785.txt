There was no better option than fighting the creature head-on. It was not like they had enough time to think of anything else.

They wove through the residential buildings. Mo Fan snuck closer to the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon with his Shadow Element. He was going to probe the creature first. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Cries were rising everywhere. Mo Fan was intercepted by a bunch of Granite Beasts before he had moved five hundred meters closer to the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon.

The Granite Beasts stood in a line, like a wall of stone, not giving Mo Fan any chance to approach their leader.

The truth was that they were having trouble pinpointing Mo Fan’s location precisely with their hearing, but when they simply stood in a line to seal up the area, even Mo Fan did not have a chance to get past them.

“There’s no way through!” Wen Xia said anxiously.

“We have to figure out a way.” Mo Fan did not overthink it. He used Blink right after he came out of the shadow.

Silver rays intertwined before Mo Fan and constructed a dazzling Star Constellation. Mo Fan glanced at the others behind him and said, “What are you waiting for? Get in!”

Wen Xia and her men had not reacted quickly enough. Embarrassed, they quickly stepped into the Star Constellation Mo Fan constructed right before it disappeared.

“Exchanging Heaven and Earth!” Mo Fan yelled casually before executing the jump.

{TL Note: A reference to a famous ability in one of Jin Yong’s novels.}

The six people vanished into thin air with a flash of silver light. The Granite Beasts initially tried to stop them, but they could not help but scratch their heads when the humans suddenly disappeared. What the heck were those humans doing?

Around a hundred meters away from the Granite Beasts, Mo Fan, Wen Xia, and her men came out of the dimensional space following another silver flash.

“Did...did...did we teleport right into the nest of those Rock Monsters!?” Fang Di cried out in a panic.

The Granite Beasts were not just an immobile wall. Even if they managed to teleport past them, they still had to fight the creatures eventually. However, they were no longer able to retreat with the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon in front and the Granite Beasts behind them. Their ride was going straight to the gates of hell, it was a magical Hearse!

“Are we going to make it out alive?” Deputy Lieutenant Hou blurted out in a trembling voice.

“Didn’t you already make up your mind to cut off your means of retreat in the first place?” Mo Fan asked when he saw their reaction, raising his brows.

“Isn’t it normal for people to act tough once in a while? How are we going to fight them if we are completely surrounded?”

“Yeah, no one could possibly fight with their full strength when being surrounded by demon creatures!”

“It’s fine, just focus on those behind us. I’ll take care of the creature in front. If you are struggling, he will lend you all a hand,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan cast his Dimensional Summoning and Summoned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf to his side.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s role among the wolves had been replaced by Queen Apas. Therefore, he had kept the simple-minded creature with him to handle some manual labor instead.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled scornfully, declaring battle against the creatures without even looking at his surroundings. The cry was a declaration of ownership over the territory of demon creatures, thus the Flying Creek Snow Wolf enjoyed howling for no reason other than to tell others that this land belonged to him!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was merely trying to display his imposing bearing and warn the weak creatures nearby to back away.

However, the violent Granite Beasts all roared back at the same time, even before the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was done.

The deafening roars immediately overwhelmed the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s howl. HIs howl was supposed to have a long note at the end, yet it somehow turned into a soft bark in the end. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf had no choice but to swallow his own voice.

“Why do I feel like you always embarrass me? Why did you even howl without looking at the situation first?” Mo Fan swore, rolling his eyes in disgust.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf did not dare howl anymore. It would only provoke the creatures even further!

“Who among you is an Ice Mage?” Mo Fan asked.

“My tertiary Element is Ice!” Wen Xia piped up.

“Has it reached the Super Level?” Mo Fan said.

“Not yet, but I have a Soul-grade Seed for it,” Wen Xia replied.

Mo Fan nodded. He smacked the Flying Creek Snow Wolf on the head and said, “Did you hear that? Stick with her, or else those Rock Monsters are going to mess you up!”

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf nodded. He felt more confident having an Ice Mage around. The stronger the Ice Element, the more his strength would increase. He might be able to take on these Granite Beasts if his strength of a Commander-level creature in the Advancing Period rose higher!

Mo Fan approached the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon after leaving the Granite Beasts in the hands of Wen Xia and the others.

Mo Fan used one of his strongest Lightning Spells, even though he was only probing the creature. A Dark Sky Lightning Claw appeared above the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon out of nowhere and tore at it, leaving a lot of sparkles behind.

The Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon didn’t bother to move. It was examining the tiny human before it.

The Sky Lightning Claw had left only a tiny scratch on its gleaming black-silver armor. It was as insignificant as the scratch left by someone’s nail on a tree.

“Damn it, the Lightning Element is really useless against them!” Mo Fan exclaimed in annoyance.

His Lightning Element was very ineffective against these stinking rock-hard creatures. The outstanding penetration power of the Lightning Element did not have any effect on the Earth Element. Therefore, even Mo Fan’s enhanced Lightning Element was useless against the creature!

“The paralyzing effect and the spreading effect aren’t working either... Do I really have to use fire?” Mo Fan mumbled helplessly.

The Fire Element was not particularly effective against the creature, either. It seemed like the Shadow Element was his only chance!

“I’ll keep it busy and slowly spread the Fiendish Night in the surroundings. Let’s hope this huge rock is just as dumb as its brothers,” Mo Fan murmured.

The spreading of the Dark Material was going to take some time. The longer it took for him to spread the Dark Material, the stronger the attack was going to be, especially if the Dark Material could take root and spread inside the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon’s body!
