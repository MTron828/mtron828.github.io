“Ticktack!”

“Ticktack!”

The sound was faint. Whenever he heard the sound, he felt a searing pain in his wrists and ankles.

Jiang Yu opened his eyes. Everything in front of him was blurry. He had no idea when the rain had poured so heavily on the sandalwood mountain city. The domes of the high-rise buildings were covered in gray mist. The tumultuous sound of the rain, wind, and lightning filled the unknown place.

The faint sound did not come from the rain. It came from him and the people next to him.

Jiang Yu saw the downpour outside the windowless buildings. It was raining heavily. He saw his team members fall in a pool of blood one after the other. The blood had not completely dried up and was flowing outside the building.

They were dead. All of them were dead.

Why was he still alive?

Jiang Yu tried to move. But the pain was excruciating. He almost passed out. It was only then that he knew that he had lost his hands and legs.

Someone had cut them. Blood was gushing out. The ‘ticktack’ was the sound of his blood dripping on the cold ground.

“Once again, where’s the cat?!” Jiang Yu heard a voice.

He slowly came to his senses. He thought he was at the doors of death. Jiang Yu did not answer his interrogator. He tried to move. His back and his chest had been pierced by hooks. He was floating mid-air.

“Why… why did you side with the Ocean demons?” asked Jiang Yu through the haze of pain.

......

“Side with them? We share the same goal,” said Nan Shou Baixu.

“Same goal? You’re a human and they are demons. How can you share the same goal? Can the Ocean Demons give you all that you want? Ocean Demons are intelligent, but they are no different from the demons out there who want to devour our flesh and bones,” Jiang Yu said.

Nan Shou Baixu walked behind Jiang Yu and kicked Wang Ping’s corpse outside the building.

The building had forty stories. It did not have any windows or walls. It was an incomplete building. Wang Ping’s body was flung outside in the rain. It fell amongst the blue ocean monsters.

The blue ocean monsters were half human and half fish. They were not the legendary mermaid or merman from the folklores. They were much bigger in size compared to humans. They were sturdy with scales growing on their bodies. Their chests and shoulders were armed with large and sharp scales. The rest of their bodies were covered with finer scales that resembled soft armors.

Their lower half was fish. It was thick and powerful. They were covered with hard scales that served as their armors. They stood on the sandalwood mountain like blue armored tanks.

They had grown to such a terrifying level that most magic was useless against them.

The Fish Men Generals were carnivorous. They swarmed to devour Wang Ping’s corpse. They tore the body into pieces.

Nan Shou Baixu stood by the edge of the building. He looked down. “Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!”

He then turned to Jiang Yu with a smile. “I left just a tiny breath of life in them so they can feel every moment of being torn apart by those monsters. Now, again, where is the cat?”

“Do they have control over your mind? If yes, you’re just an Ocean Demon with a brain. You should stay under the ocean with them instead of coming ashore and asking me,” said Jiang Yu.

Nan Shou Baixu dragged another Royal Mage and walked to the edge of the building.

He then flung the Royal Mage down. Blood splattered in the hazy rain. The Fish Men Generals roared, as if telling Nan Shou Baixu that they still had not had enough of the bodies.

“What makes you think my mind is under the Godly Horde Prophet’s control? What good use is a puppet, anyway? Puppets are under someone else’s control, whereas I… Before I forget, Forbidden City and the Enforcement Union have both misunderstood something,” Nan Shou Baixu said as he approached Jiang Yu.

“What misunderstanding?” Jiang Yu asked.

Nan Shou Baixu let out a bark of laughter all of a sudden. “I never expected you to be the first to know my identity. Anyway, there’s no point for me to continue to hide my identity. I’m long forgotten. But from now on, no one will dare to overlook me.”

Over the years, Nan Shou Baixu executed missions as the Royal Mage to the point where he almost forgot his other identity.

“They are only aware of Salan but not me, Jiu Ying. Everyone knows the Red Cardinal in China, and all of them think that person is Salan. Even the Enforcement Union thought so. How hilarious is that?!” Nan Shou Baixu paced as he looked at Jiang Yu.

He smiled satisfactorily when he noticed Jiang Yu was shocked.

“Salan escaped from abroad into China. She was a newly risen Red Cardinal. However, she was not the Red Cardinal that represented China. I am the Red Cardinal of China!”

Nan Shou Baixu revealed his identity with pride, as if delivering some sort of speech.

Red Cardinals had the highest ambition of trampling the world under their feet for power.

Over the years, everyone was focused on Salan. Salan was thought to be the Red Cardinal of China. She was as terrifying as Anubis. The world feared her because of the disaster she had caused at Ancient Capital.

However, in the eyes of Nan Shou Baixu, Salan was nothing more than a madwoman. She fled into China to achieve her revenge. After that, she became the Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican and wreaked havoc at the Ancient City. Her actions had distracted everyone from the true Red Cardinal of China—Jiu Ying.

Not many people in this world were aware of Jiu Ying. They only knew about Salan. Nan Shou Baixu concealed his humiliation until today…

The moment the Forbidden Mage of China, Hua Zhanhong dies, no one would ever dare overlook him.

By then, the world would recognize him as the only Red Cardinal of China, and he would be the Supreme Pontiff!
