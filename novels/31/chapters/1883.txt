Chapter 1884: Flanked at the Reservoir

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

“How is that possible, it’s the sturdiest bridge among the three! Even a high-level creature has no chance of destroying it, not to mention there were so many people protecting it!” Shen Qing blurted out in disbelief.

“It was an enormous creature. I met Liu Xi. He told me the demon leeches we stumbled into at SM City Xiamen were falling off the sea monster that destroyed the Haicang Bridge,” Lingling said.

“Falling off? What do you mean?” Shen Qing was confused.

“They were parasites on its skin. The demon leeches were only parasites feeding off the monster’s skin cells,” Lingling said.

Mo Fan and Shen Qing dropped their jaws. They stared at one another speechlessly.

Parasites feeding off the monster’s skin cells...

Wouldn’t that mean the demon leeches were only fleas to the sea monster? How were they half a meter to a meter long?

Exactly how massive was the sea monster that had destroyed the Haicang Bridge? Even the parasites living off its skin were already at plague proportions!

What exactly was the city up against?

“How about the other bridges?” Mo Fan asked.

“Nothing so far, but according to Liu Xi, the monster had a very clear goal in mind. It disappeared right after it rammed into the bridge. It was already gone before the Super Mages were going after it,” Lingling said.

“It only attacked the bridge?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yeah, the sea monsters are intelligent creatures. I believe it is trying to delay the evacuation so the rest of the sea monsters can arrive in time,” Lingling said.

Most demon creatures would attack the humans they saw, but the enormous sea monster had disappeared after accomplishing its mission, without giving the Super Mages a chance to fight it. It was obvious what the creature had in mind!

It was waiting for the real army of sea monsters to arrive!

“We must strengthen the defense of the other two bridges. There is still time. We can still evacuate the people through the Xinglin Bridge and Jimei Bridge, but it will be impossible once they are destroyed too!” Shen Qing exclaimed.

“Mm, the Donghai Magic Association and the Southern Military are already assigning most of their men to the other two bridges. The people on the Haicang Route are heading to the remaining two routes too, but we have a tight schedule to evacuate everyone. We have no idea if we can evacuate the island before the Armor Antenna Sea Monsters show up,” Lingling said.

“Damn it, these sea monsters even know to use tactics!” Mo Fan cursed.

The sea monsters had come well prepared, unlike the demon creatures inland, who only knew to invade human territories with brute force

The depth of the water would decide the active areas for the sea monsters. If the heavy downpour kept going at the current rate, the depth would soon reach fifteen meters in just a few hours, which meant most species of the sea monsters would be able to roam freely throughout the city!

Currently, only certain species of sea monsters could sneak into the city, but the sea monsters had already learned of the humans’ plan to evacuate the city. They had decided to deal a critical blow to disrupt that plan. Most importantly, the enormous sea monster had disappeared right after it had accomplished its mission, instead of fighting with the humans. It was determined to drag out the evacuation until the full army of sea monsters arrived. The people were absolutely terrified of its intelligence.

Perhaps they had to reevaluate the sea monsters’ strength. The same methods they normally used against the demon creatures on land were not necessarily suitable to be used against the more cunning sea monsters. They had to take the sea monsters’ intelligence into consideration now!

A screeching light beam sprang into the cloudy sky above the city, followed by sprinkles of glitter around it.

The light lasted for some time in the air. It seemed to be a signal fired with the Light Element to gather people’s attention.

“It’s a signal requesting backup. They must be under attack by some powerful creatures!” Shen Qing said.

“Let’s go!” Mo Fan said.

“You two go ahead, I’ll continue to look around in the surroundings.” Lingling was not planning to follow them. She needed more information.

Mo Fan was not too worried about her safety with the Flying Creek Snow Wolf by her side. The deepest spot in the city was where the lakes were, hence the powerful sea monsters were still unable to enter the city. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf should be able to handle the sea monsters that had snuck into the city!

——-

Mo Fan followed Shen Qing to the place the signal requesting backup was fired from. Mo Fan had seen the signal before. It was normally used to ask nearby Mages for help in eliminating some powerful demon creatures.

“It’s at the reservoir,” Shen Qing said grimly.

Mo Fan was not familiar with Xiamen. Having Shen Qing around definitely saved him a lot of trouble.

Their destination was not too far away. The reservoir was not very big, like a lake in the city, slightly bigger than the usual ponds used for aquaculture purposes. However, Mo Fan was a little troubled when he saw the buildings nearby. There were not many tall buildings in the area, and most of the houses were already submerged. There was a lot of trash floating on the water, which mostly consisted of metal sheets from the houses and storage building!

Shen Qing knew Mo Fan was not good at swimming. She purposely found him a taller building.

The building was a residential building with a lift, and had more than ten stories to it. When Mo Fan made his way up the building, he found it strange when he noticed someone had painted a green line up the wall.

The waves were splashing at the building fiercely. Mo Fan saw a strong wave almost thirty meters tall heading right at him as he reached the building. It took Shen Qing by surprise.

“Look out!” Shen Qing warned.

“It’s fine, stay where you are,” Mo Fan’s eyes glittered and emitted a silver light.

“Time Stasis!”

The Space Spell swiftly covered the area in front of Mo Fan. A faint silver light flickered within the area. The fierce wave suddenly halted after entering the area!

The wave had reached its current height with a continuous push from behind. As the wave came to a stop, the push from behind gradually weakened. The wave quickly dissipated after halting for a few seconds.

Mo Fan could finally see the reservoir clearly after the wave fell away. It turned out that a Water Mage had just cast an Intermediate Spell to attack a crimson-shelled sea monster. To his surprise, the sea monster was extremely agile. The Mage failed to control the wave in time, and it ended up surging toward the building Mo Fan was on.

There were over a dozen Mages at the reservoir, apart from the Water Mage wearing the Magic Association’s uniform!

Four Advanced Mages of the Donghai Magic Association were taking on the crimson sea monster, while over twenty Mages were scattered across the buildings on both sides of the reservoir. Among them were Hunters, members of the Magic Association, and disciples of renowned clans. They were all focusing their attention on the sea monster in the middle of the reservoir!

“A Scarlet Rending Demon?” Mo Fan was surprised when he took a closer look at the creature.
