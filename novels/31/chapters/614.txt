The guy could transmit his voice, but how was Mo Fan going to respond back?

Would they have to take out their phones, open up WeChat and shake at the same time to add each other as friends? Perhaps the Advanced Wind Magician in the purple outfit could tell Mo Fan his phone number...

The truth was, either way was terrible. The demon creatures were extremely sensitive toward any form of signal. Even sending someone an emoji would simply give the demon creatures nearby a GPS coordinate, urging them to rush toward the signal.

“We have four Intermediate Magicians, two Basic Magicians and five civilians, but one of us is trying to gather the people nearby,” Mo Fan had no clue how to respond. He simply mumbled to himself, not sure if the Advanced Magician could hear him.

Mo Fan had guessed right. The Magician soon responded.

“Try and gather as many people as you can. My other two comrades and I will handle the Flesh Mound Corpse Official, so you can take hold of the opportunity to cross the street together with the others... Make sure you have enough Intermediate Magicians, as we’ll have to focus on dealing with the Flesh Mound Corpse Official, you will have to deal with the Servant-class and Warrior-level undead on your own,” said the Magician in the purple robe.

“Not a problem, I’ll immediately bring the message back, and gather the people here to cross the street,” replied Mo Fan.

“Thanks, if someone is hesitating, tell them that we are the Imperial Magicians. My name is Zuo Feng, I hope they won’t miss this chance to escape!” said the Magician.

“Imperial Magicians... oh, ok!”

Mo Fan immediately returned to the place everyone was hiding at. To Mo Fan’s astonishment, there were less than ten people when he left, but the room was now filled with people. There were forty to fifty more people!

Mo Fan had to admit that he was impressed by Shorty’s ability to gather people. He had managed to convince four or five groups of people to join them. On top of that, most of the people were Magicians, only twenty of them were civilians!

Obviously, Shorty had purposely recruited groups with more Magicians. Based on Mo Fan’s understanding, Shorty was not the kind of person that would do a good deed.

The civilians would easily become a burden if there were too many of them. Indeed, Shorty never assumed himself to be a righteous Magician with the obligation to save everyone’s life.

“Someone who referred to himself as an Imperial Magician is on the other side of the street. He is asking us to gather as many people as we can and make our way across the street while they are dealing with the Flesh Mound Corpse Official,” Mo Fan informed the crowd inside the room.

“Imperial Magicians, they are here. We’re saved!” yelled a middle-aged Magician with a beanie in relief.

“Awesome, it seems like the Imperial Magicians are finally making their moves. I told you not to give up!” said a Battlemaga with thick makeup.

“With the Imperial Magicians clearing a path for us, we should be able to make it safely...”

“No no no, listen to me, the Imperial Magicians will handle the Corpse Official, but they have no time to handle the undead on the street. We’ll have to face them on our own,” repeated Mo Fan grimly.

“No way, aren’t they here to save us?” One of the teenage girls started sobbing.

“Don’t panic, don’t panic!. We have many Magicians here too, so as long as we stay in order and wait for the perfect chance to cross, we still have a hope of surviving. I’m an Intermediate Plant Magician. Just trust us,” said the Battlemaga with thick makeup.

“Yeah, don’t underestimate us, didn’t that Shorty over there say that too? They have four Intermediate Magicians from their group, and each one is an expert too. Even though I’m only at the Basic Level, my Element is Fire. If those undead dare to come, I’ll let them have a piece of my Fire Burst: Rupture!”

The group was quite good overall, and everyone was aware that they had to work together in order to cross the street safely, so they were willing to comply with the arrangement.

Shorty, Zhou Ming, Mo Fan, and Mu Bai’s group were all Intermediate Magicians. They were the strongest among them. Therefore, the other groups were willing to follow their orders.

“Mu Bai, what do you think?” asked Mo Fan.

“I think we need more people,” said Mu Bai frankly.

“Yeah, strength in numbers,” Zhou Ming nodded.

“No, no, that doesn’t work in this situation, but everyone here should know about termite survival theory?” Mu Bai immediately displayed his wisdom as a top student.

“Termite survival theory? I didn’t really study a lot, I have no idea what that means,” said the middle-aged man in the beanie.

“A group of termites is moving their habitat, but the path ahead iss suddenly set aflame. If they simply try to cross the fire on their own, they will be burned to death. Therefore, the termites hugged together into a huge ball of termites and rolled toward the flames... soon, the termites on the outer layer died, followed by the next few layers, but the majority of them managed to cross the wall of fire,” explained Mu Bai to the crowd calmly.

The room fell silent instantly. Everyone’s face turned grim.

“He’s right, it’s impossible for everyone to cross the street safely. We have to accept the reality. There are just too few of us, so we can’t form a thick ball still like the termites. We’re all going to die if we try to cross the street, but if we have enough people, some might die, but the rest would still reach the other end safely,” said a man with a mustache.

The man was wearing a formal suit. He was most likely the CEO of some company based in one of the office buildings nearby. He was a civilian, yet his awareness was a lot better than the others who were extremely worried.

Apart from luck, civilians involved in a disaster like this had to have good awareness. If they did not make use of the chances given to them to escape and retreat, they would most likely end up dead! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I guess that’s the only way, I know a group of people hiding on the roof of an apartment, I’ll call them over.”

“There should be another group in the basement of the parking lot, but they don’t have any Magicians. Should I call them along too?”

“The handsome guy was very clear; there would be sacrifices, but the key is to have as many people as we can. The more people we have, the lower the chance of us dying. It doesn’t matter if they aren’t Magicians, we just need living humans. Call them along!” exclaimed a woman in leather pants who looked like a model.

“Just tell them to join us if they want to escape this place. This is the last train, but safety isn’t guaranteed... those who think otherwise should just wait here,” Shorty told the people who went to recruit more people.

——

The crowd proceeded to search for more people. In order to increase the chance of them surviving, they tried their very best to gather the people nearby.

It would be better if there were more Magicians, since they could hold off the undead for a little longer, but it was fine if there were not, since they would simply be a flock of sheep crossing the river, with some among them getting eaten by the crocodiles!
