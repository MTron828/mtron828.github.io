Chapter 1323 Extortion!

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

“Elder Kang, please think twice about it, the profit that our Dali Clan is bringing to the Donghai Magic Association is a lot higher than what a little clan like them can bring you! If you are rejecting us for their sake, it’s going to be a loss for the Donghai Magic Association!” Li Hongmei protested, pointing her finger at Elder Kang.

Nanrong Xi remained silent, but his expression was clearly saying that they would be the ones suffering greater losses if the Donghai Magic Association was serious about ending the cooperation with their renowned clan!

“We can cooperate with smaller clans. We are willing to spend more time evaluating trustworthy partners. I thought as a renowned clan, as an honorable guest that our Donghai Magic Association had invited, you would place the wellbeing of your clan first before doing anything, and that you would strictly conform to the expected behavior of a Mage and a disciple of a renowned clan, but it turns out that I was wrong. Whether it is a normal clan or a renowned clan, everyone that is invited here is a guest of the Donghai Magic Association, and it’s our obligation to guarantee their safety... I would rather earn less and spend more time than see the Donghai Magic Association being corrupted and so despised by the people!” Elder Kang proclaimed.

The Donghai Magic Association was affiliated with the Asia Magic Association, so it could be regarded as an international organization. As a result, the members of the Donghai Magic Association had a sense of superiority. Even those working with them would feel superior to the others. It was clearly not a healthy thought. It would lead the Donghai Magic Association to destruction!

“Even if it was just an intern being picked on here in the territory of the Donghai Magic Association, it would bring great shame to our name, let alone Mu Ningxue, who has done our country a great deed as a representative of the national team!”

Elder Kang’s words were exactly what the little clans had waited to hear. Unfairness had always been a great problem, especially for the members of the Donghai Magic Association, who usually acted high and mighty. They did not even show any respect to the Oriental Pearl Tower, even when it was the highest Magic Association in the country. The little clans could only remain silent and endure the mistreatment.

Finally, an authoritative Great Elder was willing to step forward and speak on their behalf, condemning those that kept abusing their powers. How could they not agree with him!?

“You’re going to regret it!” Li Hongmei flushed after hearing the support Elder Kang was receiving. She left quickly after uttering those words.

“Great Elder Kang, I’m indeed sorry for what I’ve done. I was misled by Pan Xi’s one-sided statement. I thought Mu Ningxue was being ungrateful toward the Mu Clan, thus I offered him my help. The Nanrong Clan is willing to accept the punishment, but I hope Great Elder Kang could give us another chance. The Nanrong Clan is willing to give Fanxue Mountain the Cliff of Ages to compensate them for their loss,” Nanrong Xi said sincerely to Elder Kang.

“Brother, what are you doing? How could you...” Nanrong Ni immediately shook her head in disapproval.

The Cliff of Ages had always brought the Nanrong Clan handsome profits. It had great potential, but Nanrong Xi had offered to give it to Mu Ningxue’s Fanxue Mountain. Nanrong Ni felt like she was about to go mad!

“Silence!” Nanrong Xi glared at Nanrong Ni.

“Are all the people of the Nanrong Clan hypocrites?” Mo Fan mocked them.

“We are sincerely trying to make amends,” Nanrong Xi said smoothly.

Elder Kang was experienced with situations like these. He had not said those words to sever the relationship of the Magic Association to the renowned clans. He was just reminding the renowned clans to be mindful of their actions and stop disrespecting others.

He looked at Mu Ningxue and said, “The Donghai Magic Association is in the wrong, too. We can’t change the rules that have been set, and the same goes for every decision we make. But if the person involved, Mu Ningxue of Fanxue Mountain, is willing to accept your apology, we are more than happy for you to settle the dispute that way.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Giving someone you’ve just beaten up a candy, there’s no way I’m going to...” Mo Fan clearly did not accept the Nanrong Clan’s apology. He already decided to intercept Nanrong Ni and Nanrong Xi after they left Gulangyu and beat the crap out of them!

“Sure, we accept it. Fanxue Mountain will be taking the Cliff of Ages!” Mu Ningxue quickly accepted their offer.

Mu Ningxue had nodded before Mo Fan could finish his sentence. It left Mo Fan in quite an awkward spot!

“Xuexue, it’s better to do it my way!” Mo Fan whispered.

Mu Ningxue shook her head and said, “Fanxue Mountain needs the Cliff of Ages. Compared to your meaningless way of venting frustration, it’s more valuable to claim the Cliff of Ages!”

“But...” Mo Fan was still not pleased with the outcome.

“Don’t worry, I’m still fine, right? Thanks to you,” Mu Ningxue smiled at Mo Fan. Her alluring eyes were no longer as cold and expressionless to him. Their charm was ten times stronger than usual, triggering an electricity spike that scorched Mo Fan’s beating heart.

“Whatever my wife says!” Mo Fan stopped advising against it.

Mo Fan was a shameless man and purposely said the words out loud. One could easily imagine how terrible the people around were feeling after being fed such a huge sack of dog food.

“It’s settled, then. The Dali Clan will not be joining the rest of the meeting. They will not be invited to the annual meeting from today on. The Nanrong Clan has misunderstood the situation and is willing to compensate for it. They no longer have any say in the resources this year, but they will still be our honorable guest next year,” Elder Kang said.

“Hey, wait a second, old man, you’ve taken charge of the situation and placed the blame on them, but your Magic Association should be held responsible for it, too. You didn’t bother to show up even when the island almost sank during the fight... the Nanrong Clan is willing to compromise and apologize because they didn’t want to give up on their relationship with you, but your Donghai Magic Association hasn’t really done anything. You think you can get over it by just saying a few nice sentences to us?” Mo Fan pressed angrily.

Elder Kang was startled, and groaned inwardly. -How cunning, he managed to see through my trick...-

He had punished the Dali Clan and forced the Nanrong Clan to compromise and compensate them for the loss. It seemed like the Donghai Magic Association had been making amends on the surface, yet they had not really given up anything. Chasing the Dali Clan away was not necessarily a loss for them!

He had executed it perfectly, yet Mo Fan had to ruin all of it when he was about to dismiss the crowd!

“Shouldn’t you be compensating us for our loss too? As the reputable Donghai Magic Association in charge of the cities along the coastline, as an international organization, I believe you will be giving us more than the Nanrong Clan has given us, right?”

“Well...” Elder Kang found himself in an awkward position. His trick had worked every time before. He had managed to improve their reputation, rectify the name of the Donghai Magic Association, warn the renowned clans, and get rid of a foolish partner; how did his plan fail miserably all of a sudden!?

Mu Ningxue pinched Mo Fan’s waist, as he was trying to demand more benefits through extortion. She suddenly felt like it was such a waste for him to be a Mage. He should have become an unscrupulous merchant instead!

“I’m just trying to earn more money to buy you some facial masks, look at your injuries...” Mo Fan said softly.

“Initially, you wouldn’t be able to get a greater share of the Fragmented Crystal Vein, since you already own a portion of it, but we’ll be giving you the share that was previously allocated to the Dali Clan instead. If you are able to manage it wisely, I believe we will have more opportunities to work together in the future. What do you think?” Elder Kang said.

“But that’s from the Dali Clan, not the Donghai Magic Association...” Mo Fan continued relentlessly.

Elder Kang’s expression darkened. He had never seen such a shameless young man before!

“That will do, we’ll take care of the Dali Clan’s share. Leave it to us,” Mu Ningxue quickly intervened between the two. She did feel like Mo Fan was pushing the limit...

“Mm, very well then,” Elder Kang nodded. He was afraid that Mo Fan would bite at him again!

Mo Fan also knew how difficult it was for the Donghai Magic Association to give something up. However, he was more than willing to take the Dali Clan’s share of the Fragmented Crystal Vein, even though he had no clue what it actually was...

——

The rest of the procedures were straightforward. The Nanrong Clan soon transferred ownership of the Cliff of Ages to Fanxue Mountain. Meanwhile, Fanxue Mountain was also part of the group managing the extraction of the Fragmented Crystal Vein. On top of that, the share that the Dali Clan initially held was quite a big portion, since both the territories of the Dongfang Clan and the Bai Clan were further away from the Fragmented Crystal Vein than the Dali Clan. After all, the main headquarters of the Dali Clan was around Feiniao City too! That being said, Fanxue Mountain was still the closest. It was right beside Fanxue Mountain’s territory, but Mu Ningxue’s clan would have difficulty eating the entire cake...

“Did Little Flame Belle evolve?”

“Yeah, she’s in the Adolescent Phase now. Her strength is equivalent to a Commander-level creature in the Advancing Period, but there’s a huge problem now,” Mo Fan told her, placing his hands behind his head.

He enjoyed going for a walk with Mu Ningxue. Even though the woman was within an arm’s reach, they were still not as intimate as a pair of lovers... but the ambiguous feeling was special and comfortable. It was just like how they were when they were still kids. He was hoping to take the next step, yet he did not want to rush it and ruin the atmosphere between them. It was so pure that Mo Fan was struggling to believe it was something that he had wanted for so long!

“What is it?” Mu Ningxue asked immediately.

A Commander-level in the Advancing Period was remarkably strong. Only a Super Mage could take on a creature like that!

If Little Flame Belle had become so strong, Mo Fan was basically unbeatable against Mages below the Super Level!

“My cultivation is too weak. There’s a chance I will explode if Little Flame Belle Possesses me,” Mo Fan smiled wryly.

“Which means you won’t be able to use it as often?”

“Mm, it will become stabler once my cultivation improves,” Mo Fan confirmed.

“Sounds good; it means you’ll be training even harder!”

“Why don’t we find a secret room and cultivate in seclusion together? Like Xiaolongnu and Yang Guo...” Mo Fan suggested.

“Your fire is going to affect my ice,” Mu Ningxue rejected him promptly.

How could she not know what Mo Fan was thinking? The man with his vile thoughts!
