Chapter 2805: So-called High Level Of Cultivation

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the Clearsky Hunter Agency at Jing An…

Ding Ding Dong Dong!

The door was pushed open, it automatically bounced back to its place and disturbed a small wind chime. The wind chime produced a crisp and pleasant sound. The sound echoed within the tea house.

“Hi, I’m here looking for….” Song Feiyao was dressed in black crop top, black silk trousers, and black conical hat. She had captured many passersby’s attention along the way because of her unique attire.

“Shh!” A handsome man with golden hair stood up. He pretended to listen to her attentively.

Song Feiyao stared at him in confusion.

“I sit here and wait for the guests expectantly every day. However, most of them always disappoint me. Today, as usual I waited for the guests with some trepidation… until you walked in,” said the man. “My day brightened up. Even though you are dressed entirely in black, you appear ever so vibrant in my eyes…”

“Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Zhao Manyan, and you can call me Xiao Tian. Aside from being an outstanding Holy Light mage, I’m also a modern poet. Thank you for shedding light on my somewhat dull poetry. May I know what I can do in return? You may ask me to do anything. I’ll feel guilty if you don’t. After all, you’ve done me a huge favor…”

“I came here to find Mo Fan,” Song Feiyao stated her business. She did not know what the man was blabbering about.

“Oh! So, you came to find M-Mo Fan… You came to find Mo Fan…”

‘She’s such a pretty woman… How could Mo Fan be the one who….’ Zhao Manyan tried to remain calm. However, he was frustrated inwardly.

“Is he around?” Song Feiyao asked.

“He is. Please look for him yourself.” Zhao Manyan returned to his seat and ignored her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

......

She wondered what was wrong with him. She found his behavior so odd. She ignored him and looked around the shop.

The wind chime above the door rang again. Song Feiyao was about to walk to the backyard when she heard the handsome man stand up again. “You’re like a rainbow after the storm. Your stunning presence brightened my dull brain and inspired me greatly. Allow me to introduce myself…”

“Oh, really? This is my first time coming to Jing An. I heard there are many petty tea houses here. I never expected to meet such a romantic poet. I’m so happy!” said the girl.

Song Feiyao walked to the backyard. She barely heard the man and woman from inside. She noticed there was a variety of greenery in the courtyard. Then, she noticed a person sitting on his knees concentrating on his cultivation…

The tea house was surrounded by high rise skyscrapers. There were several main streets in Jing An. It was a crowded place. Even so, there was a sense of tranquility in the middle of chaos in the quiet backyard of the tea house.

Song Feiyao did not disturb Mo Fan. She sat beside him and quietly observed the Star Dust glow on him. The colors were brown, purple, red, pure silver, moon white, dark glow, mixed shadow, blood ink…

It was amazing that one person possessed so many shades of magical power. Each of them was extremely powerful!

…

Mo Fan opened his eyes. The unique Star Dust hues soon faded from his eyes, and they returned to his normal black-brown color.

“It is done!” Mo Fan smiled proudly.

His smile grew wider until he noticed a presence beside him. He tried to wipe the grin off his face lest he look like an idiot. Song Feiyao tried to hold back her laughter.

“Your cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds. We’ve once allowed the outsiders to use the Underground Holy Springs. It shows tremendous effect in the beginning, but it gradually fades. I rarely saw someone like you who can break through the barriers within such a short period of time.” Song Feiyao fixed her gaze on his chest.

When Mo Fan was in the middle of his cultivation, she noticed a unique glow on his chest. The light completely changed because of the Underground Holy Spring.

“I’d relied on the Underground Holy Spring when I first advanced to Super level,” Mo Fan said to Song Feiyao honestly.

She was surprised.

“There are more than one Underground Holy Spring. There’s one in Bo City. However, it’s a small spring that has almost dried up to the point where there is not much warmth left,” said Mo Fan.

He then briefly told the story of the Underground Holy Spring at Bo City to her. He also mentioned the guardians from the Ancient King’s generation who stood guard over the Underground Holy Spring.

“In other words, we’re of the same kind, right?” Song Feiyao asked, puzzled.

“Weiju clan from the Ancient Capital, Bo City, and Licheng Afterglow Island are all related to the Underground Holy Spring.”

“Perhaps in the past, the clan standing guard over the Underground Holy Spring had split. These springs are all that remains after so many years. When you mentioned another Underground Holy Spring somewhere else, I knew it must have been another branch of it like Bo City and Licheng Afterglow Island,” said Mo Fan.

“I’ve never thought about it…. No wonder the Underground Holy Spring has such an effect on you,” Song Feiyao said with a sigh.

Mo Fan smiled. Truth was, the Underground Holy Spring was not particularly effective to him. It was all because of Little Loach! Little Loach had become a movable premium Underground Holy Spring for him.

Those with Super level had to search for the veins of Star Sea and figure out their magical path. They had to work very hard for it and exhausted tremendous energy and financial resources.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan was different. Ever since he obtained the Ancient King’s Soul Essence, Little Loach transformed and became distinctive from others. With the addition of the Underground Holy Spring, he would be close to invincible.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that even if Mo Fan slept and did nothing, his cultivation level could increase significantly and break through the solid barriers!

Mo Fan had achieved Super level in his Earth element magical power within the short period when Song Feiyao was away. He had achieved Super level in his Summoning element magical power not very long ago. The time it took him to achieve it had shortened radically.

And that was still not a big deal…

If things went smoothly, he would achieve a breakthrough in his Chaos element magical power, too! His Space, Shadow, and Fire element magical powers were going to advance again!

“By the way, what is your cultivation level? The place that we’re heading could be quite dangerous. The Green East Sea God cannot come with us,” Mo Fan said.

“I’ve completed my cultivation in four elements.”

‘Um… Well, you’ve been soaking in the Underground Holy Spring since you were a child. You became who you are today under the Licheng Afterglow Islander advantage. You don’t have any major elements, Heaven Seeds, or supernatural power. You have no exclusive knowledge of your own Super level cultivation. Yet you claim to have a so-called high level of cultivation, hmph!’
