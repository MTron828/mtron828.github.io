As Mo Fan was falling, Liu Ru made it in time. She caught Mo Fan and leapt a few times to swiftly create some distance from the monster.

“Holy crap, those poisonous spikes are sharp!” Mo Fan lowered his head and saw lots of holes on his Black Snake Armor left by the poisonous spikes.

Even a Commander-level creature would have trouble penetrating his defense considering the level of the Black Snake Armor, yet a single bite had left so many holes on it. It showed how deadly the poisonous spikes were!

The Sudden-Death Poison Queen roared out in fury. The poisonous spikes growing on its arms were actually removable. Stalagmite-sized poisonous spikes were fired off as the creature flung its arms around.

Mo Fan hid behind a pillar while Liu Ru leapt nimbly into the air and hung upside down from the ceiling.

“Liu Ru, can you keep it busy for a while?” asked Mo Fan.

“Sure thing, but our attacks seem to have little effect on him,” said Liu Ru.

“Don’t worry, it’s going to work soon. I just need to destroy its thick poisonous skin first!” said Mo Fan.

Liu Ru trusted Mo Fan. She glided down from high above. Her slender figure turned into a v-shape with a sharp edge, slashing at the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s chest. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s chest looked relatively soft. From afar, it looked like a pair of dangling, bloated, black monstrous breasts. Liu Ru figured out that it was the only part that was not covered by the thick, poisonous armor. It might serve as a weak point.

To her surprise, the soft breasts exploded as she was about to land her attack, spitting sticky, poisonous liquid at her.

The poisonous liquid was extremely viscous. Anyone that was caught by it would instantly be covered in a sticky mess, making it difficult to break free.

Luckily, Liu Ru was able to react quickly. She halted her attack in mid-air and transformed into a red bat, quickly changing direction and dodging the poisonous liquid.

“How disgusting!” Liu Ru reclaimed her human form and realized her arm had been hit by the poisonous substance. However, she could not shake it off, like chewing gum that was stuck on the sole of a shoe.

New poisonous spikes had grown out of the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s arms. As the creature clapped its arms at Liu Ru, it was like an enormous beast clawing at her.

Liu Ru continued to back off, but the Sudden-Death Poison Queen kept pursuing her, snapping the pillars along the way in half. The Slanted Hall started shaking dangerously.

“The Star Constellation Book is pretty slow, but it’s quite handy in emergencies...” Mo Fan was standing still. Seven Star Patterns had appeared around him.

The Star Patterns combined together into a three-dimensional shape, giving off an imperious aura. Lightning flickered wildly, emitting blinding flashes.

When Mo Fan fully unleashed the brilliance of the Star Constellation, all the lightning arcs combined into a single beam!

The beam sprang forward, traveling a few hundred meters in an instant!

The Lightning Beam had remarkable penetrative force. The Sudden-Death Poison Queen was aware of the restless lightning energy coming from Mo Fan’s direction and tried to dodge the attack, yet as soon as it turned around, the Lightning Beam pierced through its body with a sharp screech, not giving it any time to react.

The Lightning Beam punched right through the Sudden-Death Poison Queen and knocked it flying out of the Slanted Hall.

Poisonous black blood splattered across the place. Liu Ru stared at Mo Fan in shock.

“The power of the Advanced Lightning Spell is incredible indeed!” Mo Fan was excited.

It was Mo Fan’s first time using the Advanced Lightning Spell after his cultivation improved. The spell was quick and direct, like the Thunderbolt spell. It did not matter how thick the target’s armor was, the Lightning Beam simply went through it!

The Sudden-Death Poison Queen recovered and lowered its head. It was staring at the hole in its body in disbelief.

The blow was actually effective, as the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s face slowly disappeared, revealing Fang Shaoli’s face underneath it.

She looked like she was frightened, as she did not expect her enemy to penetrate her mutated body so easily!

“Mist Strike!” Liu Ru immediately flew up and flung out her sleeves. Countless red bats flew out from her coat. They were as dense as a cloud of fog, and surrounded the Sudden-Death Poison Queen in an instant.

“Sky-Flame Funeral!”

The Lightning attack ended, but Mo Fan still had another Advanced Spell. Mo Fan unleashed the violent Fire Element while Liu Ru’s bats were keeping the Sudden-Death Poison Queen busy.

A fiery cloud appeared above the Sudden-Death Poison Queen. A rain of fire poured down rapidly and immediately set the whole place aflame. The whole area within a hundred meters of the Sudden-Death Poison Queen was caught inside.

The flames burned ferociously. Since the Sudden-Death Poison Queen was already injured, the flames drilled into its body and burned its organs. It had no chance of escaping the assault of the Sky-Flame Funeral no matter which direction it ran in.

The Sky-Flame Funeral lasted quite a long time. The Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s poison was almost completely burned away by the flames.

Liu Ru found the perfect time to strike. She formed a thin sword with her blood and thrust it into the back of the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s head fiercely, almost cutting the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s brain apart.

The monster that Fang Shaoli had turned into was quite tough. Despite the injuries it had suffered, it was still full of energy. It finally ran out of the ocean of flames that tortured it so, broke free from Liu Ru who was fighting it at close range, and headed straight for Mo Fan!

After all, Mo Fan was her target. Her teacher already told her to let him live.

When Mo Fan saw the monster going all out at him, he decided not to dodge it anymore.

“Little Flame Belle, fire!” yelled Mo Fan. Both the Rose Flame and Calamity Fire were ignited, engulfing him in flames instantly.

“Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons!” A fist with nine spurts of fire like fiery dragons rammed into the Sudden-Death Poison Queen.

The Sudden-Death Poison Queen was covered in a layer of poison. The flames were unable to get close to her body. She collided with Mo Fan’s fist and extinguished the nine fiery dragons.

Mo Fan realized the situation was not in his favor. He immediately gathered the debris of the broken pillars together with his telekinesis and formed a wall...

The wall was shattered instantly. Mo Fan, still wearing the Black Snake Armor, was knocked flying from one end of the Slanted Hall to the other. Unfortunately, there was no pillar in between to slow him down.

Thanks to the Black Snake Armor, Mo Fan was able to endure the damage.

He rose to his feet as blood ran down his lips. He stared at the poisonous monster and spat, “How is this thing so tough? Her strength didn’t even decrease after taking all those hits!”
