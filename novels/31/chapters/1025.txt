When the Dark Swordmaster was exposed, black smoke was released from its armor, like thousands of wriggling centipedes lunging for Mo Fan.

These centipedes had incredibly strong devouring power. If they struck a living creature, not even bones would be left behind. They chased after Mo Fan crazily, hungering to tear every bit of Mo Fan’s flesh off.

These black smoke centipedes could eat anything. They could even devour the Calamity Fire. Mo Fan immediately withdrew when he realized it was most likely the Dark Swordmaster’s trump card!

The Dark Dark Dueling Ground was actually a lot more spacious than it seemed. It turned out to be a compressed space, thus Mo Fan abused the Space Element to distance himself from the black worms.

Blink!

In the past, Mo Fan was extremely jealous of Ai Jiangtu’s calm and cool demeanor when blinking around. He immediately felt excited and incredible when he was blinking around with Flame Belle Empress’ power. If he could actually move around like this with his own magic, it would greatly improve his strength too!

There was no end to the black worms. The Dark Swordmaster seemed to have spent all the dark energy inside its body. The whole Dark Dueling Ground was crawling with black smoke centipedes. There were so many of them that they were already spinning like a whirlwind in the air...

The tornado of black worms slowly descended to the ground. It was so huge that there was simply no room to escape from it.

The black worm tornado approached rapidly. Mo Fan raised his head, disgusted by the sight of countless worms densely packed together and wriggling in front of him.

Mo Fan glanced over to the Dark Swordmaster and realized that the undead had disappeared. All that was left was the broken armor. There was no sign of its flesh.

“So these black worms are actually your true form!” Mo Fan laughed hollowly.

The creature was undead and a Darkness Creature, after all. No matter how noble and imperious it looked on the surface, it would never get rid of its ghastly, disgusting true appearance.

A few of the black worms were screeching above Mo Fan’s head. The tornado had almost landed on the ground!

Mo Fan lifted his arms slowly, lifting the ocean of Calamity Fire scattered around him.

The raging flames rose above Mo Fan’s head and collided with the tornado of black worms...

Countless black centipedes started falling from the tornado. They fell into the flames and were burned into ashes. The black centipedes were tearing at the flames at the same time, and the size of the ocean of flames kept on shrinking...

Not long after, the black centipedes gained the upper hand. They had managed to devour all of Mo Fan’s Calamity Fire and put out the sea of flames, but as new flames were summoned as reinforcements, the black centipedes ended up as burning fuel, helping the flames to grow and burn more fiercely!

The fire started rising, like a special troop breaking through the defense and tearing a huge hole in the enemy’s formation.

By focusing on the hole torn into the pattern, the flames surged wildly and set even more black centipedes on fire. The flames spread from one centipede to the other, and soon a huge chunk of them was burned beyond recognition. The coiled-up corpses started falling like rain.

These black centipedes were the main form of the Dark Swordmaster, so Mo Fan would not allow a single one of them to live. As the fire was rising, Mo Fan moved into the air and appeared in the center of the tornado of black centipedes!

“Fire Demon Drawing!”

A ring of blazing red fire appeared around Mo Fan, but it suddenly grew significantly, now big enough to cover the entire dueling ground!

Inside the ring of fire, lines of brown fire intertwined and swiftly combined into a formidable drawing of a fire demon!

The drawing suddenly erupted in flames and turned into an astonishing picture of burning clouds. The temperature within the clouds flared beyond the limit of the worms, evaporating the black centipedes still struggling vigorously in the flames in an instant!

The black centipedes cried out in terror, and tried to make their way back to the broken armor.

Once the armor was filled up, the Dark Swordmaster rose to its feet again. It was searching for its enormous sword in a panic.

It was obvious that the Dark Swordmaster had suffered serious injuries. Its imperious aura from before was gone, even its enormous sword had lost its luster.

Flame Belle Empress cried out, telling Mo Fan that the effects of the Time Liquid were wearing off. He had to eliminate the Dark Swordmaster as soon as possible.

Mo Fan nodded. The Dark Swordmaster was clearly at its limit, it was about time for him to send it off to the Underworld. The brutal creature had been alive for countless years, and the number of innocent lives that died at its hands was uncountable, too!

Mo Fan raised his head. His eyes flickered with both red and silver lights.

“Scorching Sun!”

A light suddenly appeared right above the Dark Swordmaster. Not long after, the light started to fall rapidly as a blinding, brilliant sun.

The sun was wrapped in a silver brilliance. It was clearly strengthened by the magic of the Space Element!

The Dark Swordmaster was fully aware of the terrifying force approaching it, yet was struggling to move at all. It could only watch the shocking sun falling onto it!

The brilliant sun landed as heavily as a giant mountain. The heat wave it stirred up was over a hundred meters high. It even left a spectacular pit behind, with flames burning fiercely within it.

The Dark Swordmaster was instantly smashed into a puff of black smoke, which was also set aflame by the scorching heat, giving the creature no chance of surviving!

A black helmet rolled across the ground and stopped in front of Mo Fan’s feet. The helmet was the Dark Swordmaster’s head. He could barely see its hollow eyes through the gaps. They were no longer showing disdain, but a hint of dissatisfaction that was slowly dimming!

——

“Is...is it dead?” Super Mage Sherlock stared at the Dark Dueling Ground. His astonishment was fully on display with his blank expression.

The Dark Contract slowly vanished, together with the walls of the dueling ground. Except for the ravines and scorch marks across the place, the area had claimed its initial appearance!

Mo Fan was still engulfed in the Calamity Fire, showing the Soul Shadow of the Flame Belle Empress. He stood there and watched the energy of darkness that had been dominating the human army disperse slowly.

The Flame Belle Empress came out of Mo Fan’s body. Mo Fan could see her fatigue on her face.

The power that the Time Liquid contained was not Little Flame Belle’s own power, after all. Mo Fan was heartwarmed when he saw Little Flame Belle trying her very best. “Go take a nap! In the future, you will surely be a lot stronger than you are now, defeating an incompetent Ruler-level creature like this will be as easy as blowing a single breath for you!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mo Fan was feeling more confident in Little Flame Belle’s potential. He believed the actual strength of the Flame Belle Empress was far more impressive than what he had seen so far.

Even Ruler-level creatures were ranked differently, based on their strength. The Dark Swordmaster was like a child compared to the Mountain Zombie and the Black Totem Snake. Mo Fan strongly believed that the real Flame Belle Empress was most likely a Supreme Ruler, whose strength could make a whole country tremble!

“We won, we won the battle!” Old Mage Mudin was in tears.

Looking around them, the number of undead was as overwhelming as usual, but everyone clearly knew that the victory was theirs the moment the Dark Swordmaster was eliminated.

“Don’t celebrate yet, the Dark Swordmaster is dead, but the mirage is still...” Wankos was calmer than everyone else, but he suddenly saw rays of white light rising not far away in the middle of his speech!

The white rays rose into the sky and landed on the eerie-looking pyramid!

Since it was only a mirage, when the light passed through it, the whole pyramid started to blur.

The image started to blur and contort, and the magnificent pyramid slowly dispersed, together with the eerie glow dying the moon red...

Without it, the undead were like fish out of water.

It did not matter how enormous the army of undead was, or what level the undead were; losing the light was like losing oxygen for the undead. They started to retreat and search for their real territory!

Fenna was covered in dried bloodstains. Her face was so dirty that it was hard to recognize her.

She stood high up and watched the undead retreat like a tide. Knowing that the battle had finally come to an end, she fell to the ground feebly.

“Your blood is not in vain, we...we’ve won!” Tears ran down and washed away the filth on her face. The joy originated from her heart; the blood of her subordinates that had been killed in this battle was not shed in vain!

—

“Mo Fan!”

“HAHAHA! We actually won the battle, we won!”

“Mo Fan, please accept my knees; you even killed the Dark Swordmaster, why the heck do you even bother taking part in the World College Tournament? Just lead an army in a war, and kill all the demon creatures that dare infiltrate our land!”

Everyone went up and surrounded Mo Fan, who was the greatest contributor among them.

Being able to win the battle was an honor that they could boast about for the rest of their lives. It was in fact comparable to achieving a good result in the World College Tournament. They would soon be commended by the World Magic Association, which would surely be of great value to these young Mages. It was important for them to earn their reputation, as it could lead to being appointed as officials with great power and being given more resources!

“Thank you so much! You will always be welcomed as the most honorable guest by Egypt and Puccini City!” Fenna went up to Mo Fan. Her tears had not even dried yet.

“I only did what I should,” Mo Fan replied.

Mo Fan was a man with a heart and soul. When he believed it was something he was supposed to do, he would not hesitate to do it!
