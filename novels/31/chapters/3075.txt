3076 The Nine Holy Shadows

Mu Ningxue’s words rang throughout Holy City and stirred up the people in the city.

The people were in the Reflective Holy City as they witnessed everything. Holy City’s greatness and prosperity over thousands of years had brought them a sense of supremacy and security. But who would have thought there would come a day a woman with long silver hair would turn the magnificent Holy City upside-down?!

Meanwhile, on the dome of the Holy Palace, Michael, who had been fighting back the backlash of the divine oath, opened his eyes. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He did not expect the first person to draw their sword at Holy City and start the massacre would be a woman. Moreover, the woman was once expelled from the city. How ridiculous it was!

Neither did Mu Ningxue show her respect for the world’s most powerful city, nor for the world’s ten greatest organizations. Who exactly was she? She was totally unreasonable!

“Holy Shadows, Heavenly Order!”

Chief Holy Shadow Fahl suppressed the anger in her heart as she waved her hand at the Holy Shadows and gave her order.

Able Angels were very powerful.

Even though their level of strength had not reached the realm of the archangels, they were powerful compared to the supreme mages in the world who had been cultivating hard in their magic.

The Able Angels were capable of killing the Forbidden Mages, chasing after the emperor-level creatures, and wiping out the troublemakers.

They were executioners who lived in the shadows of Holy City and were capable of stirring up troubles in any country.

Nine figures appeared on the plowed First Avenue, including Holy Shadow Simmons. They surrounded Mu Ningxue. Some of them stood on the ground, some of them floated in the air, and some of them glowed in the Golden Light Wheel. They were prepared to lay their hands on Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue did not bother with them. She continued walking in the direction of the Holy Palace.

Fahl stood on the lengthy steps of the Holy Palace. She was a Penal Angel and had ten wings.

When she spread her wings, they were as stunning as a peacock spreading its feathers. She revealed much of her perfect, pearl-black skin from her colorful robe. The contrast accentuated Chief Holy Shadow Fahl’s nobility and uniqueness. Her imposing aura went beyond human imagination!

Mu Ningxue walked toward the tanned woman. The nine Holy Shadows followed her. Their formation remained.

Mu Ningxue ignored the Holy Shadows. They were as weak as Holy Shadow Clark whom she had killed in the lake at the silver-gray forest.

The ten-winged angel was the only one who could go in her way. Besides, it was clear to see that Fahl had a high ruling position in Holy City.

“Woman, do you truly think you are invincible just because you’ve slaughtered some of the small fries? Lest forget you’re in Holy City, and we’re the exalted Holy Shadows!” said Holy Shadow Conner.

Conner stood before Mu Ningxue. However, she never rested her gaze on Conner.

Holy Shadow Simmons stood beside Conner. Both of them were arrogant but in very different manners.

“Simmons, why are you looking everywhere? Don’t you have any intention to fight? Don’t show pity on her just because she’s a beauty. Don’t forget that she has killed many people. She’s a venomous woman. She’s an unforgivable heretic!” Holy Shadow Conner noticed Simmon’s hesitancy.

“Don’t be careless. She has an emperor-level White Tiger with her,” said Holy Shadow Simmons, who had drenched in sweat.

In fact, Simmons had not forgotten his close contact with the emperor-level White Tiger even to that day.

“What White Tiger are you talking about? Would a tiger simply wreak havoc in Holy City? Don’t forget we have an enormous Light Dragon in the city,” said Conner disdainfully.

Right after Simmons spoke, he sensed an aura that belonged to a beast. The aura came from the middle of the street. Simmons could not be more familiar than it when he met its cold gaze. The White Tiger had been somewhere near Mu Ningxue from the beginning. It had been laying its eyes begrudgingly on each and every one of them!

It would lunge at the person who made the first move!

Simmons immediately warned the Holy Shadows upon noticing the White Tiger.

“You’re very powerful, but you’ve made the wrong decision by challenging Holy City!” said the Holy Shadow glowing in the Golden Light Wheel.

His golden sacred wheel interwoven by blazing light turned into a heavenly splitting divine blade. The Holy Shadow slashed at Mu Ningxue’s back. The tip of his blade was so bright that it was brighter than Holy City’s Tower of Light. When the Holy Shadow landed its blade, it stirred up layer upon layer of golden waves and impacted the earth and the buildings.

“Sandro, be careful of the White Tiger!” Simmons shouted.

“White Tiger? What?!” Conner asked in puzzlement.

Right after he spoke, both Conner and Simmons saw a white figure flash before them. Its exaggerated speed was nothing more than a flash. If they did not pay attention to it, they would not have noticed a wild beast barging into the middle of the streets.

The speed of the Golden Sacred Wheel Blade was fast too. However, its speed of landing was slower compared to the White Tiger. The White Tiger raised its paws high and slapped Holy Shadow Sandro away.

At that moment, the ripples in the air exploded along the White Tiger’s powerful attack. Sandro was sent flying away under the protection of his Golden Sacred Wheel. Sandro fell into a pile of corpses in the ravine in the First Avenue alley. He originally wanted to slash Mu Ningxue with his Light Wheel Heavenly Blade but had mistakenly slashed other streets. As a result, many ancient buildings collapsed.

“What is that monster?!” Conner and the other Holy Shadows cried out in surprise.

Sandro was sent flying too far away. No one knew if he was alive or dead. It was only at that moment that the Holy Shadows realized Mu Ningxue was not the only one who had barged into Holy City. In fact, the white creature had laid its eyes on all the Holy Shadows.

No wonder Mu Ningxue was so fearless!

“It’s an emperor-level creature!

“It’s an emperor-level White Tiger!”

Simmons repeated his words.

He had been locating the White Tiger so that he could warn those who had been targeted by it. However, the White Tiger reacted so fast that it would not help much even if he told Sandro about it.

After the White Tiger attacked Sandro, it immediately lunged at the Holy Shadow behind Mu Ningxue. The Holy Shadow was able to save himself in the middle of the chaos, but he had to cry for help from other Holy Shadows.

The emperor-level White Tiger’s murderous power was threatening. The weak Holy Shadows could not fight back against it.

Strictly speaking, a Holy Shadow was not a real Forbidden Mage. They obtained power that was close to a Forbidden Mage through Holy City’s ancient secret spell. Once they failed to summon the ancient secret spell in time or failed to perform the spell in panic, an emperor-level creature could kill them in seconds.

Holy Shadow Sandro had little defense, hence it was unlikely for him to survive the White Tiger’s attack.
