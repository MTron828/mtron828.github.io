Mo Fan immediately felt the pressure.

The guy was no ordinary person indeed if he dared to act so recklessly in front of the Saintesses of the Parthenon Temple. Mo Fan was not afraid to fight Tuis in a duel, but he had to challenge Tuis in his area of expertise!

“Izisha has suddenly won the support of the people. Xinxia will be under great pressure if we don’t work harder,” Mu Bai noted for him.

“Old Zhao, can you find a way to tackle the Spatial Cracks? It’s just a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan. We’ll take down another one that is taller than a hundred meters!” Mo Fan prodded him.

“What’s with the rush? I’m not done drinking,” Zhao Manyan answered indifferently.

“Now is not the time to drink. Time to get back to work. Mu Bai is already so weak. Do you want to see him suffering from sexual impotence for the rest of his life?” Mo Fan said loftily.

Mu Bai’s face darkened. Why did they always come back to that? His body was weak, not his kidneys!

——

Poseidon soon held an emergency meeting. He praised Tuis at the start of the meeting. Tuis wore a smug look throughout the meeting, disgusting Mo Fan.

“Mo Fan, I hope you can work harder. I’ve already reported everything back to Great Muse Valentine. She will judge the outcome of the competition between you two,” Poseidon said.

“My target is the culprit of Green Sprouts Island,” Mo Fan shrugged.

“The kill serves as a warning to the Tyrant Titans. I doubt they are going to stir up trouble in our territory anytime soon,” Poseidon reminded him.

Mo Fan did not respond. He was currently at a disadvantage. It was meaningless to talk too much.

Poseidon did not dwell on the topic, either. He concluded the operation that had successfully killed the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan and proceeded to focus on other Blue Star Tyrant Titans.

“Don’t call me if it’s a Blue Star Tyrant Titan. I don’t want to waste my time on those petty creatures,” Tuis sniffed.

“Mo Fan, if you can’t handle the Silver Moon Tyrant Titans, why don’t you help us with the Blue Star Tyrant Titans? It’s better than doing nothing. After all, the knights are well aware of your strength,” Golden Sun Knight Lucas mocked him.

“We are willing to help regardless of the Tyrant Titan’s kind. Please share the information you have with us so we can eliminate every potential threat,” Mu Bai immediately replied on behalf of Mo Fan.

“Very well,” Poseidon nodded. He was pleased with their attitude.

After the meeting, Tuis, who was so flattered during the meeting, walked past Mo Fan with a proud grin. He was wiping his hands with a handkerchief.

“It seems like you will soon kneel before the altar of my clan. I must remind you that the Blue Stars Tyrant Titans aren’t easy targets either. It’s no use bringing two pieces of trash with you. Why don’t you request a troop of Battlemages?” Tuis taunted them.

——

Zhao Manyan was frustrated with Tuis’ comment when they returned to the inn.

“It’s fine if he was scolding Mu Bai for being useless, but he was scolding me too! That son of a b**ch!” Zhao Manyan snarled.

Mu Bai had no time to waste on the angry Manyan. He was reading the information about the Blue Star Tyrant Titans they had received from the military.

“Why are you bothering to read the information? Are we seriously going to hunt Blue Star Tyrant Titans?” Zhao Manyan said.

“Can you use your brain for once?” Mu Bai said.

“It’s better than not having functioning kidneys!” Zhao Manyan shot back.

“Old Zhao, enough grumbling. Mu Bai has done the right thing, agreeing to hunt down the Blue Star Tyrant Titans. You saw what happened to the Red Pine Hunter Group. There were two Tyrant Titans on the island, a Blue Star Tyrant Titan and a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan. It means we have a chance to find the Silver Moon Tyrant Titans through the Blue Star Tyrant Titans,” Mo Fan pointed out.

Mo Fan had figured out Mu Bai’s intentions when he agreed they would help hunt the Blue Star Tyrant Titans. Tuis clearly had the upper hand for now. He would be treated as a sore loser if he tried to argue with Poseidon!

“But even if we catch eight Blue Star Tyrant Titans, it’s still nowhere close to killing a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan,” Zhao Manyan reminded them.

“Then we’ll kill ten or twenty of them. The Blue Star Tyrant Titans are not as good at concealing their presence. We have plenty of clues about their whereabouts. Tuis is an arrogant man. He won’t bother hunting ordinary Tyrant Titans... we can only rely on quantity since we don’t have his capabilities,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan knew when to put on airs and when to act sensibly. He did not think killing the Blue Star Tyrant Titans was embarrassing. The culprit of Green Sprouts City was still on the loose. If he did not act fast, Tuis was surely going to win the competition!

“Fine, we’ll go with the military tomorrow.” Zhao Manyan was not foolish, either.

“The military is making a move tonight, but they are short-handed. Only a few Blue-Star Knights are with them,” Mu Bai noted for them.

“Let’s do it, and show them the courage we had when we were invading the Pyramid!”

——

The wind was a little cool in spring. Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai dragged a piece of turf over their heads and waited patiently for the Blue Star Tyrant Titans to show up.

“Airplane.”

“I’m not taking it.”

“Chain.”

“My cards are better than you. HAHA, I’ve been waiting for your Chain...”

“I’ve had enough. Damn it, didn’t they say the Blue Star Tyrant Titan would show up here? It’s almost morning. We’ve been playing cards for the whole night.”

The wind started blowing again, blowing the cards into the sky. A sexy Queen flew above the trees and followed the wind to nowhere.

However, it suddenly stuck to something when it was about to fly into the distance.

It looked like the card was stuck to a wall, even though the wind was still blowing. It was moving horizontally without spinning like it normally would in the wind.

Its abnormal behavior took Mo Fan by surprise, but he immediately constructed a silver Star Constellation when he realized something. The silver magic encapsulated Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai.

A huge foot fell from the sky and stomped down on the area where Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai had been playing cards, leaving a deep hole behind. Even the sturdy layer of soil nearby had cracked apart!

“Oh my, that thing is better at hiding than us!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The ambusher had stumbled into an invisible tank. The stomp would have flattened them if Mo Fan had not noticed it first!

“Prepare to fight!” Mo Fan readied himself.

“Blue Star Tyrant Titan, sixty meters tall. Be careful,” Mu Bai decisively backed away. He was unfit for battle with his current condition.
