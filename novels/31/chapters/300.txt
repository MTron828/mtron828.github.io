Chapter 303: The Evil Battlemages

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

The group of students felt a surge of numbness across their whole bodies!

The Battlemages had always been their protectors in their eyes. They were a symbol of justice and strength.

However, the Battlemages they had stumbled into today could be referred to as devils!

They showed no sign of empathy. The two girls from the Pearl Institute were considered future pillars of the nation. Even if they had different identities, they were still two living humans. Just like many people, they believed they could always trust a Battlemage.

Their lives were lost within the blink of an eye. The eyes of the two close friends were still wide open. They had survived the extreme training of the desolate city. They were even thinking of enjoying themselves a warm bath when they arrived home. Unfortunately, they had stumbled into a bunch of devils wearing the uniforms of Battlemages, who had forced them to bid an everlasting farewell to the world!

“It’s a storm cloud, watch out!”

Someone among the group cried out, which prompted the group to glance upward. They saw a giant stormy cloud appearing in the sky above them.

A series of lightning bolts flickered within the stormy cloud. Their speed was not as rapid as Mo Fan’s Thunderbolt, but he had somehow sensed overwhelming Lightning energy rumbling inside the cloud.

“It’s a third-tier Thunderbolt! Dodge it quick!” Mo Fan let out a scream.

Following his cry, a loud clap of thunder echoed in the clear sky.

The sky was already well-lit, but as the lightning struck downward, it further illuminated the surroundings!

A rapid lightning arc struck mercilessly down on Zhao Manting’s head.

Zhao Manting used his fastest speed to cast the Sacred Shield Protection. A golden light shield was summoned to protect himself.

Another lightning arc descended from the sky. This time, it was targeting Zheng Bingxiao, who was already severely injured. There was no way he could defend himself in his current condition.

The eyes on his scorched face opened wide. He could see the lightning arc falling right onto him.

BANG!

Zheng Bingxiao, who had just barely survived his previous injuries, instantly turned into a crimson shower. It was impossible to differentiate between the flesh and blood.

It splattered onto Zhao Manting’s body, who was standing right beside him. His eyes were open wide as they filled with fear for the very first time.

Did the bloody mess on his face, his clothes, and under his feet all belong to Zheng Bingxiao?

A night ago, Zhao Manting was still fairly impressed by Zheng Bingxiao when he Summoned his Giant Earth Fusion Golem. However, he had now turned into a bloody mess.

The lightning arcs continued to drop onto the group of students at an increasing pace. It was most likely due to two Lightning Magicians casting Thunderbolt simultaneously.

The Lightning Strikes wildly attacked the group of students continuously.

Most of the students possessed a few pieces of equipment which could protect themselves for a brief moment. However, the power of the third-tier Thunderbolts was way too overbearing for them to handle. Eventually, the Lightning Strikes began to shatter their defensive equipment into pieces...

“Help, someone...AH!!!”

A lightning arc struck Xu Dalong’s arm. His bulky body was disintegrated instantly, just like Zheng Bingxiao.

Rains of blood poured down on the group. They showered over Lu Zhenghe, who was already fully stained with fresh blood.

Lu Zhenghe’s face was smeared with blood from his teammates Qingqing, Zhao Mingyue, and Xu Dalong.

His whole body was trembling. He did not even have the courage to look at Lu Nian’s face.

Lu Nian had always been a close brother to Lu Zhenghe. His brother was extremely caring of him. He would always find a way to get the things he desired. Since Lu Zhenghe had lost his father in the early years, he had seen his brother Lu Nian as half a father.

However, he never thought his brother was such a demented murderer.

Lu Nian had asked him to leave signals along their journey. He told him that he was on a critical mission, so Lu Zhenghe had agreed without hesitation. He had left the signals along their journey so Lu Nian could track them down.

To his surprise, his brother was here to butcher them all!

Was he still the brother he knew?

“Idiot. What are you waiting for? Do you want to die with them too?” Commander Lu yelled.

Lu Zhenghe was scared to die, especially when he saw his friends dying beside him.

Even though he could not believe that his brother was a murderer, he subconsciously obeyed the order given by the man who had raised him. He believed that he would not harm his own little brother.

Lu Zhenghe turned around and glanced at Mu Ningxue. He was planning to bring her with him.

However, a bolt of ferocious lightning struck the ground beside him, as another targeted Mu Ningxue. Lu Zhenghe hesitated when he saw Bai Tingting falling to the ground after losing her defensive equipment.

“Come here at once!” Lu Nian snapped.

The roar was like an order to Lu Zhenghe. He finally turned around and ran toward the Battlemages.

He clearly knew that he would be massacred just like his friends if he did not start running.

“Trying to escape? I’ll drag you with us since we’re all going to die!” Mo Fan was infuriated. He finished casting the Lightning Strike in an instant.

From the midst of the lightning arcs, Mo Fan aimed his Lightning Strike at the fleeing Lu Zhenghe. It was significantly thicker than a normal third-tier Lightning Strike. The dark purple arc quickly conducted across the ground and caught up to Lu Zhenghe’s feet.

Lu Zhenghe did not see it as a threat. How could an insignificant basic level Lightning Strike do any harm to him?

However, when the thick lightning arcs crawled onto his body like crackling pythons, the paralysis effect was double that of an ordinary Lightning Strike. It completely locked him down, to his disbelief.

Even if Mo Fan had a Spirit-grade Lightning Seed, it was impossible for a basic level Lightning Strike to have such power.

Lu Zhenghe could not move at all. He looked helplessly at his brother Lu Nian with a pale face, hoping that he would come and save him.

Unfortunately, someone else was faster.

Mu Nujiao had finished casting her Plant Magic. Her vines quickly tangled Lu Zhenghe’s legs while he was still paralyzed by Mo Fan’s Lightning.

The vines instantly dragged Lu Zhenghe back, slamming right into Mo Fan’s body, which was engulfed in flames.

Mo Fan had thoroughly transformed into a blazing demon. He furiously grabbed Lu Zhenghe’s neck. The fury in his eyes was on the verge of bursting out.

“Son of a bitch, ask your people to stop the attacks. Otherwise, I’ll burn him to death alive!” The flames on Mo Fan’s body became even more vigorous, as if they were going to lunge at Lu Zhenghe in the next second.
