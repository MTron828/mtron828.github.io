Chapter 2685: The Five Elders Work Hand-in-hand

“What kind of miracle pill did he take to gain such supernatural power?!” Elder Shou’s voice was full of awe and puzzlement. He was jealous of Mo Fan.

The world was scarce in resources. Whenever a valuable gemstone was uncovered, the upper class of the city would fight amongst themselves and take it. Gemstones that had not been mined yet in the primitive lands belonged to the demon king. It was close to impossible to grab the resources from large hordes and great empires through a fight.

“He does not have anyone powerful supporting him. Neither does he have significant networks or financial resources. Even so, he is already at this level! We must get rid of people like him. He is a potential threat that could cause us huge trouble in the future,” Elder Pang said fiercely.

Nanrong Xu did not want to confront Mo Fan head-on while he was at his strongest. He resolved to retreat for now and instead seek the three guests of the Zhao family.

The three guests were helping the Divine Hunter Group to deal with Mu Ningxue. The woman with the Bronze Bow from the Divine Hunter Group showed promise and strength and everyone thought she was a match even against Mu Ningxue. However, it did not take long for her stamina to run out. Mu Ningxue, on the other hand, grew ever so strong with her ice magic as the battle progressed.

The trio frowned. They glanced at Mu Ningxue before turning to look at Mo Fan. These two people were outrageously powerful. They did not fight like new mages. Instead, they were like seasoned mages who had fully mastered Fire and Ice Element already. They proved to be capable of fighting an entire army of mages by themselves!

“If we join the fight, what should we do with Mu Ningxue? We can’t possibly let her slaughter our men,” said one of the guests of the Zhao family.

He was Master Bai Song. He was the one who tested most talents of the Zhao family and chose them based on their potential to achieve great things. Master Bai Song was highly regarded in the Zhao family. In fact, Zhao Manyan’s father wanted his son to be Master Bai Song’s disciple. But Master Bai Song had disliked the boy on account of his laziness and his laid-back attitude that he expelled the boy from his tutelage.

Zhao Manyan’s father had sent him to Pearl Institute in desperation, hoping that the boy could study on his own. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Master Bai Song was the strongest among all. He had even managed to minimize the area of effect of Mu Ningxue’s Heavenly Ice and Earth Crystal magic. If not for him, the entire area would have been covered in glacier half an hour ago.With one side covered in glacier, and the other reduced to a boiling pot of magma, the disciples would have been long dead.

“I can take on Mu Ningxue for now. Please help Zhao Jing,” Nanrong Xu said.

Mo Fan was much stronger than even Mu Ningxue. He fought like a giant trampling on puny ants. The other forces had formed groups of mages to take on the experts from Fanxue Mountain but it was of no use. If anyone even tried to get close, Mo Fan’s divine fire burned them to ashes.

“Alright,” said Master Bai Song. “Do not underestimate your enemy. I believe she has stronger spells at her disposal.”

Master Bai Song was very close to the Nanrong family. He did not want anything to happen to Nanrong Xu.

“Don’t worry, Master,” said Nanrong Xu. “I have my younger sister by my side. Also, Mu Ningxue might not really be a match for me. ‘

Master Bai Song glanced at Nangrong Ni. Without him noticing, she had already drawn close to her brother. She fixed her unwavering gaze on Mu Ningxue, already ready for a fight, as if she had a long-standing feud with her that needed to be settled.

“We have some secret spells with us. We can’t really show our power in Mu Ningxue’s territory. Her inborn talent is too powerful,” Master Bai Song said.

“Hehe… why don’t we prepare ourselves with some secret spells to handle Mu Ningxue?” Nanrong Xu smiled.

The three guests moved from the freezing place to the scorching hot side which would be their new battleground. The Flame Demon King was still floating in midair, like a dazzling sun with an intent to set the whole earth on fire. Those who tried to get closer to him were reduced to ashes.

“These two are monsters,” Master Lan Zhu mumbled.

In the realm of ice and fire, those without Super Level cultivation could not stay long in the battle, let alone fight with the duo. The elites they had brought from the clans could only fight with the members of Fanxue Mountain. They could not really join in and fight people like Mu Ningxue and Mo Fan.

“Judging from Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue’s level of cultivation at such a young age, they must have followed the problematic path. The world is huge and the Holy Judgment Court and Heresy Judgement Court might not have been able to eliminate all demonic and evil magic. When I was cultivating in Africa, I heard about the cruel sacrifices that Egyptian mages made by stealing human souls to improve their cultivation by leaps and bounds!” said Elder Shou from the Nanrong family.

“I used to work in the Holy Judgment Court a few decades ago. I think something is wrong with Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue. I wonder how many people they have killed for such power!” said a woman from among the three guests of the Zhao family. She was Master Qing Lan.

“We have to get rid of such demonic and disastrous magic. We should stop holding back and unleash our power to end this catastrophe before they hurt someone else!” said Eder Pang with righteous rage.

The five elders were already in their fifties and yet they spoke with such heroic spirit of preparing to contribute and sacrifice themselves for the sake of the people. Zhao Jing was amused that they had come here to seek comfort from him when they had subjected him to so much abuse and mistreatment.

No wonder he could not dabble into the realm of Forbidden Curses in this life. Zhao Jing paid no mind to their shallow declaration. He came here to rob this place and take what he wanted. He did not care about his dignity or reputation.Once he entered the realm of Forbidden Curses, even the most heinous devil could become a saint!

Elder Pang, Elder Shou, Master Bai Song, Master Lan Zhu, and Master Qing Lan were notable Super Level experts. They resisted using their spells and magic because of their own reputation. They only wanted to get rid of Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue. But their power had threatened the elders and the masters so they no longer wanted to hold themselves back.

They had not expected a full-blown battle. They had thought this was just a silly skirmish between the youngsters and came to serve as an audience. But now the five respectable mages realized how powerful their opponents were. They panicked a bit and wanted to act before the situation got out of their control.

“Zhao Jing, you’ve been too reckless. Luckily, Elder Shou and the rest of us are here.” Master Bai Song chastised Zhao Jing.

“Is there anyone else here who is powerful enough to… scare us?”

“Obviously no. Even though Mo Fan is at his strongest right now, we can tire him out and destroy him!” Master Bai Song’s face lit up with determination.

They were the key people in this battle. With them here, there was no way Fanxue Mountain couldn’t be taken down.
