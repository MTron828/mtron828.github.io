Chapter 2965: Which Is The True Form?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

‘Which letter? Was it the letter that the Cold Hunting King wrote to Lingling, and it took many years before she finally received it?’ Moreover, the letter was received in the form of a commission.

Lingling’s father, The Cold Hunting King, wrote a commission before he fought the Red Demon to death. He had entrusted the experts from the Hunter Union to kill the Red Demon Kazuaki.

But the Red Demon Kazuaki had tampered with the letter of commission. As a result, it took more than a decade before Mo Fan and Lingling finally received it.

“The Red Demon Kazuaki commissioned us to kill the young Red Demon Lu Kun in order to obtain my father’s soul. It fulfilled my father’s last wish with the aim of obtaining one of the Eight Souls, which is the Rightful Soul,” said Lingling.

Mo Fan nodded.

The young Red Demon Lu Kun was no more than one of the Red Demon Kazuaki’s pawns. The Red Demon Kazuaki used it to gain the Cold Hunting King’s Rightful Soul.

“Kazuaki is also one of the Eight Souls. It represents the Righteous Soul. Do you still remember it?” asked Lingling.

Mo Fan nodded. Apas had mentioned that the Red Demon followed the ritual of the Evil Temple Eight Souls. If it were to ascend to become the Wicked God, it had to obtain the souls according to the Eight Souls’ frame!

“I think he has obtained seven souls, except one, which is its Righteous Soul. Otherwise, why would it set its final ascension destination at the Twin Guardian Towers?” said Lingling.

Katana Mochizuki and Tegami Fujikata were beside them as they listened to Lingling’s analysis.

The Righteous Soul…

Kazuaki was indeed a righteous man in the past. When the rest had their hearts being distorted as a result of the Evil Bead’s negative energy, Kazuaki took the Evil Bead away, thus allowing Katana, Fujikata, and their group to resume normalcy. However, he fell and became a Red Demon.

“He sacrificed himself in order to save us,” Katana Mochizuki muttered to himself.

“Since my father owned the Rightful Soul, Kazuaki had to fulfill his last wish to gain his soul. So, what do you think Kazuaki’s last wish is?” Lingling asked Katana Mochizuki and Tegami Fujikata.

“His last wish…” For a moment, Tegami Fujikata did not know how to answer Lingling.

“Those who live inside the Twin Guidance Towers wake up every day to see familiar faces. Despite their tiredness after a long day of work, they smile and greet everyone they see. The elders enjoy their retirement. The peers compete with one another, but they patch things up among themselves. The peers work very hard to grow stronger…” Officer Ozawa spoke up. He spoke in a very solemn voice with a bitter smile on his face.

Upon hearing his words, Mo Fan and Lingling were shocked. They turned around and stared at Officer Ozawa.

‘Could Ozawa be the…’

Just then, Ozawa quickly returned to his senses. He waved his hand. “Don’t get me wrong. I’m not Kazuaki. Back in one of the summers when I was young, my peers went for a vacation with their parents. My parents had to attend to their duties, so they didn’t have time to accompany me. As a result, I spent the time alone inside the Twin Guardian Towers. I didn’t have a friend, and I said something outrageous. I told myself that I will never stay in the Twin Guardian Towers that are no different from a prison.”

“Those words were spoken in the heat of the moment, and Brother Kazuaki overheard them. He talked to me. He took me to the beach and played with me…”

“That summer, Brother Kazuaki taught me a lot of things, and I had a lot of fun. After I came back from school the next summer, I tried to find him, but he had disappeared into thin air. Before we bade farewell, he told me these words. I still remember his words even to this day. All these years, I took his words as a code for conduct. I wanted to turn his words into reality, so I treated the Twin Guardian Towers as my home, I treated everyone inside as my relatives…”

Katana Mochizuki and Tegami Fujikata were inevitably lost in their thoughts upon hearing Ozawa’s words.

He was right. It was because Kazuaki treated each and every one of them as his own relatives that led him to make that decision.

Katana Mochizuki and Tegami Fujikata grew even more remorseful. They regretted their inability to maintain greater composure and sobriety. At that time, the Evil Bead was still not as powerful yet. It was their own greed and selfishness that had led to their downfall!

“That’s why the Red Demon used the Blood Demons to replace everyone inside the Twin Guardian Towers. With that, Kazuaki’s Righteous Soul can live in a made-up dream land to fulfill his last wish.” Lingling finally realized.

This explained why, despite holding a position of importance, Ozawa had not been supplanted by the Blood Demon or had his mind impacted by the Evil Gang’s.

Kazuaki saw his own reflection in Ozawa. If not for the fact that Kazuaki had been consumed by the Red Demon, he would have lived inside the Twin Guardian Towers and managed the towers in silence, just like Ozawa.

“If Ozawa is not the Red Demon, who else can it be?” Lingling was deep in her thoughts.

According to Ozawa’s words, the Red Demon Kazuaki would most likely impersonate him. After all, Ozawa’s current life was all that it wanted. However, Ozawa was not affected by it, thus it was clear that he was not the Red Demon.

And even if Ozawa were the Red Demon, he would not have taken Mo Fan and Lingling into the East Guardian Towers. This would only ruin its plan. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I still have doubts. Since the Blood Demons have replaced all the people inside the towers, why doesn’t the Red Demon just kill them? Why did it have to imprison them inside the East Guardian Towers?” asked Mo Fan.

“The Red Demon transformed the prisoners into Blood Demons. Unless the Blood Demons’ souls are destroyed, they will trigger the West Guardian Towers’ forbidden system if they leave the towers. Regardless of the people the Blood Demons are impersonating, they can never leave the Twin Guardian Towers. However, Osaka will assess the East Guardian Towers. If they find the number of prisoners becoming lesser, the external authorities will question the Chief. As such, we must replace the prisoners and be imprisoned here so as to avoid being under examination,” said Chief Shigekyo.

“Besides, the Blood Demon is drawing on the information from our memory. If we die, the impersonators may not be able to support the operation of the Twin Guardian Towers. At the end of the day, they are learning to replace us completely,” said Tegami Fujikata.

Mo Fan nodded.

“Mo Fan!” A thought sprang up in Lingling’s mind.

“What?” Mo Fan turned to her.

“If the middle-aged chef is a Blood Demon, and you’ve transformed into him using the Eye of Deception, our identities will be exposed very soon!” cried Lingling.

“Sh*t!” Mo Fan patted his head.

Mo Fan assumed the chef was an ordinary human, hence he cast a mild level of Black Aura to make the chef fall asleep, because he did not want to shorten the chef’s life expectancy. However, if the chef was a Blood Demon, the chef would wake up much faster than he expected!

“We need to get out of here first!” Lingling sensed the seriousness of the matter.

They did not have time to save the Chiefs. If they did not leave the place, they would be trapped inside the East Guardian Towers!

The prison door mechanism in the East Guardian Towers was terrifying. Regardless of how astounding Mo Fan’s power was, the moment his soul energy was sucked away, he would become magically dried up, just like the prisoners!
