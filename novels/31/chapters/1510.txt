1512 Shadow Fiend: Army of Shadows

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

A few Lamias noticed that Mo Fan was setting up his Domain, and could sense the Domain would pose a threat to them. A few Lamias immediately led hundreds of Lesser Lamias towards him!

Mo Fan did not stop channeling his magic. The spell obviously needed a long time to channel without being interrupted.

The Lamias were extremely quick. Their lower bodies were like desert boas, and could wrap around thick trunks and crawl from tree to tree rapidly. Mo Fan soon found himself completely surrounded by them.

Brianca stood aside while channeling her magic. She had no reason to just stand there. Mo Fan’s channeling was too slow, yet he still preferred to charge into the demon creatures. This was one of the main reasons why Mages should maintain their distance from demon creatures!

“Don’t worry about me, Brianca,” Mo Fan grinned when he sensed magic rising beside him.

Brianca looked at Mo Fan’s grin and noticed how relaxed he sounded when he did not address her formally. She hesitated for a moment before finally withdrawing her magic.

Talking and grinning self-assuredly did not affect Mo Fan’s channeling. The Lamias and the Lesser Lamias had already executed their attacks, but Mo Fan’s Flying Creek Snow Wolf had already gone somewhere else...

Flames engulfed Mo Fan suddenly; a brown flame on the inside and an ardent flame on the outside. These flames drifted away from Mo Fan’s body on their own and formed a slender, noble figure...

“Ling!~”

Flame Belle Empress’ voice was even more mature and pleasant now. She came out of the flames and stood in front of Mo Fanm her two Fire Domains spreading rapidly. The imperious flames of the the fiery empress’ outstanding power made the Lesser Lamias and Lamias look like a bunch of clowns!

“Ling!~”

With a pleasant cry, the blazing flames surrounding Flame Belle Empress flickered wildly and formed a fiery barrier around Mo Fan.

The fiery barrier was extremely thin, almost impossible to notice it without taking a close look. The Lamias and Lesser Lamias had no trouble passing through the fiery barrier, yet they suddenly cried out in pain and rolled back and forth on the ground after just a few seconds.

A breath later, they started spitting flames from their mouths. A fire had erupted within their bodies and burned their organs into ashes. Its next target was their flesh and shells!

The shells were quite tough to burn, so most of the Lesser Lamias and Lamias ended up as remnants of scorched shells on the ground after they fell miserably in a huge circle around the Flame Belle Empress...

Not one demon creature survived. Every single one of the creatures that tried to attack Mo Fan could not get close enough to even touch him!

Brianca let out a relieved sigh. It was her first time seeing Mo Fan Summon his Contracted Beast. This clearly explained why Mo Fan was able to defeat Heidi, the Queen of Dimensions, with a single move. With a Commander-level Contracted Beast in the Advancing Period, Heidi might struggle to defeat just her, even if Mo Fan was not involved in the fight!

“Shadow Fiend!” Mo Fan suddenly yelled while Brianca was being impressed by his strength!

The Dark Material had fully penetrated the Lesser Lamias while they were busy fighting the Flame Belle Empress and the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

Every Shadow Fiend was born when Dark Material fully corrupted a creature, and since the Lesser Lamias were a kind of scorpion demon, the Shadow Fiends had a similar appearance now. If the creature looked more like a snake demon, its respective Shadow Fiend had a long body too!

The Swamp of Darkness was incredibly huge; more Lesser Lamias stepped inside the dark swamp every moment. Normally, the Shadow Fiends could only move with their hosts, but the Swamp of Darkness allowed them to move freely within its area!

One after another, Rebelling Shadows crawled out from the Lesser Lamias and the Lamias. They did not have eyes, and their outlines were slightly blurred, like black phantoms that came out of a nightmare. The Lesser Lamias and the Lamias had never seen anything like them before. They were utterly stunned, their eyes going wide!

The Shadow Fiends did not engage their enemies directly, as they were not good at ambushing an enemy. The real threat was the Rebelling Shadows that would only appear after Mo Fan sacrificed Warrior-level or Commander-level Soul Remnants. Since Mo Fan was planning to collect them, he did not want to waste them.

The Shadow Fiends gathered around Mo Fan in the Swamp of Darkness, soon forming a massive army of shadows. Even though they lacked actual flesh, their bodies were huge and their auras were intimidating!

“Shadow Fiend: Army of Shadows!”

The shadows of the Lesser Lamias twisted eerily under Mo Fan’s command. They let out piercing screeches, signaling the army!

Each Lesser Lamia and Lamia that was tainted gave birth to a Shadow Fiend. It felt like Mo Fan had truly Summoned a great army of shadows and phantoms with deadly fangs and claws...

The army of Shadow Fiends charged forward. They did not make a sound as they stomped the ground, nor did they raze the wilted trees to the ground. They were merely a bunch of shadows, but their screeches were absolutely terrifying, and the destructive auras as they charged forward felt so real. The Lesser Lamias and Lamias subconsciously backed away a little. They were utterly confused about where this new army of demon creatures came from!

The Shadow Fiends were silent yet possessed remarkable strength. Black smoke rose from the Swamp of Darkness, further strengthening them. The Lesser Lamias were fleeing for their lives in fear, while the smarter Lamias roared at their enemies angrily!

The sounds of wind slashing through objects occurred simultaneously. The army of shadows rolled forward fearlessly like a strong tide, tearing the Lesser Lamias to pieces. Even those that were standing defiantly were left with countless cuts and wounds!

The damage inflicted by the Shadow Fiends was not in the form of brute force or collision, but the power to drain away life. They were like a grave illness speeding up the death of a living being. Their blows would stop blood from circulating and stiffen the bones. It would also make a pounding heart wilt away like a dead flower!

When this deadly force surged forward in the form of an army, it left nothing but death behind, similar to an army of ants or a plague of locusts!

The Lesser Lamias and Lamias seemed frozen and covered in ice and snow. Their colors shifted tremendously, from brown to gray, then to black. They looked just like the wilted trees nearby!

The Soul Remnants and Soul Essences of the dead creatures floated toward Mo Fan. In his eyes, it was like the forest was full of fireflies gradually moving toward him under the Little Loach Pendant’s control.

Brianca could not see the Soul Remnants and Soul Essences, but she could see the Lesser Lamias and Lamias falling to the ground. The size of the ambush squad dropped by half in an instant. Even Brianca was shocked by the outcome!

Brianca could not help but wonder if Mo Fan was truly just an Advanced Mage after seeing him killing so many demon creatures with a single attack, not to mention how unpredictable his abilities were!

Was there any other Advanced Mage in the world that could crush an entire squad of demon creatures so easily?

“Your Shadow Element...” Brianca uttered in a shocked manner after some time.

Mo Fan’s Shadow Element was ridiculously strong!

It was actually comparable to the Fire and Lightning Elements that were said to be his primary Elements, yet she had never seen Mo Fan use a single Shadow Spell at the Alps Institute. While Brianca knew Mo Fan had Double Innate Elements, she had assumed Mo Fan’s Shadow Element was ordinary. After all, it was unlikely for anyone to cultivate every Element at the same time, let alone Mo Fan, who had five Elements in total!

“Hehe, it’s been a while since I last killed so many demon creatures...” Mo Fan was utterly pleased when he saw the Soul Remnants floating toward him. It was the same feeling a person who had not exercised for a long time being drenched in sweat would feel.

“Heidi is no match for you...” Brianca eventually concluded.

Brianca strongly believed that Mo Fan could even take on some Super Mages after witnessing his strength. Heidi was almost unbeatable at the Advanced Level, yet she had no chance of beating a Super Mage.

Mo Fan was different; the spells of a few of his Elements were already very close to the strength of Super Spells, and his ability to utilize his Elements simultaneously and his quick fighting reflexes made it difficult for some of the Super Mages to take him out!

“She’s a girl, it’s normal for me to go easy on her. Besides, I accidentally saw her naked. I was afraid she might have some bad thoughts if I beat her in the, duel too,” Mo Fan shrugged.

Mo Fan did not really use all of his magic when he was fighting Heidi. He did not use his Fire Element, Shadow Element, or Summoning Element... that being said, Heidi’s Sound Element was Mo Fan’s greatest weakness, so Mo Fan would struggle to take Heidi out in a duel of life and death too!

“We have truly underestimated you,” Brianca admitted.

“Miss Brianca, I’m actually not happy with what you just said. You all keep comparing me to Heidi, but I actually compare myself to you. Why are you treating me like a three-year-old, when you are only a few years older than me?” Mo Fan said.

Four Elements at the Super Level... Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

To be honest, Mo Fan was already a little displeased after learning Herr Casa was the youngest Super Mage in Europe. His dignity was completely ruined when he discovered Brianca’s age, too!

How the hell did she even cultivate!?
