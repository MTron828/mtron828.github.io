Mo Fan was enjoying his time fighting duels, stirring up trouble, cultivating, and teasing the goddesses in his school every day!

Mo Fan had already given Mu Nujiao the best option he could come up with, yet it was up to her to decide if she would listen to him. It was the manliest suggestion he could ever give to her!

However, as her housemate, Mo Fan was familiar with Mu Nujiao’s personality. She would not give up so easily. Hopefully, she would not simply try to achieve some quick success and end up handing herself to the family, as it would be difficult to redeem herself later.

Mu Nujiao did remind Mo Fan of his conversation with Mu Ningxue close to the run-down church at the abandoned city. It was obvious that Mu Nujiao had also borrowed hugely from the family, otherwise her cultivation would not have improved at such a terrifying pace...

Hopefully the loan she took wasn’t too great, or else he would have to pay a great price to redeem her...

At least Xinxia was behaving well; he only needed to pay her school fees and living costs, which she did not even use a lot of. The truth was, she was able to earn her own pocket money with her Healing Element at a crazy rate. The debit card he gave to cover her living expenses probably had more money than it used to have. When she came visiting the month ago, she even bought lots of imported ‘milk powder’ for little Flame Belle. She was already helping to feed the family!

Speaking of money...

Mo Fan felt his heart clenching.

He did not have much of his savings left after spending it on the Flame Belle.

The only thing Mo Fan had left was the Pseudomorphing Demon Beast’s Seed. He was originally going to keep it until later, yet he had no choice but to sell it now. He bought a Shadow Element Soul Seed, and used the rest on Soul Seed Pieces.

After calculating his savings and considering that he would need more money than ever since he now had more wives than ever, he no longer dared to waste his time at home. He immediately gave Lingling a call. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Little girl, got any work to do?”

“We’ll have to leave the city, you up for it?”

“How many days?”

“Around three.”

“That’s fine, my next match is in five days. How much money?”

“Not much, but there’s a lot of demon beasts.”

“Cool, I’m in need of Soul Essences, too.”

Speaking of Soul Essences, Mo Fan had already leveled up twenty-nine of the Stars in his Fire Nebula. He was halfway to getting his fourth-tier Fiery Fist. Therefore, he was fairly eager when there was a quest to kill lots of demon beasts.

——

The Magic City was covered in white fog, which made the tall buildings look like they were floating above the clouds in Heaven.

The same fog loomed over the Pearl Institute; one could hardly see their fingers after reaching their hands out.

Mo Fan had no sense of direction to begin with. When all the landmarks in the spacious school ground disappeared from his vision, he was completely lost in the middle of nowhere.

“F**k, my phone was smashed during the quest. Perfect timing, I can’t even look for help...” complained Mo Fan as he roamed aimlessly around the school ground.

It took him some time to find the dueling ground. His teammates had broken into a sweat before he barely made it in time. They thought he was going to bail on them.

“Lots of people this time.” Mo Fan scanned his surroundings and discovered that the place was bigger than usual. Even the seats were filled, with a higher number of referees than the previous matches.

“Our opponents are strong,” Bai Yulang said to Mo Fan.

The teams were reshuffled after three matches. Mo Fan was in luck this time, as he was on the same team as Bai Yulang.

This Bai Yulang was Gu Jian’s opponent during their second match, and his strength was quite impressive. Mo Fan’s luck was not so bad that he was grouped up with only lower-ranked students.

Mo Fan had already fought two matches with his new team, and won both of them by totally crushing their opponents. The team had a great time working together.

Today was the third match, and it seemed like they were fighting against a strong team.

“Who’s in their team?” asked Mo Fan.

Instead of saying all the names, Bai Yulang only said one, “Dongfang Lie!”

The fog finally cleared slightly, allowing Mo Fan to see a man with a scornful grin sitting on the other side. The man was not tall, and if it weren’t for his reputation, those who saw him the first time would assume him was a hedonistic son from a renowned family. He was none other than Dongfang Lie!

Mo Fan already knew who Dongfang Lie was. When he first came to the Fire School, even Wei Rong purposely called his name out in the hall.

The rankings of the Fire School kept on changing, yet the guy named Dongfang Lie was able to secure his spot in the first rank for a very long time, a clear indication that he was worthy of the rank!

Luckily, Mo Fan’s teammates were fairly strong, thus they still had a chance to win the match.

“No wonder there are so many people here; guess they think the match is going to be exciting.” Mo Fan scanned the surrounding area and saw lots of students ranked highly in their Element Schools.

The match was highly anticipated. Everyone was basically ranked in the top five of their respective Element Schools on both Mo Fan’s team and Dongfang Lie’s team, a true battle between the top elites. A match like this would easily attract those who were interested in researching their potential opponents, while the others were here to enjoy the spectacular duels between the students.

“Take a rest, we’ll start soon,” Bai Yulang reminded the team as the commander.

The other two seemed fairly serious about the match.

Mo Fan was indifferent as usual. He took out his phone to accept a call from Lingling.

“Mo Fan, I’ve transferred the endpoint of your old phone to your new one, don’t hang up yet,” said Lingling.

“The match is starting soon,” said Mo Fan.

“It won’t take long, the data card in your old phone was completely smashed, we have to do it now. Besides, your phone also records the points you’ve accumulated as a Hunter, it will affect your Hunter rank if it were lost... I took a look at your points, you will be a Hunter Master if you continue to work at your current pace, allowing you to accept quests that are more difficult,” Lingling said.

“Alright,” Mo Fan nodded. Once the match started, he would have to leave his phone in his bag.

However, for the sake of his data, he had no choice but to hold it in his hand. He could simply put it back when the referees told him to.

“By the way, it looks like your phone has received some important message, you should take a look at it,” said Lingling.

“What’s it about?” asked Mo Fan.

“I didn’t take a clear look, it looks like it’s something about Zhang Xiaohou, you should check it once it’s transferred to your new phone,” said Lingling.

“Alright.”

After Lingling mentioned it, Mo Fan just realized that it had been a while since the monkey last gave him a call. That guy would usually call him once in a while, to catch up with one another. He wondered how his brother was doing with his mission? Hadn’t it been a month?
