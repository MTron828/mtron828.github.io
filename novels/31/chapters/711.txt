Drinking some alcohol, enjoying the night breeze, listening to some pleasant melodies, the two had a rather enjoyable night.

The highly-anticipated late-night slowly came. The moonlight shone upon the stone bridge like a layer of frost. However, a cloudy veil slowly loomed over the town. A soft flapping sound echoed in the sky above the town. The clear night suddenly turned cloudy, even the river was no longer clear as before...

Mo Fan hardly ever had the chance to go on a holiday, a time without hunting down demon creatures, cultivating, training or being in the presence of magic. He was currently enjoying his vacation with his loved one in a pleasant town, just like an ordinary university student.

Time usually went by faster when it was more enjoyable. Six days were gone fairly quickly. The town seemed to have lots of secrets and interesting things waiting to be discovered, but the two had no choice but to continue during their next visit.

When Mo Fan was about to leave Wuzhen with Xinxia, he happened to spot a few City Hunters at the town entrance. Mo Fan was quite familiar with their logo.

“Did something happen?” asked Xinxia when she saw the City Hunters entering the town in a rush.

“Perhaps,” Mo Fan had no intention to be a busybody. The City Hunters were capable of settling the matter themselves.

——

The two returned to Hangzhou by car. Mo Fan sent Xinxia back to school with a hint of reluctance.

Mo Fan was planning to see her off, yet the authorities were already urging him to report to the national team. He had no choice but to leave Xinxia in the hands of Tang Zhong, Lu Ping, Glorkian, and Digaeus.

“Glorkian, if anyone bullies her there, I’ll hold you responsible!” Mo Fan warned the golden-haired teacher.

“Don’t you worry!” Glorkian gave his promise confidently.

Mo Fan kissed Xinxia on the forehead and smiled, “Call me if you miss me,” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Mmm, you too,” Xinxia nodded.

Mo Fan felt lost, staring at the blue sky on the plane heading to the capital.

Perhaps it was because Xinxia had never been so far away since she came to stay at his home. Mo Fan could not stop worrying, knowing that she was going somewhere far away.

Perhaps his possessive desire toward her was too strong, so he was feeling extremely uncomfortable after parting with her.

On second thought, it was definitely a good thing for her. He would be leaving the country for quite some time. She now had something to keep her busy. It was better than living like a colorful sparrow kept in his overprotective cage...

——

Upon arriving at the capital, the air was still as bad as before. The sky was shrouded by a gray-brown murk, preventing him from seeing the blue sky and the white clouds.

However, Mo Fan was a fairly optimistic person. He was about to embark on his journey of traveling across the world to distribute his seeds. When he remembered that he would be traveling to different countries, visiting some fascinating places, kicking the asses of some foreign dogs who were indulging in their sense of superiority, and picking up some foreign chicks, he could not help but whistle on his way to the national team.

As he arrived at the destination, he immediately saw five aged Magicians with dark expressions standing at the entrance.

One of the advisors was short with a fat belly, and glared at Mo Fan, who was carrying a shoulder bag. He snapped in an unfriendly manner, “So you’re the substitute called Mo Fan!”

“I’m Mo Fan, but when did I become a substitute?” Mo Fan was startled. He looked at Dean Song He in confusion.

Dean Song He was aware of Mo Fan’s situation, thus he smiled as he was about to give him an explanation.

To his surprise, Advisor Feng Li with the tiger stripes on his forehead said coldly, “You should be relieved that you are still a substitute when you joined through the back-door.”

“Mo Fan, you didn’t take part in the final phase of the competition. Even though you have enough votes and nominations, they still can’t make you official because you were absent,” Dean Song He explained to Mo Fan.

“Fine, substitute it is,” Mo Fan shrugged and went over to the other candidates indifferently.

He had only taken a few steps when he was surprised at noticing a few familiar faces.

“Mo Fan, HAHAHA, I was going to say, there’s no way you weren’t on the list! Don’t you forget about the promise between us!” Zhao Manyan was the first to come up to him. His golden hair was perfectly combed!

“Impressive, you actually managed to secure a spot,” Mo Fan patted Zhao Manyan on the shoulder and exclaimed in surprise.

“What is there to be impressed about? He simply relied on the money of his family to secure the votes. He’s no different than a substitute who has joined through the back-door like you,” a voice from among the crowd exclaimed with a strong hint of jealousy.

“There are many people in the team, but only between five to seven of us will be participating in the competition. It’s fine that the extra spots are given to some rich asses. After all, we are supposed to get the best treatment since we are representing the national team in the tournament,” said a woman with a beauty mark near her lips.

Zhao Manyan felt extremely awkward upon hearing the words.

The truth was, he did manage to secure the spot through the financial support of his Zhao Family. The five advisors were clearly aware of it, too. In terms of strength and talents, Zhao Manyan was still a fair distance away from the others who were selected through the standard procedure.

“He’s fairly good-looking, maybe some of the Councilmen have some special interest, HAHAHA...” said a muscular man with a rough appearance.

The man was almost two meters tall. His muscles were about to burst his clothes open. He was like a beast with a human figure. Mo Fan wondered what Elements the man had.

“Brother, it looks like you aren’t too welcome here,” Mo Fan glanced at the three who commented.

The ones that uttered the remarks were a man with a powerful background, the woman with the beauty mark, and the beast-like man.

The others were not too bothered, as it was exactly what the woman with the beauty mark had mentioned. Only between five and seven people would participate in the tournament, but the team that was to go on training consisted of more than ten people. It was expected that someone had joined the team through some other methods.

Zhao Manyan had already made it clear. He was not planning to secure the spot through the school.

However, none of it mattered much to Mo Fan, as long as he was in the team.

The two did not come to earn glory for their country. Their goal was to spread their seeds across the world!

“Considering how handsome and rich I am, it’s normal for people to be jealous. I’m quite used to it already,” Zhao Manyan let out a self-mocking chuckle. Seeing that Mo Fan was didn’t care, he simply ignored the comments from the others.

The two joined the team with arms around each other’s shoulders. However, Mo Fan was surprised when he saw a man and a woman with stern expressions in the team.

The man was not much of a surprise. He was Ai Tutu’s brother, Ai Jiangtu, a Space Element expert. Mo Fan already knew that he was a seeded candidate of the national team, and he would most likely be appointed the captain.

However, Mo Fan was quite surprised to see the woman. He had met her before too, as she was none other than the female Commander he bumped into at the top of the mountain in the Burning Valley, Nanyu!

Nanyu had the same clean, short hair. Her handsome appearance made it easy for people to mistake her gender. It was not because her appearance was leaning towards the masculine, but her stern and imperious aura completely covered up her charm as a woman. Despite that, instead of making her less appealing, it only gave men a stronger urge to pry open her heart.
