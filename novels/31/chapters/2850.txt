Chapter 2851: Sky Splitting Arrow

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Ocean Serpent Demon suddenly went mad, and its tail swung around at the buildings. Steel bars, glass, and cement all turned to powder with the force of the tail.

Eagle-winged Shaoli’s body shone with a purple brilliance, and they formed a gorgeous round shield, protecting the people on the street.

“Savage beast!” Eagle-winged Shaoli’s eyes were fierce. He pointed at the Ocean Serpent demon’s head.

Space splintered from his fingertips, as if infinite energy gathered at a point and then blasted away.

The Ocean Serpent Demon turned its head. The top of its head had fleshy horns like a coral crown. When the splintered space from Shaoli’s fingertips reached its head, the fleshy horns shattered, and blood spewed out.

!!

The Ocean Serpent Demon screamed and panicked. It was scared of Eagle-winged Shaoli.

“Sky Splitting Arrow!”

Eagle-winged Shaoli raised a hand. Black cracks appeared in the air. These cracks were in the shape of crossbow arrows. They hung upside down under the clouds.

The Sky Splitting Arrows flew and left terrifying black scars between the clouds and the street. They all shot at the Ocean Serpent Demon.

The Ocean Serpent Demon had nowhere to hide. The Sky Splitting Arrow was a Chaos Element magic. The strong dimensional power evolving from these Chaos Element cracks could penetrate against the defenses of most scales and thick muscles. The deep-sea cold pond scales of the Ocean Serpent Demon might as well have been made of paper when facing the Chaos Element cracks.

The Ocean Serpent Demon Could not dodge. It was wounded. It bled profusely. A Sky Splitting Arrow pierced through its ass and nailed it to the wall of a dark blue building.

“Wow, that’s amazing!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The Ocean Serpent Demon had been very difficult to fight. It had beaten them no matter how they joined their powers. However, Eagle-winged Shaoli had easily injured it within a few minutes. His every move had been damaging to the Ocean Serpent Demon!

The Ocean Serpent Demon was furious. The Star Bugs stuck to it began to work gradually. It could not regenerate its broken tail which unbalanced the Ocean Serpent Demon when it moved.

This area had many buildings. The Ocean Serpent Demon wanted to rage and rampage. However, it was afraid of the attacks of Eagle-winged Shaoli, so it could only vent its anger on the buildings where humans once lived. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Ocean Serpent Demon began to cry. Low roars from all around them responded to its cries.

“It’s calling other companions from the Ocean Godly Horde. Let’s leave from here!” Eagle-winged Shaoli said to Jiang Shaoxu.

“Shaoli, we can’t leave. We have an important task. We need to go to the Bund,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

Mu Bai walked to them with Song Feiyao. The two of them were seriously injured, but they might still be able to get to the Bund.

“Nonsense! Do you know what’s going on at the Bund? The Forbidden Curse Association is teaming up to fight against an Ocean Godly Horde. It is even more terrifying than all the Ruler-level demons we’ve met. You guys were almost defeated when you tried fighting the Ocean Serpent Demon. What can you do there?” Eagle-winged Shaoli chided them.

“Shaoli, we’re not messing around. We found the Sacred Totem Beast. As long as we find Dean Xiao of the Pearl Institute, we can summon the Sacred Totem Beast,” Jiang Shaoxu explained.

“Forget about the Sacred Totem Beast. Don’t forget how Jiang Shaojun disappeared. Stop mentioning Sacred Totem Beast. I have an important task, so I can’t waste my time here any longer,” said Eagle-winged Shaoli angrily.

“Shaoli, why won’t you believe in Shaojun and me? The Sacred Totem Beast does exist, and we have found it! Although Shaojun died when he looked for the Sacred Totem Beast, he never regretted it. Just like him, I won’t regret it. You can continue to carry out your important task, and we will continue to walk to the Bund. We won’t stop unless we find Dean Xiao.” Jiang Shaoxu also did not want to entertain her bossy cousin any longer.

Eagle-winged Shaoli frowned.

The cry of the Ocean Serpent Demon echoed all around, and the roars of other powerful creatures responded one after another from behind the tall buildings. The roars were getting closer. They would arrive soon.

Eagle-winged Shaoli was not worried about an Ocean Serpent Demon. He could kill them. But if several Ocean Demons of the same level appeared here, he would waste valuable time fighting them.

“I came from the Bund. Dean Xiao of Pearl Institute is there. He assisted us in eliminating the magic disintegration ability of the Cold Moon Demon Lord. Dean Xiao can’t leave the Bund though. The Forbidden Curse Association needs him,” said Eagle-winged Shaoli.

Eagle-winged Shaoli looked at Jiang Shaoxu and Zhao Manyan. These two people were not students from the National Institute. Jiang Shaoxu and Mo Fan, whom he was looking for, were students from the National Institute.

“Dean Xiao needs Mo Fan’s fusion magic to help him break the magic disintegration ability of the Demon Lord. You and Mo Fan know each other. Do you know where he is? I can sense that he is in the west,” said Eagle-winged Shaoli.

“Huh? He needs Mo Fan’s assistance?” Jiang Shaoxu was confused.

“What’s going on?” asked Zhao manyan. “Can you elaborate? We know where Mo Fan is but...”

Eagle-winged Shaoli was overjoyed. He had not expected himself to be this lucky. Jiang Shaoli had a forbidden ability of the Divine Sense of Flying Bird. When he closed his eyes and concentrated, he could see everything the flying birds saw and sensed.

There were birds all over the place, so he could see many things that others could not. Although this ability was considered less powerful than others, there was no other perfect talent when one needed to find, search, hunt and peep.

That was why Eagle-winged Shaoli could easily find Dean Xiao even though he had been hiding his Water Element forbidden ability. So, it was easy for him to find someone.

He used the Divine Sense of Flying Birds to search for thousands of birds, but in the end, he only managed to capture the back of someone escaping on the plain at the east of Helan Mountain foothill from a goose migrating from the west to the east.

He had to find Mo Fan within eight hours. If Mo Fan was somewhere in a cave or a building or any other mysterious realm, it would be difficult to get a hold of his location.
