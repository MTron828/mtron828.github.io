Chapter 2481: Royal Striped Gray Wolf

Translated by XephiZ

The water of the river continued to overflow, turning the towns along it into lakes.

The water was constantly rising, much like a flood, allowing the sea monsters to invade inland and reach out their claws for the towns and the cities.

Humans normally established their habitats close to water sources, so most cities and towns were built along rivers. The Huangpu River wound for a hundred and ten kilometers from the sea to the land. The overall population along it easily exceeded a hundred thousand people!

It was not easy to evacuate all the residents to safety. Even with the help of many of the country’s powerful organizations, they were struggling to take care of everyone.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan followed the river and saw an intersection of rivers around seven hundred meters wide. The water had widened the river by another four hundred meters after overflowing onto and drowning the roads and streets.

Sea monsters could be seen everywhere, whether they were riding huge waves or moving under the floating debris. They were swallowing great mouthfuls of pigs and cattle, causing pools of blood to surface on the water.

A huge red wave was heading toward a factory built close to the river. Its dock was stacked up with containers. The workers had not had the time to drive the trucks away.

The wave knocked over the containers and the trucks, and swept away the factory in an instant. It carried the debris and rolled further into the distance.

A few Mages were caught by the wave, failing to escape it even after using everything they had. They were all devoured by the wave.

“I knew it was a powerful creature. I saw dozens of Mages fighting here, but they all died in such a short amount of time!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Mo Fan knew there were many teachers from the Pearl Institute among the Mages who were fighting the creature.

Most of them were Advanced Mages, but a Ruler-level creature was too strong for them. Many of them had died or sustained serious injuries. There were barely any survivors!

“Mo Fan, Mo Fan…”

Wei Rong’s voice came from behind them. Mo Fan turned around and saw Wei Rong catching up to him. It seemed the man was worried about him.

“The Ruler-level creature has killed everyone here,” Mo Fan told him.

“Stay calm, don’t do anything reckless. I’ve already notified the Hunter Union. A Super Mage is on his way here,” Wei Rong said.

“It might escape by the time help arrives,” Mo Fan replied.

The Red-Eyed Ruler was extremely brutal. The destructive red waves were formed with the blood of the people it had slaughtered. It was not going to stop!

“Didn’t you say it yourself? We should observe and probe our enemy first, and only make our move after learning its strength. We won’t stand a chance against it!” Wei Rong said.

The Red-Eyed Ruler’s lower jaw was bloated, something like a frog’s. Its eyes stuck out of their sockets and were able to rotate in full circles.

The Red-Eyed Ruler suddenly fixed its gaze on Wei Rong, Mo Fan, and Zhao Manyan, who were watching it from the other side of the river.

Its head and body resembled that of a catfish, but it had four muscular limbs to go with them. It looked like a snake with legs, and was able to move freely in water for a distance.

The Red-Eyed Ruler suddenly spread its limbs and ran at them.

The creature charged recklessly and slammed right through a steel bridge. The steel cables did not leave a single scar on the Ruler-level creature!

“Crap, it found us!” Wei Rong was startled.

“It seems to be able to identify between ordinary people and Mages,” Zhao Manyan commented.

The Ruler-level creature was shockingly quick, traveling a thousand meters in the blink of an eye. It was charging at them, its bloody mouth gaping wide open.

Its mouth seemed the same as a catfish, but it split into six petals when it was fully open.

Its throat extended deep inside its body, and it was able to open its mouth to a crazy degree. Its sharp teeth filled all the gaps between its mouth parts. It was a horrifying sight!

Wei Rong forgot to use his magic when he saw the terrifying sight. It looked to him that the Red-Eye Ruler’s mouth was big enough to swallow the entire width of the river. It was like six monsters were leaping at him simultaneously! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A howl rose up as the ghastly mouth seemingly came within inches of them.

A lunar-white rift appeared in front of Mo Fan. A wolf with destructive stripes all over its body dashed out of the rift, leaving twelve afterimages behind it.

BOOM!

The stripes on the Ruler-level wolf erupted into flames. It gathered their power on its limbs!

The wolf spread its limbs like deadly swords that had been refined in scorching lava. It swung its claws with such great force that the river was split in two.

The Red-Eyed Ruler was unable to close its mouth in time.

Dark blue ichor jetted out of the Red-Eyed Ruler’s head and mouth. Two petals of its mouth were sliced right off!

The Red-Eyed Ruler halted in its tracks in mid-river and grabbed its mouth in pain. Blue blood sprayed out wildly between its claws.

Its bulging eyes glared at the glowing wolf!

“A Royal Striped Gray Wolf!”

Wei Rong could not believe his eyes. The fear paralyzing him was completely replaced by shock.

The creature that appeared out of nowhere and inflicted serious injuries on the Red-Eyed Ruler was a Royal Striped Gray Wolf!

Most importantly, the Ruler-level wolf had come out of the Dimensional Summoning that Mo Fan had used so casually…

“So it’s a Royal Striped Gray Wolf. I still don’t know what I should name him!” Mo Fan looked at Wei Rong curiously.

“Is that your Summoned Beast?” Wei Rong’s mind was spinning.

It was a Ruler-level creature! A Ruler-level Royal Striped Gray Wolf!

The Gray Wolves were the nobles of the wolves, and those with the Royal Stripes were the kings among them!

Wei Rong was not just a teacher in the Fire School, he was an expert on demon creatures, too! He instantly recognized the creature after he saw its stripes.

“Old Wolf, tear it into pieces!” Mo Fan ordered him.

The Royal Striped Gray Wolf had been waiting so long for a worthy opponent!

A Ruler-level sea monster, was it? Let’s see who is the real deal here!
