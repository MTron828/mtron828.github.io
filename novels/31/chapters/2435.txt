Chapter 2436: No One Can Escape

The Black Totem Snake turned into a thick mist after Mo Fan left.

The mist did not dissipate for a long time. The elders were a little displeased, as they could not tell if the snake was still on the mountain…

—

The Great Elder, Fang Ning, was sitting inside a secret chamber with walls made of jade stones, half-lying on a chair. A dim light was hanging above him, giving him a sinister and cold appearance.

“How is Yinfeng?” Fang Ning asked.

“She’s done for. She can only lie on a bed for the rest of her life, unless we send her to Parthenon Temple and a Great Muse or someone with a higher rank heals her,” Mu Fangzhou said.

“Then just send her somewhere random with a scenic view,” Fang Ning said indifferently.

“What about him?” Mu Fangzhou pointed at Mu Feiluan, who was lying on a bed.

Mu Feiluan was awake, and glaring at the Great Elder with great resentment.

“Don’t look at me like that, you should be relieved that you are still alive,” Fang Ning chided him.

“Great Elder, since when is our clan so petty that we would allow two little jerks to bully us? Humph, once I find a way to recover my cultivation, I’ll kill everyone on Fanxue Mountain!” Mu Feiluan swore.

Since the Mu Clan had a way to cripple one’s cultivation, it would also have a way to recover one’s cultivation. The only problem was finding a thousand-year-old Tianshan Sacred Lotus!

Luckily, the Mu Clan was resourceful enough to find something even as rare as a Tianshan Sacred Lotus.

“Don’t you worry about it,” Fang Ning waved his hand.

“Are you going to avenge me?” Mu Feiluan’s eyes glittered with excitement.

The Great Elder was unable to do anything because of the Black Totem Snake. He was not necessarily afraid of the Black Totem Snake, but if a fight broke out between him and the Black Totem Snake, it would surely cause massive destruction to the Mu Clan Mountain.

Besides, Fang Ning’s greatest ability was not his impressive cultivation, but his cunning and cruelty. Even the old foxes of other clans were no match for him!

“Mu Ningxue’s Ice Crystal Bow is close to being perfect. We can’t afford to leave it in the hands of someone we can’t control,” Fang Ning declared.

Everyone had witnessed the power of the Ice Crystal Bow. It had made Mu Ningxue extremely powerful even though her cultivation was weaker than Mu Yinfeng and Mu Feiluan. Even Fang Ning was wary of her.

“HAHAHA, it’s only a matter of time until Mu Ningxue ends up dead if the Great Elder is involved. All these sufferings I endured are nothing!”

“Oh Feiluan, I’m sorry to tell you that you might have to suffer a little more. After all, you have brought our clan such a troublesome enemy. Many clans are constantly watching us, so we can’t really do anything that would damage the clan’s reputation. They will surely make a huge fuss if we try to do anything to Mu Ningxue,” Fang Ning told him.

“I’ll do everything I can to help if Great Elder is planning to teach those two assh**** a lesson. Unfortunately, I’ve lost my cultivation, so I would need elders’ help to recover first,” Mu Feiluan said sincerely.

“I just want to make sure you understand. Don’t worry, I promise I will avenge you. For now, you just need to give Mu Fangzhou your full cooperation. It’s very simple,” Fang Ning said.

Mu Feiluan was confused.

What did he need his cooperation for? Did they want him to hand over his spot temporarily?

It was not a big problem. After all, he needed time to recover his cultivation. No one was going to listen to a cripple.

The people of the Mu Clan might look civilized on the surface, but everyone was vicious and greedy inside. The clan strongly followed the law of the jungle.

“Well, Feiluan, we have established a private military camp in the north and conducted some research on some forbidden magic. Unfortunately, none of them have succeeded. The magic to cripple one’s cultivation is only a by-product of our research. The actual thing is stronger and more impressive…” Mu Fangzhou said.

“What is it?” Mu Feiluan had a bad feeling about this.

A black Aura suddenly rose from Mu Feiluan’s body. Something similar to tentacles flew out of the Aura and attached themselves to Mu Feiluan’s forehead, wrists, ankles, stomach, and heart!

Mu Feiluan’s eyes widened in shock. He wanted to scream, but Fang Ning casually stuck his staff into Mu Feiluan’s mouth.

Mu Feiluan started shrinking, as if the tentacles were sucking his life away. His delicate body continued to wither.

A noble Ice Luan with its wings spread appeared behind Mu Fangzhou. Its feathers were delicate and gorgeous, each with a mythical Rune that contained strong Ice Magic.

The feathers of the Ice Luan gradually became clearer. Mu Feiluan could not believe his eyes.

My Innate Talent…

The Ice Innate Talent that he was the proudest of was being transferred into Mu Fangzhou’s body!

Impossible!

Mu Ningxue’s Ice Crystal Bow was transferable because it was a piece of magic Equipment bound to her soul. They could retrieve the bow by destroying her soul and passing it on to the next successor.

However, the Ice Luan was his Innate Talent! How was it possible to take away one’s Innate Talent and transfer it to another person?!

“Oh Feiluan, you should know by now that the Mu Clan has always followed the basic rules of survival. If you had won, you would still be Mu Feiluan. Unfortunately, you lost…

“Mu Ningxue is stronger than you. The Ice Crystal Bow is more valuable than you.”

“As for you, we should not waste your outstanding Innate Talent. Consider it a bargaining chip so Mu Fangzhou will avenge you!”

“I believe you can accept the offer for our clan’s glory, right? Don’t worry, it won’t kill you. You can keep your sister company. The clan can still afford to take care of two people in a vegetative state.”

Fang Ning pulled out his staff from Mu Feiluan’s mouth and rubbed it clean on the carpet.

Mu Feiluan was covered in blue veins. His shrunken body greatly contrasted with his usual handsome appearance. He was almost beyond recognition.

“Shouldn’t you have the resolve, since you were born into the Mu Clan? You only have yourself to blame!

“We will avenge you, but you should also sacrifice yourself when the Mu Clan needs it.”

The Mu Clan had always been cruel and cold. It was only interested in growing stronger. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Those cruel rules had applied to both Mu Ningxue and Hou Ze. Mu Feiluan was no exception to them!

The Mu Clan had never had any compassion for losers. However, the clan had a different punishment for traitors!
