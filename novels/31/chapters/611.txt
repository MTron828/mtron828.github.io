Creatures like this Demon of Disaster were definitely the deadliest at night. They would circle around in the sky, hiding in the dark, and then deal Magicians a deadly blow. However, during the daytime, its movements were obviously greatly hindered.

The cunning Demon of Disaster would immediately beat its wings to produce a black mist when it saw a group of Magicians trying to flank it.

The mist was similar to the Advanced Spell of Shadow Element, Nyx Regime, yet neither its effect nor coverage were comparable to Nyx Regime.

It would want to create a space that was favorable for it to fight in, yet its tactic was simply useless when there was a Light Magician around!

“Brilliant Light: Purify!” Shorty was an experienced Hunter. As soon as he saw the Demon of Disaster trying to stir up trouble, a milky-white light blossomed on his palm.

He tossed the light right into the center of the black mist. The golden light rays shining forth thoroughly purified the mist, which was similar to the gas produced from a car’s exhaust. Even the stench was gone. Most importantly, they were able to see the creature clearly under the bright light!

“Ice Lock!” Mu Bai cast his Intermediate Ice Spell again.

The frost surrounding him was clear and transparent, beautiful like crystal. It was obvious that the Ice Seed he had was not something ordinary, either.

Four long ice chains appeared simultaneously. Mu Bai controlled them to intertwine swiftly above the Demon of Disaster, forming a web of metallic chains the color of ice looming over it.

The creature was just about to fly into the air to dodge the spells cast by the group when the Ice Lock pressed down on it heavily, dragging it back to the ground!

The ice chains had the effect of Ice Spread. Once it made contact with its target’s skin, the freezing frost would swiftly spread across and penetrate the target’s body. On top of that, it seemed like Mu Bai’s Ice Seed had further increased the effect. The just-wrapped Demon of Disaster was immediately covered in frost by the chains, thoroughly freezing its two arms!

“It can no longer use Fleeing Shadow or fly, it won’t pose any threat to us anymore!” Zhou Ming was overjoyed when she saw Shorty and Mu Bai’s professionalism. They immediately sealed off the Demon of Disaster’s annoying capabilities.

Teaming up with reliable people felt totally different. If they simply gave the Demon of Disaster time to produce the mist or fly into the sky, it would be troublesome to kill it!

“Mo Fan, your turn!” said Shorty.

Mo Fan had already mastered the ability to draw a Star Orbit with a single thought. He no longer needed a long time to finish channeling an Intermediate Spell.

Purple-black Star Orbits connected with one another smoothly, combining into a brilliant Star Pattern...

The restless energy of Lightning appeared. They could even feel the air being scorched by it. When Mo Fan fixed his gaze on the Demon of Disaster, a shocking ray of lightning came down perfectly straight. It lit up the flyover bridge and landed accurately on the Demon of Disaster, right between its wings!

Regardless of how overwhelming the Demon of Disaster’s strength was, the Brilliant Light had blinded it, while the Ice Chain had sealed off its movements. It had completely turned into target practice for Mo Fan!

The damage inflicted when all the Lightning Strikes of the spell Thunderbolt: Wild Strikes landed on the same target was absolutely terrifying. When the third, fourth, and fifth purple-black lightning rays landed on the Demon of Disaster, its body sank into the ground as the impact simply blew a hole in the bridge. Its back was festered and scorched black...

The creature was still alive, yet it had a hard time trying to rise to its feet. The space-trembling effect of Mo Fan’s lightning had impaired its movement. Even though the undead could not feel any pain, the damage inflicted to their important body parts would still affect their ability to move.

“How violent, I’ve never seen anyone that can almost kill a Warrior-level creature with a single Intermediate Spell!” Shorty raised his thumb at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was a typical full DPS Magician. During the group battles in Pearl Institute, whenever he was given a chance to attack, he would simply crush his opponents, and it was the same for Warrior-level creatures. Any other group of Intermediate Magicians would have to work together to barely kill a Warrior-level creature, yet someone like Mo Fan, whose Lightning Element had reached the third level and was further strengthened by a Soul Seed, a single Thunderbolt: Wild Strikes was equivalent to the damage output of a small team!

Zhou Ming was not just standing there to leech xp; she quickly followed up with a Fiery Fist: Groundbreak. The blossoming flames of death devoured the place where the Demon of Disaster was laying, blasting a huge hole into the overpass.

The flames burned fiercely, burning the Demon of Disaster’s wings into ashes. Its figure, burning in the flames, struggled wildly, shoving the vehicles nearby away like toys while uttering a piercing screech.

“Still trying to run away!” Mu Bai controlled the ice chains to weave through the vehicles nimbly and wrapped around the Demon of Disaster’s legs. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As he raised his hand, the ice chains dragged the Demon of Disaster back with brute force. It was quickly turned into black charcoal. Zhou Ming’s flames had an extended burn time, burning longer than normal fires. They simply burned the Demon of Disaster to ash.

“I’ll be taking the undead crystal, that thing is quite useful!” Shorty went up to the Demon of Disaster boldly when he confirmed that the creature was dead.

As expected of an experienced Hunter, the guy adeptly retrieved the undead crystal from the creature’s corpse. The undead crystals of undead that were killed by Lightning or Fire would usually be in good condition...

Undead crystals were basically Magic Ores which contained the energy accumulated by the undead after refining the presence of death for decades. The undead crystals of Servant-class undead were basically useless, but those from Warrior-level creatures were rather valuable.

“Take this, it can replenish your energy. It works with any Element, and is more effective than serums.” Shorty broke the undead crystal in half and handed one half to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan’s eyes flickered. Energy was his main concern for the time being, especially his Summoning Element. The Nebula of his Summoning Element was a lot dimmer since both the Swift Star Wolf and Flame Belle had fought a long battle. He would become helpless soon if they kept stumbling into undead along the way.

“So this thing is actually quite useful!” Mo Fan placed the undead crystal on his palm. When he directed his will into it, a fresh source of energy flowed back into his body.

Mo Fan decisively inserted the energy into his Summoning Element’s Nebula. The energy of the Summoning Element was little Flame Belle and Swift Star Wolf’s energy intake. Both of them were resting up after they were worn out from the previous battle, yet Mo Fan was unable to provide any energy to them! They were going to encounter more undead along the way. Without their assistance, Mo Fan was not too convinced of the group’s safety!

“There’s a side effect though, when you consume it the first time in a day, it will replenish a quarter of your energy. The second time would only replenish an eighth of your energy, and the third time, the effect would reduce by half again... the energy you can recover from the fifth or sixth time is pretty much negligible,” said Shorty.

“Mm, we’re still a distance away from the inner walls. Let’s try our best to conserve our energy!” Mo Fan said grimly to the others.

Zhou Ming and Mu Bai nodded. They were well aware of how serious the situation was!
