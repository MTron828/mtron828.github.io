With a loud crash, the flames of the giant fireball surged across the stage. The scorching heat crashed into the barrier and shook it hard, as if it was going to break into pieces at any second!

“What were you two doing!?” Captain Roberts snapped furiously.

Roberts immediately put the blame on Lucky Wang and Fred when he saw the two Maga on the team injured. They had failed to take out a single person after so long, they were simply being fooled around with like monkeys!

Fred was discomfited.

He did not expect it to come to this. Why were the other Elements of a Mage with the Summoning Element as his primary Element so strong?

“Err, should we take out the other Summoner instead?” Lucky Wang suggested.

They could not do anything to Mo Fan. Even when the two of them were flanking him, they were unable to figure out his weaknesses. At this rate, two of their teammates would be knocked out first!

“Damn it, let’s take him out first!” Fred finally gave up under the pressure. He immediately switched targets and attacked Jiang Yu instead.

—

After the two left, Mo Fan slowly snuck closer to Ai Jiangtu and Roberts.

Mo Fan noticed that Roberts was only able to match Ai Jiangtu because the latter was not using his full strength.

It was only a duel against the team defending the Training Hall. If their captain exposed too much of his true strength, it would place them in an unfavorable position at Venice.

“Telekinesis!” Mo Fan hid by some of the earthen walls that were strewn around. His eyes emitted a silver flicker at the same time as Ai Jiangtu was using the Space Element.

The force went straight at Roberts’ back. The man was totally unaware of the attack from a different source flanking him from behind. His confident step to the side suddenly pushed him straight into Ai Jiangtu’s spell!

Robert immediately panicked. He tried to recover, but he was promptly caught in Ai Jiangtu’s gravity space!

The silver rhomboid applied great pressure to Roberts. It felt like he was chained to a few iron balls, making it extremely difficult for him to move!

“Demon Torture!”

Ai Jiangtu was even quicker at casting Advanced Spells now. The evil silhouette of a devil suddenly appeared behind Roberts.

Roberts felt cold sweat pouring down his face as a sharp pain spread throughout his body. When he turned around, he was shocked to see the Cursed Devil tearing at his soul!

“You’ve lost!” Ai Jiangtu told him firmly.

Roberts clenched his teeth, as if he was trying to fight back against the executioner from the Demon Torture. However, his face only turned paler as the pain he experienced grew stronger.

He initially thought he could endure the pain, but he soon realized that he could not even speak. He would never be able to forget the pain he felt when his soul was being tortured. Only those with a strong mind were able to withstand it.

Ai Jiangtu knew Roberts would suffer unrecoverable injuries if he continued. He murmured a chant and called off the Demon Torture Curse.

Roberts was totally soaked in sweat, and his eyes were bloodshot.

He was mentally exhausted. His face had a blank expression, like someone who had yet to fully wake up from a nightmare.

Some time later, Roberts finally lifted his gaze. The look in his eyes had slightly recovered.

“You’ve won,” he said with a contorted expression, and slowly left the stage. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Roberts knew Ai Jiangtu had gone easy on him. If the Demon Torture had kept going just a little longer, he would have been in huge trouble. His cultivation would be affected, too!

The Curse Element mainly targeted a person’s soul. The damage dealt to a person’s soul or mind was the hardest to recover from. Robert willingly admitted his defeat after he witnessed Ai Jiangtu’s strength.

“You didn’t need to help me. I finally found a worthy opponent that could help me with my warm-up!” Ai Jiangtu glanced at Mo Fan in dissatisfaction.

“...” Mo Fan was speechless. He replied seriously, “It’s supposed to be a team battle! Can you stop being arrogant for once? Let’s hurry up and take out the rest of them so we can get the badge!”

“I’ll leave the rest to you all,” Ai Jiangtu had no intention of continuing after defeating Roberts. If he continued to fight, the rest of the American team would only last for a few minutes longer.

“I guess I’ll rest too!” Mo Fan replied with a shrug.

Little Flame Belle was keeping two of the Americans busy on her own. If Mo Fan joined the fight, the American team would be overwhelmed with despair.

That being said, the five members of the American team were indeed very strong. They were easily as strong as the national teams of some other countries...

However, they were too proud and arrogant at the start, and were showing off their winning streak, too. They had managed to provoke both Mo Fan and Ai Jiangtu into taking part in the duel.

The truth was, the Chinese team only needed to send either Mo Fan or Ai Jiangtu with four other teammates to defeat the American team. The outcome was too predictable when the two monsters teamed up!

Little Flame Belle was basically taking on two of the Americans throughout the whole duel. She was still chasing after the golden-haired woman and the girl in a green shirt. Her Commander-level strength had left the American team in awe.

After Lucky Wang and Fred finally knocked Jiang Yu off the stage with their ineffective teamwork, the American team was basically too exhausted to continue the duel.

After all, their captain was already defeated. The two girls were being bullied by the fiery demoness. The two men were unable to make any difference, as the Chinese team was still ahead in numbers.

“Didn’t I tell you? It’s unnecessary to let them both take part in the duel. We also learned how strong Jiang Yu was the other day...” Zhao Manyan chuckled after seeing how one-sided the duel was.

“Mo Fan’s Contracted Beast is just too strong. The American team is out of luck too, to stumble into us just after Mo Fan’s Contracted Beast woke up!”

“Yeah, she was in control of the whole fight even when she was fighting two people at the same time. Speaking of which, isn’t Mo Fan able to merge with his Contracted Beast? Doesn’t that mean...”

Everyone’s eyes widened upon hearing this.

That’s right, wouldn’t Mo Fan turn into a fiery god of battle when the Flame Belle possessed him? He wouldn’t have a problem taking on some of the stronger national teams, let alone the team of substitutes defending the Training Halls!

“It looks like we’ll be able to get a good result this year.”

“I think so too!”

“We aren’t sure yet, I heard the other countries have crazily talented people too! They are all able to take on several people of their age simultaneously...”

——

Oleena clearly saw how the duel would turn out as the judge.

She let out a smile and said to her brother Fred, “Come down, it’s meaningless to struggle any further. You’re no match for them, just train harder.”

Oleena’s tone implied that she never thought the American team was going to win the duel.

A student that could fight Casso alone was basically enough to defeat the whole American team. Only their national team had someone that could match Mo Fan’s strength!

—

Fred was unwilling to accept his defeat. Their team had remained undefeated for so long, yet they were defeated so easily today...

He did admit that the national teams that had challenged them so far were not particularly strong. It was only a matter of time until they were defeated by a strong country. However, it was sooner than they had imagined, not to mention they were defeated by the Chinese team, who they looked down on.

“We’ve lost. We will fix the result on the page, and we apologize for our arrogance. Your team is truly a lot stronger than ours.” Roberts had gradually recovered and now spoke to them seriously.

The American team was pretty straightforward. They did not act unreasonably after they were defeated, as the Chinese team had imagined they would. Their attitude was completely different than it was before the duel.

It turned out that many people were the same; they would only learn when they were beaten up, especially when it came to being humble, respectful, and polite!

Roberts could not help but be humble, since he had already found out how immeasurable Ai Jiangtu’s strength was during their duel. The man was able to fully control their duel without using his full strength. Roberts had a similar feeling when he was fighting against the incredibly strong representatives of their national team.

That alone was enough to impress Roberts, yet it turned out there was another maniac on the Chinese team, apart from Ai Jiangtu! Apparently, the person was able to take on the leader of the Red Ornaments Guild, Casso, on his own. Roberts suddenly realized how ignorant they were!

——

Not long after, Oleena handed the badges to the Chinese team.

The news about the USA’s Training Hall being defeated for the first time soon spread between the institutes.

However, Mo Fan did not think it was anything to be proud of. The Training Hall only consisted of a bunch of substitutes. The team defending the Training Hall did not usually consist of the strongest candidates a country had.

Their real opponents were undergoing training at different places across the world. They would soon gather at Venice, the City of Canals. By then, the ultimate competition between young Mages would take place, where the world would learn the names of the truly talented, impressive young Mages from different corners of the world!

——

That night, when the team was walking through the bustling streets, Zhao Manyan swore on his head that he would definitely find a strip club. He asked Mo Fan to follow him around.

Mo Fan tried very hard to signal Zhao Manyan to stop entrapping him when his first wife was around!

Unfortunately, Zhao Manyan did not notice the signal. He kept on mentioning it.

“Xue xue, it’s a total misunderstanding. We only went to set up an ambush for the people of the Red Ornaments Guild... I’m not that kind of a person.”

Mu Ningxue ignored him. Him going to watch shameless dances was none of her business. She would merely turn a perverted man like him into an ice statue if he dared to come half a meter close to her.

“Huh? Why is it snowing all of a sudden?”

“Seriously? Isn’t it supposed to be summer now? Why would it snow in summer... ouch! That hurts!” Mo Fan was about to say something when he felt something hard falling on his head.

Mo Fan was about to lift his gaze while cursing when he suddenly noticed countless flickering objects pouring down from the sky...

“It...it’s hailing! My heavens, how big are they!? Find some cover, quick!”

“What on Earth? Hailing in the middle of summer?”
