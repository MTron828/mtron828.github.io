Chapter 2689: Ice Ring Execution Equipment

“Wait! I’ll start with a round of Thorn Ice Ring!” Master Bai Song stopped Elder Shou from rushing into the fight.

Master Bai Song had already prepared the magic spell. He drew a standard circle in the air and the next moment, a freezing cold Thorn Ice Ring appeared on Mo Fan’s ankles.

Mo Fan looked down and noticed the ice around his ankles. There were no chains but the Thorn Ice Ring was covered in sharp, thorny barbs.

‘What is this? Why am I unable to get rid of it?’ thought Mo Fan. He was puzzled. He didn’t know what kind of strange spell Master Bai Song had used to lock him in the Thorn Ice Ring.

Mo Fan attempted to get rid of it when he suddenly saw a figure to his left. There were silver spots of light around this figure. He also noticed traces of water waves vibrating in the air. It was a Space Element magical power!

Mo Fan turned to the figure when it suddenly vanished before his eyes, leaving countless silver spots of light in the air.

If it had been anyone else, they would not have been able to figure out what the disappearing figure intended. But Mo Fan himself was a Space Element mage. He was aware of the type of spell that figure was about to cast.

“Axis of Death!”

The spell allowed a magician to travel through Space Nodes within a second and carve an unbreakable space axis on the enemy’s body. When the Space Nodes formed a Star Constellation-like compass, a dark crimson Axis of Death would penetrate one’s heart or between one’s brows brutally.

Mo Fan could care less about the Thorn Ice Ring surrounding his legs right now. He quickly located the Space Element magician in order to set himself free from the Space Seal. But the mage kept disappearing from his sight. Mo Fan could only occasionally see silver dots and traces of light as the figure used Space Jump.

“Go to hell!” Elder Shou’s voice boomed behind Mo Fan.

Mo Fan spun around, but Elder Shou had already disappeared. Mo Fan was running out of time. If he was unable to find the Space Node, the unavoidable Axis of Death would penetrate him. He did not slow down. He instead used the Black Horn Helmet to activate his dragon senses to its peak.

Mo Fan’s mental state and senses elevated to the eighth realm. He no longer needed to rely on his eyes to locate Elder Shou. He could rely completely on the vibration of the space and sketch a pattern in his mind. He was able to predict Elder Shou’s next Space Node in advance.

“Divine Bird Fist!” Mo Fan sped up. He ran up to where he assumed would be Elder Shou’s next Space Node and swung at him.

Mo Fan adjusted his power by injecting a bit of Little Belle’s Tiandi Flame Calamity. His magical power rose to a terrifying level. It was even stronger than a Super Level Star Palace. Mo Fan’s entire body was ablaze once again with dancing flames. His swing made a whooshing sound in the air like a phoenix’s cry. The flames from his body transferred to his fists and unleashed all impact on Elder Shou.

‘How did he see through that?’ wondered Elder Shou in shock. When he tried to change his position, he crashed with Mo Fan’s Divine Bird Fist. Elder Shou had intended to move to the middle because it was the core of the Space Compass. The Axis of Death would only be complete if Elder Shou managed to light up that part.

Elder Shou was struck by Mo Fan’s powerful Divine Bird Fist. He immediately collapsed and careened into the forest like an airplane with its engine on fire.

Elder Shou screamed in agony as he crashed down to the ground. He was still stunned by Mo Fan being able to predict his magical moves. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Both of them were Space Element magicians. The opponent would have understood the type of magic he was using. But how was he able to gain insight into his magic details?Elder Shou climbed up from the remnants of an ash ravine.

Mo Fan’s Divine Bird Fist had not only defeated Elder Shou, but had also left a long phoenix trail on the mountain range. Elder Shou’s wound was ripped open as a result of the burning flames. He was now in excruciating pain.

To Elder Shou, it was a disgrace to be beaten up by a junior!

Master Bai Song landed next to Elder Shou. “We can’t go after him in this state. Mo Fan is possessed by the divine fire and flaming pet. We must figure out a sensible way.”

Master Bai Song cast a spell that put out the fire raging across the land. He helped ease Elder Shou’s inflamed wound. Elder Shou gritted his teeth in frustration but did not fight back.

“Look at his legs, Mo Fan’s arrogance will only make the Thorn Ice Ring pierce his ankles.” Master Bai Song said.

Elder Shou stared at the Thorn Ice Ring. He realized that the ring surrounding Mo Fan’s ankles was releasing coldness slowly. He also noticed that Mo Fan was in pain.

“Thorn Ice Ring will steal his energy whenever he performs his magic. It will then turn into sharp thorns and pierce his ankles. Not everyone can put up with that kind of pain.” Master Bai Song looked smug.

There were great magicians in this world. Only a few were truly invincible. Magic was ever-changing, but Supernatural Force, Forbidden Realm, Grim Magic, Secret Spell, and Forbidden Law could always be restrained in one way or another.

Mo Fan could have pursued and delivered Elder Shou a crushing blow. However, he felt thousands of ice needles piercing his ankles. He shivered in cold and in pain.

The blazing flames on his body dissipated. His divine flame and Tiandi Flame Calamity were both suppressed.

“Little Flame Belle, can you shatter the Thorn Ice Ring?” Mo Fan asked.

“Purr!” Little Flame Belle began to mobilize the Tiandi Flame Calamity. She centralized the purest and strongest of Tiandi Fire on Mo Fan’s ankles. She intended to burn away the bizarre Thorn Ice Ring.

“Stop! Stop!” cried Mo Fan. The stabbing pain grew in intensity. He felt like his ankles were being sawed through. He was in so much pain that he could barely breathe.

“Purr…” Little Flame Belle purred mournfully.

“It seems the Thorn Ice Ring can absorb energy, just like my Stone-stealing Seal,” Mo Fan said to Little Flame Belle.

Mo Fan had a Stone-stealing Seal with a one-mile radius. When a magic spell was cast on it, the Stone-stealing Seal would absorb all the power and transform it into a stone seal that Mo Fan could use.

The Thorn Ice Ring surrounding Mo Fan’s legs served a similar purpose. Whenever he adjusted his magical power, the Thorn Ice Ring stole some of his energy and rapidly turned it into ice spikes to torture him!

Mo Fan had to admit that the Thorn Ice Ring was much more powerful than his Stone-stealing Seal. Every time he cast a spell, the thorns grew and caused him unimaginable pain. Every movement was torture!

“Damn it! I can’t even summon my magical equipment!” shouted Mo Fan in dismay.
