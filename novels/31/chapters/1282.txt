Mo Fan initially planned to chase after Guo Muzhuang. However, he realized that if he left, he would be leaving the girls including Lingling, Chen Binbin, Zhong Mi, and Hu Duo in Chen Binbin and Wang Hua’s hands. Chen Binbin was clearly unreliable, considering how he had left Hu Duo behind. As for Wang Hua, Mo Fan did not feel the man was reliable, either.

1Meanwhile, he had no idea where Zhao Manyan was and how he was doing either.

Besides a stream in the forest, a handsome man was leaning against a tall tree while staring provokingly down at the cleavage through Guan Xixi’s collar. The cleavage between the two ‘meatballs’ was stunning, but Zhao Manyan did not stare at it for too long. As an experienced ‘ladykiller’, he knew he should be looking into the girl’s eyes in a moment like this, even when he was more interested in the woman’s huge and soft breasts. It was important to look into the woman’s eyes and convince her that he was a man of heart instead of a man of pure desires!

On the other hand, it seemed like Guan Xixi was not that experienced. She was fully blushing from being teased a little.

“Err, shouldn’t we be sticking with the team? I did hear some...some terrifying sounds,” Guan Xixi said softly.

“It’s fine, don’t you trust me?” Zhao Manyan said confidently.

“But...but we’re in the wild,” Guan Xixi’s voice softened further. Her breathing intensified.

“Isn’t this perfect? The beautiful mountains and trees, and a woman so beautiful that I will never forget her with the slightest glance. I have to say, I’m never this impatient, but I just can’t control myself after I saw you. Please forgive me for dragging you here all of a sudden...” Zhao Manyan said sincerely.

Zhao Manyan and Guan Xixi were well behind the team even before they discovered the torn arm. As such, they were utterly clueless about the entire situation.

Zhao Manyan had a very handsome face. His prince-like temperament as he spoke gently could easily overwhelm any inexperienced girl. It definitely convinced Guan Xixi, who lowered her head in embarrassment.

Zhao Manyan knew it was his chance to secure the second base... perhaps he could even score a home run here in this beautiful forest. He had spent half a year recovering from his injuries on a deserted island. He did not even see a single female turtle, let alone a woman. He had been polluting the ocean instead of spreading his seeds across the world!

{TL Note: You can search for ‘baseball metaphors on sex’ on Google if you aren’t aware of what ‘second base’ means here.}

He could finally release the primitive force he had been saving up for half a year. Hell yeah!

Zhao Manyan lowered his head. His heart was roaring like a beast, yet his actions were like a gentleman...

BANG!

A thud came from a trunk nearby. The girl immediately opened her eyes alertly since they were still in the wild. She glanced into the direction of the sound in fear.

The girl completely lost her mind after a quick glance. It was a bloody leg...

It seemed to be a human’s leg. It was still wearing pants and a shoe, but it was empty above the knee!

“AHHHH!!!” Guan Xixi screamed at the top of her lungs. It felt like her spirit had faded away.

Zhao Manyan’s face immediately darkened. He turned around in displeasure to see what had intervened with his business, but all he saw was a leg.

He looked further ahead and saw a man covered in blood crawling out of the bushes toward them with his hands. Zhao Manyan was shocked when he saw that the man had lost his lower legs!

The man had left a trail of blood over half a meter behind as he continued to drag himself forward. To their surprise, they knew who he was. It was Guo Muzhuang, who had goneto pluck the demon crests before!

“It’s...it’s Muzhuang!” Guan Xixi was mentally stronger. She did not lose her calm like Hu Duo. She had recognized Guo Muzhuang, even though his face was covered in blood!

Guo Muzhuang desperately crawled out of the bush. A bulky figure suddenly leapt out from it. It had a beastly human face with fangs of a boar. Its huge paws like those of a bear were holding his the other missing leg.

It took a huge bite of the leg, like a caveman biting a lamb shank. The only difference was, it was the leg of a human instead of a lamb! The sight of it was gruesome enough to make a person’s scalp turn numb!

“Holy crap, what the hell is that!?” Zhao Manyan cursed.

“Help...help me...” Guo Muzhuang was struggling to speak, as his mouth was filled with blood. He was staring at Zhao Manyan and Guan Xixi in fear, his eyes pleading!

“Light Protection!” Zhao Manyan immediately cast a Light Spell when he saw the monster about to attack the man. A golden light shield appeared and protected Guo Muzhuang.

The Hillman was not satisfied yet, and was infuriated by the light shield separating it from its food. It jumped over Guo Muzhuang, and went right at Zhao Manyan!

“I will give you a month’s time. If you can break through my defense, I’ll f**king cook my own meat and feed it to you!” Zhao Manyan finished casting another spell while he was speaking. A circle of rocks Summoned with the Eyes of the Rock Demon formed a thick barrier around the Hillman.

The thick barrier completely surrounded the Hillman. It went berserk and attacked the barrier, but it did not even budge. The barrier trapped the creature like a cage.

“Save him quick,” Zhao Manyan told Guan Xixi.

Guan Xixi nodded. She quickly moved over to Guo Muzhuang.

Guo Muzhuang had lost his lower limbs. Luckily, the monster had only torn Guo Muzhuang’s legs off. Apart from the excessive amount of blood he was losing, his vital parts were still intact. Guan Xixi quickly took out the Bone-connecting Ointment and applied it to the wounds to temporarily stop the bleeding.

Guo Muzhuang was extremely weak. Him being a Mage had given him a glimpse of hope to survive. Any normal person would be dead by now after suffering his injuries.

“He’s in bad shape. He won’t live for long if we don’t find a Healer soon,” Guan Xixi said.

“I’ll carry him, let’s regroup with the others first,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Mm.”

—

The two found the spacious area where the rest of the team were. Guan Xixi let out a relieved sigh when she learned that the others were fine.

“I found him on my way here. What’s going on?” Zhao Manyan placed Guo Muzhuang down. The Bone-connecting Ointment had closed up the wounds and stopped the bleeding.

However, Guo Muzhuang had lost too much blood. He would die still without the help of a Healer. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Guo Muzhuang feebly looked at Hu Duo and said, “Hu...Hu Duo...it’s good to...to see that you’re fine!”

“Did you go looking for me?” Hu Duo had completely forgotten her fear after seeing Guo Muzhuang’s condition.

“Where’s the other one?” Mo Fan asked Zhao Manyan.

“There’s another one?” Zhao Manyan was stunned.

The others immediately fell silent. Another guy had gone after Guo Muzhuang too, but Zhao Manyan had only saved one of them. It was likely that the guy...

“I’m sorry, I didn’t know. I came here straight away because his injuries were too serious,” Zhao Manyan sighed.

If Zhao Manyan knew there was another guy, he would have tried his best to save him, too. It was a human life, after all.

“I’ll go look for him. Old Zhao, look after the girls,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was at ease now that Zhao Manyan had regrouped with the team. Otherwise, he would not dare to leave the girls after learning how cunning the Hillmen were.

“I’ll go with you,” Chen Yi said.

“Chen Yi, we should wait for the Elder here. If anything happens again... the guy is most likely dead. You can tell just by seeing what happened to Guo Muzhuang!” Wang Hua seemed a little frightened.

“We can’t just leave him behind, since we haven’t found his corpse. He’s only in trouble because he was trying to help Hu Duo!” Chen Yi said.

Mo Fan was not in the mood to waste his time talking to the others. He quickly headed in the direction that Zhao Manyan mentioned. Chen Yi immediately went after him. She seemed nervous.

Wang Hua did not dare to go with them. However, his face gradually darkened when he saw Chen Yi leaving with Mo Fan.

“Humph, trying to act tough; he’s going to die for sure!” Wang Hua snapped.

“Wang Hua, how could you say that? You didn’t dare to help, yet you’re still sneering at him!” Zhong Mi snapped, displeased by Wang Hua’s reaction.

The others were not unreasonable. They were impressed that Mo Fan had the courage to step forward and volunteer his help despite the risks involved.

“Do you seriously think the guy is still alive after seeing what happened to Guo Muzhuang? The team is just going to get split up now that he has wandered off. It’s only going to get us killed if we keep splitting up. He’s just an amateur who has no clue what he’s doing, yet he’s trying to act tough!” Wang Hua rebuked.

1The others did not dare say a word.

Zhao Manyan looked at Wang Hua with a cold smirk. He chose to be quiet.

“How long can he last for?” Zhao Manyan asked Guan Xixi, looking at Guo Muzhuang’s pained expression.

“Not more than two hours,” Guan Xixi said.

“It’s going to take us half a day if we turn back now. It’s meaningless to just wait here. We’ll have to find the other teams. If they have a Healer, Guo Muzhuang might still live,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Are...are you kidding now? The Elder already told us not to wander off. Heaven knows how many Hillmen there are around this area. We should just wait for the Elder here!” Chen Binbin said.

“So you’re just going to watch Guo Muzhuang die then?” Zhao Manyan demanded.

“I didn’t say that, I’m just stating the facts. There’s no chance we can find the other teams in this forest. Even if we did, it’s unlikely they would have a Healer!” Chen Binbin said.

“Go look for other teams yourself if you want!” Wang Hua snapped coldly.

“How could you do this? Why can’t we just go together? Those Hillmen are trying to split us up on purpose, which means they won’t dare to attack as long as we are together... Hu Duo, don’t you agree?” Guan Xixi said.

Hu Duo had a complicated look. She occasionally glanced at Guo Muzhuang, but she finally moved closer to Chen Binbin and said, “I think... it’s better to wait for the Elder here.”

Chen Binbin placed his arm around the girl’s shoulder and said, “Yeah, we can’t afford to place the rest of the team in danger for the sake of a dying man.”
