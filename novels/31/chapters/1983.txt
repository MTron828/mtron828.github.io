It was not difficult to find the Mountain Frost Lotus. The Mailong Private Military Group had not come unprepared. Tommy also took out some of the useful information he had purchased previously, and led a dozen members off to climb some hills.

The mountains were located in the Rift Valley. Some of them were like pillars connected to the outside, covered by strange-looking plants, many of which were dangling from the mountains like ropes.

“You guys, keep an eye on the entrance!”

“Don’t you worry, we won’t let those Mudcat Demons in.”

Mo Fan was standing on the opposite cliff. His job was to keep an eye on the Valley Bird Demons that were approaching from another canyon. Kuma was climbing another hill with a few of the captains to retrieve the Mountain Frost Lotus.

“You better stay on alert. If those Valley Bird Demons ambush us, I won’t go easy on you,” the captain of the fourth team said.

“Just mind your own business.”

The Valley Bird Demons were a low-level species, with wings that looked like huge banana leaves. They would normally dive at their targets like howling banshees. They were able to reproduce rapidly in a short period of time, so they did not mind sacrificing themselves for the sake of feeding their tribe.

Many high-level demon creatures struggled to fend them off, since they relied on their suicide attack. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“They are here already?” Mo Fan could already hear the bird demon’s cries echoing off the cliff.

He glanced at the edge of the canyon and noticed a large flock of green creatures moving through the air like a stream. They were approaching the group rapidly through the canyon.

The Valley Bird Demons hated sunlight. Whenever a ray of sunlight crossed their flight path, they would avoid it as if it was a solid obstacle along the way. They insisted on staying in the shadows. It looked like the flock was suddenly cut in half diagonally.

“So, you aren’t afraid of dying? The defeat is mine if even one of you manage to fly through my wall of flames!” Mo Fan raised his hands. Flames erupted from his palms.

He tossed the flames out at them. The first one landed on the narrow opening of the canyon. There were no flammable plants nearby, yet the Ardent Flame immediately set the area on fire and filled up the gap!

The Valley Bird Demons let out unpleasant, bat-like cries, but continued to advance recklessly. The double-layered flock went through Mo Fan’s flames directly. They were treating the bodies and wings of the Valley Bird Demons on the outside as protective clothing.

Mo Fan was still holding another flame in his hand. He did not panic even when he saw many Valley Bird Demons flying toward him.

The captain of the fourth team turned around when he heard the loud screeches of the Valley Bird Demons. He yelled when he saw Mo Fan’s petty flame about to be put out by the flock of Valley Bird Demons, “Is your energy as valuable as gold? Why aren’t you using your Advanced Mages? Idiot!”

Mo Fan glanced at the Valley Bird Demons toward the back and noticed they had entered the vicinity of his flames. He finally hurled the second flame out.

The tongue of flame seemed like an ordinary fireball on the surface. However, when it landed amid the burning flames in the canyon, it was like a catalyst. The wall of flames instantly grew into a sea of flames over a few dozen meters high. The flames immediately devoured the Valley Bird Demons.

The taller the wall of flames, the thicker the flames. The Valley Bird Demons on the outer layers could not endure the heat. Even the Valley Bird Demons in the inner layers were burned into ashes.

The Ardent Sunset was strong because every living creature on fire served as fuel to the flames. Creatures that liked huddling together were always its favorite. It was not going to spare any of them!

The fierce flames were producing loud crackling sounds as the creatures were burned to death. Mo Fan could even smell a pleasant aroma when the wind blew toward him.

“It seems like these Valley Bird Demons are a great ingredient for cooking. Unfortunately, the flames are a little too strong,” Mo Fan smiled when he picked up the pleasant smell.

Meanwhile, the captain of the fourth team was struggling to fend off the startled Mudcat Demons. They were also not a high-level species. Their strength was their ability to use the shadows and dim surroundings as cover, making it difficult for their enemy to keep track of them. They were good at ambushing their prey.

As Mo Fan expected, the fourth team failed to fend off the Mudcat Demons in the end. Almost thirty of them broke through the defense and chased after Kuma and her men.

“Idiots, you can’t even keep the Mudcat Demons away!” the Vice Leader yelled like a ferocious beast.

The captain of the fourth team had an awkward face. He glanced at Mo Fan who seemed quite relaxed.

“Do you need help?” Mo Fan asked.

“If you’re willing...” the captain said shamelessly.

“Unfortunately, I’m not...”

—

The low-level Mudcat Demons were not much of a problem for the powerful Vice Leader, but it meant they had to waste their time taking care of the demon creatures first.

“Vice Leader, I got it!” Tommy said.

“Retreat, we must leave now. More demon creatures are coming this way!” Kuma said.

“Our path has been blocked by an unknown species.”

“Force our way through!”

—

The Mailong Private Military Group was quite impressive. They managed to withdraw in one piece even as they were surrounded by demon creatures.

When they retreated along the same path, another group was ready to receive them. It did not take the band long to break free from the encirclement of the demon creatures.

They returned to the campsite. It was getting dark, and they only had a few torches to light up the camp. The Light Mages were not willing to use their spells, since they had to preserve their energy.

“We’ve found the Mountain Frost Lotus. What now?” Kuma asked.

“I think we just need to boil it in water and drink it.”

—

Warner plucked the petals of the Mountain Frost Lotus and boiled them with drinking water.

A pleasant aroma soon rose from the pot. Those who were ill immediately felt a lot better after smelling it. They opened their eyes and looked at the source of the smell.

“It seems to be working!” Kuma was overjoyed.

If the aroma alone was already so effective, everyone would soon recover from the illness by drinking the water!

“Be careful, the smell might attract demon creatures to us,” Tommy reminded them.

“Humph, once our people recover, we’ll kill every single one of them!” Kuma swore.
