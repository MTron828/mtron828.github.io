Shao Zheng sent the information about the Moon Moth Phoenix in no time. There was also information about other Totem Beasts. It all seemed rather complicated. It was going to take Mo Fan some time to understand everything.

Mo Fan went back to the Clearsky Hunter Agency. Lingling was already doing her homework, and it was obviously not the homework from school. She seemed quite interested in the Totem Beasts, too. After all, the Totem Beasts were legends that had been around for the longest time. They were a bunch of creatures born for fighting, but surprisingly were not hostile toward humans. They were too many mysteries around them.

“What did you find? Is the Moon Moth Phoenix as strong as the Black Totem Snake?” Mo Fan asked.

“Not really; the Black Totem Snake is clearly one of the strongest Totem Beasts out there. The Moon Moth Phoenix’s strength should be on par with the Silver Skyruler instead, or perhaps slightly stronger. I can’t really say for sure either, but there’s one thing I know for sure; every Totem Beast has their own special abilities that make them unbeatable against the leaders of the demon creatures,” Lingling informed him.

“I see. Speaking of which, have you heard anything about the threat along the shoreline?” Mo Fan said.

Lingling shook her head. She had not heard anything about it yet.

“By the way, Jiang Shaojun pretty much wrote every article here. It seems he was working with a colleague when he went looking for the Moon Moth Phoenix. His colleague might still be around, that might be the clue we are looking for,” Lingling said.

Mo Fan nodded. He was about to ask Lingling for the name of Jiang Shaojun’s colleague when his phone started ringing.

“Mo Fan, you better come right now, something’s happening,” Mu Ningxue said.

“What is it?” asked Mo Fan.

“The people of the Research Union might have found where the Moon Moth Phoenix is. Yu Shishi is already making her way there despite my advising against it. It’s too dangerous to leave her alone, so I’m going with her. I wasn’t able to bring Bola with us since he’s still asleep,” Mu Ningxue said.

“He doesn’t have much time left, so he’s asleep most of the time. We’ll handle it ourselves. Where are you now? I’m on my way,” Mo Fan said.

It was more suitable for Bola to guard a specific place due to his circumstances. It was not good to ask him to follow a person around. Besides, Mo Fan was not necessarily Bola’s senior. He was just trying to live longer by taking in Mo Fan’s demonic aura. Unlike Liu Ru, he did not have many years left. He spent most of his time sleeping in a coffin.

“I brought my national team badge with me. You can locate me with it,” Mu Ningxue said.

She was not too sure about her whereabouts either. She only knew they had gone pretty deep into the woods.

“Alright, but why would the people of the Research Union know where the Moon Moth Phoenix’s cocoon is?” Mo Fan asked.

“I have no idea.”

—

It was difficult to figure what was going on through the phone. Mo Fan immediately gave his national team’s badge to Lingling and asked her to track where Mu Ningxue was.

“Got it, she’s in the forest in Nanling Mountains. It’s quite a distance from where we are. I’m afraid we won’t make it in time with your wolf,” Lingling said.

“What should we do then? There isn’t a Space Teleportation Formation around here,” Mo Fan said.

“We can ask Nighthawk to give us a ride!”

—

Nighthawk happened to be in the Magic City, too. He was promoted to a Vice Elder of the Enforcement Union after what happened to the Beiyu Enforcement Union.

As a matter of fact, Nighthawk was long since qualified to be a Vice Elder of the Enforcement Union, since he was usually in charge of most operations related to the Black Vatican. Unfortunately, he never got along well with the man with the surname Lu, thus he was stuck as an Enforcer.

“It’s midnight and you two have called me over to be your driver!” Nighthawk sighed helplessly. Only Lingling had the guts to order a Vice Elder of the Enforcement Union around.

“Enough talk, just hurry up, will you? It’s something important that the Chairman has asked us to keep an eye on!” Lingling said proudly.

“Chairman? Chairman Shao Zheng!?” Nighthawk exclaimed. He immediately stopped grumbling when he learned they were receiving orders from Chairman Shao Zheng.

Nighthawk’s Summoned Beast, a Light-Curtain Eagle, was one of the fastest flying creatures in the Enforcement Union. It was the main reason Lingling had asked him for help.

—

The three made their way up to the roof. Nighthawk chanted under his breath. Wisps of darkness soon appeared around him and consumed the light of the street lamps nearby. It was as like a black hole was appearing on the roof.

A pair of cold stunning wings spread apart from inside the black hole. Their black feathers had a metallic luster to them. The wings loomed over the entire building when they were fully spread!

The black wings beat softly, producing a strong gust of wind sweeping the street and the roof. Clothes that were being dried outside flapped wildly, while the window panels rattled.

The wind blew dried leaves and dust into the air. Nighthawk jumped onto the Light-Curtain Eagle’s back and asked Mo Fan and Lingling to hop on, too.

The two followed him immediately. The Light-Curtain Eagle beat its wings and left the roof, rising quickly into the air. There was a tall building just ahead. The light that the Light-Curtain Eagle was reflecting shone upon the building’s windows. The people on the street immediately screamed at the top of their lungs!

The Light-Curtain Eagle reached the building’s roof. It kicked its feet and thrust itself higher into the sky, where the light of the city could no longer reach. It glided silently into the sky, heading for the woods in the distance!

“Your eagle is pretty cool. Can I trade my Flying Creek Snow Wolf for him?” Mo Fan was thrilled as he felt the night breeze sweeping at him while sitting on the eagle’s back.

Little Flame Belle cried out in displeasure after hearing Mo Fan’s words. -Uncle wolf is so naively adorable, how could you trade him away? Little Flame Belle enjoys bullying uncle wolf!-

“HAHA, I was just kidding. By the way, aren’t you supposed to be sleeping? Don’t you know it’s important for a kid to get enough rest while you’re still growing?” Mo Fan dragged Little Flame Belle down from his shoulder and flicked her on her forehead.

Little Flame Belle twisted her lips in displeasure and went to Lingling to be comforted instead.

“I’ll trade him for your adorable Little Flame Belle,” Nighthawk said with a smile.

“No way, Little Flame Belle is my daughter,” Mo Fan replied decisively.

“If the Flying Creek Snow Wolf knew the true face of his master, he would definitely break the contract with you, even if it meant damaging his soul!” Lingling sniffed.
