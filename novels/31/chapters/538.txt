Fiery Fist: Nine Halls!

When the nine fire pillars burst out from the ground, Xu Mingcong and his team were completely roasted by the flames.

They had already expended their Shield Equipment and Armor Equipment to protect themselves from the lightning strikes. The Nine Halls broke down their remaining defense.

The shocking destructive force destroyed almost the entire dueling ground. Even the safety barrier at the edge began to shake as the fire tongues fire between the pillars continued to dance wildly...

The watching Gu Jian was stunned. He also had the Lightning and Fire Elements, thus making him a full-offensive Magician. However, he was dumbfounded by the formidable power of the same Spells of his two Elements when Mo Fan was the caster!

Soul Seeds!

Gu Jian realized that the difference between their Soul Seeds had resulted in the tremendous difference in their strength!

Mo Fan’s Rose Flame was simple yet violent, multiplying the power of any Fire Spell by 2.5 times. Meanwhile, the Fiery Fist: Nine Halls was simple and violent, too. Hence, it was the best Spell to utilize the boost in power from the Rose Flame.

Meanwhile, the strength of Mo Fan’s Thunderbolt: Wild Strikes was somewhat similar to Gu Jian’s, yet the space-trembling effect had left its targets in a miserable state despite the protection of their defensive equipment.

The slight difference between their Soul Seeds had resulted in an unexpected outcome. It felt like the battle had already ended after the Lightning and Fire.

Their opponents had basically used all their defensive equipment, while Mo Fan’s team was still holding onto theirs. It was impossible for Mo Fan’s team to lose when their opponents could barely stand up after being blasted by the two destructive Spells.

As the situation cleared up, Gu Jian’s expression turned unpleasant.

“Did we actually win?” Li Jie and Liu Xing stared at Mo Fan in disbelief.

“HAHA, we won, Mo Fan, you’re so cool!” Ai Tutu jumped into the air and gave Mo Fan a kiss on his face.

Ai Tutu literally had a young face with enormous breasts. As she went forward to kiss Mo Fan on the cheek, her pair of giant rabbits was pressing Mo Fan’s chest hard. The shocking bounce almost resulted in blood jetting out from his nose.

{TL Note: Giant rabbits = boobs.}

That was f**king exciting!

Ai Tutu was aware that she had overdone it. Even though she was blushing, she managed to gather herself and said sternly, “I was just overwhelmed with joy. It doesn’t mean anything, don’t you think too much!”

Mo Fan wore an evil grin without saying anything.

—

The three referees soon declared the outcome. Xu Mingcong’s team basically stood no chance after Mo Fan’s two consecutive third-tier Intermediate Spells. The battle had become one-sided.

As a matter of fact, Liu Xing, Li Jie, and Ai Tutu were not weak. Once Mo Fan got the upper hand using his overwhelming power, Xu Mingcong and his team basically had no chance to fight back. Besides, Ai Tutu’s Deathstrike Magic Equipment was insanely powerful, even comparable to Mo Fan’s Intermediate Spell at full power.

—

“Xu Mingcong, why the hell did you lose the battle?” Gu Jian had almost gone crazy, and yelled at Xu Mingcong.

“Humph, you’d lose too if you were in it!” Xu Mingcong was already in a bad mood after losing the match, yet Gu Jian still yelled at him.

What could Xu Mingcong possibly do?

He only had the Wind and Shadow Elements. He could at most pin his opponents down and harass them!

Meanwhile, the guy they were facing had Lightning and Fire Elements, the two most violent Elements one could possibly hope for, and was also able to summon a Swift Star Wolf! How could they possibly stand a chance!?

This Mo Fan’s strength was indeed outstanding, as expected of someone in the top ten of the Fire School.

“A mere battle is nowhere enough to prove yourself, just you wait!” said Xu Mingcong, pointing his finger at Ming Cong.

In contrast to how Xu Mingcong looked when he first entered the dueling ground, his face was covered in ash and his clothes were ragged. His hair resembled that of a beggar, and he could no longer be described as handsome. The girls who screamed previously could not believe he was the same handsome, cool dude who had nonchalantly kept his hands in his pockets.

Xu Mingcong did not want to embarrass himself any further. He turned and left the place.

As he left, Gu Jian’s mind went blank.

Meanwhile, Ai Tutu totally turned into an immature kid, hurrying to the seat she was sitting in before. She twisted her waist slightly and sat down in a perfectly upright posture!

Now that they had won the match, it implied that she was not the sole reason they lost the previous match. Gu Jian might be good at one-on-one duels, but he insisted on doing everything his way in a team battle, a great contrast to Mo Fan, who knew how to utilize everyone’s Elements efficiently!

In Ai Tutu’s opinion, Mo Fan was shockingly strong, yet besides the advantage of having the combination of Fire and Lightning, he knew how to communicate with his team...

How to deal with their opponents, how to nullify their attacks, when to withdraw strategically, when to counterattack! In terms of fighting capacity, Mo Fan was a lot stronger than Gu Jian, who only knew how to scold people! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ai Tutu let out a smile and glanced at Gu Jian, her eyes squinting. She would not show any mercy to Gu Jian. He would do what he was supposed to, and that was what he deserved for scolding her!

“What are you waiting for, crawl to her,” said Mo Fan, whose dictionary never had the word ‘mercy’ in it.

Gu Jian almost broke his teeth from clenching them too hard.

What the heck was happening, isn’t Xu Mingcong stronger than Bai Yulang, how could they possibly lose the match!?

With everyone watching Gu Jian, he did not dare to go back on his word. He knelt on the ground with a dark face...

He crawled forward and immediately felt a great humiliation strike him like a rolling wave. He had a great urge to rise to his feet and duel Mo Fan to death.

In the end, Gu Jian chose to continue crawling forward, his eyes full of hatred.

The distance was not far, yet the crawl was more tortuous than crawling toward the Yellow Springs. When he finally made it to where that bitch was sitting, he saw her smiling at him proudly.

Ai Tutu had no reason to go soft on Gu Jian, and gave him a loud slap to the face.

Gu Jian could feel his face burning. He never thought he would actually be slapped by the girl for scolding her before the day was even over!

“This slap is to stop you scum from barking at people again! I’m still a virgin!” Ai Tutu gave him another slap with the back of her hand, completely showing her evilness. The crowd subconsciously took a deep breath when they saw this.

You should never infuriate a woman! The man’s handsome face was already swelling after the two slaps. Since when had the arrogant Gu Jian ever suffered such humiliation in his entire life?

“As for this final slap...”

Ai Tutu raised her hand, and was about to use all her might to slap the man to his death.

However, as her hand reached the highest point, a tanned hand suddenly grabbed her wrist like a pair of pincers, not allowing her to fling it.

Gu Jian had already closed his eyes, already thinking of a way to avenge himself in the future. However, his wretched heart was suddenly filled with a hint of joy.
