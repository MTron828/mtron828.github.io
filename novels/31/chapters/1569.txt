Chapter 1572 Going Into the Pyramid

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The bloody page flipped on its own, and a mummy with an overwhelming presence appeared from it. It emanated a strong hatred, just as Shreev had mentioned. The others were almost knocked unconscious by it!

“Come into my undead’s belly!” Shreev said.

The Bitter Dust Mummy suddenly placed its hands on its midriff and tore it open ruthlessly, revealing the disgusting sight within. Shreev entered the creature’s belly right away, ignoring what the others were feeling. The rest of the team remained still. They did not expect their disguise would turn out like this...

“Quick, what are you waiting for? Come inside!” Shreev poked his bloody head out of the belly when he did not see anyone following him, yelling at the others. The rest of the team was further disgusted by the sight.

A gray storm was forming above them, seemingly made up of thousands of demon birds circling in the sky. Their bodies did not touch one another, and it was even possible to move right through them. They were like phantoms with long bodies. Two-thirds of their figures resembled an enormous demon, yet the rest of it gradually led to nothing but a thin wadding!

Their ghastly cries kept ringing out. The screeches penetrated their minds and deafened them. It was impossible to tell how many tormented souls were inside the storm. The spirits had the urge to tear every creature that was living more comfortably than them into pieces, just so others could feel the torture they were going through, too!

“Come inside, or we’ll become one of them!” Mo Fan dove into the Bitter Dust Mummy’s belly when he sensed something was not right.

The Bitter Dust Mummy was around the size of a wooden hut. Its belly was just big enough to contain all of them. They held their breaths, trying not to inhale the rotten air inside the undead’s belly.

Mo Fan felt like there was still some space inside the undead’s stomach when he first went inside, but when the rest of the team came in, everyone was basically stuck close together. Luckily, the Bitter Dust Mummy’s guts were a little elastic. It bloated up slightly to free up some space for the group.

“Try not to breathe too much, I’m going to seal the wound,” Shreev told the others.

“F**k me, what do you mean by try not to breathe too much!?”

Was it even possible to control their oxygen intake?

Shreev cast a spell to seal the gash in his servant before the others could complain, closing the wound on the Bitter Dust Mummy’s belly.

The tormented souls dove down from the sky. It felt like the gray clouds in the sky had suddenly collapsed to the ground. The ghastly cries and screeches resounded in their ears like sirens. They felt like their heads were about to explode!

The tormented souls had obviously picked up the scent of living humans. It had been many years since a living creature had set foot in the vicinity of the Pyramids of Gisele. The tormented souls had not had a chance to vent their hatred for some time. They all dove at the ground recklessly.

However, the scent of living humans disappeared as soon as the Bitter Dust Mummy’s belly was sealed.

Living humans had a unique scent. In addition to that, the air they exhaled was different from the undead, too. The undead and tormented souls used these differences to locate living creatures, since their vision was not that reliable. Some did not even have eyes...

An enormous tormented soul stuck its face close to the Bitter Dust Mummy, trying to sniff out the scent of the living humans that had briefly appeared. However, it could only pick up the rotten smell from the Bitter Dust Mummy.

The tormented soul was not satisfied. It finally found some pieces of newspaper that it could tear to relieve its boredom, discontent that the huge Bitter Dust Mummy had already eaten the living creatures.

The rest of the tormented souls roamed nearby, too. They all felt it a pity that they had come a little too late. The Bitter Dust Mummy had gotten the head start!

These vengeful spirits were not that intelligent. They soon left after realizing that there was no food left.

A golden boulder slowly moved aside from a certain spot along the walls of the Great Pyramid of Giza, revealing a pitch-black hole. The dust nearby was soon being drawn into the hole in a vortex.

It was difficult to notice the hole without first seeing the spiraling dust, which went from covering a tiny area to a kilometer in length. The small hole on the Pyramid was like a little funnel that a huge golden tornado was pouring into, dragging the sand and the tormented souls nearby into the Pyramid!

The tormented souls nearby fled for their lives upon seeing it. In their eyes, being sucked into the Pyramid was like being dragged into a meat grinder. Their souls would scatter and disperse for sure!

They tried their best to swim away, but the force of the funnel kept growing. It was so strong that it even peeled off the thick layer of sand of the desert within its range. The tormented souls and the lone spirits wandering in the distance were all dragged into the hole...

The gray cloud of hatred had accumulated for quite some time, yet it was slowly dragged into the bottomless hole inside the Pyramid. The tormented souls were like schools of fish being carried by the current. They were unable to break free, no matter how hard they struggled!

Cries of agony echoed continuously in the group’s ears. The Bitter Dust Mummy was also dragged into the hole by the enormous force. Its narrow and disgusting stomach kept spinning. They could not help but wonder why Shreev bothered to ask them to breathe less. How was he expecting them to breathe when the ichor and intestines in the mummy’s belly were rolling around!?

Everyone was suffering from nausea after taking this ‘convenient’ ride into the Underworld. The ride lasted for a long time too, through utter darkness and loud noises. They had no clue if their plan had worked or the ride had actually led them straight to hell. Either way, Mo Fan had a feeling that he was about to faint soon.

The oxygen level inside the Bitter Dust Mummy’s was extremely low. The people inside were suffocating amid the torture they were experiencing. Some even had the urge to blast the belly open and escape from it.

Something burst open after a huge explosion. Mo Fan only knew he was sent flying before slamming heavily into a sturdy wall.

His head was spinning, and could not even get his directions. His vision finally recovered after a few minutes, and he began to put the pieces back together.

Mo Fan knew the inside of the Pyramid was full of danger. He quickly checked his surroundings, and found himself in a square hidden chamber!

He was surrounded by sturdy walls with perfect edges. The gaps between the rocks that made up the walls were smaller than the width of a strand of hair.

The square stone chamber was around a thousand meters long, while its height remained unknown.

It was quite spacious for a hidden chamber. It looked even bigger than the Pyramid itself, but Mo Fan knew the space inside the Pyramid was at least a few hundred times bigger than its size on the outside. Some said the space inside was compressed and enlarged, while the others argued that the Pyramid was a portal leading to another Plane: it was an entrance to the Underworld!

“Hello, where is everyone?” Mo Fan yelled.

“I’m under your foot,” Zhao Manyan’s voice came from below him.

Mo Fan quickly stepped aside and saw Zhao Manyan lying on the ground. He was covered in stinking goo. The man looked as if he had lost his will to live.

“Old Zhao, hurry up and cast a Water Spell to give me a wash, it feels horrible,” Mo Fan chided him.

“I feel like I’m suffering from severe bone fractures, and you’re treating me like a shower!?” Zhao Manyan cursed.

Despite the grumbling, Zhao Manyan still cast Water Barrier. The water flowed past them like ribbons and rinsed them clean.

They felt a lot better after the sticky goo was washed from their bodies. Zhao Manyan murmured, “Don’t you feel like we were in a vehicle carrying manure that fell off a cliff?”

“We’ll talk later, let’s find the others. If they are dead, we’ll have to find a way out,” Mo Fan said.

“It’s too dark, light a fire,” Zhao Manyan said.

“You’re a f**king Light Mage!”

“Oh, right!” Zhao Manyan tossed a Brilliant Light into the air. It shone over the area and filled the dark and icy-cold chamber.

The light swept over their surroundings and revealed some eerily-shaped, skinny creatures with hollow eyes, holding bloody hooks and axes. These strange creatures lifted their heads slightly and stared at the light in the air, most likely because they had never seen such before. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The creatures soon turned toward Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan, who had Cast the spells. An icy murderous intent and hatred converged on them immediately from all directions, like two plump hares falling right into the middle of a bunch of starving meat-eating demons!

“Crap, we’ve fallen into a pit full of monsters!” Zhao Manyan jumped up in fright.

Wasn’t this supposed to be a ventilation hole? Why were there so many demon creatures here?

“It’s the Tomb Torturers, they are responsible for catching the lone spirits...” Mo Fan murmured.

The Tomb Torturers were not commonly seen in the outside world. They spent most of their time living in huge tombs and working for their masters. An ambitious ruler of the undead not only needed to kill living creatures to increase the size of his army, he also needed to drag weaker undead into his tomb to help refine the strength of his army!
