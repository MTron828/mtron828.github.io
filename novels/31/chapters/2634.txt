Guan Songdi came over and said softly, “I might know where the place you are looking for is…”

“Tdon’t think I want to trust you.” Mo Fan was well aware of what kind of person Guan Songdi was.

“Twon’tt lie to you. I just want to leave this place, but you won’t leave if you don’t find the Lanyang Earth Core. It’s in my interest to help you finish your mission as quickly as possible!” Guan Songdi said quickly.

“Tell us what you know, then,” Mo Fan replied coolly.

“Imet a bunch of survivors before. We stayed together to hide from the Sharkmen. One of them was a Mage. He mentioned that if the city had fallen, there’s only one place that is absolutely safe, the Lanyang Earth Core. He said the same thing as your friend. The Lanyang Earth Core has raised many

brilliant Mages for the city,” Guan Songdi explained.

“What happened next?” Mo Fan asked.

Guan Songdi shook his head and said, “We headed to the place, but it was surrounded by Sharkmen who blocked our path. I managed to escape, but the rest of the group died.”

“Your law of survival has saved you many times,” Mo Fan scoffed.

Guan Songdi blushed, but he added, “I can bring you to the place, but you must bring me with you. I don’t want to stay with these people.”

“It’s more dangerous to go with us. Why don’t you want to hide here?” Mo Fan asked with a confused look.

“Humph, most survivors who are still alive in this city have most likely abandoned their friends, too! The Sharkmen are vicious and have sensitive noses. The only way to escape from their pursuit is for other living creatures to bleed and distract them. They are oddly passionate about the scent of blood!”

Guan Songdi conveyed his distrust of the other survivors.

“Fine, let’s move out while it’s still dark.” Mo Fan did not want to talk to the guy anymore.

Mo Fan had already searched the headquarters of the larger business not long ago. He had not found anything useful.

To his surprise, the entrance of the Lanyang Earth Core was close to the same building. It was located in a basement that looked like an underground car park.

If Guan Songdi had not brought them here and pried open the elevator shaft, they would have had no idea the shaft would lead them to a deeper level under the ground!

“There are a few corpses over there. It seems like he was telling the truth,” Mu Bai mentioned after he noticed them in the basement.

“Mn, let’s head down. The other survivors are well-protected at the hotel. The Sharkmen won’t find them as long as they stay indoors,” Mo Fan nodded. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Mo Fan led the way and jumped into the shaft.

The elevator had fallen to the bottom of the shaft after losing power. Mo Fan had jumped into the shaft from basement level two, but he was surprised when he had not reached the bottom after falling for more than thirty levels.

‘The Lanyang Earth Core was hidden so deep underground! It made a lot of sense to hide the city’s heirloom treasure in a place that no one would find easily

Mo Fan blended into the darkness as he reached the bottom. He was hovering above the elevator like a phantom.

“Come down here, I’m at the bottom!” Mo Fan shouted up, before prying open the elevator door.

The group left the elevator and saw an altar built from all kinds of magic ores and crystals. The altar area was not dark, the whole place being illuminated by crystal lamps that could last for several dozen years.

The center of the altar was empty. They found a spiraling staircase imbued with Lightning Element crystals hovering magically in the air.

‘The staircase was floating. One had to be extremely cautious around it.

“It looks like some kind of protection. If anyone doesn’t take the right steps, the altar will unleash a strong Lightning Magic to kill the intruder,” Mu Bai warned them.

Zhao Manyan glanced at Mu Bai and exclaimed, “How did you know all of that from just observing the strange staircase?”

“Didn’t you see the huge red warning sign over there? Can’t you read?” Mo Fan pointed.

Zhao Manyan followed Mo Fan’s finger and saw a huge warning sign, like something above a circuit box.

How awkward!, he coughed to himself.

“It looks like it’s the only way down,” Mu Bai went on.

“The altar is supported by the energy of the magic ores. We might be in trouble if we don’t go down the stairs in the right order,” Guan Songdi said.

“Why don’t you go first?” Mo Fan asked.

“Please don’t. I’m just a weak Mage. You can just treat me like I’m transparent,” Guan Songdi answered stiffly.

“If only Lingling is here, things would be much simpler,” Mo Fan sighed.

“Humph!”

‘The sound of a woman came from another entrance. The four turned that way and saw Jiang Shaoxu and Xinxia approaching them.

“It looks like it’s a draw between us. We have all found this place!” Jiang Shaoxu smiled.

Jiang Shaoxu and Xinxia had followed the pipes of the drinking water plant to the underground. They broke down a wall to reach the altar the pipes were connected to.

Mo Fan went over and noticed Xinxia’s hair was still wet. She must have swum through the canals to come here.

“Ican solve this,” Xinxia declared firmly.

Xinxia’s mental strength was outstanding. She closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she could see the flow of magic around her. Even if the pipes and crystals were blocked by walls and obstacles, she could still see their colorful energy in her eyes.

“Follow me,” Xinxia led the way. She landed on the left side of the first platform. It began to fall like it had lost its support.

It gave Mo Fan a huge fright. He quickly went over to help Xinxia, but the platform came to a stop after falling for thirty centimeters.

Xinxia continued forward and jumped to the third platform. The first platform quickly bounced up to its original position.

“Remember to stay on the left side of the platform so you won’t fall to the area where you will be attacked by lightning,” Xinxia warned them all.

“This altar has an interesting design. It’s like jumping to the right tiles while memorizing the order…” Mo Fan murmured.
