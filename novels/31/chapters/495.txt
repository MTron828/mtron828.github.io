“Meteorite!”

“Run, a meteorite is falling!”

“I can’t start my car’s engine... AH, it’s on fire!”

“The lights in the factory are all gone, quick, anybody, go and turn off the main switch...”

All of Lehuo Town was in a total mess. The people who were working overtime in the factory had no idea what was happening. They only felt a flicker, before all the lights went out!

Machinery that was powered up through combustion all broke down, including the cars on the roads. As the meteorite in the sky approached the ground, machinery that was powered up with Fire Magic Ores were set aflame by spontaneous combustion...

There were many factories in the area, thus there were lots of flammables around the place. Many factories were on fire, setting off piercing alarms. The workers ran away in panic, not caring less about the infrastructure in the factories!

The fire did not spread rapidly, thus it gave them enough time to escape. However, those who managed to run out into the open immediately saw a huge fireball, like the sun falling toward them, setting the entire sky aflame! The workers had no idea where they could possibly run to, and were left dumbfounded in place!

Luckily, the meteorite was only passing by the sky above Lehuo Town. Otherwise, the town would have turned into an ocean of flames, like Hell on Earth!

——

“Oh, mama!” Zhao Manyan raised his head and stared into the sky with disbelief.

The night sky was now brightly illuminated, the hill dyed blazing red by the light of the fire. The group was just discussing how impossible it was for the Fiery Sorceress to appear in the town, when they discovered the outline of a woman standing above the meteorite. She was standing on the meteorite that heralded a great calamity, sliding across the night sky!

Safe zone?

Fortresses?

When the Empress of the Burning Valley was infuriated, human defenses were nothing but mere decorations!

The descending meteorite served as a blatant warning to the humans who dared to touch her reverse scale!

The meteorite slammed into the hill and instantly razed half of it to the ground.

The villa was protected by a barrier. The meteorite would be reduced in half by the water-blue barrier. As such, the Fiery Sorceress simply aimed the meteorite at the hill instead...

The people in the villa were utterly dispirited. They simply stood there and watch the areas outside the barrier burn into ashes, completely vanishing from the world.

There were still quite a few Magicians patrolling on the other half of the hill. They had most likely evaporated together with it. They did not have the chance to scream for help, or even have the time to figure out what was happening.

At the pool in the villa, Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, Lingling, Xinxia, Chen Yi, Zhao Manyan, Mu Xiu and Mu Tingle all turned into statues, not believing what had happened outside of the barrier!

Half of the hill...

Half of the hill was gone, just like that!

If the meteorite was aimed at the villa instead, could the petty barrier even stop it?

Would the people in the villa even be alive by now?

A scorched land and some remaining flames replaced the dense plants that existed just a second before. A thick presence of destruction and death swept through in the direction of the barrier.

As the people were staring at this astonishing sight of Hell, the empress of the Burning Valley floated in the sky above the seemingly well-defended villa. Her eyes were burning with flames, yet they were emitting a cold gaze at everything around her.

She had appeared, when everyone was assuming that she could not possibly journey across half of China to reach the easternmost regions. She had chased after the group like a nightmare, and used her utterly destructive power to produce such an astonishing scene!

Her wrath was telling the humans that someone was about to pay a great price for the sins they had committed!

—

The Fiery Sorceress uttered a piercing shriek. Her gaze was fixed on where Mo Fan and the others were standing.

She stepped forward, bringing a wave of heat with her!

Chen Yi fell to the ground in fear at what she had witnessed, her very soul trembling.

She was the one that drove the Grimsteel Spike into the Fiery Sorceress’ back. She had come to get revenge, she must be here to take her revenge!

The Fiery Sorceress floated outside of the barrier. Her eyes squinted as she reached out her hand and grabbed in the direction of Mo Fan’s crew... 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When everyone assumed that she would simply murder Chen Yi despite standing outside of the barrier, Xinxia, who was sitting beside Mo Fan, was grabbed by some special force, which dragged her fragile body into the air...

“Xinxia!”

Mo Fan was shocked. He immediately activated the Blood Tabi and chased her out of the barrier simple-mindedly.

Xinxia seemed to be dragged away by some force. Her body quickly crossed the watery barrier, flying toward the Fiery Sorceress...

Mo Fan chased after her madly, who ignited a puff of scorching flame on his hand. It turned into a surging Fiery Fist, blasting at the Fiery Sorceress.

The Fiery Sorceress stood in the air. She cast a cold glance at Mo Fan, and easily spotted the Fiery Fist approaching her.

She waved her hand expressionlessly, easily nullifying Mo Fan’s Fiery Fist with some unknown power.

Mo Fan was speechless. How stupid was he, thinking that he could harm the Burning Valley Sorceress with her Fire Element? He was about to cast his Lightning Spell when he heard Xinxia communicating with her using her Psychic Element.

“Brother Mo Fan, she’s not trying to harm me.”

Mo Fan did not give up. He used the Fleeing Shadow and Blood Tabi at the same time, and quickly leapt onto a pine tree that was still unharmed.

Standing on top of the pine tree, Mo Fan was still a distance away from the Fiery Sorceress who was floating in the air. He looked upward at the Fiery Sorceress and the captured Xinxia.

“Let her go, she has nothing to do with this!” snapped Mo Fan furiously.

Mo Fan’s blood began to boil in the midst of his tantrum. He did not realize that while he was roaring at the Fiery Sorceress, the teeth from his upper jaw were growing longer. His black hair was also growing in length, and was slowly turning white under the illumination of the fire...

“I won’t hurt her. I just want to take my belongings back.” The Fiery Sorceress stood there like an imperious emperor.

She did not speak, yet Mo Fan could hear her voice.

He glanced at Xinxia, and realized that her mouth was open, speaking with a voice that did not belong to her.

“She’s a Psychic Magician, she will speak on my behalf...” said the Fiery Sorceress, her voice coming out of Xinxia’s mouth.
