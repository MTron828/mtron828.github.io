Chapter 2193: The Student Lecturer

Mu Bai nodded in agreement.

No one was better at fighting magic duels. He could just expose his true identity in the class and claim he was Mo Fan, who won the World College Tournament. The slots for the class would most likely sell out!

Those who came would be there to challenge him or learn something from him. His reputation alone was enough to attract a lot of attention!

However, Mo Fan would completely expose himself if he taught the class on magic dueling, mainly because he was just too famous across the world. People were already familiar with many of his moves, so asking him to teach magic theory was a way to keep his cover intact.

“If it doesn’t work out, just minimize the loss and hang around with First Prince Beny and the others during the next gathering. After all, we are here with some other goals in mind,” Mu Bai consoled him.

“Stop trying to comfort me. I’m going after the Black Vatican, but I’m not going to give up on my classes. I’m the leader of Fanxue Mountain. If I can’t achieve an impressive result at the Aorus Sacred Institute, how could I possibly live up to my reputation after we are back in our country?” Mo Fan scoffed.

“Mm, that’s the spirit! I like how you insist on delivering a parcel into the mountains even when you know there’s a tiger around!” Zhao Manyan raised his thumb at Mo Fan.

“Mo Fan, your next class will have to wait until next week. Zhao Manyan and I will be taking the students to the Andes Mountains. We’ve already asked around, and the price to hire a security guard is two hundred gold. Fifty students have signed up for the trip, and the school says we need at least five security guards, excluding the teachers, for a group of fifty students. Even if we hire the cheapest security guards, it will cost us a thousand and five hundred gold in total... if your class didn’t make a loss, we would have enough gold,” Zhao Manyan said.

“What are you trying to say?” Mo Fan demanded. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“If your classes aren’t doing well, why don’t you work for us? It would save us two hundred gold. Besides, you’re more than capable of looking after the students,” Mu Bai suggested.

“Screw you, I’m a lecturer, yet you’re asking me to be your security guard? Who do you think I am?”

“Are you in or not? Otherwise, you will have to pay with your own money. Two hundred gold is around two hundred thousand dollars, which is around a sixteen hundred thousand yuan. It’s not really a lot for you,” Mu Bai proposed.

“I’m going!”

“Can you make up your mind?!”

Money was not a huge problem for Mo Fan. It was a matter of pride!

How could a guest lecturer subsidize the costs with their own money?!

Mo Fan decided to work as a security guard for the time being and see if he could convince some of the students in the group to attend his classes next week.

He had given himself a little goal. His next class had to have more than ten students!

——

An excursion usually lasted for three to seven days. The students had to pay fifty gold, instead of two gold like the normal classes.

Fifty students had signed up for it, each paying fifty gold, so the total was twenty-five hundred gold.

If the students were satisfied and gave positive feedback to the school, they would also receive a bonus from the school. If they acquired valuable resources and the remains of demon creatures, they could sell them to the school too!

In other words, the basic salary for the excursion was twenty-five hundred gold, not including the bonus!

“We can earn a fortune from this and also get to know more about the students, seeing who might be a good candidate for magic duels. If they win the duels, they can earn money faster than your classes!” Zhao Manyan already had a plan in mind.

“We will only get our payment after the class is finished. We’ve pretty much used all the money we have. If the feedback from the students is bad, we won’t even get a thousand gold in return,” Mu Bai warned him.

“Say, weren’t we doing much better when we were students? Why do I feel like a beggar now that I’m a teacher?”

“Changing profession is as difficult as traversing mountains!”

—

Most of the students had signed up for the excursion because of Mu Bai.

Mu Bai had always been good at studying. His knowledge of demon creatures was not necessarily less than Mo Fan and Mu Bai, so most of the students were here because of him.

After all, Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were not good at teaching!

Even though Mo Fan was not willing to admit it, he and Zhao Manyan were basically Mu Bai’s assistants, since his presence was able to attract students to their classes!

“Mo Fan, your tail is here again,” Zhao Manyan pointed at Sharjah, who stood out among the students.

The students had no idea Sharjah had signed up for the excursion too. They were very excited to see her, especially the men!

“Normally, the excursions I sign up for would attract more than a hundred students, so I decide to sign up anonymously to make it easier for you to see how many students you have. It’s also easier to manage and figure out ways to improve your classes,” Sharjah told them sincerely.

“Actually, you can leak a little information about your whereabouts. We are almost at the end of the line,” Mo Fan said with a wry smile.

If she could bring in a hundred more students, that would be five thousand gold. Why wasn’t she being considerate this time?

“I’m also a student, and the student union’s president. If you want to know what the students are interested in, I can tell you about it,” Sharjah suggested to him.

“That will be great. You are my only hope!” Mo Fan agreed instantly.

“It’s best if you combine your theories with the classes of demon creatures and magic duels. I can tell pure theory isn’t your area of expertise,” Sharjah proposed first.

“You’re right. I might have the knowledge, but I’m not good at teaching others,” Mo Fan agreed handily.

“If you are confident in your strength and knowledge, I suggest you go after the Mountain Men in the Andes Mountains! The school always treats the Mountain Men as a serious threat. They are savage and difficult to track. They have two great hobbies: hunting humans and collecting humans’ valuables. If there’s an excursion related to the Mountain Men, a lot of students will sign up for it,” Sharjah said seriously.

“Sharjah, we also plan to choose the Mountain Men as our topic, but not only does the school require us to hire ten security guards, the students will choose the teachers they have faith in. The students of your school aren’t familiar with us three,” Mo Fan said.

“You can hang a sheep’s head while selling dog meat. You might focus on the mountain beasts, but I believe every student is interested in the Mountain Men. You can just finish the class early and spend the rest of the time on the Mountain Men. As long as their lives aren’t in danger, they will easily spread positive news around after seeing the Mountain Men. Our school’s student circles aren’t that big. Next time, more students will be willing to pay and sign up for your classes, once they learn your strength and your willingness to go on adventures to take on higher-level creatures,” Sharjah told him.

Mo Fan nodded.

He had learned a lot from Sharjah. She was right that every student was interested in seeing powerful demon creatures, instead of the weak ones which most lecturers would target as a safety precaution. The lecturers who were able to guarantee the students’ safety while teaching them about stronger demon creatures were well-received by the students!

“Thank you, Sharjah.”

“You’re welcome, Lecturer Mo Yifan.”

Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai rolled their eyes.

Why did it sound like Sharjah was a knowledgeable lecturer and Mo Fan was just an obedient student who kept nodding like a chick pecking at grains?

And yet, they were still referring to one another as lecturer and student!

They were treating one another sincerely with a clear boundary based on their seniority. Could they be a little more reliable?
