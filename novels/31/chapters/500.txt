Chen Yi stared at her mother Jiang Feng in disbelief. She could not understand why Jiang Feng would ask her to do such a thing. However, the white cloth was covering her mother’s face. Chen Yi was unable to see her mother’s expression.

“Are you out of your mind? How could you ask her to do that?” yelled Zhao Yulin.

Even an Advanced Magician would be burned to ashes when moving closer to the Fiery Sorceress. Chen Yi would simply walk to her death. The fact that the sneak attack had worked the first time did not mean the Fiery Sorceress, who was on alert this time, would spare Chen Yi’s life!

“Just believe me,” said Jiang Feng confidently.

“But I...” Chen Yi hesitated. For a second, she couldn’t think.

“Chen Yi, listen to me. Do it quick, we can only freeze her for a short time. Do you seriously want to see everyone here killed by this Fire demon beast? Just do what I say, and you’ll be fine. Kill her, and there won’t be any more casualties. The Fire Calamity Fruit will also replenish my health, your father’s status will also rise...” Jiang Feng said, with a hint of excitement.

Chen Yi bit her lips.

She believed that her mother would not lie to her. An icy spike appeared in her hand.

The spike was similar to a spear, but both ends were sharp. One could only hold the spike with both hands somewhere in the middle. The icy flicker from the sharp edges implied that the Weapon contained a deadly poison!

“Walk forward, don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Walk up to her, and stab her in the heart!” urged Jiang Feng.

Chen Yi seemed to be very obedient when it came to listening to her mother. She actually held the icy equipment and walked toward the Fiery Sorceress, who was frozen in ice.

The Fiery Sorceress was like a statue, completely stationary in her position. The ice was transparent, so she could see Chen Yi walking toward her. The girl was less than a hundred meters from her.

The Dark Flame was able to destroy everything within a hundred meters. Normally, if Chen Yi took a few more steps forward, the domain of Dark Flame would burn her into ashes.

“You weren’t like this before,” Zhao Yulin turned his head and glanced at Jiang Feng, who was wrapped in white cloth.

“A person will always change,” said Jiang Feng.

“But what if the Dark Flame actually burns Chen Yi to death?” said Zhao Yulin with a deep voice.

“It won’t.”

“You’re that confident?”

“I won’t play around with your daughter’s life.”

“She’s your daughter too,” reminded Zhao Yulin.

——

The Fiery Sorceress was frozen. The ocean of flames that was spreading wildly was finally under control.

Mo Fan and his group were finding a way out of the place, yet they realized that only the area where Zhao Yulin, Jiang Feng, Shi Gua, and the others were standing was free of fire. They were trying to cross the place when they saw Chen Yi walking toward the Fiery Sorceress.

“Brother, wai...wait...” The half-conscious Xinxia suddenly uttered softly.

“What is it?” asked Mo Fan with a confused look.

“Stop...Chen Yi, stop her...” Xinxia seemed to be extremely weak. The overwhelming mental pressure had left her in a half-dreaming state. She still could not regain full consciousness, and was still mumbling her words.

Xinxia’s voice was very blurred. She seemed to be saying something else, yet the group could not figure out what she was saying.

Mo Fan could roughly make some sense of it. Xinxia was asking him to stop Chen Yi when she saw what Chen Yi was trying to do in her current half-conscious state.

“Look after her,” Mo Fan placed Xinxia down and hurried over to Chen Yi.

It seemed like Xinxia was trying to tell the group something extremely important.

However, she just could not wake up. It was like she had fallen into someone’s dream. The fact that she was trying so hard easily implied how important it was.

“Chen Yi, don’t go over, you will be burned to death!” Mo Fan yelled at Chen Yi from a hundred meters away.

Chen Yi halted in her steps. She turned around and looked at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had spent some time with the Fiery Sorceress. He knew that the Fiery Sorceress had two kinds of flames. Chen Yi had managed to harm the Fiery Sorceress as she was being careless, but it did not necessarily mean the Fiery Sorceress would simply let Chen Yi do it again. The girl was about to get herself killed!

“Don’t listen to him. Just do as you’re told, and you’ll be fine. Are you seriously not listening to me?!” Jiang Feng let out a sharp scream when she saw Chen Yi hesitating.

Jiang Feng turned toward Mo Fan and snapped, “Mind your own business!”

Mo Fan had no intention of involving himself with other’s business, but the Fiery Sorceress did save his life. He could not simply stand there and watch this happen.

It was most likely that Jiang Feng had found a way to make Chen Yi immune to the Fiery Sorceress’ Dark Flame. It was hard to tell how long Jiang Feng had been planning this, from the ambush, to the transfer, and the defensive formation, and the final killing blow to be executed by Chen Yi. It felt like she had arranged it all!

Chen Yi ended up listening to her mother. She stepped into the Fiery Sorceress’ domain...

It took her great effort to take the step, as it was no different than stepping into the jaws of death. However, she desperately wanted to help her mother escape the sea of agony. She had already suffered for over ten years. If the Fiery Sorceress was willing to give up on the Fire Calamity Fruit, she would not hurt the creature...

Zhao Yulin and Shi Gua felt their hearts skipping a beat. Chen Yi had stepped into the Fiery Sorceress’ domain, and there was a chance she would be burned into ashes in the next second!

However, it did not happen.

Chen Yi was still alive. She was able to step into the Fiery Sorceress’ domain perfectly unharmed.

Chen Yi opened her eyes and glanced at her body in disbelief.

“Go, she’s breaking out from the ice!” yelled Jiang Feng.

Chen Yi was overjoyed. As she thought, her mother would not lie to her. Although she could not tell what the reason was, she would worry about it after killing the Fiery Sorceress.

Chen Yi clenched the Breaking Profaner tightly. The distance of a hundred meters did not take long to cross. She quickened her pace, and made sure the sharp tip of the Breaking Profaner was aimed at the Fiery Sorceress’ heart!

——

Mo Fan stared at the scene with astonishment not far away.

-Chen Yi was able to step into the Fiery Sorceress’ strongest domain?

-Does her body really have some unique resistance?

-No, that’s not right!-

-Chen Yi was not immune to the Dark Flame!-

“Chen Yi, stop now!” Mo Fan came to an understanding in the shortest time. He burst out screaming at Chen Yi, “She...”

“Enough with that!” Jiang Feng screamed from the attic.

Under the white cloth, her eyes emitted an eerie glow. It felt like her eyes were able to penetrate one’s body, deep into the soul, which would tremble slightly under the gaze.

Psychic Element!

Chen Yi’s mother was a Psychic Magician, too!

Mo Fan tried to stop Chen Yi, yet when the Psychic Spell struck him, he lost control of his body, and was not able to make any noise.

“What are you waiting for, kill her!”

Jiang Feng screamed wildly. After casting the Mind Control on Mo Fan, she proceeded to cast a powerful Psychic Spell on Chen Yi.
