Chapter 192 - Mother Beast Emerging!

Zhao Manyan’s face turned gloomy. If Lingling hadn’t accidentally taken a look at the sensor, then who would’ve thought that these lady volunteers actually had another skin?

“I’ll handle this.” Zhao Manyan looked around his surroundings and realized that the girls who had subconsciously walked over here had begun to increase.

The group of volunteers was acting quite strange. If it was just two people accidentally coming into this area, then there was no need for them to bring the whole group here, was there?

At the front of the tunnel and at the back, there were many girls who suddenly opened their doors into the tunnel and poked their heads out. There were also some who looked like they were celebrities preparing to take up an important role in the rehearsal, their eyes also suddenly on Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

“Be careful!” After Mo Fan said this to Zhao Manyan, his body strangely sank into the shadow beneath his feet. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Manyan nodded, his gaze attentively scanning through the people in his surroundings.

Just when he was going to turn his body to watch how Mo Fan passed through these little demons, Zhao Manyan was shocked to realize that Mo Fan was nowhere to be seen!

The lights were overlapping in this tunnel. There just happened to be one light in the tunnel that was not functional. Zhao Manyan happened to see a silhouette flashing by really quickly in that dusky area, and after that, he no longer saw any traces of Mo Fan.

“A Shadow Magical Tool?…” Zhao Manyan said to himself.

------

Zhao Manyan was a Light Magician. He possessed the incredibly powerful Intermediate Magic spell, Holy Shield, so even if he wanted to die, it wouldn’t be such an easy matter.

Mo Fan didn’t turn around to watch Zhao Manyan fight. He didn’t think that the disciple of an esteemed family would have such little ability.

What he needed to do was quickly kill the Mother Scale Skin Phantom. When all of the red dots gathered in the middle of the gymnasium, then this matter would be out of his control!

“Mo Fan, hurry up!” Lingling’s voice turned increasingly anxious.

“I am at the platform that you mentioned. There are some people here, and one is a girl who is wearing a rather bright and colorful garment, she must be the main idol for the rehearsal this time. By her side, there’s someone who takes care of her clothes, her makeup person, and her manager…” Mo Fan gave Lingling the details of what he was seeing.

Mo Fan was standing in the corner with his eyes on the lifting platform’s entrance.

It looked like there were around seven or eight people by the entrance. There was also a few workers walking left and right.

“Miss, you must be careful. If this lift has some problems, then I don’t think I can explain anything to the boss,” the female manager said, her face filled with concern.

“It won’t!” the girl that was in the center of an entourage said with a sweet smile.

Mo Fan looked closely and realized that this girl was identical to the famous idol that he had seen on the big poster at the entrance. When she smiled, she appeared so innocent!

“Alright, alright. The tech auntie inside, please control it properly, don’t let our Cucu fall.”

“Don’t worry, this equipment won’t have problems. Young lady, come in, your rehearsal is about to start!”

“What young lady, she’s a famous idol!” the manager said with dissatisfaction.

“Yeah yeah yeah, famous idol.”

Mo Fan continuously observed all this while listening to Lingling’s instructions.

When the opportunity came, Mo Fan once more used the Escaping Shadow and stealthily hid behind the people.

“Alright, we’re closing.” The technician auntie pressed the button and the door slowly closed.

This hydraulic lift actually looked similar to a large scaled elevator packaged into a small elevator that was suspended in the air. When the performers slowly descended onto the stage, all the gymnasium lights would also gather on that spot. The effect was quite stunning…

“Cucu!!!!!”

“Cucu!!!!!!!!!!!”

In the middle of the venue, the students who had been touched by the rhythm of the music had already began to sing along to the chorus.

This idol has already deeply entered the hearts of the people through her sweet and cute appearance, and her beautiful, pleasant voice. Whether she was dancing or singing, she was able to intoxicate people.

In the middle of the venue, the people began to shout her name.

The idol Cucu was already standing in the middle of the platform, she closed her eyes to feel the voices of everyone.

This was only a rehearsal, yet there was already so many enthusiasts from the school come to watch. One had to know that there were many two and three tier stars that would only have a few people present even during an actual performance.

She was extremely gratified. She thought to herself that she needed to give them a proper performance, even if it was only a rehearsal.

“Auntie, you can let me down. I am ready!” She opened her eyes as she spoke to the technician auntie who was in control of the lift.

“Don't be nervous!” the technician auntie said as she chuckled.

“I am fine.”

“Oh, what I meant is that you don't have to be nervous over anything. Because today, I am the main character here.” The technician auntie who appeared to be somewhat benevolent suddenly displayed a strange smile.

She smiled while she sized up the girl’s body. It looked like her mouth could open impossibly wide, and her sharp teeth were stained with brown blood.

The technician Auntie’s hands changed, turning into what looked like rubber as she slowly extended them.

What extended was not only the bones of her finger, but even her nails were turning green; they looked like sharpened daggers. They even had a thin barb!

The skin on her body began to peel off, bit by bit. What seemed to be a thirtyish woman’s face turned into dark green scales, and those scales were plastered together with some kind of liquid. It looked incredibly disgusting.

“Silaaaaa~~~!”

Her clothes were like paper as she torn them apart with her sharp claws. What was revealed was not the nude body of a woman, but a body covered in scales!

A long tongue stretched out, so long that it could even reach the front of the girls face!

The fishy red tongue was moving in front of her, and the girl was just standing there looking completely dumbstruck.

There was nothing more scary in this world than a person who shed her skin to reveal a demon covered in scales. The idol was so scared that her mind turned blank, legs trembling as she stood there, about to fall.

“Today, my children can finally eat ourselves full. This is all thanks to your rehearsal…” the scaled monster said with a human voice. However, she sounded as though her throat was filled with something; it was extremely hoarse!

“Sssssss!!!”

“Ssssssssssss!!!”

Suddenly, the Mother Scale Skin Phantom raised her head and let out a sound toward the middle of the venue.

This cry seemed like a monster’s mother, yelling at its kids to wake up!

The sound didn’t need any equipment to reach the center of the venue as it continuously echoed about.

The idol girl turned her head to look down with difficulty, and realized that the packed amount of people were beginning to get restless.

They all looked like herself, extremely shocked as they began to scatter.

Just when they were about to take a step back, they realized yet another scene had emerged to their sides. Chunks of skin fell down, and monsters with scales appeared, one after another!

“Aaaaaaahhh!!!”

“AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!”

For a moment, girls screaming were what could be heard the loudest in the center of the venue. The aura of fear immediately spread through the air!
