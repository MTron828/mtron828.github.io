Zhan Kong lifted his gaze, and eventually continued on his way.

His black boots landed on bricks covered in the blue imprints. It felt like something was drawing away the energy inside his body with every step he took and transferring it to the flowers.

The sunflowers blossomed further while its fragrance grew stronger. The deathly Aura around Zhan Kong dissipated gradually, and his robe continued to fragment.

“His power is weakening,” Angel Raphael noticed.

“Wait a little longer.” Head Angel Michael remained calm.

Michael could feel the Sacred City Mages losing their morale. They were no longer as high-spirited as they were at the start of the battle. He could even see fear in their eyes.

The brave warriors who had initiated the attack had been wiped out. The Sacred City Mages were feeling extremely nervous. The whole Formation realized a God of Death was approaching them!

Zhan Kong kept coming forward. The undead energy in his body was rapidly drained away. His imperious appearance, that of a man in his prime of life, was now showing signs of age.

The undead had their life energy, too. Zhan Kong was one of the living dead. When his living aura was absorbed by the sunflowers, all that was left would be the aged and wilted body of an undead!

However, he kept moving forward.

He was still a great distance away from the woman. He could see neither her face nor the look in her eyes clearly.

This path was supposed to lead him to destruction, but he had never thought he would be safe after setting his foot into the city. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He knew the Forbidden Curse of the Sunflowers scattered across the city was unresolvable, so he boldly stepped forward and let it take away whatever it was after inside his body!

His dark robe continued to deteriorate, and his sinister Aura was suppressed too. The golden dragon circling nearby let out a roar and charged at him with its horn.

“Piss off!” Zhang Kong yelled angrily. His eyes were as red as a devil’s.

As he raised his arm, and thousands of sturdy horses made of dark copper charged at the golden dragon.

The golden dragon was knocked back by the horses, losing a huge amount of scales again. The horses even pierced through a few spots on its armored body. Dragon’s blood, covered by a dark Aura, was pouring out.

The golden dragon’s blood was capable of cleansing darkness, yet its wounds kept worsening as a black Aura rose from it.

The golden dragon was surrounded by the horses. It opened its mouth and unleashed its dragon breath!

The dragon’s breath was golden, like the sunlight had suddenly pried open the stormy clouds and shone down upon the vast land.

The demon horses collapsed when the dragon’s breath encapsulated them, turning into ashes. The golden dragon finally eliminated them, but it saw that Zhan Kong had already reached the Formation of Mages by the time it turned around.

The Mages were controlling the roots and stems of the sunflowers, moving them rapidly in the city to form a huge mountain of roots and stems in front of Zhan Kong. The twining mound was almost high enough to reach the real Sacred City on the ground. The two cities were connected by these blue plants.

“Bloodthirsty Evil Wind!”

Zhan Kong clenched his hands into claws and swung them at the mound of plants!

The blood-red wind swept at the plants. It not only targeted those in front of him, but those in the surroundings too! The Bloodthirsty Evil Wind started clearing away the plants across a huge area.

The roots and stems were shattered, and pieces of blue leaves scattered in the air. Yet every time Zhan Kong cleared an area, dense roots and stems would fill up the space again, blocking Zhan Kong’s path and trapping him within the sunflowers.

The golden dragon was the first Forbidden Curse Summoning Spell that Michael had prepared for the Undead Emperor. The Plant Forbidden Curse was the real deal, one that Gabriel had prepared to defeat the Undead Emperor!

“In the families you grew up in, some old men must have mentioned your impressive ancestors, who provided you with a peaceful environment to grow up in. They are the pride of your families. Do you know that even if you die in this battle today, your children and descendants will also see you as a memorable senior of your families? Will you run away and live, or will you glorify your ancestors? I believe you have all made your choice!” Michael proclaimed.

They could not afford to lose their morale. No matter how strong the enemy was, they must not show their fear!

Weren’t the sunflowers symbols of an unyielding spirit?

“I, Michael, am with you all!”

Michael jumped down from the tower, flying over to the mountain of stems and roots that was growing continuously. A sacred blue light burst out of his body as he stood on the highest point aloofly.

His sacred blue robe transformed into the illusionary figure of an angel behind him, spreading its layers of wings. Their light was strong enough to light up the entire land.

The Sacred Blue Robe of Feathers!

Michael had finally made his move. He was most likely one of the strongest Forbidden Mages that people had ever had the chance to see in action. His presence had already surpassed that of a human. He was like a heavenly spirit residing in the flesh of a man!

Zhan Kong watched Michael, the only person that was worthy of his attention in the battle.

The levels of humans and demon creatures were inequivalent. For example, only a team of Super Mages was strong enough to challenge a single Ruler-level creature.

Similarly, an Emperor-level creature would not necessarily see a Forbidden Mage as a threat. Reynold was a Forbidden Mage, yet he was extremely weak in Zhan Kong’s eyes, since with his magic, only the golden dragon could pose a little threat to Zhan Kong!

However, there were great differences between Forbidden Mages, too!

Michael and Raphael, the two Angels, were a lot stronger than Reynolds. However, Raphael was not showing any intent to take part in the battle.

There were only seven Angels in the Sacred City. Michael would have to sort out his battle himself. Many powerful demon creatures were watching the Sacred City like tasty prey. If they somehow lost two Angels in the battle, the Sacred City would be in great danger, and so would mankind!

They might be fighting for the peace to take place in a thousand years, yet they had to make sure the city was safe in the current times, too! Raphael was not going to use a single spell.

Zhan Kong seemed a little disappointed when he realized Michael was his only opponent.

“Just you?” Zhan Kong looked at Michael.

“Isn’t it enough?” Michael replied.

“Even the seven of you wouldn’t be enough!” Zhan Kong said.

“You might be strong enough to take on the seven of us outside the Sacred City, but you won’t be able to overcome the Forbidden Curse of the Sunflowers. You will soon run out of oil like a lamp...” Michael answered confidently.
