Jiang Yu was very thorough with his explanation, but Mo Fan simply lost interest in listening further. He only wanted to know about the participants that were said to be the strongest in the tournament.

The finals were just around the corner. Mo Fan was brimming with confidence. Currently, only his Shadow Element was slightly weaker, but he had always regarded the Shadow Element as a supporting Element. The fifth-tier Fleeing Shadow with the effects of the Dark Noble Mantle granted Mo Fan outstanding mobility and evasive ability compared to the rest of the participants. If he had a chance to establish the Nyx Regime, the unpredictable Shadow Element would be quite deadly, too!

The only pity was that Mo Fan had not learned the Advanced Spell of the Summoning Element yet. Mo Fan did not forget the ridiculousness when Jiang Yu Summoned the tide of beasts. With that, Mo Fan was confident that he could take on ten participants at once!

Early in the morning, the loud chime of an ancient bell rang, waking the people of the city on the Mediterranean Sea from their pleasant dreams.

Following the chime, some Italian melodies were played. It felt like the air was fresher when listening to the symphonies.

The opening ceremony of the finals was held. Eight teams with outstanding performances during the treasure hunt lined up in rows in the middle of the spectacular and spacious dueling ground of Venice. Eight colors representing eight nations were surrounded by tens of thousands of people cheering for the participants.

Eight teams, with close to a hundred people. Even though the teams that were disqualified did have some outstanding talents, they were disqualified with the team too. Their reputation and influence in society in the future would be incomparable to the hundred people currently standing on the dueling ground.

When it came to a Mage’s strength, although there might be different situations, environments, and opponents that would decide the outcome of a battle, if two Mages were of equal strength, it was the opportunity and glory that would set them apart.

Four matches were scheduled today. Basically, all eight countries would take turns displaying their strength, and the result of the matches would decide the matches for tomorrow, and likewise, there would be four matches then, too.

The teams would no longer be disqualified, but the result of the matches would decide who the champion would be!

“There will be five matches for each team. Basically, we’ll be fighting most of the teams, and it’s quite obvious that we’ll have to give our best when we’re up against the top four countries. If we can keep our winning rate at fifty percent against those countries, we’ll have a chance to be ranked in the top three in the tournament. There are only prizes for the teams in the top three, and even though I don’t want to add more pressure, there’s something you should know too...” Feng Li said to the team sternly.

“What is it?” Mo Fan asked.

Everyone knew Mo Fan was as ignorant as an illiterate, so even Zu Jiming, Mu Tingying, Guan Yu, and the other arseholes were too lazy to mock him whenever he asked a foolish question.

Coming from renowned clans, it went without saying that they would know a lot more information than the others. The World College Tournament was the biggest magic tournament in the world, as it was usually how the countries split the scarce resources in a fair manner.

With demon creatures on the rampage, and humans being forced to stay within their cities, there were only limited resources left for the humans. As for the scarce, yet extremely important resources, it was unreasonable for the great powers of the world to simply claim them. They needed a fair, civilized way to decide which country would be getting resources...

The way they came up with was to let students of each country compete against one another. It was why the first World College Tournament was held!

The final ranking of the tournament was extremely important, as it would decide how the scarce resources were going to be distributed among the countries. If a country ended up with an A-grade magic ore vein, the energy was enough for the country to build a new city, a great fortress, or an abundant supply of magic ores to Awaken new Mages. The supply of magic ores each year would allow the country to train tens of thousands of Mages, and regardless of the height that these Mages could reach, they would still greatly improve the strength of a country.

The way the countries decided on the distribution of the resources was not disclosed to the public, yet it was the most reasonable way to do it.

Mo Fan realized something after hearing the explanation. “No wonder the country is treating this tournament so seriously, and is so willing to invest in us! It turns out that the countries are the ones that benefit the most from the World College Tournament, based on the ranking! Speaking of which, I’ve been fairly outstanding so far in the tournament, allowing our team to reach the finals without any risk. Isn’t the country going to reward me somehow? What if Japan attempts to persuade me to be their citizen by promising me two glamorous women, or if England offers me a mansion that is worth tens of billions, full of maids that don’t wear their panties in exchange for my loyalty to the Queen, or...”

The rest of the team pretended they never knew Mo Fan when he was uttering nonsense. Only a grass-roots Mage like Mo Fan, who did not really take any resources from the country, could be so wanton and unrestrained in a situation like this.

He was not under any clan or association, nor was obliged to anyone in particular. He could embarrass himself as he pleased, yet it was not the case for the others. They were obliged to follow the compass and go with the set square. Each of their actions was being watched at all times, and if they were disrespectful and impolite toward their leaders, advisors, or the officials of the tournament, it would greatly influence the reputation of their renowned clans...

“It seems like you’re a fan of beautiful women instead of money. Sure, tell me what kind of women, or which daughters of the renowned clans you’re interested in. Many people are willing to give me face in China, at least I can guarantee you that they won’t dare to kick you out if I ask them to accept you,” a middle-aged man said in a gentle, yet earnest voice.

“Chairman!”

“Chairman!”

Feng Li and Song He immediately went up to the man respectfully, without their usual stern attitude as the advisors of the team.

“Holy crap, one of the leaders of our country...” Zhao Manyan exclaimed in his heart. He immediately lifted his chest, displaying the expected demeanor of a son of the wealthiest clan in the country!

The others straightened up in a humble manner too, including Ai Jiangtu, who withdrew his pride as a soldier and saluted the man.

Shao Zheng responded with a salute, too. It turned out that the Chairman had come from a military background. However, when Mo Fan was observing the great BOSS of his country, he did not feel any difference between him and a househusband he might stumble into at a fresh market. Frankly speaking, compared to his father Mo Jiaxin, this man was only dressed in better clothes, with a slightly more dignified presence, but he could not really tell anything else!

If the man was a leader of his country, it went without saying that he would be one of the strongest Mages in his country, too, but Mo Fan was unable to sense any presence of magic from him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Were all the legendary experts supposed to look just like an ordinary person? How did the man manage to conceal his magic so thoroughly?

“Mo Fan, behave yourself in front of the chairman. You should think of the chance to serve your country as the utmost glory. After all, you’re still a representative of the Chinese team!” Feng Li scolded him. He proceeded to whisper into Mo Fan’s ear with his Psychic Voice, “If you dare betray the country by joining other countries, I swear I’m going to break your legs!”

“I was just saying, why so serious? I’m honored to serve the country, and I’m not asking for a reward... but of course I will gladly accept it if there’s any! Forget about pulling strings for me, I can pick up chicks myself. Besides, I believe there are not many Mages that I can’t handle who aren’t married yet,” Mo Fan smiled.

“Mo Fan, are you going to die before becoming more humble?” Feng Li’s mustache started to rise in anger.

“HAHA, you’re being very honest. I did beat the crap out of the man who tried to compete with me for my wife. Initially, my wife preferred men that are good-looking, but she realized that I’m pretty cool whenever I’m beating someone up, so we ended up together!” Shao Zheng burst out laughing.

“Chairman... isn’t it inappropriate to say that now!?” an old secretary coughed.

“I’m here to encourage you verbally, but I’m afraid I didn’t have any substantial rewards with me,” Shao Zheng said.

“Chairman, your encouragement is the best reward for us,” Zu Jiming took the opportunity to fawn on the man.

“Very well. Apart from the encouragement, there are a few things I would like to say. Regardless of the factions you’re representing, I’m hoping you will understand that due to the complicated terrain of our country, we are constantly under the threat of the demon creatures. Our country is actually ranked fifth in terms of the level of the danger we are under, but we’ve managed to attain resources granted to a country that is merely ranked in the top twenty to hold off the danger! It’s not because the Mages of our country are stronger, but the fact that we have a higher population. It simply means more people are sacrificing their lives to protect their country, and I’m sorry to say that China has the highest number of deaths of Mages in the world.

“You’ve done a great job coming so far, but I have a greater hope for you, to secure a higher ranking, and earn more resources for the country. I hope that you’ll think about the people that are struggling at the boundary of the safe zone right when you’re thinking of giving up, and ask yourself... have you really reached your limit? Can you go beyond that... and just try to get another rank higher? The little resource you earn for the country might prevent tens of thousands of soldiers from dying. Please!” Shao Zheng’s tone went from calm to solemn, to sincere, and finally with a hint of pleading, despite his identity.

Shao Zheng had clearly brought his hope for the team in the World College Tournament.

The leader of a country always had his focus on the wellbeing of a country, a country that was occasionally under the threat of the demon creatures roaming all over. The nests, the hordes, the kingdoms, the vast lands, the mountain ranges, the boundless oceans, the complicated lakes, the dry deserts, the icy northern valley... too many demon creatures were eying the cities covetously. The citizens living in the cities might be unaware, but as Mages, they had to keep the threat in mind at all times!

Hearing Shao Zheng’s words, Mo Fan recalled the words that Headmaster Zhu had spoken to the students at the opening ceremony of the high school, prior to the Awakening of their magic...

From the weakest students who were only Basic Mages, to the highly-respected Advanced Mages participating in the World College Tournament, they should always set their eyes on the demon creatures that never had once given up on the thought of invading their territory!
