They went to the Sky Coconut Grove and saw the night sky was shrouded by the huge leaves. There was not even a glimpse of light.

Mo Fan climbed up the trunks to the canopy. The leaves were big enough to support his weight, and swayed like see-saws when he stood on them.

Mo Fan was satisfied as long as there were places he could put his feet. That being said, he had to be wary of the spots where the leaves were less stacked, as he might fall right through them if he applied too much force on them.

Chen Shuo told Mo Fan that Evil Star preferred staying in the canopy, but Mo Fan did not see the Manta Ray Bird Emperor after scanning his surroundings. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The leaves were stacked in layers at certain spots. Mo Fan looked up, and soon noticed two jagged black wings extending slightly at an angle of forty-five degrees.

The Manta Ray Bird Emperor had the body of a ray, so when it slowly extended its wings, the moonlight eventually shone upon its body. It felt like the night sky was the designated stage for it. Its body reflected a cold silver sheen!

Mo Fan was a little dazzled by the creature’s appearance. Even though the Manta Ray Evil Birds had a menacing appearance, animals like manta rays and bats were two of the more ugly and scary types, so the Manta Ray Evil Birds that possessed the lineage of the two species would naturally fall into the same category. However, that was not the case for the creature that was currently extending its sharp wings above the trees. In Mo Fan’s eyes, the creature had perfect curves and edges, with extremely smooth skin. It looked like a typical spaceship in science-fiction instead!

“So that’s Evil Star...” Mo Fan murmured.

It looked so cool!

Mo Fan was not a well-educated man. It was the only term he could come up with under the circumstances. The creature looked so f**king cool!

When Mo Fan first saw the Manta Ray Evil Birds, he had been surprised by the unique appearance of the species. Little did he know that their ruler’s appearance was even more perfect. Imagine the creature soaring past or hovering above a bustling city. It would easily attract a bunch of screams of disbelief!

Why did they even bother taming the Manta Ray Evil Birds which looked like bats and manta rays? Only the Manta Ray Bird Emperor was worthy of his time!

“Apas, I’m pretty fond of that bird. You must take it down for me, do you understand?” Mo Fan blurted out in excitement. His gaze never left Evil Star.

Cool, how cool, only a creature like it was worthy for a handsome genius like him! The Flying Creek Snow Wolf with his snow-white skin, the lineage of the ice valley, and a perfect combination of the strength and elegance of his muscles suddenly felt like a weasel rolling around in the snow when compared to the Manta Ray Bird Emperor that resembled a metallic battle jet!

Mo Fan was initially unwilling to sacrifice himself to take on a Ruler-inferior creature, but he was now greatly anticipating making the creature his new mount. He immediately found the motivation to fight the creature!

It was like the goddess whom he had been dreaming of had finally appeared before him. He immediately had an urge to conquer her! His blood was already boiling!

A Ruler-inferior creature!

Mo Fan had rarely fought a Ruler-level creature alone. He was now curious about whether he was strong enough to face a Ruler-inferior creature alone!

“Keep staring at it, I will provoke it through your eyes,” Apas spoke in Mo Fan’s mind.

Mo Fan prepared himself and followed Apas’ instructions.

The Manta Ray Bird Emperor was clearly aware of Mo Fan’s existence. It was stretching to loosen its bones by extending its wings.

Following Apas’ provocation, Evil Star spread its wings and soared into the sky. Unlike how birds usually lifted off into the sky, the Manta Ray Bird Emperor simply turned into a strange ray of light and sprang into the night sky. Its wings remained still at its sides. From Mo Fan’s angle, it looked like a sword with a triangle tip encapsulated by a blue-silver glow had flown into the pitch-black sky in an unstoppable manner. Mo Fan was dazzled by its imposing appearance once again!

“Mo Fan, we’re ready!” Jiang Shaoxu yelled from the base below.

“You may begin. This Evil Star is mine nevertheless!” Mo Fan had a firm and passionate look in his eyes.

The situation clearly contained all the joy and significance of going on an adventure. It had allowed Mo Fan to witness the wonders of nature and the charm of different species. The way the Manta Ray Bird Emperor took off into the sky stabbed Mo Fan right in the heart, which was pounding heavily, similar to the feeling of falling in love at first sight!

The sound of machines operating came from below, followed by the crackling of electricity. The energy of the Psychic Element surged through the nettings and gathered at a certain point like a lightning rod.

A lightning bolt without a single fork sprang toward the Manta Ray Bird Emperor.

The Manta Ray Bird Emperor was flying in the sky. However, Mo Fan only noticed the chain between the Manta Ray Bird Emperor and the rod at the center of the nets after the brilliance of the lightning lit up the area. The chain was long enough to reach the clouds in the night sky while connected to the netting. It was binding the Manta Ray Bird Emperor as it soared into the sky!

“What’s with that!?” Mo Fan immediately asked Chen Shuo.

There was no response from below. The Psychic Magic kept gathering at the rod through the nettings before being transmitted via the chain!

The chain swayed in the strong wind, producing some unpleasant clanking. The Manta Ray Bird Emperor obviously could not reach the height it was aiming for. It dragged the chain, now over a few hundred meters long, into the sky. The creature was more like a kite flying in the sky, but the string controlling it was a chain instead!

“Mo Fan, don’t worry about it, the old man said the chain is keeping it here so it won’t vent its frustrations on the people nearby... Just hurry up and beat it, it’s almost morning,” Jiang Shaoxu replied.

Mo Fan frowned.

Chen Shuo mentioned that the metallic gravel was something the Manta Ray Evil Birds were afraid of, but the Manta Ray Bird emperor was tied by a chain made of the same metal. He was lying when he mentioned the creature preferred to stay in the area, since the creature never had a chance to leave the area. The chain was only a few hundred meters long!
