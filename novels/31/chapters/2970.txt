Chapter 2971: The People in the Court Are Shocked

Each person had to accept responsibility!

The list that Ozawa handed over was this one!

The Twin Guardian Towers gradually approached the cliff’s edge due to their carelessness, insensitivity, ignorance, and neglect, making it possible for it to fall at any time.

Since the inmates might escape from their cells and infiltrate society, the people of this generation might also end up as the sinners of the Twin Guardian Towers.

“Ozawa, you’re insane,” said the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo. He was so angry that he breathed roughly.

“I would like to apologize to the ancestors of the Sacrificial Mountain first,” said Ozawa. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A razor-sharp knife suddenly materialized in his hand as soon as he finished speaking.

The guards next to Ozawa were shocked. They thought Ozawa would attack them, but he stabbed himself.

The blood ran down from the blade to the handle. Ozawa’s hands were stained red.

“Ozawa!” Mo Fan yelled as he ran to stop him.

Ozawa extended a hand and stopped Mo Fan.

He was in pain, but he looked determined.

“Don’t worry. I won’t kill myself. It is indeed easy to apologize by committing suicide, but that is what those who want to destroy the Twin Guardian Towers want. I won’t let them take away the Twin Guardian Towers like this.” Ozawa neither stabbed himself further nor drew the dagger out.

He was still bleeding, but it wasn’t enough to kill him.

“You don’t have to do this. You’re not the only one to blame.” Mo Fan looked at Ozawa. He was moved.

Seeing the blood gushing out of Ozawa’s body, Mo Fan could feel his sincere affection for the Twin Guardian Towers and his uncontaminated passion! His action was not meaningless.

He was trying to wake everyone up from their daze. The Blood Demons did not have total control over the Twin Guardian Towers, but the evil thoughts had occupied everyone’s mind. Everyone had forgotten how their forefathers fought those savage monsters, how they erected a splendid castle atop the cliff, and how many of their predecessors perished in the process.

“You’re insane, Ozawa. You’re really insane. Until someone like you spread unfounded rumors that caused people to worry, the Twin Guardian Towers have always been in order. What you must do is to take care of yourself and those who spread panic instead of accusing everyone in the Twin Guardian Towers!” the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo, said angrily.

“Chief, there is something I have always wanted to report. The previous regulations required us to regularly confirm the identities of the inmates housed in the East Guardian Towers in order to stop those who are adept at unusual magic from using these techniques to escape. It appears that this rule has been abolished at some point, and someone like me, who is in charge of prisoner verification, has just become a decoration in the police department,” a guard in the Guard Regiment said.

The guard seemed to have kept these words in his heart for a long time. When he finally could mention it, he looked at Ozawa.

A look of relief flashed through Ozawa’s face. It seemed that there were still people who could think rationally.

“Three months ago, as I used the energy ball to remove the last of the negative energy from the cell, I noticed a prisoner who had no skin. He was covered in blood as if he had torn off his own skin. I reported this to the Regiment Commander a long time ago, but the Regiment Commander never got back to me,” said another middle-aged guard. He deliberately lowered his hat so that his face was hidden.

“I saw it too! But not in the East Guardian Towers. I saw it in the dean’s room,” a female student whispered.

“Ah, I thought I was dreaming. It turns out everyone has seen it!”

“Could it be that the horror stories that have been going around the academy lately are real?”

“Oh my god! I wasn’t wrong about what I saw then!”

All of a sudden, everyone was talking about what they had witnessed. They had seen the Blood Demons in their lives but had not dared to believe it to be true.

“That is the Blood Demon. It is an evil creature that can imitate the appearance of others,” said Lingling.

“Blood Demons!”

“Yes, I have some information about the Blood Demon here. Mo Fan and I killed a Blood Demon recently, too. It impersonated Mo Fan,” said Lingling.

Lingling already knew everything there was to know about Blood Demons, including strong proof that they could change into others.

The Chief of the Towers Shigekyo, Tegami Fujikata, and Katana Mochizuki all made somber faces. They did not want to discuss this issue. However, Ozawa’s actions led to discussions among the members of the Twin Guardian Towers, and more people expressed their doubts.

“Let’s take a look. I’m also curious about it. Such an evil creature actually exists in this world?” said General Takuichi.

“This…” Katana Mochizuki seemed reluctant.

“Katana, you’re the most senior chief. I think you don’t want the rumor to spread because it would cause panic in the Twin Guardian Towers. Now let’s examine the Blood Demons. Everyone is interested in learning more about it as well,” General Takuichi insisted.

Many people were doubtful. The Blood Demons had replaced so many people that they would have made a slip while acting as the person they impersonated. Some people might have even seen their true appearances.

Katana Mochizuki found that the people in the court were conversing about it. He knew that if he expressed a different opinion, it might raise suspicions.

The Blood Demons did not get along well with one another. If the exposed Blood Demons were caught, Katana Mochizuki had no way to protect them.

All of the information regarding the Blood Demons came on the screen right away when Lingling submitted it, allowing everyone in the court to see it.

It was a short video that recorded the “Blood Demon Mo Fan” trapped in the trapped magic formation. Slowly, his bloody appearance was revealed.

“This is it!”

“Oh my god! This is what I saw!”

“Blood Demons do exist!”

The students exclaimed from the crowd. The crowd itself was in an uproar!

It turned out that Blood Demons did exist! They turned into someone’s appearance in the Twin Guardian Towers.

The people in the court were also shocked. Ozawa was relieved to see everyone’s reaction. This was what he had wanted.

No one, not even the unaffected, would believe him if he claimed that the Blood Demons had taken over the Twin Guardian Towers.

A little guidance would allow everyone to draw conclusions based on their past experiences, which was always more convincing.
