Chapter 2692: You Can’t Run After All That Posturing

Zhao Jing’s face turned pale. With his ability and background, he had been so sure that he could certainly defeat the rising power of Fanxue Mountain after enlisting some help from Lin Kang, the Nanrong family elders, the three masters from the Zhao family, and the Mercenary Alliance.

He now had a situation where his men were being slaughtered one after another.

Zhao Jing was upset with himself for underestimating the enemy. He had dismissed the Fanxue Mountain members as a useless bunch. Zhao Jing was even angrier with Mo Fan. Mo Fan was extremely arrogant and unrestrained. How did Mo Fan become so powerful? Zhao Jing had considered only himself to be unbeatable in this realm.

Zhao Jing took a deep breath and stared at Mo Fan who was still in the form of the Flame Demon King. He suppressed his own jealousy. Most of his manpower had been eliminated, he now had only himself to rely on.

Mo Fan was capable of killing all the five elders all by himself. Zhao Jing did not have the confidence to take on Mo Fan.

‘I’ll try to drag him out. I suppose Mo Fan won’t be able to keep his current form for a long time,’ Zhao Jing thought.

Zhao Jing retreated into the forest towards the northwest. The mountain ridge connected to the west ridge, which was considered the White Magic Falcons’ and a few other Mountain Demons’ territories. Fanxue Mountain’s biggest weakness was that it faced northwest, which was at a very close proximity to the Mountain Demon.

Fanxue Mountain had always been wary not only of the Sea Monsters but also of the Mountain Demon in the northwest. Since the winter season had arrived, the supply of food, water, and other basic necessities had been significantly reduced. A large number of demon creatures’ lives were affected. They intended to attack human territory.

Zhao Jing decided to take a detour. He did not want to confront the Flame Demon King at his strongest. Zhao Jing was a Plant Element magician. The situation would be favorable for him if he headed to the north side of the West Ridge where it was densely forested.

“Mo Fan, we can’t let him go!” said Zhao Manyan as he watched Zhao Jing escaping.

“I don’t have the intention of letting him go. I want to slaughter him,” Mo Fan said.

“We must! If he escapes today, he will join forces with Zhao Youqian. They’ll do all they can to bring down Fanxue Mountain. The Zhao family has an abundance of financial resources, and they can even hire magicians from the realm of Forbidden Curse. Without the protection from Chairman Shao Zheng, we can’t fight the unscrupulous magicians from the realm of Forbidden Curse,” Zhao Manyan said despairingly.

Furthermore, the Zhao family’s power extended to an international level. Zhao Jing and Zhao Youqian were the ones who held the most power in that family.

If Zhao Youqian found out that Mo Fan was still alive and hiding in Fanxue Mountain, Zhao Youqian and his men would try to destroy him and Fanxue Mountain. Not even the Mu family would be able to stop them.

Zhao Jing must die today!

Mo Fan understood this. It had only taken Zhao Jing a day’s time to gather so many mage groups in the south to take on Fanxue Mountain. If Zhao Jing returned to the Zhao family and was given sufficient time to mobilize forces from the local and international countries to besiege Fanxue Mountain, Fanxue Mountain and its people would all perish.

Besides, Mo Fan could not spare anyone who had caused such a huge damage to Fanxue Mountain. Zhao Jing’s crematorium was ready for him.

Zhao Jing must have summoned some sort of Transport Magical Equipment. An extremely strong push force formed in the air as Zhao Jing floated at a speed away from the mountain. Each step took him more than a mile away. It would only take a little while for Zhao Jing to disappear behind the mountain.

Without a second thought, Mo Fan summoned his Black Dragon Wings.

Even though Zhao Jing’s Air Fly Sneakers was already considered one of the fastest, nothing matched the speed of Mo Fan’s Black Dragon Wings.

Zhao Jing crossed mountain after mountain with ease before leaping over a pine mountain. Moments before he had been at Fanxue Mountain, but now he was already at the depths of the northwest mountain where the Mountain Demon roamed.

The Air Fly Sneakers was Zhao Jing’s life-saving magical equipment. A villain like him often faced life-threatening situations. Whenever he encountered a powerful enemy, he relied on this Transport Magical Equipment to flee for his life.

‘Mo Fan has yet to catch up with me,’ thought Zhao Jing as he turned his head to glance back the way he had come. Fanxue Mountain and Xuexin City were already far behind, almost blocked from view by the towering mountains.

Zhao Jing felt disappointed in himself. He had no intention of fleeing. He wanted to lure Mo Fan into the thick woods so that he stood a chance of defeating him.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Zhao Jing felt strange gusts of wind blowing above his head. The violent force almost scraped the top of the lush, enormous pine mountain.

Pine leaves flew in the sky. Several vortexes spun in the middle of the mountain. Needle-shaped pine leaves were sucked into these vortexes. The thorny mess then transformed into a dragon and soared up to the sky.

Trees swayed and rocks rolled away. Zhao Jing looked up to see the enormous Black Dragon Wings covering the sky. One could not help but shudder with fear when one saw the sky turn pitch black as the Black Dragon Wings covered it.

For a moment, Zhao Jing feared that an enormous dragon might crush him from above. When the ancient true dragon’s imposing aura came in contact with the mountains and the Earth, they almost crumbled. Zhao Jing gathered his courage.

It was not a Black Dragon; it was Mo Fan. Mo Fan’s Wing Magical Equipment was rare and unique. Not only could Mo Fan trail him and fly above him, but he also had an extremely powerful Dragon Soul Force!

“Life-sucking Light!

“Mad Growth!”

Zhao Jing suppressed his agitation and lifted his hands.

Thousands of giant pines in the mountain were uprooted from the ground. They grew rapidly to hundreds of meters in height. The ordinary pine forest transformed into an ancient elf forest. The Skypine Trees opened up their crowns, forming a sea of green with their branches, trunks, vines, and leaves. They blocked the sun and the sky from sight.

It was like a miniature version of Feathered Demon Heaven. Zhao Jing was regarded as an outstanding magician for being able to create such a magnificent world using his Plant Element magic power.

The giant trees with their divine veins prevented Mo Fan’s Black Dragon Wings from fluttering, thus, bringing down Mo Fan’s aura successfully. There was an enormous trap laid out below Mo Fan. If he flew down there, he would be devoured by the terrifying Giant Wood World!

Mo Fan was surprised to find that Zhao Jing still had many powerful and mysterious spells at his disposal. Mo Fan reminded himself not to take him lightly. After all, Zhao Jing was an expert who had fully mastered the four elements. Even Pang Lai, the Royal magician, could not defeat Zhao Jing easily.
