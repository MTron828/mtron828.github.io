“I’m sorry, I’m sorry...I didn’t mean it...” Ai Tutu was like a hurt little stray cat, no longer showing her usual playfulness as she apologized to Mo Fan with red eyes.

She would not apologize to Gu Jian. She had never treated someone like him seriously, but it was not the same for Mo Fan. He was her friend!

Glancing at the hurt Ai Tutu, Mo Fan patted on her head. He had no intention of blaming her.

They had known each other for quite some time. Mo Fan was extremely familiar with Ai Tutu’s personality, thus even when she foolishly impersonated him in the battles, he would simply feel speechless and would only give her a fair warning...

But she was a woman, after all. Even if she had done something wrong, she did not deserve to be scolded in front of the crowd like Gu Jian had!

Mo Fan would never do that to Ai Tutu, even if the girl had screwed up all three of the matches. He would never use foul language on her. Him being close to Ai Tutu was only part of the reason, but most importantly, a man should never behave like scum to a woman!

“Don’t cry, it’s ok,” Mo Fan sighed.

“You...you don’t blame me?” Ai Tutu raised her head. Her red eyes stared at Mo Fan in disbelief.

“You did cross the line this time, but it’s not the end of the world... besides, did you forget, I’m already a provisional candidate. There’s a chance I wouldn’t even be here for the Nomination Preliminaries if you hadn’t suggested it,” Mo Fan smiled.

Ai Tutu glanced at the man. At such a close distance, she suddenly discovered that the Demon King was as warm as the sun when he was smiling, very handsome, shining warmth into her heart...

“But, I still have to apologize to you. Sorry, I’ll try to make up for it,” Ai Tutu said firmly.

“Alright, I accept that, but...” Mo Fan turned his head slightly, locking his gaze onto Gu Jian who was still cursing at his teammates, “But, I’ll even the score first, and we’ll talk about how you’ll make up for it.”

Mo Fan let go of the stray cat Ai Tutu and had her sit down to take a rest.

Ding Yumian sat in her seat quietly. She handed Ai Tutu a bottle of water, having her calm down first. She then switched her focus back to Mo Fan, who was walking toward Gu Jian.

She was curious to see what Mo Fan had in mind. She was a Psychic Magician, hence she was able to sense the anger in Mo Fan’s calm black eyes, hidden under his indifferent expression.

“You’re Gu Jian?” Mo Fan walked up to Gu Jian and asked calmly.

“What do you want? Are you here for that woman?” Gu Jian was not blind. He clearly saw Ai Tutu falling into the man’s arms, but his eyes were full of disdain.

It was most likely that the girl had used her body to climb into the top twenty. It was reasonable some man would step forward to protect her.

“Nothing much, I just want to tell you that if you start crawling to her from where I am, and give yourself three loud slaps to the face and apologize to her, I’ll forgive what you’ve said to her! On top of that, I would like to say, go f**k yourself!” Mo Fan stood in front of Gu Jian. He purposely emphasized the last few words, enough for the entire crowd to hear it clearly!

Gu Jian’s face fell dark immediately.

He was still overwhelmed by anger. He pointed at Mo Fan and snapped, “Who the f**k do you think you are? You better piss off as far as you can before I have the urge to cripple someone!”

“It’s clear that you can’t win the battle yourself, yet you still blamed it on a girl... the difference between you and a dog is, at least a dog is born through regular intercourse, yet a cross breed like you... must be something your mum farted out after she turned pregnant from eating some shit!” replied Mo Fan.

The cursing popped the eyes of Ding Yumian and Ai Tutu wide open.

First, they could not understand the logic of the statement. Second, they were astonished by Mo Fan’s skill at cursing.

Everyone at the scene was a Magician, a student of an Institute that was a pillar of the nation, yet the man said something so wild, unpleasant, and illogical when cursing someone... but why did it feel rather pleasant to their ears?

The whole place fell quiet all of a sudden, the filthy words still echoing in their ears. Some of the girls were utterly confused by what he had said, and turned to the wicked boys nearby to get an explanation.

“You...you...” Gu Jian had used up all the foul language in his vocabulary. He was at a loss for words to return the favor. He could feel blood rising in his throat from the grudge in his chest.

Mo Fan was raised by common people. A person like Gu Jian was no match for him.

“Getting cocky when you only know how to scold someone, come face me in a duel instead. I’ll make you regret insulting me today!” swore Gu Jian, his finger pointing at Mo Fan as he finally collected his thoughts.

“You do know that scolding a person isn’t something to be proud of, but weren’t you the one feeling good when you were scolding my friend Ai Tutu?” said Mo Fan with a smirk.

Gu Jian felt like he had simply dropped the rock he was carrying onto his feet. His expression fell dark when he saw the crowd laughing at him.

However, he would never admit his wrong, “Was I wrong? It’s true that her strength isn’t worthy to take part in the Nomination Preliminaries. Why can’t I scold a let-down like her?”

“You lost because you’re bad, you never stood a chance against them!” said Mo Fan.

“Hehe, so you think you’re good? I’ll make this clear, if it weren’t the rules that prohibit the students to duel against one another outside of the assigned matches during the Nomination Preliminaries, I would have smashed you into a coma by now. You should be glad that the rules have protected you this time, since I don’t want to destroy my future because of a trash like you! There’s no way we could win as long as that stupid woman is on our team!” said Gu Jian.

Mo Fan was aware how much of a scum this Gu Jian was, yet the referees were still watching them. They would simply interfere and stop the fight if he tried to beat this scum up, and it was obvious that Gu Jian would simply stay close to the referees.

He uttered a hollow laugh and said to Gu Jian, “You’ve said it yourself, dare to make a bet with me?”

“I don’t mind saying it again, everyone here can testify it, this woman is the reason we lost... what’s the bet for?” Gu Jian was obviously trying to protect his image.

“I’ll fight the third battle in your place with the same teammates, those two guys and her... if I win, you’ll f**king do what I say, crawl to where she is, slap yourself three times in the face and apologize to her!” Mo Fan was extremely disgusted by the scum.

What an asshole! If the referees weren’t around, he would have beaten the crap out of the guy.

Gu Jian was stunned...

Gu Jian glanced at his surroundings and saw that everyone was looking at him. He could not decline the man’s dare, as he would simply be denying his own words.

“Alright, but if you lose... oh, I remember that there’s a lawn in front of my apartment. Lots of annoying people would walk their dogs there, so there are dog poops everywhere. You can split them with that stupid woman and eat them all,” snapped Gu Jian.

“Gu Jian, your condition is even more unreasonable.” His teammate Li Jie could not stand him any further.

Gu Jian glared back at him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mo Fan did not care, since he would simply accept any condition given to him... A few months ago, Mo Fan would not have acted so recklessly, but he was feeling very confident now that the Flame Belle had reached her Youth Stage!

“Very well... referees, please help to testify to this bet, too,” Mo Fan turned around and said to the referees.

The three referees were actually some young teachers of the Institute. Although they were pretending to feel helpless when the students were quarreling, they were actually looking forward to it in their hearts... damn, it was much more exciting to be the referee for fights like this!

Speaking of which, this student who came in after the fight... He was a real man!

That being said, they could not simply ignore the rules. One of the referees spoke up, “It’s something personal between you, and fine as long as you both accept it, but we won’t be giving you high points for your performance. We’ll still follow the standard when judging your opponents. If you’re fine with that, we won’t mind.”

“That’s fine by me, since we won’t be able to fight the third match even without this mess,” said Li Jie.

Liu Xing nodded too, implying that he would rather fight the last battle with the wild man on his team than forfeiting it. Besides, for some reason, the fellow looked rather familiar to him...

Editor’s Note : They rolled a Natural 1 on the perception check when he said ‘Ai Tutu’, and didn’t realize she was a fake, yes... And why the refs would let someone not on the team sub in for a nomination match... ah, whatever.
