Mo Fan laid on the white bed. He sat upright suddenly, too bored to just lay there.

On his right was a floating vase, trembling as if it would fall to the ground at any second. In front of him was a remote control for the television. No one was using it, yet the channels kept switching rapidly. On his left was a pen scribbling on a piece of paper...

(Knock knock)

Someone was knocking on his door. Mo Fan immediately stopped using Telekinesis. The vase dropped to the ground and smashed into pieces. The remote control fell on the table, and the pen fell on the paper. Everything returned to normal.

Lin Junxian, dressed in another fine suit, came in with a woman around twenty-seven years old. They smiled when they saw Mo Fan was awake.

“This is my cousin, Lin Qi,” introduced Lin Junxian.

“Thank you so much, I wouldn’t know what I would do if I lost Xiao Di. Please let us know if we can help you in any way. Our Lin Clan is also a renowned clan; we are extremely grateful, we must repay your great kindness!” Lin Qi said to Mo Fan sincerely.

“Well...” Mo Fan was just about to mention a little favor. The truth was, he already knew the Lin Family was comparable to the Zhao Family in terms of financial capabilities.

“It’s fine, take your time, the Lin Family owes you a favor. We’ll do anything to repay your kindness!” said Lin Junxian.

“Sure, we’ll discuss it in the future. Those goddamned advisors have purposely frozen our bank accounts. I bet they are going to take away whatever you give me now, too,” sighed Mo Fan.

“HAHA, we know that, so I’ve already made the preparations. I’ve found you a ship that will bring you safely to Japan. However, you and your team must be cautious, don’t stir up any unnecessary trouble. It will be troublesome for people without an identity like you,” said Lin Junxian grinned.

“Kind sir, please rest well. Let us know if you need any help,” Lin Qi reminded him again.

“Don’t worry, I’m not your typical unsung hero. I’ll surely ask for your help,” said Mo Fan.

Lin Qi and Lin Junxian were amused by Mo Fan’s honesty. They felt more at ease after hearing his words.

Mo Fan asked about the missing cases after he left the hospital, but Jiang Yu only repeated what Zhao Manyan had mentioned. They had only found the culprit in Feiniao City before the trail was lost.

The rest was totally out of their reach. Since the advisors were aware of it, the Magic Association would definitely take full responsibility for investigating it.

Lin Junxian was a reliable businessman. After the truth about the missing infants was revealed, he immediately set up a fund to support the families who were victims on behalf of the Lin Group. He immediately received the support of the residents in Feiniao City.

The hidden threat of Feiniao City was cleared. The city would soon recover with Lin Junxian’s contributions!

——-

After Mo Fan fully recovered, the group boarded the ship and departed for the Pacific Ocean...

Feiniao City did not have any heavy industries, so the sky and sea were exceedingly blue. As they slowly left the safe zone, everyone immediately felt better after enjoying the scenic view of the connected sky and sea.

The girls on the team were all beauties. Jiang Shaoxu was wearing a sexy bikini, as usual.

The two assholes, Zhao Manyan and Mo Fan, never concealed their perverted gazes. They almost buried their eyes inside Jiang Shaoxu’s deep cleavage. The two hills of jade-white skin were too alluring.

“Humph!” Gong Yu harrumphed when he saw the two shameless pricks with their shameless actions, as if he was self-contained.

“The asshole is putting on an act again!” Zhao Manyan had completely fallen out with Gong Yu. He did not even give him a friendly look.

“Time to play with him,” Mo Fan grinned. “Yo, Gong Yu, I believe you haven’t kept your promise after losing the bet last time.”

“Since when did I lose?!” said Gong Yu furiously.

“I had four gall bladders, you had three; wasn’t it obvious that you’ve lost the bet? Just say it if you want to act dumb, I guess a manly bet like that doesn’t suit you at all,” mocked Mo Fan.

Gong Yu’s expression turned unpleasant. He demanded in a sour voice, “Say it, what do you want?!”

Mo Fan was waiting for Gong Yu to say that, and asked Gong Yu to come closer.

Gong Yu had a bad feeling when he saw the vicious look on Mo Fan’s face...

As Gong Yu thought, he shook his head fiercely after he finished listening to Mo Fan.

“Fine, don’t you pretend that you’re superior again in front of me, you have no guts,” said Mo Fan indifferently.

Gong Yu was furious. He clenched his teeth and said, “I’ll surely ask you to do something worse next time!”

“Bring it on, I like the feeling of my heart racing!” boasted Mo Fan.

Zhao Manyan had no idea what Mo Fan asked Gong Yu to do. He asked Mo Fan when he saw Gong Yu heading for the deck.

“Watch closely, the view is only going to last for a moment, don’t miss it!” Mo Fan said to Zhao Manyan mysteriously.

Zhao Manyan was even more confused. He was just about to ask when he heard Jiang Shaoxu’s scream coming from the deck.

Zhao Manyan glanced toward the sound and saw Gong Yu peeling Jiang Shaoxu’s bikini off as he tripped, revealing two large boobs that trembled as if they were experiencing a great scare...

Unfortunately, Zhao Manyan reacted a bit too late. Jiang Shaoxu had already covered the important parts with her hand, yet her tiny hands were nowhere enough to cover all of them. Zhao Manyan’s certain body part was already saluting!

“Splendid!” Zhao Manyan was almost drooling.

Mo Fan had an evil grin. Unlike Zhao Manyan, who only saw Jiang Shaoxu after her scream, he had witnessed the entire sequence. Tsk tsk, the woman’s body was so hot, she didn’t even stack anything underneath...

It was such a pity that Gong Yu was not fully committed to it. He had only peeled the bikini down halfway. Otherwise, they could have enjoyed the view for a bit longer. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Die, you scum!” Jiang Shaoxu’s screeched from the deck.

Gong Yu immediately ran away. Luckily, Jiang Shaoxu’s main element was Psychic. Otherwise, the ship would not be able to withstand her rage.

“I...I didn’t mean it, I slipped, I slipped!”

“Shameless prick, I’m not Jiang Shaoxu if I don’t chop your hands off!”

“I really didn’t do it on purpose... why are you using magic!?”

Gong Yu was chased across the whole ship. No one dared to help him under the circumstances.

Zhao Manyan was almost choking from laughter. He gave Mo Fan a thumbs up. It was such a dirty move, yet he liked it.

Mo Fan laid back on the chair comfortably and hummed pleasantly.

Japan was going to be great... it was the birthplace of countless precious seeds!

{TL Note: I feel like an explanation is needed here. In Chinese, there’s a modern slang of describing ‘sperm’ as seed. Here, it’s referring to how a lot of men ‘produce seeds’ from watching Japanese adult movies.}
