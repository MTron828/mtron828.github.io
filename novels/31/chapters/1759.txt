“Strange, why is my Rock Barrier as fragile as bubbles against the Rock Monster, yet it couldn’t break free from Fan Mo’s spell?” Lin Qihui murmured in confusion.

A Rock Barrier was similar to a huge mound of stone. It was bigger and thicker than the thin and razor-sharp Rock Fangs, so how did the Rock Fangs manage to hold the Rock Monster in place when it could easily break through his Rock Barrier?

“The Rock Fangs must be targeting the Rock Monster’s joints, making it difficult for the creature to gather its strength!” Tao Jing guessed.

Tao Jing was right. Even though Mo Fan’s Rock Fangs were sturdier than ordinary rocks, they were not strong enough to match the strength of an Intermediate Spell. Mo Fan was merely restricting the movement of the Rock Monster via its joints to root it in place!

However, if the Rock Monster gathered its strength to forcibly break one of the Rock Fangs, it would break free from the Queen of the Night’s Binding right away. The Rock Fangs would no longer be able to stop it.

The Rock Monster was not brainless as they had thought. It used its elbow to hit the shaft of a Rock Fang multiple times. The Rock Fang soon cracked, and eventually broke into pieces.

The Rock Monster swung its arm to break the rest of the Rock Fangs after it was able to move its arm freely, and rapidly broke free from the Queen of the Night’s Binding.

After regaining its freedom, the Rock Monster fixed its eyes on Mo Fan, as if it knew who the culprit was. Its eyes looked emotionless, yet one could easily feel the wrath and murderous intent within them!

The Elemental creature was quite hot-tempered. It roared like a gorilla before charging at Mo Fan. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan was standing behind two buildings to protect himself, but the creature simply pounded them to the ground, forcing Mo Fan to retreat to a street further up the mountain.

“Damn it, I could have killed you with a single Lightning Strike!” Mo Fan cursed when he saw the Rock Monster pursuing him relentlessly.

Luckily, Mo Fan’s physical attributes as a Super Mage were outstanding. He managed to dodge a few punches from the Rock Monster agilely.

“Fan Mo, hang in there, we’ll go find backup!” Lin Qihui yelled at Mo Fan from not far away.

Mo Fan almost had the urge to fire the Earth Spell he had just completed at Lin Qihui. That f**king potato, the Rock Monster would kill him multiple times before he returned with the others who were still at the inn!

The Rock Monster was a lot trickier to deal with than he had thought, especially when they did not have the advantage in numbers to suppress it. The Rock Monsters kept chasing him between the buildings on the street, so he did not have the chance to cast any spells, making him quite frustrated!

“That guy is so impressive. He’s still alive after a Rock Monster has been chasing him for so long,” a Mage hiding in a corner murmured.

“Yeah, keep it up!”

Mo Fan did not see anyone trying to lend him a hand while he was being chased. Everyone was hiding as far as they could instead.

Wasn’t this city supposed to be full of Mages? Why did Mo Fan feel like he was in a street full of normal people? Not a single Mage bothered to help him. Since when did people become so cold-hearted toward one another?

As a matter of fact, it was not like the Mages were unwilling to help, but they were too scared to step forward after witnessing the Rock Monster’s strength!

Basic Mages were simply courting death trying to fight a Rock Monster. Intermediate Mages did not really stand a chance either, especially since everyone could only use their Earth Element in the city. An Intermediate Mage’s control of the Earth Element was inferior to the Rock Monster, so their lives were also in danger too if they tried to fight it. Since the young man was able to kite the Rock Monster with just his agility, no one wanted to risk their lives.

“I’ll help you, run to me...” Tao Jing called out when she saw Mo Fan was in a pinch.

“Don’t worry, that thing can’t harm me, just take care of yourself,” Mo Fan shouted back.

The Rock Monster would never touch him even if the chase went on for another hundred years.

Tao Jing thought Mo Fan was forcing himself. She began casting her Intermediate Spell while enduring the pain from her wounds!

Tao Jing’s Intermediate Spell could be used as an attack. It was a heavy rock cauldron that was able to slide across the ground. The longer it slid, the greater its force. Unfortunately, the Rock Monster was not stupid. It would not just stand still and let Tao Jing attack it.

“Increase your power to the maximum; I’ll make sure it collides with your rock cauldron!” Mo Fan yelled at Tao Jing when he realized her spell could actually threaten the Rock Monster.

Tao Jing nodded. She purposely Summoned a bigger rock cauldron.

The rock cauldron slid along the spacious street. Its speed increased gradually from the push of an Earth Wave. Meanwhile, Mo Fan purposely slowed down to trick the Rock Monster into thinking that it was catching up to him. He then used a huge warehouse to block the Rock Monster’s view.

The Rock Monster lunged at Mo Fan. He stood there the junction without trying to dodge the attack.

Smash! The rock cauldron rammed into the Rock Monster’s lower half just as its hand had almost reached Mo Fan.

The huge creature was knocked flying. Its body cracked in many places.

“Rock Fangs!”

Mo Fan reacted quickly. He swung his hand at the spot where the Rock Monster was going to land.

A thicker and sharper golden-brown Rock Fang popped out from the ground and stabbed the Rock Monster in the crack on its waist the rock cauldron had inflicted, impaling the Rock Monster!

The Rock Monster was severely injured. Pieces of its body scattered across the ground. It staggered to its feet, strong anger rising inside it!

“Eyes of the Rock Demon: Mountain Drill Spinning Top!”

Tiny sand particles drifted in the wind and spun rapidly under the drive of a special energy. They gradually formed a spinning top.

The Mountain Drill Spinning Top struck the Rock Monster in the chest. Its body started turning into fine dust, similar to the sand. The tip of the spinning top was sharp, while its back was thick and broad. The spinning drill continued to dig a bigger hole in the Rock Monster’s huge body, which soon began to collapse!

“It’s an Advanced Spell!”

“Thank the Heavens, an Advanced Mage has finally shown up. Fan Mo, we are safe now!” Lin Qihui blurted out excitedly.

Mo Fan was smiling too, yet he was cursing under his breath, “Safe my ass, help always arrives when the fight is close to an end!”

Mo Fan glanced to the other side of the street and noticed an imperious Battlemaga standing there. Her brown eyes were full of magic, and rather attractive. She was the one who had cast the powerful Advanced Spell, Mountain Drill Spinning Top!
