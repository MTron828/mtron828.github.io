Chapter 240 - Reconstructing a Cursed Beast!

Yu Ang couldn’t endure having Mo Fan breathe more oxygen. He began to chant a strange spell.

The spell was like visible grey music notes. They were floating around Yu Ang as they turned into a grey ribbon.

The ribbons were intertwining, turning into a door covered in magic engravings. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The grey door slowly opened, and a deep green light shot out, directly locking onto Mo Fan inside the large Iron Cage.

Mo Fan could see that those eyes were filled with hatred. When the creature finally walked out of the grey door, Mo Fan was finally able to see what it was.

Its entire body was dark grey. The wrinkled skin was branded over and over again by a strangely shaped iron. It was criss-crossed, and looked like small centipedes were crawling all over its body.

In terms of physique, it didn’t seem to be much different from a Dark Beast. At same time, it was also very different from a Dark Beast. When Mo Fan looked at it carefully, he felt that the smell this creature emitted was very similar to the one emitted by Xu Zhaoting!

It was a cursed and disgusting smell! This Dark Beast’s power was most likely going to be far higher than a normal one!

“This is a Cursed Beast. When we throw people into the pond to bathe, we need to first conduct an extremely resentment-inducing torment on them. The stronger the resentment, the higher the probability of them turning into a Cursed Beast… This was my very first Cursed Beast. Xu Zhaoting was my second, and you, you will turn into my third Cursed Beast!” Yu Ang pointed at Mo Fan with a manic smile on his face.

Yu Ang knew that Mo Fan possessed an Innate Dual Element. Normally speaking, if you were to throw a powerful Magician into the pond to refine them, the chances of them becoming a Cursed Beast would be even higher, especially someone who had an Innate Dual Element!

Mo Fan looked at the Cursed Beast and couldn’t help but crease his brow.

If he was to judge from its aura, then this creature had definitely achieved the Warrior level. He never imagined that Yu Ang would’ve also progressed so far in the past two years. He had changed from just a little figure that controlled Dark Beasts into a Priest that possessed a Cursed Beast!

Right now, Mo Fan was pretty clear on the social rankings of the Black Vatican.

The very lowest class was called the Disciples. Most of them were concealed as normal people, they used the ability to control the Dark Beasts granted to them by the Black Vatican to pursue their own interests.

The higher level ones were called Priests. Yu Ang was precisely a Grey-cloaked Priest. Beneath him was a group of Disciples who were willing to die for him.

Even further up in the rankings were the Deacons.

The name Xu Zhaoting had gotten was precisely the one of a Blue-cloaked Deacon of the Black Vatican.

Yu Ang, as a Grey Priest, naturally held the ability to control the even stronger Cursed Beasts.

Unfortunately, when Xu Zhaoting was turned into a Cursed Beast, he still had a bit of intellect. It was enough for him to escape. Furthermore, Yu Ang also knew that Xu Zhaoting was going to be hard to control, and basically gave up bothering to.

This summoned Cursed Beast, however, was now was extremely loyal. This was because it had been Yu Ang’s slave for more than ten years!

“Do you know who this is?” Yu Ang pointed at the Cursed Beast next to him as his appearance carried a sinister air.

“I’m not interested.” Mo Fan stood inside the large iron cage. He was trying to stall for time with Yu Ang while trying to find a way out of the Iron Cage.

Yu Ang no longer said anything else and ordered the Cursed Beast to approach the Iron Cage.

In this world, perhaps no one actually knew that this Cursed Beast was actually Yu Ang’s biological father.

When he was seven, he was accidentally turned into a member nourished by the Black Vatican. The first thing Yu Ang did was turn the father that abused him into a Dark Beast.

Not long afterwards, Yu Ang entered the Mu Family. He was in the Mu Family for over ten years, and he never once exposed his identity. Furthermore, he used their resources to slowly refine this Dark Beast.

As expected, his most intimate person had shown the biggest improvement. It revealed its talent first among his many slaves, and turned into a Cursed Beast.

It was also because of this Cursed Beast that Yu Ang had been promoted to a Priest, one under the direct command of a Blue Deacon.

If he was able to successfully complete this mission, then he would obtain the favor of Cardinal Salan. Being able to become a Blue Deacon straight from this wouldn’t be a problem at all!

However, those who had offended him would definitely have a bad time. He was already capable of turning his own father into this creature when he was seven, so let’s not mention what he would do to Mo Fan, who ruined his ten year plan and half of his face!

He had to make Mo Fan suffer so much pain that he’d rather die!

“Go, rip his skin off first!” Yu Ang fiercely commanded the Cursed Beast as the whip in his hands ruthlessly lashed toward it.

The Cursed Beast seemed extremely scared of Yu Ang. It turned all of its grievance and pain toward Mo Fan, who was stuck in the middle of the Iron Cage.

A Cursed aura, like a poison gas that could choke someone, immediately wafted over from the outside of the Iron Cage.

Mo Fan was standing at the very edge of the Iron Cage. After seeing the thing coming closer and closer, he couldn’t help but take a step back.

This thing’s physique is not that different from a human’s. There’s no way it would be able to make its way in, right?

Just when Mo Fan’s heart carried some hope, Mo Fan realized that the Cursed Beast was equipped with the ability to change the location of its bones. Its deformed body had shifted into an inconceivable angle. First its head came in, followed by its cartilage bones and then its ugly body.

The process of the Cursed Beast entering the Iron Cage was extremely horrifying. If it was someone who had not seen things, they’d definitely faint!

When Yu Ang saw that Mo Fan’s already displayed dread, his face displayed a wide smile.

He was going to slowly enjoy this marvelous process. The best thing would be that after the Great Formation of Nyx Regime was removed, people would see Mo Fan’s skin left behind in the Iron Cage!

“Yu Ang, retreat! Now!” Suddenly, a voice in Yu Ang’s ears ordered.

Yu Ang touched the earphone in his ear and hastily replied in a very respectful voice, “The thing is almost in my hands! Sir Deacon, why are we in such a hurry?”

“I have a bad feeling.”

“But, Sir Deacon, the kid who has the Underground Holy Spring has been trapped by me within the Iron Cage. I will take it very soon, please give me a bit more time.” Yu Ang said hastily.

Yu Ang had spent a lot of effort to get Mo Fan into the Iron Cage. If he had to leave just like that… how could Yu Ang be willing?

“Really?” The Deacon was clearly hesitant.

If they were to return empty-handed, they would definitely get punished by Salan.

But if they didn’t evacuate now, then he felt like the people of the Magic Court would be closing in. The Blue Deacon was wavering a little.

“Sir Deacon, I will be able to take the Underground Holy Spring very soon, and then I will give it to you immediately,” Yu Ang didn’t want to let go of this opportunity.

“Then… then I’ll wait for a bit…” Blue Deacon replied reluctantly.

For the Underground Holy Spring, he was willing to take on the risk!
