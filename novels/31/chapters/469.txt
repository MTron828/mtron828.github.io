Chen Yi was an expert with a fairly high rank at Imperial College. She was clearly aware of how troublesome it was to deal with these ‘well-trained’ White Sand Giants, even if she had a Swift Star Wolf on her side, too.

The Warrior-level Swift Star Wolf belonged to Mo Fan, yet even without his Summoned beast’s help, he had completely wiped out the White Sand Giants in his area. It was unbelievable!

“Mo Fan, head over to Zhao Manyan after you’re done with your side. I think he’s going to need some help very soon,” ordered Lingling, who was still positioned right at the center of the formation.

Mo Fan nodded. He knew that now was not the time to fool around. He quickly eliminated the remaining White Sand Giants and cast Fleeing Shadow to move toward Zhao Manyan as fast as he could.

“Wait, Brother Mo Fan,” called Xinxia as Mo Fan was passing by the girls.

Mo Fan came to a stop. He glanced at Xinxia with a confused look as his body slowly rose from the shadow.

Before Mo Fan could ask, a milky white butterfly spirit with a unique glow floated toward him. The butterfly spirit seemed to be able to smell the blood from his wounds, and it stopped for a while on Mo Fan’s shoulder before flying to his back.

Mo Fan’s back was covered with several wounds from the impact of the spitting sands. His other body parts were also injured without him realizing it. The special healing spirit quickly cleansed the wounds of some filthy residues, and boosted their recovery speed.

The healing was done fairly quickly, as if the spirit had only flapped its wings and healed the wounds with a very brief touch.

However, during the healing process, the light green glow of the spirit turned dimmer gradually. It was not as bright as it first was.

“This Healing Spirit will be following you around. It will mend your wounds as soon as you’re injured, but every time it does that, its glow will become dimmer. The magic will end when it loses its glimmer completely,” explained Xinxia with a blossom of a smile, stirring a ripple in Mo Fan’s heart.

Mo Fan glanced at the Healing Spirit on his shoulder.

No wonder everyone treated a Healer like Sister Guanyin. The Intermediate Healing Spell was too incredible, able to follow a Magician around throughout a battle, treating any wounds that were left carelessly.

{TL Note: Guanyin here refers to the very popular Buddhist bodhisattva/goddess associated with compassion.}

Treating even light wounds was critical at times, as the pain they brought would more or less affect a Magician’s fighting capacity. Not only would it add extra burden to one’s mental state, it would also affect the rate of drawing Star Patterns, which could possibly lead to a serious mistake if the pain ended up interrupting the channeling.

With the Healing Spirit, the battle he had just fought would not affect his performance. He could still continue to fight in his best condition, and as long as the Healing Spirit was following him around, he could maintain his condition, even if he received more damage.

“Zhao Manyan, I’m coming to save you!” yelled Mo Fan as he completely recovered.

He rushed toward Zhao Manyan with a heroic spirit, yet when he saw more than a hundred White Sand Giants surrounding the man, he completely lost his spirit!

“Damn, did you break into the White Sand Giants’ nest? Why didn’t you tell us there were so many of them here?” Mo Fan used the communication device to talk to Zhao Manyan, who was surrounded by layers of White Sand Giants.

Zhao Manyan’s defense was shockingly solid, almost comparable to an entire team’s defense. If the defenses of the group of Hunters that previously stumbled into the Drifting Sand River by accident had Zhao Manyan’s thousand-year-old turtle protection, they would not have died such horrid deaths.

“Enough with your f**king sarcasm, if you don’t get me out of here in at most three minutes, I’ll annoy the f**k out of you all when I turn into a ghost!” The communication device was transmitting lots of noise, but they could still hear Zhao Manyan’s resentful scream.

“Honestly, I really want to save you, but the problem is, how do I even make my way through those thick walls of White Sand Giants? Why didn’t you buy a Wing Magical Equipment as a safety precaution when your family is so rich? You’re so afraid of death, you should have spent the money instead!” Mo Fan said helplessly.

Even if he tried to blow the White Sand Giants’ formation up like a magic cannon, he would not be able to blast a big enough hole to get Zhao Manyan out of their envelopment.

“Should I help him?” Xinxia’s worried voice came through the communication device.

The only way to get Zhao Manyan out of the pinch was through Xinxia’s Pacify.

“Brother Fan, I’m here to help!” Zhang Xiaohou’s voice interjected.

The voice did not come from the communication device. As Mo Fan turned around, Zhang Xiaohou was already not far away from him.

Mo Fan immediately wore a smile when he saw Zhang Xiaohou. Just in time!

However, his smile quickly disappeared as soon as the thought crossed his mind.

Zhang Xiaohou was indeed here, but he was also bringing a group of White Sand Giants with him! Mo Fan was already having a headache from the current situation, yet the guy had to make the situation worse by bringing more White Sand Giants to him. Mo Fan only refrained from cursing on the spot because he was familiar with Zhang Xiaohou’s parents! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

On the other hand, if Zhao Manyan knew about the situation, he would surely have the urge to kill Zhang Xiaohou. How could he further entrap his teammate like that!

Mo Fan glanced at the White Sand Giants pursuing Zhang Xiaohou in the clouds of sand. Left with no choice, Mo Fan decided to ask Xinxia to cast her Psychic Spell. Otherwise, Zhao Manyan would be a dead man. He would think of some plan to get rid of the White Sand Giants later after saving his life.

“Check this out!” said Zhang Xiaohou in a confident tone, totally oblivious to the fact he was further entrapping his teammates.

He maintained his speed and turned a sharp corner right in front of Mo Fan, leading the group of White Sand Giants right into the walls of White Sand Giants, like adding oil to a fire.

Zhang Xiaohou continued to run at the walls of White Sand Giants. Mo Fan could not help but think when he glanced at the White Sand Giants that still showed no sign of decreasing their speed, -Does that idiot Zhang Xiaohou really think that the following White Sand Giants will simply slam into the walls of the other White Sand Giants? Isn’t he being too naive?!-

However, Mo Fan immediately dropped his jaw when he saw the unbelievable... because that was exactly what happened! The wave of pursuing White Sand Giants slammed into their comrades at full speed!

They clearly saw their comrades, yet none of them bothered stepping on the brakes!
