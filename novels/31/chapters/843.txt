There was a knock on the door. Mu Ningxue quickly rubbed her face dry with the back of her hands.

For some reason, Mu Ningxue thought it was Mo Fan. She was going to speak as soon as the door was opened, but she realized it was Gong Yu and his spotless, clean face.

Guan Yu had a handsome face. His eyes were looking at Mu Ningxue sincerely, as if he was well-prepared with his speech.

Mu Ningxue looked at him silently. Her eyes were already asking Gong Yu the reason for coming to her room.

“What happened? Why did you cry?” Guan Yu panicked when he saw the abnormal behavior from Mu Ningxue’s eyes.

He never thought Mu Ningxue would hide in her room and cry. As a matter of fact, when Mu Ningxue asked to become a defender so she could make her way back to the team, he was utterly impressed by her determination. However, it turned out that Mu Ningxue was not as strong as she seemed. He happened to witness her weak side!

Mu Ningxue’s heart must be in the most fragile state now. Guan Yu felt like he should be doing something.

“We’ll depart for the next destination in a few days. I’ll try my best to convince my gramp before that... I believe they are extremely willing to support a talented Ice Magician like you, but you’ll have to join our family first, to let my gramp know that you’re indeed one of us. That way, they would be willing to support you. It’s just a formality, let your dad meet with the elders in my family and reach an agreement, but the ceremony can wait. After all, we should focus on the World College Tournament for the time being. If we perform well on the national team, there’s nothing you need to worry about,” Guan Yu immediately presented his invitation.

Guan Yu believed Mu Ningxue desperately needed a supporter, considering her current situation. He thought that if he sincerely invited her, he could easily convince her to join his family.

Many people were willing to bet their lives on a chance to join the national team, let alone a little marriage. Guan Yu believed he was not too bad, either. There was no reason why Mu Ningxue would reject him.

Basically, under her circumstances, she would accept his offer as long as she was neutral to him!

As for his family, even though it meant spending twice the resources, they could still afford the expense. Besides, the two of them would earn several times the benefits in return. He should not have any problem if he discussed it with his grandfather!

Mu Ningxue was actually not paying attention to Guan Yu when he was talking. Her mind was still preoccupied with her father’s words. When she collected her thoughts, she saw a hint of joy on Guan Yu’s face.

She was utterly confused.

“I’ll make a call first, I’ll go make a call now, wait for me,” Guan Yu seemed a little excited.

Not answering meant she had tacitly accepted it. Every girl was reserved. She would surely struggle to say something along the lines of, “Fine, I’ll marry you, and you will provide me with resources” out loud.

As such, before Mu Ningxue could react, Guan Yu had already left to make the phone call. The guy’s speed was shocking. Mu Ningxue could not even tell where he went.

—-

The floor below, Guan Yu joyfully took out his phone. He even dialed the wrong number a few times.

“Hello, gramp?”

“Oh, Yu’er? Since when do you know to give your gramp a phone call?” an aged yet energetic voice came from the other end.

“Well, I have something to discuss with you,” said Guan Yu.

“Don’t tell me you failed the breakthrough! Can you please be more reliable, don’t you know how much a Galaxy Vein costs...”

“No, no, I’ve already broken through to the Advanced Level. It’s something else; the Ice Magician that the Mu Clan has invested a lot in training her, Mu Ningxue, do you know her?” Guan Yu cut straight to the topic. The truth was, he was worried that Mu Ningxue would regret her decision. Therefore, he had to convince his grandfather as soon as possible. After all, he was in charge of most decisions for their family.

“I know her, I also know that you’re interested in her,” said the old man calmly. His tone sounded a little strange.

“I know it’s not the best time to talk about her now since I should be focusing on the national team, but I hope you can help me. Let her join our family and become one of us, and we will provide her with resources. That way, both of us will represent the national team. Isn’t that great?” said Guan Yu.

“Oh, and also plan a wedding for you two to bind her with you, so you can focus on the World College Tournament, is that right?”

“Yes, yes, gramp, you know me well!” Guan Yu was enlightened.

“Are you out of your mind, or did your eyeball go into the woman’s belly button? Are you seriously that dumb to suggest that to me? I swear I’d give you two great slaps to the face if you were standing right in front of me!” snapped the old man furiously.

Guan Yu was dumbfounded. He had no idea why his grandfather was so angry.

“Well... I was just thinking for our family,” Guan Yu was discouraged like a flattened balloon.

“Think my ass, why do I have such a dumb grandson like you!?” the old man added.

“Gramp, I know the family only has limited resources to spend, but you don’t need to...” said Guan Yu. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He was aware of the amount of resources needed for a representative of the national team, but with Mu Ningxue’s talents, as long as she could break through to the Advanced Level, it would stop her from being left too far behind from the others.

“You still dare to talk back after I call you dumb? First of all, do you think your teammates are poor peasants? Our family should be burning incense and thanking the gods if we managed to secure you a spot on the national team, and you’re still bringing a woman into the mess?

“Fine, even if it’s as you said, the benefits will multiply if we have two representatives on the national team, but don’t you know what kind of mess that woman is in?! Do you really think a renowned clan like the Mu Clan would kick her out for no reason? The Mu Clan has been running amok for many years. There’s nothing they could not handle, they always got what they wanted, but even they have no choice but to kick the woman out, as they are scared to burn their own finger. And you are thinking of recruiting her to our family? Do you think our family is doing too well lately?

“From today onwards, you’ll stay as far away from her as possible, and if I hear anything between you and her, not only will I beat you up into a cripple, I’ll beat your father too! Just give me a break, the overwhelming hatred from the calamity of the Ancient Capital hasn’t calmed down yet, but you...you are really something; are you trying to make me mad so I’ll die from an excess of anger!?” cursed the old man.

Guan Yu stood still in the spot, as if he had turned to ice.

He knew Mu Ningxue was no longer the genius of the Mu Clan, yet he never thought the influence against her would be so bizarre!
