3073 Black Stone Subsidence Zone

“I almost forgot. You are already a sitting duck.” Michael smiled proudly and looked at Mo Fan, who was trapped in the black formation.

Mo Fan knew that it was useless to struggle. Fortunately, the divine oath was still effective toward Michael. Michael could only use a despicable method like this to take away Mo Fan’s soul energy.

“If this is the case, why bother to turn Holy City upside down and order the Holy Judges to search everywhere?” Mo Fan said.

“My enemy is not only you. The rebellious angel who tried to rescue you just now is also my enemy. I believe that as long as you’re stuck here, someone will fall into the trap,” said Michael.

!!

“So, Shalitha is just your lackey?” Mo Fan asked.

“I gave him some suggestions, and he decided to carry them out. As you can see, I didn’t misjudge you. You will bring turmoil to the world. You have deceived so many people that people are starting to stand against Holy City,” said Michael.

“Actually, you can admit that you’re the biggest cancer in the world. If cancer like you grows in people’s heads, they will be in so much pain that they’ll wish to split open their heads to remove you!” Mo Fan said to Michael.

“Haha, does it matter what I am?” Michael was pinching something and playing with them patiently. The things rubbed each other and made sounds like pebbles.

After a while, Michael opened his hand. He was holding eleven black stones!

As soon as Mo Fan saw these eleven black stones, he knew that Michael had killed the representatives of the top ten organizations. Since all the stones had returned to Michael, he could decide everything. There was no need to consult and judge. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Did it matter what Michael was?

It did not matter.

Not like a historian would be naive enough to point at a ruler and ask whether he was a good or bad person.

It did not matter whether he was cancer or an angel.

If people obeyed him, they would obtain peace. If people disobeyed him, he would start a war!

“I know that the Goddess of Parthenon Temple will do anything for you or even resurrect you, so my execution of you has never changed. These black stones are the key to opening the door of hell. I will let those demons in hell drag your soul in. I’m happy to watch it, and I will let everyone in the world watch it. In two days, your soul will be gone, and your empty body will be nailed to Holy City!”

Michael threw those eleven black stones out, and they fell on Mo Fan’s back. The stones did not move, which was strange.

Blacklight shot out from the inside of the stones. Whenever a dim light was shot out, a large area sank.

It did not sink from top to bottom. The entire area seemed to have been sucked by a mysterious power.

At first, it was just a small engulfing zone. Along the engulfing invagination, the surrounding air flowed through a waterfall like a river and plunged into the depths. Gradually, the space subsidence areas caused by eleven black stones were connected and formed a larger and more terrifying devouring zone!

Mo Fan was hung in the center of the engulfing zone. The golden armor formed by the divine oath still guarded him, so his body was suspended in the black stone engulfing zone.

This divine oath was indeed powerful. The dark purgatory composed of eleven sinful stones could not drag Mo Fan away. However, there was a crack and a gap in the golden armor composed of the divine oath.

This gap was the mark on Mo Fan’s chest and Kazuaki’s soul of the Eight Souls. The giant Hexagram Formation enlarged, tore apart his chest, and took his unbreakable soul away.

The blood gathered into a red line and flew from Mo Fan’s chest to the black stone engulfing zone.

The blue soul energy also turned into a strand, slowly pulled away from Mo Fan’s body, and flew toward the eternal black abyss!

“Enjoy these last two days before you die. I should thank you for providing me with such a perfect ceremony to warn the world. I believe many people will re-examine themselves and think if they have the power to stand opposite Holy City after seeing your end.” Michael said to Mo Fan.

The divine oath was indeed a troublesome thing. It made it impossible for Michael to execute Mo Fan directly.

He needed two days.

Although Michael did not want to give Mo Fan one more second to live in this world, the only way he could kill Mo Fan was through this way.

After completing his masterpiece, Michael flew to the Holy Palace.

He sat on the dome of the Holy Palace and summoned Archangel Ramiel.

Ramiel could not help but look up at the sky. The person hanging in the devouring black abyss in the sky was so eye-catching. He had the protection of the divine oath of Holy City.

“I need to resist the attack of the divine oath, so I won’t make any more moves for the time being. I’ll need you to help me deal with the rebels in Holy City. This time, I hope you will no longer be merciful. They have been bewitched by the demon,” Michael said to Ramiel.

Michael’s face was pale. It was because the divine oath began to attack him.

The divine oath was strong. Since Michael violated it, he would definitely suffer a strong attack.

Fortunately, Michael was confident that he could bear this attack.

“I got it. There are still many irrelevant people in Holy City, can they be allowed to leave?” Ramiel asked.

“Besides members of the top ten organizations, people are allowed to bring them away one by one,” Michael said.

“Why do you have to execute him? It will hurt you instead. If you break the divine oath, many ancient holy laws will also be removed,” Ramiel said.

Ramiel felt that Michael was too persistent in killing Mo Fan.

“I have never misjudged someone. He is a demon!” Michael said confidently.

“If he is a demon, can this method kill him?” Ramiel was a little worried.

Michael closed his eyes and stopped talking. From the painful expression on his face, Ramiel could tell that the attack of divine oath had started.

When he was dealing with Mo Fan, he would also be affected.

The torture he had to endure next would not be much lighter than that of Mo Fan, who was hung above Holy City.

Even so, he would continue until Mo Fan’s soul was drained, and no more soul energy of this guy existed in this world!
