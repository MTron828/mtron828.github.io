Chapter 1864: Won’t See Them Again

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The black cloud slowly drifted into the distance, leaving Honglai Town in a complete mess.

Councilman Nan, Cai Dong, and Chen Wen had been reduced to scattered piles of bones. Tangyue had initially planned to arrest Councilman Nan and bring him to court in the highest Enforcement Union, but the Manta Ray Evil Birds had no such mercy for him.

Perhaps it was a better outcome, since the highest Enforcement Union Court might not give Councilman Nan a heavy sentence due to his connections, and the fact that he was not directly responsible for heavy casualties. He might be able to work his way out of prison in just a few years with the help of his political allies. He could easily make a comeback with a different identity.

It was better to end their lives here. Even though there were still a lot more detestable politicians like Councilman Nan in the world, his death would at least guarantee a period of peace for the town!

The Honglai Mages were hiding further away. They only returned with some lingering fear after the Manta Ray Evil Birds had departed. They had obviously made the right choice to protect themselves, or there would have been more than three corpses lying on the ground. The whole street might be littered with them!

——

Wen Xia soon returned with the people of the Hongling Division. The Hongling general did not feel sorry for Councilman Nan and his men when he saw their remains, being well aware of what kind of a person Councilman Nan was. He had no choice but to obey Councilman Nan’s orders previously because Councilman Nan had bribed his superior, who had directly relayed his orders to the Hongling Division.

The general immediately took over the mine and secured the perimeter to prevent the Manta Ray Evil Birds from returning. He also arranged for his men to begin building emergency shelters at once.

Emergency shelters played an important role, especially in a mining town with a lot of workers and resources. Most mines were located outside of the safe zone. It was common to be invaded by demon creatures, especially in the west of the country. When Mo Fan headed west, many people in the town invaded by the demon locusts had survived only because of the emergency shelters.

The people of Honglai Town were very fortunate that Evil Star had arrived in time and taken the savage Manta Ray Evil Birds away. Otherwise, they could not possibly have imagined the consequences...

Mo Fan sighed after watching the Bird Emperor leading the terrifying storm into the distance.

He had basically given up on the idea of his beloved mount by sending them to the Qinling Mountains. That being said, Mo Fan knew he would struggle to subdue such a ferocious beast of the sea and the sky, as he no longer had any Contracts available.

“Either way, we still managed to sort out everything,” Mu Bai said as he looked around the messy town.

“Yeah, let’s hope we won’t see those terrifying creatures again,” Zhao Manyan agreed.

“Old Zhao, what about your Totem Beast?” Mo Fan asked.

“It had been dead for many years, but it still preserved the majority of its power. I shouldn’t have any problem achieving the Super Level with it. The problem is, which Element should I upgrade to the Super Level first? Light, Water, or Earth?” Zhao Manyan wondered.

All three of Zhao Manyan’s Elements had already reached the bottleneck. He did not really get any insane benefits from following Mo Fan on his adventures, but he had to admit that the foundation of his cultivation was a lot more solid.

It was not like he had a choice. If the foundation was not solid enough, he would have lost his life. The path of a Mage was a never-ending process of surpassing their own limits. The more battles he fought and the more times he was on the brink of death, the easier it was to improve his cultivation.

The truth was, Zhao Manyan would only cultivate in his comfortable president suite in the past. He would cultivate for a few days and have fun for a few days. He never thought he would be following Mo Fan around and not treating his life seriously. He had already memorized how many nails there were on the frame of the Gates of Hell. Most importantly, he had slowly gotten used to it. He would feel uncomfortable if he did not go on an adventure regularly!

Zhao Manyan went into seclusion to attempt his breakthrough to the Super Level after the incident of the Manta Ray Evil Birds.

Tangyue had a huge mess to clean up because of Councilman Nan, including the chief of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, Zhu Qi. The Enforcement Union there had become a complete mess in Zhu Qi’s hands. The Lingyin Enforcement Union had initially planned to isolate them, but the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union actually needed a new person in charge now.

Tangyue felt a little attached to the Nanxi Mountain now. She was most likely going to take over the role of the Chief at the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union.

The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union was quite close to Fanxue City. It would be favorable to Fanxue Mountain if Tangyue took over Nanxi Mountain, since they would then have someone looking after them in the north!

Mo Fan asked little Moon Moth Phoenix to help Evil Star settle down. With nothing much to do, he did not go back to Fanxue Mountain, and went back to the Pearl Institute instead. It was a more suitable place for him to cultivate in peace. He always managed to settle his heart there, and was also planning to try out his new power.

Mu Bai and Jiang Shaoxu went to Fanxue City. Mu Bai might be quite carefree despite being the Chief of the South Wing Platoon, but he still needed to visit it at times. Meanwhile, Jiang Shaoxu was interested in visiting Fanxue Mountain and Fanxue City...

Jiang Shaoxu was shocked when she saw how quickly Fanxue City had developed.

She remembered the city was still in the planning phase not long ago, yet it had already gone from a deserted land to the size of a town. The contrast between it and the Honglai Town managed by Councilman Nan was huge, as if she was comparing a city to a junkyard.

“They finished most of the construction recently, so the city is quite gorgeous after they got done with the cleaning. Everything looks new,” Mu Bai exclaimed. He had been around from the very beginning. Not long ago, there were only construction grounds and muddy fields in the area, but it was now a comfortable district. There were a lot of well-maintained greeneries too, setting off the city’s beauty.

“I thought it would still be a mess here. I didn’t expect it to develop so quickly. It seems like I should consider buying a house here... do you have any discounts for me?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“That won’t be necessary, you’re wasting your money. The South Wing Platoon has provided me with a nice house on South Wing Street. I can give it to you if you like. I normally stay at Fanxue Mountain, so it’s a waste for me to keep the house,” Mu Bai said.

“Is that the street you are referring to?” Jiang Shaoxu pointed at a street with blue bricks.

“Mm, do you want to check it out?” Mu Bai asked her.

“Sure, it’s not a bad idea if it has the view of the bay and the mountains,” Jiang Shaoxu agreed.
