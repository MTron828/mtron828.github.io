3012 Holding A Sharp Blade

“She knows you’re coming. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!” The man with strange irises had been maintaining a humble attitude all this while. At that moment, he burst into laughter suddenly.

Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack!

They heard the crisp sound of high heels on the floor before a slender figure appeared on top of the stairs.

The woman took a step down. Parina took a step back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Red Cardinal continued to walk down the staircase. She stared at Parina indifferently.

Meanwhile, Parina’s face had turned as white as a sheet. She kept retreating. Her legs trembled violently for every step she took backward.

She felt a searing pain on her back all of a sudden. The pain was so unbearable that she could not even stand upright. Parina thought the scar had healed. However, when she faced the perpetrator again, her wound ripped open. Was this a certain kind of Sharp Blade Curse?!

“You never change. Why can’t you use your brain for once? Why must you always take your life so easily, thinking that you can resurrect from the dead again and again? You always think you can do better the next time. But alas…” The Red Cardinal walked into the craft room and stood still.

Parina had backed up against a wall. She leaned on it. It was still hard for her to stand up straight.

“Must I turn you into a small jar so that you can grow?” said the Red Cardinal.

The man’s eyes lit up. If he could use the elegant Parina as his raw material, he believed he could bring out a level of craftsmanship that was beyond human limits!

However, the man’s eyes seemed to have annoyed the Red Cardinal. She glared at him.

He was so frightened that he prostrated on the floor and dared not to look at her or Parina again. He wrapped his hands around his head.

“What exactly do you want?!” Parina summoned her courage to ask.

“Is it that difficult to guess? All I want is revenge. Hasn’t this come across your mind before? I still remember the way you stared at that person. Despite the fact that your heart has sunk, you tried hard to show the same adoration and admiration like the rest,” said the Red Cardinal.

“I’m not going to become as crazy as you!” screamed Parina.

“I’m more sober minded than the rest of you. Since we’re born into this world, we cry when we get hurt, and we take revenge when we are wronged. We will do everything to take back what belongs to us. I’m hurt, so I want to seek revenge and take back what is mine. And you… even though it’s obvious that you’re hurt too, you act like nothing is wrong. Although you’re angry, you continue to pledge your loyalty to your enemy. You have become so numb to losing everything you hold very dear to yourself. Your heart has been distorted, yet you act sickeningly calm. Tell me, are you crazy, or am I?” retorted the Red Cardinal.

The Red Cardinal’s words subverted most people’s views of the world that were in line of logical thinking. The Red Cardinal was a desperado whose views of the world were distorted. Many people who listened to her went astray. Parina could refute her.

“You won’t get away with this. Athens and the Parthenon Temple are not places where you can do whatever you please!” Parina gathered her courage.

“Even your last words are so uninspiring,” said the Red Cardinal indifferently.

…

After walking out of the craft room, the Red Cardinal heard the man’s hysterical laughter.

She paused mid-stride before returning to the underground craft room. After some time, the man’s miserable scream rang throughout the vintage mansion.

Splash!

At the courtyard’s small pool, the Red Cardinal turned on the tap and washed her hands that were covered in blood. She cleaned each of her fingers meticulously.

“How do I handle Parina’s body?” Yan Qiu was dressed in a female servant’s dress. She approached the Red Cardinal, who was washing her hands.

“Send her body back to the Parthenon Temple,” said the Red Cardinal.

“The effect of your medicine will go away soon,” Yan Qiu warned her.

“Have the other Red Cardinals arrived?” asked the Red Cardinal.

“The three new Red Cardinals are your disciples. They won’t dare to act slow,” replied Yan Qiu.

“There were supposed to be four of them. Unfortunately, Blue Bat was—” The Red Cardinal heaved a sigh.

She admired Blue Bat. Blue Bat had a sharp mind and possessed thousands of skills. If she was given some information, she could speculate the entire story. Unfortunately, she was not able to tame Blue Bat entirely.

If Blue Bat could completely forget about her identity as the member of the Enforcement Union, she would be an outstanding successor to the Red Cardinal Salan!

“She is indeed powerful. Not many people can make us suffer a setback.” Yan Qiu nodded.

There were a whole bunch of idiots in this world who thought they were brilliant enough to dig out the key figures of the Black Vatican, and they exhausted much of their energy on the unnecessary people.

Those idiots were the Holy Judges, Enforcement Union, Sacred Hall of New York, and the Holy Altar Mages and others.

But Blue Bat was the only one who encountered the true leader of the Black Vatican. And Blue Bat was the only one who remained steadfast in the middle of the crazy church.

She had caught Salan off guard and thrown the Andeas plan off track. The rebels who were supposed to gain victory had been destroyed by the Federation. The Black Vatican was originally able to expand fivefold, but the Blue Bat’s actions had caused the Black Vatican to suffer severely in the ceremony.

This was especially so for Wu Ku!

Wu Ku was an important figure elected by Salan as the new Red Cardinal. Wu Ku’s intelligence and ability surpassed the incompetent Red Cardinals!

Despite Blue Bat’s betrayal, Salan was never angry with her. Instead, Salan was frustrated with herself that she was not good enough in her own exemplary behaviors and teachings.

Blue Bat was likened to a razor-sharp blade. Salan’s own mistake had caused her to hold the wrong direction of the “blade”. As a result, Salan was hurt by the “blade”. If only she were able to hold the hilt, everything would turn out differently, and she would ruthlessly pierce the invincible forces!

…

Early in the morning, they woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside. Despite the lack of sleep, they were not annoyed at the soft chirps.

Ye Xinxia opened her eyes. She looked outside the sheer gauze curtain and saw the green mountains and forest. The beautiful angles of the mountains were smoothed out by the dense leaves. Several spirit birds with long, fairy tails hovered between the mountains…

“My lady!

“My lady!”

She heard voices outside her bedroom. Ye Xinxia got up. She did not sit on her wheelchair.

She walked to the door. After she opened the door, she saw the people kneel before her. They lowered their face so low that she could not even see their eyes.

Ye Xinxia sensed a bad omen.

“Parina…” Fiona sobbed.

Ye Xinxia’s breathing came out rapidly. She closed the door and leaned behind it. The crowd remained in place and continued kneeling before the door.

After a few minutes, Ye Xinxia opened the door once again. There were tear streaks on her face.

“Is her body intact? Is her soul broken?” asked Ye Xinxia.

“My lady, she can’t be resurrected again.”

“I know. I just want to know if she was in pain when she died.”

“S-She died in peace.”
