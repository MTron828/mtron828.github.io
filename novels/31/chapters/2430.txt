Mu Feiluan was standing close to Mu Ningxue.

He was so angry that he wanted to tear her into pieces on the spot.

However, he could not move at all. The body of the Ice Luan and the royal blood of the Mu Clan flowing through him, the things he was the most proud of, had stiffened in fear. He could not take?even?half a step forward.

It was Mu Feiluan’s first time feeling the threat of imminent death, like his head was under a black guillotine.

There was nowhere he could run to, despite the vast opening!

This was the strongest form of the Ice Crystal Bow.

Many people had tried everything they could to repair the magic Bow. Mu Feiluan had simply shunned their attempts, as he had more faith in his outstanding Innate Talent.

In the end, he was the one being treated with disdain!

The peaks on the mountain were destroyed. The Mu Clan Mountain was a huge mountain. It was a luxurious clanhold, where each peak was considered a historical site, while also serving as a scenic spot. The disciples of the Mu Clan often cultivated in seclusion atop them.

However, the peaks had now disappeared. The red arrow did not touch anything, but nothing in the same plane as its altitude remained intact.

The Soul Slaughtering Arrow only lasted for a brief while, but it felt scarily long to Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng.

It was like the God of Destruction had frozen time. All lives were going to perish, and it would soon be their turn. There was nothing they could do except watch it happen!

—

The disciples of the Mu Clan were crawling on the ground. They shared the same feelings as Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng.

Mu Ningxue did not come here merely to start a bloodbath.

The mountains had collapsed while the buildings were razed to the ground, and even the gardens were destroyed. The people who fell to the ground in fear were physically unharmed, but their hearts were almost shattered by the arrow’s destructive Aura!

Mo Fan stood beside Mu Ningxue with a blank face.

He looked around himself, and saw nothing but destruction!

He had always been proud of his destructive magic. He always called himself the Demon King of Destruction, but when he compared himself to Mu Ningxue’s arrow, he was just a little shrimp stirring up some ripples, while Mu Ningxue was the daughter of the Sea Dragon King who could summon waves and stir up the oceans!

—

Everything calmed down after a long time. A gentle breeze on everyone’s faces brought them back to reality.

Mu Ningxue’s face was extremely pale, whether it was caused by the excessive loss of blood, or because her soul was in a delicate state.

She did not ask Mo Fan to lend her a hand, and walked toward Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng instead.

The Soul Slaughtering Arrow had targeted Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng, instead of the disciples of the Mu Clan!

There was no way they would be unharmed. She was not just trying to scare them!

“If you kill me… you will only find your father’s dead body...”

Mu Feiluan’s head was covered in blood, and he looked quite miserable compared to his previous appearance. He no longer had the strength to stand, so he was crawling away from Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue was a little surprised that he was still alive. He must have had some special protection to survive the arrow.

As for Mu Yinfeng, Mu Ningxue saw she was buried under a pile of mud. She could not have cared less whether Mu Yinfeng was still alive. Even if the Mu Clan tried to save her with magical herbs and pills, she would never recover from her injuries.

“Mu Ningxue, that’s enough!” an aged voice demanded.

Mu Ningxue was already standing in front of Mu Feiluan.

Mu Feiluan somehow found the strength to rise to his feet, and ran toward the old man. “Great Elder, save me!” he screamed.

Mu Ningxue waved her hand. Several chains with sharp tips sprang out of her fingers and stabbed into Mu Feiluan’s limbs.

She pulled the chains that were hooked onto Mu Feiluan’s limbs with great force, dragging him back like a dog.

“Mu Ningxue, if you dare to kill him...” the Great Elder threatened her

Before he could finish, the glowing red bow hovering beside Mu Ningxue flew into her hands.

She raised the Ice Crystal Bow and aimed it at the Great Elder, even though there was no arrow on it.

“One more word, and you will die with him!” Mu Ningxue pulled the string back, her face colder than ice.

The Great Elder froze. His face flushed with anger, but he did not dare say another word.

The Great Elder was sure that Mu Ningxue would kill herself if she fired another Soul Slaughtering Arrow. However, under the circumstances, Mu Ningxue might not hesitate to take the entire Mu Clan Mountain down with her!

The Great Elder was a peak Super Mage, but he still was not confident he could stop Mu Ningxue’s Soul Slaughtering Arrow!

The ancient Bow had once been the Mu Clan’s strongest Weapon, but it was now under Mu Ningxue’s control. It was a great nightmare for the clan, especially since Mu Ningxue was now standing on the opposite side from them.

Mo Fan came forward and glanced at the Great Elder, who was trying his best to swallow his words.

The other members of the clan meeting had arrived now. Mo Fan was disgusted by the smug looks on their faces.

The battle had been going on for some time, yet none of them had bothered to show up. They had only intervened when Mu Feiluan was close to death!

“Old man, shouldn’t you bring Mu Zhuoyun out by now? You better hope he’s unharmed, or this place is going to turn into a cemetery holding the graves of thousands of your disciples. As for you old pricks, we’ll do our best to kill as many of you as possible!” Mo Fan swore while pointing at the Great Elder.

“Mo Fan, Mo Fan... Can’t we just sit down and talk properly? Why do we have to complicate things further?” Mu Dao spoke up.

“You old punk, you asked me to give Wu Ku’s remains to the Highest Enforcement Union, but you asked your men to kidnap my father-in-law? You’re such an assh***!” Mo Fan retorted.

Did he think he could just show up at the end to settle the dispute?

“What do you want, then? Are you seriously trying to take on the whole clan? Do you think the Ice Crystal Bow is unstoppable?” a skinny tall man in a blue outfit harrumphed coldly.

“Mu Fangzhou, you be quiet. Go and bring Mu Zhuoyun here,” Mu Dao ordered him.

—

Mu Zhuoyun was soon brought over.

The people had obviously changed him into some clean clothes in a rush. He looked haggard and worn out, but he was not in any danger.

Mu Ningxue’s emotions finally calmed down a little after she saw her father was fine.

“Ningxue, I’m fine, let’s just go.” Mu Zhuoyun seemed nervous and uncomfortable.

Mu Ningxue might have the Ice Crystal Bow, but Mu Zhuoyun knew she could not take on the entire clan.

Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng were not even ranked in the top ten in the clan, not to mention the Mu Clan also had a Forbidden Mage!Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
