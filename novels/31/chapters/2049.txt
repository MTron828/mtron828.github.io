Mo Fan could only wait at Fanxue Mountain, grounded by the Queen of the Netherworld. He had no way of learning what had happened to Qin Yu’er.

Mo Fan could only spend his time experimenting with the Tianshan Sacred Lotus. After all, becoming stronger was his first priority now!

After some close observation, he realized there was nothing special about the Tianshan Sacred Lotus except for the slight fragrance it was emitting.

“Why are you staring at it? Don’t tell me you are trying to neutralize the oiliness in your stomach after eating too much meat recently?” Mo Fan saw the little cub lying on the dining table. Her belly was as round as an inflated ball.

The little cub seemed to like Fanxue Mountain, especially the mountain full of peach trees and maple trees occupied by countless mystical moths. The moths were dancing everywhere. The little cub could play around on it for a whole day. She would dig a hole to take a nap if she was sleepy, and eat some delicious fruits when she was hungry.

Mo Fan was sitting on the balcony of Yu Shishi’s hut. There were a few high-level Mages in Feiniao City. If they happened to see the little cub, they might kidnap her and conduct experiments on her.

Therefore, Mo Fan had decided to put the little cub under Yu Shishi’s care.

The Moon Moth Phoenix was aware of Mo Fan’s arrival. She flew over from the slope in the distance, beating her soft and luminescent wings and spreading colorful dust in the air. The dust would soon disappear, like a rainbow that was gliding across the sky.

The little cub raised her head. Her eyes were fixed on the Moon Moth Phoenix, as if she had never seen such a beautiful lady before.

“Hey, watch your drool... can you please behave like a Totem Beast for once? Stop drooling over the table all the time!” Mo Fan snarled.

The little cub quickly wiped her mouth with her paw. Meanwhile, the Moon Moth Phoenix began to shrink as she reached the hut. She eventually turned into a tiny moth before landing on Mo Fan’s shoulder.

She was inspecting the little cub, who was also staring back at her. The two creatures began communicating with one another.

“Stop trying to impress one another with your cuteness, you two. If Little Flame Belle was here, you two would be like old women compared to her. You know that, right?” Mo Fan said.

The Moon Moth Phoenix’s intelligence was not fully developed, and the little cub was a complete retard, so the two little creatures soon started playing with one another. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The little cub did not really enjoy herself when she was playing with the moths. She was too quick for them, so she had to slow down on purpose, but that was no longer necessary when playing with the Moon Moth Phoenix.

Mo Fan was experimenting with the Tianshan Sacred Lotus on the balcony while the Moon Moth Phoenix and little cub kept running around the hut and leaving afterimages in different spots. In Mo Fan’s eyes, they were simply flashing back and forth. The little cub had finally found her playmate, and no longer asked Mo Fan to bring her to the city.

Yu Shishi came out of her hut. Her eyes glittered when she saw the Tianshan Sacred Lotus in Mo Fan’s hands.

“Where did you find that?” Yu Shishi asked.

“I found it on Tianshan Mountain, and almost died because of it. I’m wondering if I should sell it and buy some useful magic Equipment with the money, or if I should keep it if it has some uses, like being able to come seven times in a night. Then I’ll consider keeping it,” Mo Fan said.

“Give it to the Moon Moth Phoenix then,” Yu Shishi said.

“That won’t do, I desperately want to become stronger,” Mo Fan rejected immediately.

“I recall you still have a Fruit of Vow. Did you use it?” Yu Shishi asked.

“No, I’m considering selling it for money too,” Mo Fan replied.

“Since when are you so hungry for money?” Yu Shishi asked.

“I have too many Elements to nurture. I won’t be able to do it without money. My Earth Element, do you know how impressive my Rock Element is? I just can’t afford a suitable Spirit-grade Seed or Soul-grade Seed,” Mo Fan sighed.

“Do you want a Heaven Seed?” Yu Shishi asked him.

“What Heaven Seed?” Mo Fan did not react at first. His eyes widened after some time, “Do you mean a Heaven-grade Seed, which is a level above a Soul-grade Seed?”

“What else could it be?” Yu Shishi agreed.

“Heaven-grade Seed? To be honest with you, I have never seen one being auctioned before. Isn’t it priceless?” Mo Fan gulped.

“Of course it is, since it can only be refined under extremely harsh conditions. A place with extreme levels of a certain Element alone isn’t enough...” Yu Shishi answered him.

“Wait a second, where did you learn about a Heaven-grade Seed? Why did you ask me?” Mo Fan realized something was up.

“Do you want a Heaven-grade Seed?” Yu Shishi grinned. She believed no one would lack interest in a Heaven-grade Seed.

Mo Fan opened his mouth wide. He was speechless all of a sudden.

A Heaven-grade Seed! He had never heard of anyone with a Heaven-grade Seed!

“Did you really think the Research Union is after me because of the Moon Moth Phoenix?” Yu Shishi said.

“Do you really know how to get a Heaven-grade Seed?” Mo Fan’s eyes were glittering with greed.

If he could obtain a Heaven-grade Seed for any of his Elements, he would be unstoppable in the Super Level, as long as he did not stumble into monsters with every Element at the Super Level!

“The blessing from the Fruit of Vow gave me a special ability. If you still have a Fruit of Vow, I might be able to evolve one of your Soul-grade Seeds with the power of the Tianshan Sacred Lotus. If you’re lucky, you might end up with a Heaven-grade Seed,” Yu Shishi proposed to him!

“Are you trying to trick me?” Mo Fan found it hard to believe.

“It’s up to you. You can sell them if you want,” Yu Shishi replied carelessly.

“Can a Soul-grade Seed really evolve into a Heaven-grade Seed?” Mo Fan pressed her.

“It’s possible, but it’s similar to the process of tempering iron into steel. I’m familiar with your Elements, too. I believe your Earth Element with an innate additional effect is your best bet, since the rest of your Elements are close to being finalized,” Yu Shishi said.

“I don’t understand,” Mo Fan said.

“It’s a little complicated. A Heaven-grade Seed must not have any impurity, but most Soul Seeds contain other Elements in them. After all, there’s no such thing as a perfect Elemental Ground. There is wind in a land of ice, fire amid lightning, and light amid flames... no Soul Seed is one hundred percent pure. It will be mixed with other Elements while it is formed, but a Heaven-grade Seed must only contain a single Element,” Yu Shishi stated clearly.

“So, you can get me a Heaven-grade Seed?” Mo Fan asked.

“There’s no such thing as a free lunch. You must put in the effort and take the risk, but if you are seriously after a Heaven-grade Seed, I can lend you a hand. Your Earth Element has a better chance of refining a Heaven-grade Seed!” Yu Shishi stated firmly.
