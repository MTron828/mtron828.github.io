Chapter 2653: Strange Deception

It was pretty obvious what the Northern Sacred Bears had been planning. They were going to have eight of the core members take the ride and leave the others behind to be eaten by the Sharkmen.

Unfortunately, the Northern Sacred Brothers would no longer get their wish, thanks to Mo Fan’s intervention!

Mo Fan’s group had six people, including Apas. They could only take two people of the Northern Sacred Bears with them, who would then be handed over to the authorities.

Did they think they could take a comfortable ride out of China after stealing something so valuable? They should just clean themselves and prepare to be sent to prison!

“Some sharp claws you have there. I wonder if they are better than mine!” Mo Fan smiled.

He swiftly brought out the Black Dragon Sleeves, the sharp claws sticking out of his fingers. The claws were obsidian, and flickered intimidatingly

“A piece of wearable Magic Equipment?” Kunoy’s eyes glittered with greed when he saw Mo Fan’s Sleeves.

They were a rare kind of Magic Equipment. Not only could they greatly increase a person’s odds of survival, they could also be used to give the enemy a deadly blow when they least expected it!

Kunoy did not expect the young man to have so many valuables on him. It certainly explained why he had the guts to challenge them!

A dark Aura lingered in the air like a mist and reduced the visibility in the area.

Dark cold water was rising under Kunoy’s feet, the viscous water rippling below him. It felt like he had fallen into a dark swamp. The eerie and confusing environment made it impossible to tell what direction was what.

A black puff of smoke suddenly turned into a slender figure behind Kunoy. It raised its claws high grinning eerily.

“Trying to ambush me?” Kunoy whirled around and drove his claws into Mo Fan’s ribs!

Kunoy lifted the slender figure up. Its feet were dangling above the ground, and it was slowly revealing its true appearance.

“This is nothing but a useless trick. The Northern Sacred Bears are stronger than you think!” Kunoy snarled. He jammed the claws deeper into Mo Fan’s ribs to make sure he was dead.

Kunoy looked at Mo Fan. He was expecting to see a twisted expression of pain on Mo Fan’s face. The Sacred Bear Claws were the deadliest weapon of the Bear Sorcery Tribe. Many defenses were just like pieces of paper before them!

However, Mo Fan was still wearing the same smile. He was impaled through the chest and had been lifted into the air, but the smile remained unchanged.

Kunoy was stunned.

Mo Fan’s body suddenly dispersed into black smoke, like black ink blending into a lake after touching the water.

“How is this possible? It was clearly solid!” Kunoy yelled.

He was not an inexperienced Mage who was easily deceived by an enemy, nor would he mistake a decoy for the real enemy.

The figure he stabbed was clearly Mo Fan’s true self. How did it disperse like a puff of smoke? What kind of magic could turn a person into smoke? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A cold flicker swept across the lake.

Mo Fan reappeared at the edge of the light. His back was cold and dark, like a blood elf hovering in the darkness.

Five claw marks had been slashed down Kunoy’s back. His defense was outstanding in his half-beast form, yet it was like a piece of paper against Mo Fan’s claws.

“Die!” Kunoy snarled.

He crossed his claws and fired rings of flame at Mo Fan. He had turned into a fiery bear tyrant after losing his temper, trying to establish his kingdom of hellish flames!

Mo Fan’s figure dispersed into the air once more as the rings of flames approached him. It looked like he could instantly appear from the black mist and be everywhere, as if he had full control of the order in the mist.

The black mist remained despite the strength of the flames. Its area of effect was greater than Kunoy had imagined, and his flames were only burning a small portion of it. They were insignificant, like a firefly in complete darkness!

“Is this the Shadow Element? The Space Element?

“No, it’s the Chaos Element!

“You prick, how dare you use these boring tricks to make fun of me!?” Kunoy was infuriated. He finally realized what his enemy was doing.

He had deduced the nature of the phenomenon that was occurring and cracked it with the appropriate move, but the outcome was completely the opposite!

It was just the nature of the Chaos Element. It was like a clown pulling off a magic trick. People would marvel at it at first, but in the end, it was just a deceptive trick. It could never be compared with the real deal!

The Northern Sacred Bears’ metamorphing ability was the real deal!

Kunoy calmed down. He did not attack the shadows without reason. He knew his enemy was constantly throwing smoke grenades at him. All he had to do was identify the nature of the enemy’s trick.

The secret was… the mirror on the surface of the swamp!

The muddy swamp did not seem reflective, but it was in fact a huge mirror without a smooth surface. Every time he attacked the decoy that looked real to him, the real enemy was actually on the other side of the mirror.

Therefore, the real enemy’s location was...

Kunoy stared down at his feet.

He indeed saw a silhouette under the swamp. Its movements were in sync with the dispersing smoke. In other words, his enemy had been hiding in the swamp all along. He was deceiving Kunoy by projecting his shadows!

It was the reason why he could disperse so strangely, just like a puff of smoke!

Kunoy was laughing grimly in his heart, but he pretended he was still clueless about the situation.

He pretended to prepare his defense, but he was curling his other claw, ready to deliver a deadly blow to his enemy the next time Mo Fan came close to him!
