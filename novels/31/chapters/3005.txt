3006 Weird Forgetting

When Parina was resurrected, Salan was beside Wen Tai, holding a one-year-old baby girl in her arms.

Salan recognized Parina. She laughed at Parina, which made her wish to pull out her sword and stab Salan’s heart.

She had failed the Divine Soul and Wen Tai’s choice. Once again, she carelessly handed over her life.

Salan did not kill her. She, instead, picked up a saber and left a mark on her back which bled profusely.

The wound was not fatal, but it made Parina feel humiliated.

“There are many Red Cardinals and a Supreme Pontiff whose true identity has never been known in the Black Vatican. It may not be Ye Chang who did this,” Tata said.

“I’ll investigate.” Parina clenched her fists.

“We have to find her. According to her usual behavior, this torture and massacre may be just the beginning,” Xinxia said to Parina.

“Understood.”

“She is taking revenge on Izisha. In fact, we don’t have to be so…” Tata knew exactly what Ye Chang was going to do.

Izisha was Ye Chang’s lifelong enemy.

When Wen Tai was judged by the priest, there were eleven stones in total. When guilt and innocence were equal, Izisha chose to kill Wen Tai even though she was his sister!

This was the source of the biggest change and split in the Parthenon Temple at that time.

Izisha executed her own brother!

Ye Chang hated Izisha deeply. When Ye Chang became the Red Cardinal Salan, who owned a group of believers who were notorious all over the world, she took revenge and brutally killed all those who threw black stones. She did not hesitate to slaughter the families of those people and destroy the whole city.

The whole world thought Salan was a madwoman who killed everyone she saw. Every place she went was left full of corpses in her wake. However, those who used to be with Wen Tai knew this happened because of Izisha’s decision!

It was Izisha who turned Ye Chang into the Red Cardinal Salan, and the increasingly powerful Salan finally started her final revenge.

“I’ll go to Izisha to inquire about the situation. You’ve been busy all day, so you should rest now. I’ll report to you as soon as there is any progress.”

Parina bid farewell to them. Xinxia nodded and let Parina leave.

“You should take a rest too.” Tata knew that she had said many things that should not have been said today, so she thought it would be better to leave early.

Xinxia was indeed tired. She could not even remember if she had had her dinner.

After changing her clothes, Xinxia was about to find someone when there were a few light footsteps outside the main hall.

“Xinxia, are you done with your work?” The middle-aged man walked to her with a smile.

“Yes. Dad, where have you been? I haven’t seen you all day today.” Xinxia smiled. Seeing loved ones was always comforting to her. She felt as if the entire cold Saintess’ Hall suddenly had a lot of warmth.

Mo Jiaxin sighed. “Let’s not talk about it. I made a mistake and went to another Saintess’ Hall. I met someone there but when I mentioned you, her face darkened.”

“You made it to Izisha’s side?” Xinxia blinked.

“Who is Izisha? Is she the other goddess? You can’t blame me. When I got lost, a lady pointed the way to me. I didn’t know there were two Saintess’ Halls, so I thought that was the way back here,” Mo Jiaxin said. “That woman is silly. She should have told me that there are two Saintess’ Halls.”

“Maybe she thought you were visiting relatives,” said Xinxia.

“It’s all Mo Fan’s fault. He insisted on having me stay in Athens. I’m not used to Goddess Peak. It is full of girls. I’m still more comfortable with London. I can grow flowers, and Brother Zhuoyun can play chess with me,” said Mo Jiaxin.

“It’s all my fault that I don’t have time to accompany you,” Xinxia said, ashamed.

“That’s fine. This place is actually not bad. I’ll go for a walk in the city tomorrow, so I don’t have to stay on the mountain all the time,” said Mo Jiaxin.

“Okay, I’ll have Chris accompany you.”

“No, no, I’ll take a stroll by myself. I’m quite comfortable walking in Athens by myself. Alas, it’s better to have a daughter. You can do great things for the country and take care of the family. Look at Mo Fan. He is like a homeless child. I never see him. He won’t even call me!” Mo Jiaxin complained.

Ye Xinxia hesitated but still did not tell him the truth. Mo Jiaxin’s current state was good. He had no cultivation, so he did not understand and did not need to know things that didn’t concern him.

“Dad, can you tell me about the past? About…” Xinxia was a little reluctant to speak.

“Well, it’s been many years, so I can’t remember clearly. At that time, there was an old house next door. Your mother moved there with you, and we became neighbors.” Mo Jiaxin knew what Xinxia wanted to ask.

“Any more details?” Xinxia asked.

“There’s nothing special. Your mother looks ordinary, and she is a bit stupid. She didn’t know anything about cooking, washing, cleaning, and taking care of a child, so she often came to ask me for help. Eventually, our two families became one.” Mo Jiaxin did not think there was anything incomprehensible in that story.

She was a widow with a child. As a neighbor, Mo Jiaxin would do his best to help her. After living together for a short time, Ye Xinxia’s mother suddenly disappeared. At that time, Mo Jiaxin thought it was normal.

After all, she was a single mother and might not have wanted to be burdened. He always thought that such a life put too much pressure on her, and she decided to leave.

Mo Jiaxin treated Xinxia as his own daughter. Mo Fan also liked her a lot and cared for her like his own sister.

Although life was a little bit difficult, Mo Jiaxin was still relieved that the two children had grown up healthily.

Mo Jiaxin looked at Xinxia. He suddenly seemed to have something very important to tell her but he couldn’t remember.

In spite of his best efforts, Mo Jiaxin could not recall it. It was extremely strange. After a while, Mo Jiaxin gave up.

“Why do you suddenly want to know about this? Did you find something related to her?” Mo Jiaxin asked.

“No. I just remembered some things from my childhood and wanted to talk with you. I don’t know if it was just a hallucination or if it did happen.”

“You still remember things from when you were a child?”

“Yes, I have some vague memories.”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
