It was fine that the Snake Empress was stopping them from protecting their nest. After all, if they managed to achieve a good result during the ceremony, they would be able to find themselves a better tree to live on. To their surprise, the snake empress was forcing them to attack the Giant Purple Linden, too!

Not only did they fail to stop the people burning their household, they were forced to help them carry the bricks away, too! How unacceptable!

The Scale-Winged Serpent leading the others was totally regretting it. Why did it bother to come back to protect the tree? It should have waited for the ceremony to start instead!

—

The Scale-Winged Serpents soon returned, and started tearing at the thick branches of the Giant Purple Linden right away. Their fangs were sharp and had a strong acidic effect. Their poison might not be effective against the tree, but the corrosive power was still deadly to it.

The Devil Tree Spikes were the Giant Purple Linden’s branches. The Scale-Winged Serpents’ numbers were surprisingly high,and the Giant Purple Linden was struggling to fend them off when they all lunged at the tree and tore at its branches!

As a matter of fact, the Giant Purple Linden was furious. These goddamned snakes had been eating and drinking on it for at least half a year, but not only were they ungrateful, they were helping the outsiders to attack it too! What the heck was going on today!?

Meanwhile, the Scale-Winged Serpents were not brainless, either. They were quite confused when they saw the true appearance of the Giant Purple Linden. The Scale-Winged Serpents were enraged once Apas told their leader about the Giant Purple Linden’s disguise. The tree they had been living on was actually a bloody trap!

The number of Devil Tree Spikes was greatly reduced following the attacks from the Scale-Winged Serpents. The Violet Imperial Battalion continued to damage the tree’s stem and roots, while the trunk was burned by Mo Fan’s magic. The treetop was under heavy attack from the Scale-Winged Serpents who had turned against it. The Giant Purple Linden began to let out cries of agony, finally exposing its true self!

The winged beasts hovering in the air were astounded and terrified after seeing the Giant Purple Linden’s true appearance. They did not expect a demon to be hiding among the trees they were living on. The winged beasts no longer bothered to interfere with the matter. They might not like the outsiders, but they were more afraid of the monster that had disguised itself in their territory!

“At last, they have shown up!” Yu Shishi blurted out in joy.

The Sacred Linden Leaves finally appeared after the demon tree revealed its true appearance. The Giant Purple Linden had no clue that Yu Shishi, Bai Hongfei, and Zhang Xiaohou were still hiding higher up in it. Its Devil Tree Spikes were busy attacking its foes further down. It completely ignored the three at the top!

“The Sacred Linden Leaves are located at the center of the Devil Tree Spikes. We shouldn’t approach them recklessly, or the Devil Tree Spikes will turn us into beehives,” Bai Hongfei noticed.

“Let’s wait a little longer. Let them deal with the Devil Tree Spikes first,” Zhang Xiaohou agreed.

“Mm, alright,” Yu Shishi seemed a little nervous. After all, the Sacred Linden Leaves would decide the fate of her moths. If she managed to help the Moon Moth Silkworm evolve into a little Moon Moth Phoenix, it would guarantee the safety of the moths, too!

“How strange, where did so many white wolves come from?” Bai Hongfei suddenly asked.

Zhang Xiaohou looked down and noticed many white wolves weaving through the branches and attacking the trunk. With the combined efforts of a few hundred demon wolves and the Scale-Winged Serpents attacking the tree, the Giant Purple Linden began to lose its branches rapidly!

“It’s Brother Fan’s Advanced Summoning Spell!” Zhang Xiaohou was overjoyed.

“How many wolves did he Summon with the spell? It looks like some of them are even Commander-level creatures!” Bai Hongfei blurted out in disbelief.

The wolves could easily pluck away every Sacred Linden Leaf with a bite each. The three at the top slowly moved closer when they noticed that there was not much defense left around the Sacred Linden Leaves.

Zhang Xiaohou was leading the way. He noticed the purple leaves wriggling when he was approaching them on the wilted branches!

“Don’t tell me these leaves can attack too?” Zhang Xiaohou exclaimed.

The purple leaves began to move as he went a little closer. They surprisingly extended their edges and revealed spikes like porcupines.

“They are parasitic worms, they are not leaves!” Yu Shishi told Zhang Xiaohou after taking a closer look.

The number of the purple parasitic worms was shocking. The ‘leaves’ around them began to swarm toward Zhang Xiaohou along the branches.

Their jumping ability was quite insane. They sprang at Zhang Xiaohou from all directions like the head of a morning star with poisonous spikes once they were close enough.

“Wind, rise!”

Zhang Xiaohou spun around in a circle. A gust of wind rose from his feet and formed a barrier around him. The strong wind bounced off the parasitic worms!

“More of them are coming from below!” Yu Shishi noticed the leaves below them wriggling, too.

Bai Hongfei looked down and saw parasitic worms climbing up the branches. It felt like they were going to devour them at any second!

“I’ll handle them!” Bai Hongfei quickly cast an Advanced Fire Spell.

Six Hellish Flames lunged at the Parasitic Leaf Porcupines that were surging up the branches like a tide. The powerful flames set the parasitic worms ablaze and turned them into scorched balls. However, they continued to climb toward the invaders recklessly.

Bai Hongfei’s Hellish Flames kept pouring down. The flames had almost turned the layer they were at into a blazing sea of fire, but the numbers of the Parasitic Leaf Porcupines showed no sign of falling. They continued to pounce at the invaders like sharp and poisonous fangs, spinning at an insane speed. Bai Hongfei began to panic a little. He had no choice but to back away with Yu Shishi.

“We can’t get any closer!” Bai Hongfei said.

The Parasitic Leaf Porcupines were like a bunch of death knights raised by the Giant Purple Linden. They would launch suicide attacks at any invaders trying to steal the Sacred Linden Leaves. They did not have an outstanding defense, but they were abusing their speed and poisonous spikes to drive away the enemy, or end their lives in mutual destruction!

“Your flames are effective against them, but they aren’t concentrated enough!” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“I’m aware of that,” Bai Hongfei said.

“Keep using the same spell!” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Bai Hongfei did not ask Zhang Xiaohou what his plan was. The truth was, he did not dare to stop Casting. The parasitic worms only knew to attack invaders mindlessly. These creatures were even trickier to deal with than the undead in some ways!

The Hellish Flames began pouring down again. This time, Bai Hongfei used his magic equipment to increase the temperature of the flames. The Parasitic Leaf Porcupines would burn to ashes if they were exposed to the flames for more than three seconds!

Unfortunately, the Hellish Flames could not last for long!

“Wind, absorb!”

Zhang Xiaohou was still surrounded by the Parasitic Leaf Porcupines. However, these parasitic worms had no chance of hurting him with his outstanding control of the wind.

Zhang Xiaohou had slightly modified the traits of his Wind Magic, scattering a dozen Wind Seals in the flames. The seals would be triggered once the Hellish Flames were at their strongest, turning them into gusts of wind!

A dozen gusts of wind formed, wielding a special absorbing force that swiftly drew in the flames nearby. They soon turned into burning gusts of wind!

“Wind, merge!”

Zhang Xiaohou forcibly merged the gusts of wind into one.

The winds were now blowing in the same direction. Zhang Xiaohou had obviously done something like this before. The gusts of wind had turned into a shocking firestorm!

The winds had absorbed the flames, and the firestorm was full of the Hellish Flames, making them even deadlier!

“Die!”

Zhang Xiaohou shoved his hands forward. The Hellflame Firestorm swept forward, igniting both the Devil Tree Spikes and the Parasitic Leaf Porcupines along the way before burning them into ashes.

The hurricane left nothing but destruction along its path. Zhang Xiaohou turned to Bai Hongfei and Yu Shishi, “Quick, this is our chance. The firestorm will last for some time!”

Bai Hongfei and Yu Shishi, who had been stunned by the spectacular sight, immediately caught up to Zhang Xiaohou. The path was clear thanks to the Hellish Firestorm. The Parasitic Leaf Porcupines kept showing up in numbers even after they saw how destructive the Hellflame Firestorm was. They were mindlessly pouncing at the firestorm instead of waiting for it to pass!

The temperature of the Hellish Flames had significantly increased under the concentrating effect of the wind. The Parasitic Leaf Porcupines immediately turned into ashes as soon as they were close to the flames. They had no chance of escaping the power of the firestorm that was drawing them in!

The Hellflame Firestorm was like a moving cremation machine, sucking everything nearby into it. Countless Parasitic Leaf Porcupines died to it. Zhang Xiaohou, Bai Hongfei, and Yu Shishi cleared a path to the Sacred Linden Leaves.

The firestorm lasted for quite a while. The Hellish Flames had already dissipated, but the hurricane winds continued to travel into the distance.

“Do we just pluck the leaves?” Zhang Xiaohou asked. The Sacred Linden Leaves were less than ten meters away from him now!
