Everyone felt flames of anger bursting out from their chests when they heard General Mott’s words.

The man was forcing them to kill themselves!

A horde of strange birds... even a whole army would have trouble eliminating them, let alone a team of young Magicians!

Their only chance to survive was to rely on the city’s defense!

They did not expect General Mott to be so cruel and cold-blooded. He was insisting that the team must die!

“Your country has failed to keep the demon creatures at bay. Why do we have to be responsible for it?” said Nanyu angrily.

“Humph, we are not obliged to sacrifice our soldiers to protect you. I’ll give you one last minute to leave our city at once!” said General Mott.

“You!”

“Nanyu, forget it, it’s useless wasting our precious time with someone like him,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“I’m not going out, there’s no way I’m going out! We’re dead for sure if we go out. It’s all your fault that we had to step inside that place. I have nothing to do with it!” Zu Jiming started screaming.

“If you don’t leave, I’ll put an end to your lives myself!” said General Mott murderously.

Jiang Shaoxu was infuriated. She pointed at General Mott and said, “I dare you to kill us all right now! Every person you kill here, our factions in China will annihilate a tribe of your people in return. I’m eager to see how many authorities you have behind you that are going to die when they take their revenge!”

Jiang Shaoxu was very aggressive, too. Her words immediately highlighted the fact that General Mott was most worried about.

Anyone that could become a representative of the national team surely had a formidable background. Each faction supporting them basically had great influence in the running of their country.

If the general actually killed them all, the government would have a hard time calming all the factions, since they each had their own way of doing things. Even though the factions would not do anything too extreme on the surface, who knew what kind of things they would do behind the scenes to take revenge?

“Do you think threatening me here is going to save your life? You’re the ones that the strange birds are after!” Mott did not show his emotion through his expression. His face remained stern and cold.

“What proof do you have?” asked Jiang Shaoxu.

“Nothing, but you know the truth yourself!” said Mott.

“Everyone, let’s stop arguing among ourselves. I believe General Mott is concerned about the safety of the city. After all, it’s a horde of flying creatures we are speaking of. Lima can easily defend against sea monsters, but it’s going to have a hard time dealing with flying creatures. Lots of people are going to die. Since we still have some time, your team should run to the south along the shoreline. You will find an ancient castle. It might buy you some time for you to recall what you’ve done that offended these ancient creatures from Nazca. It’s your only chance to live,” said Ariosto. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Mo Fan agreed that it was meaningless to argue with the general here. His advisors had obviously told him the only options. Either they forced the team to leave the city, or killed them all and tossed their bodies out. Staying in the city would only have one outcome!

As for being avenged by their factions, they were already dead, what was the point of getting revenge? They would have ceased to exist in this world!

Ai Jiangtu shared the same thought. They had to leave right away. General Mott was determined to kill them. If they were thinking of getting their revenge, they had to make sure they could survive the horde of strange birds first!

“(sigh), General Mott, I really think what we did was wrong. Besides, we weren’t even sure they are the cause, either!” protested Ariosto.

“I don’t care about them. I only care about the safety of the city I’m in charge of!” Mott stared after the Chinese team that had left the Royal Felipe Castle without any hint of regret.

“But that doesn’t mean we can ignore the problem. If it’s our people instead, are we going to toss them out too? Why do we have to live in fear of Nazca instead of trying to solve the problem?” said Ariosto.

“It’s easy to say, do you know how many people are going to die?” responded Mott.

“I know you’ve made the right call, but I’m just worried about something even scarier,” replied Ariosto.

General Mott fell silent. He raised his head, staring at the terrifying curtain of strange birds looming over the city...

The well-lit city gradually turned dark. The calm ocean was invaded by loud noise. The people of Lima were astounded by the sight in the sky. Their faces were filled with disbelief.

The creatures flew past the shoreline, ignoring the city and the people...

They were on the chase. They had passed the Royal Felipe Castle. Shadows that urged Magicians to flee for their lives were looming over the place.

The shoreline was quite long. The team had yet to find the castle that Ariosto mentioned. As the horde of strange birds gradually approached, no one had the mood to talk. Their only thought was to get rid of the birds as quickly as possible.

Not long after arriving in the country, it was like they had been placed under a curse. The strange birds would follow them wherever they went. They always thought it was the last time, but the birds would return when they had almost forgotten about them.

“It’s right ahead, I can see it!” yelled Li Kaifeng who was at the front.

The team finally saw a castle by the shore. It was an ancient structure located on a cliff. A few parts of it had fallen into the sea. Ariosto did not lie to them. The ancient castle had an ideal terrain for setting up their defense. It could definitely buy them some time!

The team rushed into the ancient castle. The place was completely empty. The style of the castle was Spanish, and well-preserved.

“Let’s head inside!” Ai Jiangtu led the team into the ancient castle on the cliff.

The materials used to build the castle was quite sturdy. The strange birds would have trouble destroying the castle in a short amount of time. However, they could not just stand and watch the strange birds pecking at the castle non-stop, as once they destroyed the ancient castle, they would have nowhere else to hide!

“There’s a Barrier, the castle has a Barrier! Give me some time, I can reactivate the barrier. It can buy us more time!” As soon as Nanyu entered the castle, she immediately realized something useful.

A Barrier was incredibly important to the team, considering the situation they were in!

Everyone clenched their teeth and persevered when they learned they had a chance to live. Ai Jiangtu immediately distributed the team across the castle.

Their back was the cliff, and the sea below it. The two sides of the castle made for a sturdy defense, thus the team only needed to stop the enemy coming in from the front. The situation was not as grim as they thought.

“Split into two teams. Otherwise, our energy is going to deplete very quickly!” said Ai Jiangtu.

“We’ll defend the place first. Go inside and search around, and see if you can find anything useful,” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan, Jiang Shaoxu, Zhao Manyan, Jiang Yu, and Nanrong Ni were grouped into one team. They guarded at the entrance while the others preserved their strength.

Ai Jiangtu swiftly led the others into the ancient castle. The castle was once used as a defensive fortress, thus there might be something else that was useful apart from the Barrier.

They had to use everything they had. It went without saying that everyone would give their best when their lives were at stake.

“There are too many of them, they won’t be able to hold much longer. Damn it, damn it, what the heck are these creatures?” snapped Guan Yu furiously.

“Who knows, I’m sure that they aren’t after me. Maybe they won’t even chase me if I leave,” said Zu Jiming.

“Go ahead and try,” Ai Jiangtu offered coldly when they heard the two complaining.

Zu Jiming immediately shut his mouth. As a matter of fact, he did not even dare to try. Even though he would eventually be killed by the strange birds if he stuck to the team, he was hoping that he would die last...

“There are some magic ores here. The Barrier needs energy, these magic ores might come in handy,” said Li Kaifeng.

“Mmm, take as many as you can. The Barrier is protecting the whole castle. It’s going to consume quite a lot of energy,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“Hurry up, the five of them won’t be able to hold much longer.”

“They can only hold on for twenty minutes max, how much energy can we even replenish in twenty minutes? That asshole General Mott... if I die here, I’ll leave a message asking my family to kill his whole family!” cursed Guan Yu.

“It’s still better than dying instantly out there.”

“Mo Fan, these strange birds are after us, you should have stayed in the city,” Jiang Yu was feeling guilty when he saw Mo Fan following the team to the ancient castle.

Compared to Zu Jiming who kept scolding him, Mo Fan was more than ten thousand times better than those scum that kept complaining. Jiang Shaoxu, Nanrong Ni, and Zhao Manyan clearly knew that Mo Fan was the only person that could live, since he did not enter the forbidden land in Nazca. To their surprise, he did not abandon the team. They were actually quite touched by his decision. Anyone else would have left without hesitation... a hundred thousand creatures were more than enough to destroy an entire city! Anyone would feel extremely tiny in front of them. Friendship, family, or love were simply too fragile in front of the formidable surging tide of demon creatures!

“Don’t be touched yet, I’ve already tried. I can’t run away, either. They already remembered me back from in the storm. Hurry up and use everything you have. Otherwise, we are seriously going to die here. I can’t believe how unlucky I am to be stuck with teammates like you!” said Mo Fan, while he was busy drawing the Shadow Star Constellation.

“...”

Mo Fan did not have time to waste on being all emotional. Luckily, he had broken through the walls of his Shadow Element Nebula, allowing him to cast the Shadow Advanced Spell, Nyx Regime!

Nyx Regime was fairly effective against the strange birds that were flying in the sky, since it could disrupt their order and bring chaos and fear to them...

Nyx Regime had a terrorizing effect. It would work on any creature that was not related to the Shadow Element. On top of that, the creatures caught inside it would lose twenty percent of their strength. Although these strange birds were stronger than Servant-class creatures, they were not as strong as Warrior-level creatures. It was tricky to fight them due to their massive numbers, but once they entered Mo Fan’s Nyx Regime, their strength was equivalent to Great Servant-class creatures.

That being said, there were still quite a number of high-level creatures among the strange birds, both Warrior-level or even Great Warrior-level creatures. Since they were facing an army of a hundred thousand strange birds this time, it was likely that there were even Commander-level creatures in the horde. However, it was something they would worry about later. Their main focus was to hold on for as long as possible. They had a chance to live once Nanyu reactivated the Barrier!
