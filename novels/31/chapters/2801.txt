Chapter 2802: Do You Want It Back?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

‘Reclaim the territory along the coast from the Ocean Demons? Couldn’t we defend even 20,000 kilometers of coastline?’ Mo Fan was shocked to hear Commander Hua’s words.

It was clear that the five greatest base cities’ plan was a success. They had prevented many cities from being attacked by the Ocean Demons. They had also gathered all the mages together.

Besides, they had just killed an Emperor-level Ocean Demon and preserved the important seawall.

‘But why did Commander Hua sound so hopeless?’ thought Mo Fan. ‘Were the humans destined to fall?’

The Ocean Godly Horde was more powerful than what they had seen thus far. Commander Hua must know something else.

“You have to promise me,” Commander Hua repeated. He almost sounded desperate and sad.

Mo Fan shook his head. It was impossible not to take part in the battles against the Ocean Demons in these five years. The Ocean Demons were on the verge of attacking the cities. Mo Fan could not turn a blind eye to their invasion.

He understood Commander Hua’s concern. The war against the Ocean Demons would be brutal.?Everyone could die, including Mo Fan. They would be powerless when facing the many Emperor-level Ocean Demons that were as powerful as the Eight-headed Serpent.

Commander Hua hoped Mo Fan could avoid the tragedy and focus on his cultivation. He believed Mo Fan could face the Ocean Demon on his own some day in the future instead of fighting a hopeless battle now.

“You still don’t get it! You still don’t get what I mean!” Commander Hua turned his back to Mo Fan. He sounded annoyed. “The fact that you’ve achieved your current realm suggests that you will surpass me and the other Forbidden Mages in the future. Right now, you can’t change the situation along the coast. But you will be capable of fighting alone in five years!”

“Commander, you don’t understand either,” Mo Fan said firmly.

Even though Commander Hua was the commander of the country, Mo Fan refused to agree to his request. He found himself unable to promise him this one thing.

......

The Ocean Demon had wiped out Magic City. Pearl Institute had become a hunting ground. How could Mo Fan just stand there and do nothing while watching the Ocean Demons devouring the students and teachers?

Flying Bird Base City had become a vast ocean. Fish Men wandered around the residents in Fan Xuexin City who could not get rid of the sea area. How could Mo Fan just stand there without helping?

Even if he hid in the depths of the country or the forest and focused on his cultivation, would he ever feel at peace with himself knowing he abandoned everyone?

No. He could not.

Even if Mo Fan heeded Commander Hua’s instruction for the sake of a better future, he would not be able to hold himself back from joining the battle and helping his fellow people.

“I can’t promise you that I won’t fight the Ocean Demons if it ever comes to that,” said Mo Fan. “But I can promise you one thing, I will try my best to stay alive.”

Commander Hua was not satisfied with his response. But he knew Mo Fan well. In fact, Commander Hua believed both of them were like-minded. They believed certain things were more important than their own lives. It was precisely because of that kind of mindset that Commander Hua worried for Mo Fan.

If Mo Fan were given more time, his power would exceed everyone’s expectations. If he was given more time, he could kill Emperor-level Ocean Demons alone!

“Unfortunately, you’re not my soldier,” said Commander Hua sadly. “If you were, I would have dispatched you to the West with immediate effect.”

“I’ll heed your words and stay alive,” assured Mo Fan. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Mo Fan turned away and left. Commander Hua looked at Mo Fan’s receding back. Pang Lai heaved a long sigh.

Both Pang Lai and Commander Hua shared the same thought.

They did not want to involve Mo Fan in the battle.

…

After Mo Fan left Emperor Qin Island, he hopped onto the Green East Sea God’s back. The city and the Great Bronze Bell Hill grew fainter. They were speeding far away from the vast dry land.

The Great Bronze Bell Hill was a mountain. It used to be an ancient Great Wall. There was a beacon on the north of the Great Bronze Bell. One could enjoy the view of the endless ocean from the beacon. However, the place had lost its peace a few thousand years ago. They faced threats from the ocean frequently.

Commander Hua remained standing in place. The violent waves splashed against the wall. He stood still like a statue.

He was recovering, at least physically. He had looked frail and exhausted. But after a while had passed, he regained his majestic and intimidating aura. It was as though he could regenerate.

Perhaps Commander Hua truly possessed such an ability. Otherwise, why did the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother reveal itself to kill Commander Hua at all cost? Even though Commander Hua was severely wounded and trapped in Hawaii, his speed of recovery was amazing. The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother did not expect the heavily wounded Commander Hua to be still capable of killing it.

The ocean was pure blue. Whenever the waves clashed with the rocks and cliff, they turned frothy. The scenery was breathtaking. But Mo Fan’s heart felt heavy.

“He regards you highly,” Song Feiyao said.

“I know. But I’m still not powerful enough,” Mo Fan said bitterly.

“To me, both Commander Hua and you are already the best among the best,” said Song Feiyao.

Suddenly, the shadow of an evil demon appeared in Mo Fan’s mind. He felt as if his heart had been struck by lightning and was going to stop beating. He related the image to Commander Hua’s message to him…

The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother was just a vanguard. That shadow was the true leader of Ocean Godly Horde.

Commander Hua must have found out about the leader’s presence. Mo Fan wondered how powerful he had to be for him and Apas to stop the leader of the Ocean Godly Horde if they encountered it.

“Don’t you have the Underground Holy Spring with you?” asked Song Feiyao.

“Do you want it back?” Mo Fan’s eyes went wide.

Mo Fan would never return things which he had grabbed from others.

“I spent most of my time cultivating in the Underground Holy Spring. My body and spirit have developed certain resistance to it. The elders of Licheng Afterglow Island often assumed that they could nurture a Forbidden Mage just by cultivating in the Underground Holy Spring. How hilarious is that?! I believe Licheng Afterglow Island can never produce a Forbidden Mage,” said Song Feiyao.

“But your Underground Holy Spring contained tremendous energy. I’ve never seen such a rich Underground Holy Spring,” said Mo Fan
