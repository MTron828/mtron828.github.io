The Icebound Coffin landed less than ten meters away, behind Mo Fan.

Mo Fan turned around and was surprised to see a pitch-black creature with swords in its hands trapped inside the transparent crystal. It was locked down by the ice, and its face was still wearing a grin, as if it was seconds away from ambushing its target!

Mo Fan was stunned. Wasn’t that a Brutal Sword Death Servant? How could he be so careless that he had totally forgotten the Brutal Sword Death Servants were good at ambushing their enemies with their Shadow Element?

“Stay focused!” Mu Ningxue glared at Mo Fan, warning him to be on alert at all times.

Mo Fan shrugged and said, “I was too caught up with how pretty you are, but if it was just a bit closer, I would have surely noticed its presence!”

Mu Ningxue simply ignored Mo Fan’s words. She glanced at the pitch-black undead that was trapped in the ice and said, “Something is strange about this kind of undead.”

“They are the Brutal Sword Death Servants, the most loyal soldiers of the Pharaoh in a pyramid. They only appear close to the pyramid, so if we are planning to reach it, we’ll need to make it through them,” Mo Fan said.

Xinxia noticed Mu Ningxue was injured. She quickly drew a Star Pattern and summoned two Healing Spirits between her fingers.

The Healing Spirits danced elegantly around Mu Ningxue, sprinkling crystalline liquid like pollen to heal Mu Ningxue’s wounds while getting rid of the side effects of the injuries inflicted by the evil power.

Xinxia noticed the astonishment in Mu Ningxue’s eyes and explained, “The Parthenon Temple has granted our Healing Element the ability to purify, so we can treat many injuries that are otherwise incurable.”

Mu Ningxue was fairly surprised. Xinxia had become a brilliant Healer without her noticing; her impression of Xinxia now was completely different than she remembered.

“AHHHH!!!”

“Run, quick, or we’re all going to die here!”

“Damn it, we are only a few hundred meters away from the pyramid, we can’t give up now!”

Cries of agony and loud shouts came from the other direction. Mu Ningxue immediately floated into the air and glanced in the direction of the noise.

Around five hundred meters away was a bunch of black swordsmen similar to the undead she just killed. They were standing in formation, butchering the human Mages charging at them. Mu Ningxue could only see blood splattering across the place and smearing on the people nearby... Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Among the Brutal Sword Death Servants was a shadowy figure riding a black phantom horse. The figure was covered in a strong, pitch-black aura, and there seemed to be a black cape draped over its shoulders.

It was sitting on the back of the horse like an imperious knight. The giant, black sword in its hand was raised at the crimson-red sky, like it was summoning the power from the God of Night. Soon, a black aura started descending from the clouds!

“Unstoppable Sword of the Underworld!” an imperious voice uttered. The black knight was talking in an ancient Egyptian language. The destructive, black aura from the Kingdom of the Dead had descended upon the mundane world!

The black aura split into two, one surging across the sky imperiously, and the other slicing across the ground. Everything in the path was killed instantly!

Captain Lowar and his soldiers were within the range of the attack. He witnessed how his comrades before him were shredded into pieces, with blood pouring down like rain...

The pieces of flesh and blood smeared his face. Captain Lowar’s eyes widened as the black slash went past him too.

The world started spinning. The slash was so quick that Captain Lowar was still conscious when he was beheaded. He was able to see his body being shredded into pieces as his head was spinning in the air.

Captain Lowar’s head landed before General Fenna’s feet. She leaned forward and held the filthy head in her hands, staring at the man’s wide-open eyes.

Lowar was Fenna’s most loyal subordinate. They had been in the army for more than thirty years. Lowar always wanted to become a general with his own army. He told her his ambition on his first day, but Fenna was the one that became a general, with thousands of soldiers under her command. However, Lowar said that he would prefer serving under her rather than serving other bad-tempered generals.

Fenna knew that the man still had his ambitions. He wanted to become a Super Mage and be promoted to a general. He had been working hard for his ambition for most of his life, but now, he no longer had the chance to fulfill it...

“Can anyone tell me why a Dark Swordsmaster appeared when it’s only a mirage of a pyramid?”

“Doesn’t an undead of its kind only exist in a real pyramid? Isn’t it supposed to stay with the Pharaohs?”

“Dead, they are all dead, and we won’t live for long either...”

“A Dark Swordmaster, why, why... isn’t the pyramid just a mirage? Does that mean, it’s, it’s a real pyramid?”

The Dark Swordsmaster straightened proudly. The creature it was riding was a Commander-level Dark Phantom Horse, while it had already surpassed the Commander Level. Even Advanced Mages had no chance against its powerful attacks!

“Stay calm!” Fenna placed Lowar’s head down and closed his eyes with her hands. Her sharp eyes were filled with tears, yet she did not let them roll down her cheeks.

Fenna’s voice echoed in the soldiers’ ears, shattering the fear in their hearts.

“It’s only a mirage, and the Dark Swordsmaster isn’t invincible either! If we give up now, his sword is only going to slash at Puccini City. Tell me, is that what you want to see? Is there any meaning to live when that happens? Don’t forget, you are soldiers! Don’t waste the rest of your life regretting the timid decision you’ve made today!” Even though Fenna was a woman, her voice displayed her unyielding spirit!

There was no turning back; they could not just put their swords back into their sheath just because they had stumbled onto a strong foe; they should thrust it forward more fiercely instead!

“Sherlock, we’ll take on the Dark Swordsmaster together. The rest of you, head on to the pyramid. We will not let the dead rule our land!” Fenna yelled.

Fenna floated in the air right above the Mages, her wings beating. Her eyes were as sharp as a leopard as she stared at the Dark Swordmaster.

The Dark Swordsmaster stood out among the Brutal Sword Death Servants. Its eyes erupted in flames, displaying the pride and imperiousness of a Ruler-level creature. It did not need to show its disdain on purpose, as the bloodline of the noble royalty of ancient Egypt had been flowing in its body for thousands of years!

“Nyx Regime!” The Dark Swordsmaster raised the giant sword in its hand. A blinding glow burst out from the tip of the sword, descending upon the place and covering the basin where the pyramid was located!

A strong, dark aura swept forward. The soldiers were once again immersed in fear as they stood inside a Domain so dark they could not see their own hands.

The Nyx Regime had a huge coverage area. Inside it, every Brutal Sword Death Servant was now robed in black. The glow in their eyes had grown stronger too!

“Those undead are even stronger!”

“Quick, stand in your positions, don’t panic!”

The Brutal Sword Death Servants were assassins in the dark. Their swords were able to take out an Intermediate Mage easily, as the powerful creatures were even stronger under the dark power of the Dark Swordmaster.

It took a small squad of Battlemages a great effort just to barely kill a strengthened Brutal Sword Death Servant. The number of Brutal Sword Death Servants was enough to cause despair!

The Dark Swordsmaster remained motionless. It was unnecessary for it to be involved, as its subordinates were enough to annihilate the idiotic humans!

Mu Ningxue stepped on the wind and slowly landed. She had a grim face.

“A Dark Swordmaster... that’s something from inside a pyramid. Without four Super Mages, it’s impossible for us to deal with it!” Kulun exclaimed in astonishment.

Mo Fan had also gone to higher ground to observe the situation.

Horrifying was the only word he could think of to describe it.

The Dark Swordsmaster had only attacked twice, yet countless of people in front of the pyramid had died. Their blood was literally flowing like a river. The morale of the army dropped rapidly under the merciless massacre, as the soldiers had started to panic in fear!

The Dark Swordsmaster had taken everyone by surprise, and was simply too strong!

However, Mo Fan was slightly confused when he saw the Dark Swordmaster.

He had seen a creature that was both of the shadow magic, and an undead before!

It was hard to forget such a unique creature after seeing it once. It happened when he was on his way to find Zhang Xiaohou. It was the creature that the woman called Ye Meng’e had summoned.

It was a dark sword knight, yet Mo Fan was totally shocked by how strong it was!

The dark knight that the mysterious Ye Meng’e had Summoned had the exact same aura as the Dark Swordmaster. The only difference was the Dark Swordsmaster was bigger, and had a stronger aura.

However, Mo Fan believed they were the same creature, but Ye Meng’e’s dark knight had not reached its final form yet!

—

“Well, you can think of it as a Summoned Creature from the Underworld. It has incredible strength, it’s outstanding at using a sword, and it’s highly intelligent and loyal, too. However, it has a little weakness.”

“What weakness?”

“It’s the kind of creature that has signed a contract with the God of Darkness, thus it has to obey certain rules. One of them is if someone challenges it to a duel, it must accept. Since the God of Darkness has granted it a new life and outstanding strength, it will not allow anyone to challenge the God of Darkness’ name,” Ye Meng’e said.

“That’s pretty interesting, but why is that a weakness?”

“It’s nothing most of the time, but if someone is plotting against me, and abuses the rule to keep this stupid thing busy, the person is able to buy their acquaintances time to take me out. The rule doesn’t allow the creature to do anything else before the duel comes to an end; it will even forget its responsibility to protect its master,” Ye Meng’e said.

—

Ye Meng’e was the kind of woman that was unforgettable to a man after just a single glance. On top of that, it was very hard for Mo Fan to forget the dark knight protecting her, too.

Although Mo Fan was even more curious about Ye Meng’e’s identity, his current priority was finding a way to deal with the Dark Swordmaster.

If Ye Meng’e was not lying to him; the Dark Swordsmaster must obey certain rules and accept every challenge, and it must fight the challenger alone. It might serve as a chance they could abuse to keep the Dark Swordsmaster busy.

Their goal was not to wipe out the undead, nor were they interested in defeating the Dark Swordmaster. They were only aiming to destroy the pyramid mirage!
