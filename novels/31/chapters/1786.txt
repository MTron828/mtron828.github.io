“Luckily, the axe didn’t hit me right in the face. Otherwise, the injuries alone would’ve tortured me to death even if I managed to survive them!” Mo Fan muttered in relief.

The Potions were healing him slowly, but the burning pain was getting worse. Mo Fan was already feeling light-headed from excessive loss of blood. It was going to affect his concentration.

Mo Fan used the Fleeing Shadow to escape to a safe distance. The Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon seemed to know where Mo Fan was. It calmly looked in his direction, but did not chase after him.

The Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon was obviously after the Barrier Core. If Mo Fan kept running away with the Shadow Element and Space Element, it would only be wasting his time. Now that it had inflicted serious injuries on him, it no longer had to worry about him.

“Mo Fan… are you alright!?” Wen Xia asked when she found Mo Fan covered in wounds.

“Still alive. It seems your intention to build a city here has provoked that king of the mountain. You will need at least three times the size of the army here to defend the city,” Mo Fan replied, panting heavily.

Mo Fan had been to the west. He knew the efforts that Li Man’s sister, the stubborn general, had put in to build a safe city. Even though this city was a fortress with a certain level of defense and its own troop, the demon creatures in the mountains were obviously not going to stand still and watch this fortress being upgraded into an Elemental Capital with such a powerful Barrier.

The demon creatures had obviously planned this invasion. It was impossible to defend the city without seven to eight Super Mages and over five thousand elite soldiers.

“We would like to have triple the number of troops too, but…” Wen Xia could not help but grimace when she heard Mo Fan’s words.

They had already allocated as many men they could. Every fortress along the coastline was short on men, and the headquarters cities desperately needed patrols, since battles were taking place everywhere. They could only assign so many men to defend the city. They knew how dangerous the situation was going to be when the Barrier Core was being established, yet they had no choice but to take a huge leap of faith…

“Don’t cry, I’m not dead yet,” Mo Fan blurted out when he saw Wen Xia tearing up with a wronged and discontented face.

“I’m not crying because of you. I was just thinking how useless I am when I think how the city is going to be overrun by the monsters, and the higher-ups will have to send more backup to rescue us!” Wen Xia said.

“…there’s always a chance to lose a fight. If we win every battle, we would have conquered the world by now. Why would we be striving to survive in a little crack between the kingdoms of demon creatures? This loss is just one of many. Don’t let it bother you too much,” Mo Fan said.

“I would rather die than lose the battle!” Wen Xia shouted.

“Hey, don’t be so hot-tempered!” Mo Fan was surprised. He quickly said, “Look at you, you are still so young, a pretty lady with huge… there are a lot of wonderful things about life you haven’t enjoyed yet. Why must you be so stubborn and sacrifice yourself for a difficult battle? As long as the green mountains remain, we won’t have to worry about not having woods to burn. Besides, you are responsible for the trauma you caused to my groin, too. You can’t just go and sacrifice yourself!”

Wen Xia was amused by Mo Fan’s silly talk, even though she was not in a good mood. Why did the man still have the mood to utter such nonsense when he was covered in injuries?

“You shouldn’t be in a rush to get yourself killed. Let me see if I can convince someone to help us. We might have a chance if she’s willing to lend a hand.” Mo Fan let out a sigh. He knew Wen Xia was going to defend the city with her life by the look in her eyes. The only way he could think of to defeat the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon was to ask the little thicc beauty… uh, little Apas to help them.

Mo Fan was not feeling too confident either, knowing how superior the snake beauty felt. She only ended up with Mo Fan because she had fallen into a cunning trap. She was still patiently waiting for her chance to get her revenge.

Wen Xia followed Mo Fan’s instructions and went to the central plaza to look for a pretty girl. She did find a girl by the fountain wearing a short tee.

The T-shirt was too short, revealing her slim and pale waist, complementing her low-cut jeans. Wen Xia was dazzled by her curves.

The area around the fountain was in a mess. The remains of a Black-Silver Rock Demon were scattered across the ground nearby, together with a few hundred Mages covered in ash cocoons. The young woman did not bother checking on them. She had casually placed her shoes aside and was soaking her legs in the cool water while humming a happy tune.

The young woman had an otherworldly presence, like the daughter of a deity out of a painting. It did not even feel like she was in the middle of a battlefield covered in debris. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wen Xia brought Apas to Mo Fan’s side. She immediately put on a concerned look when she saw Mo Fan covered in blood and wounds. She said softly, “Big brother, how did you get so badly wounded? Are you alright? You’re not going to die, aren’t you?”

“We are bound by the Contract, and you’re telling me you had no idea I was injured? You’re such a hypocrite. Were you only willing to show up after that thing chopped me in half?” Mo Fan snarled.

“I wasn’t aware at all. I was taking care of the ugly creature like you told me to. I’ve taken good care of your wolves, too. What else do you want from me?” Apas immediately put on a wronged expression.

Wen Xia might actually have believed that if she had not seen the young woman casually taking a foot bath at the fountain in a battlezone.

“Enough with your acting, I can’t stand it anymore. Go take care of that Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon, and I’ll buy you as many kilos of crayfish as you want,” Mo Fan said.

“First of all, I’m not a three-year-old! You can’t use a few kilos of crayfish to trick me into doing something so dangerous. Second, I can’t do anything about that thing. Do you really think of me as such a crappy Contracted Beast? I will definitely do my best if I have the ability to lift the burden from your shoulder, but there are things I can’t do no matter how hard I try. If you think I’m useless, feel free to terminate the contract with me peacefully,” Apas rebutted.

Mo Fan’s head hurt after hearing Apas’ argument.

Apas’ true strength was comparable to the Queen of the Netherworld, who was one of the Eight Undead Rulers under the King of Undead’s command, a battle machine among the Ruler-level creatures. It could not be easier for Apas to take out the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon. The only time Mo Fan would believe Apas’ words was when the sun was rising in all four directions at the same time!

The contract did limit Apas’ strength when Mo Fan was still in the Advanced Level, but he had already reached the Super Level. It might still limit Apas’ strength a little, since she was a true Medusa with a pure lineage.

But still, to think that a powerful and noble Medusa was unable to take care of a stinky rock monster?
