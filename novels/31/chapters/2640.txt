Little Blue Kun suddenly wriggled his body and reminded Zhao Manyan of their situation.

Zhao Manyan looked around him and saw countless black figures moving freely. Their sinister fangs were glowing in the dark.

“There’s nowhere to run!” Zhao Manyan’s face darkened.

He had not found an exit. They had arrived at a dead end.

“That way!” Zhao Manyan had no choice but to ask Little Blue Kun to go deeper.

There was only stone below them, but there were irregular cracks cutting across it. Some were as tiny as alleys, while others were as large as canyons.

Zhao Manyan had nowhere else to go. He could only hide in the cracks!

Zhao Manyan was surprised when he saw the cracks were interconnected. It was like a complicated maze, and allowed him and Little Blue Kun to shake off the Sharkmen.

Certain parts were extremely narrow, leaving the bigger Sharkman Beasts stuck outside. Zhao Manyan was under much less pressure after the Sharkman Beasts stopped chasing them.

“Strange, why is it so bright down there? Shouldn’t it be dark?” Zhao Manyan was puzzled.

‘They swam deeper into the cracks and felt a strong heat in front of them. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhao Manyan looked below him and saw a red light spreading from the bottom, like the light of the sun as it was setting on the horizon.

‘The lake bottom was a huge pit nearly the size of the city far above. The spectacular light was wrapped around it like an oval curtain.

Zhao Manyan came down from the crack in the stone above and was shocked to see there was no water around them!

‘Asa matter of fact, the cracks above the opening were more like a floating lake flying above them. Its waters were pouring through the cracks. They looked like brown flying dragons diving to the ground.

However, the waterfalls turned into colorful mists and soon returned to the cracks above. The light Zhao Manyan had seen at first was produced by refraction from those mists.

“Holy crap, did I fall into a wormhole which sent me into space?” Zhao Manyan blurted out in shock.

The sight was utterly shocking. It was like stumbling into a scorching sun while floating around in a dark universe. Even the biggest creature was as tiny as a speck of dust when compared to it!

“Old Zhao, stop running. Come back to us, we have something important to do,” Mo Fan’s voice suddenly came from his com.

Zhao Manyan eventually collected his thoughts and looked at the device with a puzzled face.

The communication device had not worked in the lake. Why would it be working now? Was it because of the magnetic field? It did not make any sense!

“I think I’m lost. Can you come and pick me up?” Zhao Manyan had to ask.

“What can you see around you?”

“Asun.”

“sun my f**king ass, enough with your lame jokes!” Mo Fan scolded him.

“Tm not joking. There’s really a huge sun here. It’s enormous. It’s spitting out fire too!” Zhao Manyan insisted.

“Holy crap, you found the Earth Pistil!” Mo Fan yelled.

“What Earth Pistil? How is it so big?”

“Don’t move, we’ll be there right away!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“Hurry up, I’m scared.”

‘The strange thing was, Zhao Manyan’s device did not have any signal before he found the Earth Pistil. His badge had been completely dark.

But now, the signal was strong and clear. Mo Fan could even pinpoint Zhao Manyan’s location through the badge.

They could not explain why there was a signal underground. Mo Fan could not be bothered finding out the truth, either. He simply followed the signal into the cracks.

Many Sharkmen were roaming through the cracks. The rocks, holes, and ravines were perfect for hiding. The group was able to avoid the Sharkmen with Xinxia’s Psychic Element and sneak past them.

The signal was gone by the time they reached the cracks. They simply followed what Zhao Manyan told them and ventured deeper.

They finally reached the depth where the water was being held back by the red light. Mo Fan could see a tiny blue dot floating there, completely clueless about what to do, on the other side.

“There’s Old Zhao!” Mo Fan pointed toward the dot.

The location of the Earth Pistil was quite astounding. The whole place felt unreal, as everything was blazing red. They also felt minuscule, as if they were going to melt at any second.

“You guys are finally here. I almost thought I was in Hell!” Zhao Manyan felt like crying in relief.

The place had completely overturned their understanding of the world. They had an urge to simply deny what they were seeing. It felt like everything they knew was being devoured by the sight before them!

“It’s very different from the Earth Pistil we saw in the desert,” Mo Fan told Lingling over the com.

“The Earth Pistil in the desert was depleting, but this one is still full of energy; of course they are different! The Sharkmen are cold-blooded, and they can’t endure the heat of the Earth Pistil. They can only stay in the cracks above it

“That’s true. I don’t see a single Sharkman here,” Mo Fan confirmed.

“Can we even bring this thing back?” Mu Bai asked wryly.

“I’s going to be tricky. We didn’t bring any equipment. We can only mark down the location and let the military take over,” Mo Fan sighed.

They clearly could not move the Earth Flame Pistil. It would take a group of professionals to get rid of the flames on its surface, lower its temperature, and retrieve its core.

“The Sharkmen already know we are here, and they are eying the Earth Flame Pistil, too. By the time the military arrives, this place will be heavily guarded by the Sharkmen. They would have to fight the Sharkmen for the Earth Pistil. I don’t think it’s worth the risk,” Jiang Shaoxu shook her head.

“She’s right. Either way, you won’t be taking the Earth Pistil...” Guan Songdi, who had been a coward throughout the journey, suddenly spoke up. He had been following them around like he was transparent, but his expression had now changed. He was sporting an eerie grin.

Mo Fan looked at the man calmly.

“My men are in position. On behalf of the Northern Sacred Bears, I thank you for finding the Earth Flame Pistil for us!” Guan Songdi said..
