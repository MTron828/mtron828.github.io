The brown desert was vast and boundless, with dry and scorching heat, but it was chilly and biting cold at night.

It was rare to find an oasis in the desert, let alone modern, shiny, and luxurious cities!

The cities did not need any green, as there was gold everywhere. It had always been like this for the ancient caliphates. Tiny gold particles were piled up like sand dunes and flowing like rivers. They were vivid and prosperous without the decoration of green plants!

It was a silver city in a world of gold.

The Asia Magic Association was located in the city. The tall silver tower was like a fine ancient sword piercing through the blue clouds. A wing of Black Sand Eagles was patrolling in the sky and circling the tower in orderly formation.

Dubai was a city with lots of rules, but not many restrictions.

Unlike most cities of other countries, flying was permitted inside the city. Mages could freely fly around Dubai on their astonishing mounts while enjoying the admiration of the people below them.

People of high status enjoyed great privileges. They did not have to put up fake fronts and act modestly in front of others. They could show their disdain to anyone they pleased.

After the clans of dragon tamers in England popularized the flying dragons, Dubai was the first city to have an army of flying dragons.

Not only did they sign a contract to secure ninety percent of the production, they were also buying flying dragons off other people’s hands at high prices. It was common to see a troop of Mages circling the city on their flying dragons. These people dressed in black armor were the dedicated Dragon Rider Mages of the royal family.

“HAHA, my Chesnaught can easily shake off the rest of you within several thousand meters with his speed. Let’s return to the tower from the city’s outskirts. The first one to arrive will take everyone’s pay for the week. What do you all think?” a man with a mustache with a smile proposed.

“Captain, we shouldn’t neglect our duties.”

“Why are you so worried? Does anyone dare to cause trouble right under the nose of the Asia Magic Association? Besides, did you forget who I am? I’ll take full responsibility if anything happens. Let’s race, on the count of three...”

The man whipped the back of his flying dragon after he only counted two. The flying dragon cried and beat its wings, flying straight at the tower. The strong winds left along its trail disrupted the formation of the rest of the flying dragons.

“That’s cheating. Quick, chase after him. I don’t want to spend my next week holed up in the alleys!”

The alleys were nowhere as exciting as staying in a five-star hotel with a beautiful woman and enjoying a bottle of wine together on a perfectly white bed in front of delicate French windows.

Several flying dragons sprang forward. The people who were unaware of what was going on thought the Mages were conducting a special drill.

The captain was sneering cunningly in front of his men.

No flying dragon could be quicker than his Chesnaught. He was going to take all their pay for the week. A famous singer with slender, gorgeous legs happened to be waiting for him, as long as he could pay the huge sum to spend a night with her.

The wind started blowing fiercely. A creature with white air flowing around it appeared out of nowhere in the blue sky.

It was beating its wings elegantly as it overtook the troop of flying dragons with ease, gradually catching up to the captain at the front.

The captain was dumbfounded. He immediately whipped his flying dragon with even greater force.

“Go, speed up, beat your wings!” the captain scolded it.

Chesnaught was already flying at full speed. His skin was starting to crack from the effort he was putting forth, but the other creature still overtook him with ease.

Chesnaught could only stare at the creature’s tail. Most importantly, the trail of wind it left behind was sweeping right in his face. It was the same as eating the smoke coming out of another car’s exhaust.

It was a flying dragon too, but how was it faster than his own? It was even smaller than his flying dragon!

“Damn it, just you wait!” the captain yelled after it in frustration.

No matter how angry he was, he had no chance of catching up to the Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon. It was like trying to catch up to a motorbike on a bicycle. It was no use, even if he stepped on the pedals until the chain broke!

Mo Fan looked back at the man who was clenching his teeth with a puzzled face. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Are they from the Dubai Magician Tower?” Mo Fan murmured. He did not pay too much attention to the dragon riders.

Dubai Mages were similar to the Mages from the Sacred Hall of Liberty. They directly took orders from the Continental Magic Associations, giving them a superior status.

However, Mo Fan had already learned Dubai had no restrictions on riding mounts and or Summoned Beasts in the city. He flew straight into the silver city.

Mo Fan did not go anywhere else, heading straight to the tower.

He went straight to the hundred-and-twentieth floor. There was a pristine white meeting hall meeting. A round table with Asians seated about it was inside the meeting hall. An old man with a white beard sat in the leading spot.

Mo Fan recognized the man. He was Zu Huanyao, Zhan Kong’s grandfather.

He was working at the Dubai Magician Tower, one of the few Councilmen who had the right to speak in the meeting hall of the Asia Magic Association.

The Councilmen of the Asia Magic Association had extraordinary statuses!

Mo Fan barged straight into the room. Zu Huanyao had never seen Mo Fan before, but he recognized him at first glance.

“What do you want, Mo Fan? Do you have any idea what place this is?” Zu Huanyao snarled.

He was having a meeting with his peers, but Mo Fan had barged into the room without telling them. Who gave him the guts to run amok outside of China?

“I have something to ask you, you old prick!” Mo Fan headed straight toward Zu Huanyao.

“What...what did you say?” Zu Huanyao rose to his feet. A powerful Aura burst out of his body, feeling like it was going to destroy everything around him.

“You can’t even protect our own people! Aren’t you the Minister of Foreign Affairs for China? Do you keep making mistakes because you are too old for the job? You should retire and let someone who is more competent replace you!” Mo Fan pointed at Zu Huanyao, swearing at him.

The people in the room were dumbfounded. Even Chairman Shao Zheng would not dare to speak like that to the man!

Was this young man out of his mind?

“What the Hell do you know? Leave at once, or I’m going to arrest you on the spot!” Zu Huanyao roared.

“Go ahead and try it. I should have kicked your ass into a coffin in the Sacred City!” Mo Fan spat.

It was time to settle both the old and the new debts!

If the old man had not willfully stuck to his decision, the Chief Military Instructor and Qin Yu’er would not have died in the Sacred City.

Such a stubborn, ignorant, and stupid old man!
