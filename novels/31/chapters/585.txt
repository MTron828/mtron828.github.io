A great bunch of lightning forked out into their surroundings. As the thickest Lightning Strike among them landed on its target, the lightning forks spread more vigorously in the air, forking into more branches and further strengthening the effects of the attack!

As a result, the Lightning Strike blasted a hole through the Corpse General’s body. The flesh under the gray-white winding sheets was scorched black. Half of its shoulder was gone.

The Cloth-wrapped Corpse General was indeed different from the Giant Corpse General, which had a body like an ox. When Mo Fan was fighting against the Giant Corpse General, even his third-tier Lightning Strikes were ineffective against it. Meanwhile, it turned out that even though the Cloth-wrapped Corpse General was shockingly fast, it was not too difficult to kill it after restricting its movements.

The Cloth-wrapped Corpse General did not seem harmed after suffering the damage. Its eyes emitted a crimson glow as its body began to spin rapidly on the same spot...

It continued to spin at a faster speed, turning itself into a metallic drill, digging into the ground...

The Forest of Kun did not have roots under the ground. Even if there were roots produced by the spell, they were fairly fragile. As such, if the target was capable of digging into the ground, the Forest of Kun would lose its effectiveness.

Soon, the new hole was the only thing left in the Forest of Kun. The Corpse General had disappeared without a single trace.

“Damn it, we let it run away!” said Scar Face furiously.

“Isn’t that good news for us? We can now regroup with the army. It feels like they have already gone far away,” Shorty turned around and glanced at the army advancing into the distance.

Yu Qingsu was not too satisfied with the outcome. If she knew the creature was capable of digging into the ground, she would have tied it up with vines first. The Cloth-wrapped Corpse General was a fairly rare kind she had never encountered before, with many unexpected capabilities. If she were able to secure its undead crystal, it would improve her ranking!

A soft, strange sound came from behind Scar Face, like someone was stepping on ice.

“Did any of you hear...”

Shorty was just about to speak when the ground half-frozen by Scar Face suddenly cracked open. Two winding sheets lunged out from the gap suddenly!

The winding sheets flew at Scar Face. They intertwined and instantly wrapped around the man’s throat. However, the big man was able to react quickly. His figure was covered in light the moment he was ambushed.

The light brown glow rapidly transformed into plate armor, turning him into a brown-armored knight.

However, the winding sheets were not intended to inflict any damage to begin with. Even though Scar Face was protected by the armor, he was still dragged away by the winding sheets around his neck.

While everyone was still reacting, Scar Face had already been dragged over ten meters away, into a yawning tomb that none of them was even aware of in the first place!

“Save him, save him quick!” Yu Qingsu panicked. She immediately chased after Scar Face.

Unfortunately, Yu Qingsu did not have any movement spells. She had no chance of catching up to Scar Face, who was being dragged away rapidly.

The whole sequence had only lasted a second. Both Mo Fan and Shorty had no clue what spell they could cast to save the man.

“He was dragged into the cave. How are we going to save him? Are you implying that we should all jump into it?” Shorty went up to the cave, and discovered that it was completely dark inside.

Vision was not their true concern, but the cave seemed to be extremely narrow. Magicians who were most vulnerable when their enemies were within melee range; if they did not have defensive spells like turtle shells to protect them, they would simply be overwhelmed by mere zombies pouncing at them!

“If you two aren’t going, I’ll go myself!” Yu Qingsu clenched her teeth and jumped into the cave.

Mo Fan and Shorty were left wide-eyed at the entrance. They had no clue what was down there at all. Wasn’t it simply committing suicide jumping down like that?

“What should we do? Are we going down too?” Shorty looked at Mo Fan, unable to make a decision.

“What choice do we have, let’s go down and save them... little Flame Belle, come out!” yelled Mo Fan.

Mo Fan began to cast the Intermediate Star Pattern of the Summoning Element, yet when he was only halfway drawing the Star Pattern, the little Flame Belle had already come out herself, extending her fist into the sky, as if she had come out to save the world.

Mo Fan felt a surge of disgust. He should not have let her watch Ultraman. His Contracted Beast was now suffering from eighth-grader syndrome!

Shorty was completely shocked at her display.

He was not stunned after witnessing Mo Fan’s third Element, as those who kept an eye on the rankings surely knew that Mo Fan, who was ranked fifth on the Innate Talent Leaderboard, had three Elements. The problem was, how the Hell did Mo Fan’s Contracted Beast come out when he had only drawn half of the Star Pattern?

It didn’t make any sense!

“The creature most likely has a lineage related to the Space Element, so she can come and go as she pleases,” explained Mo Fan helplessly.

“Oh, I see... I’m not too fond of going down there. I’m afraid that I won’t have the chance to see my son who’s going to be born soon,” Shorty expressed his real thoughts.

“Cut the bullshit!’ Mo Fan did not give Shorty any chance to complain. He lifted Shorty up and asked Flame Belle to light the path ahead, before jumping into the cave after taking a deep breath.

“Don’t...don’t do it...”

Shorty was too tiny compared to Mo Fan, who was simply a wild man, dragging Shorty with him into the cave.

The path was straight, more like a well instead of a cave. The place was not covered with soil, but rotting bricks from ancient times. It seemed like someone did build the tomb here in the past!

“Crap, how are we not at the bottom yet!” Shorty was already screaming like a sissy as they fell endlessly in complete darkness.

Little Flame Belle was right below them. The fire erupting from her body was lighting the path, yet there was still no sign of the bottom.

Finally, a chamber came into sight. Mo Fan squatted slightly as he landed, trying to provide some cushion for the impact.

Shorty was not as comfortable as Mo Fan, whose legs were numb from the landing. He immediately cursed t in pain.

“Where’s Yu Qingsu?” Mo Fan scanned their surroundings, but found no trace of Qing Lajiao.

“I bet she was dragged away, too. It’s not difficult to try and kill the Cloth-wrapped Corpse General on the surface, but now that we’re in its territory, we’re most likely doomed!” said Shorty, who had been incredibly unwilling to come down here.

“I thought we were going to see undead everywhere down here. In fact, it’s quite spacious!” Mo Fan used the light emitted by Flame Belle, the moving light bulb, to check his surroundings.
