Mo Fan took a quick glance at the prisoners who were approaching him. “Are they still coming to seek their deaths? Little Flame Belle, teach them a lesson on my behalf!”

As soon as Mo Fan Summoned Little Flame Belle, a blinding light descended from the sky like the rise of a phoenix. The little porcelain doll instantly transformed into an imperious empress.

Her long hair was like a blazing red waterfall. She was also draped in a cloak formed with burning petals. Her smooth skin was brimming with scorching heat.

Flame Belle Empress was able to walk freely in the air. She hovered between two Super Level prisoners.

The two mind-controlled Mages had an urge to betray their master after seeing her terrifying flames.

Flame Belle Empress was a real Ruler-level creature. Mages who had yet to achieve the peak of Super Level were like little kids in front of a Ruler-level creature. They would only stand a chance by attacking as a group, and these prisoners were no longer at their full strength after being in captivity for a long time.

Only two Super Mages? They were not even enough for Flame Belle Empress’ warm-up!

Mo Fan knew the huge fuss he created must have gotten Lu Kun’s attention.

The Evil Red Orb must have been in Prison Mountain for some years. It had absorbed a huge amount of soul energy and was close to establishing its own faction.

To the others, it was a devil that could take over a human’s body at anytime, but in Mo Fan’s eyes, it was a mature flat peach that would only be born once every thousand years. It was the best time to eat it!

The Evil Red Orb was embedded at the top of the watchtower. It wanted to grow a pair of legs and run away when it saw the greed in Mo Fan’s eyes.

Don’t come any closer!

I’ll call the cops if you do!

Mo Fan could not care less about the Evil Orb’s desires. Lu Kun had been nurturing such a valuable thing in Prison Mountain. He did not mind reaping the harvest!

Others would be wary of being devoured and taken over by the Evil Orb, but Mo Fan was not scared at all.

To be frank, the Essence Orb he was carrying on his waist was actually the Evil Red Orb’s father!

The Essence Orb began to devour the Evil Orb.

It was absorbing the energy of the prisoners the Evil Orb had gathered from their hatred, as well as its own energy that it had nurtured after staying in the prison’s environment over a long time.

The Essence Orb was taking huge bites at a time now.

Mo Fan could feel the energy that he had consumed in his demon form was replenished in just a few seconds. He felt even more confident.

The red Aura circling the Evil Orb began to dissipate, and its color was changing gradually.

It eventually reverted to a lifeless and dull gray Orb.

“It looks like there’s some residue left.” Mo Fan noticed his Essence Orb was already full. A few wisps of red energy were still circling the Essence Orb, like a bunch of orphans with nowhere to go.

This was a little troublesome.

First of all, the energy of an Evil Orb would not dissipate on its own. The leaked energy of an Evil Orb had caused a plague in Croatia, resulting in a huge panic.

Second, Little Loach was reluctant to absorb this not-so-pure energy. It was a Soul Container with mysophobia!

Mo Fan was still feeling troubled when the red energy began to flow toward his Space Bracelet.

It felt like something else was absorbing it!

Mo Fan was puzzled. He opened the Space Bracelet and noticed the semi-manufactured Universe Vein he had received as the deposit for this job was absorbing the residual energy!

A semi-manufactured Universe Vein was like a half-filled core. The Universe Vein rapidly evolved after absorbing the energy leaking out from the Essence Orb!

“Oh my, is it going to evolve into a complete Universe Vein?” Mo Fan was overjoyed.

The difference between a semi-manufactured Universe Vein and a complete Universe Vein was incredibly huge. Mo Fan could feel his remaining Elements stuck in the Advanced Level were about to break through their limits as the semi-manufactured Universe Vein was absorbing the energy!

“It is high quality, too!” Mo Fan blurted out in joy.

He had obtained a complete Universe Vein prior to finishing his job!

Mo Fan did not expect the Evil Red Orb to possess so much energy. It had somehow given him a complete Universe Vein. He would soon have a fourth Super Element!

In an abandoned building on the outskirts of Magic City, a man in a red shirt stood on the edge of its roof with a long list in his hand.

“Are you sure the government won’t notice them if they go missing?” Lu Kun asked.

An old man in a tuxedo behind him smiled. His teeth had an icy glow in the dark.

“There are too many towns and villages around the Magic City after it was promoted to a headquarters city. No matter how careful the officials are, they won’t be able to keep track of everyone and settle them down. Some people might have gone missing after they were relocated to the headquarters city. It’s not so easy to track them down now,” the old man replied in his deep voice.

“Very well… Prison Mountain has almost reached its full capacity. We’ll transfer these people to our new place,” Lu Kun agreed.

“Your fruit is already mature, isn’t it? Once you absorb it, I believe the old Senior Hunters of this country will no longer pose a threat to you,” the old man noted.

“It’s true that I no longer have to be wary of them.”

“Does that mean we can proceed with our plan more blatantly? We have been so cautious over these years. I almost have a feeling I’ve become a human. I so wish we could hunt our prey, drink human blood, and collect hatred freely, turning this city into a capital of sin. Even the air would be rich and mellow, like red wine. The Hunters would be shivering in fear as we rule over them. The living humans will be given to us as offerings and slaves!” The old man was overwhelmed with excitement.

During the Dark Age in Europe, when the land was crawling with darkness and the soil was covered with fresh blood, the vampires were able to live in their castles with thousands of servants.

Hunters? They were just wild animals that could put up a slight resistance!

But now, the mutant races could only live in the sewers. They had to act like thieves just to steal some blood to drink.

Most annoyingly, when the old man was walking in a dark alley, the women always assumed he was a pervert stalker.

Those assh****! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He was planning to bite their necks and drink their flesh blood, which might end up taking their lives. He was not a mere pervert who was lusting over their booties!

He recalled how the pedestrians always carried plenty of crosses on them when they were out on the streets at night in Europe.

Humph, look at the people nowadays… They have lost their basic fear and respect of the Blood Tribe!

It is the worst era of mankind!

“Have some patience, now isn’t the time for it yet.” Lu Kun was being more cautious.

The invasion of sea monsters was going to bring more chaos to human society. It would create a great environment for them to feed in.

They had to take their time.

He was planning to nurture a few more fruits, similar to the one in Prison Mountain.

It was not late to create their own world once they grew stronger!
