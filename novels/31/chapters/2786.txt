Chapter 2787: Leaving No Way Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Night Rakshasa knew where Commander Hua might be. But the main thing right now was not the reunion with Commander Hua but to find the Healing Scroll.

They had to heal Commander Hua. After all, Hawaii was full of the Ocean Demons spies, including humans who might have become their puppets. If they acted recklessly, Commander Hua may die even if they found him.

“That’s impossible…” Pang Lai awakened. He coughed and choked. He was too anxious to stay calm.

Song Feiyao handed him some herbs to chew on. It helped with his coughing. He disagreed with Night Rakshasa and Jiang Yu.

“Do you think Jiang Yu is just worrying for nothing?” asked Mo Fan.

“Yes! A Forbidden Mage performed spiritual cleansing on each and every one of us before departure. If any of us were being used as a puppet, he would have found out.Although he cannot use his magic power on a large scale, he can accurately identify the culprit within a small team. None of us are under the Godly Horde Prophet’s manipulation,” Pang Lai said firmly.

Mo Fan inevitably turned to Apas. Apas knew what Mo Fan was going to ask.

“It’s true that humans can find out the puppets who are under the Godly Horde Prophet’s manipulation using the Forbidden Curse. It’s like how I can identify the puppets if you let me interrogate them spiritually.”

Mo Fan did not have a good understanding about spiritual magical power. If what Apas said was true, then what had gone wrong?

Pang Lai confirmed that there were no puppets among them. But Jiang Yu seemed to think otherwise.

‘Was there anything wrong with either Pang Lai or Jiang Yu?’ Mo Fan shook his head to dismiss the thought.

The probability of either of them becoming a suspicious target was low. Jiang Yu and Night Rakshasa had found Commander Hua. If Jiang Yu was a puppet, he could have just delivered the message to the Ocean Demons. There was no need for him to go to extra lengths to inform them and take precautions like this.

......

As for Pang Lai, if he was a puppet, he would have stopped the Eight-headed Serpent from killing them. If Mo Fan had not returned for him, Pang Lai would have sacrificed himself to save the others.Besides, Jiang Yu had specially asked Night Rakshasa to inform them about the truth. Jiang Yu trusted Pang Lai. Both had proven themselves to be loyal.

“Are there any puppets within us?” Mo Fan did not know how to make a decision.

Song Feiyao looked at Pang Lai and then at Mo Fan. “Why must you assume there are puppets among us?”

“Do you also think that Jiang Yu is just worried about nothing?” asked Mo Fan.

“Jiang Yu is usually an idiot. I wonder why he is spewing nonsense at this time. But it was good of him to inform us secretly through Night Rakshasa. Otherwise, our team spirit would be affected. If that happens, how will we ever save Commander Hua?” Pang Lai said sulkily.

Pang Lai was not an idiot. He was the Chief Royal Guard. He had witnessed a lot of deceit in his time,

There was a strict requirement in the selection of a Royal Mage. After someone was selected to hold the position, that person had a very low probability of being manipulated by the Godly Horde Prophet.

Also, Pang Lai had taken into consideration whether there were any Godly Horde Prophet’s puppets within his team even before they began their journey. He had baptized their spirits before departure.

The Forbidden Mage could not possibly be the one who had been manipulated by the Godly Horde Prophet. If there were so many of the authorities under the Godly Horde Prophet’s manipulation, Ocean Demons would have defeated humans long ago, and humans could not have fought and held out for so long.

“Old Pang, let us listen to what Song Feiyao has to say. She is an outsider. She might have a more unbiased perspective and actually know something that we might have overlooked,” said Mo Fan.

Pang Lai nodded.

“Not everyone stays the same forever. While it may be true that none of your teammates are under the Godly Horde Prophet’s manipulation, this doesn’t mean one cannot collude with the Ocean Demons of one’s own free will. People always betray each other for various reasons like fear, greed, and so on.”

Mo Fan and Pang Lai were speechless. She was right. Why must they assume that someone in their team was Godly Horde Prophet’s puppets? Maybe that person had willingly sided with the Ocean Demons to betray them. That was even worse…

After all, the puppets were under theGodly Horde Prophet’s control and carried out things without their own willingness. Traitors, on the other hand, were not under anyone’s control. They did it willingly. It could be even more damaging.

Pang Lai was silent for a long time. He had overlooked such detail due to his own stubbornness.

“If I were that person who willingly turned a spy, I would first use my teammates to find Commander Hua’s location. I would then inform the Ocean Demons about it. Secondly, I would try to sabotage the team’s mission so that Commander Hua is isolated and can be killed,” said Song Feiyao.

“So, the Ocean Demons weren’t the ones who set us up with that glove,” said Pang Lai, realization finally dawning in his face.

“Right. It’s true that the glove belonged to Commander Hua. There’s a high possibility that he left behind his glove to confuse the Ocean Demons,” said Mo Fan.

“So, the traitor was disappointed when Night Rakshasa found Commander Hua’s glove. And he or she informed the Ocean Demons and let them surround the mountain valley to destroy our team, correct?” Pang Lai continued.

“If that’s the case, they are constantly under the Ocean Demons’ control. Night Rakshasa, Jiang Yu…” Mo Fan said.

Night Rakshasa sensed something and immediately rushed back to where it came from. Jiang Yu and the team were in danger!

Even though they had escaped into the dense tropical rainforest, if the traitor was around, the Ocean Demons could locate them anytime!

The traitor no longer expected the Royal Mages to locate Commander Hua, so he might have decided to kill everyone!

“Idiot! He’s an idiot! How can he let Night Rakshasa leave him alone! Stupid!” Pang Lai helped himself up shakily. He cursed at Jiang Yu while wiping at his tears.

Jiang Yu noticed the presence of the traitor when they escaped to the rainforest.

He knew that death awaited him.

Yet he had asked Night Rakshasa to inform Mo Fan and Pang Lai so that they could continue the mission.

He, however, exposed himself to the Ocean Demon troop.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
