Time gradually passed. Mo Fan was doing his best to recover his strength, especially after he saw how strong the enemy pieces were. He realized the game was not as simple as he had thought.

People were now walking out of the black forest behind him.

They also stepped onto the chessboard, but their situation was different from Mo Fan. Most of them were being moved to the tiles where the pawns were.

It seemed like the new people were all Mages.

Su Lu had summoned the river of darkness close to the Asia Magic Association, so there was a higher ratio of Mages than would be normal.

It was also obvious that the people who were not Mages had almost zero chance of walking out of the black forest, unless they were extremely lucky.

The black forest was a filter for travelers who were fit for battle. Those travelers all became pawns in the game of chess.

Each pawn was made up of over a thousand people.

Eight pawns meant there were nearly ten thousand travelers altogether, forming a wall of humans across the chessboard, facing more than a hundred Dreadful Curse Cerberi.

Even though the humans had the numbers advantage, it did not convince Mo Fan that the two sides were equally matched.

The travelers were not equally strong. Mo Fan did notice something unusual. The travelers were not only the residents in Dubai City who were caught up in Su Lu’s river of darkness. There were people from other places across the world. They had somehow ended up in the Dark Plane, too!

There were knowledgeable people among those who had become pawns. They immediately told the rules of chess to the others so they could make it out alive together.

The people were confused at first, but they soon began discussing their tactics against the Dreadful Curse Cerberi. They were all strangers who had fallen into Hell, but they were oddly united.

Someone eventually noticed Mo Fan. “Why is that man alone on a tile?”

The tiles were extremely huge, around the size of ten soccer fields, so the fact that Mo Fan was alone on a tile had caught the others’ attention.

“There’s no one else?”

“It’s real, he’s alone!”

“He’s the bishop?”

“This is unfair. We need a thousand people just to be assigned as a pawn. Why was he assigned to be a bishop all by himself? Is he reliable?”

The people started talking about Mo Fan, but they were respectful to him, too.

If a single man had been made the bishop, he must have the strength to fight thousands of enemies by himself!

A single-eyed old man walked to the edge of his tile and told Mo Fan, “Kid, do you know that different pieces have different types of movement? We are the pawns, so we can only move forward and fight the Dreadful Curse Cerberi!”

“I know, but who’s going to control us?” Mo Fan asked.

“The Lord of Darkness, obviously,” the old man said.

“Something still doesn’t make sense,” Mo Fan shook his head.

“Let’s try our best in order to make it out alive,” the old man could only sigh.

Mo Fan did not respond. He pointed at the enemy side instead.

A new piece had appeared on the enemy side, corresponding to Mo Fan’s tile. In other words, it was an enemy bishop!

It had a red body with smooth scales. The Dreadful Curse Cerberi only reached its legs, which were as sharp as scythes.

A Crimson Scorpion Medusa! It was the strongest species in Egypt!

The travelers gasped when they saw the enemy bishop was a Crimson Scorpion Medusa.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusae were only a level lower than the Scorpion Lord Medusae. They were capable of destroying an entire city in Egypt!

The old man looked at the hideous Crimson Scorpion Medusa. His legs were trembling after he sensed its cruel and ferocious Aura. Meanwhile, the bishop on his side was only a young man!

How could the strength of the two sides differ by so much if they were playing a game of chess?

The old man let out a sigh. The rest of the people who were pawns were crying in despair too.

Hundreds of Dreadful Curse Cerberi, and Eight Dark Swordmasters!

It felt like they were heading straight to death before the board was even filled with pieces.

“Almighty Lord of Darkness, please give us some powerful pieces too!” many people started begging.

No one assumed they could take it easy after coming here. They did not mind fighting their way to survival. All they asked for was a little glimpse of hope.

The difference in strength between the two sides was simply too huge!

However, it might be acceptable if their rooks, queen, and king were something stronger.

The other enemy bishop soon appeared. It was a white spider with huge poisonous glands and slender legs!

There were rumors about these White Widows in places that were marked as black zones, but people were not familiar with them, as most people who encountered them ended up as lunch in dark caves full of spider silk.

A Medusa and a White Widow. They were the two bishops on the enemy side!

Mo Fan subconsciously looked to his right. He wanted to know who the other bishop on his side was.

It was most likely a powerful human Mage. The person had either been caught by the river of darkness, or he had long been stuck in the Dark Plane.

It was indeed a man. He was dressed in a ragged shirt, and his hair was long enough to be tied up. He had a European face and a pointy nose.

“It seems like my only way out is to take part in this game...” The long-haired European seemed a little haggard. He turned to Mo Fan after noticing his gaze.

There were several tiles between them, but they had no trouble talking to one another.

“Hey, kid, can you tell me why the Dark Plane is lively all of a sudden? Did they steal something that belonged to an Elder of the Shadow Tribe, like me?” the man asked.

“The Chairman of Asia Magic Association committed a suicidal act and dragged everyone here with an evil spell,” Mo Fan explained.

“Is that possible?… but it’s fine. The Lord of Darkness will have an enjoyable time with so many people here. We have a chance to leave this place as long as he’s happy,” the European answered.

Another red light appeared between Mo Fan and the European, catching both of their attention. They were looking at the tile that belonged to the queen!
