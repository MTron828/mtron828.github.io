Zhao Manyan was so mad that he was about to explode when the guests were brought to Snow Moon Castle.

The Alps Institute was treating the Pearl Institute like they were a bunch of relatives in need. Not only did the people of the Alps Institute dislike them, they had to obey some unreasonable rules, too! Meanwhile, the Alps Institute was treating the Casas like their ancestors. They did not think too much about how the Alps Institute had treated them, but they were very displeased after seeing the different level of treatment!

“The guy is the successor of the most powerful renowned clan in Europe. He’s even accompanied by Prince Beny. Why can’t you recognize the difference between you and him? Why would you even think you are being mistreated?” Shi Junsheng said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Man, you must be a slave in your previous life! Our Pearl Institute is the second most reputable school in China, and we even came in first in the World College Tournament. There’s no way our status is lower than a renowned clan! Aren’t you ashamed to speak for the others after what Headmistress Perry did to us? Don’t even say you are from the Pearl Institute, you’re nothing but a disgrace to us!” Zhao Manyan grunted in reply.

“Did I say anything wrong? Stop bringing up how you came in first in the World College Tournament. You might think of it as a glory, but it’s nothing worth mentioning in the eyes of the others. The Casas own the richest ore veins in Europe. They are in control of the magic resources for the entire continent!

“They are also one of the richest renowned clans. They have money, power, and influence. They can bring the Alps Institute huge funding with just a few words. What do you two have? You keep mentioning how you have come first in the World College Tournament, but what will they get in return from serving you nicely?” Shi Junsheng retorted.

“Shi Junsheng, I don’t agree with you. It’s fine if they want to build a relationship with the Casas by fawning upon them, but we are representing the Pearl Institute. They shouldn’t treat us like we are inferior to the others on formal occasions and in public. The magic bracelets, the meat, the arrangement of seats, and allocating Ceylan and Heidi, who are supposed to stay with us for the exchange, to the Casas without even notifying us...” Li Ximei could not stand it any further.

“Ximei is right, we might not be able to bring them any benefits, but since we are from a magic school in China, they have no reason to treat us like we are inferior to a renowned clan!” Professor Zheng said.

“Is it because Mo Fan offended their headmistress!?” Shi Junsheng wondered aloud.

“Professor Li, will beating up a person from the same school receive heavy punishment?” Mo Fan asked thinly.

“Of course, but only if someone sees it...” Professor Li said.

Shi Junsheng’s expression shifted. He was well aware of Mo Fan’s reputation in the school; he did not think twice of scolding a Councilman, beating the crap out of a government official, or students. He even dared to provoke the teachers! Professor Li clearly indicated that he was going to turn a blind eye to this.

Shi Junsheng no longer dared to sneer at them!

“That Herr Casa is pretty arrogant. What did he mean by there’s no need to introduce the others? It’s not like I’m interested in him either.” Mu Bai was quite proud. He could not stand the cynical remark.

“Herr Casa is the youngest Super Mage in Europe. You guys are young and restless. It’s fine to trouble Prince Beny, but I advise you to stay away from Herr Casa. Even the three of you together won’t be able to take him on,” Professor Zheng said seriously.

“Super...Super Level?” Zhao Manyan gasped.

“He doesn’t look that much older than us. How is he a Super Mage already?” Mu Bai was stunned too.

That’s unbelievable! Wasn’t every Super Mage in the world at least forty years old!?

“Mo Fan, what are you thinking? Why didn’t you say anything? It’s rare to see you so quiet, knowing your temper. Don’t tell me you’re scared of that Headmistress Perry,” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Scared my ass, I have seen lots of things that are scarier than her. I was wondering who the culprit was. Why hasn’t she made a move in the past few days?” Mo Fan replied.

Mo Fan was not hoping to see someone fall victim to the culprit. However, the first act she made clearly indicated that she was not the kind that would vanish immediately once her plan worked out. If he did not find the culprit, Li Yu’e would remain the suspect!

She was quite fond of the place and was thinking of staying here for good. Mo Fan did not want the other students to keep pointing their fingers at her, nor did he want her to be isolated.

Since his thoughts were preoccupied with that matter, he was not that concerned with Herr Casa and Prince Beny.

—

The next day after breakfast, Prince Beny and Herr Casa suggested visiting the dueling ground. The others followed.

“Headmistress Perry, why don’t we set up a bet? You do know I have some resources in my hands. I believe it’s better to allocate it to the school that impresses me the most. I have brought two henchmen with me. If any of your students can defeat them, I will have more confidence in the Alps Institute’s strength,” Herr Casa said.

“I don’t really agree with the method, since it’s meant to be a charitable act. If you are willing to help us, I will gladly accept it on behalf of the students. If you aren’t willing to help, it only means the kids aren’t blessed enough... but, since the young duke is eager to see the Alps Institute’s strength, I have no reason to turn it down!” Headmistress Perry replied.

Herr Casa grinned. She had agreed to it in the end. Why did she even bother to talk so much in the first place?

The two henchmen of the Casas stepped forward. They were both quite young, most likely the elites in the clan. They would be considered great talents in most schools, but in the Casas, in front of the young Duke Herr Casa, they were just some henchmen.

“Don’t let me down, and don’t let Headmistress Perry down, either,’ Herr Casa said.

The two henchmen nodded. They stood still in silence, waiting for the Alps Institute to decide on their candidate.

“Isn’t the Pearl Institute here too? Since it’s a friendly duel, how could we leave the Pearl Institute out? Why don’t we have the Pearl Institute join in the bet, too?” Prince Beny said.

“We won’t be embarrassing ourselves,” Professor Zheng said modestly.

“Indeed, you guys were lucky to win the title. You are only going to come to grief against the powerful Alps Institute and the Casas,” Prince Beny added.

Mo Fan turned and looked at Prince Beny. “Are you trying to make the headlines again?”

Prince Beny was quite afraid of Mo Fan. The young man was nothing but a lunatic; there was nothing he did not dare to do!

“Humph, it’s meaningless to pick on someone who’s not a Mage. Why don’t you join the duel if you think you’re so good? If you win, we shall offer some resources for the new students of your Pearl Institute,” Prince Beny said.

Professor Li came up to Mo Fan while he was hesitating. He said softly, “Mo Fan, just play along and ask their Royal Spanish Naval Academy to organize an exchange with our school. Our Pearl Institute isn’t as impressive as the Royal Spanish Naval Academy when it comes to naval battles. Now that the shoreline is being invaded by the sea monsters, we really need their advanced tactics and their information about the sea monsters.”

“For the sake of our country?” Mo Fan said.

“Yes, beat the crap out of them for the sake of our country!” Professor Li agreed.

“...” Mo Fan was also displeased by Casas attitudes. As a member of the Pearl Institute, he could bully the students of his school recklessly and provoke his teachers, but he would not allow an outsider to do the same thing!

Besides, he was still holding a strong grudge against Headmistress Perry from the unfair treatment. He could settle both debts at the same time!

“Since both of you are having a bet, allow me to contribute to the pool, too. Since the Pearl Institute is currently ranked first in the world, I wouldn’t want to bully you guys. Both the Alps Institute and the Casas can send a strong representative. If the two of you can last for ten minutes by teaming up, consider it a win, and I’ll give you the champion badge of the World College Tournament,” Mo Fan said.

Everyone immediately put their attention on Mo Fan upon hearing his words.

Professor Li was given quite a fright too. His forehead broke out in a sweat. He blurted out softly, “I told you to earn some respect for us, not to stir up trouble!”

Clap! Clap! Clap!

Herr Casa applauded as if he was impressed by Mo Fan’s speech. He finally faced Mo Fan directly and said, “Now that’s how the winner of the World College Tournament should be. Since the resources are assigned for charitable acts every year as a way for our family to contribute to society, if you win the duel, I shall donate double the resources to your school.”

It was important for a renowned clan to maintain its public image, so the amount of resources they usually allocated for charity was fairly huge. It greatly exceeded the amount of resources that the renowned clans in China donated to the schools. How brilliant was it to get a foreigner to donate to their schools for the sake of his juniors, not to mention the donation would be done under his name!

“If you win, I shall double my donations too. I’m afraid that someone isn’t willing to give up their champion badge so easily, and the world is going to blame us for taking someone else’s beloved possession,” Prince Beny chimed in.

“You won’t have to double the donations. It’s fine if the Royal Spanish Naval Academy is willing to organize an exchange with our school,” Mo Fan said.

“That’s unfair, you are going to take benefits from both sides with just a single badge?”

“I have one with me, too,” Zhao Manyan promptly spoke up.

“Very well, the two badges are enough to be the stake.”

“What about the Alps?” Mo Fan asked.

“We aren’t a fan of this. You can add the stakes as you wish,” Headmistress Perry said.

“It’s fine if you don’t like betting, but if you lose, may I ask you to act more humbly when the students of the Pearl Institute are here for an exchange? You will not force them to wear the magic bracelets, and will prepare meat for them... don’t lose the duel and still think highly of yourself!” Mo Fan said to Headmistress Perry.

Headmistress Perry hated Mo Fan’s guts. How could she not be enraged by his words!?

“Humph, taking on two opponents at once, you’ve seriously overestimated your own capabilities. I wouldn’t dare to utter such nonsense if I were you,” Headmistress Perry said.

“Headmistress Perry, don’t worry about it. Isn’t it amusing to watch a clown putting up a show for us!?” Prince Beny said.

Herr Casa smiled too, amused at how naive and idiotic Mo Fan was. He would be impressed if Mo Fan could last for ten rounds against his henchman, let alone having to defeat both his opponents in less than ten minutes.

However, since the guy was so eager to earn some attention, he was more than willing to trample the guy fiercely!

1489 Fiery Tyrant!

“Do you seriously think you can take on us two at the same time? You might not even stand a chance against me alone,” Heidi walked past Mo Fan and looked at him in the eyes.

Mo Fan looked at Heidi and said with a smile, “I’m the kind of person that likes some attention! But don’t you worry, I never bother doing something that I can’t do.”

“Are you kidding me? Why would I be worried about you?” Heidi shot back coldly, and headed to the other side of the dueling ground.

Mo Fan stood in the center. In front of him was the Queen of Dimensions, Heidi. Her Dimensional Magic could clearly pose a great threat to him.

Heidi did not understand where Mo Fan had gotten the confidence to fight them both at the same time from. The Casas’ henchman was not just a mere decoration. Heidi could tell that the man’s strength was more or less on par with hers.

Perhaps some people were truly reckless enough to dare offend anyone and say any words as they pleased. Heidi strongly believed Mo Fan was going to get himself killed!

—

“Make sure you record it, it’s a battle for the dignity of our Pearl Institute,” Professor Zheng said to Shi Junsheng.

Shi Junsheng smacked his lips and murmured, “More like the battle of making a fool of himself. We already saw the fight between him and Heidi the other day, and now he has to worry about an expert from the Casas, too...”

“Just do as I say, what’s with all the nonsense!?” Professor Zheng harrumphed coldly with a displeased look.

Shi Junsheng quickly forced a smile. He glanced at Mo Fan and muttered something under his breath as he began to record...

—

Heidi was standing around a hundred and fifty meters in front of Mo Fan, while the Casas’ henchman was around a hundred and fifty meters behind him. Headmistress Perry was reluctant to waste any more time on the farce. She declared the start of the battle without giving them any time for preparations.

“I shall secure the advantage by striking preemptively!” Heidi did not want to fight the unfair battle, she just wanted to get it done as soon as possible. Her Sound Element broke the silence of the place and targeted Mo Fan’s mind directly. She did not want to give the man any chance to use his magic.

Sound Disturbance!

Even though it was only the Basic Spell of the Sound Element, it was extremely useful regardless of the target’s cultivation level. It disrupted the opponent’s tempo when channeling magic, securing a huge advantage for the caster!

Heidi was the first to strike, using her Sound Magic to disturb Mo Fan, making it difficult for him to use his magic.

Mo Fan stood still while the Sound Disturbance was making noise in his mind. He slowly closed his eyes, as if he was enjoying some music.

The Sound Disturbance was noisy, like the shrieks of demons or loud clanks and crashes. The target might even hear strange bewitching words, making it difficult to focus. It would severely slow down the target’s channeling speed and raise the difficulty of joining the Stars. It was different from the Psychic Element’s Psychic Impact, which aimed to break the connections between the Stars right away...

Mo Fan had to admit that Faerun Waterfall was indeed a very useful trial. It had improved Mo Fan’s resistance toward the Sound Element significantly, and together with the mental attack from Headmistress Perry, Mo Fan’s mental resistance had improved by a huge margin!

“Sound Disturbance of this level is no longer effective against me!” Mo Fan suddenly opened his eyes. They were oddly black; they even reflected a dark glow into Heidi’s eyes.

Heidi saw the calm look in Mo Fan’s eyes. She was quite surprised at how Mo Fan’s mental strength had improved by so much in just a few days.

“Giant’s Stomp!” Heidi made her move again. This time, she decisively used the Space Magic instead.

The Giant’s Stomp was a modification of the Space Element’s Intermediate Spell. An outline resembling the huge foot of a giant appeared above Mo Fan. Snow floating in the air outlined the force there!

The force suddenly descended heavily, like an invisible giant stomping his foot. The thin layer of snow covering the dueling ground collapsed and scattered instantly. Mo Fan seemed to remain at the same spot as the ground collapsed. Some of the people thought he had disappeared with the collapsed ground.

Heidi could not find Mo Fan, yet she heard something vibrating vigorously close to her while the temperature rose rapidly.

“You were controlling water during the last fight at the waterfall, so I wasn’t able to use my Fire Magic. This time, I shall let you witness the true strength of my Fire Element!” Mo Fan showed up twenty meters behind Heidi out of nowhere.

Heidi quickly turned around, her eyes emitting strong rays that stabbed at Mo Fan like thousands of swords.

It was a Will attack. Mo Fan’s Will was not strong enough to achieve such a feat. It was deadlier than many Advanced Spells!

Mo Fan seemed fearless. He roared loudly, “Break!”

Three different Soul-grade Flames appeared simultaneously around Mo Fan while the faint silhouette of Flame Belle Empress extended from his back, cloaking Mo Fan in a burning outfit, like an armored mantle. The Fire Magic in the area surged toward Mo Fan. The thin layer of snow within a kilometer instantly vaporized!

Three Soul-grade Flames meant three different Domains. When a Domain was strong enough, it could greatly suppress the opponent’s mind. A single Domain might not be strong enough to affect Heidi’s Will, but when three imperious Fire Domains were stacked on top of one another, it was strong enough to shatter even her Will!

Heidi immediately felt like she had fallen into a furnace as his burning roar struck. Her skin started to blister from the heat, while her blood dried up immediately.

Heidi was a little intimidated, and her Will weakened greatly. The swords that she had Summoned with her Will dissipated greatly. The remaining Will did land on Mo Fan, but it was nowhere enough to break through Mo Fan’s fierce flames.

“I can definitely use some practice!” Mo Fan shouted wildly.

The Meteor Scarlet had already taken form, meaning that Mo Fan was finally able to utilize the true strength of the three Soul-grade Flames. Mo Fan was not afraid of facing Mu Xumian, who was a Super Mage, back in the little town. Why would he be afraid of two peak Advanced Mages?

Even if they could pose a threat to a Super Mage by joining hands, Mo Fan would have no problem taking them on at once!

“Control!” Mo Fan clenched his fists. The brown Calamity Fire rose like a tiny but fierce volcano. Its flames spread across half the dueling ground.

The Calamity Fire gave Mo Fan an insane amount of control over the Fire Magic!

The Calamity Fire’s strength was five times that of normal fire. It might not be as violent as the Lightning Tyrant that was able to amplify the Lightning Element sixfold, or any other Soul-grade Flame with the same level of amplification as the Lightning Tyrant, but the Calamity Fire’s true strength was in its extraordinary control over Fire Magic. The magic particles were extremely obedient to its orders, making him able to cast Fire Spells in all forms!

Mo Fan’s control over the Fire Element and his ability to transform Fire Spells was comparable to a Super Mage when under the effects of the Calamity Fire while he was possessed by Flame Belle Empress. The Fire Magic would turn into soldiers fighting for their emperor, allowing Mo Fan to utilize the Fire Magic freely during a battle!

It was the greatest strength of the Calamity Fire!

“Feral Ardent!”

The Ardent Sunset was 4.5 times stronger than normal fire. Its damage amplification was normal among the Soul-grade Fire Seeds, but Mo Fan never thought the Ardent Sunset was weak, as its true strength was its ability to burn vigorously!

It was the bane of insect-type creatures. Not only would its flames set the shells and skins of an insect on fire immediately, the flames would continue to grow stronger as they burned!

When the coverage of the flames was twice its initial area, its damage would double, too!

Therefore, both the Sandstorm Demon Locusts and the Blue Moths were fuel to the Ardent Sunset when they clumped together. Their numbers only allowed the flames to spread further and quicker. When the Ardent Sunset was burning ten times, eleven times, twelve times, or stronger than normal fire, how could those disastrous insects that were so deadly in numbers possibly live for more than a second before it?

It was the nature of the Ardent Sunset, the ability to spread from a small portion of the sky toward the horizon. Mo Fan had yet to discover the limit of the Ardent Sunset’s strength!

“Meteor Spread!”

The last Domain was the Meteor Scarlet!

The Meteor Scarlet’s damage was 5.5 times that of ordinary fire. Its temperature was extremely high, and its damage was very close to Mo Fan’s Lightning Tyrant.

Since Mo Fan had claimed it when it was still a Primitive Soul-grade Flame, the Domain it refined and the effects of its flames were perfectly compatible with the Calamity Fire and the Ardent Sunset!

The longer its flames traveled, the greater their spread was. Both the Sky-Flame Funeral and Fiery Fist were projectiles, so their area would significantly increase during their flight, making it impossible to dodge them!

Obviously, if the three Soul-grade Flames were given to three different people, they were only slightly above average. They were not really that remarkable...

However, when the three Soul-grade Flames were gathered on the same person, it was terrifying for even Mo Fan to estimate the damage of his spell when the effects of the Soul-grade Flames were combined!

Imagine the Sky-Flame Funeral falling from high up in the sky. As the flames burned through the air, the spell’s initial coverage of two hundred meters square would eventually increase to four hundred meters square!

The bigger the coverage, the greater the damage of the spell under the effects of the three Soul-grade Flames, especially the Feral Ardent effect from the Ardent Sunset. A single casting of Sky-Flame Funeral could easily end up as a spectacular burning swamp once it landed on the ground!

Mo Fan had been spending a lot of time experimenting on how the three Soul-grade Flames could work together effectively. He had finally achieved some satisfying results lately. Why wouldn’t he let these people have a taste of the Fiery Tyrant?
