...

The thickets at the center island were now frozen. Thick frost covered the surface of the fragile plants, some even snapped from the weight of the ice!

Looking down from high up in the sky, a white ring was circling the islands. The area within the ring had turned snowy white, including frozen rocks, plants that had turned into ice statues, and frozen bodies of water!

The ice inside the ring grew thicker. The whole place was turning into a kingdom of ice. On top of that, the white ring was still expanding into the surroundings. The edges of the islands were gradually covered in frost, too.

A few birds on the islands could no longer withstand the cold. They beat their wings and began to flee.

The birds were feeling extremely unpleasant. It took them quite some time just to locate these warm islands, yet the sky started snowing all of a sudden. They were simply wondering if they had to move further south...

However, they were still beating their wings when a stronger icy force swept across them. Their bodies quickly stiffened and were covered in frost.

In the end, these little creatures became one with the frozen thickets, both frozen in the white drawing!

“Such an incredible control of the Ice Element,” exclaimed Ai Jiangtu, who was watching Mu Ningxue.

The others dropped their jaws too. The islands were freezing a lot faster than they had imagined. No wonder Mu Ningxue said that she alone was enough to handle it!

“The water is turning into ice. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan are stirring up quite a scene, I believe there are around fifty Scarlet Soaring Demons chasing after them,” said Nanyu.

“Mmm!” Ai Jiangtu nodded.

Ai Jiangtu purposely told the team to stay close to Mu Ningxue when the fight broke out.

The closer they were to Mu Ningxue, the stronger the ice energy. It would greatly suppress the Scarlet Soaring Demons’ Water Element capabilities, giving the Magicians an edge over the sea monsters in the upcoming fight.

The others had finished their preparations. They were ready to take on the Scarlet Soaring Demons.

The cries of Scarlet Soaring Demons arrived together with the breeze. A Scarlet Soaring Demon around five meters tall approached them from the direction of the nest.

It had discovered the Magicians’ existence and looked extremely furious. First of all, the Scarlet Soaring Demons would not allow anyone apart from their own species to trespass on their island. Second, these reckless humans dared to freeze their warm nest!

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were not fond of cold weather, especially at freezing temperatures. They preferred warm water and tropical maritime plants!

“They found us, prepare to fight!” said Ai Jiangtu. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“We’ve been waiting for this, allow me to take on this enormous Scarlet Soaring Demon!” Gong Yu’s clothes flapped wildly in the gust of wind that he unleashed. He reached the massive Scarlet Soaring Demon in the blink of an eye.

One could identify the Scarlet Soaring Demons’ strength based on their size. Those that were between three to four meters were weaker. However, those that were five meters were considered Giant Scarlet Soaring Demons. Both the sturdiness of their skin and the length of their claws was stronger than ordinary Scarlet Soaring Demons. Gong Yu was the first to engage the Scarlet Soaring Demon. It was obviously not as easy compared to the ones he faced before. He had barely inflicted some damage to the creature after some time.

The five-meter-tall Scarlet Soaring Demon was howling non-stop. It was obviously summoning its comrades.

Soon, more Scarlet Soaring Demons were heading toward them. These creatures were totally infuriated. They vented their anger on the ice by stomping on it with great force, trying to break it into pieces!

The creatures possessed a certain level of intelligence. They soon realized that Mu Ningxue was the one responsible for changing their islands’ condition. They immediately charged toward her madly...

Mu Ningxue was unable to protect herself while channeling the magic. However, the others would not let any Scarlet Soaring Demon get closer to Mu Ningxue. The fight broke out with Mu Ningxue at the center!

——

The wave was right on top of Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan’s heads. However, for some reason, pieces of ice were falling onto them instead of water.

Zhao Manyan turned around while sprinting and discovered that the tide had weakened.

Taking a closer look, it turned out that the area was already covered in frost. The sea had a thick layer of ice on its surface. The freezing energy had slowed down the pace of the rolling wave...

As they sprinted further ahead, they discovered that the wave was already falling behind. Soon enough, the wave had stopped, frozen like a piece of art. It was extremely shiny when the sunlight shone upon it.

“Is...is it frozen?” Zhao Manyan gaped in disbelief, staring at the scene behind him.

The massive wave was frozen in mid-curl into ice. It had stopped right in its tracks when it was just about to fall onto them.

Not only was the wave frozen, the islands, the water between the islands, and the plants on the island had all turned white as they were frozen and covered in frost. The warm islands had turned into frozen islands, on a frozen sea!

“Isn’t your big wife a bit too insane!” gasped Zhao Manyan.

“Yeah, this is quite crazy!” Mo Fan nodded slowly.

The efficiency of her Ice Magic took everyone by surprise. A huge part of the ocean and the annoying Sea Monkey Monsters were frozen. Was Mu Ningxue the reborn Ice Goddess? How did she freeze the water between the islands on her own?!

The ice on the surface of the ocean connected the four islands into a singly icy island. The Scarlet Soaring Demons were right in the middle of the islands, so it was trickier for them to get any access to the seawater.

The Scarlet Soaring Demons chasing after Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan seemed to have heard the summons of their leader. They stopped chasing after the two and headed toward Mu Ningxue and the others...

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were relieved. However, it did not mean they were done with their job. When they saw the Scarlet Soaring Demons heading to the center of the islands, they sneakily followed behind and harassed the creatures!

“It seems like they have to obey their superior’s order. They didn’t even bother turning around to kill us when we caught their comrades in the back. Hehe, it’s our turn to hunt them down!” Zhao Manyan grinned cunningly.

“Let me see if I can grab the one that’s over three meters tall,” Mo Fan followed behind the group of Scarlet Soaring Demon and used his Space Magic.

Basic Spell of the Space Element: Telekinesis!

Despite being a Basic Spell, Telekinesis was a rather complicated ability. Without mastering it, Mo Fan could at most bend a spoon, move a pencil or grab himself a cup of water. It would be completely useless in fights. However, if he became an expert in using it, he would be able to drive away, capture, and toss his target as he wished. just like Ai Jiangtu, making him invincible!
