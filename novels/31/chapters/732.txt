“The ice is breaking, watch out!”

“The seawater is no longer frozen. Damn it, these Scarlet Soaring Demons’ ability to control water is absolutely terrifying. Let’s back off a little!”

“To the island!”

The others not far away began to scream. Knowing that the situation was unfavorable to the team, Mu Ningxue glared at the shameless Mo Fan. She did not have time to punish the rascal for his mischievous act. She immediately closed her eyes to focus on the Spell.

Mu Ningxue was utterly furious. If she wasn’t busy spreading the energy of her domain to the islands, she would immediately focus it on Mo Fan instead. Last time, he had touched her hand, and now, he even touched her waist!

Was a woman’s waist something a man could simply touch?

—

“That son of a bitch, that jerk who took advantage of another’s precarious position!” Gong Yu was totally infuriated.

Mu Ningxue was his favorite sacred goddess. How could he allow anyone to touch her? In his eyes, this Mo Fan was even more abominable than the Scarlet Soaring Demons! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“If you dare take advantage of her again, I swear I’ll chop your hands off!” snapped Gong Yu.

“The truth is, I’ve also taken her first kiss. Do you want to chop my mouth off, too?” Mo Fan shot back.

Before Gong Yu could explode in rage, Mu Ningxue stumbled slightly. The icy frost that took her a strenuous effort to summon simply dissipated when she lost her focus.

The frost scattered across the sky and melted in the air. The ice on the surface of the ocean continued to break into pieces.

“Stay away from me!” said Mu Ningxue, who was already at her limit.

“See, you’ve triggered my Xuexue, can you please stay ten meters away from her from now onward?” said Mo Fan, pointing at Gong Yu.

“I was referring to you!” Mu Ningxue glared at Mo Fan.

She was still in perfect control just a moment ago. The frost was freezing the water at the perfect pace. The ice was almost thick enough to prevent the Scarlet Soaring Demons from breaking the layer of ice, but this maniac Mo Fan had to show up at the most crucial timing, disrupting her focus. When she lost it, she also lost control of the power of her domain!

“Alright, alright, I won’t say anything,” Mo Fan surrendered. He stopped mentioning the past.

The truth was, he did take Mu Ningxue’s first kiss. When they were still kids, they used to play house, and Mo Fan took the role of husband. He insisted that they had to kiss as a sign that they were married, and successfully tricked the girl’s first kiss away.

Unfortunately, Mu Ningxue still remembered it among her blurry memories. She completely lost herself when Mo Fan mentioned it!

—

Mu Ningxue closed her eyes. For some reason, when Mo Fan was staying close to her, it felt like a time bomb was ticking right beside her, making it hard for her to concentrate.

Having this thought, in order to prevent the maniac from doing the shameless act again, Mu Ningxue summoned a wind wall to surround herself.

She slowly began to float up as the wind wall appeared.

Her silver hair drifted elegantly in the wind, and she extended her slender arms. She looked like a sacred fairy embracing the blowing snow. The season would change according to her mood!

As the snow landed on the surface, the seawater that was about to break free was quickly suppressed. The waves were frozen in the midst of splashing.

Mu Ningxue’s domain was even stronger after she readjusted her thoughts, and a thicker ice formed above the frozen water. The sea that almost reclaimed its freedom was entirely frozen again. Even after breaking the ice, the demon creatures could not find any seawater underneath it!

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were just about to counterattack with their ability to control water, yet the waves they had summoned were completely frozen into ice. The Scarlet Soaring Demons screamed furiously!

They did not like the cold, nor did they like the ice. Mu Ningxue had transformed their territory into an island of ice which they could not control. The Scarlet Soaring Demons immediately fixed their furious gaze on the goddess of ice who was floating at the center!

“Damn it, they are all heading toward Mu Ningxue!” Li Kaifeng turned around and saw around fifty Scarlet Soaring Demons making their way toward Mu Ningxue.

The creatures knew that they would have to get rid of the goddess of ice before they could utilize their ability to control water.

Fifty Scarlet Soaring Demons charged at their target, some leaping into the air, others forcibly summoning a wave and gliding on the current like sea gulls. Their claws were placed together, ready to scissor a strike...

The Scarlet Soaring Demons were approaching rapidly in all directions. The other Magicians scattered across the area could not retreat in time to defend Mu Ningxue!

“Stop as many as you can. They have given up on defense to focus on Mu Ningxue. Now is the best time to kill them!” said Jiang Shaoxu who was more concerned about killing the sea monsters.

Jiang Shaoxu was right. It was easier to kill the Scarlet Soaring Demons when they were focused on going after Mu Ningxue!

—

“A bunch of scum!” Mo Fan immediately spat on the ground when he saw the number of Scarlet Soaring Demons charging toward him.

Gong Yu’s lips twisted. However, he was not in the mood to pay attention to Mo Fan’s bad habit. They were simply too many Scarlet Soaring Demons, he could not handle them all by himself.

“Scum...oh, Gong Yu, you handle those in that direction. Leave the rest to me,” commanded Mo Fan.

{TL Note: ‘Scum’ here is pronounced as ‘za yu’, which is similar to ‘Gong Yu’.}

“Humph, trying to show off?” It was true that Gong Yu could only handle a certain direction. His Elements were more suitable for kiting and ambushing enemies. He was not good at handling situations where the enemies were flanking from all directions.

“I haven’t really mastered it, but I guess the spell is perfect for a situation like this!” mumbled Mo Fan.

Mu Ningxue stood closer to Mu Ningxue, who had already landed on the ground after becoming aware of the approaching danger. She opened her eyes and was shocked to discover over fifty Scarlet Soaring Demons charging toward her.

She could not afford to unleash her domain further. Gong Yu and Mo Fan would not be able to stop all these Scarlet Soaring Demons from getting close to her.

She was just about to cast a spell when she suddenly felt light-headed and staggered.

Mo Fan immediately lent her a hand. This time, he did not take advantage of her.

“Take a rest. With me here, they won’t be able to get close to you!” Mo Fan was extremely serious for once.

Mu Ningxue was just about to say something when she saw Mo Fan’s eyes engulfed in flames. The blazing red flames reflected a brilliant, burning Star Constellation!

Star Patterns began to appear around Mo Fan, each connected by seven Star Orbits...

The Star Patterns intertwined with one another. The Star Patterns gradually formed a three-dimensional, splendid and awe-striking Star Constellation!
