Chapter 2772: Not Because the Royal Mages Are Weak

??

Ye Mei had assumed Mo Fan was just another bratty young mage who was full of himself. But now, she carefully looked at the large piece of squid meat he held out to her. Her face looked slightly less strict, even surprised.

It was truly the Squid King! ‘How did the powerful Ruler-level Ocean Demon die?’

Even if Pang Lai were the one who fought it, he could not possibly kill it in such a short period of time.

‘What exactly happened in that bizarre fog?’ she wondered. She had heard a commotion and was worried that Mo Fan and Jiang Yu were going to die. So, she had rushed into the city.

“Ye Mei, the Stingray King flew into the magic formation and it’s charging towards you. We’ve been caught up with the Blue-Haired Female Demon Legion.” A voice rang out.

It must have come from a certain Sound element magical equipment.

Mo Fan looked up at the entrance of the valley. The Stingray King covered in metallic black filled with an evil aura flew past the valley sky. It flew lower as it charged toward them aggressively.

He noticed the glow of demonic eyes surrounding them. They were staring at him and Ye Mei.

The number of crimson figures grew. The Hunter Dirty Demons were creatures with a strange type of movement. They and the other Ocean Demons had skirted around the fortress defended by the mages to reach the back.

The Hunter Dirty Demons were of higher levels. They were at least at Commander level. Also, there were many Ruler levels among them.

Among the vast Ocean Demon hordes, the Commander-level Ocean Demons were the elite. However, they were not the rulers. In fact, the mastermind behind the army—The Black Claw Emperor— was the one that ruled the kingdom. Therefore, it was not surprising to find thousands of Commander-level Ocean Demons among them.

The Pacific Ocean was a vast ocean. When the powerful Ocean Demons gathered together, they could inflict severe damage to any cities on the dry lands.

“You take on the Hunter Dirty Demons while I’ll take on the Stingray King,” both of them said together. They stared at each other.

Ye Mei scoffed. “The Stingray King could be more powerful than the Squid King. Mages like you can’t even get close to it!”

“I believe you’ve misunderstood me. You are aware that the country assigned several rescue teams, and your team represents the Royal Mages. Meanwhile, I represented the Enforcement Union. I alone represent the team, and there must surely be a reason for it,” Mo Fan blurted out.

Jiang Yu rushed over as he overheard Mo Fan’s words. He sighed. ‘Mo Fan’s skills have definitely improved a great deal, but can’t he be a little humble?’

Ye Mei was so angry at his arrogance that she almost wanted to strike him across his cheeky little face. ‘Does he mean he is stronger than the Royal Mages combined?’

“Please don’t misunderstand me,” said Mo Fan, thinking it was not such a good idea to offend Ye Mei. “I do not mean you are weak. I wouldn’t dare. All I am saying is… I… um…” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ye Mei’s anger did not subside. Jiang Yu wanted to cry. ‘Mo Fan, stop being dumb.’

The Black Totem Snake was very powerful. But the Stingray King was not as stupid as the Squid King to fall into Mo Fan’s trap. Apart from the Stingray King, there were several other high-level Rulers outside the magic formation. The Royal Mages and Pang Lai had stopped them outside for now. However, if the Royal Mages and Pang Lai collapsed, a single Black Totem Snake could not do much to stop the Ocean Demon elite from devouring the humans.

“Fine. I’ll just stay here!” Ye Mei said indifferently. She had better use her time and energy elsewhere than to argue with a brat.

“Ms. Ye, don’t worry. He hasn’t revealed his trump card yet. He won’t die easily,” Jiang Yu said.

Ye Mei thought about the Squid King and looked at Mo Fan carefully. She did not say anything. She merely stared at Mo Fan as if he was a specimen at her dissecting table. Her stare seemed to be saying, “fine then, prove yourself.”

The Stingray King had arrived in the city. Its enormous body floated at less than a hundred meters above them.

The Stingray King’s wings had silver inner surfaces with flat air holes. There were plenty of tiny stingrays burrowing out of its wings. The massive number of the tiny stingrays covered half of the Silver-Blue Valley City. They flew low and swarmed into the city like locusts.

Mo Fan returned to the city area. The city was the Aquarius’s body. It was more spacious. Thus, it would serve as the magical array battlefield. The waterfall was at the very bottom of the magic formation.

The entrance of the Aquarius was narrow; hence the other Ocean Demon hordes were unable to barge in. The Stingray King was extremely cunning. It had sucked its Stingray Legion into its air holes. If the Stingray King squeezed its way into the Aquarius entrance, it could bring along its Stingray Legion…

There were plenty of tiny stingrays. Some of them were as tiny as bats, while some of them were as big as a small airplane. Meanwhile, the Stringray King was as massive as a gigantic cargo ship. The moment the Stingray King arrived at its destination; it released all its tiny stingrays for battle.

...

Ye Mei was worried when she saw the large number of stingrays filling the magic formation. The Stingray King was as powerful as the Squid King. Moreover, it took advantage of its strength by bringing in its Stingray Legion.

If this type of Ocean Demon appeared in the cities, she wondered how humans would fight them. The appearance of the Ocean Demons thus far had only been the tip of an iceberg.

“You stay here,” she said to Jiang Yu. Ye Mei could not bear to watch this anymore.

Night Rakshasa was a Great Ruler level, and Jiang Yu possessed other elements of magical power. With that, Ye Mei believed they could guard the axis of the magic formation and take on the Hunter Dirty Demons.

“Ms. Ye, to be frank, Mo Fan brought along the guardian of Hang Zhou with him. The Black Totem Snake is the one that severely wounded the Squid King before Master Pang killed it with a single slash,” said Jiang Yu.

“Guardian of Hang Zhou?”

“Yes, the Black Totem Snake is a totem beast. Even the Stingray King is no match for the Black Totem Snake…” Before Jiang Yu finished speaking, he noticed something above the Silver-Blue Valley City. Mo Fan had summoned a creature with the Holy Spirit, and it glowed in the moonlight.

“Is the guardian of Hang Zhou a… moth?” Ye Mei pointed at the sacred Moon Moth Phoenix that appeared beside Mo Fan.

The Moon Moth Phoenix glowed radiantly. It looked mysterious and divine. It shone brightly over the Silver-Blue Valley City and overwhelmed the black Stingray Legion.

“W-What is this…?” Jiang Yu was dumbfounded.

‘Where’s the snake? Why is there another totem beast?!’
