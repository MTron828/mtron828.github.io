“What a pity, I was hoping to find a reliable man to get rid of the petty rumors about me,” Lu Qingyao said.

“Don’t worry, there are still a lot of good men in this world. You don’t have to fix your eyes on me. After all, I’m a man with a family and lovers. I won’t be able to take care of everyone. Jiaojiao, have some yourself too. You don’t have to keep peeling them for me,” Mo Fan said. He picked up a tender crayfish with his chopsticks like he was going to feed her.

Mui Nujiao puffed her cheeks.

She only gave Mo Fan the crayfish because they were too spicy for her. It was not like she was serving Mo Fan on purpose!

The woman was throwing mud at Mo Fan, but not only did he not explain himself, he was making it worse!

What did he mean by he was a man with a family and lovers… Was there any man that was more shameless than him?

Lu Qingyao felt like her barbed words had landed on a sponge. Not did she fail to make the man bleed, he had swallowed her spikes, too!

“So you are Mo Fan!” Lu Zhengxin finally realized who Mo Fan was.

“This table is full, you should wait for the next one. You might be a little prince of the Lu Clan, but you should queue up for your turn,” Mo Fan told him.

“This is my table!” Lu Zhengyin yelled.

“Why are you so stubborn? Boss, can you bring a stool for him? You can just sit beside that model. It’s not much of a big deal.”

The boss actually added a stool to the table. Lu Zhengxin pointed at Mo Fan angrily.

“Just you wait, just you wait!” Lu Zhengxin felt like his lungs would explode if he stayed any longer.

He ran out of the shop and back inside his car. He floored the pedal and drew away in a loud howl, but the sound of the engine was not enough to vent his anger!

——

Mo Fan had a satisfying meal before going back to his place.

He prepared a tub of hot water and immersed himself in it. He immediately relaxed as the iciness in his skin and bones disappeared.

He heard soft footsteps as he was relaxing.

Mo Fan ignored the footsteps. He assumed it was Ai Tutu.

The door swung open. Mo Fan had not locked it.

Mo Fan saw a slim figure standing by the door.

She had pitch-black hair with the sheen of a pearl. A clear line was splitting her long fringe in half in the middle, revealing her forehead and giving her an elegant appearance, while setting off her youth.

“It’s only been a few months, but you are no longer using the double ponytail I like,” Mo Fan said in a sorry voice.

“Pervert!” the little beauty shot back.

“Why are you trying to look like the little girls in the horror movies? They also part their hair in the middle. They look angelic at first, but their faces suddenly darken as they turned into devils in the next second,” Mo Fan went on.

“Should I take a selfie with you in the background and post it on the Internet with the caption ‘I’m enjoying a bath with my brother’?” Lingling took out her phone and aimed the camera at herself.

Mo Fan almost jumped out of the tub. “I’m sorry!” Mo Fan lowered his head.

Damn it, the girl had barged into the bathroom while he was having a bath first. How dare she file the suit first? He had never seen a little loli as shameless as her!

“We have a job. Do you want to accept it?” Lingling demanded to know.

“Can you let me rest for a few days? You have no idea who I took care of in South America… Hey, why are you raising your phone again? Are you really typing that caption? Fine, I’ll do it. I’ll take it!” Mo Fan agreed helplessly.

Mo Fan could tell Lingling was being driven crazy by her retarded school. It had been a while since they both went on a job together. She was ready to detonate herself to take him down with her!

“It’s a special job. The Hunter Union received a Double-S rank request. Every Senior Hunter registered in Asia’s Hunter Union is qualified to accept it. In addition to that, every private agency in Asia has also received the request. They are paying a semi-manufactured Universe Vein as the deposit,” Lingling informed him.

“A Universe Vein?” Mo Fan almost jumped out of the tub again.

A Universe Vein was similar to a Galaxy Vein, a thing that could help a Mage?overcome their current bottleneck in the simplest manner!

Due to the current grim circumstances, the Galaxy Veins useful for achieving the Advanced Level had already reached a price of around three hundred million each, let alone the Universe Veins which could help people achieve the Super Level!

Mo Fan had many Elements that were stuck at the Advanced Level. He desperately needed a Universe Vein!

In the past, Universe Veins were never spotted in the marketplace and high-level auctions. They were normally used as bargaining chips between reputable organizations and the rich and powerful.

Who was crazy enough to pay a Universe Vein to the private agencies as a deposit? It was extremely valuable, even if it was only semi-complete!

“The Battlehorn Hunter Agency in Asia received one. The Moonhunter Agency in Japan received one. The Sacred Elephant Agency in India received one. Dubai’s Willing Helm Agency has one, too!

“And our Clearsky Hunter Agency also has one!” Lingling finished.

Mo Fan was astounded.

The client had invited the best agencies across Asia. Was he trying to hunt a boss-level demon creature that was threatening the whole Earth?

“Aren’t there agencies with better performances than us in our country? Why were we chosen for the job?” Mo Fan had to ask.

“It’s because of my grandfather,” Lingling conjectured.

“Ugh… fine,” Mo Fan scratched his head. Old Bao used to be the Clergyman of the Holy Judgment Court. Leaders from many countries had great respect for him. “What does Old Bao think?”

“My grandfather was invited to an expedition out to the sea. They must have picked up traces of the Ocean Lord,” Lingling reported.

Mo Fan scratched his head awkwardly again.

Old Bao was the real deal. He had the courage to chase after traces of the Ocean Lord. It sounded like a suicide mission to Mo Fan!

It was likely an order from the government!

“What should we do, then?” Mo Fan asked cluelessly.

“Let’s check it out. Don’t you want a finished Universe Vein? Even though three of your Elements have reached the Super Level, you still have five other Elements at the Advanced Level...” Lingling said.

It was the downside of having too many Elements. Other people with three Super Elements were close to graduating from the mundane world and were about to enter a new map in the Immortal Realm.

“If they are paying a semi-manufactured Universe Vein as the deposit, the reward for completing the job is...”

“Two complete Universe Veins, at least,” Lingling said.

“But a person can only ever use one Universe Vein, right?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm, but you can trade the rest for other resources,” Lingling pointed out.

“Fine, let’s check it out!”
