“Jiang Yu, let your Rock Demon attack with me!” Ai Jiangtu said.

“Got it!”

Ai Jiangtu leapt into the air and landed firmly on the Rock Demon’s shoulder.

Ai Jiangtu was wearing a dark blue jacket. Due to his military background, he had the imposing demeanor of an officer. He advanced with the Rock Demon, his eyes staring down at the remaining members of the Japanese team.

Suddenly, Ai Jiangtu raised his hands! “Stop!”

An invisible Space energy spread out. When the team was confused about why he was reacting strangely all of a sudden, they soon discovered six shadow thorns within ten meters of Ai Jiangtu. The thorns were flying rapidly toward him from the woods, yet they immediately came to a stop ten meters away!

The six Thorns of the Shadow Rose failed to move any closer to Ai Jiangtu, despite their extraordinary power. It was like there was a magnetic field at ten meters circling Ai Jiangtu. Any object trying to harm him was unable to move any closer!

“Break!” Ai Jiangtu clenched his fist. The six shadow thorns were immediately crushed by overwhelming force. They immediately turned into black puffs of smoke, dispersing in the air.

Within the woods, a pair of sharp eyes flickered. Ai Jiangtu immediately turned around as his silver eyes emitted a brilliant glow.

The owner of the eyes immediately realized the danger he was in. He quickly withdrew into the shadows and disappeared into the woods like a phantom.

As soon as the figure vanished, a section of the woods was crushed into pieces, splintering in all directions. An area a hundred meters square was razed to the ground!

Standing a safe distance away, Akira Matsuki gasped in relief. He stared at Ai Jiangtu standing there on the Rock Demon’s shoulder.

“This guy is extremely dangerous! He almost caught me!” Akira Matsuki was drenched in cold sweat.

He was only trying to ambush Ai Jiangtu, who had clearly exposed himself. To his surprise, not only did the man nullify his attack with ease, his location was almost compromised! It was tricky to defend against the man’s outstanding control of the Space Element. If he had been any slower, he would have to leave the match in shame!

“Stop!”

The Rock Demon continued moving forward. Ai Jiangtu opened his hand as he began to emit a brilliant, silver glow. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The fiery sparrows lunging at him from the air, the rupture approaching him along the ground, the fierce tide pouring down from above, and the gradually-approaching storm, all spells meant to land on Ai Jiangtu, had come to a complete stop, as if time had stopped flowing!

The four spells had stopped completely before Ai Jiangtu’s power. They could not even move an inch closer to Ai Jiangtu and the Rock Demon. The spectacular move immediately earned a loud cheer from the spectators!

“Such a strong Space Mage!”

“He just stopped all the spells with a single wave. This man must be the captain of the Chinese team! He is so cool!”

“I’m afraid even the Advanced Spells won’t be able to harm him. He’s like an adult facing the wild swings and kicks from a three-year-old.”

Ai Jiangtu’s performance immediately stirred an uproar from the crowd. The incomparable strength of the Space Element had made him look unbeatable, as spells of multiple Elements had failed to overcome the field of energy that Ai Jiangtu had set up!

Under the stage, Mo Fan was extremely jealous when he saw how impressive Ai Jiangtu’s Space magic was.

He had to admit Ai Jiangtu’s Space Element was terrifying. Mo Fan was also a Space Mage, so he knew how difficult it was to stop every spell targeting him. He could not help but be impressed when he recalled that his Space Rhythm: Time Stasis could only reduce the speed of the spells within it!

The path of cultivation was never-ending. His Lightning and Fire Elements were very impressive now, but he still needed to put in more effort to improve his Space, Shadow, and Summoning Elements!

However, it was just how the path of cultivation was. Mo Fan immediately felt great anticipation when he saw Ai Jiangtu able to stop the opponents’ attacks with a single wave. How cool would it be when he reached Ai Jiangtu’s level?!

—

“Humph, I would like to see if you dare to stop my spell, too!” Shou Watani immediately showed his pride.

A brilliant brown Star Constellation appeared around Shou Watani, setting him off like a god of stars. As the Star Constellation formed from more than three hundred stars condensed rapidly, his eyes changed, like they had turned to stone!

They did not look lifeless, but were actually reflecting a sharp light!

“Eyes of the Rock Demon: Earth Dragon Spike!”

Shou Watani’s eyes had transformed completely as he was granted the power of the Rock Demon.

Anywhere he set his eyes on, spikes would suddenly spring up. Solid rocks like lines of thorns rapidly appeared on the initially flat ground!

Soon, a few pointy rocks burst out from the surface in a line extending away from him.

More rocks burst out of the ground, their height increasing. They went from three meters at the start to fifteen meters high. The rocks continued to spring up with shocking force, like the backbone of a dragon rising from the ground, smashing anything along the surface into pieces!

The Earth Dragon Spikes reached the Rock Demon. A spike twenty meters long sprang up and knocked the Rock Demon to the ground.

Ai Jiangtu was aware of how powerful the spell was. His Space Stasis had no chance of stopping the spikes. Left with no choice, Ai Jiangtu cast a spell and blinked a certain distance away while forcibly bringing the enormous Rock Demon along with him!

The Earth Dragon Spikes were still coming out of the ground, and the spikes that appeared later were absolutely massive. Luckily, Ai Jiangtu had blinked to where the first spike was, meaning that he was safe from the strong Earth Spell!

The Rock Demon had a few cracks on him. Despite its outstanding size, its strength was pretty average, although its sturdy, thick skin was able to take a fair amount of damage. The reason why Ai Jiangtu bothered using the Space Spell to save the creature was because if it was around, even without Time Stasis, it could still take some hits for the team!

As Ai Jiangtu was advancing, Jiang Shaoxu and Mu Ningxue had plenty of time to cast their spells. Jiang Shaoxu completed her Psychic Spell first.

She was busy preparing Psychic Impact in the form of a wave. She believed once she released the spell, the Japanese team would not be able to cast any spell above the Intermediate Level for a short period!

“Psychic Wave!”

Jiang Shaoxu finally completed her spell. The invisible Psychic force immediately penetrated the minds of the Japanese members. Those that were in the middle of connecting Stars were taken by surprise. The Stars immediately scattered in disorder, making it impossible for them to arrange them into the Star Patterns for Star Constellations!

Even Shou Watani was affected by the Psychic Wave. He finally understood why Ai Jiangtu was willing to expend his energy and forcibly push forward with the Rock Demon. He was providing cover for the Psychic Mage on his team!

“Calming Pendant!”

When the Japanese team was in chaos from the Psychic spell, the short-haired Maga on the Japanese team suddenly kissed the Pendant on her neck. It immediately emitted a gentle, faint-blue glow. The gentle glow descended upon her teammates and calmed their minds!

Most importantly, apart from the short-haired woman, all her teammates were recovering quickly.

“Damn it, I didn’t expect them to have such a piece of magic equipment!” Jiang Shaoxu was extremely annoyed.

The Psychic Wave could easily secure the victory for them, since not many Mages were able to cast their spells under its effects. If the enemy could not use their magic, even for a short period of time, the situation would be totally in their favor. To their surprise, the Japanese team was extremely cunning. They had brought along a magic item of the Psychic Element even when they did not have a Psychic Mage on their team. Something like that was very expensive and rare!

—

“Rich, that short-haired Japanese woman is extremely rich!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Mo Fan nodded in agreement.

Mo Fan also had a Focus Necklace on his neck. It was able to block a single Psychic attack or a bewitching spell within a certain period. However, Mo Fan could only use the Necklace to protect himself, he was unable to help his teammates with it. However, the Pendant that the short-haired Japanese woman owned was able to help her whole team recover.

Besides, Mo Fan realized that the faint-blue glow remained on the members of the Japanese team, meaning that their minds were being protected for a limited time. Any Psychic spells would have no effect on them!

The necklace would rarely be useful in normal situations. It was very obvious that the woman had prepared the necklace for the World College Tournament, to specifically protect the team from a Psychic Mage!

“I’m totally useless as long as that aura is still around. You guys will have to think of some way!” There was nothing else Jiang Shaoxu could do.

“It’s fine, that thing won’t be able to last for too long, you can help Mu Ningxue in setting up her spell,” Jiang Yu said.

Jiang Shaoxu’s tertiary Element was Ice. She was not particularly adept with it, but it was still useful in battle, since it was possible to stack their Ice Magic!

“Mu Ningxue, your Ice Element...” Jiang Shaoxu was about to ask Mu Ningxue how she was going with her preparations. However, when she turned around, she saw Mu Ningxue flying into the air!

Behind her was a pair of Wind Wings, setting off her elegant demeanor and her glamorous face. She looked like a pure, spotless angel to the crowd.

However, the angel riding the wind did not have a gentle appearance. She was flying in the air because she was planning to spread her ice across the entire stage!

“Domain: Icy Wind Nirvana!”
