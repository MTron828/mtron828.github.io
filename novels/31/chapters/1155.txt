The people of the Hall of Faith crowded along the mountain path after hearing the news. They soon saw the back of a young man heading up the stairs through the magical barrier.

“That man...isn’t he Mo Fan, who defeated Zorro in the World College Tournament?”

“It does look like him, what is he doing? Doesn’t he know how serious the consequences are for barging into the sacred mountain?”

People quickly recognized Mo Fan on the Starry Mountain Path. The noise of their discussions soon echoed across the mountain.

The mountain path was soon crowded with people. They stared at the Chinese student who had grabbed the attention of the world in the World College Tournament. They were struggling to understand his reckless behavior.

Further ahead, the people of the Hall of Knights soon gathered at the exit of the Starry Mountain Path. They were able to see the entire place that was covered by the magical barrier, and the tiny Mo Fan, too.

“Who is he?”

“It doesn’t matter who he is, he’s digging his own grave!” Hall Master of the Hall of Knights Haylon declared coldly.

“I bet he’s here for Ye Xinxia,” Kulun said.

Kulun was standing close to Fiona. Kulun used to be Xinxia’s Guardian Knight. Since Xinxia’s status had risen significantly, Kulun had been receiving a lot of benefits as her Guardian Knight. However, Kulun was extremely terrified when he learned of the latest discovery.

As a matter of fact, he was unwilling to believe it, but he had no choice but to accept it when he saw the evidence!

“What an idiot!. Does he seriously think this is going to work? No one can possibly make it to the end!” Fiona said anxiously.

“He has reached the first statue.”

“Not many among those so-called geniuses are able to defeat the copper beast!”

—

Mo Fan reached the stair of the first statue. As he set his eyes on the statue, its eyes suddenly sprang open and stared at Mo Fan in return too, with a strong, intimidating presence of evil!

It was the first statue defending the Starry Mountain Path, the Bronze Beast of Greece!

It was an ancient creature of Greece, symbolizing slaughter. The founders of the Parthenon Temple had subdued the savage creature and arranged for it to guard the sacred mountain!

The Bronze Beast of Greece only had one eye. Its limbs were short and fleshy. Its body was bloated like a giant toad, while its head resembled a rhinoceros, with a sharp bronze horn on its nose.

The bronze horn pointed at Mo Fan as the Bronze Beast suddenly charged at him. He could only see a deadly, blue beam approaching him rapidly. It was too quick for him to react.

A small, bloody hole appeared on Mo Fan’s shoulder; fresh blood poured out and stained his shirt.

The Bronze Beast of Greece went to the other side. Its eye had a disdainful look, as if it had purposely missed the attack just so it could warm up further. Their Curse had forced the statues to remain still in the wind and rain for many years. They could only move when someone dared to take the challenge!

The Bronze Beast did not show any sign when it attacked. The auras of many creatures would shift when they were about to lunge, and their bodies would also tighten like an arrow about to be fired from a bow. But the Bronze Beast of Greece was half-lying on the ground, as if it was about to take a nap. However, it would suddenly charge forward with remarkable speed and puncture its enemy with the bronze horn.

Mo Fan suddenly felt lost, as he had no idea how to defend himself.

Mo Fan’s body was soon covered in wounds, but the wounds were not deadly. The Bronze Beast’s eyes had the same disdainful look.

It was quite obvious that the beast did not want to kill Mo Fan too quickly, since it would have to hibernate for many years until the next intruder showed up.

The Bronze Beast attacked once again. The same blue ray flickered past. This time, Mo Fan was knocked flying by the beast, rolling down the stairs.

“Why didn’t he dodge it!?” Zhu Meng said worriedly.

“It’s impossible to dodge it. The Bronze Beast’s eye and horn have a unique magic that can lock onto their target, making it extremely difficult to dodge its attack,” Pang Lai said.

“Impossible to dodge? How is Mo Fan going to defeat him?”

“Let’s hope that Mo Fan can come up with a plan.”

Mo Fan did not feel any pain, even though he was being hurt continuously. First, the injuries were not serious, and second, he had yet to collect his thoughts from the shock. When his mind was fully occupied on one thing, the pain he was feeling was negligible!

Mo Fan rose to his feet and quickly treated his wounds to stop them from bleeding.

It was not like he was not paying any attention, but the beast’s attacks were basically undodgeable. The beast was not particularly huge, yet its attacks were like he had just collided with a giant mountain!

The Bronze Beast laughed like a human, like it was mocking how weak its challenger was.

This time, the Bronze Beast seemed to be planning to deal a serious blow to Mo Fan. Its eyes flickered with a hint of savagery.

Another blue ray flickered past. It charged from the stairs all the way to the arc-shaped entrance.

Mo Fan did not bother dodging the incoming attack. He stared at the Bronze Beast coldly...

“Sky Lightning Claw!”

When the blue light arrived, Mo Fan clenched his fist into a claw and faced the Bronze Beast head-on!

Dark lightning burst out from the tip of his fingers and took the shape of a giant claw, crashing into the Bronze Beast on the stairs!

The power of the lightning was fairly shocking. The thick lightning arcs and the aura of the Sky Lightning Claw exceeded the Bronze Beast’s attack and landed on the beast, knocking it flying. The Bronze Beast slammed heavily into the stairs!

“Blink!”

The lightning arcs were still dancing wildly in the air when Mo Fan shuddered and vanished into thin air.

The spot the Bronze Beast was falling onto trembled as a mysterious silver glow flickered. Mo Fan came out from the crack. His arm was wrapped around in a black lightning spiral!

“Lightning Arm, Explode!” Mo Fan slammed his arm onto the Bronze Beast hard!

The deadly beams detonated with a terrifying explosion of lightning. Arcs soared into the sky like dragons. The blinding light surged across the place, blasting the stairs and the plants nearby into nothing. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Bronze Beast was blasted into the air by the lightning arcs. It was surrounded by the lightning, as if its body was about to be disintegrated by the formidable power at any second...

“Tyrant Call!” Mo Fan’s gaze sharpened. A thick lightning bolt swept past and punched through the Bronze Beast from left to right.
