Getting rid of the Curse or not was still Apas’ call. Mo Fan had no intention of wasting his time on her.

Apas was furious. Getting rid of the Curse was just as troublesome as using the Medusa’s Stare. She had basically used all her energy to drag Ethan into that psychological hell. She had barely recovered some of her strength through absorbing the energy of the Receiver Crystal, but Mo Fan was ordering her around again!

“I can get rid of the Curse if you let me go back to Greece on my own for some time. I need to collect something,” Apas declared.

“Is your skin peeling off?” Mo Fan asked.

“It’s called ecdysis!” Apas stomped her foot.

“Fine; this ecdysis, will you grow stronger after it?” Mo Fan asked her.

“I think I can recover a tenth of my strength,” Apas said.

“Sure, go ahead. I’m very poor now. Don’t ask me to buy you anything, especially things that are very expensive,” Mo Fan told her.

Apas rolled her eyes. She had never counted on Mo Fan to buy her stuff!

Mo Fan agreed to give Apas a few days off. No one could possibly pose a threat to her, considering her strength.

Apas removed the Curse of the Snake Eyes Ethan had been placed under. He could finally get a peaceful night’s sleep after he no longer being bothered by the ghastly faces at night. He immediately told Izisha about it.

Izisha kept her promise in good faith. She gave Mo Fan a letter she had prepared long ago. It held the information on how to Summon the God of Darkness.

“Do you think that woman is trying to trick us? Is she going to tell us the wrong thing and get us killed while we are looking for it?” Zhao Manyan asked Mo Fan.

“Apas might have removed the Curse, but she can still revert it within a certain period. I have thought of a backup plan just in case,” Mo Fan answered calmly.

“Very well. Speaking of which, what exactly is this Night Amethyst? I’ve never heard of it before,” Zhao Manyan asked with a puzzled face.

—

Night Amethyst was an extremely rare mineral. In addition to collecting the souls of the dead who might be useful to the Dark Plane, the God of Darkness also sent his avatars across the worlds for his own hobby, which was collecting Night Amethyst. As a result, it was not difficult to lure an avatar to them. They just had to find a piece of Night Amethyst and offer it to the God of Darkness via a Dark Ritual. An avatar of the God of Darkness would normally show up. If they were in luck, the real God of Darkness might show up, meaning that they could exchange the Night Amethyst for something even greater in return.

Mo Fan purposely paid Asha’ruiya a visit to make sure Izisha was not lying to him.

“I think she’s telling the truth. Back in the days, when Dark Magic hadn’t been granted to us yet, some Mages exchanged rare minerals with the God of Darkness. It was known as a Pact with the Devil. Since then, some talented people figured out the patterns of how the God of Darkness went back and forth between the Dark Plane and our world. They were the originators of Dark Magic. I believe this Night Amethyst is something that established the connection between the Dark Plane and our world in the first place,” Asha’ruiya informed them.

“Is that so? That means if we can find some Night Amethyst, we can make a deal with the God of Darkness, ask it to spare Mu Bai’s soul in return, and everything is settled?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“More or less, but no one knows whether the God of Darkness will have some other requests. It was called the Pact with the Devil in the past, so the Devil will most likely demand more from us. Besides, if you did Summon the real God of Darkness, it could just take everything it wants forcibly with its strength. Could we even bargain with it?” Asha’ruiya let them know.

“Do you know where we can find some Night Amethyst?” Mo Fan asked.

“I’m not sure myself, but if you want, I can put up a request for it in my network. Only a few people would know about something like the Night Amethyst, which only exists in the legends. We can only obtain information among those people and certain strange folk. You will have to decide whether the information is reliable or not,” Asha’ruiya proposed.

“You have my thanks.” Mo Fan glanced at Asha’ruiya. He purposely waited for a while to see if she was going to ask for any benefits from him in return. After all, she had helped him twice at no cost. She had no reason to be so generous, knowing her traits of being a meticulous planner and keeping careful account.

To Mo Fan’s surprise, Asha’ruiya blinked at Mo Fan with her dazzling eyes instead. She seemed confused about why Mo Fan was staring at her. She conveniently gave him a flirtatious look and sent an electric shock across his body.

“I find it embarrassing that you’re helping me so much,” Mo Fan had to say.

“We are friends,” Asha’ruiya pointed out.

“Why don’t I pay you back with my body? Check out my build, stamina, and durability. I can guarantee you that you will be satisfied,” Mo Fan said shamelessly.

Asha’ruiya almost had an urge to beat him up. Was that supposed to be a payback? He was the one enjoying it in the end!

Filtering information was not Mo Fan’s expertise, but he knew someone who was an expert at it.

Asha’ruiya kept her promise. She soon relayed all of the information related to the Night Amethyst that she had collected to Mo Fan. Mo Fan promptly gave the information to Lingling.

To avoid folk tales misdirecting them from the truth about the Night Amethyst, Mo Fan even stole the forbidden Manuscript of Dark Magic from the Parthenon Temple and passed it to Lingling. She had a higher chance of finding the origins of the Night Amethyst and the location of some.

They were forced to wait until Lingling found some reliable clues. Mo Fan sat outside and fell into deep thought while watching the sun setting on the horizon.

Mo Fan suddenly smelled something burning. He spotted black smoke rising behind a wall not far away.

Mo Fan walked over and saw the light of a small brazier. A man was crouching beside it, tossing joss paper into the fire.

“Old Zhao, what the f**k are you doing!?” Mo Fan blurted out.

“I’m burning money for Mu Bai. He was still a virgin when he died, so I decided to burn him some money so he could find a hot demoness in Hell and have some fun,” Zhao Manyan said.

“...” Mo Fan was left speechless.

“I saw you were sitting there spaced out. What were you thinking about?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“I was thinking about Izisha,” Mo Fan said.

“F**k me... some heavy fetish you got there! But on the other hand, if you can really dominate her, it will save us a lot of trouble. We won’t have to worry about who will be elected the Goddess,” Zhao Manyan mentioned.

Mo Fan put on a fake smile, and simply ignored that nonsense. He murmured to himself, “I’m suspicious about Izisha’s resurrection.”

“She was the Goddess; what’s wrong with her being resurrected?” Zhao Manyan said.

“She doesn’t have the Spell of Resurrection! Xinxia had the Soul of the Parthenon Temple all along! There are only two ways to bring a dead person back to life. If it wasn’t the Spell of Resurrection that brought her back to life, does that mean her resurrection has something to do with Egypt or the God of Darkness? Otherwise, how did she manage to wake up as if she was still alive after she was seriously ill and chopped into pieces?” Mo Fan wondered aloud.

“Chopped into pieces! Who the hell dared to chop the previous Goddess into pieces!?” Zhao Manyan blurted out with wide eyes.
