A hole in its body, a cut into the back of its head, and burns all over its body... any ordinary demon creature would be lying still on the ground by now, but the Sudden-Death Poison Queen was perfectly fine, as vigorous as it was at the start of the fight!

Monsters of this kind were no longer explainable with ordinary thinking.

“Mo Fan, what’s your situation?” Lingling’s voice came over his com.

“Not good, this thing seems to be invincible,” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had even used his ultimate, the Advanced Lightning Spell. It did inflict reasonable damage to the creature, yet why was it still full of vigor?

“Just retreat if you can’t handle it, the Enforcement Union has finished cleaning up the mutated monsters,” answered Lingling.

“It hasn’t come to that yet. I won’t give away a hundred million so easily,” Mo Fan said decisively.

Fang Shaoli was quite valuable. Mo Fan was hoping to use the money to fight his way back to the national team with Mu Ningxue. He had to take Fang Shaoli down, even if it was a tough fight!

Luckily, Liu Ru was here to help. Judging from her strength, she could basically take on a Commander-level creature. Even if she was going against the Commander-level Sudden-Death Poison Queen on her own, she would not necessarily be in a disadvantageous position. As such, Mo Fan had plenty of opportunities to cast Advanced Spells.

Otherwise, if he was being chased around by the Sudden-Death Poison Queen during the whole fight, when could he possibly find the time to cast some complicated Advanced Spells?

It was the same old trick. Liu Ru would keep the Sudden-Death Poison Queen busy while he was channeling the spell off to side. If casting the Sky-Flame Funeral once was not enough, he could cast it again!

Mo Fan was planning to spread flames across the whole place, just so the Sudden-Death Poison Queen would burn continuously, no matter where it was running to. No creature was truly invincible. No matter how tough the Sudden-Death Poison Queen was, it would eventually die to the Advanced Level fire! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Sky-Flame Funeral!” Mo Fan summoned a fiery cloud once again. The rain of flames filled the Slanted Hall and connected with the lake of fire that was still burning, lighting up the underground hall brightly.

The flames surged wildly. The Sudden-Death Poison Queen let out an unpleasant screech. It was obvious that it was no longer as energetic as it was before...

“Liu Ru, can you think of a way to keep it in one spot? I’m going to use another Star Constellation Book to blast a hole in its brain!” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan’s Advanced Lightning Spell came from a Star Constellation Book. Tangyue had only given him five of them, and he already used one.

Mo Fan had to rely on the Star Constellation Books to cast the explosive spell, as he had yet to master the Star Constellation of the Lightning Element.

The overwhelming Advanced Lightning spell was clearly effective. However, it seemed like the first attempt did not land at the right spot. The Sudden-Death Poison Queen was perfectly fine even though the Lightning Beam had drilled right through it.

“I don’t think I can keep it under control!” Liu Ru did not overestimate herself. She was able to kite the monster around, but she had no chance of keeping it in place.

“Withdraw your fire, I’ll try!” a crisp, icy voice rose from outside the Slanted Hall. Mo Fan glanced over and saw Mu Ningxue standing there.

Lingling was with Mu Ningxue, too. It was obvious that Lingling’s antidote had worked.

Mo Fan was relieved. The stone in his heart finally vanished when he saw that Mu Ningxue was fine.

Since Mu Ningxue was no longer in danger, he had plenty of time to play with Fang Shaoli slowly. If his first round of attacks did not work, he did not mind repeating it a few more times!

Mo Fan withdrew the Sky-Flame Funeral. Fire was not really effective against this kind of poisonous creature. As such, it was better to leave it to Mu Ningxue’s world of snow and ice.

Frost spread through the air and froze the ground as Mu Ningxue unleashed her Ice Domain straightaway. Her Ice Element was no weaker than Mo Fan’s Advanced Fire Element under the effects of her Domain, especially with her outstanding control. The hall that was burning just a moment ago was rapidly covered in ice!

The disciples being chased around by Mo Fan’s Swift Star Wolf felt like crying. Just a moment ago, they were hoping that they could find an ice cellar and hide inside it, yet when the ice cellar actually appeared, they were turned into ice statues instantly.

The chill penetrated the bones and ice froze their flesh. Even the sturdiest body and thickest armor totally lost effect when the frost invaded a creature’s body.

Fang Shaoli felt herself being threatened by Mu Ningxue. She suddenly gave up on chasing after Mo Fan and targeted Mu Ningxue instead.

The creature’s body was now wrapped like a ball by her poisonous aura, allowing the poison to float through the air. The poison arrived in front of Mu Ningxue in less than a second.

The poisonous liquid was still flowing, trying to surround Mu Ningxue from both sides, and flow shut on her like a jellyfish.

If Mu Ningxue was caught by it, she would die almost instantly. Luckily, she was an agile Wind Magician, too! The Wind Track was already set up on the path she needed. The wind made her incredibly light as she moved around swiftly. Fang Shaoli missed her attacks several times in a row, and barely threatened Mu Ningxue at all.

“Lingling, will it work if I blast its brain open?” asked Mo Fan.

“I don’t know, give it a try!” Lingling was standing quite far away. As a Master Hunter, she knew how to protect herself better than anyone else.

“I can freeze it in another ten seconds, but I won’t be able to hold it in place for too long,” Mu Ningxue said confidently.

Ten seconds was not particularly long. Both Liu Ru and Mu Ningxue belonged to the agility type, and the queen was not really an outstanding Commander-level creature. It finally ended up covered in thick layers of ice under Mu Ningxue’s powerful Domain, which completely immobilized it.

Mo Fan was already inserting energy into the Star Constellation Book. The purple Star Patterns looked utterly aloof, giving the Star Constellation an imperious aura.

With a flash and crack of lightning, the Lightning Beam traveled over a hundred meters and landed directly on Fang Shaoli’s malevolent face at Mo Fan’s shout.

The Lightning Beam struck the creature’s nose and left through the back of its head, leaving scorch marks behind, and a perfectly hollow hole in the monster’s face. There was no blood, and no liquid, only traces of scorched meat.

This time, the Sudden-Death Poison Queen stopped moving. It did not fall to the ground, as it was frozen in ice.

“Is it dead?” asked Mo Fan.

“Not sure, let’s just smash it into pieces!” Liu Ru was as violent as Mo Fan after spending too much time around him. Her long fingers swept rapidly through the air, and began shredding the frozen Sudden-Death Poison Queen into tiny pieces with her claws!

“Keep her brain, she’s worth more than a hundred million!” Mo Fan reminded her.

“She’s still inside!” replied Liu Ru.

After peeling back the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s thick poisonous cover and flesh, the three discovered that Fang Shaoli was still alive. Still covered in sticky liquid and poison, she was dragged out from the Sudden-Death Poison Queen’s corpse.

The human and queen were finally separated. Fang Shaoli seemed to be conscious still. Her pale, yet angry face was staring at Mo Fan, like her eyeballs were about to pop out.

“The Black Vatican likes to play the devil and terrorize the world, yet they are just the same as this Sudden-Death Poison Queen. What’s inside after removing the skin is only trash like you!” spat Mo Fan at her stare...
