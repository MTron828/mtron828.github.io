The day of the mixed battle finally arrived. The black horse of the tournament, the Chinese team had lost its brilliance under the sacred light of the other two countries, England and Greece.

The match was not held in the same stadium as the previous rounds, but a confined space similar to the Treasure Hunt.

The confined space was a battlefield, constructed by an artist with the Space and Earth Elements a long time ago. The battlefield had a length of a kilometer, and a width of half a kilometer. It was divided by a river with a rapid current, with aged trees on both sides of the river. The trees were taller than fifty meters on average, and the dense canopy was basically another terrain in the air...

After the forest was a mountainous area with steeper slopes further away, with perfectly straight, tall cliffs at the end, as if the whole place was surrounded by a circle of dams.

There were seats set up on the cliffs for the audience, allowing them to look down at the battlefield from a great height.

As a matter of fact, the battlefield was the same as the wild. Even those that managed to get themselves a seat with the best vision were unlikely to be able to watch the match clearly.

—

The authority figures of different countries were long seated in their allocated seats, while the people that entered with the tickets they had purchased had prepared all kinds of devices to help them see further into the distance. The people were all excited, waiting for the mixed battle to begin.

The students were in their reserved areas. The teams were allocated to observation decks extending out from the cliffs. The participants and their advisors were arranged to stay on the observation decks, and when the time came, the assistant judges would signal to them.

The observation decks were set up in different corners. The members were able to see where the other two teams were by glancing into the distance.

The battlefield was quite huge, and it was unnecessary to set up a magic barrier for the match. The battlefield and the spectator seats were ninety meters apart in terms of height. The magnificent cliffs surrounding the battlefield were already a solid barrier. The organizer had allocated the spectators reasonably. If a burst of energy was heading in their way, the people appointed by the organizers would intervene and protect them.

On the other hand, due to the size of the battlefield, the assistant judges would have trouble intervening in time. The assistant judges might not even know where the students were!

There were twelve assistant judges in the mixed battle. They would be moving around on the battlefield without intervening with the fights. They would be watching the fights, and if they believed a student was in life-threatening danger, they would lend a hand immediately.

Apart from the twelve assistant judges were assigned to protect the students, each participant was given a Ring of Venice, too.

The Ring of Venice was a masterpiece that every forgemaster of Venice was proud of. These rings were outstanding because they would activate automatically. The rings were able to analyze the danger its bearer was in. If the person wearing the ring was not protected and the damage of the spells targeting the person was too high, the ring would assume the bearer was in danger and unleash a Water Barrier to protect the bearer...

However, if the Ring of Venice was activated, the participant wearing it would be disqualified from the match!

The Ring of Venice was a great invention. The country had wanted to promote it for a long time, but because the materials needed to forge the Ring of Venice were incredibly rare, it was impossible to mass-produce the magic ring. Otherwise, Hunters who spent most of their time in the wilderness would be willing to spend a fortune on a Ring of Venice!

“Have you heard? Even if we lose the match, we’re allowed to keep these rings as a prize. They aren’t going to take them back!” Zhao Manyan played with the ring excitedly.

“That’s a nice consolation prize. It’s very handy for protecting our lives,” Jiang Yu remarked.

“Can the two of you have some more confidence? This ring is garbage compared to the prizes for the top three teams!” Mo Fan snapped. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Ring of Venice was indeed valuable, but whenever Mo Fan thought about the Blessing of the God’s Seal, or the full set of magic equipment that could grant them an extra spell, the Ring of Venice was just too ordinary in comparison.

“You guys... just react according to the situation. I have nothing much to say, try your best,” Feng Li said.

The other advisors agreed to let the students decide on their own approach for the match, seeing that Feng Li did not bother discussing some kind of meaningless strategy with them.

—

“Participants, in your positions!”

“The match begins now!”

A brilliant Light spell was fired into the sky above the battlefield as the signal. The light sprinkled onto the river, the canopy, and the mountainous area.

This time, the Chinese team had sent out their strongest formation. Both Mo Fan and Ai Jiangtu were among the starting members, while Mu Ningxue was assigned as the sixth member, allowing her to provide backup when needed.

The starting members consisted of Mo Fan, Ai Jiangtu, Guan Yu, Mu Tingying, and Zhao Manyan. The five of them were actually very strong...

The five were close to the boundary of the mountainous area and the forest. They headed into the forest while Guan Yu stayed in the canopy and watched the other two teams.

“Both England and Greece are between the river and the forest. We’ll be stumbling into them soon if we continue to move at this rate,” Guan Yu called down.

“Let’s head over then. It’s unnecessary to hide, we’ll face them directly,” Mo Fan said.

The five made their way toward the river. All three teams were from strong nations, so it was unreasonable for the team to show a sign of weakness. They had to retain their momentum in order to win in the mixed battle.

They soon arrived at the river.

The first team they stumbled into was not the English team, but the Greek team.

The Greek team was less than a hundred meters away from the Chinese team. They did not attack right away, and seemed rather collected.

Mo Fan immediately saw Asha’ruiya among the Greek team. Even in the tournament, the woman was still dressed in a sacred, yet alluring outfit. If Mo Fan had not witnessed how insane Asha’ruiya could be in person, he would believe that she was a sacred Candidate for the role of the Goddess, just like everyone else.

Mo Fan exchanged glances with Asha’ruiya. The woman kept winking at him, as if she was flirting with him and teasing his impenetrable heart...

The English team arrived soon, led by their captain, Zorro, the man with dark green hair and eyes. Mo Fan could feel a dangerous presence under the man’s gentle appearance.

Mo Fan saw Ayleen, too. She was as calm and elegant as usual. She nodded when she noticed Mo Fan’s gaze.

For some reason, Mo Fan felt a sense of helplessness under Ayleen’s conservative gaze!

“What should we do now?” Zhao Manyan glanced to his left, then to his right. He seemed to be under great pressure.

“We’ll target the English team,” Ai Jiangtu said.

“For sure?”

“Yes!”

The team placed their attention on the English team as they prepared to attack.

However, to their surprise, the Greek team immediately engaged them, too!

It was not like a member of the Greek team had attacked the Chinese team directly, but a Summoned Beast shrouded by a deathly aura of darkness, wearing black armor and holding a giant, black sword was charging right at them from the direction of the Greek team!

Zhao Manyan almost felt like his head was about to explode as soon as he saw the creature. Wasn’t this death knight riding on the dark horse the Dark Swordmaster that was guarding the pyramid in Egypt? Why the heck would it show up here?

The horse galloped forward, leaving a trail of wilted plants and fallen leaves behind it. The Dark Swordmaster raised the giant sword and slashed at Guan Yu, who was observing the surroundings from the high ground.

The black aura unleashed by the sword slashed through an entire row of the trees. Guan Yu agilely hopped between the trunks that were falling slowly. The Dark Swordmaster continued to swing its sword wildly at Guan Yu. The formidable attacks shattered the ancient trees into pieces before they even landed on the ground!

“Attack!”

Meanwhile, the English team made its move too, seeing that the Greek team had already engaged the enemy. The person that attacked first was Herbert who held a grudge against Mo Fan. He cast the Plummeting Rays, firing light arrows down at the Chinese team, forcing its members to either split up or stick closely together.

“F**k me, the two teams have teamed up to take us out first!” Zhao Manyan cursed while setting up his defense.

“We’re done for, they actually teamed up against us...”

They initially decided to face the two powerhouses in a fair fight, but the two teams ended up joining forces instead to pick on them. It felt like the Chinese team was surely going to be disqualified at the start of the match. The supporters of the Chinese team cursed at the two powerhouses while worrying about the Chinese team’s situation!

“Hehe, were you surprised? Little Mo Fan?” Asha’ruiya stood on a branch and glanced down at Mo Fan with a pair of glittering eyes.

“Do you really think I would believe the words of a cunning vixen like you?” Mo Fan grinned coldly. He seemed rather calm.

“What can you do even if you don’t believe me? You’re about to run away from here with your tail between your legs!” Asha’ruiya had a great smile. It looked pure and innocent, it totally did not look like she was trying to get her revenge on Mo Fan for taking advantage of her before!

“Do you really think I don’t have a brain?” Even though Mo Fan knew the situation was not in favor of the team, and they might even lose a member or two within a short period of time, it was nowhere enough to disqualify the Chinese team immediately.

“Look behind you,” Asha’ruiya remained calm. She was not in a rush to attack.

Mo Fan turned around and saw a man with dark green hair and eyes approaching. It was obvious that he was planning to flank him together with Asha’ruiya.

“I believe I can take you out myself, but I’ve asked him to come just in case,” Asha’ruiya sounded very languid, like a woman speaking coquettishly to her boyfriend after just waking up. Any man would be flushed with embarrassment hearing it.

However, Mo Fan was not willing to fall for the trap of the cunning vixen. He turned around and glanced at Zorro, the participant ranked first in the tournament...
