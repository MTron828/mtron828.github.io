Chapter 1341 The Chief Extraditor

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

That night, Mo Fan, Lingling, and Zhao Manyan arrived at Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union. They went to Mount Jueguai and soon noticed the place was in a mess. It was obvious that something had happened.

They went into the main hall and saw a group of people talking amongst themselves with strange looks.

A woman was crying sadly in the main hall. They went forward through the heavy and depressing atmosphere and saw a few Enforcers.

“I believe she’s Su Qingqing, the person you are looking for...” the Enforcer leading Mo Fan and his crew said with a frown.

“We are one step late,” Mo Fan said.

“And you are?” An Elder looked at Mo Fan and his crew doubtfully.

“This is Mo Fan, the strongest participant in the World College Tournament. These two are his partners. They are investigating Elder Leng Qing’s murder,” Enforcer Qi Yang answered.

Qi Yang was a member of the Preventive Committee. He had the authority to investigate members of the Enforcement Union. Secretary Gu Lian had asked him to assist Mo Fan with the investigation.

“What does Elder Leng Qing’s murder have anything to do with us?” the Elder of Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union, Zou Hui, asked.

“We have discovered a traitor in the Enforcement Union was responsible for Leng Qing’s death. We just found out that the traitor is here in Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union, and was Su Qingqing. However, she’s dead now,” Mo Fan said.

Zou Hui frowned. He said in a deep voice, “We believe it was a suicide.”

“She killed herself out of guilt?”

“Who could have thought that Su Qingqing was one of the Black Vatican...”

“She must have realized that she had been exposed, so she chose to kill herself!”

The rest of the crowd burst into an uproar. The members of Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union did not expect it to turn out like this. They immediately investigated everything Su Qingqing had done and her possessions.

The process was conducted smoothly. They soon discovered the confidential information that Su Qingqing had leaked and traces of her sending the information to outsiders. They also found things that could possibly identify her as one of the Black Vatican among her belongings.

Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union was shaken by the findings. They never suspected such a young Enforcer would be a spy of the Black Vatican, nor did they have any idea how she was able to trick the Tree of Vows!

“I thought we finally found a clue, but it’s gone again. How cunning the Black Vatican is!” Zhao Manyan burst out angrily.

If they could get their hands on Su Qingqing, they could easily track down the member of the Black Vatican she was contacting. That person would at least have the rank of Blue Deacon, which might lead them to the Cold Prince...

Now that Su Qingqing was dead, the trail was gone too.

“Yeah, we are back to square one!” Mo Fan said helplessly.

“What should we do next?” Zhao Manyan said.

“What else can we do? The trail has stopped here. We can only think of something else. Let’s go back tomorrow morning. We’ll bring Su Qingqing’s corpse, so we can explain it to Lingyin Enforcement Union,” Mo Fan said.

“I guess that’s all we can do.”

The third day after Su Qingqing’s death, the higher-ups thoroughly investigated the Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union. Its members were severely impacted. The members, Enforcers, Supervisors, and Elder all suffered the wrath of the higher-ups.

Luckily, it had all come to an end. Su Qingqing and Bei Jiang had paid for Leng Qing’s death.

Half a month later, Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union was back to normal. The disturbance slowly faded away.

Supervisor Cheng Ying requested for a vacation to take some time off. Elder Zou Hui did not have any objection. After all, the Enforcement Union was now in a slump after they discovered there was a traitor among them. It was necessary for them to take a little break.

Cheng Ying left Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union without leaving any traces behind. The first thing she did after she left was find a desolate altar and activate it.

The altar was connected to her soul. She endured the pain and forcibly severed the vow she had taken as a member of the Enforcement Union.

Severing the vow inflicted serious damage on her soul. She fell feebly to the ground and took a long time to recover. She dug up a black stone behind the altar...

She staggered to the pond nearby and placed the stone in the water. The water immediately turned black, reflecting Cheng Ying’s pale face on its surface.

Cheng Ying murmured a strange mantra. A few ripples appeared on the surface of the pond. It immediately displayed the image of a person wearing the crimson-red mask of a demon!

“Crimson Demon, it’s me, Blue Deacon Eagle Eye,” Cheng Ying said.

“Master Cold Prince just mentioned you recently. You have done well. Once you’re back, we might consider promoting you to a Great Deacon!” the man wearing the crimson-red demon mask answered.

Cheng Ying was suffused with joy, her body shaking in excitement. However, she soon realized the situation she was in and said, “My cover has been compromised, but I managed to trick them with the girl I had long prepared as a scapegoat.”

No one in the Enforcement Union knew about the relationship between Cheng Ying and Su Qingqing. Cheng Ying had never allowed Su Qingqing to meet her when there was someone else around, nor did she allow the girl to call her aunt in front of others. Therefore, she was not implicated after Su Qingqing’s death. The higher-ups did not find anything suspicious about her, either. Cheng Ying had done everything that involved betraying the Enforcement Union under Su Qingqing’s name. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Of course, Su Qingqing had been totally unaware of it!

“You’re very cautious. You already knew something like this would happen!” the man smiled.

“The higher-ups have given up on Mount Wuyi Enforcement Union. I don’t think I will need to stay here any further. I will find a valid excuse to leave the Enforcement Union and return to the organization,” Cheng Ying said.

“Very well. The Cold Prince is busy preparing a great plan, so he definitely needs some help. Go to him after you’re done cleaning up your trail. I’ll send an Extraditor to pick you up,” the man said.

“Thank you, Master Crimson Demon! Please send my humble regards to Master Cold Prince.” Cheng Ying bowed and kissed the rock in front of her like a humble servant.

—

Cheng Ying left the cave and proceeded with her plan of taking a vacation.

She could finally go back to where she belonged after so many years. It was tiring wearing this disguise. She was looking forward to relaxing and getting rid of her burdens during this vacation!

However, little did Cheng Ying know, that as she was just about to welcome her new life, a man had witnessed everything that had happened in the cave!

—

Mo Fan picked up the unique black stone and walked out of the dark hole. He chuckled when he saw Cheng Ying leaving in high spirits.

“So this is the Black Vatican’s Messenger Stone, something that only a Blue Deacon would have...” Lingling came out from the woods near the cave and inspected the stone.

“How was it? Did we manage to locate the Red Cardinal?” Zhao Manyan asked.

Mo Fan shook his head and said, “She was talking to a guy called the Crimson Demon. He said that he would send an Extraditor to pick her up...”

“He must be the Chief Extraditor! I didn’t expect her rank to be high enough to have direct contact with an Extraditor... my sister told me about the Chief Extraditor of the Black Vatican before. The Chief Extraditor is even more mysterious than a Red Cardinal, since only the Chief Extraditor has the complete list of members of the Black Vatican! This Cheng Ying is clearly a deadly chess piece that the Black Vatican has long placed in the Enforcement Union, if she’s taking orders from the Chief Extraditor!” Lingling murmured.

“Which means we are really dealing with the authorities of the Black Vatican now!?” Mo Fan asked.

The Chief Extraditor was only slightly inferior to a Red Cardinal. The guy called Crimson Ghost had the list of members under a Red Cardinal. If they could get their hands on the Chief Extraditor, wouldn’t that mean they could take out a seventh of the entire Black Vatican!?

The Black Vatican was infamous for its ability to conceal its members’ identities. Most of their members were disguised as ordinary civilians. They were like human time bombs, posing a great threat to society. If the Extraditor really had the information on those people, taking him down would allow them to find many members of the Black Vatican too!

“Yeah, he must be the Chief Extraditor, but unfortunately, he isn’t the one picking Cheng Ying up. Otherwise, we could just take him down and take out the Cold Prince!” Lingling swore.

“Yeah, he’s only sending an Extraditor over, meaning he won’t show himself.”

“I believe we can’t afford to touch this Cheng Ying yet. If an Extraditor is coming to bring her back to the Black Vatican, we might be able to follow them to their secret lair and learn the Cold Prince or the Chief Extraditor’s true identity...” Mo Fan said.

It was an extremely risky move. It was likely that Leng Qing had done the same thing, which eventually led to her death.

However, it did not necessarily mean Mo Fan and Lingling would back away!

The Calamity of the Ancient Capital had too much of an emotional impact on Mo Fan. He would not allow the same thing to happen again in his country. He would be filled with remorse for the rest of his life if his homeland was stacked with corpses and rivers of blood!

However, Mo Fan could not afford to act recklessly either. The Black Vatican was brutal and cautious. Even someone as smart as Leng Qing did not escape from them. Mo Fan was unwilling to follow in her footsteps. Every step forward was like walking on a thin layer of ice. He had to think carefully before making any move!
