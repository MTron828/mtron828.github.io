Chapter 1347 The Gruesome Battle on the Bus

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

An old man slowly rose to his feet on the bus. He cautiously hid some mandarin peaches behind his seat and used an old shirt to cover them, as if he was worried that someone would steal the mandarins.

He went to the washroom at the back of the bus. He decided to relieve himself after struggling for some time. There was still more than an hour’s journey before he reached his son’s place.

“Ah, you’re on this bus too, what a coincidence!” The old man immediately recognized Cheng Ying seated in the last row. He had a friendly smile like he was eager to converse with her. “People are less polite nowadays. It’s really rare to see someone like you, who’s willing to help the elderly. Was the mandarin I gave you sweet? I planted it myself. My son loved them when they were young. I always bring him some whenever I visit him in the city. (Sigh)...he rarely comes home after he started working in the city. We aren’t as close now, I wonder if I’m troubling him and his family with my visits...”

Cheng Ying looked at the old man silently. She had already noticed the old man was heading to the same destination as her.

The old man seemed to have misunderstood her. He thought Cheng Ying was willing to hear him out. He added, “There seems to be something wrong with my legs. I can no longer live in the mountains and plant fruits. The doctor suggested me to move to the city since it’s cold in the mountains, but my daughter-in-law doesn’t seem to like me very much. Besides, I’m having trouble moving on my own because of my legs. I wonder if I’m going to be a hassle for my son. I wouldn’t want to disturb them...”

“I can help if it really is troubling you,” Cheng Ying said.

“Really? Please tell me,” the old man blurted out.

“It’s no longer a problem if you were to die now!” Cheng Ying’s voice turned cold. She held a sharp icicle that had appeared out of nowhere. She stabbed the defenseless old man in the heart.

The old man did not feel any pain at the start. He only felt a chill around his heart. There was no blood pouring out, as it was frozen by the ice.

Even his breath had turned into a mist. He looked at the woman in astonishment.

The old man had assumed Cheng Ying was a gentle, kind-hearted woman. She even helped him down the stairs, and he had given her a peach as a token of gratitude. The little encounter had provided the old man some relief. If even a stranger was so friendly to him, his son’s family would not think of him as a hassle, either.

He never thought the kind-hearted woman would suddenly turn into a detestable murderer!

“Your mandarin was terrible, I believe your son only likes them because he doesn’t want to hurt the ego of a piece of trash like you!” Cheng Ying grinned and shoved the old man away.

The old man stared at her. The thought of his son’s disgusted face crossed his mind prior to his death.

Was it true?

Was it really that bad?

Was he really a piece of trash?

The pain surged across his body, but for some reason, the emotional pain was worse than the pain from his heart.

“AHHHH!” The other passengers had seen what had happened, and screamed in fear, “Help, she’s a murderer!”

The driver quickly slammed on the brakes to stop the bus so the passengers could escape, but a strange voice suddenly barged into his mind, forcing him to lock the doors and continue driving.

The passengers completely lost their calm. They never expected that there would be two cold-blooded murderers on the bus!

“The Enforcement Union will never stand a chance against us. It’s too easy to kill someone, but saving a person’s life is ten times harder than that! It’s very simple to find out if the Enforcement Union is on our trail. We just have to kill these useless vermin of society. If they are nearby, they will show themselves to stop us,” the Shepherd yawned.

Every member of the Black Vatican being extradited was an important clue that could lead the Enforcement Union to the Black Vatican. Therefore, every time the Shepherd did his job, he would always use this simple yet effective method.

Killing the people!

Killing at will!

The more innocent the people were, the better!

If the scum of the Enforcement Union were around, they would surely intervene!

If they were not around, they could just treat it as a way to entertain themselves. Besides, the number of people in the world was so high. Even if they were to kill from morning to night, it would still not make any difference to the world!

“Continue with it, take your time, let’s torture the people that are on our trail,” the Shepherd said.

“I have waited too long for this day!” Cheng Ying laughed. She stared at the timid passengers hiding and screaming in the corners.

A pair of golden wings were soaring in the sky above the mountains. He remained on one side of the mountain to prevent the people on the bus from seeing him.

“Shit, they seemed to be murdering the people on the bus!” Zhao Manyan blurted out.

“Those assholes of the Black Vatican!” Mo Fan’s heart burned in rage.

“What are you doing?” Qi Yang of the Preventive Committee immediately stopped Mo Fan.

“Saving the people, of course!” Mo Fan said.

“If you show yourself now, they will know that we are following them. This is the common approach that the Black Vatican use when they are extraditing someone important. If we are serious about taking down the important authorities of the Black Vatican, we have to ignore it. Saving them is the duty of the Enforcers, but our duty is to track them down. If we all act on impulse like you when dealing with the Black Vatican, we’ll never be able to track down their Blue Deacons and Red Cardinals!” Qi Yang held Mo Fan firmly, not willing to let Mo Fan act recklessly.

Qi Yang had been hunting for the Black Vatican for a long time. The Black Vatican had always played them like a fiddle. The Enforcement Union never made any progress because of this, thus they came up with a different approach.

People like them were only responsible for tracking the Black Vatican. They were not allowed to show themselves, no matter what happened.

Against a cult like the Black Vatican, they would never make any progress by adhering to normal ways!

“So you’re telling me to just watch them die?” Mo Fan looked at Qi Yang.

“If you are serious about tracking down a Red Cardinal, you will have to bear the condemnation of your conscience. Cheng Ying is a Blue Deacon, and the Extraditor with her is one of the best they have. Not only is he extremely powerful, he also has direct access to the higher-ups of the Black Vatican. There’s a good chance we’ll learn the identity of a Chief Extraditor, or even a Red Cardinal. There are only around a dozen people on the bus. It’s worth it if we can stop something like the Incident of the Red Mediterranean Sea from happening!” Qi Yang said sternly.

Mo Fan was in the car right behind the bus. He took a deep breath.

He stood up with silver Stars flickering around him. The Stars joined into Star Orbits, which further combined into Star Patterns, and eventually constructed a Star Constellation...

“I’m afraid I don’t agree with you. I’m not a Tracker like you, and I don’t really care about the bigger picture here. We can always find another way to stop them, but the dead will never return. I don’t want to carry the guilt for the rest of my life!” Mo Fan said.

As he finished the sentence, the number of Stars around him had reached 343.

The brilliance of the Stars reached its limit. They soon shattered into pieces and disappeared magically.

The following second, Mo Fan appeared on the roof of the bus.

Qi Yang looked at Mo Fan’s figure standing in the strong wind. He was left speechless for a moment.

Every person had their own decisions to make. It did not necessarily mean Mo Fan was doing the wrong thing. Qi Yang had understood that the heart of the strongest participant in the World College Tournament was like a fire burning without restrictions.

“Damn it, I can’t stand it any further too. I’ll kill those two sons of b**ches!” Zhao Manyan dove from the sky and landed heavily on the roof of the bus.

The impact blasted a hole in the roof. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan jumped into the bus.

The bus was quite big, with a spacious walkway. The driver’s mind was being controlled. The bus was still picking up speed on the highway. A strong wind was now blowing in through the hole, knocking the things inside the bus flying. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Save the people,” Mo Fan told Zhao Manyan.

“Got it!” Zhao Manyan had outstanding defensive powers. He would not have any problem protecting the civilians.

He immediately cast Water Barrier on the passengers. A golden Rampart split the bus in two, preventing any harm from befalling the passengers.

Mo Fan saw the passengers were all at the front of the bus. He decisively summoned a bolt of lightning.

The bolt of lightning slashed at the spot where Zhao Manyan had placed his Rampart, splitting the bus in two!

The second half of the bus began to lose its momentum, but the front half sped up and pulled away!

Mo Fan was left in the second half of the bus. He stood close to where the bus was split in half and stared at the Shepherd and Cheng Ying coldly. His chest was burning with rage when he saw the dead old man.

“You couldn’t even bear it when we only killed one person,” the Shepherd sighed. “You’re most likely a new Enforcer...there were fifteen people on the bus. If you didn’t show up, only fifteen would die, but it’s now seventeen, including you and your partner,” The Shepherd remained seated even while the second half of the bus was shaking vigorously.

“Extraditor, he’s not an Enforcer, he’s Mo Fan!” Cheng Ying recognized Mo Fan right away.

Cheng Ying was surprised to learn that she was actually being followed. In other words, she had killed Su Qingqing for nothing. Her identity had been exposed!

“Mo Fan? Oh, I remember now, you’re the guy that gave Salan a huge headache! I believe they also call you the strongest participant in the World College Tournament... it turns out that the Chief Extraditor wasn’t lying to me. This is indeed an interesting job!” The Shepherd finally rose to his feet and took a closer look at Mo Fan.
