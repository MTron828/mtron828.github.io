3039 Blood Temple (1)

“The Goddess has arrived!” said a female sage.

The people on the ceremony platform, who were chatting and discussing, stopped everything. Everyone looked at the hall of Blessing Mountain.

The first thing that caught their eyes was the hair that was as black as the night sky. Each strand of hair was uniquely braided like a flower. The hair on the snow-white shoulders was as smooth as silk. With the solemn and noble steps of the goddess, they bobbed rhythmically.

The tail of the skirt was dragging slowly on the carpet covered with olive flowers. The spirit of the wind was lingering around this soft and slender figure and danced with the leaf.

!!

A pair of eyes even more beautiful than all the breathtaking scenery of Santorini was revealed. If they could understand the hidden emotions in those eyes, they would feel the endless gentleness of the owner of these eyes.

They had to admit that the newly elected Goddess was perfectly in line with the characteristics of the Parthenon Temple in terms of image and temperament.

It was not only that she had a beautiful face but that she showed the gentleness and beauty of womanhood to the fullest. She was like a poem that people could never fully understand. It was not only her gorgeous rhetoric that attracted people, but also her soul, which blended with beauty and poetry.

The Saintess and the Goddess were only one level apart, but people felt that the young Goddess candidate had undergone a radical change. It may have been a psychological effect, or it may be the baptism of the Divine Soul.

Ye Xinxia was different from before. Even the smile on her face was no longer as pure as before. It was a polite smile. There were many meanings hidden behind that smile, which expressed unpredictability.

People changed eventually.

Ye Xinxia felt it when she faced the mirror. The reflection in the mirror was completely different from when she first entered the temple. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

If it were in the past, people’s attention would make Ye Xinxia a little nervous. She was often pushed to the front of the stage by the Hall Mother and the elders without much experience or mental preparation.

It was a grand ceremony. It was the focus of the world this time. When she walked, she smiled with a pair of bright and slightly blurred eyes. However, her mind was calm.

Every step was firm.

Although Saintesses had to learn etiquette and take care of their appearances every week, this does not mean they could not make mistakes when they stood in front of the world.

Besides, Ye Xinxia had been sitting on a wheelchair for a long time. She rarely walked to the stage on her own before.

Being calm in the face of all this signified an absence of joy, tension, or pride.

She was the final winner of the battle. Hundreds of people were watching Ye Xinxia, cheering for her and flattering her, but she only felt sad.

The more beautiful she was, the darker and empty her heart was. The brighter the lights, the more difficult she found it to suppress the mania and pain in her chest.

“Ye Xinxia, does the god in your heart give you any instructions you want to convey to the confusing world?” The Old Priest, Falmer, took out the scriptures of the Parthenon Temple and asked Ye Xinxia, who was on the altar of the Goddess.

“No,” replied Ye Xinxia.

Her answer puzzled everyone. Even the Old Priest, Falmer, was astonished. ‘Could it be that the Goddess had not prepared a script? It was a message to believers all over the world. How could there be nothing?’

“Ye Xinxia, will you strictly abide by the will of the Parthenon Temple during your succession?” Old Priest, Falmer, skipped to the next question.

“So far, I have never disobeyed the will,” Ye Xinxia replied.

Falmer and all the priests of the Hall of Faith frowned again. ‘Was the Goddess so busy yesterday that she did not have time to memorize the script this morning?’

Even if she did not memorize the script, she should have been able to give an inspiring speech at such an important moment after being a saintess for many years. Although nothing was wrong with her reply, it was still lacking in conviction.

“Ye Xinxia, please swear by your soul to be kind to everyone who believes in the Parthenon Temple.”

“Ye Xinxia, please swear by your soul that after becoming the Goddess, you will do your best to bring peace and tranquility to the world. There will be no war and suffering.”

“Ye Xinxia, please swear by your soul that you will be loyal to the Parthenon Temple forever and ever!”

Falmer solemnly read out the oaths. Each guided declaration was like the order of the god. It echoed in everyone’s mind like a bell that rang for a long time.

“I, Ye Xinxia, swear by my soul. After becoming the Goddess, I will do my best to bring tranquility and peace to the world. There will be no suffering and no… no… no war!”

There seemed to be a sharp blade stuck in Ye Xinxia’s throat. When she made the declaration, she was in so much pain that she could not speak properly.

…

Bright red blood spurted on Ye Xinxia’s feet as soon as she finished speaking. A few drops of blood stained the pure and flawless white dress, and the flower-covered steps were stained red.

On the front seat, the head of an old man in a tuxedo rolled down on the ground. He sat there, and the blood on his neck gushed like a fountain.

People were horrified and looked at the old man, in a tuxedo, in disbelief. Many people recognized him. He was the elder of the nine Hidden Clans of the Parthenon Temple. Although he had lost his magic due to his age, he still had high wisdom and connections.

Splat!

Before anyone could react, a man in a black suit and red shirt stood up suddenly in the back row. His chest was cut open, and blood spurted from between his ribs. The guests in the front row were a few ladies, and their long, fragrant hair was covered with the blood of the man!

Splat!

Blood exploded like fireworks. Everything happened so quickly. Uniform blood spurted like bunches of scarlet roses in mid-air among the thousands of seats in front of the stage. The air was filled with a strong odor of blood, and fear spread quickly!

In the crowd, the woman in linen stood up in shock. Her eyes scanned the crowd sharply, trying to find the murderers who had caused this bloodshed! ‘How strong were the murderers who could kill so many people in such a short period?’

“My lord, your disciples… The Supreme Pontiff has attacked us!” Yan Qiu felt a great, impending threat.

“The Supreme Pontiff’s people are also dead.” Salan stared at the man in the black suit and red lining.

He was an Italian Red Cardinal.

When Salan saw the Italian Red Cardinal just moments ago, she had felt joy on seeing her colleague.

‘Since when could the head of the Black Vatican sit at an international ceremony as openly as the world leader?’ His chest had been slashed. When he fell into a pool of blood, his face was filled with shock and confusion.
