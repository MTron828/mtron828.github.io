Chapter 1525 Gentleman“s Room

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Mo Fan noticed that Cairo was a typical city of war when he entered it. Despite the killings happening all over the city’s vicinity and the deaths of the people that stepped out of the city, the residents continued on with their everyday lives inside the safe zone. None of them seemed to be worried about the battle that was taking place.

Not just Mo Fan and the convoy, many other people had also come to the city from different places. Cairo’s government strongly advised Mages not to come to the city without permission while the battle was still ongoing. It prohibited people from leaving the city, too, but if anyone managed to make it into the safe zone alive, they would provide them with protection. It was a rather humane city.

Mo Fan would never forget the general that had abandoned them in Peru.

International laws stated that every city guarded by the military must accept those in need into the city. They might not be obliged to leave the city to save them, but once they entered the city, they would be responsible for their safety.

Egypt’s Cairo strictly obeyed that rule. That alone made it a good city!

“Let’s stay at the city’s center, it’s the safest.” Zhao Manyan was worried about the Eyes of Vengeance. He did not want to stay in the areas closer to the battlefield.

The city’s center was at least a few dozen kilometers away from the battlefield. It was unlikely that the Medusae could travel a few dozen kilometers and sneak into their rooms to murder them without alerting anyone, right?

——

When they reached the city center, the tall buildings, streets, shops, pedestrians, and vehicles gave the Mages that had recently traveled through the wild a sense of security.

“We are staying here!” Zhao Manyan said firmly, pointing at a tall building.

“Do you really have to be so scared?” Mo Fan chuckled.

“I’m not scared, I just think that this hotel is very luxurious. It’s been a while since I have had the feeling of looking down at a capital city like an overbearing CEO. I’m completely worn out after living like a savage for the past few days. I just want my normal life back!” Zhao Manyan answered firmly.

“Alright, we’ll be staying here,” Mo Fan agreed.

Chad and his little brother followed them, but they preferred to save some money. They knew it would cost them a few thousand to spend a night in a hotel like this, and decided to share a room.

Zhao Manyan, on the other hand, was rich and imposing. He immediately booked a presidential suite for each of them. He did not even blink when he swiped the card to pay over ten thousand for a single night’s stay.

“Mu Bai, let’s stay in the same room. I would like to discuss Ice Magic with you. I’m thinking of Awakening the Ice Element once I reach the Super Level,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Sure, but ask them for a room with two beds, I’m not used to sharing a bed with someone,” Mu Bai chuckled. He knew what Zhao Manyan was afraid of.

Mu Bai was an Ice Mage, a nemesis of the snakes. It was obvious that Zhao Manyan was really afraid of the Eyes of Vengeance if he chose to stay with Mu Bai instead of Mo Fan...

“Heidi, we’ll stay in the same room just in case,” Mo Fan handed his identification to the clerk. He placed Heidi’s identification together with his.

Heidi glared at Mo Fan and said, “I’m not scared!”

“Miss Heidi, I think you should listen to Brother Mo Fan. The Eyes of Vengeance isn’t a child’s game. You must believe me, it’s a lot safer to stay in pairs!” Chad was very serious. He strongly advised them not to stay alone.

The vengeful Medusae would latch onto every opportunity to get their revenge. If they were paralyzed and hypnotized when they were alone, there was only one possible outcome!

“I will never stay in the same room with this shameless guy!” Heidi said proudly.

“There are different kinds of rooms, such as the kind that is suitable for a gentleman with no ulterior motives. Even though we are in the same suite, the rooms are still separated. Heidi, stop being so stubborn, it’s not like Mo Fan had never seen your...” Zhao Manyan immediately sensed a murderous gaze in the middle of his words, and immediately shut his mouth. He believed he would die at Heidi’s hands before he was killed by the Eyes of Vengeance if he kept going.

Heidi finally agreed to stay in the same suite as Mo Fan after seeing how strongly Chad and the others insisted on it.

To be honest, Mo Fan was hoping that they would be staying in a small room in a small inn. It was very easy to catch fire that way. Everyone had some biological needs. Mo Fan would not believe Heidi was really that pure, with no hidden desires!

Unfortunately, the luxurious hotel in the capital of Egypt was brilliant in every aspect, apart from their spacious rooms. Asking someone to stay in a hotel together was no different than inviting them over to one’s home as guests. They would be sleeping on their own without even the slightest thoughts of unleashing their fervor. Should he consider asking Mu Bai if he still had any of that aphrodisiac left?...

—

There were two bathrooms and two bedrooms with a huge living room in the middle, stocked with complimentary alcohol and snacks. Mo Fan suddenly realized how insensible that idiotic Zhao Manyan was at times. It was fine if he and Mu Bai stayed in a suite like this, but why did he not get the smallest room possible for him instead? He was not able to get a close look in the cave under the waterfall last time. He was supposed to have a chance to see it in high definition and uncensored this time...

Mo Fan looked over the night view of the city. The luxurious sight reminded him of his beloved Magic City. He was confused about why Cairo looked so clean and clear even though it was so close to the desert, while Magic City was constantly hazy.

“Heidi, where are you from?” Mo Fan laid down on the sofa and asked the woman who had withdrawn back to her territory.

“Heidi? Heidi!” Mo Fan rose to his feet. He quickly headed into Heidi’s room.

The Eyes of Vengeance had struck quicker than he had imagined. Old Chad was not lying after all!

Mo Fan was about to pass through the corridor when he suddenly felt an invisible wall in front of him. He almost walked right into it.

Mo Fan was a little shocked. How capable were those Medusae? They could even set up a barrier before killing their target?

“If you dare take another step forward, I’ll blast you into pieces!” Heidi’s voice came from the room, followed by the sound of her showering.

Heidi was terrified too. She was once again convinced that Mo Fan was a perverted assh***. He was trying to rush into her room... Luckily, she was alert enough to set up a barrier first.

“Holy crap, you scared the crap out of me, I thought you were being attacked by the vengeful Medusae! Can’t you just say something if you’re fine? I gave Miss Brianca my promise to look after you. It’s my job to keep you safe when she’s not around!” Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh while peeking through the barrier.

He could barely see the bathroom from his angle. The view was blocked by a thick half-transparent door with patterns on it. Mo Fan was just able to see a blurred outline, slender with elegant curves. Its bust was utterly shocking. He seriously wondered how such a slim body could have such beautiful hemispheres. Look at them shake... even though they were not as round and firm as Brianca’s, they were perfect for Heidi’s physique!

Foreigners were big indeed, with crazy curves. The perfect ratio of their bodies made them as elegant as artwork. On top of it, both Heidi and Brianca had peachy butts. Mo Fan clearly remembered the sight he had seen in the cave under the waterfall when Heidi had her back to him. He could not forget it even now!

“Isn’t it time for you to leave? I’m perfectly fine!” Heidi said angrily when she saw Mo Fan kept swaying in front of the barrier.

“Oh, oh, I was just making sure, I saw a shadow that looks like a snake in the bathroom, I thought it’s a snake... but it’s your body instead,” Mo Fan said.

“I’m going to kill you!”

“I’m going, I’m going, calm down, the world is so wonderful, don’t be so mad,” Mo Fan blurted out.

Mo Fan fell into deep thought when he went back to the living room.

In terms of physique, he believed only Asha’ruiya might stand a chance against Heidi, considering they were both around the same age. In terms of maturity, Brianca clearly had first place. Europeans had a natural advantage over Asians in terms of physique. Their skin was as pale as snow and their body ratio was closer to perfect. Their female features were particularly outstanding, too...

The truth was, Mu Ningxue’s body was stunning too, but Mo Fan was shocked to realize he had never seen her naked after being around her for so long. Her skin might be the most perfect among the women he had met due to her Innate Talent. She perfectly represented the term ‘flesh of ice and bones of jade’. Such a pity; he had met so many women, yet he had never seen his first wife’s body! They might not be as big as these two foreigners, but they were not small, either. He did feel them when he was carrying her in his arms. They were soft and comfortable, and were definitely not small...

“That’s weird, shouldn’t I be worried about the Eyes of Vengeance? Why are my thoughts suddenly filled with these things?” A big question mark suddenly surfaced in Mo Fan’s mind.

—

Mo Fan cleared his mind of the thoughts that continued to plague him. He moved a chair and sat in front of the French window. He closed his eyes and began to meditate.

Meditating was a way to rest, too. Mo Fan usually meditated instead of sleeping. He would only sleep for two hours a day. Most people would sleep for more than five hours, but Mo Fan had a few extra Elements to look after. He had been spending the time when other people were asleep to cultivate since he was in high school. It eventually turned into a habit of only sleeping for two hours. He had gotten used to resting through meditating.

Mo Fan entered the meditation state fairly quickly. He was imagining things that could give him a nosebleed just a moment ago, but he had perfectly calmed his thoughts.

When Mo Fan entered the Spiritual World, he habitually roamed between the Galaxia. However, a pair of enormous black eyes suddenly appeared in the areas he usually roamed in. It gave him such a fright that he immediately opened his eyes and almost fell from the chair...

Sweat poured down like rain. The eyes of a snake showing up out of nowhere had given Mo Fan a tremendous fright. The eyes were as huge as the dark sky in the Spiritual World, while he was only as small as a dust particle. It was absolutely terrifying!

Mo Fan took a few deep breaths to finally calm himself.

He looked stern as he recalled the sight.

It turned out that he had truly underestimated the Eyes of Vengeance!
