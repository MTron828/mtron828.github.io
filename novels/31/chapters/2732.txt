Chapter 2733: Femme Fatale

The elders from Licheng Afterglow Island had stolen a statue before in their selfishness and risked many lives. They had then blamed the totem and moved to the island that now was called Licheng Afterglow Island.

Mo Fan had believed them when Big Sister Ruan and Shu Xiaohua had told him the story. But now when he thought about it, he should not have. Mo Fan shouldn’t have believed their story about their attempt at redemption.

They had shown regret and led Mo Fan to believe that they did not want to make the same mistake. They even pretended to advise the hunters not to covet these statues and sought his help to stop them from stealing and jeopardizing Mingwu Ancient City.

Their story had been so convincing that anyone, even Mo Fan, would be swayed by it. Mo Fan thought back and realized he had overlooked something important.

They were greedy, vicious, and sinful. Their elders had stolen before and lived on an island which was isolated and remote from the outside world. How could he have even believed for a second that the young girls raised by selfish elders could ever be pure and kind?

Most people judged others in that way. When they saw something, they couldn’t understand, they would form their own biases until they made an effort to understand that thing and come to a reasonable conclusion.

The girls of Licheng Afterglow Island had been very clever. They had not forced Mo Fan to come to one conclusion. They had given him an incomplete truth and allowed him to form his own judgment while subtly steering him to judge in their favor.

...

At this time, Mo Fan couldn’t chase them. He needed to rush to the Northguard Fortress and warn them.

He summoned the Wings of Dusk and Dawn. A pair of black dragon wings full of ancient and noble aura stretched out from his back. With a light flap, the winds blew up, and waves surged.

“You go back,” said Mo Fan, opening a gap into the Contract Space.

Apas did not go back. She reached out and climbed on Mo Fan’s back between the space where the wings grew. She stretched her long, slender arms and held onto him. She wanted Mo Fan to fly with her on his back.

“You disturbed my nice, long sleep, so you have to keep me with you,” Apas said in his ear.

......

Apas’ figure was small so she would not interrupt when Mo Fan flapped his Black Dragon Wings.

How could such a slender body still have such a big, soft chest? Was it because of European blood, or was it a unique racial talent of Medusa? It was a pity that his not-so-sensitive back and shoulders got to touch them. He wondered how wonderful it would feel if it were his palms and head instead?

“You weren’t that easy to fool in the past, Big Brother Mo Fan.” Apas smiled. The bright sly smile was so in contrast to the fearful Apas from a while ago.

A Similar situation had happened in Egypt. Apas had almost deceived Mo Fan that time when she transformed from Medusa into a woman. In the end, Mo Fan had seen through it anyway. Apas had been so surprised at the time. She had not shown any flaws.

She glanced at the receding figures of those girls from Licheng Afterglow Island. Although some of them were very charming and beautiful, she did not think their beauty could compare to hers. So, how had they fooled Mo Fan?

‘Could it be that the women in foreign lands were more attractive than women at home for Mo Fan?’ she wondered. But that would still not be enough to fool him so easily.

Mo Fan was a sly person. It might be easy to deceive him if he had less experience or knowledge in certain matters. But it was hard to deceive him with just beautiful women and other legends. Otherwise, Apas would have fooled him long ago.

“Do you find it hard to accept that a group of women who are not as beautiful as you won against me?” asked Mo Fan.

Apas grumbled. All men were playboys anyway. They were fooled by beautiful faces and sweet words. She was too lazy to answer his question.

“People always change. Many things might change my views and judgment,” said Mo Fan.

“So, then what made you stupid?” asked Apas.

Mo fan slapped Apas’ little b*ttocks tightly. She was too slow to avoid it. She groaned softly. She was so embarrassed that she wanted to sink her snake teeth into his shoulders and poison the pervert.

Mo Fan was not stupid. He had felt that he was doing the right thing by helping them.

It was Zhang Xiaohou who influenced Mo Fan. He always insisted on confirming a bias before assuming things. In the process of verifying, he had hoped his bias would be wrong.But even while thinking positively, one needs to prepare oneself for other consequences.

“Apas, I would have risked anything to go to the military base in Egypt to save you. I helped those girls from Licheng Afterglow Island for the same reason. You are not so different from them. I tried to save you and them because I believe that good things exist. Even if evidence was glaring me right in the face, I hoped I could do the right thing,” explained Mo Fan.

“You always keep an ace up your sleeve toward me, huh?” Apas smiled coldly.

“I have no choice, femme fatale. You don’t have to feel uneasy. I did the same for those girls,” Mo Fan replied. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You keep an ace up your sleeve toward them as well. Do you even know how to find Licheng Afterglow Island?”

...

A pitch-black wing shadow swept across the wetlands full of reeds. The sea of ??reeds separated,and two grasslands that faced in opposite directions formed behind the trajectory.

God’s condemnation was too powerful. To avoid it, Mo Fan deliberately flew at a low altitude. The clouds above his head almost turned to pure black, and the terrifying thickness of the clouds seemed impossible to disperse. It might even take months.

Those lightning bolts often penetrate a hole in the black cloud. Less than five kilometers away from Mo Fan, one such hole looked like an abyss hanging upside down. The dense lightning appeared and disappeared simultaneously. Sometimes they were dark red, sometimes, white, and other times they looked like fireworks that illuminated the entire sky. They also reflected the small figure of Mo Fan flying parallel to the grass.

God’s condemnation was getting frantic. The ancient statues in Mingwu Ancient City might have been treasures left behind by ancient gods on that peaceful land. When someone stole them, everyone faced God’s wrath.

He had to reach the Northguard Fortress as soon as possible. If the lightning bolts penetrated the Northguard Fortress, they would wipe out the entire Northguard Fortress along with the people in the city!
