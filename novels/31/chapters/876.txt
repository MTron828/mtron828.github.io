Captain Feng’s cultivation was not too weak. Mu Ningxue wanted Mo Fan to stay further away, but she immediately sensed someone’s approaching.

Mu Ningxue did not have any ability to hide herself. Luckily, Mo Fan came closer in time and erased their presence with the Shadow Element. Otherwise, the captain of the City Hunters might notice their presence.

However, the two had to stick very close for the Shadow Element to work. Mo Fan was basically hugging her from behind. Mu Ningxue was already blushing from witnessing the eyesore, but Mo Fan, that asshole, jerk, perverted guy kept moving around...

“Please don’t be mad, I didn’t mean it, there are things that men can’t control, hehe!” Mo Fan did not show the slightest hint of apology. He was more like a successful thief with his act.

Mu Ningxue was helpless against such a shameless person. She snapped with a cold face, “No next time!”

A surge of frost went past Mo Fan, and he saw a little branch freezing into an ice stick. He felt a certain body part turning cold after witnessing it. Before he could react, a wind blew and shattered the branch into pieces. He subconsciously gasped.

“Let’s be serious, be serious...” Mo Fan felt extremely awkward. He quickly tried to fix the situation, “It seems like something happened here before. Carly is keen to hide it; I should ask Lingling to find what she’s trying to hide.”

“Mmm,” Mu Ningxue nodded.

“Do you think that Carly was being suspicious?” said Mo Fan.

“Yes,” said Mu Ningxue confidently.

“Why? You can’t say she’s suspicious just because she’s sacrificing herself to maintain the manor’s reputation?” Mo Fan was confused.

“Is your mind full of her naked body?” Mu Ningxue harrumphed coldly.

“Not at all, how can you think of me like that? There’s no chance other women can enter my mind when you’re around...” said Mo Fan in utter seriousness, leaving out the final bit, unless she’s naked.

Would Mu Ningxue believe his nonsense?

“It wasn’t the captain that noticed us first. It was Carly. She’s a Magician, otherwise, it’s impossible her senses were sharper than the captain’s. It’s so simple, can’t you tell?” Mu Ningxue immediately tore down Mo Fan’s lies.

“Ugh... my Xuexue is exceptionally intelligent indeed!” praised Mo Fan.

Mu Ningxue’s furious face was simply written with Piss Off !

After they returned to the main building, Mo Fan handed Lingling the soil.

Lingling soon went back to her room and used some basic equipment to find its composition. They would learn the truth in no time.

Mu Ningxue went back to her room. She did not mind stumbling into people having sex in the grove, but she had no choice but to throw her favorite black stockings that she just bought recently into the bin. She could no longer wear them after some perverted man rubbed against them!

How could he that shameless? How could anyone be so shameless!?

Mu Ningxue was about to take off her clothes to take a shower when there was a knock on her door.

She opened the door and saw the person was Zhao Pinlin. Mu Ningxue had already noticed the man trying to approach her. What the heck did he want knocking on her door late at night? She was incredibly annoyed after being harassed by Mo Fan. There was no way she would be in a good mood when she saw the scum.

Why did she call Zhao Pinlin scum?

Very simple, it was so obvious that Zhao Pinlin wanted to earn the affection of the girl called Wang Xuxu through the trip he organized. However, the guy tried to find all kinds of excuses to approach her instead. He even came to knock on her door... scum, just like that asshole Mo Fan!

“What do you want?” asked Mu Ningxue impatiently.

“Oh, nothing, I wanted to ask you whether you enjoy watching the stars. I just saw an observation tower on the highest floor. The view was spectacular. It would be a pity to miss it, but it’s quite meaningless to enjoy it on my own,” said Zhao Pinlin.

Mu Ningxue rested her hand on the door. She turned and looked outside the window.

Zhao Pinlin also took a look and saw the clouds in the sky, not even half a star was visible.

The lie collapsed instantly. Mu Ningxue directly said, “I’m heading to bed.” She closed the door.

The door almost hit Zhao Pinlin’s nose. He looked at the tightly shut door, and his proud heart was immediately filled with rage.

He turned around and headed for the bar in a bad mood.

“Mr. Zhao, do you need anything?” asked a waitress with a red bowtie.

“Just give me a drink,” growled Zhao Pinlin.

After taking a few sips, Zhao Pinlin felt bored. He asked the waitress over and said, “Go to the second floor and ask the girl called Wang Xuxu down. Tell her I’m waiting for her here.”

“Oh, sure.”

The waitress was just about to leave when Zhao Pinlin rose to his feet and said, “Forget it, I’ll go myself. Just prepare the place, make it look more romantic.”

“Not a problem, sir.”

Zhao Pinlin went to the second floor.

He spent some time tidying himself, so the others would not see him angry and annoyed.

He forced a smile and reached out his hand to knock on Wang Xuxu’s door...

His hand stopped in the air as the door happened to be opening too. He immediately saw the familiar face of a man!

“Zhao Pinlin? Are you looking for Wang Xuxu?” Rong Sheng had an honest smile.

“You... why are you in her room? Did she let you in?” Zhao Pinlin was dumbfounded.

Zhao Pinlin immediately saw the button on Rong Sheng’s collars undone. Besides, the man had just come out from Wang Xuxu’s room at this time. No matter how stupid Zhao Pinlin was, he did not need to guess what had just happened inside the room!

Zhao Pinlin was enraged. He never thought the arrangements he made would be in this stupid Rong Sheng’s favor instead, and this fool even dared to lay hands on his first target, Wang Xuxu!

In Zhao Pinlin’s opinion, a man like Rong Sheng could only pick up chicks like Guo Wenyi!

The shock almost drove Zhao Pinlin mad.

He shoved Rong Sheng away fiercely and headed straight back to the bar!

“Asshole, asshole, asshole!” Zhao Pinlin was losing his mind.

He could not get his hands on the stunning Mu Ningxue, and he lost his chance with a beauty like Wang Xuxu. He spent lots of money and connections just to organize the gathering, but it had turned out like this!

Zhao Pinlin downed his drinks rapidly.

He was the only one left in the bar. Any person could easily tell the rage he was in.

The waitress with a red bowtie wore a cunning smile when she saw the man’s reaction. She slowly walked up to him and said, “Why don’t I keep you company?”

The waitress had untied her hair and took off her bowtie. Her half-curled brown hair draped over her shoulder. She suddenly looked a lot prettier. On top of that, the top three buttons on her chest were undone, hinting at her cleavage. She was not totally unrestrained, but not completely preserved, either!

Zhao Pinlin felt rather annoyed. He was not so desperate as to hook up with a waitress, yet he was stunned when he saw her transformation.

“I’ve met you before, you’re quite a regular here. You aren’t a bad man, but it seems like you’re having trouble making things right. Why don’t we have a chat? Maybe I can fulfill your dreams... I assume you’ve heard some rumors here... about, making your dreams come true,” the waitress wore a charming, yet somewhat wicked grin.
