“Where are the others?” Mo Fan asked.

“Something went wrong,” Mu Bai went back to the topic he had mentioned before.

“Was that old soldier Chen Shuo responsible for it?” Mo Fan asked grimly.

“No, not him; it was Chief Zhu Qi, of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union. He brought his men here and placed Old Zhao and the others under their control. Miss Tangyue is in their hands too,” Mu Bai said.

“Under their control? In their hands? Are you sure they are from the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, instead of an organization like the Black Vatican?” Mo Fan was confused.

“Not only did they come to the island with ease, they also knew about the secret passage from the emergency outpost to the domestication ranch that only Chen Shuo knew about. Who do you think was conducting the experiments here ten years ago?” Mu Bai said.

“The chief of Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union is one of them?” Mo Fan blurted out in surprise.

“More or less, or he wouldn’t come here purposely and keep us on the island. I initially thought he was going to bring us back so we don’t get ourselves in trouble, but Lingling saw through his intentions. I ran away as soon as I realized something wasn’t right. I thought I could regroup with you first, so that we could save them together, but I don’t think that’s possible after seeing your condition,” Mu Bai said.

“How bold is Zhu Qi? Is he really going to silence us by killing us on the island? Miss Tangyue is the vice chief, I don’t think he dares to harm her!” Mo Fan swore.

No matter how much of a local tyrant Zhu Qi was as the Chief of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, he would not dare to do something so outrageous!

“I think he was going to place us into custody and release us after following procedures, but his son Zhu Min has died in an accident. He’s currently out of his mind. I’m worried he might bring us down with him!” Mu Bai admitted.

The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union would no longer be responsible after the incident was passed up to the higher level. It would also bury the past. Headquarters would send someone over to deal with the situation without putting the blame on him. Zhu Qi was planning to drag things on until his higher-ups decided to send Super Mages over to wipe out the island. The truth behind the incident would then sink with the island.

To his surprise, Mo Fan and his crew had gone to Dawn Island with Tangyue. The facilities on the island were well preserved. They could easily find out who the people who were managing the domestication ranch in the past were. Zhu Qi was obviously not going to let Tangyue, Mo Fan, and the others bring that information back!

“How did that Zhu Min die?” Mo Fan asked.

“He was whipped to death by a breaking chain. Even though I’m sorry for his death, I really don’t understand how an Advanced Mage could die like that,” Mu Bai said.

“Ugh...” Mo Fan was left speechless. It seemed like he was somehow responsible for Zhu Min’s death, too... 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, it was definitely not his fault. These people had obviously come to trouble them. Mo Fan was not the kind to feel guilty over the death of someone insignificant.

That being said, Zhu Qi was obviously going to hold him responsible for his son’s death!

“It will take some time to cure your poison. They have moved everyone to the emergency outpost. We have to figure out a way to save them,” Mu Bai said.

“How strong is that Zhu Qi?” Mo Fan asked.

“Very strong. Miss Tangyue didn’t stand a chance against him,” Mu Bai sighed.

Normally, a vice chief was either someone with outstanding capabilities as a leader or a Super Mage, but an Enforcer Chief was definitely a Super Mage. If Tangyue had lost so easily, it was unlikely Mo Fan and Mu Bai could defeat Zhu Qi with just the two of them.

“It’s already morning. The Featherless Birds have claimed the sea around the island. They will have to wait until it’s dark before they can leave the island the same way we came,” Mo Fan said.

“Mm, Zhu Qi is a Super Ice Mage too,” Mu Bai agreed.

“We still have some time, then,” Mo Fan said.

“The poison will be neutralized in about two hours, but your injuries... Are you sure you’re going to be fine by nightfall?” Mu Bai asked worriedly.

Mo Fan had a lot of injuries on him. The loss of blood alone was enough to weaken him significantly!

“I can recover pretty quickly. Let’s hope that Zhu Qi hasn’t gone mad,” Mo Fan stated. He did need some time to rest and prepare himself to face Zhu Qi, however.

“He won’t do anything reckless before getting his hands on us,” Mu Bai agreed.

Zhu Qi would not dare to harm Tangyue. Similarly, he would not have the guts to harm the others, considering their backgrounds, unless he could make sure that no one knew what he had done on the island.

Therefore, Zhu Qi could either find Mo Fan and Mu Bai first, and then silence them all, or he could keep Tangyue and the others under custody and drag the situation on until it was over. By then, even if Tangyue, Mo Fan, and the others knew he was responsible for the mess at the island, there was nothing they could do to him. He could explain he was only placing Tangyue into custody to prevent her from complicating matters.

“We need to lure Zhu Qi away and destroy the emergency outpost, exposing the people of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union to the Manta Ray Evil Birds. We’ll then be able to save the others amid the chaos,” Mo Fan said.

“Mo Fan, there are only two of us. How can we possibly handle so many things at once? Who’s going to lure Zhu Qi away? Who’s going to destroy the emergency outpost? Who then is going to escort the others to safety and protect them since their magic will be Sealed away? Destroying the emergency outpost might expose the people of the Enforcement Union to the Manta Ray Evil Birds, but it will also place the others’ lives in danger when they can’t use their magic!” Mu Bai said. He thought Mo Fan was going to come up with a flawless plan, yet it turned out to be so unreliable.

“Who told you there are only the two of us?” Mo Fan raised his brows.

Following his words, an alluring figure came into the cave.

“Apas?” Mu Bai blurted out in surprise.

“How did it end up in such a mess!?” Apas grumbled.

“Says you? Why didn’t you protect them when they were taken away?” Mo Fan snarled.

“I’m not good at fighting. Besides, I would just have ended up like them if I showed myself,” Apas claimed.

“Fine, you always have a lot of excuses. Mu Bai will be luring Zhu Qi away, I’ll destroy the emergency outpost while you protect the others and get rid of the Seal on their minds,” Mo Fan allocated the jobs.

Both Mu Bai and Apas shook their heads.

“I’ll destroy the emergency outpost and lure the enraged Manta Ray Evil Birds to it,” Apas corrected him.

“I can protect them during the chaos,” Mu Bai agreed.

“...”

Mo Fan suddenly realized he had to do all the dirty and strenuous work for every team he was in! Did they forget he was already poisoned and injured?
