1338 The Cold Prince of the Mediterranean Sea

It was easy to eavesdrop on normal magic transmission equipment. Many members of the Enforcement Union were working as spies, so they would rarely use normal magic transmission equipment to pass important information around. To ensure that orders received were reliable, Elders of the Enforcement Union had to deliver them personally, and each Elder had their own encryption code.

If the message being delivered was encrypted by an Elder, it showed the importance of the message, especially information related to the Black Vatican. Many members of the Black Vatican lurked in the cities. It was impossible to identify them unless they exposed themselves. Therefore, it was extremely important to encrypt the messages!

The process was complicated, but it was the safest way of transmitting important messages when going against the Black Vatican.

The secret code kept changing. Only the designated Receiver of each Enforcement Union would know the secret code to decrypt messages. When an Elder wanted to pass on an important message that could not afford to be intercepted or eavesdropped on, they would deliver the secret message to set up a meeting with the Receiver of a local Enforcement Union.

Things were a lot simpler after meeting with the Receiver. The information would be relayed straight back to headquarters; only people with the ranks of Councilman and above had access to the information. There was no way the information could be intercepted and eavesdropped on. If there was any important evidence, like lists of names or objects, the Receiver would activate a portal and transfer the important evidence to a specific department that only Councilmen had access to.

The Enforcers relayed most of their information back to the Enforcement Union with normal communication methods. After all, they were currently in the Magic Technology Era. It was not as complicated as delivering messages with pigeons in ancient times. However, it was necessary to come up with a way to deliver important messages, especially when they were up against the Black Vatican. They never knew if the person they were telling the information to was a member of the Black Vatican. It was extremely difficult to learn if a person was a spy from the Black Vatican!

Lingling was familiar with the process of sending confidential information. Therefore, when she asked Leng Qing to send the message, not only was she using the traitor to lure Bei Jiang out of hiding, she was planning to take out a traitor that had long infiltrated the Enforcement Union, too!

“From the looks of it, the traitor is most likely taking orders from the Cold Prince. Therefore, we didn’t get rid of him when we were annihilating Salan’s henchmen,” Lingling said.

They had gotten rid of Salan’s influence in the country, including the low-ranking Gray Priests and the higher-ranking Blue Deacons. Salan had gathered everyone under her orders during the Calamity of the Ancient Capital. She had even summoned her henchmen who were hiding in the Ancient Capital to enjoy the festival she had prepared for them. As a result, her henchmen were all taken out because of it.

Despite that, they were only members of the Black Vatican under Salan’s leadership. Who knew if the other Red Cardinals had planted their own chess pieces in the country, too?

“My sister always thought the traitor was under Salan’s command. It allowed the traitor to remain in hiding for so long,” Lingling explained.

“Yeah, I didn’t expect that, either! Who exactly is this Cold Prince?” Mo Fan asked her

“I have heard things about the Cold Prince,” Zhao Manyan spoke up. He would occasionally visit other countries, thus he had heard rumors about things there. “The Cold Prince is active in the Mediterranean Sea. His main influence is in countries to the south of the Mediterranean. No one has ever seen his true face, but rumors say he has purple eyes.”

“Purple eyes... that’s a very distinctive feature, but then again, there are lots of people who wear colored contact lenses to pretend they look cool. It won’t be easy to find him if that’s the only clue we have. Besides, if I was the Cold Prince, I’d be wearing contact lenses of different colors,” Mo Fan said.

“Yeah, this Cold Prince is the same as Salan...” Zhao Manyan agreed.

“Same? He’s a woman?” Mo Fan asked.

“No, the Cold Prince is a man; we know that at least. I’m referring to their style of approach, the way they bring fear to the world. Some of the Red Cardinals possess insane strength and cultivation, so even the Holy Judgment Court would not stand a chance against them. Those who are good at conspiring and making necessary arrangements to achieve their plans aren’t that much stronger than us, and yet, the experts willing to take their orders, and their cunning, are much scarier than the Red Cardinals with outstanding strength,” Zhao Manyan stated.

Mo Fan agreed with Zhao Manyan.

As a matter of fact, Salan might not even stand a chance against the Enforcement Union. The Enforcement Union could easily send an expert to crush them, but they were good at concealing their identities and executing conspiracies.

The Ancient Capital had existed for thousands of years. Normally, it would require several armies to destroy it. Even if the Black Vatican had ten times more members than it currently had, it would still struggle to take down the walls of the Ancient Capital...

Magic might be scary, but an outstanding talent for bringing destruction and committing crimes certain people possessed were even more terrifying. The only thing that could destroy humanity were humans themselves!

“So you’re saying that the Cold Prince is plotting something, something similar to Salan’s conspiracy that led to the Calamity of the Ancient Capital?” Mo Fan asked in a deep voice.

Leng Qing had risked her life just to bring the information back. If that conspiracy had made the life of an Elder of the Enforcement Union so fragile, there was no way it was going to be just a little scuffle!

“In the past, the Cold Prince’s reputation actually exceeded Salan’s... I mean infamy. However, since the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, criminals across the world have been worshiping Salan as their god, treating her as their role model for bringing destruction upon this world. Therefore, even though Salan was forced to flee to other countries like a beaten dog and her influence in China has been completely wiped out by the Enforcement Union, as long as she’s alive, she has plenty of chances to make a comeback. Many deviants are willing to submit themselves to her, wanted criminals will join her, and psychopaths will take orders from her...” Zhao Manyan said.

The truth had always been cruel. Mo Fan was deeply troubled by Zhao Manyan’s words.

Salan’s festival at the Ancient Capital was, in fact, still a great success for her. The lives that were lost were like sacrifices offered to build her throne at the top of the world, so all the maniacs and psychopaths across the world could see her brilliance as a Goddess of Death...

Now that he thought about it, if Salan was truly defeated back then and forced to flee by the Enforcement Union, why would she bother showing up so blatantly at the Parthenon Temple?

She was getting more powerful. She no longer had to hide in the dark. She just stood in the plaza of the sacred Parthenon Temple and told everyone that she was Salan. She blatantly took what she came for, killed the people she wanted to kill, and disappeared without a trace...

Perhaps someone like her was indeed worthy to be called a goddess?
