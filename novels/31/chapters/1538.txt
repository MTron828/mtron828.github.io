Chapter 1539 Little Beauty

Chad’s attempt to lure the demon creatures away with his Summoned Beast had taught the group a viable approach for the operation. They had purposely caught a lot of Sunset Demon Mice and trapped them all inside a cave before coming to the Sunset Shrine.

The group followed the trail of fluorescent powder and soon reached the cave where the Sunset Demon Mice were trapped.

“Quick, Ferrero, give me your precious heirloom!” Mu Bai said.

Ferrero unwillingly took out the remaining Magical Dew and poured it on the Sunset Demon Mice.

These Sunset Demon Mice, who usually fed on remains of undead, were soon fleeing aimlessly through the Sunset Valley while emitting an alluring scent.

Sunset Valley was crawling with snake demons, not just the Silver Snake Warriors. There were countless snake mountains, too. If every snake species was attracted by the scent, it would turn into the greatest chase scene ever in the Sunset Valley!

The snakes heavily relied on their sense of smell. The group could temporarily conceal their scent, yet it was impossible to remain hidden for too long. Therefore, using the demon mice to distract the demon snakes was the best option they had!

Each demon mouse carrying the smell of the Magical Dew could attract hundreds of demon snakes. The group would have a chance to escape as long as they were not surrounded by demon creatures!

“What now?” Galba seemed quite nervous.

It was Galba’s first time doing something so thrilling. He was so nervous that he was going to wet his pants. It was difficult to imagine how the group of students that initially came here for training was now catching a young Medusa in their own backyard!

“They don’t know we are here. Let’s hold our position and let them chase after the demon mice for now,” Chad said.

Chad was sweating bullets, too. He was only an Intermediate Mage, yet he had risked his life and come here with the others. Even a single Silver Snake Warrior could kill him easily. However, if he made it back alive, he could easily boast about it to his friends for the rest of his life!

The cave was initially the demon mice’s nest. A pungent rotting smell lingered there after Mo Fan and the others had invaded it, perfect for concealing their scent. The Silver Snake Warriors would be attracted by the special scent that the demon mice were trailing after they lost sight of the group, and hopefully be tricked into believing that the demon mice were the humans that kidnapped the young Medusa.

The Silver Snake Warriors had overwhelming numbers, especially in the vicinity of the Sunset Shrine. If Mo Fan’s group did not use a little trick, they would end up being surrounded by the snake demons. Therefore, their best option was to wait at the most dangerous place until the snake demons were gone, increasing their odds of leaving in one piece.

“Should we get the tears from the young Medusa first?” Ferrero asked impatiently.

It was his first time seeing a Ruler-level creature that was still alive. He wondered how much the young Medusa would worth if he auctioned it!

“Let’s wait, the snake demons might be able to pick up the young Medusa’s scent,” Zoey demurred.

The young Medusa was still in the Man-Eating Flower’s stomach, helpless and completely vulnerable. Their first priority was to escape from the snake demons!

The group had no choice but to wait inside the cave until the snake demons lost their calm.

—

“Gur...” a strange sound broke the silence in the underground cave.

“There’s something here, look out!” Ferrero immediately rose to his feet. He looked around him nervously.

“Sor...sorry, it...it’s my stomach growling...” Apas said softly, blushing.

Mo Fan finally realized Apas must have not eaten for a long time. He quickly gave her some food that he kept in his personal Space after warming the food in his palm. An aromatic smell soon replaced the foul odors in the cave.

Apas had not eaten for a few days. She fixed her eyes on the food, drolling as soon as she picked up the scent.

“Here,” Mo Fan gave Apas the food.

Apas was too embarrassed to eat in front of the group. She hid behind Mo Fan and dug her head into the food like a starving little cat.

“Where did you find her?” Vani asked with a confused face.

“In a run-down structure close to the young Medusa. That reminds me, there are a bunch of evil Mages serving the young Medusa. I don’t know what they are up to, but we should be careful,” Mo Fan said when he recalled what Apas told him.

“Why would anyone serve the demon creatures? Aren’t they worried they might be eaten!?” Sofia said.

“There are all kinds of maniacs in this world. I wonder if they know we have caught the young Medusa. We are in danger if they are still around,” Mo Fan murmured.

“The young Medusa feeds on little girls’ hearts to maintain her youth and beautiful appearance. Many cities have the same folk tales about it. I always thought it was something that the older generations had come up with to advise young girls not to go out alone, but it’s actually real... the worst thing is, it’s actually humans like us doing it!” Chad was enraged too.

Apas finished eating while the others were discussing the topic. She wiped her lips with the dirty sleeves on her clothes.

Heidi took pity on her. She took out some clean clothes from her Space Ring and gave them to Apas so she could change into them.

Apas changed into the fresh clothes with Heidi’s help, and also washed her face.

The girl who had looked like a little beggar immediately turned into a foreign little beauty with an outstanding appearance. She seemed to have the lineage of Greeks and the European countries to the north of the Aegean Sea; smooth olive skin, tall nose, and a small but good-looking mouth. Her facial features were very natural. She was surely going to be a great beauty that could easily make a man’s heart race in a few years! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It would be a waste if such a beauty was eaten by the young Medusa!

“By the way, Apas, do you remember what the people that kidnapped you looked like?” Mo Fan asked.

Apas shook her head. She said with a soft voice, “I only remember their outfits.”

“It feels like the Silver Snake Warriors have spread out,” Sofia said.

“Should we wait a little longer?” Galba said.

“We can’t afford to wait any longer. These snake demons are not complete idiots. They are going to realize that we’ve lured them away with the demon mice. We have to go now, and head to the place where we stumbled into the snake mountain. It’s a lot safer to return to Cairo City along that path,” Old Chad said.

“Got it, let’s set out at once.”

The others rose to their feet, no longer cowering in the corner. They fled in the direction of the long defensive ravine in front of Cairo City.

The direction they were planning to take had a lower density of demon creatures. Their chance of making it back to the city alive solely depended on whether the snake demons were going to find them or not!
