Mo Fan witnessed the Golden Sun Combat Officer’s demeanor throughout the incident. In the end, forty-one Blue Star Knights were dismissed. Their Combat Officer Lido was dismissed too, for failing to teach his students to obey the rules of conduct for the knightly Order!

The Hall of Knights did not have a lot of members. There was quite a huge vacancy when forty-two members were dismissed.

The authorities realized they were unable to change Norman’s mind, and they were well aware of his temper. They could only think of other ways to make up for it, despite their anger and resentment.

The Blue Star Knights were the fresh blood of the Hall of Knights. Norman had already started selecting new members!

The remaining Blue Star Knights were trembling in fear after witnessing how the ambitious disciples of the renowned clans were dismissed in such a short period of time. They immediately focused on their training and cultivation, afraid of being caught by Norman after overstepping the bounds. Even the gods could not save them if that happened!

After the meeting was dismissed, Izisha purposely walked in Mo Fan’s direction and glared at him for a few seconds.

Norman was Wen Tai’s adopted son, which meant he was also Izisha’s nephew. His reputation in the Parthenon Temple was only second to Wen Tai, so Izisha knew there was no good falling out with such a reputable man. She ended up directing all her anger at Mo Fan.

Xinxia might suffer losses too, but Izisha was troubled because she had to explain what happened to the renowned clans in Europe!

“Someone like you should really be condemned to eternal damnation!” Izisha said to Mo Fan, flinging her sleeves.

Nowadays, most people would only do things that would benefit them. Izisha would overdo it a little, as the things she did would often harm others in addition to benefiting herself. It would grant her two steps of advantage over her opponents, but someone like Mo Fan, who not only harmed others but himself too, was simply a maniac! It was better for someone who constantly brought pestilence like him to die as soon as possible!

Mo Fan kept an innocent face.

The knights had provoked him first, he was simply teaching them a lesson. It was Norman’s fault for complicating matters. How was it even his fault? Mo Fan had no idea whose side the Blue Star Knights were on before the fight!

“Ugh... my lady, you should spend more time with Mo Fan. I’ll clean up the mess for you,” Tata spoke up.

“Oh, oh... mm, okay...” Xinxia did not understand what Tata meant at first, but she realized what Tata was implying when she saw the look on her mentor’s face.

Tata was seriously scared of what Mo Fan might do. The man just kept stirring up trouble wherever he went. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Luckily, Izisha had suffered great losses from this too...

Tata believed it was better for Xinxia to put some insignificant matters aside and spend more time with Mo Fan than letting the ticking time bomb wander around in the Parthenon Temple as he pleased. Gods knew when he was going to detonate himself and blow everyone up!

“Brother Mo Fan, you seriously didn’t change a bit,” Xinxia said as she returned to the Hall of the Goddess with Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was not allowed to enter Xinxia’s residence in the Hall of the Goddess. They usually stayed in the house with a sea view.

“Why? Are you blaming me for bringing you trouble?” Mo Fan raised his brows like he was displeased.

Xinxia giggled. She recalled what Tata had said before she left and told Mo Fan the same thing.

“What did that old hag mean by that? Was she asking you to keep an eye on me? I’m a man, do I even need someone to look after me? Would I beat the crap out of them if they didn’t provoke me first?” Mo Fan snarled.

“Norman’s return might be a good thing for the Hall of Knights,” Xinxia went on.

“Isn’t he Asha’ruiya’s brother?” Mo Fan suddenly remembered something.

“Yeah, but do you think he’s the kind to lean toward Asha’ruiya just because she’s his sister, judging from his behavior today?” Xinxia asked.

“That’s true. By the way, he did mention that he approves of the path you’re taking. It’s more fitting to the Parthenon Temple’s beliefs. You can ask him for help if you are in any trouble. He’s a trustworthy person,” Mo Fan told her.

“I think so too!” Xinxia nodded.

Losing the factions that the Blue Star Knights on her side were from was insignificant compared to earning Norman’s support.

Xinxia had saved Norman’s life, but it was difficult to understand his personality. If he continued to wander around outside the Temple like he was doing before, he would not be of any help to Xinxia, even if she had his support.

However, now that Norman had decided to take over the Hall of Knights, he would be on her side as long as she stuck to her original intentions. She had claimed another huge asset in her fight against Izisha!

“Brother Mo Fan!” Xinxia accentuated her voice when she noticed something happen after she was still thinking deeply.

“What?”

“We haven’t gone inside yet!”

“It’s fine, I already looked around, there isn’t anyone nearby...”

Xinxia began to regret it. She should not have listened to Mo Fan’s instigation and did the embarrassing thing outdoors. Ever since then, Mo Fan would reach his hands into someplace he was not supposed to regardless of the location. She had no chance of stopping him.

“Didn’t we still have a few days left?” Xinxia said with a blushing face. She seriously did not understand why Mo Fan was being so impatient.

Xinxia thought Mo Fan was being impatient, but that was not the case.

He was just after the thrill!

It was oddly exciting to do it in certain places!

Did people really think the couple who did it in the fitting room could not afford a room in a hotel?

The Parthenon Temple had many remote spots with great scenery. The place provided Mo Fan with countless potential venues to commit his crimes.

“Xinxia, don’t you think it’s romantic to do a little exercise while watching the stars?” Mo Fan suggested.

“Brother Mo Fan, it’s still bright out!” Xinxia said with puffed cheeks.

What romantic? There should be a ceiling when they were doing that thing! The curtains must be pulled, and it should be done on a bed at night... who the heck would even want to watch the stars!?

“Oh, I meant watching the clouds. Look at the sky, the clouds are so white, like your skin...” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan’s instigation did not work. Xinxia strongly believed they could not do the naughty thing during the day.

“Fine, we’ll do it inside,” Mo Fan compromised.

“It has to be in the bedroom!” Xinxia added as she remembered something. She was already blushing.

“Fine!” Mo Fan grumbled. The cunning flicker in his eyes vanished.

It was indeed unwise to leave Xinxia at the Parthenon Temple. She had become a lot smarter. His evil thoughts had no place in the light of her wisdom!
