The Mind Maze had crumbled on its own after being struck by an external force. It was like a fast asleep man waking up from a dream because of a loud noise.

By the time Mo Fan came to his senses, the Exploding Star Fist was right in front of his face.

He immediately faded into the shadows like a phantom, entering another dimension and making him invulnerable to the attack.

It was a waste to use the Phantom Slink like this, but he did not have a better choice as his enemy had the upper hand at first.

Most importantly, Apas had successfully disrupted the enemy’s Space Magic Formation!

Old Santel knew time was of the essence. Why would Mo Fan not realize it, too?

MO Fan knew there was a strong Psychic Mage on the mountain after he saw the Wall of Fear. Since he knew he would not be able to avoid the Psychic Mage’s detecting him, he blatantly exposed himself while letting Apas do her thing.

If Old Santel had remained close to the Magic Formation, Apas might have struggled to find an opening.

“I don’t like being fancy, either. I would rather settle it the easy way, by using my fists instead of my brain!” MO Fan swung his arms around after dodging the enemy’s punch.

“Old Santel says you are very strong, but perhaps he’s losing confidence because he’s getting too old. Doctors like to make a patient’s condition sound worse than it is so the patient will pay more attention to them!” The pattern of a bear in front of Yangel’s chest erupted into flames.

MO Fan could not help but fix his eyes on the golden flames of the burning pattern.

A golden bear suddenly sprang out of the flames and pounced at MO Fan. It pinned him hard to the ground.

His arms, face, and necks were rapidly covered in burns. He quickly turned into shadow birds and scattered across the place, just like a vampire turning into a swarm of bats.

The bear seemed to know which bird was the real MO Fan. It immediately chased after one of the shadow birds and lunged at it.

“Order Manipulation!”

MO Fan swiftly manipulated the natural order and replaced himself with a fake shadow bird.

The enraged bear bit at the shadow bird, but it dissipated in the form of a black mist. The bear immediately turned around with burning eyes!

MO Fan created some space between him and the bear. He realized the bear was actually Yangel covered in golden flames after he took a

closer look at it. The man had transformed into a bear, and his fists had turned into claws. Not only did his speed rise significantly, he was as powerful as a beast now!

“How does it taste? My Sacred Bear Blood is better than those boring tricks!” Yangel grinned wildly.

MO Fan checked his wounds. They were not deep, but he could feel them burning.

The blood on his wounds had clotted. MO Fan hesitated briefly, deciding on the approach he was going to take.

MO Fan had three ways of fighting at close quarters. The first one was to let his blood spread on the ground to transform into the Heavy Armored Stance with his Heaven-grade Earth Seed. It would grant him incredible power in its Absolute Domain, the Kingdom of Sand.

The second way was transforming into the King of Hell. Both his Fire Seed and Little Flame Belle had grown a lot stronger recently. Even MO Fan had no idea how strong the King of Hell form was. MO Fan would excel at both close combat and ranged battle in that form.

The third way was by equipping the Black Dragon Set, which he had never had the chance to use.

The Black Dragon Sleeves made with the Black Dragon Claws could be used as fists and claws. Together with his Space Element, Shadow Element, Chaos Element, and Earth Element, he would turn into a deadly assassin capable of taking out the enemy’s commander even while being surrounded by the enemy.

The Heavy Armored Stance, Judgment; he had not bled a lot, and the environment was not suitable either.

As for the King of Hell form, it might be overkill.

He decided to try out the Black Dragon Set to test its strength.

“Black Dragon Set!”

MO Fan Summoned every piece of the Black Dragon Set, except for the Wings of Dawn and Dusk. The imperious Black Dragon Helmet, Black Dragon Sleeves, and Black Dragon Boots immediately covered him. He had put on a full set of black armor with a unique sheen.

Yangel’s transformation into a Sacred Flame Bear was quite impressive. MO Fan had looked like a deer waiting to be slaughtered in front of him.

However, the Black Dragon Emperor’s Aura easily overwhelmed Yangel’s flames as its dragon soul circled MO Fan. The smirk on Yangel’s face immediately disappeared!

The Black Dragon Set was even more impressive than the Sacred Armor Yangel had seen his enemies wearing in northern Europe. The Aura of Death the dragon soul was giving off made the bear look like a cowardly dog playing in a pool of mud!

“There’s no way your magic Equipment is comparable to my Golden Bear Lineage. I’m going to tear your Armor into pieces!” Yangel snarled.

Bears were noble animals of strength and beauty in northern Europe. Yangel was extremely proud of his ability to transform into a bear.

He enjoyed competing with other ancient clans with the metamorphosis ability, too. The Sacred Bears were the best in terms of strength and aesthetics!

But… Yangel had to admit the black Armor attached to his opponent like an ancient black dragon looked even more impressive!

Its sheen, its material, its lines, and its delicate horns and decorations… He had to smash the Armor into pieces!

It was nothing but show to him!

“Sacred Bear Explosive Claws!”

Yangel was hot-tempered just like a bear. He did not have to use any magic to increase his speed. The blood burning inside him was the source of his power. The golden flames engulfed him like a full set of Armor.

The Sacred Bear charged at MO Fan like a golden flame. He did not swing his claws around wildly. It was a simple hit using brute force!

The claw struck MO Fan’s chest and sent him sliding, gouging a huge ravine across the ground.

“Break!” Yangel ordered, and the Claw Mark on MO Fan’s chest immediately exploded.

The explosion knocked MO Fan flying a great distance.

The Black Dragon Scales were immune to magic, but it was still vulnerable to physical damage. The explosion of the Golden Claw Mark was imbued with the power of an ancient beast, so the Black Dragon Scales were not immune to it.

However, the immunity was only an additional effect from the Black Dragon Soul. The Armor alone possessed outstanding durability. It had fully absorbed the shock and force MO Fan had received, leaving him unharmed!.
