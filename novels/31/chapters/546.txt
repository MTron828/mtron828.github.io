“Fiery Fist!”

Same move, same magic, Mo Fan was trying to return the shameless Dongfang Lie’s favor with the same attack!

His decision seemed rather idiotic to everyone. Dongfang Lie’s innate talent basically guaranteed he would dominate others of the same level. No one would dare try to overwhelm his spell head-on.

His Fiery Fist was pretty much the strongest in the entire Pearl Institute, an unstoppable move. Even a whole team would be crushed by it, let alone a single person.

If Mo Fan was seriously fighting back with Fiery Fist, even if he managed to survive it, he would still be turned into a cripple from the blast!

After all, Dongfang Lie had attacked first. The fiery dragons had already surrounded Mo Fan from different directions. The crowd could only see the tails of the dragons as they rolled over his position, there was no chance they could see the miniscule Mo Fan within.

Fire clouds rose into the air. Even Bai Yulang and the others not far away were forced to set up their defenses to protect themselves from the leaking energy of the Fiery Fist.

Despite the distance, they could feel the overwhelming heat from the Spell, let alone Mo Fan, who was in the middle of the fiery dragons!

The crowd’s eyes widened as the spell landed on its target.

They did not see Mo Fan set up his defense right before he was devoured by the flames. Even though Fire was his Primary Element, his resistance alone was not enough to make any difference.

—

The burning ground left the crowd in bewilderment, but a few seconds later, another imperious presence of fire erupted within Dongfang Lie’s flames!

It was blazing red!

It looked similar to the Rose Flame which Mo Fan always used, yet its color was brighter, like the color of blood!

The crowd could vaguely see a figure seemingly fresh out of the furnace within the flames. The bloody flames began to lunge at the gray-red flames nearby!

The shadow of the fist burst forward like an arrow firing through the fog and swept them away, returning a clear view to the place...

There were neither fiery pillars nor fire dragons. The blood-colored flames accumulated on the tip of the punch and burst forward. Despite the large area of the gray-red flames, the bright red hue remained the same, penetrating everything in the way...

It was like a meteor sweeping across the sky, a meteorite that had broken into the atmosphere!

Perhaps the attack could no longer be called Fiery Fist, but Meteorite Fist instead!

Mo Fan’s roar slowly overtook the howling of the flames. The bright red flames engulfing his body had completely evaporated Dongfang Lie’s fire!

Yes, evaporated!

When a different source of fire was so strong, it would simply crush the weaker flames.

As Dongfang Lie’s Ash Flame was evaporated by the Rose Flame, the entire dueling ground turned as red as blood. Mo Fan, who was standing right in the center was still engulfed in flames. The color of his skin was inhuman!

The strength of the Demon King was truly unstoppable! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Zhao Manyan, who had been worried about Mo Fan, immediately recalled the scene where Mo Fan was possessed by the Fiery Sorceress.

Mo Fan looked exactly the same now. If the Fiery Sorceress had the ability to possess him, did that mean the little Flame Belle could do the same thing, too?!

It’s the little Flame Belle, it must be her!

Being possessed by the little Flame Belle had boosted the power of his Fire Element!

Dongfang Lie thought his fourth-tier Fiery Fist was able to dominate the scene, but little did he know, Mo Fan, who had earned the favor of the creature born from the Fire Calamity, was the real domina of Fire!

Dongfang Ming had messed with the wrong person!

The Meteorite Fist was extremely fast. The sequence had only lasted for a few seconds, including Mo Fan being devoured by the fire, his Rose Flame evaporating the fires, and him throwing the Meteorite Fist at Dongfang Lie.

Dongfang Lie simply stood there, completely dumbstruck...

His eyes were filled with astonishment, fear, and disbelief!

He had always been proud of his strength, but his Fiery Fist was simply quenched, his fiery dragons were punctured. Most terrifyingly, the person’s Meteorite Fist was flying right at him, trailing a spectacular fire tail.

The Meteorite Fist landed on Dongfang Lie’s shield and armor. The two pieces of defensive Equipment were completely destroyed by the overwhelming force. They broke into pieces, scattering on the ground.

Dongfang Lie’s body stiffened. The next second, he was blasted away by the force, as if a missile had just hit his abdomen, spitting out mouthfuls of blood in the air.

A red arc was drawn in the sky as Dongfang Lie was sent flying, leaving the crowd speechless.

In the end, Dongfang Lie was caught by the soft barrier, and slid down it like a boneless puppet. His hair was disheveled as he landed on the ground.

He struggled to his feet and raised his head. His gaze toward the man on fire was filled with pain, humiliation, astonishment, and disbelief.

“One or two rounds...” Zhou Shuming was stunned, and totally forgot to help his friend up. He clearly remembered Dongfang Lie’s arrogant words.

Wasn’t this Mo Fan’s innate talent just Double Innate Elements? Why did he have such terrifying strength? Was this the true strength of a provisional candidate?

The place went silent for a long time.

No one could believe what they had just seen. They even doubted if the person lying on the ground and spitting blood out was actually the first rank in the Fire School, Dongfang Lie.

In the end, they all stared at Mo Fan with wide eyes, as if they were looking at a monster.

The flames engulfing Mo Fan’s body died away slowly.

The crowd could not remember the force he was using, but it basically surpassed their understanding.

A provisional candidate...

That’s the strength of a provisional candidate!

If there was anyone among the crowd who doubted Mo Fan’s capabilities, they no longer had the same thoughts.

“Mo...Mo Fan?”

Mu Nujiao, Zhao Manyan, and Ai Tutu, who were supposed to be the closest to Mo Fan, suddenly felt unfamiliar with the guy standing on the stage... or perhaps this was his true strength, which he had been hiding for months?!

Then, what was the reason that stopped him from hiding it any further?

What was the sorrow showing in his eyes when the flames disappeared?

Mo Fan slowly released his clutched fists. His new phone had been crushed into dust, and it slowly fell to the ground between the gaps of his fingers.

Mo Fan took a deep breath, yet he never looked in Dongfang Lie’s direction.

“Mo Fan... where are you going?”

“The match is still on...”

While the crowd was lost in their astonishment, Mo Fan had already left the stage. Everyone was clueless what the guy was up to, as all they had toward him was respect and fear.

Mo Fan ignored his teammates’ calls, yet he finally collected his thoughts when Mu Nujiao and Zhao Manyan stopped him.

“What’s going on?” asked Zhao Manyan.

“I’m going to the Ancient Capital,” said Mo Fan firmly, after calming his thoughts.

“The restless Undead.”

“I know.”

“What about the World College Tournament?”

“I’ll deal with it after I come back.”

“We’ll go with you.”

Mo Fan shook his head.

He understood Mu Nujiao and Zhao Manyan’s willingness to help, yet it was his personal matter, he did not want to hold up their future because of it.
