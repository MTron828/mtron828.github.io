There were two ways for the Undead to evolve. First, using the presence of death to nurture themselves, like the fermentation of alcohol, allowing their strength to grow as time went by.

Second, by merging with and devouring others!

Combining the body parts of dead corpses to their own bodies with brute force would grant them the capabilities of the corpses when they were alive to a certain degree!

The Corpse General had used Jia Xi’s head to grant itself a human’s vision. Since she had only died recently, her hatred still remained, hence she had come looking for the team as night arrived.

Ash Garlic, staying still, none of them were effective against a Corpse General consumed by strong hatred, as she could still recognize their faces within a day of her death!

“Come...stay with me! I want you all to come stay with me!” the head on the Corpse General screeched at them with terrifying hatred.

The Corpse General had the ability to command the Undead. Following the scream, the zombies within a few hundred meters away obeyed its summon, sharing the same target as the Corpse General!

The zombies too began to scream, their rotten legs that were initially dragged around like puppets suddenly received a strong burst of energy, turning them into the most savage beasts, which charged toward the humans and surrounded them...

Countless black figures were running at them. The density of the Undead in the area was high to begin with. The entire place trembled as the summoning took place. The Undead had gone totally mad. The eight soldiers that were hiding in the middle of the Undead suddenly became the freshest meat available!

“Run, quick!” yelled Qin Hu.

There was more Undead around them than previously, including a Corpse General driven by hatred. They had no chance of fighting them whatsoever...

The eight soldiers quickly fled into the distance, casting Magic continuously as they ran, summoning wild fiery fists and erupting tornadoes. Despite the bodies scattering in the air together with the splatter of blood and liquid, the zombies were still chasing them relentlessly!

“AHHHH~!”

As the group was running, no one had time to look after Lu Hongjing, whose legs no longer had any flesh.

Lu Hongjing was a Water Magician. He barely had a Water Barrier protecting him from the Undead...

However, there were simply too many crashing onto him, like rugby players stacking on top of one another as they fought for the ball. More zombies desperately tried to squeeze themselves between the gaps.

Lu Hongjing’s cries were completely blocked off. The group could only see a pile of zombies where he was. They saw parts of his flesh being thrown out from the pile, which were immediately taken away by the zombies nearby. Not a single drop of blood was left, as the zombies even fell to their knees to suck it all up.

“Don’t look back!” Shi Shaoju snapped at Zhang Xiaohou.

The greatest taboo in the Land of the Undead was turning back.

Even if their blood-related brothers had fallen, they were not allowed to turn back and rescue them. The most they could do was to simply come back and retrieve their corpses during the day, just so they would not turn into more Undead...

“There’s no such thing as rescuing in this land. The rescue team is basically the corpse retrieving team!” emphasized Shi Shaoju.

Zhang Xiaohou bit his lips and continued to run.

The zombies showed no sign of decreasing. There were always new ones blocking the path ahead.

The Undead seemed to have unlimited energy. Even those that were left a long ways behind were still chasing after them.

“I...I’ve got you... come... stay with me!”

A terrifying voice was heard. Zhang Xiaohou turned around and realized that Captain Qin Hu had somehow been left behind...

Two zombies were grabbing onto his legs. A moment later, one of the Hatchet Corpse General’s arms stabbed through his body.

The arm slowly raised into the air. Impaled by the arm, Qin Hu was lifted into the air, hanging right in front of Jia Xi’s face.

Jia Xi burst into an eerie laughter, as if she were going to tear Qin Hu apart with her own mouth.

Qin Hu turned around. The captain glanced at Zhang Xiaohou with his final breath.

His mouth was filled with blood. Despite the great pain, he was still trying to tell Zhang Xiaohou something.

“Don’t... turn... back!” Qin Hu used his remaining breath to tell Zhang Xiaohou.

The following second, Qin Hu was torn apart by Hatchet Corpse General’s three other limbs. Only the head was left in good condition, and set aside by the Corpse General.

“Damn it, damn it!”

Zhang Xiaohou lowered his head and kept on running...

His face was hurting from the wind slapping his face. Zhang Xiaohou had no idea how fast he was going. Either way, the zombies were merely puppets blocking his path.

The zombies could not stop him, even the Warrior-level Corpse General had no chance to catch him...

However, his only attack was Wind Disc. He was unable to save anyone, let alone blasting the zombies surrounding his comrades away.

He initially thought he had grown stronger, that he was able to face tougher challenges and able to save the people he wanted to save. In the end, he was still the same, so tiny that running was the only thing he could do.

It would be great if Mo Fan was here. He would simply use his strongest destructive Spells to kill all the zombies. He would find a way to eliminate even the powerful Corpse General!

Two Elements were nowhere enough to deal with the Undead.

Zhang Xiaohou had never had such a strong urge to become an Advanced Magician. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After becoming an Advanced Magician, he would have access to three Elements. He would at least have some Spells he could use to fight the zombies!

He would be able to cast the Advanced Spells, either the Eyes of the Rock Demon: Petrify, and the Wind Wings of the Wind Element would help a great deal, at least he would not be running like a coward...

“Zhang Xiaohou, don’t go that way!” yelled Shi Shaoju.

Zhang Xiaohou quickly collected his thoughts and realized that the ground in front of him was collapsing...

First, the soil loosened up. Next, the ground began to sink. It felt like the ground was hollow underneath, and as the surface began to vibrate, the thin layer suddenly collapsed, revealing a pitch-black abyss right in front of him!

There were several zombies on the ground, but as the abyss appeared, they all dropped into it.

The angled moonlight was barely shining upon the walls of the deep abyss. Half of it was visible, while the other half was completely dark. The only sound was the cries of the zombies as they fell into darkness...

Loud cries of the Undead suddenly rose in the pit, as the ground began to tremble wildly.

“What...what’s this?”

Zhang Xiaohou halted right in front of the abyss, sliding right to the edge of the pit as his speed was too high.

He glanced down in astonishment, and saw the most terrifying sight he ever saw in his life...
