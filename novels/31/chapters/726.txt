“Zhao Manyan, did someone tell you this very stupid story before? It’s about two men walking on the street. They both saw a pile of shit on the ground. One of them said, I’ll give you ten thousand RMB if you eat the shit. The other man ate the shit and earned ten thousand RMB. The two continue to walk forward, and saw another pile of shit. The man who ate the shit felt he was mistreated, so he told the other man, I’ll give you ten thousand RMB too if you eat the shit. The man is eager to get his money back, so he ate the shit...” said Mo Fan to Zhao Manyan while they were running.

“You’re referring to how we’re trying to set one another up, but we’ve earned nothing apart from eating two piles of shit, right?” said Zhao Manyan.

Mo Fan nodded.

Either way, they were acting like fools.

They were on the run because a large group of Scarlet Soaring Demons was chasing after them.

The island in the middle had the shape of a turtle shell. It had lots of green plants, and a cave right in the center of it. The Scarlet Soaring Demons lived inside the cave. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were in charge of attacking the nest.

Their plan was to bombard the nest and flee before the demon creatures showed up. To their surprise, the Scarlet Soaring Demons happened to be enjoying mud baths outside the cave. When a few Fiery Fists landed on the dwelling place behind them, they immediately chased after Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan in extreme rage.

Mo Fan quickly turned around to count the creatures. There were at least forty of them. They looked like race cars when they were sprinting on their muscular legs, razing the plants to the ground.

After all, they were all Warrior-level creatures. If they were only a bunch of Servant-class creatures, Mo Fan would have wiped out the whole pack by himself. The two of them simply had no chance against forty Warrior-level Scarlet Soaring Demons.

“Stop chasing, stop chasing, your nest is on fire!” Zhao Manyan did not have any movement Spell. He was solely relying on a pair of expensive magic boots.

The problem was, regardless of how expensive the Magic Equipment was, it could only last a certain period of time. Zhao Manyan and Mo Fan were almost at the edge of the island, yet the Scarlet Soaring Demons still had not given up. It would be troublesome if the duration of his magic boots ended!

“F**k me, didn’t they always say beasts would possess a certain level of intelligence? Why are they still chasing after us like a bunch of provoked bulls! Didn’t they see the surroundings of their nest covered in frost? Why are they still chasing us!” cursed Mo Fan.

The two were running like there was no tomorrow, as if they had just poked a hornets’ nest. The story that Mo Fan came up with perfectly described their situation, they were nothing but fools! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Light Protection: Rampart!”

Zhao Manyan drew the Star Orbits while running. He tossed a Light Spell at the Scarlet Soaring Demons behind him after completing a Star Pattern consisted of seven Star Orbits.

A wall made of golden light appeared between two coconut trees. It looked like a wall of golden steel glass from afar. The Scarlet Soaring Demons failed to step on the brakes in time. They slammed into the wall hard. Blue blood splattered across the wall.

However, these creatures were obviously nimbler than Servant-class creatures. Apart from a few that rammed into the Rampart, the rest of the Scarlet Soaring Demons either went around the wall or jumped onto the trees and started sprinting on them!

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan had dark faces.

Aren’t they supposed to be sea monsters? Look at how they moved! They were a disgrace to the reputation of the sea monsters!

The truth was, the Scarlet Soaring Demons were not the only ones in the trees. When Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan approached the edge of the island, they discovered gray monkeys with sharp claws dangling on the trees!

The monkeys’ tails were very strange. Instead of the usual long tails, they were fish tails instead. They even had gills on their bodies.

As a matter of fact, apart from their face and skinny bodies, they had little resemblance compared to a monkey-like beast. The gray fur on their bodies was like seaweeds.

It was likely that these skinny Sea Monkey Monsters were disguising themselves as seaweeds to hunt the weaker creatures for food. They were currently hanging on the trees, like a bunch of monkey heads poking out from a pile of gray clothes on a drying rack!

“Are these Sea Monkey Monsters trying to stop us too!” Zhao Manyan was infuriated.

It was reasonable for them to flee for their lives since they were chased by Warrior-level Scarlet Soaring Demons, yet these Servant-class Sea Monkeys dared to humiliate them too?

The Sea Monkey Monsters were no doubt a bunch of annoying creatures. Instead of blocking Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan’s path directly, they simply pluck a handful of their disgusting gray fur that was like seaweeds and tossed it in their direction.

The fur was wet and extremely sticky. It turned into filth on the ground, but if the fur landed on one’s face, it would make their eyes blind while hindering their breathing.

There were around three hundred Sea Monkeys nearby. They hid on the trees and continued to toss their fur at Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan. The two found themselves in an unspeakable misery when the rain of gray seaweed poured down from the sky!

“Water Barrier!”

Zhao Manyan rapidly cast the Water Spell, not only to protect himself, but Mo Fan too. That guy didn’t even have a single defensive Spell!

“These goddamned monkeys, I swear I’m going to destroy them all later!” Mo Fan was utterly disgusted when he felt the gray fur sticking on his hair.

The seaweeds fur had an overwhelming stench, most likely because the Sea Monkeys were soaked in water every day. If Zhao Manyan had not conveniently cast Brilliant Light: Purify on him, he would most likely die of suffocation from the foul odor!

Zhao Manyan’s Water Barrier was unable to provide full protection covering three hundred and sixty degrees. It only consisted of a few water ribbons circling them, thus some areas would be unprotected at times.

As soon as they reached the island’s edge, Mo Fan saw a Sea Monkey poking its head out from a bush less than ten meters away. It had a cunning grin as it tossed a gray mound of filth at Mo Fan’s face!

Mo Fan was immediately enraged. He wasn’t a pushover!

“Come here, you little shit!”

Mo Fan swiftly grabbed in the direction of the Sea Monkey Monster!

An invisible hand grabbed the cunning Sea Monkey’s throat and dragged it toward Mo Fan. The force tossed the creature to Mo Fan’s feet!

Space Element: Telekinesis!

-Is this a dream?- Zhao Manyan’s face was blank. – That’s a Spell of the Space Element! How does Mo Fan know how to cast it?-
