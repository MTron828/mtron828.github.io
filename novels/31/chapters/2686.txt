Chapter 2688: Eight Fire Pattern

“F*ck! What is that thing?!” Zhao Jing shrieked.

The Blood Galaxy was Zhao Jing’s trump card. If they wanted to take down Fanxue Mountain successfully, they had to rely on the fall of the Blood Galaxy. But who would have expected that it would only cause a little bit of an earthquake without much damage to Fanxue Mountain?

Zhao Jing begrudgingly fixed his gaze on Zhao Manyan. He wanted to charge at him and strangle him to death.

When one is in danger, one always focuses on using all their cultivation to save themselves. Zhao Jing watched Zhao Manyan’s layer upon layer of protective magic and lost the desire to attack momentarily.

“Zhao Jing, focus on Mo Fan. It’s crucial to take him down,” said Master Bai Song.

Zhao Jing began to lose his patience. If he attacked Mo Fan with the Blood Galaxy, he could injure him severely. Maybe he could still kill Mo Fan.

“I can’t make the Blood Galaxy fall on a specific place only,” Zhao Jing said despairingly.

Master Bai Song looked at the fading Blood Galaxy in the sky and glanced at the demonic tree, which was withering fast. It made sense. If one could target only a certain place for the Blood Galaxy to fall onto, that would almost be taken as a semi-forbidden curse.

“The one with the golden tortoise shell-like armor is quite strong. We have to be careful of him.” Master Bai Song frowned.

There were quite a number of experts hidden in the Fanxue Mountain. They had miscalculated and acted too recklessly. Despite the difficulties, they had to take Fanxue Mountain down!

“Hmph! I know who he is. I never would have thought he was still alive. I thought it was a rumor to confuse Zhao Youqian. I didn’t think it would have been true.” Zhao Jing stared at Zhao Manyan with eyes full of malice. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Who is he?” asked Master Bai Song.

“Zhao Manyan.”

Master Bai Song, Master Lan Zhu, and Master Qing Lan looked shocked. All of them now stared at Zhao Manyan.

Judging from Zhao Manyan’s divine power at the moment, the masters had thought that he was someone on their level. No one had expected that the person was Zhao Manyan who was known for being a rich man’s worthless son. Master Bai Song had despised him and refused to continue Zhao Manyan’s education under him.

It had only taken Zhao Manyan a few years to develop his strength to be comparable to the masters. Zhao Jing had been the one who had suggested to Zhao Youqian to kill Zhao Manyan.

Among the successors in the Zhao family, Zhao Manyan had been the most eccentric.Zhao Manyan had managed to win the first place in the World College Tournament and was most likely to be in control of the funds of the Zhao lineage.

Zhao Jing and Zhao Youqian hung out together all year round. He had convinced Zhao Youqian to get rid of his elder brother. The family favored the younger one anyway and yet hesitated. Zhao Jing had finally persuaded Zhao Youqian and introduced him to the Hall of Assassins.

Zhao Jing hadn’t expected Zhao Youqian to be an idiot. He had failed to eliminate Zhao Manyan and this worthless person had appeared today and foiled all his plans!

“Let’s put that aside for now. We need to finish this battle quickly,” decided Zhao Jing.

“Okay.” The masters nodded.

What choice did they have? The Flame Demon King charged at them ruthlessly at that moment. Elder Pang, who possessed Water Element magical power, was already wounded. Mo Fan took advantage of that and charged at him.

Elder Pang’s chest bore a burnt wound. He was in excruciating pain. He could not even cast simple spells because of the pain. When he saw the Flame Demon King charge at him, he screamed and fled.

“Inferno Air Rift!”

Mo Fan ripped the air a few thousand miles ahead of him. Hot magma spilled through the crack forming a long rift in the valley with molten hot magma. The rift valley floated in midair and blocked Elder Pang’s way.

Mo Fan ripped it even more. The magma rushed straight at Elder Pang from the rift valley. The blinding fire was so intense that Elder Pang did not know how to evade it.

“Don’t just keep running!” Master Lan Zhu shouted at him.

Elder Pang looked troubled and panicked. He summoned all his strength to make a lightning-fast flip and evaded the incoming lava in the nick of time.

“Call Nanrong Ni over. I need her to cure my wound before it rips open!” yelled Elder Pang.

“She and Nanrong Xu are taking on Mu Ningxue,” responded Elder Shou. “Be careful!”

Elder Pang whipped around at Elder Shou’s warning. Mo Fan had appeared undiscovered from the magma rift. He was ablaze with the heavenly fire. Elder Pang wondered how Mo Fan had traveled thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.

“Eight Fire Patterns!”

Mo Fan stretched out his right palm. He pressed on it with his other hand and the flaming hair stood on its roots.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Magma from eight heavenly flame patterns targeted Elder Pang simultaneously.

Elder Pang summoned his magical armor, shield and guardian weapon. In an instant, three protective lights surrounded him: sea blue, light green, and ice white.

However, his three defenses melted away. Elder pang was forced to confront the Eight Fire Pattern on his own. He screamed in agony.

Before he even found his voice to scream, his face was already burning. Flames furled out of his eyes, nose and mouth. The flames spread to his entire body and burned him. When the flames from the Eight Fire Pattern died down, Elder Pang collapsed to the ground, entirely burnt black. He was barely alive. He crawled on the ground in pain. His eyes were full of agony and desire to survive.

He crawled towards Nanrong Ni. Only she could save him now.

“B*stard, I’ll kill you!” Elder Shou screamed in rage.

Elder Shou was very close with Elder Pang. Seeing Elder Pang suffering like this, Elder Shou could not control his wrath.

The three guests from the Zhao family were horrified. The had never expected Elder Pang, a Super Level expert who had fully mastered double elements, to almost die at the hands of Mo Fan’s Eight Fire Pattern.
