“This titan... those four battleships are at least two hundred meters when they are tied together. I never knew a two-hundred-meter-tall Tyrant Titan existed!” Some Hunters on the shore were still shocked by the sight.

“How strong is a two-hundred-meter Tyrant Titan going to be? The military must have paid a huge price just to kill them!”

“No, no, apparently, only the Battlemages who did not retreat from the Three Leaves Island Defense Perimeter died. There weren’t too many casualties in the operation.”

“There must be some Super Level experts here then. They must be quite reputable in Greece if they were able to kill the Steel Mountain Tyrant Titan and the Cruel Sea Serpent!”

The Steel Mountain Tyrant Titan’s death gave the people of Crete some much-needed relief. The Tyrant Titans were not invincible. They would also fall miserably if they dared to invade human territory!

——

A meeting was held right away. The general with long brows was smiling so hard when he saw Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai that his face was about to secrete oil.

“Mister Mo Fan, you did not let the Highnesses down. The Steel Mountain Tyrant Titan was a malignant tumor in the Mediterranean Sea. It might be clumsy, but we always failed to kill it because of the cunning Cruel Sea Serpent. Not only did their deaths bring people of Crete the peace they have long been waiting for, you have also avenged the dead from the Incident of the Blood Sea!” Poseidon complimented them

“How did you do it? That’s a two-hundred-meter-tall Tyrant Titan. Many people have never even seen one of its height before!” a few Golden Sun Knights blurted out.

They were no longer putting on airs. Most of the Golden Sun Knights who were present did not think they could take on the Steel Mountain Tyrant Titan. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s only a Blue Star Tyrant Titan. Why are you all making such a big fuss about it?” Tuis mocked their accomplishment.

“Tuis, a two-hundred-meter-tall Blue Star Tyrant Titan is actually stronger than many Silver Moon Tyrant Titans. Mo Fan has done a great job, and has won a magnificent battle for the Saintess’ Hall, helping the Parthenon Temple to earn back the people’s trust. A victory like this is the most convincing to the people at a sensitive time like this!” Poseidon rebuked him.

“Indeed, we need more victories so the Tyrant Titans will no longer dare to set foot in our territory. We must teach them to be afraid of us!” general long-brows declared.

Tuis was obviously irritated when he saw everyone in the meeting talking about the feat.

“No one can beat Tuis. It’s only a two-hundred-meter-tall Blue Star Tyrant Titan. I can kill ten of them. Just you wait!” Tuis could not stand it anymore, and strode out of the room angrily!

Tuis never thought Mo Fan would kill a two-hundred-meter Tyrant Titan after he heard their group was focusing on killing Blue Star Tyrant Titans. He assumed these amateurs would never track down a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan, let alone kill one!

They were just lucky they stumbled into a two-hundred-meter-tall Blue Star Tyrant Titan that was old and weak. His target was not those low-level creatures!

Zhao Manyan was humming as he walked along the path covered in pebbles. He had been quite pleased to see Tuis lose his temper. Most importantly, the whole of Crete was talking about the two-hundred-meters Tyrant Titan. The three of them were soon going to be famous!

They went back to their inn. They were used to the place, so they did not bother finding another place to stay. Harper might be scum, but he was quite an interesting person. They felt comfortable staying at his inn.

“Assh****, what is this junk you brought me? Did we purposely come here to collect this rubbish!?” a faint voice came from the grove beside the inn.

Mo Fan heard it from a great distance away, and looked in its direction.

“I think someone is talking in the grove, but I can’t hear him clearly.” Mu Bai had heard it too.

“Why didn’t I hear anything?” Zhao Manyan asked with a confused face.

“Your cultivation is too weak... I’ll go eavesdrop on them. I had a feeling those people who are staying at the inn are a strange bunch. I wonder what they are up to,” Mo Fan told them.

—

Mo Fan hid among the shadows in the grove, and soon located the group of visitors.

There was a simple shed in the grove, surrounded by weeds. Even the path leading to it was covered. No one would come here under normal circumstances.

The man with dark tattoos on one side of his face sat in the shed with the demeanor of a ruffian. He was cursing his lackeys scathingly.

“Boss, these are the freshest organs we can get from the Hunters,” the man with a black bandana said.

“What I need are the organs of Silver Moon Tyrant Titans, and the organs of the two-hundred-meters Tyrant Titan. You have three days to do your job. If you can’t find any of them, I’m feeding you to the snakes!” the leader said.

“Boss, it’s really difficult to get them. You do know the military has the two Silver Moon Tyrant Titans...”

“Who cares if the military has them? Our guild has been controlling the supply of the Tyrant Titans’ organs for many years. Last time, we failed to provide Su Lu’s men with enough hearts from the Tyrant Titans. This time, the Liden Royal Family is offering us a lot of money. We must get them at any cost!” the leader said.

“Boss, give us more time. We just need to figure out a way. We do have connections in the military. We also have people in the Parthenon Temple. The organs won’t fall into the wrong hands this time,” the man with a black bandana promised.

“Just get out of my sight. I will send someone to negotiate with the man from the Tuis.”

Mo Fan went back to the inn after he was done eavesdropping on the group.

A few minutes later, the man with black tattoos on his face came back. He was alone.

“Where have you all been for the past few days?” the man asked.

“We went to restock our supplies. Crete has been short on supplies lately. We have to cross a few mountains if we want to buy some fresh fruits,” Mo Fan replied calmly.

“What fruits do you have? Get me some and bring them to my room,” the man ordered.

“Not a problem,” Mo Fan retained his smile and watched the man leave.

The smile on his face lost its warmth as soon the man was out of his vision.

“The road is narrow for enemies indeed. I didn’t expect to stumble into them here!” Mo Fan spat.

“You know who they are?” Mu Bai was surprised.

“They are from the Guild of the Wicked!” Mo Fan stated confidently.
