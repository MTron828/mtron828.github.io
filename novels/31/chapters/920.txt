Old Bao blew at his mustache and cursed, “Do you have any idea how tiring it was just to handle the orb? You can keep it now.”

“What? Keep it?” Mo Fan’s eyes widened. “That thing is very dangerous. It tried to bewitch me at times. It’s like a ticking time bomb!”

Mo Fan did not forget how twisted Mochizuki Chihaya had been. She had almost turned into a devil. Who knew if the orb would sneak into his soul without him knowing? There was no way Mo Fan was going to bring such an evil thing around with him!

“Do you seriously think I haven’t done anything to it? I’ve already eliminated the evil presence inside it. It’s only a container now. It’s quite valuable, too!” replied Old Bao.

“Are you sure the strange voice won’t appear out of nowhere and bewitch me again?” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan clearly knew where the orb came from. It used to contain a super evil being from a place of evil. Anyone that touched it would suffer utter bad luck. Mochizuki Chihaya and Mochizuki Ken were too kind to simply chuck the orb over to him and let him handle it for them!

“Don’t worry, it won’t happen again. I was going to sell it and split the profit with you evenly, since there are people that are willing to spend a fortune on it. However, I heard Lingling mentioned that you almost used the Demon Element at the manor, so after thinking about it for some time, I decide it’s better for you to take it,” said Old Bao.

“What do you mean?” asked Mo Fan in confusion.

“You know that using the Demon Element is like a huge loan. The real demon will soon demand the payment from you, but with this orb that’s able to store Soul Essences...You know how hard it is to find an abundant supply of energy to support the Demon Element. I’ve cleared the evil existence in the orb, and modified it into an energy container. If you happen to find yourself in a situation that you can’t overcome with your current strength, you can use the Demon Element and use the orb to pay the price!” declared Old Bao.

Mo Fan was overjoyed!

Damn, it turned out that Old Bao had managed to modify the orb in his favor! Old Bao was impressive indeed. If the old man had been a young woman, Mo Fan would have immediately given him a few kisses on the face. It was something that he desperately needed for now!

“Who would have thought that the orb could be that handy, hahaha!” Mo Fan suddenly felt that both Mochizuki Chihaya and Mochizuki Ken were incredibly amusing, giving him such a great gift without them knowing!

“You have become the Black Vatican’s target after the calamity of the Ancient Capital. We will take good care of the people around you, but you like going wild on your own. The Black Vatican will surely try to get revenge on you, so before you grow into an independent Supreme Magician, the power of the Demon Element is your greatest weapon against the Black Vatican...” Old Bao reminded him sternly.

“I understand,” Mo Fan nodded.

“Go back to the national team. Our country doesn’t really have suitable sources to fill up the Essence Orb. Go find the sources elsewhere; the orb is like a magnet, it will guide you to the suitable sources. Mo Fan, no one knew what the side effects of using the Demon Element were. For your sake, and to prevent something worse than the Red Demon appearing in this world, I hope you will fill up the Essence Orb before you use the power of the Demon Element again,” said Old Bao.

Mo Fan held the empty orb in his hand and nodded firmly after seeing the serious look on Old Bao’s face.

It was obvious that Old Bao had spent quite a lot of effort on the orb just so he could have better control over the Demon Element. Mo Fan would definitely remember Old Bao’s advice!

“I will try my best to fill up the orb,” replied Mo Fan.

“Be careful out there. Salan knows what you’re capable of, so she won’t necessarily take the initiative to trouble you. She’s scared of your Demon Element, but I believe she will try every way to force you to use it, and get rid of you when you’re weak after using it. Therefore, it’s very important for you to focus on improving your strength. Only when you’re strong enough will you not find yourself being controlled by others!” added Old Bao.

Mo Fan rarely had the chance to have such a long discussion with Old Bao, yet every word that the old man said served as a great reminder to him.

It was necessary for him to grow stronger. The Demon Element was not reliable! If he assumed it was his trump card, with Salan’s capabilities, she could easily take his life!

“I understand, I will try my best to improve my strength too!” Mo Fan assured him.

After taking the Essence Orb with him and leaving the Clearsky Hunter Agency, Mo Fan suddenly felt that Old Bao was not just the person in charge of a private agency. He was totally clueless about the old man’s identity in the past...

Mo Fan did not really care about it. Old Bao’s advice had definitely given him a clear goal.

Fill up the orb! Improve his strength!

Once he was strong enough, he could easily handle any situation, even if Salan was setting her eyes on him.

“I should regroup with the others on the national team. I wonder where Ai Jiangtu and the others are at now,” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan returned to the Training Hall. He was meant to take part in the last battle before he could rejoin the national team. The others were about to finish their current round of training. He had no idea who was going to be disqualified.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan had to win against another team before he could rejoin the national team.

As Old Bao mentioned, the Essence Orb did not show any reaction in the Magic City. It was obvious that there was no suitable source to fill up the orb nearby.

After entering the Training Hall, for some reason, Mo Fan felt that the atmosphere did not seem right. Everyone was wearing a gloomy look.

Mo Fan went up to the team and asked Mu Nujiao, “What’s wrong? Are we going up against a lowly team like the Egyptians?”

“They are very polite and humble. It’s just that our winning streak might come to an end today. We only needed one more win to reach five wins in a row,” said Mu Nujiao.

Mo Fan lifted his gaze and looked at the group of people opposite their team. They were wearing casual clothes, some of the girls were even wearing antiquities of China as accessories. It seemed like they were quite passionate about Chinese culture...

“Which country are they from?” asked Mo Fan.

“A strong country, England!”

Mo Fan’s mouth opened. He could not find any word for a moment.

England, an extremely strong country!

Their pure, strong magic was considered to be the highest standard across Europe. The top Magic Association of the five continents, Saint Paul Church, was located right in England!
