“Can your team send someone stronger? If this guy is already one of the strongest on your team, I should advise you not to take part in the finals in Venice. Just go back to your desert and spend another ten or twenty years practicing before coming out here and embarrassing yourself!” Mo Fan totally showed the Egyptian team no mercy with his mouth.

A little Egypt still dared to act so smugly in his territory!? Except for the captain on the national team, Ai Jiangtu, he could easily take on any of the others on the national team. How could he possibly lose against these Egyptians?

“Sayed is only below average on our team. Winning against him isn’t something to be proud of. I will surely teach you a lesson!” retorted the bucktoothed Shreev, stepping forward.

Shreev and Sayed did not get along well. He was the happiest when seeing Sayed embarrassing himself. Besides, he could totally use the chance to display his strength and show Sayed his place!

That being said, his main goal was to take care of the defender on the Chinese team. Apart from his Advanced Fire Element and Space Element, there was nothing to be scared of.

Shreev stepped forward and slowly went onto the stage.

Mo Fan looked at the dark-skinned foreigner with ugly teeth and an even uglier face impatiently.

“Call that proud woman with an afro up here instead, I have no interest in a little shrimp like you,” said Mo Fan, pointing at Meos.

“Humph, she’s our vice-captain. A mere defender like you isn’t worthy to fight her! Have a taste of my curses first!” said Shreev.

The power of the Curse Element was somewhat similar to the Psychic Element, as it was focused on the target’s spirit and soul.

Shreev cast the Mist of Fear on Mo Fan, intending to disrupt his channeling of the Star Patterns.

The Mist of Fear was able to increase the fear in one’s heart. If the caster had a strong cultivation, he could even use the Mist of Fear to create nightmarish illusions, and the target would suffer a mental breakdown.

As soon as the Mist of Fear appeared, Mo Fan could hear a voice repeating in his ears...

He had heard the voice at the ranches before. It was a woman talking at a slow pace.

“I’m going to pay you back for all the troubles you’ve caused. You better live longer, or else I can only get the people close to you to pay in your place!”

It was Salan’s warning!

It was obvious that the Mist of Fear of the Curse Element was able to dig out the deepest fear in Mo Fan’s heart. If the spell was cast on someone with a weaker mind, it would be in the form of some event that the target had gone through before.

Mo Fan clearly knew that it was just a mere illusion.

The reason why the voice had appeared was that Salan was indeed the scariest person Mo Fan had met in his life. Both the calamity of Bo City and the calamity of Ancient Capital had shown our minuscule and weak humans were before her long blood-red robe. Everyone was so filled with despair that they could not even see the slightest glimpse of light. Every life was so insignificant, be it the Magicians, or the ordinary people...

Mo Fan’s eyes shook. Shreev thought his Curse Element was working. He started laying down a trap of the Curse Element. Once the Sinister Spider Trap successfully entrapped its target, even an Advanced Magician had no chance of winning the duel.

However, was Mo Fan really lost in his fear?

What he felt toward Salan was not fear, but rage!

A person like her who treated human lives like mere chaff should be sent to the eighteenth floor of Hell!

Not only was Mo Fan not lost in fear, he was completely infuriated! His cold eyes were staring at Shreev, who was feeling proud of himself.

“Do you seriously think your petty Curse Element can entrap me?” Mo Fan’s eyes were full of disdain.

He was now an Advanced Magician with two Advanced Elements. His spiritual force was twice that of an ordinary Advanced Magician. Meanwhile, Shreev was most likely an Advanced Curse Magician. If he could adeptly cast the Advanced Curse Spell, Demon Torture, like Ai Jiangtu could, Mo Fan might find himself in a pinch. However, he was too naive if he thought the Mist of Fear and Sinister Spider Trap were enough to handle Mo Fan!

“Off you go!” Mo Fan’s eyes were cold. The strong, silver force rammed into Shreev like a ferocious beast.

Shreev was taken by surprise. He summoned his Shield Equipment in a panic. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He did not want to be defeated so easily. As a Curse Magician, it was a must to possess defensive equipment, too!

His Magic Shield managed to stop Mo Fan’s Space Element, yet he seemed to have forgotten that Mo Fan still had a Summoned Beast on the stage.

The Swift Star Wolf had waited a long time for this. As Shreev’s attention was focused on Mo Fan, he suddenly sprang forward with outstanding speed and bit Shreev on his shoulder.

Shreev reacted fairly quickly. He summoned his Armor Equipment and used the Curse Element trap, the Sinister Spider Trap, on the Swift Star Wolf.

The Swift Star Wolf was incredibly agile. He dodged the red silks nimbly and blew a strong gust of wind at Shreev.

The attack was ineffective against Shreev under the protection of his magic armor. He walked out from the flying dust and was about to cast a spell from his other Element when he saw a pair of sharp silver eyes staring at him!

It was like he could read the words PISS OFF in the flames coming from those eyes.

Shreev tried to cast his spell in a panic, but six Giant Shadow Spikes flew at him from different directions, each penetrating his magic armor and nailing his joints.

The dark force entered his body and sealed off his bones, muscles, veins, and spiritual force.

Shreev was stunned. He did not even have time to react when he saw a huge, burning fist closing up to his face...

Shreev was set on fire as he was knocked flying, drawing a spectacular arc through the air. The bright trail of fire left in the Training Hall was rather stunning.

He slammed heavily into the ground outside the stage. The effects of the Giant Shadow Spikes had disappeared, but the flames continued to burn on him. Shreev had suffered a great concussion and cried out in pain.

Mo Fan had obviously overdone it this time. Shreev had broken bones, and his skin was severely burned...

Who asked this idiot to cast the Mist of Fear on him? Mo Fan was having trouble going easy on him!

“Err... why do I feel like the Egyptian team... is very weak?” asked someone among the defenders.

“It’s not like the Egyptian team is weak, but this Mo Fan is simply too strong!”

“The Curse Element wasn’t effective at all against Mo Fan, which simply means his cultivation is a lot stronger than that ugly dude! The Curse Element is basically useless against those with a higher cultivation, unless they are able to lay the traps down beforehand!”

“He has already defeated two representatives of the Egyptian team. Mo Fan is unstoppable! I never knew he was this strong!”

The defenders were talking among themselves. Everyone had clearly seen the fights, and Mo Fan had delivered utter defeats unto both Shreev and Shreev!

The Egyptian team felt incredibly embarrassed after their members lost to a mere defender. After all, their team was made up of the strongest students from Egypt!
