2985 Kill The Angel

Mo Fan was a demon. He was a Wicked God. He was also a divine phoenix that rose from the ashes!

He looked up to see the Archangel Shalitha. Mo Fan’s eyes looked as if they were a sea fire that could even engulf the Great Wall of China as he approached Shalitha.

“Your era is over! Seven archangels in charge of maintaining the order of humanity, huh? Let me take your place. Shalitha, you don’t deserve that position at all!”

At that moment, the true demonic Wicked God finally descended. The Sacred Totem Beast’s soul was awakened inside the Wicked God’s body!

It was the world’s most powerful fire. It was capable of reducing the corrupted conquerors to ashes!

Mo Fan made a leap. His Sacred Feathers faced down in the sky. When he spread his wings, fire swept across the sky. He lunged at the lifeless Palace of Death.

He struck a punch. The next moment, the Palace of Death and the destructive wind in the dimension disappeared altogether. The Wicked God’s fire covered the sky and swept away the aura of the dimension in a single blow. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, on the land, the mountains near the West Guardian Towers were uprooted, loud explosions were audible. The next moment, the fortress, library, institute, restaurant, and hotel inside the towers were crushed. The people inside the tower started to fall like rain. They smashed onto the crumbling towers.

They were shocked and believed it to be a nightmare. They were on the verge of losing consciousness when they noticed the horrifying fissures in the mountains and stronghold, and the crumbling towers. However, a few of them had been drawn into the lifeless Palace of Death and were ultimately crushed into powder.

Shalitha’s divine power caused destruction with a godlike precision. Regardless of their levels of cultivation, they were just ordinary beings, and their lives were as worthless as straws.

But the demonic shadow was the only one who could fight with such a divine figure. For a moment, people did not know how to differentiate between the god and the demon!

The god-like figure wanted to reduce them to ashes, but the demonic shadow wanted them to be saved.

“Ozawa! Ozawa!” Lingling did not care much about treating her own wounds. She hurried all the way to a stack of woods, where she used every ounce of might to dig a bloody person out of the crumbling pile.

When she dragged him out, Lingling realized Ozawa was only left with half of his body.

The unhealed cut on his abdomen marked the severance of his upper body with his lower half. The lower half of his body had been swept into the Palace of Death and turned to dust, just like the people of the East Guardian Towers.

Lingling’s eyes turned red. She tried to help Ozawa up, but she did not know how she could make him feel better.

Ozawa did not look to be in pain. Instead, he reached out a hand to comfort Lingling. Her body trembled in anger.

“Is this where the Twin Guardian Towers belong? I thought I’ll be able to see the sun set and drink beers on the wheelchair with my peers who share the same passion…” whispered Ozawa.

“Don’t bother about the Twin Guardian Towers for now. Even if the towers are destroyed, we can rebuild them. If you die, no one can resurrect you!” Lingling wanted to treat his injuries, but she did not know how.

Ozawa’s body was halved by the Dimensional Wind. Even a Psychic Mage could not cure him, let alone Lingling, who only knew basic medical care.

“When I was swept up, it was only then that I realized how puny I am… I-I can’t do anything. I can’t save anyone. I—” Ozawa fixed his gaze on Mo Fan in the sky.

At that moment, Mo Fan shone like a blazing sun. The Archangel Shalitha was magnificent and noble, and Mo Fan was his only match in the world. The rest were just fireflies!

“You’ve done very well! You’ve done a really good job! You’re more sober minded compared to the rest in the Twin Guardian Towers. You’re the best. You’re the hero of the towers. You’ve saved and awakened everyone. You’ve done all you can. You’re not puny…” said Lingling.

Lingling wanted to tell Ozawa that no matter how puny they seemed to be, they belonged to their own small world. They were great people especially since they were willing to stand up and defend the things that they cared about.

Unfortunately, it was already too late for Lingling to say the words.

Ozawa stared at the sky where the Archangel Shalitha fought with Mo Fan. His eyes looked lifeless. There was no luster in them.

He was dead. He died alongside the fallen Twin Guardian Towers.

Ozawa refused to close his eyes. Lingling could not stop crying when she looked at his tired and exhausted face.

Ozawa had done a very good job.

Who exactly brought his world to an end? Who was it that had no mercy at all for them? Who was it that destroyed the Twin Guardian Towers, which Ozawa had worked tirelessly to safeguard, without even the tiniest sign of decency or humanity?

Someone sacrificed themselves to protect the towers. But some had no regard for it at all. They trampled the sacrifices under their feet. They were none other than the Archangels from the Holy City!

Lingling had never experienced such rage and agony. She also wished she could become a demon and destroy the dreadful, depraved world for good!

…

Mo Fan observed the scene on the ground.

He saw Lingling. He also saw Ozawa with only half of his body. He saw the shattered Twin Guardian Towers.

In the end, Shalitha destroyed the Twin Guardian Towers. Regardless of whether the people were criminals or innocents, everyone had died because of his ruthless magic.

Mo Fan heard Lingling’s cry. The flames of anger in his chest only grew stronger!

“Go to hell!” Behind Mo Fan, long wings of flames appeared. Like an intensely burning planet, he charged at the Archangel Shalitha without caring much about others!

The Archangel Shalitha was surrounded by a tough feathered shield. One of his potent celestial powers was the shield. But as soon as Mo Fan walked up to him, his angelic feathery shield melted. The Archangel Shalitha seemed like he would be reduced to ashes because of the explosion.

Shalitha ignored the Twin Guardian Towers. There were still some remnants from the towers, but he could not wipe them out, because Mo Fan was a threat to him now!

Shalitha flapped his angelic feathered wings and surged into the deep navy-blue sky. He glowed in a beautiful aurora light. It was beautiful and vibrant. When he reached the sky, streams of light that resembled holy, sharp swords pierced the sky and ruthlessly charged toward Mo Fan!

It was the Dome Light Heavenly Swords!

Mo Fan looked up to see the divine punishment. They were demonic swords from heaven. Not only could the swords pierce him, but they could also nail his soul to the bottom of darkness!

Even so, Mo Fan refused to give in to the high and mighty Shalitha.

Mo Fan passed through the Dome Light Heavenly Swords. The swords cut his skin, and his demonic blood spattered. He spread his Divine Phoenix Wings. The next moment, a pool of fire surged in the sky.
