Chapter 2151: Go Ask for Help as You Want

Translated by XephiZ

The tattooed man was so frightened that he quickly Summoned a shield of Light. He looked around him, assuming some terrifying Mages were hiding nearby. It was normal for them to be targeted by the law in Europe.

However, could he really handle someone who could kill his lackey without him noticing them?

“You should be looking at me.” Mo Fan approached the tattooed man.

The tattooed man assumed the three in front of him had nothing to do with events. However, his heart skipped a beat when he saw the silver light in Mo Fan’s eyes.

There was another explosion of flesh and bone; one of the blond-haired brothers blew apart. His bones and meat scattered across the ground after Mo Fan glanced at him!

“They can’t choose how they die, but you can,” Mo Fan went on.

He then turned his eyes on the other blond brother. The space around him compressed rapidly. The man had already used his Earth Element to cover himself, but it was useless against Mo Fan’s absolute strength.

He turned into dust instead of exploding, and his head flew past the tattooed man’s face. Only then did the man realize the person who had served him fruits was the one that killed his lackeys!

But how was this possible!?

“Who...who exactly are you!?” The tattooed man was scared. He could only think of one possibility. They were the local Enforcement Union, working undercover!

“We are just some guests here. We just happened to meet the man you killed,” Mo Fan said.

“Impossible, you have been tracking us for so long. Assh***, we are the Black Ornaments. Do you know our motto? If you offend one Black Ornament, the rest of them will be coming after you! It doesn’t matter who you are or which organization you are from! Kid, you have close ones, friends, and family too. If you kill me today, you shall suffer the wrath of the Black Ornaments! You will realize how wrong you are when you are holding the dead bodies of your loved-ones in your arms,” the tattooed man prattled in fright.

“Impressive, the Black Ornaments are much more organized than the Blue and Red Ornaments. You may go,” Mo Fan said suddenly.

“I can go?” the tattooed man squeaked in astonishment. He thought he had heard it wrong.

“Mm, I just thought of a more interesting way of dying for you. I bet you are just an errand boy among the Black Ornaments. I’ll give you a day’s time to ask your superiors for help. I’ll be coming after you in a day. I hope you still believe in the same idea by then,” Mo Fan continued thoughtfully.

The tattooed man did not fully understand Mo Fan, yet he did not hesitate to leave when he had the chance.

The tattooed man ran away quickly. He could still see Harper’s blood along the pebbled path leading to the inn.

What an idiot, he even sacrificed his life, just to save his friends!

That other guy was an idiot too! He let me go so easily!

The Asian could have killed him very easily. It seemed like the Black Ornaments’ motto was actually effective. Even the people of the Enforcement Union cared about their families. The Black Ornaments could strike from anywhere. Not only were they a bunch of reckless crooks, some of them had formidable positions in society too.

The tattooed man suddenly noticed a shadow moving behind him as he was running.

The shadow had crawled out of the ground like a mummy. It was pointing a dagger at his neck!

“Damn it!” The tattooed man realized the Asian had no intention of sparing his life. He belatedly recalled the Asian’s words.

He was told to find someone who could save him, as the Asian would come to take his life after a day!

“I don’t care who you are. You are just asking for your death!” the tattooed man screamed, and ran faster.

The tattooed man did not leave Crete. He would not be able to leave Greece in only a day without a plane. However, it did not matter, as the Black Ornaments had long infiltrated many places in Greece. He could easily find someone who could help him in Crete.

The tattooed man fled to the top of a tall building. An important meeting was taking place inside a room there. People in expensive suits were just leaving it.

The meeting room was emptied out quickly. A middle-aged woman with a bow tie was still seated at the table. Her curly fringe was dyed blue and orange. Her shiny diamond earrings made her ears look more alluring. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She was dressed in a business suit. She might not have long hair or an alluring figure, but she had her own charm.

“Didn’t I tell you not to meet me here?” the woman scolded him.

The tattooed man was still a little shaken. He stammered, “Sister Black Diamond, we have a problem. I met a very strong Mage. He suddenly showed up after we completed our mission.”

“Which organization is he from?” the woman asked.

“I’m not sure, but he let me go and asked me to look for help... a strange shadow has been following me since. I might die at any second, please help me!” the tattooed man said.

“You come here when you don’t even know who he is? You idiot, isn’t it obvious he has spared your life on purpose to lure me out!” the woman snarled.

“I know, but I had no other choice!”

“Where is he now? I’ll ask someone to find out who he is immediately. We better target his loved-ones too,” the woman said.

“He’s at...”

“I’m right here,” Mo Fan’s voice suddenly appeared in the luxurious meeting room.

The woman obviously had a higher cultivation. She turned to the window and saw a blurred shadow on it. However, its surface started twisting as the shadow walked out from it like a mirror.

“Damn it!” The woman was even angrier. Her attractive face had contorted.

The tattooed man had brought her such huge trouble!

Luckily, she had a few experts with her. The bodyguards around her were not just ordinary people, they were elites of the guild, and all of them were Mages. They were constantly by her side in case of some unexpected circumstances like this!

“I don’t care who you are, but this guy has nothing to do with me!” the woman exclaimed.

“It doesn’t matter, I’ll give you one day. You can try your best to ask your superior for help,” Mo Fan repeated coldly.

As soon as he finished his sentence, the elites in the room cried out in agony and fell to the ground at the same time.

The woman and the tattooed man immediately turned around, and almost fell to the ground too.

The throats of the elites had been sliced by their own shadows!
