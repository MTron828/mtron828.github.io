3043 There Will Be No More of The Black Vatican

In the east of Godly Seal Mountain was a primitive valley that shared the view of the ocean. It was a place where the members of Parthenon Temple kept their flying creatures and creatures that lived on land. There were also several ancient dragon species. They were still in the growth stage, but they already had large wings and hovered around the cliff.

By the forest stream was the Chief Extraditor, Yan Qiu. She treated the wound on her thigh. The trails of her blood would expose her whereabouts. She had to do all she could to stop her wound from bleeding. She had to break free from the people who were chasing after her!

“The knights possess the Holy Souls,” said Salan coolly.

“The person who wants to kill us hasn’t been born in this world!” Yan Qiu said callously.

She took out a dagger that was filled with cold aura and stabbed her thigh. She endured the severe pain and cut off her leg!

There was a tracing burn mark on her wound. Since she could not treat it within a short period of time, she might as well cut it off and use the cold energy on the dagger to freeze the wound.

Losing one leg was better than being relentlessly pursued.

The members of the Black Vatican had to strictly keep their identities a secret. They were not genuine ascetics. They had not reached the apex grade in their strengths. Any of the Red Cardinals who had been targeted till now weren’t immune to death!

“Don’t do it anymore!” Salan grabbed Yan Qiu’s wrist and stopped her from hurting herself.

“But—”

“He’s already somewhere nearby.” Salan glanced across the opposite bank of the forest stream.

At the end of the street that was hidden from the sunlight, she noticed a pair of eyes in the depth of the forest. The eyes were deep and flashed with a bone-chilling gaze.

It was the slayer!

The person had to be Ye Xinxia’s slayer. He was an expert with the possession of the God of Death, Hades’ Holy Soul.

The members under the old Supreme Pontiff were killed. Not many people from Salan’s group survived.

The Black Vatican members who originally engaged in the final battle with Hall Mother, Pamise, died at the hands of Ye Xinxia’s knights.

A black aura surged. For a moment, the lush mountain forest turned gray. The valley that was filled with life force slowly became lifeless as the slayer with the Hades Holy Soul approached.

His terrifying power surpassed that of the majority of Forbidden Mages. Salan had a guardian disciple. Her disciple’s strength in unleashing the faith in evil power had reached the Forbidden Curse level.

Her disciple later took over the Red Cardinal Cold Prince’s place. Although her disciple had a powerful faith of evil power, her disciple appeared like a three-year-old child when she confronted the slayer with the Hades Holy Soul!

Salan and Yan Qiu had personally witnessed the Red Cardinal with a powerful faith of evil power being shattered into pieces by the slayer with the Hades Holy Soul.

Salan and Yan Qiu were almost certain that they could not escape from the slayer. That place would be their graves. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Salan stopped Chief Extraditor from cutting off her leg. She did not want Chief Extraditor to endure any more unnecessary pain before her death.

“Haylon, I know it’s you,” said Salan facing the forest.

Haylon slowly revealed himself. The Lord of the Hall of Knights wore black Holy Garments. He was tall and majestic. He gave off an aura of dark Holy Soul that belonged to a demon from hell. There was no one more powerful than him at the moment.

The Lord of the Hall of Knights was the one who chased after the Red Cardinal Salan from Blessing Mountain. He did not need the Goddess to grant him a Holy Soul. He already had a dark Holy Soul living within him. It was Hades’ soul.

The Hades Holy Soul was the only Holy Soul of War that refused to submit to the Soul of Parthenon Temple. But Haylon pledged his absolute loyalty to Ye Xinxia!

“He’s the Dark Soul…” Chief Extraditor, Yan Qiu, stared at Haylon in shock.

‘Wasn’t the Dark Soul the same Spirit Cult Guardians who stood guard over the Black Vatican?!’

Chief Extraditor, Yan Qiu, vividly remembered it was the same Dark Soul who had assisted them. The Dark Soul had helped them in dismembering Izisha’s body into eight pieces!

‘Why had he become Ye Xinxia’s killer?’

“He has been protecting Ye Xinxia. He has never once changed his stand,” said Salan.

Ye Xinxia always had the Dark Soul with her.

When Ye Xinxia was driven by Izisha to the edge of death and was almost given a death sentence by the Holy Judgment, the Dark Soul informed Salan. The Dark Soul helped Salan to stir up a storm of revenge in Parthenon Temple. He helped her to dispose of the Great Sage, Mellaura and the Great Magistrate, Dulanc.

And that person was Haylon.

Haylon’s true ability was more powerful than anyone even imagined. He could summon the Holy Soul without a Goddess. Moreover, the Holy Soul that he summoned was the most terrifying dark underworld Lord, Hades.

Haylon was cloaked in Hades Holy Garments. Very few people in the world were a match for him.

“Ye Xinxia has lived past the age of the oath. You are free!” Salan fixed her gaze on Haylon as she said the words.

“I’m free to continue being the Dark Soul if I chose to,” replied Haylon calmly.

His killing intent sprouted in his heart. His decision was firm. He would not change his mind because of past feelings.

The Hades Holy Soul did not obey the Soul of the Parthenon Temple. In fact, it stood in opposition to the Divine Soul.

Haylon could not explain even today why his duty with a deadline became his only purpose of living in this world.

“She doesn’t want to see me. Or does she not want to see me die?” Salan snorted and approached Haylon.

“Isn’t it the same for you too? Both of you don’t want to meet each other. You don’t want to see her because you want to show your last bit of mercy to your own daughter. Similarly, she doesn’t want to see you because she wants to pay her last bit of respect to you as her mother,” said Dark Soul, Haylon.

…

A bloody rivulet seeped into the clean stream turning it red. A lonely figure in white stood beside the bloodstream.

Haylon approached her from upstream. His hands were covered in blood. When he walked to Ye Xinxia’s side, his black garment was in stark contrast to Ye Xinxia’s white dress.

Haylon looked at Ye Xinxia’s silhouette and slowly calmed his breath.

When Ye Xinxia saw the bloody stream, she clearly had difficulty in suppressing her conflicting yet painful emotion.

“She’s dead. I can confirm it’s really her,” said Haylon.

Haylon wanted to tell her everything but considering the unique identity and situation, he only told her of the end result.

Salan was dead. Chief Extraditor ,Yan Qiu, was dead, too.

“There will be no more of the Black Vatican in this world,” said Ye Xinxia.

“But the world will assume the Black Vatican is at its peak. The people will also rebuke you because you’ve just ascended the throne of the Goddess. Your future will be full of challenges,” said Haylon.

“At the very least, we are through with the darkest time,” replied Ye Xinxia.
