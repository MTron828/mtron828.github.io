“Big brother, stop fighting them, didn’t they want to know where the meteorite went? Can’t you just tell it was on the mountain in the west? I don’t want to see you injured again...” Apas said, pretending to be worried about Mo Fan while communicating with him telepathically.

Zu Xiangtian was already having a reaction after seeing Apas’ tear-stained face. Why? Why must such a gorgeous little girl stay with that wild dog?

“Apas, why did you say that? These people are the bad guys!” Mo Fan answered righteously.

“I don’t think so, he seems more like a nice guy than the others from before. He didn’t attack you right away, even though he seems very strong,” Apas blinked, glancing casually at Zu Xiangtian.

The gloomy look on Zu Xiangtian’s face dissipated instantly.

A little beauty with good taste!

Splendid, he might be able to have a lot of fun if he could get his hands on her. Perhaps she might be willing to stay with him, even!

“Little girl, are you sure you saw a meteorite landing on the mountain in the west? Is it that way?” Zu Xiangtian asked seriously, pointing at the mountains to the west.

He did not forget the reason he was here. He had plenty of time to trample Mo Fan, but he had to track down Norman before reporting back to Su Lu.

So it turned out that Mo Fan had no idea the meteorite was actually Norman. Why did he even waste his time on the idiot!?

“Mm, we were playing on the beach when we saw a meteorite falling in that direction. There were three guys that came to us and ask about it too, but brother started fighting them because he was too angry,” Apas nodded. The innocent look in her eyes convinced the man that she was not lying to him!

Zu Xiangtian looked at Mo Fan and harrumphed coldly. It turned out that Mo Fan was just messing around with them. He almost messed up by wasting his time here!

However, Zu Xiangtian was not feeling comfortable if he did not trample Mo Fan into the sand. He bet it would not take long for him to defeat Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue. Norman was seriously injured. He would not get too far!

“Have you made your decision? I don’t mind if you insist on fighting here,” Zu Xiangtian said.

“There are too many people nearby, and the place isn’t spacious enough. Most importantly, there aren’t any spectators. No one would know if I beat the crap out of you. How about this? We’ll organize an official duel back in our country. You will represent your clan, while I represent Fanxue Mountain. I’ll step on your face in front of everyone. It’s better than fighting here. You would only eat some dirt at most, even if you lost, and the next day, you’d just pretend like it never happened!” Mo Fan said.

Zu Xiangtian smiled. He thought Mo Fan wasn’t afraid of anything, but it turned out that he was too scared to fight!

However, he did find the suggestion appealing.

Zu Xiangtian was not trying to kill Mo Fan. He wanted to crush his dignity several times over and turn the little girl by his side into his plaything. He would feel better by torturing Mo Fan. Besides, the Zu Clan might get in trouble if he killed Mo Fan!

Beating Mo Fan into a half-dead dog in front of the reputable Mages and the authorities in his homeland, proving that the Zu Clan’s status was untouchable, was obviously more appealing than teaching him a lesson in this crappy place!

He could crush the dreams of the imbeciles who claimed Mo Fan was the strongest young Mage in their country at the same time, too!

Zu Xiangtian had long gotten past the age of defeating other talented young Mages. It was meaningless to him, but it was definitely worth his time to trample Mo Fan underfoot. Mo Fan had been making quite a name for himself. It was time to put a stop to it!

“I don’t mind if you’re trying to buy yourself some time. I do like the idea... I’ll give you half a year’s time. Half a year from now, I, Zu Xiangtian, will trample Fanxue Mountain under my feet. If you two fail to reach the Super Level by then, there’s no point in facing you in the duel. You can send out your strongest representative. I will admit my defeat if I lose to any of you!” Zu Xiangtian promised.

It was meaningless to only challenge Mo Fan. He was going to trample all of Fanxue Mountain!

Zu Xiangtian took a final glance at Apas. He was planning to get his hands on this little beauty soon, but it seemed like he would have to wait for some time. There was no need to rush it. He finally had a chance to work for Su Lu. It was necessary to consolidate his position. He would need around half a year for that.

Everything would be his after he was done with Mo Fan! Patience was important to achieve great things!

Even if he gave Mo Fan ten years, Mo Fan would never catch up to him, let alone in half a year!

Zu Xiangtian soared into the sky. The Blue-Scaled Hawk was roaming nearby. Zu Kuangli spoke out when he saw Zu Xiangtian returning so quickly, “As expected of brother, you’ve dealt with them so quickly!”

“I haven’t done anything. You idiots, couldn’t you tell that Mo Fan was just messing with you!?” Zu Xiangtian cursed.

Zu Kuangli was startled. He recalled their encounter carefully and realized it was indeed the case. That Mo Fan suddenly started a fight out of nowhere by provoking him and Zhao Liwan...

They might not necessarily have seen the meteorite from the peninsula. After all, the sky was so huge, so it was possible that clouds had blocked the flames. Mo Fan acted like he was never going to tell them what he saw, yet there was a chance that he never saw anything.

He was just messing around with them!

“So... where did Norman go?” Zu Kuangli said.

“Did you check the mountains to the west? You only saw the trail he left behind. Perhaps he fell into the mountains instead of the sea,” Zu Xiangtian said.“The west... we didn’t check there! Damn it, that Mo Fan is seriously bad luck! We almost messed up because of him!” Zu Kuangli patted himself on the head.

It was possible that Norman had fallen into the mountains, judging from the angle of the trail he had left behind!

“You were wasting your time arguing with that idiot instead of searching the mountains. How stupid can you be!?” Zu Xiangtian sneered.

“Yes, yes, it’s just that Mo Fan has such a foul mouth. We have to teach him a lesson... brother, did you teach him a lesson?” Zu Kuangli asked eagerly.

“There’s no point doing so here. It wouldn’t make any difference,” Zu Xiangtian told them the duel he had organized with Fanxue Mountain.

“Brother has all things considered. It won’t just be a little brawl. The whole country will be watching the duel! Nicely done!” Zu Kuangli said.

“How many times have I told you to use your brain more and not just act on impulse...”

“Brother is right! I can’t want to see Mo Fan doubting his life after he loses. He has no clue how strong brother is... (cough cough!) Let’s find Norman first. That Mo Fan is going to pay when the time comes!”
