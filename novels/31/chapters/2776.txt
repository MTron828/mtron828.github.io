Chapter 2778: Open Another Magic Portal

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

During the fight between Skeleton Dragon and those commander-level Tyrant Lizard Demon Dragons, it was clear that the difference in their strength was that of heaven and earth.

Its sharp bone could easily pierce the hard skin of Tyrant Lizard Demon Dragons. Their hard skin was their most strong aspect, but they didn’t stand a chance against the Skeleton Dragon.

Although more than a dozen Tyrant Lizard Demon Dragons bypassed the Black Totem Snake, they ended up just as miserable. The Skeleton Dragon’s killing breath could even corrupt their corpses and turn them into a bunch of Pseudo-Dragons’ bones.

The Skeleton Dragon attacked like a war machine. During the attack, it would continuously drop some broken bones and attract the fresh Pseudo-Dragons’ bones to its body like a magnet to fill the fallen and broken ‘components’.

“Amazing!” Mo Fan gave Jiang Yu a thumbs up.

Li Que, Wang Ping, and Su Guangyu were also impressed. It was what one would expect from a disciple of Pang Lai. He already possessed such strength at a young age.

The Skeleton Dragon should have the strength of an average ruler. Some of the Royal Mages had reached the third level of the Super Level, but none of them could fight against an average ruler alone, let alone a Great Ruler.

Night Rakshasa was resting in the Contract Space. If Jiang Yu summoned it after it got enough rest, it would be difficult to say who needed the protection.

Jiang Yu did not much respond to the admiring gazes of the three Royal Mages, but Mo Fan’s compliment made him particularly happy.

‘Damn it! I finally got Mo Fan to compliment me,’ Jiang Yu thought. It had never happened in the past.

The road of cultivation was long, and he had to endure boredom and loneliness. He worked hard for change and improvement. If he could get the recognition and praise of his old classmate, everything would be worth it!

“Although my Skeleton Dragon is incomparable with your Totem, it is practical at critical times. I have been a little lazy this year. If I work harder, I may be able to open the Kingdom of the Fallen Beasts or Flame Dragon,” Jiang Yu said.

The Skeleton Dragon had cleared the surrounding threats, so they were safe for the time being. It was the perk of being a Summoning Mage. If they were bold enough to summon a dangerous creature, they could buy time to recuperate even on the battlefield.

“I can only open the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower.” Mo Fan saw that the three Royal Mages had already dealt with the Hunter Dirty Demons on their right, so he did not rush to fight.

Mo Fan was still looking forward to Wan Dragon Valley. The dragon pattern he had just seen should be the key to locking a dragon in Wan Dragon Valley. He would ask for Jiang Yu’s advice in the future.

“Has your Summoning Element advanced to Super Level? That’s amazing! After all, you have so many elements. Can you open the ancient magic portal? Such Summoned Beasts are much fiercer than us. What kind of spirit can you summon? You should summon it now. Otherwise, you won’t have time to cast spells if the Lizard Demon Dragons surround us,” said Jiang Yu.

Mo Fan nodded. He was right. There was no use saving so much Summoning Element’s magic energy. Contracted beasts and dimensional beasts did not consume any magic energy. It was the Summoned Beasts and the ancient magic portal that consumed the most energy.

Mo Fan began to integrate the Lightning Element. His Lightning Element had the highest cultivation. If there was no accident, he could continue to summon the Silver Thunder Titan. Its strength would not be inferior to that of the Skeleton Dragon, so it would have no trouble dealing with the Tyrant Lizard Demon Dragons.

‘Huh? Did I fail?’ Mo Fan wondered. He opened his eyes to find that the Silver Thunder Titan in the ancient magic portal was unwilling to fight.

Summoning a beast was not always successful. It depended on the mage’s spiritual realm and the beast’s mood.

“You don’t know the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower well enough. Many elemental elves have their preferences and lives. If you didn’t find the right time to summon them, you would fail to summon lower level elves. If you ask them to fight too much in this period, they will have psychological repellency. After all, they only work for you, unlike the semi-enslavement of dimensional beasts.” Jiang Yu explained.

A similar situation happened in some of Mo Fan’s previous attempts. He had to ask those average ruler elves to fight, and the success rate was less than thirty percent. At that time, he successfully summoned those Contracted Beasts because Little Loach had obtained the Holy Spring. It gave him some boost.

The opening of the ancient magic portal consumed one-third of the summoning magic energy, so Mo Fan felt a headache incoming.

He might not have been able to summon every elf even after consuming all the summoning magic energy. He needed more practice. Success was not easy.

“You should summon Little Flame Belle.” Jiang Yu suggested.

In other words, he meant Mo Fan was bad at it. The construction of the ancient magic portal was too slow, the timing of spiritual penetration was not right, and the communication was not good. It was no wonder he failed.

Mo Fan was not intentionally hiding it. His level of Summoning Element was supposed to have advanced to Super Level. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ll try again. You protect me,” Mo Fan said with disbelief.

“Make sure to concentrate. The construction of the ancient magic portal is too slow. You have to practice those 2401 stars… When you release the ability of Summoning Element, can you stop other elements’ magic? How can you use two elements at the same time?” Jiang Yu continued to scold Mo Fan.

If Mo Fan did not integrate other elements, the level of elves that Mo Fan could summon would be too low. Under the same consumption, the higher the level of summoning, the better creatures he could summon. If he failed, he could do nothing.

This time, Mo Fan did not integrate the Lightning Element. He added the Shadow Element to his fusion magic. The Shadow Element was not weaker than his Lightning Element and Fire Element.

When the Shadow Element merged with the ancient magic portal, terrifying death patterns emerged. Inscriptions and smears like blood covered the ancient portal.

“Oh my god, Mo Fan, what kind of door are you opening? It is not the ancient magic portal. Don’t take the wrong path. It might pull you into an unknown world and then you will become a Summoned Beast for other species. There is a high probability you can’t ever come back.” Jiang Yu was taken aback. He hurried to stop Mo Fan.

Mo Fan did not stop. At first, he was a little scared. After integrating a lot of Shadow Element energy, he opened a door filled with a lot of darkness and death. It was not leading to the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower.

Mo Fan understood Jiang Yu’s warning. He would have closed it immediately but he sensed a familiar atmosphere behind the new magic portal.

He had stayed in it for a whole year. The dullness and depression were the most common feelings in the Dark Land. At first, he was a little uncomfortable, but soon it became familiar.

Mo Fan had no idea that he had opened a Dark Plane instead of a Summoned Beast Plane!
