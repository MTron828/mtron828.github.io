One of the most renowned clans in Europe, the Casas!

Mo Fan had only heard about the clan after he saw how ruthlessly they demanded the Alps Institute hand over their student, not to mention the arrogant Herr Casa!

Mo Fan’s impression of Herr Casa still remained at his pitiful appearance after he was poisoned. It seemed like Herr Casa had completely forgotten the lesson dealt him after he had recovered. He was greeting the lecturers, giving himself a high profile, and a huge group was gathering around him.

“That guy is a lecturer too?” Mo Fan asked helplessly.

“Are you referring to him? He’s a representative of the student union. He’s a member of the main party of the student union,” Miyamoto Shin answered politely.

Mo Fan had almost forgot Miyamoto Shin was with him. Coincidentally, Herr Casa was walking toward them after greeting the other lecturers, but he was not looking at Mo Fan, as he did not recognize him. He was looking at Miyamoto Shin instead. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Miyamoto Shin, we didn’t expect you to become an assistant after you left our party,” Herr Casa addressed Miyamoto Shin, completely ignoring Mo Fan and the others.

Miyamoto Shin retained his smile as he replied, “I’m just from a normal background, unlike you. Allow me to introduce, these three are brilliant lecturers from China.”

“Oh, nice to meet you.” Herr Casa did not bother memorizing their names. He quickly went through the motions and strutted in Prince Beny’s direction.

“Isn’t this a gathering for the lecturers? Why are there students here too?” Mo Fan asked in confusion.

He had noticed there were a lot of people in the restaurant. The guest lecturers from nine different institutes would only add up to around thirty people, yet there were around sixty people in the restaurant. Some of them were obviously just students, based on their age.

“They are members of the student union, here to represent the students. If you want to receive a positive evaluation from the school, having a close relationship with these members of the main party in the student union might help. They have a great influence among the students. They are like the leaders of the students,” Miyamoto Shin informed him.

“Leaders of the students... sounds impressive,” Mo Fan said cautiously.

“Indeed. After all, some of them are as strong as our lecturers,” Miyamoto Shin agreed.

“The guy who was talking to you, is he from the main party of the student union, too?” Mo Fan inquired blandly.

“Yes, he was in the main party last year. My connections are nowhere as impressive as theirs. The lecturers have taken the initiative to express goodwill to them, even though they are only students, because of their background and outstanding capabilities,” Miyamoto Shin sighed, his expression helpless and jealous.

Mo Fan watched a few lecturers taking the initiative to greet Herr Casa.

“What about the gorgeous girl who’s like a Barbie doll beside Herr Casa?” As expected, Zhao Manyan’s focus was always somewhere else.

“You mean Urthurman? He’s a son of the Sacred Hall of Liberty, a very famous guy!” Miyamoto Shin said.

“Are you sure you didn’t make a mistake? The son of the Sacred Hall of Liberty?” Zhao Manyan repeated.

“Yeah, that’s what everyone calls him, since he’s the son of the Sacred Hall of Liberty’s Honorable President. He has a delicate face and likes to dress up like a woman. It’s not even a secret in our school. Look, most men who come to our school for the first time are attracted by Urthurman’s gorgeous looks, just like you. That being said, he does have a lot of followers,” Miyamoto Shin told them, clearly amused.

“What? A beautiful lady with a dick!?” Zhao Manyan reacted as if he had just eaten a fly.

Zhao Manyan had seen many, many women. He could easily tell if it was a man dressed like a woman. After all, a real woman had a natural seductiveness that no disguise could mimic! But in Urthurman’s case... he was clearly a man, yet Zhao Manyan was imagining pressing him down on a desk just half a minute ago!

When Zhao Manyan recalled his thoughts, he felt like throwing up!

“Old Zhao, I didn’t know your tolerance had improved so much!” Mo Fan patted Zhao Manyan on the shoulder.

“Piss off, you dare say you didn’t think he was hot at first sight?” Zhao Manyan shot back.

Seriously, that round bottom and long legs. He did not lose his brilliance even when he was standing beside Brianca, who was known for her alluring physique. Zhao Manyan was seriously impressed by these cross-dressers. He could not even tell until they took off their pants. That alone was not enough; they would have be facing him after they did so!

“I’m not interested in his kind,” Mo Fan smiled aloofly.

“Aren’t you two supposed to worry about Herr Casa first?” Mu Bai hissed.

“Worry about who?”

Mu Bai had an urge to keep quiet. Were these two seriously over-indulging in their disguises? They were supposed to be looking for clues about the Black Vatican’s whereabouts!

Most importantly, his sister Yan Qiu was Herr Casa’s maid. If Herr Casa was here, it was very likely Yan Qiu was here too.

In other words, they had come to the right place!

The Black Vatican was here!

“Mr. Mo Yifan, can I have a minute with you?” a gentle voice spoke while Mo Fan was lost in his thoughts.

“Oh, hi, how can I help you?” Mo Fan had almost forgot his alias. He turned around and saw a girl with dark purple hair. Even the ornament on her head was purple.

Her choice of purple was not the enchanting kind. It was sacred and pleasing to the eyes.

“Your class about merging different Elements today intrigued me. Unfortunately, I have a lot more to learn about it. I couldn’t understand your explanation in the class. Could you instruct me privately if you have time to spare?” the student asked seriously.

Mo Fan was startled. Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai were shocked, too.

What now!?

Did Mo Fan really get the attention of such a beautiful student with the theories he made up? She even asked him to tutor her privately?

Heaven knew what Mo Fan was going to do to her!

Mo Fan did not respond. However, Miyamoto Shin looked very surprised.

He quickly introduced them when he saw Mo Fan did not respond, “Mr. Mo Yifan, this is the student union’s president, Sharjah!”
