The Scarlet Rending Demon was unaware of the boulder that was also under Mo Fan’s control. It was feeling dizzy from the knock on its head, and by the time it rose to its feet, it immediately discovered a huge stormy cloud right above its head!

“Lightning Disaster!” Mo Fan commanded the enraged lightning.

Multiple purple-black lightning bolts swept across the clear sky and landed on the Scarlet Rending Demon simultaneously. The lightning spread rapidly into an enormous web, with lightning arcs going back and forth through the Scarlet Rending Demon.

The Scarlet Rending Demon stood in the middle of the paths of lightning. The lightning was nowhere strong enough to penetrate its defense if it had not been injured. However, the armor on its chest was severely damaged, and it had yet to recover from the poison inflicted by the wasps. As such, every time the electricity flowed across its chest, it would shudder!

The lightning inflicted enormous pain, yet it was far from being able to kill the creature. The Scarlet Rending Demon opened its mouth, where some cloudy water was moving around!

The Scarlet Rending Demon’s chest swelled. It spat out a water bolt at Mo Fan after its chest expanded to a certain degree!

Mo Fan was already prepared and hid in the shadows under the rocks, moving quickly to another shadow when the water bolt approached.

The water bolt’s power was shocking, penetrating the thick boulder with ease. The thing could easily shoot through a human’s body!

The Scarlet Rending Demon spat out two water bolts from a mouthful of water.

The water bolts were around four meters long, with incredible speed. The first water bolt was targeting Mo Fan, but the second one was sealing off his escape, leaving him no chance to cast Fleeing Shadow! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Mo Fan, let me help you!” Zhao Manyan swiftly drew a Star Pattern in the air.

Zhao Manyan had cast two spells simultaneously, Water Barrier and Light Protection. He knew that his spells were most likely too weak to stop the Scarlet Rending Demon’s water bolts, but he could focus on stopping one of them for Mo Fan!

The light shield encapsulated Mo Fan. The shield had barely materialized when the light was shattered into pieces like a glass being smashed by a heavy blow. Dots of light sparkled in the area.

Water Barrier quickly shielded Mo Fan like a ribbon, yet its defense was a lot weaker than the Light Protection. It was nothing but a mere decoration against the water bolt’s ability to penetrate.

Mo Fan knew there was no way he could dodge the attack. He quickly turned around and used his back to take the terrifying hit.

A deep scratch was left on the back of the Black Snake Armor. Mo Fan immediately felt a great pain as the water bolt struck him.

This time, his backbones actually ruptured as Mo Fan heard the sound of his bones breaking.

The Black Snake Armor’s defense had weakened after being used repeatedly. It would soon vanish after its usage had passed its limit, and would require a long time to recover before Mo Fan could use it again.

Mo Fan spat the blood in his mouth on the ground and glanced at the unconscious Xiao Di.

“Zhao Manyan, take the kid. I’m going to kill this son of a bitch!” Mo Fan was infuriated. Fire and lightning danced crazily around him.

Zhao Manyan quickly came down to the ground and received the kid, whose nose was still bleeding, from Mo Fan’s hands.

“I think he’s still alive...” said Zhao Manyan, when he noticed that the kid was still breathing.

“Take him back to receive treatment. The kid is too young, he won’t survive the impact to his lungs if he doesn’t get treated in time,” said Mo Fan.

The Scarlet Rending Demon once again spat out water bolts. This time, the bolts were lining up in the shape of a fan before flying at Mo Fan. The creature was determined to kill Mo Fan once and for all!

Mo Fan’s fist was engulfed in blazing flames while he was talking with Zhao Manyan. The scorching fire under his feet was mixed with a hint of purple-black lightning!

“We don’t stand a chance against it. Come here quick, we’ll leave together,” Zhao Manyan wanted to drag Mo Fan into the air.

However, before Zhao Manyan could finish, flames burst out of Mo Fan’s back and propelled him forward like a rocket, leaving a long trail of flames between the rocks...

“Meteorite Fist!”

“Nine Dragons!”

Mo Fan charged forward right at the water bolts and threw his fist forward!

The water bolts simply evaporated in the heat of the fiery dragons circling Mo Fan!

With a flash, nine meteorites swept across the air and combined into a blazing glow, like the first glimpse of light at dawn that could wipe out any darkness...

The line of water bolts completely evaporated into white steam. However, Mo Fan’s fiery fist did not disappear. It flew right at the Scarlet Rending Demon after destroying the water bolts!

The Meteorite Fist landed heavily on the Scarlet Rending Demon’s face. The Scarlet Rending Demon’s neck tilted to one side, as if its neck was broken. The scales on its face were stained with blue blood as it was knocked to the ground.

The creature staggered back to its feet, and was just about to steady itself when it began to slide backward as the gust of wind from the explosion swept in its direction. The reef behind it was completely smashed into pieces from its momentum!

Zhao Manyan floated in the air and observed Mo Fan’s outstanding punch in disbelief.

-He is going against a Commander-level creature. Is Mo Fan really strong enough to take on a Commander-level creature by himself?

-Mo Fan’s strength is unbelievable!-

“Don’t let the kid die!” Mo Fan raised his head and shouted to Zhao Manyan in utter seriousness.

“Don’t you die either! I’ll bring someone over after I send him to the hospital,” Zhao Manyan nodded back.

Zhao Manyan did not waste any more time further, as Xiao Di’s life was at stake. If he died, all their efforts would be in vain.

Zhao Manyan beat his golden wings and flew into the sky. In order to save the kid, Zhao Manyan even used all his energy just so his Magic Wings could fly faster. The kid’s bleeding was getting worse, while his breathing was getting weaker!

After reaching a certain height, Zhao Manyan could not help casting a glance backward.

The sea was blue as usual. The reef exposed above the water was brown, and on the small reef island Mo Fan was fighting the enraged Commander-level sea monster alone!
