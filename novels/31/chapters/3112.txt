Chapter 3113: Tracing The Pharaoh’s Source

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation?????? Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At noon, it was rare to see the haze enveloping the blazing sky dome of Cairo. They felt a bit of coolness in the desert town that was similar to a furnace. Unfortunately, the cool air did not last for more than a few hours. Heat filled the land again. The people were drenched in sweat as if they were trapped inside a steamer. They could not even breathe properly. They felt as though something blocked their chest entirely.

“Is it going to rain?” On the street, the Egyptian merchants selling magic stuff looked up at the sky in astonishment.

“It seems so!”

The people stopped their work and looked up at the sky. They breathed in the stuffy air…

Tick-tack! Tick-tack! Tick-tack!

Big raindrops pattered on the tents. It soon began to rain heavily. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Tap! Tap! Tap!

Raindrops struck the stone streets with a wet, crisp sound. It began to rain even faster.

“It’s raining!”

“It’s raining!”

Heavy rain poured down from the hazy clouds that hung high in the sky. The rain watered the desert. The heavy downpour on the flaming sand was equivalent to a godly intervention. The drought had lasted long in the desert. The desert looked as if it had been revived following the heavy rain, like the first ray of dawn in spring after winter in the southernmost of Ushuaia, Argentina.

Every raindrop was sacred.

The people took out beautiful jars and filled them to the brim with rainwater. They filled up several jars and sealed them.

Everyone was joyful as though they were celebrating a festive season.

The members of the Hunter Society from Imperial College held umbrellas as they walked on the street. They looked puzzled when they noticed the people dancing in the rain.

“Rain in Cairo is an important event, just like the first snow in the Imperial Capital. After all, rain in spring is important to us, too. Isn’t it?” said Chen He.

He was very knowledgeable.

Chen He was a strong and muscular senior with a body-builder’s physique.

However, he had very soft features. The two contrasted each other jarringly.

“Stop looking at it. We’ll gather at the end of the street. The rest of the Hunter Master teams must have arrived. It’s good to arrive early so that we can get to know our opponents.” Guan Yao was not in the mood to appreciate the local customs.

They hastened their pace to the end of the streets. A dozen Hunter Master teams were already gathered there. They came from different countries. They had different hair colors, skin colors, and eye colors. There were also other Hunter Master teams from the local area.

The Hunter Tournament had always attracted many participants. There had been at least hundreds of local teams. However, when they learned that they had to travel to Egypt where the riots of Egyptian Undead were still happening, very few teams decided to continue their journey.

After weighing the pros and cons, they decided to skip the Hunter Tournament

for this term. After all, the title and honors remained unchanged. Therefore,

there was no need to take risks for this term.

“Teams 37 to 62, we will issue a bounty order to you now. Your bounty task is to find the Pharaoh’s Source, which is scattered across the Pharaoh’s Tombs in this land under the Undead’s attack. Remember, you will need to find the exact location of the Pharaoh’s Source. You can’t take it away. If you do and end up dead, the Hunter Union will not sympathize with you. There will be at least one Dark Swordmaster standing guard over the Pharaoh’s Source somewhere nearby,” announced the host of the tournament.

The host was an old Egyptian Senior Hunter. He was known as Black Elephant King. It was said that his most epic Summoning Creature was an underworld elephant.

The Hunter Society was assigned to the 48th hunter team, which was under the Egyptian Black Elephant Kings unified management and assignment. He distributed the task to a total of 25 teams. He supervised them and made the final assessment.

“The Pharaoh’s Source? Isn’t this considered a top international-level bounty task? Some people spend a lot of money just to obtain a drop of the orthodox Pharaoh’s Source. I heard that the Pharaoh’s Source can keep one youthful forever. The researchers from the skincare companies are especially obsessed with it,” said Chen He in surprise.

They were going to look for the Pharaoh’s Source!

The Pharaoh’s Source was a mission that topped the international bounty list. Even though the bounty offered was so high that it was almost as much as the entire wealth of a small city, few were willing to complete the task.

The Pharaoh’s Source had too many uses. The most overstated one was that it could prolong one’s life.

Khufu and its pharaohs were the best “ambassadors” of the Pharaoh’s Source. They lived even to this day!

“Even the Soul Element Magic relies on the Pharaoh’s Source. The Pharaoh’s Source can turn an ordinary Soul Mage into a master of the underworld!” Guan Yao looked thrilled.

She was a minor Soul Mage.

She was full of anticipation from the moment they headed to Egypt. Perhaps, she could find a way to break through her advanced-level Soul Element Magic.

The country had limited resources. Thus, it would be difficult to achieve super-level Soul Element Magic.

Lingling had a limited understanding of the Pharaoh’s Source. She knew it was something very magical. It was an ancient magic filled with infinite possibilities. Even Khufu did all it could to collect as many of the Pharaoh’s sources as possible.

There were many Pharaoh’s Tombs in Egypt. Meanwhile, the Pharaoh’s Source was like a strange bud of flowers. Sometimes, it appeared on an ordinary dune. Other times, it was sealed in the deepest part of a dangerous tomb. Yet other times, there was no trace of it at all. It rarely felt like there was an ancient force guiding the people and Undead to it.

‘Are the rest of the hunter teams given the same mission too?’ Lingling was puzzled. ‘Shouldn’t they rescue the Forbidden Mages who are trapped? Is it because they don’t want too many people to find out about the Forbidden

Mages’ current situation? Or is the Pharaoh’s Source the key to freeing the Forbidden Mages from their trap?

What Lingling was concerned about the most was not the location of the Pharaoh’s Source, but whether the other hunter teams had received the same bounty task.

“Master?” said a deep voice.

Leng Lingling turned around. Jiang Bingming had mysteriously come up to her side. He addressed her strangely.

“Master Leng Lingling, what’s your opinion? You used to work with an experienced Hunter Master. How should we start the mission, since it’s without any clues so far?” Jiang Bingming asked with a smile.

“I’ve no idea,” replied Lingling.

“Hehehe… Lingling, do you want to hear my analysis?” Jiang Bingming said smugly.

Lingling understood that her senior wanted to tell her of his plan.

It wouldn’t hurt to listen to his ideas. She wondered what else the vice president of the student council of Imperial College had to offer aside from having a fear of heights.

“Of course, senior. What is it?” asked Lingling.

li lt’s the rain. It hardly rains in Egypt. From my understanding, the Pharaoh’s

Source is related to the rain. We can tell the possible existence of the Pharaoh’s Source based on the plant growth and desert flowers in the following week. Lingling, if you’re willing to help me work out the plant statistics and geographic screening, I don’t mind sharing the credit with you. After all, I’m your senior, and the dean has asked me to take care of you.” Jiang Bingming chuckled.

“Really?” Lingling was enlightened.

There was indeed a good chance of finding the Pharaoh’s Source with its connection to the rain. Since it was a source, it was related to water—the source of life. Lingling did not expect Jiang Bingming to have conducted his research about Egypt through the night after passing out and throwing up the day before..
