“Master, we found traces of Carnage Poisonous Salamanders in the cave. I’m afraid there are at least ten of them. As for the area connecting the cave and the lake, we didn’t dare go too close, but we are sure that the Great Salamander Demons are in the water,” Wang Zhouming of the Pancheng Hunter Group informed Mo Fan.

Wang Zhouming was the vice leader of the Hunter Group. He had not gotten along with Lu Zhuo. He was planning to quit the group and look for another team after the quest, but the incident took him by surprise.

It was actually in Wang Zhouming’s favor that the rest of the members in the group were clean. He could not just disband the team that had been working together for so long because of a single person!

“I’m not good at fighting underwater. Is there any way to lure the Great Salamander Demon to the island?” Mo Fan asked.

“That won’t be necessary! Based on our observation for the past few days, the Great Salamander Demon will come to the island on its own. Otherwise, it will just hide at the bottom of the lake. There’s no need to turn this Cave Island into its den,” Wang Zhouming said.

“It will come out on its own?” Mo Fan blurted out in surprise.

“Yes, we’ve discovered that all the Carnage Poisonous Salamanders in the Thousand Islands Lake are female! These female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders are offering the Lizard Demons to the Great Salamander Demon as sacrifices. When the Great Salamander Demon is satisfied, it will mate with those female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders. The Carnage Poisonous Salamanders will then take a huge number of eggs from the Salamander Demons and scatter them across the lake. A female Carnage Poisonous Salamander can lay around five hundred eggs by mating with the Great Salamander Demon once, hence why the Thousand Islands Lake is crawling with the Salamander Demons,” Wang Zhouming said.

The Foehn Hunter Squad had made a huge discovery. They had learned that these female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders were carrying the eggs of the Salamander Demons!

The Thousand Islands Lake did not have a male and a female Great Salamander Demon, it only had a male! It was like a machine that would place his offspring inside the bodies of the female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders that had submitted to it. The Carnage Poisonous Salamanders would then scatter the eggs of Salamander Demons on different islands so they could absorb the particles of the Ward Rocks as nutrients.

The particles of Ward Rocks were very suitable for the growth of Salamander Demons, hence most of the eggs would hatch!

“I see!” Mo Fan realized.

Lingling’s analysis was a little off-track. There was no female Great Salamander Demon. The female Great Salamander Demon was actually these Carnage Poisonous Salamanders!

A few deep cries sounded from deep inside the cave while Mo Fan and Wang Zhouming were talking softly. The cries sounded like a crow. They were not very clear after bouncing off the walls a few times.

The cries sounded quite special. Mo Fan subconsciously turned his head around and asked Apas, who was standing beside him, “What does that cry mean?”

Apas turned her head away. She was not willing to answer the question.

“I’m asking you a question!” Mo Fan said in displeasure. Was his Contracted Beast a tsundere? He would have to punish her by smacking her butt if she did not listen to him again!

“Master, the Great Salamander Demon is summoning the female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders. In our words, it’s feeling horny!” Wang Zhouming said awkwardly.

Wang Zhouming had done a great job with the investigation. Mo Fan was glad that his money and Contribution Points were well-spent.

“Oh, does that mean they are going to distribute the eggs of Salamander Demons soon?” Mo Fan asked with a straight face.

“Yes, the Great Salamander Demon is like an ancient emperor. It will summon the female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders to its nest at times and choose one that appeals to it to mate with. The creatures are amphibians. They live in the water, but they mate on land. This Cave Island is pretty much the Great Salamander Demon’s mating ground,” Wang Zhouming said.

Wang Zhouming purposely lowered his voice, and would glance at Apas at times. Perhaps he believed it was inappropriate to be explaining it in front of a minor!

“Mm, mm, I didn’t expect you to investigate it so thoroughly. It’s very simple, then. We’ll wait for the Great Salamander Demon to come to the island!” Mo Fan nodded.

“But there’s one tricky problem,” Wang Zhouming went on.

“What is it? Do you think it’s impolite to disturb them while they are mating?” Mo Fan had to smile.

“No, that’s not it. Basically, the rest of the Carnage Poisonous Salamanders will be guarding the island after the Great Salamander Demon picks a Carnage Poisonous Salamander to mate with. Therefore, if we are planning to engage when they are mating, the rest of the Carnage Poisonous Salamanders will flank us...” Wang Zhouming explained.

“Oh my, that son of a b**ch, not only is he able to choose among the female Carnage Poisonous Salamanders to mate with for the day, he even lets the others watch them from the side!” Mo Fan cursed. He had never seen anything so lascivious. He was so jealous that he simply had the urge to kill it!

Cough cough! “Master, don’t be too stirred up now. We will be in trouble if our existence is exposed. The Carnage Poisonous Salamanders are heading our way,” Wang Zhouming said.

“I’m just angry!” Mo Fan said. He turned around and asked Apas insensibly, “Apas, isn’t your tribe pretty extreme with things like this too? Don’t you think the Great Salamander Demon is a little overboard?”

The snakes and scorpions were the lascivious kinds, too. Otherwise, they would not have so many species and such a huge empire!

“My sisters spend most of their time curling up with those disgusting things when they are not expanding their territories. They will normally take on more than a hundred male snakes alone.” Apas did not seem interested in the matter. She replied expressionlessly, with a hint of disdain.

Wang Zhouming almost dropped his jaw. He took a closer look at Apas and imagined her two beautiful sisters and a bunch of muscular men... He was curious why she had described the men as male snakes, but it was still difficult to believe!

As a matter of fact, Apas’ sisters did not resemble humans. Their appearance was closer to that of a snake. Mo Fan was disgusted when he imagined a bunch of snakes curling up together. The scene he imagined greatly differed from Wang Zhouming’s.

“Let’s hold it right there...” Mo Fan was trying to tease Apas to embarrass her. He would be satisfied if he could see her blush. To his surprise, Apas had told him a more breathtaking truth. He felt defeated instead!

Wang Zhouming, who was observing the creatures, suddenly blurted out in a strange voice, “Master, I...I think we’ve miscounted. The number of Carnage Poisonous Salamanders is a little...”

Mo Fan glanced forward and saw many Carnage Poisonous Salamanders climbing out from the water. They all had different looks and physiques!

There were not merely ten of them. The ones in view already added up to twenty!

Mo Fan exclaimed in his heart, Holy crap, isn’t the Great Salamander Demon afraid of his kidneys exploding!?
