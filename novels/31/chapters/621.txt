The Meteorite Fist’s strength was already overwhelming when Mo Fan was possessed by the Flame Belle. Even Dongfang Lie’s fourth-tier Fiery Fist was no match for it!

Now, Mo Fan had also mastered the fourth-tier Fiery Fist. The 2.5 times multiplier from the Rose Flame made the Fiery Fist: Nine Serpents even fiercer!

When combining the fourth-tier Fiery Fist and little Flame Belle’s Possess, the Meteorite Fist: Nine Serpents was simply too violent; even a Commander-level undead would have a hard time against it!

Either way, it was clear that the Meteorite Fist: Nine Serpent’s damage had reached the level of an Advanced Spell.

Mo Fan had already felt that when all his forty-nine Stars were strengthened, the combination of the little Flame Belle’s Possess and the fourth-tier Fiery Fist was definitely comparable to an Advanced Spell. To his surprise, the damage was even stronger than he had imagined. It surely had no match in the Intermediate Level!

“I’ll leave the rest to you two,” yelled Mo Fan. He quickly caught up to the crowd, not daring to stay on the street any further.

Mo Fan acted like he was an expert who had been living in seclusion, stepping forward in the nick of time to change the outcome of the battle, before letting the two Imperial Magician subordinates clear up the rest of the mess. The truth was, his energy was completely depleted. If he did not find a place to rest up soon, even the smallest undead, or a little skeleton, was enough to take his life away.

However, the two Imperial Magicians had to admit that Mo Fan’s punch had helped them a great deal, giving Zuo Feng the chance to control the Flesh Mound Corpse Official for five seconds.

Even if it was only five seconds, a Commander-level creature could easily destroy an army of undead within one to two seconds. The five seconds were enough to force the Flesh Mound Corpse Official to roll into a ball and crush a few hundred of the skeletons it had produced!

The little skeletons were quite pitiful. Just a moment ago, they were charging with their king to hunt the living humans, but their king suddenly went mad after it was knocked flying by the Magician, and rolled in their direction instead. Since the undead had basically died once before, no one cared how distressed they were. Regardless, even using all their limbs trying to run away, they still could not escape the shadow looming over them as their king rolled toward them.

The wide street was covered in pieces of skeletons. The phantoms, which possessed a dim intelligence, fled into the distance when they saw the Corpse Official turning hostile.

Without the disturbance from the little phantoms and undead generals, the two Imperial Magicians were able to cast Advanced Spells consecutively. The impact almost crumbled the entire street!

“Zuo Feng, who was that guy?” The square-faced Imperial Magician was an Earth Magician. He successfully turned the Flesh Mound Corpse Official into stone using the Eyes of the Rock Demon. He let out a relieved sigh before recalling the young Fire Magician.

“I have no idea, either; I thought he was just a university student with the Shadow Element!” Zuo Feng turned around, but failed to find the young man.

“Who would have thought it was him helping us to control the situation. Otherwise, we would have left the people to disaster,” murmured the square-faced Imperial Magician.

Zuo Feng nodded.

As a matter of fact, the three Imperial Magicians would not have had much trouble killing the Flesh Mound Corpse Official, but it was too important to let the higher-ups know about the Flesh Mound Corpse Official’s terrifying ability. Without the third Imperial Magician, it had almost slaughtered the crowd of civilians.

Luckily, the university student with Shadow Element was monstrously strong, and blasted the Flesh Mound Corpse Official away using just an Intermediate Spell!

“Could it be that he has a Soul-grade fire?” The square-faced Imperial Magician glanced at the Flesh Mound Corpse Official, making sure that the creature was unable to break free from being petrified.

“No, I was quite close to him. It must be some rare Magic Tool, which is able to boost his fourth-tier Fiery Fist significantly,” replied Zuo Feng.

Zuo Feng only saw Mo Fan being engulfed in flames suddenly. He did not see the little Flame Belle entering Mo Fan, so he could only explain it as some kind of Magic Tool.

“Fourth-tier Fiery Fist...that’s forty-nine Soul Essences! If one Soul Essence is between four to five million RMB... is he the son of some incredible renowned family?” asked the square-faced Imperial Magician in astonishment.

An Imperial Magician like him had to save up many years just to buy Magic Wings, which were priced around a hundred million. Meanwhile, the young man had already leveled up his Fire Element to the fourth-tier; he would need more than two hundred million to do that!

Anything over ten million was considered a great sum to Advanced Magicians, let alone anything over a hundred million. Nevertheless, there was no way for an Imperial Magician like him to have so much money.

Having money didn’t mean you could simply spend it like that!

“Either way, his fourth-tier Fiery Fist saved everyone’s life,” said Zuo Feng calmly.

It was rare for anyone to raise their Basic Spells to the fourth-tier, let alone a fourth-tier Intermediate Spell, which would require a huge amount of resources. Even someone with an extraordinary natural talent, like Dongfang Lie, could barely cast the fourth-tier Fiery Fist. Someone that had actually raised an Intermediate Spell to the fourth-tier... Mo Fan was most likely the only one in all of China!

And now, these two Imperial Magicians had just happened to stumble into a man with a fourth-tier Fiery Fist. Shouldn’t they be burning incenses and bowing down to express their gratitude to Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion?

“After killing this son of a bitch, let’s go look for him. We need someone strong like him in times like this!,” exclaimed the square-faced Imperial Magician.

“Forget it, he’s still an Intermediate Magician, I can feel his mind weakening. His energy must have depleted. It’s likely that he didn’t even have the chance to rest after the battle along the walls...” Zuo Feng was able to sense some information through his Psychic Element.

“Alright, once the danger is resolved, we should go and thank him.”

“Mm, if we manage to resolve the danger...” Zuo Feng glanced at the city being drenched by the rain. He obviously was not too optimistic about their fate.

——

Mo Fan was completely worn out, as it was true that he had been involved in battles since the night before.

The Swift Star Wolf could still barely move after being healed. Mo Fan simply laid down on its back and fell asleep. If anything, his Summoned Beast would just wake him up.

Mo Fan did not follow the crowd. He had done all he could, and all he could not, too. He would leave the people to their own fates, since he was not Sun Wukong trying to escort them along their Journey to the West.

—

Mu Bai and Zhou Ming were more compassionate. There were people from Bo City among the crowd, so they decided to escort them all the way to the inner city.

Mo Fan did not head for the inner city. He had to look for Liu Ru still.

The Swift Star Wolf told Mo Fan that Liu Ru was in a different direction. Mo Fan said goodbye to Zhou Ming and Mu Bai and proceeded to search for Liu Ru by asking the Swift Star Wolf to follow her scent.

Shorty did not follow Mo Fan either. He had gone to search for his Hunter friends. The group split up after telling everyone that they would see each other behind the inner walls.

It was better for Mo Fan to act alone. After all, the Swift Star Wolf had a sensitive nose, helping him to avoid unnecessary fights.

The Swift Star Wolf slowly avoided the undead, considering that Mo Fan’s energy was gone. Once they located Liu Ru, Mo Fan’s safety would be secured, as Liu Ru was not weak, either.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
