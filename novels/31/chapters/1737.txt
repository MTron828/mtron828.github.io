Chapter 1740: The Super Level! Part One

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The group left the Qinling Mountains, and no longer had to suffer in the Wind of Sorrow. A sense of freedom surged in their bodies. If they had stayed a few more days in the Qinling Mountains, they might have to regrow their skin!

They stayed in the town below the Qinling Mountains for the night. Mo Fan could not wait to begin his meditation after claiming the Totem Power of the Deer God.

Little Loach had given Mo Fan a huge push in the back. He felt like he would break through the walls of the Super Level in a few days without trying too hard. Every time Little Loach had a breakthrough, it would grant Mo Fan huge benefits, too! Mo Fan did not want to waste the opportunity to strike while the iron was hot!

——

The Stars flowed inside Mo Fan’s Spiritual World. Each color represented a different Element.

The Stars of the Lightning Element and the Fire Element were the most restless. Little Loach had only provided Mo Fan with a single push, so if he did not control it well, it might end up being distributed to every Element. It was unreasonable to split the momentum up, unless the force was actually strong enough to break through the walls of all five of his Elements at once!

“Should I choose the Lightning Element or the Fire Element?” Mo Fan’s head began to hurt as he inspected his two primary Elements.

The energy from Little Loach was only enough to push a single Element to the Super Level. Mo Fan was struggling a little to pick between the Fire Element and Lightning Element, since both of them were ready to advance to the Super Level!

“Lightning Element it is! It’s the big brother, after all,” Mo Fan said to himself.

Mo Fan’s Fire Element was an ace because of Little Flame Belle. Even if his Fire Element reached the Super Level, his Fire Element would not improve by much if Little Flame Belle did not also have a breakthrough. After all, without Little Flame Belle’s help, Mo Fan was only a Fire Mage with the Meteor Scarlet. His control of the Fire Element was too weak!

The Lightning Element was different. The Lightning Tyrant matched Mo Fan’s demon flesh perfectly, and it was significantly stronger than the Meteor Scarlet, too! Besides, Mo Fan had also used the Blessing of the God’s Seal on the Lightning Element to improve its base damage, so the Super Spells of his Lightning Element were going to be insane!

Most importantly, Mo Fan had long desired the Super Lightning Spell, the Seal of Nine Laws. Apart from the imprisonment effect when using the nine lightning halberds, the target trapped inside the spell was constantly blasted by lightning strikes! It might not be ideal against demon creatures with huge numbers, but it was perfect against strong Ruler-level creatures of massive size!

Lightning!

It was decided: he would improve the Lightning Element to the Super Level first!

After making his decision, Mo Fan focused his attention on the Lightning Element’s Galaxy.

Little Loach had been with Mo Fan for many years, and was well aware of its master’s thoughts. It immediately opened the valve, allowing the abundant energy to pour into Mo Fan’s Spiritual World.

“There’s so much!”

Mo Fan was startled. How much did Little Loach even eat it, to provide him with so much energy for the breakthrough?

The tremendous tide surged into Mo Fan’s Spiritual World. The little purple galaxy did not have the space to contain it all. The barrier bounding the galaxy shook hard after the energy slammed into it.

As a matter of fact, the barrier had already been worn down by Mo Fan’s previous breakthrough attempts, but it was simply too solid. It would hardly move unless it was filled up with energy beyond its capacity. It was like a metal cage, while the energy of the galaxy was just an embryo. Even if he smashed himself into pieces, the walls of the cage would hardly budge!

It was possible for an Intermediate Mage to break through to the Advanced Level with talent, determination, and the energy they had accumulated on their own, but the energy accumulated by oneself was nowhere enough for to break through to the Super Level. Every Super Mage had relied on some rare natural resources, absorbing that energy into their Spiritual World and using it to break the cage!

These sources of tremendous energy were not necessarily compatible with a Mage’s constitution, so every Super Mage had their own way of achieving the Super Level, which would affect the spells they would be able to use in the future. The process no longer followed the standard outline of the early levels.

People with greater control over their Elements found it easier to find their unique path. Mo Fan’s Fire Element was a great example. His Fire Element was no longer restricted to the respective form of the Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Spells. His Fire Burst, Fiery Fist, and Sky-Flame Funeral could take different forms, based on the capabilities of his Fire Element.

The minor variations available to an Advanced Mage were only the beginning. Only those in the Super Level were able to modify their spells as they pleased!

——

It was a quiet night with sparse stars.

There were no colorful clouds, nor an overwhelming ripple of energy bursting out of the room in the little town to alert every great talent nearby. There was not even the special effect when a player’s HP and MP fully recovered after leveling up...

The broken pieces of the barrier were scattered through the vast Galaxy. Apart from the deep look in Mo Fan’s eyes and the sense of relief in his heart, breaking through did not startle even a single blade of grass or tree. Bold mosquitoes were still circling Mo Fan’s head while struggling to decide if they were going to drink his blood from his forehead or his neck. They were totally unaware of how terrifying the man they were up against was.

Whapwhapwhap!

Finally, Mo Fan grinned while swatting the mosquitoes away at a ridiculous speed.

“Phew~!” Mo Fan opened his palms and blew the dead mosquitoes away. He had a calm face, while his eyes flickered with the arrogance of someone superior.

Such a petty life was gone so easily...

Normally, he would gladly toy around with the dead bodies of the mosquitoes he had killed with his own hands for some time and utter a few curses before getting rid of them, but he was now a Super Mage. His frame of mind had escalated. It was no longer necessary to be fussy about these lowly creatures!

“I’n not drunk, I’n not drunk, I don need your help!”

Zhao Manyan waved his hand in front of the bar. He insisted on not letting Zhang Xiaohou support him.

“Brother Zhao, I know you are not drunk, but I wouldn’t want to embarrass myself, either. You can either walk properly, or stop telling people that you’re my brother. I’m still the person-in-charge here,” Zhang Xiaohou replied. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
