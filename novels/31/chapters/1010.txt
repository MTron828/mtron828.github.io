Both Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue had fought against Egypt’s National Team before. The team was far from impressive, yet they were unsure where they got their confidence from.

As such, the team defending Egypt’s Training Hall was surely not as impressive, either. When Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, Jiang Yu, Zhao Manyan, Jiang Shaoxu, and Nanyu arrived, they immediately learned that the others had already acquired the stamp from Egypt.

“Didn’t we have enough stamps?” Nanyu counted the countries they had won against and realized that their adventure had been quite successful, apart from Peru’s stamp, which they had discarded in anger. They had managed to secure stamps from all the countries they visited, including the American team that had been relatively challenging.

“So that means Egypt will be our last stop before we depart for the City of Canals, Venice?” asked Mu Tingying with anticipation.

It had been quite a long journey, and they had almost gone around the world. They were finally close to reaching their final destination, Venice. The difficulties, challenges, and failures they had encountered suddenly felt not as significant, as their brilliance at Venice was surely going to cover up their past!

“By the way, what job did the advisors give us this time?” Li Kaifeng asked.

“What else does Egypt have? Isn’t it obviously going to be the Kingdom of Undead?”

“Are you serious? I hate zombies and things like them the most!”

Undead!

There were two famous territories of undead. One was located in China’s Ancient Capital, while the other was in Egypt. The pyramids were the undead’s habitat. They were like a tower of souls, summoning the undead to it. The undead were active within a hundred kilometers of the pyramids.

It was basically the undead’s city state! The pyramids were the city centrals, while the lands within a hundred kilometers were their territories. Surprisingly, the undead would never venture too far away from the pyramids...

——

The advisors did not ask the team to leave Egypt. Instead, they were told to head to a city called Puccini. It was around two hundred kilometers away from Cairo, an average-sized city in Egypt.

Arriving in Puccini, the city had an ancient Egyptian feeling to it. Stone fences could still be seen outside the city, and most of the streets and buildings were made of stones, too.

Egypt abounded with Undead Mages, but most cities forbade the use of the Undead Element when unnecessary. There were still quite a lot of ordinary people in this world. Not everyone could accept the rotting flesh and the intimidating looks of the undead. If cities did not implement such rules, the people would feel like they were living among the dead.

The advisors were not really clear about the scope of their job, but based on the description, it was similar to their job in Japan’s East Maritime Fortress. The team was required to spend some time in the city.

The advisors wanted the students to encounter as many kinds of demon creatures as possible, so they would learn how to react accordingly when fighting against different creatures!

“Strange, why does it look like many people are injured here?” Mo Fan could see people helping the injured move around on the street, and it wasn’t just once or twice.

“I heard a local saying that Puccini City hasn’t been peaceful lately. It seems like something did happen here,” Nanyu said.

As soon as Nanyu finished, they immediately saw a few Wind Mages carrying a white stretcher making their way to the center of the city with the help of Wind Track.

A man wrapped in white bandages lay on the stretcher. There were fresh bloodstains across the bandages, with blood dripping and falling into the gaps between the rocks as they passed by along the bumpy road!

“That man has lost his legs, I managed to catch a glimpse of the wounds, it looked like they were torn off!” Guan Yu exclaimed.

The pain from having both legs being torn off was not something an ordinary person could endure. It was much worse than amputating them with a perfect cut. In addition to that, the injured would also suffer excessive blood loss!

When they reached a crossroad, they could see the injured continuously being escorted into the city from both sides.

The path led to the City South Hill. The team saw an obvious slope once they proceeded another thousand meters forward.

It was supposed to be a main street, but it was no longer accessible to vehicles, as more and more injured were being delivered to a white tent with golden trim...

It turned out that the tent was the same place that the advisors had asked the team to report to. The tents were joined together into a spacious area able to accommodate more than a thousand people. There were even Battlemages standing guard.

“That symbol...” Nanrong Ni saw a symbol resembling a wheel of flowers on a tent.

The symbol was designed with incredible detail. When looking at it from different angles, they could see similar but inverted flowery patterns. The patterns were then joined together into a milky-white wheel of flowers with golden-blue edges.

One could easily tell that the symbol represented a world-famous organization. The wheel of flowers with reflections of different colors compared to its base color was meant to prevent others from impersonating the organization!

Mo Fan’s knowledge was fairly limited. He had no clue what the symbol represented, but based on Nanrong Ni’s reaction, he could easily tell that it was something she had great respect for; the admiring glitter from her eyes said it all.

“I will ease the pain for you, but you must calm down and tell me how you end up like this, so it’s easier for me to treat your injuries,” a gentle voice spoke up.

Her voice seemed to have some sort of magic, helping the person who had lost his legs to calm down slowly, as if he could no longer sense the overwhelming pain.

“I...I stumbled into two Poisonous Golden Mummies, one was grabbing me while the other dug its claws into my legs. I immediately fainted. When I woke up, I was already being carried here. I know you’ve temporarily eased the pain with the Psychic Element, but I know I will never get my legs back. The injuries inflicted by the Poisonous Golden Mummies are incurable, not to mention how young you look.” The injured was a Mage from the Magic Association. He seemed to have lost hope.

“I can help you recover,” the woman smiled.

The assistant frowned when he heard the impolite comment from the Mage. The man obviously did not think the Servant of the Hall of the Goddess was capable of treating his wounds!

He should take a closer look at his condition. He should be grateful that he was able to survive the injuries!

The injured Mage did not seem to have any hope. He lay still with bloodshot eyes, and was regretting his decision. It had been years since he had last fought against demon creatures. He was offered a stable job in the Magic Association, but he ended up in such a devastating state. He swore he would never fight the savage undead again.

The Mage started grumbling when the pain gradually returned.

However, before he could sneer at the intern that was arranged to treat his wounds, he was shocked to discover that his legs were growing!

Growing was the best way to describe it, as the broken veins, bones, and flesh were regenerating slowly, reconnecting with the legs that had been torn off.

The glowing, milky-white liquid hovering above the intern’s hand with a strong presence of vitality slowly dripped onto his legs with a sacred light, helping his body reconnect with his legs.

The Mage stared at his legs in disbelief...

The flesh had merged perfectly, followed by the outer skin layer. When he saw his legs returned to normal perfectly without a single scar, he was utterly dumbfounded!

His position in the Magic Association was rather high, meaning that he had met quite a few experienced Healers. But from what he knew, no one in the city could possibly treat his wounds. The Poisonous Golden Mummies were infamous for the damage they inflicted being incurable. Their strong presence of death meant the scars and wounds stayed forever!

But now, his legs were back!

When the intern withdrew the Psychic Spell, the man immediately felt his legs, as if nothing had happened to them.

It was a miracle!

The man was overwhelmed by excitement. Joy and the shame from looking down at the Healer were blatantly displayed on his face. He was lost for words all of a sudden when he felt the urge to thank the woman with magical powers.

“Rest well, the muscles in your legs are still recovering, don’t too anything too vigorous for the next three days,” she advised the Mage in a gentle voice. The Healer was friendly and calm as usual.

“Three days? Just three days?” The Mage was having trouble believing it.

“My God, not only did he recover from the serious injuries right on the spot, he is going to be back to normal in just three days?” someone among the crowd exclaimed.

“How unbelievable, I have never seen such a capable Healer!”

The assistant let out a satisfying smile when he heard the praises from the crowd. He said in a slightly proud voice, “I have already told you, she is a disciple of our Parthenon Temple’s Hall of the Goddess, she is practicing the most perfect Healing Magic in the world!”

“Hall of the Goddess, so it’s the Hall of the Goddess!”

“No wonder, that explains it all! It’s impressive knowing that she is a Mage from the Hall of the Goddess at such a young age!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The woman had a humble smile as she was complimented by the crowd, but the assistant raised his head arrogantly.

—

“Mmm, why does that beautiful lady look so familiar?” Zhao Manyan suddenly asked.

Saying this, Zhao Manyan immediately turned to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had stopped moving. He stood still with his eyes fixed on the Healer who was being praised by the crowd!
