Chapter 2662: A Disaster

Fanxue City…

The vehicles were jammed on the streets as troops of uniformed Mages headed toward Fanxue Mountain.

The peaceful city started panicking at the sudden moves. Its people had no clue what was happening. After all, the sudden appearance of the local army might mean some powerful demon creatures had appeared.

However, the people soon noticed the army had surrounded Fanxue Mountain and sealed off the entire area. Even communication signals were being jammed. It was obvious they were going to attack Fanxue Mountain.

“What’s happening? Hasn’t Fanxue Mountain always been close to the local government? Why are they being treated like traitors?” Many people discussed while observing Fanxue Mountain from a safe distance.

“(Sigh), the misfortunes just keep coming. Not only are the powerful clans picking on the smaller clans, but some officials and Councilmen in the government are also robbing people of their resources and valuables like bandits. If you don’t give them what they want, they will accuse you of treason, but once you handed it over, they will just ask for more. Fanxue Mountain isn’t as powerful as the Mu Clan, Zhao Clan, and Zu Clan, yet it’s rich in resources. It was only a matter of time until they were targeted!”

“This is unreasonable! We moved to Fanxue City a long time ago. The people of Fanxue Mountain have contributed greatly to turning this barren land into a developed city. The city has also taken in many refugees after the Headquarters Cities were established. Either way, Fanxue Mountain’s contributions should be recognized. How could the government of Feiniao Headquarters City destroy the bridge after crossing the river!?”

“Yeah, they have sent out so many soldiers, too! They were never this proactive when they were fighting the sea monsters. This is insane!”

The people started complaining angrily. After all, everyone knew Fanxue City was a private territory. Mu Zhuoyun and Mu Linsheng had given its residents a lot of help through welfare policies. The safe environment Fanxue City had provided its people was a luxury in a time like this, when a city could be taken out by the sea monsters within a single night.

“Fanxue Mountain is planning to embezzle a national treasure! You will be accused of treason if you don’t hand it over! Unauthorized personnel should leave at once to guarantee your safety!”

Some officials were blatantly announcing the false accusations. They needed a valid excuse to start the battle, or they would only get themselves in trouble. They needed something to say if their superiors started asking questions. They also needed to explain themselves to the locals.

“I’m the mayor of Feiniao Headquarters City’s North City. Fanxue Mountain has taken our country’s important asset and colluded with foreigners to smuggle it out of the country. The military is here to intercept this treasonous act! All people who are irrelevant should move behind the perimeter to avoid unnecessary danger. From now on, I am in charge of Fanxue City!” Lin Kang’s voice echoed above the city.

The broadcast was playing throughout the city with the help of two Sound Mages. They kept repeating the same words, trying to convince the people that Fanxue Mountain was responsible for a treasonous crime.

However, the people were not idiots, and they would not be manipulated so easily.

Over the past year, the local government had not done anything to help the people. In contrast, it had been stripping money and resources from its citizens. Many clans and organizations were displeased by it.

The people soon organized a protest against the lockdown. The tourists, Hunters, and businessmen who were only in Fanxue City temporarily were angry at the government, too!

However, these ordinary people did not have the strength and courage to stop the government. They could only express their anger behind the perimeter. Not many were willing to step forward for Fanxue Mountain’s sake.

——

A thick mist had covered the city’s harbor. A ship with white and blue paint was slowly coming into the harbor.

The harbor had a special zone assigned for Fanxue Mountain. When the ship reached the zone, the people on it were surprised to see a luxurious silver cruiser had already taken its spot. A woman in a cheongsam was leaving the cruise ship, surrounded by a huge group at attendants.

“It’s the Nanrong Clan’s ship. What are they doing parking their ship in our spot? This is Fanxue City, Lord Mu Ningxue’s territory. Are they trying to provoke Fanxue Mountain?” a member of the Foehn Hunter Squad exclaimed.

The Foehn Hunter Squad’s leader Gu Ying, the shorty Zhong Li, Xie Hao, and its other members had joined Fanxue Mountain and became one of the elite patrol squads.

They had been doing well and had reached the Advanced Level. They mainly took orders from Shao Yu.

They had just come back from Gold Coral Island. They were looking forward to getting some rest, but they noticed something serious had happened after they arrived at the harbor.

Zhong Li suddenly ran back to them and yelled, “This is bad, our supporter is in big trouble!”

Gu Ying’s expression sank. “Are the sea monsters attacking?” he asked quickly

“It’s worse than that! The mayor of North City, Lin Kang has organized a crusade against Fanxue Mountain. It’s now being surrounded by an army. The powerful Mages of many renowned clans are also on their way. They are going to wipe out the whole mountain!” Zhong Li yelled.

“That is a disaster. We are considered unauthorized personnel too, right? Should we run?” a new member asked cautiously.

“Why are we running? We are members of Fanxue Mountain. We should be helping when it’s in trouble. If it weren’t for Fanxue Mountain’s support, we wouldn’t have been able to reach the Advanced Level! We would still be working pettily and risking our lives for Hunter Masters. How can we be so ungrateful?!” Gu Ying scolded the members who were thinking about running away.

“But...”

“Boss, look, isn’t that Nanrong Xu, who is known as the New King of the South China Sea? He’s the first seed to win the upcoming title of Senior Hunter!”

“First seed? It’s already decided he’s going to earn the title. He could have long acquired the title if it weren’t for the rule that they can only give out the Senior Hunter Title to two people every ten years. I heard that many elders in the Hunter Union can’t match his strength!”

“Seriously? Even Nanrong Xu is here? Fanxue Mountain is really in deep trouble!” Xie Hao cried out.

Nanrong Xu was once a Hunter, and had made a huge name for himself in the south. The Hunter Union had acknowledged his strength. How was Fanxue Mountain going to survive? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“It must be Nanrong Ni, that b**ch. She cannot wait to destroy Fanxue Mountain and kill Mu Ningxue!” Gu Ying snarled.
