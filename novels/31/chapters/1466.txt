1467 Safer to Wear Them

Translated by XephiZ

“Why can’t I take it off?’ Zhao Manyan tried taking the bracelet off as soon as he put it on. To his surprise, the bracelet was hanging to his wrist tightly with some strange magic, preventing him from taking it off!

“Stop wasting your time; even we can’t take them off!” Professor Zheng replied.

“Does that mean you’ve tried to take it off before, Professor Zheng?” Mo Fan asked immediately.

Professor Zheng blushed and explained, “I was just trying to figure out how it works. I wasn’t thinking of anything else.”

The others chuckled when they saw Professor Zheng’s reaction. Even Professor Li had a thoughtful smile.

“Girls don’t have to wear one,” Professor Li said when he saw Li Ximei and two other women about to put the bracelets on.

“Girls don’t have to wear it? Aren’t they discriminating against men, then? They claim that men and women are equal, so why do I feel like they are strongly biased against men instead?” Mo Fan grumbled.

“So what if we’re biased against you? This is the Alps Institute, no one is forcing you if you don’t want to enter!” A woman dressed in a milky white robe with white-golden embroidery had shown up outside the pavilion!

Her outfit was a little retro. It resembled the outfit of a monastery, but it looked more delicate and luxurious than the simple outfits of a nun, and even had a silver hood. The woman pulled the hood down as if she was not willing to reveal her face. Even when she raised her chin, the people could only see her proud gaze and her good-looking, pointy chin…

“Your Chinese is pretty good?” Mo Fan looked at the woman, eying her up and down.

“I’m Chinese, but I didn’t grow up in China, nor do I have a good impression of it. My mentor has asked me to usher you. If you aren’t happy, I can help you take off the bracelet, and you may leave,” the woman replied in an unfriendly tone.

“I’m in, of course I’m going in, I’m pleased to go inside you,” Mo Fan answered with a perverted grin.

The woman did not react. She turned around and led the way, her slender waist wriggling.

After walking a dozen meters, the woman suddenly turned around. She glared at Mo Fan and asked, “What did you mean by that!?”

“What else could I mean? I was referring to exchanging our understanding of magic at close distance, and as a safety measure, you are asking us men to wear something. Why wouldn’t I understand?” Mo Fan answered seriously.

“You…you prick!” the woman pointed at Mo Fan, trembling in anger.

“Oh, our Chinese language is so profound. You might have misunderstood me since you didn’t study it much. Don’t get me wrong, I might seem a little laid-back, but it doesn’t mean I refuse anybody,” Mo Fan said.

The woman was so angry that her magic was already rippling around her. Normally, the people that came to the Alps Institute were careful and extremely mindful of their actions. She had never seen anyone so frivolous and shameless!

He even said that he was not the kind to refuse anybody. Wouldn’t that mean he was unwilling even if she was willing!?

If a person with such filthy thoughts was allowed to enter the Alps Institute, he was surely going to profane every sacred stalk of grass and tree of the place!

“Senior, we should hurry up and bring them to the mountain, mentor told us…” a woman in a similar outfit, without the white-golden embroidery spoke up.

This woman was almost a head shorter than the first one, but her physique was more attractive, especially curves that were more obvious than the taller, more slender woman.

“We’ll take care of that disrespectful guy when we are at the school,” the petite woman said in a voice that only the two of them could hear.

The tall woman grinned upon hearing the words.

She was right; if she drove the shameless guy away now, she would still be angry at him, since he could just leave like nothing had ever happened.

The Alps Institute did not care about having conflicts, but they would not allow anyone to disrespect them. They had to teach the guy who dared to insult the women of the Alps Institute a lesson!

The tall woman felt a lot better after making her decision. She led the way while trying to figure out a way to teach the people behind her a lesson!

“Sheryl, Edith, I don’t think this is the way to the institute?” Professor Li asked after a few minutes.

“Professor, that is because we would normally invite our important guests to be baptized by the waters of the Alps. Do you see the waterfall ahead?” Edith said with a smile. She looked as harmless as the girl next door, yet her eyes were flickering cunningly. She was clearly a little vixen that could not be tricked so easily.

“Are you referring to Faerun Waterfall?” Professor Li inquired.

“Exactly, seniors can come with us to the back of the waterfall, but young Mages must receive the baptism, especially those with a corrupted heart and soul. They must be cleansed before entering the Alps Institute,” Sheryl said calmly. She purposely glanced at Mo Fan after finishing her sentence.

“But I was told that only the teaching staff with outstanding cultivation could make it through the Faerun Waterall?” Professor Li said.

“Just think of it as a trial. Didn’t the students of Pearl Institute come in first in the World College Tournament? I believe our little trial here won’t be too difficult for your Mages,” Edith said.

The two women continued leading the way. The others could hear a loud waterfall in the distance.

The sound was extremely clear, and they thought Faerun Waterfall was right behind the mountain ahead of them, yet they still did not see it after crossing several valleys and a few mountains. The sound grew even more deafening. It felt like everything in their surroundings was trembling!

“It seems like we’ve really offended these two young women,” Professor Li let out a sigh and turned to Mo Fan.

“They are deliberately making things difficult for us?” Mo Fan asked.

“Faerun Waterfall’s force is quite terrifying. An Advanced Mage won’t last even a second in it. If anyone tries to reach the cave behind the waterfall, they will need outstanding tenacity and determination. It’s a very difficult type of training in the Alps Institute,” Professor Li said.

“You’ve brought it upon yourself, you will have to clean up the mess on your own!” Shi Junsheng said to Mo Fan in a displeased tone.
