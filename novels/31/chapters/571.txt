Dark clouds hung low in the sky, it felt like they could almost touch the top of the observation tower.

A man in uniform was sitting inside the observation tower, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. His eyes were lazily scanning the dusky land ahead.

A few skeletons were roaming aimlessly, while a few zombies were leaning against the walls, trying to climb them. A few fairly quick undead were sprinting around. These were like small animals in the eyes of the soldiers, hence the man simply did not put too much attention on them.

Suddenly, the Heavenly Eagle circling around the observation tower let out a warning cry.

The soldier quickly spat out the cigarette in his mouth and locked his gaze in the direction the Heavenly Eagle had warned him about.

Two deep groans echoed in the darkness, followed by a huge section of the solid ground being shoved aside. A creature with horns like bulls, but in the wrong direction, rose from the gap.

When it stomped its feet on the ground, it immediately blew away the dust all around it.

The sinister bones were making a terrifying crackling noise as the creature moved. Its bloodshot eyes were like two LED lamps, emitting an eerie glow!

The creature immediately saw the Heavenly Eagle soaring in the sky as soon as it woke up from its sleep. It was enraged and tossed a giant rock into the sky.

The Heavenly Eagle reacted swiftly, altering its path and dodging the rock.

The Heavenly Eagle did not dare to stay any longer. It quickly returned to the observation tower.

The man in uniform observed the creature’s direction of movement and frowned. He brought a communication device to his lips and said sternly, “Attention, a Warrior-level undead has appeared in the northeast. Attention, a Warrior-level undead has appeared in the northeast. It seems like it’s trying to destroy the walls. Eliminate it at once!”

——

The voice soon spread into the tower, including the room the students were waiting in.

The Hunter in his thirties immediately rose to his feet. He glanced at the group, who had fully prepared themselves, and said, “It’s a Warrior-level undead! The other teams were all entrusted with missions. It seems like we’ll have to deal with it.”

“Humph, it’s meaningless to only fight against the Servant-class undead. They should have let us fight against Warrior-level creatures long ago,” Jiang Li laughed with great anticipation.

“We’ll receive lots of merits if we can kill a Warrior-level undead!” said the female student wearing a hat excitedly.

“Warrior-level undead are fairly savage, we have to be more cautious,” warned the Hunter.

“It won’t be a problem for us. Our only worry is that these guys who just joined us are only a bunch of rookies. They are likely going to wet their pants soon,” replied Jiang Li.

——

The team had seven people: the Hunter who was the team’s leader, the irritating Jiang Li, the handsome man, the girl wearing a hat, Zhou Ming, Mo Fan, and Mu Bai. Wang Pangzi and Zhao Kunsan were staying close to the walls. They were too weak to fight against a Warrior-level undead.

As the seven finished preparing themselves, the Heavenly Eagle Battlemage flew over to them. He glanced at the team and said sternly, “Eliminate the creature as soon as possible. We can’t let it get close to the walls.”

“Don’t worry, the seven of us are all Intermediate Magicians. We won’t have any problem dealing with a Warrior-level undead,” said the Hunter leader.

The team only had five people before. With Mo Fan and Mu Bai in the team, it would be a lot easier to take down a Warrior-level undead.

“Alright, I’ll ask a group of Magicians on the walls to open a path for your team. I’ll leave the rest to you,” said the Battlemage.

A white glowing light appeared on the Battlemage’s hand, which he fired into the sky above the walls.

Once the signal was sent out, a group of Magicians quickly gathered. The uniformed soldiers seemed fairly well-trained, who quickly lining up on the walls.

“Straight ahead, fire!”

The Battlemage in the air gave the group of Magicians the order.

The Magicians immediately drew their Star Patterns. Bright red glows encapsulated them as they finished casting Fire Bursts.

The group consisted of thirty people, each a Fire Magician. Every one of them was holding a ball of restless flame in their hand.

Thirty fireballs were thrown down the walls at the same time, resulting in a small meteor shower pouring down. The undead close to the walls were instantly burned into ashes...

“Continue!”

Another thirty Fire Bursts were launched further away from the walls. The fire immediately dyed the black land red, setting the ground aflame, like a burning red carpet. The undead gathering close to the walls were burned to death.

“Alright, let’s move out!”

The leader waved his hand when he saw the path was cleared, and was the first to jump down from the tall walls.

The others were quite courageous, too, quickly following their leader and jumping down from the walls. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The remaining flames were still burning the ground close to their feet. The group of Fire Magicians on the walls had opened a path for them, allowing them to reach the Warrior-level undead fairly quickly.

Their advance was incredibly smooth, but soon everyone had walked out of the range of the Fire Magicians. They would have to clear the rest of the path themselves.

Everyone in the team was an Intermediate Magician, and adept at using Basic Spells. In order to preserve energy, they were using Basic Spells to handle the zombies and skeletons lunging at them, and occasionally an Intermediate Spell to clear a huge group of undead.

“It’s a Fierce Bone Undead General. It doesn’t have any unique moves, but its body is solid like steel because of its bones, which also grant it a formidable strength...” The experienced Hunter soon identified the type of the Warrior-level undead.

Fierce Bone Undead General, a variant that was considered fairly savage among the undead skeletons. Normally, a team of elite Intermediate Magicians was needed to eliminate it.

As a matter of fact, the Fierce Bone Undead General was already quite close to the walls. It was at most three hundred meters away. As the seven Magicians were charging in its direction, it was also charging at the team.

In the dark, a pair of bloodshot eyes appeared first. As everyone assumed the creature was still some distance away, its sinister white bones were already racing in the team’s direction like a truck!

“Defensive position, maintain the formation, Rock Barrier!” yelled the Hunter.

Even though the Fierce Bone Undead General had yet to collide with anyone, the visual impact of its aggressive attack swept into the team’s minds like a tide of terror!
