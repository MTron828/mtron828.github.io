The fiery sparkles danced like butterflies. Mo Fan left the alley and looked down the street that had been razed to the ground. He noticed the Granite Beast was completely destroyed. Its body had shattered into pieces. There were a dozen people covered in ash there, scattered from its chest to its stomach.

They were the Mages that had been absorbed by the Granite Beast. A few of them were Advanced Mages.

The ash served as a layer of protection for the Mages. Otherwise, their lives might have been in danger when they rolled into the flames.

Mo Fan also noticed something else. These Rock Monsters were only interested in Mages with full energy. They were unable to see those whose energy had been drained away and were no longer fit for battle.

Mo Fan even suspected these creatures were only after energy they could use, and normal people and Mages whose energy had dried out were like stones by the side of the road to them.

“You...you...” Lin Qihui could not find any word after some time.

This Fan Mo was no human. He was a monster!”

“My Earth Element isn’t impressive, but my Fire Element is pretty strong. Senior, you should hurry up and hide in the clock tower. I’ll try my best to find the others,” Mo Fan said.

“No way, I might be too weak to fight these creatures, but I can still carry the unconscious,” Lin Qihui suddenly said righteously, as if he was being influenced by something.

He kept seeing victims falling out of the remains of the Rock Monsters. These people were obviously going to struggle to reach safety on their own. Someone had stepped forward to save them! Lin Qihui felt like he had to do something.

“Alright, get these people to safety then,” Mo Fan nodded.

A few buildings with only two floors were lined up along the street to a junction. It was the city’s marketplace. Some magic tools the merchants had failed to bring away in time scattered across the ground. Magic ores of the Earth Element were scattered like pebbles everywhere, too.

The Granite Beasts were quite intelligent. They discovered the Earth Magic Ores had energy similar to the energy of Mages, so they were collecting the Magic Ores and digesting them.

The city was rich in Earth Magic Ores, so the Granite Beasts had reaped a lot of benefits from the marketplace. The ones here did not bother searching for the human Mages that were avoiding them like loaches.

The street was quite wide, four times as broad as the main road in a city. The tents that had been set up still remained. The place would very be bustling if it was not deserted and messy.

Wen Xia and her subordinates had already split up at the marketplace’s junction, using the stalls as their cover. They secretly snuck up on a Granite Beast that was collecting the Earth Magic Ores.

The Granite Beast did not seem to notice them. Vice Captain Jin was the first to make his move, trying to deal a deadly blow to the monster.

However, the Granite Beast’s hands suddenly enlarged, as if it was long prepared. It smashed its hands fiercely, like a pair of gongs. Vice Captain Jin did not expect the monster to be expecting his attack. The Rock Gongs almost smashed him into pulp!

“Vice Captain Jin!” Wen Xia immediately jumped forward when she saw Vice Captain Jin, whose bones had almost flattened, falling through the air. The Granite Beast caught him and absorbed him directly.

The Granite Beast was extremely quick. The others did not even have time to save the man. They could only watch Vice Captain Jin being absorbed into the Granite Beast’s body.

The metallic gloss on the Granite Beast soon brightened slightly. Bones began to stick out where its joints were like swords, ghastly and terrifying!

“That assh*** absorbed Old Jin, I’m going to smash it into pieces!” Deputy Lieutenant Hou yelled angrily.

“Damn it, we were so careful when sneaking up here! How did it notice us?”

Wen Xia had the same question too. They had snuck up on the Granite Beast without making any mistake along the way. Even Commander-level creatures with sensitive smell and hearing would not notice them, let alone the Granite Beast!

Wen Xia’s other four aides-de-camp were already making their moves. They initially thought the five of them could easily take out the Granite Beast, but the creature had grown significantly stronger after absorbing Vice Captain Jin’s energy. It took the four of them almost five minutes just to defeat it.

It seemed like they were going to struggle to keep their word by taking out the Granite Beasts in ten minutes.

“Keep going!” Wen Xia decided to engage the enemy too, as she could not wait any longer.

Wen Xia took out a Granite Beast at lightning speed, while her four aides-de-camp were handling another Granite Beast at the junction.

Wen Xia was a Super Mage. Her cultivation had been suppressed slightly to comply with the Magic Sealing Order necessary to set up the Barrier Core, thus it felt like she was only an Advanced Mage. She had disregarded the suppression on her cultivation to draw the Star Palace when she and Mo Fan were killing the first Black-Silver Rock Demon. Otherwise, she would not have had to rest up for so long after casting a single Super Spell.

The Barrier was now activated, meaning that the Magic Sealing Order was lifted. It had freed up her mental strength with it. She was finally able to fight with her full strength after reclaiming her three other Elements and full Will.

Wen Xia cleanly took out a strong Granite Beast, but her outstanding strength immediately attracted the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s attention.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon’s level was extremely high. It had a greedy look when it noticed Wen Xia’s cultivation.

It would be one step closer to evolving to the next level once it absorbed a Super Mage. The Black-Silver Rock Demon was enlightened by Wen Xia’s appearance. After all, most Super Mages were surrounded by a huge group of subordinates, but the Battlemaga was almost fighting alone!

Wen Xia was not afraid of the monster. She had already killed one of them recently. She was confident that she could eliminate this leader of the Rock Monsters, too.

“I’ll fight it while Mo Fan is searching for an opportunity for his sneak attack. We should be able to eliminate it quickly,” Wen Xia mumbled to herself.

There was more than one Black-Silver Rock Demon, thus they had to eliminate the leader of the Rock Monsters before them as quickly as possible.

Wen Xia was just about to move when she suddenly saw a black lightning bolt sweep across the night sky. A figure stood on the end of the lightning bolt, engulfed in wild lightning arcs. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Mo Fan?” Wen Xia was puzzled when she saw him.

Wasn’t he supposed to ambush the target? Why did he show himself first?

“These creatures are able to detect our presence through the ground’s vibrations. There’s no use trying to trick them. Let’s fight them head-on!” Mo Fan told Wen Xia.

Mo Fan landed less than fifty meters away from the Black-Silver Rock Demon. He did not show any sign of fear, despite facing the monster that was as tall as a skyscraper!
