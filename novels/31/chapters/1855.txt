At Honglai Silver Mine...

One military truck after another was leaving the outpost with iron nets which had a strong fishy smell.

“Are you all fishermen now? Hurry up and throw those nets away, this whole place stinks because of them,” the captain guard grunted.

“We captured a bunch of nice creatures...” The soldier was in the middle of his sentence when he suddenly heard the sound of a helicopter above. He lifted his gaze and said, “It’s Councilman Nan. He’s back.”

A group of female staffers in black stockings had lined up at the helipad. They were carrying champagne, waiting to celebrate Councilman Nan’s victory.

Someone started shouting in the crowd. They opened the champagne and started pouring them everywhere as Councilman Nan left the helicopter. The female staff members that were gathered here on purpose cheered too.

“Our Great Councilman is back!”

“Our Great Councilman is back!”

Councilman Nan looked at the idiots before him. He finally tore the mask he had been wearing all along off, revealing a terrifying and ugly face.

“Did you do it on purpose?” Councilman Nan glanced coldly at Major General Cai Dong, who he had left in charge of the mine.

The meaningless celebration forcibly reminded Councilman Nan of the frustrating moment during the election. He no longer had to wear a disguise now that he was back in his territory. He snarled, “Piss off, all of you, a bunch of useless pricks!”

The women were terrified. They quickly left with their heads lowered. The atmosphere suddenly became strange.

“Did you transport the things I wanted back here!?” Councilman Nan demanded.

“Do you mean those demon birds? I did transport them here, but the division isn’t too happy about it,” Major General Cai Dong confirmed.

“Humph, not too happy about it? Once my plan succeeds, all of them will be begging me instead!” Councilman Nan said angrily.

“Those creatures seem pretty dangerous. Councilman Nan, should we tighten the security or ask the division to send us more men for a few days?” Cai Dong had to ask.

“That won’t be necessary!. Bring those Carnelian Demon Birds to the base. If we can take control of those greater creatures, the rest of them will be taking orders from us!” Councilman Nan said.

“How brilliant, Councilman, you put in so much effort to establish the domestication ranch back then. It would be a pity if it was really destroyed!” Cai Dong said fawningly.

“I will let those scum in the city regret it! The era of the Heavenly Eagles is over, starting today! I’ll be in charge of the military soon!” Councilman Nan snarled.

That night, on the ridge to the west of Honglai Silver Mine...

Seven Moon-Devouring White Wolves, a sacred silver sheen to their fur gleaming under the moonlight, sprinted rapidly along the irregular terrain. Their fur drifted elegantly in the strong wind.

The mountain had rough terrain covered in rocks, and did not have much vegetation, either. However, it was perfect ground for the Moon-Devouring White Wolves. They did not slow down just because the path ahead was rough, jumping and running along the walls nimbly. They easily overcame every obstacle along the way. The people who were on the Moon-Devouring White Wolves’ backs did not feel it was a rough ride, either.

“It’s just ahead! The Manta Ray Evil Birds have been transported to that silver mine!” Tangyue pointed at the spacious valley in front of the group.

The ridge was tall, and leading them into a huge basin. There was a small, well-lit mining town in the middle of the valley. It consisted mostly of short houses built with stones and temporary warehouses built with metal sheets. The streets interwove with one another irregularly, making the whole place seem a little messy. A veil of dust was cloaking the town under the moonlight, as if it could not dissipate.

Most mining towns suffered from serious pollution and terrible traffic. They were only concerned about transporting valuable materials away, and could not care less about the fate of the land after they were done mining.

“So this is Councilman Nan’s treasure land?” Wen Xia was astounded when she saw the mining town.

The little town looked messy and dirty in the darkness, not to mention the cracks on the streets and the buildings that were exposed during the day. Wen Xia could not help but imagine the Elemental Capital also turning into a junkyard after falling into the hands of Councilman Nan.

Luckily, they had not placed that man in charge of their city!

Their city was actually similar to Honglai Silver Mine, mainly established for transporting resources and goods. Councilman Nan had put up a perfect disguise by proclaiming how good Honglai Mining Town was under his leadership. Everyone believed the Elemental Capital would be as good as he had claimed if he was elected the Great Councilman. However, Wen Xia began to tremble in anger when she saw the truth about the Honglai Silver Mine.

Did he bribe the inspectors or something? The Honglai Silver Mine was absolutely terrible! How could they describe the place as an elegant town to others?

“Isn’t this normal among the politicians? It’s no different from the ladies who keep posting their pictures on social media. All that mattered is their editing skills!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

“How much blood did that Councilman Nan actually suck from the Honglai Silver Mine? He did not spend even a single cent on the buildings! The people in the town must have exchanged their lifespan for money. Imagine living here... even a ghost wouldn’t want to stay here!” Mo Fan spoke up.

Lingling took out her mini laptop. Somehow, she was still able to connect to the Internet. The electronic map of Honglai Mining Town soon appeared on the screen. It had many red flashing dots placed densely together.

“He didn’t spend a single cent on the buildings, but he’s willing to spend a fortune on the security. There are so many Battlemages in the town. There’s the equivalent of a battalion of soldiers there!” Lingling informed them.

“What should we do then? We can’t just break through with force, right? Otherwise, he’s going to accuse us first!” Zhao Manyan said.

“Are the soldiers that put Wanggui Town into lockdown here too?” Mu Bai asked.

Lingling shook her head and said, “They were from Hongling Division, twenty kilometers away. They are like Councilman Nan’s neighbor. Someone specifically assigned them to Wanggui Town before...”

“It’s a relief they aren’t together. The soldiers of the Hongling Division were very strong and well-trained. We wouldn’t stand a chance if we had to fight them,” Mu Bai stated.

“Councilman Nan’s Honglai Mages aren’t to be underestimated, either. After all, there’s such a huge mine here,” Zhao Manyan noted.
