“The Dark Moon Crystal is the best!” Mo Fan exclaimed, staring at the four Ice Mountain Beasts that had been executed.

Mo Fan had once acquired a powerful Dark Material from Feng Zhoulong, which granted his Shadow Element a powerful Curse effect and increased its capabilities. The Dark Moon Crystal had further strengthened his Shadow Element and granted him the Dark Vein that now flowed inside his body.

The Dark Vein’s power was the ability to generate Dark Material continuously, so that even a little Giant Shadow Spike that Mo Fan fired contained an enormous amount of Dark Energy. It could grow rapidly, and was large enough to turn into a creature of the Shadow Tribe within a short period of time!

The Shadow Tribe was able to kill the Ice Mountain Beasts, even though they were Commander-level creatures. Mo Fan still remembered how envious he was of Bei Jiang’s outstanding mix of the Shadow and Chaos Elements. It had felt like the assassin could do whatever he wanted to in the dark. However, Mo Fan knew his Shadow Element had now surpassed Bei Jiang’s after he obtained the Dark Vein.

Ai Jiangtu suddenly appeared behind Mo Fan and asked, “Why aren’t you using your Fire Element?”

“Damn it, can you not Blink behind me out of nowhere? It scared the crap out of me!” Mo Fan shouted.

“I thought you knew. I’ve taken out the Ice Mountain Beasts behind the team. I was thinking of lending you a hand, but it seems like you don’t need it,” Ai Jiangtu answered calmly.

“The Fire Element isn’t effective in a place like this. Besides, Little Flame Belle is with her mother now. Without her, my Fire Element is too weak,” Mo Fan sighed.

He had relied too much on Little Flame Belle’s power. The Fire Element he had abused in the past became a supportive Element when she was not around!

“The Shadow Element should be your strongest Element now then, right?” Ai Jiangtu said.

“More or less, but I am close to learning the Shadow Element’s Star Palace...” Mo Fan admitted.

“You haven’t learned the Shadow Star Palace? Are you saying that these spells were cast with Star Constellations?” Ai Jiangtu was stunned.

The spells of Super Mages had many forms, but they still relied on the energy provided by Star Palaces. Only a Star Palace could provide a large enough amount of energy. Ai Jiangtu did not expect Mo Fan’s Shadow Element to be so powerful when he still had not learned the Star Palace!

The little cub scratched Mo Fan’s head impatiently when Mo Fan stopped.

“Stop waving your tail in my face!” Mo Fan moved the little cub’s tail away.

The little cub growled excitedly at a group of Ice Mountain Beasts around three hundred meters ahead. She could not wait for Mo Fan to charge into them and kill them all!

“Stop crying and go ahead if you want. I just need to mind my own business... can you stop waving your tail!?” Mo Fan was almost at his limit.

Since when would a Summoned Beast order its Summoner around in a fight, not to mention the little cub was not even his Summoned Beast! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The little cub used all her might to growl and provoke the Ice Mountain Beasts, trying to grab their attention.

Mo Fan quickly covered the little cub’s mouth and snarled, “If you keep this up, I’ll send you back to your parents. You can keep the Night Amethyst.”

The little cub immediately shut her mouth when she heard Mo Fan was going to send her back. However, her eyes were still rolling around impatiently.

“I think you two are a perfect match,” Ai Jiangtu observed.

“Why so?”

“You both don’t care how messy things are. I’ll go help Zhao Manyan. I’m leaving this side to you,” Ai Jiangtu said.

“It’s not your first day with Zhao Manyan. If he’s screaming and yelling like a sissy, it means he can still handle it. I think Kuma and the others are in a pinch. You should consider helping them,” Mo Fan said.

“Why are you interested in helping them now?” Ai Jiangtu was confused.

“We have no idea what’s going to happen after we find the Tianshan Sacred Lotus, but the Mailong Private Military Group will most likely take our side,” Mo Fan hinted.

“You’re right. We should keep an eye on them.”

—

When the group reached the middle section of the Ice Mountain Beasts’ den, they saw a huge shadow like a mountain standing in the path they were heading into. It was far bigger than the normal Ice Mountain Beasts. It did not engage them when they pressed forward. It remained still and stared at the intruders coldly. The humans were as good as dead in its dark red eyes, which were almost unseen under its fur!

“The big one over there...” Mu Ningxue said with a hint of fear.

Mu Ningxue had already sensed the creature glaring at her a few times. She wondered if she had gotten the Ice Mountain Ruler’s attention because she had killed the most Ice Mountain Beasts, or perhaps the others were feeling the same thing too!

“A Ruler-level creature!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

A real Ruler-level creature was able to take on five to ten Super Mages. The Super Mages in the alliance were not outstanding, except Yassen and Klope. The others only had one Element in the Super Level.

Therefore, when a Ruler-level creature appeared, the Super Mages of different teams had to immediately come together. Otherwise, the teams would suffer huge casualties.

“I’ll handle it, you keep an eye on the scavengers,” Klope said.

“Sure!”

The Senior Hunter asked the other teams to send a Super Mage over to take on the Ice Mountain Ruler together.

The Mailong Private Military Group was in a terrible spot. They were struggling, as their average strength was weaker than the Ice Mountain Beasts, and kept losing their men. Kuma and Lu Xiu had tried their best to protect their troops, since they might not survive if they lost all their men.

“Team nine, send someone over, we...” Kuma was covered in blood. Most of it belonged to her men.

The Scar of Tianshan Mountain was like Hell to them. The odds of survival were too low for the Mailong Private Military Group. They only had around twenty people left.

“It’s fine, leave it to us, just look after your men,” Ai Jiangtu said.

“Thank you,” Kuma replied sincerely.

“Old Ai... that Ruler-level Flying Snow Fox seems to be ambushing our squad from behind,” Nanyu said.

“Damn it, why does it have to be us!?” Kuma snapped.

The scavengers were most likely targeting them because they were too weak. The Mailong Private Military Group did not have many people left, yet they were still being ambushed by the scavengers.

It was making matters worse!
