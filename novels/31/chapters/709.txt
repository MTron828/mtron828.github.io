“Brother Mo Fan, the sun has risen.”

“I know.”

“About that thing, can we find the answer on Baidu?” asked Xinxia softly.

{TL Note: Baidu is both a search engine and a forum, like Google and Reddit.}

Mo Fan scratched his head and put down his phone.

Even saving the world was not a problem for him, yet when it came to becoming a real man, how did he not succeed after an entire night?

What had gone wrong? Xinxia had finally stopped struggling with her eyes closed and her lips sealed, but in the end, he had let himself down as he failed to put it in!

“Let’s take a snooze and go shopping in the afternoon to take our minds off. We’ll try it again at night?” Mo Fan finally compromised, asking Xinxia in a serious voice.

Xinxia nodded and squeezed her way into Mo Fan’s embrace with a hint of fatigue. She soon fell asleep, her hands hugging Mo Fan tightly.

When Mo Fan saw the girl fast asleep, he immediately took out his phone and went on Baidu again, trying to find the answer to his awkward question.

Sigh, they all mentioned something about the lack of foreplay... forget it, time to get some sleep. He was truly a failure as a man, it was better if he had simply died in the Ancient Capital!

The sunlight around two or three in the afternoon was extraordinarily soothing. It shone down upon a small orange tree in the garden. The unripe fruits on the branches suddenly became lustrous.

Rapid footsteps could be heard coming from the streets, with the occasional giggles of young girls grabbing the attention of the residents, giving them an urge to peek out of the window to observe their youthful looks.

After dressing up, Mo Fan walked around the street with a totally different feeling compared to yesterday.

Xinxia was rolling the wheelchair herself. She was discussing some of the interesting tales about the ancient town with Mo Fan in a good mood. However, when they arrived at some stairs, she was forced to stop and look at Mo Fan with glittering eyes.

“Brother Mo Fan, can you stop thinking about that problem?” asked Xinxia with a serious yet embarrassed tone.

“Oh, oh, I wasn’t thinking about...” Mo Fan laughed and took a step forward, “Holy crap!”

Mo Fan lost his balance as he took an infirm step. Luckily, he was a lot more agile after he became an Advanced Magician. At least he did not fall on his face after tripping.

He quickly rose to his feet and patted the dust off his clothes. He finally realized that he had to lend Xinxia a hand. He quickly went up and carried both Xinxia and the wheelchair down the stairs.

Some girls nearby were giggling. Mo Fan quickly pushed the wheelchair and left the scene in embarrassment.

Xinxia asked Mo Fan to stop when they arrived at the back of an antique store.

“What is it?” asked Mo Fan with a confused look.

“Look at the ground,” Xinxia pointed at the somewhat moist path.

Mo Fan glanced forward and saw dead little bugs on the ground. If he pushed the wheelchair further, he would be running over them.

Only Xinxia would notice things like these. If Mo Fan was on his own, he would simply trample them and feel disgusted because they would make his shoes dirty!

“Humph, the ones that drank my blood have probably started a plague, killing so many of them!” said Mo Fan with a hint of disdain. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“They look like moths, not mosquitoes. The ones in our room last night were moths too. They don’t drink blood,” corrected Xinxia.

“Who cares what they are... they are just an eyesore!” Mo Fan turned the wheelchair and passed by the little dead bugs before continuing forward.

Wuzhen had quite a lot of little alleyways and shops. Everywhere they went was like a different world. It turned out that the little things that each store was selling were popular among the tourists, which included some antique umbrellas, hairpins, scarves, bracelets, or some modern phone bags, purses, decorations and earrings. The girls could spend a whole day browsing the shops. The dazzling jewels urged them to buy all of them just so they could wear different sets every day...

“What’s going on, what’s going on here, get rid of those disgusting things on the ground. It’s affecting the customers. Why must you slack every day at work!” As soon as they went into a shop, they heard the owner yelling.

A young shop assistant wearing a gray felt cap clumsily took the broom and swept the things into the dustpan.

Mo Fan discovered that the things were flying moths the size of mosquitoes at a glimpse. It seemed like these things were everywhere they went today.

On second thought, it did seem perfectly reasonable. Wuzhen was built along a river, thus the air had fairly high moisture, perfect for little creatures like these flying moths. No matter how many couples were visiting the place, they were still no match for the flying moths’ speed at laying eggs.

“Greetings... oh, oh...” The shop owner was about to greet Mo Fan and Xinxia, yet a strange look appeared in his eyes when he saw Xinxia on a wheelchair. However, he quickly put up a smile and greeted them.

Mo Fan and Xinxia were already used to it. They simply ignored the look.

Xinxia proceeded to choose the hairpins she liked while Mo Fan browsed the shop indifferently. When he saw the corpses of the flying moths in the trashcan, he asked casually, “Hey boss, does your town have many of these things?”

“Yeah, they never stop appearing. The council has already organized a few disinfections, but these things show up again every spring. I hate them the most; I have a strong urge to spray them with insect repellent every time I see them!” replied the shop owner.

“I don’t like them, either,” said Mo Fan.

“(Sigh), who would like them? I remember there was a plague of them some years ago. There were so many moths that they were as dense as the haze in Shanghai and Beijing. The sky was completely blocked off by the moths. It was impossible to see anything. Everyone had to cover up tightly if they wanted to go outdoors. Even the smallest gap would allow them to squeeze into your clothes. Even though they don’t do any harm, it was simply disgusting!” complained the shop owner.

“That ridiculous?” said Mo Fan.

Flying moths as dense as a haze, how many moths would be flying in the sky?

“The disinfections are useless. I tell you that there’s a Moth Woman in our town, but no one believes me. One day, I was drinking with my friends until late at night. When I was walking on the street, I saw a woman with wings like a moth. Her physique was stunning, and she wasn’t wearing many clothes. Her legs were long and white. When I was about to get closer, a bunch of flying moths lunged at me to block my vision. The next thing I knew, she had already disappeared,” interrupted the shop assistant who was sweeping the floor.

The owner smacked the shop assistant on the head and scolded, “You still dare to mention it, you took my money and went drinking and gambling, and now you’re trying to cover it up with such a lousy excuse. I bet you’ve read too many stories, and went crazy thinking about women all the time!”

“I swear I’m telling the truth. Besides, I’m not the only one that says that in this town,” the shop assistant argued while running around the store.

“I’m not your uncle if I believe your nonsense! If I believed it, I would give you the shop!” The owner chased after the shop assistant.

“You’ve said it! I’ll find her tonight and take a picture of her. If she’s real, you’ll give me the shop!” said the shop assistant.

“Humph, go ahead!” snapped the owner.
