Mung Fangzhou looked behind him. The hills there had turned into broken

pieces of ice.

He looked at the sky that resembled an ice cave tunnel. Mo Fan was right at the

bottom of the cave.

Mu Fangzhou was one of the strongest Ice Mages in the world. A year ago, Mo

Fan would not have stood even a chance against him. The man could have

beaten him easily!

But now, Mu Fangzhou could not even hurt Mo Fan. His face was filled with

despair!

“Impossible. This is not happening!” Mu Fangzhou yelled. Blue veins were

covering his face and neck.

Mu Fangzhou was soon worn out, and fell to the ground feebly. He still had

burns left by the dragon’s breath fist Mo Fan had used on him.

Mo Fan was already standing in front of him. He did not use any magic. He

simply lifted his foot and stomped on Mu Fangzhou, forcing him into the soil.

Mu Fangzhou’s face was broken, but the sense of humiliation was hurting him

more!

“Tm going to spare your worthless life.

Go back and tell the Mu Clan, if anyone dares to trouble the people around me,

including the people of the Mui Clan, Bai Clan, and Fanxue Mountain, Tm

going to visit them again. When that happens, you will regret how a time like

this has given the strong the right to kill as they please!

Mo Fan did not end Mu Fangzhou’s life. He only slammed his face into the dirt

so he could reflect on his actions!

Mo Fan was no longer a minor character that the renowned clans could bully.

He had even left the Chairman of the Asia Magic Association in the Dark Plane

forever. Most importantly, he had never been a nice guy. He would pay back

tenfold what his enemies had done to him!

Mui Clan, the Magic City..

Delicious food was being served at every table. Most people were enjoying

themselves. It was quite difficult to feel so relaxed in the current times, as

there had been fewer joyful occasions ever since the sea monsters had started

invading their territory.

However, no matter how bad the situation was, they could not give up on

pursuing good times. The wedding had to be grand and romantic, leaving

everyone with some fond memories!

“Where did mentor go? Why haven’t I seen him around? Bai Hongfei had gone

around the tables, but he still could not find Mo Fan.

“Well, he might be busy with some business. Hongtei, don’t worry about him.

We will make sure everything is alright,” Mui shan patted Bai Hongfe!’s

shoulder with a smile.

However, he realized he had accidentally spilled the beans.

Mui Nuxin was right beside them. Her thoughts were very sharp, and she

immediately looked at the elders.

“It seems Iike they are hiding something from us,” Mui Nuxin noticed.

“It’s not anything serious…

“Tt’s indeed nothing worth mentioning. I just came back from another plane to

attend your wedding. I must say that fate brought me back in time. I haven’t

had the chance to congratulate you two officially. Here, I’ve brought you two a

gift!” Mo Fan had suddenly appeared!

Aman in ragged clothes was standing beside Mo Fan. His hair was disheveled,

and even his face was bent out of shape.

The man quickly put on an ugly smile with the remaining muscles that were

still functional on his face…after Mo Fan nudged him with his elbow.

The older man brought his hands together and mumbled, “T have come on

behalf of the Mu Clan to congratulate you.”

“Mu Fangzhoul” Mui shan and the elders of the Bai Clan stood up with

Surprised faces.

“It’s me, it seems like there was a misunderstanding between us. After listening

to Mo Fan’s advice, I sincerely realize I was too arrogant and ruthless before. I

have made a lot of mistakes, so I have come here to apologize. Please accept

my apology!” Mu Fangzhou kept glancing nervously at Mo Fan to judge his

reaction while speaking.

Mui Nuxin and Bai Hongfei were left speechless

Mu Fangzhou was an established elder of the Mu Clan. He had threatened to

take out every other clan that dared to oppose him not long ago. How come he

was apologizing to them now out of nowhere?

“Uh.. please have a seat. Either way, you have come as a guest. We are glad to

accept your apology!” Bai Hongfei said politely. The truth was, he had no idea

what to say.

The man was already asking forgiveness on his knees. It was inappropriate to

punch a smiling man. It would not look good if Bai Hongfei threw out someone

who had come to apologize.

“It’s fine, I have other things to attend to. I won’t disturb your wedding, nor

would I dare to ask the rest of you to treat me as your guest,” Mu Fangzhou

turned down the offer.

“Then…” Bai Hongfei looked at Mo Fan. He could roughly guess how Mo Fan

had ‘advised Mu Fangzhou, judging by his swollen face.

Mu Fangahou looked at Mo Fan pleadingly.

He had completely embarrassed himself. However, it was necessary if he

wanted to stay alive. He was a flexible man!

Fine, you may leave now. After all, some of the guests might see you as their

enemy. I wouldn’t want you to ruin their fun..” Mo Fan patted Mu Fangzhou on

the shoulder.

Mu Fangzhou immediately rose to his feet and ran away like a stray dog being

released.

Everyone looked at Mo Fan as soon as Mu Fangzhou had left.

I really like your gift. Thank you very much,” Mui Nuxin said with a beaming

smile.

The gift would affect the fate of her clan. Mu Fangzhou definitely had the

power to destroy a renowned clan. If Mo Fan had not lent them a hand, they

might not have been able to finish the wedding!

Mui Nuxin was sincerely grateful. Bai Hongfei was utterly impressed, too!

Mo Fan was only away for a little over an hour, and the dinner was about to

end. It was ridiculous how he had beaten Mu Fangzhou up and dragged him

here to apologize to them in such a short period.

Just how strong is Mo Fan now?

Mui Shan, Mui Ye, and the elders of the Bai Clan were also thinking the same

question.

Mui Shan drew closer to Mo Fan and asked, “So, what happened?

Did Mo Fan somehow reach a deal with the Mu Clan and convince them to let

their people go, rebuilding the relationship with their clans?

“I killed Fan Ning and his men, and spared Mu Fangzhou’s life,” Mo Fan

answered succinctly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You killed Fan Ning, the Great Elder of the Mu Clan?” Mui Shan almost

dropped his jaw on the table.

They were supposed to be several hundred kilometers away. Mo Fan had fought

Mu Fangzhou and Fan Ning by himself!

However, he had killed one and forced the other to surrender before the dinner

came to an end!

Was Mo Fan still human?
