Mu Ningxue knew a little about Mu Yinfeng’s ability.

Unfortunately, her arrow had not killed Mu Yinfeng instantly. Otherwise, she would not have had the chance to complete her Reincarnation.

Mu Ningxue took a deep breath. She was not too worried about it.

There was still a long way to go. The Mu Clan would not be taken down so easily. However, it was time for her to settle the debt with certain people!

Nanrong Ni had come to watch Mu Ningxue bleed. She had forgotten she was currently standing in front of Mu Ningxue.

Without Mu Yinfeng’s protection, she was no different from Mu Tingying!

“Since you like the Ice Crystal Bow so much, as a friend for many years, I shall gift it to you myself,” Mu Ningxue offered with a wicked smile.

She pulled back the string of the bow again, but this time, she did not pour all her energy into it.

An ordinary arrow flew through the air like a cold meteorite after Mu Ningxue let go of the string. It looked spectacular from afar, but it was absolutely terrifying when it came closer!

The arrow struck Nanrong Ni’s stomach and sent her flying toward a cliff that was a part of the broken peak.

Blood sprayed over Nanrong Ni’s body, including her seemingly innocent face.

The arrow stuck in Nanrong Ni’s stomach nailed her to the cliff.

She hung on the cliff like a pinned butterfly, unable to move at all. Huge cracks spread across the cliff behind her like a giant spiderweb.

Nanrong Ni’s face contorted in pain. She eventually let out a loud cry of agony, which echoed across the mountain.

—

Nanrong Ni did not die. Mu Ningxue had simply nailed her to the cliff with an arrow.

The cliff was facing the main buildings. Every member of the Mu Clan in the main buildings could see her. The unnerving sight sent a great chill down their spines!

It was unlikely that anyone in the Mu Clan did not know who Mu Ningxue was by now.

However, most people only remembered her captivating beauty. They had never seen her behaving like this, cruel and merciless as she vented her anger on the woman who had betrayed her.

She was the real goddess of the ice mountain!

Mu Ningxue did not chase after Mu Yinfeng. She knew clearly who Mu Yinfeng was looking for: the man who was responsible for sending her to the abyss!

As for Nanrong Ni, Ningxue could just hang her on the cliff for now.

The brother and sister could come and take her down if they wanted!

The wound on Nanrong Ni’s stomach started freezing, and she had stopped bleeding. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The pain was fading away, but when she noticed the people in the main buildings watching her, the pain in her heart was a hundred times worse than the pain she felt from the wound.

She would rather have been killed by the arrow, instead of being hung on the cliff and humiliated.

No one had dared to call her a traitor in the past, but she could now hear some of the people laughing at her.

Why did Mu Ningxue leave Mu Tingying behind after leaving her with serious injuries, but nailed her to the cliff for everyone to see?

It was the punishment for being a traitor!

—

A Super Mage did not need a lot of time to cross one or two mountains.

Mu Yinfeng did not dare?fight Mu Ningxue and her Ice Crystal Bow alone. She soon returned with her backup.

Mu Feiluan was the overseer of every disciple in the Mu Clan. His face twisted in rage when he saw the person he had chosen as a candidate for the clan meeting nailed to the cliff.

“Mu Ningxue!” Mu Feiluan did not expect Mu Ningxue to go so far!

Mu Yinfeng had also clenched her teeth.

Mu Ningxue was not merely humiliating Nanrong Ni. She was giving both of them a huge slap in the face!

“I was considering sparing your life at first, but after seeing what you have done, I believe even dismembering your corpse isn’t being too harsh on you!” Mu Feiluan snarled.

Mu Ningxue did not come to negotiate with Mu Feiluan.

They had kidnapped her father Mu Zhuoyun brazenly. Mu Ningxue did not even know if her father was still alive.

She was not na?ve enough to assume Mu Feiluan would let Mu Zhuoyun and her go, even if she were to ask humbly.

The two sides were already irreconcilable adversaries. Why would Mu Ningxue show mercy to her enemy?

“Do you seriously think you can challenge the entire Mu Clan because you have control over the Ice Crystal Bow? I, Mu Feiluan, have never been scared of it. A shitty magic bow is nothing compared to my Ice Luan!” Mu Feiluan declared.

Mu Feiluan’s cultivation was even higher than Mu Yinfeng’s. Otherwise, why would he have such great power in the clan, and be trained as a potential candidate to become the next Patriarch?

Most importantly, their Innate Talents of the Ice Luan and the Ice Phoenix were already overwhelming, let alone when the brother and sister joined hands and combined the power of the Ice Luan and the Ice Phoenix!

It was the reason why the Heresy Judgment Court had invited them both to hunt down Qin Yu’er, who was considered a Heretic.

Mu Feiluan was not afraid of the Ice Crystal Bow.

As a matter of fact, Mu Ningxue had helped him by repairing the Ice Crystal Bow.

If he could take away the Ice Crystal Bow and find a suitable successor to inherit it, he would have another reliable subordinate under his command!

“Brother, you have to look out for her Bow. It almost killed me just now. If I didn’t have the Ice Phoenix’s Reincarnation, I would definitely be the person nailed to the cliff right now... Why don’t we ask the elders to take her down, since she has crossed the line first? She won’t be able to escape this time,” Mu Yinfeng advised him.

That arrow had planted great fear in her heart. She was a little afraid now, as her Ice Phoenix’s Reincarnation was no longer available.

“If we involve them, wouldn’t they point at my nose and scold me for being useless in the upcoming meetings?” Mu Feiluan harrumphed coldly.

The Ice Crystal Bow might be powerful, but it was not strong enough to dominate at the Super Level. Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng were almost unbeatable whenever they joined hands.

It was already embarrassing for Mu Feiluan that he had to deal with Mu Ningxue himself!

After thinking about it, Mu Yinfeng realized there was no reason for her to be afraid of the Ice Crystal Bow.

It was just a corrupted piece of magic Equipment that had been abandoned by them. So what if Mu Ningxue was able to control it?

With her brother Mu Feiluan around, her strength would increase significantly. It was unlikely she would be hurt by the Bow again!

In addition, Mu Ningxue had managed to outsmart her in the previous battle. She used the Absolute Ward to force her back so she was not in range to use her Wind Cry.

Her Wind Cry would greatly hinder Mu Ningxue’s control over the Ice Crystal Bow.

The Absolute Ward was obviously still on cooldown. Mu Yinfeng was confident she could prevent Mu Ningxue from firing another arrow with the Bow.

“Let’s stop her together!” Mu Yinfeng declared.

Mu Feiluan nodded. It went without saying that they would be joining hands against Mu Ningxue!

“People always say how shameless the Mu Clan is, but I’ve finally witnessed it with my own eyes!”

The voice arose from close to the main buildings. A confident figure was approaching them.

“A middle-aged man obsessed with cleanliness, with the face of someone suffering from kidney failure, and an ugly woman in the middle of menopause... The scummy brother and sister are picking on a beautiful young woman... Can the Mu Clan be any more shameless?”

The man was wearing a white shirt. It was supposed to be a fashionable shirt, but he looked like a thug because several buttons at the top of it were undone.

Mo Fan did not seem to be bothered about it.

A fight was about to break out. Why wouldn’t he undo some of the buttons?
