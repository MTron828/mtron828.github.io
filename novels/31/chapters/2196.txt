The young man vomited blood. His delicate body could not handle the violence the creature was inflicting on him. Not only was he stuck in the ground, he also felt like his waist and hips were broken.

The other student was dumbfounded too. How was the female barbarian with Boleyn’s voice able to move so quickly? He quickly Cast an Ice Spell to pin down the savage, but she turned her head around and revealed her terrifying fangs.

She jumped down from the first student and went behind the other.

By the time the Ice Lock was flung forward, she was already behind him. He could feel a breeze behind his neck!

Thick arms wrapped around his neck. The savage placed the boy in a headlock and tossed him to the ground.

The boy’s white shirt was covered in blood as he landed. His chin was dislocated, while his teeth and joints were broken.

The savage beat her chest like a boxer who had just knocked out her opponent!

The two students could no longer stand on their feet from the pain they were under were totally dumbfounded. How did a secret date end up like this? What was this monster that was able to talk in Boleyn’s voice?

The savage seemed to like the boy with a long fringe more. She approached him while swinging her solid buttocks with her eyes fixed on him.

For some reason, the boy felt like he was a lady who had been captured by some mountain bandits. He could see a hint of lust from the creature’s eyes, on top of the pure violence!

My gods, don’t tell me she was going to do something crazy with me? I’m supposed to be a real man!

The creature went up to him and stuck its tongue out. The boy was not sure if the creature was going to eat him or do something else. He finally fainted when he saw the creature’s ghastly face!

“You ugly piece of shit, have you asked for my lightning’s permission before messing with my students?” Mo Fan’s voice came from one of the trees.

The creature immediately raised its head. By the time it looked up, a fork of black lightning was coming down at its head.

The creature’s reaction was surprisingly quick. It dodged the lightning so quickly that it left a few afterimages behind.

“Homing Lightning Serpent!”

The lightning did not disappear after landing on the ground. It sprang forward again and bit at the creature like a dozen serpents.

The creature’s eyes widened. It nimbly climbed into the branches of a nearby tree.

Mo Fan had applied the Seal of Order on his Lightning Spell so it could track its target. The lightning serpents promptly went right after the creature after it changed direction. Their bodies were as flexible as real snakes. They could even curl up and around the trees to reach a greater height!

The creature had already climbed to the canopy, and was jumping between the trees. It was so quick that Mo Fan’s lightning was struggling to catch up to it.

Mo Fan did not have time to tag the creature with the Shadow Element, as he was in a rush to save the boys. He would have a hard time chasing the creature if it abused the trees to run away. His Earth Element was only effective against targets on the ground. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The creature was aware of Mo Fan’s strength, and left without any hesitation. Mo Fan did not chase after it, either. He would be in trouble if something else killed the two students while he was chasing the creature.

Mo Fan carried the young men on his shoulders and brought them back to the group. He asked the boy in a white shirt what happened on the way.

“Why did you two leave the group?” Mo Fan asked.

“We heard Boleyn calling for us ahead... sir, Boleyn is in danger! They must have captured her!” the boy exclaimed.

“Boleyn was behind me all the time. She was having a chat with Sharjah,” Mo Fan replied darkly.

“That’s impossible. We clearly heard her voice!” the boy shouted.

“The Mountain Men can mimic human voices and target only certain people with them,” Mo Fan reminded him.

Even Mo Fan had forgotten about the possibility that the Mountain Men had the same ability as the Hillmen. After all, he did not know if the two were of the same species. However, it seemed like the Mountain Men on the Andes Mountains were better at mimicking voices.

A scream suddenly came from the distance. The boy curled up in fear and said, “Sir, is it coming again?”

“I don’t think so. My lightning must have hit it,” Mo Fan said breezily.

“Ah? It’s been quite a while. How could your spell still hit it?” the boy asked in disbelief.

“My spells never miss.”

“Sir, I didn’t think you were so strong. We didn’t stand a chance against it, yet you drove it away so easily. We were too proud of ourselves,” the boy admitted in shame.

If the lecturer had not arrived in time, not only would they be dead by now, they might even have lost their most precious thing as men!

“How could I be your lecturer if I’m not capable? You didn’t pay fifty gold for nothing... oh, speaking of which, remember to come to my classes next week,” Mo Fan told him.

“I’ll be there!” the boy swore.

—

Mo Fan left the boys in Boleyn’s care after regrouping with the others, as Boleyn’s secondary Element was the Healing Element. Her face turned pale when she saw their miserable condition.

“Sir, what happened to them?” she asked.

“They bumped into a Mountain Man. Sharjah, tell the others not to listen to the voices of people they are familiar with. The Mountain Men can mimic our voices and will lure them to a remote spot,” Mo Fan warned them all.

“What about your instructions a moment ago?” Sharjah’s eyes glittered.

Mo Fan was startled. He quickly looked around and realized half of the group was missing!

“Where’s Lecturer Zhao Yanzu? Didn’t I ask him to wait here?” Mo Fan asked.

“Sir, didn’t you tell him to head west? You told him Lecturer Mu Han was in trouble, so you asked him to bring some students along to back Lecturer Mu Han up,” Boleyn said.

“I never said that!. I asked him to stay put and keep an eye on the students!” Mo Fan’s face darkened.

They had really underestimated these Mountain Men. They had spread false information in the group to split them up while he was busy saving the boys.

It seemed like the scream for help was fake, too. He wondered how Miyamoto Shin and the others were doing!
