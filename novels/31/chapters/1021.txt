Fenna took a deep breath. The wind produced by her wings blew at her light green robe and her brown hair. Her glittering eyes looked extremely firm and determined!

“In the name of the commander of Puccini City, I challenge you to a duel of life and death!” Fenna pointed at the Dark Swordmaster and spoke in the ancient Egyptian language.

Her voice echoed in the sky and entered the ears of every soldier. Her fearlessness even when knowing that her death was approaching made the heart of every Mage race with a hint of sorrow!

Not every Mage in the world was willing to face a Ruler-level demon creature, and not everyone was willing to live a selfish life like a coward. When certain things were lost, what left was nothing but an empty shell.

It was the same for Fenna. She had grown up in Puccini City, and was now the highest officer of Puccini City. She did not have any family members, nor children, but to her, Puccini City was her home. Sherlock, who was also a Super Mage, would never understand why she insisted on fighting the battle. If it wasn’t for the kindness of the people in Puccini City, she would have frozen to death on the street decades of years ago...

It was a duel of life and death!

After her high-spirited voice rang out, a strong aura of darkness surged toward the human army!

The Dark Swordmaster stared at Fenna coldly. The disdain in its hollow, eerie eyes was replaced by a cold, stern light.

It slowly raised the giant, black sword in its hand and pointed its tip at the flying Fenna.

A black wind surged into the armor the Dark Swordmaster was wearing and spun like a tornado over a kilometer across. Both the humans and the undead were knocked a few steps back.

The Dark Swordmaster had a metallic voice. It was indeed speaking in human tongue, in the ancient Egyptian language.

It said something, but Mo Fan could not understand it. The dark power that had accumulated started to disperse. The Dark Swordmaster stopped staring at Fenna. It glared at the rest of the Mages and pointed its sword at the people who could not even survive a single attack from it!

“Damn it, I told you it was as ridiculous as a fairy tale!” Sherlock snapped furiously when he saw the Dark Swordmaster did not act according to what Mo Fan had mentioned.

Fenna was stunned too. She looked at the Dark Swordmaster in disbelief.

“Are we all going to die here?”

“It didn’t work, the Dark Contract didn’t work at all!”

“What are we doing here? Why did we bother believing something so ridiculous?”

The people started to panic. The Dark Contract was not established, meaning that the Dark Swordmaster’s sword would still be targeting them!

“What happened? What did it say?” Mo Fan yelled at Fenna in the air.

Mo Fan was very shocked too. He believed that Meng’e had no reason to lie to him. The Dark Contract was definitely real, something must have gone wrong.

“Enough talk about the Dark Contract, we have to engage the enemy now,” Wankos said.

The Dark Swordmaster had raised its giant sword again. The sky had turned darker slightly once again.

Seeing this, everyone’s heart skipped a beat. If the Nyx Regime was constructed, the Brutal Sword Death Servants would simply turn into killing machines!

“Darkness, it only accepts a duel from a darkness being! I’m not a darkness being, so I didn’t have the right to challenge it to a duel,” Fenna landed in a dispirited manner. Her eyes were filled with tears.

The tears ran down her cheeks. It was a devastating blow to her, as there was nothing she could do even when she was willing to face death!

“How about Sherlock? Is he a darkness being?” Old Mage Mudin asked.

“He isn’t, even if he is, there’s no way he’s going to do it,” Wankos said.

“What’s a darkness being?”

“Can I go? My secondary Element is Shadow...”

“What’s the point of you going? The Dark Swordmaster can simply kill you with a single slash. You’re only going to get yourself killed.”

The situation was even more worrying. At this rate, they could only sacrifice their lives to clear a path to the mirage, yet would they really consider it a victory?

Ai Jiangtu, Nanyu, and the others fell silent. The plan they came up with was no longer an option. No one could possibly reach the pyramid with the Nyx Regime in place. It was the Dark Swordmaster’s Domain. Even if they tried to force their way to the pyramid, they would only find themselves further away due to the complicated maze of darkness!

“I’ll try,” a voice said. It sounded serious.

Xinxia turned around and looked at Mo Fan. She was hoping that it did not come from him.

However, Mo Fan took a step forward and said, “I should fit the requirement. I’ll challenge it to a duel; I’ll leave the mission of destroying the mirage to the rest of you.”

Mu Ningxue pulled Mo Fan aside and shook her head.

“Hehe, someone is trying to be a hero,” Guan Yu mocked.

“I definitely agree with that,” Zu Jiming grinned.

Considering how strong the Dark Swordmaster was, it would only take... perhaps no more than one or two slashes to kill Mo Fan, but it needed less than five slashes without a doubt to cut him into pieces. Even the weakest Ruler-level creature was able to kill an Advanced Mage with ease!

Xinxia looked at Mo Fan. She was struggling to read Mo Fan’s mind. Why would he even dare to take the risk?

“Don’t worry, I won’t die,” Mo Fan knew what Xinxia was worried about. He patted her on her head.

“I don’t agree, just give it up. I’ll freeze it and temporarily disable its Nyx Regime, and everyone will try their best to get closer to the pyramid,” Mu Ningxue said.

There was no way Mu Ningxue would let Mo Fan go and get himself killed. Every war was cruel, and there would always be sacrifices, but it was not their war, so it was unnecessary to sacrifice their lives for it. Even if the city was razed to the ground in the end, they had already tried their best.

“Just trust me.” Mo Fan did not explain further.

A darkness being! Mo Fan never thought it would come to that, that only a darkness being could challenge a darkness being to a duel of darkness.

He had considered every possibility, yet he did not expect the great responsibility would fall upon on his shoulders again. However, when Mo Fan thought about the consequences of losing the war, he suddenly felt like it was worth it, even if he was forced to use his trump card!

“Damn it, why do I feel like I’m actually turning into a savior of the world?” Mo Fan walked out from the crowd and faced the imperious Dark Swordmaster.

If a little servant of a Pharaoh was this powerful, how terrifying would a Pharaoh be?

“You, the one with the sword, come fight your grandpa Mo Fan!” Mo Fan pointed at the Dark Swordmaster and demanded in Chinese.

The Dark Contract was not established through a certain language, but a person’s will. As long as Mo Fan was a darkness being, he only needed to say something disrespectful about the God of Darkness or the Dark Swordmaster to challenge it to a duel!

“Imbecile, I will sever your petty head and hang it outside the pyramid!” The Dark Swordmaster withdrew the Nyx Regime and pointed its sword at Mo Fan.

The giant sword was twice the size of Mo Fan. Its huge body was intimidating to look at. The giant sword trembled as some dark energy started pouring out of it.

The powerful dark energy forced the nearby undead and humans to back away.

The Dark Contract formed a huge triangle on the bloody, corpse-covered land. It first drew the boundaries on the ground before extending into the air to form a triangular prism!

“This...this is...” Sherlock’s eyes widened. His gaze was fixed on the dark dueling ground constructed by the dark energy!

Dark Contract...

It was the ancient Dark Contract only mentioned in old records from ancient Egypt, but no one had actually seen one before. How had a young Mage from the east known that a Dark Contract would work on the Dark Swordmaster?

The dark dueling ground was constructed between the human army and the army of undead. The black walls of light rising into the sky were covered in ancient curses with extremely powerful energy...

“My God, it really appeared, a Dark Contract!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

“How did Mo Fan even know something like that... go see if you can break down the barriers. Otherwise, Mo Fan really has to fight the creature until one of them dies!” Jiang Shaoxu yelled as she recalled something.

Ai Jiangtu immediately tried to attack the walls of the prism, but it felt like the walls were able to absorb the energy of the spells aimed at it. It felt like the walls had grown even sturdier!

Fenna tried to use the Slaughtering Wind Slash on the walls, but the result was still the same. The walls of the dueling ground were covered in even more black runes, trapping both Mo Fan and the Dark Swordmaster within...

“What do we do now? Isn’t Mo Fan dead for sure?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Why is he always so reckless?”

—

Inside the dueling ground, Mo Fan stood on the blood-stained soil. He immediately had a bad feeling when he sensed the strong energy of the Dark Contract around him.

The Dark Contract was even more shocking than Mo Fan had imagined. It was able to construct a spectacular dark dueling ground out of nowhere. Mo Fan was only planning to try activating the Dark Contract, but he realized he could no longer run away!

“Damn it, what the heck are you guys waiting for?! Can you please make your way to the pyramid at once!” Mo Fan yelled when he saw the people outside the barrier staring at him with blank faces.

After Mo Fan finished yelling, he sensed a formidable murderous aura coming at him. He lifted his gaze and saw a giant sword surrounded by an icy light and runes of death about to come down at him at any second!

Mo Fan tried to dodge it, yet he realized he could not move his body!

He was locked down, the sword had locked him down!
