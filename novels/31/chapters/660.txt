“Chief, could this be the Endless Corridor?” said Su Xiaoluo.

Fang Gu nodded. He glanced to the back and said, “Look, we aren’t far from the entrance, either.”

Everyone turned around. As Fang Gu had mentioned, the distance from the entrance was nowhere close to the distance they could cover after walking for over ten minutes.

“If the teachings are accurate, the key to overcoming this place is hidden inside these carvings. If I remember it correctly, it should be this one here,” Su Xiaoluo suddenly walked up to a carving and focused her gaze on a pattern resembling a woman from the ancient era.

She reached out her hand and touched the marks and the woman on the carving softly...

Slowly, Su Xiaoluo’s eyes began to show different kinds of emotion, as if her soul was hooked into the artwork.

“Did she go into the illusion?” Mo Fan glanced at Su Xiaoluo in surprise.

Su Xiaoluo’s expression changed continuously. She would look furious or sad at times. Even though it was changing rapidly, every expression seemed to be real.

“She is interpreting the illusion. This corridor must be a combination of the Psychic and Space Elements. If we can’t find the key to the illusions inside the artworks, we will be trapped here forever...” explained Fang Gu.

Su Xiaoluo stood in her spot. The pace of her expression changing increased. Sometime later, a wisp of light appeared ahead of the corridor. They could now see the end of the corridor, just less than a hundred meters ahead!

Su Xiaoluo’s eyes returned to normal, although her thoughts were still lost as she was recovering from the illusions.

“Are you alright?” asked Zhang Xiaohou.

Su Xiaoluo shook her head and replied, “It turns out that the people from the villages are the only ones allowed to enter. Anyone else would easily be trapped in the illusions, leading to their deaths.”

The group found themselves in a spacious hall after reaching the end of the corridor. The place was constructed with white jade. The ground was so smooth that they could see their reflections...

Pillars stood firmly around the place, each one so thick that it would need four or five people to surround it. Their surfaces were full of runes that Mo Fan could not understand.

The hall seemed rather empty. The only sound was the footsteps echoing in the spacious hall.

The group proceeded forward. Mo Fan suddenly felt the Little Loach Pendant vibrating on his neck.

He was surprised. Since the Little Loach Pendant had eaten the Underground Holy Spring, it had never shown any interest in other sources of energy. Mo Fan almost forgot that the pendant was the kind of Magic Tool that was able to evolve further.

Little Loach had finally burst out crying in excitement after so many years. It was trying to tell Mo Fan through its intense vibration that it had found some delicacy nearby!

Mo Fan looked in the direction that the Little Loach Pendant was urging to go and discovered a stone table at the center of the hall, with a crystal-like lotus on it. He sniffed an alluring scent as he approached the table.

“Over here, do you remember seeing this in the drawing at the bottom of the well?” Mo Fan called the others over.

The hall was completely sealed off. There was no other path further into the tomb. Apart from the rather suspicious runes on the pillars, the strange lotus on the table was the only thing that stood out.

“I... guess so...” said Su Xiaoluo with a lack of confidence.

Meanwhile, Fang Gu was staring right at the lotus. He finally spoke when he saw the others looking at him, “I’m afraid we won’t be able to go any deeper. I think this lotus is called the Eternal Lotus. The teachings mentioned that the bridge to the altar will only appear after the Eternal Lotus dies.”

“Eternal Lotus, does something like that exist in this world? When the lotus dies, wouldn’t it die if I tear it into pieces?” said Zhang Xiaohou.

“You can try,” said Fang Gu.

Zhang Xiaohou was relatively straightforward. He simply tore the strange lotus that had a mix of pink and green into pieces in just a few seconds. The petals scattered messily across the ground.

Zhang Xiaohou even stepped on the petals a few times just to make sure it was dead, “See, mission accomplish...”

Before Zhang Xiaohou could finish his sentence, the broken pieces slowly floated up and flew back to the table.

The pieces attached to one another on their own. Even the dust on the petals after Zhang Xiaohou stepped on them was shaken off in the process.

In just a few seconds, the strange lotus reclaimed its old appearance. Not a single crack could be found on the petals. It looked exactly the same as before.

“This...” Zhang Xiaohou was stunned. He immediately repeated his action.

He was even rougher this time, shredding the flower into tiny pieces. He almost chucked the petals into his mouth and chew them.

However, as everyone expected, the strange lotus restored itself once again.

“Back off...Wind Disc: Sky Snare!”

Zhang Xiaohou proceeded to cast the Wind Spell. The strong gust shredded the lotus into dust.

However, even as the wind dissipated, the dust gathered back on the table and combined into the same innocent-looking lotus, leaving Zhang Xiaohou bewildered.

“What shall we do now? We don’t have much time to waste here?” Su Xiaoluo started to panic. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Millions of people were waiting to be saved. If they did not reach the Ancient King in time, it would be all over when the Dark Abyss shifted to its next location.

They had easily overcome the troubles along the journey, yet they had stumbled into the Eternal Lotus that they could not kill, burn or eat...

“It’s no use, it will still recover even if you blast it with a Super Spell,” said Fang Gu.

“We’ve already come so far, is this going to be the end?” Zhang Xiaohou was not satisfied with the outcome. He went up to tear and trample the lotus again.

At the clock tower, a copper mirror with the size of a palm was placed on an old table. A group of people surrounded the table, staring into the image inside the copper mirror.

“It’s really them!” Han Ji looked worn out, yet it did not stop him from being overjoyed.

They initially thought there was nothing they could do apart from waiting after Mo Fan and his crew jumped into the Dark Abyss. To their surprise, the chief of Hua Village, Xie Sang came, and offered them the copper mirror. It was showing them the scene of Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, Su Xiaoluo, Fang Gu and Liu Ru surrounding the strange lotus with troubled expressions.

“What plant is that exactly? Why can’t they destroy it?” blurted out Yao Nan.

“It’s most likely the Eternal Lotus that has been extinct for thousands of years. It was described as a sacred object that even Super Spells are unable to destroy. There were Forbidden Magicians that managed to destroy it in the past... but it took them a great effort.” The knowledgeable Han Ji identified the flower before Xie Sang had the chance to speak.

“For...Forbidden Magicians? None of them has even reached the Advanced Level, how could they possibly unleash a power of that level!?”
