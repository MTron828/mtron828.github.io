The North Country Club...

The club’s cellar had rows of wine racks, but most of them were empty. Some with seemingly expensive wines were well taken care of, without a single trace of dust.

The cellar was neat and tidy, and very quiet too, totally isolated from the noise of the bar.

Something was ticking rhythmically in the dark.

A round table was placed in the center of the wine cellar. Half of the table was hollow, and a slim-figured girl was strapped on it, as if she were in the midst of an ancient, feudal ritual...

There was a cut on her wrist, and the ticking sound was from the blood dripping down from her veins.

The blood was dripping to the ground, into a strange diagram, forming a cycle in the carved notches.

As the amount of blood increased, the evil presence from the eerie diagram grew stronger. It crazily penetrated Liu Ru’s body and modified her body composition. Her mouth was slightly opened as she was suffering from the pain, and it was clear that her canine teeth were growing longer.

When a human was losing blood at a slow rate, they would be in danger after losing more than forty percent of their blood. Liu Ru could not tell how much blood she had lost, but she was clearly aware that each drop of blood into the eerie diagram below would turn into a strange gaseous substance before returning to her body.

Maybe her blood had deteriorated; either way, the pain was unbearable, like she was immersed in acid.

The surroundings were in complete darkness. The only sounds left were the ticking of the blood and her panting. Time felt incredibly long, and she felt like a hopeless person abandoned in a dark corner waiting for her death.

Kata, kata, kata...

The footsteps were crisp and clear as they echoed in the wine cellar.

Liu Ru slightly regained her consciousness, with a hint of disgust rising in her heart!

She knew who the person was; it must be the vampire, Nie Dong!

He was planning to turn her into his own kind, to let her know that the vampires had a longer lifespan than humans. Most importantly, they could keep their youthful looks forever.

If she ended up turning into something like that, she would not want to live a second longer!

“Liu Ru?” The rather familiar voice of a man appeared.

Liu Ru was startled, and her heart filled with joy.

“I...I’m here, Mo Fan, is that you?” Liu Ru asked weakly.

“It’s me, it’s me!” Mo Fan hurried over to Liu Ru.

When he saw Liu Ru was bleeding, he quickly untied her and treated her wounds.

Luckily, he had brought some blood serums along to replenish her blood. He let out a relieved sigh when he saw Liu Ru’s pale face gradually returning to normal.

Lingling had cleverly suggested he should search the club rather than trying to take the vampire Nie Dong down at the police station.

As they thought, Liu Ru was imprisoned here. Mo Fan had awakened the Shadow Element, so he was fairly sensitive toward places with a strong presence of black magic. He snuck his way into here after discovering that the club had a wine cellar under it!

Either way, he had managed to find Liu Ru. He would be wallowing in deep self-reproof if she were killed by the vampire...

“I’ll bring you out of here first. That vampire should be on his way back...” Mo Fan carried the weak girl in his arms.

Liu Ru had been brought here after she was kidnapped by Nie Dong. Fortunately, the ritual could only infect and modify someone’s blood one drop at a time, which gave Mo Fan and Lingling enough time to save her.

“Thank...thank you, Mo Fan,” Liu Ru sounded like she was almost in tears. The strong girl had finally revealed her weak side. She dug her head into the shoulder of the man whom she had only known since half a month ago.

“I’m a Hunter, it’s my responsibility to save you,” Mo Fan replied sincerely.

Mo Fan was extremely cautious as he walked toward the exit. According to how Lingling had described the place, it seemed to be where the vampires of the same family interacted with one another. As such, there was a chance that other vampires would be around. If he happened to stumble into any of them, it would be troublesome for him to leave the place.

Liu Ru was still sobbing, yet her tears were not flowing out for some reason.

She tightly held onto Mo Fan, who was clearly enjoying the hug. Her cold body subconsciously pulled herself closer when she detected Mo Fan’s fiery, masculine aura.

She did not dare to be too close to Mo Fan, as she was afraid of disturbing his life. After all, he was only protecting her out of kindness, but when a man was willing to help a girl when she was feeling extremely helpless, just a little kind act would be seen as a blessing.

When the man was carrying her, it was the most peaceful time she had for the past few months ever since the vampire had intruded her life, even though it was a bit too much to ask, and the duration was too short...

For some reason, Liu Ru felt an urge to kiss Mo Fan.

Her body felt cold, down to the bones, and she could clearly feel Mo Fan’s body heat, especially from his shoulders, neck, and face that were the closest to her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even though she felt worn out, she secretly moved closer, and her initial thought was only to stick her mouth closer so she could give him a kiss...

However, when she inhaled a strong scent similar to that of deadly poison from Mo Fan’s neck, a strong desire electrocuted her body all of a sudden.

Not only did she want Mo Fan to hug her tightly, to give her a crazy kiss, she wanted to have more intimate interactions, and drink his boiling, masculine blood...

——

A pair of soft lips were pressed onto Mo Fan’s neck.

Mo Fan, who was making his way out of the club, shuddered as he felt something poking into the veins in his neck.

Mo Fan subconsciously set himself aflame, to burn the thing that was harming him into ashes. However, when he turned and saw Liu Ru’s attractive face, the Rose Flame which had already climbed to his waist halted suddenly.

Mo Fan stared at Liu Ru, briefly at a loss for words.

He could feel the blood being drawn out from his body, yet when he sensed that Liu Ru was recovering by using his blood, the flames burning on his body slowly dissipated.

A multitude of feelings surged up in his heart, including self-reproof, pity, and anger...

Either way, he could not make the decision to burn this girl, who he had no idea what she had turned into, into ashes...
