Chapter 3164 ¬†Be Friends

Once again, those branches that "talked" and had "expressions" crowded before Mo Fan.

At this moment, he activated his divine vision and turned his pupils golden.

His field of vision expanded. He could then see the truth of things before him and survey the entire area from above.

Something like a large and wild forest covered the zone.

However, as Mo Fan's vision widened, he realized this thing actually resembled a brain.

The lake, where he stood, and the tall, sinister trees formed the valleys and ridges. It turned out that the active plants he saw were the brain's nerve fibers!

They could laugh, question, mock, and play tricks.

Suddenly, Mo Fan understood why the Divine Wood Well seemed so eerie and strange. He had been looking at nerves with thoughts!

Yes. Those ancient towering trees were like the frontal lobes of this wild brain; countless nerves connected them. If one was small enough, standing among them would feel like being in an incredible "divine forest."

The Divine Wood Well was a divine brain!

After the mist cleared, Mo Fan stood on the lake and beheld the colossal, mountainous living entity before him. It extended endlessly and exuded a majestic as well as profoundly sacred presence. From where he stood, he could not see its full form, but his divine vision allowed him to see its complete outline!

Right then, Mo Fan realized why its aura reminded him of the town he once stumbled into.

It was indeed not a divine eye. Imagine plunging into such a colossal, otherworldly brain. It felt like entering a mesmerizing enchanted forest.

The intricate nerves intertwined into a vast network of ancient divine trees. Whenever Mo Fan approached them, they would spark bizarre and fantastical misconceptions.

Mo Fan had encountered ancient gods before, but facing this incredibly odd and surreal divine entity left him deeply conflicted.

Honestly, he would rather not learn of its true form.

What would that make him, the one who had fallen into this brain?

A brain parasite?

Deep down, it was hard for anyone to accept their own insignificance.

"So, you can project my true thoughts. You're a divine brain that can somehow influence other people's thoughts? Mo Fan asked as he gazed at the immense brain before him.

"I've merely looked into your mind. What I see and hear stems from your genuine inner voice," the voice that sounded like Zhan Kong overlapped with many voices Mo Fan recognized.

"Who buried you in this desolate desert?" Mo Fan asked.

"Who?" The divine brain chuckled disdainfully. "No one. It's warm here, and I don't really need water."

"I've used your eyes, the Eye of Spacetime," Mo Fan said.

"We aren't the same and aren't that close," the divine brain replied.

"But both of you originated from an ancient divine body, didn't you?" Mo Fan asked.

"If you put it that way, humans and kelp share a common lineage too," the divine brain replied.

Mo Fan managed a smile.

He had a feeling that it was offended, but he could not find proof.

"So, how should I interpret your existence?" Mo Fan asked.

"It's quite simple. In your mythology, isn't there a figure called Kuafu? He chased the sun until he exhausted himself. His blood became rivers, bones turned into mountains, skin became land, and hair follicles grew into forests. So, what about his eyes and brain?" "You're that old?" Mo Fan asked in surprise.

This brought him back to the origins of humans. What was the origin of humans in the magical world like? No one knew. Even magical history books had no records.

"Have you ever thought that mythology comes from people's real experiences? In ancient times, people couldn't explain what they saw, so they used myths to think, interpret, and metaphorize. Perhaps someone saw me at some point, and that's how mythology came to be," the divine brain explained.

"Alright. You are impressive, worthy of respect, and something to worship. I believe you mean me no harm," Mo Fan said.

"What is harm, and what is goodwill?" the divine brain asked. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

"You follow your nature‚Ä¶ Um, does that mean there's a divine heart buried somewhere in this world?" Mo Fan suddenly pondered.

The divine brain fell silent all of a sudden.

Mo Fan sensed that he was right.

The world's divine eye, brain, and heart‚Ä¶

The power held by the world's divine eye surpassed the Forbidden Curse and exceeded the limits of human magic.

"I have a question. Since you're a brain, can you talk to the Eyes of Tide as well as the Eye of the Ocean and convince them not to follow the Cold Moon Evil Eye? They're supporting tyranny and causing great harm to my country," Mo Fan said.

"What is goodwill, and what is harm?" the divine brain asked again.

"Um‚Ä¶" Mo Fan scratched his head.

It seemed the divine brain was not inclined to take sides easily.

To it, humans and kelp were no different.

"The world doesn't revolve around our existence or stop with our demise. Only humans seek a greater purpose. The sun and moon remain indifferent to past and present," the divine brain stated.

It was impressive and aloof.

Mo Fan was left speechless.

However, he also understood that, similar to the six divine eyes, the divine brain was eternal. They existed as long as the magical world existed.

Perhaps he could tap into their power, but truly controlling them was impossible.

"Let's do this. We can be friends. If you need anything, tell me," Mo Fan changed his approach. He decided not to discuss abstract matters with the divine brain anymore.

Without waiting for the divine brain's response, Mo Fan took out the Sacred Spring from his Space Bracelet. He had obtained it from deep within the Sahara. "You might not need water, but this Sacred Spring should be a good gift. Let me offer it to you as a gift for our meeting," he continued.

The divine brain clearly did not understand human behavior.

However, that did not stop Mo Fan.

As the refreshing Sacred Spring poured onto the massive brain, its neural branches stretched out and began to sway, almost like ancient people dancing.

A sense of joy filled the air, accompanied by gentle "laughter" as the branches touched each other. It was not the eerie mockery from before but rather a pleasant hum that resembled beautiful singing.

"How was that?" Mo Fan asked.

"Very comfortable."

"You know, human happiness is pretty simple. Just being with people you like and chatting with good friends make us happy. It's like when cool water refreshes dry roots," Mo Fan explained.

"Okay," said the divine brain.

"What do you mean by 'okay'?" Mo Fan asked.

"You asked if we could be friends earlier. My answer is yes. Your gift has pleased me," the divine brain replied.

"Haha. You haven't tried our liquor yet. I'll treat you to some later. It'll make you feel like you're the hottest thing around." Mo Fan chuckled.

"This is for you," the divine brain said.

A spore that resembled a sapodilla slowly emerged from the water and floated gently toward Mo Fan.

Mo Fan took it and observed the unique spore.

People often joked about scratching their heads when they were thinking hard. Could this spore actually grow into a brain if planted in the right place?

Honestly, the idea of growing a brain from soil sounded pretty far-fetched.

Mo Fan did not know what it was for, but he did not feel comfortable asking.

After all, the divine brain seemed more mysterious to Mo Fan than the Eye of Spacetime.

The Eye of Spacetime did not talk or have strange thoughts. Mo Fan borrowed its power, it agreed, and the deal was done.

In contrast, the divine brain clearly had complex thoughts. If Mo Fan managed to upset it, dealing with the consequences would be tough. After all, those sandstorm spirits that chased Mo Fan before had ended up as fertilizer for its branches.

"Um, I have other stuff to do. Can I come back and hang out with you later?" Mo Fan decided to leave. He did not expect to figure out something as complex as a massive brain.

Truth be told, Mo Fan often did not understand what was going on in his own head, which housed a smaller brain.

"Sure," the divine brain agreed.

Mo Fan breathed a sigh of relief.

It was good that the divine brain was okay with him leaving. He started to walk away, and the surrounding "happy" plants scattered.

Mo Fan then began flying toward the sky covered by the plants.

The tall trees that blocked the sun moved aside and formed a magical well. Above the well was a desert sun, and below it was the massive divine brain.

Mo Fan slowly distanced himself from the Divine Wood Well, but he could not help looking back.

For some reason, Mo Fan felt like another version of himself was living below.

Talking with the divine brain felt like standing before a magic mirror and talking to himself from different times. It was like the young and old selves talking to each other.

So, was the divine brain really its true form?

Or was it just showing a form that Mo Fan could accept?

"This world has all kinds of crazy things."

Mo Fan realized that no matter what level he reached, there would always be many unknowns in this world. They were like stars and moons‚Äîalways there, whether human magic civilization was fading or shining brightly. They could be seen and felt but never truly owned.
