Why would Mo Fan be scared of the Egyptian team now that he had learned their secret?

The Sky Lightning Claw shredded the undead in no time. Even though the spell needed more energy to cast, it was nothing compared to the value of the Pharaoh Spring!

The team worked together and eliminated at least two-thirds of the undead.

Little Loach was enjoying a great feast. It had been a long time since Mo Fan last saw the little amulet feeling such joy. The glow it was emitting was extremely soothing, and felt like it would significantly speed up his cultivation!

Mo Fan’s cultivating speed had slowed down after he reached the Advanced Level. Also, he had six Elements to look after. He would definitely struggle to keep all six of his Elements at the same level.

However, if the Little Loach Pendant was able to evolve, it would help his other Elements catch up to the level of everyone else’s primary Element!

If all of his Elements were at the same level as his opponent’s primary Element, he would surely be unstoppable!

“We can’t let him kill them all, we’ll have to use the remaining Pharaoh Spring to Summon a Giant Tactile Centipede Demon!” Meos said.

“But if he manages to kill the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon too, it means we’ll be giving the Pharaoh Spring away!” Sayed protested.

“He already took half of it, it’s basically the same as taking it all. We have to take the risk!” Neferu agreed with Meos’s suggestion.

If they fought with all they had, they might have a chance of taking the Pharaoh Spring back and win the match. If they were to give up now, they would simply lose everything!

“Alright, let’s summon it together!”

The members of the Egyptian team made up their minds. They had decided to use all they had to take on Mo Fan, the demon king.

The Egyptian team had easily defeated England and Greece with their undead strategy, but it was somehow useless against Mo Fan, and to make things worse, they were about to lose the Pharaoh Spring!

The five members uttered the chants of the Undead Element. Gray Star Constellations slowly circled them and combined into a huge Star Constellation of the Undead Element.

The Undead Star Constellation was not made up of brilliant Stars. It looked more like the silhouette of a statue drawn with strange Curses, and a strong evil presence.

The five Star Constellations were almost as huge as a Star Palace, the display was utterly shocking!

The black gate to the underworld opened before them. The gate was huge. The five members were tiny, like mere ants.

A roar rose from deep within the underworld. The color of the sky and clouds changed. The calm surface of the sea was suddenly churning with fierce, rolling waves, splashing heavily onto the island and the ships around it.

The ships swayed wildly. The hearts of the people on them were pounding heavily. What kind of monster was this, with such a strong evil presence before it even showed itself!

“Giant Tactile Centipede Demon! Fight for the Pharaoh Spring, and eliminate these imbeciles!” the five members of the Egyptian team yelled at the top of their lungs as they continued to Summon the terrifying monster from the underworld.

Another roar came, and the island shook as if it was about to sink into the ocean. A giant skeleton climbed out from the gate of the underworld.

Its brains were hanging out like coconuts on a coconut tree, quite eerie to look at. Its body was incredibly long. Its head was rising far above the island, yet more than half of its body was still inside the gate!

“Holy crap, how long is that creature?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon finally revealed its true appearance. The enormous skeleton resembled a centipede stretching for the clouds. It was impossible to see the entire creature when it raised its head!

“This creature seems a lot stronger than the one before. I can’t help but wonder if it only looks strong from its appearance, like the one before!” Mo Fan’s neck felt sore after staring up for too long.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s size was quite shocking. The island was like a little mud pool to it. It could not even turn around on it!

Its eyes were ghastly and glittering, and people did not dare to look right into them. Even though the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon was like a centipede compared to the Black Totem Snake, it was still quite deadly for a Commander-level creature!

The Egyptian team was going all out this time. They had used all their remaining energy from the Pharaoh Spring to Summon the creature from the underworld!

“I will forfeit the match if I were you! We can’t really control the Tactile Centipede Demon. It’s unwise to lose your lives over a match!” Neferu warned Mo Fan and the others with a cold grin.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon was significantly stronger than the Tactile Centipede Demon. Its evil presence was so strong that the Egyptian team was unable to assert full control over it.

“And give us back the Pharaoh Spring, you shameless prick!” Neferu swore, pointing at Mo Fan.

“So that thing is called the Pharaoh Spring... hang on, you dare call me shameless? Let’s give the Pharaoh Spring to the organizer and see if it’s legal for the tournament! You are being shameless first, and now you’re stopping me from revealing the truth? Don’t place your hopes on this creature!. It might look intimidating, but just like the Tactile Centipede Demon from before, it isn’t going to make any difference!” Mo Fan retorted scathingly.

“You asked for it yourself, we already warned you about it!” Neferu said.

“I’ll be taking all your Pharaoh Spring. I believe this creature still has quite some left in it!” Mo Fan laughed.

“Die!” Neferu was enraged. He immediately ordered the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon to attack Mo Fan! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan currently had half of the Pharaoh Spring. They had to take it back at all costs! Otherwise, they would still suffer a great loss, even if they ended up winning the match!

Unfortunately, even Mo Fan would have trouble getting back something that Little Loach had swallowed!

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon rolled and swung its tail down with incredible might.

Mo Fan and the others quickly dodged aside. The impact formed a huge ravine across the center of the island, splitting it in half!

“Flying Creek Snow Wolf, your turn!”

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled and swiftly pounced at the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon. He sprinted across the creature’s lengthy body. He was going for the brains that hanging on its head!

Surprisingly, the brains were not just decorations. They suddenly opened like mouths and unleashed strong blasts of wind. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf managed to dodge a few of them, yet he was still hit in the end. He fell to the ground, landing not far away from Mo Fan.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf did not dare make a noise, knowing that he had failed.

Mo Fan glared at the wolf and said, “How useless are you just because Mu Ningxue isn’t around?”

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf felt extremely wronged. The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon was indeed a few levels stronger than him. It was reasonable if he lost against it. However, he believed he could take the undead on if his Ice Soul was active!

“I’ll spread the ice,” Mu Nujiao said.

Mu Nujiao knew Mo Fan’s wolf needed ice to fight better. Her ice was not as strong as Mu Ningxue’s, but it would still help the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

“Mmm!” Mo Fan nodded.

“Awooo!” The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was motivated once again after hearing the plan, as if he was invincible when fighting around ice.

However, Mo Fan knew the Flying Creek Snow Wolf would still struggle against the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon, even if his Ice Soul was triggered. He glanced toward Jiang Yu and said, “Jiang Yu, ask your little cat to locate the undead’s weakness. It’s impossible to destroy the whole thing. We’ll need to find where its undead crystal is. It doesn’t matter how many times we kill it if we don’t break its undead crystal.”

“Alright, leave it to my Night Rakshasa...” Jiang Yu nodded.

“Old Zhao, hold the creature off for now. Let’s not attack it for now, so we can learn its moves,” Mo Fan said to Zhao Manyan.

“Not a problem, my defense is as hard as always!” Zhao Manyan kept casting defensive spells. The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon attacked several times, yet it felt like it had just rammed into a solid rock.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon spat out a poisonous, black liquid at Zhao Manyan’s defense after several failed attempts. The Poison Element was fairly corrosive against Elemental Defense, and Zhao Manyan’s layers of defense soon collapsed!

“This creature has the Poison Element!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

“We aren’t blind!”

“Holy crap, run!” Zhao Manyan was the first to flee, knowing that his defense was useless.

Mo Fan raised his head and saw the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon slamming down at him. He quickly grabbed Mu Nujiao around her waist and escaped with Fleeing Shadow.

Another huge ravine was left on the island. Seawater started pouring in through the crack and spread across the island.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon opened its mouth and fired a black beam from its throat.

The black beam went from one end of the island to the other, chasing after Mo Fan relentlessly. The creature clearly held a great grudge against Mo Fan!

“He’s chasing you! Let go of me, I can defend myself,” Mu Nujiao blushed. Somehow, she felt like Mo Fan was only taking advantage of her.

“I was just being extremely cautious. This centipede is going to be tricky to deal with.” Mo Fan let her go, only a little unwillingly.

Mu Nujiao’s secondary Element was Wind. She was clearly more agile than Mo Fan. She summoned a white wind and drifted off into the distance. The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon totally ignored her. It plunged its legs in Mo Fan’s direction like sharp spears!

“Little Flame Belle!”

Little Flame Belle slammed into Mo Fan’s body. The whole place was immediately set aflame, with Mo Fan standing in the middle of it. He glared at the monstrous Giant Tactile Centipede Demon!

“Meteorite Fist!” Feathers were set aflame, propelling Mo Fan toward the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon like a rocket. He slammed his fist into the stomach of the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon. His fist exploded as soon as it contacted the creature’s body, sending huge flames into the air!

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon shuddered backward slightly, but it seemed perfectly fine. It immediately leaned forward to swallow Mo Fan with a single bite!

“Fire Phoenix!” The fiery feathers scattered in the air, and quickly turned into a fiery phoenix, plunging into the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s throat.
