Chapter 2745: I’ve Besieged Licheng Afterglow Island

“Space element, Lightning element. He once mentioned that the Summoning Element wasn’t his strongest power yet. But the hunter;s information from the hall has stated that he was still a Super Level novice! How could this be….” Du Mei stared at Mo Fan in awe and fear as he disappeared into the grove again.

Right then, Shu Xiaohua and Ruan Feiyan awoke from their state, and they saw Mo Fan walking towards the mountain villa.

The Licheng Afterglow Island Mountain villa was situated at the highest point of the island. Seven grannies and two grandpas lived in the villa. The nine of them were powerful elders from the hidden clan. Each of them was of unfathomable strength.

Their biggest advantage compared to the younger generation was they had absorbed the holy spring essence for at least one or two decades. The people on the island could focus their cultivation without worrying about being disturbed. If they trained their talented young people in this way, they could nurture forbidden mages!

There were lychee trees in front of the mountain villa. The yellow lychee gave out a rich fragrance, adding a tinge of gracefulness and beauty to the light-peach colored mountain villa.

“Someone down the hill has applied a Lightning element magical power. Could that bitch have returned?! Hmph! How dare she come back to cause a fuss?! We’ve gone through great lengths to nurture her to become the greatest mage in Licheng Afterglow Island. We expected her to become a forbidden mage soon and lead us to redeem hidden clan’s glory once again. She betrayed us! Damn that girl!Did she truly think that she is invincible?! We will show her mercy no more. We will kill her and offer her as a tribute to our ancestors!” The woman, dressed all in dark green, shouted furiously.

“We should not have told Song Feiyao about the Green East Sea God,” said a short-sleeved old man smoking a cigarette.

“Who told her? Damn it! If only she focused her cultivation in the sacred pool, a talented lady like her would have become a forbidden mage soon. How can she wipe away our years of effort in nurturing her because of something that was long forgotten? Are we going to stay here for generations and allow the outsiders to mistreat us?!” said the woman, in dark green, angrily.

The elders of Licheng Afterglow Island had placed such high hopes on Song Feiyao. Even though Le Nan was talented and worked very hard just like Song Feiyao, Le Nan was too young. She would have to train for at least seven or eight years before she could become an expert and take on the responsibility on her own.

Ocean Demons and other demons had already laid their eyes on the people of Licheng Afterglow Island like hungry wolves. Even the ancient statues would not ensure the island’s complete safety. At the end of the day, the island’s fate would still depend on the experts. Having a forbidden mage and not having one made a significant difference!

“Granny! Granny! Something bad happened!” Le Nan rushed over to them anxiously.

“Why are you so panicked? Nothing can be worse than the b*tchy Song Feiyao coming home! Did she seriously think that she has the right to go against us after training for only two years outside?! She’s all by herself now!” Seventh Granny said

“It’s not her, it’s an outsider. I don’t know how he discovered Licheng Afterglow Island. He’s holding Shu Xiaohua and Ruan Feiyan hostage to settle an account with us!” Le Nan said.

......

“Hmph! Nonsense! We’ve never done anything to him. How dare he come to make a fuss on this island?! Does he really think he can simply invade our island?!” Seventh Granny stormed.

“Is he alone or are there other outsiders with him?” asked the old man with cigarettes.

“He came alone!”

“There’s nothing to fear, then.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Seventh Granny walked outside. When she reached the lychee orchard, she saw Mo Fan standing on the long cobblestone path. A group of young people besieged him, but none of them dared to lay their hands on him.

“You’re the first in decades to come to the island to ask for trouble! I hope you have other requests other than asking for a death wish!” said Seventh Granny, pointing at Mo Fan.

“I’m not really in a hurry though. I’ll give you a day to enjoy all you want. By dusk tomorrow, the Licheng Afterglow Island will disappear from this world.” Mo Fan scratched his ear.

Mo Fan spoke with such confidence that the crowd around him cursed him.

“Let go of Ruan Feiyan and Shu Xiaohua. If you lose, I’ll at the very least spare your life. Then, I’ll cut your limbs, hang you as a punching bag in front of the courtyard. I’ll let go of you after a year of beating,” Seventh Granny said ruthlessly.

Mo Fan studied her carefully. He realized that Seventh Granny was the same woman he had seen in his vision. She had tried to seduce the young fisherman. She looked so much older. More than a decade must have passed after the incident. But she was as wicked as always.

Mo Fan glared at Shu Xiaohua and Ruan Feiyan.

‘This old coot assumes I’m holding these two as hostages,’ Mo Fan thought, amused. ‘What a joke!’ Mo Fan was strong enough to ravage this island to the ground. He had no need for hostages.

Mo Fan ignored her, but he let Shu Xiaohua and Ruan Feiyan go. These two could do nothing to threaten him, after all.

“Granny! Granny! He has drained the holy spring essence from our sacred pool. There’s not even a single drop left!” Ruan Feiyan told the grannies in tears.

The crowd boiled with anger. The young men and women had dared not to confront Mo Fan. But now they wanted to kill him, or at least try.

“Get out of the way. You’re no match for him. I’ll skin him alive, tear his stomach open, and filter his blood in the sacred pool!” Seventh Granny’s expression was frightening to behold.

“I’ve also broken through the barrier and advanced by one grade. The holy spring essence is a jewel in the crown. It’s pure and holy. Filthy and evil-hearted people like you shouldn’t pollute such a holy spring. So, it’s best for me to keep it,” said Mo Fan.

Seventh Granny could not find any words to express her endless fury. She flashed, leaving black and silver dust in the place. She then made several leaps before appearing before Mo Fan.

She was a Space element mage!

She was very skillful. She must have a high level of cultivation.

When she drew close to Mo Fan, her gaze transformed into thousands of silver needles and pierced Mo Fan from every direction. If Mo Fan failed to withstand her attack, his body would be riddled with holes!

A handsome creature covered in star-patterned fur lunged and shattered Seventh Granny’s silver needles with its glowing star patterns. It then charged at Seventh Granny and bit her. The effect was so strong that even the grove shook.
