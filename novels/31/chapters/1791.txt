Chapter 1792: The Trampling by the Ruler-level Rock Creature

Translated by XephiZ

The wind began to blow on the mountain, sweeping the dust from the ravine into the air. Cocoons of ash were scattered on both sides of the ravine. The onlookers had yet to recover from the astonishment of witnessing the destructive punch, just like the Rock Monsters.

“This...this...” Zhou Donghao almost dropped his jaw on the ground. He finally blurted out after some time, “Is that thing retarded? It was punching the wrong way!”

The defenders of the clock tower were dumbfounded too, not just because they had witnessed the power which the punch possessed, but the target it was after. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Is it messing with us?” Wen Xia blurted out, staring at the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon.

The Brown Rock Mages were arranged in lines, their bodies encapsulated in brown light. However, the barrier they set up stood alone in front of the tower. The defensive spell was meant to defend them from the enemy’s attack, and they had braced themselves for the attack in advance to stop the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon’s push with everything they had. They were even prepared to be injured from the impact, but the outcome was completely outside their expectations!

The attack never came... the defensive spell was basically a waste!

In terms of shock, the Rock Monsters and the Granite Beasts were definitely more dumbfounded than the humans.

The Granite Beasts were standing on both sides of the ravine. They were raising their arms like apes and cheering for their king while it was about to destroy the tiny but tenacious humans. However, they froze like statues and even forgot to put their arms down. They were staring at the end of the ravine in disbelief. Words could not even describe how traumatized they were!

Even the Servant-class creatures would not make such a stupid mistake. How could their Ruler-level leader possibly do such!?

The Mages defending the clock tower were dazed with disbelief, while the Rock Monsters were terrified!

The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon took a few steps forward. It lifted its leg and kicked forward.

The Rock Monsters began to wonder if they were dreaming after seeing their leader’s strange behavior. The kick sent a fierce wave of sand across the ground. The Rock Generals and Granite Beasts planning to attack the clock tower immediately fled for their lives.

The wave of sand was not insanely fast, since it was covered an area over a kilometer wide. Even the clock tower was not a kilometer across. The Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon was obviously not giving the Rock Monsters any chance to survive!

The wave of sand was traveling slowly, but it was only slow relative to the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon’s size. It was similar to a huge storm. One might see it appearing in the distance and slowly head toward their city, but regardless of where they went, the storm would still be looming over their head and their surroundings.

The wave of sand was the same. It was huge but slow, and it was not only devouring a single building or a street, but an entire city and mountain!

Rocks of various sizes were bouncing around wildly. The Rock Monsters were not only in the middle of raining bullets, but deadly blasts, too. The Rock Monsters with weaker defenses did not stand a chance at all. Meanwhile, the higher-level Rock Generals were only able to survive with pure luck, since even the Granite Beasts would be left with holes if they were not making the right moves...

The wave of sand swept forward like a terrifying storm. The lives of the Rock Monsters were solely dependent on their luck. The noisy battlefield soon fell quiet, leaving only the scattered remains of the Rock Monsters behind!

“I kept praying to Heavens to bring us a miracle, but a miracle like this...” commander-in-chief Xie Qinghua admitted after a long silence.

The miracle she imagined was a glimpse of light in a hopeless situation, but she had received three scorching suns in return, instead!

Did the Creator happen to be passing by the city, and casually modify the logic of the world, turning the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon against its people after seeing how pitiful the humans in the city were?

The wisest of the Granite Beasts finally realized what was going on after their army suffered heavy losses twice.

They began crying to alert the Rock Monsters that the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon was no longer their leader. The human it had absorbed had taken over its body. It was now their enemy!

The trembling Rock Monsters finally understood. They were not a sheet of loose sand after all. They started to regroup and form a strong resistance army under the leadership of the Granite Beasts to take on the Golden-Armored Wolframite Demon.

“They are finally showing their temper now? It’s time for me to teach them how to behave themselves!”

Mo Fan was amused when he saw the Granite Beasts revolting against him.

The Granite Beasts and a huge number of Rock Generals were standing a kilometer away from Mo Fan. They were undisciplined and disordered a moment ago, but they had no choice but to come together against a greater foe.

The Granite Beasts used their Earth Magic, Summoning huge boulders out of nowhere and tossing them at Mo Fan. Countless rocks began to pour down at Mo Fan’s location. Some were the size of small hills, others merely the size of small cars!

“It’s just a drizzle!”

Mo Fan took a huge step forward. How could his shiny armor be afraid of these little bricks? He might have had to run away with his tail between his legs from the rain of rocks before, or rely on Zhao Manyan’s defense, but he could not feel any better when he was now able to ignore the attacks and charge forward recklessly!

Mo Fan was only five hundred meters away from the Granite Beasts after taking a single step.

They were just a bunch of Granite Beasts, after all. Their strength was nowhere close to the Black-Silver Rock Demons, yet Mo Fan had already taken out three of the Black-Silver Rock Demons, and taken over the last and strongest one!

“You finally realize you should be running? Weren’t you having fun tossing the boulders at me? Try running away from this... Rising Ground Cage!”

Mo Fan stomped the ground heavily with his right foot.

A surge of energy swept forward rapidly and reached the spot where the Granite Beasts had gathered.

The ground suddenly rose fifty meters. The walls were forming a huge circle, corralling the rebelling Granite Beasts in the middle like a huge pen!
