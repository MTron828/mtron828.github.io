Mo Fan walked toward Wu Ku.

Wu Ku looked behind Mo Fan and saw a demonic shadow connected to his body moving on its own, like paint sprayed on him.

“AHHHH!!!”

Wolf Chief let out screams of agony. No one knew what had happened to him, but they could sense the despair in his cries!

The cries kept going while the figure of the Elder of the Shadow Tribe was moving.

Damon stood on the other side of the lake. He shuddered when he saw how the Elder of the Shadow Tribe was torturing Wolf Chief.

An elder being of the Darkness Plane had broken its chains and come to their world. He would have died multiple times if Mo Fan had used it on him instead!

Damon was suddenly relieved he had made the right choice. Otherwise, the terrifying Elder of the Shadow Tribe would be torturing him instead!

—

“It looks like Salan isn’t going to risk her life to save you this time.” Mo Fan stared at Wu Ku.

Wu Ku’s expression was constantly shifting. He did not expect Mo Fan to actually clear a path to him. Most importantly, Mo Fan had not used the power of the demon inside him to do so!

It was true that Salan was not going to show up again. She had only wanted the war to break out so she could obtain more evil power as she walked in the kingdom of death.

She had achieved her goal once the war was beyond the point of no return. Wu Ku was no longer as valuable to her as he used to be!

“As expected of the biggest stumbling block of our church, you have always caused trouble whenever we are holding a ceremony. Such a pity, we are always a step ahead of you, just like Bo City. There’s nothing you can do. The things that should happen have already happened!” Wu Ku started attacking Mo Fan’s resolve.

“Humans are meant to improve in little steps. I never expected myself to do anything shocking. I’m satisfied with the improvements I have compared to my previous attempts,” Mo Fan replied.

Did he really fail to do anything? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He was only hoping to survive in Bo City.

He had saved the Ancient Capital from being destroyed.

He had stopped the Black Vatican at Beijiang.

And now, he had restrained the Black Vatican in the Andes Mountain Range!

Every step he took was more convincing than the previous one!

He had even found one of the culprits from the Calamity of Bo City today!

It was good enough for Mo Fan.

“You have no idea how big our church is. What you see is only the tip of the iceberg!” Wu Ku nattered on.

“One has to start digging out a mountain from the inside. As long as the Black Vatican is still around, my gates of Hell will remain open. It’s fine if the results aren’t all flying colors. After all, I’m still young, but your Cardinals aren’t,” Mo Fan pointed out.

It all came down to whoever could live the longest!

Mo Fan had sworn to fight the Black Vatican until the end. He was a man of his word.

Wu Ku tried to destroy Mo Fan’s will to resist the Black Vatican. He did not believe anyone would be willing to sacrifice everything just to take down the Black Vatican.

Even the Holy Judgment Court and the Magic Association were not so diligent, so why would an ordinary person like him bother to go after the Black Vatican by risking his life?

Wu Ku’s face twisted like he had just eaten dog poop after hearing Mo Fan’s words.

His role as the Head Priest was to demoralize unbelievers. In the church, every member from the Gray Priests to the Blue Deacons had the urge to listen to his teachings and gradually fell under his influence, but not only did his usual tricks fail to work, he was doubting himself for once!

In terms of age, Mo Fan would indeed live longer than Salan. Twenty years from now, Mo Fan would be in his prime, while Salan’s drive would slow as she aged.

Wu Ku shook his head. Why was he the one being brainwashed here?!

“I was a monk before I joined the Black Vatican. Can you let me die a peaceful death?” Wu Ku tried to withhold his anger and grudges, and acted like he was negotiating.

“Dying at my hand is the most appropriate way,” Mo Fan answered simply.

“You are being unreasonable!” Wu Ku’s expression changed instantly. He had looked as calm and gentle as an old monk, but his face was as ghastly as a demon in the next second!

There was no room for negotiation between a butcher and a dog!

Mo Fan suddenly sprang forward, leaving sparks on the spot he was previously standing on. A huge chunk of the ground there compressed.

He reached Wu Ku in an instant as he was engulfed in flames. He perfectly resembled the marvelous God of Fire depicted in ancient myths!

Wu Ku slid backward in response.

Orbs of water immediately burst out of his body, each clear and distinctive as they joined together to protect Wu Ku like prayer beads.

Water Prayer Beads!

Wu Ku had Awakened a Super Power of the Water Element, too.

The prayer beads were perfect for his identity as a monk, yet he had sided with the evildoers and destroyed lives, instead of helping them!

“Let’s see how many of these prayer beads you have!”

Mo Fan was like an enraged deity. His heavenly flames instantly unleashed their full potential.

From afar, it looked like a mountain of flames was standing between Mo Fan and Wu Ku.

The mountain of flames was only a precursor. Mo Fan was just starting to unleash its full power!

“God of Fire: Rising Phoenix!”

A pair of fiery wings emerged from the mountain.

It was clearly depicting Phoenix Mountain from the myths, home to a phoenix that could burn everything for a hundred kilometers around from its peak!

The landscape from the upper stream to the middle stream of the Scorching River dried up instantly.

The moist rainforests on both sides of the river erupted into flames. The fire continued to spread wildly and threatened the rebel camps!

The sky was scorched as red as blood. Fire was sweeping across the sky like lightning in the form of shocking red flashes.

The phoenix arose on the top of the mountain and unleashed the flames of destruction from its body.

The prayer beads broke, one by one. Water might be effective against fire, but it had no chance of stopping a phoenix that could regenerate endlessly in cycles. It dove below Mo Fan and flew out the other side of the mountain!

Everything was burned into ashes. The wings of the phoenix only covered a span of fifty meters, but its flames extended over a kilometer beyond them as it glided above the woods.

The flames of its wings were the boundary line of its territory. Everything inside that area was burned into ashes!

Wu Ku had close to a thousand Water Prayer Beads on him.

He and his prayer beads were constantly knocked back. Wu Ku had an Innate Soul-grade Water Seed and an abundant supply of magic, but his Water Prayer Beads continued to evaporate and break in the face of the phoenix’s inextinguishable flames.

Wu Ku’s face filled with fear and despair as his Water Prayer Beads continued to disappear.

He could not stop the flames. The Calamity Fire was capable of destroying the Heavens and Earth.. He was just a human with a special innate talent. He was too tiny to escape his fate of being buried in the sea of flames!
