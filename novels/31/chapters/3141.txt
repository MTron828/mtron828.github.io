Chapter 3141 - 3141: Gate of Stars Under the Ocean

After moving through the dark, barren mountains, the Little Loach was stuffed.

Plenty of Darkness Creatures resided in those mountains. Most of the creatures were Crazed Creatures, and they had no intellect or rationale.

They did not care whether a god or low-intelligence life form was standing in front of them. As long as they saw a moving creature, they would immediately pounce on it like rabid monsters. To them, the final fate was to rest in peace.

Since they were all monsters with no intellect, killing them felt great. Mo Fan continued his massacre as he moved through the mountains, and the number of carcasses were enough to form a country of white bones.

Honestly, it had been a long time since MO Fan had fun fighting.

He did not have to worry about destroying the environment or care about releasing too much energy and hurting innocent creatures nearby. Most importantly, killing these creatures was a form of salvation for them, so he did not need to feel guilty in the slightest.

All the Star Sons of his Elements were upgraded. The Shadow Element’s Forbidden Curse also solidified. By the time MO Fan walked out of the mountains, he had already become twice as strong as when he first stepped onto the Dark Plane.

“Your Pseudo Forbidden Curse has about half the power of a Forbidden Curse, right?” Asha’ruiya had also witnessed MO Fan’s growth in strength.

Usually, when someone pushed an element to the level of a Forbidden Curse, it would be really difficult to make it even stronger. But it was different for MO Fan. His basic magic foundation was huge, which meant that he had plenty of ways to get stronger.

Whenever a branch of one element got stronger, it could make all of MO Fan’s other elements stronger.

“Is that the Galaxy of the Yin Energy God?” MO Fan pointed at the endless expanse of black ahead of them.

After they passed through the mountains, the land became exceptionally flat. A thin layer of water resembling that of a mirror covered the land. As such, the land looked like a black mirror that reached the edge of the world.

Meanwhile, the sky was blood red. Curiously, there were mountains and valleys in the sky. There was also a large number of Darkness Creatures within them. When MO Fan looked over, the sky reminded him of bat caves and rivers full of flies. It was a terrifying sight.

“No,” Asha’ruiya said with a shake of her head.

“Are you sure? It looks like a twisting waterfall,” MO Fan said.

“You’ll know once we get closer.”

Dean Xiao was on Riverview Island in the East Ocean. He had his hands behind his back as he stared at the raging ocean. It was that way due to the migration of a large group of White Ocean Serpent Demons.

The White Ocean Serpent Demons acted like the prawns that fishermen reared. The ocean was huge, but they twisted their bodies together. There were three to four White Ocean Serpent Demons in one small region alone!

They were also not of low rank, so when such a large number of them gathered to migrate, the sight was incredibly grand but suffocating.

“Dean, where are the White Ocean Serpent Demons running to?” Zhao Manyan asked in puzzlement to his side.

“This has something to do with the earth spirits under the ocean,” Dean Xiao said.

“The earth spirits under the ocean? Is it related to that person in our institute?” Zhao Manyan’s eyes flew wide open.

Zhao Manyan had been on vacation in Europe with Ayleen. She had an inborn sense of romanticism and charm, so he had been having a good time. Sadly, Pearl Institute suddenly contacted him and asked him to return.

Right after he came back, Dean Xiao brought him out to the ocean.

As his Water Element Forbidden Curse tutor, Dean Xiao played a huge role in helping him push his Water Element to the level of a Forbidden Curse. Hence, he had no other choice but to listen to him. If his tutor wanted him to go on a business trip, he had to follow.

“I’m still not entirely sure. But when the Undead under the ocean first entered the city, we only chased them away. We never solved the root of the problem,” Dean Xiao said.

“Ah… Where has MO Fan gone? We could have asked him to talk to Yumian. We might have been able to resolve another disaster of the century, ” Zhao Manyan said.

“We should solve this problem on our own. Let’s treat this as your first lesson after becoming a Water Element Forbidden Curse Mage, ” Dean Xiao replied.

“Dean Xiao, I’m really busy—” Before Zhao Manyan could finish speaking, the roaring ocean abruptly turned a strange shade of red.

It was similar to the color of the rising sun, and it turned the entire surface of the ocean bright and brilliant. But upon closer look, one would notice that the red was also similar to that of blood. It was as if the surface of the ocean had turned into the belly of a huge fish, and blood was oozing out of the fish’s stomach.

“It’s blood! Dean Xiao, the ocean is bleeding!” Zhao Manyan had never seen such a terrifying sight, and he instantly screeched.

“It’s from the bottom of the ocean!” Dean Xiao pointed at the ocean and locked onto the root of the strange change.

“Dean Xiao, the White Ocean Serpent Demons are… Holy… No way!” Zhao Manyan’s expression was full of shock. Then, he felt his skin crawl, as though insects were gnawing at every inch of it.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

How scary!

The dense group of White Ocean Serpent Demons looked as if they had been thrown into a huge pot of oil. The red ocean was cooking them, and he could see the flesh of the plump serpents being cooked to such tenderness that it fell off the bone!

Their scales, skin, blood, bones, horns, and organs fell to bits. In the blink of an eye, Dean Xiao and Zhao Manyan could no longer see any living White Ocean Serpent Demon. All of them had disintegrated!

Zhao Manyan’s jaw dropped. He could not imagine the kind of power that could do this.

It was as if the red ocean was an endless altar, and the migrating White Ocean Serpent Demons were living sacrifices!

“We were wrong. They were not migrating. Something chased them here, ” Dean Xiao said grimly.

“Let’s go. This is ridiculous!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

“Yes. Let’s. We’re going to the bottom of the ocean to investigate this!” Dean Xiao said with a nod.

“What?” Zhao Manyan was stunned.

He never said he wanted to go down!

“We’re going down from here. The elevation at the southern part of the island is too high for us.” Dean Xiao grabbed Zhao Manyan’s arm and flew so quickly that he blew the waves to the side while doing so.

“No no no no no! I haven’t decided yet!”

“Speaking of which, you’re school mates with Ding Yumian. It’ll be easier for you to do this since you’ll be seeing a familiar face.”

“Are you serious?! You can’t just set me up like this!”

“We have to try everything in desperate situations. Since MO Fan isn’t here, I’ll have to turn to you. The institute has poured all of its resources into you to make you a Forbidden Curse Mage. You should do something back for the institute.”

“Say that to Ding Yumian then! You’re her dean!”

“You two belong to the same batch. You have more common topics of conversation.”

“Dean Xiao, I’m smelling MO Fan’s stinking stench of shamelessness on you. Whenever something dangerous happens, he drags me along with the same attitude!” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

“Since we’re already here, we might as well do the job. I’m going to alert and intimidate the Emperor of the Undead at the bottom of the ocean later. Do your best to approach Ding Yumian as a friend—I’

“Dean Xiao, after today, we’re no longer teacher and student!”

“Don’t you want to learn the Light Element Forbidden Curse?”

“I think I’m capable of upgrading my Light Element on my own!”

“How confident. Good on you, but you still have to do your job,” Dean Xiao said.

Zhao Manyan pulled a long face as he stared at the red deep-sea region ahead of him.

He came to realize something: even though he had become a Water Element Forbidden Curse Mage, he was still a child before Dean Xiao.

What was Dean Xiao’s deal?

Was he really that unbelievably strong?

The water at the bottom of the ocean was clean.

When they were approximately seven thousand meters deep, the red ocean region hung above their heads like a huge, endless lake.

The ocean region down below might appear tranquil, but it was filled with a terrifying, cold presence that seeped right into their soul. They felt as if their souls were already buried at the bottom of the ocean before they even reached it!

The ocean floor was covered in bones.

It was a true mass graveyard, while the surface of the ocean was nothing. Even the stones had countless fossils embedded in them.

The large fossils resembled a mountain range at the bottom of the ocean.

Just then, this “mountain range” squirmed. They could even sense that it was moving toward them.

Zhao Manyan held his breath. The dark creature was even more ridiculous than the Black Totem Turtle, and he had a feeling that it was not weaker in the slightest.

“That’s it. I’ll hold it back. Look for the master of the bottom of the ocean, Dean Xiao said.

“Are you sure you can hold it back?” Zhao Manyan gulped. Despite being a Forbidden Curse Mage, he was terrified by the creature’s imposing aura.

“Go! We don’t have much time!” Dean Xiao said.

So, Zhao Manyan braced himself and continued swimming to the rift at the bottom of the ocean.

The rift was releasing a light similar to that of an aurora. It was beautiful, but there was something about it that could make a person go mad. The terror and shock Zhao Manyan felt earlier suddenly turned into infatuation and yearning.

It was as if a treasure that every person could ever want was contained within the rift. It also felt as if the rift would lead him to an ethereal kingdom whose existence surpassed that of heaven. Humanity’s limited imagination could never imagine it.

Hence, Zhao Manyan continued diving down. The sides of the rift were not covered in cold stone, but they shone with a brilliant, flowing light.

There was more light deeper down the rift. This light was even more enchanting and reminiscent of a fleeting galaxy in the vast universe.

Zhao Manyan could not believe what he was seeing.

Was this really the bottom of the ocean?

Was it really not the shore of the universe?

Was this how the mysterious region that humanity had never reached looked like?

It was infinite, brilliant, mysterious, and sacred.

Zhao Manyan even forgot about the terrifying sight of the White Ocean Serpent Demons dying at the surface earlier.

Perhaps the unique nature of this gate to the mysterious region made it necessary for it to be opened in such a mysterious fashion.

“Welcome, Witch Empress!”

Suddenly, an ancient voice rang out from the rift of flowing light.

Zhao Manyan was certain that he was not listening to human language, but he could somehow understand what was said.

In shock, he looked over and saw someone near the rift.

This figure was graceful and bewitching. She looked as wickedly charming as a mermaid queen but also gave off the awe-inspiring nobility of an ice queen.

She turned to the side, and Zhao Manyan saw her face.

It was Ding Yumian, the current ruler of the Undead at the bottom of the ocean!

Who was welcoming her?

Where were they asking her to go?

Although Zhao Manyan was still in shock, his mind raced.

“Something chased the White Ocean Demon Serpents to this region of the ocean. Once they were all sacrificed, a gate opened.

“Is this gate welcoming Ding Yuming to some other place?

“Is Cold Moon Evil Eye in cahoots with the Undead at the bottom of the ocean?

“This is bad!”

Zhao Manyan instantly thought of this possibility.

The Undead at the bottom of the ocean were already extremely powerful. After Ding Yumian became an empress, the Undead became even stronger and had a general commanding them.

Following the disappearance of the Ancient King and the banishment of Khufu, the strongest King of the Undead could only be one person—Ding Yumian.

A bringer of disaster was bound to create a ruckus no matter when they showed up in the world. Even if they turned into an Undead, they would still be spiritually superior to all other beings!

“Ding Yumian! Don’t fall for Cold Moon Evil Eye’s tricks!

“Look, we can set a Spirit Blossom Festival every year to commemorate your soul… Oh, no! She’s leaving!”

Zhao Manyan saw Ding Yumian walking forward.

She was heading toward the “galaxy,” and it was obvious that the gate did not lead to a good place!

Ding Yumian might have been blinded by whatever lies Cold Moon Evil Eye had told her! She might have even lost her humanity within the dark ocean depths! Even so, he could not let her meet up with Cold Moon Evil Eye no matter what!

He had to do whatever it took to stop it!

“Ding Yumian, we’ve been giving you offerings every year!

“Don’t do anything stupid!”

Zhao Manyan raced over to the bottom of the shining rift.

The shining rift was even larger than it seemed. As Zhao Manyan sank into the light, he felt as tiny as a plankton. He shouted, but his voice could not travel at the bottom of the ocean.

The only thing he could do was keep charging toward the gate. He refused to give himself any time to regret his decision even when he saw all the light being sucked into the gate.

Zhao Manyan could not resist the power of the suction, and his body was pulled into the gate where Ding Yumian had just crossed over.

When Ding Yumian stepped through the gate, she did so in a fashion that was different from others who had been accidentally dragged in. She took each step voluntarily. No matter how strong the voice that called out to her was, she could resist it if she wanted.

“This way.”

An ancient voice came from within the gate.

Ding Yumian then disappeared behind the gate at the bottom of the ocean.

“Did you hear something that sounded like a human?” the ancient voice suddenly asked.

“You will not be disappointed by this trip.” The ancient voice stopped dwelling on the other voice and smiled.

Ding Yumian walked over to the ancient voice and glanced at a corner of the flowing light. Over there, she saw Zhao Manyan struggling against the powerful light like a moth that had fallen into water.

She flicked her finger discreetly.

It created a hole in the gate, and a large amount of light shone through the hole.

Zhao Manyan was pushed in another direction by the river of light, and he disappeared into the new hole.

Once she was done, Ding Yumian approached the ancient voice. The vast starlight at the bottom of the ocean felt her citizens who were enveloping her as she walked toward an illusory throne..
