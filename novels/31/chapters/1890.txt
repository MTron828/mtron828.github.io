The lightning exploded across the lake. Lightning arcs flew around destructively and spread across half of Wuyuan Bay!

The Viscera Hunters were relatively agile creatures, but it was far too late for them to escape when they saw the terrifying lightning burst out of Mo Fan’s body. The Electro Cannon’s area of effect was surprisingly wide, and the Viscera Hunters on the lake were completely devoured by the lightning. They dispersed like ashes after falling to the Lightning Tyrant’s twelvefold damage amplification.

The lightning flickered wildly and lit up the gray sky. Zhang Lulin and Zhang Xin dropped their jaws when they saw the lightning bolts surging into the sky.

Was that really an Advanced Spell?

Since when was there an Advanced Spell strong enough to kill dozens of Viscera Hunters instantly?

The Viscera Hunters were a bunch of cold-blooded creatures that usually hunted in packs. They were not bothered by the deaths of their comrades. As a matter of fact, they would feel thrilled when their comrades died, as the scent of death was a delicacy to them!

The rest of the Viscera Hunters charged at Mo Fan after smelling the ashes of their comrades lingering in the moist air. They displayed a strange ability to control their bones. They had skinny figures just before they leapt into the air, but suddenly had bones growing out of their bodies like axes when they attacked Mo Fan. They went from swiping their claws in the air to slashing at Mo Fan with twin axes. The surface of the axes gleamed eerily while they were swinging at Mo Fan with formidable power!

Mo Fan knew the Viscera Hunters were good at turning their bones into all kinds of weapons, including swords, axes, spears, and blades. Each Viscera Hunter had their favorite tools to torture their prey with. The strength of the light on their weapons represented the evil power they had collected, which could dramatically increase the damage of their bone weapons.

Mo Fan was currently being flanked. The Viscera Hunters were pouring down like a huge rain with strange-looking bone weapons, slashing at Mo Fan from different angles, which turned into a red-blue hurricane shredding everything along its trail.

Mo Fan did not plan to let these creatures enter the island. He had purposely lured the creatures to Wuyuan Bay, but another group of Viscera Hunters had jumped out of the water after he had just dodged the wave of attacks from the first group of Viscera Hunters with relatively quick movements. The Viscera Hunters threw their bone spears at the spot Mo Fan had landed on!

The bone spears lined up in the sky and loomed over Mo Fan’s head like a web of bones. The bones emitted an eerie red light and suppressed Mo Fan’s body as he was planning to Blink away from the area. They were preventing him from escaping through the other dimension.

Mo Fan landed on a tree that was floating on the water. He looked up and saw more bone spears falling down at him. He was slowly running out of space to dodge the spears.

Mo Fan did not expect the creatures to be capable of nullifying his Blink. These Viscera Hunters had undergone some kind of training. They knew how to engage their enemy strategically. They were using the eerie lights of their weapons to suppress their prey!

“Time Stasis!”

Mo Fan had no choice but to use the Space Element. His pupils emitted a silver light as he created a Time Stasis rhombus.

The bone spears were like a rain of arrows, while Mo Fan’s rhombus was like a straw boat. The straw boat was fully covered in bone spears. Even Mo Fan was struggling to hold the rhombus in place for long due to the overwhelming pressure. He immediately fled to a more favorable spot.

These creatures are phantoms. I doubt my Fiendish Night is going to work against them... Mo Fan distanced himself from the Viscera Hunters. He was about to use the Dark Material to relieve himself from the pressure when he noticed an important problem. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Fiendish Night was only effective against living creatures. Phantoms did not necessarily even have shadows, let alone trying to turn their shadows against them.

Mo Fan did not waste his time spreading darkness since he could not use the Fiendish Night against the Viscera Hunters. His Fire Element was weaker due to the heavy storm, so he could only rely on his Lightning Element while using the Space and Earth Elements as support!

Zhang Lulin’s voice came from the distance as Mo Fan was coming up with a plan. “Water Curtain!”

The Water Curtain was not that thick, but it was enough to give Mo Fan some time to prepare his counterattack. Mo Fan quickly accumulated his Will when he saw twenty-some Viscera Hunters charging at him.

The Viscera Hunters were capable of moving on water. They were like demons when they were running, using all four of their limbs like pouncing beasts, dashing and jumping around on the surface of the lake. They tried to disturb Mo Fan with the annoying screeches produced when their fangs rubbed against one another.

Mo Fan could not possibly let such a strange trick interfere with his mind. He proceeded to start the Space Bolts which he had perfected recently.

The Space Bolts made of his will were invisible indoors, but their outlines were visible in the rain, hovering half a step behind Mo Fan. The Space Bolts unleashed a terrifying murderous aura as Mo Fan’s eyes glittered.

The Space Bolts sprang forward, leaving trails in the air before landing accurately on the Viscera Hunters. Over a score of the Viscera Hunters were running on the water, yet half of them fell after the first wave of Space Bolts!

Mo Fan gathered his Will to strengthen the Space Bolts. He realized not only were these Space Bolts effective against lesser creatures, they were just as powerful as the spells he normally used if he focus-fired on a specific area.

“Come back here!”

Mo Fan quickly Summoned the Space Bolts back to him. He had purposely left a few of them behind in case the Viscera Hunters leapt out from different locations. If the Viscera Hunters were so close to him that he was unable to cast another spell in time, he could easily fire the Space Bolts at the creatures to defend himself.

Mo Fan found another chance to cast an Advanced Spell after eliminating the group of Viscera Hunters.

When Mo Fan saw shadows moving rapidly under the water, he knew another group of Viscera Hunters was planning to ambush him. He decisively tossed a lightning orb into the water and gave the creatures sneaking up on him a fascinating lightning bomb to examine!
