“How about this?” The revenant came up with an idea. She looked at the Soul of Kindness that was unwilling to surrender to her and then at the officials on the altar, “If you convince Zhuang Yue to kill himself on the top of the tower, I’ll leave with all the Undead!”

“That’s a brilliant idea!” Mo Fan immediately agreed.

For every debt, there was a debtor. It was obvious that the Undead’s goal was to take revenge on Councilman Zhuang Yue. Otherwise, why would the Undead surround the Dongfang Oriental Tower, instead of sending them to the other side of the river?

“That won’t do, he’s a Councilman, after all!” Professor Luo said with a frown.

“You can use the same words he used on me against him. If an ordinary student like me can sacrifice myself in exchange for temporary peace, why can’t a Councilman like him sacrifice himself to save the city?” the Undead laughed.

“Lagree!” Mo Fan nodded.

“Lagree too!” Wei Rong added.

“But how can we trust you? What if you continue to attack the city after he dies?” Dean Xiao asked.

“It’s simple, you can ask her to merge with me. You might not trust me, but you can trust that hypocrite. She has been suppressing her power. It’s the reason why we ended up like this. I don’t like my current lifeless body!” the revenant declared.

Everyone looked at Ding Yumian’s Soul of Kindness. The little spirit seemed timid. She was scared to bear the consequences of what was going to happen.

“Can you make sure she keeps her promise?” Dean Xiao asked.

“Little girl, you won’t be able to survive on your own in this world. The Tribe of Sea Gods is incredibly powerful. How can you be sure they don’t have a way to bring us back to life? Don’t you want the man who killed us to pay for what he did to us?” the revenant demanded to know.

Ding Yumian was a Psychic Mage. Her Psychic Element had grown even stronger after she was turned into an Undead.

She did not have to wait for Mo Fan and the others to agree with her suggestion. She had spread her words via telepathy to everyone in the city!

The city became restless.

Ding Yumian’s death a week ago had shocked the city. Countless people had made lanterns to mourn her death and guide her wandering spirit.

To their surprise, Ding Yumian’s spirit had returned in the form of the terrifying tide of Undead currently devouring the Skyscraper Fortress.

Most importantly, they had learned the truth behind her death!

She had been cornered by the cunning Councilman and Dean. She had been forced to sacrifice herself so they could win the battle without losing a single soldier!

Human minds were very strange.

When a robber was holding an innocent passerby as a hostage, many people would accuse the owner of the shop of not giving the robber what he demanded, instead of directing their anger at the robber.

Their minds were not necessarily twisted. It was just their nature of not daring to confront someone who had absolute power and was willing to bring everyone down with them.

She was telling the truth, and singing a melody to earn the people’s compassion.

While she was earning their empathy, they directed their hatred at Zhuang Yue!

Many people were suddenly wishing for Zhuang Yue’s death.

Huge banners rose like they had been prepared in advance. They had Zhuang Yue’s name and the word ‘die’ drawn in red ink!

Zhuang Yue almost fainted in anger when he saw the banners waving in the air.

“Didn’t I do everything for the sake of these pitiful parasites!? And now they are demanding that I sacrifice myself to that ugly monster?

“You filthy animals, what right do you have to offer me as a sacrifice?! Why would you believe the despicable monster’s words? I’m your leader! Without me, all of you would have ended up as food to the sea monsters!”

Zhuang Yue was infuriated. Even though he knew the tide of Undead was Ding Yumian’s way of taking her revenge, he still despised everyone who was wishing for his death.

“Interesting, there are so many Zhuang Yues in this city!” the Undead giggled eerily.

The people who wanted Zhuang Yue dead were doing the same thing as Zhuang Yue had done to Ding Yumian. She was amused by their shameful behavior.

“Every human is selfish,” Dean Xiao could only sigh.

Ding Yumian started floating in the air. The air around her turned liquid.

She floated above the buildings and reached the altar.

The silver curtains pouring down from the altar had cracks all over them. They were obviously reaching their limit.

There were Forbidden Mages on the other side of the river. If Ding Yumian tried to break through with force, their Forbidden Curses would cause massive damage to the city. Not only would the city fall into ruins, there was no guarantee the Forbidden Curses would take out all the Undead. Some of them RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

might still sneak their way past!

“You two can play with them for now,” Ding Yumian ordered the two Rulers who were on standby on the buildings.

The White Skeleton Cuttlefish and the Devilish Giant Crab immediately blocked the group’s path and glared at them.

“My spell is no longer working,” Professor Luo informed everyone else softly.

Mo Fan looked at himself and saw the transparent Aura that had helped him avoid the Undead was fading away. The Undead nearby suddenly turned on him with strong hatred.

“Let’s clear a path and get out of here,” Dean Xiao ordered them. “She is determined to kill Zhuang Yue!”

“Mo Fan, you are a Shadow Mage. We’ll hold the Undead off and clear a path for you. You have to stop her!” Professor Shi said.

The Spring of Darkness not only made Mo Fan stronger, but it also gave him a strong Aura of darkness, especially when he was using Black Magic.

He wove through the Undead. They were not interested in him.

Dean Xiao and Professor Shi had both noticed that, thus they had asked Mo Fan to leave first to stop Ding Yumian.

‘Mo Fan broke free from the surrounding Undead and saw Ding Yumian had already reached the altar. She was working to break through the altar’s defenses, but she seemed quite patient. It was the same as when she and Zhuang Yue were on the island, but this time, it was her turn to slowly force Zhuang

Yue to his death.

It was her revenge.. A tooth for a tooth!
