Ai Tutu was startled. She spun around to see who had stopped her from hitting Gu Jian.

However, her expression changed instantly when she saw the tanned face behind her.

Gu Jian raised his head and saw a man standing behind Ai Tutu, firm like a black treasure sword. His expressionless face was intimidatingly dignified.

Why would he have such an aura when he was the same age as himself?

“Sorry, my sister lacks some manners...” The tanned man did not let go of Ai Tutu’s hand. His face had no expression as he apologized to Gu Jian.

“You...you’re... Ai Jiangtu!” Gu Jian recognized the person. He glanced at the girl who had given him two slaps in the face in disbelief and said, “She...she’s your sister?”

“Brother, I...” Ai Tutu completely withdrew her little demoness temperament, as if she had just seen her strict father. She was as obedient as a little kitten being taught a lesson.

Ai Tutu nodded and slowly let go of Ai Tutu’s hand.

He walked up to Gu Jian and said, “My father has led the army in fighting against the demon beasts for many years, hence he had been loose on my sister, if she has done anything wrong...”

Gu Jian’s face regained some expression when he heard those words.

It seemed like Ai Jiangtu did not want to cross the line with his Gu Family, yet why didn’t he stop her earlier? He had already crawled on the ground and taken two slaps to the face!

“Humph, I admit my defeat since I lost the bet, but the elders in my family won’t get over this easily, since her impersonating my teammate has now cost me my nomination!” Gu Jian had regained his confidence. He had to get his face back.

“My father has a vote, I’ll let him know, as a compensation for your loss,” said Ai Jiangtu in a seemingly humble manner.

The words immediately caused an uproar among the crowd.

Those with the ability to vote were surely authorities of the country. Even some Councilmen or the Chairman of Magic Associations could not guarantee they would get a vote. What kind of background did this Ai Jiangtu have, that his father would have a vote in his hand!?

“Are you serious?” Gu Jian’s eyes glittered.

If he could secure the vote, he would end up the winner even after suffering the three slaps!

“I already have four votes as a representative of the military academy, so my father’s vote won’t make any difference...” said Ai Jiangtu.

The crowd went crazy as soon as he finished the sentence.

Four votes! That guy had four votes!

He was the real provisional candidate!

Even Mo Fan was taken by surprise, and immediately reevaluated the tanned young man who had the temperament of a real Battlemage.

Even someone special like him only had three votes, making him a half-provisional candidate. He was told that someone else was already selected as a provisional candidate, yet he never thought it would be Ai Tutu’s brother, representing the military academy!

The candidates of the World College Tournament were selected from the students of all the higher learning institutes, including the military academy!

“I did hear someone mention that... since you’re willing to do that, I’ll consider it even,” said Gu Jian. He seemed to be barely satisfied with the offer, yet his heart was already pounding wildly.

Even a thousand pieces of gold was not enough to get a vote. Gu Jian was well aware of the vote’s value.

“Oh, I didn’t say it’s even yet,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“What do you want now? I’ve already let her slap me in the face because of my bet with Mo Fan. However, you do know the rules between the renowned families; she has made me lose my nomination! Our Gu Family won’t get over it easily, if it weren’t for the vote from your father...” blurted out Gu Jian, who was scared that Ai Jiangtu would retract his offer.

Ai Jiangtu glanced at Ai Tutu, who was shaking her head, trying to tell him not to turn it into a mess.

However, Ai Jiangtu simply responded with a grin. His eyes were like two swords, stabbing at Gu Jian as he turned away from Ai Tutu!

Gu Jian subconsciously took a few steps back after receiving that glare.

“I can compensate your loss for her wrong, yet the words you’ve said to humiliate her...”

It felt like Ai Jiangtu had completely turned into a different person. A terrifying energy was leaking out from his tanned body.

As he grabbed the air in front of him, Gu Jian was lifted from the ground by an invisible hand, easier than grabbing a little chick!

Gu Jian’s feet left the ground, as if something was holding onto his throat. Blue veins began to surface on his face.

The change of scene was so quick that the crowd surrounding them quickly backed off.

Ai Jiangtu was like a black devil controlling the place. He was only holding his hand in front of him, yet he had already lifted Gu Jian half a meter off the ground. The black energy rolled wildly, so cold that the students felt like they were soaked in freezing water.

“Hey, stop it, please don’t cause any trouble here,” the three referees quickly intervened as they sensed the murderous aura.

One of the referees was already drawing a Star Pattern, intending to stop Ai Jiangtu.. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s none of your business!” snapped Ai Jiangtu, pushing his other hand in the direction of the three referees.

An invisible wave of energy swept forward in the air, pushing the three referees over ten meters away. If they had not slammed into the barrier on the dueling ground, the force was enough to inflict some minor injuries to them.

Mo Fan and Ding Yumian were stunned.

If the guy was a candidate, it implied that his age was close to theirs. On top of that, he was a student from the military academy.

Meanwhile, the three referees were most likely Advanced Magicians. Even if they had not achieved the Advanced Level yet, they would not be far away from it, yet they were simply knocked away so easily by Ai Jiangtu’s soft push!

“What...what are you trying to do? I’m telling you, you don’t want to mess with our Gu Family!” Gu Jian’s voice was trembling. It was difficult for him to talk while something was clenching his throat.

“Talking about family now? Our Ai Family are all soldiers, who risk their lives to protect humanity’s territory north of the Great Wall. The only daughter who isn’t involved with the army was sent here to Pearl Institute, and even my father did not dare to scold her. If it weren’t for the fact that killing you would cost me my spot in the World College Tournament, I’d let those rotten eggs from your Gu Family come and retrieve your corpse instead!” Ai Jiangtu’s roar was like a demon, leaving the crowd’s ears buzzing!

Gu Jian was scared to death, yet Ai Jiangtu was obviously a fearless man. Something similar to a Star Pattern or Star Orbit flickered under Ai Jiangtu’s feet. Gu Jian was slammed into the ground as if he had just received a great blow from above!
