“Let’s find a resting place, we shouldn’t stay here for too long. It will be troublesome if they suspect us of being some illegal immigrants from China,” said Ai Jiangtu.

Speak of the devil, and he will come. As soon as Ai Jiangtu finished talking, a few Japanese that looked like inspectors approached them. They took a glance at the ship that was docked at the harbor and began to ask some questions.

Jiang Shaoxu realized that something did not seem right. She quickly urged the rest to keep quiet and took the initiative to chat with the inspectors.

Jiang Shaoxu was quite fluent in Japanese. and her tone, manner of speaking and temperament immediately turned her into an attractive, glamorous Japanese woman. Her eyes even flickered innocently, with alluring glitter.

“We are from the Lin Group’s ship. We have the permit to come ashore,” said Jiang Shaoxu to an inspector with a mustache.

The inspector looked at the others suspiciously. He walked up to them and started asking questions.

He was asking Jiang Yu, who kept nodding and smiling without saying a word.

They would immediately expose their identities if they said a single word. Even though they knew a few basic international phrases, they were disguised as Japanese. Speaking English would instantly tell the inspectors they were foreigners. Of course, Jiang Yu basically kept repeating to himself, Asshole, stop asking me questions!

The inspector felt even more suspicious. He proceeded to ask Nanyu questions, who remained silent, too.

The other inspectors also noticed something was wrong with them. They quickly exchanged glances with one another, as if they were about to get physical!

“Hey, why are you even asking them questions? Didn’t I mention that I’m a teacher of an institute for the deaf and mute? They are a bunch of deaf and mute students from a wealthy background. They won’t be able to understand you, you have to use sign language!” Jiang Shaoxu said to the inspectors, rolling her charming eyes.

Jiang Shaoxu immediately made some hand gestures at Nanyu. The hand gestures were commonly used among Battlemages. Nanyu quickly reacted and responded with hand gestures, too.

The inspectors could not understand sign language. Half of their doubts were cleared after hearing Jiang Shaoxu’s explanation.

Not long after, the captain of the ship handed the inspectors the permit. The inspectors finally let them go.

“Damn it, I really have the urge to beat them up!” said Mo Fan unpleasantly.

There were so many people entering and leaving the harbor, yet the inspectors happened to pick on them. There only did so because the girls in their group were gorgeous, a bunch of perverts!

“Alright, we’ve just arrived, and we don’t have valid identities, so let’s try not to stir up any trouble with the police or Japan’s Magic Association. Otherwise, it will be nothing but trouble,” said Nanyu.

“Yeah, we should head to the place that the advisors mentioned. Not sure how far it is from Tokyo.”

Mo Fan did not share the same thoughts as them. He had finally made it overseas; if he did not stir some trouble, how could he possibly return to his country and face his people with glory?

——

The team left the dock and passed the security. They were basically safe after reaching Xixiong City. The police in Japan was not so free that they would check everyone’s identity. In other people’s eyes, they were just a group of young adults.

Hotels and inns were basically no-gos, needing some kind of identification. There was no illegal inn in this city that was located close to the sea.

Left with no choice, the abject geniuses could only find a temple on the waist of a mountain. The temple agreed to let them stay for the night after receiving a sizable donation from them.

The temple was called Yanming Temple, a typical Japanese temple. The symbolic stone frame was located at the foot of the hill, with stairs made of marble leading up to the temple. The temple was not particularly huge, and there were not many visitors around. Apart from a few monks, the illegal aliens were the only ones in the temple!

The temple had two stone-carved turtles at the front, their size similar to guardian lion statues. The others proceeded to take a rest on the comfortable beds, yet Mo Fan chose to sit on the back of a stone turtle. From there, he could see all of Xixiong City, the jagged shoreline, and the Pacific Ocean extending into the east. In simple words, it was a temple with a scenic view of the sea on the waist of a mountain!

In their country, temples usually had lots of visitors. The monks were usually well-fed as a result, yet somehow, this Yanming Temple was cold and cheerless. Weren’t urban residents more inclined to visit a quiet and secluded place like this? Or perhaps the monks had somehow ruined the reputation of the temple?

“You... what do you think you’re doing? Come down quick, you can’t sit on the Sacred Ghost, I’ve never seen such a disrespectful visitor!” a fairly good-looking monk came up and scolded Mo Fan.

The monk was speaking in Japanese, hence Mo Fan could not understand him. However, judging from his wild reaction and how he was waving his hands around, Mo Fan believed that he must be complimenting his exceedingly handsome appearance!

“Do you even talk?” The young monk was quite agitated. His tone was slightly furious.

Mo Fan finally understood what he was mad about. He quickly jumped down from the stone turtle and spoke in English, the international language, “Your temple doesn’t have many people, and I feel like the decorations are quite unique. The location is pretty nice too, facing the sea, a stable Wifi connection...”

“You’re not a local?” the young monk replied in English too. He was rather fluent, implying that he had achieved a good result in English when he was still a student, before he became a monk.

“I’m from China, I’m here to experience the Japanese culture,” Mo Fan replied without hesitation. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The monk was not the police. He would not care if Mo Fan was an illegal alien or a legal visitor.

“Are you sure you’re not here to disrespect our culture instead? You were sitting on the Sacred Turtle, it’s utterly disrespectful. You’ll receive the Punishment of the Ocean if you head out to the sea!” said the righteous monk.

Mo Fan squinted his eyes and glanced at the monk. The monk was around his age and fairly good-looking. His eyebrows were frowning sternly, yet he was clearly proud and arrogant.

“It’s just a statue for decoration purposes. You don’t have to be so serious. You haven’t answered my questions yet; why is the temple so deserted? I even heard some rumors from the people around here before we came here for the night,” said Mo Fan curiously.

“Humph, those idiots are just like you, they ignored our warnings and offended the Sacred Turtle with disrespectful words and acts. They don’t believe the Punishment of the Ocean, yet when something bad happened, they accused us of being responsible instead. They said that we’ve cursed us, and said that we’re a bunch of evil monks. How idiotic!” snorted the monk.
