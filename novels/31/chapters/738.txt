“Damn it, we even put our life at risk to kill the sea monsters!” snapped Nanyu furiously.

“Have you found out any more information about it? Do you know how many children actually went missing?” asked Ai Jiangtu with a deep voice.

“During the past three years... there were more than a hundred cases, especially in the spring every year. These are some documents that I stole from a department of Feiniao City. I’ve also hired some people to ask around in the villages and towns to prove that the missing cases are real! They claimed that the human traffickers were responsible for the missing children... but the cases should have long been classified to be incidents related to demon creatures since many children have gone missing in spring over the past five years!” said Jiang Yu.

Incidents were mainly classified into two groups: man-made incidents and demon-creatures-made incidents.

Man-made incidents were handled by the police and special forces, while the demon-creatures-made incidents were handled by the Magic Association and the military, like the City Hunters and the Battlemages protecting the city. As for the Hunter Union, whenever an incident happened yet there was not enough proof to indicate that demon creatures were involved, or the city council felt that the Magic Association and the military were too inefficient, they would hire the Hunters to handle the incident!

If more than a hundred children had gone missing during the past three years, and most of the cases happened in a specific period of time without any sign of human traffickers, it went without saying that the cases should have been categorized as demon-creatures-made incidents!

“We investigated further and learned that someone had purposely modified the records, to prevent the cases from being categorized as demon-creatures-made incidents...” Mu Tingying went on.

“This Feiniao City is a total disappointment. Regardless of whether demon creatures are responsible for the missing children, they should have made the news public long ago to gather more information and prevent more children from becoming victims!” Nanyu exclaimed angrily.

“Humph, such a useless city council, I’ll call my father now and...” Jiang Shaoxu was furious too.

However, the others immediately fixed their gaze on her.

Jiang Shaoxu seemed to have realized that the words had slipped out of her mouth. She rolled her eyes and said, “What are you all looking at? Can’t I just complain about it to my dad?”

“Miss, I know your father is some powerful authority, but we are currently in the middle of training with our identities hidden. We should try and solve the problem ourselves,” said Mu Tingying.

“Mmm, it’s better not to expose our identities, but we must learn the truth about the missing children. Jiang Yu, have you investigated Lin Junxian’s background? Can we trust him?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

“I did, he’s in charge of the Lin Family’s finances. Apart from some land disputes, he doesn’t have any criminal history. Besides, he helped to build the port and schools in the nearby villages. He also covered the expenses to build many roads. I consider him a fairly kind-hearted investor,” replied Jiang Yu confidently.

“I bet he has nothing to do with the missing children?”

“Unlikely. As a matter of fact, among the missing kids, his cousin, who was recovering in one of the villas here happened to be one of the victims,” said Jiang Yu.

“We better discuss it with Lin Junxian, he’s more familiar with Feiniao City than us,” said Ai Jiangtu.

Inside the meeting room on the highest floor...

Lin Junxian sat at the head of the main table. The representatives of the national team sat to his sides.

Jiang Yu had come well-prepared. He had stored all the information he had collected in a portable disk. He presented the information through the projector.

The team was already furious when they heard Jiang Yu’s brief report. However, their expressions turned darker when they saw the pictures of the families whose infants had gone missing!

Most of the victims were fishermen and farmers. They could easily sense their sorrow just by looking at the pictures. To the government, the missing infants were only a small thing among many other cases, but to the families, it was a deadly blow!

Even after waiting for a long period of time, no one had given them an explanation. According to the people that Jiang Yu had hired, these people were still waiting for someone to save their kids and bring them back...

However, Mo Fan and the others clearly knew the fate of these missing children. The people would most likely faint from shock if they were told the truth!

“That’s enough...” Nan Rongni could not afford to watch further. Her eyes had turned bloodshot.

“This is unforgivable!” Lin Junxian clenched his fists tightly.

He had only come to this city as an investor on behalf of his family. His main goal was to invest in the city and make profits.

Since he came to Feiniao City, he had all kinds of business disputes, yet he had basically done everything with a clear conscience. Little did he know there was such a terrifying conspiracy behind the scenes in Feiniao City!

He was totally disappointed with Feiniao City’s city council!

“I’ll contact Li Jingming right away...” said Lin Junxian.

“Mr. Lin, hold on. We are only discussing with you because we have no idea who’s pulling the strings. Vice mayor Li Jingming might be aware of it, but I don’t think he’s the one we’re looking for. After all, a mayor doesn’t necessarily know everything that their subordinates are up to,” said Ai Jiangtu rationally.

“Yes... you’re right, I’ve come to the conclusion too quickly,” said Lin Junxian.

“Jiang Yu, since you’ve come so far, I bet you already have a plan on how to investigate further?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

“I do... but it’s a bit inhumane,” said Jiang Yu.

“Go on.”

“The person pulling the strings has erased all traces. It’s hard to track him down with the information we have, unless some kids go missing again. When the new missing case is reported, they will surely try to cover it up, which means I can easily track them down and find out who’s behind it!” said Jiang Yu.

No way, you’re using kids as bait?” Nanyu was the first to reject the suggestion.

“There’s no other way,” said Jiang Yu.

Everyone fell silent.

The situation was more complicated than they thought. However, when they recalled the bodies they found in the stomachs of the Scarlet Soaring Demons, their breathing intensified. If they did not resolve the situation, they would feel extremely guilty!

The meeting room was deadly silent. No one knew what to say.

Lin Junxian’s phone started ringing. He glanced at the number and took some time to calm his mind before picking it up.

He started heading toward the door, but before he could step out of it, he was stunned all of a sudden. His hand started trembling that he almost dropped the phone.

The group glanced at the man. They could faintly hear the sound of a woman crying!

Lin Junxian turned around and looked at them with a pale face.

“What’s wrong?” asked Mo Fan.

“My cousin’s second child... he’s...he’s missing too!” said Lin Junxian with great terror.

The young Magicians had only explained the fate of the missing kids to him just a moment ago. When he thought about his one-year-old nephew who had just celebrated his birthday recently would share the same fate...

Lin Junxian could no longer stand properly. At the other end of the phone, a woman was crying sadly. Everyone in the meeting room gasped in shock!
