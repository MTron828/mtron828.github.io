“This is...this is crazy!” Zhang Xiaohou finally regained his wits after a long time.

It was his first time seeing so many winged beasts of different species soaring into the sky at the same time. It felt like the blue sky was covered in feathers!

Zhang Xiaohou climbed back to the Vine Canopy Layer and quickly followed the path he had blazed to regroup with the others.

Something serious must be happening if so many winged beasts, including several high-level species, had shown up at the same time!

“Something big is happening!” Zhang Xiaohou blurted out as soon as he saw Mo Fan, even before he could catch his breath.

“What’s going on?” Mo Fan asked archly.

“The winged beasts, the whole sky is full of them! It feels like they are performing some kind of ritual!” Zhang Xiaohou exclaimed.

Mo Fan and the others were at a spot surrounded by plants, an overgrown area that barely had any sunlight, so they could not see what was going on outside.

Mo Fan quickly found himself a spot where he could see out. He was dumbfounded after just a glance.

The sky was full of winged beasts, as Zhang Xiaohou had mentioned. They were beating their wings, but seemed to be hovering in the sky instead of flying about randomly.

The feathers were as dense as stars when there were so many winged beasts flying in the air. Their colorful feathers were dazzling under the sunlight, a miraculous sight!

“What’s going on? Why are they hovering there?” Mo Fan was confused.

“As I thought, as I thought... Haha, it’s finally happening!” Jiang Shaoxu suddenly yelled in excitement.

The others stared at her in confusion. Jiang Shaoxu proceeded to explain, “I read about it in my brother’s journal. The winged beasts of Mount Baiba will hold a grand ceremony toward the end of a year, when the Wind of Sorrow is at its strongest. Every winged beast will participate in it!”

“The winged beasts have their ceremonies, too? Could it be that their ceremony involves them hovering in the sky and showing their feathers under the sun, to see who has the prettiest feathers?” Zhao Manyan wondered.

“Of course not, it’s not a beauty contest!” Jiang Shaoxu snapped. One-track mind male...

“What are they doing, then?”

“They are waiting for the Wind of Sorrow! The Wind of Sorrow actually has its patterns. Apparently, the Wind of Sorrow will blow up at certain times. With its help, the winged beasts might have a chance to reach the legendary Sacred Waterfall!” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“What are you talking about?” Zhao Manyan’s thoughts were all muddled up.

“An old man living in the Qinling Mountains told me that the winged beasts are not keen about their strength, but their ability to fly. The higher they can fly, the more respect they will receive from their peers. The Emperor of Feathers is the best among them!” Zhang Xiaohou added.

“That’s right, that’s how the status of the winged beasts is determined! The Emperor of Feathers is the one that reaches the greatest height during the ceremony. Once in a while, the winged beasts will hold the ceremony when the Wind of Sorrow is blowing to decide their status and territory on Mount Baiba by the altitude they can reach. They are preparing for it now!” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“So the one that reaches the highest during the ceremony will become the Emperor of Feathers for the next few years?” Mo Fan asked.

“Exactly! The winged beasts treat the ceremony very seriously. They will use everything they have to fly to a higher altitude, to earn the respect of the other winged beasts!” Jiang Shaoxu nodded.

“But, isn’t the number of participants too insane?” Zhao Manyan wondered.

“This is why it’s regarded as a grand ceremony of the winged beasts!” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“But... is it even our concern?” Zhao Manyan said.

“Of course it is! Aren’t you trying to reach the higher layers? If we go up the normal way, we are going to be trapped by the powerful winged beasts before we can reach the altitude where the Tree of Vows is located. The Wind of Sorrow is constantly blowing at the Ashwood Wind Layer. It’s extremely difficult to fight the winged beasts amid the Wind of Sorrow. However, if we can sneak into the winged beasts and fly to the Ashwood Wind Layer together with them, we won’t catch their attention!” Jiang Shaoxu said. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“That’s pretty bold, you’re asking us to compete with the winged beasts. Aren’t we done for as soon as we show our wings?” Zhao Manyan said.

Zhao Manyan still remembered Zhang Xiaohou’s warning. He was not allowed to fly, since it would provoke the winged beasts and turn him into an obvious target!

“Normally, if you aren’t a winged beast, you will be targeted by every winged beast when flying at an altitude that doesn’t belong to you. However, the restrictions regarding altitude are lifted during the ceremony. It doesn’t matter what level or status you are, even the Winged Patrol Beasts will be promoted to a higher status if the altitude they can reach is higher than other winged beasts. It’s a great chance for the winged beasts to shuffle their status, a chance to alter their destiny! With a higher status, they will be able to occupy a higher altitude, thus allowing the winged beasts to evolve even quicker...” Jiang Shaoxu went on.

“It does sound intriguing!” Mo Fan rubbed his chin.

“Brother Fan, it’s a rare opportunity, since every creature with wings has a chance to take part in it, including humans!” Zhang Xiaohou sounded excited.

“Besides, it’s the most reliable way to reach the Tree of Vows’ altitude. I’ve been observing for a long time. There are many Ruler-level winged beasts around here. It’s going to be difficult to break through using force,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“But even a Wind Mage can hardly compete with these winged beasts in terms of flying ability. They will easily outmatch us,” Bai Hongfei said.

“Not necessarily. If we can help the Moon Moth Silkworm evolve, the little Moon Moth Phoenix will be able to bring us to the altitude we are after,” Yu Shishi suddenly piped up.

The silkworm was currently riding on Yu Shishi’s shoulder. The transparent little creature was staring at the winged beasts with wide eyes, as if it had an urge to grow a pair of wings right away.

The Moon Moth Phoenix used to be one of the winged beasts here, too. Even though it had been reincarnated, it could still feel that this place was its home.

“Indeed, the little Moon Moth Phoenix can give us a ride!”

“Let’s hurry up and take down the Giant Purple Linden to help the Moon Moth Silkworm transform into a little Moon Moth Phoenix... humph, it’s time to get our revenge!”
