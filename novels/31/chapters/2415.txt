Mu Ningxue continued to walk up the stairs. The footprints on the higher stairs were a lot deeper than the ones below.

“It seems like you no longer want to know your father’s whereabouts?” Mu Tingying grinned coldly.

“You just came to humiliate me.” Mu Ningxue knew that even if she had followed the instructions, she was not going to get her wish.

In the past, she was fully obedient, without the slightest desire to oppose the Mu Clan’s will. It had been no different from kneeling in front of them.

How could she possibly bend her knees again now?

“So what if it’s true? You still have to listen to me! You are sure you are not going to kneel? Fine, someone else is going to do it. You there, go chop off Mu Zhuoyun’s legs!” Mu Tingying ordered. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Mu Ningxue’s eyes turned icy!

Ice branches were growing out of the trees on the mountain. They turned into icy spikes scattered across the mountain in the blink of an eye, stunning but brimming with murderous intent!

Mu Ningxue had no intention to waste her time on the woman. She had not come to the Mu Clan to negotiate!

“You dare attack me?!” Mu Tingying snarled.

Mu Ningxue waved her hand. The icy spikes grew and combined rapidly.

“Spike Pythons!”

The icy spikes gathered into a long snake stretching all the way up from the waist of the mountain. The whole area was covered in spikes!

The spikes were like spears of ice. It was horrifying to see the snake covered in icy spears sliding around. Mu Tingying was so shocked that she almost failed to set up her defense.

The snake rammed into Mu Tingying and sent her flying.

Her clothes were punctured. Blood was leaking out from the tiny holes.

Mu Tingying was struggling with disbelief. She saw the Spike Python rising into the air while spinning as she was struggling to her feet.

The snake slammed its tail on the ground while spinning, before whipping it at Mu Tingying’s face.

The Spike Python’s tail was initially at the mountain’s waist. It was as large as a giant hammer covered with spikes. Mu Tingying managed to Summon her magic Equipment to defend herself, but she was sent flying like a missile once again.

There was a structure built with stones nearby. It was magnificent and sturdy, a landmark symbolizing the entrance to the Mu Clan’s mansion.

The structure collapsed like a popping bubble after the Spike Python’s tail hit it. The whole woods trembled about it!

Mu Ningxue continued forward. She stepped over the debris of the structure and headed in the direction Mu Tingying had been sent flying to.

She finally saw the badly mangled Mu Tingying after walking for some time.

Tingying’s arms and shoulders were dislocated. Her heavily made-up face had a cut reaching down to the bone. She was unbearably ugly.

Mu Tingying could no longer climb to her feet. Her eyes were about to pop out from their sockets.

She had become the youngest Super Mage of the Mu Clan recently. She even thought she would soon beat Mu Ningxue and trample her.

She had never thought she would fail to withstand a single attack from Ningxue!

What exactly was Mu Ningxue’s cultivation level now?

“You always liked to pick on me.

“You always wanted to compete with me in everything.

“You finally got your wish. How does it feel now?”

Mu Ningxue stood beside Mu Tingying. Her calm and cold expression sent a chill down Mu Tingying’s spine.

How amusing! Mu Tingying was na?ve to think Mu Ningxue was still the same after the World College Tournament.

Did she really think there was not much difference between their strength? Did she assume she would have a chance to beat Ningxue after she achieved the Super Level?

Mu Tingying was incomparable to her in the past. She was just as weak now!

Mu Ningxue walked over a pile of debris without casting another glance at Mu Tingying. She felt sorry for the incompetent and ignorant woman.

Mu Ningxue had never treated Mu Tingying as her opponent. Her targets were the people who had seats in the clan meeting!

They were the representatives of the Mu Clan. They were the ones who had agreed with the decision to execute her in Venice!

—

A bald middle-aged man with sharp brows appeared. “Mu Ningxue, how bold of you to perform such an outrageous act on the Mu Clan’s sacred mountain!”

Mu Ningxue could tell who it was just by hearing his voice.

The Mu Clan had a Disciplinary Hall responsible for punishing disciples who committed offenses. The Disciplinary Hall had a unique status. The Mu Clan’s Disciplinary Mages had the right to execute their disciples without seeking permission from the Magic Association or the government!

As a result, even though Mu Ningxue was a member of the national team, the advisors were not allowed to intervene when the Disciplinary Mages had tried to cripple her cultivation in Venice.

According to them, the Mu Clan had given her everything, so it was reasonable for the Mu Clan to take it all back!

Pan Xi had brought a few Disciplinary Mages of the Mu Clan along back then to discipline Mu Ningxue by crippling her cultivation.

The man who was rebuking Mu Ningxue was the leader of the Disciplinary Hall, Ge Xiong. It went without saying that the Disciplinary Mages would never have shown up in Venice if he had not nodded his approval!

Not everyone in the Mu Clan had the surname Mu. Like other clans, it would sometimes recruit strong Mages of other Elements.

Ge Xiong was one example. He was not an Ice Mage, but a strong Super Earth Mage.

Despite having a different surname, the disciples of Mu Clan treated him with great respect. No one dared to say the slightest rebellious word in front of him, let alone commit an offense within the clan’s territory!

“We only invited your father to discuss some matters with him. So what if he’s a little troubled?” Ge Xiong shouted angrily after inspecting Mu Tingying’s injuries.

“Get someone who’s more worthy to speak to me,” Mu Ningxue replied icily.

Ge Xiong’s face was so tense that his cheekbones were visible after he heard the words.

Even when Mu Ningxue was at her peak when she was still a member of the clan, she was still considered a junior. She was never comparable to someone with actual authority in the Mu Clan like him! Not to mention she was now a wanted criminal of the Disciplinary Hall, and yet she claimed he was not worthy enough?

“Do you think you can do whatever you want here just because you are now a Super Mage? You are unaware of the true essence of the Super Level!

“You are as weak as an insect in front of my Super Power!”

Ge Xiong knew the normal Disciplinary Mages, who were mostly Advanced Mages, were no match for Mu Ningxue, so he had come in person to deal with her.

It was time to settle a job that was long overdue!

Not a single disciple of the Mu Clan could escape the Disciplinary Hall’s punishment. The sentence to cripple Mu Ningxue’s cultivation was already final. He would make sure it was carried out as planned!

The Earth Element was very effective against the Ice Element, too!

Ge Xiong immediately made his move. He did not want the mountain of the clan to be troubled by a single Mu Ningxue. His superiors would think the Disciplinary Hall was unreliable!

“Horn Flash Rock: Thousand Jin Clench!”

Ge Xiong half-clenched his right hand at first and slowly curled his fingers.

The ground started shaking vigorously. A black rock emerged where Mu Ningxue was standing.. It formed a giant hand with half-clenched fingers. The fingers were curling slowly, meant to wrap around Mu Ningxue with great force!
