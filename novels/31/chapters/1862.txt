An imperious figure slowly appeared from among the beating wings. The Bird Emperor slowly descended from among the flock of birds and landed in front of Councilman Nan.

Its cold eyes were fixed on Councilman Nan. The man stood there and looked back at the creature. It was not the first time they had exchanged gazes with one another. When the domestication ranch was first established, Councilman Nan was fully responsible for the project after receiving funding from a foreign businessman. He had glared at the stubborn Bird Emperor more than one time, whipping it with a metal chain forged from the metallic gravel. The more he wanted the outcome, the harder he had whipped the creature!

The torture had happened ten years ago. Even though Councilman Nan’s face had changed significantly, the Bird Emperor still remembered him clearly!

“It was I who created you, it was I who made you! Without me, you wouldn’t be able to order these birds around today. You should be grateful to me! It was I who granted you such power. Otherwise, you would be no different from a wild gull hiding from the rain and storm. You would have ended up as the food of powerful sea creatures at any time! You should be thanking me!” Councilman Nan yelled fanatically, pointing at the Bird Emperor.

The Manta Ray Evil Birds were not truly obedient. When they discovered the trucks were filled with silver ore, they began robbing the trucks, especially the Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds. The silver ore became their delicious food. They shoved the ore into their mouths and broke them into pieces before swallowing them!

“Let go of my silver ore, you bast****! I created you all! You should be obeying my orders! You’re lucky that I didn’t kill you all when you are drugged! Let go of my silver ores!” Councilman Nan yelled when he saw the Manta Ray Evil Birds eating his precious ore.

A rock of silver ore was worth a few tens of RMB notes. It was the source of the money that Councilman Nan had relied on to clear the path for his political career.

The Bird Emperor was reluctant to waste even a second further on the disgusting man. It ordered the Manta Ray Evil Birds, “It’s dinner time!”

As soon as the order was given, the Manta Ray Evil Birds immediately gave up on the silver ores and lunged at Councilman Nan, Chen Wen, and Cai Dong. An area fifty meters wide was instantly filled with a brown tide. The three might have their magic, but they had no chance of defending themselves from so many creatures at once!

Councilman Nan was yelling frantically just a second ago, yet when the demon birds began tearing his skin off, he was overwhelmed by terror amid the pain he was feeling. He could not help but imagine the torture he had to endure as the demon birds slowly tore his flesh apart. He would rather be shot in the head instead...

The demon birds had formed an enormous cloud similar to a giant tornado at the back of the town. It was high enough to reach the clouds and wide enough to cover the whole street. Councilman Nan had done a lot of wicked things, but he was unintentionally kind when he forbid the people who were seeking shelter from getting closer to his silver mine. He was worried that the people would steal the silver ore amid the chaos, so there were not many people at the back of the town. The three men were clearly not enough to feed every Manta Ray Evil Bird. They proceeded to feed on the remaining silver ore on the trucks and in the warehouses instead. Their stomachs were strong enough to digest metal and absorb it to strengthen their bodies. It was why their skin had a metallic sheen!

These creatures were indeed terrifying. Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai, and Tangyue were struggling to calm their thoughts as they witnessed the astonishing sight.

“Mo Fan, are you sure they will leave?” Zhao Manyan asked in a worried voice.

The Bird Emperor had no reason to be friendly toward humans. Mo Fan might have saved its life, but it was still a savage demon creature. These Manta Ray Evil Birds had already bypassed the line of defense along the coastline and reached the vulnerable inland. If they were planning to stir up any trouble, many cities would fall victim to them!

“I’m not sure either, but from the looks of it, the Bird Emperor has everything under control,” Mo Fan replied slowly.

A tiny creature with a sacred silver glow came down while they were talking. It landed right on Mo Fan’s shoulder, as if it was very familiar with him.

“Little Moon Moth Phoenix can actually turn small? HAHA, she looks so adorable!” Tangyue blurted out in surprise.

The little Moon Moth Phoenix had landed on Mo Fan’s shoulder. Even though Yu Shishi kept brainwashing her that Mo Fan was an unforgivable assh*** who had killed many of her moths, little Moon Moth Phoenix was still very fond of him, since he was directly related to her rebirth and ensuing growth.

“You’re saying that Evil Star still has a certain sense of reason. It will bring the Manta Ray Evil Birds away?” Mo Fan exclaimed after hearing a tiny voice whispering into his head.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix was obviously an expert at Psychic Magic. She was talking to Mo Fan with a unique method.

“I don’t think it’s that easy. They can’t possibly fly back to Dawn Island from here. It will place too many cities on alert,” Tangyue shook her head. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Councilman Nan was truly an assh*** to transport them here,” Zhao Manyan swore with feeling.

A sudden idea crossed Mo Fan’s mind. “We are pretty close to the Qinling Mountains. I wonder if the Qinling Horde is going to ignore them?”

“Are these creatures that normally lived in the sea going to be fine at the Qinling Mountains?” Tangyue wondered.

“They are amphibious. I don’t think living in the Qinling Mountains would be any problem for them... Not long ago, Zhang Xiaohou told me that even though the Silver Skyruler did not claim the throne of the Emperor of Feathers, it has started to gather the aggressive species of the Winged Beasts. We can arrange for these Manta Ray Evil Birds to move to the Qinling Mountains and keep the Silver Skyruler at bay,” Mo Fan proposed.

“That might work, as these demon birds are strong and savage. They won’t let other species rule over them once they move to the Qinling Mountains. It might alleviate a potential crisis from the Qinling Mountains for some time,” Tangyue agreed.

“It’s decided. I’ll contact Zhang Xiaohou and let him know. Little Moon Moth Phoenix, can you guide Evil Star to the Qinling Mountains?...” Mo Fan asked little Moon Moth Phoenix.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix shook her body happily. She seemed very pleased with Mo Fan’s arrangement.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix had already communicated with Evil Star briefly when they were still at Yu Shishi’s. Evil Star knew Dawn Island was no longer suitable for them due to the small area. The Qinling Mountains were massive, and were more than enough for the demon birds to do whatever they wanted.
