It was winter. The plum trees on the mountain had blossomed. Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were strolling along the path between the trees. They could not help but recall the incident in the Sacred City.

Mo Fan felt there was a delay in his state of mind. Whenever something with great impact happened, he would carry on with his life or put all his attention on something else. When he finally relaxed, the impact of the incident would hit like a tide, bowling him over mentally.

“You’ve improved a lot in this month,” Mu Ningxue told him.

“You too,” Mo Fan replied in kind.

Mo Fan was improving quickly because of Little Loach. It had evolved again after they returned from the Sacred City, greatly speeding up Mo Fan’s cultivation rate. At this rate, he might be able to upgrade another Element to the Super Level!

Mo Fan had a feeling it would happen in the next few days, too.

To Mo Fan’s surprise, Mu Ningxue’s cultivation had improved a lot as well!

Mo Fan had been very efficient because of Little Loach’s help, but he noticed Mu Ningxue’s cultivation speed was almost on par with his.

Mo Fan had to look after seven Elements, but Mu Ningxue only needed to focus on two. It was possible that her Wind and Ice Elements had both reached the second tier of the Super Level!

“Sister Qin seemed to know her life was coming to an end. She gave me something when we were stuck in the scar on Tianshan Mountain. It’s been very useful to me,” Mu Ningxue said.

“I see. Can you fully control the bow now?” Mo Fan asked her.

“Not yet, it’s a lot more powerful than I thought, and for some reason, I have a strange feeling about it,” Mu Ningxue answered.

“Strange feeling?” Mo Fan did not understand.

“When you were fighting Xing Hui, Sister Qin told me something. She said the Mu Clan hasn’t used any extreme measures against me because they are still using me to raise the Ice Crystal Bow. Once the Ice Crystal Bow is completed, they will take it away at all costs!” Mu Ningxue explained with a worried face.

“Don’t worry, no matter how powerful the Mu Clan is, they can’t do whatever they want in this country. I won’t let them hurt you when the time comes!” Mo Fan promised.

“Mm,” Mu Ningxue nodded. In the past, she would think Mo Fan was just comforting her with some meaningless words. She knew exactly how powerful the Mu Clan was. The top clans in the country were not as simple as they looked!

But now she believed him. She knew taking on the Mu Clan alone was far-fetched. She was no longer as lost and afraid with Mo Fan around.

As they were walking, Mo Fan noticed a few couples around them. They were also taking a stroll in the beautiful mountain while enjoying the warmth of the sunlight and a private time with their beloveds.

They approached Yu Shishi’s territory as they ventured deeper into the woods.

No outsiders were allowed here. The mystical moths were hostile toward outsiders, not to mention there was now a Totem Beast looking after the woods!

The little cub sensed Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue’s presence from far away. She ran over to them like a white piglet who had just escaped from its pen.

The little cub was fond of Mu Ningxue. She came up to Mu Ningxue like she was begging for hugs.

Mu Ningxue was not interested in her at all, and kept walking forward. The little cub had no choice but to crawl up on Mo Fan’s head and lie there like a tiger cub hat. Her round eyes kept staring at Mu Ningxue.

“You drooling cub, did you already eat all the food in the pen where the pigs are kept? How much weight did you put on?” Mo Fan reached his hand up to rub the little cub’s belly. He had a feeling her belly was about to fall off.

The little cub scratched Mo Fan’s head in an act of protest!

Mo Fan was visiting Yu Shishi’s hut for something very important. He was too focused on going to the Sacred City when he accepted her offer. Now that he had returned, he came to check on whether Yu Shishi had kept her promise. If she didn’t, he would turn into Zhou the Exploiter and ask the Research Union to arrest her for bewitching him!

“Ningxue is here too?” Yu Shishi called out.

“Yes, I came to take a look around. Where’s little Moon Moth Phoenix?” Mu Ningxue asked her.

The little Moon Moth Phoenix, her glow still unique, flew out of the room before Ningxue could finish. She seemed sleepy, as if she was in the middle of a nap, but landed happily on Mo Fan’s shoulder.

It was strange how the little cub was fond of Mu Ningxue, but Mu Ningxue was fond of the Moon Moth Phoenix, who was fond of Mo Fan instead!

“When Little Flame Belle is back, this place is going to turn into a kindergarten, and I’m the headmaster!” Mo Fan sighed.

Yu Shishi and Mu Ningxue both smiled. Mo Fan indeed had special ties with the Totem Beasts!

“Now that you mention it, where is your Little Flame Belle?” Yu Shishi asked him.

It would be lively with the little Moon Moth Phoenix, little tiger cub, and Little Flame Belle around. They would be chasing one another across the mountain!

“She’s in Greece with her mother. I’ll bring her back when I visit Xinxia to save Mu Bai, but it will have to wait until the duel is over,” Mo Fan said.

“Oh right, you have a duel with some guy from the Zu Clan! This Heaven-Inferior Earth Seed might come into handy,” Yu Shishi nodded, remembering.

“My Earth Element is still in the Advanced Level. I’ll have to rely more on my Lightning and Shadow Elements to defeat Zu Xiangtian,” Mo Fan sighed.

“You’re underestimating the Heaven Seeds and their four additional effects,” Yu Shishi said.

“Oh? Are Heaven Seeds really that impressive?” Mo Fan raised his brows.

It was difficult to tell how strong a Heaven Seed was, since not many Super Mages had one!

“A Heaven-Inferior Seed is already superior to a Soul-grade Seed, not to mention the four additional effects. Oh, yours is only a Heaven-Inferior Seed that hasn’t awakened its fourth effect. It only has three additional effects for now,” Yu Shishi informed him.

“Only three additional effects...” Mu Ningxue could not help but shake her head.

Look at them go, proving how nonchalant they can be...

A powerful Soul-grade Seed had only one additional effect! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan’s Heaven-Inferior Seed with three additional effects would basically grant him three Innate Talents. That was insane!
