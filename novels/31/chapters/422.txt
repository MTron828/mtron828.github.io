The teachers glanced at the Elemental Director of the Summoning School with puzzled looks. They did not understand why the Summoning School was even related to this.

“Well... from what I can recall, we did have someone called Mo Fan among the new students. I just received his details today,” said Yi Yuquan.

Bai Mei, Wei Rong, and Qian Kun burst out laughing. They all assumed that Yi Yuquan was joking with them.

“So you’re telling me that this kid is an Advanced Magician with three Elements?” said Wei Rong.

Bai Mei nodded too. The Advanced Magicians had all graduated from the school. There was no way Mo Fan would have reached such a high level.

“Take a look yourself, I still have the information in my phone,” Yi Yuquan unlocked his phone and gave it to the teachers.

The documents clearly stated that the student Mo Fan had transferred from the Summoning Element to the Fire Element, and it was approved quite recently.

Following this, the teachers exchanged glances with one another, before staring at the stage where Mo Fan was about to begin his next battle!

——

“Someone arrogant like you will have a hard time surviving in the main campus.” Liu Qian totally gave up on being friendly toward Mo Fan.

“Only those with average strength like you need to fawn upon the others. For me, if someone is not convinced of my strength, we’ll settle it with a fight,” Lunar-white Stars gradually appeared around Mo Fan as he spoke.

The Stars were fairly unique. The glow they emitted was different from the other Elements. The rays only flickered within a certain distance, as if they were protecting the area that belonged to them, aloof yet mysterious.

The Stars connected with one another. There were seven of them, rapidly combining into a slightly curved arc.

The line seemed to be tearing the space apart slowly, revealing the passage to another world. It eventually turned into a gap.

The crowd glanced at Mo Fan’s odd Spell with confused looks. The Summoning Element was extremely unfamiliar to many of them.

As the crowd was wondering how Mo Fan was going to continue with the battle, an intimidating howl was heard coming from the gap!

A strong gust of wind swept the dueling ground, and a beastly aura lingered in the surroundings.

Things like auras were not stoppable by the defensive barriers. The students immediately showed fear on their faces. Those who were rather knowledgeable could tell what it was straight away. It was the presence of a Warrior-level creature!

“Summoning... Summoning Element!” blurted out Wei Rong in astonishment.

A majestic wolf-like creature leapt out from the gap. Its body was covered in runes.

Its size was not enormous, but its physique seemed fairly slender, yet did not lack the presence of strength! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Its long hair drifted in the wind as its sharp claws penetrated the ground. The beast raised its handsome, fierce head.

The stare it was giving to Liu Qian seemed to be hinting that he was not a worthy opponent!

“Damn it, this kid has three Elements!” Wei Rong cursed in shock.

“Could this Mo Fan be the guy ranked fifth on the Innate Talent Leaderboard, the one with Double Innate Elements?” yelled Qian Kun.

“I believe so, but I thought he died during his exchange!”

The teachers were stunned.

They thought Mo Fan’s winning spree was about to come to an end, as the energy of his Fire and Lightning Element had depleted. However, when they saw the magnificent Swift Star Wolf, they had no choice but to reevaluate the possible outcome of the battle.

—

Among the crowd, many who were initially seated rose to their feet. Their eyes, which had almost popped out, clearly displayed their thoughts.

-What the heck is going on!?-

It suddenly felt like they had failed basic algebra!

Three...three Elements?

“Is this guy an Advanced Magician!?” screamed Huang Xingli.

“I finally recalled why his name sounds so familiar.” Ding Yuming’s eyes were fixed on Mo Fan.

“Who exactly is he?” said Huang Xingli.

“The person ranked fifth on the Innate Talent Leaderboard, Double Innate Elements. He used to be very popular in the Azure Pearl Campus. He single-handedly challenged all the students with only his Summoning Element, and was given the title, the Demon King,” said Ding Yuming with gleaming eyes.

As a matter of fact, Ding Yuming never cared about the things that took place at the Azure Pearl Campus. However, her sister was involved in the incident at the stadium. As she recalled that series of events, she remembered that the person who saved her was called Mo Fan.

Therefore, Ding Yuming had spent some time looking up information about Mo Fan. Unfortunately, a short time after he had exposed his Double Innate Elements, he had died during training, yet he had reappeared alive and well, and still as ruthless as usual!

—

On the stage, Liu Qian’s calm, confident look had disappeared.

F**k me!

He should be a lamp with its oil depleted. Where did his third Element come from!?

It would still be fine if he had only summoned an ordinary creature. Liu Qian was not easily intimidated by a Summoned beast. To his surprise, it was a Swift Star Wolf, which had a fairly outstanding lineage among the wolf species. This Summoned beast, which was well-known for his speed, was like an assassin to Magicians without defensive abilities!

ROAR~!

The Swift Star Wolf did not show any mercy to Liu Qian, quickly lunging at a terrifying pace.

The sharp claws danced wildly as they approached Liu Qian, forming a net of blades, trying to shatter everything in front of them into pieces!

Liu Qian was taken by surprise. He quickly summoned his shield equipment.

A round shield appeared in front of Liu Qian. The claws collided with the shield, generating piercing screeches.

Liu Qian was not satisfied with the situation. The shield equipment was more or less his final trump card, yet he was already forced to use it at the beginning. If he were careless in the battle, he would be severely injured by the beast.

Liu Qian had underestimated the Swift Star Wolf’s strength. It was no battle to begin with. The Swift Star Wolf utilized his outstanding speed to attack Liu Qian from different angles. The magic shield was unable to match the wolf’s speed!

Liu Qian tried to attack, but his Magic could not even touch the Swift Star Wolf’s hair, let alone inflicting any damage on him!

At that moment, Liu Qian found himself in a miserable situation!

With his strength, he could easily defeat a few ordinary Intermediate Magicians, yet a Swift Star Wolf that was troublesome for Intermediate Magicians was too much for him to handle.

The fight had turned into a one-sided victory!
