The blazing red flames continued to burn fiercely, the ocean of flames not disappearing so easily. Mo Fan’s opponent was an expert with the Plant Element. If he did not fight to control the stage, he would soon have no space to stand on.

The Sky-Flame Funeral did not inflict serious damage to Mochizuki Chihaya, but it did secure him the upper hand in the duel. At the very least it stopped the plants from attacking him as long as the flames were still around.

“Blood Tabi!”

Mo Fan knew he was up against a strong opponent. He did not conceal his strength further, and immediately summoned the Blood Tabi. The strength of the Blood Beast wrapped around his legs.

Mo Fan’s speed was already impressive after reaching the Advanced Level. After receiving the buff from the Blood Tabi, each of his steps was full of power, and left deep footprints on the ground.

He dashed toward Mochizuki Chihaya’s corner and leapt into the air when he was thirty meters away from her.

“Trample of the Blood Beast!”

Mo Fan immediately activated the main effect of the Blood Tabi and increased the force of his feet to thousands of kilograms. The stomp as he landed on the ground was comparable to the impact of a ten-meter-tall creature!

Mochizuki Chihaya reacted swiftly too. As her back was to the barrier, she immediately dodged to the side when she saw Mo Fan coming down from the sky.

Her movement was not as impressive as Mo Fan’s imperious stomp with the Blood Tabi. As Mo Fan landed heavily on the ground, the shockwave immediately knocked Mochizuki Chihaya flying.

Mochizuki Chihaya lost her balance in the air, yet she still managed to cast a spell as she was knocked flying and used two vines to catch her in the air.

Mo Fan was aware of his opponent’s intention when he saw two vines bursting out from the ground. He quickly pointed his finger in her direction. “Thunderbolt!”

Unlike the usual lightning strikes, Mo Fan purposely altered the path of the Thunderbolt. It was going from the ground into the sky!

A lightning bolt appeared right under Mochizuki Chihaya and struck her back accurately, like a purple-black dragon.

The lightning bolt was quite strong. Mochizuki Chihaya was struck by it before she could reach the ground. It blasted her higher into the air, and even made her spin in circles.

The blue magic armor that Mochizuki Chihaya was wearing protected her from the lightning. The blast knocked her over fifty meters into the air as lightning arcs spread across her body!

It was difficult for anyone to suddenly change their direction in mid-air, which was why many people tried to knock their opponents flying.

“Fire Burst!”

Mochizuki Chihaya was like target practice once she was knocked into the air. With Mo Fan’s accuracy, he could basically ignore her falling speed!

Mo Fan was very adept at casting Basic Spells. Knowing that a single Fire Burst was nowhere enough to penetrate his opponent’s defenses, he immediately summoned as many Fire Bursts as he could!

One Star Orbit after another appeared. Fireballs revolved around Mo Fan while floating in the air. More than ten balls of flame were floating beside Mo Fan in just a short period of time!

“Go!”

The Fire Bursts were fired simultaneously along a clear trajectory in the air and landed close to Mochizuki Chihaya.

The Fire Bursts exploded close to her. Although the explosion of each fireball only had a radius of two meters, when all the fireballs exploded simultaneously, the area was quickly devoured by the flames coming from all direction. Mochizuki Chihaya was left with no escape, the flames lunging at her blue magic armor.

Mo Fan had to admit, his opponent’s blue magic armor was some high-quality stuff. It still did not disappear even after enduring so many attacks.

“Fiery Fist: Groundbreak!”

Mochizuki Chihaya finally fell back to the ground, yet Mo Fan had no intention of stopping there. He slammed his fist onto the ground to give Mochizuki Chihaya a taste of an exploding Groundbreak right after she was struck by more than ten consecutive Fire Bursts!

Burning lava washed across the place. Mochizuki Chihaya frowned. Water ribbons circled her. Mo Fan had no idea how the woman had cast the defensive Water Spell while she was blasted so rapidly by his spells. Perhaps she too was able to cast Basic Spells with a single thought!

The water ribbons stacked on her in layers. Mo Fan noticed there were at least six layers of Water Barriers on her. Even Zhao Manyan could only stack four layers of Water Barriers at most. Her control of the Water Element was clearly significantly better than his friend’s!

“How violent, I would have lost by now if I was in her spot!” Jiang Yu gasped after seeing Mo Fan’s chain of attacks.

Previously, Mo Fan basically had no chance to fight back against Mochizuki Chihaya’s Plant Element, but now his spells had similarly given Mochizuki Chihaya no chance to find her footing. The two would not stop once they were given an opportunity to counterattack! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“She looks weak, yet her defense is harder than a turtle shell. Can she seriously still stand?” Mo Fan panted heavily.

It was a great burden mentally to cast spells continuously. Mo Fan had no choice but to rest up. Otherwise, it was likely that he would fail to channel the spells properly.

Mochizuki Chihaya was in a tough spot, too. She quickly withdrew to a safe spot and cast Water spells on herself.

The burning effect of the flames and the scorching of the lightning were a nuisance, especially how she was knocked flying a few times in the air and was devoured by the lava bursting out from the ground. Luckily, she kept applying layers of Water Barriers to herself, or her armor would have passed its limit by now.

The combination of Fire and Lightning Elements was indeed overwhelming. Most magic armor could only survive a few rounds against them.

“Rise!”

Mochizuki Chihaya was able to recover faster than Mo Fan. She took off her defensive equipment, which had basically lost its effect, and began to control the plants again.

Half of the flames of the Sky-Flame Funeral had disappeared. Mochizuki Chihaya started casting a spell.

She waved her hand in Mo Fan’s direction. Mo Fan caught a glimpse of a faint gray-blue flicker of motion.

Mochizuki Chihaya’s action and the flicker felt familiar to Mo Fan, yet before he could recall what they were, a huge gap was torn apart on the ground before him. The crack was five meters long, and a terrifying vine burst out from it. It was as thick as the trunk of a thousand year old tree.

Most terrifyingly, the vine was incredibly flexible. It could twist as it wished while attacking with the strength of a beast!

Mo Fan immediately retreated when he sensed something did not feel right. To his surprise, the vine was quicker than he was. It struck him hard, and knocked him flying into the air.
