-Nineteenth zone, nineteenth zone, where the Hell is the nineteenth zone?-

The whole place was a vast expanse of whiteness because of the mist, and Mo Fan couldn’t find the right direction. He never stopped cursing under his breath.

The Swift Star Wolf was a terrestrial creature. His fur was soaking wet from the moisture, looking like a drowning dog. It felt like the creature had lost his dignity as a wolf after losing his handsome fur. He was low-spirited, and the raw briney smell was hindering his nose, too.

“Hey, buddy, is this the right way to the nineteenth zone?” Mo Fan quickly ran forward and asked when he saw a person standing on a roof.

Only a weirdo like Mo Fan would ask for directions in the middle of a battle.

The man turned around and spoke with a deep voice. Mo Fan could not tell what language it was.

“I can’t hear you, can you speak louder... f**k me!” cursed Mo Fan, who quickly dodged aside.

A poisonous tongue flew right at him with outstanding force. He could feel the strong airflow as it went by. The tongue would likely smash the bones in his face to pieces if it landed!

No wonder Mo Fan was cursing non-stop, these sea monsters were just too cunning! He had already stumbled into a creature that disguised itself as a building while spitting out white silk, and now, another one was disguising itself as a human in the mist.

The creature’s silhouette resembled a human, but its body was covered in scales. Its joints had bones like shark fins. It had a flat mouth, similar to a shark, taking up two-thirds of its face, housing that poisonous tongue!

Mo Fan grimaced in disgust knowing that he had stumbled into a sea monster while only asking for directions.

The Fierce Shark Demon was ranked highly in terms of savagery among the sea monsters. Normally, Mo Fan would have the urge to pluck all its fangs and used them for decoration purposes, yet he was not in the mood today!

The Fierce Shark Demon’s mouth was full of blood. Mo Fan caught a glimpse of a torn garment between the gap of its teeth. It seemed like the creature had just enjoyed a pleasant meal. Not a single bone was left, he was wondering which Magician had fallen victim to it...

“I’m not going to beat you up, so you better not trouble me, let’s mind our own business,” Mo Fan stared at the Fierce Shark Demon alertly. His instincts were telling him that the creature was not an easy opponent.

Mo Fan slowly navigated around the creature to proceed on his way.

The Fierce Shark Demon was watching Mo Fan. Judging from the twitch of its facial muscles, it seemed to be grinning. The grin was just as its name suggested, scarily fierce!

“Eat this!” Mo Fan made his move, taking the initiative to attack without waiting for the Fierce Shark Demon’s response. He did not need to summon the flames before the attack, as his fist simply erupted in flames as he was swinging his arm through the air!

Mo Fan would be out of his mind if he believed the creature would let him go easily. The blazing flame on his right hand was as strong as usual despite the moisture in the air. The sparks immediately spread into their surroundings and set the area on fire.

The Fierce Shark Demon was totally unprepared, and was blasted a great distance away. It slammed into the building on the other side of the street and fell into the water.

Lucky for the creature, the street was flooded by the tide. Otherwise, it would have suffered greatly from the prolonged burning of the Rose Flame!

Mo Fan immediately continued on his way after taking care of the obstruction.

The whole place was surrounded by sea monsters. Heavens knew if the creature would return with its tribe to get revenge!

—-

Mo Fan had made a smart decision. Not long after he left, a few shark heads popped out of the water, exposing their grinding fangs above the surface of the water.

They glanced around, searching for the shameless Magician, yet the man was already long gone. They had no choice but to snap their jaws at the buildings to vent their frustration.

Mo Fan was feeling nervous. How had the sea monsters invaded the East Maritime Fortress so quickly? The whole place was already full of them!

How many sea monsters did the huge tide bring to the fortress? He had no idea how much time they would need to slay all the sea monsters.

“Please tell me I’m moving the right way?” Mo Fan had totally lost his directions. His surroundings were covered in the mist. The visible range was only two hundred meters.

The buildings on every street looked incredibly similar without any landmark that stood out among them. Mo Fan was afraid to be told that he was in the twenty-first zone when he finally saw a human.

“It seems like there’s someone ahead...” Mo Fan finally saw some light produced by spells in the mist.

There was no way the figure was a sea monster, since it was visibly casting spells. Mo Fan immediately quickened his pace and went after the light.

The buildings shook underneath him. Mo Fan felt uneasy as soon as he started running toward the light. As he proceeded further, he realized that the mist was not as strong in the area, most likely because the Light Magicians were trying to drive the mist away...

Mo Fan immediately went over to where the people were after the visibility improved.

——

Loud vibrations were buzzing in the ears. Mu Ningxue knelt down and hid inside a building.

The building was basically empty, there was no windows or doors. She was able to see the street easily, and a monster with four spiky arms moving along it.

The main street was a lot wider, the buildings on both sides were up to a hundred meters apart, but there were not many Magicians around, as a Commander-level creature had appeared!

Blue Valley Ferocious Beast!

Mu Ningxue recognized the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast. It was one of the two that the team encountered before in the nineteenth zone.

Likewise, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast had also recognized Mu Ningxue. Five minutes ago, Mu Ningxue had finally found the trail of the White Sobbing Demon, but when she turned a corner, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was inches from her face. Luckily, the Night Rakshasa reacted in time and scratched out the single eye on the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s face. Otherwise, Mu Ningxue’s life would have been in danger.

The Night Rakshasa was injured after it was hit by the spikes on one of the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast arms. There was a clear bleeding cut on the Night Rakshasa’s chest.

“Are you alright?” Mu Ningxue blamed herself. If she wasn’t so occupied with the White Sobbing Demon, she would have avoided stumbling into the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast had obviously sniffed her out. It was waiting for her so it could get its revenge.

The first appearance of the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was here in the nineteenth zone, but it had now appeared in the same zone once again. It was hard to tell what the creature was up to...

“Meow!”

The Night Rakshasa licked her paw, before placing it on the cut. Soon, the cut stopped bleeding.

“That’s a relief!” Mu Ningxue let out a relieved sigh after seeing that the little cat demon was fine.
