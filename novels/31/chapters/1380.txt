Chapter 1383 Hell Is Where They Deserve to Stay

Translated by XephiZ

“The endless cries of pain echoing across the sky will serve as the rites and music!

“The fresh blood pouring out from their bodies will serve as the fragrant wine!

“The limbs, organs, and skulls scattered on the ground will serve as the noblest carpet!”

An aged voice was coming from the pyramid. It was speaking in ancient Egyptian, yet everyone could understand what it was saying when they heard it. The voice struck the souls of people and echoed in their minds. Even after a long time, the fear it inflicted on them remained!

Who was talking!?

Was it using the living as the foundation for the opulent ceremony of its arrival!?

The voice echoed across the vast land. It finally faded away after a prolonged time, but the Squaretrek Plain surrounding the Great Pyramid of Giza suddenly became restless!

How terror-striking would the sight of a plain covering an area of over a hundred kilometers square trembling hard be? Figures engulfed in deathly auras were crawling out from the cracks and the thick layer of sand. They were bathed in the ghostly light of the pyramid, giving them an absolutely eerie and spooky appearance!

The number of undead continued to increase. The black rings surrounding the enormous pyramid kept expanding. They were like boiling black tides gathering toward the pyramid, competing for a glorious spot close to the pyramid so they could pay their respects and obeisance to it. Their fanaticism was beyond insane!

“I love the desert. Go, crush the bones of every living creature on this land into sand, and build me a desert!”

The same voice appeared. The aged, imperious, and disdainful voice immediately drove every undead that had woken up crazy! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

-That’s right, our king loves the desert. This place is nowhere enough. We need more bones and more blood, and after years of work, it will finally settle into a brilliant gold.-

The ground and the sky shook vigorously. The creatures of the Underworld devoured the valley and started advancing south!

Most terrifyingly, the cracks, ravines, and fissures across the valley formed by the weight of the pyramid had flattened again. The undead were using their bodies to fill them up! Their filthy, twisted, and disgusting bodies were woven together, while the others simply walked over them, crushing their heads and flattening their arms...

It looked like a vast, squirming black land!

It was not difficult to imagine what would happen if a living creature happened to fall into it...

Up on the mountain, the Cold Prince was still laughing out loud. His purple eyes were glittering madly, just like the creatures of the Underworld, driven by a strong bloodlust!

“This day has finally arrived!” Unas stood slightly behind the Cold Prince. She was staring at the Great Pyramid of Giza with mad devotion.

The huge bloke, Tall Sparrow, stood at the side. Even as a Super Mage, he was afraid after seeing the creatures of the Underworld surging in their direction.

“Are we going to be fine here?” Tall Sparrow asked.

“Don’t worry, I’ve made a deal with him!” the Cold Prince smiled.

“Yeah, but we didn’t let him down like Izisha did,” Unas said.

“Raise your heads and look at this, too!” the Cold Prince said mercifully to the disciples kneeling on the ground behind him.

Unas and Tall Sparrow were just a step behind the Cold Prince. They were clearly his trustworthy subordinates.

A few steps behind them were the Seven Ghosts, in order from orange to violet.

The Chief Extraditor, Crimson Ghost, was not around. There was no way he would miss out on the ceremony normally. The status of the Chief Extraditor was not much lower than a Red Cardinal in the Black Vatican.

Behind the Seven Ghosts were the Blue Deacons!

Every Blue Deacon, including Mo Fan, was kneeling two hundred meters away from the Cold Prince. There were more than a hundred of them.

Not every Blue Deacon was taking part in the ceremony. There were clearly more present than the normal number of Blue Deacons under a Red Cardinal.

The rest of the members had evacuated to somewhere safe. If their numbers were too high, they could not guarantee that the creatures of the Underworld could still withhold the urge to target them and tear them to pieces. As a result, there were only the hundred-plus Blue Deacons, the Seven Ghosts, the two Exarchs, and the Red Cardinal, the Cold Prince!

These people were the core members of the Cold Prince’s faction!

—

Mo Fan slowly lifted his gaze. He looked past the Blue Deacons, the Seven Ghosts, the two Exarchs, and stared at the Cold Prince’s back!

To Mo Fan’s surprise, the Prince was a skinny and petite figure. There was no way he would think that person was a Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican if he was to walk past him on normal days.

Mo Fan did not see the Cold Prince’s face, but he was surprised to hear how young the Red Cardinal sounded.

Was it possible that the Red Cardinal was actually still that young?

The overwhelming presence of the undead swept over them. They immediately felt suffocated. Mo Fan had witnessed the same scene of the sky darkening before, yet he still felt like his head was about to explode when he experienced it again!

In the middle of the tide of undead that was surging forward, the sacred pyramid stood firmly in the limelight with its awe-inspiring appearance!

The inevitable had occurred, yet it was hundred, even a thousand times scarier than he had imagined. How gruesome would it be when these creatures from the Underworld invaded human cities?

Meanwhile, the people that had Summoned these creatures were celebrating their perfect ceremony passionately, extremely proud of their work. They might be humans, but they had completely lost their identities as people. They were filthier, uglier, and worse than those creatures of the Underworld, once they took their skins off!

The sight of the undead surging forward like a tide was a tremendous blow to Mo Fan’s heart. He was previously overwhelmed by grief, knowing what was going to happen, yet as his belief in human nature was trampled once again, all the emotions he felt turned into an inextinguishable fury burning and spreading inside his chest...

He had the urge to deliver them all to Hell, since it was the only place they deserved to stay!
