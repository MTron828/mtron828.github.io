Mo Fan returned to his apartment at a casual pace. Apas was still playing around with her Plant Element, meaning that Mui Nujiao was still occupied, too.

Mo Fan pushed the door open and instantly saw a young woman wearing standing in front of the bar in Snoopy underpants and a loose T-shirt. She was not surprised when she heard the door open. She grabbed a bottle of fruit wine and tugged the pants thoroughly displaying her curves up. Her bottom even wriggled happily after it felt more comfortable.

“Jiaojiao, do you want to drink with me? My mentor is so annoying. He didn’t want to let me graduate with excellence. Unforgivable!” Ai Tutu called out.

“You either go shopping and eat or drink and sleep at home. There must be something wrong with the Pearl Institute’s system if you can graduate with excellence,” Mo Fan replied, admiring the pleasant view.

“Bullshit, I’m very hardworking... AH! Demon King, why is it you!?” Ai Tutu turned around in shock and saw Mo Fan was already sitting on the couch.

“This is my place. It’s been a while since I came back, so I came to check if my two canaries had brought other men back home,” Mo Fan shot back.

“Wait, aren’t you at Qinghai?” Ai Tutu looked at Mo Fan curiously.

“Qinghai? Why would I be in Qinghai?” Mo Fan was confused.

“Check this out! Did you already sneak back to the Magic City after committing such a detestable crime? That’s pretty quick of you,” Ai Tutu said.

“What do you mean by detestable crime? I have no clue what you’re talking about,” Mo Fan was struggling to keep up with Ai Tutu’s thoughts. He had no idea what she was rambling about.

Ai Tutu was rather confused, too. She quickly recalled something and ran to the dining table. She grabbed the newspaper and placed it in front of Mo Fan. “Take a look at it yourself, the whole city is signing a petition to take you down!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Take me down?” Mo Fan was extremely confused. He took the newspaper and began reading it.

He just finished the story when there was movement at the door. Apas and Mui Nujiao came in and changed into house slippers.

Mui Nujiao glanced at Mo Fan before looking at Ai Tutu. She rolled her eyes and said, “Tutu, what the hell are you doing?”

“What am I doing? Nothing, I just showed Mo Fan what he did!” Ai Tutu protested.

“Go back to your room and change!” Mui Nujiao sighed.

“AH!” Ai Tutu only then realized what she was wearing. She glared at Mo Fan and shouted, “Assh***, jerk!”

“Hey, how is it my fault? It was you who stayed around for so long in that outfit. I was being kind enough by not pointing out how fleshy you are. Look at Jiaojiao, look at Apas, and look at you...” Mo Fan criticized without mercy.

“AHHHHH, I’m going to kill you!” Ai Tutu pounced at Mo Fan like an enraged kitten.

Mui Nujiao immediately stopped her and herded her back to her room.

“Right, Jiaojiao, take a look at this, what the hell is going on?” Mo Fan handed the newspaper to Mui Nujiao.

Mui Nujiao did not even look at the newspaper. She said, “I only learned about this not long ago too, so I came back with Apas straightaway. You were clearly busy Awakening your new Elements when the incident at Qinghai took place. How could you possibly be responsible for it?”

“I was wondering if I had somehow learned the Shadow Clone Jutsu,” Mo Fan smiled.

“Let me handle it. I’ll ask Uncle Guo Liyu to testify that you were with him when the incident happened,” Mui Nujiao said.

“That won’t be necessary, I don’t want too many people to know that I’ve reached the Super Level,” Mo Fan stopped her.

Mo Fan needed more time to cultivate after reaching the Super Level. If more people learned that he had reached the Super Level, it would surely bring him a lot of trouble!

“True, you have a lot of enemies. They will realize how much of a threat you have become if they learn you are now a Super Mage...” Mui Nujiao nodded.

Many of the renowned clans would not treat Mo Fan seriously before he became a Super Mage, nor would they bother sending their elders to deal with him. However, that was no longer the same after Mo Fan reached the Super Level. The renowned clans would now no longer hesitate to pick on Mo Fan just because he was affiliated with the national team, nor would they care about their seniority...

Mo Fan did not want to disclose the news about him reaching the Super Level so soon. He wanted to wait until his cultivation of the Super Level was stabler.

“Speaking of which, there was a similar incident two months ago, too. The government official in charge of the area happens to be a distant relative of our clan. He knew we were working closely with Fanxue Mountain, so he helped to suppress the news,” Mui Nujiao told Mo Fan after she recalled something.

“What happened?” Mo Fan asked suspiciously.

“It was a small ore vein. Apparently, you brought a few of your friends to exterminate the demon creatures in it, but you ended up attracting another species of demon creatures there. The ore vein that was supposed to multiply the economy of the town turned into a den for demon creatures. The military had to send more men to defend the town. It was to the north of the Dongting Lake,” Mui Nujiao said.

“I’ve never been to the north of the Dongting Lake,” Mo Fan stated firmly.

“You haven’t?” Mui Nujiao was surprised.

“No, I went to the Thousand Islands Lake after coming back from Greece, then I went to Fanxue Mountain, then the Qinling Mountains after that. I came straight to the Magic City after coming back from the Qinling Mountains,” Mo Fan related.

“That’s strange. I thought you, Zhao Manyan, and the others messed up, so we stopped the news from spreading by compensating them for the loss,” Mui Nujiao said.

“Why didn’t you tell me about it?” Mo Fan wondered.

“Your whereabouts have always been unpredictable. It’s very difficult to find you,” Mui Nujiao answered promptly.

“True... but I’ve never done anything like that, including polluting the East Side Lake in Qinghai,” Mo Fan informed her.

Mui Nujiao thought for a while. She glanced at the news and asked, “What if someone is impersonating you?”

“Obviously. At the very least, someone is using my name while doing these things!” Mo Fan agreed.

“It only happened during the last few months, never in the past. Why were they impersonating you? The incident in Donghai got a lot of attention. Even the media was spreading the news. If you don’t explain yourself to the public, many people are going to find trouble for you,” Mui Nujiao warned him.

“I know, I’ll clear my name!” Mo Fan sighed.

“Perhaps someone is purposely defaming you?” Mui Nujiao suddenly guessed.

Mo Fan was startled. He did not think it was possible at first, but now that he thought about it, especially after recalling the guy who was impersonating him in front of the Pearl Institute, that was very likely to be the case!

“Help me search the news in other places and see if there are any similar incidents,” Mo Fan asked her.

“Sure!” Mui Nujiao agreed.
