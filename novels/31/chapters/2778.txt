Chapter 2779: Summoning The Lycoris Sorceress Queen

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

To Mo Fan’s amazement, he entered the Dark Plane in spirit form. The demon cave, ghost mountain, corpse valley, dark forest, and dead land were like a part of a scroll. The scroll unfolded swiftly and revealed the sprawling world. Mo Fan saw various creatures inhabiting the Dark Plane.

‘Does this mean I can summon creatures from the Dark Plane?’ Mo Fan asked himself with delight.

“Mo Fan, hurry up. Sh*t! Our team is scattered. D*mn it! Night Rakshasa, come out now!” Mo Fan heard Jiang Yu’s voice.

Mo Fan ignored him. He believed Jiang Yu could protect himself. It had not been easy to open a new ancient magic portal. Mo Fan did not want to return to his world empty-handed.

The scroll of the world was still being unfolded. There were plenty of Dark Creatures roaming in the Dark Plane. Mo Fan noticed a familiar creature. He saw the guard of the King of Darkness—Dark Sword Master.

Dark Sword Master was within Mo Fan’s list of summoning creatures. He was tempted to summon it. But Dark Sword Master was a low-level Ruler. Thus, it might have difficulty coping with the battle.

Mo Fan continued his search. He crossed a tall, dark mountain and found a palace with a dozen Dark Sword Masters standing guard. The palace was pale white, and it looked eerie and scary. The isolated palace on top of the mountain gave off a mysterious feel.

Mo Fan’s spirit stayed at this place. He wondered who owned the black palace and who the Dark Sword Masters were guarding. A woman walked out of the palace from between its majestic pillars.

The woman’s black mermaid dress covered her long legs. Mo Fan could not figure out how she actually walked. However, beautiful flowers bloomed under her feet as she moved, but withered rapidly as she passed.

Those flowers were lycoris! They were stunning and left an unforgettable impression. Mo Fan stared at the woman in the black mermaid dress in the middle of the lycoris. He was awed by her elegance and beauty. But he found her to be familiar.

She was the Lycoris Sorceress Queen!

She was the same powerful sorceress queen who had become the King of Darkness’s pawn in the past, just like Mo Fan. She had survived the game and had slightly transformed. Her appearance was no longer just a cloud of black mist. Instead, she was three-dimensional now.

The Lycoris Sorceress Queen stood in front of the palace. She raised her head and stared at Mo Fan’s spirit. She recognized him. However, she was puzzled to see him in such a form. He looked like a spirit shadow reflected from another plane. She saw him but could not touch him. He lacked the life force of the creatures in this realm.

...

“Mo Fan, you scum! I might not be able to cover for you much longer!” Jiang Yu shouted. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A large group of Lizard Demon Dragons had surrounded him. Besides, the Hunter Dirty Demon and Blue-scaled Skin Beasts were swarming them. There were many high-level Ocean Demons among them, and the Ocean Demons had broken his and the other Royal Mages’ formation.

Two of the three Royal Mages had reunited with the Guards of the Four Directions. However, Li Que was trapped in a basin five hundred meters away from them. Jiang Yu and Mo Fan were surrounded by Ocean Demons. Night Rakshasa and the Skeleton Dragon were slaughtering the Ocean Demons, but they could not keep up with the growing number of the creatures that charged towards them.

Jiang Yu cussed at Mo Fan. However, he did not leave him. With Night Rakshasa around, he could hold out for a little longer. But if they did not move and catch up with the rest, they could die trapped within the Ocean Demon troop. Regardless of how strong Night Rakshasa was, it could not possibly kill all the Ocean Demons by itself.

“Help me! Save me! Hurry up!”

Jiang Yu heard Li Que’s cry for help among the chaos. Jiang Yu wanted to help him, but he was powerless.

“Big Brother Li, hold on for a while longer. Hold on!” Jiang Yu shouted back at him.

“I’ve broken my leg. I don’t think I can hold much longer. You have to help me!” Li Que sobbed. He was terrified.

The Lycoris Sorceress Queen flattened the mountain. She wiped out everything whenever she passed by. There was nothing that she could not destroy.

When Jiang Yu realized that Li Que could die, he gritted his teeth. He gave his all to pave a path to him and saved Li Que from the basin.

“Night Rakshasa, hurry up!”

Night Rakshasa killed the Ocean Demons to pave a path towards Li Que. However, the Ocean Demons soon swarmed and covered the path.

The Skeleton Dragon stood between Mo Fan and Jiang Yu. It was covered with Lizard Demon Dragons. Whenever the Skeleton Dragon shook its body, it flung most of the Lizard Demon Dragons away from it. However, a dozen skeletal bones dropped simultaneously from its body.

The Skeleton Dragon was no longer as domineering as it had been in the beginning under the endless Ocean Demons’ siege. It could disintegrate anytime if it continued to exhaust its energy.

Jiang Yu bit the bullet to protect Mo Fan. He assigned Night Rakshasa to save Li Que. They were caught up in a desperate situation…

Mo Fan finally opened his eyes. His eyes looked a little eccentric.

“D*mn it! You finally awaken. We are so dead!” Jiang Yu cried out.

The Black Totem Snake had left them far behind. Even though the Supreme Ruler could wipe out everything, it could not possibly get back to them past the vast Ocean Demons army at such a short notice. Besides, the Purple-haired Female Demon kept it busy.

The Guards of the Four Direction, Deputy Royal Guard, and the Royal Great Mages were ahead of them. They almost found a way out as they brutally fought the Ocean Demons.

Mo Fan opened the ancient magic portal. A group of Blue-scaled Skin Beasts charged at them and trapped them in place. All of them were now scattered. Mo Fan had taken much longer time in summoning his creature.

“Don’t panic. I’ve summoned a great helper.” Mo Fan gave Jiang Yu a smile.

Jiang Yu was a loyal friend. He had refused to abandon Mo Fan even in such a desperate situation.

“Yeah right! Not unless you can come up with another totem beast!” said Jiang Yu.

Mo Fan just smiled. The ancient magic portal opened once again. Instead of various strange, dark characters on top of the portal, it was covered with slender dark vines. Lycoris bloomed radiantly in red as the vines spread, radiating a dark and ice-cold beauty.

The flowers spread like a red carpet to welcome the queen.

The Lycoris Sorceress Queen entered regally. Her legs were hidden from view. However, she glided on the lycoris petals like a spirit with an air of elegance and nobility suited to a Dark Creature. The Lycoris Sorceress Queen’s terrifying aura flooded the chaotic battlefield like a rainstorm!
