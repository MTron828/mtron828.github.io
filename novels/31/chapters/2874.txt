Chapter 2875: The Ocean Queen (2)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

What was bound to come had arrived.

After Ding Yumian had vanished, the faded Ocean Undead were assumed to make a comeback. People had lived in dread for this day.

The true queen of the Ocean Undead was someone else. The evil spirit in Ding Yumian was just one of the many insignificant conquerors.

The incoming red desert looked as if it could destroy everything.

The sound of weeping, whimpering, and roaring rang. The Undead’s roar was torture. The Magic City was already severely damaged, it couldn’t face another wave of Undead army. Even if they managed to defeat all the enemies, could the Magic City recover from this?

The place where the Undead had trampled became lifeless. The Magic City’s source of life was water. It had a flat and fertile land. But the ocean had flooded the city. The Undead wanted to invade the land. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The people of Magic City had not seen the ultimate judgment day. They were scared.

In the middle of the red desert, the skeletons covered in red, long veils traversed in the air and approached the Cold Moon Demon Lord.

One of the skeletons was cloaked in white veil. Its white veil was covered by cobwebs, but the red skeletons appeared noble in it. The female skeleton laughed like a woman, but its laughter was shrill and eerie.

It was as if she had already taken down the Magic City. Humans were meant to be defeated in this war from the beginning.

If humans could not defend the war by the coastline that spanned up 20,000 kilometers, it would be the same as surrendering the city, filled with resources, to the enemy. The Ocean Godly Horde would then expand the resources rapidly and become the world’s ruler.

If the humans fought back, there would be an increased number of deaths. Carcasses, corpses, and blood served as the Undead’s breeding ground. The Ocean Godly Horde had granted the Ocean Undead a noble status. The Ocean Demon would no longer wander under the dark ocean.

The Royal Skeleton Queen rose to the same height as the Cold Moon Demon Lord. Its Undead army had reached the Lu Family’s Mouth. The difference between the Ocean Undead and the Ocean Demons was that all the Ocean Undead were covered in bones, without any flesh. They were mostly made up of fish bones and the sharp parts from the demonic beasts such as their claws, sharp tail, sword fin bones, external and internal teeth, etc.

These were what made up the Ocean Undead army. Hence, the Ocean Undead army looked like an empire made of blades. They looked like red live weapons. There were too many of them. It was horrific.

“We have more enemies.” President Hong Wu was exhausted. So were the other members of the Forbidden Curse Association.

They had given their all in fighting the powerful Ocean Demons. The Azure Dragon and the five totem beasts had slightly made a difference in the outcome of the battle in their favor.

But in the end, the Ocean Demon army they had been fighting was just part of the Ocean Godly Horde. The Ocean Undead Empire was far more powerful. The Salamanders and Shell Demons were scrawny compared to them!

Pudong was flooded with the red Undead army. The humans had been fighting the Ocean Demons over the years. The carcasses and corpses in the past battles had become the fuel with which the Royal Skeleton Queen made its Undead army.

“Why do you have to fight back so hard? You will still end up dead and defeated before me.” The Royal Skeleton Queen let out a shrill laugh.

It had been living under the ocean for countless years. All the living creatures in the world would end up becoming skeletons sooner or later. Hence, it did not have to summon a single soldier or cast an Undead spell. After all, the fact of the matter was that living creatures died at one point and then they would belong to the Royal Skeleton Queen.

Thus, the Royal Skeleton Queen did not bother playing tricks in a war.

If need be, it would show its true power and unleash its massive army on the idiotic humans who assumed they were the ruler of the world.

“President Hong Wu, what’s its level?” the chief of the Eastern Mage asked.

The emperor-level Ocean Demons consisted of the Multicolored Demon King, Lan Demon Dragon, Demonic Ruins White Spider Emperor, the Lord of the Shark Man, the Salamander Emperor, and lots more. Still, none of them exuded a more imposing aura than the female Undead leader.

The female Undead was comparable to the Cold Moon Demon Lord. Perhaps it, too, was an evil spirit. If that was the case, this was a one-sided war. The Magic City would be utterly destroyed.

No one had ever survived in the Undead’s presence. The Undead were very sensitive toward the living. They were obsessed with transforming the living beings into their own kind!

“The Lord of Shara, the Extreme South Emperor, and the Bermudian Devil are the world’s three greatest emperors. There are ten emperors who have the power to dominate the world, and the Ocean Queen is one of them,” said Hong Wu.

The Ocean Queen had been a myth for a long time. But the Forbidden Curse Association members were aware of it and its group’s existence.

They lived in the depth of the ocean. They required a completely different living environment. Therefore, they were basically not considered much of a threat to humans. However, the Ocean Godly Horde had been in a Pacific War over the years, and this had strengthened the Ocean Undead. Moreover, their habitat had gradually expanded to the continents.

If only the humans knew that the Ocean Godly Horde had allied with the Ocean Undead, they would not have fought back. They would have saved their resources and moved to other places.

The powerful enemy appeared from the ocean one after another. The humans had just regained their confidence, only to fall into despair again. It was impossible to retreat.

“They can’t stay inside the refuge any longer. Have the officers transfer all the citizens inside the refuge to the Ding City,” said Councilman Gu in disappointment.

“There are still many Ocean Demons inside the city. The transfer process could…” Another councilman hesitated.

“The Undead itself is a virus. It can infect all the citizens within a very short period of time. Enough of questions and doubts. Do you want all the citizens of the Magic City to end up becoming the Ocean Undead?” said Councilman Gu.

“Got it.”

They could no longer stay in the city. The refuge with waterproof barrier, Forbidden Isolation, and hidden systems could not stop the Undead’s infection. The people inside the refuge would become Undeads sooner or later. If the Undead attacked the living humans, it would lead to casualties which couldn’t be cured. They would slowly turn into Undead themselves.

The Magic City was severely destroyed. The arrival of the Ocean Queen had further intensified the frightening aura.

Migration was the wisest decision. They had to abandon the city and flee.
