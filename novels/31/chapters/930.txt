Chapter 931: Killing Without Hesitation!

___Translated by XephiZ___

Edited by Aelryinth

The team was overwhelmed with fatigue after making their way out of the canyon filled with the Forbidden Moon Rock Demons.

It was not from overusing their magic, but the sense of relief after being on edge for so long.

“Mo Fan, what the hell happened?” asked Zhao Manyan immediately.

Nanrong Ni helped Mo Fan clean up his wounds. Mo Fan was as strong as an ox, and had not suffered any serious injuries. He was back up on his feet and full of energy after being treated by Nanrong Ni.

As soon as Zhao Manyan mentioned it, Mo Fan’s eyes emitted a murderous flicker as he glared at Lu Yilin, who started to feel uneasy.

“It’s really him?” asked Zhao Manyan when he sensed the strange reaction from Mo Fan.

“Humph, I feel like killing someone. You guys better not stop me.” Mo Fan slowly approached Lu Yilin.

Lu Yilin was already backing away. He never thought Mo Fan would be able to get out of the canyon alive. The pale expression on his face had already betrayed him.

“Lu Yilin, how could you do something like that!?” snapped Nanyu furiously.

Lu Yilin had not only set Mo Fan up, he almost got the whole team killed too. If something went wrong, wouldn’t the whole team have been wiped out here?

“I...I...you have no proof, how dare you accuse me? Is it just because of what he said!?” Lu Yilin quickly gathered his confidence, like he was never going to admit his wrongdoing.

Ai Jiangtu came up to Lu Yilin and stared at him with a dark face.

Lu Yilin knew what the consequences were if he admitted anything. He had already thought it through. Even if the others were suspicious of him, he would not admit it. Besides, only he and Mo Fan were there. He could blame it on Mo Fan for being too careless, and tried to blame it on him instead.

“Do you think denying it is going to help now?” Mo Fan was not merciful against someone like him.

A silver glow encapsulated Mo Fan’s figure. He lifted Lu Yilin up from the ground with his will and pushed him hard onto the wall of the cliff.

Lu Yilin cried out in pain after ramming into the wall.

“What are you doing!?” yelled Lu Yilin.

“You want me dead, so I want you dead, it’s as simple as that!” said Mo Fan coldly.

“Mo Fan, calm yourself, it’s best to report it to the advisors and let them handle it. We aren’t allowed to fight one another. I believe the advisors are going to punish Lu Yilin seriously for hurting his teammate,” Nanyu immediately stepped forward to intervene when she noticed Mo Fan was serious about killing Lu Yilin.

“Yeah, just let the advisors handle it. If you kill him now, the Lu Clan will trouble you instead. After all, even though he set you up, you managed to live, but if you kill him, everyone is only going to focus on what you’ve done,” Nanrong Ni also felt Mo Fan was being too impulsive.

Lu Yilin’s expression calmed down slightly when he heard the others trying to stop Mo Fan.

“Mo Fan, if you want to find yourself in huge trouble, just spare his petty life for now. Our Zhao Family will ask the Lu Clan to compensate you for what he has done. It’s better for you that way.” Even though Zhao Manyan was furious, he still told Mo Fan a more rational way of settling the dispute. It was unwise to kill Lu Yilin like this.

“Alright, I’m not going to kill him,” Mo Fan slowly let go.

Lu Yilin acted as if his life had just been spared. He quickly rose to his feet.

“If he can come out from the goddamned canyon like how I did, I’ll forgive him for what he did!” said Mo Fan coldly.

Lu Yilin had yet to look relieved when he was caught by a stronger force. The force struck his chest and knocked him flying instantly.

Lu Yilin happened to be flying into the orange-red canyon. Everyone was stunned when they saw it happen, as no one expected Mo Fan actually dare to do it!

“Mo Fan, please calm down!” Nanyu immediately tried to intervene when she realized that the situation was not right.

Zu Jiming and Li Kaifeng were fairly close to Lu Yilin, too. When they saw Mo Fan tossing Lu Yilin into the canyon, they immediately rushed forward with startled faces!

Mo Fan immediately set himself on fire. The pillars of fire soared into the sky as the whole place was set aflame by the Rose Flame and Calamity Fire. The intense heat stopped the three from moving any further ahead.

Mo Fan turned around and stared at Zu Jiming and Li Kaifeng, and Nanyu, who was more concerned about the general situation.

“If anyone dares to save him, I will treat them as my enemy. I won’t mind tossing you in there, too!” Mo Fan declared in an imperious voice, as he completely vented the anger stacked up inside his heart!

-What did they mean by “If he’s still alive, I shouldn’t be fussing about it?”-

He was only able to survive because of the experience he had from training, and situations of life and death. Otherwise, he would have died a horrible death in the canyon, and no one would have even care how he died!

Were they seriously asking him to forgive someone that tried to murder him?

-Sorry, I am no sacred man, nor am I tied to any faction!- DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan only understood one thing. He would never forgive anyone that tried to kill him!

The flames were so strong that Zu Jiming, Lu Yilin, and Nanyu couldn’t move. They could see Lu Yilin flying into the canyon through the raging flames.

As soon as he landed, he immediately awakened a new batch of Forbidden Moon Rock Demons. The cold, expressionless faces poked out from the walls.

Lu Yilin sat on the ground in disbelief, staring at the teammates at the exit across the canyon.

“Save me, save me, please save me!” Lu Yilin’s face was filled with terror. He used all his limbs to crawl toward the exit.

“Mo Fan, I was just joking with you, Mo Fan... you can’t kill me, my clan will never forgive you!” Lu Yilin was both furious and terrified as he screamed at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan stood at the exit and glanced at Lu Yilin who was moving slowly. He replied, all smiles, “I wasn’t trying to kill you. Didn’t I already mention, if you manage to make it out, I will forget everything that happened between us...”

Everyone shivered in fear when they saw Mo Fan calmly answering Lu Yilin’s despairing scream.

So this is how scary Mo Fan was when he was angry!

“AHHHH!!!!”

Not long after, a piercing cry of agony came out from the canyon. The team was not sure if his legs were being smashed, or his chest had been crushed after receiving a powerful blow. Either way, there was no chance Lu Yilin could survive in the canyon on his own.

Lu Yilin’s cries echoed through the canyon and up to the team. Everyone fell silent.

They did not feel sorry for Lu Yilin, as the narrow-minded idiot was the one that had started it all. Mo Fan was only returning the favor. However, they did not feel pleasant after seeing how Mo Fan insisted on taking revenge by his own method, instead of letting the advisors handle it.

“It’s going to feel great now, but once we go back to our country, you’re going to suffer the consequences!” Guan Yu harrumphed coldly. He totally disagreed with Mo Fan’s decision.

In his eyes, Mo Fan had made the dumbest decision. There were some people that he could not kill as he wished!

“You might think that a clan is absolutely enormous and terrifying, but it is nothing worth mentioning to me. You should be relieved that you didn’t do something as retarded as Lu Yilin did,” replied Mo Fan.

“If I was trying to set up you, you would be dead by now!” answered Guan Yu without backing off.

Guan Yu was a smart man. He would not do something so ridiculous when the team was still training. Speaking of which, how narrow-minded that Lu Yilin was, actually trying to kill someone on the team for something so insignificant between them! What an idiot, it might be better for the team now that he was dead, just so he would not do anything to put the team in danger again!

“Mo Fan, I’m really impressed, you seriously had the guts to kill him!” Zhao Manyan raised his thumb to Mo Fan.

If he was in Mo Fan’s shoes, he would surely demand lots of compensation from the Lu Clan. After all, as long as he was still alive, it was more important to get all the benefits he could from the Lu Clan. However, everyone had their own beliefs. Mo Fan was indeed impressive in his own way, having the guts to do the things that people normally would not do.

“I hope something like this won’t happen again on my team. Even if Mo Fan didn’t do it, I would not let someone like him stay on the team!” Captain Ai Jiangtu finally spoke up.

“Let’s move on, we’ve wasted too much time here,” said Jiang Shaoxu. She acted as if nothing had happened. She did not care about Lu Yilin’s death.

Even if a person like him did not die at Mo Fan’s hands, he would eventually die at someone else’s. Jiang Shaoxu did not understand why someone as retarded as Lu Yilin was able to join the national team!

Jiang Shaoxu moved closer to Mo Fan and asked him in a soft voice, “I was the reason that it all started. Should I help you take care of the Lu Clan?”

“No need. They are seriously out of their mind if they actually come and trouble me. I’m being very merciful by not going to their luxurious villas and demanding justice be served! What a shitty clan, raising a piece of trash like him!” replied Mo Fan.

Jiang Shaoxu smiled without saying anything further.

Lu Yilin was dead. Everyone had seen his corpse with their own eyes.

No one would go and retrieve his remains, since no one wanted to go back into the canyon.

Lu Yilin’s eyes were still wide open. Perhaps he was still troubled by how Mo Fan managed to come out of the canyon in one piece, and even more troubled about why he went and offended a violent devil who would simply kill without hesitation!

As the team proceeded on, the terrain became even flatter. Mo Fan discovered that the Essence Orb was showing a stronger reaction, implying that he was getting closer to the source of energy!

Nanyu held two devices in her hand and said to the team, “We should be able to see the ancient ruins after another four kilometers. The elemental reaction around here is getting stronger, especially the Wind and Lightning Elements...”

“Look, just ahead!” said Zhao Manyan, pointing forward.

The others immediately looked into the distance and saw a black tornado emerging from the ground and soaring into the clouds like a black dragon. Everyone subconsciously took a deep breath after witnessing the stunning sight!
