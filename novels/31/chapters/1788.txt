“I’m just speaking the truth! My strongest power is Petrify, but look at that thing! It’s already a rock, how am I going to turn it into a rock again? My Psychic Magic is useless against elemental spirits too!” Apas explained helplessly. She knew Mo Fan did not believe her at all.

The two reasons Apas gave were not completely unreasonable. Even if Mo Fan used the Contract to force her to fight when she was unwilling to do so, she would only do so half-heartedly. Not only would it fail to make any difference, it might damage the Contract, too!

Apas might even be hoping Mo Fan would use the Contract to force her to obey his words. It would damage the Contract, which meant her soul would not suffer serious injury even if she forcibly broke the Contract in the future.

“Mo Fan, my master can’t hold on for any longer,” Wen Xia reminded Mo Fan urgently.

“Give me some time,” Mo Fan scratched his head. How could he possibly fail to let the little demon follow his instructions? It seemed like he had been too kind to her in the past, and she now lacked some manners. “Let’s not waste our time here. Say, how can I convince you to lend us a hand?”

“Terminate the Contract!” Apas answered instantly.

“Wen Xia, I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do. Let’s hope we’ll meet again. I’m going to say the same thing again, as long as the mountains are still around...” Mo Fan let out a sigh.

“It’s fine, you’ve already done a lot for us.” Wen Xia did not force it either. Even though she had no clue how powerful the young woman was, the city could only accept its fate since Mo Fan had failed to convince her to help.

Wen Xia did not stay around any longer. The Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon had already left for the clock tower. Her master Xie Qinghua was guarding the clock tower, and was obviously struggling to fend off the fierce tide of demon creatures. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Apas saw Wen Xia leaving in disappointment before glancing at Mo Fan, who was now lying on the ground and resting. She twisted her lips and said, “Where is your sense of justice? Isn’t it worth it to trade the Contract for an Elemental Capital?”

“Didn’t you say you had no idea how to deal with the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon too?” Mo Fan asked in return.

Apas snarled, “I might not be able to deal with it myself, but I do have a plan!”

“What is it?” Mo Fan asked.

“The city is the least of my concerns. I won’t feel sad even if it’s destroyed!” Apas replied.

“Well, since there’s nothing we can do, we should leave this place first.” Mo Fan rose to his feet. He found that he was still trembling.

He had indeed done his best. He was suffering from serious injuries. If he was hit by the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon again, he was going to die for sure. Even if he wanted to risk his life, Apas would surely be against the idea. If her master died, her soul would be severely damaged, no different from dying herself.

Therefore, Apas was in a difficult spot. She wanted Mo Fan to suffer serious injuries, since it served him right for treating her like a slave, yet she did not want him to die!

“Aren’t you going to negotiate with me a little more, or observe the situation a little longer?” Apas began to panic when she saw Mo Fan was serious about leaving.

“There’s nothing to see here,” Mo Fan signaled Apas to lend him a hand.

“Oh.” Apas automatically helped Mo Fan to stand up properly.

At that instant, Mo Fan quickly reached his hand toward Apas.

Apas cried out in shock. She thought Mo Fan was going to harass her again, but instead noticed Mo Fan was holding a glowing brown object when she glared at him.

“You!” Apas pointed at Mo Fan angrily, her finger twitching.

“In our country, parents will keep their children’s red packets. I’m going to take these crystals you have collected. I bet I can sell them for a very high price if the noble successor of the Medusa is treating them so preciously,” Mo Fan squinted and placed the pieces of crystals into his Space Pocket.

“Ahhh, you assh***, I’m going to poison you to death!” Apas pounced forward and bit Mo Fan on the arm.

Mo Fan was not bothered at all, as if he was being bitten by a puppy.

“Speaking of which, what exactly are those things? You were asking my wolves to collect them. Do they have anything to do with the Mud Morphing Monsters’ ability to evolve so quickly after absorbing Mages?” Mo Fan asked Apas idly, while she was still hanging onto his arm.

Apas seriously had an urge to bite Mo Fan’s arm off, yet the Contract was already giving her a warning. She had no choice but to swallow her grudge.

Her eyes began to emit a golden, icy light. It was part of Apas’ nature as a Medusa... however, her snake’s eyes soon disappeared, since her power was completely useless against this man!

Apas seriously regretted things now. Why did she have to hang around Mo Fan in the first place? He might be an interesting man, but he was more poisonous than the Medusae!

“Give them back!” Apas demanded after she finally collected her thoughts.

“You were being naughty in the first place. I’m taking them as a punishment,” Mo Fan replied casually.

“They are very important to me!” Apas stated.

“Great! Go take care of that Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon, and I’ll consider giving them back,” Mo Fan said.

Apas almost broke her teeth from biting down too hard. She had finally gained the upper hand for once! Mo Fan had no way of forcing her to fight on his behalf, yet she was caught with her tail between her legs so soon!

“I told you I can’t do it. You can use the Contract to check if I’m lying,” Apas declared.

“You can control its lackeys,” Mo Fan said.

“It’s difficult to control Elemental Spirits!” Apas refuted.

“I don’t believe you don’t have other tricks up in your sleeves,” Mo Fan sniffed.

“I can’t use them yet, unless your Cultivation improves further. You’re only at the early stage of the Super Level. You’re weaker than an infant among the Ruler-level creatures. The Contract is still restricting my power. What do you want me to do?” Apas harrumphed coldly.

“You said you had a plan,” Mo Fan reminded her.

“I did!” Apas was extremely unwilling to admit it, yet she still spoke up when she recalled the crystals Mo Fan had taken away, “The elemental creatures have souls too, especially those at the higher levels. My Psychic Magic isn’t necessarily ineffective against them, but I need a medium for my Psychic Magic to reach its magic crystal...”

“How are you going to do that?” Mo Fan inquired lightly.

“It’s very simple. These creatures will absorb every strong Mage they come upon. We just need it to absorb the medium!” Apas said.

“I see. That’s great, you should let it absorb you now. Once you go inside its body, you’ll be able to use the Psychic Magic on it,” Mo Fan exclaimed.

Apas looked at Mo Fan coldly, like she was looking at a retard.

“I can’t let it absorb me. The energy in my body is too overwhelming. Once it absorbs me, it will turn into a terrifying monster that could easily raze half a province to the ground. Besides, I would only be half-conscious if I was stuck in its mud, so I might not be able to use my magic freely,” Apas snarled, shutting down that thought.

“What should we do, then? What you said is good for nothing!” Mo Fan humphed.

Apas kept staring at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was confused, but suddenly realized something after a while. He pointed at himself with wide eyes, “Are you asking me to be the bait?”

“You’re not baiting it, you will actually let it absorb you! Our minds are connected, so once you are absorbed, I’ll be inserted into the Black-Silver Armored Rock Demon’s body like a computer chip, too! It’s fine if you fall unconscious, I’ll take control and crush its mind!” Apas promised.
