Chapter 1812: Shameless In Your Own Way

Translated by XephiZ

“Fine, we’ll set out tomorrow morning to look for the Totem Beasts... I’ll ask if Mu Bai is free tomorrow. Maybe we can ask him to tag along,” Mo Fan said.

“I don’t want to be mocked by his expressionless face!” Zhao Manyan shouted.

“You didn’t get any benefits from the trip to the Pyramid. Isn’t it great that you now have two Super Mages to escort you and guarantee your safety?” Mo Fan pressed further.

“That does make a little sense. Assh*** Mu Bai, just you wait, I will reach the Super Level soon!”

“That’s settled, then. I thought it was something serious. It was only a matter of time until Mu Bai got the attention he deserves, since he’s already a Super Mage now. If you aren’t pleased with it, just find a luxurious nightclub and vent your frustrations instead of disturbing my sleep... Oh, you can try asking Ai Tutu and see if she’s feeling horny. The two of you might be able to do one another a favor!” Mo Fan closed the door and went back to sleep.

He was seriously worn out. Being a lab rat was more demanding than he had thought. He felt like his energy was completely depleted. He could not bother thinking about any Dark Material, four additional effects, Order Manipulation... he just wanted to enjoy a nice rest!

A pillow flew from the couch and landed heavily on Mo Fan’s door as soon as it was closed. Ai Tutu’s furious roar followed, “Demon king, do you want to die? Do you really take me as that kind of a woman!?”

“Ai Tutu, why are you eating still those? Aren’t you worried that you’re going to be as fat as a pig? I won’t even have an erection if you lie naked in front of me,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Ahhhhhh, the two of you should go to Hell. Die, you assh****!” Ai Tutu screamed. Her voice echoed down the corridor.

Zhao Manyan immediately escaped after he was done mocking the girl. He did not even consider Mo Fan’s suggestion. If he kept wasting his time on his pleasures, Mu Bai was seriously going to have a huge lead over him. He should focus on his cultivation for the time being. Otherwise, he would really feel like killing himself if he failed the breakthrough when he had the chance.

—

Mo Fan had no idea how many days he had slept. He only knew he had woken up in the middle of the night. He seemed a lot more energetic.

He left his room to grab some water and happened to see an alluring figure in a tight outfit and a thin nightgown sitting on the balcony. He could feel his blood rushing at the sight alone!

“Mo Fan?” the figure on the balcony asked after becoming aware of his wolvish passionate gaze.

“Ugh, it’s me. Why weren’t you focused on your cultivation? I only managed to grab a few glances,” Mo Fan grumbled.

“...” Mui Nujiao was left speechless. She quickly changed the topic, “I’ve sorted out the incident.”

“What incident?” Mo Fan was confused.

“About the people who tried to defame you, did you already forget?” Mui Nujiao grumbled. She had put in so much effort to help him clear up the misunderstandings, but he seemed to have forgotten about it.

“Oh, my bad, my mind is a little messed up lately. Someone has been conducting terrible experiments on me. So, did you find out who’s trying to set me up?” Mo Fan sallied forth.

“It’s the Zu Clan. They are spreading rumors about your malignant behavior and taking advantage of the fact that you weren’t in the country to do some wicked things in your name,” Mui Nujiao informed him.

“The Zu Clan... Huh, things are getting interesting,” Mo Fan grinned.

Zu Xiangtian must be behind it! That idiot must be thinking of crushing me, not only in terms of strength, but reputation too! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Did you have a conflict with them?” Mui Nujiao asked.

“That Zu Xiangtian wants to teach me a lesson, and instead of doing it when nobody’s around, he wants to trample me in front of the public. He is planning to rob me of my fame and my woman too,” Mo Fan explained.

“...Why do you sound like someone from an old serial?” Mui Nujiao asked him.

“Anyway, he wants to trample me under his feet.” Mo Fan recalled how aloof Zu Xiangtian was during their encounter.

Zu Xiangtian was extremely confident in himself. If he was someone who just wanted to make Mo Fan suffer, he would have made his move at the village on the Mediterranean Sea. However, he had decided to wait for half a year. It clearly showed that Zu Xiangtian strongly believed Mo Fan had no chance of surpassing him within that period!

“Zu Xiangtian was a few years earlier than us. Isn’t he currently one of the strongest young Mages in the world? He’s not supposed to challenge you before the next World College Tournament,” Mui Nujiao said.

The whole world followed the World College Tournament closely. There was no official tournament for Mages after the World College Tournament. However, people liked to compare the strong Mages, especially those under the age of thirty. Those people had the highest chance of achieving the heights which older Mages could no longer reach.

Zu Xiangtian’s reputation had mainly been established in foreign countries, mostly because the Zu Clan had done a great job setting up their connections there.

A duel between a powerful Mage who was ranked internationally and the strongest student of the World College Tournament was obviously going to get a lot of attention!

“The Zu Clan has long been fed up with me. He wants to humiliate me by challenging me to a duel. I’m more than willing to accept it, since it’s hard to find someone who’s strong and deserves a beating like Zu Xiangtian does,” Mo Fan declared.

“You’re just as belligerent as when you first came to the Pearl Institute!” Mui Nujiao smiled.

Mo Fan had challenged every new student and the entire Fire School after he enrolled in the Pearl Institute. Mui Nujiao was amused whenever she recalled it. Even Ai Tutu still called him Demon King. The students of the same class as him would subconsciously back away whenever they heard his name. He was the typical violent problem student!

“I didn’t start it this time. I can’t just stick my face to Zu Xiangtian’s foot when he wants to step on my face, right? I thought he would come to Fanxue Mountain when it was time to beat me, but I didn’t expect him to use these dirty tricks, like finding people to impersonate me and harass my fans. I will not tolerate it!” Mo Fan snarled.

“I’ve tried to clear your name, but some people preferred to oppose you instead. There’s nothing I can do about that, since you are always getting all the attention. There are always people that are jealous of you,” Mui Nujiao said.

“I don’t mind that, it’s not like everyone knows how to admire my handsomeness,” Mo Fan said proudly.

“Mm, you are shameless in your own way too!” Mui Nujiao giggled.

“...”
