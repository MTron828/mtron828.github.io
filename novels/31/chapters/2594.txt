“What are you two doing?” the old priest asked subconsciously.

“I should be the one asking questions!. What are you all doing here?” Asha’ruiya snarled. The look in her eyes had changed.

Mo Fan rarely saw Asha’ruiya lose her temper. However, when he noticed this group of people was looking forward to seeing something, he immediately guessed why they were here.

Unfortunately, Asha’ruiya and he were not in the middle of something like they had imagined.

Not only were they not having intimate physical contact with one another, they were standing two meters apart!

“Did we miss it?” Tuis could not believe it.

“Woolf, who gave you the permission to break into the chamber? Who gave you the right to interfere with my business and disturb me?” Asha’ruiya snarled.

The old priest’s expression changed. He immediately pointed at Tuis and said, “It was Tuis. He said he will take full responsibility for this.”

The Mountain of the God’s Seal had many cultivation chambers. They were strictly forbidden from breaking into the occupied chambers, let alone when a Saintess was using it. It did not matter what she was doing inside, these people had no right to be here!

“I heard that a man with ulterior motives had followed you into the chamber from a Servant. I was worried someone was trying to harm you, so I quickly called Priest Woolf here. Asha’ruiya, as a Saintess, you should really mind your behavior. It might result in some rumors unfavorable to the Parthenon Temple!” Tuis declared fearlessly.

The Servant fell to the ground and trembled in fear.

How could Tuis betray her like that? Wasn’t he the one who had asked her to spy on Asha’ruiya?

“Drag her out and cripple her cultivation!” Asha’ruiya did not show the Servant any mercy.

Servants had a reputable status in the Parthenon Temple. Normally, the punishment to a Servant had to go through the Great Muse or the Hall Mother first, but they had crossed Asha’ruiya’s line today. She immediately summoned a member of the Hall of Judgment!

The Adjudicator was wearing golden armor and riding a Royal Griffin. He took the Servant away immediately. They could hear the Servant screaming as she was forcibly taken away.

She had worked so hard to become a Servant. Crippling her cultivation was no different from killing her!

“Since it’s just a misunderstanding, I shall excuse myself,” Tuis waved his hand. He did not think much of his misconduct.

“Take Tuis down!” Asha’ruiya ordered.

More Adjudicators had gathered in the chamber. Something serious was about to happen.

The people of the Hall of Knights soon arrived. They had just received the news, but they were obviously on the Saintess’ side.

“Asha’ruiya, I have already apologized to you. Besides, don’t you think your action might damage the Parthenon Temple’s reputation? I’m just a little too sensitive. I didn’t want someone to ruin a Saintess’ reputation!” Tuis stared at Asha’ruiya.

He was not afraid. Everyone in the Parthenon Temple knew about Tuis’ family. Who would dare to touch him?

Asha’ruiya might have the power to punish a Servant directly, but she did not have the right to punish him unless she was elected as the Goddess. No one, except for the Hall Mother, would dare to do anything to him!

Even if the Hall Mother learned what happened, Tuis was not afraid, either. What would others think when they heard a Saintess was alone with a man inside a secret chamber?

Asha’ruiya frowned.

Neither the Hall of Judgment nor the Hall of Knights dared to touch Tuis. However, Asha’ruiya did not want to let this go so easily.

In the end, her power was still too weak. If Ye Xinxia was the victim, the Hall of Judgment and Hall of Knights would have done something immediately, let alone if it was Izisha!

“Why don’t you try me?” Mo Fan said to the angry Asha’ruiya. “I’m an expert at dealing with scum like him.”

“Go hard on him. I’ll take full responsibility if anything happens!” Asha’ruiya had had enough of Tuis.

“No way, I can be responsible too! Of course, I will take full responsibility too, after I’m done with him,” Mo Fan declared righteously.

Asha’ruiya giggled.

“That’s right, you shouldn’t be angry because of a retard like him. You look prettier when you smile,” Mo Fan reached out his hand and fondled Asha’ruiya’s chin with affection.

Mo Fan did not mind showing them that there was really something between him and Asha’ruiya. What could they do about it?

Mo Fan glanced at the Adjudicators and the Knights. He scoffed, “It’s hopeless to rely on you guys to protect a Saintess’ dignity. Even scum like Tuis dares to bark in front of you all.”

“Who are you calling a dog? You son of a!...” Tuis blurted out in humiliation.

However, Mo Fan suddenly appeared in front of Tuis before he could finish his sentence.

Mo Fan was currently wearing a suit, which set off his solid build. A strange mysterious Aura was swaying behind him like dark flames.

A hand engulfed in the same Aura grabbed Tuis’ throat firmly.

Tuis was lifted off the ground. The magic he was gathering dissipated as Mo Fan waved his hand. Tuis immediately turned into a defenseless victim in Mo Fan’s grasp.

“You...you...” Tuis was shocked and terrified.

Since when did this guy become so terrifying?

Even though Tuis had never beaten Mo Fan in the past, he would not have lost to him so easily!

The Adjudicators and the Golden Sun Knights were about to make their moves. “Who dares to interfere!?” Asha’ruiya yelled at them.

She might not be able to order them to punish Tuis, but she could definitely stop them from interrupting Mo Fan!

If she could not even do such a simple thing, it was meaningless to hold the title of a Saintess!

Asha’ruiya’s hot temper froze everyone, and they dared not move. They could tell Asha’ruiya was really angry this time!
