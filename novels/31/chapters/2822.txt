Chapter 2823: The Vision of The Divine Walls

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When the Undead finished drawing a door on the wall, the moon was high above the Ancient City Gate in the clear sky.

The moon shone brightly like a white curtain. The moonlight reflected the ordinary plains outside the Ancient City Gate. But when light fell on the area inside the Ancient City Gate, they were greeted with a completely different sight than what they had seen in the day.

Under the reflection of the moonlight, many buildings from the ancient era appeared inside the Ancient City Gate. Although the streets, people, and soldiers were just phantoms, Mo Fan and his group felt as if they had traveled back in time. Their surroundings were crowded, lively, and vivid.

“Come, let’s go to the Sky Observing City once more.” The Undead invited the crowd out from the Ancient City Gate, gesturing for them to walk out under the gate, and then walk in through the gate again.

“What an awesome design! The use of the ancient Chaos and Space Element magical power is as advanced as virtual reality in the modern era!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

…

When they re-entered the Sky Observing City, they found themselves in a different world. They were no longer at the rundown bazaar in a small town. Sky Observing City in the past was more prosperous than its current state. Mo Fan and his group saw many pavilions, palaces, temples, and the tall and majestic Ancient City Wall Forest!

It was hard to imagine and understand that they were in the middle of a city that they had only heard about. It was unbelievably realistic. They felt the coldness and hardness of the bricks when they stretched their hands out to touch them.

“Did we travel through time?” Zhao Manyan’s jaw dropped.

The crowd surveyed their surroundings. For a moment, they wondered if their minds were playing tricks on them, or if there was truly an existence of such an ancient city that someone had sealed it with a heavenly spell, withstanding even time itself.

The streets were crowded. A large group of Calvary Mages charged toward the Ancient City Gate, and the crowd quickly paved a way for them.

The Calvary Mages were charging toward Mo Fan and his group. However, the Calvary Mages swarmed them as if they did not see them there. They rode right past their group.

“This is like a ghost city. The moonlight acts as a photographic film while the Ancient City Gate serves as the projection. What we’re seeing is just the images projected from the ancient era,” said Lingling.

“Why did they record these things? Are they trying to tell us something about what happened here?” Jiang Shaoxu said while surveying his surroundings.

“It must have a certain special meaning.”

The crowd continued to walk deeper into Sky Observing City. Suddenly, the sky turned flaming red. The next moment, the houses and the walls within the city seemed as if it was burning in fire. The peaceful city turned chaotic in an instant.

The residents on the streets fled. The ancient officials and mages quickly gathered together and fought against something in the sky. Bizarre and destructive power struck the city from various directions. Many people turned into a pool of blood because of these energies.

The city seemed to be under some kind of attack. Fire was burning everywhere in the city. Bodies were scattered. Many widows and children lost their homes and cried for help.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

A loud bang came from the direction of the Ancient City Walls. The towering walls of the city shook violently.

Mo Fan turned his head around and looked at the Ancient City Wall where they had entered from, only to realize that the wall had come to life and metamorphosed into ancient soldiers entirely made up of walls and bricks.

Not only the Ancient City Walls, but the walls that surrounded the Sky Observing City underwent a drastic transformation. They were split and stood independently. They became ancient soldiers with lances and stood neatly in a row. They were tall and majestic. They stood guard over the Sky Observing City!

“What kind of magic can transform the Ancient City Walls into warriors?” Mo Fan cried out in surprise.

The sight was shocking to behold. A while ago, the Ancient City Wall was about to be destroyed. The next moment, the walls came alive and defended against some attack on the Sky Observing City.

With the protection from the soldiers, they soon ended the war. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan watched in disbelief as the soldiers returned to their position side by side and transformed back into the ancient and robust city wall that surrounded the ancient city.

“Mingwu Ancient City… Mingwu Ancient City…” Song Feiyao mumbled.

Mo Fan heard her murmur. “Did Mingwu Ancient City show the same vision?”

“Didn’t you see the statues at Mingwu Ancient City? The materials of the Ancient City Wall are the same as the statues from Mingwu Ancient City. Grandpas and grannies told us that the statues can come to life. However, we’ve lost the ancient spell so we cannot summon them. We can only rely on their remaining divine power to deter the demons,” said Song Feiyao.

Mo Fan remembered the statues. He realized that the materials from the Ancient City Walls were indeed the same as the statues from Mingwu Ancient City. ‘Did the statues of Mingwu Ancient City originate here?’

The Mingwu Ancient City owned some special statues. However, the entire Sky Observing City was surrounded by these statues!

‘Who had cast such great and amazing magical power back then? How did they bring the Ancient City Walls to life and transfer them to other places?’

Besides, it was clear that Sky Observing City had extended majestic walls. ‘Why was it left with only an Ancient City Gate now? What about the other parts?’

‘And what did all this have to do with the sacred totem beast?’

“Mo Fan, I have a theory,” Lingling said solemnly.

Mo Fan turned to look at Lingling. The rest waited for her to speak.

“You are the guardians of the Underground Holy Spring. You could have been guarding the sacred totem beast all the while,” said Lingling.

“What does the Underground Holy Spring have to do with the sacred totem beast? Do you have any evidence?” Mo Fan was confused.

“We’ll know the answer as we continue to walk to the city center,” said Lingling while pointing at the Avenue of Heavy Soldier in the middle of the city.

The Avenue of Heavy Soldier was a standard cross that led to four corners of the Sky Observing City. There was only one entrance, which was the Ancient City Gate where they had entered from. The rest were surrounded by walls with very narrow doors. They did not usually open those narrow doors.

The crowd followed Lingling to the cross and found an ancient well at the Avenue of Heavy Soldiers. The well was like a human’s eye. It was round and clear. And it stared into the sky.

Mo Fan and Song Feiyao were very familiar with the Underground Holy Spring. When they walked to the edge of the ancient well, their faces were filled with shock.

The Underground Holy Spring, the Ancient City Wall, and the sacred totem beast…

‘Could the guardians of the Underground Holy Spring have been standing guard over one of the sacred totem beasts instead of the Underground Holy Spring over the years?’ This explained the reason for the unique warmth of the Underground Holy Spring.

It was actually the totem power!
