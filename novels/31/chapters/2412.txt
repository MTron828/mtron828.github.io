The people of the Lu Clan kept their promises. They had delivered the things Mo Fan asked for while he was cultivating in Bo City.

“I’m a poor man once again!” Mo Fan sighed as he paid the sum.

He had been busy going places lately, yet he had still ended up with almost zero savings.

The only valuable possessions he had remaining were the three Water Fundamental Crystals.

“I will soon be going to Mu Clan Mountain. There’s an epic battle ahead. I should help the old wolf evolve first,” Mo Fan murmured to himself.

Even though Mo Fan had improved his Space Element to the Super Level, he did not have time to practice its complicated Star Palace. He would have trouble using the Super Space Spell.

As for the old wolf, he had gathered all the necessary resources. The old wolf was almost covered in rust after being stuck at the Advancing Period of the Commander Level for too long.

Once he became a Ruler-level creature, he would directly increase Mo Fan’s fighting capacity, as a Ruler-level creature could hold off a group of Super Mages.

A formidable renowned clan like the Mu Clan clearly had a lot of Super Mages. They needed all the help they could get if they were trying to stir up trouble!

Mo Fan sat in the cultivation room. The special stone palettes completely blocked off the noise on the outside. The room reminded him of the underground room below one of Bo City’s silver skyscrapers, where the Underground Holy Spring had been hidden away.

Mu Zhuoyun had managed to build a little stream beside the seat. The gentle sound of the stream was relaxing to listen to. He had put in some effort into designing the room.

“Old wolf, let’s begin!” Mo Fan called out, Summoning the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. The snow-white furry wolf was brimming with excitement.

The day he waited so long for had finally arrived!

“We’ll reconstruct the bones first. Are you ready?” Mo Fan asked him.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf nodded without any hesitation.

As Mo Fan gradually took on stronger enemies, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf had had enough of his slow and fragile bones. He needed stronger bones, greater speed, more explosive strength, and more durable flesh!

“Here we go!”

Reconstructing bones was an extremely painful process.

Mo Fan had not chosen the cultivation room because he was worried the noise outside would disturb him. He was afraid the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s cries of agony would attract the World Animal Protection Society’s attention!

The pain when bones exploded was much more unbearable than when bones were being broken.

The growing bones would also pierce his flesh and organs.

Huge risks were involved whenever a demon creature was evolving, since they were abandoning their old flesh to develop stronger new flesh. They might die from the torturous pain if anything went wrong.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s bones changed him dramatically. His size was rapidly increasing. His bones were thickening, causing him to grow several times bigger. Mo Fan could not even reach the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s knee with his hand now when he stood beside the creature.

White bone spikes thrust out of the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s flesh, like sharp spears were growing out of his body.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf fell to the ground in agony, but the growth of his bones continued! More craggy white bones appeared.

“Can you bear with it?” Mo Fan looked at the Flying Creek Snow Wolf with pity.

“Awoo!!” The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled that he was going to walk the path he had chosen to the end!

“I’ll keep going then,” Mo Fan nodded slowly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan could see the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s huge transformations, but he could also sense the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s life force was depleting rapidly.

No one could help him under the circumstances. If the Flying Creek Snow Wolf failed to last until the end, his old flesh would be torn apart by the new bones, ending his life!

The only relief was that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was born a natural fighter. He had been fighting for survival since he was only a Servant-class creature. He did not accept Mo Fan’s energy to treat his injuries, and chose to let his wounds heal on their own.

In other words, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s flesh was well-refined. It was tenacious and was also good at healing from injuries.

His tenacity and self-recovery ability were what allowed the Flying Creek Snow Wolf to get through the most difficult part of the process!

His bones finally stopped growing. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf lay on the ground, but his eyes were burning passionately, like refined metal inside a furnace.

“The next step is the lineage!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf nodded.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf had lost a lot of blood as his bones were reconstructed. The modification of his lineage was extremely important to him!

He had evolved from the Servant Class to the Commander Level, from a lowly creature to a noble one.

Not every wolf demon was born to be a king. Every wolf was expelled by their parents, forcing them to survive under harsh conditions.

Only the strong managed to survive in the end. A real king had to defeat all his enemies!

Even those with an outstanding lineage could keep fighting and keep being injured in order to grow continuously and awaken the power of their bloodline!

Changing lineage was a test for the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. All the experiences he had were bonus points for this test.

If he had enough points, it meant the new lineage would merge with the Flying Creek Snow Wolf and acknowledged his right to become a Ruler-level creature!

The process did not involve any pain. All he had to do was to wait for the result to be made apparent.

Mo Fan was a little worried. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was hardworking and belligerent in the past, but he had so many attractive female wolves in his den after he became the boss.

He was still a loyal wolf, but Mo Fan had no idea if he was still a decent wolf. If he had spent most of his time indulging in his desires, he would most likely fail the test!

The lineage started flowing inside the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s body. It was rapidly draining the energy of Mo Fan’s Summoning Element.

It was challenging for an Advanced Summoner to evolve their Summoned Beast into a Ruler-level creature.

Mo Fan’s energy was almost depleted after helping to reconstruct the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s bones. Luckily, Mu Ningxue had obtained a useful item for him, which could provide Mo Fan’s Summoning Element with energy continuously. Otherwise, Mo Fan might have ended up holding the Flying Creek Snow Wolf back.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf suddenly raised his head and howled. His body was covered in blood, but his fur was growing out again after flashes of red light.

“It looks like his bloodline has been modified successfully!”

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was recovering. His flesh was regrowing after obtaining the new lineage.

His new fur was completely different now. A layer of curly fur covered his skin, followed by another layer of long dark blue fur extending above the first layer.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was recovering and evolving swiftly!

He was at the brink of death just a moment ago, but he was now standing in a majestic stance. His presence alone was completely different. It was noble and imperious, unlike the usual cunning and despicable temperament of a wolf. It felt more like a tiger’s, a sense of pure brute force and savagery!

“Only the final part is left! This is the Wolf Queen’s soul. Let’s see if you can devour it!” Mo Fan shouted.
