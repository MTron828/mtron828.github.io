The tower on the walls was crowded with Magicians. Hunters, students, Battlemages, Imperial Magicians; and Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Super Magicians with Lightning, Water, Fire, Wind, Light, and Earth Elements...

“Vanguards, charge!” yelled Han Ji.

As soon as the order was given out, four Super Magicians simultaneously beat their wings. The brilliance of the wings was so outstanding that even when they charged into the ocean of undead, the others could still see the magical glow coming from them!

They dashed forward in four straight lines. The black ocean was clearly being split apart under the destructive force of the four Super Magicians, like four red carpets being laid on top of the black ocean, extending five hundred meters into the distance. It was impossible to tell how many zombies stacked on top of one another were annihilated by the four Super Magicians. Most of them were blasted into nothing instantly!

Following the four Super Magicians clearing the path as vanguards, the whole place suddenly turned blazing red!

Raging flames poured down from the sky like rain. Each burst of flame was the size of a fist as it fell from the sky. The raindrops evaporated instantly in the heat. The stormy clouds were set aflame.

An unknown number of Fire Imperial Magicians had cast the Advanced Fire Spell, Sky Flame Funeral, at the same time. As the rain of flame hit the ground, it turned the land occupied by the undead into a sea of fire, spreading wildly into the surroundings!

“Let’s go!” said Han Ji, waving his hand, signaling the Imperial Magicians to move into a square-shaped formation with Mage, Zhang Xiaohou, Fang Gu, and Su Xiaoluo in the middle. They charged forward onto the land, flames all around them.

The formation consisted of Advanced Magicians. Each one of them was drawing a brilliant Star Constellation. The intertwining Star Patterns accumulated boundless elemental energy. The Wind Magicians were the first ones to finish channeling!

Green gusts of wind appeared around the square-shaped formation, rapidly transforming into a fierce wave that rolled across the flames and split the fiery ocean in half. As the zombies that were burned beyond recognition stumbled into the wind blades, they were cut into flying pieces and scattered across the place.

The wind formed a raft under their feet. The rolling wave dragged the group forward. Mo Fan and his crew were dragged almost five hundred meters ahead by the Imperial Magicians. The inner walls were far behind them within the blink of an eye!

The number of skeletons significantly increased around five hundred meters away from the inner city. The sinister white bones looked like powerful machinery. The skeletons still had space to move their limbs, as the place was not as crowded as where the zombies had been. As soon as they saw Magicians trespassing into their territory, they immediately raised their weapons and charged at their enemies.

The primary attack of the skeletons was the cold weapons they had created using their bones. Gleaming bone swords, long and sharp bone sabers, fists like hammers that produced loud blasts when they slammed the ground, and long arms as sharp as spears, pikes and lances...

The skeletons were of various sizes, but one could tell their age by observing the color and luster of their bones. Mo Fan’s gaze passed the wall of Imperial Magicians ahead of him and discovered that there were lots of Skeleton Generals among the skeletons, to his dismay. Their bones were hard as steel, with icy reflections across the surface. Their eyes were the scariest, glaring at anything alive in hate and murderous intent!

As they opened their mouths, it looked like their lower jaws were about to fall off. Their teeth without gums looked extraordinarily eerie.

A Skeleton Official, its bones as reflective as a piece of steel uttered a roar, ordering the army of skeletons to charge at their enemy. Be it those that leapt into the air, those that were charging straight at them, or those that fired their bones like arrows, there were simply too many of them, leaving them with no room to dodge the attacks.

“Water Curtain!”

“Water Curtain!”

“Water Curtain!”

“Water Curtain!”

The Advanced Water Magicians simultaneously cast the Advanced Water Spell. The brilliance of the blue Star Constellation reached a distance of a kilometer. Every Imperial Magician was encapsulated by the sacred blue light.

Water Curtains that looked like thin waterfalls surrounded the formation. The front, the back, the sides; the Water Curtains had formed a tiny safety barrier around the square formation, with no visible gap between the curtains.

Mo Fan felt like he was being protected inside a watery boundary. The layers of Water Curtains prevented the skeletons from attacking. The barrier remained intact even when bone weapons were hurled at the Water Curtains. Even the attacks of the Warrior-level skeletons were nullified by the Water Curtains!

“Kill the Skeleton Official!” Han Ji commanded in a stern voice.

Mo Fan vaguely sensed a mysterious power of the Shadow Element disappearing from his side like an arrow, going right into the middle of the skeletons.

It was easy to locate the Skeleton Official, due to its enormous size. Before Mo Fan could take a closer look at the Super Magician that was attacking at lightning speed, he heard a loud explosion from the direction of the Skeleton Official.

The Skeleton Official’s appearance was ugly and horrifying. Its shoulders were filled with skulls, like lumps on its skin...

As the skulls fell off its body, its building-sized body exploded too!

“I’ll send you off once I clear the obstacles!” a loud voice came from within the army of skeletons.

Green wind blades appeared in all directions all of a sudden, at least a thousand of them, slashing randomly among the skeletons. The explosions and flickers of solid air instantly killed thousands of skeletons.

The bones were broken into pieces, fell to the ground, and stacked up into a thick layer of ‘snow’. When Mo Fan thought the Spell had come to an end, the thousand blades that seemed to be scattered across the place suddenly gathered in the hand of the shadowy figure from before!

“Thousand Wind Blades!”

“Slaughtering Wind Slash!”

The shadow’s aura grew tremendously, his hands were holding a sword made out of the wind blades that had slaughtered thousands of skeletons just a moment ago!

The slashing sword swept forward, emitting a crazy light together with a fierce airflow. The ocean of skeletons ahead was suddenly split in half by a line. Both the skeletons and their Skeleton Generals were broken into pieces, scattering across the ground!

The power of the Slaughtering Wind Slash left the younger Magicians with wide eyes and gaping mouths. The Spell had completely cleared a few hundred meters of the path ahead!
