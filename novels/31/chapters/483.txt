“Damn it, if we managed to survive this, I swear I’ll cut that son of a bitch into eight pieces!”

There was no point in preserving their strength any longer. The party quickly took out all their secret equipment that was useful.

It felt like the sound of death was right behind their ears, and most terrifyingly, they were running right in its direction. They were not sure if they were just going to crash into it and die in an instant.

This time, everyone felt like they were having a race with the God of Death, as the hole Lingling mentioned was still a distance away.

The entire place was blazing red like fire. The lava had filled up most of the drains, and was spilling over onto the path the group was running on. The liquid splattering into the air as they ran past instantly ignited in the air, which was fairly intimidating to look at.

The rocks on the sides could no longer support the heavy weight, and the lava burst out from the walls in an exploding wave. The lava instantly poured in the direction of the party. Its heat was enough to penetrate their bodies.

“Light Protection: Rampart!”

Zhao Manyan quickly reacted and summoned a light barrier before the lava jetting out from the walls could reach the group.

The lava was stopped by the sacred golden wall, allowing the group to pass the section safely.

The whole place was shaking wildly because of the lava tide. The stronger the vibration, the quicker the walls were collapsing. The lava continued to splatter in the air, burning the group’s skin.

“Are we there yet!?” Mo Fan rushed in front of the party, trying to use his body to block the splattering lava.

He was the only person that was unharmed, as the Rose Flame had granted him some resistance to the lava’s heat. However, he knew that he would also be cooked alive if he was soaked inside the lava.

Lingling, who was sitting on the Swift Star Wolf’s back, had yet to say a word.

She was trying her best to keep her focus, as she had to locate the same hole she had only caught a glimpse of before somewhere in this passage that was being destroyed by the lava!

Finally, her eyes flickered as she yelled at the group, “Turn left over here, quick!”

As soon as Lingling spoke, a blinding red light burst out from the corner ahead, like an enraged beast trying to use its body to fill up the space as it charged in the party’s direction!

The sight was utterly terrifying, as everyone could feel their scalp breaking apart. In just a few seconds, they would be dead with their corpses burned into ashes!

The cave was still some distance away. They would not have enough time to make it.

“You guys go ahead!” yelled Mo Fan, facing the group behind him.

“What are you trying to do?” blurted out Xinxia.

Mo Fan did not respond. His figure was engulfed in rose-colored flame, quickly turning him into a fiery demon.

He stood in place and drew a Star Pattern under his feet. Most people would have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing under the circumstances. The terrifying lava could make anyone’s mind go blank, and all they could do was wait for their death.

Mo Fan forced himself to gather his focus. When he thought of the people whom he regarded as important behind him, he did not dare to let any hint of fear or hesitation enter his heart.

He opened his mouth and uttered a roar. A tremendous force contracted onto a ring of fire on his right wrist.

“Fiery Fist!”

Facing the astonishing lava tide, Mo Fan’s determined face was fully red from the heat, yet he still threw the punch at the magnificent sight!

The lava was rolling in the group’s direction, and according to its speed, it would have swept past the group by now. However, Mo Fan’s fist blasted a hole right in the middle of the flow. The burning liquid flowed past them on the sides, as if the tide had devoured them.

A figure was standing firmly before the lava, his fist exerting a great force as it tried to hold back the lava and split the flow with brute force, allowing the rest to retreat to the hole that Lingling had mentioned.

The power of the fist was able to hold the tide, but as more lava came surging in their direction, the gap that Mo Fan was making was filled up quickly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xinxia, Lingling, the Swift Star Wolf, Zhang Xiaohou, Zhao Manyan and Chen Yi managed to jump into the cave at the last second, yet before they could feel relieved, they turned around and saw the figure outside the cave swept away by the red tide.

A loud crash took place. All they could see as they glanced at the entrance of the cave was lava sweeping past like a giant fire dragon!

Compared to the destructive fire dragon, Mo Fan was too small. He was gone too quickly, Xinxia did not even have the chance to see him for the last time. Her mind was still filled with the firm and fearless back who was facing the terrifying lava fire dragon with his fist...

“Mo...Mo Fan!”

The others immediately rushed to the entrance, ready to dash into the flame to save Mo Fan, yet they could not get any closer because of the lava.

The lava crashed into the entrance of the cave as if it had hit some part of the rock. The force knocked them all back into the cave...

The impact from the lava was stunning. It almost collapsed the entrance!

More lava began to pour into the cave. When Xinxia and Lingling saw Zhang Xiaohou trying to jump out of the cave to save Mo Fan, they quickly ordered the Swift Star Wolf to stop him.

The Swift Star Wolf quickly jumped forward and bit Zhang Xiaohou’s shirt, dragging him back from the entrance.

Meanwhile, the glowing red lava began to flow into the cave, forcing the group to back off.

“Quick, seal the entrance!” ordered Lingling.

“Don’t seal it!” yelled Zhang Xiaohou.

Zhao Manyan and Chen Yi were dumbfounded, not knowing who they should listen to.
