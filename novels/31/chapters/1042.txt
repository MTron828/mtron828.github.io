Advisor Feng Li walked up to Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni. Surprisingly, he seemed to be ignoring their injuries.

His face was cold as he snapped, “I have no time to waste dealing with your clans, but you better pass my message to them! If something happens to a member of the national team that I, Feng Li, have chosen before the World College Tournament, I won’t forgive the people responsible easily, even if they are the number one or two clans of our country!”

Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying were shivering in anger after hearing this.

It was supposed to be the two of them giving Mu Ningxue a deadly blow, turning her from a talented genius to a cheap, detestable woman, so that she would never be able to stand at the same height as them. However, not only did they fail to do any harm to her, they were suffering from severe injuries inflicted by Mo Fan, and were then warned by Advisor Feng Li! The grudge they were holding was even more unbearable than the pain inflicted by the lightning and the fire!

Even though Mu Ningxue had lost everything, she was still one of the most talented Ice Mages of their country, a formal representative of the national team. It went without saying that the advisors would not care about the rules of their clans. However, if their student was injured, they would seek responsibility!

“You have only yourself to blame for the injuries you’re suffering,” Advisor Feng Li harrumphed coldly. He then turned to Mo Fan and said, “Mo Fan, you’ve slightly overdone it. Please control your temper, even if you’re delivering punishment on behalf of me.”

Mu Ningxue was startled, but he quickly reacted. He nodded and said, “I’ll be more careful next time. It’s just that I really despise people that try to hurt their own teammates! I was actually very gentle compared to before, considering that I see Mu Ningxue as even more important than myself.”

Feng Li glared at Mo Fan. His mustache curled up.

-This asshole, I already gave him an excuse to justify his actions. He just needed to follow suit, yet he is trying to take the lead instead!-

Feng Li was the main advisor of the national team. He was basically fully in charge of the team. No clan dared to touch him due to his overwhelming status. Both Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying were infuriated when they learned Mo Fan was punishing them on behalf of Advisor Feng Li!

It meant that they could not take revenge on Mo Fan!

Li Kaifeng and Zu Jiming had recovered consciousness. They also wanted to make Mo Fan pay, but they had no way of doing so.

“We’ll consider it settled. You can deal with your personal conflicts after the World College Tournament. If I see anyone breaking the rules again, I’ll definitely take it to the factions behind you!” Feng Li was so loud that everyone felt their eardrums hurting.

Guan Yu, who did not take part in the battle immediately, helped those that were injured by Mo Fan. Anyone could see that the grudge the four had was on the verge of bursting out from their chests.

Even with the four of them teaming up, they had still suffered an utter defeat!

They had no chance of defeating Mo Fan themselves, yet they were scared to step on Advisor Feng Li’s tail if they asked for help. They had no choice but to swallow the grudge into their stomachs, and wait until the World College Tournament finished!

Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying felt they had totally lost face. Their clothes were ragged, and they were covered in dirt and filth. Every woman in the world cared a lot about their appearance. Mu Ningxue was supposed to be in their shoes instead!

——

“Mo Fan, are you out of your mind? You’ve injured four of my students. The tournament is about to begin. Are you trying to disqualify our team straight away?” Feng Li scolded Mo Fan.

“Why didn’t you intervene when they were bullying Mu Ningxue?” Mo Fan snapped back in displeasure.

The advisors did not intervene even after something so serious happened. Were they seriously going to just stand and watch the Mu Clan take Mu Ningxue away and steal her cultivation?

No one knew better than Mo Fan how much effort Mu Ningxue had put into her cultivation. Taking away the hard work she had put in for the past ten years was no different than killing her!

Mo Fan had never felt this angry. If Feng Li had not shown up, he would seriously have turned the two vicious women into cripples!

Especially Nanrong Ni! Mo Fan had the urge to tear her face off, to see how ugly she would look under her fake, disgusting mask!

When Nanrong Ni was poisoned in the East Maritime Fortress, it was Mu Ningxue who risked her life to find the antidote for her. She should be grateful for the rest of her life that Mu Ningxue was her friend, yet she had set Mu Ningxue up in return instead! Mo Fan felt extremely angry on Mu Ningxue’s behalf after learning how vicious the woman was!

“It was indeed their personal matter, you had no right to be involved in it. I have taken the blame for you this time. Don’t stir up any trouble again, understood? You really are the most problematic member on the team, aren’t you aware? Don’t you know to control your temper a little better as a young man? If everyone simply goes ahead and does whatever they want, wouldn’t everything be a total mess?” Feng Li cursed.

“The Mu Clan and Nanrong Clan are still going to trouble Mu Ningxue. Are you and the other good-for-nothing advisors going to help her or not?” Mo Fan demanded.

“Who did you just call good-for-nothing, you little asshole! Don’t think you can act recklessly just because someone has your back! I will deal with the Mu Clan and Nanrong Clan myself, but you, just stop complicating things!” Feng Li was so angry that there was smoke coming out of his nose.

“Can you also tell them that if they dare to touch Mu Ningxue again, they will have to bring two coffins to keep their corpses? I swear I will kill them, even if I have to surrender myself to the Enforcement Union!” Mo Fan promised angrily.

“It was you that beat the crap out of them, and you’re still trying to threaten them?”

——

After the little quarrel with Feng Li, Mo Fan quickly went over to Mu Ningxue to inquire about her wellbeing.

Mo Fan had totally panicked when he heard that Mu Ningxue had gone missing from Zhao Manyan. He did not expect both Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni to pick on Mu Ningxue when he was occupied. Luckily, Mu Ningxue had managed to look after herself. Otherwise, it was difficult to say what was going to happen to her.

Taking away a person’s cultivation was as horrible as killing someone’s parents, yet the Mu Clan was actually cruel enough to do such a thing. Mo Fan really had the urge to raze the Mu Clan to the ground! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Mo Fan moved closer to Mu Ningxue and asked in a gentle voice, “Are you alright?”

Mu Ningxue did not respond. For the past few days, she hd been trying to calm down in a quiet place.

She did consider leaving for good, but she felt it would mean that she had conceded to the two women. As such, she had decided to come back to the team.

She knew the Mu Clan and the Nanrong Clan were most likely going to pick on her. Therefore, she went to look for Advisor Feng Li and Song He instead. The two advisors were infuriated after learning about the two women’s detestable actions. They even promised Mu Ningxue that as long as she was still a member of the national team, they would never let that happen to her again.

If she simply turned and left, it would only allow the two women to control the situation. On top of being stigmatized for having a relative that was closely related to the Black Vatican, she would be called a betrayer of the clan, too, and a thief who had stolen the clan’s precious belonging. Once the accusations were heaped upon her, she would never be able to overturn the situation.

As such, she could no longer back away after considering the situation she was in. She had to stand higher than them, and find herself a foothold.

The World College Tournament, the sacred place in Venice the whole world was placing its attention on, was the only place she could earn enough status, honor, reputation, and power!

She had left the clan, meaning that she was all alone. In order to stand a chance against the enormous Mu Clan and Nanrong Clan, she needed to establish her own influence!

No clan would dare to plot against a young Mage that had won great glory for their country during the World College Tournament!

“You can tell me everything you’re going through. It’s fine telling me anything; don’t just wear such a cold face, it will only make me worried,” Mo Fan said.

“I’m fine,” Mu Ningxue responded.

“How could you possibly be fine? You didn’t even cast a single glance at me all this time. I know it’s my fault for leaving you at such a time… I promise I will never leave you again!” Mo Fan swore.

“If you want me to feel better, just stay away from me,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Look at you, and you said you’re fine,” Mo Fan scoffed.

Mu Ningxue knew how shamelessly relentless Mo Fan was. She immediately rose to her feet and walked away.

Mo Fan watched Mu Ningxue’s cold figure and her snow-like, silver hair, and let out a sigh.

Mo Fan was not an idiot. He could easily tell there was a barrier between him and Mu Ningxue, the same feeling when they first reunited.

The truth was, after what they had gone through in the desolated Jinlin City and the training around the world, Mo Fan could feel that Mu Ningxue was starting to open up to him…

However, Mo Fan suddenly felt that their relationship had gone back to the initial phase after what had happened.

As such, Mo Fan actually hated the two women to the guts. They must have said something that urged Mu Ningxue to keep him out of her frozen heart too, leaving all his efforts in vain…

However, Mo Fan would never give up!

Even if the same thing was repeated a hundred times, Mo Fan would not give up. He would surely win the affection of the woman he was interested in, regardless of what happened between them. Even if she was annoyed and cautious around him, he would never give up!

She had changed. The feeling that Mu Ningxue gave Mo Fan was like two different people compared to the last time they met.

Mo Fan could clearly sense from her words and gaze that her heart was heading into an icy abyss, where no one could possibly reach…

That being said, it was more important that his heart toward her would never change or turn cold.

To be fair, it was quite difficult for a woman as obsessed with spiritual cleanliness as her to accept a trashy man like him!
