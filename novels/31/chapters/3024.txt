3025 Red Cardinal Appears

Within seconds, their armors melted, their skin and bones turned to ashes, and their souls were gone. Nothing was left!

Golden Sun Tyrant Titan with black-striped flames…

It had no interest in the puny mortals who were like ants in front of it. It did not like the Parthenon Temple. The thin barrier could not stop its attack.

The accumulated hatred from many years culminated into tyranny under the stimulation of Mad Poppies all over the city. In the past, humans were only like a group of poor monkeys to the goods. They served as food to every species since they were weak and petty. They begged for the protection of the Tyrant Titan and offered some delicious food and human sacrifices.

Did they think they could have a new life and be the master if they owned the Parthenon Temple? They were stupid!

The Parthenon Temple was nothing but a bunch of scum trying to play god!

The giant figure of the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan gradually appeared. It flew in the sky with a circle of sun flames around its body. Every few seconds, its body and the sun ring would burst out with black-striped fire. The fire was dazzling. It was like the sun setting down on the earth!

“Ring of the Sun! We can’t hurt it if that thing is there,” said the Fighting Magistrate Norman.

The Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was an ancient god of emperor-level. Few of the knights were Forbidden Mages. Even if they united to form a knight contract comparable to the Forbidden Curse, they did not have enough time and power to cast it perfectly.

The Titan had launched a massacre, and it was a unilateral massacre, which was unstoppable!

…

“Impossible. It is impossible. Apollo is dead. It can’t be resurrected from the abyss,” The Old Priest, Falmer, looked at the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan.

His words were meaningless to many members of the Parthenon Temple. The fact was that the thousand-year-old Titan was still alive, and it had come to take revenge on Athens. It was going to destroy the Parthenon Temple!

Hall Mother, Pamise, did not join in the battle. She began to fall into a deep thought after a moment of panic.

“Where is Tulce?” asked the Hall Mother, Pamise.

“They have already left the Parthenon Temple, and the two saintesses have expelled them. Alas, we should not have made that decision. If members of the Tulce family are here, they can greatly weaken the strength and affect the mind of the Tyrant Titan. In this way, we can buy more time for the knights to summon the Godslayer,” said the Old Priest, Falmer.

When the Hall Mother, Pamise, heard that, her eyes suddenly turned fierce. She was furious.

“Tulce has betrayed us! They are the ones who brought the Titans of this level here!” The Hall Mother, Pamise, had figured everything out.

“You all are slow. The Tulce family has pledged their loyalty to Lord Salan.” Black Druggist smiled cunningly, revealing his yellow teeth.

Even if the Black Vatican carefully arranged the flowers of death all over the city, it would be impossible for the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan and the Twin Tyrant Titans to appear at the same time without the Tulce family. They colluded with the Black Vatican.

This explained why such an ancient family had so carelessly taught the God Controlling Art to an evil person. They had long been scheming and plotting evil. They had already been planning this funeral at the Flower Festival for the destruction of the Parthenon Temple!

They were scums! They were traitors! How could Hall Mother not be angry at that?

“Isn’t the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan dead already?”

“Liars! Parthenon Temple is full of a bunch of liars! They deceived us!”

“Tell us! Why is the Sun Demon in the sky? The emperor-level Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was alive in this world, but the Parthenon Temple deceived us!”

People were in great pain, so their thoughts were influenced. The Parthenon Temple had promised that the last Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was dead. The Hall Mother, Pamise, had announced it to the whole world.

Everyone clearly remembered this announcement, and the Greeks no longer had to worry about the appearance of the ten-thousand-year Titan.

“Hahahaha. Lovely residents of Athens, the great Hall Mother didn’t deceive you. The Golden Sun Tyrant Titan is indeed dead. But don’t forget that the Resurrection Divine Art exists in this world.”

“One of your saintesses, the two candidates who claim to possess the Resurrection Divine Art, resurrected your fear, the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan that is now attacking your country. Go and question your great leader!”

They heard Black Druggist’s voice, but his voice was recorded in advance. It was transmitted to everyone’s ears through some magical diffusion.

Black Druggist had been subdued, so he could not say anything.

“The saintess resurrected the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan?”

“The Golden Sun Tyrant Titan is dead but has come back to life. There are only two saintesses who know Resurrection Divine Art in this world.”

“Is this also a conspiracy?”

The Black Vatican was too good psychological manipulation. The citizens who had supported the two saintesses unconditionally became suspicious in this attack.

They had to question them! Who resurrected the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan from the dead?

“Hall Mother, the Black Vatican intends to turn the people against us and defame the Parthenon Temple,” said the Old Priest, Falmer, angrily.

Pamise’s face darkened. It was not just the two saintesses who were questioned. The first person to be questioned was the Hall Mother. It was she who declared the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan dead decades ago.

Then came the two saintesses who were suspected of resurrecting the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan. Finally, the Parthenon Temple as a whole would also be questioned.

“Salan! What a vicious woman!” The voice of the Hall Mother, Pamise, was full of murderous intent. She stared at the Black Druggist. “Kill him first!”

An Adjudicator walked to the Black Druggist. The Black Druggist smiled and showed no sign of fear.

“Pamise,” a woman suddenly called.

Few people in this world would directly address the Hall Mother by her name.

The voice belonged to one of the priests. A priestess wearing a black dress slowly took off her hat and revealed her face.

Hall Mother was shocked. She pointed at the priestess.

At this time, the Black Druggist was kneeling on the floor. He almost prostrated on the floor like a devout servant.

“Salan!” The Hall Mother gasped.

Salan, the Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican.

She revealed herself so blatantly!T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
