Johnson was extremely quick under the effects of the Fleeing Shadow. After taking out Jiang Yu, he immediately headed toward Reed.

Ai Jiangtu had just used Blink, so the spell was still on cooldown for a short time. When he discovered that Johnson had left the area, he immediately had a bad feeling apart. Blaming himself for being too careless, he had allowed his opponent to knock Jiang Yu out!

As Ai Jiangtu thought, Johnson was not trying to run away. He quickly showed up in front of Little Flame Belle.

He did not attack Little Flame Belle, but quickly cast the Nyx Regime. A great darkness soon loomed over the place, consuming it.

Little Flame Belle tried to stop the darkness from spreading further with her flames, but she was soon hit by a few shadow spikes that took her by surprise.

The shadow spikes sealed off Little Flame Belle’s movement and magic, preventing her from casting a single spell.

Johnson was incredibly smart, and each of his actions reflected the goal he had in mind. He had shown up just to seal off Little Flame Belle’s attacks. If Reed was attacked Little Flame Belle now, the creature would surely suffer serious injuries.

However, that was not what Johnson had in mind. He was well aware that taking out Mo Fan’s Contracted Beast was not enough to turn the tables. The only chance for the German team to win the match was Reed!

The Chinese team no longer had any defensive equipment. If he gave Reed a chance to cast the Hellish Flames, it would surely give their team the comeback they were looking for!

As such, Johnson did not bother wasting his time on Little Flame Belle. His only goal was to stop her from interrupting Reed’s channeling. The Nyx Regime was to ensure that the little creature was unable to find where Reed was in the pitch-black darkness!

“Reed, it’s all you now!” Johnson glanced at Reed and said in a serious voice.

“Leave it to me!” Reed clenched his teeth, turning the humiliation he had felt into raging flames.

The sinister, green flame engulfed Reed. His formidable aura combined with the dark magic, making him look even more terrifying!

The green flame that was like a little firefly in the darkness burned fiercer. Soon, a shocking meteorite appeared in the sky...

The meteorite looked extremely tiny at the start, but as the flames engulfing it spread further away while the meteorite gradually approached the ground. The people immediately realized how enormous the meteorite was. It felt like it was going to smash the entire city into a huge hole!

—

“We’re done for!” The supporters of the Chinese team inhaled deeply upon seeing the meteorite. They could not help but imagine the terrible fate that would befall the Chinese team.

The area-of-effect of the Hellish Flames was incredibly huge. Even the Healer Nanrong Ni would struggle to dodge it, and Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were right in the middle of it. Reed’s intention was very obvious: he was aiming to disqualify both Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan with the spell!

Mo Fan had already used his armor when he was flanked by the German team. Even if he was to cast the Fleeing Shadow now, he had no hope of escaping the area of the Hellish Flames either. If Mo Fan had learned Blink, he would be able to dodge the attack and even counterattack Reed, but unfortunately, he had not learned it yet.

What’s even worse was, Little Flame Belle was currently trapped in the darkness. If Little Flame Belle Possessed him, Mo Fan’s fire resistance would not be any weaker than his lightning resistance. He would at most suffer a slight injury even if the meteorite landed right on him.

However, Mo Fan was unsure if he could endure the attack without Little Flame Belle’s help!

The Hellish Flames seemed to be stronger than before. It was obvious that Reed had given his all by strengthening the spell with his magic equipment. Without the protection of magic equipment, Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Nanrong Ni stood no chance against it!

—

Ai Jiangtu was still pretty far away. He tried his best to regroup with his team, yet when he realized that he had no chance of making it, he immediately switched his focus to Fendy.

Ai Jiangtu was unable to stop the Hellish Flames. He could only take hold of the opportunity to eliminate the Wind Mage of the opposing team!

“I don’t have any magic equipment left,” Nanrong Ni said.

Zhao Manyan glanced at Mo Fan and saw the man was already accumulating his energy. He was unwilling to sit and wait for his defeat. It seemed like he was planning to fend off the incoming attack with violence. He was planning to attack the meteorite with his spell!

However, the meteorite was less than a hundred meters away. Even if Mo Fan attacked now, the impact would still inflict serious damage on them, thus it would not make much of a difference.

“Old Zhao, back off now, I’m going to smash it into pieces!” Mo Fan had finished accumulating his energy. He was about to soar into the sky like a bolt of lightning.

It was Mo Fan’s usual approach. He did not have any defensive spells to protect himself. If he could not dodge the attack, he would simply try and overcome the attack in a violent manner, regardless of the damage he would receive. Anything was better than standing there and watching the spell land on them like that!

“Back off my ass, if you trust me, just aim your attack at those two Germans!” Zhao Manyan had no intention of running away. He glared at the green meteorite that was rapidly approaching from the sky and said in a manly voice, “Damn it, with I, Zhao Manyan here, how could I let you take the hit for us? If even a single spout of flame lands on your head, my surname won’t be Zhao anymore!”

“You don’t have any magic equipment left,” Mo Fan said.

“Stop talking! The first sentence I want to hear from you when I wake up in the hospital, is that you’ve beaten the crap out of those Germans!” Zhao Manyan declared, as the golden wings on his back spread apart.

The wings flapped and launched Zhao Manyan into the air. His figure was shrouded by a golden glow as he went straight at the meteorite!

Mo Fan was startled. He could not believe it was the same Zhao Manyan that he knew...

The Zhao Manyan he knew was extremely scared of death. He was the last person that would sacrifice himself for the greater good. Even though they were currently in the middle of a match, and the assistant judges would intervene to save their lives, if their opponent’s spells were simply too powerful, there was a chance that they might die, too!

“Old Zhao, your spirit is so f**king touching!” Mo Fan felt a wild surge of emotions as he watched Zhao Manyan flying straight at the Hellish Flames.

As the saying went, one takes the behavior of one’s company. Mo Fan strongly believed that Zhao Manyan had been influenced by him, resulting in such a great transformation.

If that was the case, there was no way Mo Fan was going to let him down!

—

Zhao Manyan sprang up to a height of around eighty meters. Even the fire tongues of the green meteorite were bigger than him!

However, in Zhao Manyan’s eyes, the sinister, green glow around the destructive spell was an utter humiliation. He had finally found the path that was meant for him, and it had allowed him to make a name for himself in the tournament. How was it acceptable that this asshole’s Innate Talent could simply disregard the effort he had put into to learn his defensive spells?

“I would like to see how many layers of defense you can pass through!”

“Water Barrier: Circulation!”

“Water Curtain!”

“Light Protection: Sacred Shield!”

“Plummeting Rays: Sacred Armor!”

“Rock Iron Skin!”

“Totem Mark!”

Zhao Manyan cast all the defensive spells that stacked up as layers of defense on him as he rose into the sky. The magic glows of different colors combined into one, while the mark of the special container further strengthened the defense.

He also had two elemental rings that were able to boost the potency of his Light and Water Elements by twenty percent!

Finally, Zhao Manyan used the broken golden wings to wrap himself, turning him into a golden bullet flying at the terrifying meteorite with great momentum!

The Hellish Flames made contact with Zhao Manyan. The scorching heat almost set the man on fire. Luckily, the Rock Iron Skin prevented his skin from burning.

Zhao Manyan was even closer to the meteorite. The layers of defense on him were being peeled off continuously, as if they were mere pieces of paper!

“Water Barrier!” Zhao Manyan did not give up. He continued to cast defensive spells on himself.

However, despite the layers of defensive spells he had, regardless if they were a Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced Spell, the green flames easily passed through them and gradually approached his flesh.

Zhao Manyan clenched his teeth. He did not back away, but rammed right into the meteorite. The courage and boldness he displayed left the crowd in awe.

—

“You have a very impressive brother, Zhao Youqian, but why do I feel like you weren’t very proud of him, judging from how you always speak of him?”

“To be honest, I’m quite surprised myself,” Zhao Youqian replied.

“Aren’t you worried about him? His defense is nothing but air to the flames.”

“How can I not be worried...”

Pang Lai, who had been rather silent throughout the match, suddenly spoke. His eyes flickered with excitement, as if he had learned the secret of the sinister, green glow shrouding the incoming spell. He pointed at the Hellish Flames that were clearly fainter and said, “That guy’s Innate Talent doesn’t really ignore the defense! Each of the defensive spells is actually weakening it!”

The others immediately took a closer look, and discovered that not only was the aura of the meteorite falling, it was actually shrinking by a lot, too. It was actually weakening as it passed through each layer of Zhao Manyan’s defense!

——

The meteorite finally exploded around fifty meters above the ground. The flames spread in the air like brilliant fireworks.

The stage trembled, and among the pieces of the meteorite, a man engulfed in flames slammed into the ground close to the magic barrier.

An assistant judge immediately went up to the man and put out the flames burning him. He discovered that the man’s face was burned beyond recognition.

—

Mo Fan glanced over and saw the assistant judge carrying Zhao Manyan down the stage. He could not help but let out a sigh.

The two of them initially said they were only going to mess around on the national team. Their actual goal was to spread their seed across the world, to let the women of different countries experience the love and gentleness of a Chinese man. However, they had simply lost their minds and treated the match as a battle of pride. Mo Fan could not tell whether it was the challenges that Zhao Manyan had overcome during the training that changed his mind, or the speech that Chairman Shao Zheng gave that awakened his blood...

Either way, to fight in a battle like this actually felt a lot more pleasant than sharing their love with women of different countries. After all, they were basically going up against a few of the strongest countries in the world!
