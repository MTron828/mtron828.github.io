Chapter 2712: Dimensional Ring Toss Game

‘Black Phoenix Garment?’ wondered Mo Fan. He recalled her from the previous day in the temple, but she was dressed more colorfully then. ‘Is there a special meaning to her attire?’

He had to admit that the lady gave off a very confident and regal aura as though she was shrouded in nobility and mystery in her black outfit.

“Let’s go!” The rest of the group hadn’t heard Shu Xiaohua because the surrounding was already noisy.

They had not noticed the woman in black. Shu Xiaohua seemed to want to tell everyone, but Big Sister Ying glared at her. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The sky was clear, but it was cold. Ferns and grasses covering the coastal plain were shorter than before, and white frost clung to them.

The area was part of the South China Sea. The climate was warm, and the trees were always green. Even during the coldest solar term of winter, the mountains were covered in greenery without snow. They had never seen frost throughout the four seasons all year round. There were only one or two months of cold weather. The rest was summer.

The Emperor of the South Ocean’s cold calamity invaded the area and severely affected the warm south coast. Plants which could not resist the chill began to wither, and the plain gradually turned barren. Weeds were scarce even in the slightly moist soil.

“It’s been a long time since I ate a longan. I remembered there used to be a large longan plantation over here. One of my relatives planted it. Even though we’re not very close, I wonder where they have moved now,” Shu Xiaohua said sadly.

“You’re only good at one thing: eating. We’re almost running out of food, and yet you only think about eating longan!” Big Sister Ying rebuked her.

Shu Xiaohua stared at Mo Fan with large, sorrowful eyes. She slowed down deliberately to match his step. “Big Brother, what’s your expertise?” she whispered.

“Fire— Oh, it’s Summoning Element.” Mo Fan decided to correct himself.

“What is your summoned beast, then? All Summoning Element mages are unique. They often summon their beasts to show off. Why do you have to walk on your feet? Can’t you even summon a mount?” Shu Xiaohua asked.

Mo Fan scratched his head. He had released the Old Wolf and let it go hunting. He had no idea when it would return to him.

“Walking is tiring. Could you summon a soft and comfortable beast mount to carry us on the journey?” Shu Xiaohua asked again.

Mo Fan pondered over her words. It was certainly possible…

Dimensional summoning was not entirely fixed. With Mo Fan at his current level of cultivation, even though the Old Wolf had an activity outside, he could open the dimensional door once again.

“Don’t summon a fierce one. Demons are roaming somewhere nearby. It’s best that we keep a low profile as we move forward.” Big Sister Ying warned them.

The Summoning Element’s most basic skill was dimensional summoning. If one mastered it, one could be more powerful than the Intermediate mage or Super Level mage. After all, there were a lot of powerful beasts within the Summoned Beast Plane that could be summoned. So, Mo Fan had no idea what kind of beast would come out of it.

Mo Fan entered the Summoned Beast Plane. The higher his cultivation level, the clearer his state of soul travel would be. Even the summoning beasts within the Summoned Beast Plane sensed Mo Fan’s presence.

When they were young, Mo Fan took Mu Ningxue and Ye Xinxia to the night market. There was a stall where they played ring toss.

The rule of the ring toss game was fairly simple. The stall owner would provide the player with a standard wire ring, then he would ask the player to stand at a specific spot and toss the wire ring at a display of delicate, small crafts. If the player could get the ring to land on any of these things, they could take it for their own.

Before the arrival of a claw crane, Mo Fan had practiced hard in the ring toss game to win something for the ladies. He had not wasted his effort. He could use that talent in the dimensional summoning plane.

“Copper-horned Yak, maybe. It looks right for now.” Mo Fan located his target.

In fact, a variety of summoned beasts appeared before Mo Fan such as Fire Savage Scorpion, Unifying-eyed Evil beast, Magic Sonic Tyrant Antelope, Nine-star Sting, and other powerful living creatures. Nine-star Sting and Magic Sonic Tyrant Antelope were Commander Level beasts.

Certain Commander Level beasts were aggressive. If they accidentally dabbled into another horde’s territory, the demon horde would do everything to kill them in order to protect their territory. There was no need to get oneself into unnecessary trouble.

Mo Fan’s Super Level cultivation set him apart from the other levels. He could sense the Copper-horned Yak’s aggressiveness and its reluctance to become his mount in this world. However, Mo Fan had a large wire ring. So long his hand was not shaky, or he did not throw the ring blindly, he could tame the beast.

The moon rift gradually appeared, and a majestic Copper-horned Yak covered in extremely thick, brown fur walked out of it.

Its copper horns were surprisingly large, taking up a third of its body size. It looked magnificent! If a group of Copper-horned Yaks were used as vanguards during a war, they could easily pierce the enemy’s shield and trample them.

“Wow, it’s enormous! It’s very cute!” Shu Xiaohua could not wait to climb on it.

The Copper-horned Yak glared at Mo Fan. It had already learned how powerful Mo Fan was so it dared not go against him and obediently let the others ride on it.

“Big Sister Ying, come up here. Du Mei, you too! This big bull is nice to sit on and comfortably. It’s like sitting on a furry couch,” said Shu Xiaohua.

The tall lady was the leader among the group. When she saw the rest surrounding the Copper-horned Yak, she looked at Mo Fan helplessly.

The women seldom ventured out so they were wary of strangers and na?ve. They could be duped easily. Their leader figured as much.

“He needs to conserve his magic energy if he has to protect us!” she said. “Shu Xiaohua, keep those wicked ideas to yourself!”

“Big Sister Ruan, we haven’t gone too far yet. There won’t be any dangers around us.”

Big Sister Ruan was about to rebuke her again but she frowned as if she had noticed unusual movements. She wore mini wind chime bamboo earrings.

Mo Fan fixed his gaze on her. She focused on listening to her surroundings.

‘Sound Element?’ Mo Fan speculated. He remembered Nanyu looked the same when focusing on sound. Sound Element Mages often heard sounds that normal humans were not aware of.

Despite having a dragon sense and being extremely sensitive to his surroundings, he was slightly inferior to Sound Element Mages. Sound Element Mages could capture the sound of movement, loud noises, breath, and heartbeat, and many other things.

“Hurry up, something is following us.” Big Sister Ruan sounded aggravated.

Mo Fan sensed it, too. The small demons must have used some special tricks to hide themselves. Even though Mo Fan sensed their presence, he could not locate their exact location or find out how many of them were there.
