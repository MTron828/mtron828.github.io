The Scarlet Rending Demon rose to its feet unsteadily. It quickly grabbed the snow around it and rubbed its on its body to put out the fire.

It lowered its head and saw an obvious crack on the thick carapace on its chest. Its crimson eyes looked blank, then flickered with rage as the creature cast a glance at Mo Fan!

The Scarlet Rending Demon lunged forward like a crimson ray of light. It had dashed out of the frozen thickets in the blink of an eye. It clenched its hand into a fist and threw a punch at Mo Fan’s head!

The creature was trying to return the favor. With the strength of a Commander-level creature, the force of the punch was enough to shatter a huge rock into pieces!

The destructive scarlet gust of wind locked onto Mo Fan’s figure. Mo Fan tried to dodge the attack with Fleeing Shadow, yet somehow the attack was still able to lock onto him. The fierce gust of wind came right into his face. All his vision was filled by the gust of wind, bringing a strong pressure of death with it!

“Black Snake Armor!”

Mo Fan did not dare to hesitate further. He quickly summoned his life-saving Equipment.

The blue-black snake shadow split into ten shadows wrapping around Mo Fan’s arms, neck, head, body, legs. Almost instantly, snake scales covered his entire body, from his teeth to his ankles!

The gust of wind produced by the Scarlet Rending Demon’s struck Mo Fan. Even though he tried to dodge aside, he was still caught inside the terrifying gust of wind. It tried to rend him to shreds!

Luckily, Mo Fan had donned the Black Snake Armor in time. Otherwise, the attack was enough to kill him!

The creature was Commander-level, after all. Its strength far surpassed that of a Warrior-level creature. The ordinary defense Spells of Magicians were a mere decoration to it!

“Mo...Mo Fan!”

Nanyu was completely stunned. She quickly chased after Mo Fan when the gust of wind blew him away.

Mo Fan was knocked quite a far distance away. The scarlet wind continued to inflict damage to his body. Nanyu began to panic she failed to find Mo Fan’s corpse in the area.

Did the gust of wind seriously tear him into pieces? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’m...I’m here...” Mo Fan raised his hand from a ravine.

He was climbing up the edge laboriously, before flipping over and making his way back to the surface. He was lying flat on the ground with his face towards the sky.

“That son of a bitch, such a remarkable hit!” Mo Fan panted heavily.

It felt his sternum had been smashed flat by the impact. Every breath he took was hurting him.

“How are you still alive?” Nanyu was dumbfounded. She immediately inspected the Black Snake Armor.

The Black Snake Armor looked slightly sunken, but it did not break into pieces like Nanyu’s Shield of Lustrous Wood, even though most Shield Equipment had a higher resistance than Armor Equipment. Nanyu began to wonder what was Mo Fan’s armor made of. It looked like it could still endure a few more attacks!

“How could I die so easily? I’ve killed more than a handful of Commander-level creatures in the past. Do you really think that thing with a fish head can kill me?” Mo Fan managed to catch his breath.

Nanyu opened her mouth wide. She proceeded to ignore him, knowing that he was fine.

-A handful of Commander-level creatures? Couldn’t he be more logical when he was trying to bluff!-

“Look, I told you he wouldn’t die like that,” Zhao Manyan and Ai Jiangtu belatedly arrived.

Ai Jiangtu let out a relieved sigh when he learned that Mo Fan was fine. He turned around, glancing at the screaming Scarlet Rending Demon and said, “That creature isn’t an easy target. I’ll lure him away while you go and help the others. Kill all Scarlet Soaring Demons as quickly as possible, and we’ll eliminate this Commander-level creature together!”

Mo Fan, Nanyu, and Zhao Manyan nodded.

Ai Jiangtu had Blink, so the Scarlet Rending Demon would have trouble catching him despite its outstanding speed. Soon, Ai Jiangtu found himself in a chase with the Scarlet Rending Demon.

It was obvious that only he could keep the Scarlet Rending Demon busy. As he mentioned, their priority was to get rid of all the Scarlet Soaring Demons. They needed everyone’s help to kill the Commander-level Scarlet Rending Demon!

The three quickly left and headed toward Mu Ningxue.

The battlefield had moved to the edge of the islands. A few were already fighting the Scarlet Soaring Demons on the ice above the ocean!

The team stayed close to Mu Ningxue. Gong Yu was the closest to her. His speed was incredibly quick as he moved rapidly from Mu Ningxue’s left to right, and her back at times. Apart from the Scarlet Soaring Demons, the Sea Monkey Monsters had joined the fight too. These cunning creatures tried to seize the opportunity while the other Magicians were kept busy by the Scarlet Soaring Demons to kill Mu Ningxue, who was channeling the Ice Curse!

A ring of corpses was lying close to Mu Ningxue, mostly Gong Yu’s work.

Mo Fan was not happy. He was supposed to be the one looking after Mu Ningxue. This Gong Yu was utterly shameless to keep moving left and right in front of his big wife!

“I should go and get rid of that Gong Yu... oh, I mean I should go and protect Mu Ningxue. I’ll leave the rest to you two,” Mo Fan said to Nanyu and Zhao Manyan.

“Are you seriously fussing about it considering the nature of the situation!” yelled Nanyu.

“Are you jealous?” teased Mo Fan.

Nanyu gave him an icy gaze. Her lips curled up as she uttered, “Piss off!”

Gong Yu had appeared in three different spots in less than two seconds, stopping the Scarlet Soaring Demons that had tried to ambush Mu Ningxue.

“Don’t worry, with I, Gong Yu here, they won’t get any closer to you!” Gong Yu returned to Mu Ningxue’s side with a confident smile.

Mu Ningxue had her eyes closed. She was entirely focused on channeling the Spell.

She was aware of their distance to the ocean. Once the ice was broken, the seawater underneath would be revealed. It was necessary to make the ice thicker, as the Scarlet Soaring Demons would be a pain to deal with if they gained access to water!

“Xuexue, don’t worry, with I Mo Fan here, such an annoying pest will no longer bother you,” Mo Fan appeared with the same confident smile.

Unlike Gong Yu’s cautious approach, Mo Fan boldly walked up to Mu Ningxue and put his hand around her slim waist when she was entirely focused on channeling the Spell, to declare his ownership to Gong Yu!

“Put your filthy hand away!” Gong Yu was infuriated.

Mo Fan simply ignored his demand.

“Do you want to die?” a pleasant yet coldly murderous voice said.

Mo Fan awkwardly withdrew his hand and said, “You should focus more on channeling the Spell.”
