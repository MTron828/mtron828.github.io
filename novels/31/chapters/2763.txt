Chapter 2764: Stingray Legion

Low altitudes, especially below five thousand meters, were out of the question for the Green East Sea God. It was where the Green East Sea God patrolled.

From time to time, they could see stingrays with very long tails in the air. At first, Mo Fan thought Honolulu was holding a stingray kite competition. The stingrays were in the air all disorderly. The scene was almost spectacular.

After landing in the valley, Mo Fan turned into a Shadow Bird and was about to approach the group of people who were walking quietly.

Suddenly, the stingrays below the clouds moved toward him, and their eyes, which emitted red light, stared in his direction.

‘Are they after the people in the valley?’ thought Mo Fan. ‘No! They found me instead’. Mo Fan was shocked. Could these stingrays see through the concealment of Shadow Element?

Mo Fan started to move away from the valley, and the stingrays followed. Suddenly, the forest where Mo Fan was at began to dim. The stingrays had blocked the light!

They were indeed a group of Ocean Demons that were used to find Forbidden Mages. They were sensitive to all hidden methods. No wonder the group of people in the valley were so careful. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan opened the ancient magic portal and summoned a Dark Night Dream Beast. ‘Think of a way and help me divert them.’

The Dark Night Dream Beast was a night elf creature which looked like a deer. It had antlers like a dreamy tree and black hair, and it was an elf creature on the same level as Mighty Cliff Demon King.

Mo Fan did not need to combine with the Shadow Element. He just summoned it from the ancient magic portal and let it divert those stingrays.

He could summon the Dark Night Dream Beast back through the ancient magic portal, so he did not have to worry even if those stingrays surrounded the Dark Night Dream Beast. It could safely return to the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower.

This Summoned Beast was quite reliable. It first appeared and pretended to panic. Then, it escaped into the shadows and fled to the south through the trees. Those stingrays were sensitive to motion. They chased in the direction where the Dark Night Dream Beast ran.

Mo Fan stayed where he was and did not dare to move. The Shadow Element could still give his location away. If he stayed still, he might be able to conceal himself completely. A Light Element Mage with high cultivation might not be able to locate a Shadow Element user who stayed still.

Mo Fan was very patient. He waited until all the stingrays followed the Dark Night Dream Beast. He then tried walking very slowly.

‘I mustn’t underestimate these Ocean Demons. Most of them who came here are the elites under the Black Claw Emperor.’ Mo Fan let out a sigh of relief.

Only after entering the valley did he move freely. The valley would provide cover. The Dark Night Dream Beast had completed its mission. Mo Fan opened the ancient magic portal and recalled it to the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower.

“Who is it?

“Who is approaching?”

A voice rang out. Mo Fan was stunned. How had they discovered him? Was his concealment really this poor?

Mo Fan did away with the concealment and walked towards the group of people.He saw an old acquaintance with a long beard and old wrinkles on his face. However, he still looked energetic.

“Mo Fan, it’s you!” Pang Lai said in surprise.

“What a pleasant surprise!” Mo Fan smiled.

.

“Oh my, Mo Fan, it’s been a long time!” Jiang Yu squeezed through the crowd and ran to him. He gave Mo Fan a big hug.

Mo Fan was surprised to see him here as well. However, it wasn’t so unusual.Jiang Yu was Pang Lai’s direct disciple. If Pang Lai was here, it was not uncommon for him to be on the team.

“What are you doing here?” Mo Fan asked in confusion.

“We are here to rescue a Forbidden Mage. He is trapped…”

“Jiang Yu!” A mature woman said sternly.

Mo Fan saw a woman in her thirties. She was tall, thin, and had a stern face. She gave people the impression that she was in charge.

“What a coincidence. I’m here to rescue a Forbidden Mage as well,” Mo Fan said a smile.

The stern woman walked over and stood in front of Jiang Yu. Her eyes were sharp. “Do you think we will believe that a rescue team only has one person?”

“Ye Mei, this is Mo Fan, the winner of the World College Tournament. He is a trustworthy person, so you don’t have to be so nervous,” Pang Lai said.

“The rescue is not a game or a trial for young people. The Stingray Legion was leaning toward us just now. They probably noticed when he entered the valley. Hmph.” Ye Mei was still wary of Mo Fan.

“All right, I promise that there won’t be any more problems. Mo Fan, why are you here?” Pang Lai was still very gentle and friendly to Mo Fan. It was just like way back when he used to be his student.

“Well, I received a mission at a critical and difficult moment,” Mo Fan replied.

“I’m happy that you came.” Pang Lai pulled Mo Fan aside. He lowered his voice. “This matter is urgent. Our country’s Forbidden Mages have to supervise in the key base cities, so it is difficult to transfer them. I thought there was little hope this time, but I forgot about your existence. What do you think of turning into a demon?”

“Old Pang, to tell the truth, my Essence Orb is almost empty now, and I haven’t recovered from the sequelae of the last time yet,” Mo Fan replied with a bitter smile.

It was no wonder that Pang Lai was so excited when he saw Mo Fan. It turned out that he was hoping that Mo Fan could turn into a demon.

Pang Lai was speechless. The expectation and joy were fading from his face.

“What are you doing here then?”asked Pang Lai.

Mo Fan did not know how to answer. He thought carefully about it. ‘Was Tang Zhong also hoping that I could turn into a demon and complete the mission?’

“To tell you the truth, it doesn’t matter. I am here now, and Jiang Yu is here as well. And you! It’s so nice to meet you all.”

Pang Lai glared at Mo Fan. “His Night Rakshasa can find Commander Hua. The life of Commander Hua is more important than Jiang Yu’s life, after all.”

“Master…” Jiang Yu said.

“Shut up. I said I only wanted the Night Rakshasa to come, and you didn’t have to follow.”

“How could I let Night Rakshasa come to take risks alone? It is my Contracted Beast,” Jiang Yu said.

“You are worried about your cat, and you don’t care about me at all, right?” Pang Lai said angrily.
