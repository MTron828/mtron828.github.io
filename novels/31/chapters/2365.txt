Mu Bai’s hands were wrapped in bandages. He could not even receive the things from Mo Fan.

“I obtained them from a general of the Brown Rebels; an ice brush and an ice palette. I think you will be better at using them than him,” Mo Fan told him.

Mu Bai could tell they were no ordinary artifacts at first glance. He had an urge to grow a new pair of hands right now to test them out!

Mo Fan had thought the ice brush and ice palette were part of White Leopard’s Super Power. To his surprise, he had found the two valuables on the ground after killing White Leopard.

Mo Fan had witnessed the power of the ice brush and the ice palette. It was a pity he could not use them, but Mu Bai was the perfect new owner for them!

“I also found something useful on the Venomous Insect Shamans. You can try using them on your wolves,” Mu Bai replied.

Mo Fan nodded.

He looked at Zhao Manyan and saw he was still searching through the bag with Wu Ku’s remains.

Zhao Manyan had gone through life and death with him. The three Fundamental Water Crystals were still in his Space Bracelet. He was a little unwilling, but he decided to give them to Zhao Manyan.

“Wow! Mo Fan, you are truly my brother. I’ll be taking this then, if you’ve given Mu Bai something so precious!” Zhao Manyan suddenly yelled.

Mo Fan was just about to hand over the three Water Fundamental Crystals. He was confused by Zhao Manyan’s words. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He turned around and saw Zhao Manyan had almost stuck his whole head into the body bag.

When Zhao Manyan moved his head out of the body bag, he was holding a pile of black ash in his hand. Mo Fan took a closer look and saw some round objects in the ash.

“Bone ash pearls? Did Wu Ku have sariras, too?” Mo Fan blurted out.

“It’s his Water Prayer Beads. I was wondering how he was able to control the water in such a strange manner the last time I saw him. He shouldn’t have been able to control water so freely, even with his Innate Talent. As I thought, he had something precious on him!” Zhao Manyan was overjoyed.

Mo Fan was surprised. He had not checked Wu Ku’s remains thoroughly.

“Are the Water Prayer Beads his Lifetime Vessel?” Mo Fan wondered aloud.

“A Lifetime Vessel will disappear after their owner is dead. These things are more like Deathstrike Magic Equipment, but unlike Deathstrike Magic Equipment, they are a kind of proprietary Equipment. Only a Mage with a Super Power would have them!” Zhao Manyan explained.

“Oh,” Mo Fan nodded indifferently.

“I’ll explain the details to you again another time. Anyway, I don’t want anything else. I just want these!” Zhao Manyan acted like he had found something precious.

Mo Fan nodded. He quietly put the Fundamental Water Crystals back into his Space Bracelet.

He happened to be running short on funds, too. There was no reason for him to give the Fundamental Water Crystals to a rich guy like Zhao Manyan.

He was thinking of selling the Fundamental Water Crystals and using the funds to buy some defensive Equipment for himself.

Mason came over and yelled in excitement, “HAHAHA, you’re all here! Without your help, the Federation Army would still be fighting a hard battle now!”

“It’s you, Mason. Don’t forget us if you manage to make a great name for yourself in the Federation,” Mo Fan sighed.

“Of course, I’ll ask someone to build statues of you in the territory I just received right away! No one will dare look down on me again!” Mason exclaimed.

“...”

“By the way, Brigadier General Blair is looking for you. Didn’t you say you were interested in the Crusaders’ magic? He has already gotten approval from his superiors. You have done the Federation Army a huge favor. Since you didn’t want a promotion as your reward, the army is more than willing to let you learn the Crusaders’ magic in return!” Mason informed him grandly.

“That’s great,” Mo Fan smiled. The Cross Chaos Formation was the most practical reward for him!

“General, General Zhao, why are you crouching in the middle of the road? The Eagle Horse Skyriders are waiting to offer you a toast to celebrate our victory!” A few Eagle Horse Skyriders approached Zhao Manyan. They were treating him with great respect.

“You guys can go ahead and celebrate without me. I need a rest,” Zhao Manyan waved his hand.

Mo Fan and Mu Bai looked at Zhao Manyan in surprise.

Zhao Manyan straightened his chest proudly, “What? Can’t I convince a regiment of riders with my strength?”

The Eagle Horse Skyriders had great respect for Zhao Manyan. It seemed like he was the main reason why more than three hundred of the Eagle Horse Skyriders had survived to the end.

“We’ve told the women in our army of your heroic achievements. They all said they want to meet you in person. Are you sure you don’t want to come with us?” an Eagle Horse Skyrider grinned.

“Lead the way!” Zhao Manyan immediately crawled back to his feet in high spirits.

He had promised himself he would have a ‘sixsome’ if he survived the war!

The women soldiers of the Federation Army in their magnificent shirts, tight skirts, and stern-looking berets; he could finally have a taste of friendly South Americans as he pleased!

Zhao Manyan wanted to bring Mo Fan and Mu Bai along with him.

Mu Bai was clearly more interested in the ice brush and the ice palette than the beauties of the Federation Army, and Mo Fan was already at his limit. He just wanted to find a comfortable place to sleep for three days and nights.

——

Mo Fan arrived at the Federation’s Feihai City. The city was one of the greatest foundations of the Federation. It was only inferior to the capital, and was an important strategic city for defending the country from the sea monsters.

Mo Fan was asleep the entire journey. He had private jets, armored tanks, and bodyguards escorting him.

Mo Fan’s achievement of killing Ice Tiger and White Leopard had already spread across the Federation. The soldiers were treating him like their own general.

—

It was dark by the time Mo Fan woke up.

Mo Fan had no clue how many days had passed. He found himself in a military base. He was served with great delicacies by a few nurses who had been appointed to take good care of him.

“General!”

“General!”

A dark-skinned man came up to Mo Fan. He almost thought the man was Mason until he noticed the man had a bulkier build.

“I heard you didn’t want any official rank as a reward, but our army insists on rewarding you. If we can’t give someone who has rendered great contributions to the army like you a satisfying reward, we won’t be able to convince the others who want to serve us,” the general informed him.

“The orphanages set up by the Alps Institute, do you know about them?” Mo Fan asked him.

“I’ve heard of them before, but our country won’t look after people who aren’t going to serve us. They are future flowers of the Alps Institute, not the Federation,” the general replied.

The Federation needed Mages and more power, people like Mo Fan who could defeat their enemies!

Many young Mages did not acknowledge that they were members of the Federation, especially the families of the Brown Rebels. The Federation Army was still having trouble looking after the direct families of their own soldiers. They had no time to waste on orphans who were not going to contribute to the country!

“You may give the land you have allocated to me to them. After all, they are just kids with no one to rely on. They lost their homes to the invasion of the sea monsters and the war,” Mo Fan said.

“That’s fine, we’ve given you the land.. What you do with it is your business,” the general agreed.
