The Lanyang Drinking Water Plant.

Many places in the city were covered by the frost overnight.

However, the Lanyang Drinking Water Plant did not have any sign of frost. Xinxia, Lingling, and Jiang Shaoxu searched the plant thoroughly, and discovered some pipes extending to the sea.

The pipes crossed a hill and plunged into the sea. A huge machine was close to the sea. It was pumping the seawater into a huge underground reservoir before the water was delivered to the plant.

‘The underground reservoir was very deep, like an underground cave connected with the ocean. Below the cave was even an underwater world, right under the city’s foundations!

It was difficult to imagine a completely different world had existed under such a big city.

“We’ll figure out a way to go down after they get here,” Lingling said.

After finding the source of the drinking water for the plant, Lingling speculated that the underground sea had the answers to why the people of Lanyang did not catch the Low Body Temperature Disease. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Should we head down first? We aren’t sure how long they will take to come back here. I can do some basic exploration to see what’s down there,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“Tll go with you,” Xinxia said.

“Mm, we can support one another. Lingling, you’ll stay here and guide us,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“Well…”

“It’s fine, we aren’t some weak and delicate women. I can even make a Ruler-level creature obey me!” Jiang Shaoxu declared confidently.

“Fine…”

Cypress Moon Hotel.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan looked into the sky. It was already dark, but Zhao Manyan’s Contract Beast was still searching for food. It was giving them a huge headache.

Left with no choice, Mo Fan could only take a little risk to capture a Great Commander-level Sharkman Beast.

The Sharkman Beasts were also classified into different levels. Those whose bodies were fully wrapped in metal alloy were Ruler-level creatures. Their size was close to that of a stadium. Mo Fan would surely end up attracting the attention of other Sharkmen if he fought them.

‘Mo Fan ended up choosing a Black-Skinned Sharkman Beast. He asked Apas to control its mind and lure it into the Cypress Moon Hotel to feed Zhao Manyan’s new Contracted Beast.

Mo Fan had now seen how special the creature was. It was growing while eating! It was around the size of a whale before eating the Sharkman Beast, but it had already grown to the size of a tour boat after it was done eating!

“Go take a sleep in the Contract Ring. I have something serious to take care of,” Zhao Manyan pleaded.

‘The creature finally nodded. It went into the Contract Ring with great satisfaction.

Zhao Manyan let out a relieved sigh when the creature finally disappeared.

Why couldn’t he control his own hands? Why did he try to see if he could make it his Contract Beast?

In the end… The creature that could eat so much was depending on him to feed it!

“You will have to prepare food measured in tons just to feed it.” Mo Fan was rather speechless.

Zhao Manyan was a true genius to find himself such a unique Contracted Beast!

‘The creature had already eaten so much on the first day it was born. Once it grew more, Zhao Manyan would go bankrupt just from feeding it!

“Don’t bring it up again, I’m tired. I found some information in the Lanyang Institute. Their logo originates from a place called the Lanyang Earth Core. It’s an ancient underground temple that has been around for more than a thousand years,” Zhao Manyan reported.

“An ancient temple. Do you know where it is?” Mo Fan asked him.

“It’s right under our feet,” a voice suddenly interjected.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan turned to the voice and saw a man in a white outfit approaching them. His hair was gelled to look stylish.

‘The man was none other than Mu Bai. Judging from the proud grin on his face, he must have made the biggest discovery among them!

Mu Bai walked through the entrance that had been sealed off by a magic Barrier. He was stunned when he saw all the bloody remains in the area.

“Why did you two kill so many Sharkmen?” Mu Bai had to ask.

“They were eaten.”

“Eaten?”

“Can we not talk about something that isn’t important for now? Do you know where the Lanyang Earth Core is?” Zhao Manyan interrupted impatiently.

“Yes, this city also has a lot of people who are being hunted. I was wondering where I could bring them to. This place is quite hidden. Can I bring them here?” Mu Bai asked.

‘Mu Bai was actually a kind man. He had discovered many survivors who were abandoned while he was moving around the city. He gathered them and offered them protection.

“Bring them here then,” Mo Fan glanced at Guan Songdi.

Guan Songdi immediately panicked.

After all, they could not just turn a blind eye to the survivors. They put the topic of the Lanyang Earth Core aside and settled the survivors in the hotel, protecting them with a hidden Barrier of the Light Element.

‘There were around fifteen survivors, all the same as Guan Songdi. They were all worn out from being chased by the Sharkmen. They were relieved after finally finding a safe place to hide in.

“Didn’t our Bo City have an Underground Holy Spring? It provided Mages with a special place to meditate in. The Lanyang Earth Core is similar to the Underground Holy Spring. It provides Mages with a special pond which they could meditate in. Their cultivation would improve greatly,” Mu Bai finally

explained what he knew about the Lanyang Earth Core.

“It must be related to the Mysterious Feather Totem Beast. Let’s go check it out!” Mo Fan urged them.

“The Lanyang Earth Core has been around for a thousand years, just like the Underground Holy Spring. Only a few people know how to access it. Even those who meditated in it before had no idea how to find it. We only know it’s under the city,” Mu Bai sighed, shaking his head.

Lanyang was a huge city with six districts, each district around the size of a single Bo City. It was not going to be easy to find the hidden entrance to the Lanyang Earth Core!

Many people in Bo City knew of the existence of the Underground Holy Spring, but they would never expect it to be right under the Silver Commerce Tower.

Similarly, many people knew about the existence of Lanyang’s special place, but its exact location was kept confidential!
