General Ethan was in the glass corridor outside the command hall in the Square Tower. The whole battlefield was filled with destructive spells. A strong wind with a unique smell to it blew across the battlefield.

It was only the first day. The army at the front line would not have any problems holding their ground if the troops stuck to his arrangements. The battle had only just begun, and many generals were currently at the front line. He just needed to choose one that he was not that fond of to be in charge at the front line...

“Gangma, yours is the only face the snake demons recognize. Rest up for now, and as soon as the sun rises tomorrow morning, return the young Medusa to the Sunset Shrine. That will get rid of the threat the snake demons pose to us. It’s time for us to teach these undead some lessons!” Ethan said.

Gangma quickly saluted acknowledgement of the order. He asked in a mocking tone, “What happened to the guy?”

“Killing isn’t the only way to get rid of a person. Some people are like sparrows. When the eagle displays its wings and sharp claws, the sparrow that knows its place will stop hopping between the branches and hanging around in the eagle’s territory. No young man can get himself together after learning about the country and the person I am!” Ethan declared firmly.

“Commander is impressive as usual; you’ve perfectly dealt with the problem without sacrificing a single soldier,” Gangma fawned upon his superior.

“I know his kind too well. I was like him when I was younger. A person like him has a great weakness, in that they always struggle to accept the brutal truth. When I revealed the beliefs of the majority and compare them to his naive thoughts, he’s only going to crush his own beliefs. After all, even people with heroic ambitions are weak in their hearts! They might seem to be strong and determined, but it’s only because they haven’t encountered a natural storm that forced even the eagles to flee for their lives without any hesitation,” Ethan stated confidently.

Ethan did not threaten Mo Fan with his power and strength, nor did he drive the young man away with force. He simply told Mo Fan the truth and showed him the tip of the iceberg, the calm before the storm that was about to descend upon Egypt. It was as simple as that. The self-realization of how insignificant he was was enough to crush him!

The young man had no idea of his own place!

Most ridiculously, the young man actually believed a man like him did not deserve to live in this world. Why didn’t he go and ask the people of Cairo, and see how many of them were praying to their gods that he would live for another thousand years, just so Cairo would remain peaceful as it did while he was around, allowing them and their descendants to enjoy the luxury, calm, and peace in the city!

“Commander, I’m utterly impressed by you. However, I’m feeling a little uncomfortable knowing that he wasn’t actually punished for what he did.” Gangma’s eyes flickered viciously. He said, “I was going to accuse them of being members of the Black Vatican to shut them up.”

“Gangma, I’m confident of your capabilities, yet I don’t like how stubborn you are when it comes to getting revenge. Forget about it, and don’t provoke the kid any further, or it will bring us a lot of trouble,” Ethan warned him.

“Does he have a formidable background?” Gangma asked curiously.

“It’s not necessarily his background, it’s trickier than that. Just forget it, he’s no longer our problem. Let’s not be fussed about him anymore. Cairo needs us, doesn’t it?” Ethan smiled.

“You’re right, Commander. I will escort the young Medusa to the Sunset Shrine,” Gangma nodded.

Gangma left the corridor, still holding a strong grudge.

Was he really going to forget about it? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Even though Gangma had no idea why General Ethan did not want to provoke the kid called Mo Fan any further, he was not done with Mo Fan yet. He had to teach the kid a lesson!

Gangma was still thinking of how he should take revenge on Mo Fan. He did not notice Sayed passing by him. When their shadows crossed paths, something black as a phantom crept up behind Gangma...

Gangma was carrying some Dark Material. When more Dark Material was transferred to him, the shadow behind him immediately behaved eerily.

A Rebelling Shadow slowly rose from the ground while Gangma was coming up with a plan. The beautiful girl named Heidi suddenly crossed his mind. He decided to get his revenge through her. No man could stand their partner or friend being abused and stained with some sticky substance...

“I’m not allowed to touch that kid, but it won’t be a problem if I lay my hands on that blue-eyed beauty!” Gangma grinned in dark expectation.

His body twitched all of a sudden. A great chill came from the back of his neck. It spread rapidly through his veins, muscles, and skin!

Gangma’s eyes widened. A dark substance was filling in the lines in his pupils, a ghastly sight!

He turned around stiffly to see who the culprit was, yet there was nothing but darkness. He had lost his vision to the Dark Material. He could barely see a black outline of himself standing in front of him. It felt like he was looking into a mirror, but his reflection was pitch-black. It was placing a black dagger to his throat...

Dark Wither!

His body was wilting as if he had been injected with a deadly poison. His vital organs, including his heart, were failing. His life was being drained away rapidly.

“Gangma... why are you looking at me?

“Gangma? Gangma!

“Someone, help, there’s an assassin!” Sayed’s scream echoed through the building.

Gangma was grabbing Sayed by his shirt. He could feel his life being drained away, and was struggling to believe it. He clutched Sayed with all his might. He assumed Sayed was the person that was trying to kill him!

Sayed began to panic. He saw Gangma walking past him healthily just a few seconds ago, yet the man had ended up like this in such a brief period of time!

Gangma’s appearance was frightening. His hollow pupils had black lines around them, like spiderwebs. His skin had cracked open, while his body was releasing a pungent smell, like something had rotted!

A patrol soon showed up. They tried looking for the assassin like headless flies, but found nothing after conducting a search.

There was no assassin. The real culprit was quite a distance away from the scene. These young soldiers and the clumsy Sayed could not picture the Fiendish Night’s ability to kill someone like a phantom!

Boots tapped heavily on the floor. General Ethan, wearing a huge coat embroidered with white and golden silk, came up after hearing the scream. He was followed by four major generals. They were deciding a strategy for the upcoming battle.

General Ethan stared coldly at Gangma, who was now lying on the ground. His face started twitching slightly.

Gangma was one of Ethan’s favorite subordinates. He had completed all the tasks that Ethan did not want anyone to know about. He had to admit that Gangma was a maniac, yet he needed someone like Gangma serving him in order to win the war!

Gangma seemed to know that Ethan was around. He tried his best to utter, “Help...help me...”

Ethan did not step forward. He simply stared at the man on the ground.

Dark Wither... the magic was scarier than some Curses. The victim had no chance of living unless a Muse or higher rank from the Parthenon Temple was around!

Gangma could only blame it on himself. He knew the guy was a Shadow Mage, yet he did not bother purifying his body, allowing the Dark Material to take his life!

The experienced Ethan immediately realized the force behind Gangma’s death.

The truth was, Ethan was not angry because of Gangma’s death. He had no problem finding another maniac to replace Gangma. However, he could not stand the little sparrow that was actually trying to provoke the eagle!

The kid still did not learn his place. He had completely ignored everything Ethan had said!

Why was there someone so stupid? How did someone like him manage to live in this world for so long, when only the fittest can survive?

“It seems like God is asking me to take care of this strange existence that doesn’t want to obey the rules!” Ethan said coldly.

Mo Fan was quite similar to Ethan in many ways. The authorities had high hopes for him, despite his young age. Ethan did not trouble Mo Fan, because he knew the kid would bring him a lot of trouble if he did. On top of that, seeing Mo Fan reminded him of his younger self.

He believed that if Mo Fan learned the rules, he could easily secure himself a place as an authority in his own homeland. They might even have the chance to work together. The kid would thank him for teaching him an important lesson!

In the end, the kid insisted on walking his own path, the path that was going against the entire world!

Who did he think he was?! A hero? A savior?

He was trying to stir up a war being waged by an entire species, just to save a little girl’s life! The little girl’s relatives might be grateful for what he did, but tens of thousands of people in Cairo were going to curse him!

He knew nothing. Izisha was right, the kid was nothing but a disaster! He should have stopped him from entering Egypt at all costs. He should have turned him into ashes with a single slap when he had the chance!...

“Commander...” a captain ran up to Ethan. He whispered some words into Ethan’s ear when he saw there were quite a few people around.

“That is ridiculous! How could they possibly agree to such an insane plan? Is that old man out of his mind?” Ethan cursed angrily.

Mo Fan’s action had made himself Ethan’s enemy, so Ethan would no longer show any mercy to him. To think that the kid actually chose the path that would lead him to Hell... However, to Ethan’s surprise, even Haken had agreed to Mo Fan’s plan, meaning that the old man was clearly going to protect the kid!
