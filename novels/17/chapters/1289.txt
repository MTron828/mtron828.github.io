"Look..."

"That's the Bloody Succubus Lilith..."

"Lilith really came!"

"Of course she came, you dumbass! No matter what the Bloody Succubus is part of our Demonic Army at the end of the day."

"I wonder if His Majesty Lucifer will punish her..."

"Punish her? Hmph! From my point of view, she should be rewarded instead!"

"That's right! It was she who despite being a Sixth Order soul evolver killed that damned Seventh Order fire pigeon!"

...

As Lilith followed Fire Sorrow through the long, labyrinthine corridors of the castle on top of the Demon King Mountain, thousands of eyes secretly or directly looked at her after she passed them. Those intense gazes that carried amazement, lust, desire, love, fear, shock, surprise, and many other emotions followed her until her figure disappeared after several twists and turns.

Fire Sorrow sighed in her heart as she listened to the endless conversations among the faction members. She looked over her shoulder at Lilith as she continued her pace and said with a wry smile, "I'm willing to bet that from today onwards you will be the greatest legend in the entire Demonic Army only below His Majesty."

Lilith rolled her eyes charmingly unaware that this involuntary action of hers drove thousands of males and hundreds of females secretly watching her crazy. She groaned under her breath, "This kind of fame is not something I like, kick it off!"

"Who sent you to perform high profile?" Fire Sorrow shook her head, turning her attention back to the front and saying softly, "Putting that aside for now... Lilith, are you sure about coming? Once the war starts everyone will target you so it's likely that even we won't be able to protect you properly."

Although Fire Sorrow knew that Lilith was very powerful, it was impossible for a single person to take on numerous Seventh Order soul evolvers. Furthermore, Lilith had not only used up her two Firmament Fragments but was also injured so the majority of her most powerful skills were probably still on cooldown.

"It's okay," Lilith shook her head without saying much about it.

Fire Sorrow looked back slightly over her shoulder and saw Lilith caressing the necklace that Bai Zemin had given her before they left Earth. Despite not understanding why on the world Lilith would take off her previous necklace which was clearly a high- level treasure in exchange for a seemingly normal necklace without many stats or skills, Fire Sorrow didn't ask questions about it.

"Do you by any chance have some other Firmament Fragment to help you in the battle to come?"

"... Do you think Firmament Fragments are easy to obtain and you can casually pick them up as if they were tree branches?" Lilith almost fainted when she heard Fire Sorrow's question.

She had paid a high price in the past to get those two Firmament Fragments in her possession then how could she have a third!

Fire Sorrow stared blankly before smiling bitterly and shaking her head, "Forget what I said."

Even she didn't have a Firmament Fragment until now, so her previous question was in fact stupid. It was just that Fire Sorrow had subconsciously stopped treating Lilith as someone "normal" after everything she learned about her recently.

A while later, the duo arrived in front of the huge double stone door that connected to the inside of the meeting room. Fire Sorrow glanced at Lilith before opening the door and stepping inside.

...

"Lilith!" Crow jumped to his feet and looked at the woman he had dreamed about countless times with a complicated expression on his face. This woman was his greatest driving force of lust and the one he most craved in a way he had never craved anyone before and yet, Crow felt that she was a hot potato he dared not touch at this point.

Lilith nodded indifferently and her cold eyes calmly swept the room.

Hellscar was looking at her with bright eyes.

Valiant nodded in greeting with a calm expression as usual.

Luciah looked indifferent and casual as she didn't even move from her place but continued to apply basic maintenance to her black spear.

"What are you doing here? I don't remember calling you back." Lucifer frowned and asked directly.

Lilith looked at him with a calm expression and walked silently to the seat that rightfully belonged to her within this room. After settling in, she opened her mouth and slowly said, "I am part of the Demonic Army hence naturally I must come."

Luciah who had been silent raised her head slightly and shot her a casual glance before continuing with what she was doing. Although this was a seemingly random and uncaring gesture, anyone who knew her well enough could tell that Lilith's words made her feel satisfied.

"Instead of helping I'm afraid you'll make more trouble." Lucifer rolled his eyes and snarled at Fire Sorrow, "Why did you let her come?"

"It's not like I could stop her anyway." Fire Sorrow shrugged and took a seat to the right of him.

Lucifer rolled his eyes again but didn't continue even though he knew Fire Sorrow was making cheap excuses that even a five-year-old wouldn't buy.

If it were under normal circumstances, Fire Sorrow might have a hard time fighting Lilith to contain her. However, Lucifer was willing to bet 1000 hours of sleep that the current Lilith wasn't that strong as she was probably forced to pull out almost if not all of her hidden cards to kill Michael.

Defeating an archangel was a thing; killing one was something else entirely and utterly different!

Lucifer gazed at Lilith for a long time before asking in a casual voice as he relaxed in his seat, "So, what should we call you now? Your real name is Shangguan Bing Xue or Wu Yijun? Or maybe you're someone else?"

Lilith's eyes widened slightly as did her sweet little mouth. A weird light flashed in her ruby-colored eyes and, for the first time since joining the Demonic Army, a beautiful smile bloomed on her unmatched face.

"Your Majesty Lucifer, that's the first thing you ask after the pigeons spread such great news?" Lilith let out a playful giggle and the frosty expression covering her face disappeared without a trace.

For a moment, the entire room fell into total silence.

"Ugh..." Hellscar grunted as he awoke from his daydream and quickly looked away as he groaned, "Bloody Succubus, could you hold back your Charm? Are we allies or not? I'm not guarding against you so try not to enslave me!"

Crow seemed somewhat reluctant as he enjoyed the sentiment very much but unwillingly turned away as well.

Valiant shook her head and the corners of her lips curved imperceptibly upwards.

In the room, only Lucifer, Luciah, and Fire Sorrow had no reaction to Lilith's fairy-like smile.

"But, it looks like what you know about alternate dimensions isn't much after all," Lilith said with a sigh.

"What do you mean?" Lucifer raised both brows in surprise.

Even Luciah put away her spear and looked pointedly at Lilith.

"My name is neither Shangguan Bing Xue nor Wu Yijun. Nor is it Meng Qi or Feng Tian Wu or any of those girls' names." Lilith replied with a sincere expression on her face. Her eyes were like open windows to her soul and the others could see no trace of a lie as she said, "Your Majesty Lucifer knows that my original race is not human since you saw me when I was still at the top of the Fourth Order, don't you?"

"... Indeed." Lucifer nodded and his memory flashed back to a little over a decade ago.

Back then when he appeared in front of Lilith to extend his hand and invite her to join the Demonic Army, she had turned all the soldiers and even the Emperor of a great empire into her puppets. Lucifer would always remember that noble Charm and those sky-blue eyes that didn't even waver in front of him.

"I apologize but I want the first person to hear my true name to be him." Lilith bowed her head slightly and said in a sincere voice.

Lucifer was inwardly surprised and his eyes shone mysteriously. After a long time, he nodded and slowly said, "This is the first time you lower your head sincerely and not out of mere formality."

" ... I apologize." Lilith smiled bitterly and shook her head.

"You've changed too," Lucifer sighed and a glint of light flashed in his eyes again as he said to himself, "Everyone changes and becomes happier and better versions of themselves after spending some time together with that man."

Lilith naturally knew that Lucifer was not strictly referring to Bai Zemin when he said "that man" but was probably talking about Sirius, his old friend and perhaps rival in some areas. However, Lilith knew things that Lucifer did not.

Unless Sirius had achieved very great and majestic things after arriving in the Golden Domain, Bai Zemin absolutely could not be the reincarnation of the Heavenly Wolf; Lilith was 100% sure of this after her conversation with the Flame of Burning Wrath.

Lucifer was about to say something else when suddenly his expression turned serious with his eyes fixed on the castle ceiling as if he was looking at the sky beyond.

"Lucifer, you brat, I only slept for a couple of months but you already caused more trouble?" from the castle walls, an ancient and old voice sounded inside the room.

At the same time, the entire castle began to tremble slightly and the stone walls lit up as all the walls on the outside and the magic towers lit up. In an instant, an aura similar to that of a released tyrannosaurus flooded the entire Demon Lord Mountain and covered the sky.

"Don't complain, Alastar. Didn't you used to like parties?" Lucifer stood up, followed by the others.

"What parties or a demon," Alastar, Lucifer's Soul Armament, grumbled again. Despite its complaints, the aura around it only increased, "Just hurry up and kill all those pesky creatures so I can get back to resting... Just remember I still haven't fully recovered since the last battle with those brats from the Golden Domain!"

Lucifer nodded signifying his understanding before speaking to those in the room, "I'll go first. Sorrow and the others prepare the troops for battle. I want to see who gave them the guts!"

Saying that, Lucifer turned into lightning and shot out the window directly.

"See you in the sky." Luciah nodded towards the rest before following him without hesitation.

Fire Sorrow took a deep breath and her whole aura changed as she said in a voice that left no room for refusals, "Move along, all of you."

Crow and the others nodded, following Fire Sorrow and beginning to give orders one after another to the Sixth Order generals so that they would pass them on to the Fifth Order soldiers. Since this was their home world, the amount of advanced weapons and attack arrays were numerous and deep so some battle methods were bound to be different from when they clashed in neutral territory.

Lilith gazed up at the sky and a mysterious light flashed through her eyes before she quickly followed Fire Sorrow.

-Obion World.

When Bai Zemin opened the door of his room he found his personal housekeeper waiting at the side of the corridor.

"Big Sister Qin Ming, did some kind of trouble arise?"Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Your Majesty, the first group of Asuras have reached the capital. Lady Wu Yijun asked me to update you about it since there seems to be some disturbances outside." Qin Ming bowed slightly and said with a gentle smile on her lovely face.

"I'll handle it." Bai Zemin thanked her and quickly left.

If everything went well, his faction's strength would grow to double or perhaps more once this large-scale operation was over. Therefore, problems were not welcome this time!
