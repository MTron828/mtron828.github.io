After his heart-to-heart talk with Wu Yijun, Bai Zemin did not make any sudden moves at all and simply tried to relax and rest to recover from his injuries as fast as possible.

Like Shangguan Bing Xue and Evangeline, Bai Zemin was out of danger but still had an arm and a leg to recover.

In exactly 45 days after Bai Zemin opened his eyes after sleeping for 15 days straight in the Collector's Pocket World, Shangguan Bing Xue made a 100% recovery and the pulverized bones in her arms were once again harder than steel.

Evangeline had recovered 100% 15 days before Shangguan Bing Xue, and leaving aside Kong Jun who still needed considerable time to recover the biggest problem was still Bai Zemin.

Having spent a total of 2 months in the Collector's Pocket World but only 12 days in the outside world, the healing speed of the group would be seen as insane from the point of view of those unaware of the power that the Collector's Pocket Watch had.

Unfortunately, even two months was not enough for Bai Zemin to recover his lost limbs 100%.

Bai Zemin looked at his left arm which was 1/4 to fully regenerated and then looked at his left leg which still needed to grow from the calf down.

"Argh! Fuck its mother! This daddy can't stand still anymore!" 

"You- Stand still!"

"Bing Xue, I'm telling you to let go of me!"

"Bing Xue, let mommy help you hold him back."

"You- Mom, what are you doing?!"

"Shangguan Xinyue, where do you think you're touching?!"

Evangeline and Wu Yijun had rather interesting expressions on their faces as they watched the scene in front of them not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

In the end, Bai Zemin managed to convince Shangguan Bing Xue that even though he had not fully recovered it was not a good idea to stay MIA for too long.

To begin with, three of the most important figures for the smooth running of the Transcendent faction and its development had been missing for almost two weeks. This was naturally not good, especially not now that China had just fully united and needed stability.

Furthermore, neither Bai Zemin nor any of those inside the Collector's Pocket World had a clear idea of what was happening on the mainland at the moment. In fact, they didn't even have a clear idea of how things were on the Earth in general now and Bai Zemin was worried about what the former Queen Shi Lin had seen when she used her Clairvoyance skill.

"It's been 12 days since Meng Qi is in the sea city." Bai Zemin remarked in a deep voice with a hint of worry, "Although I don't think anything bad will happen to her since Xian Mei'er is with her, none of us can completely rule out the possibility that the East Sea King is a complete idiot and doesn't understand the repercussions of harming her."

Bai Zemin didn't care whether he had the power to take revenge or not, what he cared about was the safety and well-being of his little sister. 

It was no use having the power and ability to annihilate the entire East Sea if Meng Qi was no longer alive.

Revenge was only a way to temporarily vent anger and sadness, but eventually all that would remain was sadness and anger not only towards one's enemies but towards one's own powerlessness.

Hearing all the valid points given by Bai Zemin, even Shangguan Bing Xue could no longer hold him back despite the fact that she, as well as everyone else, preferred him to make a full recovery before leaving this place.

"But..." Wu Yijun looked at Bai Zemin's current condition and said worriedly, "How are you supposed to move with your left leg like this?"

Bai Zemin frowned but quickly eased up, "Actually, I've been thinking about this before but I think I can move using my Blood Manipulation skill... Just, give me a few hours to practice and then we can get out of here."

Bai Zemin headed to his room after leaving everyone behind, but before he began to put his theory into practice, what he did was to take out the scrolls containing the skills Shadow Control, Dark Mist, and Drain Life.

(A/N: Ch 926, 866, and 823 respectively)

After learning the three skills, Bai Zemin immediately felt more powerful even though none of the skills he had just learned were actually increasing his strength unless he activated them.

"The best thing about this is that I still have 16 free slots to learn active skills." Bai Zemin sighed as he recalled his times of abstinence while stuck at level 50.

"Once I get out of here and make sure Meng Qi is okay the first thing I will do is look for enemies to defeat. Now that I can use Drain Life and use the Health stat of my enemies to my advantage the power of Restoration will be far stronger." 

All this added together with Overlap Regeneration and Bai Zemin had turned into a truly terrifying existence.

At this moment, he was simply perfect no matter which way one looked at him.

Terrifying physical attack power.

Extremely high magical attack power.

Physical defense high enough that no pre-apocalypse weapon below Annihilation level could harm him.

Magical defense frightening enough to be able to fight powerful Fourth Order mages despite being in the Second Order.

Stamina high enough to fight for days without any problem.

Ability to regenerate his Stamina and Mana dozens of times.

Mass and field control skills.

Vital recovery and body regeneration skills.

The more he thought about it, the more surprised Bai Zemin became at how well his skills were synchronized.

After learning the three skills he had reserved for himself, Bai Zemin used Blood Manipulation to create something similar to a prosthesis and carefully attached that prosthesis to the part of his leg that had yet to regenerate.

Using small blood thread-like connectors, Bai Zemin carefully attached them to the flesh and then to the nerves of his leg, and although he felt a bit of pain in the process it wasn't too bad.

It took Bai Zemin about 1.5 hours to be able to move with about 60% of his total freedom, but that was the absolute limit and he soon realized that if he tried to overcome it the blood prosthesis would be destroyed unless he was willing to spend hundreds of Mana points per second to sustain it.

In the end, Bai Zemin decided to accept that 60% at the cost of consuming only 5 Mana point every 10 minutes to keep the prosthesis hard and firm.

After that, Bai Zemin did the same but this time he created a prosthesis for his left arm using Blood Manipulation. 

Being able to move his fake arm with 50% freedom was not that difficult when it came to walking, jumping, and running short distances. However, the freedom Bai Zemin had was less; if he used too much Strength or too much Agility for a sudden movement, what would happen was that the prosthesis would burst into pieces, damaging Bai Zemin's nerves in the process.

In the end, Bai Zemin's Mana consumption amounted to 1 Mana point per minute to keep both prostheses at the same time at all moments. Considering that he now had over 6700 Mana points in total even without taking into account Overlap Regeneration, such consumption was negligible in his eyes.

When Shangguan Bing Xue, Wu Yijun, Evangeline, and Shangguan Xinyue saw Bai Zemin casually walking out of the house wearing a reddish colored leather armor, the three women were a bit speechless.

"... This is basically cheating." Shangguan Bing Xue forced a smile and shook her head.

On the other hand, Wu Yijun didn't seem worried about amazing sights but rather was worried about another more important matter.

"Won't walking like this hinder your recovery?" Wu Yijun asked as she looked into his eyes worriedly.

Wu Yijun had been using Revitalize on Bai Zemin at least 1 time a day for the past two months in the Collector's Pocket Watch. This made the effect of Restoration double during the initial minutes, and thus she had a clearer idea of his current situation.

"Mm, indeed." Bai Zemin sighed and said with some regret, "I'm practically not regenerating at all as these two prosthetics hinder the growth of more flesh and the evolution of tissues."

"Isn't that bad?" Evangeline frowned.

"It's fine, I just need to keep myself like this in front of the King and such so they don't try to cause trouble unnecessarily. I'll use all my free time to help my limbs regrow." Bai Zemin dismissed this easily.

"...When you say the word help I somehow don't think you mean rest." Shangguan Bing Xue glared at him.

"... Little Bing Xue, I see you know me quite well." Bai Zemin grimaced before nodding, "You're right, it's not about rest. But, you'll see what I mean later. I just learned a couple of good skills and one of them deals precisely with increasing my recovery rate when I'm facing an enemy."

"Who are you calling 'Little Bing Xue'? Forget it if you've already made up your mind, you stubborn man." The person in question rolled her eyes before letting go of a small sigh that perhaps only she understood. Shangguan Bing Xue looked at Bai Zemin weirdly and said slowly, "By the way, have you looked at yourself in a mirror during these past 60 days?"

Looked in a mirror?

Bai Zemin shook his head, "No, there are no mirrors in this place and I don't need one..." He paused as he realized something and asked with a frown, "... Why do you ask?"

Shangguan Bing Xue did not respond immediately but first exchanged glances with her mother and the other two women before looking at Bai Zemin with a somewhat funny expression on her face.

"... I think it will be better if you look at it with your own eyes instead of hearing it from someone else." At the same time and as she said these words, Shangguan Bing Xue extended her right hand in front of her upwards and a small but powerful amount of fog began to swirl in her palm.

Soon, a surprisingly elegant silver-colored small hand mirror floated above Shangguan Bing Xue's palm. She used Ice Maker, and soon the small ice mirror floated toward Bai Zemin.

Bai Zemin took the mirror with his right hand and looked at Shangguan Bing Xue before looking at Wu Yijun and then moving on to Shangguan Xinyue and Evangeline. 

"Just look in the mirror. You won't figure out anything by looking in our faces." Wu Yijun let out an amused chuckle.

Bai Zemin nodded slowly before looking at his reflection with some apprehension in his heart.

He didn't have to look too hard, the change was evident at a glance.

Bai Zemin watched wide-eyed as his hair swayed gently in the warm breeze blowing from a distance.

The hair of Bai Delan, Bai Zemin's father, was black and the hair color of Ye Linger who was Bai Zemin's mother was also jet black. Most Chinese had black hair after all, brown hair was a bit rare while Shangguan Bing Xue's white hair color was simply a rarity among thousands of rarities.

Bai Zemin's hair had been black all his life; jet black, deep black like the dark night sky devoid of moonlight or stars.

But... When Bai Zemin saw the several strands of bright crimson red intermingling with his black hair, what he felt was as if someone had given him a heavy blow on the back of the head and almost fell to the ground.

"Wha... What the fuck is this?!" Bai Zemin was dumbfounded as he stared at the ice mirror in front of him.

Bai Zemin's reaction was completely expected, but to the three women who had been seeing him for two months it was no longer anything unusual.

"Don't worry, you look way sexier now." Wu Yijun blushed slightly.

"I- It's not about sexy or not sexy!" Bai Zemin admitted in his heart that he did indeed look hot, but that wasn't the problem! 

"My mother will definitely rip my head off if she sees this!" Bai Zemin could still remember how his mother always complained about hooligans who dyed their hair different colors.

"Pffft- Hahaha!" Shangguan Xinyue laughed good-naturedly and in between tears and laughter said in a cheerful voice, "King or not, it seems that we mothers are the real rulers after all!"
