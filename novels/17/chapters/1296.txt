"Golden Domain, huh... That's the place you loved and hated the most..."

The words that the ancient spirit Sirius Heavenly Wolf Sirius left behind just before disappearing continued to echo in Bai Zemin's head over and over again refusing to be forgotten for long.

"What does that mean?" Bai Zemin murmured, shaking his head. He tried to dismiss the thought as he observed the cracks forming in the dark space, resembling a fragile glass on the verge of shattering.

Starting from a small white crack from which tiny specks of light leaked in, the entire dark space began to fill with cracks just like a crystal glass about to break.

Bang!

Bai Zemin felt as if something inside him weakly exploded, leaving him dazed for a moment.

"Big brother?"

Shaking off the lingering dizziness, Bai Zemin reassured Meng Qi with a smile.

"I'm fine," he said, noticing her puzzled expression.

"You seemed lost for a moment, but if you say you're fine, then there's no problem..." Meng Qi replied, looking at him doubtfully but nodding nonetheless."Looks like it's settling back down..." Bai Zemin muttered under his breath with his eyes fixed on the distant sky.ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

Meng Qi, too, turned her gaze towards the stars. She breathed a sigh of relief as the 147 crimson stars returned to their normal state, gradually joined by the other stars in the sky. "Thank heavens. I was afraid bad news was coming," she murmured.

As if retorting against Meng Qi telling her not to feel relaxed too soon, the Ring of the Commander on Bai Zemin's right thumb suddenly lit up as the golden runes glowed brightly.

"An emergency call?" Bai Zemin was taken aback but quickly remembered something and his expression changed. He sent some of his Mana to the ring, initiating the conversation without waiting for the other party to speak. "Sky Destroyer, have you encountered trouble?" he asked.

"B-Big brother, trouble! Big trouble!"

Wen Yun's anxious and fearful voice came out as a cry from the runes of the black ring.

"What happened? Explain the situation!" Bai Zemin demanded in a deep voice, his steps quickening as he headed outside.

Meng Qi's expression mirrored Bai Zemin's growing concern as she had been present when he ordered the intergalactic war battleship, Sky Destroyer, to stand guard one solar system away from Obion World.

As Bai Zemin and Meng Qi listened to Wen Yun's report, their faces grew increasingly grave.

The news was unsettling: four unidentified creatures briefly appeared on the Sky Destroyer's detection radar before disappearing. Their trajectory indicated they were heading straight for Obion World!

Bai Zemin recognized the gravity of the situation. He had personally fought one of these creatures not long ago, making their identity all too clear.

"This might be more troublesome than expected..." Bai Zemin thought, feeling the weight of the situation bearing down on him.

Meng Qi looked at him with sadness and concern, clutching the sleeve of his tunic. "Big brother... What should we do?" she stammered.

In that moment, Bai Zemin's expression grew incredibly unpleasant upon hearing Wen Yun's report.

Living creatures that vanished from advanced radars in an instant, capable of surviving in space-they posed a significant threat. Bai Zemin knew the enemies' identity based on his previous encounter.

It could be said that she was the person who knew Bai Zemin the most in terms of gestures, as no matter what kind of expression he subconsciously made it would be easily understood and read by her. How could she not know him like the back of her hand? Even if they were separate beds they have been sleeping in the same room for several years! Meng Qi couldn't even count the number of times she stared at his sleeping face!

Until now, Meng Qi had only seen this kind of expression on his face only once in the past and it only lasted for half a second before it disappeared. This was when Bai Zemin learned that his family simply did not have enough money to send both children to a good university, which resulted in him choosing to take a path full of thorns and sharp rocks to leave the way clear for her; completely ignoring the opinion of others for the sake of his little adopted sister.

Bai Zemin had no idea of Meng Qi's thoughts his mind quickly raced to find a solution. Based on their distance and estimated speed, he calculated that the enemies would arrive in no more than an hour, possibly even sooner.

He really had no choice.

"Meng Qi, can you take care of keeping order here temporarily?"

Meng Qi wanted to refuse and say that she would rather accompany him to the battlefield. However, she was a sensible and intelligent girl.

Even if she followed him to the battlefield, what could she do there other than be a burden? Enemies against whom even someone as powerful as her brother had to take seriously and fear, she would be no help but a hindrance!

eaglesnov…ê1,—Åo–ú "Go and fight peacefully, big brother." Meng Qi tried to smile despite her ghost-like pale face and nodded softly, "I promise that by the time you return, everything will be just as it was when you left. I will see to it that the racial conversion process goes as smoothly as possible!"

By saying this she was implicitly pointing out that she will be waiting for his return.

Bai Zemin also understood the message, and after a kiss on her forehead, his body moved too fast for Meng Qi to follow, disappearing in a jiffy.

Shangguan Bing Xue and Wu Yijun were currently in the backyard of the Imperial Palace.

Both girls were in charge of supervising the transformation of the asura race into humans, as well as keeping a count of the Soul Stones spent to carry out the process.

In addition to them, there were also over 30,000 human soul revolvers; all of them extremely powerful and with a vast range of combat experience. Fortunately, after Bai Zemin's words were fully settled in the heads of the Asuras, this bloodthirsty warrior race did not cause great trouble but cooperated wholeheartedly for the sake of a better future.

"I must admit that when Bai Zemin told me about his idea I was hesitant." Shangguan Bing Xue smiled slightly as she watched one more group of asuras now converted into humans.

The group of approximately 4000 asuras burst into tears as they knelt on the ground while hugging their loved ones. The excitement and joy in their eyes and expressions were too obvious for them not to understand that something amazingly good was happening to them to the point where they could not hold back the emotion in their hearts.

"Same," Wu Yijun covered her mouth and let out a chuckle. Her big black pearl-like eyes sparkled as she looked at the scene in front of her as admired: "Who would have thought that her apparently crazy idea would actually succeed? And it's not just a small success at that! Hehehe..."

Shangguan Bing Xue chuckled and shook her head not knowing how to feel about it, "It seems like all of that man's crazy ideas are the solution to many problems, don't you think?" "Indeed!"

Even though both females were just chatting casually and in low voices, the changes of expression on their faces were visible to everyone.

Seeing such beauties smiling happily naturally stole many male glances and sighs, particularly Shangguan Bing Xue as 99% of those present even suspected that she never smiled lienee it was a great surprise to see her acting as delicate and warm as a spring butterfly.

"Oh?" Shangguan Bing Xue suddenly looked up at the sky and her eyes flashed as she realized something: "Speak of the devil and he will show up."

She had not finished her words when she suddenly realized that something was not right with Bai Zemin's expression, who was approaching at lightning speed from a distance.

Wu Yijun was also happy to see Bai Zemin and thought she could chat with him for a while, but when she saw the indifferent and detached expression on his face she immediately came to the same conclusion as her lifelong good sister.

Something is not right!

Besides, something that could make Bai Zemin put on that kind of expression... The two beauties feared that this matter might be a little too big.

Shangguan Bing Xue did not wait for him to speak as she directly asked in a cold voice, "What happened?"

Bai Zemin looked at the surroundings and with a wave of his hand created a gravitational sphere covered by air, isolating sounds and confusing the vision of those on the outside. He needed to be cautious and prevent this information from leaking out as there could be no chaos or everything would fall apart!

"You two go back to Hero City. Now!" His voice sounded colder than he initially wanted but time was pressing so he quickly gave a brief summary of the situation and said, "Meng Qi will take charge of this place with the rest supporting her. Bing Xue, Yijun, you two must give orders and control Hero City's weapons to back me up... My vitality is currently not very good... I'm afraid it won't be easy for me to use Overlap Regeneration freely."

Although Bai Zemin was way more powerful than he was days ago, even he wouldn't be able to fight against four Higher Existences at the same time... More importantly, his most crucial support skill on the battlefield had to be used with utmost caution as his vitality hadn't even recovered by half!
