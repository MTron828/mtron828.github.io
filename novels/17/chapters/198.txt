Hearing Cai Jingyi's voice and the urgent tone in which she spoke, Kang Lan finally came back to her senses.

She looked at Bai Zemin and asked a little worriedly, "You... Are you all right? Do you have a particularly serious injury that you want me to treat for you...?"

Kang Lan simply didn't know how to react. To her, Bai Zemin was a supreme and invincible existence. In the past, no matter what kind of enemy it was or how strong it was, he always emerged victorious with overwhelming strength. However, seeing him with such wounds made her realize that he, like her, was a human being.

This thought unconsciously made Kang Lan also realize that as a human, Bai Zemin must be feeling a great deal of weight on his shoulders. With the lives of nearly two thousand people weighing on his back as well as the constant concern for food and safety could definitely cause him to collapse one day if he was not helped.

Unaware of the thoughts of the woman in front of him, Bai Zemin shook his head and sat down on the couch as he slowly said, "Just heal my left arm. Use your Lesser Healing skill both times on my arm."

"On your arm..." Kang Lan repeated while looking at the wound on his face. She wanted to say something but soon understood the thoughts of the man in front of her and couldn't help but bite her lips as a complicated glint flashed in her dark eyes.

The reason why Bai Zemin chose his arm over any other part of his body, even ignoring the pain he felt due to his broken ribs, was most likely because he wanted to be able to use as much of his strength as quickly as possible again.

If a powerful enemy appeared, even if he had two or three broken ribs, Bai Zemin could face them as long as he had his two arms and two legs in perfect condition. However, with his left arm out of action, his total strength was naturally much less than normal.

At this realization, Kang Lan exchanged glances with Cai Jingyi before starting to move the Mana in her body by pushing it with all her Magic. Her hands glowed with a faint white radiance as she carefully activated her First Order Lesser Healing skill.

Kang Lan's Lesser Healing skill was originally a First Order active skill level 1. But little by little, she was fulfilling the requirements to evolve this skill and together with the acquisition of some Soul Stones, the level of her skill had been raised from 1 to 4 in a short time.

Now, First Order Lesser Healing level 4 was 15% more effective than in the past. This coupled with Bai Zemin's high Health stat as well as the passive bonus of his Superhuman Health skill, which increased the healing he received by 20%, the results were astonishing.

After the first activation, when the first orb of white light went into his left arm, Bai Zemin felt all the broken bones seem to twist at speeds that were simply too dazzling. He felt as if a drill was constantly piercing his skin and the pain alone was enough to make 90% of the people howl like ghosts.

Ten minutes later, when the effect of the first magic healing orb ended, Kang Lan once again cast Lesser Healing on the same spot as before.

Crack...Crack...Crack...

The cracking sound spread through the silent room, causing Cai Jingyi and Kang Lan's hair to stand on end. The only person who maintained a composed expression, other than Bai Zemin himself, was Lilith in her human form.

Lilith observed everything, every detail in Bai Zemin's expression and noticed that occasionally his resolute eyes hesitated. That was when she realized that he was in a lot of pain but by pure will power he was barely enduring it.

But how could he not be in pain? Almost a month ago, he was just a normal human being. It was just that Lilith had unconsciously not treated Bai Zemin as a human equal to the rest; at times, she even forgot that he was just a Lower Existence of the First Order.

Ten minutes after the second magic orb began to work inside his body, the white glow that illuminated Bai Zemin's left arm slowly dimmed until it disappeared completely.

Feeling the arm still somewhat stiff, Bai Zemin stood up and, to the surprise of his two Loyal Followers, he began to move his left arm back and forth casually. He even punched the void in front of him several times naturally.

"You... Leader, your arm healed completely?!" Kang Lan exclaimed in shock as she looked at him in disbelief.

She had previously touched Bai Zemin's left arm, naturally she felt how his bones had broken into several pieces each. She estimated that it would take at least three or four more sessions to heal it in its entirety.

Little did she expect that after a single shot, with the two activations of her Lesser Healing skill, all of his bones came back together again. Seeing how he moved like this, it seemed as if his previous fractures were nothing more than illusions.

Cai Jingyi's eyes lit up brightly as she looked at him with adoration. Recovering from more than twenty fractures in such a short time... Who else besides him could do something like that? Cai Jingyi was sure that even the second most powerful person in the entire group, Shangguan Bing Xue, was not capable of such a thing.

The only one who did not seem surprised was Lilith. She knew Bai Zemin's current stats as well as all of his skills after all.

Bai Zemin chuckled and revealed with a hint of pride in his voice: "My Health stat is close to 300 points, so my recovery rate is almost 30 times faster than a particularly healthy person before the arrival of the Soul Record on Earth. I also have a passive skill that boosts all the healing I receive by 20%."

Kang Lan and Cai Jingyi gasped as they heard that their Health had almost reached 300 points. Kang Lan's Health stat was barely 57 points and although Cai Jingyi was a little better at 87 points she still couldn't compare to him. It was only then that the two realized that they were simply too far behind him and that if they wanted to be of any use to him and not hinder him in the future they would have to work much harder.

Both women looked at each other and saw the same glint of resolve in each other's eyes.

This was the first time Bai Zemin told another living being about his stats other than Lilith, and the only reason he did this was because he knew that the two women in front of him would not reveal anything to anyone. After all, for better or worse, they were under the passive effect of the skill attached to his Lower Leader subclass.

"I suppose with another three more sessions you'll be able to return to your max condition." 'Lili' stood up and approached him with a happy smile.

"I think so." Bai Zemin nodded as he looked at her with shining eyes.

"Kang Lan, Cai Jingyi. Listen carefully." He looked at them with a serious expression and revealed his plans for the next few days.

Hearing what he said, both women's eyes shone with intense fervor.
