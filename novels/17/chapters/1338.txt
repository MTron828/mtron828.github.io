Ôªø1339 Ancestral Bloodline

As the beast and the man fought, the power of both grew seemingly without limit. Bai Zemin's attention, however, was focused on the figure behind the man engulfed in flames.

Unfortunately, although he tried his best, he could not even make out this person's hair, let alone the type of face that was hidden behind that strange layer of mist.

For some unknown reason, Bai Zemin felt a strong torrent of hatred flooding his heart as time passed.

This hatred simply came out of nowhere and was truly inexplicable. Even Bai Zemin himself was startled and frightened because he had never felt such a desire to kill someone as he did now.

It was not directed at the man wielding the spear nor was it directed at the figure silently supporting him from behind. All that burning hatred was purely and exclusively directed towards the black beast with the red horn.

Just as Bai Zemin's breathing began to grow heavy and his eyes to grow redder and redder, the man engulfed in flames suddenly seemed to sense something as he turned his head abruptly to where he was.

The flames covering the man's body disappeared and although Bai Zemin tried his best to see his face for some reason he could only see two pairs of eyes as red as blood itself. There were two strange golden colored runes glowing brightly inside the man's eyes, flashing continuously.

"Time is running out."

...

Bai Zemin suddenly woke up and abruptly sat up in the middle of the night.

His entire body was drenched in cold sweat and even the sheets under him were soaked at this point.

What... What was that... Time is running out?

Bai Zemin could feel the fierce beating of his heart pounding in his chest like a horse in a frenzy.

He did have some strange dreams so far and he also had nightmares. However, this time it was different.

That didn't feel like a dream nor did it feel like a nightmare at all.Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

That black beast with a single horn and that man wrapped in colorful flames wielding a spear cloaked in black lightning, both of them had reached an indescribable level of power and their battle was the most terrifying thing Bai Zemin had ever seen in his life.

Every time the spear collided with the beast's claws, hundreds of stars countless light years away would instantly explode just from the remaining aftershocks of the impact. Even more terrifying, at the center of impact space was being torn apart and dimensions were collapsing; all barriers were completely shattered to the point where the universe itself was trembling.

Bai Zemin didn't know why but he suddenly felt an extremely terrifying level of urgency to the point where he felt like throwing up.

"Phew..." He looked at the sleeping beauty beside him with crystal clear tears suspended on her long eyelashes and couldn't help but feel a little better.

Tonight was a big waterslide of emotions; mostly for Lilith.

She probably thought he fell asleep from emotional exhaustion after learning the truth, which led her to fall asleep not long after. At the end of the day, this night was exhausting to the point of being worse than a days-long battle to the death for her.

After taking a deep breath, Bai Zemin sat cross-legged and rested against the back of the bed. Then, he closed his eyes and began to work.

He had to do something about the anxiety in his heart, and he could hardly sleep tonight. So, he decided he had better get some work done now that he had the opportunity.

Bai Zemin opened his eyes and a flash of surprise shone in his pupils.

"When did I upgrade Blood Manipulation to the Seventh Order?" Bai Zemin muttered feeling confused, but he suddenly understood what was going on.

It had to be the memories of his life in that illusion?...

Indeed, when Bai Zemin checked the records of his Blood Manipulation skill he saw that the skill in fact had reached the highest possible level and now had a new.... function, so to speak.

When Bai Zemin opened his eyes this time, a strange expression appeared on his face.

After a moment of hesitation, he took out the Collector's Pocket Watch and with a thought his body disappeared from the room at the same time as the ancient pocket watch fell directly onto the pillow.

Bai Zemin appeared on top of a green mountain inside the Collector's Pocket Watch. He took a deep breath and couldn't help but feel the changes inside this world compared to the last time he entered 6 months ago before he fell into a coma.

The world inside the Collector's Pocket Watch was becoming more and more like a real world as time went on. Now there were not only different climates, landscapes, changing day and night... now there were even small fish as well as some insects native from this world in rivers and forests.

At this point, the difference in space-time law compared to the outside world was 12 hours inside against 1 hour outside.

Bai Zemin always felt that the Collector's Pocket Watch was an extraordinary treasure and had a hunch that he had only uncovered the tip of the iceberg regarding its usefulness.

Bai Zemin's eyes filled with tears at the thought of that illusory world he had lived in for so many years. That figure with whom he had lived for centuries and centuries, shared so many tears and hardships as well as joys and smiles... He did not know if he would ever see her again.

Bai Zemin took a deep breath to calm himself and then closed his eyes to feel inside his body. Suddenly, his eyes opened and a flash of disbelief shone in his dazed gaze.

Indeed, there was something in his blood that wasn't there before.

Small snake-like lightning flashes were moving back and forth in his meridians, resembling infantile children trying to outdo each other and occasionally colliding with each other.

The lightning snakes were bright violet and there were too many to count.

"Is this the power of my Ancestral Bloodline?" Bai Zemin clenched his fist several times as he muttered to himself.

He felt a strong amount of power within those small violet colored lightning snakes.
