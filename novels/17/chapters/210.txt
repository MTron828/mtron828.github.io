Fidgeting like a small child at Christmas anxiously awaiting the arrival of midnight to watch the fireworks and open his presents, Bai Zemin eagerly helped the armor down to the worktable. From his point of view, the whole magnificent scene was too slow and was getting on his nerves!

Immediately, the information and details of the new armor flashed across his retina like lightning.

------

[Bloodthirsty Wolf Armor -

[Full Body Armor]

[Rank: 2]

[Defense: 1150]

[Physical Attack Power: 350]

[When attacking with spikes, it has a 5% chance of inflicting critical hits to the enemy.]

[Durability: 900/900]

[Description: A miracle of luck created by a lucky blacksmith after the exact and correct use of the same material in the formation of two different but equal objects that worked to form a single one.]

------

Bai Zemin breathed a breath of fresh air when he saw the armor's defense.

1150 defense points! Compared to the 570 defense points of the previous Rending Wolf Pants and the 770 points of the Rending Wolf Chestplate, the difference was simply too big. Bai Zemin's upper body had gained almost four hundred points of defense while his lower body had gained more than twice as much protection!

Furthermore, in case the situation called for it or if Bai Zemin saw fit, when he used the armor's spikes he had an extra 5% chance of inflicting critical hit along with an attack power of 350; this was no different from having another extra weapon!

After touching the armor and seeing the details, Lilith smiled slightly and praised, "Although it barely enters Rank 2 and is actually quite weak, it is undoubtedly a great armor considering that Earth has barely been experiencing evolution for a little less than a month. Congratulations on your new acquisition! I hope you won't suffer so many injuries now and stop worrying me so much, kid!"

"...Thank you..." Bai Zemin didn't know whether to laugh or cry. At first everything was fine, he even couldn't help but rejoice a little at her preoccupation even though he knew it was probably only because in the future she needed his help for something. But her last word bothered him a little.

"Was the word kid necessary?"

"Of course it was~ At the end of the day you're just a virgin kid!"

"Aren't you a virgin too?! Then you're a brat!"

"Kya~ Thank you for your praise!"

The corner of Bai Zemin's mouth twitched a couple of times. Of course she would be happy! After all, Lilith's age was probably equivalent to his millennial ancestor!

"Forget it. I won't argue with you, woman."

"How chivalrous of you~"

Bai Zemin ignored her and started to work.

The next thing he made for himself was a pair of gloves.

Currently, Bai Zemin was using a unique one-handed glove, it was a Normal grade treasure that increased his Strength stat by 5 points in addition to possessing an approximately twenty centimeter protruding blade that could be used as a weapon. Although in the past it was a good item, for the current him it no longer had too much impact so he decided to change the glove.

The gloves that Bai Zemin crafted were also made from the black leather of the First Order Shadow Leopard. In addition, he also used parts of the skull bones of a First Order Armored Elephant level 50.

After preparing the leather and creating two mitten-style gloves that left half of his fingers exposed for easy grip on his weapon, Bai Zemin began furiously hammering the tiny but extremely hard bones he was going to use next.

"Wuoooo!"

"What's with that battle cry? You're just hammering a bone!"

The skull of the First Order Armored Elephant level 50 was really hard, Bai Zemin had to hammer for a total of two hours to separate the parts he wanted to use. Then, what he did was to reheat the leather and glue these white bones on the eight main knuckles of both gloves.

[Skull Breaker Glove -

[Weapon and Armor]

[Rank: 1] UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

[Defense: 200]

[Physical Attack Power: 250]

[Durability: 400/400

[Description: A simple but effective creation using First Order materials that provides its wearer with protection and power.]

------

Both gloves were exactly identical. Just as the description said, they were simple but undoubtedly effective.

"Should I make boots too?" He hesitated a bit regarding this matter.

"Forget it, little Zemin. Boots will only give you defense and nothing else. You need a Magic Rune Encryptor to get a movement speed bonus." Lilith shook her head softly and stopped him.

"Mmm... In that case forget it." In the end, he gave up.

Defense for the sole of his foot in exchange for losing Agility? No thanks. Bai Zemin wasn't interested.

Bai Zemin spent the rest of the early morning working on his own personal equipment. By the time he finally stopped swinging the hammer for the first time, it was already nine in the morning.

"Woah! When did it become daylight?" he gasped.

"You were so focused on what you were doing that you didn't even realize it was already daylight. I don't know whether to praise you or not..." Lilith was speechless.

"Well... At least it was worth it." Bai Zemin sighed in satisfaction as he looked at the objects in front of him.

A blood-red greatsword over two meters long with no less than forty centimeters wide, a full body armor as black as night, a pair of gloves the same color as the armor with sturdy dark knuckle bumps, a scabbard a bit larger than the greatsword of the same color with some decorations here and there, and last but not least, a somewhat ragged cloak attached to two shoulder pads matching the armor.

------

[Bright Armored Shoulder Pads -

[Upper Armor]

[Rank: 1]

[Defense: 480]

[Durability: 800/800]

[Description: An especially high defense considering it is only a shoulder pad due to the good material used during the creation process.]

------

Both shoulder pads were exactly the same. Bai Zemin had used part of the armor of one of the First Order Bright Scaled Rhinos and some more pieces of the armor of a First Order Armored Elephant.

------

Bai Zemin was extremely satisfied with the equipment in front of him. He had practically covered every weakness after spending an afternoon, evening, and part of a morning working tirelessly.

Still, he couldn't help but lament a little, "If only I had knowledge about magic runes I could create bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, and many other accessories with better properties..."

"Your current equipment is already surprisingly good." Lilith consoled with a smile. "Considering your natural stats due to your especially pure Soul Power, your current overall strength has definitely reached a frightening degree if we add these items."
