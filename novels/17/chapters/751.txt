[Description: A piece of armor forged by a blacksmith that slowly begins to advance between ranks, gradually graduating from its novice status using two Rank 2 metals as a core and a Soul Stone as a booster. Low level runes have been engraved on it].

------------------------------------------

Bai Zemin slowly removed his hand from the surface of the deep red piece of armor and a glint of satisfaction shone in his eyes. These pants were forged after more than 6 hours of hard work during which several scales of a level 52 mutant bloody snake were mixed in, giving the equipment an appearance similar to the armored pants used by dragon slayers in legends.

Thanks to Meng Qi's runes, the improvement of this piece of equipment compared to his previous one was simply colossal.

Bai Zemin now looked at the two bright red gauntlets that resembled dragon claws and with a faint smile touched one of them.

The records immediately flashed in his retina.

------------------------------------------

[Thunder Red Steel Grips-

[Double Gauntlet]

[Description: A pair of gauntlets forged using fragments of a Rank 2 metal and scales of a mutant electric eel. Thanks to the forging tools used and the runes drawn, the OVERALL power of this piece of dual equipment can be considered among the highest levels of Rank 2].

------------------------------------------

Because it was a paired functioning piece of equipment, if one of them was destroyed the overall power of the remaining one would plummet probably even below 50% of what it was before. However, together, these gauntlets were undoubtedly wonderful.

With these gauntlets, not only was Bai Zemin gaining some extra Strength but he had also gained natural resistance towards an element; which was incredibly rare considering that Bai Zemin previously only managed to acquire fire resistance thanks to the Endless Blue Lotus Flame, a natural treasure that at its peak could even strike down gods and demons.

The increase in attack speed might be small, but that small 5% in conjunction with the fourth characteristic had become something that Bai Zemin truly appreciated. Now he would be able to wield his greatsword with much greater ease than before and his attacks would be at least 30%-40% more terrifying than they already were!

Bai Zemin's eyes locked onto the next piece of equipment and his eyes flashed brightly.

This piece was actually a large deep red cape but with a large blue lotus drawn on the back, but oddly enough it flickered as if it was alive. At the same time, this cape was actually the piece of equipment that had left Bai Zemin most satisfied in certain aspects.

------------------------------------------

[Greatcloak of Infernal Fire-

[4) As long as it possesses fire-type energy within it, the durability of the Greatcloak of Infernal Fire will not drop].

[Description: A special piece of equipment born partly as a miracle under the combination of 10+ mutant beast hides with fire-type energy stored in them. The rune encryptor managed to understand the blacksmith's feelings and will to perfection, thus being able to finish the job he entrusted to her].

------------------------------------------

Even though he had confirmed the records of this cape a day ago, Bai Zemin still got excited every time he saw them.

How could he not get excited after seeing so many awesomeness together? This cape was undoubtedly the second piece of equipment that Bai Zemin was most satisfied with, second only to his main weapon.

Thanks to Meng Qi's invaluable help, things that would have been impossible in the past were now open to him!

With the power of the Endless Blue Lotus Flame waiting to be released all at once, Bai Zemin could only imagine the expressions of shock and disbelief from the pitiful existences that would force him to use it!

Bai Zemin's eyes finally focused on the second-to-last piece of equipment on the table.

They were a pair of shoulder pads, large heavy shoulder pads of the same color as the chestplate Meng Qi was currently working on and the pants; deep red.

The shoulder pads looked quite ominous, even Bai Zemin didn't aim for them to look like that and it just happened during the forging process.G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

With three huge dagger-like spines that practically reached his face but fortunately were angled outwards, Bai Zemin could only apologize in his heart for those who in the middle of a close combat would receive a shoulder blow from him.

------------------------------------------

[Soul Shoulders of Bloodshed

[Heavy Shoulder Pads]

[Rank: 2]

[Defense: 3000]

[Physical Attack Power: 2000]

[Durability: 3500 / 3500]

[Special Options -

[1) Inflicts tearing wounds and produces inevitable bleeding for enemies whose Health stat is below the wearer's].

[2) Its weight is halved when the wielder possesses more than 500 natural Agility points].

[3) Can release the blades from the surface to perform a surprise ranged attack in times of need].

[4) Absorbs enemy blood to self-repair].

[Description: A set of heavy shoulder pads forged by a blacksmith with an interesting but dangerous imagination. Three lower runes were formed after the union of over 10,000 engravings made by a novice encryptor.

------------------------------------------

Honestly, Bai Zemin was really satisfied with these shoulder pads. Although the shoulder pads could be considered a kind of bonus since it naturally could not compare in importance with chestplate and pants, the shoulder pads that he and Meng Qi had created together were of such high quality that they could even help the wearer in the midst of combat.

Finally, Bai Zemin's eyes fell upon the last piece of equipment; another set that together formed one.

They were a pair of leg protectors and at the same time they were not, this was because their appearance was especially dominant and not because Bai Zemin wanted them to be but because of their natural characteristics and the materials used during the process of normal smithing and magic smithing made them so.

------------------------------------------

[Legplates of Unholy Vengeance-

[Special Item]

[Rank: 2]

[Defense: 4000]

[Special Options -

[2) When hitting with the knee, the chance of inflicting a critical hit is increased by 10%].

[3) After receiving a wound and counterattacking with the knee, the attack power is doubled].

[4) Decreases its weight by 20% without obstructing the user's natural movements].

[Description: Leg protectors? Who said that leg protectors only served as an extra means of defense? A piece of equipment born under the marvelous imagination of a blacksmith and a rune encryptor. If you're a man and ever get hit by these things, at least try to make sure you protect your crotch or there'll be one less difference between you and a woman!]

------------------------------------------

Bai Zemin forced a smile as he silently shook his head. The description of the object was... really interesting, to say the least.

However, the description wasn't wrong at all.

The leg protectors went from the calf and covered even the knees. Normally, covering the knees with leg guards was unwise as they would become hindrances to the movement of the whole body in general, but with the fourth option present, Bai Zemin would not have that problem.

As for the reason why Bai Zemin had created such troublesome leg protectors....

Bai Zemin stroked the two red scythes protruding from the knee area and a vicious glint shone in his eyes for a moment before disappearing.

He had used two of the scythes he obtained from the corpses of the Third Order weaver ants he killed inside the hall where the Sky Destroyer was located. Only Bai Zemin himself and Shangguan Bing Xue knew how terrifying and deadly those scythes were but their enemies surely wouldn't want to find out!

He finally sighed and turned to look at his younger sister.

Meng Qi was working really hard and with extreme concentration in her eyes, solely focused on the deep red chestplate before her.

Bai Zemin was really very grateful to her. Thanks to Meng Qi and her ability, Bai Zemin's overall power had risen again even though he was still stuck at level 50. He did not doubt that in the future and when she was able to comprehend and draw better runes, the future pieces of equipment he forged would be so terrifying that he could not even imagine it.
