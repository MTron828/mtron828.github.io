Winter Wonderland

A few hours later, Hero City covered by an invisible veil appeared in the sky just above the capital city of the asura race.

Bright lights illuminated the magnificent city, bringing life to the place. At this point in the night, many asuras were coming out of their homes to enjoy the nightlife. Although the males of this race were not particularly handsome unless they had high levels of power, their women were truly the crÃ¨me of the crÃ¨me and there was certainly no shortage of relatively weaker beauties selling their services in exchange for Soul Stones to gain strength.

Sitting on the Throne of Creation, Bai Zemin surveyed the crowd moving busily below thanks to the huge energy screen in front of him.

"Their Emperor died less than three days ago but they continue as if nothing." Wu Yijun commented in surprise at the sight of the crowded and not at all disorganized streets.

"Even though they look practically undistinguished from us they are not human." Bai Zemin pointed out, but quickly added, "Not that it matters whether they are human or not, it's mainly about their customs and beliefs. Obion World is a world that was kicked down and pushed aside by the Soul Record after its former inhabitants broke the rules, so the death of one or two Emperors probably isn't enough to raise waves."

Shangguan Bing Xue nodded and added, "Other than what you said I have to add something else. Like, when my race changed I noticed subtle but clear changes in my viewpoint towards different things in life. For example, those important to me have suddenly become much more important while those insignificant have become as valuable as the grass we step on when walking every day."

Bai Zemin said nothing when he heard this. However, he understood what was happening.

Shangguan Bing Xue was ultimately an elf after the former Elf Queen Lenna ceded her records to her. The elven race was not only known for their beauty and natural charm but were also said to be extremely proud and hated outsiders who disrupted within their lands or threatened the clean lives they led.

"Bing Xue, Yijun, I will leave you in charge." Bai Zemin suddenly stood up and looked at the two beauties in confusion as he explained with a frown, Tve had a bad feeling for a while now... Now that all we can do is wait and the main orders are being carried out by the rest I'll go to my room."

Shangguan Bing Xue's eyes lit up as she nodded, "Understood. Just go and do what you have to do. Yijun and I can take care of everything here."

Wu Yijun quickly nodded and added, "Just go and rest assured! If the worst comes to the worst we'll just kill a few to warn the others to let them know we don't come with bad intentions."

Bai Zemin chuckled when he heard Wu Yijun's words and couldn't help but look at her in a new light. This was the first time he saw Wu Yijun being so cute but fierce at the same time.

...

Sky Emperor's Room.

This luxurious and huge room that even had its own swimming pool inside a spacious private bathroom covered by gold floors once belonged to the former Sky Emperor, but since Bai Zemin became his successor only he was worthy of it.

Sitting at the head of the giant bed that could easily accommodate 10 people with no problem at all, Bai Zemin looked extremely small and lonely. In the past, he once thought about how many perverted things the old Sky Emperor probably did with his mistresses in this bedroom since the old bed was even bigger, therefore, he unhesitatingly changed the bed and put his own in its place.

Just like Shangguan Bing Xue said, his presence was no longer needed to monitor the situation. As King of the Transcendent faction and soon-to-be Emperor, there were many things that Bai Zemin did not need to do personally as naturally someone else would do it for him.

As such, he would now have a few hours to relax until the first batch of asuras from other cities arrived in the capital.

"Even though I'd really like to get some sleep... There's no choice." Bai Zemin took a deep breath and closed his eyes a moment later.

--------

Six hours later, he finally grouped the records that mattered to him among the ones he had just received.

[Most of the records obtained during the evolution process are absorbed and assimilated by your body and soul].

[You have received Strength +11.036, Agility +10.070, Health +12.400, Stamina +13.842, Mana +11.309, Magic +12.042. You cannot absorb any more records until you choose your advancement class and advance to Fourth Order. All records obtained during the evolution process will be saved for later absorption].

[Blood Warlock (Third Order): Warlocks are known as ultimate geniuses in the path of magic, but you walk a different path that makes you special even among them. Blood Warlocks are absolute experts in melee combat and are unrivaled in the way of magic. Every level you level up from now on will grant you 50 Strength points and 50 extra Magic points apart from the free points].

[Your race 'High Human' has evolved to 'Perfect Human'].

[Your skill Fourth Order Blood Manipulation evolves forcibly to the next stage thanks to the passive effect of your new race].

[Your skill Third Order Lonely Wolf Aura forcibly evolves to the next stage due to the abrupt increase of power in your soul and growing murderous intent].

[The evolution requirements for your skill First Order Super Warrior become laxer now that you are a Blood Warlock].

[Your skill Second Order Superhuman Health forcibly evolves to the next stage thanks to the passive effect of your new race].

[Your skill Third Order Golden Bones forcibly evolves to the next stage thanks to the passive effect of your new race].

[For unknown reasons, your skill Second Order War Cry has mutated and evolved into Third Order Lord's Word].

[Your skill Second Order Enhanced Dexterity forcibly evolves to the next stage thanks to the passive effect of your new race].

[The positive and negative effects of your skill Blood Berserker's Wrath become three times more powerful].

[The evolution requirements for your skill Sixth Order Magic Break become laxer, which allows you to take a step closer to controlling a new Domain!]

[The power of your skill Drain Life grows stronger thanks to the power of your new class, successfully evolving to the next stage. Thanks to the power of your mutated Blood Manipulation skill, Drain Life advances one stage further and is now a Fourth Order skill]!

[Due to a strange unknown mutation, your skill Third Order Magic Suppression successfully evolves into Fourth Order Magic Suppression].

[The increase of league in your blood has caused an advancement in your Poison Resistance skill!]

...

--------

Bai Zemin was speechless for a long time as his eyes scrolled through the various notifications and records.

"No wonder it took me so long to find and gather all of this," Bai Zemin said with a wry smile on his face, "So many skills evolved all together... No wonder."

He continued to scroll through his records even while mumbling.

--------

[Perfect Human: You are now what others would call perfection within those who are part of the human race, but you certainly haven't reached the peak despite it. Your current self recovers Stamina 50% faster and when you sleep your recovery rate of physical, mental, and spiritual energy, as well as your natural regeneration, are increased by 100%. Charm +100% (only takes effect 72 hours after evolution). Your physical body becomes perfect, which increases your overall life force enormously but it also becomes more difficult to have offspring due to the excellence of your genes. Health stat +30,000 and all skills that improve your physical body or your immediate vitality automatically evolve 1 whole stage (only effective the first time)].

[Superhuman Health (Second Order passive skill) level 1 - Transcendental Health (Third Order) level 5: Increases Health by another +3000 points in addition to the previous ones and adds another 1000 years of life expectancy every 100 levels increased. This skill cannot evolve under normal circumstances and its advancement requirements are unknown].

[Enhanced Dexterity (Second Order passive skill) level 1 -> Transcendental Dexterity (Third Order) level 5: Increases Agility by +1000 points aside from the above and decreases Stamina consumed both outside and in combat by 20%. This skill cannot evolve under normal circumstances and its advancement requirements are unknown].

[Lonely Wolf Aura (Fourth Order) level 1: Now you can not only make your enemies tremble in fear under the impact of your murderous intent but you can also use the phantom shadow of the lone wolf to fight next to you. The power of the lone wolf phantom shadow has 70% of your overall strength but lacks logic as it will only move to kill the enemy, and once destroyed it cannot be summoned again for the next 48 hours. It consumes 2000 Mana points and 1000 Stamina points to use with a duration of 2 hours maximum].

[Golden Bones (Third Order passive skill) level 5 Diamond Body (Fourth Order passive skill) level 5: Your entire body becomes as hard and precious as a diamond and any weapon below Rank 4 will not be able to break even the first layer of skin covering your flesh. Your internal organs become 10 times more resistant and durable compared to the previous level. Your life expectancy increases by another +5000 years and your Charm increases by +15,000 points. This skill cannot evolve again under normal circumstances and its advancement requirements are unknown].

[War Cry (Second Order active skill) level 5 Lord's Word (Third Order active skill) level 5: When roaring you can stun all enemies around you for a brief instant, the effect is less powerful and the time shorter the greater the difference between the user's Magic and that of the enemies. This skill has a less sophisticated use, and by spending Mana constantly you can influence the minds and decisions of others to a certain extent. No cooldown time but becomes less effective the more it is used on the same living being].FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

[Drain Life (Fourth Order active skill) level 5: By activating this skill, the user will be able to absorb the life energy of their enemies, thus healing the user's injuries through the use of the enemy's Health. The skill works best on weakened or restrained targets but also affects wounded enemies to a certain extent, the effect being greater the more wounded the enemies are. Affects all enemies within 10 meters around the user. It consumes 1500 Mana points to activate and 50 mana points for every second the skill is active. After activating and then deactivating, the skill will enter cooldown time for 24 hours].

[Magic Suppression (Fourth Order active skill) level 5: Consumes 2000 Mana points to activate one time, nullifying all attack magic cast by either allies or enemies within a range of up to 50 kilometers around the user. For the next 5 seconds, the attack-type magic launched will be suppressed by half. Cooldown time: 48 hours].

Bai Zemin sucked in a breath of cold air after reading the enhanced version of his evolved skills. It was only after a long time that he finally managed to utter a few words.

"Now... Now I understand where all that Health and such life force came from. As it is, couldn't I live for more than 20,000 years at my current level without any problems? I could probably live 100,000 years when I break through and become a Fourth Order soul evolver!" Bai Zemin could feel the corner of his mouth trembling fiercely at every word he said.

A peak Fourth Order existence would be lucky if he or she could live ten thousand years but he could probably live ten times that amount! Even now despite the fact that he was only level 200, he had a life expectancy twice as high!

"What a pity..." Bai Zemin sighed and a glint of sadness shone in his eyes, "If only... If only I had more time..."

There were only about 4 years or a little more left before reaching the time estimated by the Soul Record... If Bai Zemin could grow up in peace and quiet he had no doubt that he would become the mightiest under the stars given his current abilities and life expectancy.

However, looking back, Bai Zemin knew that if these were peaceful times he probably could not have grown to this point in such a short time. Besides, he couldn't help but remember a saying he heard somewhere many years ago.

"In times of war and death, heroes will rise up one after another to fight for peace and survival."

Although he did not see himself as a hero at all and in fact had committed many mistakes and sins, Bai Zemin understood that the word hero as well as its meaning could differ greatly just like the word evil or villain.

Just as Bai Zemin was about to open his status window to check something, the door of his room was knocked from outside.

Meanwhile, on Kram World, a fierce war that had already taken the lives of hundreds of Higher Existences broke out.
