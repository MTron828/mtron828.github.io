Chapter 807: The Ascendant State Polaris

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

There was a vortex before those present, which looked like a collapsed black hole.

The vortex was thousands of meters in diameter; inside the vortex was an ancient, magnificent residence that was vaguely standing. A distant and holy air was spreading out from the vortex.

?

The members of the Alliance of Stars looked around and communicate telepathically.

“It truly is a divine residence. A deity must’ve lived here eons ago!”

“This building looks old. It surely was built in the ancient times.”

“Are the three Ascendants already inside this divine residence?”

“So many people have been attracted to this place...”

The people who had already gathered in that location noticed the new arrivals from the Alliance of Stars.

When they saw the “Invincible In Universe” displayed on the clothes of some of the Star State experts, they instantly realized that the new arrivals belonged to the Alliance of Stars, which was rather unique in Silvy.

“Look, the Thousand Feathers Alliance is right there!”

“Those sons of bi*ches are here too!”

“Look over there; the people of the Ouhuang Alliance is here too.”

“It seems that a fierce battle is underway.”

“What are you scared of? Our leader is here. All of them will be killed if they dare to offend us!”

They communicated with each other via telepathy.

Once he heard that, Su Ping looked around and saw two groups who had plenty of Star State experts. There were even Star Lords in their armies.

“Do they have a history with us?” Su Ping asked O’Neil.

O’Neil nodded and replied, “Yes. The Thousand Feathers Alliance is an old nemesis of ours. Many of our members have been ambushed by them before. Try to avoid them if you ever go to chaotic areas. Of course, there’s no need to fear them right now since we came in numbers too.”

“What about the other group?”

“They once mocked our leader’s title, and our leader killed many of their people. We’ve had a bad relationship with them ever since.”

“...”

Is it still possible for me to quit?

Su Ping was at a loss for words. He had hoped to expand his social circle and learn more secrets about the Star State by joining the alliance; but as it turned out, he only made more enemies in the end.

...

On the other side, the Star State members of the Ouhuang Alliance wore grim expressions when they noticed their arrival. Then, mockery popped up in their eyes.

“The imbeciles from the Alliance of Stars are here.”

The Alliance of Stars was the weirdo among all the alliances.

All their Star State members had strange nicknames, some of them outright insulting.

Everybody knew the quirkiness of the Alliance of Stars.

If it weren’t for the Star Lord cultivation of both the leader and her deputy, they would’ve been destroyed because of their derisive nicknames a long time before.

“What a bunch of idiots. I wonder how they got to the Star State to begin with.”

“Probably with their toes, because they don’t have any brains!”

“Never mind. Don’t cause any trouble. The divine residence is about to open. We’ll settle the scores with them later.”

“Indeed. Looting resources in the divine residence is more important; an unowned Ultra S mysterious realm is hard to come by. All the secret treasures overlooked by the Ascendants are still priceless for us!”

“The Thousand Feathers Alliance is here too. We may have to cooperate with the Alliance of Stars if necessary.”

“That’s true. While the Alliance of Stars is a group of morons, they’re still easier to deal with than the cunning foxes of the Thousand Feathers Alliance.”

The members of the Ouhuang Alliance were also communicating via telepathy.

While they despised the Alliance of Stars and shared a bitter history, it was still a good option in case they needed to join forces.

...

“Those idiots are here too!”

“Just as we expected!”

“The Ouhuang Alliance and the Alliance of Stars have a history. Maybe a chance will pop up to provoke them to fight each other. That way we can take advantage and loot more treasures while they are distracted.”

“That’s right. The Ouhuang Alliance is made of a bunch of retards too. They claim that you’ll be luckier if you join them. That’s hilarious!”

“Who can argue against this claim? Does any idiot on our level believe in luck? It’s effort what really matters!”

“What can you achieve with nothing but luck? They’re just two groups of idiots!”

All the members of the Thousand Feathers Alliance all looked at the Alliance of Stars and the Ouhuang Alliance with a vague disdain.

...

Apart from them, there were other alliances.

However, other alliances had little interaction with the Alliance of Stars in the past, and only considered it as another competitor when it arrived.

It was just the same as any other competing alliances to them.

Besides the alliances, even more rogue experts showed up. There were also Fate State people who stood behind others, knowing that they could only fight for the leftovers.

They would be easily killed if they went to compete with the alliances.

The alliances didn’t do anything to the Fate State guys. It was just like how the three Ascendants were only interested in the best treasures deep inside the divine residence. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After all, the three Ascendants were also competitors. If any of them looted the cheap treasures, the others could get the better ones; that wouldn’t be a good deal.

The case was the same for the Star State experts; they weren’t interested in the garbage that Fate State experts were attracted to, and they would kill them if they dared to compete for what was valuable.

Why didn’t they clear the Fate State guys from the area?

The reason was simple. First of all, murder was forbidden according to Federation law, unless the victim had offended first! It was like how Su Ping executed the sheltered grandson of the Ryan family’s leader, who committed acts of insubordination.

Social hierarchy has a very important space in the federal law!

Secondly, Fate State and Star State experts present had all sorts of forces behind them. It was quite complicated.

Some of them were at the Fate State, but their fathers might have been at the Fate State or even Star Lords!

If they were killed without a good reason, their murderer would be in trouble if their families got back!

To clear the field, one would have to commit a massacre. No one was willing to do that.

Ascendant State warriors didn’t clear the field for their own reasons too.

...

Some other warships and alliances showed up, after Su Ping and his group arrived.

There were also Star State individuals who ripped apart the void and jumped over.

Half an hour later, an old man suddenly flew out of the vortex.

He had a hunched back and white hair, eyebrows and beard. With a smile, he said, “My master, General Polaris, said that this mysterious realm has been officially opened. You’re all free to enter.”

“General Polaris?”

“Is he the one who returned from the expedition right at the border of the Federation?”

“General Polaris is one of the three Ascendants! Oh my god!”

“Lord Polaris is so courteous. Not only did he lift the barriers for us, he even sent a guy to inform us that we could go in.”

Everybody was shocked to hear the name “Polaris” and began to discuss it amongst themselves.

Some of them praised him blatantly.

After all, nobody knew the methods of the Ascendant State. Maybe those guys were also able to overhear the compliments!

The girl suddenly said to the Alliance of Stars group with glittering eyes, “That is General Polaris’s battle pet!”

Everybody in the Alliance of Stars was shocked to hear that.

Is this Lord Polaris’s battle pet?

So, the guy has mastered the ability to metamorphose!

“Is this old man also an Ascendant warrior?” someone asked.

Everybody was shocked.

Is that old man an Ascendant State expert? Very likely!

After all, most battle pet warriors would only signed pets of their own level.

If the Star State used the Fate State pets in, the pets would be killed the moment they were deployed!

They only used the lesser pets to watch over their homes, or for other errands when the Star State pets were temporarily unavailable.

The old man looked around and said with a smile, “The barriers inside this divine residence have been removed, but there are still traps and lethal arrays in the dangerous places guarding treasures. It’s very risky for you to go there. Please take care!”

There was no telling what power he used, but his lips were moving and his voice was spread to everybody’s ears in the vacuum of the universe.

Such a power was beyond their imagination!

After that, the old man slowly turned around and suddenly transformed into a gigantic, aggressive dragon that slithered into the vortex.

The horrifying aura it released swept the place like a tornado, making the Fate State battle pet warriors on the spaceships and warships grow pale.
