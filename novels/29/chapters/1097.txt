Chapter 1098: Opening

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

‘The red-robed young man swiftly escaped to another point in time.

He tried to stay away from the incoming misfortune by hiding in other spaces. Shuai Qianhou followed him closely, constantly tearing his way through the deep spaces as he tried to locate his rival.

Su Ping glanced at them, and eventually decided not to follow, to avoid the risk of discovery. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He shook his head, turned around and left. In any case, he had to rely on himself to get the legacy; allies could turn on him at any moment. He couldn’t trust anyone!

Su Ping returned to the outside world; he saw that Loulan Lin, Diaz and the others were waiting for him at the peak.

Their eyes glittered when they saw Su Ping. Still, they didn’t see Shuai Qianhou, which left them surprised and anxious.

Jiang Si quickly asked, “Junior Brother Su, where is Junior Brother Qianhou?”

Su Ping glanced at him and said calmly, “I was going to help them, but they fought their way to another point in time. I’m not an expert on space and time, so I couldn’t help them. That’s the reason I had to come out.”

Everyone exchanged looks, lost for words.

You’re not an expert on space and time?

But you know the perfect supreme law of chaos. You could have busted through the spaces and caught up to them!

However, they could only accept whatever Su Ping said.

‘They also heaved a sigh, as the trial was truly cruel; even brothers could raise suspicion when dealing with the true god’s legacy.

‘They didn’t think Su Ping was wrong, though; after all, when Shuai Qianhou fought Kepaf, he had also tried to figure out Su Ping’s combat ability by lengthening the battle.

They didn’t know Shuai Qianhou all that well, and didn’t like him that much either.

After all, if Su Ping weren’t powerful enough, all of them would’ve been in a dire situation. That junior brother wanted to kill them along with other people!

“It’s great that you’ve returned safely, Junior Brother Su,” said Yu Jingze.

All the others agreed with him.

‘Wanyan Shuang wore a complicated expression. She was as strong as Kepaf; however, she found herself in a team of monsters.

Could she really beat those people and win the key?

She had thought there was a good chance for her to succeed, but she already felt desperate after seeing the performances of Su Ping, Shuai Qianhou and the red-robed young man.

“Let’s just wait for him here,” said Su Ping. He then checked the time; there was half a day to go until the central continent was opened. There was plenty of time for Shuai Qianhou to return.

“Junior Brother Su, this is all the loot we grabbed from our enemies.” Elena handed some storage treasures to Su Ping; he received them while engrossed in the battle taking place in deep space.

Su Ping glanced at the treasures and accepted them. “You don’t want them?”

“Junior Brother Su, you must be kidding. You and Junior Brother Shuai killed them all. It’s a given that the loot is yours,” said Elena.

Su Ping nodded, then went about examining the storage treasures.

After a quick look, he discovered that there were plenty of treasures; many of them were rare cultivation treasures.

Su Ping simply summoned the Little Skeleton and his other pets, then threw the materials towards them so that they would be strengthened.

“all of them were crazy rich!”

He had conflicting feelings as he looked at the assorted rare materials; many of the materials were very useful, even for him.

He consumed a few special spiritual fruits; a violent stream of energy surged and transformed into deity aura. His body almost exploded; Su Ping had to transfer his power and condense the eighth Astral Painting in his body.

Three stars infused with laws were condensed.

‘At the moment there was only one hour left to go for the central continent’s opening.

Su Ping stopped cultivating. He frowned as he realized a problem: Shuai Qianhou was carrying all the seven tokens, so that neither of them would be able to run away with both the tokens and the ultimate treasure.

The red-robed young man probably had most of the other tokens.

If.

The winner of their battle could just hide and leave with the tokens. Then, the rest of them would remain stuck on that continent, right?

Also, they would be eliminated due to the lack of tokens by the end of the trial?

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and looked at the distance. His master had told him that the tokens were of critical importance, and that he would have to fly to the central continent on his own if he didn’t have tokens.

However, Ascendant State beasts left by the Celestials roamed the skies, so that nobody would be able to cheat.

In the worst-case scenario, he would have to take the risk and fly to the central continent!

“Why is he still not coming back?”

Yu Jingze and the others paced back and forth while they waited anxiously.

Some of them looked at Su Ping, hoping he would offer support to Shuai Qianhou, but held back in the end.

After all, Shuai Qianhou was fighting in the seventh space, which was extremely dangerous.

‘They had gone and taken a look at the sixth space while Su Ping condensed stars, but they didn’t see Shuai Qianhou or his opponent.

It was a breeze for someone with the perfect path of space to use it as an advantage; for instance, transferring the battlefield to the seventh space to pressure the other.

However, the seventh space was dangerous even for them; even geniuses like Su Ping would meet with danger if they stayed there for too long!

Jiang Si approached Su Ping and said anxiously, “Junior Brother Su, this is not good. We won’t have any tokens if anything happens to both our junior brother and the other guy…”

Su Ping frowned but remained silent.

“Junior Brother Su, we didn’t find any tokens elsewhere. They are probably holding the ten tokens assigned to this continent,” said Yu Jingze who also moved closer.

Su Ping looked at them and asked, “Senior brothers, what are you suggesting?”

‘They looked at each other and became nervous. Jiang Si whispered, “We want you to help him, Junior Brother Su. We’re too weak to help him; we can only count on you.”

Elena and Yu Jingze were also looking at his junior brother with hopeful eyes.

Loulan Lin’s lips moved as if about to speak, but she made an effort to keep quiet.

She didn’t want Su Ping to encounter danger again. After all, the red-robed young man was definitely not a kindhearted person, and his deadly strike was no joke. But, if Su Ping didn’t go, she would miss the opportunity of grabbing the legacy. She felt awfully sorry for Su Ping at the moment!

After a long pause, Su Ping finally said, “Let’s wait thirty minutes more.”

Everybody was relieved; Su Ping had accepted their request.

Jiang Si was going to say something else, but Yu Jingze pulled his arm. He instantly closed his mouth.

Half an hour… There would be even less time remaining before the opening of the central continent. Was Su Ping really confident in their reappearance in thirty minutes?

‘A vague space ripple appeared while everybody was quiet.

Su Ping tuned around.

Shuai Qianhou painted a sorry sight as he walked out. There was a lot of blood on his armor; his face was also pale. He didn’t look half as poised as before.

Yu Jingze and the others felt relieved. They would still have tokens as long as Shuai Qianhou returned.

“How did it go?” asked Su Ping calmly. He stared at Shuai Qianhou.

The latter took a deep breath and soothed his chaotic aura. He said coldly, “Senior Brother Su, why didn’t you help me? The other two were no threat to you whatsoever, were they? You have two perfect paths, including the supreme law of chaos!”

‘The atmosphere instantly became intense.

Yu Jingze and the others were going to comfort him, but then stopped and became nervous, fearing that those two would continue fighting.

Following Shuai Qianhou’s demand, Su Ping calmly asked again, “So, how did it go?”

Fury flashed in his junior’s eyes. The man said, “That guy knows a supreme perfect law too. He cannot be killed! He ran for it, and has a token! We can only find him again on the central continent!”

Su Ping glanced at him and nodded, not bothering about anything else.

Shuai Qianhou said angrily, “Senior Brother Su, you haven’t answered my question yet. Shouldn’t we be helping each other as brothers?”

Su Ping had already gone back to his relaxed, usual self. He acted slightly surprised, then quickly said, “Junior brother, you misunderstood me. I went to look for you, but you were in the seventh space; I can barely move there. I wouldn’t be able to help even if I wanted to!”

“You know the law of chaos. How could you barely move there?”

“But the law of chaos isn’t very effective in space,” said Su Ping innocently, “Junior brother, do you know the law of chaos better than I do?”

Pff!

Shuai Qianhou nearly choked.

Indeed, he didn’t dare say he knew that better than Su Ping did.

However, he certainly knew what the man should be capable of!

The man said while Infuriated, “Senior Brother Su, weren’t you afraid I might leave with the tokens and leave you forever stuck, even if you had the ultimate treasure?”

Su Ping was surprised. “Why would I? We’re brothers. You’d never do that kind of thing, junior brother, would you?”

Shuai Qianhou gazed at him, and finally gave up talking.

Despite fifty thousand years of cultivation, he found he wasn’t nearly as shameless and good at talking as his “Senior Brother Su.”

Su Ping smiled. “Junior brother, let us make preparations; it won’t be easy when we go to the central continent.”

“Indeed. Junior brother, we’re all brothers. Junior Brother Su indeed went to look for you. So did we; it’s just that we didn’t find you.” Yu Jingze and the others quickly eased the tension.

Shuai Qianhou scoffed; that didn’t look good.

However, he was actually much calmer than he looked.

‘There was a body inside his storage space, riddled with holes and utterly deformed.

However, the ragged clothes covering the body were red.

Everybody immediately began to discuss how to find the key on the central continent.

Su Ping went to see the members of the Loulan family and said, “The central continent is even more dangerous. Are you sure you want to go there? I can give you three tokens if you’re willing to stay. You can simply wait there until the second test of the trial begins..”
