Chapter 1543: March (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Time moved on.

More and more species arrived to the Ti Tuo continent from various places of chaos. Some were refugees whose universes were destroyed, and some were taken there by Yin Que.

The number of forces gathered was multiplied by several fold in the blink of an eye.

In the passing of the few thousand years prior, their number surpassed the statistics from past eras.

There were no counters nor rooms in the enormous, pebble-shaped store. It was empty, but it seemed to contain an infinite space, which would be enough to swallow an entire universe.

“Are you ready?” said the Mother of Chaos as she quietly watched Su Ping come out from his cultivation sites’ outings.

Ten thousand years had passed. Su Ping was emitting a mature yet discreet aura at the moment. His appearance was the same, but his eyes were deep and bright, as if able to see through everything.

“I’ve already hit the bottleneck,” he said.

Exactly as planned, he had condensed the three thousand Great Daos and turned them into Undying Universes; his combat ability had reached the maximum.

Furthermore, he received the Golden Crow ancestor’s blood and awakened the Golden Crow bloodline, which allowed him to grasp the Ever-Burning Flame of their clan.

The Undying Universe based on that flame was as powerful as the universe of original chaos. The power of those two universes alone was enough for him to dominate the Undying State.

The system asked Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo and Shi Mang for their blood, hoping to further strengthen the human host. However, both refused. Neither she, nor Su Ping insisted.

The Mother of Chaos said, “If there’s enough time, you can also condense the Lesser Daos into Undying Universes; however, the improvement is limited and the time it takes would be too long. It’s time to go.”

Su Ping was the leader she had picked, and was more than satisfied with his current status. His growth was beyond her expectations, which was a pleasant surprise.

Su Ping nodded with a slight motion. He still had some room for improvement, but it wouldn’t be significant.

His personal strength wasn’t decisive, as the war spanned all across history. He had to rely on everybody’s strength and the four Sorcerer Ancestors’ support in order to win.

The Mother of Chaos turned around. The store was slowly opened, then turned into a gentle light that fused into her body. That place became an empty ground.

Stunned, Su Ping said, “The store…”

“It’s part of my body. I’m now taking it back,” said the Mother of Chaos.

He nodded, then looked around. He felt somewhat sad; the ever-present store, always keeping him company, had just disappeared.

Was it a sign?

Suddenly, a crisp voice sounded, “Brother!”

Slightly dazed, Su Ping turned around and noticed the approaching group of familiar people.

The one who called out to him was none other than his proud sister, Su Lingyue.

He was surprised to hear her call him brother in public.

Next to her were his parents and other familiar faces from the Blue Planet, including Zhong Lingtong, the student he had recruited back then.

The Qin family was there, including their patriarch, Qin Duhuang.

The earliest legendary warriors on the Blue Planet were there, including Xue Yunzhen and Ye Wuxiu.

The Zhou family was there, whose houses were razed to the ground by him.

The Tang family also made an appearance.

A few people were standing in front of the Tang Family forces. One of them looked very similar to Tang Ruyan, except that she seemed much colder and more decisive.

Su Ping didn’t need to ask to know she was Tang Ruyu, Tang Ruyan’s sister.

Once the Blue Planet jumped closer to the Federation region of influence, the Tang Family asked Tang Ruyan to be their leader. However, she was in Su Ping’s store and had no time for that. The latter learned later that she had entrusted all family affairs to her sister.

The two sisters had become enemies at one point in time, but they returned to being sisters again in the end.

Su Ping didn’t ask what happened, but he felt happy for Tang Ruyan; after all, it was always a difficult test to part from one’s family.

In addition, he saw some people he had met on the Blue Planet. Some were the top students found there, while others were legendary-level warriors who had fought by his side during the Deep Caves’ invasion. They were all Star Lords now.

“Boss Su.”

Qin Duhuang—the old patriarch of the Qin family—looked at Su Ping in fright. The things that transpired back on their planet was but a distant memory to all of them. However, they entered that universe along with Su Ping, and witnessed his growth; they could only admire him whenever they thought of him.

“What are you doing here?” Su Ping rolled his eyes and said to Su Lingyue, “There’s no need to take part in the war. You’re too weak; you can simply stay here and wait for me to return.”

Su Lingyue stuck out her tongue. “Can you not be so blunt? Now that you’ve guessed it, we’ll be blunt as well. We’ve all heard a lot about the upcoming war…”

She stared at Su Ping and added, “Brother, I didn’t have a chance to fight by your side in the past, but this time, we will surely fight together.”

“That’s right, son,” Su Yuanshan said with a comforting smile on his face, “If you fail, we’ll die sooner or later. Being the case, we should stay together as a family.”

“That’s right. I’ve discussed it with your father. Do not stop us,” said his mother.

“Boss Su, we’re also going to participate in the war!” said Qin Duhuang, Ye Wuxiu and the others. They all gave Su Ping determined looks.

The latter’s expression changed a bit, then he looked at them thoughtfully. He didn’t try stopping them anymore. He nodded and said, “In that case, you must try your best to survive.”

“We will survive together.” Relieved, Su Lingyue put on a sunny smile.

Su Ping looked at her, then beckoned.

She felt somewhat puzzled, but she walked over anyway.

Su Ping reached down and rubbed her head, messing up her neatly combed hair. He said, “If you’re that eager to fight, let me see your performance.”

She didn’t move to break free from Su Ping’s grasp as she usually would. Instead, she lowered her head with bloodshot eyes.

Su Ping’s hands slid down and he hugged her. It was the first time he had embraced that sister of his, and possibly the last.

The others felt troubled when they saw this, knowing it was very likely that they would die in the war. However, if they didn’t fight, they would still die when their side lost.

In that case, fighting was the better option. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This time I’m also going with you!” said someone…

Su Ping turned around and noticed Tang Ruyan, Green Lady and the others arrive. The cauldron woman was also there.

“She told me everything. The store is gone anyway; it doesn’t make sense for the boss to be fighting in the frontlines while his employees only watch. You can’t stop me!” Tang Ruyan gritted her teeth.

Su Ping glanced at the Mother of Chaos and them. He nodded and said, “I won’t stop you. If you want to come along, just come along.”

Relieved, Tang Ruyan discarded her anxiety. She happily jumped closer to where Su Ping was, then said, “I’ll show you the results of my cultivation in the past few days!”

“All right.”

Green Lady stood at the rear with a gentle smile on her face. She seemed to be thinking about something from a distant past. She would probably see the Deity King…

“Humph. You’re just some ordinary lives. Why bother?” said an entity after a light snort. Then, the rays in the void were consumed, and a black-robed young man stepped out with a domineering, and suffocating aura.

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. He released an aura to cover all the people present, then looked up to see the black-robed expert. “Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo, the war is drawing near. You’d better not annoy me!”

“Huh?” Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo raised his eyebrows and glanced at Su Ping.

The Mother of Chaos rose and glanced at Ti Tuo casually. “He’s right.”
