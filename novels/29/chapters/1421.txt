Chapter 1422 Invite the Ancestral God (2)

Involving the Ancestral Gods would trigger an Ancestral Gods’ battle, and the Rain Clan’s Ancestral God would probably lose…

The Rain Emperor hesitated, and Lin Tianzhan also showed a slight change of expression, realizing the terrible situation.

“That’s all right; we must not let him go today. The Rain Clan is not entirely helpless, and the three Ancestral Gods from the Heaven Path Institute are not invincible!”

Lin Tianzhan’s eyes glittered. He gritted his teeth in the end, then said to the Rain Emperor, “Go invite the Ancestral God and tell him what happened. He will have a solution!”

The Rain Emperor felt dazed for a moment. He didn’t reply, seeing the latter’s determination, and merely nodded, quickly disappearing

“You…”

Elder Yan Qing and the others changed their expressions, not expecting him to be so decisive. Would the long peace in the world of gods finally be broken?

However, with everything reaching that point, they had no choice except to fight!

An elder quickly disappeared and returned to the Heaven Path Institute.

Yan Qing said to Su Ping, “Dao Child, return to the institute with us immediately.”

Su Ping turned around and looked at them. The turn of events was slightly surprising, but he wasn’t entirely unprepared. Even if the enemy was so furious that their Ancestral God would take action, Su Ping wasn’t scared. The worst possibility was death, and he could resurrect anyway. The Chaos Perception Dragon had failed to kill him a while back; he didn’t think that other Ancestral Gods could

That is, unless they imprisoned him and tortured him until all his energy points for resurrecting was used up.

However, Su Ping was no longer a weakling. He would never let that happen.

“Elders, I’m responsible for what I did. There’s no need to ask the Ancestral Gods for help,” said Su Ping to Elder Yan and the others, “My true body is somewhere else. They can’t kill me, even if their Ancestral God does come.”

“Huh?”

Elder Yan Qing and the others narrowed their eyes and looked at Su Ping in shock.

“Your true body? Dao Child, what do you

mean?”

“Dao Child, is this just an incarnation of yours?”

All the elders looked at Su Ping in shock and soon felt enlightened. No wonder Su Ping is so audacious. So, he already made plans.

Besides, that also explains why he’s so tough and monstrous. Does his true body have an Ancestral God’s cultivation?

However, they remembered that there wasn’t an Ancestral God among humans. So, it was possible that Su Ping was the Ancestral God from another clan who reincarnated in a human body.

They brainstormed and made a lot of guesses, enlightenment dawning on them even more.

“More or less. In any case, nothing will happen to me. I hope that you won’t ask the Ancestral Gods for help; I don’t want to get too many people involved in this matter,” said Su Ping.

His enemy was aware of the institute’s three Ancestral Gods but was still bold enough to summon their own, so they probably had other trump cards. Even if they didn’t, other clans would step in if Ancestral Gods decided to fight; win or lose, the Heaven Path Institute would suffer a heavy loss. After all, it was just a school where the students of thousands of clans gathered, while the world of gods was dominated by high-ranked clans, such as the Rain Clan.

“You…”

Yan Qing and the others exchanged bewildered looks, hesitating.

“I really hope you do as I said,” was Su Ping’s sincere plea.

Yan Qing gazed at the young human. “You’re not lying, are you? If you’re doing this only because you don’t want to become a burden to us, don’t worry!”

“No, I never lie,” said Su Ping solemnly.

Elder Chan instantly changed his expression, his lips twitching. He stood up and said solemnly, “Earlier today, you lied to me that you wouldn’t come to the Rain Clan territory, but you did. This matter concerns your life. This is no laughing matter!”

Yan Qing and the others looked at Su Ping with a strange expression.

Su Ping was instantly embarrassed. He coughed and said, “That was just a joke. I’m serious right now. Who would ever joke about their life? I have to become an Ancestral God in the future.”

All of them looked at Su Ping with dubious eyes. They found him suspicious, but his words made sense. Nobody would want to get killed unless something was wrong up there in their head, right?

“Since the Rain Clan is summoning their old ancestor, I’ll be the bigger man here and let him go. That way I won’t be accused of being mean to an old dog. I’ll be on my way then.” Su Ping waved at Elder Yan and the others.

Lin Tianzhan was so infuriated by Su Ping’s claim that he almost charged out of the circle. He clenched his fists; insulting an Ancestral God was a capital offense in the world of gods. Ancestral Gods were superior, never to be affronted.

Yan Qing and the others felt rather helpless. They guessed that Su Ping’s true body was very likely another Ancestral God, and it was fine for him to curse one of his peers. Yan Qing urged, “Go then. Even if this is just an incarnation, it would still be a shame to have it erased like this.”

Su Ping nodded and was about to leave

Exactly at that moment, a loud laugh burst out in the void. Then, many figures tore openings in the void and stood in Su Ping’s way.

“You’ve caused trouble and now you want to run? Is this how the Heaven Path Institute teaches their Dao Children?”

“Emperor Heaven Destroyer, have you slacked off over the years? You can’t even finish off a God King?”

Altogether seven figures stood in midair and glowed. It seemed that all of them were God Emperors.

Each of them appeared to be standing in independent times and spaces. They were centers of the universe, surrounded by infinite Great Daos.

Elder Yan changed her expression and demanded, “People of the Chentian Clan, why are you here?”

The handsome emperor in the lead said casually, “The Rain Clan is our ally. Naturally, we’re here to teach this ignorant junior a lesson on behalf of our friend. Oh, by saying friend, I don’t mean the Heaven Path Institute; don’t forget to pay me for lecturing your Dao Child.”

“Chentian Clan, you’re way out of line by trying to teach our Dao Child. There are no grudges between us; better stay clear of trouble,” said Yan Qing angrily.

“What are you talking about? As I said, we’re not here for you, we came to aid our old comrades. Besides, your Dao Child has insulted emperors in public and provoked a high-ranking clan. How can he get away so easily?” The handsome emperor chuckled.

“Years back, the prince of the Chentian Clan was too naughty and refused to enter the Heaven Path Institute; we never forbade him entry. Why hold a senseless grudge for so long?” Yan Qing didn’t want to beat around the bush and said straight out, “Today, the Dao Child challenged God Emperors with a God King cultivation. He’s shown the Rain Clan enough respect, and all the God Emperors of the Rain Clan failed to defeat him. Do you have the face to force him to stay?”

“A mere God King dares to challenge a high-ranked clan? That’s insubordination and should be punishable with death!”

The handsome God Emperor chuckled. “As for the past incident, I’m glad our prince wasn’t admitted by your institute. Otherwise, it would have truly been sad to see him become as arrogant and insubordinate as this Dao Child!”

“Get out of the way!” roared Yan Qing, not wanting to waste any more time.

“Haha…”

The handsome God Emperor chuckled and wanted to say something else, only to be interrupted by Su Ping, who also stopped Elder Yan and the others. He said casually, “It doesn’t matter. If more people want to get killed, I’ll kill some more before the Ancestral God arrives. You’re just a few emperors, and you’re talking about insubordination? Let’s see who’s the senior and who’s the junior here!”

He suddenly held his spear and attacked.

After a boom, the void exploded and Su Ping approached in an instant.

“Watch out!” said Lin Tianzhan with narrowed eyes, still within the protective circle. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The handsome God Emperor was stunned, obviously not expecting the human to attack the Chentian Clan. Infuriated, he laughed and said, “What an arrogant scumbag. Let’s see what you’ve got!”

He waved the folded fan he was holding, sending out a universe that was split into countless universes, filling up the world.

“What a petty trick. You think it’s worth displaying?” Su Ping smiled disdainfully. His long spear pierced and twisted the world. All the power within a 10,000 kilometer range was gathered in one point and pushed out.

Boom. The universe collapsed with an enormous explosion. Su Ping’s long spear pierced the universe, shattering the handsome God Emperor’s robe, and dug into his shoulder.

“You!”

The handsome God Emperor was shocked and frightened. Nobody would ever know how terrifying and destructive Su Ping’s spear was unless they experienced it in person!

“Who’s the senior and who’s the junior?!” Su Ping roared, his dazzling spear aura swallowing his enemy.
