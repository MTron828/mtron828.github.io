Chapter 1378: Arrival (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

An endless surge of power was injected into the divine array. The Titan, whose light had been fading, was glowing brilliantly again, like a reignited candle—

But this time, it was burning Celestial vitality as fuel.

Those Celestial State experts had proven at that moment how deserving they were of their titles and everyone’s respect. Experts or their stature were expected to stand in front of them and endure all suffering with their toughness!

Su Ping didn’t hesitate anymore once he felt the power surging. He roared and stepped forward again, unleashing infinite power with his sword.

Slash!!

The faith and power of the thirty-six Celestials were combined into the brilliant sword aura at that moment, cutting through the void.

The member of the Heavens was shocked and infuriated. He didn’t expect his opponents to be that crazy, being willing to die together with him.?Don’t they cherish their lives at all?

He wanted to back off. However, the embarrassing thought of “escape” made him tremble angrily.

Even so, the threat to his life prompted him to retreat for the moment.

When retreating, he certainly wouldn’t turn around and give his back to the enemy. Su Ping’s sword was too fast to be avoided in the primary universe.

It was also impossible to tear the void open; after all, the sword could easily penetrate all the way through the ninth space.

The member of the Heavens suddenly faded, turning from a real entity into a phantom made of smoke.

He was enshrouded in a hazy and strange law, like a shadow about to fade away!

......

“The Path of Illusion?”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He didn’t expect his enemy to show the power of illusion or escape through the World of Illusion!

A lot of information flashed in his head. He was shocked and infuriated; however, his hand didn’t slow down in the slightest. His sword slashed instantly while releasing the power of his chaos universe, covered in unusual laws.

“Huh?”

The member of the Heavens was shocked.

The next moment—the sword was abrupt as it struck the creature’s body.

His fading body was reconstituted when it came in touch with the sword. It was hurled back into reality, becoming clear and vivid. Also, the moment it became clear, his body was cut into halves!

Black blood splashed in the void and burned it, causing holes everywhere. It seemed that the blood had a strong corrosive nature.

“No way!”

The member of the Heavens stared at Su Ping in disbelief. However, the remaining thought in his body was blasted by a strong willpower that came from the Heaven Executing Technique and was soon swallowed. His consciousness was extinguished.

The burning Heavenly Fire gradually died down.

The member of the Heavens was knocked tens of thousands of miles away, until he gradually came to a halt and floated in the void. His body fell apart like dust and vanished.

Su Ping felt that all his power had been emptied. He was so exhausted that he could barely keep his eyes open; however, he gritted his teeth and summoned more strength to completely destroy the enemy’s body.

Su Ping seemed gloomy as he watched the body turn to dust. According to his senses, the enemy was already dead, but he died in a strange way. The body seemed to have been attracted to something. It didn’t stay in the universe or fall into deeper spaces; rather, all the particles that constituted the body entered the World of Illusion.

Su Ping remembered how he had grasped the law of illusion. He had almost been crushed by a finger in the World of Illusion.

At the thought of it, the finger probably belonged to a member of the Heavens.

Is it possible that the World of Illusion is where the Heavens live?

No, that’s impossible. The World of Illusion is part of this universe. If that’s where the Heavens live, they can enter our universe any time they wish…

Su Ping’s expression changed. The Heavens had a long history and were quite mysterious. He couldn’t wrap his head around the situation.

“Pu!”

At that moment—the other Celestials in the divine array spouted blood and looked pale.

The Titan’s body disappeared as the divine array could no longer be sustained. Su Ping’s pets and a handful of Celestials, including Shen Huang, were able to hold back their tiredness, but the others had already passed out. Some were even dying, floating aimlessly in the void, as if unable to even lift a finger.

“It’s finally over.”

Shen Huang breathed heavily as he stared at the disintegrating body from one of the members of the Heavens. Although he was in pain and tired, he was delighted.

The biggest problem was the worms, and it was taken care of, just like that.

Without the alien, the worms were nothing to be afraid of!

The war they had planned to fight for a thousand years was won in advance. How could they not be thrilled?

The Celestials looked at each other with feeble smiles. Some were too tired to smile, but the delight in their eyes was obvious.

It’s over.

The peace—which they were used to in the past and were yearning for today—would be restored.

Loud exclamations burst out in the human defense lines in the quiet space after the war. Everybody looked at the scene in disbelief and hopped excitedly; some were so happy that they even started to cry. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They won!

The Celestial State experts had worked together to win the war!

On the planets behind the defense lines—all the people who watched the scene exclaimed in excitement. Some were shedding tears as they remembered their family members who died in the war. If that final clash had taken place sooner, maybe their family members wouldn’t have died.

In any case, dawn was coming.
