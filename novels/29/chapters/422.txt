Chapter 423 The Doggie’s Heaven’s Test

“Yeah,” Su Ping replied, “I don’t need a week. You can come and pick it up tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow?”

Qin Shuhai didn’t know what to say.

He had traveled extensively across many base cities and visited many pet stores, where he met many master trainers. But never once did he hear that anyone could finish training a battle pet within a day.

Unless the training was casual. But in that case, the effect would be weak.

As such, Qin Shuhai was even more convinced that Su Ping was bullying people,

That being said, he couldn’t voice that doubt.

What could he do even if Su Ping was ripping him off?

Of course, he could only give money to Su Ping willingly!

He was there to support Su Ping’s business. In other words, he went there to give money to Su Ping. Since Su Ping didn’t even hide his money-grabbing intentions, Qin Shuhai could only oblige.

“Well... fine. I’ll come back and pick up my pet tomorrow,” Qin Shuhai replied with a smile while he inwardly blurted out some curses.

Su Ping asked, “Do you want general training or professional training?”

He didn’t hide his anticipation.

Qin Shuhai was about to ask about the differences between the two when he noticed the price list which astonished him.

One hundred million... for professional training?

Qin Shuhai blinked.

His eyes did not lie to him. It was not ten thousand. It was one hundred million!

No kidding. Su Ping was pricing his services in millions!

How ridiculous that was!

Qin Shuhai curled his lips. Not even the top-level master trainers would charge such exorbitant prices.

Besides, when those master trainers did charge one hundred million, the training would take at least a month, and such training would be considered to have the highest quality!

And yet, Su Ping claimed that he could finish the process in one day when he charged one hundred million?!

He was practically telling everyone that he was ripping them off.

Qin Shuhai turned around. Su Ping’s glowing eyes almost froze Qin Shuhai on the spot. The latter pushed down the urge to use swear words and produced a forced smile. “Well then... professional training it is.”

He felt he had exhausted his energy as he uttered those words.

His heart was dripping blood.

He was giving away one hundred million to Su Ping!

He had to pay the money by himself!

No, he had to go back and get reimbursed! Qin Shuhai decided. The pain in his heart was eased somewhat.

He hoped that spending one hundred million could bring them a little bit closer. That would make the expenditure more worthwhile.

“Brother Qin, what good eyes you have!” Su Ping praised Qin Shuhai.

Qin Shuhai laughed a hollow laugh.

Now you call me Brother Qin?

Why didn’t you say anything when I called you Mr. Su? You seemed to be enjoying that! Although resentful, there was nothing Qin Shuhai could have done.

Theoretically speaking, he and Su Ping didn’t share a close relationship. They merely came to know each other because of the trades they conducted while in the Mysterious Realm.

Truth be told, Qin Shuhai wanted to befriend Su Ping because he valued his talent and intended to invite him to join the Qin family. Qin Shuhai would have never wasted time chatting with just anyone. Back then, he didn’t know that Su Ping was a diamond in the rough. It turned out that the Qin family wasn’t good enough for Su Ping and they could never afford to offend him!

“Sure thing. Brother Su, you have my full trust.”

Qin Shuhai buried that thought deep in his heart, not letting anything show. He had already paid the money. Displeasing Su Ping would do him no good at this point. Qin Shuhai had to use the chance and butter Su Ping up. At the same time, he did the natural thing of changing his form of address to “Brother Su” again.

After all, Su Ping was the one who called him Brother Qin first. Going back to calling him Brother Su was not impolite at this point. Su Ping didn’t pay attention to that; to call each other brothers was normal. As people always said, it was always a pleasure to greet a friend from afar and everyone who came with money was a friend.

As a qualified store owner, he had to build up a deep, monetary... no, pure friendship with his customers!

“Joanna, come and take the turtle away,” Su Ping said to Joanna who was standing by the pet room’s door. He asked this of her so that the pet wouldn’t get in the way. The Earthen Turtle was mild in nature. But as Joanna stepped closer, its keen sense noticed something and instincts kicked in. The Earthen Turtle felt a strange pressure; it became afraid, as if a natural enemy was near. The Earthen Turtle stepped back slowly, unwilling to be close to that petite girl. Qin Shuhai looked at the girl with the golden hair, startled. He felt his heart skip a beat. Previously, the girl had used one spear and killed the Dark Feather Phoenix, and with just one more move, she deterred the three Tang family elders and killed two thousand battle pet warriors of the Tang family. He still remembered that scene vividly. Clearly afraid, Qin Shuhai bowed and said with respect, “Nice to meet you.”

Joanna stopped and darted a glance at him. “Hmm. You don’t deserve to talk to me.”

Pff!

So... straightforward. Qin Shuhai curled his lips.

He was just trying to be polite.Did you have to be so mean?

Su Ping frowned and said to Joanna, “Be careful and polite. Brother Qin is our customer and a customer is a god!

“Yeah well, he’s not worthy enough to talk to you but you shouldn’t have said it out loud. How harsh the words must have sounded to him! What if Brother Qin felt inferior and stopped coming to the store, then we wouldn’t be able to make money... make a friend out of him!”

Joanna raised her eyebrows. “I understand.” She nodded to Su Ping.

Qin Shuhai: OVO!

I was right!

Slip of the tongue!

Unethical! You dirty merchant!

But what was more surprising for Qin Shuhai was that Su Ping dared to talk to the legendary battle pet warrior like that.

How come you’re not afraid that she could slap you to death?

Previously, Qin Shuhai thought the girl was Su Ping’s teacher.

But the conversation had shifted his initial thoughts.

He had to say, this was an important piece of information!

That being said... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

On second thought, this information was useless.

What was the point whether she was his teacher or not?

This legendary battle pet warrior was still here with Su Ping and it seemed that their relationship was close.

As long as the girl was still with him, no one would dare to upset Su Ping!

However, this trip to the store was not entirely futile. At least, he found out the name of the girl from Su Ping.

Joanna.

Not a good name.

Oh no, an uncommon name in the Subcontinent District.

She must be from another continent!

But why would she come to the Subcontinent District? Why weren’t the two legendary battle pet warriors in this Subcontinent District giving any responses? This was their territory!

Qin Shuhai had many questions unanswered. He was just a titled battle pet warrior and he didn’t have the right to communicate with a legendary battle pet warrior just yet. Only people like Venerable the Blade who was at the peak of the titled rank could find some way to take a peek into the world of the legendary battle pet warriors.

Or, if he joined the Tower and worked for the legendary battle pet warriors, he could get involved in their world as well.

He was fine with it, even if working in the Tower meant he would be bullied. At the very least, he could take a look at them.

But Qin Shuhai didn’t plan on joining the Tower. He would never leave easily once he did. The titled battle pet warriors who were working in the Tower could disclose much about the situation in the Tower, not even about the most trivial matters. For example, if someone even commented about a legendary battle pet warrior’s stinky feet, the latter would end the former’s life.

“Let’s go,” Joanna said to the Earthen Turtle.

With that, she gave it a condescending and kind look.

The Earthen Turtle was shaking, even trying to hide in its shell.

The Earthen Turtle’s fear and resistance pulled Qin Shuhai back to reality. Given Joanna’s identity, he understood why his battle pet would be scared.

He wasn’t doing any better. He immediately calmed the Earthen Turtle down so that it would go after Joanna.

Qin Shuhai gently comforted the Earthen Turtle for a long while before it was willing to go after Joanna, albeit quite slowly.

At a speed of two centimeters per minute...

Joanna had already arrived in the pet room. She turned around, only to see that the Earthen Turtle was still near the counter. She gave the Earthen Turtle an even kinder look.

Whoosh!

The Earthen Turtle suddenly began to walk at a fast and vigorous pace; it was a speed that not even a trackman could reach. The Earthen Turtle went to the pet room and vanished into it.

A racing turtle!

Qin Shuhai was surprised and worried.

But since Su Ping was running a business, he wouldn’t kill the battle pet.

“Come back tomorrow,” Su Ping reminded Qin Shuhai.

Qin Shuhai nodded and replied with a forced smile, “Thank you, Brother Su” “You’re welcome. We’re friends, you know.”

“Sure, I know.”

When Qin Shuhai turned around and went away, the others waiting in line gazed at him with surprise.

The Earthen Turtle was a battle pet with a ninth-rank bloodline.

That Earthen Turtle had reached the ninth-rank.

A person who could control a battle pet like this would at least be an advanced battle pet warrior; being a master battle pet warrior was very likely!

Many people watched Qin Shuhai respectfully as he left.

A master battle pet warrior was not all that easy to meet.

That was part of the reason why people were questioning the authenticity of the incredible battle outside the store.

More customers came after Qin Shuhai left.

Soon, all spots had been taken.

Though it pained Su Ping to say goodbye to the huge crowd, he had to do so.

After the customers were gone, Su Ping closed the door, grabbed Joanna and hurried to the Demigod Burial at once. He planned on finishing training all the battle pets overnight.

Besides, since he had spent five days in the Mysterious Realm, there had to be more people in the Demigod Burial ready for their Heaven’s Tests again. Su Ping could loaf off another round of Heaven’s Tests to refine his strength.

I’m going to take care of the store’s business tonight and let Joanna take care of the store tomorrow. I have to get the mission done first. I do have a week but I would rather get it over with earlier. A long delay may cause trouble.

Su Ping developed a plan.

He went to the Demigod Burial again.

He missed the familiar smell.

Joanna was in a better mood since she went back after five days.

When Joanna returned to her residence, the many Celestial Gods were gladly surprised. They had thought something had happened to her.

Joanna comforted her subordinates and began to help Su Ping out.

Su Ping let Joanna take away all the middle-rank battle pets that needed professional training and told her to get someone to take care of the pets.

As for the Earthen Turtle, the training would be much harder so Su Ping was going to do that himself.

But before that, he had to finish the Heaven’s Tests first.

The notice for finding people who were about to take Heaven’s Tests was still posted. In this world, almost two months had passed when only five days had gone by in the outside world.

Over ten people about to go through the test were gathered during this time.

The guard protecting the mountain said that there were more than thirty people originally, but some of them could no longer hold back and had to finish the test first.

Some waited too long without hearing back from Joanna so they gave up on waiting for her and left.

Those ten had arrived recently.

Su Ping felt quite sorry but feeling sorry wouldn’t get those who left back. He had to take what he could get.

This time, Su Ping took the Little Skeleton with him as well. The seventh-rank Little Skeleton couldn’t be revived in the cultivation site when the professional training was unavailable. But this day, he could start torturing the Little Skeleton again.

Soon, a thundercloud with a diameter of more than one hundred thousand meters appeared in the sky!

This time, Su Ping was not the reason, but... the Golden Dragon Hound!

This was its turn!

The Golden Dragon Hound could only stir up a thundercloud of over thirty thousand meters but that had increased to over one hundred thousand meters!

Su Ping never saw that coming and Joanna was dumbstruck. She would have never thought that... she wasn’t even better than a dog!

No way could it happen here! This had come as a heavy blow for Joanna.

She could understand that Su Ping was more talented than she was because of the mysterious and ancient being.

But this dog... No way!
