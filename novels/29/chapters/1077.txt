Chapter 1078: Origin

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Based on his experience back in the Sea of Illusions, Su Ping extended his consciousness and carefully examined the features of the Source World.

Still, the Source World was unlike the Sea of Illusions, where void laws and Illusory Spirits could be felt everywhere. At the moment he could not feel neither time nor space; everything seemed to be frozen, but was somehow flowing at the same time.

The stillness was felt—

However, the flow was visible to the naked eye.

Su Ping felt he was in the middle of a frozen painting that would never be changed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even so, everything was constantly changing before his eyes. Something seemed to have blocked Su Ping’s senses, preventing him from truly feeling the Source World.

It accommodates countless paths and never changes. Every path seems to have its own trajectory. This is the core of all worlds. It’s like the chip of the most delicate machine.

Why are the path sources attracted to this place?

What’s attracting them?

Su Ping continued to ponder. Countless thoughts rolled in his head; his brain had been significantly developed and his mind was sharp. He was inferring things based on the information he had, just as he tried to find the answer.

There was the likelihood of him finding the wrong answer. In that case, he would have to start all over.

Time flew.

Su Ping seemed to be frozen in the Source World. He completely forgot the passage of time. A long while passed; maybe a day, a year, ten years, or even a thousand years!

Countless paths were rising and falling around him; some melted, while others separated, as if something new was being created.

The thousands of paths here might have been the same one at the beginning!

Su Ping raised his head and looked at the brilliant river above his head. While seen from a distance, the countless paths seemed to look like a thick path, when considered as a whole.

Everything is created from nothing!

Source… This is the Source World of all paths. It’s the beginning of all worlds!

The only thing that can accommodate paths is another path!

The only thing able to attract paths is another path!

This is the origin!

Su Ping’s head was ringing. His spread consciousness in the void touched upon something. A brilliant law was gathering slowly before him.

The law began to consolidate and gradually turn into a round point, just like a singularity.

It contained all kinds of laws and features, while having infinite variations and possibilities!

That was the law of origin!

Apart from the four supreme laws, there are also the laws of illusion and origin…

He was both shocked and enlightened after he stared at the law of origin, then felt the traits and energy contained.

The four supreme laws only applied to the universes. But beyond all the universes, there were worlds independently formed by supreme laws, such as the Sea of Illusions and the Source World!

Su Ping took a deep breath; he had understood a lot of things. He also found the way to condense a fourth small world.

The law of origin was enough to help him establish a third small world!

Su Ping closed his eyes and withdrew the laws he had grasped, as he continued to deepen his understanding and consolidation.

Time flew.

While in a trance, Su Ping didn’t know how long it had been. The longer he stayed in the Source World, the deeper his understanding of the law of origin was.

Su Ping’s body shook exactly at that moment, and his meditation was disrupted. He was forced to leave the Source World. He then opened his eyes, only to see a pale flame that covered the sky and burned down the surrounding space.

The young Chaos Beast stood magnificently in front of the fire. It had just been born recently, but it was growing at a really fast pace. It was ten meters tall at the beginning, while it was almost twenty meters tall at the moment.

The collapsed space took a long time to heal. It was swallowing energy like a black hole.

Su Ping saw that the chaos energy covering the young beast was almost gone; it could no longer cover its body completely.

It did not know that move in the past. Could it be…

Su Ping looked at the Chaos Perception Dragon in front of the young Chaos Beast. While he pondered, he saw that the young pet opened its mouth and absorbed another pale fire from the void. Then, the collapsed space began to heal.

The young Chaos Beast then roared at the Chaos Perception Dragon. It was no longer scared, as it seemed to be actually bragging.

Su Ping was dumbfounded by such an outcome.

He quickly checked the time on his watch.

Every time he entered a cultivation site, he would keep a record of his stay with the watch, all to avoid any confusions about time spent after a meditation session.

Many Ascendants would prepare a special hourglass in their small world to keep the time.

Years and months were often too short for them. They often counted time by a thousand or even ten thousand year increments.

“Sixty-seven days?”

Su Ping was quite stunned after checking the watch; his heart raced.?That was close. He probably would’ve continued his meditation if he hadn’t been woken up by the unusual technique the young Chaos Beast released.

He thought it had only been a day or two, when in fact more than two months had passed.

He would have missed the trials if he hadn’t stopped meditating.

“It seems impossible to adjust the flow of time in the Source World. I have to monitor my stay more closely in the future,” Su Ping said to himself.

He looked at the young Chaos Beast, which had apparently gotten much closer to the Chaos Perception Dragon; it had surely learned that last move from that powerful creature.

Su Ping looked at the Chaos Perception Dragon with fear. It was ingrained in his blood, just like how people were afraid of spiders and snakes, and would be too scared to approach them even if they were fully armed.

He took a deep breath, then held back his fear and gradually approached the Chaos Perception Dragon. He said telepathically, “Well… Senior? We have to leave.”

Su Ping did find it strange to address an ancient ferocious beast as “senior.”

But he wasn’t a person who would judge others by their appearance. After all, the creature had taught the young Chaos Beast and helped him on the side; Su Ping owed it a favor.

The Chaos Perception Dragon rolled its eye and glanced at Su Ping. However, it narrowed its eye when Su Ping said the word “leave,” dissatisfied.

The dragon took a sniff and suddenly snorted; the temperature rose quickly. Su Ping felt that his body was about to melt, and his mind was dizzy due to the blast. The pain was excruciating.

Still, Su Ping gritted his teeth and withstood it all. He saw that the Chaos Perception Dragon raised its claw and placed it between him and the young Chaos Beast, as if determined to keep it.

Su Ping changed his expression. There was no way he would give away the young Chaos Beast.

That creature was the young Chaos Beast’s teacher, but Su Ping couldn’t leave it there. After all, the young one couldn’t resurrect without him present.

“Senior, if you like, I can bring it with me next time,” said Su Ping in a low voice, as he tried to endure the persisting headache.

The Chaos Perception Dragon’s eyes were cold. Scorching air burst out its nostrils and turned into fog in the sky. Exactly at this moment, the young Chaos Beast roared and dashed towards Su Ping.

It quickly ran and stood in front of him. Then, it suddenly jumped around and glared at the massive dragon.

The latter was clearly stunned, obviously not expecting that the young one would protect a human fearlessly. They had become quite close in the past two months.

It grimly stared at the young Chaos Beast and Su Ping.

The young Chaos Beast grimaced, but glared back as it hadn’t given in. It was much less frightened than in their first encounter, but its limbs were still shivering.

They were caught in an impasse.

While looking at the young Chaos Beast’s majestic back, Su Ping took a deep breath and said to the Chaos Perception Dragon, “Senior, we will surely come again when we get a chance. Can you tell us how we can find you?”
