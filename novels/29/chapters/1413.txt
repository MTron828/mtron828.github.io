Chapter 1414 Invincible Power (1)

Everybody knew that Lin Tianzhan, the prior head of the Rain Clan, was an extremely ruthless figure. In his time he rallied his clansmen to destroy a hundred races; he had killed too many people.

Furthermore, he had also beheaded many emperor-level beasts and made glorious achievements, leading the Rain Clan to new heights!

He later asked another emperor to take his position once he was past his prime. However, he had left a deep impression on the rest of the clans in the world of gods.

Yan Qing saw a hunched old man approaching in the void. He had yet to reveal any killing intent, but he carried a sharpness that could freeze the world.

His hunched back gradually straightened as he got closer, his old and decayed face becoming young again, transitioning from old to middle-aged, and then to the Spring of youth.

Flames enveloped his body, burning his gray robe and condensing a scary divine armor.

A divine spear was then manifested in his hand. Once he wielded that weapon, the god who looked like a dying old man a short while before was restored to the God of War who fought relentlessly in the world of gods.

“You’re not entirely ignorant if you’ve heard of me. Are you… from the Heaven Path Institute?” Lin Tianzhan observed details on Yan Qing and the other people’s clothing and recognized their faction; the coldness in his eyes changed somewhat. Although he had long resigned, their institute had enjoyed a special status for a long time.

But why is the Heaven Path Institute causing trouble in the Rain Clan?

“Emperor Heaven Destroyer, those are the elders of the Heavenly Path Institute, and that’s their Dao Child who has killed a prince, a God King, Emperor Lie and Emperor Que from our clan. He did all of this while merely being a God King, which is terrifying. He must be killed!” reported the Rain Clan Emperor telepathically. Lin Tianzhan’s title was Emperor Heaven Destroyer, because he had boldly claimed that he could even fight the Heavenly Dao, and people used this to derive his title and sang it everywhere.

“A God King…”

Lin Tianzhan narrowed his eyes and focused his attention on Su Ping. Indeed, the aura of that young man was that of a God King.

Such a level, and he actually killed Emperor Que and Emperor Lie?

Moreso, he had seen the Netherworld Scroll. Instantly, he saw pictures and answers in his head.

He didn’t bother asking his clansmen why they made an enemy out of such a genius.

It was evident to him that the Rain Emperor wasn’t an idiot; they wouldn’t have done such a stupid act if not for special circumstances.

So, it all came down to the situation forcing them to become enemies.

Being the case, he had to be eliminated.

“You’ve summoned all of us just to take care of this junior?”

Another senior emperor stepped up. He was like a ghost that nobody could detect. He added with a hollow voice, “Do you need all of us to take action?”

The Rain Emperor was highly attentive before his senior and noticed the latter’s dissatisfaction in his voice. That emperor was as old as the Rain Ancestor and his strength was on par with Lin Tianzhan. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“This is a special situation. He’s very strong; I hope that you won’t underestimate him. Let’s just execute him as soon as possible!” said the Rain Emperor.

He certainly knew he was making a fuss by summoning all of those old fellows. However, Su Ping’s performance was so shocking; it would be impossible to suppress him without their help.

“Fine. Never mind. Since we’re already out, let’s just get this over with,” said a gorgeous emperor who had a sexy body figure and a beautiful face; the sword she was carrying was even bigger than her. She then drew the sword and placed it in front of her ample bosom; a terrifying sword aura began to spread like ripples.

“Die!”

Some emperors simply stepped up and charged at Su Ping without making any preparations.

“Is the Rain Clan really going to fight so unfairly?” Yan Qing was anxious and angry, hoping to postpone their attacks with words. However, it was obvious that all those emperors had been through too many dangerous battles, and wouldn’t be delayed by a few words. Some of them only glanced at Yan Qing with disdain before they charged at Su Ping straight away.

“Junior, it’s your honor to die in our hands!” said an emperor casually, before throwing a sudden fist attack. The might of his move descended like a towering mountain.

Su Ping’s gray hair was fluttering. He raised his head, and his cold smile looked rather unruly. “You’re just a bunch of untalented old farts who are about to die!”

He actually dared to call them untalented; all those famous, ancient emperors. That made Lin Tianzhan and the others slightly change their expressions. Such badmouthing angered them to no end.

Yan Qing and the other elders were also shocked. Su Ping’s words were becoming increasingly arrogant. Even they were scared.

Boom. Su Ping broke the golden fist with one punch, and his smile became even colder as he felt the power of the guy’s universe. He discovered that those emperors were indeed much stronger than the previous four, but they were still too distant from the Ancestral God’s level, and worlds apart from the level that Su Ping had seen through the Golden Crow ancestor’s eyes.

Su Ping suddenly roared, “Break now!”

His sword aura surged forth and completely shattered the bloody inferno. Power was constantly flowing out of his body. The power absorbed from the Ancestral God corpse had been too much for him to bear and was stored as an energy core in his body. Now the energy was being constantly released as he fought. The flow of such power was polishing Su Ping’s body while it was being used.
