He turned his neck and said, “Sorry, my neck is uncomfortable. I don’t like to look up at someone for too long. I only met the Hun Yu Clan on my way and asked them for a ride. I thought we could establish an alliance with you and figure out how to deal with the Heavens. It never occurred to me that my friends would infuriate you.”

The two dragons were unhappy. However, they held back and said calmly, “Now that you know, it’s time to give them away. We’ll make them understand that the authority among dragons cannot be provoked!”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “Sorry, you didn’t let me finish… What I mean is, I didn’t know that my friends would infuriate you, but I’m very satisfied with their performance, because they were capable of resisting your intimidation, even though they’re only in the Dao Heart State. I wonder if it’s because you’re too weak or they’re too strong. Anyway, I’m proud of them!”

“You!”

The two dragons flew into a rage. What Su Ping said was a blatant provocation!

The Inferno Dragon and the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon were both shivering, gritting their teeth and growling. Both were on the verge of tears when Su Ping said that he was proud of them.

“Do you want the Primitive Chaos Clan to be completely destroyed?” One of the dragons moved and emitted a suppressive aura to cover Su Ping. It looked down at Su Ping with a body almost as massive as a planet, just like staring at a grain of dust in the universe.

“Unfortunately, you can’t do that.” Su Ping looked back with a smile. “I believe my friends will easily defeat you when they reach your level.”

“How dare you!”

“Outrageous!”

Both dragons were infuriated; Su Ping was more arrogant than they thought. That was the Original Dragons territory, which was protected by a Sorcerer Ancestor. Even the Primitive Chaos Clan’s Sorcerer Ancestor would have to tread with care if he were there!

And yet, Su Ping was bold enough to make such a declaration in their territory!

“Catch him!”

“Send his subordinates to the Dragon Prison!”

The two dragons roared and charged at Su Ping and his pets.

The colorful bird and the rest of the Hun Yu Clan were shocked. Their heads were already exploding when they saw Su Ping’s reactions. They were on someone else’s territory!

They wanted to put a stop to this, but their telepathic voices were disrupted when entering the dragons’ heads. The latter asked them to stay out of it.

Meanwhile, Su Ping also told the colorful bird and the other Ancestral Gods to stay clear of the matter. He didn’t want to implicate them.

Boom!

A battle burst out. Su Ping fought one of the dragons.

He tried to connect to the power in the void; however, he couldn’t find an anchor for his contract, and could only fight with his undying fire universe.

The chaos dragon, being an Undying State expert, had practiced ultimate Dao techniques and had the best bloodline. Su Ping felt pressured from the beginning and had to fall back.

He was but mediocre among Ancestral Gods, since he couldn’t draw support with his Contract Dao Heart; the fire universe was his only resource, whereas his opponent was one of the best. The difference was soon made evident.

However, Su Ping had the Primitive Chaos Clan constitution; it would be hard for his opponent to kill him quickly.

The colorful bird and the other Ancestral Gods looked awful as they witnessed the fight. They would have stepped in if Su Ping hadn’t told them to stay put via telepathically. Sure, their relationship with the Original Dragons would have been affected, but they could always patch it up when the Sorcerer Ancestor returned. They couldn’t simply watch Su Ping—someone who had risked his life helping them—endure such a dangerous situation without doing anything. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This won’t do. The strength gap is too far apart!”

The colorful bird was troubled. Su Ping was no match for the chaos dragon, at all. Furthermore, she discovered that something was off. Su Ping had never used the universe of original chaos, which was the core element of the Primitive Chaos Clan!

Instead, he was using a rather subpar fire universe.

She suspected that the latter was hiding his strength and preparing for an eruption, but the ongoing situation made her think otherwise.

“What’s going on? Isn’t he a member of the Primitive Chaos Clan? Why isn’t he using the universe of original chaos? That way their power difference wouldn’t be as great, even if he doesn’t win in the end. He might even become stronger if it’s coupled with his fire universe!” said another Hun Yu Ancestral God, who was just as anxious and puzzled.

Su Ping’s body had been torn apart hundreds of times by then. He was almost cornered, but he never used the universe of original chaos.

It never occurred to them that Su Ping didn’t become an Ancestral God with the universe of original chaos.

“You’re no match for me. Stop!”

The massive dragon released his universe of chaos all of a sudden. The scary universe slithered quickly, entangling and imprisoning Su Ping.

The creature stared at Su Ping and said, “If you weren’t the last survivor, I would have asked your clan for an ultimate treasure as ransom. Humph! I’ll give you a chance to avenge your clansmen on the battlefield after we reach an agreement with the Hun Yu Clan to fight the Heavens!”

“Is that so?”

Coldness emanated from Su Ping’s eyes. A terrifying amount of power erupted from his body, blowing up his opponent’s universe. He punched, making a giant hole on the dragon’s chest, ripping its body apart.

The unexpected turn of events shocked all the Hun Yun clansmen who were about to take action. They all looked at Su Ping in disbelief.

Their first thought was that Su Ping had found an opportunity to attack!

However, they noticed that the fire universe was still behind his back, not the universe of original chaos!

“What is going on? Why did he suddenly become so strong?”

The colorful bird was dumbfounded. She found that she could not see through Su Ping.

In the void—the chaos dragon’s body was quickly reconstituted. It looked at Su Ping with shock and suspicion. Moments before, the power that erupted from the young fellow made it feel insignificant and defenseless.

Was it my imagination?

The Original Dragons were the fiercest and most brutal of the Sorcerer Ancestors’ clans, with stronger physiques in comparison to those of the Primitive Chaos Clan.

Su Ping turned around and looked at the other dragon. “Release my friends!”

The latter had already suppressed the Inferno Dragon and the others, and kept them in its own universe of chaos.

The pets were completely helpless before that top Undying State existence. After all, it could slay Ancestral Gods, and was even stronger than the Chaos Perception Dragon!

“Your friends will be punished in the Dragon Prison. You should thank us for not executing them directly!” The dragon looked at Su Ping coldly. “We’ll be happy to entertain if you keep on causing trouble. Don’t blame us for ending the Primitive Chaos Clan!”

Su Ping’s eyes were slightly cold, but he knew that continuing the fight was pointless.

He had moved the fight closer to one of the continents just then, which allowed him to summon its power and turn the tables.

Even if he had the strength to defeat the two dragons, more would come after defeating them. Even the Original Dragons’ ancestor could make an appearance.

“Release my friends and I’ll go,” said Su Ping.

“It’s impossible!” said the dragon coldly, “I’ve sent them to the Dragon Prison. This is the lightest penalty for their insubordination!”

Anger flashed in Su Ping’s eyes. He quickly searched through the pet bond and discovered that his partners were indeed somewhere distant and vague.

Obviously, his opponent had teleported them away through its universe.

“One day you will pay a price for your arrogance!” Su Ping clenched his fists and glared at them. He then flashed and tore an opening in the void to teleport.

The contract not only made it possible to summon pets, but to also to send oneself to where the pets were found, once a certain level was reached.

But, it was all on the premise that the pets would be “masters” for a moment, which required great trust. After all, the pets would be momentarily free from the contract during the process, and they could even control their masters with a thought.
