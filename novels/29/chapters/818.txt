Chapter 819: Domination

Boom!!

The blast was instantly spread in the small world, as if thousands of thunders were rumbling at the same time. The horrifying shock made the land crumble and the rivers go off course; a pit thousands of meters deep was left on the ground, just like a super pot.

A streak of golden light dashed out in the midst of those rumbling noises. It was none other than Su Ping.

He flew at the edge of the blast, and the bones and dragon scales on his skin kept falling apart and regenerating as it worked to block it.

The attack was beyond what the Star State could muster, easily able to kill any creature of the advanced Star State!

However, Su Ping managed to weather through it and was ready to counterattack, thanks to the bloodline abilities that the Little Skeleton had just perceived, the Inferno Dragon’s scales, and the God of Lightning’s Law!

His bone shield and dragon scales were destroyed again and again. His Solar Bulwark was glowing as it received the shock; the Golden Crow illusion behind his back seemed to be screaming.

If he were anyone else, he would’ve focused all his strength on defending himself.

However, Su Ping went all out and charged brutally.

Triple Hellish Saber!

Su Ping roared in his heart while he stared at the purple-robed young man on the other side with bloodshot eyes.

Golden runes were appearing around that young master.

Earlier on, the golden runes had blocked the Lightning Wave Saber. Just one of the golden runes had reduced its power by half!

The golden runes were flying out like cheap toilet paper at that moment, flashing around the purple-robed young man.

They were quickly torn apart by the blast, but there were so many in number that they formed a shield and protected the young man behind them.

Nobody expected Su Ping to keep attacking during the blast, which could have wiped him out easily if he wasn’t cautious. However, he managed to resist without using any secret treasures, and he was still attacking!

“Is he crazy?”

“He’s mad! He seems determined to kill that guy!”

“I have to say, it’s an excellent opportunity for offense as long as he endures that attack... But still, he’s too bold!”

“Look at the Fate State guy! Isn’t he too extravagant?”

“Damn it, he’s using such top defensive secret treasures like plain paper. Does his family own a paper factory?”

“He was surely born in a rich family. Him competing over the Tree of Laws with us is beyond unfair!”

Outside of the small world—all the cultivators in the Star State had complicated feelings. They were shocked by Su Ping’s madness, and jealous of the purple-robed young man’s lush display of wealth.

Right then, Su Ping was moving at the edge of the blast in a weird route. His Triple Hellish Saber was aimed at a weakness and reached the purple-robed young man instantly.

The latter, still behind the golden runes, had no time to detect what was going on outside, but he had a strong premonition and narrowed his eyes when the saber aura reached him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Then—through a gap in the flying runes—he saw that Su Ping was charging straight at him with brutality and resolve in his eyes!

This guy is a lunatic!

That was the purple-robed young man’s first response. He was shocked by Su Ping’s relentless way of fighting.

Is a Tree of Laws really worth it?

He was also angered by this; ever since childhood, he had always gotten everything he wanted!

A Tree of Laws wasn’t worth fighting with his life on the line, but he loathed failure!

“You think I’m a flower that grew up in a greenhouse? Just bring it on!” the purple-robed young man roared with blood surging in his eyes. He fully activated the Bloody Demon Immortality Technique and even ignited his constitution.

A bloody fire rose to the sky and surrounded his body. Bloody stripes appeared and entangled him, making his skin red and his hair flutter.

“I will suppress all lives with demonic blood!” the purple-robed young man roared. The almost-complete laws on his chains were burning fiercely. This time, he borrowed the laws of his pets.

However, due to the limits of his own cultivation, his pets didn’t understand the laws as well as he did.

Even though they were ultimate pets, they only had limited aptitudes after all.

Boom!!

A chain descended towards Su Ping from the sky like a sharp saber! It had a combination of multiple laws, ablaze in bloody light.

It happened too fast. The bloody chain was deviated and weakened by the blast when launched; it was very hard to control!

On the other hand, the laws and aura of Su Ping’s Triple Hellish Saber were quickly falling apart too; they also had trouble enduring the blast.

Nevertheless, the two attacks still collided, as both parties had tried their best to control them.

“Come again!

“Kill!” Su Ping roared. The vortices inside his cells revolved fast, unleashing furious astral power. He also made use of the blast’s astral power and absorbed it.

Not caring about the result, he launched the Triple Hellish Saber again and again!

Su Ping moved forward, cutting a path open with the saber auras, quickly approaching the purple-robed foe.

The purple-robed young man’s chain dispelled Su Ping’s saber aura and won in that collision, but he was shocked to see Su Ping’s new attacks. This guy has enough astral power to repeatedly throw such powerful attacks?

Is there an ocean of astral power inside his body?

The rich youngster gritted his teeth and controlled the chain again. It was evenly matched with the following saber auras, but was later flung back. The bloody light and the power of laws it had were gone, indicating that the secret treasure had been heavily damaged; it would have to be reforged and nurtured.

The purple-robed young man gazed at Su Ping with a hideous face, deep killing intent flashing in his eyes.

“Great! I’ll show you what melee skills are!”

He pocketed his chain and then put on a pair of claw-shaped gloves, also top secret treasures.

Melee skills were very important in the Federation; many battle pet warriors had learned them.

Astral power, merging techniques and melee skills could grant extraordinary strength when a warrior was able to grasp them!

Some of the smaller planets were too imbalanced. Some were focused on melee skills, some on merging techniques, and others—such as the Blue Planet—were devoted to astral power; very few warriors excelled in melee skills.

The blast was finally dispersed, only leaving some lingering effects.

The aftermath was so hot that it was able to melt rocks or vaporize a sea, just like the core of a planet would.

The air inside the small world was twisted by the high temperature.

The purple-robed young man resisted the heat with his techniques, but Su Ping simply strode towards him and ignored it with his body’s resistance to heat.

Even though the high temperature was also hurting him, the damages caused were automatically healed by the God of Lightning’s Law. He didn’t need to do anything.

Swoosh!

The young contender aimed his fist towards Su Ping’s face; it was fierce and fast, like a dagger.

While he punched, his body shook and became three clones that lunged at Su Ping at the same time, throwing countless punches.

Su Ping widened his eyes and divine light burst out. He suddenly turned around and kicked. Then, all the illusionary fists were gone, and the purple-robed young man was kicked thousands of meters back. A golden rune on his chest had blocked Su Ping’s kick for him, but its force had still left him in pain.

“How was that possible?”

The young man was shocked; nobody could have identified his true self that fast!

The people outside the small world were also shocked, not expecting Su Ping to be that good.

“The guy’s fist technique and clones were flawless, and still, he was seen through!”

“How did he find that guy’s true self? I felt like he attacked without even paying attention!”

“Oh my god, are they super geniuses in melee skills too?”

The Star State onlookers found it hard to believe.

Many people practiced melee skills, but they had other priorities. It was impossible for them to become adept at everything.

However, it didn’t seem to be a problem for the two contenders.

Was that what made them geniuses?

“Look, that man is still displaying a Void State level, which means that he’s not trying his best!”

“F*ck. That’s true!”

“What a horrifying monster!”

“We’re both in the Star State, but why is our gap so huge? I feel like killing myself!”

“Stop talking about the Star State. His Fate State opponent is already awesome enough. He has to save the dignity of the Star State for us!”

Inside the small world—

After Su Ping kicked the purple-robed young man away, bone spikes grew all over his body and on his hands. He strode over with divine light. He approached his target, then suddenly used a super acceleration, with strength and speed enhancements!

Boom!

He became significantly faster and punched his opponent in the face.

The young man’s pupils shrunk. He raised his hand, as he tried to block the punch. In the meantime, the A’ye Demonic Snake on his back moved and opened its mouth to attack.

Su Ping, however, made a flash move to the side, before he punched the A’ye Demonic Snake’s head!

The beast obviously didn’t see it coming, that the human would foresee its attack and even retaliate!

There was a boom, then the bone spikes on Su Ping’s fist penetrated the A’ye Demonic Snake’s scales; the beast could only scream.

The purple-robed young man was even more enraged. He felt that his moves were being easily read.

He tried to recall the A’ye Demonic Snake, but Su Ping suddenly seized it and opened his mouth, launching a shocking roar.

Obviously, the purple-robed young man didn’t expect that Su Ping was capable of performing sonic techniques. His head was dizzy for a moment.

A secret treasure in his head removed the dizziness moments after, restoring his rationality.

Su Ping had already punched the A’ye Demonic Snake multiple times during that brief pause, making it bleed profusely.

The young man was incensed as he fought back, while Su Ping easily dodged his attacks, thanks to the super acceleration.

It was definitely a marvelous skill for melee battles!

Besides, Su Ping had tons of fighting experience in the cultivation sites. Only the ancient Gods of Rules such as Joanna could best him in terms of combat.

“Is this what you’re confident of? How childish!”

With disdain in his eyes, Su Ping punched the purple-robed young man multiple times with overwhelming strength. A golden rune flew out and blocked each of the punches to protect him.

The young man was shocked and infuriated; he was unhurt thanks to the golden runes, but it was still humiliating!

He had been crushed in terms of melee skills!

All his attacks had been seen through. It didn’t make any sense!

“Don’t be too cocky! I’ll slay you like a chicken when I break through to the Star State!”

The purple-robed young man was flung hundreds of meters back by Su Ping’s punch, and he looked awful.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Let’s see if you’re capable of advancing your cultivation!”

Considering the purple-robed young man’s abilities, Su Ping could ascertain that he wouldn’t have been a match if his opponent was indeed in the Star State.

However, Su Ping was also growing!

That was why he wanted the Tree of Laws so desperately!

The purple-robed young man was so angry that he stopped talking and took out his chain again. Having been crushed by Su Ping in the melee battle, he would rather use it until the end.

He had almost run out of his golden runes. He would have to reveal his trump card if they were used up.

But if he exposed that trump card, someone might covet it and try to kill him to get it!

Su Ping simply swung his bone saber and counterattacked after seeing the chain.

He had a profound amount of astral power. The star vortices inside his hells had been absorbing the wandering power in the air. The melee battle a moment earlier didn’t consume too much energy; it was actually an opportunity for him to replenish his reserves.

The Little Skeleton had also been helping him absorb the power of the undead from the void, then transform it into astral power.

The chain and the saber collided again.

Another fierce bout took place inside the small world, but this time, neither did Su Ping nor the purple-robed young man display other techniques. They simply launched their most powerful attacks again and again.

Both of them wanted to defeat the other, but they were evenly matched. It would be hard to make the kill with one attack.

This was a time when energy storage was the most important, since the most powerful attacks were being launched continuously.

The people outside the small world were shocked to see such a long lasting battle. They felt that the battle wouldn’t end until one party ran out energy!

However, both men seemed to be monsters with inexhaustible reserves!

Any Star State expert would have been exhausted by then.

“You think you have more energy than I do?”

With disdain in his eyes, the purple-robed young man took out a divine fruit and swallowed it. Soon after, the fruit nurtured his dried internal system like an elixir and filled him with astral power again.

Su Ping was slightly gloomy after seeing this, but simply kept silent and attacked again and again.

Five minutes later.

The purple-robed young man ran out of astral power again. He grimly took out a second divine fruit.

Nine minutes later, he looked awful as he took out a third divine fruit.
