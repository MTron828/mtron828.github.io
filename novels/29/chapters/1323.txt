Chapter 1324 The Golden Crows’ Ancestor (1)

“Blood from our ancestor?”

Nearby-Diqiong lost her cool and said in bewilderment, “Chief Elder, you’re giving him a drop of the ancestor’s blood? Not even the strongest warriors of our clan have ever received such a gift. Worse, he’s not even a member of our clan; can he absorb it?”

The Chief Elder said calmly, “Special times call for special measures. This young human friend is not from our kind, but I do hope this generous act can break some sort of boundary. He’s a human, but his bloodline has been transformed into that of the Primitive Chaos Clan. He can absorb any bloodline now; however, how much he can absorb will depend on his determination.”

Diqiong felt dazed for a moment. She looked at Su Ping with a troubled expression, not saying anything else.

She wasn’t jealous of him; rather, she regarded Su Ping as a friend. She was also willing to act in a similar fashion if she could truly give something good to Su Ping and break a certain restraint.

“The Heavens have reappeared, and a catastrophe is underway. You must seize the opportunity,” Diqiong said to Su Ping.

The latter was certain that she was misunderstanding something. He acquired the fire from the gods; even if the Heavens did reappear, they would only end up in the Archean Divinity and wouldn’t be a threat to him.

In any case, judging by their reaction, it was necessary for him to return to the Archean Divinity and learn about the background of the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire. Considering Elder Chan’s information, the Heavenly Fire seemed to be a local specialty of the Red Dome Realm, which had existed for a long time. He had to find out more about the subject.

“I will always remember the favor granted by the Golden Crows!” Su Ping cupped his hands before the Chief Elder, choosing not to courteously refuse. Judging by Diqiong’s reaction, the ancestor’s blood had to be extremely precious.

He did need power to protect himself and those around him.

The Chief Elder nodded. Su Ping had clearly considered his favor to be a favor done by all their species, which made him feel that he had made the right decision. It wasn’t his personal investment, but that of the Golden Crows as a whole. If the Heavens did show up, the Golden Crows would be found, even if they were in hiding.

If that were to happen, it was better to make a single front with their allies and fight back!

“This is the Original Divine Fire Technique!”

......

The Golden Crow unleashed a magnificent aura of chaos that enshrouded Su Ping. A distant and vague thought drifted into Su Ping’s head, along with an infinite amount of information.

Su Ping felt that the universe around him suddenly disappeared, and he was floating in chaos. Both the Chief Elder and Diqiong vanished; many Dao Glyphs flew around him, forming an ancient sutra.

He noticed as those Dao Glyphs flew around his body as if they were alive.? They contained arcane riddles that would have puzzled him in the past; however, his universe of chaos helped him comprehend those glyphs much faster.

He used to be like an apprentice who had to cut trees down from the bottom of a hill to the very top. Now he was able to see through the mysteries of some Dao Glyphs and crack them quickly.

Su Ping was soon able to calm down.

He locked onto a series of Dao Glyphs and narrowed his eyes to study them.

Time flew.

Su Ping sat cross-legged in that isolated time and space within chaos, without feeling the passage of time; he was completely devoted to the Dao Glyphs around him.

Maybe one year, maybe a hundred years, or maybe ten thousand years…

One day, all the Dao Glyphs were parsed and interconnected. The resulting phenomenon was obvious.

“This is the path of origin…”

Su Ping was in a trance. He had thought that such a fire-controlling technique was a unique ancient skill; he didn’t expect it to be an original path.

“Everything has a beginning and an end. This is the path to start…

“There’s the start of fire, water, wind and void. All of them can be controlled with this

path…”

The longer he studied it, the clearer it was to see how powerful the technique imparted by the Chief Elder was. There had to be secret techniques to control wind and void too; they had the same foundation.

Su Ping opened his hand and a flame emerged. It was the fire made of his perfect path of fire, which gradually transformed into a crimson dagger.

Whoosh!

Su Ping threw the crimson dagger, and immediately detonated part of the nearby space. A fire was spread out and then was suddenly compressed, consuming and swallowing everything in the vicinity.

Su Ping’s eyes were glittering as he sensed the terrifying destruction.

The fire itself would have been as destructive as the attack of a normal Celestial

However, adding the control brought by the Original Divine Fire Technique, it was as powerful as a peak Celestial strike.

Su Ping believed that such a casually thrown attack was unstoppable for most Celestials. It could have crushed more than half of the God Kings in the Archean Divinity.

That was only the fire I just condensed. If I used Heavenly Fire… Su Ping’s eyes glittered with excitement.

Exactly at that moment-time and space dispersed before his eyes, and the previous boundless universe was revealed. Su Ping floated in that universe and met Diqiong and the Chief Elder again.

“Looks like you grasped it.” The Chief Elder looked at Su Ping with solemn and affectionate eyes.

Su Ping’s talent was even higher than expected, having grasped the Original Divine Fire Technique that quickly. He was even as remarkable as Diqiong, who carried the ancestor’s bloodline.

Diqiong was naturally intimate with the path of fire thanks to her bloodline; cultivation was as simple as eating and drinking for her. Although Su Ping also carried the Golden Crow’s bloodline, it was thin and ordinary, nothing when compared to Diqiong’s.
