Chapter 1309 Dao Child (2)

A long while later.

Once the sword auras were gone, everybody found that Chen Xi was nowhere to be seen. There were only pieces of flesh scattered across the void, trying to reassemble.

Su Ping watched in silence but didn’t stop. After Chen Xi’s flesh was reconstituted, Su Ping finally asked, “Do you want to keep fighting?”

Chen Xi wore an awful expression. Su Ping’s words pierced deep into his heart like sharp needles. He felt humiliated, but the dread in his heart made him realize he would lose, even if he kept fighting.

His rationality tried to figure out why Su Ping had planted such an intense fear in his heart

–

Still, he couldn’t find any clues, which made him feel frustrated.

After a long silence, Chen Xi slowly opened his mouth. “I lost.”

The audience was shocked by that answer.

Although they could tell that something was wrong with Chen Xi, they didn’t expect him to admit defeat.

Many of them didn’t even understand the battle. They thought that Chen Xi could still fight it out!

After all, he was still alive. Although losing at the moment, there was still a chance to turn the tables.

However, he admitted defeat.

Did the two of them already fight in their peak status?

The mentors mingling in the audience frowned, noticing the strangeness of the situation. Chen Xi was obviously scared of Su Ping; he had also knelt before the human after suddenly disappearing. No one knew what happened; not even the mentors could understand. Still, Su Ping came out triumphant after the clash when the Dao Child disappeared.

The sword in Su Ping’s hand was gone. The moment he admitted defeat, Su Ping dispelled his fighting mode and his body recovered its human form. “That mind invasion was quite dangerous, but I like it. Can you teach me later?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Dazed for a moment, Chen Xi looked at Su Ping with a conflicted expression. “I seem to have lost some memories. It’s because of you, right?”

“More or less.” Su Ping didn’t give a definitive answer. The system was part of him.

“Figures…” Chen Xi heaved a sigh and accepted the result. The ultimate skill he had just developed was rendered useless by Su Ping; failure was understandable.

His speed-enhanced by his small universewas not enough to beat the human who fought with his battle instincts.

His two best methods were useless. He was doomed to lose the fight.

“I heard that you cut Qing Mu’s chaos world tree. Can you teach me that move?” said Chen Xi.

Su Ping smiled. “All right.”

Chen Xi was stunned; Su Ping’s willingness to share came too easily. He suddenly found that human being less annoying. He asked, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll pick it up?”

“I’d worry if you can’t pick it up,” Su Ping smiled and said, “All skills should be taught; it’s boring if they die with you.”

Chen Xi glanced at him with a strange expression. He didn’t believe that Su Ping was a fool, who didn’t understand the importance of keeping special skills to oneself. Still, it was clear to see that the latter had a special kind of confidence, and an open attitude.

He suddenly grew curious about humans as a race; he had never paid them attention in the past. Are all humans like this person?

“I robbed you of your Dao Child identity. You won’t blame me, would you?” asked Su Ping.

Chen Xi slightly shook his head. “I failed because I’m weaker; I have nothing to say. I will earn back the identity I lost today. The Heaven Path Institute doesn’t need garbage hogging the titles.”

“That’s good.” Su Ping nodded.

Although he wouldn’t mind, even if the man hated and retaliated against him, he would rather not make more enemies for humankind, not after provoking the Rain Clan. After all, Chen Xi was from one of the seven greatest clans, which were even more powerful than the Rain Clan.

The reason being—they had more than one Ancestral God!

For that very reason the other high-ranked clans had to think carefully if they were to confront the seven greatest clans. They could be wiped out if they truly started war!

“The Dao Child challenge is over,” said the child-like elder; his voice echoed throughout the Oceanic Universe of Clouds. “I hereby announce that Su Ping will be the new Dao Child of this institute from today onwards, and he will enjoy the pertinent privileges. Those who disagree may issue a Dao Child challenge!”

Everyone was sobered up after hearing what the elder said, as they were still shocked by Chen Xi’s failure. Many cheered and felt excited for Su Ping.

After all, of the three Dao Children, Su Ping was the only one who was from a middle-ranked clan!

He wasn’t the first Dao Child from a middle-ranked clan, but he was definitely one of the few!

Nobody had enjoyed such honor for tens of thousands of years.

Many students from middle-ranked clans were excited by this. He didn’t just represent humanity, but also the other middle-ranked races!

“Congratulations!”

Chan Gong approached Su Ping with a smile.

The latter felt grateful as he noticed the delight in the elder’s eyes. He quickly said, “Thank you for your help, Chan Gong.”

“You have yourself to thank.” Chan Gong smiled.

The coldness on Yan Huang’s face faded somewhat. She said calmly, “Feel free to come to me for help. I’m good at attacking; I can tell that your battle style is similar to mine. Come to me later and I’ll help you improve.”

“Thank you, elder.” Su Ping cupped his hands gratefully.

“Not bad, not bad. You are a big surprise. This is history in the making; I hope you’ll keep it up,” said another old man with a smile.

“I’m good at refining items. Kid, come find me if you’re interested in such matters,” said a middle-aged man who was rather brawny. His voice sounded quite mature.

Su Ping nodded quickly.

All the elders left after talking to him, leaving Chan Gong and the big-headed child.

“Since you’re so close, why don’t you tell him about the Dao Child title?” said the big-headed child to Chan Gong.

Chan Gong smiled. “All right.”

He was about to take Su Ping back to the Toad Fish Palace.

Su Ping turned around and said to Chen Xi. “We’ll talk later.”

“Okay.”

Chen Xi nodded peacefully.

Chan Gong looked at him in surprise, not expecting the guy to be so relaxed after his defeat and losing the title.

He didn’t ask further, and simply led Su Ping away.

All eyes followed as the pair disappeared from the Oceanic Universe of Clouds.

Chen Xi cupped his hands at the big-headed child and then also disappeared.

“I didn’t expect that Chen Xi would lose…”

Qing Mu was quite shaken. He was once defeated by Chen Xi, and knew how terrifying the man was.

“I think they had yet to go all out; Chen Xi admitting failure was unexpected,” said one of the candidates with a frown.

“Chen Xi surely used his strongest method and was still unable to beat him, so he had to admit defeat. He wouldn’t have done that if he thought he could win,” someone speculated.

“Humph. To think that a prince from one of the seven greatest families was defeated by a mere human. How humiliating!” Zhan Wushuang felt gloomy, not expecting Chen Xi to fail. Such a figure should have been much stronger, and yet he lost.

Now that Su Ping became a Dao Child, even the Rain Clan would find it difficult to touch him.

After all, the Heaven Path Institute was not to be messed with; not even the seven greatest clans would dare attack the Heaven Path Institute easily.

“Didn’t you lose to him too? Looks like the Rain Clan will have to cancel the hunting order now.” Someone looked at Zhan Wushuang with teasing eyes.

Zhan Wushuang glared back at him. “I beg your pardon?”

“Is there something wrong with your ears? Is that why you want me to repeat?”

“Do you want to be beaten up?”.

“Can you satisfy me?”

After hearing their dispute, Qing Mu shook his head and said, “Time to disperse. Go fight somewhere else; don’t make a fuss in the elder’s universe. This is a special place for the Dao Child competition.”

He gradually faded as he spoke, then left the place.

As if on cue, the rest left, one after the other. Nobody was interested in the dispute.
