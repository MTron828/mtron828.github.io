Chapter 324 The Showdown

At the staging areaSu Lingyue sensed the look Qin Shaotian had cast her way. She knew that the most difficult time was at hand.

She took a deep breath.

She tried to calm herself down and focus her mind.

She remembered what Su Ping had told her: Keep absolute calmness on the stage at all times!

The other way to interpret his words was: Do not panic. Stay calm and we will win!

She stood up.

At this moment, everyone shifted their gazes from Qin Shaotian to her.

The audience and the other participants in the staging area were all focusing their attention on the two.

Everyone was aware that this would be the main showdown in Group D.

Both of the participants had demonstrated strong abilities; terrifying even. If they had been in different groups, they would have won first place in their respective groups. And yet, since they were in the same group, only one of them could win!

Su Yanying looked at the girl and said encouraging words, “Su Lingyue, good luck.” Su Yanying could feel that Su Lingyue was standing under the spotlight. She could feel the pressure even by merely sitting next to her. Luo Fengtian wore a serious look and kept his voice low. “Good luck!” Yu Weihan bit her teeth to make up her mind before she said to Su Lingyue, “You defeated me easily. Don’t lose to anyone else!”

Ye Hao—who had been sitting somewhere else sulking over his argument with Luo Fengtian —came over. “Good luck to you,” he said to Su Lingyue.

Xu Kuang also walked over from the area where the students of the Ares Academy were sitting. “I wish you the best of luck!”

Touched by those words of encouragement, Su Lingyue bit her lips and clenched her fists. “I will win. I will!”

The second “I will” seemed to have been squeezed out of her teeth. Having said so, she turned around to where the family members were sitting

There, he was gazing at her with his crystal-clear eyes. He was smiling and giving her an encouraging look. All of a sudden, he winked at her in a playful way.

The clouds of worry over her mind were suddenly dispersed. She could understand what he was telling her with his eyes. He was asking her to go for it! She smiled at him and turned around. After she said goodbye to Su Yanying and the others, Su Lingyue left the staging area.

Amid all the intent eyes, she stepped onto the stage.

Once she was there, the volume of the cheering increased yet again. Everyone in the venue was excited about the upcoming battle. The other participants in the staging area held their breaths and waited.

That battle would be as important as a match among the last ten!

Unaffected by the audiences’ emotions, Su Lingyue went to her area confidently and without haste.

The judge had yet to announce the beginning of the match. She summoned the Moonfrost Dragon as soon as she stepped behind the red line. At the same time, she summoned the Phantom Flame Beast and had it stay close to her.

The fact that she would summon her pets so quickly made people think that she was nervous and under much pressure.

Differently from before, she had summoned a second pet. Many people had seen the Phantom Flame Beast before and they understood why she had done so. But those who had never seen her Phantom Flame Beast were definitely curious. Compared to the Moonfrost Dragon, the Phantom Flame Beast was not strong enough. In this critical battle, she should have summoned a pet stronger than the Moonfrost Dragon if she were to summon a second one.

So, the Moonfrost Dragon should be her strongest pet, right?

Many people had the same thought. Although disappointed, they found it understandable. After all, the Moonfrost Dragon was strong enough!

It was a dragon that seemed to have just reached adulthood but was already able to use ninth-rank skills and mobilize rich energy. The dragon was qualified to be her major pet!

The audience was eager to see what pets Qin Shaotian would summon.

Su Lingyue’s performance was much better than the two people that Qin Shaotian had defeated. It should be about time for him to use his major pet.

“I heard that someone promised you were going to win first place. You’re not telling me that the dragon is your strongest pet, are you?” Qin Shaotian asked Su Lingyue after he checked the mutated dragon with both golden and silver scales. Su Lingyue was surprised that he would say anything to her. “You got a problem with that?” She frowned.

This rude language took Qin Shaotian by surprise. In his entire life, no one had ever slighted him. After a momentary daze, he chuckled. “No, I don’t have a problem with that. If so, let me see the true power of your dragon!”

Su Lingyue wore a concerned look. The fact that he could tell the dragon was hiding some skills was unexpected.

Of course, that was nothing strange since the Moonfrost Dragon had been able to defeat her opponents within one move.

“Sure.”

She meant to let her dragon demonstrate its full power as well. Qin Shaotian was a formidable opponent. She had to ask the Moonfrost Dragon to do its utmost!

Since they were both ready, the judge announced the beginning of the match.

“Go.”

Su Lingyue passed her instruction to the Moonfrost Dragon, “Do everything you can to defeat... or even kill him!”

The Moonfrost Dragon first lowered its head to Su Lingyue after it received the order. The dragon saw how determined she was from the look in her eyes. The dragon understood.

Whirr

The Moonfrost Dragon opened its mouth slightly and a gust of chilly air oozed out.

Besides the chilly air, there was something else.

The entire atmosphere on the stage changed suddenly.

Qin Shaotian was about to take action when he noticed the oddness. He stopped what he was doing and looked.

The judge felt something strange as well. Surprised, he cast a look at the dragon. He realized that his heart was racing and he couldn’t control it!

Why?!

Astonishment appeared in the judge’s eyes.

Phew!

A heavy and cold air began to spread out from the Moonfrost Dragon. The stage under its feet froze and the ice kept on creeping out to almost cover the entire stage.

At the same time, a fortress of ice was formed with Su Lingyue and the Phantom Flame Beast at the center!

The fortress of ice was not built with the usual Ice Guardian skill. There, in front of the ice fortress, there seemed to be a man sitting down, wearing armor and holding a sharp spear!

That was...

The ninth-rank skill, Ice Goddess!

The very best defense skill with ice!

Everyone was in mute amazement; A ninth-rank defense skill?

That was to say, before he could defeat the dragon, Qin Shaotian wouldn’t have a chance to hurt its master!

Besides, if the Moonfrost Dragon were to build itself a fortress, would Qin Shaotian be able to break down the ice?

Qin Shaotian stared at the dragon with his mouth agape as the dragon unleashed the skill. But soon, he put himself together and wore a more serious look.

Whoosh!

Qin Shaotian lifted his hand. Another swirl opened up. He was about to summon another battle pet!

Everyone watched with great expectation. Up until then, this was the first time that Qin Shaotian had ever summoned a pet besides the Wind Siren!

Hot flames surged out from the pitch-dark swirl as if lava were spilling out. The next thing people saw was a hideous dragon head! That was... the Lava Dragon!

The ninth rarest dragon of all!!

People were struck dumb with astonishment. Qin Shaotian had summoned a rare dragon!

The Lava Dragon was at a rank lower than the Moonfrost Dragon but that would not make a difference. It would all depend on which dragon was more powerful.

The Lava Dragon was famous for its violence and cruelty. The Lava Dragon would dare to attack a dragon of higher rank. Only the three most powerful kinds of dragons could intimidate the Lava Dragon a bit.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
