Chapter 531 Fighting Violence with Violence

The furious purple dragons had surrounded Su Ping while the other dragons continued their discussion.

Roar!

The purple-blood dragons that were standing the closest to Su Ping rushed toward him, approaching him with tremendous force.

Su Ping frowned. He lifted his fist at once, pouring astral powers into his arm. The Fist of Exorcist surged with a golden glow.

Boom!!

Space was pushed into layers. A dark gray space appeared along with a loud noise, and energy was being sucked into it, appearing and disappearing constantly.

The purple-blood dragons that were charging toward Su Ping were pushed away by the impact. They were unhurt because Su Ping had pulled his punches.

“Hold your horses. I’m not your enemy,” Su Ping declared.

The dragons were startled by the force of that punch.

“He can crush the void! Is he at the Heavenly Dragon rank?”

“How can it be? He’s just a pathetic creature!”

“He is weak, and that is obvious...”

The dragons discussed, surprised.

Dragons regarded as Heavenly Dragons were the top-tier predators in that dragon world.

“Hmm, even so, that doesn’t make his behavior excusable. How dare a pathetic creature like you crave for our dragon origin? Prepare to die!”

The bulky purple-blood dragon took a step forward and coldly looked down at Su Ping from a height. The strong surge of energy around the dragon created some grayish marks around it; those marks were extended like many tentacles, cutting up space. The dragon was able to manipulate space just by emitting energy, which had astounded all the other dragons.

“Go to hell!”

The dragon did nothing else but lift its paws and yet, space had been crushed. In the meantime, a shocking force suddenly rushed out through the nothingness.

Su Ping observed. Even though he didn’t detect any energy coming at him, the rich experience he had gained from other battles told him that danger was coming. Su Ping vanished on the spot and reappeared several hundred meters away. The next second, the blur he had left was torn apart by the dragon’s claw.

The blur was not the only thing crushed. The space around the blur had also collapsed.

The dragon was unhappy since Su Ping had been able to avoid its attack. The dragon furiously unleashed more energy. A green palm with a dark purple hue was generated. That wasn’t the hand of a dragon, but of some ancient creature; that palm was more than a hundred meters tall, which vanished into the void.

Su Ping suddenly felt space around him had been frozen, as if the air had turned into cement. He had been immobilized on the spot.

At the same time, the void around him cracked and the huge hand that had vanished emerged again and he was right in the middle of that palm.

The fingers closed, trying to crush Su Ping to death.

Su Ping unleashed his astral powers. The Force Field appeared behind him and many demons and fiends were inside. Suddenly, two demons broke free from some unspeakable shackles, pounced at Su Ping and grabbed his shoulders to pull themselves out.

With the help of the two demons, the red glow in Su Ping’s eyes shone ever so brightly and he gained more strength. Su Ping yelled, broke free from the palm, and charged at the purple-blood dragon. “Take this!!”cSu Ping bellowed.

Boom!!

The glow from the fist was as glaring as the sun.

The purple-blood dragon was taken aback. Su Ping’s punch was too fast and too vicious that space was collapsing. The dragon didn’t think it could take the hit.

Still, the dragon lifted its limbs out of instinct, ready to use a bloodline defensive skill. There came a loud noise and tremor on the mountain.

Dust was stirred up, blotting everyone’s view before it was blown away by the wind.

Su Ping was trying to catch his breath while floating in the air. In front of him was the purple-blood dragon which remained unhurt, but there was a pit with a diameter of several hundred meters next to the dragon.

“I am here for the dragon origin, not to make myself your enemy,” Su Ping said, panting. Again, he had shown mercy. The purple-blood dragon was in a daze. The pit next to it was an eyesore.

The large dragon took a few steps back. Su Ping was about to start the negotiation that he thought was going to happen, when he heard the purple-blood dragon screaming, “Set into formation. Kill him!” “Kill him!!” All the other purple-blood dragons screamed in agreement.

S screa

The purple-blood dragons began to unleash some kind of purple aura that was interconnected to form a certain ancient formation.

The dragon that was able to generate the most profound purple aura was the one that struck Su Ping. The dragon stayed at the center of the formation, gaining more momentum than before. “You’re asking for the dragon origin? How dare

you!

“Go to hell!!” that purple-blood dragon shouted. All the purple aura poured back into the dragon which was growing larger and larger, until it reached a height of close to five hundred meters. The dragon waved its paws as the energy gathered around its chest. That dark purple palm appeared again, only this time, even the forearm was visible; some mysterious patterns were engraved on the forearm.

That palm seemed to be strong enough to topple the sky; it was pressing down on Su Ping.

Su Ping was speechless.

He had pulled his punches twice, but still, it didn’t earn him a chance to negotiate peacefully.

Su Ping clenched his hands as he stared at the mighty palm pressing on him. He understood that negotiating was out of the question. The only way out was... resorting to violence! He would resort to so much violence that the dragons would kneel in front of him!!

“Ah...!”

Su Ping dashed toward the sky, shouting, burning his blood to unleash great powers. Behind him, the third demon climbed out from the Force Field.

Boom!

The demon added even more energy to Su Ping. He shouted as he charged toward that palm.

Boom!!

That palm came down to crush Su Ping.

But Su Ping threw himself toward that palm.

While carrying a golden glow, the Fist of Exorcist bumped into the palm. The palm was incredibly tough. Even though it had been slowed down by the Fist of Exorcist, the palm was still whooshing down. Space would freeze wherever the palm passed. Su Ping felt his energy was draining. While that feeling was subtle, he was getting a sense that time was being robbed away from him.

That was a Star Rank skill!

Boom!

Su Ping smashed himself right into the palm.

Undoubtedly, his body was crushed and he was reduced into a mist of blood. The Little Skeleton that he had merged with was also turned to pieces. The different thing was that the Little Skeleton had survived. It was regenerated in the void.

But at the same time, Su Ping re-emerged on the spot as well.

The palm had already gone past the area by the time he came back to life, whooshing down toward the ground behind Su Ping.

Su Ping didn’t even look back at that palm. He summoned the Little Skeleton. As white bones entangled him, he was able to burn his blood once more. The energy was surging out of him as if it would never be exhausted.

“Come on!!!” Su Ping bellowed as he charged toward the purple-blood dragon.

The smug smile was erased from the purple dragon’s face when Su Ping re-appeared in the air. This had completely shocked the dragon.

The rest of the dragons were staring in bewilderment. The trembling in their scales spoke of their terror.

Was that... traveling back in time?

But the ability to manipulate time was something that could only be mastered by creatures at the Star Rank!

Boom!

Making the most of the time window created by the purple dragon’s shock, Su Ping reached the dragon and punched at the soft spot that was between its jaw and its neck. The scales fell off, revealing a deep, bloody wound.
