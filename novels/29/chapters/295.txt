Chapter 297 Another Temporary Mission

The state the Aurora Fox was in came as a complete shock to Su Ping.

“You messed up the training and fed something bad to my Aurora Fox. Its strength is not even at the fifth-rank, not to mention the seventh-rank! On top of that, I have to spend money to have it treated!” Sun Qiu gnashed his teeth in hatred.

Su Ping pulled a long face. He was sure that this Aurora Fox did not leave the store like this.

That was to say, the Aurora Fox was only suffering this misery because of this man after it had left the store.

Was this an accident? Or not?

Su Ping felt anger was burning up in him. He wasn’t furious because this man was slandering him, but because of the tragic state the Aurora Fox was in. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Your pet was in perfect shape when you took your pet away from my store.” Su Ping’s eyes exuded coldness as he fixed his stare at Sun Qiu. “Are you here because the Liu family gave you instructions? Or did you hurt your battle pet outside and came to blackmail me?”

Scared by Su Ping’s glare, Sun Qiu’s heart skipped a beat. He would have never imagined that he would see such horrors in a human’s eyes. Sun Qiu gulped and took a step backward. “Are you still trying to deny it? What Liu family? I don’t understand what you are talking about? Are you calling me a liar?”

“You... should rot in hell!”

All of a sudden, with a turbulence in the air, Sun Qiu was lifted up and hovered midair. Having lost his balance, plus the feeling of his feet being off the ground frightened Sun Qiu. He cried out, knowing that the only people capable of this move were titled battle pet warriors.

“You, you have hurt my pet. Now you’re trying to kill me in public?” Sun Qiu’s voice trembled.

The other customers never expected this turn of events. They wondered if it was a titled battle pet warrior hiding in the store or whether Su Ping was the one who had captured Sun Qiu like this.

Su Ping looked too young for people to believe that he was the one lifting Sun Qiu up.

Furious as Su Ping was, he chose not to finish Sun Qiu’s life directly. To detriment his own business over a man like this was not worthwhile.

“You claimed that I have hurt your pet, right? I will have your pet healed, we’ll later see what else you can say!” Su Ping kept his cold glare on Sun Qiu while he mentally contacted Joanna, telling her to come and treat the pet. Of the many skills Joanna mastered, healing was one of them.

“Ding!”

All of a sudden, Su Ping heard a voice on his mind.

“Someone deliberately discrediting the store detected. Temporary mission: save the reputation of the store and kill the person behind this!

“Time limit for the mission: 72 hours.

“Reward for mission accomplished: a pet skill book of legendary level!

“Punishment for mission failed: minus one million energy points!”

The system blurted out with rage.

Su Ping was surprised. It had been a long time since the system had issued any temporary missions.

The first time was when the store had just opened. The Fan siblings went to pick bones with him, which triggered the system to issue a temporary mission out of wrath. A long time had passed since then. This was the second time that the system had issued a temporary mission.

“A pet skill book of the legendary level?” Su Ping’s eyes glowed in excitement. Last time, the Inferno Dragon had spent a week in the Demigod Burial to learn just one legendary skill and that was by accident.

A pet skill book could be applied to a pet directly for immediate study. He thought it would be the best if the skill was suitable for the Little Skeleton. It would help the Little Skeleton to build up its strength.

It seems that this man has upset the system, resorting to tarnishing the reputation of my store by harming his own pet, Su Ping thought. In the old days, there had been people who had shown up, treating his store as an unethical business, but none of them had caught the system’s attention. Yet today, this man’s action had enraged the system. Su Ping stopped his thoughts from running away and turned his focus back to this man. At the same time, Joanna went to see the Aurora Fox. She darted one look at the pet that was lying on the ground and frowned.

Right then, she heard a strange message in her mind.

That message had been delivered in an ancient language that she had never heard of and it was not the human language that she would use to speak with Su Ping. However, it just so happened that she could understand the meaning

According to the verbal instructions, she had to treat and cure the pet and that was her responsibility as an “employee.”

Success and her employee points could increase by 20!

If she failed, she would lose 20 points!

In the meantime, a small information interface popped up on her mind with her employee points displayed on it:

100 points!

Those were her initial points.

When it got down to 50 points, she would be transformed into a pet for the store.

When it decreased to 80 points, she would lose her employee benefits.

Joanna was stunned but she never questioned the authority of the being behind the mysterious voice for a second. She had known for a long time that the creature behind this store was something far superior that she could ever imagine. Besides, this was the first time that she had been informed of a way to increase her employee points since she came to work in Su Ping’s store. She could have 20 extra points!

She took a deep breath and squatted down. She placed her hand on the trembling Aurora Fox. The profound divine energy seeped into the Aurora Fox from her fingers and the energy floated around inside the Aurora Fox. “You! What are you doing! Do not touch my pet!” Sun Qiu shouted in surprise and anger.

Joanna closed her eyes. A moment later, she opened them and a glint of coldness rose in her eyes. She looked at Sun Qiu who was still frozen in midair. “The Aurora Fox is not of an outstanding species but its master, you, are a piece of garbage!” she berated him.

Sun Qiu could find no words to reply.

Su Ping was surprised that Joanna would get angry over this.

Joanna put her hands together for the divine energy to converge over the Aurora Fox. The wisps of divine energy wrapped the Aurora Fox up like a cocoon.

All the customers marveled at this mirage and stared with open mouths.

They had never seen a healing skill like this, except in movies.

A moment later, Joanna stopped mobilizing the divine energy and all the “special effects” vanished. The Aurora Fox landed on the ground. The ugly dots over its snow-white fur were gone. There seemed to be some traces of golden glow over the tips of its fur.

Su Ping could tell that it was because of divine energy residue.

After Joanna’s treatment, the Aurora Fox’s aptitude would improve as well.

“System, do you have a way to sever the tie between the pet and its master?” Su Ping asked in his mind.

The system kept silent for a moment before it replied, “I’m not willing to sever the tie between any pet and its master.” Su Ping was surprised. Not willing to? That meant the system could but would not do it.

He did not try to persuade the system which had a one-track mind. The system would never give up once it had made a decision. Since the system could not, then Su Ping decided to solve the matter by himself!

“Tell me. Who sent you here?” Su Ping’s glare could freeze the man. Su Ping had a guess: the Liu family. However, he could not rule out the possibility that it could be another family making a third party the instrument of a crime and this man was the borrowed knife.
