Chapter 924: Lure and Kill

Cooperating with him was the right choice.?The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes saw Su Ping’s performance and also increased his speed.

There were fewer and fewer void beasts nearby; they were swiftly eliminated without the need for backup.

“Very good!”

“Count the casualties!”

The general put on a smile once Sector Seven was cleared; the void beasts had been finished off even faster than usual. That was exactly why geniuses were so extraordinary!

He looked around; a dozen people were hurt, but nobody was killed.

“Let’s head back!” said the general.

The same cover was opened, and everybody followed the general in.

Once they were back on the island, everybody saw that the battles in other sectors were also coming to an end. After all, the soldiers had ample experience in dealing with void beasts.

“This battle will be added to your dossiers. It’ll help you in the future whenever you go to a military place of the Federation,” said the general with a smile.

He was clearly friendlier after having fought together.

However, he knew that the kids were probably not interested in such achievements, as the organizations backing them could give them all the resources they needed.

Everybody dispersed, but Su Ping remained standing in the same spot. The young man with golden wheels in his eyes and Su Jin’er approached him. The latter glanced at him and said, “You must be exhausted after such a battle. Do you want to have some rest first?”

“No need. I have something to help me recover,” said Su Ping.

As a matter of fact, he could recover with nothing but the Chaos Star Chart.

The young man with golden wheels in his eyes remarked, “Normal void beasts aren’t hard to deal with; on the other hand, lord-level void beasts will certainly be stronger in every aspect. It’s a pity that we didn’t meet any during that battle; we could have gained some experience.”

Su Jin’er said, “There’s more than one type of void beasts in this place. The void beasts we’ll be luring may also be different.”

Refraining from commenting on the matter, Su Ping said, “Let’s go.”

“I’m ready,” said Su Jin’er.

She had been dawdling earlier, so she wasn’t really tired.

The other young man didn’t disagree; he was also ready to go.

Su Ping instantly filed an application to go hunting, which was their purpose on that island, so the general didn’t stop him. He even gave Su Ping a map and a few reminders, all thanks to his remarkable performance in the earlier battle.

“Don’t approach the vortex areas; those are the lords’ habitats.

“Don’t go to the fractured areas either. You might fall into deeper spaces and get caught in unknown danger.”

Su Ping took note of all the reminders. He then left the island with Su Jin’er and the young man with golden wheels in his eyes. He moved to the east according to the map, a direction that few other hunters had gone to.

“Are we going to lure the beasts in a far place, or over to this place?” Su Jin’er looked at Su Ping.

She was obviously hoping to make the beasts approach the base; that way they could return to the island in time if any accident happened, and then kill the lord-level beasts with the island’s reinforcements.

Su Ping glanced at her and said, “Is your trap reliable? It won’t attract a bunch of beasts, will it?”

“It attracts a void beast named Purple Wind, which usually lives alone. The Ant Beasts we met earlier are common gregarious void beasts.” Su Jin’er seemed to know them very well.

The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes asked in surprise, “Purple Wind? They’re very rare, and weak.”

“Exactly. That’s why I chose them as targets,” said Su Jin’er.

This would lower the difficulty of hunting to a minimum.

Once he saw that she was fully prepared, Su Ping said, “In that case, let’s just lure the target over. Let’s find an unappealing place in case anyone is watching us.”

“It won’t be easy to take advantage of us,” Su Jin’er sneered.

Soon, the three of them reached a place in the void according to the map.

The island was nowhere to be seen, and the environment was filthy. The occasional wood piece and dry branches, which were already blackened, would be found floating in the void. They were already lifeless, and too worthless to be taken back to the Federation for experiments.

Once they decided upon the location, Su Jin’er took out a plate and said, “This is an astral array that can be automatically activated. It can detect and resist any creature in the Star Lord State or weaker.”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. As he had expected, top geniuses were truly well-prepared.

The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes put on a bitter smile and said, “I prepared an astral plate too. It’s of a different model, but has similar functions.”

He had intended to help too, but Su Jin’er had stolen his thunder.

Su Jin’er glanced at him in silence. She quickly activated the astral plate and opened her hand; there was a purple red bottle with some fluid in it.

She then opened the bottle and a strangely fragrant smell began to spread.

“Let’s wait for the fish to bite the bait,” said Su Jin’er.

Su Ping glanced at her bottle but didn’t ask. He waited patiently while maintaining his fusion with the Little Skeleton. He was still wary after the mental shock in the earlier battle.

Time flew by, one second after the other.

An hour later, Su Ping asked, “How long does it take for your trap to take effect?”

Su Jin’er was also feeling ill at ease. After all, they might encounter unpredictable dangers in the sixth space, even though they were protected by the astral plate.

“Normally speaking, a quarter of an hour, unless there’s no Purple Wind beasts nearby,” Su Jin’er frowned and said.

The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes asked in confusion, “Is it possible that all the void beasts near the island have been killed?”

“That’s a possibility,” Su Jin’er put on a bitter smile.

Su Ping thought for a moment and said, “Let’s go further then.”

They were in the sixth space; he would not dare to overestimate himself.

Su Jin’er thought for a moment and closed the bottle.

Su Ping checked the map and moved forward. The area seemed to be devoid of activity, but there were floating items here and there. Also, due to the lack of continents, it was hard to get one’s bearings. It was possible that they would lose their up and down reference without the map to guide them after a battle.

It would have been impossible to return to the island otherwise.

Following the map’s indications, Su Ping flew towards the east.

He stopped when he was about three hundred kilometers away from the island; there were no other hunters nearby. He had a grave look, as he had heard weird roars and whispers as they moved along. The remains from the primordial times made him feel uncomfortable.

“Let’s try here,” said Su Ping while floating in the void.

That place was just as empty and dark, looking exactly the same as the one they had tested earlier.

Su Jin’er nodded; she then activated her astral plate and opened her bottle again.

The three of them were vigilant, ready to defend themselves.

Half an hour later—the void around them suddenly began to shake. The rocks floating in the void were quickly pushed away by something.

Roar!

A roar came from the distance. Su Jin’er turned her head and said with glittering eyes, “A Purple Wind!”

A purple bird that looked like a giant eagle was flying over; it was fifty meters long, with bloody feathers that reeked of dead fish.

There were five eyeballs on its head, and the feathers on its chest were somehow depicting something which resembled a weird human face.

The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes glanced at it and shook his head. “It’s not a lord-level one.”

“Anyway, let’s kill it first.”

Su Jin’er noticed it too, and seemed to be disappointed. However, she pushed her scorching aura toward the monster as a way to prevent it from luring other beasts over with its shrieks.

There was a bam, then the Purple Wind cried as it was set ablaze.

Su Jin’er dashed closer to the beast and pointed with her fingers, penetrating its body with scorching light. The Purple Wind’s struggle was soon stopped, and it was burnt to ashes.

Su Ping didn’t take action, as the target was only a Star State void beast; even Su Jin’er was able to finish it off with ease.

“Let’s wait a bit longer,” Su Jin’er said regretfully after she returned.

Su Ping nodded and sat cross-legged in the void, waiting patiently.

Ten minutes passed and the void shook again. Su Ping was able to clearly detect waves from the void. Even the sticky, oppressing force was considerably weakened.

Roar!

The next moment, a giant, purple shadow swooped over.

Su Jin’er narrowed her eyes and her expression changed. “Oh no!”

The creature was none other than a Purple Wind, evidently much bigger than the previous one. It had ten eyes on its head, and sharper claws. There was also a dark shadow on its back which was emitting a cold and horrifying aura.

The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes was truly thrilled, until he saw the dark shadow. He quickly became terrified as he exclaimed, “It’s the Black Shark!”

Black Sharks were among the most brutal void beasts!

That Black Shark was at the moment attacking the Purple Wind. Also at the lord-level, but it was much stronger than the other beast.

Su Ping’s expression also changed a bit; he was confident of hunting one Purple Wind, but he had also seen Black Sharks in a cultivation site before!

He had actually seen an Ascendant State Black Shark followed by a bunch of lord-level Black Sharks!

“Run back to the base!” cried Su Ping.

They could always come back if the hunt wasn’t fruitful, but they would never return if they died.

Su Jin’er was planning to try her luck. She put on a bitter smile when Su Ping retreated in such a decisive manner. She was actually quite confident of finishing off the Purple Wind.

Since Su Ping was stronger than her, he would only need to restrain the Black Shark.

They could escape once she finished the Purple Wind, marking one lord-level beast killed to their count.

But Su Ping was unwilling to take the risk, and she couldn’t change his mind. There was nothing wrong with his choice; the most common cause of death for geniuses was acting recklessly.

Hardly had Su Ping given the order when the young man who had golden wheels in his eyes rushed back to the island.

The latter thought that they could handle one lord-level void beast, but it would be suicide to challenge two.

Also, one of them was a Black Shark. Even real Star Lords would retreat, unless they were truly strong!

The Purple Wind cried again and gave chase as they moved away. It flashed consecutively in the void, and the dark shadow on its back was right behind it with an unhurried attitude, as if enjoying the chase.

“Throw your bottle away, or it’ll keep attracting that thing,” Su Ping said quickly after realizing what was going on.

Su Jin’er showed a slight change in her expression as she hesitated. However, since Su Ping was unwilling to fight, she would have to regretfully give up. She would have gone there by herself if she could have foreseen this, to seize the chance of advancing.

She quickly dropped the bottle.

The Purple Wind flew towards the bottle and swallowed it.

However, it cried after swallowing the bottle. It seemed that Su Jin’er had poisoned the fluid.

It was all part of her solo hunting preparations.

The Black Shark realized something and, seemingly infuriated, revealed itself and bit apart the Purple Wind’s neck. Then, it turned its head and gazed at Su Ping’s team before it charged at them. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It was angry since its prey had been snatched.

The expressions of Su Ping and his teammates changed. The young man who had golden wheels in his eyes unleashed the power of his constitution and donned a silver armor. He moved even faster than Su Ping.

Su Jin’er changed her expression too and took out a bottle with some sort of drug. Then, her body turned red, and her arms turned into phoenix wings; she flapped the wings and surpassed Su Ping.

When three guys were being pursued by a ferocious tiger, the only thing to do was to outrun the others.

Su Ping was left behind at the moment.

He looked at them and changed his expression. The other two had obviously used their last resorts; his final trump cards were the two precious gifts his new master had given him.

Would he be forced to use the purple bracelet?

However, even the purple bracelet would only protect him for a while, until his master went there to help.

He would obviously lose his qualifications to advance if his master showed up to save him.

Roar!

The enormous shadow of the Black Shark got closer. It widened its bloody mouth, which covered an area with a radius of a hundred meters around Su Ping.
