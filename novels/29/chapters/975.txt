Chapter 978: The Chaos Perception Dragon

I heard that some human beings have become as strong as Ancestral Gods and go by the name Lord Supreme…

Is there a Lord Supreme backing that guy??the Rain Emperor thought, with coldness in his eyes. If a Lord Supreme was indeed involved, the human had surely gone to their clan with clandestine purposes.

“That young man couldn’t have blown himself up. It must be a special escape technique,” speculated an old god.

It also dawned on the others: such a genius would not have a reason to kill himself that easily. It was also weird that the Rain Emperor was unable to resurrect him. So, such a tactic had to be an escape method.

At ground level—the young prince’s eyes glittered. He remembered Su Ping’s uncanny resurrections, and also saw the likelihood of such a speculation. So, he might run into that human being again.

He left the Rain Clan freely. There must be a bigshot supporting him. Unfortunately, the Ancestral Gods are sleeping, or they could have caught him,?thought the young prince.

…

At the same time, somewhere else in the Archean Divinity.

Blue light particles gathered, forming the shape of a human being. It was none other than Su Ping.

Hardly had he opened his eyes when he noticed a heavy breathing. He looked at the source of the sound, only to see a gigantic beast he couldn’t see entirely. Every scale on the beast’s tail was as big as a mountain.

Where have I been randomly resurrected?

Su Ping was astonished.

That beast, obviously of divine stock, had a tremendous amount of divine power. It was a strong and massive creature of the Archean Divinity; it’s city-like size could accommodate tens of millions of people!

What did such a size entail?

It meant that the beast could easily swallow millions of people in one go!

Su Ping probed the region and found that the beast seemed to be sound asleep. He instantly brought Joanna and Tang Ruyan out from his small world.

Both girls got their bearings and were then shocked by the beast.

“Are we no longer in the Rain Clan?” Joanna was still worried about their previous plight.

Su Ping nodded. “We’ve been teleported elsewhere; I don’t know where exactly. Do you recognize this beast?”

Joanna seemed relieved. She looked at the beast and shook her head. “I can’t see the whole body. Judging by its size though, it is most likely of a higher level than my original self.”

She wore a grave expression while she said that.

Tang Ruyan was silent for a long time, mouth wide open. The trip had been an unprecedented eye-opener for her thus far.

“This guy is sleeping. I’m going to find out what it looks like,” said Su Ping.

He had already left the Rain Clan behind. He was angry since he failed to break the bell, but there was nothing he could do. After all, the Rain Clan was a high-ranked faction. Failing was natural in such conditions. That being said, Su Ping was still upset by the outcome.

Therefore, he had to leave the matter behind, or he would only get angrier.

Whoosh!

Su Ping took to the sky and kept on rising.

It didn’t take long for the gigantic beast to look smaller under his feet; he was able to get a full view of the beast when he reached an altitude of ten thousand meters. It turned out to be a beast covered in scales, with the body of an armadillo and the tail of a crocodile. Its white horns curled above its head like a crown, making it look majestic.

“Well…”

Joanna seemed shocked and suspicious as she followed Su Ping.

“Did you recognize it?” asked Su Ping curiously.

Next to the beast was a vast plain where a lot of footprints could be seen. It was a barbaric land.

“It looks similar to a beast recorded in the secret books, named Chaos Perception Dragon. It’s one of the most ferocious beasts in the Archean Divinity!” said Joanna in a low voice.

“The Chaos Perception Dragon?” Now that he was intrigued, Su Ping asked, “What’s its level? Celestial State? Or even higher?”

Joanna shook her head and replied, “It’s as strong as the Ancestral Gods! Normal Ancestral Gods wouldn’t even be a match for it. Such beasts are born in the Eye of the Realm and they master the law of chaos. They also have other unbelievable abilities.”

“The Eye of the Realm?” Su Ping repeated the new term and was truly interested.

“It’s the source of the Realm of Gods. It’s said that all the power in this realm was released from the Eye,” whispered Joanna. “That’s what I heard from my parents.”

Su Ping nodded and looked at the beast.?No wonder I felt a strange yet familiar aura in the void. You helped me remember: it’s the power of chaos. It’s very likely that the energy exhaled by the massive dragon carries the power of chaos.

Such an energy was easy for him to detect, since the air in the store’s Chaos Spirit Pool was similar.

“It really is the Chaos Perception Dragon…” Joanna was stunned.

She looked at the gigantic beast in disbelief. Such a ferocious creature was sound asleep before her? A being considered unstoppable in the Realm of Deities for years?

“System, if that thing kills us, can you resurrect us?” Su Ping asked the system.

A long time later, the latter replied with an angry tone, “Are you questioning my ability?”

Okay.

The arrogant reply made Su Ping feel at ease. He then said to Joanna, “Let’s get closer and steal some chaos power. It would be greatly beneficial.”

The power of chaos was the source of all powers, including astral power and divine power. All of them had been derived from it.

Joanna glared at him. “Have you lost your mind? If it truly is the Chaos Perception Dragon, the thing can easily kill us with a sneeze! Let’s get away while it’s asleep!”

“It’s all right. We can keep on reviving,” said Su Ping with a smile.

Stunned by his response, Joanna then asked, “We can resurrect even after being killed by that?”

“Yes.” Su Ping nodded resolutely. He had yet to test this, but he was confident in the system.

“…”

Joanna was lost for words; she found Su Ping more and more perplexing.?Not even a beast as strong as an Ancestral God was unable to kill us. Wouldn’t this mean that the entity backing Su Ping is even stronger than the Ancestral Gods?

But, could there be such a powerhouse living in the world?

Or rather, could such beings still be considered as “living”?

Su Ping had already swooped down. He said to Tang Ruyan, “This is a good opportunity. Try to absorb the power of chaos. It will help you a lot.”

“Okay!”

Tang Ruyan nodded quickly. She didn’t know much about the Ancestral Gods, except that they were stronger than Celestials. She wasn’t worried though; Su Ping could resurrect her.

Soon after, the trio approached the Chaos Perception Dragon. Su Ping aimed to land on its head. The lower he descended, the bigger the beast became. He eventually reached the large beast’s partially open mouth, and had a chance to see the sharp teeth inside.

The breath coming from the mouth was smelly, but there was also a vague power of chaos in the mix.

Su Ping immediately sat cross-legged on one lip, right next to the pointed teeth. The exhalations of the beast were like level-12 gales with strength to uproot trees, yet Su Ping sat tightly and absorbed the power of chaos.

Joanna was dumbfounded after seeing what Su Ping was doing.

He was probably the very first person bold enough to steal food from one of the top ferocious beasts in the Realm of Gods.

She finally understood why he had been so nonchalant when they first met. It wasn’t just because he could resurrect an infinite number of times, but also because he had seen too many creatures that were more terrifying than her. He was already bold enough. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Joanna gave a slight head shake and approached Su Ping to sit down next to him.

Soon after… Three people—who seemed smaller than ants by comparison—were sitting right next to the Chaos Perception Dragon’s mouth.

They were surrounded by the air of chaos.

The breath contains an immense amount of energy.

It seems to be related to nature and space. Every breath causes time and space around it to fluctuate…

Su Ping had also realized how extraordinary the massive creature was. He was greatly shocked. Could Ancestral Gods also influence time and space by merely breathing?

If so, couldn’t they easily travel through time as long as they wished to?

Su Ping was having a hard time imagining what kind of things could have a chance to suppress the creature!

“This beast didn’t participate in the war, or simply hid and waited it out,” whispered Joanna.

The fact that the beast existed in the rebuilt Archean Divinity implied that it had indeed survived the catastrophe.

Su Ping nodded.

The three of them fell silent and devoted themselves to cultivating.

Su Ping felt that all his astral power was ebbing in the astral ocean when the air of chaos entered his body, making room for the air of chaos. All the astral power in the way backed off, as if conscious.

The air of chaos quickly sank to the bottom of the astral ocean.

Su Ping was able to tell that the bit of air was as effective as five percent of his astral power!

It was worth mentioning that if released, five percent of his astral power could turn into mist and cover a whole town.

That tiny bit of chaotic air was much smaller in volume, but it was just as effective!

If I can possibly transform all my astral power into chaos power…?Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He was excited by the prospect. He would be thousands of times stronger if realized!

Such an improvement would be unbelievable!

However, Su Ping was certain about this being a realistic idea.

After all, that primal air was dispersed since the age of chaos. This Chaos Perception Dragon was born from chaos, so it stored the air of chaos inside its body, which enabled it to become as strong as the Ancestral Gods.

I’ll see if I can get anything from the Chaos Spirit Pool in my store,?Su Ping thought, feeling the urge to return.

The wind around him stopped at that moment.

Then, time seemed to be frozen.

Su Ping’s head was completely blank. His body stiffened as it was wreathed in an indescribable pressure.

While in a trance, Su Ping seemed to see a pair of gigantic eyes gazing at him, devoid of emotion.

The eyes were as massive as the sun, imposing more pressure on him than any creature ever had.

Su Ping had a strong mind, and yet he still felt as if his blood were freezing.

“Crack! Crack!”

Su Ping then heard teeth chattering, and struggled to turn his head back. He found that Joanna was pale and trembling.

On the other side—Tang Ruyan was also rigid. A closer inspection would reveal that she was no longer breathing. She had been scared to death!

Yes, she had literally been scared to death.

However, Su Ping didn’t want to make light of the situation and tease her. He had seen countless terrifying creatures, but he was still too terrified to move at the moment. Any average Star Lord would have died from shock!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In the next moment, Su Ping could no longer think.

Joanna, Tang Ruyan and he himself exploded without giving any sort of warning.

Su Ping was finally freed from the beast’s pressure when he reappeared in the resurrection space. He breathed heavily, and was somehow too scared to resurrect.

But Su Ping became determined all of a sudden.

He resurrected in the original place.

Whoosh!

The trio reappeared in the same place, but to Su Ping’s surprise, they saw a vast world in front of them, and the gargantuan dragon was gone!

Su Ping looked around. He could see the claw marks on the ground that continued and faded into the distance. The dry grass assured him that he was in the same place.

The system’s resurrection had never gone wrong.

“Has it left?”

“I think so,” replied Joanna, stunned by what she saw.

Su Ping felt disappointed. He could still sense the great dragon’s remaining air, but it had left already, probably heading to a deeper space, or maybe another point in time.

Obviously, the beast didn’t leave because of them.

After all, they were nothing more than ants or pebbles to a beast.

“What a shame.” Su Ping sighed, but deep down he was somehow relieved. The horrifying pressure from moments earlier… Su Ping was reluctant to face that beast again.

He shook his head and said, “We should get going too.”

“Where to?”

Joanna wore a troubled expression.

“I don’t know. Let’s find out.”

Once he said that, Su Ping took them into his small world and blew himself up again.
