Chapter 1365 Transcending the Tribulation (1)

Su Ping was slightly surprised. Seeing her determined look, he looked at the others behind her, only to see confidence with a touch of awkwardness in their eyes.

Su Ping instantly realized what they thought.

“This worm tide is very dangerous. It’s possible that you’ll never come back. Have you really thought it through?” asked Su Ping.

Xingyue Shen’er chuckled. “Don’t underestimate us. Maybe the worm tide will be averted much quicker with our intervention.”

She intentionally spoke in an optimistic and relieving manner. However, Su Ping knew that no Star Lords were that naive.

“We’ve already left our last words for family and friends. We won’t regret it even if we die in battle,” said someone in the crowd.

“That’s right. Our descendants are still waiting for us. We can’t ask others to protect our children, can we?” another chimed in.

Su Ping glanced at them, only to find that all were unremarkable. Who would have thought that they would be willing to step up in that time of crisis?

“In that case, let me give you a little something,” said Su Ping, “Stay here for one more day. I’ll give you some pets tomorrow.”

“We appreciate your kindness, but our assignments are going to be very dangerous. It’s best not to let pets suffer along with us,” said Xingyue Shen’er, shaking her head.

Su Ping shook his own head and said, ‘I insist that you accept them, or I won’t feel at ease.”

After such words, everyone exchanged looks and could only accept it.

The next day.

They went to Su Ping’s store again. After waiting for half an hour, Su Ping returned from a cultivation site and saw that they were waiting inside. He instantly took them to the test room.

“Each of you will pick one of these little

guys.”

Su Ping summoned a batch of pets and lined them up in the test room.

Everybody was astounded. Are they really “little guys”?

All of those beasts were in the Ascendant State. They had extremely ferocious looks; some were scary, while others were gloomy and brutal.

All of them were compelled to back off, even wanting to escape the room.

Some of the guys present swallowed and even trembled. They were still in the Star State. How could they withstand the pressure of that many brutal Ascendant pets?

“You…”

Xingyue Shen’er was stunned for a long time, before she slowly turned around and looked at Su Ping. “Are you giving them to me?”

“I’m not really giving them to you. I’m actually selling them,” said Su Ping. “But their prices are quite affordable to you.”

It kind of ruined the atmosphere when he said that he was selling them, but he couldn’t break the store’s rules. After all, the pets caught in cultivation sites couldn’t be taken away without being properly sold. He didn’t have permission to give them away.

Everybody simply thought that he was doing it so they wouldn’t reject the offer. After all, he did ask them to wait another day to give them something. Would he really be selling those pets?

Besides, even if those Ascendant creatures were sold in the market, their prices would be astronomical; even for Ascendant cultivators, let alone Star Lords. They would be impossible to afford.

Su Ping immediately told them the prices, and everyone took it as confirmation that the former was only doing that because he feared they would be reluctant to accept such a great favor.

“We appreciate your kindness, but all those pets are in the Ascendant State. My father can take one. As for the rest, we wouldn’t dare use them even if we took any. What if they attack us…?” Xingyue Shen’er said to Su Ping after some hesitation.

The others also looked away and nodded.

They were very interested in those pets, but they knew it would be difficult to use them.

Even the Star Lords of many major families would think twice about having Ascendant pets, because the gap between Ascendants and Star Lords was too wide. It was easy for the pet to get out of control despite the contract’s restraint.

“Don’t worry about that; I’ve planted some restrictions in their souls. They would never defy you,” said Su Ping.

Naturally, he had foreseen this, so he “persuaded” those Ascendant pets by making use of laws. Even the normal Celestials could do that; it was certainly easy for him.

“You can do that?”

Everybody was surprised, knowing that Su Ping had no need to lie to them.

“You can give it a try,” said Su Ping with a smile, “Feel free to examine their abilities in this place. I’ll feel better if you’re protected by Ascendant pets during your service.”

Everyone decided to accept after Su Ping said it that way.

Noticing that the Star State cultivators in the crowd were feeling envious, Su Ping approached them and said, “If you don’t mind, I’ll help you condense a small world, so that you’ll immediately advance and become Star Lords.”

“Help us condense a small world?”

Not just them, the others also looked at Su Ping in a daze.

What kind of method is that? We’ve never heard about it before!

“No, we certainly don’t mind.”

One of them was quick to react. He was astonished and thrilled. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Having heard all the legends about Su Ping from Xingyue Shen’er’s father, he already considered the young man to be a Celestial State master. The abilities of such existences were beyond his imagination. He wouldn’t even doubt for a moment, even if Su Ping claimed that he would turn the universe upside down.

“Okay.”

Seeing that they accepted his offer, Su Ping instantly began to impart the needed knowledge.
