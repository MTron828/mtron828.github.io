Chapter 1096: The Last Man

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

“Die!”

The red-robed young man changed his expression upon seeing Kepaf dead, but it was pointless to say anything else. He was the first to march towards Shuai Qianhou.

He inferred that Su Ping was very likely carrying the ultimate treasure.

It wasn’t only because of Su Ping’s confidence, but also because Shuai Qianhou had shown the seven tokens.

Su Ping was too talented and strong to give away the ultimate treasure and tokens to others. He certainly didn’t think he would do that if he were Su Ping.

Even if the others were his senior brothers and sisters, so what? Not even one’s own parents could be trusted when dealing with the true god’s legacy!

The moment he attacked, the red-robed young man said to his companions telepathically, “Just stall him!”

He believed that they wouldn’t escape, unless they were willing to give up the opportunity to get the legacy. Begging would also mean death; that was the only chance to fight!

Indeed, they weren’t going to run for their lives; they simply approached Su Ping, more solemn and grave than before.

‘They wanted to stall Su Ping, and then wait until the red-robed young man finished off Shuai Qianhou, all to join hands and slay Su Ping afterwards!

“You’re sure that I’m not carrying the ultimate treasure?”

Shuai Qianhou realized what the red-robed leader was up to. He heaved a sigh; his earlier scheme was too short for him to figure out what Su Ping was capable of.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have agreed to leave the ultimate treasure to Su Ping.

To be honest, he didn’t really want to fight the guy; he wanted the latter to fight with Su Ping, so that he could see more of this senior brother’s capabilities.

However, the red-robed young man was already charging at him, exactly as Su Ping planned. So, he could only act and take care of the man.

Bang!

Space was twisted like a muddy swamp that consumed the red-robed leader.

The two of them quickly disappeared as they went into deeper spaces. This time, they went all the way to the seventh space.

Shuai Qianhou believed it was impossible for Su Ping to detect anything if he fought there.

After all, it was a domain for Ascendants and above; he wouldn’t have dared to go there without the perfect path of space.

His choice was intended to prevent Su Ping from seeing his trump cards, and to slay his opponent while taking advantage of that deep space.

“What a petty man…”

Su Ping raised his brows and shook his head as he watched Shuai Qianhou disappear. He looked at the other two opponents and thought for a moment. He then said, “Let’s have a chat.”

“Achat?”

The proposal stunned them; the two glanced at each other, unsure of Su Ping’s intentions.

“Tm tired from the previous battle. Let me take a rest,” said Su Ping.

The two men: “??”

Tired?

Do you even look tired?

Besides, if the battle were truly exhausting, why didn’t you merge with your pets?

You’re not even using your pets. It’s obvious that you’re not trying your best!

The two of them grumbled, but what Su Ping said was exactly what they wanted; their purpose was to hold Su Ping back until the red-robed young man finished with his battle.

“Alright, let’s chat.” One of them accepted the invitation, only to find that Su Ping was picking his ears, obviously not interested in talking to him.

You proposed a chat, and now you’re not interested in talking?

Su Ping gazed into the void and thought for a moment, before he said to the two guys, “Why don’t you wait here while I get some oranges?”

‘They were stunned again.

Get… some oranges?

“Never mind; you might not be obedient. I should just finish you off and then ‘help’ him,” Su Ping mumbled to himself.

He didn’t want to miss the opportunity of observing Shuai Qianhou’s combat ability and trump cards.

Their faces quickly showed anger after hearing what Su Ping said.

Is he messing with us? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Or is he simply a psycho?

He first wanted to talk, then get oranges, and then finish usoff. What exactly does he want?

“Die!”

Both resorted to action because of anger, going all out; they even thought they had been tricked.

Su Ping gathered fiery blades of laws in his hand. He moved with Sun Chaser and Void Walker, disappearing like a ghost; nobody was able to detect him. The law-based protection didn’t find Su Ping, either. But very soon, one of them changed his expression.

“Right…”

Hardly had he uttered a word when Su Ping appeared. Or rather, his burning sharp blades appeared.

‘The man roared in fury and shock upon seeing the sharp blades; his body expanded, and battle tattoos appeared on his body. His shadow flashed towards the blades.

The intangible shadow collided with the fiery blades, producing deafening noises.

Su Ping was slightly surprised. It was quite a unique path, as it would be perfect in assassinations.

Seizing the opportunity, the man quickly swallowed a pill and injected a purple potion into his arm. His astral power surged crazily, as if it were boiling.

Although the improvement wasn’t very significant for him anymore, every bit of additional power increased his chance to survive at the moment.

But all hope was quickly dispelled.

Su Ping charged again.

He went after the young man who had turned into a half beast, cutting him without mercy.

Many laws collapsed in front of the edge.

The young man roared and activated his small world, which was extremely solid. It crashed into Su Ping like a brilliant star.

All the power of his laws was gathered on the surface of the small world. An infinite amount of faith power was bursting out of the small world.

But then, Su Ping’s fiery blade cut into the small world.

“No way…”

‘The young man’s eyes almost exploded. His small world had condensed all his laws and was unimaginably powerful; how could it not resist Su Ping’s strike?

Very soon, he felt that his laws were collapsing and crumbling. He was devastated by the aura of an unusual yet familiar law.

It was the supreme law of chaos!

Everything was reduced to chaos and nothingness!

His perfect path of shadow was dissolved too. All the laws collapsed and all order was broken.

There was an explosion, and his small world exploded.

Su Ping had grasped a perfect supreme path; he was as different from Su Ping as he was from a normal Star Lord.

Allhis body bled once his small world exploded, making his face look extremely ghastly. Then, his head exploded all of a sudden.

Everything came to an end in the blink of an eye. Su Ping executed him and immediately went after the other person.

“Don’t come any closer!”

The other young man was pale, as he didn’t have the courage to fight; he turned tail and fled.

However, Su Ping quickly caught up to him using the Sun Chaser technique.

‘The young man knew many secret techniques and was quite agile. However, he was eclipsed in every aspect. It was a slaughter.

After a boom, he was slashed and burned.

Two unparalleled Star Lords who had grasped perfect paths perished in an instant.

‘The Star Lords who had made a run for it were hoping to check the result, but their hearts started pounding upon seeing the appalling scenario. The desperate ones simply ran to the distance, waiting to be freed from that slaughterhouse after the trial ended.

“Is this what Mr. Su is truly capable of?”

“That’s terrifying!”

Loulan Lin and the others were shocked and speechless.

Loulan Feng wore a conflicted expression. He felt regretful; had he been friendlier when Loulan Feng introduced him to Su Ping, he might have had a chance to learn a thing or two from him.

Thaven’t even mastered the four supreme laws yet. As for the perfect paths that are ona higher level… We’re still too far away from the peak.

All of them were thinking the same.

Yu Jingze and the others had the same feeling.

They had always considered themselves to be at the apex of the Star Lord pyramid. They had just realized that they were actually at the bottom.

Once all the geniuses of the universe gathered, the real geniuses would come to light.

Diaz, of all people, had the deepest feelings. He had participated in the contest with Su Ping; it had only been a few years since then, but the gap between them was devastating.

He always considered himself a genius, believing that he would surely become a celebrity with the Reincarnation Divine Constitution.

He finally realized that he was just a lucky, yet mediocre person.

Su Ping entered the deeper spaces while they wallowed in troubling feelings.

He arrived in the sixth space, but didn’t see any traces of battle. However, there were auras of Shuai Qianhou’s laws nearby, which seemed to be left over from the battle with the brawny man.

They’re in the seventh space? Su Ping frowned.

It was indeed possible for Shuai Qianhou to stay in the seventh space with his perfect path of space.

He wasn’t an Ascendant, but he was capable of doing what those in the Ascendant State could. That made him a genius!

Su Ping considered for a moment, but then immediately broke the void with the law of chaos. He stepped into the seventh space.

At the same time, he hid the laws of illusion and origin inside of his body in case of any danger.

Fortunately, he had been to the seventh space in cultivation sites a long time before. He would die all the time, but he visited it now and then. So, he wasn’t a stranger to the place.

Roar!

‘The vague whispers next to his ears became clearer the moment Su Ping stepped in. He fell into a trance-like state as he saw giants and beasts roaring in front of him.

They were extremely vivid.

Acomplex power of laws was gathered in his eyes; Su Ping observed the scene with the eyes of origin and the illusions were soon gone. He felt that the nearby space was shaking, which was a telltale of a fight.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, noticing it was in fact Shuai Qianhou and the red-robed young man.

Their battle was rather weird; the laws around them were in disarray. What surprised him was that the red-robed young man seemed to have mastered the path of time to perfection.

Shuai Qianhou, on the other hand, was shrouded by many spaces. There was also the aura of the law of destruction… He was also in possession of a perfect supreme law!

The red-robed young man’s actions gave Su Ping an idea.. Is he trying to travel to another time?
