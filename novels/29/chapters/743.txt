Chapter 744: Ten Dragons In the Sky

“I’m going back. Are you going to continue hunting?”

Su Ping was ready to leave.

They looked at each other speechlessly, not entirely recovered from the shock of the previous experience. They would’ve been doomed if Su Ping hadn’t helped in time.

They would be much safer if they chose to return with Su Ping.

“Well, Senior Su, you just said that the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons will be sold in your shop... How about you sell them to us right now?” proposed Benson.

Since Su Ping had said that they would be put for sale, it would be better to buy the dragons immediately to increase Karina’s combat abilities.

The other three looked at Su Ping, with hopeful, glittering eyes.

Harry quickly said, “Senior Su, how much would they go for? Just set a price.”

Su Ping had shown enough power to convince them that he couldn’t be an Ocean State warrior. So, they had begun to regard him as a senior even though he looked young.

Su Ping shook his head and said, “Those wild beasts’ aptitudes are too mediocre. I have to train them first before I sell them.”

“Well...”

The others were astounded.

These dragons have mediocre aptitudes?

But you’ve just caught them. How could you tell?

Besides, the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were popular pets; every one of them could be sold easily on the market. The talented ones among them had distinguished themselves in some of the major contests!

“Well...” Harry was going to say that he was fine with mediocrity, but then Benson dropped a hint to dissuade him.

Harry suddenly realized what was going on once he saw Benson’s eyes.

What Su Ping had said was obviously an excuse. Those wild dragons hadn’t been appraised yet; how good they were was still to be seen. They had to be examined first, so they could be sold at the most appropriate price... To put it simply, Su Ping wanted to give them a brush up before he sold them.

That was also what most pet shops did.

Harry soon got it and no longer pursued the matter.

“We’ll continue our journey and see if we can catch any lone Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons. We have to earn the ticket fee anyway,” said Benson to Su Ping with a smile.

“Sure.”

Su Ping decided to stop chatting at that point. He wouldn’t mind guarding them on the way if they chose to go back with him, but if they still wanted to try their luck, so be it.

Su Ping sent a telepathic message to the Fate State dragon, asking it to keep the three younger dragons in check, before he flew while riding the Inferno Dragon in the lead.

The hunting group watched as he left; all of them had conflicted expressions.

Karina kept her eyes on Su Ping’s departing figure while she said to Benson,”Cousin Benson, should we keep looking? Maybe we should just pay for one.”

The main reason for them to be there was to find a suitable Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon for her. She would be overwhelmed by guilt if anything happened to them on the trip. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Benson withdrew his gaze and took a deep breath, before he said, “Although the beast is going to be available in that guy’s shop, we don’t have a lot of money; we should save it whenever we can. He just said that the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons might have intentionally exposed themselves in order to lure us into their trap. I think it’s true...

“This means that many more dragons are probably hiding in the forest and setting many traps to protect their females and offspring.

“I think we can look around in the area and try to catch a stray beast when other planet pioneers are hunting! A billion would be saved if we can catch one. The money we save will serve for your expenses in the genius-filled Hugh Mia Academy. Our family is not as rich as others; let’s use money wisely!”

After hearing that, Karina bit her lips and said, “Cousin Benson, I’ll try my best to become the best in my grade. I’ll do my best!”

Benson looked at her, with tenderness showing on his chiseled face. He said, “Silly. You cannot achieve everything with hard work. Resources are sometimes hundreds of times more useful than effort... Money is just as important!”

Harry and Annalisa looked at each other and stopped wavering. They said to Karina, “Yes, Karina, just listen to Cousin Benson! You’ll be at least a Fate State expert when you graduate, if not a Star State one!

“You will be the most brilliant star in our family by then. Everybody will be so proud of you!”

Karina bit her lips as she looked at them, choosing to stay silent.

Noticing her heavy mood, Benson rubbed her head and chuckled. “Relax. We can always buy one in Senior Su’s shop if we can’t catch any. I don’t think he’ll rip us off, and even if he does, it won’t matter. We can think of it as repaying a favor!”

Karina nodded and said, “Okay.”

...

Su Ping was rushing over to the base while Benson and the others resumed their hunting.

The Little Skeleton is several thousand kilometers in the east. Are those people hunting there? While sitting on the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder, Su Ping sensed the presence of the Little Skeleton, even though it was rather distant from where he was.

However, it wouldn’t take too long if he really wanted to go there.

Su Ping wasn’t intending on going, though. He hadn’t detected much in terms of feelings and fluctuations through the contract’s bond. There hadn’t been any danger thus far.

The Star State dragon king had been wounded, soon deciding to escape. It was probably focusing on healing at the moment.

There was nothing in that place that could threaten the Little Skeleton’s life, as long as the dragon king didn’t show up.

As he thought about that, Su Ping went straight to the air bases to arrange his departure.

...

There were four bases in the Rumbling Thunder Continent set up for departures. The four had been set in the four cardinal directions.

Many planet pioneers were gathered in the eastern base. All of them had made the trip to catch Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons.

“What’s the hurry? It’s not the peak of the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons’ mating period yet. You have to wait for two more days!”

“You’ll only get killed if you go out right now. The male Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons are all on patrol right now. Don’t fight until the females of their kind are giving birth.”

“Stop talking, and just let idiots be killed already. They’re just rookies who don’t know the rules of this place.”

The base was quite crowded; frictions and conflicts among the explorers were inevitable.

“Look, the Golden Flag Dragon Hunters! They caught two more Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons! Boy, they’ve earned several billion with this haul!”

Everybody at the base was exclaiming when a five-men squad returned. They rode three flying pets and were being followed by two Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons.

The two dragons were in chains, pulled by the warriors and unable to resist.

The chains had been specifically designed to capture their kind. They could lock the dragons’ spirit and energy, thus preventing them from using their skills.

“Tsk, tsk. Two of them are Void State beasts; I can’t tell how strong they are. They must be at least in the advanced phase of the Void State!” All the explorers were amazed by the dragons.

Each of those beasts was worth at least two billion!

The price would be doubled if their parameters indicated that they were excellent wild pets!

Someone, however, remarked in disdain, “The Golden Flag Dragon Hunters are experienced people who hunt in this continent all year long. They are also supervised by a Fate State expert. Doesn’t that make it easy to hunt Void State dragons?”

Such a result was only an appetizer to the Golden Flag Dragon Hunters. It wasn’t really surprising.

“Look, someone else is back!”

“Wow, is it a group of beasts?”

“So-So many...”

All of a sudden, exclamations were heard all over the base.

Something which appeared to be a cloud was approaching them from high in the sky; underneath the cloud were ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons; they were so massive that they looked like a floating mountain range!

It was a splendid sight to see the ten dragons flying in parallel!

“Huh?”

The old man who led the Golden Flag Dragon Hunters heard the exclamations and turned around, frowning. His pupils contracted when he saw the number of dragons approaching.

Thanks to his ample experience he could easily tell from their sizes that at least three of them were at the Fate State!

Plus, one of them was so enormous that its wings could almost shadow half of the base. It was undoubtedly an advanced Fate State dragon!

“Are those dragons at the Fate State?”

“Could it be a beast attack? It seems unlikely; they never come here. Look, that’s a human...”

“Which dragon hunter managed to catch that many Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons in one go? And none of them is chained...”

The Golden Flag Dragon Hunters were completely astounded.

I’m finally back.

Su Ping looked at the base and calculated the time while standing on the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder. It had taken him two hours to return, mainly because taming the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons that he had come across on the way back had delayed him.

“There are a lot of humans here. Just be obedient and don’t cause trouble,” said Su Ping to the ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons, mainly to the advanced Fate State dragon.

That particular dragon opened its mouth and spoke in an old and bitter voice, “My lord, we won’t cause any trouble. We only hope you can find a good master for us...”

They had already given up the moment Su Ping caught them.

Why didn’t they resist?

Su Ping could have killed them instantly with his horrifying strength. They would have died even before they could put up a fight. They would never dare to fight back, at all.
