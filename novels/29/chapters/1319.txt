Chapter 1320 Return of the Lightning Rat (1)

Su Ping was surprised by the crowd. His store was like the central hall of the Celestial Court at the moment; nobody dared to cause trouble there.

Su Ping spread out his senses and soon noticed the source of the riot. The crowd was dispersing because of fear. There was a short and fat figure crawling quickly on the ground.

It wasn’t a human being, but a… mouse.

“Lightning Rat?”

Su Ping was surprised to see the Lightning Rat. He didn’t expect to see it again.

He remembered it had been waiting outside his store until it met another girl who took it away. It was very likely her pet now.

He quickly noticed thick blood matting the rat’s purple fur, giving off a strong odor. His heart became heavy and a dreadful thought occurred to him.

The rodent dashed to the store’s opening and disturbing the crowd.

“Whose pet is this? How dare you cause trouble here?” A Star Lord customer stepped up, about to capture the Lightning Rat.

But then Tang Ruyan recognized the Lightning Rat too. She quickly said, “Don’t touch it!” Slightly dazed, the customer could only stop reluctantly. That was Su Ping’s territory; he was only trying to make a good impression by helping capture the little rascal. But since Tang Ruyan, Su Ping’s employee, took action, the pet was probably related to the store.

“Lazy mouse, why are you back?”

Tang Ruyan walked to the Lightning Rat in surprise.

......

The Lightning Rat didn’t stop. Right when they were close, it suddenly flashed past her and entered the store.

The Lightning Rat looked around in the store and found Su Ping who was gazing back at it.

The man and the mouse stared at each other.

Instantly, bloody tears seemed to be rising in the rat’s tiny purple eyes. It suddenly lunged at Su Ping

He simply stared, opening his arms as the purple colored bolt rushed at him.

The smooth fur had turned dry and rough. Some parts had made braids of sorts with the caked blood. However, he gently stroked the creature and cleaned the blood stains.

The Lightning Rat was shivering. Su Ping didn’t feel fear, but grief. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

His heart became heavy as he could somehow guess the situation. It wasn’t his pet, but it once belonged to his first customer, and was the very first pet he trained.

Inside the store—the customers looked at the lowly rat in surprise. Su Ping seemed rather intimate as he dealt with that pet; however, they could all tell that the rat’s bloodline was mediocre, and could only rise to the Star State at best.

The average strength of the customers in Su Ping’s store had significantly improved with time; they were generally between the Star State and the Star Lord State. Most customers below the Star State had sold their turns to those elites for a good price. Su Ping didn’t do anything about it since they were mutually consenting deals.

The Lightning Rat gradually calmed down after being caressed for a moment. The next moment, purple light gathered on its body; it craned its head while held close to Su Ping’s chest. After that, a purple bolt of lightning was concentrated on its forehead, which was its soul; it was voluntarily offering its soul and trying to make a contract with Su Ping.

Su Ping paused for a moment and stared at the creature in the eye. A moment later, Su Ping released his soul power and established a pet contract.

From that day onward, the Lightning Rat would be Su Ping’s pet.

Once the contract was signed, Su Ping’s speculation was confirmed.

“Why?”

Su Ping communicated telepathically and tried to figure out what the Lightning Rat was thinking.

Very soon, a picture popped up in Su Ping’s head. It seemed to be some sort of desolate planet, but it was already a battlefield. Lots of missiles and other hot weapons had been deployed on plains and hills. Many bombs were exploding in the distance. The smoke left by the flying missiles had marked the sky like claw marks.

Countless humans were charging with their pets against swarms of worms.

Su Ping could easily recognize them: they were Void Bugs. Most were green, and some were silver colored.

On the battlefield, there was a figure who was close yet extremely vague, as if blurred on purpose. All the other people and items nearby were clear, except for that slim figure.

His expression changed a bit, knowing it was very likely the Lightning Rat’s memory.

The fuzzy figure seemed to be the girl who had recently adopted the little rat.

The pet returned without the signs of a contract. Either it had been abandoned by the girl, or the girl died. Those scenes made the second alternative the most likely.

Su Ping was silent.

The Lightning Rat’s first master—the girl named Su Yanying—had died in the war on the Blue Planet.

Its second master had just sacrificed herself in another war.

Once the master died, the contract would break and all memories related to the pet’s master would be erased.

The Lightning Rat had waited quietly outside the store, not knowing whom it was waiting for. Finally, a second girl appeared and became its master. However, their lives went permanently in different directions again!
