Chapter 1387: Unknown Universe (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping didn’t release all the people residing in his small universe; only part of the population. The rest stayed inside. He had also built planets in his small universe to accommodate them.

Su Ping divided his attention when the job was mostly done. He went to the test room to observe the Celestials practice while he continued with building planets and settling residents in his small universe.

He entered the room and saw the scene he had expected.

Noises were echoing in the test room, which was like a boundless, independent universe. Joanna and Xu Kong were fighting fiercely at the moment. Their beautiful figures continued flashing in a dazzling manner.

The other Celestials were either standing or sitting nearby; they either had bitter or troubled faces. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Su Ping looked at the Celestials who were resting; all of them reeked of blood, although their wounds had already been healed. Their armor too was damaged; they had obviously gone through harsh battles.

“How did it go? Did anyone win?” asked Su Ping.

Shen Huang and the others turned their heads with twitching lips.

“Brother Su, this goddess is terrifying. Where did you find her?” Chi Huo couldn’t help but ask, but he immediately realized that the question was too personal. He awkwardly changed the subject. “All of them have failed. She’s also a Celestial, why is she so much stronger than us?”

Su Ping smiled casually. “She’s a goddess; her bloodline is better than yours. It’s normal that you can’t beat her that easily.”

Everybody smiled bitterly, as facts had spoken. However, they were truly reluctant; who would readily admit to having an inferior bloodline?

The battle ended while they spoke. Joanna suddenly made a piercing motion with her spear, all kinds of Dao Patterns appearing. Xu Kong simply revealed her constitution, making it impossible for anyone to lock onto her. However, the Great Dao accompanying the spear simply tore her body to pieces.

“Your reaction is too slow and your skills are crude. You need more practice,” said Joanna after withdrawing her spear.

......

Xu Kong blushed and slightly changed her expression. However, having been defeated, she could only admit that her opponent was right. She could also tell that the goddess had yet to use her real power; after all, she had already fused with her pet and borrowed its power. Except for the forbidden trump cards, she had used all means possible, but she couldn’t even touch Joanna’s body.

“The gap is too huge.”

The other Celestials sighed. Their difference in power was obvious. They finally understood why Su Ping was so confident in her.

After Xu Kong left the battlefield, Shen Huang stepped and said, “Please enlighten me.”

“Of course,” replied Joanna.

They soon started to fight intensely.

Shen Huang was becoming increasingly familiar with the universe of time and space. He hopped between dimensions nonstop; however, Joanna had a deep understanding of time and space, soon locking onto him. Her first attack forced him to show up, and her second attack split his body in half. Battle over.

Everybody was speechless, seeing how fast Shen Huang had been defeated. He had been among the strongest ever since he recovered his Celestial cultivation.

“When controlling your universe, you shouldn’t just draw power from it; you must imagine yourself as part of the universe,” Joanna commented as usual, “You can imagine that the small universe is your core and body, and that your own self is but a part of the small universe.”

“Huh?”

Shen Huang was befuddled by the insight. He felt that Joanna’s words were unusual, opening a new world for him.

The Celestials also took those words in and found a new understanding.

The battle continued soon after.

Half an hour later, all the Celestials were resting against the test room wall, some breathing heavily. They were a total mess compared to how fancy they looked when they first entered the room.

While resting, one of the Celestial State cultivators couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Su, is this goddess… your wife?”

All of them were currently in awe of Joanna and were curious about her. Why would such a strong goddess be willing to do simple and even menial jobs in Su Ping’s store? The only reason they could think of was that the two of them were intimate.

Joanna slightly changed her expression and glanced at the guy, then she looked at Su Ping.

“As I said earlier, she’s an employee of this store. Right now, she’s also the temporary boss when I’m away,” said Su Ping.

“Just an employee?” asked the Celestial State cultivator, not willing to let it go.

Su Ping was rather speechless about that Celestial cultivator who was apparently a sucker for gossip. Before he answered, another voice erupted. “Of course. We are all his employees; what else can we be?”

It was Tang Ruyan who interjected, while looking angrily at the prattling Celestial. She had just realized what was going on, but she didn’t feel too sad about leaving her universe; instead, she was more upset about the stupid things uttered by that reckless Celestial. If the store were in business, she would have already kicked him out for violating order inside the store.

“Huh?”

The gossipy Celestial was surprised to see Tang Ruyan, and even more surprised to see she was neither nervous nor respectful; however, he could only roll with it since that was Su Ping’s territory. He asked, “How did Mr. Su meet this goddess? Has she been staying in your store because she owes you a favor?”

“It’s a long story…” Su Ping slightly shook his head, unwilling to talk too much about himself and Joanna. “If you still have some strength left, you should practice more with Anna. You have Celestial cultivation, yet you haven’t fought much and lack battle experience in your realm. This is a good opportunity.”

The Celestial could only nod in disappointment and hold back his desire for gossip.

“Celestial level pets can also be trained here. You can come to me if you have any,” said Su Ping, “It may require some money, but it’ll quickly make your overall strength grow.”

Everyone had been told about the peculiar bits about Su Ping’s store. They knew it was very likely one of the store’s rules, so they didn’t ask.

“Xiao Su, are you going to help us train our pets?” There was worry in Shen Huang’s eyes. “Isn’t it too tiresome for you?”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “No. However, you must pay close attention to the Realm of Heavens while I’m gone; don’t let the Heavens find us. Pay close attention to find other universes as you move. I’ll leave my pets behind to move the store.”

“Thank you very much, Mr. Su.”

“We couldn’t have escaped without you, Mr. Su. We haven’t even thanked you yet.”

All the Celestials looked at Su Ping in a friendly way. Two of them still held grudges, but they also smiled at him. It was clear that they were planning to let bygones be bygones.

Su Ping had also let go of any grudges. After all, they had been fighting side by side, so he chose to forgive them.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, Su Ping’s eyes glittered; he quickly went to the lobby.

“A universe?”

Everybody else sensed it too. They were definitely surprised, not expecting to find a new universe that quickly!

The barrier of a universe could be vaguely seen in the void outside the store. Said barrier was clearer than the one protecting their own universe, so it was easier to detect.

Su Ping instantly controlled his store to stop and observe it carefully. He discovered that it was truly an unknown universe.

“Should we go in?” Chi Huo looked at Su Ping.

Su Ping stared at the place solemnly and nodded. “Yes, but quietly; let’s see what’s inside first.”

The others also became wary. They could get entangled in bloody battles if there were ferocious beasts in that universe.

Su Ping immediately pushed his store to approach it. Then, he subtly released the power of chaos and tore the barrier open.
