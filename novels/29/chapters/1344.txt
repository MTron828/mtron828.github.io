Chapter 1345 Pinnacle (1)

The scorching figure flapped wings that blocked the sky. Flames covered the wings, as if ready to melt the entire world.

“The Fire God’s projection? Wait, it’s a projection of another being!”

“He’s visualizing the power of fire. Has he reached the eighth stage of the Heavenly Fire Technique already?”.

Everybody looked at the brilliant, scorching figure in astonishment. That was a symbol of the Heavenly Fire Technique’ eighth stage. However, the projection invoked for Su Ping was slightly different from theirs. “Huh?”

The Red Dome Realm master slightly changed her expression. Given her expertise, she easily realized what level Su Ping had reached. It was indeed the technique’s eighth stage; however, Su Ping activated a projection from his own bloodline, which had overridden the projection of the Fire God. There could only be two possibilities

Either his bloodline’s projection was more powerful than the Fire God of her clan.

– Or… Su Ping’s bloodline was so pure that the projection of his bloodline exceeded the technique’s.

Judging by the appearance… Is it an ancient Golden Crow?

The realm master narrowed her eyes solemnly. If that was the Golden Crows’ bloodline from the age of chaos, the first possibility was more likely.

The Fire God of her clan was a mythical creature from the age of chaos too, but it couldn’t compare to the Golden Crows.

After all, they had once preyed on Fire Phoenixes and stars.

The Golden Crows’ bloodline… No wonder he’s reached the eighth stage of the Heavenly Fire Technique so quickly. The realm master calmed down. She wasn’t surprised to find that Su Ping had such a powerful bloodline. She didn’t think he could have achieved everything with nothing but his human bloodline.

In the crowd—the crimson-haired girl looked at the projection behind Su Ping’s back. She mumbled with shock in her eyes, “It’s… a Golden Crow!”

......

She narrowed her eyes. Su Ping had just acquired the Heavenly Fire Technique and he already reached her level; it was understandable with the Golden Crow’s bloodline.

Exactly at that moment, the scorching Golden Crow unleashed brilliant flames and became increasingly substantial. Feathers were gathering in the flames, and its eyes and claws were becoming clearer. It was like the arrival of a real Golden Crow.

In addition, Su Ping’s hair turned red. Patterns of the great Dao appeared on his skin, releasing a terrifying aura. The temperature around him was rising rapidly and everybody avoided the waves of heat in

fear.

“I feel like my body is on fire!” “Hurry! Hurry and dodge!”

“Move back! Move back now!”

The crowd was panicking. The heat generated by Su Ping was too terrifying. It was almost burning the place to the ground.

Those are… the Divine Patterns of Fire!

The realm master looked at Su Ping with shock in her eyes. She knew he was strong, but she didn’t expect him to be so unbelievable. That was the sign of the Heavenly Fire Technique’s eleventh stage! The crimson-haired girl also changed her expression in shock. “The eleventh stage!”

On the other hand, the young man who was the realm master’s disciple already had a contorted face, eyes wide.

It was the first time he had experienced the lofty status of a Dao Child from the Heaven Path Institute.

No wonder it’s even more remarkable to become a Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute than to rise in the Chaos Talents Rank!

What kind of genius is he?

“Huh?”

Su Ping, who was taking the test at the moment, examined the finger in the rocks. He discovered that—even though the finger was rotting, it seemed to be recovering as it absorbed his power of fire.

The flesh in the finger was healing slowly!

Once the finger healed a bit more, the surrounding laws became disordered, as if panicking. The result was that, when his law of fire was invoked, it simply manifested as the Golden Crow.

If this goes on, wouldn’t this finger heal completely in the end?

What will happen by then?

Su Ping was secretly shocked. He suddenly felt the test wasn’t so simple.

Considering his output, the finger would recover completely if it absorbed energy for a thousand years.

It’s impossible that the realm master didn’t see the change take place. Is she doing this on purpose? If so, what’s the purpose of her clan? Where did this finger come from?

Su Ping thought of many possibilities, suddenly feeling that all the high-ranked clans contained a lot of secrets.

He tried concealing the power of fire and quietly transforming it into the power of darkness.

The power of darkness was hidden in the power of fire in the form of threads and injected into the finger. Su Ping examined it carefully, only to discover that the finger didn’t absorb it.

It only absorbs the power of fire? Is it because of the race of this finger’s owner?

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He tried changing the fire’s output power, only to discover that the intensity of absorption was changing accordingly. As expected, the finger was highly sensitive and responsive to the power of fire.

He thought of something and released a portion of the Heavenly Fire.

A scorching aura surged out in a flash, and the finger shivered ever so slightly. The surrounding laws became even more alert and fled.

Bang.

The Golden Crow behind Su Ping’s back landed on the square, making it tremble violently. The beast was no longer an illusory projection, but an existence of concrete energy.

It looked down at those present like a living Golden Crow.

An ancient aura of chaos was instantly spread out; the dominating aura of an ancient king enveloped them all.

“Manifestation of the Grand Dao…”

Back in the crowd, someone was so shocked that they actually moaned.

Almost everyone had their eyes peeled, almost forgetting how to breathe.

That was the ultimate symbol of the thirteenth stage, the highest level!

Su Ping had cultivated the Heavenly Fire Technique, which he just acquired, to the top?!

Not only did the scene dumbfounded both disciples and elders; the realm master was also shocked.

She knew that, as long as one’s expertise was profound enough, it wouldn’t take too long to grasp a cultivation technique.

Therefore, it was within her expectation when Su Ping showed the eighth and even the eleventh stage of the technique.

However, the thirteenth stage… That was only for God Emperors!

Only the God Kings of her clan, who were extremely talented and with pure bloodlines could do that. However, such figures were brilliant geniuses even in her clan; few of them had ever emerged.

And yet, Su Ping had just done it.

Is his understanding of Dao comparable to a God Emperor’s?

The realm master was suddenly awakened, as if a bucket of water had been poured over her head. Su Ping had surely tapped into the Original Dao World and could even condense a Dao Heart at any moment!

It was no surprise that he had dared to travel solo, unconcerned about the Rain Clan.

Having reached that level, it was impossible for the Rain Clan to track him down.

But he’s just become a Dao Child… The real master’s eyes glittered. She was both shocked and extremely delighted, since she had actually managed to rope in such a genius.

After having reached the Original Dao World, it was almost certain he would rise to become a God Emperor!

Such powerful beings were the top forces of every clan in that world.

It was barely possible to nurture a God Emperor every ten thousand years, even when investing all the clan’s resources.

The price she had paid was much less than it would cost to rope in a real God Emperor.

“The thirteenth stage…”

In the crowd again the crimson-haired girl gazed at the scene, feeling the scorching heat on her skin. That was like the third floor of the pit, if not worse.

Are all the Dao Children of the Heaven Path Institute like him?

She finally understood why those Dao Children were as famous as the seven greatest clans, among countless races on every vast continent, and why they were remembered and sung.

“Huh?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Su Ping slightly changed his expression as he faced the pillar. He sensed that the finger was clearly changing faster when he unleashed the Heavenly Fire; it seemed to be extremely sensitive to it. They were almost of the same origin.
