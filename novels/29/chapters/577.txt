Chapter 579 Heaven Killer

That peak was magnificent but there was a bend, like the number “7.”

No, it was more like... a finger!

A finger!

How unimaginably queer.

That peak was a broken finger?

The finger he had seen in that illusion?!

If that was the case, then how large would the creature have to be?! Su Ping was unable to make a sound.

He wouldn’t have thought about that possibility if it weren’t for the fact that he had seen quite a number of magnificent creatures in cultivation sites. In some of them, such as the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, he had encountered massive creatures whose corpses could turn into mountains.

This Dragon Tower is the finger of that person who called himself Heaven Killer?

That Heaven Killer must be above the Star Rank. Terrifying!

The Dragon Tower that the academy used to test its students is actually a broken finger!

Su Ping was more and more convinced that it was indeed a broken finger.

The evil creatures and insects he had seen inside were most likely things growing out of the decaying tissue.

Those insects feasted on the flesh and blood of the finger. No wonder their claws could be so sharp and their shells so hard.

“I wonder how long ago the Heaven Killer passed away. I saw the illusions and heard the shout. The finger must have recorded all of that...”

Su Ping was stunned. The finger was still there; the images and sound still worked after God knows when. He could not even begin to imagine how powerful that Heaven Killer had been.

“Joanna should know something about this. I can ask her,” Su Ping said to himself. Joanna’s original self was a just second to the Superior God in the Demigod Burial, but he wasn’t sure if the Superior God of the Demigod Burial was the same as the one of the Archean Divinity.

Either way, Joanna’s original self should be at, or above, the Star Rank.

Su Ping took one last look at the peak. That wasn’t the priority at the moment. It didn’t matter to him whether the peak was a finger or not. The top priority was to find Su Lingyue and the second to plug the hole on the peak.

Whoosh!

He flew toward the people standing in front of the Dragon Tower.

Some students with an acute sense of perception shouted, “Someone’s coming.”

The other students turned over.

All the students acted as if they had seen a ghost when they saw that it was Su Ping.

Many people even wondered if that was Su Ping’s twin.

They looked exactly alike!

“Mister Su?”

Han Yuxiang, although surprised, hurried over. “You were inside the Dragon Tower. How come...?”

“I came down from the top,” Su Ping said after he stood on the ground.

Fei Tianyi stared at Su Ping from a distance, clearly confused. He also heard Su Ping’s voice. Twins could look alike but they didn’t necessarily sound alike. That was scary!

The Dragon Tower had one opening that was known by all students and teachers.

People had seen how Su Ping entered the Dragon Tower. It was unreasonable to think that he had exited the place from the top!

“The top...”

Han Yuxiang raised his head. At the same time, he found himself feeling stupid, having bought Su Ping’s claim.

If he had descended straight from the top, it would mean that Su Ping had pierced through the Dragon Tower.

The Dragon Tower had 33 levels but it was just a rumor, never verified.

The highest level that anyone had ever reached was the 22nd level. The record had been set by one of the best students the academy had ever had.

No one else had gone past that.

After all, the tower had that strange age rule; not even legendary battle pet warriors could break that rule.

Legendary battle pet warriors had visited the academy in the past, but none of them had been able to break into the Dragon Tower.

Also, more than one legendary battle pet warrior had tried. That was why the academy had concluded that legendary battle pet warriors were unable to bypass the age limit! As for the rumor of 33 levels

They had measured the height from outside and calculated it according to the height of each level.

Han Yuxiang remembered that the student that reached the 22nd level had been known as the Fate Challenger of that time. He had killed legendary battle pet warriors and beast kings!

He began to wander around the Blue Planet. He later encountered the Good and Evil Heavenly King and died. Otherwise, he would have even become the king of legendary battle pet warriors, the master of the Tower! “Mr. Su, the Dragon Tower has but one opening. Were you... really inside?” Han Yuxiang had to ask. He had seen Su Ping on the top but he suspected that he had been there all along. The figure that had gone inside the tower had surely been some sort of illusion.

After all, the thought of Su Ping having gone past all levels of the Dragon Tower was even more far fetched!

Su Ping didn’t bother to explain.

“I don’t think you understand what the Dragon Tower is. Get your Principal here, I have to tell him something. Also, the boy who showed me the way in told me that my sister had left the Dragon Tower and went missing after that. Don’t you have surveillance cameras on campus?” “The Principal?”

Why?

Mo Fengping felt a bit scared. The Principal was the true brain of the academy. He was a legendary battle pet warrior, revered by all the students as well as the teachers.

Mo Fengping was not happy, seeing that Su Ping was mentioning the Principal in such a rude manner. No matter how powerful Su Ping was, he could not compare to a legendary battle pet warrior!

“What are you talking about?”

Fei Tianyi walked over with a cloudy face. “You don’t deserve to meet the Principal. I saw that you were able to enter the Dragon Tower, so I regard you as my peer. Hmm, I don’t know what trick you pulled... Either way, I can challenge you since you’re my peer!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Su Ping glared at him. “Challenge me? You’re not worthy.”

“Are you afraid?” Fei Tianyi narrowed his eyes.

A glint of coldness flashed past Su Ping’s eyes. Anyone who aimed killing intent at him would be courting death.

A person hurried over when he was about to do something; it was the young man who had led the way for Su Ping. The young man was stunned still when he saw Su Ping standing there.

“That, this...”

He could not understand.

He had just gone out from the Dragon Tower. If Su Ping were to exit, he should have been behind him. Why is he here?

Was Su Ping really inside?

The young man’s head was in a blank.

Han Yuxiang noticed the young man’s strange expression. The former grabbed the young man and pulled him over across space. “What are you doing? I told you to guide Mr. Su Ping. Where did you go?” The young man was still in a daze when Han Yuxiang’s question pulled him back to his senses. “Vice Principal, I was there with Mr. Su... Mr. Su chose the challenge. But, but I don’t know... Why is he here?”

“Nonsense! You said Mr. Su took the challenge. What about his record?” Han Yuxiang shouted.

The young man finally realized what he ought to do. He looked at Su Ping as if the latter were a monster while his lips trembled. “I, I have the record. It’s right here.”

He lifted the bronze book which carried the record. Han Yuxiang was confused. “What?” The young man jogged to reach the black tablet and place the bronze book in the opening. The black tablet was activated. A ray of golden light climbed up and soon reached first place.

Fei Tianyi’s name was in that location.

The golden light continued to rise. Another name was added. Fei Tianyi was ranked down to No.2.

A new name was atop Fei Yitian.

Su Ping.

Behind that name was the number 33. No one made a sound. The formerly chatty onlookers were completely silent.

Everyone was staring at that name and that number.

Astonishment froze on Fei Tianyi’s face.

Level 33?

Su Ping passed all the levels?!

This broke the record!

It seemed like a joke.

Han Yuxiang, Mo Fengping, and Xu Kuang were also dumbstruck.

Su Ping, on the other hand, didn’t care for it; he had never cared about any ranking. The point was to find Su Lingyue. To enter in their rankings meant nothing to him. He would be happier if he could make more money in his store.

“It was true...”

The young man was stunned speechless. The recording device was not broken! “I said, get your Principal here. Do it. I won’t be held responsible if something goes wrong,” Su Ping repeated grumpily, which pulled Han Yuxiang back to reality.

Su Ping was losing patience. He was anxious to find Su Lingyue, to begin with, but he had to deal with the hole first.

Han Yuxiang asked Su Ping again, “Mr. Su, did you really come out from the top?” “Do I get money from lying to you?”

“Well...”

Han Yuxiang didn’t know what to say. Money? That shouldn’t be a word said by you!

But Han Xiangyu didn’t dare to ask more questions though he was still stunned. He had suffered a blow when he had found out Su Ping’s age. He couldn’t even find a word to describe his feelings since he had verified that Su Ping had climbed to the 33rd level.

And yet, it didn’t seem so outrageous considering all the stories related to Su Ping.

Of course, that could not relieve Han Yuxiang of his confusion, at all.

How could someone below 24 years of age become like this?

Su Ping was not a talent, he was a monster!

He would be considered as one of the best, even in the Federation!

Han Yuxiang developed more reverence for Su Ping, who was going to leave the Blue Planet and roam the universe sooner or later!

Some talents passed away and some had left the Blue Planet to find a wider world where they could better develop. Han Yuxiang shook his head. “And why are you asking for the Principal?”

“You won’t understand. It is a big deal, that’s all I’ll say. It is a matter of life and death for all of your academy, and even the entire Subcontinent District.” Su Ping was getting bored. He didn’t sugarcoat anything.

Han Yuxiang realized that Su Ping was not joking, but that made the matter all the more baffling.

A matter of life and death for the entire Subcontinent District?

Su Ping came here to find his sister, right? Where did this come from?

He should have gone to the Principal right away.

While he couldn’t find an answer, Han Yuxiang did not badger Su Ping again since he was getting impatient. “The Principal is too elusive; I don’t know where he is. I will call him but I’m not sure...”

“Stop talking. Make the call.” “Of course.”

Han Yuxiang called the Principal at once.

Fei Tianyi finally came back to his senses. He looked at Su Ping but the latter didn’t see that. Su Ping was gazing at an indistinct place while he was thinking.

Fei Tianyi curled his lips. Even though he was the most talented student the academy had nurtured in the past century, the best of that year, he was being ignored!

“This guy...”

Fei Tianyi bit his teeth and clenched his fists.

He had never been ignored.

He had always been under the spotlight when he was with his family and when he was in school. He had always been in the lead!

Right then, he suddenly remembered the students who had tried to challenge him but he chose to ignore them.

Was he like that to this man?

Fei Tianyi felt even more humiliated and furious.

While Fei Tianyi was deep in his thoughts, the students were shocked by Su Ping’s big talk.

A matter of life and death for the academy and the Subcontinent District?

Yeah right. How could this guy know something so grave?

Some were thinking that Su Ping was bluffing and some were starting to believe what he had said.

“Yes, right, indeed, him...” Han Yuxiang seemed to be very respectful. He had set up a sound-proof seal around him. Soon, the call ended. He waited for the Principal to hang up first.

Han Yuxiang canceled the seal and told Su Ping, “Mr. Su, he’s on his way.”

Su Ping nodded. “You haven’t answered my question yet. My sister left the Dragon Tower. This isn’t the place where she was last seen. Can’t you find out where she went?”
