Chapter 375 Trash Talk? Exterminate!

Everyone looked over to where Zhou Tianlin was pointing

Given the place where they stood, those on the stage were unable to see where Zhou Tianlin was pointing. They had to step closer to the edge.

But those sitting near the stage had already seen it and it had stunned them into stillness.

Right by the edge where the seal emerged, there was a crack which was as wide as a hand. The crack was extended over a hundred meters along the edge of the seal!

Xu Kuang, Ye Longtian and all the others who walked to the edge of the stage could finally see it. They could only stare with eyes as open as they would go.

Zhao Wuji and Yin Fengxiao were gazing at the crack. The confident smile on Yin Fengxiao’s face vanished and surprise filled his eyes.

They had only paid attention to Su Ping’s punch and had ignored what had happened down there.

The crack was evidently a result of that punch.

The impact of the punch on the seal had torn the ground open!

No wonder Zhou Tianlin was sure that the seal was working fine.

Yin Fengxiao’s expressions changed again and again. Eventually, he took a deep breath and turned to face the young man. “It is outrageous to try posing as if your strength were at the sixth rank!”

Su Ping said nothing in reply.

He asked the titled battle pet warrior from the government, “The test is fine and the device is fine. Whether there’s something wrong with the seal is your business. I passed the test that she passed so I’m qualified. Do you need me to defeat an eighth-rank Cyborg Pet to prove myself?”

The government representative, unlike Yin Fengxiao and Zhou Wuji, didn’t regard Yan Bingyue as the priority. He had already noticed what happened by the edge. So, when Zhou Tianlin pointed to the crack, the man had understood what Zhou Tianlin was saying.

The man forced a bitter smile. “That is not necessary. I trust that you would also pass that test...”

To have him fight a Cyborg Pet would be a complete waste. Given Su Ping’s strength, he could smash the Cyborg Pet into pieces with one punch!

In the distance, Zhao Wuji and Yin Fengxiao’s faces turned cloudy when they heard the man.

The test showed that Su Ping was at the sixth rank.

That was a fact.

Whether there were skills to fool the test device was irrelevant. Even if there were, they could not prove it. Besides, if Su Ping could use a secret skill to fool the device, so could Yan Bingyue. A question like that was pointless.

“Since the test is over, I can participate, right?”

Killing intent oozed out from Su Ping’s eyes and astral powers surged out from his body.

The titled battle pet warrior from the government could easily tell that Su Ping was dead set on fighting Yan Bingyue. He was about to talk Su Ping out of it when he heard Yin Fengxiao’s angry shout. “Lady Yan is resigning!”

Yan Bingyue seemed to disagree but she darted another look at the crack. Just like seeing a viper, she flinched back, and eventually gave a silent consent.

ca

Yin Fengxiao’s words came as a surprise to everyone.

The extremely arrogant Yan Bingyue was choosing to give up without putting up a fight?!

People stared at her, only to see her lowering her head. Although they were unable to see her face, they understood she had approved Yin Fengxiao’s claim by default.

For a moment, many people wore weird expressions.

But some people were sure that Yan Bingyue was doing the right thing. They could not tell what other ace cards Yan Bingyue had but the young man was a monster and did have strength close to the titled rank. Not even an average titled battle pet warrior would have been able to defeat him.

e

With such strength, the young man had the potential to yield unusually brilliant results on the international stage and even win the global championship!

“Resign?”

That word made Su Ping bristle with rage. They thought they could get away so easily?

“You’re talented and brave. I’ll give you that!” Yin Fengxiao said. He looked awful ever since he admitted defeat on Yan Bingyue’s behalf. “I will never forget what happened today!” He gave Su Ping a meaningful stare.

Zhao Wuji was also glaring at Su Ping coldly. Yan Bingyue had never suffered this type of humiliation, driven to admit defeat in public... Not even in that place!

Never forget?

Su Ping turned his gaze to Yin Fengxiao. And then Zhao Wuji.

Suddenly, a smile blossomed on Su Ping’s face.

“I heard that your background is powerful. Is that so?”

Yin Fengxiao raised his eyebrows. “I don’t think you would know.”

Since they had already given up, Yin Fengxiao was no longer in the mood to terrorize Su Ping with their background. It would only be a low move.

Zhao Wuji sneered as well, holding Su Ping in contempt. Their background was not only powerful. It was scary. Even some average titled battle pet warriors would turn pale in fright upon hearing that name! Su Ping smiled first and then his shoulders began to tremble as he burst into loud laughter.

Everyone was surprised as they stared at him because of the sudden burst of laughter. Xu Kuang and Qin Shaotian were staring at him open-mouthed. The loud laugh came to a sudden stop and Su Ping announced in an emotionless voice, “Your background is powerful, so... go to hell!”

The air began to tremble behind him. Two swirls appeared.

Roar!!! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A raging dragon’s roar came out from the pitch-dark swirl and echoed in the venue. Even the sky above the ceiling was shaking!

That was a dragon’s roar that no one had heard before!

The roar spoke of the dragon’s killing intent and rage! A fierce flame swept out of the whirlpool. The air was boiling like water, and the temperature had risen sharply before the dragon appeared.

A hideous dragon’s head covered in red scales stuck out from the swirl and then the dragon’s towering body climbed out!

The Inferno Dragon!

The pungent, crimson hellfire entangled the dragon as if it had just stepped out from hell.

That was a shocking scene.

In the recent days, all the people from the Longjiang Base City had heard about this Inferno Dragon and there were small videos of the battle pet going viral on the internet. This was the dragon that stayed outside the Pixie Pet Store!

The one and only Inferno Dragon from the Longjiang Base City!!

The dragon belonged to this young man?!

Both Yin Fengxiao and Zhao Wuji were taken aback.

One of the three most powerful dragons? They had seen one before but they never thought they could see one there!

Besides, what did the young man mean by saying those words?!

Was he going to fight them? Was he going to end them in public?!

Did he lose his mind? First of all, those from the government would not sit around and let that happen. Second, say he could kill them. But, could he kill all the other eyewitnesses?

Yin Fengxiao and Zhao Wuji were not alone in their astonishment. The three titled battle pet warriors of the government were also staring at Su Ping, astounded.

They knew that Su Ping had killing intent but not that he would actually put that into practice! Everyone at the venue was shocked into stillness!

There were too many people there. Should Yin Fengxiao and his party encounter an unexpected misfortune, the information would definitely get out. Was Su Ping not afraid that the force they belonged to would retaliate?

“That one...”

Zhou Tianlin, as well as Zhou Tianguang, were not staring at the Inferno Dragon, which had caught everyone’s attention. Instead, they were gazing at the tiny swirl.

From that swirl, a completely mundane and small figure climbed out. That figure was half a human’s height; it didn’t exhibit an overwhelming power. However, Zhou Tianln and Zhou Tianguang were terrified, as if they had seen a ghost.

Only they knew that the skeleton was the truly dreadful pet!

“Is he trying... to take their lives?” “But...”

The family heads of the Ye and Mu families gawked at this. Was the man nuts? How insane this was!

Yan Bingyue was from that place but he was thinking about taking their lives. Did he decide to go all the way since he had displeased them?!

Qin Duhuang never imagined that Su Ping would be this crazy, either. Yet soon, he recalled a piece of information he heard from the government. A glow rose in his eyes all of a sudden.

Qin Duhuang felt he could see a faint trace of his youth in the young man.
