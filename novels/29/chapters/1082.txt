Chapter 1083: The Eleventh

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“The trial is about to begin. You can stay in my place until tomorrow in case anything happens,” said Ji Xueqing.

“In case anything happens?”

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

“Indeed. Even though the Celestial Court is the safest place, there might still be people who are bold and reckless. After all, you’re the greatest hope Master has to win the legacy.”

“Shuai Qianhou has joined us too. Although I would have never known until just now, the other Celestials are probably already aware of his participation.

Ji Xueqing said, “Both of you are core seeds. If either if you don’t make it, our star zone’s chance of winning the legacy will be reduced by half. We can’t be too careful.”

Su Ping nodded.

The real game was usually played in a place off the table.

Led by Ji Xueqing, Su Ping went to the divine mountain where she cultivated.

The place was five times bigger than Su Ping’s divine mountain. The astral power found there was also abundant. Su Ping felt he was absorbing astral power just by breathing.

“Master will also give you a new divine mountain when you reach the Ascendant State,” said Ji Xueqing and chuckled. “But I hope you can simply win the legacy and rise to the Celestial State!”

“I’ll try,” Su Ping said.

You’ll try?

She was lost for words, seeing how calm Su Ping was. She thought that Su Ping was overly calm.

Trying was not enough; he had to try his best, even at the cost of his life!

The opportunity was too rare that even such a proud genius as Shuai Qianhou was unable to resist its temptation. Many old Star Lords who were no longer interested in competing on the Divine Lord Rank had sided with Celestials and gotten tickets for the game.

Everybody was competing!

Those geniuses were actually confident of becoming Heavenly Lords, but none of them were certain they could reach the Celestial State!

Even the strongest Heavenly Lord had to bend before Celestial State experts. It was said that the Celestial State experts couldn’t beat them, but that was only because the Celestial State experts didn’t want to pay too much.

If a Celestial State expert was willing to do anything, they could kill any Heavenly Lord!

“Is there anything I can do for you? Feel free to tell me,” said Ji Xueqing quickly after taking Su Ping to the cultivation field.

She could not teach him ambition anyway, and she could only try and give Su Ping more trump cards.

“Senior sister, you’ve taught me two secret techniques. That’s enough,” replied Su Ping.

Ji Xueqing felt rather helpless. “I would have prepared more, had I known you were such a fast learner.”

“That’s all right. I have my own preparations,” Su Ping comforted her.

Ji Xueqing was rendered speechless. Without further ado, she said, “Just cultivate. Tell me if you need anything. I won’t disturb you anymore. I recommend that you take a good rest on this final day.”

“That’s exactly what I plan to do.” Su Ping nodded.

Su Ping set up a barrier and began to examine himself after his senior sister left.

He hadn’t examined himself thoroughly just yet, ever since he left the cultivation site. He had no idea how strong he was exactly!

Even though I’ve grasped the perfect path of chaos, I cannot be too proud!

Our new junior brother also grasped a perfect path while in the Star State. He’s cultivated for 50,000 years since then. He’s probably grasped all necessary paths perfectly…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered; that was quite a terrifying thing.

Fifty thousand years was truly a long time.

If it were him, he could have soared and risen to the upper limits in fifty thousand years.

Of course, it was more possible that he would have broken the limits and reached the Ascendant State, if not the Celestial State.

My junior brother really kept a low profile…?Su Ping had mixed feelings.

After shaking his head, he stopped thinking about it. Shuai Qianhou’s arrival reminded him that there were probably a lot of other old genius Star Lords who had been hiding for a long time.

The law of origin…

A strange law-based energy glittered on Su Ping’s fingertip. Then, a pink flower slowly blossomed, right on his fingertip.

Flesh and blood was being developed inside the flower, as if it were a strange living creature.

He had created a living creature out of nothing!

Master must have created lives and accumulated faith power with a similar method. It’s possible to do that with nothing but the perfect path of chaos. The world is born from chaos. Chaos means life; it’s the closest power to the origin…

Su Ping hid the law of origin in the Illusory World. Even though he had grasped the law of origin and could establish a third world with it, he didn’t have the time.

Besides, a tremendous amount of energy was required to establish a third world.

The eighth Astral Painting can be condensed too. I only need more time and energy…

?Su Ping’s eyes glittered hopefully. He wondered how strong he would become when he established a third small world and cultivated the eighth Astral Painting!

Su Ping then remembered the system’s ranking.

He quickly summoned the rank in his heart.

He quickly saw that his name had soared to eleventh, straight from the 182nd! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He was very close to the top ten!

The system said that he would be rewarded if he made it to the top ten!

I’m only the eleventh. I thought I would be among the top five, or at the very top!?Su Ping was both delighted and astonished at his ranking. After all, he had grasped multiple perfect paths, including the path of chaos; his combat ability had indeed soared. Even though he had yet to establish a third small world, he was still very strong.

Nevertheless, he had only managed to rank eleventh on his current level, considering all recorded history?

And the ranking was only among human beings?

Indeed, I can’t be arrogant. There are too many geniuses. There are a lot of things I need to do…?Su Ping heaved a sigh. Every time he became excited about his progress, the system would calm him down.

He found it hard to imagine how the top ten guys had grown up.

“I’ve only reached this extent even with the help of the system. How can there be ten more people who are better than me? Did they have a system too?” Su Ping mumbled.

He turned off the ranking list, then he began to study “Void Walker,” the skill he learned from Heather.

He would probably be so fast that his own soul would be unable to catch up if he used Void Walker and Sun Chaser together.

…

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

The trial began.

The Celestial Court’s sky was quite lively while it was still early in the morning. Many spaceships were floating, and many people were flying around.

The Celestial Court’s residents noticed the unusual atmosphere too. Those who were well-informed had learned about something, but the media had been banned from publicizing anything.

While everyone was curious, Su Ping went to the temple in Ji Xueqing’s company.

Diaz and all the others arrived. Shuai Qianhou had also shown up with an Ascendant State expert.

Once she saw her senior brother, Ji Xueqing immediately called out to him, “Second senior brother.”

“Second senior brother?” Su Ping noticed the title as he looked at the man.

The Ascendant expert looked quite cold; he carried a similar aura to Shuai Qianhou’s. He put on a smile when he heard Ji Xueqing’s greeting; he nodded at her and glanced at Su Ping. Then, his gaze trailed off.

Ji Xueqing had told Su Ping that the early disciples of their master were mostly Heavenly Lords already.

Their second senior brother was clearly a Heavenly Lord too.

A lot of people dashed over and gathered at the square below the stairs as soon as they arrived. All of them were accompanied by Ascendants, who represented powerful organizations of the universe.

All of them had pulled strings and gotten tickets to the trial.

Once everyone was present, Su Ping discovered that there were almost forty thousand participants in total.

He saw that few carried the emblems of the Divine Dome Academy, and one of the girls was the one he had encountered on the street previously. She had a really cold attitude.

Apart from them, Su Ping also saw members of the Loulan family.
