Chapter 1348 Polishing (1)

“This is the ninth floor of the underground

pit.”

While standing in front, the master of the Red Dome Realm explained, “The Fire God Palace was established over the natural crater of the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire. Nine barriers were set up here to stop the Heavenly Fire from melting this continent.

“Each of the barriers act as a buffer, blocking the Heavenly Fire’s power a little bit. Now, they work also as cultivation places for the Fire God Palace disciples. But most of them can only reach the fifth floor at most.”

Su Ping was looking intently at the white flames. Before him was a vast world, which seemed to be boundless. It was obviously in a special time and space.

There was a gigantic hole that looked like an abyss ahead of him. Inside the hole, scorching white flames were burning bright. They were so unimaginably hot that even stars would have melted. It was none other than the Heavenly Fire.

Su Ping saw golden fiery patterns surfacing on the Red Dome’s realm master. It was some sort of law similar to the Heavenly Fire Technique. She was able to resist the heat and remain calm through the fiery patterns.

“Who’s over there?”

Su Ping had just noticed that two people were sitting next to the hole, cross-legged. Their auras suggested that they were God Emperors.

...

The realm master was slightly surprised that Su Ping was resisting the heat with nothing but his body. The Dao Child seemed to be even more terrifying than she expected. “You mean them? They’re here to fetch Heavenly Fire. The gray-robed one is an artifact master from the Tan Clan; he’s forged seven God Emperor weapons, and all of them are powerful. He’s here to forge an eighth weapon with Heavenly Fire.”

The realm master said, “The purple-robed one is a pill master from the Yao Clan. He’s here to refine medicine with the fire.

“There used to be a man who polished his body with Heavenly Fire about two hundred years before you came. He accomplished his goal and left a while ago.”

Su Ping was rather astonished, but he found it understandable when he remembered the purposes of the Heavenly Fire.

“In other words, you have a lot of connections, realm master. A lot of people must owe you favors,” said Su Ping.

The latter chuckled and said, “The Yan Clan is the only clan in this world that has Heavenly Fire. Aside from the deterrence of our Ancestral God, it’s all thanks to our operations and connections. We can’t be too greedy, and there are indeed people who owe us favors, including people from the Rain Clan. Unfortunately the favors aren’t big enough for us to speak on your behalf.”

Su Ping understood her implications and didn’t comment on it. He said, “I’d like to borrow some Heavenly Fire and cultivate here for a while.”

“You’re being too polite, Dao Child. You can fetch as much Heavenly Fire as you want,” said the realm master with a smile.

“Okay.”

Without further ado, Su Ping flew right towards the pit of Heavenly Fire.

“Dao Child, what are you doing?” shouted the realm master, noticing that he went straight toward the Heavenly Fire.

Su Ping turned back and said, “Cultivating.”

“Cultivating…” She lost her cool for a moment, seemingly at a loss. “You’ll probably get hurt if you get too close. This Heavenly Fire burns everything; I can fetch you some flames if you want to polish your body.”

Su Ping waved his hand and said, “That won’t be necessary. I’ll just stay by the edge.”

Then, he directly set foot in the Heavenly Fire.

“Well…”

The realm master was dumbfounded. He entered the Heavenly Fire just like that?

She knew that Su Ping wanted to polish his body, but that was not a proper method!

Even the barbarian who polished his body with Heavenly Fire earlier on had barely dared to attract some of the flames with an artifact to cleanse and fortify his body.

He certainly wasn’t as daring as Su Ping, who jumped right into the fiery pit…

The Heavenly Fire found in the pit suddenly changed and became restless. While the realm master was still thinking whether to act or not, Su Ping had gathered all his power and allowed the fire to enter his body through his pores. Using the Original Divine Fire Technique taught by the Crows’ Chief Elder, he controlled the Heavenly Fire and soaked his body in it.

Meanwhile, he opened the chaos universe in his body and allowed the fire in. He refined his universe while polishing his body.

“Huh?”

The realm master was dumbfounded yet again. Her eyes widened in disbelief.

She could tell that Su Ping was controlling the Heavenly Fire with some sort of secret technique.

What shocked her was that the fire around Su Ping was clearly being controlled in a subtle manner. Instead of burning and hurting him, it was actually refining his body!

He is actually able to cultivate right in the source of Heavenly Fire!

“What kind of skill is that, to actually manipulate Heavenly Fire?” The Yan Clan was best at controlling fire; the master of the Red Dome Realm was a genius of her clan, but she had never learned a comparable skill. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She couldn’t help but remember the Golden Crows’ bloodline in Su Ping’s body. Is it an ancient technique passed down through bloodlines?

If it was passed down, it has to be a skill from the age of chaos. It’s said that there were many Ancestral Gods in that age, and that it was easy for mythical creatures to contemplate and cultivate. Because of this, countless techniques were invented and perfected. It was the most glorious and powerful era…

The realm master changed her expression. It was quite possible that a powerful skill from that brilliant era had resurfaced.
