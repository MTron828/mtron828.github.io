Chapter 51: Fractures in Space

“An unclaimed territory?”

Su Ping remained surprised for a moment.

On this blue planet, other than the base cities that humans resided in, almost all the areas were considered wilderness and over 500 such unclaimed territories were scattered across the planet.

Such unclaimed territories were unsuitable habitats for humans.

Two reasons led to the existence of such unclaimed territories. The first reason was the damages done to the earth, caused by human wars in the past. Hazardous materials and technology remnants polluted the lands, making them uninhabitable. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The other reason was that many space fractures would appear in areas that were deemed unstable.

The space fractures were twisted cracks that usually led to many mysterious and unknown places.

Some places were strange pieces of land hovering amid the stars and ferocious beasts could be found there.

Some were death stars that could not even be found on the Federation’s interstellar map. On those stars, there were no traces of plants or animals.

Some cracks would lead to a fixed star just like the sun which could destroy people as soon as they set their foot in!

In those unknown, mysterious places lived many doughty Astral Pets. Most Astral Pets on this blue planet were originally from those unknown hidden worlds.

Space fractures worked as portals that led to those lands.

Generally speaking, defensive fortresses would be built in the perilous lands where space fractures existed, with federal armies stationed there in case the untamed, wild pets and beasts in those unclaimed territories would sneak into the base cities where humans lived in; otherwise a massive slaughter would ensue.

When unclaimed territories were found, the federal government would designate detachments for “mopping-up” operations in the unclaimed territories to keep them stable.

The staff members working for such detachments were all known as explorers.

Being an explorer was an incredibly dangerous occupation but at the same time, the pay was tremendous!

Explorers lived in the base cities and they enjoyed many benefits. Every month, they could collect generous subsidies and rewards; in some special cases, they were entitled to use their power to seek privileges.

The best way for the general public to obtain wealth and position was to join an explorers’ team. Even an average explorer would enjoy a higher status than military personnel. If the explorer could make contributions, the explorer would have an even higher position in society. Even the mayor would have to receive such an explorer with good manners.

“Yes.”

Su Ping was hesitating. Fan Yujing hurried to explain, “Sir, given your strength, don’t you think you’re overqualified to run a store here? Our explorer team is in dire need of master-hands like yours. If you can join us, you can name the rewards you want. I believe the money made from the exploration will be over a hundred times more than what you make now!”

Su Ping cleared his mind. He flatly declined, “Sorry, but I’m not interested.”

“Exploring the unclaimed territories?

“No, thanks. Why would I go to a dangerous place like the unclaimed territories to risk my life when I can simply lie here and make money in comfort?”

If he died, his life would be gone for good.

What was the unclaimed territories’s main feature? There was no protection whatsoever!

If by any sh*t luck they encountered monsters as strong as beast kings, he would have delivered himself to doom for nothing.

This was not the answer Fu Yujing had on his mind.

He had never assumed that Su Ping would turn the offer down so readily.

Was it because Su Ping was not in want of money?

Well, considering how Su Ping broke his arm, Fan Yujing did not think it would be hard for Su Ping to make money.

Maybe, a master such as Su Ping only craved for missions of a challenging nature.

Fan Yujing thought about it and added, “Recently, some things seem to be happening in the unclaimed territories outside the explorer’s base of our Longjiang Base City. There are many extra middle-level or advanced pets. I think this can be a good training opportunity. Are you interested?”

“...”

Su Ping looked at Fan Yujing as if the latter was a fool.

“Why would you persuade me to go when such dangers were lurking about?

“What’s your brain’s damage?

“Training?

“F*ck the training!”

Su Ping replied, “There are two words I want to say.”

“Yes?” Fan Yujing’s eyes glowed. He wondered if the two words were “I am.”

Su Ping kept a straight face as he uttered the words, “Piss off.”

Fan Yujing was taken aback.

Fan Xiaoyu, who was standing next to Fan Yujing, said angrily, “Why are you insulting him?”

Su Ping answered indifferently, “I suggest you take a look at my goods. You are welcome to leave if you don’t want anything else.”

Looking at Su Ping’s calm expression, Fan Yujing produced a forced smile. Neither money nor the prospect of a challenge could appeal to Su Ping. Fan Yujing felt his effort to rope Su Ping in had failed.

Fan Yujing heaved a sigh before he confessed in a bitter tone, “Actually, I’m only here to invite you because I have no other options. Last night, a new space fracture appeared in the unclaimed territory outside the Longjiang Base City.

“Our team headed there to explore. However, since we’re not familiar with the environment, two of our teammates were injured by accident. To make things worse, one of them lost a pet in the excursion. So, we have to hurry back as soon as possible to find his pet.

“But, since both teammates are injured, we cannot find anyone to take their places at the moment. That’s when I thought of you, sir. I thought you would be intrigued...”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows but offered no other reaction.

He had nothing to do with this matter. He didn’t need to meddle.

Sympathetic?

He was a little bit sympathetic but that was all.

Besides, he wasn’t sympathetic to their team, but to the pet that was lost in the space fracture.

Su Ping’s eyebrows knitted tighter as he thought about how lonely the pet would be at the moment. The team could make money when they explored an unclaimed territory. But they had acted greedily when their abilities were not enough. The pet was innocent.

“I’m sorry but there’s nothing I can do,” Su Ping voiced his refusal again, pulling a long face.

Fan Yujing was disappointed but he said nothing more.

Fan Xiaoyu darted a look at Su Ping. She, too, did not say anything. She was well aware of how dangerous exploring an unclaimed territory could be. It was only natural that Su Ping was unwilling.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations. The host has triggered a side quest: look for a lost pet.”

“Completed quest reward: one Magic Forging Skill book.”

“Failed quest punishment: 10 points will be deducted from the host’s score.”

The system’s prompt messages suddenly popped up in his mind.

That startled Su Ping.

What did he do to trigger a side quest?

Su Ping couldn’t help but shout out in his mind, “System, are you serious? Think about my abilities. Aren’t you asking me to send myself to doom by making me help them find their lost pet?”

The system sounded detached, “As an owner of a pet store, the host shall not ignore anything related to pets. Please finish the quest as soon as possible.”

“Are you being serious...”

Su Ping could not win an argument with the system. Inside, he almost burst into tears of rage.

He was merely a loser with a combat strength of 3.5. What was the difference between sacrificing his life and exploring an unclaimed territory?

He wanted to give up on the quest directly.

That being said.

He began to hesitate as he thought of the punishment for failure.

He would be erased when his score dropped below the passing line.

“This damn system has been rating me this entire time!”

Also, the reward seemed to be appealing...

The internal struggle went on for a long time. Finally, Su Ping made up his mind and questioned Fan Yujing, “Tell me about the world inside that space fracture first. Another thing I need to know is the kind of pet you lost in there.”

Fan Yujing was surprised by this question. His eyes began to shine as he asked happily, “Sir, are you willing to join our team?”

Su Ping wore a solemn look. “Answer my question first.”
