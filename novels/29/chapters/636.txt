Chapter 639 Second Trip to the Deep Caves

“Who’s there?”

Suddenly, a man shot up to the sky and flew toward Su Ping from a small building nearby. “Who are you?”

That was a man with a rigid look. The Inferno Dragon scared the man a bit.

“And who are you?” Su Ping asked.

“My title is Water Blade!” The middle-aged man gazed at Su Ping. “How dare you ride on your battle pet on campus? Three legendary battle pet warriors are discussing a critical matter here. You cannot afford to disturb them!”

“Hmm!”

Su Ping paid no attention to the man and told the Inferno Dragon to land on the building.

“Courting death!”

The middle-aged man was enraged. He unleashed astral powers and hopped to the Inferno Dragon, then he created a formation with one hand; a shield ten meters in diameter covered the building.

Bang! The shield broke as soon as it came into being.

The middle-aged man was startled. Two people suddenly arrived. One of them pushed down the middle-aged man by grabbing his shoulder and the other man stood in front of the Inferno Dragon. “Brother Su, please!”

The Inferno Dragon felt Su Ping’s intent and came to a stop, but purple lightning bolts were still flickering in its eyes as it stared at the man.

“How have you been, Principal?” Su Ping asked.

Yun Wanli looked into the Inferno Dragon’s eyes and felt his heart skip a beat. It had not been long since their last encounter, and yet Su Ping’s dragon was even more horrifying than the last time he had seen it.

“Brother Su, everything is well.” Yun Wanli smiled fawningly.

He didn’t have the courage to assume any great airs in front of Su Ping, not after he witnessed Su Ping’s combat strength in the Deep Caves. “Brother Yun, this is...?”

The old man standing with the middle-aged man gazed at Su Ping with a frown. The elder was able to tell that the person standing on the Inferno Dragon was at the titled rank, but he was still feeling pressured. The Inferno Dragon seemed to be more vicious than the common beast kings.

“Sir.”

The fact that his teacher and Principal Yun Wanli were alerted scared the middle-aged man. He apologized at once. “I couldn’t stop him in time...”

“That is not your fault. This is Fate Challenger Su. We call him Fate Challenger but not even the legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State can defeat him. He is certainly the strongest Fate Challenger to ever appear on the Blue Planet. It is natural that you couldn’t stop him, and you should not stop him, either,” Yun Wanli said.

“Fate Challenger?”

The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes in fear. This young man here is a Fate Challenger?

A Fate Challenger equal to a Void State legendary battle pet warrior?!

He is even stronger than my teacher!

Even the old man standing next to the middle-aged man was visibly startled by the revelation.

“Are you the one who once disturbed the Tower but got away?” the old man asked. Yun Wanli forced a smile. “Yes, this is that Brother Su.”

The old man took a deep breath and cupped his fists. “I am Lü Xian. Mr. Su, I have heard so much about you, and I’m glad to have the chance to finally meet you. You are a stunning man.”

The middle-aged man began to panic, since his teacher was acting so respectfully. He immediately offered his apologies. “Sir, I am sorry. I was as blind as a bat. Please forgive me, sir.” He bowed to his waist and was afraid to look at Su Ping.

Whoosh!

Another man arrived. It was a young man in his late twenties. He darted Su Ping a quick glance. “Mr. Su, it is you. I’ve been wanting to meet you. I heard that you made the Otherworld Heavenly King leave. What a heroic deed that was.”

“You must be from the Tower,” Su Ping said with a straight face.

Lü Xian nodded. “The world is in chaos; we were assigned to help Brother Yun safeguard Longyang.”

It was clear that Su Ping didn’t think that was helpful enough. “I heard that the Nordic Continent is in crisis because of the Deep Caves. I also remember learning that the Deep Caves are connected globally. The formation underground must have failed; have you heard any news from below?”

“Not for now. Two legendary battle pet warriors have gone into the Deep Caves and they will inform us if they find any problems,” Yun Wanli answered.

“So, there are five legendary battle pet warriors here, including you.”

“Yes.”

“Are any of you at the Void State?”

“Well...” Yun Wanli looked at the two legendary battle pet warriors and smiled at Su Ping embarrassingly. “Brother Su, you may not know this, but it’s not easy to reach the Void State. There are only twelve legendary battle pet warriors in the Tower...”

“So the answer is no.” Su Ping frowned. He wanted to blurt out some things but stopped himself.

The five legendary battle pet warriors were a at the Ocean State, they couldn’t even compare to one at the Void State while working together. If something had gone wrong in the Deep Caves... He didn’t think the five would amount to much! During his last trip to the Deep Caves, he had encountered beasts like the Chained Ghost. It took some planning for the wild beasts to get out from the Deep Caves; that round of strikes was definitely uncommon.

“Still, I believe that the five of us are more than enough,” Lü Xian said with a smile, although he wasn’t smiling on the inside. Su Ping didn’t say it out loud, but he could tell that the Fate Challenger didn’t think highly of them.

Su Ping had been able to get out from the Tower unharmed, but that was only because the Tower hadn’t chosen to pursue him. Otherwise, no one would have gotten out from the Tower after that huge mess!

“He’s right. We can stop a large-scale strike,” the young legendary battle pet warrior added. Su Ping remained silent. Arguing with them was meaningless. “Where is Li Yuanfeng?” Su Ping asked Yun Wanli.

Yun Wanli didn’t expect that question. “Mr. Li has gone back to the Deep Caves. He said he wanted to go and help his brothers.”

Su Ping nodded. “Did he go to the Tower?” “Yes.”

“Good. I’m going to the Deep Caves then,” Su Ping said. Since Li Yuanfeng had visited the Tower, they would be aware of the situation down in the Deep Caves. It was not his problem anymore. “You’re going to the Deep Caves now?” Lü Xian cautioned Su Ping at once, “Brother Su, the situation inside the Deep Caves is not good. We don’t think you should go in!”

“Right.” The young legendary warrior frowned.

Neither approved of such a rash decision.

Yun Wanli tried to persuade Su Ping, “Brother Su, if you want to offer some help, I suggest you stay above ground. All the base cities need more people at the moment; after all, we have a limited number of legendary battle pet warriors. Not all base cities can receive the support of legendary battle pet warriors; some base cities only have beast king battle pets to help. If you stay here, you’ll be able to help more people!”

Su Ping understood that. “I have to go because my battle pet is still there.”

“Your battle pet?”

Finally, the three knew why Su Ping had made the trip over.

“Isn’t it too risky? Just to get your battle pet?” Lü Xian still disproved Su Ping’s choice.

He could always train another battle pet. His life was not replaceable if he died in the Deep Caves.

“Right.”

The young legendary battle pet warrior nodded. He also believed that Su Ping should give up his battle pet. After all, those beasts were intended to help and protect battle pet warriors.

Still, Yun Wanli didn’t advise against it. He had visited the Deep Caves with Su Ping and knew how attached Su Ping was to his battle pets.

“Enough said. Stay here and do your job,” Su Ping curtly said. The Inferno Dragon turned around and went toward the entrance to the Deep Caves.

“Hey...”

The three were surprised after seeing how determined Su Ping was, even though it didn’t sound right. It was as if the master of the Tower were talking to them.

“Brother Su, I’m coming with you,” Yun Wanli shouted.

He went after Su Ping at once.

Lü Xian and the young one stared as the two left.

Once Su Ping was gone, Lü Xian said to the middle-aged man, “You can stand up now. He is no longer here.”

The middle-aged man finally raised his head; his back was drenched in cold sweat. While his teacher was a legendary battle pet warrior, he would still be in trouble if he ever offended another.

“It is fortunate that the guy is merely at the titled rank. If he were at the legendary rank, I don’t think you and I would stand a chance if we were attacked by him!” Lü Xian narrowed his eyes.

The young legendary battle pet warrior was surprised. “Are you... serious?”

We wouldn’t stand a chance?

Su Ping-if he were at the legendary rankwas able to defeat them instantly?

The young legendary battle pet warrior didn’t believe that!

Lü Xian said coldly, “Didn’t you see the dragon that Su Ping was riding? That vigor and look in the dragon’s eyes. I have no doubt that the dragon would have crushed me if it had not stopped in time.”

The middle-aged man turned pale.

His teacher had said so. He would have died if his teacher hadn’t protected him!

That dragon... is scary. The young legendary battle pet warrior looked worried as he thought of Su Ping’s dragon. “The most powerful Fate Challenger of all times. When he reaches the legendary rank, he may become someone like our Tower master...” Lü Xian lowered his voice.

The young legendary battle pet warrior said nothing in reply.

At entrance No. 7 to the Deep Caves on campus.

There were more guards than usual.

Six of the guards were at the titled rank. Four of them were standing by the entrance and two were hiding in corners in the distance. The latter pair were there to relay information in case that the guards by the entrance were killed by wild beasts bursting out from the Deep Caves.

“Sir...”

The guards bowed to Yun Wanli. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I’m going in,” Yuan Wanli said. He flew into the entrance to show Su Ping the way.

Su Ping had put away the Inferno Dragon; it could enter the cave but there wasn’t enough room for the beast to move about at will.

Su Ping and Yuan Wanli flew onward.

Su Ping was so fast that Yuan Wanli realized he had to exert full strength to catch up with him.

Su Ping wasn’t using any teleportation; it was already difficult for him to keep up with Su Ping as it was!

Su Ping could easily get rid of him if he decided to use teleportation! Still... Su Ping was just at the titled rank! Yun Wanli complained about Su Ping inwardly. Soon, they had reached the deepest parts. They arrived at the first strategic pass; suddenly, two people dashed out from the sides and a beast king of the stone family crawled out.

“Brother Yun?”

The two were about to stop the people breaking in when, to their surprise, they saw that it was Yun Wanli.

“Brother Su, I cannot go beyond this point,” Yun Wanli said to Su Ping.

Su Ping nodded. “I can manage.” “Brother Yun, this is?”

A middle-aged titled battle pet warrior approached them and sized up Su Ping in confusion.

A legendary battle pet warrior in his fifties, who was wearing a golden armor, gazed at Su Ping.

Su Ping looked familiar.

Suddenly, he remembered that it was the young man who had killed legendary battle pet warriors in the Tower, in broad daylight!

The legendary battle pet warrior shuddered with fear by the sudden remembrance.
