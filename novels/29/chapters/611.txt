Chapter 612: Angel of Purgatory

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Sir, please accept the greetings of your unworthy descendants!”

The title-ranked old man approached Li Yuanfeng and dropped to his knees.

The others followed suit; the ladies told their children to repeat the gesture.

The two kids stared at Li Yuanfeng with their watery eyes, curious and full of respect. So, this is the admirable legendary battle pet warrior that their parents always speak of...

Li Yuanfeng raised his hand to let everyone stand up.

“I am sorry to learn that you’ve suffered in the past years,” he said.

He felt he could barely look at the old man who was smiling through his wrinkles; he felt laden with guilt.

The old man at the titled rank said, “Sir, that’s all right. We are just thrilled that you’re safe and sound. All the waiting and everything we did was well worth it, now that you’re standing here before us. The Li family will rise again under your leadership!”

Li Yuanfeng nodded but said nothing else.

Many titled battle pet warriors arrived not long after.

The onlookers who belonged to the Han family were shuddering in fear. The higher-ups in the family, whom they would usually not get to meet, were actually coming in droves. The elders were there; even the family head was there!

Whoosh!

A stern faced, mature man wearing an elegant robe showed up; he was a solemn looking man. Behind him were over a dozen titled battle pet warriors who enjoyed a high status in the Han family.

They answered the call, arriving as soon as they were able to since the order had been issued by Senior Feng himself.

They had learned about the severity of that matter from him.

A legendary battle pet warrior is here!

And he is a member of the Li family, the very family they had been oppressing for generations!

The first thought that popped into the family head’s mind was to run away, but he immediately gave up on that idea. A legendary battle pet warrior was right there. Where could he run?

A legendary battle pet warrior would have the means and the power to search for him all across the globe. Then there was the Tower; they were able to gather information from every corner of the world!

That was why no one would eagerly enrage a legendary battle pet warrior!

You upset one and you upset all of them!

“My name is Han Tiancheng, head of the Han family. Nice to meet you, sir!” Han Tiancheng descended from the sky a dozen meters away. He hurried over and bowed to his waist.

He held his breathing and his heart was racing.

He didn’t know in what mood the legendary battle pet warrior was in or anything about his personality. But if that person were to be cruel and short-tempered, then he would never get a chance to speak!

Han Tianchen had readied himself for death on his way over; but that was a normal occurrence, since everyone would normally become afraid in front of death.

And yet, there was no way to run for him.

For the future of the Han family, he was the least able to run!

Fortunately, he had already initiated the seed program for their family. He hid all their promising seedlings. There would still be hope for the Han family, as long as they could survive through that crisis!

That was the plan that any major family would have.

“You’re the family head?” Li Yuanfeng narrowed his eyes to hide his killing intent. He could tell that the family head was at the peak of titled rank; he was someone with a long life ahead of him. He had greater potential than Senior Feng. That family head could further grow to reach the legendary rank in the future!

“I’m humbled to say that I am.” Han Tiancheng lowered his head. He was afraid to look into Li Yuanfeng’s eyes.

“From today onwards, the Han family will be our dependent family. You will be our servants and we will be the masters. All the members of the Han family must treat the members of the Li family like your parents, and you shall bow to us with the utmost respect. You shall never disobey any orders of the Li family!”

Li Yuanfeng asked Han Tiancheng, “Do you accept the terms?”

Han Tiancheng was drenched in cold sweat. He lowered his head and was only able to see the floor in front of his feet; he bit his teeth feeling awfully humiliated.

Servants?

Treat the members of the Li family like parents?

That is not acceptable!

He wanted to clench his fingers but was afraid that Li Yuanfeng would see that.

He was a proud man but he was also smart enough; the Han family would be entirely wiped out if he fought back!

He didn’t have the right to negotiate, not to mention throwing a temper, when he was talking to a legendary battle pet warrior.

The Li family people once had to beg to carry on with their lives; but then the tables turned over. The Li family was the commander.

That was just how the world worked.

That was the law of the jungle!

“I... accept them!” Han Tiancheng said. Saying those three words had taken up all of his strength. The elders of the Han family became frustrated. They were dying to speak up so they bit their lips; they had to bury their anger.

At that moment, they could tell how the Li family members must have felt before.

“Sir...”

The Han family members stared in disbelief.

Their family head had accepted the terms. So, we would have to follow the Li family’s orders from that day on?!

A moment before they were the elites from the largest family in the Dark Claw Base City. One moment later, they became the captives. It was hardly acceptable.

“Father...”

Han Yuqian gazed at her father, Han Tiancheng. He had always been a proud man for as far as she could remember; no one would have dared to argue with him. But at the moment, Han Tiancheng was a vulnerable duckling; he didn’t have the courage to say no to Li Yuanfeng!

That was the power of a legendary battle pet warrior!

Legendary battle pet warrior!

Han Yuqian clenched her fists. She had dreamed of reaching that rank, but later she was dying for that breakthrough. She wished she could become a legendary battle pet warrior right that second!

...

Li Yuanfeng cast an indifferent glance at Han Tiancheng. It wasn’t surprising to see Han Tiancheng accept those terms. Han Tiancheng making an appearance meant he was ready to compromise, or else he would have run away.

“You will take over the Han family from today on,” Li Yuanfeng said to the title-ranked old man.

The old man no longer hunched his back. Finally, he was able to stand up straight after all those years of humiliation. The Han family’s elders—who had at some point acted in an excessively condescending manner—were all lowering their heads and holding their breaths. The old man had been unable to cover up a smile. He had never felt so liberated! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

And yet, the smile gradually changed into tears. They had suffered too much and for too long, just for that day!

“Yes, sir!” the old man said.

Li Yuanfeng nodded. He opened a swirl and a slim figure flew out from the other side. It had four wings and resembled an angel, but its face was strange; it had four, white eyes but no eyebrows. It also had a white nose and dark lips.

“This is Angel of Purgatory, my battle pet, and it will stay here. If the people of the Han family don’t follow your orders, my battle pet will help you punish and discipline them!” Li Yuanfeng said.

The titled old man stared at the battle pet hovering above Li Yuanfeng’s head.

Han Tiancheng and the rest of the onlookers were frightened by that seemingly overpowering Angel of Purgatory, which seemed to be overpowering. It has to be a beast king!

“Sir, are you leaving us?” the titled battle pet warrior asked Li Yuanfeng. He indeed felt as if the latter was actually leaving them.

Li Yuanfeng nodded. “I’ll have to go to the Tower and ask them about some things. I also have some things I need to do.”

“Sir, do you have to go away so soon?” the titled old man continued asking. He wished to speak more but stopped on second thought. He didn’t want Li Yuanfeng to leave.

Even though the beast king was present, the old man felt he was still nervous.

Besides, they couldn’t count on the Tower as far as they were concerned. That was a place that existed in name only!

They had indeed reached out to the Tower. They did make contact but the Tower never gave them a reply!

They finally gave up after repeated failures.

Truth be told, contacting the Tower would expose them.

“There are things that I have to do,” Li Yuanfeng said. He looked at Su Ping; the latter knew what Li Yuanfeng was referring to.

Li Yuanfeng was angry because of what had become of the Li family. But he was a battle pet warrior who had stayed in the Deep Caves for eight hundred years. He was exceptional in controlling his mood; he would have died in Deep Caves a long time before if he were to lose his mind easily.

Too many friends had died in front of him during the eight hundred years.

What happened to the Li family had been unfair and he hated the Tower because of this. However, the things that happened to the Deep Caves were part of a greater concern for the entire world. He was unable to simply turn a blind eye to that.

“Sir...”

Li Jinsong also wanted to persuade Li Yuanfeng to stay.

On the other hand, Han Tiancheng was relieved. If Li Yuanfeng would have stayed there over the centuries and ruled the Han family with an iron fist, the Hans would end up suffering casualties.

Things would be easier for them if just one battle pet remained.

“Brother Li...”

Su Ping immediately understood what Li Yuanfeng was thinking and felt touched by the implications. His older brother was a great man, able to think about humankind even after his family had been wronged.

Su Ping was filled with deep esteem for the man. “Brother Li, I will also provide some help to your Li family, if you insist on going to the Tower. Once I get back to my store, I’ll send a temporary employee in my store to help you out. That employee was raised in a major family and she surely knows about ruling a family.”

The onlookers shifted their attention from Li Yuanfeng to Su Ping.

Brother Li?

That was unexpected.

This guy dares to call Li Yuanfeng “Brother Li”!

Li Yuanfeng, the legendary battle pet warrior! Was Su Ping also a legendary battle pet warrior? the onlookers wondered. It was frightening to have two legendary battle pet warriors in the same place!

Han Tiancheng also heard Su Ping’s words and his mind was weighed down; he attempted gauging Su Ping but was unable to tell which rank he was at. Even so, Han Tiancheng was convinced that Su Ping was at the legendary rank!

“Sir, you are?” Han Tiancheng asked.

Su Ping cast a glance at him from the corner of his eye. “You don’t have the right to know.”

Han Tiancheng felt embarrassed.

Li Yuanfeng nodded to Su Ping. “Good, I would still be worried if they were left here alone. I cannot waste any more time getting to the Tower. Brother Su, thank you.”

“Consider it done.” Su Ping nodded.

Li Yuanfeng waved his hand and the Angel of Purgatory flew down. The battle pet was roughly eight meters long; it bowed down so that Li Yuanfeng could talk to it.

“Master, what is your request?” said the pet with respect. Its voice was gentle and clear, a mix between the sound of a spring and a girl’s voice.

The talking battle pet stunned everyone again.

Han Tiancheng turned pale. He knew that some beast kings were able to speak the human language, but that was also an indication of their intelligence; that Angel of Purgatory had a high enough intellect as well.

All of a sudden, Han Tiancheng understood why Li Yuanfeng had decided to leave one of his battle pets.

An intelligent beast king could be regarded as a human being.

Li Yuanfeng relayed his orders to the battle pet and patted its head. “Tell my battle pet if anything happens. You will deal with all the Han family matters while Brother Su’s help arrives. You’ll have to get used to that as well,” he said to the old man.

The titled old man looked at the Angel of Purgatory with reverence and nodded. “Understood, sir.”

The old man stole a glance at Su Ping who appeared to be a young man; the former was convinced that the guy was also a senior legendary battle pet warrior, like Li Yuanfeng!

Li Yuanfeng nodded. With a frown, he shouted at the Han family’s onlookers, “Get down on your knees, now!”

The onlookers struggled, but they eventually complied.

First the elders got down on their knees and the others could only follow suit. Sadness covered their faces; they knew that as of that moment, their past life of luxury was over.

“I will trust this place to you now. Brother Su, let’s go,” Li Yuanfeng said.

Su Ping nodded.

As Li Yuanfeng, Su Ping and Su Lingyue left, the others watched on as they made to leave.

Han Yuqian suddenly noticed the girl who had been walking behind Su Ping and Li Yuanfeng. She blinked in disbelief.

She had paid a visit to the Valiant Academy a while back, to see her old teachers and look around to see if there were promising young students whom the Han family could recruit.

She had seen Su Lingyue back then.

What is she doing here?

Han Yuqian could not figure that out.

The three people left the building and flew away.

“Why didn’t you kill some of them to vent your anger?” Su Ping asked Li Yuanfeng.

Li Yuanfeng burst out laughing and replied, “I’m not that heartless. Brother Su, you have to become aware of the violence bottled within you. You might get into some trouble when you go through your Heaven’s Test in the future.”

Su Ping shrugged. “I actually hope that my Heaven’s Test can show me something different. Unfortunately, I don’t think there is anything to expect. I have seen it all.”

Li Yuanfeng forced a bitter smile. He couldn’t have witnessed a legendary battle pet warrior’s Heaven’s Test.

Li Yuanfeng changed the subject, “We will soon be arriving at the Valiant Academy, where the seventh entrance is located. I want to check the pathway there. Do you want to go?”

A glint of coldness rose in Su Ping’s eyes when he heard the name. “I won’t go there; I have other things to take care of.”

Li Yuanfeng realized that those matters couldn’t be good because of the killing intent in Su Ping’s eyes.

Su Lingyue bit her lips; she knew that Su Ping was talking about revenge.

She still didn’t know how to face Su Ping after all the troubles she had caused.

...

Valiant Academy.

Dragon Tower.

Many people were gathered there; all of them were staring at the black tablet.

“The 33rd level...”

“Is something happening to our eyes? Is there something wrong with the tablet?”

“Who is that Mr. Su?”

The onlookers wondered.

From among the crowd, three people stood the closest to the tablet. The girl gradually recovered from her astonishment and she murmured, “That Fei guy was right. The guy broke all the records and he went all the way to the top level... How did he do that?”
