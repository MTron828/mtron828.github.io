Chapter 1305 Wisdom of the Universe (2)

Su Ping seemed to have gained a vague inspiration.

“Huh?”

Chan Gong stared at him in a daze, noticing that Su Ping was deep in thought. Is it possible that Su Ping already felt something just because of my enlightenment? The idea baffled the mind. If that was the case, his talent was truly shocking.

He didn’t interrupt Su Ping, and simply waited in silence. A long time later—Su Ping came out of his meditative status and shook his head regretfully. “It didn’t work.”

Chan Gong was somehow relieved. If Su Ping figured out how to become a God Emperor just with a few words… Not only would he be a monster, but an incomprehensible existence.

He said, “There’s no need to rush into things. You have to be in the most natural state during your cultivation. If you’re too hasty, you might not become strong enough, even if you do advance to the God Emperor level. Universes are different, and so is their wisdom. I hope that you’ll find wisdom suitable and powerful enough for you.”

“Thank you for your advice, Elder Chan Gong.”

“Take these two Prime Chaos Fruits. Call me if you need anything,” said Chan Gong.

Su Ping thanked him again and ate the two fruits.

He soon detected that the two fruits melted and turned into some sort of power, which seeped into his universe of chaos and nurtured its components, making it more compact.

I don’t think two are enough…

Su Ping noticed that part of his inner universe didn’t receive any nourishment from the fruits, and their power had already been used

up.

I should ask for more after I become a Dao Child, Su Ping thought. He placed the idea on hold for the moment; he had just condensed the universe of chaos and never had a chance to consolidate it properly. That was a good opportunity. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He had already grasped twelve of the 108 natural Dao Glyphs in his body; they had been naturally parsed after he condensed the universe of chaos.

He was able to grasp Dao Glyphs faster when he condensed the universe. The previously arcane Dao Glyphs became easy to understand with the universe of chaos as a frame of reference. Everything was much easier.

“I’ll be able to harness the true power of the Primitive Chaos Clan once I parse all the natural Dao Glyphs in my body. According to the Golden Crow elder, my body will be as strong as that of an Ancestral God…”

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He had to become stronger as fast as possible to upgrade his store. He didn’t want to waste time on the candidates’ competition because he was arrogant, but because he wanted to resurrect the Little Skeleton as soon as possible.

While staying in the Five Elements Residence

-Su Ping gradually focused his attention on his body, and the sealed natural Dao Glyphs resurfaced. He started parsing them one by

one.

Time flew.

Three hundred days passed in the blink of an eye.

This kid has an abundant chaos bloodline in his body, which seems to carry Dao Glyphs… Chan Gong noticed Su Ping’s special nature and was shocked. He was undoubtedly one of the best with such bloodline. It was even more terrifying than that of some of the honorable gods!

Only the ancient chaos creatures carry Dao Glyphs in their bodies. Not even high-ranked gods can do that; they can only activate their Ancestral God’s bloodline, but it doesn’t compare to Dao Glyphs…

Su Ping left a deep impression on Chan Gong, who wasn’t deliberately probing into Su Ping’s secrets, but he still felt how extraordinary the human was. He suddenly felt that even if Su Ping didn’t win the Dao Child’s title, his achievements in the future wouldn’t be any fewer. His name would resound in the Archean Divinity!

While pondering in a strange state of mind, Chan Gong awakened his temporary protegé. Su Ping could only resign himself when he realized that three hundred days had passed. During that time of study he managed to crack one and a half Dao Glyphs!

-Given two hundred days more, he would be able to decipher the remaining half.

All in all, he would have deciphered two Dao Glyphs in five hundred days.

Although Dao Glyphs aren’t equally complicated and my speed is not the same, I should be able to decipher all of them in two hundred years and unleash the true power of my bloodline…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

Ascendants considered two hundred years as the batting of an eye

However, it was a long time for Su Ping. After all, even considering the time spent in cultivation sites, he had only cultivated for a hundred years.

This equated to cultivating twice as much as he had already.

“Are you ready?” Chan Gong asked.

Su Ping nodded.

Earlier on, Chan Gong transmitted the gathered intelligence about the dark power. Still, the intelligence was limited; the extinct power from the age of chaos was rare even in the Archean Divinity, and only existed in forbidden areas.

The power has the same source as the Heavenly Tribulations…

Su Ping’s eyes lit up. He vaguely had a guess; but to confirm it, he would probably have to go to the Golden Crow world and seek answers there.

He sobered up after his pondering and left with Chan Gong.

The pair left the Toad Fish Palace and soon returned to the elders’ main castle.

All the elders had arrived. Aside from them, other candidates were present, including Qing Mu. Two new candidates were present; they had not been there before.

“Not all candidates were present in the previous challenge; some were training in seclusion. They were informed but neither came out, which was essentially seen as them giving up the challenge,” Chan Gong explained to Su Ping telepathically.

Once the matter was understood, Su Ping nodded.

Aside from the ten candidates, there was another man in the hall. Glowing and looking exceptionally handsome.

He was none other than Chen Xi.

Chen Xi sensed Su Ping’s gaze and looked back at him.

The latter wasn’t surprised. Chan Gong had already filed an application for him to challenge Chen Xi.

He was the weakest of the three Dao Children.

As he saw his opponent, Su Ping once again detected the charisma of that top genius. Chen Xi was like a shining star when compared to Qing Mu and the others.

Indeed extraordinary. Su Ping was suddenly of a mind to see the other two Dao Children, but his main purpose for that trip was to earn the Dao Child’s identity. So, he preferred to just finish the challenge as soon as possible.

“He’s here.”

Everybody else stared at Su Ping too. His performance three days prior had astonished them. Many of them were paying attention to that record-setting challenger.

In the crowd-Qing Mu, Tan Xiangyun and the others were watching. They felt that Su Ping seemed to be stronger when compared to three days earlier.

He grew stronger in only three days? Tan Xiangyun’s eyes glittered. If that were so, Su Ping’s progressing speed was shocking. “Now that we’re all here, let’s go to the old place.” The big-headed child grimaced, then waved a hand.

The Oceanic Universe of Clouds was opened, and he was the first to enter.

The other candidates glanced at Su Ping and followed him.

Chen Xi withdrew his gaze and floated into the battlefield like a deity from heaven.

Su Ping and Chan Gong also entered. The former was once again able to feel how special the Oceanic Universe of Clouds was; the void was stuck to his body like some sort of flesh.

The universe has wisdom, and every path has a heart… Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

Although Dao Hearts weren’t equally strong, many God Kings didn’t even have a Dao Heart; they were like unsteady roots. Su Ping had yet to find his own Dao Heart.

“They’re here!”

Inside the Oceanic Universe of Clouds—the auditorium next to the battlefield was already full to the brim.

Many mentors of the institute were present. The place was even more crowded when compared to the candidates’ competition.

A large number of people weren’t present during the candidates’ competition; they asked those around curiously when they saw Su Ping

“Is he the human challenger?”

“He doesn’t look like a God King!”

“Dao Child Chen Xi is just as handsome as ever.”

Many female students had strange glints in their eyes.

The candidates flew up to the sky above the battlefield and looked down.

Chen Xi simply entered the battlefield and stood quietly. Although he was the main center of attention, he remained serene, as if isolated from the world.
