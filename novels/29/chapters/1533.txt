Chapter 1534: Six (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The first host was given the Chaos Qualification.

The second host had a Sorcerer Ancestor as a pet.

When it came to Su Ping’s turn, he could only travel to cultivation sites.

This wasn’t the system being biased; she had simply lost all her resources.

In other words, they were much weaker than before to face the Heavens. Using the same method would be suicidal. It was pointless.

Therefore, since she had chosen a third host, she certainly had something in mind.

After a long silence, the system raised her head and glanced at Su Ping. “Although we lost the second war, it allowed me to truly understand the nature of the Heavenly Dao. In order to prevent the Heavenly Dao from profiting off the war, I transferred all living creatures that participated in the war to a chaos timeline.

“This makes it impossible for the Heavenly Dao to absorb the power of their minds. After some rest, they can still fight right now.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“A chaos timeline?”

Su Ping was puzzled. “Time is really not a big deal for the Heavenly Dao, is it?”

Even he could easily reverse time.

The girl stared at Su Ping and said, “The chaos timeline is just a concept so you can understand. As a matter of fact, they are in another universe of chaos; I transformed part of my body into that chaos universe. It blocks the Heavenly Dao and they can never find it.”

Su Ping looked at her while in a slight daze.

Although she only talked about it briefly, Su Ping could easily imagine how brutal the battle was.

The system gathered all lives to fight against the Heavenly Dao. However, she saw their true nature and foresaw how they would fail.

She sacrificed part of her body at the end of the bloody war, turning it into a chaos universe to transfer the survivors. The third war ended in total defeat.

“Now, what are the odds of us winning, in your opinion?” asked Su Ping.

The girl looked at him and said, “Fifty percent!”

“Fifty percent?”

Su Ping was surprised, as the number seemed too high in his opinion. He thought that their chances were below the ten percent mark.

“Back in the third war, although we failed, we managed to heavily wound the Original Core of the Heavenly Dao; it should be weaker than back then. We did lose two Sorcerer Ancestors in the third war, but the contract system has been introduced to more universes.

“The contract system is the mainstream choice in almost every surviving universe.

“I believe there’s a chance for us to win.”

The girl looked at Su Ping and added, “Also, your performance has been surprising. Based on my training experience, there’s only a 48% chance of victory. However, your outstanding performance has increased the odds by 2%; I hope that the upcoming battle will be the endgame. If we fail, there won’t be enough time for me to raise a fourth host.”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. “You’ve even planned to raise a fourth host?”

“Of course. After all, this concerns all living creatures in all universes. I cannot place my hopes entirely on you,” said the girl as she looked at him calmly, “The comunal Heavenly Dao has been attacking the Ancestral Land of Chaos to force me to show up. They have been getting closer and closer over the years!”

“For you, and for all those living, it may seem like countless eons have passed. From the age of chaos, to the primordial times, and to this day… But it’s still the age of chaos actually for me.

“They’re attacking the Ancestral Land of Chaos, like burglars, smashing the windows. I seized the moment and found my first helper when they broke the first window. I found the second helper when he broke the second window…”

She looked at him again and continued, “You’ve only cultivated two thousand years in total, which is just a brief moment in the world of chaos. It would count as a single afternoon in your perception.”

Su Ping was speechless.

Based on what the system said, raising a host was probably no different than casually throwing a seed.

“If we lose this war, our odds of winning the next war would be thirty percent or even lower…” The girl sighed. She didn’t hide the fact and spoke openly about it. She had watched Su Ping grow, and knew that he wouldn’t be bothered by such a “confession.”

Su Ping stayed silent. He knew that the system would prepare backup plans in case of failure.

The next war was too significant, and she had taken many things into account. He didn’t think it was inappropriate of her; after all, he wasn’t really confident of ending that protracted war all on his own.

From the age of chaos to the ancient times, all the way to the age of space travel.

Countless species and countless universes had been born.

The death of so many lives were probably just flickering butterflies for an ancient and immortal existence like the system.

It couldn’t be otherwise, as the system had been born ages in the past. She had probably spent more time alone in the chaos universe than the history of all living creatures in all universes combined.

It was just that there was no concept of time back then.

The Great Dao of Time had yet to be born at that time.

From the primordial times to that day, it was a long scroll from the perspective of living creatures; but for the system, it was just a parallel painting.

“I hope this is indeed the last war. A fifty percent chance of winning…” Su Ping looked at the system and asked, “What were the odds of winning in the previous two wars?”

“I didn’t calculate carefully in the second war. I think there was a seventy percent chance of winning.”

“In the third war, it was sixty percent…”

The girl looked at Su Ping and said, “It may be hard for you to believe, but those two failures were because I underestimated the enemy. Back in the third war I was able to completely figure out everything about the Heavenly Dao. So, there won’t be any unexpected factors this time!”

“Are you sure…” Su Ping was at a loss.

“Very sure,” said the girl with extreme confidence.

The answer stunned him; after all, the system was much stronger than him. She could probably think of everything he could think of. He sighed and said, “I’m not even a Sorcerer Ancestor. It’s pointless for you to train me, isn’t it?”

“I gave away the Chaos Qualifications when I created my twelve children. So, even I am unable to create new Sorcerer Ancestors at this moment,” said the girl regretfully, “The previous two hosts eventually became stronger than the Sorcerer Ancestors with my help. Not being one is not a fault of yours. It’s my problem.”

“If you raise a fourth host, would he become as strong as me?” asked Su Ping.

The girl gave a slight nod. “More or less. They’ll probably be weaker than you. However, if we can loot a Chaos Qualification during the war, there’s a chance for the next host to become a Sorcerer Ancestor, or even stronger.”

“Loot it? From the Heavenly Dao?”

“Yes. It cannot be digested and it’s ever-permanent. So, there’s a chance for us to take it back.”

Su Ping asked, “After so many wars, how many Sorcerer Ancestors are left?”

“Six,” said the girl softly.

“…”

Su Ping was rendered speechless again. “You weren’t able to beat the Heavenly Dao back when you fought alonside the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors. Now, only six are left. Do we really have a chance to win?”

The girl heaved a sigh. “That’s the problem. I gave birth to twelve Sorcerer Ancestors; however, they developed different personalities, as I offered them different Chaos Qualifications. They couldn’t cooperate, and the Heavenly Dao used this to divide and conquer.

“Had they worked together, it should have been fairly easy to defeat the Heavenly Dao!”

Su Ping thought of everything he had seen in the Remains of High Heavens, and was able to understand.

The system had probably intended for him to see that.

“If all six of them are present, our odds of winning would be close to seventy percent!” said the girl, “However, Sorcerer Ancestor Haotian and Sorcerer Ancestor Hei Xiang have both escaped to the border of chaos, and are reluctant to participate in the war; this brings down the odds of winning to only fifty percent.”

Su Ping was stunned. So, only four Sorcerer Ancestors would fight the war?

“They’re unwilling to fight? Why?” Su Ping found it hard to believe.

“They probably think it’s a hopeless case,” said the the girl after a sigh.

“How will that do?” Su Ping had trouble answering. “We must find all of them. This isn’t a kid’s game!”
