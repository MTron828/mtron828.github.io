Kayafollet was truly afraid of Su Ping, who didn’t know the first thing about being gentle towards ladies. She couldn’t beat him and had to give in so she wouldn’t be beaten up again.

“Why is that?” Su Ping frowned.

Kayafollet said quickly, “A very long time ago, the Empyrean Master found an alien realm beyond our universe which was not bound by our laws. We’ve been secretly investigating it ever since. We suspect it’s the broken part of another universe. If they ran away, they could only be hiding there.”

“You’re not lying to me, are you?” Su Ping stared at her. She quickly replied, “I assure you, it’s absolutely true!”

“It’s truly there…”

Shen Huang mumbled. Noticing Su Ping’s expression, he heaved a sigh and said bitterly, “I’ve long received the report that they found a Mysterious Realm filled with countless treasures. It’s also the place where the Planet of Origin trains their Saint Heirs. I knew it was an important place for them, so I didn’t dig into it. She must be talking about that Mysterious Realm.”

“Exactly. We call the place the Extraterritorial Ruins.”

Kayafollet continued, “But that’s not a training ground for Saint Heirs; it’s extremely dangerous. Even though it’s an incomplete world, it contains assorted great paths and beasts. After so many years, we’ve only managed to establish a tiny base there. We planned to explore beyond the universe from that point onward; we didn’t expect this to happen.”

“Humph. You probably thought of it as your last resort. The Primordial Empyrean Master must have seen the signs of this catastrophe, including the merging of the universe,” said Shen Huang coldly.

He believed that the Primordial Empyrean Master was old and cunning enough to know many secrets unknown to the other Celestials; after all, he was the strongest and oldest man in the universe.

Kayafollet couldn’t help but refute, “The Primordial Empyrean Master wasn’t omnipotent, or he wouldn’t have died.”

Su Ping glanced at her. She stopped intervening when she sensed the sharpness in Su Ping’s eyes. She knew that Su Ping hated her for taking part in killing Shen Huang’s original body with her master.

......

“Whatever the reason is, they’ve vanished, which means they’re traitors!” Su Ping said coldly, “According to ancient mythology, people built a massive ark to survive a catastrophe; they’re doing exactly the same. Maybe they think they’re keeping a ray of hope for humankind, but they see all the warriors of the universe as already dead when they are still fighting hard right now!”

Kayafollet was also pondering about the Planet of Origin’s disappearance. If the Primordial Empyrean Master was truly dead, she could then understand such a course of action.

“We have to keep some hope, don’t we? There will be a chance to come back this way. Is it only the right decision to die together with the enemy?” said Kayafollet in a low voice.

“They’re free to leave in despair, but not right now.” Su Ping spared her a frosty stare. “Besides, they don’t get to decide who gets the ship ticket and who doesn’t.”

“But it’s impossible to go about choosing the most suitable survivors at a moment like this. The opportunity to survive has always belonged to the minority. Weaklings are miserable in the face of disaster because others have been cultivating diligently when the rest are having fun,” said Kayafollet, “So, they must pay back when disaster strikes.”

Su Ping looked at her and said, “You’re right, you’re stuck here too. I’ll send you to the front line to resist the worms until you die!”

Her expression changed. “You cannot do that to me. I’m already a Celestial. I can participate in the battle, but I cannot fight alone. If you consider me a warrior, you should make the best use of me.”

“Your greatest value is to die in battle,” Su Ping looked at her coldly and said, “Otherwise, you wouldn’t even have an opportunity to talk to me.”

Kayafollet fell silent.

“Right now, you’re exactly the same as the citizens of the universe that the Planet of Origin has abandoned.”

Su Ping added, “Your planet abandoned everyone because they have the Extraterritorial Ruins and they thought they were strong enough to leave without anyone stopping them. Now, I’m stronger than you, and you have to listen to me. You think it’s unfair? Like you said, you were playing with your toys when I was cultivating, so you should just obey my orders, or I will make you die an even worse death!”

Kayafollet bit her lips. “You know it’s unfair. I’ve never slacked off in my cultivation; you’re only stronger than me because of the magic store. Otherwise…” Su Ping sneered. “I could say exactly the same to you. Like I said before, maybe you would have starved already if you hadn’t been born on the Planet of Origin. Your birth is unimaginably privileged to countless people. If you’re qualified to decide their fate, then I’m qualified to decide yours!”

Kayafollet fell silent. What Su Ping said rendered her speechless; she suddenly felt the sadness of a weakling. She even grew desperate.

She wasn’t lying. She had been working her hardest ever since she started to cultivate, and yet, she was still restrained by Su Ping. Was that the difference in luck?
