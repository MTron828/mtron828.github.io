Chapter 1347 Bloodline Transplant (2)

“Master, if I’m understanding correctly, did you find the entire body?” Su Ping tried to keep his voice calm. “Are you trying to resurrect that ancient corpse?”

“It would be great if it could be resurrected, it would be great. After all, it used to be an Ancestral God.” The master of the Red Dome Realm chuckled and added, “However, according to the examination of my clan’s Ancestral God, this ancient corpse is completely dead; even though you repaired the finger a bit by letting it absorb the power of fire, only the body can be fixed.

“Even after being fully repaired, it would still be a dead object.

“If we really want to fix it, I would have to infuse the finger with Heavenly Fire day and night for a thousand years. It would end up as good as new.”

Su Ping nodded; she was not lying about that.

“Then what’s your plan?”

The realm master chuckled and said, “This is a core secret of my clan. Are you sure you want to hear it?”

Su Ping slightly raised his eyebrows. “What will happen if I do?”

She replied with a smile, “Nothing much. We simply hope that you won’t spread the information. In addition, you’d better marry someone of our clan as soon as possible and have a child. That way you’d be a son-in-law to our clan, and we could certainly share the secret with you.”

Su Ping was lost for words. Do I have to sell myself for this?

“If the one I have to marry is you, I’ll think about it,” said Su Ping.

The realm master rolled her eyes at him and said, “Stop making excuses, Dao Child. If you’re willing to go through with the marriage, we certainly wouldn’t wrong you; your wife would be a pure-blood genius of our clan. There’s a candidate right here in my palace; she’s quite cute. If you like her, I can talk to the clan master about your marriage immediately.”

She waved a hand and displayed a schene while she spoke.

A crimson-haired girl stood out from the crowd around her. Her red hair and cold aura made her eye-catching.

Su Ping didn’t expect her to be that serious about an arranged marriage. He said helplessly, “Even if I like her, she might not like me at all.”

“You’re so handsome and talented, she would surely see you fondly,” said the realm master after a short laugh, “Even if she doesn’t, it’s fine. You can work on baby making before you develop love.”

Su Ping was lost for words. He had conflicting feelings as he looked at the disappearing girl in the scene.

Although the special geniuses of the gods were honorable and exceptional, they would sometimes have to sacrifice themselves at any moment for the interests of their clans.

There was sadness behind the outward splendor.

“I’m okay with an arranged marriage, but I want to be the one to choose the person I’m going to marry,” said Su Ping after thinking for a moment.

That was just a delaying strategy, as he was quite curious about the Yan Clan secrets, which had to do with the Heavens from the age of chaos.

“Seriously?”

The realm master was rather surprised, not expecting him to be willing.

She had failed to lure Su Ping with treasures, even when offered Ancestral God techniques. However, he seemed to be tempted by the ancient corpse.

“Sure.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Su Ping said, “Besides, I get to decide the time of the marriage. It has to be at least after I become a God Emperor.”

The realm master glanced at Su Ping and said, “Deal. We will both swear a divine vow, that way no one will have any regrets!”

“No problem.” Su Ping accepted without hesitation.

He had to pick his wife anyway. Might as well pick the woman right before him and see how she would respond.

The realm master narrowed her eyes and realized Su Ping’s plan, but she didn’t say anything. She could seriously consider marriage if Su Ping did become a God Emperor.

The realm master recorded their agreement with a divine skill. She then said, “Why are you so curious about this ancient corpse?”

“Who’s not curious about an Ancestral God’s body?” Su Ping asked back.

She choked for a moment. Ancestral Gods were superior in the world of gods; she was even more shocked and curious than Su Ping when she saw the ancient corpse for the first time.

After all, how could someone as strong as an Ancestral God only leave a body behind?

Who could have killed an Ancestral God?

That is, unless two Ancestral Gods went all out in the past!

“The ancient corpse is from a mysterious place in the Red Dome Realm. It was surrounded by eternal Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire.”

She added, “Once we found it, we chopped it into three thousand pieces because there were three thousand complete Dao Domains inside that body!

“We’re not trying to revive the ancient being; we’re trying to enslave it and raise existences that carry its bloodline.”

She slowly told him about the Yan Clan’s greatest secret, “We’re trying to transplant the flesh and blood of this ancient corpse. We’ve nurtured some descendants through this method. It’s the greatest secret of our clan.”

“You’re raising descendants of this ancient

corpse?”

Su Ping’s heart was pounding. He was terrified by what the realm master said.

They were too crazy.

They were trying to steal the Heavens’ bloodline!

“Did you succeed?”

“No,” she said and shook her head, “Although we raised the ancient corpse’s descendants, they’re all flawed and can’t absorb Heavenly Fire. However, they are indeed more talented than some geniuses of our clan; they can even compare to the pure-blood geniuses.”

Su Ping breathed in relief.

That’s great.

They would have raised more Heavens if they succeeded!

ever se

Even though he had never seen them, he knew how terrifying the race was, based on the Golden Crow ancestor’s reaction.

That was not a race to be brought to life!

“What you’re doing is too risky. This ancient corpse might not be from a friendly race,” said Su Ping with a sigh, feeling that the Yan Clan was being too reckless.

“Huh? Why do you think that, Dao Child?” The realm master.

He gave a slight head shake and replied, “You don’t even know the background of this ancient corpse, and yet you’re trying to transplant their bloodline. If the bloodline is too powerful, the people you raise will easily overturn your clan.”

She was enlightened. “I didn’t know you meant that, but there’s nothing to worry about. The candidates we pick are all loyal; they won’t betray our clan no matter how strong they are.” Su Ping naturally knew they had ways to control the geniuses they nurtured. But, was it so easy to control the bloodline of the Heavens? If so, why would the Golden Crows live in seclusion?

Su Ping believed that in the age of chaos, when mythical creatures fought the Heavens, some of the latter had surely died and ended up as experiment subjects.

But even after that, the Golden Crows still chose to hide from the world. This meant that such a method was probably ineffective.

“What did you mean by ‘enslave’ just now,

master?”

Su Ping stopped persuading her, knowing it would be pointless for him to talk considering his identity; it would only throw her off.

“By enslaving it, we can control part of the remaining corpse through divine skills,” said the master of the Red Dome Realm with a smile, “It’s one of the core combat abilities of our clan. Still, it’s not really a secret among high-ranked clans, since we’ve used this publicly in the past. We just haven’t shown its full effect…”

She looked at Su Ping and added, “You’ll be able to try the technique when you become a son-in-law of our clan.”

“Good.”

Su Ping had nothing else to say.

“You know something about the ancient corpse, right?” asked the realm master curiously.

Su Ping was alarmed by the question, and was impressed by her instincts. Still, he gave off a nonchalant attitude as he answered, “How can I know if you don’t?” “That’s true…” The realm master thought it was just her imagining things.

“Master, where’s the Heavenly Fire?” Su Ping didn’t want to stay any longer.

The realm master gave him a gloomy look, as if admonishing him for not being appreciative. Still, she was never much of a talker; she would have ended the conversation long before if she weren’t talking to Su Ping.

“Follow me, Dao Child.”

The master of the Red Dome Realm rose, and a crack appeared in front of them.

Su Ping followed her and entered the fissure. He instantly felt a scorching heat.

There was abundant Heavenly Fire surging about. Su Ping saw that the white flames were burning fiercely.
