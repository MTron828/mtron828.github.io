Chapter 1536: Ten Thousand Years of Cultivation (1)

“You’ve already woken up and regained your original appearance. When are we going to take action?” asked Su Ping.

“No rush,” said the girl, “We’ll wait until you reach the limit of the path you found. According to my deduction, you’ll be no weaker than a Sorcerer Ancestor if you walk to the end of that path, even without a Chaos Qualification.”

“Seriously?”

Su Ping felt thrilled because of the system’s approval. It seemed that he had truly made the right choice.

The prospect itself of becoming as strong as a Sorcerer Ancestor was amazing.

“Chaos Qualifications can grant Sorcerer Ancestors the ability to dominate chaos. They can create and destroy everything with a thought. Just a thought is needed to condense and blow up thousands of universes!”

The system continued, “There are mainly three thousand Great Daos derived from chaos, and hundreds of thousands of Lesser Daos. You’ll be almost as strong as a Sorcerer Ancestors when you condense the three thousand Great Daos into universes. However, it’s impossible to transform the hundreds of thousands of Lesser Daos into Undying Universes; there’s not enough power in the world.

“We’ll set out to fight the Heavenly Dao after you create the universes of the three thousand Great Daos.”

Su Ping was stunned. “So, the time set for the war will depend on me?”

“That’s right,” said the girl. “Going by my deductions, you should be able to achieve perfection in 10,000 years. That is when we’re going to the Ancestral Land of Chaos to fight the Heavenly Dao.”

Su Ping couldn’t help but ask, “Ten thousand years? Wouldn’t it be too long?”

“It’s a fairly long time for humans, but it’s only a brief moment in the Ancestral Land of Chaos. This is an eternal war; giving you ten thousand years is not a big deal,” said the girl.

Su Ping had never been to the Ancestral Land of Chaos. However, according to the system, it was clearly a place entirely different from the universes he had lived in.

War was still in progress in that place. A lot of things had changed in the outside world over the long time span.

“Also, the other Sorcerer Ancestors will join us while you’re cultivating. I told them to gather here,” said the girl.

Su Ping took a deep breath, understanding sunk in. He would fight alongside the four Sorcerer Ancestors once he was done cultivating. The war would decide his fate as well as that of all living creatures in infinite universes!

Hiding from the war would be pointless.

If the Heavens took hold of the Ancestral Land of Chaos chaos was restarted, all the universes would be destroyed and nobody except the Sorcerer Ancestors would survive.

“Can I go to cultivation sites right now?” asked Su Ping.

“Sure.”

The girl added, “Now you know the truth about cultivation sites. Some of the creatures you’ve killed in cultivation sites survived the war, while others died. However, I believe that none of them will hate you after the war ends. Maybe you’ll even get to see them again on the battlefield.”

Su Ping was dazed.

He had killed many beasts and enemies in the cultivation sites.

For instance, he had killed the Rain Ancestor and many Ancestral God beasts in the Archean Divinity.

I didn’t know that they would be my comrades…?Su Ping had mixed feelings about it. Even though they belonged to different timelines, they were fighting for the same goal.

“I’ll take you to meet one of the Sorcerer Ancestors,” said the girl abruptly.

Su Ping instantly felt that the store’s barrier was gone and he could fully sense what was happening outside. He then spread his senses and noticed an aura as terrifying as the abyss, standing right outside the store.

“Sorcerer Ancestor…”

“It’s Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo,” said the girl.

The store’s door opened; a slender and tall young man walked in. Although human shaped at the moment, he emitted a ferocious aura as he stepped in, which spread to every corner of the store, like raging octopuses.

The rooms closed by the system were also infiltrated by the aura.

The usually impregnable store was easily infiltrated by that Sorcerer Ancestor.

Everything inside the store was registered by his senses without any impediment. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo, from this place?” Slightly dazed, Su Ping looked at the black-robed young man. He knew that the guy’s original appearance was too horrifying and indescribable to understand. He only transformed into a young human, to facilitate communication.

“Is he the third guardian you’ve found? He seems to be slightly stronger than the previous two.” The young man looked at our hero with indifference. There was no emotion in his eyes. Even though he assumed a humanlike appearance, he didn’t emulate their feelings, so he came across as overly cold.

“That’s right. His performance exceeded my expectations.” The girl nodded.

She looked at Su Ping and chuckled. “To make it easier for you to understand my existence, I specifically found a planet named Earth and picked you randomly; that has probably been my best choice.

“You asked me if I was satisfied with you. I can answer you now. I’m very satisfied!”

Su Ping glanced at her, not expecting her to remember something from so long before.

So, his transmigration from Earth was also the system’s doing.
