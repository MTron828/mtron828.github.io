Chapter 429 Sudden Attack

As the old man made the proposal, many turned their attention to Su Ping who was dressed in an almost miserable and shabby way.

Some of the passengers even began to envy Su Ping. He, for sure, ran into some bad luck and almost fell victim to that crazy Red Phantom Dog. However, he ended up unhurt and was then going to get a lot of money.

Ten thousand was not a small number, almost equal to what a white-collar worker could make in a month. For a young man who was dressed up that poorly, this had to be a huge amount of money.

Both Ji Zhantang and his granddaughter frowned at this. They could feel that the old man in the suit was holding them in contempt for getting involved.

While everyone anticipated that the young man was going to take the money, which would bring an end to this story, he did not. “Offering me money is not necessary, it wasn’t a big deal. But you really should thank the young lady here. If it weren’t for her, you would have seen blood when you got here, and if someone ended up getting hurt, money wouldn’t have corrected that mistake,” Su Ping said.

His reply took everyone aback.

The old man’s smile froze on his face as he gazed at the young man in a daze. For one thing, the young man had refused to take the money. For another, he was educating him?

The young man sounded calm, but it was that very calmness in his tone that made the old man feel strange and uncomfortable.

Blood?

It wouldn’t have been a big deal even if you had been bitten to death. The worst case scenario was a lawsuit and all they had to do was to settle with money.

Was the young man aiming for more than the ten thousand?

The old man in the suit didn’t seem to be happy. Ji Zhantang could argue with him and that was because Ji Zhantang was an equal. How dare this poor guy talk like this? The old man couldn’t swallow the humiliation.

He gradually began to unleash his energy. The old man in the suit gazed at Su Ping coldly. There seemed to be two towering mountains above his shoulders, which were moving toward Su Ping along his gaze. He wanted to make the young man bend over on the ground, to kneel and say he was sorry! “Huh, an old man bullying a kid!”

Ji Zhantang sneered. He had stepped over before anyone noticed. He gave a look of admiration to Su Ping and then said to the old man in the suit, “He is simply not taking your money. And he’s not wrong, you know? If someone had died, you wouldn’t have been able to correct that mistake with money. What do you think you can do to him?”

As he said those words, Ji Zhantang stepped in front of Su Ping to protect him against the old man’s threat.

The old man in the suit squinted his eyes and his face became clouded.

While the energy between the two old men was becoming more and more intense, they heard a noise. It was the metal door opening. A team of people wearing green armors arrived. Those were the attendants and they had to be of high rank judging by the armors they were wearing and their shoulder straps.

All of the five were advanced battle pet warriors.

“The train is about to depart. Go back to your rooms and do not get into trouble!” The team leader was a middle-aged man. He said so even though he was a bit scared by the energy coming off from Ji Zhantang and the old man in the suit.

Those attendants were civil servants from the government. They weren’t afraid because anyone who dared to offend them would become an enemy of the government!

The old man in the suit snorted after the attendants came to maintain order. He said nothing and went back to where his young lady was. Before he left, he took another look at Su Ping. He had committed the young man’s look into memory.

Ji Zhantang noticed the look in that old man’s eyes, which made Ji Zhantang frown.

The onlookers went back to their rooms at the attendant’s command. Soon, Ji Zhantang, Ji Qiuyu, and Su Ping were the only ones standing in the hallway.

“Hey, our room is just over there. You can come and grab me at any time if anything happens,” Ji Zhantang said to Su Ping kindly.

Su Ping refrained from explaining a single thing and simply nodded.

He, too, had noticed the killing intent the old man in the suit had splayed when he left but Su Ping didn’t mind it. That old man had better not create any troubles. If he did, Su Ping would reduce him to dust.

Ji Qiuyu didn’t say anything to Su Ping. When Su Ping turned down the money, she did think highly of him. But that was it.

Ji Zhantang didn’t speak too much with Su Ping. After all, they were mere strangers. He took his granddaughter to their rooms.

After they left, Su Ping took out his room key and inserted it into the slot on the door. The door opened, revealing a small room that was merely seven to eight square meters. There was a bathroom, a bed, and minimal space to walk around.

Of course, to have such a room on a train was already amazing. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Su Ping put his backpack on the desk and sat down on the bed.

He was traveling to the Holy Light Base City.

A sacred place for all trainers. The Holy Light was a Class A base city, or as people often say, a tier-one base city.

Of the more than a hundred base cities in the Subcontinent District, there were three levels, Class A, B, and C. Only seven base cities were Class A base cities!

Class A base cities were superior to the other base cities in every way, especially in safety and security. Not even beast kings could destroy a Class A base city!

Of the entire Subcontinent District, there were merely two legendary battle pet warriors, who were comparable to beast kings. That being said, humans had been able to acquire some artifacts and develop some weapons that could deter many beast kings.

Even in Class B base cities, people were able to fight back under a beast king’s attack, or at least make it until other base cities came to the rescue!

The distance to the Holy Light Base City was long. Su Ping saw that it was written on the ticket. The trip would take two days and nights! That was a trip that went across half of the Subcontinent District!

Su Ping leaned against the bed and stared at the reinforced synthetic glass. He could see the rails outside through the glass.

Many tracks were running parallel to each other. Outside the tracks were stone walls that were evidently built by pets of the stone family. The underground tunnel was more like a cave for the beasts.

On the sides of the train were rows of lights that could produce a projection of tentacles. Looking from a distance, the train was like a huge centipede moving along the underground.

Su Ping gazed at the stones through the glass. He was interested at first, but he gradually grew bored. He decided to close his eyes and rest his mind.

Time zipped by.

The train would stop every few hours.

Someone would get off and someone would get onboard. He could hear people walking around.

Su Ping began to focus on cultivation. As the train dashed on, Su Ping could tell that the astral powers in the tunnel were suitable for battle pets of the stone family.

But he had no such pet.

Of course, he didn’t need pets of the stone family because the Golden Dragon Hound was his best shield.

An entire day had passed.

Su Ping was getting hungry. He stopped and headed to the diner on the train.

There was a diner not far away from the cabin he was in. It was said that the food in that diner was better and more diverse than the food offered in the diner for the hard seat cabin. He had also heard that chefs were waiting on the passengers in the private cabins

—which would cost a million for one ticketand could order anything they wanted.

Su Ping met Ji Zhantang and his granddaughter at the diner.

They said hello to each other.

Su Ping picked some dishes and sat down by himself to eat his meal.

Although they had met, he thought he didn’t have to engage them in a conversation since they weren’t familiar with each other and were unable to find any common topics right off the bat.

Su Ping was halfway through his meal when Ji Zhantang and his granddaughter had finished. As they walked past Su Ping’s table, Ji Zhantang said with a smile, “Glad to see you. Later.”

Ji Qiuyu just darted a look at Su Ping. She was not a big talker.

“Ok,” Su Ping nodded and replied.

Soon, he finished his meal and went back to his room.

He did a little stretch in the tight room before he sat down on his bed again to cultivate.

This time, after merely a few hours, he suddenly heard a shrill noise that was highly offending to the ears. In the meantime, the entire train trembled so violently that Su Ping was thrown off the bed.
