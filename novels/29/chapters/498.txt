Chapter 501 Charge!

“Got it.”

Qin Duhuang gazed into the distance upon hearing Qin Feiyu’s words. He was able to see dark clouds gathering on the horizon. A storm was brewing “We shall charge when the wild beasts step on the land mines! “Have the long-range thunder fire snipers warm up!” Qin Duhuang issued orders. “Yes.” Qin Feiyu nodded and went to relay the instructions.

Some titled battle pet warriors who had arrived from other places to support the Longjiang Base City were standing next to Qin Duhuang; they would take orders directly from him. Among those warriors, one was at the peak of the tilted rank.

All those titled battle pet warriors were well acquainted with Qin Duhuang and they had no problem listening to his orders. “Is there any sign of beast kings?” Qin Duhuang asked a government agent. There was a device in front of that staff member, which was able to receive real-time data. He answered at once, “Mr. Qin, there’s a sign of one beast king. No sign of the other beast kings; I suppose they went to the other sides.” “One beast king!”

The titled battle pet warriors sounded nervous.

Even one beast king would make them feel worried.

But no one was going to leave; everyone had been aware of what would happen before making the trip. They weren’t there for the sake of violence, but to save!

Qin Duhuang was just as stressed out. He actually wished he would have two beast kings to deal with. That way, the other sides would have an easier time. He had bought a beast king from Su Ping, but had not had the time to test its abilities yet. That being said, it was a beast king nonetheless and it should be of great help “How is the swamp going?” Qin Duhuang asked.

At the moment, some distance beyond the base city’s outer wall, many advanced battle pet warriors were working with their battle pets of the stone family to turn the land into swamps, pools filled with mines, and setting up other types of traps. Those traps would hinder and slow down the wild beasts when they came. Ambushing the wild beasts was not the priority. The major intention was to slow down the wild beasts.

“Almost done. The lava land is being primed as well,” the government staff member answered. That was a relief. Qin Duhuang assigned other people tasks according to their battle pet types. Each person who participated in the battle would receive materials and potions that could replenish their astral powers. All those materials and potions were provided by the five major families for free. The five major families had invested greatly in this regard. Time moved on. The wild beasts were getting closer.

The reports were being updated every ten minutes at first; the interval later shortened to five minutes and then three minutes! Eventually, Qin Duhuang and the other titled battle pet warriors were able to feel a slight tremor on the wall. The wild beasts were coming! “They’re here!” Qin Duhuang said. All the titled battle pet warriors who stood behind him gazed into the distance, looking worried.

Boom_!

A loud noise came from the distance.

“Mr. Qin, the wild beasts are approaching the land mines!” the government agent reported.

Everyone was nervous. Boom~~!!

The explosion generated a loud noise far in the horizon, rumbling. The impact was massive. A cloud of smoke floated over the battlefield. The explosion continued and so did the noise. While they couldn’t see clearly, they were able to imagine how the wild beasts were being torn apart into pieces. The land mines had the power to inflict great harm on the wild beasts and slow them down. The explosion lasted for a few minutes. Soon, the government agent reported again, “Mr. Qin, the wild beasts are at the lightning and fire zone!”

Qin Duhuang picked up a telescope. The high-powered telescope allowed him to see into the distance. While the wild beasts had just stomped over the land mines, the hordes were still massive and dense. It seemed that the wild beasts had not been affected. Based on the agent’s report, Qin Duhuang knew that all the landmines had blasted off. That level of explosion could have harmed many wild beasts. The reason had to be that the sheer number of wild beasts was mind boggling. As such, even if some wild beasts had died, those that continued the stampede were still too many.

Qin Duhuang wore a grave look. The wild beasts were assaulted by lava when they arrived at the lightning and fire zone. Some wild beasts of the wind and water family were injured or killed in this zone. On the other hand, the wild beasts of the fire family were like ducks to water. They actually sped up after they came across that zone.

But such a zone had to be set up. The land mines could blast many wild beasts to death, but some beasts could be stimulated into mutating by the land mines; that was one of the disadvantages of such a strategy. But there were more strengths than shortcomings. Therefore, such special zones were a must.

As they looked at the lightning and fire zone, one of the battle pet warriors said in a low voice, “They’re here!” They had repeated that phrase several times, but it was true this time!

“Have you found anything about the beast king?” Qin Duhuang asked the government agent.

“Mr. Qin, the electromagnetic radiation from the land mines is affecting the signal. We cannot find anything about the beast king,” the government agent answered. Qin Duhuang was startled but he didn’t comment on it. He gazed at the lightning and fire zone. Next to that zone was the swamp; some of the wild beasts had stepped into the swamp at the moment and some battle pets had been hiding there. The battle pet warriors jumped and pounced on the wild beasts right then.

“Prepare the long-range sniper cannons. Blast away the ninth-rank beasts!” Qin Duhuang ordered.

The monitoring system could come back online as the wild beasts entered the swamp. They could start eliminating the ninth-rank beasts first, not stopping until the beast king arrived. Qin Duhuang wasn’t that afraid of the wild beast king, since he had bought a beast king pet from Su Ping. He was merely concerned about the Otherworld Heavenly King that no one had heard anything off up until then.

If the Heavenly King arrived through that side and breached it, Qin Duhuang would feel ashamed to face the people of the Longjiang Base City, Xie Jinshui and Su Ping again. Soon, the two long-range sniper cannons had located the ninth-rank beasts. The cannons were slowly turned over. The barrels of those cannons were over a dozen meters long. The bullets were able to heavily wound beasts at the peak of the ninth rank; only beasts with excellent in defense could fend off their strikes.

But such beasts were usually not good at charging. They weren’t the source of worry for the moment. The lightning and fire zone was leveled, it wasn’t as filled with dead wild beasts as expected, since more and more beasts were dashing into the swamp. The other wild beasts stomped over the corpses and charged into the swamp and fought against the battle pets that were hiding there.

Many battle pets were skilled at fighting in swamps; still, with so many wild beasts moving in, more and more battle pets passed away until none stood! The wild beasts bit or tore apart the dead bodies of those battle pets. No battle pet died with a complete corpse. The masters of those battle pets were standing on the outer wall. Watching their battle pets being killed had filled them with sorrow and fury; still, they had to push down their urge to go down there and avenge their battle pets.

Roar!

Roar!!

The loud bellows echoed throughout. The wild beasts unleashed their skills in the swamp; some turned the swamp into pieces of rock and others froze it. Soon, the wild beasts had forged a path forward. “Kill them!” Qin Duhuang shouted.

Boom! Boom!

The cannons were fired. Two beams of glaring light were shot out from the outer wall toward two massive beasts at the ninth rank. One of the two beasts was pierced through by the beams of light and died on the spot. The other one was heavily wounded. Crying, the beast built up a barrier and stopped moving forward. After sensing the danger, the other ninth-rank beasts unleashed skills to protect themselves before they pressed on. Xie Jinshui had finished his other work. He hurried over to the east side when the wild beasts were going past the swamp. He flew up to the outer wall. Xie Jinshui issued many orders based on what he saw. Some low-altitude missiles and thunder cannons were launched immediately, blasting at the beasts on the way.

Qin Duhuang was a bit relaxed with Xie Jinshui present, but he had no time to ask about the situation on the other sides. Qin Duhuang said to his men, “It will be our turn when the wild beasts leave the swamp zone!” Once the swamp zone was breached, there was another zone filled with boulders and lava, followed by an area with stone spikes. They had to stop the beasts from advancing before they reached the stone spikes; otherwise, the beasts would start attacking the outer wall. Once they reached that step, some wild beasts would have the chance to sneak into the base city; it would be too late for them to go after the wild beasts at that point! “Yes!”

The titled battle pet warriors wore solemn looks.

Some of the titled battle pet warriors were elders of the Qin family, about the same age as Qin Duhuang, and some were young, fighting next to their fathers. They were all there, to protect the Longjiang Base City, and to protect their children!

The cannons blasted the wild beasts away. More than ten beasts of the ninth rank had fallen!

Roar!!

Right then, they heard a roar that would astound all.

That roar was fierce. Next, they saw a wild mammoth-like beast heading their way. The beast was close to fifty meters tall, like a walking mountain! That was to say, the beast was as tall as a ten-storey building. Being a strong beast, it left a massive pit with each step!

“Beast king!” The titled battle pet warriors and everyone else guarding the outer wall were shocked and scared by the deafening roar and the huge figure that was getting closer. The beast king had arrived. That was quite an intimidating beast king!

Even Qin Duhuang had turned pale.

Roar!!

All of a sudden, that mammoth-like beast king raised its head. It poked its trunk into the ground; it lifted a massive boulder and hurled it forward. With a whooshing sound, that huge boulder traveled in the air, on its way to smash into the outer wall!

Many titled battle pet warriors were appalled. Considering the size and the speed of the boulder, it was going to reach them like a meteorite! “Quickly, smash the boulder!” Xie Jinshui shouted in a hurry.

One of the sniper cannons immediately locked onto the boulder and fired with a bang. The boulder was shattered in the air several hundred meters from the outer wall of the base city. The scattered debris poured down like rain, and some splashed onto the outer wall. Some battle pet warriors of the fourth or fifth rank were immediately smashed to death by that scattered debris! Qin Duhuang was worried. The mammoth-like beast king suddenly sped up and charged toward the outer wall. The beast king could even overturn the ground. Boom! Boom! Boom! “No, sh*t. It is coming to the wall!” “Have the cannon ready! Launch!”

Xie Jinshui sounded anxious.

The titled battle pet warriors were filled with fear and anger all at once. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The cannons that were able to kill the ninth-rank beast were fired at the mammoth-like beast king. It was an easy target, given its gargantuan size. The noise of explosions and smoke filled the air, but a massive force soon emerged from the dissipating smoke! The ground kept vibrating nonstop. The mammoth-like beast king dashed out from the smoke, completely unharmed!

The thermal weapons were not working!

“Sir, let me go!”

The foreign battle pet warrior at the peak of the titled rank asked for permission. Xie Jinshui looked at him. He was about to agree when Qin Duhuang jumped in. “Let me!” With that said, a swirl opened up behind him. Following that, there was a sudden, extremely deep and reckless aura permeating from it, which seemed to come from another distant time and space.

A huge figure crawled out. It was the Storm Scorpion he had just bought from Su Ping! “Charge!” Qin Duhuang shouted. The Storm Scorpion had sensed a threat from a creature of its kind as soon as it came out. The beast king pet cast its brown eyes on that creature; it flew off from the outer wall upon receiving Qin Duhuang’s order and snuck underground Less than half a minute later, two beast kings bumped into each other among the stone spikes! The hundred-meter long Storm Scorpion dashed out from the ground. While the Storm Scorpion was smaller than the mammoth in size, it gained the advantage with its surprise attack. The Storm Scorpion poked into the mammoth’s belly with its venomous and sharp claws. A deep cut appeared on the mammoth’s belly. Startled by the sudden attack, the mammoth-like beast king roared in anger. It attempted to stomp on the Storm Scorpion. Suddenly, the ground under the beast king’s feet bulged, lifting the Storm Scorpion near its tusks. The Storm Scorpion was agile; it wiggled and climbed over the mammoth’s back. The Storm Scorpion waved its tail and left a cut on one of the mammoth’s legs. Roar!!

The pain stimulated the mammoth. It stirred up a sand storm that covered itself and the Storm Scorpion. “Old Qin?” Xie Jinshui turned to Qin Duhuang in astonishment. Was that Storm Scorpion a beast king? Qin Duhuang had a beast king?

“I bought it from Mr. Su,” Qin Duhuang answered briefly while he kept his stare on the sand storm. To his relief, he could only feel anger, not fear, from that Storm Scorpion. However, to finish the battle as soon as possible, Qin Duhuang did mobilize one-third of his astral powers to the Storm Scorpion. That amount of astral powers might not be able to do much when facing a beast king, but it could offer some help. “Mr. Su?” Xie Jinshui could not believe it. He knew Su Ping was going to sell battle pets but he wasn’t aware that he had meant beast kings!

How shocking! The other titled battle pet warriors standing there were just as astonished. They weren’t aware that the Raging Spirit had a beast king! Of course, those who were members of the Qin family were not surprised. They had already heard about it.

While everyone was trying to figure out what would happen to the two beast kings in the sand storm, two roars were heard, coming from behind the wild beasts! The roars were from two different creatures, but they were equally violent! The roars were like claps of thunder. Even the noises created by the wild beasts were unable to conceal the two roars! Filled with dread, people gazed into the distance.

Two figures were dashing over. One of them was a dragon; not an average dragon, but a beast king dragon! It was close to fifty-meters tall and covered with cyan and red scales, each of which was half a meter long. The other was flying in the air. It looked like a snake with huge wings. “Winged Serpent!” “Cyan Fire Dragon!” Some battle pet warriors shouted their names. They had recognized the two beast kings, which had been recorded by humans a long time before. But it never occurred to anyone that they would appear there on that side!

The mammoth had not been taken care of yet, and there were already two more!

Three beast kings on that side!! Qin Duhuang was ghastly pale. He merely had one beast king pet; the most he could do was to stop one of them. Why were there two more? Were the beasts trying to breach the city from the east side? Qin Duhuang turned to Xie Jinshui.

The latter was looking at him as well. Xie Jinshui could tell that the beast king pet was Qin Duhuang’s sole ace card. The titled battle pet warriors felt they could barely breathe when the other two beast kings came out. The other people decided to give up all hope. Qin Duhuang wanted to say something but decided not to. He wanted to tell Xie Jinshui to ask Su Ping to give them a hand. However, Qin Duhuang left those words unsaid, since the Heavenly King was still in hiding. He looked at the Storm Scorpion that was still battling the mammoth. He made up his mind. “All titled battle pet warriors of the Qin family, let us distract that Winged Serpent!” The titled battle pet warriors of the Qin family could not believe what they had heard.

Distract it?

With what?

With themselves! “Shuhai is willing to take the lead. Guys, let’s go!” Qin Shuhai shouted, biting his teeth. He took out his blade with determination. He had once charged into a barren area on his own, only carrying that blade. He had killed several beasts of the ninth rank while relying on no battle pets. He had established his name!

At the moment, his blood was surging as if he had, once again, returned to that time!

No one knew that he had once hunted down those beasts of the ninth rank because they had killed a team of explorers in that barren area.

He had hunted down the beasts to avenge the explorers! He avenged them because a girl with a sunshine smile had once helped him find his way!

That direction she pointed was the direction he followed to grow! “Charge!!” Qin Shuhai shouted. His handsome face was twisted. He summoned his battle pets and threw himself into the fray.

Many of the other titled battle pet warriors of the Qin family watched Qin Shuhai as he grew up. They were inspired by his words and no longer hesitated. The moment they decided to stay, they did so while reading themselves for that final moment.

Distracting a beast king?

That was a suicidal mission but someone had to do it!

“Charge!!”

“All the titled battle pet warriors of the great Qin family, let’s go!”

Many aged titled battle pet warriors drew their blades and weapons. They were standing up, tall and strong, and shouted as they charged toward the beast king.

They summoned their battle pets; all the pets were able to sense their masters’ convictions. Crying or bellowing, the battle pets issued battle calls and ran with their masters! Over a dozen titled battle pet warriors from the Qin Family charged forth. With dozens of battle pets running alongside them, they dashed toward the Winged Serpent, like a candle moth flying into the fire!

Charge! Charge!! Their shouts echoed in the sky. Amid the stares of many more, the titled battle pet warriors dashed away.
