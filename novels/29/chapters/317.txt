Chapter 318 Witness True Strength

In front of them.

Boom

A battle broke out on that bleak and desolate land. Following Su Ping’s command, the Dark Dragon Hound and the Purple Python released all of their skills at the Moonfrost Dragon.

Su Ping told Su Lingyue to instruct the Moonfrost Dragon to fight back with all its might.

This was so that she could see the true power of the Moonfrost Dragon! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Roar!!

Having had the permission from Su Lingyue, the Moonfrost Dragon let out a roar that echoed between heaven and earth as if it had just been freed from the shackles!

The roar was resonant, with penetrating power, fury and violence.

The Moonfrost Dragon was a female, and of all dragons, the Moonfrost Dragons were usually mild in character. However, having grown to this level because of Su Ping’s training within such a short time, the Moonfrost Dragon had gone through a lot... especially killings! The planet, which had been sitting still in the universe for billions of years, issued a sound to the rest of the universe for the first time.

The dragon’s roar was powerful. As the Moonfrost Dragon’s master, Su Lingyue would not be affected by the spiritual corrosion and deterrence contained in the roar. The wind which had sprung up still blew her hair back. Su Ping had been prepared for this. He had set up a defense in his spirit so he stayed unaffected.

He had grown almost immune to dragon roars.

After the roar ended, the golden scales on the Moonfrost Dragon began to wiggle. A tyrannical aura surged from the dragon’s body and quickly condensed on the surroundings. At the same time, strange purple flames grew out of thin air! Fire and ice existed together!

The golden divine energy inside the Moonfrost Dragon began to move about as if it had come to life.

Bang!

The ground collapsed, and a series of oppressive electric arcs in the void were forming a terrifying force field.

Su Lingyue was completely stunned by what appeared to be the end of the world.

Was that her... Moonfrost Dragon?

In her mind, the Moonfrost Dragon would always be gentle and intimate to her, like a lovely baby. But at this moment, amidst the maddening dust, thunder and lightning, the Moonfrost Dragon had turned into a dragon emperor with a terrifying aura that was hard to describe...

Several hours later, the battle ended.

Su Ping took Su Lingyue back to the store. She was ghastly pale.

He only told her to open her eyes after they landed back in the store.

Su Lingyue had called back the Moonfrost Dragon. The contract between Su Ping and Su Lingyue was canceled automatically the moment they returned. That was a disposable item.

Without the contract, Su Ping felt he was instantly “distant” from Su Lingyue. Naturally, he would not keep her at a distance. However, the intimate and close bond was indeed less strong.

Even so, there were still some traces of that bond between them.

Su Ping’s view of his younger sister had changed a bit... He was looking at her as a girl for real.

“Now you know, right?” Su Ping asked casually.

Only then did Su Lingyue come back to her senses. She noticed that were back in the store.

Her mind was still wandering. The battle at that wild place was still fresh in her mind. The view was so shocking that she had been struck dumb.

As it turned out, that was the extent of the Moonfrost Dragon’s capability.

Her heart pounded. Finally, she could see why Su Ping was confident to announce that she would become the champion.

With such a horrifying dragon, even a pig would have won the championship!

Wait a minute.

Something didn’t sound right in those words. Even a pig? Su Lingyue shook her head. This trivial detail didn’t deserve her attention. She asked Su Ping, “Was everything that just happened real?”

Su Ping turned around so that he didn’t have to look into her eyes. She knew him too well. Somehow, he felt a bit afraid that she would tell he was lying. “You can say it’s partly true, partly fake. That place is not real but the battle is as real as it can get. You just witnessed the true power of the Moonfrost Dragon.”

“Are you... sure?”

Su Ping gave an affirmative answer. Su Lingyue felt her blood was boiling. Somehow, she was still unable to believe this.

At the same time, she noticed that the unusual feeling she had toward Su Ping was gone. Something was missing.

Su Lingyu’s cheeks turned rosy. What are you thinking? She asked herself.

All the closeness she felt toward Su Ping had to be an illusion!

It must be that fake scene that had twisted this guy’s look. That was the only reason that for a second there, she began to admire him!

ed

Yes! That explains it!

She nodded and was more convinced of this speculation-this was the only explanation that could work!

“The skills were not fake.”

Su Ping looked at her from the corner of his eye. “You’ve seen the Moonfrost Dragon use its skills. You can go to the test room and try them. But do remember not to wear your dragon out. You have matches tomorrow.”

“Right.”

Su Lingyue patted her head. Immediately, she ran away without wasting another second with Su Ping. Su Ping raised his eyebrows. She left without saying anything. What a pity. Indeed, she was more lovable when the contract was still in effect.

“Anyways.

“I can sign contracts with human beings. “That is to say, the pets that I can take into my store... include human beings.

“Doesn’t it mean that I can... train other battle pet warriors?”

This realization filled Su Ping with excitement. His eyes were glowing.

Yet soon, he thought of a much bigger problem.

He could take humans to the cultivation sites as he did with pets. Yet, humans were different from pets.

Humans were highly intelligent, they were sly, scheming, smart, and at the same time, greedy. If he were to take humans to the cultivation sites, the secrets of his store would be revealed, which could incur in huge troubles or even alert the federal government.

Sure, he could stay within the safety zone of the store. Yet, if the federal government were to be alerted, he would have made himself an enemy of the entire human society. He could not have curled up in the store for the rest of his life.

How troublesome that would be. “I think to the system, humans are like pets and can be trained. But training humans is obviously more bothersome than training

pets.”

Su Ping shook his head. He dismissed the idea of training humans.

He had taken a risk by taking Su Lingyue to a cultivation site.

She was his younger sister and he always thought she was not that smart so he could fool her.

However, he decided that he’d better not do this again. Otherwise, the secrets would be out sooner or later.

Su Lingyue came out from the test room.

Su Ping drove the thrilled Su Lingyue out of the store and told her to go back home and get some rest for the night.

Su Lingyue didn’t get any tangible reward and all she did was to experience the true power of the Moonfrost Dragon. But she felt this finding rewarding. She was just as excited as the first day she got the dragon.

Su Ping wanted to caution her and tell her to turn in early because of the match the next day. But seeing how worked up she was, he knew she was going to lose sleep that night.

Luckily, for a fifth-rank battle pet warrior, losing one night’s sleep was nothing.

Having gotten rid of Su Lingyue, Su Ping went to the test room and worked on his Fist of Exorcist to burn off some strength and then went to a nursing pen.

When he was physically exhausted, he would absorb astral powers at a speed one percent quicker than usual.

Joanna sat in another nursing pen, also cultivating.

The two of them spent a silent night.

The next day.

When Su Ping opened the door, to his surprise, he saw many customers waiting outside. Su Ping’s store didn’t have much business during the past couple of days. The fact that people, many people, would be waiting in line on a day of intense competition to decide the Top 100 winners was unexpected.

“Did something happen?” Su Ping asked a customer at the front of the line.

That was a student from the Phoenix Peak Academy and a repeated customer. Su Ping’s question caught him off guard. “Wh... what?” “Huh?”

“Well, I mean, nothing is happening.” “Then why are you here?” “...Well, I have money and time so I came here.”

IL

What a good reason. Su Ping couldn’t find any fault with that.

Then he asked a few more people and learned that they had failed to get tickets. It just so happened that recently, the academies and companies in the pet industry were giving people time off.

Therefore, they would have a lot of free time when they couldn’t go to the venue to watch the games. So, taking advantage of this time, they had gone to Su Ping’s store.

They could make it back to see the live streaming after they finished their transactions there.

Even if they couldn’t make it back home, they could watch it on their phones or go to some café and watch it there.

There were TVs or large screens set up for people to see the Elite League in many diners and supermarkets. Watching it in public places was better than being alone at home.

Su Ping realized that he should get a TV in his store as well.

That way, the customers wouldn’t have to hurry back and they could watch TV while they waited for their turns.

A TV set wouldn’t cost much. To better the store’s amenities so that more customers stayed for longer, on the other hand, could make him much more money.

Having decided this, Su Ping left the store to Joanna. She could take care of the customers. In the meantime, he went back home.

He saw that his mom was making breakfast in the kitchen. Su Lingyue appeared to have been unable to sleep the night before, because she was still fully dressed in the clothes from the day prior. She was bent over the table, with her hands fondling the fur of the Phantom Flame Beast that had shrunk down to a small size. She was lost in her thoughts, and would flash a silly grin every now and then.

That strange scene filled Su Ping with chills.

The boys in her class would never believe that their muse would grin in such a goofy way.
