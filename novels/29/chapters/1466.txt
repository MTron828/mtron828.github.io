Chapter 1467 Level-8 Store (2)

“Let me tell you a joke. Xiao Hua, the one I waited in line and trained, is so strong right now that I can’t beat her,” said another Celestial State cultivator, touching his nose. There was pride in his eyes, however. His Xiao Hua was already a peak Celestial pet, an ultimate creature not just anyone could have. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Be careful then. She might break free at some point.”

“Cut the crap. Xiao Hua has been with me for 100,000 years. She won’t betray me even if her level exceeds mine.”

In the meantime

At the pet store in the center of the Nine States.

There was only one pet store in that place. However, the whole city around the store was established because of it.

It wasn’t that the store was aiming to monopolize the business, and that others weren’t allowed to start a pet store. However, all the other pet stores had gone bankrupt due to the lack of customers.

“Get in line!”

“You’re a cyborg? Your father is a cyborg leader? Even your father has to wait in line if he comes.”

It was extremely crowded in front of the store. A yellow garbed Tang Ruyan was maintaining order. She had grown used to the strange-colored cyborgs in the past hundred years; however, she was much busier than when she only dealt with humans.

All humans knew that Su Ping owned the store, so they were extremely obedient, not even daring to talk loudly.

Cyborgs, however, didn’t show any respect, and they didn’t know the rules. There were many who came from afar and asked for privileges.

All of them were rejected by Tang Ruyan without exception.

Even the human Celestials had to wait in line, let alone the humanoids.

At first, she was afraid that her refusals would make the human’s situation worse. However, she knew she had worried for nothing when Su Ping kicked out a cyborg who was causing trouble.

She was only talking “nicely.” She was quite gentle compared to him.

“Get lost! It doesn’t matter how much money you give me. Get in line, or get lost!”

“Treasures? What treasures? You think I’ve never seen treasures? Whatever you may offer, just take it away and get lost!”

“My attitude is terrible? You think my attitude is terrible?!”

Many cyborgs suffered Tang Ruyan rejections. Some of them despised her after learning that she was just an employee, then claimed that they would complain to her boss.

However, once they finally got in after waiting for a long time… they were thrown out and asked to get in line again before they were done criticizing that arrogant employee. Some of the regular cyborg customers talked to their compatriots the moment they saw them yelling. “Why do you have to ask for their money? Given your capabilities, you can create any precious item, including currency, right?”

Inside the store-Su Ping was seated in a room next to the Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon and the other pets. On his right side was a glowing silver ball.

That ball was the system.

Many functions had been added when the store was upgraded to level 8. The manifestation of the system was one of them.

As for the usage of that ball… Su Ping found it was useless, except that it felt good when he squeezed it.

Nevertheless, he thought that squeezing that ball was truly satisfying. He could finally make that perverted peeper experience his revenge!

That’s right. The store had successfully risen to level 8 in the past hundred years, thanks to Joanna and the others’ efforts.

Accumulating energy was not that difficult. It was mainly because Su Ping had met the requirement for the level 8 upgrade… To train a special-grade pet with a Dao Heart.

The Dao Heart State was the universe dominator state.

Su Ping had actually spent a thousand years in cultivation sites during that century.

The Inferno Dragon was the first to acquire a Dao Heart.

He didn’t give his pets the three unparalleled Dao Hearts that the Golden Crow ancestor had offered him. He asked them to walk their own roads, even if it wasn’t as good. Maybe they would be awakened once more and their Dao Hearts would further evolve.

Evolution would be impossible if they inherited someone else’s Dao Heart.

The Inferno Dragon became a universe dominator once it acquired the Dao Heart. Its combat ability was significantly improved. Even the God Emperors of some major clans were no match.

Thanks to the stimulation of Su Ping’s power of chaos, the Inferno Dragon’s bloodline had mutated, becoming a demi-chaos creature. It was also the reason why its talent easily surpassed the special-grade, and was right before the 300th among the Dao Heart State dragons listed on the system’s ranking.

There were no more than three hundred dragons stronger than the Inferno Dragon in the Dao Heart State.

Countless dragons of that level had been born in history. The fact that it was close to the top 300 suggested that it was one of the strongest in that era.

IS O

The following training made its ranking rise to somewhere around the 240th.

Aside from the Inferno Dragon, the Dark Dragon Hound and the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon had found their Dao Hearts, too. The Lightning Rat was the only one that had yet to attain a Dao Heart.

Even though it was the last pet to follow Su Ping, the Lightning Rat was actually as strong as the Dark Dragon Hound and the others. It had once found a Dao Heart, but chose not to pick it, as it didn’t seem to be what it truly wanted.

Therefore, the rodent was still stuck in the Celestial State.

“The currency is just a tool.” The system’s young yet mature voice came from the silver glowing ball. “It’s only meant to measure the number of pets you’ve trained.”

“You’re obviously very powerful. Why do you have to do something so boring?” Su Ping asked back.

“Humph. You think it’s boring? I think it’s very fun,” said the system angrily.

“Is there anything you’re scared of in this world? The Heavens?” Su Ping asked again.

“Don’t ask. The answer’s no.” Although it was just a silver glowing ball, Su Ping felt that it glittered as if rolling eyes at him. “You’ll know everything when you upgrade the store to level 9.”

“Can’t you tell me in advance?” said Su Ping helplessly, “Why do you have to be so stubborn?”

“I’m afraid that your universe will explode in fright if I tell you right now. Let’s wait until you reach the Undying State,” said the system in disdain.

“You’re kidding. What can possibly frighten me? Unless, you tell me that you’re not the system, but some gay,” said Su Ping.

The system said casually, “Why can’t I be

gay?”

Su Ping almost fell. He realized that the system was becoming chattier after it manifested. It was no longer like the old system; it was something… meaner.

“If you don’t want to tell, so be it. I’m very close to that state anyway.” Su Ping stopped asking.. He had found several cultivation methods to attain the Undying State over the past hundred years; all he had to do was confirm them.

Su Ping left the store and went to the Golden Crow world.

Everything was the same. Su Ping teleported to a desert. He spread his senses and soon discovered powerful auras in a certain direction, which was clearly the Golden Crows habitat.

He summoned the Dark Dragon Hound and the others to travel with them.

Su Ping was soon able to sense an exuberant power of vitality further ahead. Once he got closer, he discovered that it originated from the tree where the Golden Crows lived.

This holy tree is probably in the Undying State too…

Su Ping didn’t consider the holy tree an object. Although he was unable to sense its consciousness, he knew that the holy tree would surely unleash the power of the Golden Crow elders if they were attacked.

Su Ping’s arrival was soon noticed by the Golden Crows, who had already become quite familiar with him. One of the Golden Crows immediately showed up and asked him why he was there to go and report the matter.

Su Ping met the Golden Crows’ Chief Elder soon after.

“Young friend, what brings you here this time?” asked the Chief Elder with a smile.

Su Ping said, “I’d like to experience your universe, Chief Elder.”
