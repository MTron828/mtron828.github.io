Chapter 438 A Slap in the Face

Three young men were watching the match while seated in an area with a wide view. One of the young men with a brush cut clapped his hands suddenly and shouted in excitement, “It’s getting down! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Brother Xiao, I think Feng Yiliang is gonna win!”

Sitting next to him was a good-looking young man wearing a blue shirt and a designer’s watch. Putting on a faint smile, the young man said, “Feng’s taming skill is at the sixth rank and is one of the Top 5 students in our year. Taming this fifth-rank Shortwinged Tiger that is not particularly violent shouldn’t take him more than 10 minutes.”

The young man with the brush cut forced a smile. “Brother Xiao, don’t make a judgment according to your crazy standards. This Shortwinged Tiger is not violent... Remember never to say this back in school. The other students would be pissed!” I don’t think a fifth-rank taming skill could have contained the tiger. I might fail if I were up there on the stage.

The blue-shirted young man shook his head.

Right then, he heard a pleasant voice. “Senior Xiao!”

The three boys turned around and the sight of two pretty girls landed in their eyes.

Xiao Fengxu remained surprised for one second before he recognized them. “Kong Lingling and Hu Rongrong from Grade Two?”

“Yes!”

Kong Lingling was happy since Xiao Fengxu knew her name. He was the star student in the academy. It was a surprise that he would remember them.

“Nice to meet you,” Hu Rongrong greeted him with respect.

“Very happy to see you two here!”

“Welcome!”

The young man in the brush cut and the other smaller young man came back to their senses. They gladly invited the girls to take a seat. The three young men then noticed Su Ping who was standing behind the two girls. “And this is your classmate?”

Kong Lingling shook her head. “He’s not from our academy. Hu Rongrong was kind enough to invite him to join us.” The young man with the brush cut asked Hu Rongrong, “Friend of yours?”

Before Hu Rongrong could answer, Kong Lingling had beaten her to it. “He’s an elementary trainer from another base city, just visiting to broaden his mind. He has no invitation so Rongrong took him inside with us.”

The young men understood. They just invited the girls to sit down again without speaking to Su Ping again. Wow!

All of a sudden, the crowd cheered.

Everyone shifted their focus to the stage. The judge stepped on the stage. He pointed the red flag in his hand to one of the two contenders and announced, “Winner, Feng Yiliang!”

The audience burst into shouts.

Kong Lingling asked in surprise, “Is that Senior Feng up there on the stage?”

Hu Rongrong didn’t seem to expect this, either. She could already see the person standing on the stage. True, it was Feng Yiliang from their academy, not someone that just happened to share the same name.

“This is just a game, an interesting game,” The young man with the brush cut said, “The Trainers Assembly is going to start. He’s here to get familiar with the stage and practice.”

“Senior Xiao, you’re not participating?” Kong Lingling asked Xiao Fengxu with ardent admiration in her eyes.

Xiao Fengxu smiled. “I haven’t gotten the time to sign up yet.”

The young man with the brush cut laughed. “Kong, that’s not a good question. Our Brother Xiao would only be bullying others if he took part in the matches.”

Kong Lingling covered her mouth and giggled.

Xiao Fengxu darted a glare at the young man with the brush cut and produced a forced smile.

Su Ping found himself a seat. The view was quite good. He could see the entire stage clearly. However, before he could understand what was going on, the competition had ended and one side had won. He was quite confused. Hu Rongrong was sitting nearby. Noticing his confusion, Hu Rongrong whispered, “They’re competing in taming skills. The two battle pets on the stage are wild and have no contract with anyone yet. Of the two, anyone who can tame the battle pet first, then make the battle pet pick up the meat and keep it in its mouth without spitting out is the winner.”

Her explanation cleared up Su Ping’s confusion. He noticed that there was a piece of fresh meat placed in front of the battle pets.

“I see,” Su Ping said.

He had another question, though. “Are taming skills a must for trainers?”

Hu Rongrong strangely eyed him. “Of course. Haven’t you learned taming skills? Even an elementary trainer should...”

1 an

She did not finish her words but she had made herself perfectly clear.

Su Ping was a bit embarrassed. Indeed, he had not taken any pet trainer lessons. He thought trainers just needed to train pets to have them learn some skill or to make them stronger.

“Some battle pets are born to be violent and they will show this side of themselves when they’re not controlled by their masters. Without a taming skill, people would need to use some potion to contain the violent side of their battle pets, but the potions have side effects. Therefore, taming skills are necessary and a must for any qualified trainer!” Hu Rongrong explained to Su Ping solemnly.

Su Ping could tell that she truly attached great importance to battle pets. He nodded at her.

Kong Lingling heard the conversation. She thought of something. “So, do trainers not have to learn those basic skills in other base cities? I heard that trainers in some base cities tend to go overboard on one or two subjects and cannot be regarded as qualified trainers!” Kong Lingling said with contempt.

Hu Rongrong frowned. She cast a glance at Su Ping but said nothing.

It was usually the case in some base cities with limited resources that trainers could merely learn part of the skill sets. Hu Rongrong was aware of that but didn’t approve of such practice.

Whoosh!

All of a sudden, a person hopped off the stage and landed in front of them. It was a young man who had just won.

“Rongrong!”

The young man’s eyes glowed the moment he saw Hu Rongrong. He didn’t even greet Xiao Fengxu and the others before he dashed to Hu Rongrong’s side directly. “Why are you here?” he asked, full of happiness.

Hu Rongrong was not happy to hear this intimate form of address. “Senior Feng, I’m here to watch the games,” she said with a frown.

“Is that so? Did you see? I just won!” Feng Yiliang grinned from ear to ear. Winning had put him in a good mood already. Seeing the girl that he liked sitting there had made him feel better than ever before.

Hu Rongrong produced a forced smile. She moved back a bit as she said, “Congratulations, Senior Feng.”

Feng Yiliang smiled. He turned to Su Ping sitting next to her and asked, “Rongrong, is he a friend of yours?”

Just then, he had seen Hu Rongrong talking to Su Ping from the stage. So, Feng Yiliang was not happy about Su Ping being there. Su Ping noticed the hostility in Feng Yiliang’s eyes. He wasn’t interested in Hu Rongrong in a romantic way, just grateful.

Knowing that Feng Yiliang had his heart on Hu Rongrong, Kong Lingling hurried to explain to her friend, “Senior Feng, this is a misunderstanding. We met him by the door and he wanted to watch the games so Rongrong invited him in.”

That explains it. Feng Yiliang rolled his eyes at Su Ping. “Why are you sitting here if you’re a stranger? Piss off!”

Su Ping was surprised.

He squinted his eyes. “I’ll give you a chance to apologize to me since all of you are fellow students in the same academy.”

“What?”

Feng Yiliang stood up and looked down at Su Ping. “What did you just say? Say that again to me!”

Hu Rongrong turned pale. “What are you doing? He didn’t do anything to you,” She scolded Feng Yiliang. Xiao Fengxu tried to break up the argument as well. “Feng, settle down.”

The young man with the brush cut and the smaller young man hurried to grab Feng Yiliang’s sleeves. The young man with the brush cut waved his other hand to Su Ping. “Bro, hurry and go. We cannot stop him for very long.”

It never occurred to Kong Lingling that they would get into an argument. “Go, now! Senior Feng is a sixth-rank trainer. You cannot defeat him,” she persuaded Su Ping. Su Ping remained seated but he pulled a long face. “Don’t blame for what is going to happen next, now that you’ve lost your chance.”

With that said, Su Ping stood up.

“What? Do you think you can fight me?” Feng Yiliang couldn’t help but sneer.

Pah.

The sneer stopped. A slap landed on his face. Then, head first and body second, Feng Yiliang fell into the seat by his side.
