Chapter 1551: Slaying the Dragon (1)

“We were already determined to die before we came. Please give us your orders, Dao Ancestor!” said an Undying State expert with a loud voice.

“Just say the word, Dao Ancestor. We will definitely comply!”

“Our clan was destroyed and our home was taken… We’ve got nothing to lose. Dao Ancestor, please lead us to a new life!”

Many more of the Undying State experts voiced their stance, all of them beaming with killing intent. They disliked war; however, they were deeply involved because of circumstance. Given their high cultivation, they had already realized they would die, whether they retreated or evaded. So, it would be better to fight for a chance to survive!

“All right!”

Su Ping nodded. He took a deep breath. He didn’t gather the Undying State experts sooner because he was concerned for their clans if they were relocated, to inevitably become cannon fodder due to lack of leadership. However, enough sacrifices had been made.

Su Ping said slowly, “Everyone, please lend me your strength!”

Three thousand universes appeared behind him, each forming a warship. His thoughts were transmitted to the others. “Everybody, please board the warships and fight with me!”

The experts were puzzled, but there was no time to ask questions, so they quickly complied.

Once entering the vessels, the effect of Su Ping’s Contract Dao Heart was spread throughout the warships, connecting to all their minds.

The experts instantly realized his purpose upon sensing the bonding will. The interaction of their souls was utterly smooth and perfect. The most genuine feelings were fused at the moment. All of them could feel Su Ping’s enormous anger and grief!

“Disciple…”

Amongst the crowd—Shen Huang and the other human experts had broken free and boarded the warships.

Even if the Dao Heart State beings weren’t the strongest, they were still pillars on the battlefield.

All the fighters felt shocked upon sensing Su Ping’s vast and enormous willpower, as well as his intense emotions. They never knew that their leader would have such an emotional heart, even after spending such a long time with him.

There was no hesitation; they chose to accept the bond at the fastest speed possible. They opened themselves without reserve, allowing Su Ping to use their power.

That power was at a level they had never dreamed of. As long as Su Ping was willing, he could deprive them of all their power with a thought, yet none of them hesitated.

More and more Undying State experts from all species arrived, and the three thousand warships were once more filled with people. The Contract Dao Heart power was spread in all the warships, and Su Ping could feel that many more scorching spots of light were connected to his soul, each belonging to an expert who had accepted the contract.

The surging power flowed and gathered like rivers. The power was so immense it was like the scorching sun. Su Ping’s body was shaking; the power filled his limbs and internal organs.

Although unable to bond with the Ancestral Land of Chaos, his aura was rising at an unimaginable speed because of the external surge of strength.

“Huh?”

Yuan Long instantly noticed Su Ping’s change. Being one of the masters of the Great Dao, he was easily able to reason out what was happening; there was disdain in his eyes. “Ants will always be ants. You think you can resist me just by working together?”

He dove and charged at Su Ping again, ready to tear him apart in front of everyone.

There was more power gathered in Su Ping’s body than ever before. He roared loudly and slashed with his sword.

An infinite amount of power was extracted from the three thousand warships. The sword aura seemed to be powerful enough to cut chaos itself apart. There was a boom; Su Ping’s sword left a cut in Yuan Long’s head and forced his enormous body to a stop!

Yuan Long roared furiously. Su Ping’s sword was as small as a toothpick in his eyes. However, he now felt that he had struck an iron plate, which shocked and infuriated him. Su Ping’s strength was actually threatening to him at the moment.

“You’re just ants. What can you possibly do, even if there are many of you?!” Yuan Long roared. A flattened, black vortex suddenly appeared next to his chest; the time and space within seemed twisted. An unknown aura suddenly wrapped Su Ping and the three thousand warships, isolating them from the battlefield. It was Yuan Long’s Dragon Prison!

Su Ping felt somewhat dazed. Back at the site, he had been trapped in the Dragon Prison by the system. Everything was an illusion controlled by the system, as if deliberately showing him all those things in the Remains of High Heavens.

He was now in the real Dragon Prison.

However, it felt no different from the one he had seen in the cultivation site.

If anything, it was even weaker.

“This thing cannot stop me!”

Su Ping coldly swung his sword. The dazzling sword aura immediately slashed open a million prison floors. None of the Great Daos which made them were able to resist.

His sword went high into the sky and deep down into the bottom of the Dragon Prison. The auras of the imprisoned mythical creatures were revealed as the deepest part of the prison was cut open. There were actually Undying State creatures from the other Sorcerer Ancestors’ bloodlines.

“What’s going on?”

“The Dragon Prison… has been broken?”

Some of the mythical creatures had been sleeping, while others were merely thinking. However, all were woken up by the loud noises. The brilliant sword aura was like the first ray of light cutting chaos open, illuminating their long and lonely lives.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
