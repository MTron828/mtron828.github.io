Chapter 135 The Might of a Dragon

“I’m taking you on next!”

Luo Fengtian fully exposed his astral power and summoned his pet space. An astral vortex rose from his chest, from which a symbolic roar that suggested a formidable dragon monster was heard.

A dragon’s head slowly emerged from the vortex, followed by its glossy neck protected by lustrous black scales and spikes. By the time its entire body had moved out of the pet space, the creature had blocked most sunlight from everyone with its large wings. It was an adult dragon-type Astral Pet. To be precise, it was a Black Pit Dragon, one of the stronger species among all dragon-types who loved feeding on wounded prey that were still breathing

Luo Fengtian’s teammates were clearly not strangers to the dragon, who only looked a bit surprised by Luo Fengtian’s decision. Then they quickly retreated somewhere farther so they didn’t get hurt by whatever was coming next.

Su Ping felt the mighty aura of the dragon and also looked that way, though the impassive killing intent in his eyes never went away. He had defeated countless dragon souls created by a dragon king in the dragon tower, all of whom carried doughty auras as deadly as the one he felt from this black dragon, if not stronger. Using his experience, Su Ping quickly recognized the Black Pit Dragon as a seventh-rank Astral Pet. But unlike Ye Hao’s Thunder Basilisk, this dragon possessed a far superior bloodline. “Luo-Boss, are you sure about this?” a man watching nearby stuttered, “Someone’s gonna die.”

He immediately stepped down in fear when he saw the dragon looking at him.

Luo Fengtian didn’t answer, for he had to stay fully concentrated in order to hold his Black Pit Dragon under control.

“I’ll give you one chance to surrender and apologize,” he told Su Ping in a low voice.

Su Ping looked away from the dragon and gazed at Luo Fengtian. He was confident that he could take down Luo Fengtian by force. But that would prove to be difficult with the dragon in the way. The rational nature of a battle pet warrior soon kicked in, telling him the correct course of action. With a flicker of his mind, Su Ping’s pet space opened up, by which time all people present heard a dragon roar once again, which surprised them more than the last time.

They saw another dragon head entering their view from Su Ping’s pet space, which looked as ferocious as the black dragon. Although this one had smaller, crimson scales that looked like agate gems instead.

As soon as the second dragon reached the exterior, the entire ground outside the academy gate was bathed under a strong smell of blood, as if a brutal war had just passed through The ground quaked as the dragon landed its claws on the ground. It then spread its red wings and aroused a forceful gale mixed with the smell of blood and sulfur that infiltrated everyone’s nostrils.

The Inferno Dragon lifted its head higher and howled into the sky, causing several stray embers to come off its scaled body.

Those brave enough to watch stared in awe as they both admired and feared one of the strongest dragon-type Astral Pets known to that day. No one had recently checked the “dragon ranking list,” though they were sure an Inferno Dragon was better than a Black Pit Dragon.

Dragons were already rare in this world. Being one rank lower meant a Black Pit Dragon would fall very far behind when it came to direct confrontations. This was already proven as the Black Pit Dragon no longer looked proud and noble against the presence of a rival. Currently, it was silently gazing at the Inferno Dragon as carefully as it could.

As soon as the Inferno Dragon fully left Su Ping’s pet space, the Black Pit Dragon braced itself in fear. Its loose and slackened scales were firmly clasped against its skin; this was a typical reaction of dragons who felt threatened.

Luo Fengtian, on the other hand, had his solid stance completely broken down as he saw what was happening. Before this day, he thought that his Black Pit Dragon had no rivals in the entire Longjiang City. With its help, he could do whatever he saw fit as long as he didn’t provoke a legendary pet warrior.

But he just saw otherwise. He knew an Inferno Dragon was rarer, mightier and more precious compared to his black dragon. Since both dragons were adults, they didn’t need to fight to know the result.

Since it was known by humans, the status and strengths of dragons were always highly restricted by their “social ranks,” rather than their growth and techniques. A lower dragon had zero chances of fighting against a superior one. They either backed away, or became food.

The field remained quiet for a long while as nobody made a sound. Whereas the Black Pit Dragon was still assessing the situation warily, the Inferno Dragon appeared rather relaxed. More like, it had not attacked just because Su Ping didn’t allow it to yet.

The Inferno Dragon spent most of its early days under the constant pressure of a dragon king’s soul. A mere Black Pit Dragon was nothing to be afraid of.

Right then, the visiting students could only hear their own heartbeats, as they madly questioned what was going on in front of their eyes.

They did their research before coming, yet they never found anything about an Inferno Dragon. If a student in this academy owned an Inferno Dragon, then how did Ye Hao become the champion?

As one, they reached the same conclusion, that Su Ping had to be a “secret weapon” of the Phoenix Peak Academy. By some terrible coincidence, they happened to bump into such a scary foe. Even their “boss” was hopeless on this occasion.

They probably wouldn’t win even if they confronted this Inferno Dragon together. And it wasn’t like such a victory was something worth talking about, if they somehow made it through. Of course, Dai Yan was the most regretful soul blaming his foolish actions at the back of his team. He only hoped that everything would pass quickly so they would all forget about it. He didn’t know what his other friends thought, but he was willing to give up his ego just to get out of there.

Luo Fengtian was the first one to break the silence. That handsome and confident look of his was replaced by that of a complete defeat.

“I lost. We are sorry.”

Meanwhile, he recalled his Black Pit Dragon. The dragon never liked the narrow pet space, but right at that moment, it chose to dive back inside without a second thought.

Su Ping looked around and saw everyone dodging his gaze, which meant he was finally free to leave.

*Sigh*

Why must people talk things through with violence?

He couldn’t say he liked it. But that was how this world worked.

Su Ping shook his head, called back his Inferno Dragon, and left on his bicycle.

The front gate of the academy was again peaceful, provided that people didn’t mind the cracked floor, the wounded bear and its master, who didn’t look well, either.

The students looked at Su Ping’s totally innocuous image and couldn’t help but tremble again.

One of them spoke to Luo Fengtian with chattering teeth, “Boss... Will we still participate in their pet contest?”

Those words almost made everyone jump.

Pet contest? They didn’t even know whether they could stand in front of that Inferno Dragon without flinching.

Luo Fengtian’s cheek twitched; he didn’t answer.

As the students took some time wallowing about their saddening defeat, a luxurious-looking vehicle entered their view and stopped in front of the academy gate. Three figures stepped off from the car-a white-haired man near his sixties, a middle-aged man in a plain uniform suit, and a young teenage lady wearing a casual, denim top who was smiling sweetly.

The students quickly went out of their way to address them.

“Mister Vice Principal!”

“Hello, Director.”

The old man returned a kind smile. “Sorry to keep you waiting, my boys. Do your best over there. I’ll be cheering.”

The encouraging words further contributed to their embarrassment.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
