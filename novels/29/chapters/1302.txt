Chapter 1303 The Lost Power (2)

There wouldn’t be any favorable rules in the Dao Child competition because his level was lower. Fairness was the Heaven Path Institute’s main principle.

The audience was silent for a moment when Qing Mu left, but cheers burst out shortly after. Many people shouted Su Ping’s name and even his race.

“Human Su Ping!”

“Human talent!”

They shouted Su Ping’s name and race, the sounds echoing throughout the field.

Although most of the people shouting belonged to the middle-ranked clans—and only a few were from high-ranked ones-it was still a splendid scene.

“He really did it!”

“He fought three at the same time and won. It’s a miracle. He also managed to pass the candidates’ competition. If he becomes a Dao Child… his legend will be sung over in the institute.”

“Senior Brother Qing Mu tried. What a shame.”

The other candidates heaved sighs, knowing that another genius would emerge in the institute and receive the world’s attention.

Even if Su Ping failed the challenge, his potential was unquestionable; he would be welcomed by many major forces.

“Damn it!”

Zhan Wushuang clenched his fists with an awful expression, not expecting that Qing Mu would fail to deal with Su Ping. The guy is truly standing out in the world of gods!

“Why did my family elders allow him to return to the institute instead of killing him?” Zhan Wushuang felt puzzled and dissatisfied with the emperors of his family. Were they all training in seclusion, never thinking that this human was a big deal? If so, how stupid of them!

Even he had to admit that the human would cause trouble to the Rain Clan with his terrifying potential.

Su Ping had the potential of becoming a God Emperor!

Once he did become one, considering his potential, he could easily fight against two peers. It would equate to saying that humankind would have two more God Emperors!

Although the Rain Clan had an Ancestral God, such a being would spend most of the time meditating in seclusion, not waking up unless the clan was in grave danger. Ancestral Gods were like sheathed swords, merely used to intimidate others with their sharpness!

Su Ping heard the cheers and looked around, suddenly having a sense of belonging in the Heaven Path Institute. He would be accepted and remembered in that place.

Choosing not to pause even for a moment, he went straight to the sky above the battlefield and asked the elders outside, “When will I challenge the Dao Children?”

The big-headed child said teasingly, “You seem quite eager. Don’t you need to prepare yourself?”

“I’m already prepared. I can fight them anytime,” said Su Ping.

The child-like elder felt dazed. He was just joking, but it seemed that the human was serious in continuing. After having fought for such a long time-even though Su Ping’s strength remained in his prime state-he might not have the best state of mind.

“No need to be so hasty. Take some rest and get to know some more about the three Dao Children; see which of them you want to challenge,” said the big-headed child, “The challenge will proceed in three days.”

“I have to wait for three more days…”

Su Ping frowned a bit, but he could only accept the arrangement. “All right then.” The child elder shook his head with a smile, seeing the human’s reluctance. The choice was made purely for Su Ping’s sake; after all, three days might not be enough for him to know enough about the three Dao Children.

“You can spend this time at my place,” said the young man with a smile.

Su Ping glanced at him and nodded. “All right. Thank you, elder.”

The young man smiled and waved goodbye at the others. Then, he tore the void and led Su Ping out of the Oceanic Universe of Clouds.

“He’ll probably tell him every last secret of the three Dao Children.” One of the elders couldn’t help but smile.

“Old Chan loves humans. Besides, this guy has extraordinary potential; it’s only right to give him a hand,” said Yan Huang casually. Then, she turned around and faded away.

As if taking it as a cue, the others smiled and left respectively.

“It’s time to inform the Dao Children who have been training in seclusion; they haven’t felt any pressure in a long time,” mumbled the big-headed child with a teasing smile.

Su Ping soon returned to the Toad Fish Palace with the young man.

As they made their way over, the young man pointed casually, “That’s the Dao Monument. If you want to study it, you can go there whenever you wish.”

Many students were sitting around the monument. It was the black monument that Su Ping had seen during his first visit.

“Thank you, elder.” Su Ping nodded, although he wasn’t planning on going there. He had yet to work on parsing the original Dao Glyphs in his body; the monument wouldn’t be necessary.

The young man didn’t insist, noticing that Su Ping wasn’t interested. He simply said, “The institute’s three Dao Children are Qian Hong, Shen Mo and Chen Xi.

“Qian Hong is the strongest of them. As for the other two, I suggest you challenge Chen Xi. He was the Dao Child who defeated Qing Mu, and is the weakest of the three. But that’s just relative; he is definitely much stronger than Qing Mu.”

Su Ping understood that the guy was passing him notes. He made note of this and said, “Thank you for the recommendation, elder.”

“That’s all right.” The young man waved a hand unconcernedly. “I will provide you with information about Chen Xi; better study him carefully. Don’t be careless; he’s been a God King for years and you’re not even one yet. This major level gap is hard to solve. I don’t know how you condensed a universe, but you definitely had your own luck.

“There have been geniuses who condensed small universes before becoming God Kings, but they weren’t as strong as the real God Kings.”

“Yes.”

Su Ping nodded.

They soon entered a side palace where an energy array was established. The divine power was so abundant that Su Ping felt as if he were again inside one of the Divine Eyes. He felt he could break through at any moment when the divine power entered his body.

He held back the urge, though, as he didn’t really want to improve his level just yet. His current power enabled him to suppress and kill many God Kings, even though he was only an Ascendant.

Instead of breaking through, Su Ping was more interested in the cultivation of his small universe.

According to the Chaos Star Chart, he was aiming for the Dao Heart State.

The Oceanic Universe of Clouds he had experienced earlier gave him an idea for his next direction.

“You may cultivate here in the coming days. I’ll give you some presents later,” said the young man.

Su Ping quickly offered his thanks. He then remembered Qing Mu and asked curiously, “Elder, do you know where Qing Mu obtained the dark power he used in the end?”

The young man was not surprised. He chuckled and said, “Qing Mu got it from a forbidden area, inside an ancient corpse, but I don’t know the details. Still, the power is unique; I have a rough idea about the source of such power. It doesn’t belong to this age and is already lost.”

“A lost power?” Su Ping was stunned.

“According to ancient records, and in the notes left by Ancestral Gods, a great war took place in the age of chaos. One of the forces in the war harnessed such power.” The young man chuckled and continued, “However, those existences disappeared along with the mythical creatures from that age. They are no more.”

“A power from the age of chaos…”

Su Ping felt dazed. He remembered the black hand reaching in from beyond the crack in the universe. Could it be a creature from the age of chaos?

“Elder, is there any possibility for any of those creatures to survive?” Su Ping couldn’t help but ask.

The young man shook his head. “It’s uncertain… Maybe, maybe not, but nobody has found anything yet. Why? Did you encounter any god using that kind of power?”

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. In the end he didn’t mention a thing about the universe he came from. That was his greatest secret anyway. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“If you want to know more about those existences, I’ll ask someone to gather information for you. You’ll be free to have a look after you challenge the Dao Child,” said the young man to Su Ping.

“Thank you very much, elder,” said Su Ping quickly.

The other said rather helplessly, “Better focus on challenging the Dao Child for now.”
