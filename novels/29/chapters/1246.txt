Chapter 1248 Decline of the Sinning Land

In any case, he must be killed to avoid any future trouble!

Kayafollet made up her mind. There was no room for underestimation, considering the mysterious demonic store and the potential shown by Su Ping.

He had a mysterious chaos creature as a pet, and he could crush Ascendants after cultivating for less than a hundred years. Most importantly, he was only a Star Lord!

Given a few hundred years, she had no doubt that he would change significantly.

Whoosh!

Kayafollet flashed out of the ancient corpse after confining the Ascendant she questioned and throwing him into her small world.

Hardly had she stepped out of the ancient corpse when she sensed an immense power in the void above her. It felt like a million mountains on her shoulders, making it hard for her to walk.

That power quickly seeped into her body as countless threads that sealed her pores like iron nails, preventing her from unleashing her energy.

Is this what shackles Celestial power while in the Mayhem Star Zone? It was the first time for her to ever experience the power of that restriction. She had received the legacy and risen to the Celestial State, then passed a tribulation in the other space, which seemed to be the ancient corpse’s mental space, or maybe another universe.

My power… has been suppressed.

Kayafollet tried to unleash her power, only to discover that she couldn’t use the small universe that she had just gained. That was one of her most powerful tools after the advancement, but she couldn’t make use of it. She finally understood why Celestials and the old fellows from the Planet of Origin were always reluctant to visit.

If they ever entered, they would be no different from Heavenly Lords.

None of their Celestial treasures would release their destructiveness.

They could die if a group of Heavenly Lords ganged up on them!

“This barrier…”

Kayafollet looked up at the mysterious void above her, sensing that the sky in the entire area had been blocked by an ancient power. The entire Mayhem Star Zone was covered with it. It was hard to imagine who had created such a barrier.

However, she was no longer an Ascendant, and her newfound power allowed her to notice the barrier.

The Mayhem Star Zone would no longer be a forbidden land for Celestials if I destroy it!

Kayafollet’s eyes glittered. She gazed at the sky for a while and took a deep breath, as if having made a decision. She turned around and returned to the ancient corpse.

“In any case, I have to kill him. I cannot let him return to the demonic store!” She was determined to get rid of Su Ping, not just because he had stolen part of her legacy, but because she would never sleep in peace again, knowing that a genius enemy like him was out there. She would surely become a universe dominator in a thousand years!

However… Su Ping would be like a sting in her heart, making her feel uneasy. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if she had to pay some price, she had to get rid of him to avoid future troubles!

Kayafollet returned to the legacy space inside the corpse’s skull.

She raised a hand and closed the space, locking herself inside. The next moment-she glowed brilliantly and illuminated the entire space. Her light was connected to the surrounding space, as if extending billions of tentacles.

“You must be powerful enough to destroy this barrier!”

Cold madness flashed in Kayafollet’s eyes. She was going to make use of the ancient corpse’s power to break the barrier over the Mayhem Star Zone!

The forbidden land would no longer be a safe haven; those criminals would have nowhere else to go!

Boom!

Outside of the ancient corpse-the void shook and tides of energy were spreading out.

All the buildings in the City of Sins were shaking. The laws in the buildings were crumbling. They were about to fall apart.

To everyone’s astonishment, the formerly inert corpse began to move and bend its back like a black mountain.

Is the ancient corpse coming back to life?

All the adventurers on their way to explore the corpse stopped and looked at the scene in shock.

The people rushing towards the City of Sin also heard the loud noises behind them. They looked back and witnessed an appalling scene; their eyes widened with fear.

Su Ping had reached the sky above the City of Sins; he felt the unusual danger behind his back and turned around. He saw the moving corpse in the distance while using his eyes of chaos, then had a premonition.

Is it reviving? That’s impossible. The woman must be behind all this!

Su Ping slightly changed his expression. Was it possible to use the ancient corpse after receiving the legacy? Not only did the ancient being leave a legacy, he even turned himself into part of the legacy? How considerate!

“Will the woman use the corpse like a Gund** mecha and chase after me?” The idea occurred to him while running toward the City of Sins without stopping. He had to reach the teleportation point and go back to his store in the Golden Star Zone as soon as possible.

Su Ping turned around and observed the ancient corpse, noticing that the gigantic body had already sat up. It was extremely slow, though, which gave him some relief.

She’s harnessing the corpse’s power, which means that she’s still restricted in this star zone and she doesn’t dare to chase me directly. She fears that I can kill her in a battle restricted to the Ascendant level, Su Ping thought.

He then saw that the ancient corpse raised an arm and pointed at the sky above.

Su Ping was rather astonished.

The next moment—a stream of dark power dashed out toward the sky, like a sword thousands of meters long!

It was a shocking and unforgettable image!

The dark sword cut through the sky, as if announcing the return of the king who had been dead for a billion years!

Su Ping didn’t see any casualties or unusual reactions in the sky above; however, he couldn’t have felt more ill at ease. There were goosebumps all over his body, a clear sign that his body had foreseen danger. He suddenly realized something and felt a chill.

“What is going on?”

Song Yuan and the other Heavenly Lords saw the ancient corpse’s attack. They were shocked and confused, but some of them were quick to realize what was going on and their expressions changed.

“Did it destroy the barrier above the Mayhem Star Zone?”

Everyone was shocked and frightened. They looked around, as if lethal dangers would pop up in the void at any time.

Indeed. The twelve Celestials would probably arrive at a moment’s notice if the barrier was destroyed. If the hostile ones came first… they would surely use the chance to squash their enemies.

Song Yuan and the others were pale; they had no time to consider why the ancient corpse was trying to destroy the barrier. Everyone looked around, fearing that the powerhouses from the Heavenly Devil Alliance would show up. They were Heavenly Lords who had claimed the ability to escape from a Celestial expert’s pursuit, on the premise that said expert wasn’t trying their best.

It wouldn’t be that hard to get rid of them if said Celestial was willing to pay a price!

Getting to the bottom of it, the so-called Heavenly Lords were just Ascendant cultivators!

No one except Su Ping could fight Ascendants while being a Star Lord. The gap between Ascendants and Celestials was even greater.

The ancient corpse’s arm descended, but the body retained the sitting posture. A figure dashed out from one of its ears. It was none other than Kayafollet.

Hardly had she left the ancient corpse when she discovered that the former pressure was gone. There was an infinite source of power inside her body.

She couldn’t help but take a deep breath. Even the air felt sweet somehow.

That sensation was truly wonderful. She looked into the distance; countless laws were separated like a tide in her eyes. The time and space in between was ignored. She quickly found Su Ping running towards the City of Sins with a mere glimpse. She loathed the sight of him, even though she was only looking at his back.

“You’re doomed!”

Kayafollet put on a smile and vanished. The swallowing law coming from the crack in the universe didn’t affect her at all; she simply flashed and disappeared.

“Huh?”

Su Ping suddenly felt a strong killing intent behind him. There were goosebumps all over his body. He used the path of illusion and reappeared thousands of meters away.

A person appeared right in the spot where he had been a moment before and attacked the afterimage left by Su Ping.

Kayafollet’s reaction was much faster than before. She snorted and dispelled her attack. She became even colder, not expecting that Su Ping would foresee her move. That guy’s senses are too keen. She was even more determined to kill him.

“Did you just break the barrier?” Su Ping was grim faced as he faced Kayafollet. He had also realized what she had done with the corpse’s power.

“You’re not slow.” Kayafollet sneered. No one could tell whether she was talking about his ability to dodge, or his deduction.

Su Ping didn’t know how she had controlled the corpse, but it was pointless to find out; escaping with his life was the order of the day. The woman before him was practically a lunatic; she had broken the barrier just to kill him. The City of Sins would surely be leveled by the Celestials now that the barrier was gone.

Countless people had been born in that sinful place.

There were also criminals who had been banished not because they were guilty, but because they had offended the wrong people.

Those fugitives had lost their last shelter in the universe.

“Is it too late for me to apologize?” Su Ping suddenly asked.

Kayafollet was dazed, not expecting Su Ping to lower his head that quickly. Coldness flashed in her eyes. “What do you think? Didn’t you try to compete over the legacy energy with me? The demonic store messed up when it chose you. Each of its successors were dominators of their eras; it will certainly feel great if I put an end to this one.”

What a psycho… Su Ping thought, but on the surface he said, “I admit that I took in a bit too much. I can spit it back if you want. Or maybe I can work as your subordinate.”

Kayafollet gazed at Su Ping coldly, not expecting that a top genius of the universe could be so shameless.

A scenario should have gone with ‘So what if you’re a Celestial now? I’m just going to find out how strong you really are!’

—Then, he’d be beaten to death while screaming

“Didn’t you say that your back is too straight for you to lower your head?” asked Kayafollet to mock him.

Su Ping shook his head and said, “I couldn’t lower my head before, but I can now. Just take a look for yourself.” He stretched his neck by dozens of centimeters while he spoke, then shook it like a noodle.

IIII

Kayafollet was completely lost for words. With disgust flashing in her eyes, she said, “You’re just a coward. You’re still a piece of garbage, even though you’ve become one of the best geniuses of the universe with the demonic store’s help. You wouldn’t even be qualified to meet me without the store’s backing!”

“Yes, of course, you’re absolutely right.” Su Ping nodded quickly.

“Hand over your pet, crawl over on your knees, and I will consider taking you as a slave,” said Kayafollet contemptuously; spending more time talking with him would be a waste. This piece of garbage doesn’t deserve my attention. She only needed to make the best use of him.

“Hand over my pet?” Dazed, Su Ping quickly shook his head. “No can do. Can you ask for something else?”

“Are you even qualified to negotiate with me?” asked Kayafollet with sharp eyes. “No, but I can’t give you my pet,” said Su Ping, shaking his head.

Kayafollet couldn’t help but smile. “You’re truly greedy and shameless. Have you not understood the situation just yet? That chaos pet is too good for you. The demonic store shouldn’t have given it to you!”

“The demonic store didn’t give it to me; I was the one who found it,” said Su Ping solemnly.

Kayafollet raised her eyebrows and sneered, “Who’d believe that? I’ll give you one last chance; don’t try to buy yourself more time. I’ve already twisted time and space in this place. Only three seconds have passed in the outside world at most!”

“I really can’t give it to you.” Su Ping shook his head.

Kayafollet’s face suddenly turned cold. “Then I’ll separate your soul from your body and show you what the world truly looks like!”

Bang!

Su Ping had already slashed at her before she took action. His dazzling sword, carrying a torrent of chaos power, split the void apart. It was terrifying, resembling an inverted waterfall

Kayafollet’s face changed somewhat. She wouldn’t have been able to fend off such an attack had she not broken through.

Furthermore, she felt that the attack was really powerful, even though she was a Celestial, and she had to deal with it carefully!

Why does this man deserve such luck? Kayafollet’s anger and jealousy grew. That was a petty and cowardly man, yet he received the legacy of the demonic store. It’s so unfair!
