Chapter 828: The Astral Body State

“This is a Building Foundation Pill that can help consolidate the bridge!”

“This is a pill that can increase your power of understanding!”

The bubbles behind the girl cracked one after the other, and all sorts of top pills flew out. They had been refined for the Twilight Deity King’s subordinates and all were of the best quality in their level.

“Great!”

While standing in the middle of the accumulated steam, Su Ping felt that his body was overflowing with power, but he felt that he could still continue.

The vortices inside his body became more and more condensed and looked like planets.

The astral power within them had already slowed down, turning from gas into liquid.

Su Ping snapped the corks on the bottles, then chewed and swallowed the pills they contained.

Boom!

A significant amount of astral power was flowing into his limbs. Su Ping felt that he could reach the Fate State with the astral power!

He could sense the bottleneck above the bridge, and he could break it at any time!

However, he chose not to jump the gun and break through. Instead, he compressed all his astral power into liquid inside his cells. The Building Foundation Pill also helped in further consolidating the bridge that Su Ping constructed. Su Ping felt that the bridge was ascending as more and more pills were swallowed; it would soon turn into a mountain!

The bottleneck was right at the top of the mountain; the bridge could simply hit and break it!

Closing his eyes, Su Ping controlled the bridge with his best efforts and further compressed it.

Su Ping’s mind became agile and inspired thanks to the pill that increased his power of understanding, allowing him to capture many subtleties. He had a strange feeling while he compressed the bridge.

Very soon, the strange feeling became stronger, until he had an epiphany.

He had attained a new law: Fusion in the water class!

Everything could be fused!

Su Ping kept on fusing the power of the pills with that new law, making the bridge harder and indestructible!

“You still haven’t broken through?”

The girl was surprised, considering the number of pills Su Ping had consumed. Even a pig should have advanced after taking that many of them.

She could easily tell that Su Ping was still in the Void State, yet he released such a magnificent amount of astral power... She even felt that someone a realm higher than him could be maimed by a gentle touch of his!

He already has the power of the Upper Deities who master laws. He’s even stronger than most Upper Deities!

How can his body store such an amount of power? It’s so horrifying!

Despite her high level, the girl was indeed surprised by Su Ping’s weird phenomena; she had never seen anything as horrifying as him. He probably would have defeated the geniuses on the Talented Deities Ranking.

She then thought about many things from the olden times as she remembered that ranking.

She was still a pill by the Twilight Deity King’s side back then. She traveled across the world with him, met countless young geniuses and explored plenty of dangerous places.

Buzzing!

Su Ping’s body hummed again. The liquid astral power inside his cells had been compressed to the limit and turned into a fiber-like solid, which was akin to mist but actually tangible. There was more and more fibered astral power on the cell walls that the space inside them became smaller and smaller.

Su Ping continued swallowing the pills, which turned into scorching energy, to then convert into magnificent astral power that filled his cells.

The fibered astral power was accumulated and his cells were entirely filled up!

His cells became like spheres of astral power!

This is... the real Astral Body State!

During the training, Su Ping suddenly entered a meditative status.

He could clearly sense all the organs and cells inside his body; he could even control each of the cells individually!

That was mind boggling and hard to believe. It had to be noted that ordinary people could hardly control their ears to move. Cultivators had a higher control over their bodies, but it was already their best to move their bones.

Su Ping, however, was able to control his every cell, which meant that his body could be altered if he wanted to!

He could assume any form in the world any time he wanted.

That morphing ability was the greatest form!

Not having a definite shape meant that he could be fearsome in melee battles. It would be impossible for his enemy to imagine how he could attack.

The Astral Body State was the third level of the Chaos Star Chart.

Above the Astral Body State was the Astral Painting State!

Su Ping had originally thought that he wouldn’t attain the Astral Body until he advanced into the Star State or become a Star Lord. The combat ability of each level was described when he practiced the Chaos Star Chart.

Normally speaking, only Star State warriors could have accumulated enough astral power for them to reach the Astral Body State.

And yet, the gifts from the divine residence had allowed Su Ping to accomplish this while still in the Void State.

All the cells in his body had turned into veritable stars of astral power!

However, he had barely entered the Astral Body State. If he wanted to make further progress, he would have to control each of his cells and create internal circulations within each one.

To reach the Astral Painting State you would have to draw ancient star maps with soul power.

Just like arrays, star maps would allow him to unleash incredible divine power!

My body... seems to be stronger... Su Ping carefully examined himself and then sensed that his body had indeed gone through drastic changes.

If he were to fight the purple-robed young man again, he would defeat him with a single punch!

Su Ping’s strength had increased by more than ten times in that short period. It was a qualitative leap!

Fuse!

Su Ping didn’t stop. He seized the opportunity to continue absorbing and training.

He fused the laws such as Cutting and God of Lightning into the bridge and consolidated it.

More and more laws were fused into the bridge; they formed magnificent power which surrounded it like a guardian.

Su Ping became even more intimidating and immeasurable.

He can still endure it!

The girl was surprised and solemn. Even though she had met a lot of people, Su Ping was still an unparalleled being in his level!

He could count as an astonishing genius in every age!

Half an hour later—

Su Ping gradually stopped.

The bridge inside his body had been fully constructed. It couldn’t be further compressed, even with the fusion law. He would reach the Fate State if he only took one step further.

Su Ping chose to wait until he absorbed the fruits of law on the leader girl’s tree, so that he could have the greatest accumulations after he broke the bottleneck with laws!

“You can have the rest.”

Su Ping threw the other divine pills to the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound. He also summoned the Purple Python, the white-scaled dragon, and the Void Bug that he rarely took out.

“Huh?”

The girl was rather stunned to see the Void Bug. “An abyss creature? You enslaved an abyss creature?”

“Abyss creature?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and looked at the Void Bug which had already become fat. He had captured it in the Demigod Burial. It was an alien being that invaded the Demigod Burial.

He didn’t know that the girl would also recognize it. So to speak, that creature actually had a long history.

“It’s a creature from the Heavenly Pit. I didn’t know you had one...” said the girl solemnly, “Has another Heavenly Pit appeared? Are the abyss creatures here again?”

Stunned, Su Ping asked, “Is it a creature from the Heavenly Pit? So, the Twilight Deity King blocked the Heavenly Pit because he wanted to stop such things?”

The girl shook her head. “It’s just a creature that lived in the Heavenly Pit, but it had the weird trait of being able to eat anything; even the gods were scared of them. However, this one is too small to be a threat.”

“It’s still cyan-colored and hasn’t evolved yet... Speaking of which, I’ve given you a lot of things. Why have you still not evolved?” Su Ping looked at the Void Bug as if it were a disappointing child.

The Void Bug: “?”

It looked at Su Ping in frustration and waved its claws, claiming innocence.

“What a useless guy.” Su Ping rolled his eyes.

It had soaked in Joanna’s spring for such a long time, yet it evolved so slowly. He wondered why it had been regarded as a plague in the Demigod Burial.

You’re lowering the average dangerousness of your bug kind!

The girl looked at Su Ping but stayed silent; she sensed that this self-proclaimed inheritor of the Deity King had a lot of secrets.

However, she wasn’t reluctant to give the pills away, which were of a low level and would soon expire in any case.

Su Ping would be unable to digest the pills that only the Golden Deities could take, and he would simply die in the process.

Assorted pills were then fed to the Little Skeleton, the Inferno Dragon and the other pets. They all had a great time.

“We are technically family, since you’re a pill that my ancestor created. I wonder, how should I call you?” Su Ping finally had the time to ask the girl’s name.

The girl said casually, “Just call me Green Lady.”

“Do you have any plans, Green Lady? There will be more intruders coming this way, now that the divine residence has been exposed. The three Golden Deities will surely come by soon, looking for my ancestor’s relics,” said Su Ping worriedly, “It’s fine if they just want the relics, but I’m afraid that in their greed they’ll ruin my ancestor’s body.”

Green Lady raised her eyebrows and said after a moment of silence, “I’ve lingered here for too long. I was also greatly exhausted in that battle. I’m no match for three Golden Deities...”

Su Ping was regretful after hearing her reply.

He had planned to trick the girl into fighting for the Deity King’s legacies in his stead.

The three Ascendant State experts would certainly not be happy about it... But who could refuse the legacies of a Celestial State expert?

Not just the legacies of a Celestial State expert, even the legacy of several billion astral coins was enough to turn brothers against each other. Emotions were the most vulnerable things in the world.

But then again, emotions were also the most indestructible things.

“However, while I’m not strong enough to deal with them, there’s a couple of guys who can. We’ll leave the rest of the pills for later. Let’s go meet them,” Green Lady said.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. “Are there other seniors inside this divine residence?”

“Sort of.” Green Lady didn’t explain.

Su Ping didn’t ask further. He simply had his pets stop absorbing the pills, then merged with the Inferno Dragon and the Little Skeleton to keep himself at his strongest status.

After that, he stored the Purple Python and the Void Bug in the summoning space.

“Let’s go.”

Green Lady waved her hand, and all the pills were gone, collected in another space.

She then released a power that enshrouded Su Ping. Su Ping then found himself in the middle of the void. There was a floating palace in front of him.

Boom!!

A huge explosion burst out in front of the palace.

Dozens of people were fighting outside of the floating palace.

Three of them were half beasts, which emitted a horrifying power. They were all accompanied by mountainous beasts.

Su Ping quickly noticed that one of the beasts was exactly the dragon elder who had appeared outside the divine residence before it was opened.

The three horrifying men were undoubtedly the three Ascendant experts that had entered the divine residence earlier!

Close to eight shadows were fighting against them. Those shadows were changing constantly during the battle, morphing into long spears and sharp blades.

“How is this possible...?”

Green Lady’s expression changed; she then took Su Ping further.

“All of them have mounts and spiritual beasts of Golden Deity level...” Her face looked awful; she didn’t see that coming.

Su Ping was briefly stunned. He instantly realized that she wasn’t familiar with the battle pet system and thought that there would only be three Golden Deities.

As a matter of fact, the three Ascendant State experts plus their pets would count as a dozen Golden Deities!

Even though not all those pets were in the Ascendant State, they were still horrifying.

“Their opponents are...”

“They’re the top artifacts that the Deity King had collected!”

“...”

Su Ping was lost for words, not expecting Green Lady’s helpers to be the artifacts.

Those artifacts were intelligent and could fight while in human shape. They probably had Ascendant fighting capability since they had yet to be defeated. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Unfortunately, the Deity King’s unparalleled artifact was damaged, otherwise it could have suppressed them!” Green Lady seemed angry.

Su Ping then realized it was unrealistic to compete for legacies with those experts.

He secretly heaved a sigh, but he wasn’t too disappointed. Even though there was some regret, he had indeed looted enough things during the trip.

Su Ping turned around and said telepathically, “Senior Green Lady, since things are like this, why don’t we just leave this place?”

If he could take the girl away, Su Ping felt that she would be as good as any of the remaining legacies. After all, she was a divine pill that could increase the chance of becoming a king!

The Ascendant State experts probably didn’t know that there was such an incredible divine pill in that place. They had gone straight to the treasury in search of legacies.

If only one Ascendant had made the trip, he probably would have thoroughly investigated every palace, but the three Ascendant State experts were keeping each other in check. None of them wanted to miss getting the most valuable treasure that was oftentimes the one with the most protection!

As a result, they had missed that great divine pill.
