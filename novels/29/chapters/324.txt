Boom!!

The eye contact lasted a hundredth of a second.

In the next moment, with a sudden burst of sound, the Bloody Servant showed its most ferocious and wild side. The “strip-like” limbs were extended, and with extraordinary speed and strength, the Bloody Servant “hugged” the Moonfrost Dragon.

The Bloody Servant was good at close-range combat and could be compared to an assassin.

A rare pet like this would be excellent in every way, but such a pet would still have a skill that it was best at. A Bloody Servant would be more proficient in exerting destructive force!

The people in the audience were nervous, afraid that the Moonfrost Dragon being torn into pieces would be the next thing they would see...

They did hear a noise. But following the noise were some snowflakes dancing around. Before the noise vanished, the Bloody Servant that had just latched itself onto the Moonfrost Dragon suddenly recoiled as if just having touched something extremely hot. The Bloody Servant leaped back and landed in a place ten meters away.

“What?”

Standing close by, Qin Shaotian was about to help out the Bloody Servant. Suddenly, he sensed the Bloody Servant’s feelings, which made him frown. He felt that the surging violence in the Bloody Servant had died down a bit. The negative and twisted killing intent in the Bloody Servant’s consciousness had come to a halt for a brief second. For a moment there, Qin Shaotian did not need to be constantly trying to suppress the Bloody Servant’s thirst for blood.

What happened?

Qin Shaotian felt mentally disturbed.

As the snowflakes vanished, Qin Shaotian saw the Moonfrost Dragon which should have been wounded by the Bloody Servant. However, the pet was completely unharmed!

What...?

Qin Shaotian could not believe this.

The Bloody Servant was fast. How could the Moonfrost Dragon fend off the strike?

How?

He thought of the Goddess of Ice. But how could the Moonfrost Dragon build-up that shield within such a short span of time? Unless the Moonfrost Dragon used the reserved energy within its body to construct the shield. But that would have been even more far-fetched. The energy that a ninth-rank skill would need could exhaust a dragon that had officially reached the ninth-rank.

Not to mention that this Moonfrost Dragon was just one that had barely reached adulthood at the seventh-rank! All those thoughts flashed past Qin Shaotian’s mind in an instant. He pulled himself together and stopped badgering over such doubts. The Moonfrost Dragon could have used its energy or something else. Either way, he would find out when he struck the Moonfrost Dragon a few more times. If the Moonfrost Dragon was indeed using its individual energy, then he would make the Moonfrost Dragon use up every bit of it!

Charge! Qin Shaotian ordered again. At the same time, he waved his hand and summoned another battle pet. That was the fourth one now!

The audience stared dumbfounded at the swirl. Did Qin Shaotian have other and more powerful battle pets? Soon, the audience realized that this time, the pet was of a healing category, but it had a high-ranked bloodline. It was a “Nature Guardian,” which was at the upper position of the ninth-rank. The pet was like a towering tree; its upper half was a 10-meter tall crown and the lower half consisted of vines and roots.

Judging by its size and other features, the Nature Guardian had just reached the eighth rank or so.

For other participants, not even their major pets would have been able to reach the eighth rank.

“I think he’s trying to treat the Lava Dragon.”

“It is understandable that a healing pet would be added into the mix. That is a must.”

“Oh no, when the Lava Dragon is able to stand again, it’ll be two against one. The Moonfrost Dragon is doomed.”

Everyone could see that something was changing. They looked forward to the next round, excited and nervous.

When the Nature Guardian appeared, the tentacles under its body were immediately extended. From the brown withered vine-like roots, small golden tentacles like new buds crawled onto the chest of the wounded Lava Dragon squatting on the ground. The golden tentacles contained rich life essence, which could heal wounds quickly.

With the help of the Nature Guardian, the gaping injury on the Lava Dragon was healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Dragons were born to be strong and vigorous, which was made more evident than ever at this moment. Even with a hole in its chest, the Lava Dragon could be rescued!

While the healing was in progress, something else was also happening.

The Bloody Servant extended all of its limbs and oddly got onto the ground, both like a spider and a hunter in the forest at the same time. That was the position the Bloody Servant would take when it was ready to fight with all its might.

At this scene, Qin Shaotian frowned. Boom! Boom!

All of a sudden, two beams of light reached the Bloody Servant.

The Bloody Servant suddenly opened six bloodthirsty eyes. Including the previous two, the Bloody Servant had a total of eight eyes. At the moment the light beam came, the Bloody Servant suddenly bounced up, and then a thick dark mist gushed out around its body. The Bloody Servant turned in mid-air, and suddenly rushed towards the Moonfrost Dragon! The dark mist all over its body approached the Moonfrost Dragon first while the Bloody Servant was trying to reach the dragon.

A ghostly giggle was heard, and at the same time, it resembled a kind of a blade slitting sound, very harsh. Even with the seal, the audience still felt intense discomfort, and some people even began to feel dizzy, wanting to throw up after this perturbing noise.

That was the Bloody Servant’s skill!

It was almost as deterring as a dragon’s roar!

As the giggling continued, from the dark mist burst out many flames, hellish flames. The temperature of the flames was not high. Rather, the flames carried a coldness that could consume everything.

When the two skills were unleashed, the Bloody Servant began its attack. The Bloody Servant’s every sharp appendage started to dance around. The sharp blades were covered with evil energy that could make the blades even more dangerous. At the same time, with evil energy, the sharp blades had the ability to corrode, weaken, and penetrate. Even a dragon would be cut open!

The moment the Bloody Servant began to move in closer to the Moonfrost Dragon, cruelty flashed in the latter’s silver eyes.

Bang! The ground caved in all of a sudden, as if an invisible force were smashing the ground. That was a ninth-rank skill of the stone family, Super Gravity Field!

In comparison with the seventh-rank Gravity Field, the Super Gravity Field was able to make most beasts under the ninth-rank collapse to the ground!

The moment the Super Gravity Field was manifested, the stage trembled as well as the entire venue.

The Bloody Servant paused for an instant, a split of a second. The pet was quite adaptable; it not only managed to fight off the effect but had become used to the gravity.

Being one of the best close-combat pets, the Bloody Servant was resilient. Still, the Moonfrost Dragon had grabbed the Bloody Servant! That happened faster than anyone could imagine!

Before the Bloody Servant could understand what happened, a large, fierce-looking mouth had come into view.
