Chapter 1174: Entering the Divine Eye

Just when Su Ping was observing the unusual phenomena caused by the young Chaos Beast—a vortex appeared in the void and an intimidating aura began to spread out!

“You dare come out of the Ember Palace? You’re asking to be killed!”

Su Ping slightly changed his expression, not expecting the Rain Clan to find him that quickly.

He had been resurrecting randomly nonstop since he left Ember Palace, which made it impossible for the Rain Clan to lock onto him. They caught up to him the moment he stopped, which meant that they had never stopped monitoring him.

“You truly won’t stop until you kill me, right?” Su Ping’s eyes emanated coldness.

Exactly at that moment—the man locked time and space without saying another word, and then imposed a destructive force upon Su Ping, which almost began to crack.

The man exclaimed in shock, not expecting that his strike would fail to reduce Su Ping into smithereens.

“His body is unbelievably sturdy…” He began to understand why his clan was determined to kill that young human.

He was such a terrifying genius. He would become a major threat to the Rain Clan if he were to develop!

“Die!”

Without further ado, the man attacked again with an intimidating aura.

After a boom, Su Ping’s body couldn’t handle it anymore and exploded. Both his consciousness and energy were destroyed. He was completely dead.

Su Ping was unable to resist the man’s full-strength attack!

“He’s finally dead…” The man heaved a sigh of relief. He also felt rather delighted, as Su Ping was considered the biggest problem by his clan; even though he was but a mere Celestial God, they were determined to get rid of him. He had made a great contribution by killing the guy today.

“Humans allowed the brat to visit such a remote place. Ha…” The man sneered. He was in a great mood because he would be generously rewarded, even though he didn’t go through any trouble.

Roar!!

Exactly at that moment—a furious roar burst out. The young Chaos Beast expanded in size as it gathered power and glared at the man with bloodshot eyes.

The creature was only in the Star State, and yet it was bold enough to roar at a Celestial State expert!

The man was truly astonished. He had already sensed the beast, but didn’t consider it a big deal; after all, it was very weak. He had solely focused on killing Su Ping. He then observed the little creature more carefully, only to be shocked.

“A Chaos Beast? How is that possible? Haven’t all Chaos Beasts gone extinct a long time ago?”

The man’s eyes glowed with shock. He felt like laughing, not expecting the trip to be as rewarding. Not only did he get to kill Su Ping but he would also grab a Chaos Beast!

“That human brat was unbelievably lucky; he actually had a Chaos Beast. Did he capture it? Or was it a gift from the Dragon Tamers? In any case, it’s mine now.” The man chuckled and laid his hand on the Chaos Beast, ignoring its aggressive attitude.

No matter how furious it roared, it was just a kid anyway, and would only be suppressed with the man’s domineering power.

However, right when his enormous hand formed with divine power was about to touch the young Chaos Beast—it suddenly collapsed. Then, the breeze in midair seemed to have been frozen.

All wind and sounds seemed to have been solidified.

The swaying flowers and blades of grass on the ground were also petrified.

Like moons, a pair of bloody eyes were slowly opened in the void, right behind the man. They were cold and condescending, as if looking down upon all living things.

The man struggled to turn around, and was unable to close his mouth in a long time. Once he saw the figure behind him, he narrowed his eyes so hard that his face was completely contorted. “Ferocious…”

Bang!

His body exploded into millions of pieces and fell like dust. The pieces were then squeezed by some sort of power in the void and turned into nothingness.

A figure emerged in the void after the god exploded. It was none other than Su Ping who had resurrected.

Hardly had he resurrected when he sensed the terrifying pressure, which made his body temperature plummet, crawling into his pores like bugs, and making him shiver.

The feeling was all too familiar.

He raised his head and then put on a smile. It seemed that the young Chaos Beast had been successful in summoning the creature over.

The Chaos Perception Dragon.

Su Ping didn’t see the man, but he didn’t really care; that guy was unrelated to him. Naturally, he would let him experience the charm of the top ferocious beast in the Archean Divinity.

Su Ping flew toward the young Chaos Beast and petted the young fellow; the latter was rather confused after a long time roaring. He then said to the Chaos Perception Dragon, “It’s been a long time. I beckoned you here because I have a favor to ask… I want to go to the Divine Eyes. I hope you can take me there and show me the source of divine power.”

Small talk was unnecessary for such a ferocious beast; Su Ping simply stated his real purpose.

The Chaos Perception Dragon looked down at Su Ping indifferently. Moments later, it turned its head and glanced at the young Chaos Beast currently enjoying Su Ping’s stroking.

It stared at the man and the little beast.

Su Ping then felt a strong wind, and everything changed before his eyes. The boundless plains and forest were gone; the sky was no longer sunny, as it was currently filled with stars.

The surroundings became desolate and primordial too.

Skeletons of enormous beasts were everywhere, sprawled on the ground; the flesh stuck to the bones had mostly been eaten up. Some carcasses were still rotting, which attracted many scavengers.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, shocked and suspicious as he noticed the dazzling golden sun.

It was more like an enormous golden eye floating in the void!

Infinite divine power was flowing out like golden magma and dripping in the void, causing golden cracks on the black ground. Some of it either seeped into the ground or dissipated in the void.

“Is that… the Divine Eye?”

Su Ping was extremely shocked. The scene was splendid and breathtaking beyond words.

He didn’t expect that the Chaos Perception Dragon would straight out take him to one of the Divine Eyes right after making the request.

Has this Divine Eye always been under the Chaos Perception Dragon’s control?

It was obvious that such a place was too desolate to be one of the seven great clans’ territories.

This is one of the nine sources of all the power in this world…?Su Ping could feel the unimaginable, suffocating divine power in the void. Normal gods would probably drown in the divine power and rot if they went there.

It was just like humans would die if there was too much oxygen.

Su Ping’s body was extremely sturdy, and he had the Chaos Star Chart; that was why he could survive. Still, he felt that his body was filled to the fullest and he couldn’t hold back.

I’ll break through if I stay here a while.

Still, it’ll be fine even if I rise to the Star Lord State. It simply remains to be seen whether or not I’ll trigger a Heavenly Tribulation if I make a breakthrough here…?Su Ping wondered.

“Thank you, sir,” said Su Ping to the Chaos Perception Dragon.

The latter didn’t even bother to look at him; it lay down somewhere in front of the Divine Eye, simply letting the divine power flow past its body.

Su Ping knew that the ferocious dragon had only taken him there for the young Chaos Beast’s sake. He immediately asked the young Chaos Beast to seize the opportunity to cultivate.

The young Chaos Beast had been slightly vigilant of the gargantuan creature. It felt connected to the dragon by blood, but the latter also felt dangerous. So, it was caught in a predicament. It didn’t go to the golden liquid under the Divine Eye until Su Ping encouraged it. Soon, it was having a great time, making the fluid splatter everywhere.

Su Ping released the Little Skeleton and his other pets so they could cultivate there.

The Rain Clan has just lost an expert. They probably won’t send another man for the time being. The Chaos Perception Dragon claimed one of the Divine Eyes in this world, and it’s as strong as an Ancestral God. The Rain Clan would not dare seek revenge unless they’re stupid. Even if they wanted to, they wouldn’t be able to find this place…?Su Ping thought.

He dropped the irrelevant thoughts and walked toward the Divine Eye.

I wonder what’s behind the Divine Eye… Is there an eye there??Su Ping grew curious. The closer he was to the eye, the more awed he became; one wouldn’t be truly mature until one respected others.

The divine power around him became increasingly abundant. Su Ping felt that his body was being transformed by the godly energy. The ancient deity aura inside his body was rejecting the divine power—

However, the feeling of rejection dwindled as he approached the Divine Eye. It seemed that his deity aura couldn’t resist it any longer; the two powers gradually began to mix.

The process was extremely slow. Su Ping also felt an excruciating pain, as if the two forces were ripping his body apart.

The tearing wasn’t at the center of his chest. Rather, his every finger, every bone, and every nerve was torn and affected!

The unimaginable pain drove Su Ping crazy. However, he gritted his teeth to withstand it.

He sat down cross-legged and tried to best digest the effect. He attempted to forge a balance inside his body, gaining a deeper understanding of divine power during the melting.

Domineering, powerful, gentle, sacred, and many others: divine power carried many traits.

It was hard to tell how long he had cultivated. He didn’t rise and walk forward again until the pain inside his body receded.

The feeling of pain escalated again soon after. He reached the furthest he could endure, then sat down cross-legged again, absorbing the divine power. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Time flew.

There was no distinction of day and night in that unknown, desolate land. There seemed to be an eternal night looming.

The Chaos Perception Dragon was quietly and lazily resting. It simply glanced at the playful young Chaos Beast every now and then. As days went by, it would occasionally look at the insignificant human on the other side.

Su Ping was covered in a strange, hazy light; it was gray and dark. Golden light would occasionally be seen.

Four small worlds were revealed; surrounding him, causing all kinds of unusual phenomena.

Every small world was absorbing the magnificent divine power, and became increasingly solid.

Su Ping, devoted to cultivation, woke up every time the feeling of pain subsided and would then move on. The process was repeated over and over, until he felt dazzled when he sat down again. Once he raised his head, he found that the gargantuan Divine Eye was emitting powerful waves right before his eyes.

The power was constantly surging. It seemed to be balanced in its own way, and the balance would be broken if anyone were to touch it.

Once the balance was broken, the terrifying power inside would gush out and destroy the world.

Su Ping gazed at the Divine Eye, and felt burning pain in both his eyes. Still, he didn’t look away. All laws near the Divine Eye had been transformed; he was unable to detect any other laws; even time was extremely feeble in that place. The only abundant power present was the divine power.

However, the law was covered by the abundant power, and he could hardly find the source.

Su Ping suddenly turned around and asked the Chaos Perception Dragon, “Can I jump into the Divine Eye?”

The latter slowly opened its eyes and glanced at him. Then, it closed them.

Taking that as a yes, Su Ping took a deep breath and jumped into the Divine Eye.

Right after he jumped, Su Ping detected the most amazing scene: the short distance was like millions of kilometers—There seemed to be countless pieces of paper in the water. He could clearly feel every layer he had passed.

There was a long distance between every two layers.

Su Ping’s flesh was falling and melting. After every several dozen layers, the heat of divine power would cause greater damage to Su Ping’s body.

The damage couldn’t be mended, not even with the path of vitality.

Su Ping gritted his teeth and ran onwards.

His flesh collapsed, revealing his bones. His eyeballs had also been burnt up too, leaving the empty eye sockets. In the end, his bones were burning too, due to the corruption caused by divine power.

Once he was close to dying, a stream of power approached him and blocked the divine power.

The path of vitality bounced back and helped Su Ping recover his lost flesh. He turned around, only to discover that the Chaos Perception Dragon had helped, covering him with the aura of chaos, and preventing divine power from hurting him.

“Little thing, do you want to die?” said an ancient voice coldly.

Su Ping was dazed for a moment. Knowing that the Chaos Perception Dragon was the one talking, he quickly replied, “Thank you for saving us, senior, but I’m not trying to kill myself; I’m seeking knowledge!”

“Seeking knowledge? At the cost of your life?”

“I won’t die,” said Su Ping quickly.

The Chaos Perception Dragon was silent for a moment. He recalled Su Ping’s secrets, so it didn’t say anything else except, “Don’t go too deeply, or you won’t dare to return.”

Su Ping was dazed.?What’s that supposed to mean?

The great dragon’s power faded away at that moment, and Su Ping felt the heat again. But soon after, he reacted by condensing the power of chaos inside his body, and soon, the scorching feeling disappeared.
