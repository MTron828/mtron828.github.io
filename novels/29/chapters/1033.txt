Chapter 1035: It’s Very Useful if You Regard Them as Partners

Loulan Haisen looked at Su Ping with a mix of shock and suspicion. The six assassins who committed that infamous murder and shocked the universe had been hiding in the Home of Havoc for two thousand years, until they slipped out and tried to assassinate Su Ping!

Even more shockingly, their assassination failed!

The six of them are among the top ten assassins in the Dark Tower. Even lords of planetary systems are scared of them…?Loulan Feng wore a complicated expression, as Su Ping had shocked him every time. Those assassins weren’t on the Divine Lord Rank, but they were no less talented than the geniuses listed!

“Can you figure out who hired the Dark Tower to kill me?” asked Su Ping.

Loulan Feng and Loulan Haisen looked at each other and hesitated. Haisen said, “Although we have connections in the Dark Tower, this assassination had to be highly confidential. We’ll try our best to investigate and let you know if we learn anything.”

Su Ping nodded and left that matter to rest.

While Su Ping and Loulan Lin fled from danger—in another part of the universe.

A fierce battle had reached an end. A man quickly flew by in deep space, and a hideous beast joined him from another direction to report the situation.

“They failed, just as I expected. What a bunch of losers!”

Yin Xing was cold and sullen. Although unable to attack the target, he had created the best killing scenario for the six guys, yet they still failed.

The intelligence was right in that the young genius was unimaginably strong, and could grow to become the strongest person underneath the Ascendant State given enough time!

Whoosh!

He moved to another place along with the huge beast.

Then, he waved his hand to activate a secret technique and reach into the river of time, soon fetching a tiny creature from within.

It was a tiny beast that could reside in time; it looked like a fat bird, with short wings and glowing feathers. It chirped the moment it saw Yin Xing.

Yin Xing made his forehead touch the little beast’s head, and soon saw a lot of scenes.

An instant kill?

This brat’s small world contains the four supreme laws, and all of them have been perfected…

Is he really in the Star State?

Once he saw the whole thing, Yin Xing was so shocked he was unable to utter a word in a long time.

His face was gloomy. Had he not seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed the assassination attempt would be such a fiasco!

He had also been able to read Su Ping’s lips as he fought the assassins. It was rather unbelievable.

Yes, unbelievable.

It’s truly unbelievable that those six idiots were sent to assassinate that kid!

He’s like a horrifying monster wearing Star State skin!

He had fully mastered all four supreme laws! Yin Xing had never felt such pressure even from the first place holder of the Divine Lord Rank; he suddenly realized why he was given such a mission.

The person who hired him must have sensed something, and wanted to remove that monster in advance!

It wasn’t hard to imagine how terrifying that guy would become when he reached the Ascendant State. He might even reach the Celestial State someday!

The more Yin Xing thought, the more scared he was. He even regretted the situation. It would be disastrous for him if that monster did grow and later looked for the ones related to the failed assassination he just endured!

“Damn it!”

Yin Xing was rather angry. Had he known beforehand, he would have done the assassination himself, even if he would later have to hide in the Home of Havoc. That guy was too big of a threat!

I should have reconsidered when I accepted this mission. What a huge loss!

Yin Xing was rather gloomy. He simply hoped that the person who hired him would continue offering the mission to others.

If I share the information with my organization, that person would certainly buy it. He’s the one who should be worried, and will definitely do something. It’s impossible to kill him without hiring Ascendants!?Yin Xing thought.

Once he thought about that, he suddenly felt that the six losers weren’t entirely useless. At least they helped him learn the latest information about the monster.

Su Ping returned to Rhea while protected by the two Ascendant State experts.

“Is this where you live?” Loulan Lin searched for that planetary system online after she arrived; she felt intrigued and wanted to know about Su Ping’s past.

“Only for now,” said Su Ping.

The planet seemed to have turned into his spaceship in a way, though…

Loulan Haisen and Loulan Feng concealed their auras once they reached the sky above Woffett City, then landed along with Su Ping while keeping a low profile. They reached the store soon after.

“Do you really run a pet store?” Su Ping had mentioned it on their way, but Loulan Lin was still shocked when arrived.

A Celestial expert’s disciple, a genius who has suppressed all his peers, is actually a pet store owner?

Does he have nothing better to do?

“Of course,” said Su Ping proudly, “This is my store.”

Loulan Lin was lost for words.

The customers who were waiting in line exclaimed in delight when they saw Su Ping. It was quite the surprise for them to see him while they waited.

“It’s Boss Su!”

“Mr. Su is back!”

Su Ping was a celebrity, the champion in Silvy’s genius contest. Although years had passed since the last contest was held and other planets had forgotten about it, it was as fresh as yesterday for Rhea’s natives. All of them were proud of him!

Su Ping greeted them with a smile. Then, he invited Loulan Feng and the others inside. After all, they had escorted him all the way over; it would be rude not to let them in.

The two experts didn’t decline his invitation. They were very curious about Su Ping’s store, which was clearly extraordinary; their senses couldn’t penetrate it.

“You’re finally back.” Tang Ruyan heard the noises and was about to talk, when she saw Loulan Lin behind Su Ping. Her smile froze and then disappeared. She asked, “Are they customers?”

“Friends,” said Su Ping casually. He didn’t detect anything unusual in Tang Ruyan’s tone.

Loulan Lin observed Tang Ruyan while standing behind him, and immediately found that she hadn’t even reached the Star State yet; she then felt greatly reassured.

She’s weaker and less beautiful than me. She’s not a threat,?Loulan Lin casually remarked in her heart.

Tang Ruyan didn’t seem interested in talking to the visitors; she turned around and entered the store.

Inside the store—Green Lady saw Su Ping and greeted him with a smile, “You’re back.” Then, she looked at the two Ascendants behind him.

“You’re back,” Joanna also glanced at him and stated the obvious. She would have remained silent, not wasting her time on such small talk if it were in the past. However, she started to regard him as something more than just her tour guide to the Archean Divinity after he finally took her there.

“Yes.” Su Ping nodded.

Loulan Lin gradually dropped her smile; there was no telling what was on her mind.

Tang Ruyan, who was standing next to her, glanced at the woman with curled lips.

“Ascendant State…” Loulan Haisen saw Green Lady and narrowed his eyes; he immediately nodded at her in greeting.

After all, she was clearly Su Ping’s supporter. There was no need to be too arrogant in front of her since the Loulans were trying to impress Su Ping.

“Make yourselves at home; I have some business to attend to. Carry on with your work,” said Su Ping respectively to the visitors and the ladies minding the store to leave the guests in their care.

Green Lady stayed silent. She sensed no malicious intent from the two Ascendants, so she withdrew her gaze and minded her own business.

“Are they all…” Loulan Lin bit her lips, as if about to ask something.

“They’re all my friends, and employees,” said Su Ping.

“Employees?” Loulan Lin was stunned. Somewhat relieved, she whispered, “Including that Ascendant expert??”

“Sure.”

Su Ping added in a low voice, “She can hear you no matter how low your voice is.”

Loulan Lin glared at him. She only kept her voice down to be courteous; she certainly knew that the person could hear her.

“Did your master send them to help you?” asked Loulan Lin curiously. It seemed reasonable that his master would send an Ascendant to protect him.?But why didn’t the bodyguard tag along in his visit to the Loulan family? Wasn’t the trip dangerous?

“Don’t be so nosy just yet,” snapped Su Ping.

Green Lady glanced at Loulan Lin in silence.

Loulan Lin stopped asking, seeing that Su Ping was unwilling to tell; she didn’t take it to heart. She then looked around in the store and asked, “Why did you open a pet store? You could’ve done anything in your position.”

“Because I wanted to,” said Su Ping casually, “Besides, it’s my job.”

“Your job?” Loulan Lin was amused. “Who could give someone of your position a job? Not even Lord Supreme would have asked you to do such a boring thing, would he?”

Su Ping asked solemnly, “Do you think running a pet store is boring?”

Loulan Lin was slightly stunned. She could tell from his expression that he didn’t take the matter as a joke. She frowned and said, “I mean, if you’re doing this as a job, it has to benefit you somehow. Does running a pet store benefit you?”

“Of course,” Su Ping calmed down and replied casually, “Battle pet warriors have to get in touch with as many pets as possible. Otherwise, how could you know what your pets are thinking, what they like to eat, and how they like to play?”

Loulan Lin was stunned. “Is such knowledge of any use?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and said casually, “It cannot improve your combat ability. However, it’s very useful if you regard your pets as partners. Wouldn’t you be interested in knowing what your friends like to eat and do?”

It’s very useful if you regard them as partners…?Loulan Lin reflected on his words and fell silent. She gazed at Su Ping, feeling that she was understanding him. She gave a slight nod. “Got it.”
