Chapter 1327 Great Paths Like Worms (2)

Either get the best, or get what he most wanted. That was always Su Ping’s choice. “Do you know that any of the three Dao Hearts will help you become as strong as the elders of my clan? They’re not as strong as me, but they’re only second to me,” said the Golden Crows’ ancestor.

Su Ping shook his head. “Thank you, but I plan to walk my own path.”

Seeing that Su Ping wasn’t lying, the ancestor didn’t insist. “Since you have your own plans, so be it. The power of my blood is running out; I will take you to see the world I experienced with the remaining power. If you’re smart, you might be able to get something.”

He unleashed an infinite blast of light as he spoke.

Su Ping’s eyes were instantly covered by the dazzling light. The light was the only thing he could see.

A long time later—when Su Ping regained his consciousness-he slowly opened his eyes and saw glittering crystals around him. To his shock, he discovered that they weren’t crystals, but stars with continents!

However, those stars weren’t any different from grains of sand in his eyes.

Su Ping saw the structures of those stars. It seemed that he could destroy those weak stars by simply batting an eye!

He saw an infinite darkness behind the brilliance too.

There were countless, twisted traces in the depths of said darkness.

Right in the center of those traces were the shadows of statues standing in the dark.

Su Ping felt scared when he saw the shadows. He thought that the shadows were the frightening embodiments of some sort of power.

......

Is this the scene that the ancestor saw? What are they…?

Su Ping saw a lot of great paths floating right before his eyes. However, they were like wriggling worms in that massive scope. Or rather, they were worms!

Those worms were gathering on the statues in the dark. The scene was quite horrifying; it was as if the statues would have rotten, giving birth to those worms.

The great paths are like worms… Then, what are the statues? Su Ping was stupefied.

Such a scene was overturning his understanding.

The great paths were as hideous and disgusting as worms!

Then, what was the point of studying and cultivating the great paths?

This is the core truth of the things in this world…

Those scenes were completely different from what he had seen and felt before; his shock couldn’t have been greater. All of a sudden, the scenes faded away like a tide, and the statues in the dark became distant. The stars shone increasingly brighter, until he was again consumed by the light.

The powerful light was as blinding as darkness.

Once he regained his eyesight and senses, he heard a pleasant and caring voice. “Are you all right?”

Slightly dazed, Su Ping turned around and saw Diqiong’s gorgeous face. He sobered up and saw the Chief Elder standing majestically before him.

“Senior Ancestor…”

Su Ping looked around, but didn’t see that grand senior that had almost filled up the universe.

“You saw our ancestor?” The Chief Elder looked at Su Ping with light in his eyes.

Diqiong asked quickly in surprise, “Did the ancestor tell you anything? He usually stays asleep all year long. It was truly lucky of you to meet him!”

Su Ping looked at their curious eyes, then thought for a moment and said, “The ancestor showed me three unparalleled Dao Hearts and allowed me to experience the world he experienced once.”

“Three unparalleled Dao Hearts?” dazed, Diqiong quickly asked, “Where they Harmony and Desolation?”

“You know about that?”

That was unexpected.

Diqiong said with a ‘just as I thought’ expression, “Our ancestor offered me three unparalleled Dao Hearts too. The last one is the Hundred Phenomena, right?”

Su Ping nodded and asked, “What did you choose?”

“I chose to create my own Dao Heart!” Diqiong craned her head proudly. “I am the most beautiful princess of the Golden Crows. It is only natural that I can’t follow someone else’s path. I will walk my own path and be remembered by future generations; my goal is to catch up with my ancestor!”

Su Ping was rather surprised, not expecting that the pretty bird actually had such lofty ambitions. It was obvious that his choice wasn’t the most special.

“Keep it up; I believe you can make it. We will meet at the peak.” Su Ping chuckled.

Diqiong was surprised. She thought that Su Ping would seize the opportunity to mock her. She asked curiously, “What about you? What did you choose?”

“I also chose to create my own,” replied Su Ping with a smile. Diqiong looked at Su Ping in surprise. She was able to tell he wasn’t lying so she smacked her lips and said. “Damn it. You’re showing off again.”

Su Ping said in amusement, “So did you.”

The Chief Elder looked at them solemnly; he was quite surprised by Su Ping’s choice. Diqiong had made such a choice because she was a princess of the Golden Crows who carried the ancestor’s bloodline; there was a good chance that she could establish an unparalleled Dao Heart. As for Su Ping, it was really courageous of him to abandon such ultimate treasures.

He thought more highly of that human. “You must have learned something. If you want to cultivate, I can set up a place for you; feel free to ask me if you have any questions.”

Su Ping dropped his smile and asked, “Senior, how long did it take for me to absorb the blood?”

“Don’t worry. Time flows at a different speed here, even when you absorbed the information in the blood. Probably a month passed in the outside world.’

“A month…” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Su Ping nodded. Considering the time spent earlier, it was time for him to return to his store.

“I should head back,” said Su Ping.

The Chief Elder replied, “Feel free to come back anytime.”

“Okay.”

Diqiong was shocked. “You’re leaving already?”

“I’ll bring you movies next time I come.” Su Ping smiled.

Diqiong said helplessly, “Fine then. I’d like to find out what other human beings are like.”

Su Ping waved the Chief Elder goodbye.

They were then transferred out of the elder’s universe and back to the nest palace.

“Huh?”

Once back in the Crow’s outside world, Su Ping discovered that he was more resistant to their environment; he hardly felt any pressure. He noticed that his body seemed to have changed greatly.

“You were truly lucky to have received the ancestor’s blood; your physique is comparable to mine now.” Diqiong glanced at Su Ping and pretended to be jealous. She actually felt happy for him, as he thought of him as a very special friend.

While stunned for a moment, Su Ping examined his body and found that it was a lot stronger than before. The essence blood didn’t just allow him to have an unusual experience; it also strengthened his body to a significant degree.

OW…

I wonder how sturdy my body is right now… Su Ping felt that he was brimming with strength. It seemed that he could crush any Celestial expert with nothing but his physical strength.

I should test it later in the Archean Divinity…

Su Ping stopped his inner exploration; he had to return to the store and check the ongoing situation.

Since the Lightning Rat’s owner perished, and considering what his master said, Su Ping knew that the worms were invading the universe and approaching the Golden Star Zone.

The Golden Star Zone was quite a ways away from the Mayhem Star Zone. The star zones closer to the crack had surely been vanquished already.

“I’m leaving. You’d better cultivate hard; although your life is peaceful here, you’ll know that your strength isn’t enough when disaster strikes,” Su Ping said to Diqiong.

She replied angrily, “Stop lecturing me. My clan has to exact a bloody revenge; I’ve never slacked for one moment. I will step out of this place when I catch up to my ancestor!”

Su Ping nodded. “If there’s a chance, I’ll help you avenge your clan.”
