Although he had already condensed a Dao Heart, Su Ping had to continue fighting to become familiar with his newfound powers.

Fortunately, he wasn’t short of training places.

This is the power of a God Emperor. My universe is indeed much more powerful and solidified. Compared to a Celestial cultivator’s universe, it’s like a solid rock. They’re incomparable.

Although he wasn’t familiar with it yet, Su Ping could tell he could unleash dozens of times more strength than before.

I wonder what level my Dao Heart is at the moment, and if it’s comparable to the three unparalleled Dao Hearts the Golden Crow ancestor gave me…?Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He couldn’t compare them, but he didn’t think his Dao Heart was too bad; after all, he had killed a member of the Heavens after just grasping his Dao Heart.

Since the alien had suppressed many elders, it was enough to prove he was among the strongest God Emperors.

Su Ping pondered and asked the system the question, “I’ve condensed my universe and grasped a Dao Heart. I wonder what lies ahead for me…”

He then realized the good thing about the system. His master, Chi Huo and the others had to figure out the way to become God Emperors on their own, while he only needed to ask the system.

They couldn’t find the answer after exploring for hundreds of thousands of years. On the other hand, the system had pointed a way for him with a few simple words.

Sometimes the job couldn’t be done no matter how long and hard a person worked on it, without proper guidance, unless we were talking about an exceptional genius.

However, such geniuses could only rise higher and faster with guidance. Without guidance, it was very likely that they would waste a lot of time and squander their potential.

“The next level is called the Undying State!”

The system’s answer echoed in Su Ping’s heart. “That is also the Ancestral God’s level you know. By the way, the Ancestral God is a status, not a level.”

“The Undying State?” Su Ping was briefly stunned, as the name provoked an epiphany. The name itself made Su Ping have a lot of guesses about his future path.

After going through thousands of tribulations, you grasp laws, condense worlds, build universes, cultivate a Dao Heart, and eventually become immortal!

The system said, “That is the ancient cultivation formula. Except for the chaos creatures, the final objective for cultivators of any species is immortality! They cannot be destroyed by anything. Even if the universe falls apart, they will still be reborn!

“Those who reach that level are basically undying legends. They are also the ultimate lifeforms.”

Su Ping was stunned once more, as the system explained in a rather detailed manner.

The final cultivation objective? Ultimate lifeforms?

“What about the Golden Crow ancestor’s level? If the Ancestral God state is the end of all cultivation, where does the Golden Crow ancestor stand?”

“That’s not something you should know right now, but it won’t hurt to tell you. That is an existence beyond all lifeforms. You can’t possibly understand it right now,” said the system.

Su Ping was shocked. He could not help but remember the universe he had seen through the Golden Crow ancestor’s shared experiences.

The Great Dao looked like worms.

That universe had a completely different view. It was unusually dark and terrifying.

The universe looked like that in the Golden Crow ancestor’s eyes. Then what was the crow ancestor’s existence?

Su Ping no longer dared to delve any deeper. It was a concept already beyond the definition of life. Could such an existence be “alive” or “dead”?

Maybe, its very existence was immortality.

It wasn’t restricted by anything in that world.

A member of the Heaven’s actually noticed me while I was looking at the corpse’s memory. That is a method I cannot understand…?Su Ping was at a loss. Although he had reached a height he would have considered unimaginable when he began cultivating, he still felt like an insignificant ant.

The more he cultivated, the less he could understand.

The scarier thing is, that even the incomprehensible existences like the Golden Crow ancestor are also hiding from the Heavens…?Su Ping was so overwhelmed by despair that it was almost suffocating.

The stronger he was, the more respectful he became.

Since he was a step closer to the Ancestral God’s state, he was able to see the enormous gap between him and the Heavens with more clarity. He realized how impossible his revenge was, and how unlikely his escape would end, ever.

Could he float beyond his universe for the rest of his life?

Or, should he find a place and live while keeping a low profile?

Su Ping was awfully confused. His ambition was completely crushed at the moment, but that was not his fault; anyone else would have felt suffocated and desperate when realizing the enormous gap. It was just like when someone crawled all the way to the mountaintop, only to find that the sky that they touched was a mere grain of dust.

The real sky was somewhere beyond their imagination.

His level had indeed increased, but Su Ping was rather frustrated at the moment. It took him a long time for him to regain his fighting will.

Su Ping remembered the Little Skeleton.

In any case, he had to continue cultivating hard; at least he had to improve his store to the maximum level. Once this was achieved, the system would tell him how to resurrect his friend.

If the Little Skeleton could be resurrected, so could all the other people who had died in that universe!

Su Ping remembered Xingyue Shen’er and the others who had said goodbye to him a short while back.

They had all left to defend the borderlands. However, Su Ping didn’t see them when he rescued the others. Maybe they had already died during the worm raids.

He felt pained as he remembered his old friends.

He had tried to stop them, but everyone had their own purpose in life. Their voluntary sacrifice had given him some sort of power.

I can’t be frustrated by this. Even the ordinary soldiers charged at the worms relentlessly. There was despair and death in their eyes too!

Su Ping suddenly realized that the value of some people was not realized by their individual actions, but by influencing others.

That was also extraordinary and important.

Everybody lived for a purpose; there was no such thing as a useless life.

Even the grass and trees had their significance.

Lives are so precious, and the Heavens have simply trampled them…?Su Ping clenched his fists. His rage against the Heaven’s race grew as he understood more about the truth of life. It was a hatred that was deep in his bones!

…

Half a day later, Su Ping finished his rest and bid farewell to the elders. He told them that he was going to travel, but he actually planned to go to dangerous places to find sparring partners.

Su Ping felt that he would be restrained if he only practiced with the elders of the institute. After all, his intention was to fight life-and-death battles, which could allow him to familiarize himself with his power sooner.

Elder Chan didn’t ask him to stay, noticing the young man’s intentions. The boy had shown enough prowess to impress him during the battle against the alien. Su Ping no longer required protection in the world of gods, as long as he didn’t voluntarily seek death in forbidden lands.

As for the other gods, even if they plotted against him, Su Ping could still escape.

It was really difficult for a God Emperor to hunt down another peer, unless there was careful planning in advance.

The Ancestral Gods of all the clans rarely came out and would never attack them, as it was too demeaning.

“We have reported the matter of the Heavens to all the Ancestral Gods. We’re still waiting for a response,” said Elder Chan to Su Ping, “Just focus on cultivating. You still need to consolidate your strength after the breakthrough; try to gain more experiences while traveling.”

Su Ping nodded.

“Oh, right. When you were undergoing the tribulation, did you notice a curse aimed at you?” asked Elder Chan all of a sudden.

Su Ping was momentarily taken aback, recalling the strange woman he had burnt with Heavenly Fire. He nodded. “Yes. A blood curse suddenly entered my body back then. Elder, do you know who did it?”

“Someone from the Witch Mountain,” said Elder Chan solemnly, “Do you have a feud with them? Or did someone request to cast a curse on you while you were in the middle of your tribulation? They must have planned this a long time ago. Do you have any enemies besides the Rain Clan?”

“The Witch Mountain?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows, showing coldness in his eyes. “No. I’m pretty sure the Rain Clan set this up. Since I’m going out to travel, I’ll pay their clan a visit first!”
