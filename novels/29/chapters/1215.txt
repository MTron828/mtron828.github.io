Chapter 1216: The System’s Goal

“It’s a bit like the eighth Astral Painting!”

Su Ping didn’t find it too hard to construct the eighth world. Rather, the process felt quite familiar, just like when he constructed the eighth Astral Painting using the laws he had mastered as the stars.

The current small world’s structure was made with the 108 Dao Glyphs.

The difficulty had increased, but the feeling was the same; they seemed to have the same origin.

Is it possible that the Chaos Star Chart taught by the system was actually intended for building this world? Or maybe… everything is connected when you reach a certain level?

Su Ping didn’t consider the system as a simple plugin; on the contrary, he found it rather special. At first, he thought it was a high-tech product from the Federation that he happened to come across—

But then he discovered that the system was much more powerful than the Federation itself.

The system had also revealed that there were three hosts before him.

Each host had been very famous. It seemed that the system was trying to raise a top expert.

The system’s training has a purpose. So, everything the system has offered me is for a reason. It’s meant to accelerate my growth!

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He was silent for a moment, but didn’t hear any feedback from the system. His speculation was immediately confirmed; the system would have mocked him otherwise…

“So, is it a silent yes…”

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. The system remained silent; it probably wouldn’t tell him the answer even if he asked. Still, the Chaos Star Chart was clearly a top cultivation technique.

The structure of the eighth Astral Painting was similar to that of the World of Mythical Chaos!

Had the system foreseen that he would cultivate such a world?

Was the system giving him the standard and conditions to help him cultivate that world?

Su Ping couldn’t help but ask in his heart, “System, what kind of person do you want to raise exactly?”

There was a long silence.

Right when Su Ping thought that the system wouldn’t answer—the system’s voice resounded within, with a tone unlike its usual solemness. It calmly said, “This system’s store is the best pet store in all universes. Being the owner, you should naturally become the strongest person in all universes. How else can you rein in all the pets?”

“The strongest person?”

Su Ping remembered what the system had said before. Everything could be a pet.

So… mythical creatures were no exception.

He was going to herd all creatures in all universes. Was he going to be trained to become the strongest person in history?

“Who made you then, system?” Su Ping asked.

“This system came to be along with nature; nobody made me. It’s not something that you’re supposed to know. Just focus on cultivation and try to improve the store to the highest level sooner,” said the system going back to silent mode.

“The highest level?”

Su Ping was reminded of the store’s level system. Nine was the highest level, and the store was only at level five at the moment. Still, it was already qualified for a level six upgrade. All he needed to do was to spend the corresponding energy points.

He had to reach the Ascendant State first for the store to rise to level 7. That was one of the main prerequisites. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The strongest in history…” Su Ping mumbled. He didn’t want to be the strongest in history, though. Being the best was too tiresome; he had never been interested in becoming the best in school.

Of course, he couldn’t have become the best even if he had wanted to.

Spending every day without any ambition was just as joyful.

There were always people who were better and stronger. Why bother spending one’s short life chasing and surpassing them?

“System, you’ve got the wrong guy. You should have picked a more ambitious person…” Su Ping shook his head. He dropped the topic, seeing that the system didn’t respond. He wasn’t ambitious, but he still had to become stronger to overcome the threat of Old Monster Ye.

He had to be capable of killing Celestials to intimidate others and ensure the safety of his loved ones.

The World of Mythical Chaos…

Su Ping focused his attention on constructing the world.

Having the experience of establishing the eighth Astral Painting, Su Ping was able to accelerate the construction process, even though making an eighth world was a different matter.

A world that contained infinite power and the aura of chaos was slowly developing in Su Ping’s body, above the existing seven small worlds. It contained the essence of Su Ping’s power and the 108 Dao Glyphs.

Even though he couldn’t use the glyphs just yet, Su Ping was able to move them all into the eighth world.

The two Dao Glyphs he could control were also pushed into the eighth world, making the latter unimaginably powerful.

Time flew.

Diqiong went to the residence she had arranged for Su Ping. Her eyebrows rose as she looked at the surging and dispersing energy inside, not expecting Su Ping to train in seclusion for so long.

“Humph. Do you think I can possibly lose to you? You will never catch up to me!” Diqiong shook her head and left, asking the crow guards to inform her when Su Ping ended his training.

The cultivation array was an independent space removed from the outside world. Abundant energy surged in, which was incessantly infused by the great tree branches.

Aside from Su Ping, the Little Skeleton, the Inferno Dragon, the Dark Dragon Hound and the rest of his pets were occupying different corners inside that space.

The place was extremely spacious; it could even accommodate a planet.

All the pets were currently displaying their real appearances while establishing their own small worlds based on Su Ping’s teachings.

A couple of small worlds were revolving above each pet. Their bodies were also being cleansed by the power of chaos coming from the branches as they were condensing small worlds. They grew considerably more in size—the Inferno Dragon and Little White were both a thousand meters long. They were as intimidating as mountains.

All pets had become Star Lords one after the other. Even the Purple Python—which was the weakest at the beginning—had become a peak Star Lord too. It established five small worlds, and was even capable of crushing primordial gods.

Bzzing~!

The entire cultivation space was suddenly shaking. The movement could be detected even in other points of time inside that training space; it actually ignored time and space.

The pets stopped cultivating and opened their eyes in shock, only to see a shadow as glamorous as a lotus flower rising behind Su Ping’s back.

The flower was producing a brilliant and terrifying pressure. The Little Skeleton and the rest of the gang saw that the lotus flower had eight layers as it rose!

The eighth world was small, placed at the very top, and yet it seemed to contain an entire universe.

There were 108 brilliant stars in the world, which were quite distinguishable.

The world was also surrounded by the hazy power of chaos. Lightning bolts were striking nonstop; it seemed to be the beginning of a universe.

A distant and profound pressure was spread out, making all the pets dodge instinctively. Even though they had been through countless dangers and died time and again in the cultivation sites, they still felt awe from the bottom of their hearts. They were scared of chaos and the distant past.

“It’s done.”

Su Ping opened his eyes, from which a dazzling light and symbols of laws surfaced. Dozens of Dao Patterns flashed around him while gathering an unimaginable aura.

Su Ping had never felt stronger. The world before his eyes had also changed; he could see the flow and distribution of power in the cultivation space, and even the three thick Dao Pattern structures supporting it. Each pattern contained dozens of laws.

“The eighth world…”

Su Ping raised a hand; the eight small worlds shrunk and floated in his palm like a glamorous lotus flower. He could feel their destructive power.

Adding an eighth world made him feel completely different.

It should be easy for me to defeat Ascendants now, but the outcome against a Celestial remains to be seen…

Su Ping had seen the performances of top Heavenly Lords such as his first senior brother in the alliance’s commandery contest; he thought he could deal with them easily. That reminded him of the system’s ranking, so he summoned the listing.

He ranked first among human Star Lords, and second considering all species!

The results made him feel some delight. He was happy, but the outcome wasn’t surprising. After all, his mentor in the Heaven Path Institute had mentioned in passing that only an Ancestral God had managed to establish seven small worlds.

Su Ping had established eight small worlds.

Furthermore, he believed that his small worlds were of the highest quality. The eighth world in particular, was undoubtedly a top small world!

He reckoned that he could easily kill an Ascendant with nothing but the World of Mythical Chaos!

That was, not even counting his Ascendant level body.

His body had in fact progressed further after the bloodline advancement, and it was filled with explosive power. His every cell seemed to contain a star; a punch could destroy a galaxy.

There’s someone else above me on the rank; maybe that’s the system’s previous host, or maybe it’s another genius.?Su Ping wasn’t truly bothered; the ranking was just a way for him to measure his combat ability. He wasn’t interested in being at the very top. For him it only served as a measure for interactions; he could be more reckless if he was at the top, or more careful if he wasn’t.

I should practice with someone with Celestial cultivation…

Su Ping dismissed his power and looked at the Little Skeleton and the rest, only to discover that they had yet to establish seven small worlds. He wasn’t in a rush to leave; the Golden Crow site was a great cultivation place. Spending more time there wouldn’t hurt.

“Continue cultivating,” said Su Ping to his pets.

He also took the chance to teach them the path of mythical creatures and the two Dao Glyphs.

However, Su Ping found that it was very difficult to teach them. The Dao Glyphs in particular, were too sophisticated for him to pass on just yet; after all, even he had to understand fully first.

As for the path of mythical creatures—

It seemed to be an innate path of his constitution that couldn’t be taught. Even if the Little Skeleton and the others could understand, they couldn’t establish an eighth world with it. After all, they didn’t belong to the Primitive Chaos Clan.

Furthermore, they weren’t graced with 108 natural Dao Glyphs like he was.

Su Ping felt some regret. It seemed that his pets couldn’t go past the seven worlds’ mark.

That is, unless they had an epiphany and established an eighth world on their own.

However, their eighth world wouldn’t be the same as Su Ping’s.

Nevermind. They should be stronger than their peers with seven worlds. They might even become Ancestral Gods, as long as their bloodlines improve. This foundation is solid enough.

Su Ping wasn’t too disappointed; his pets had already grown to become unbelievably powerful, taking into account their mediocre bloodlines at the beginning.

Su Ping created a space of his own while his pets practiced, all to test his new abilities and the ways to make use of Dao Patterns.

…

…

Diqiong’s golden nest—one of the guards went to report.

Diqiong—who had been training in seclusion—paused her cultivation and was about to move, but then she stopped herself after thinking for a moment. If she were to meet Su Ping the moment he came out, wouldn’t it look like she had been waiting for him?

She belonged to the Golden Crow’s royal family. She certainly had pride to uphold.

“Humph, I’ll just let him wait for a while,” said Diqiong to the guard.

Su Ping left the cultivation place with his pets.

“If I may ask, is there anyone here willing to practice with me?” Su Ping politely asked the only crow guarding the door.

The latter raised his eyebrows. He wasn’t fond of Su Ping, but he certainly didn’t dislike him; he only knew that the man was an honorable guest. The guard looked at Su Ping up and down with a disdainful attitude. “You want to practice with us?”

“Yes, with someone a level stronger than you,” said Su Ping sincerely.

The guard was angered by the request. “If you want to practice, I’m here for you. Even though you’re the one who proposed the practice, Princess Diqiong gave orders and you’re an honorable guest, so I won’t be taking advantage of you.”

“No, no, no. I fear that I’d be taking advantage of you,” Su Ping quickly declined.

The guard burst into fury, his whole body unleashing golden light. “I’ll give you a chance to apologize, otherwise don’t blame me for hurting you!”

“I’m not kidding,” said Su Ping quickly.

That was the last straw; the guard revealed himself as an enormous, thousand-meters long crow wreathed in golden flames. It swooped toward Su Ping like a setting sun.

The creature was covered by the power of chaos. The unique aura of a mythical creature made it seem dominating.

Su Ping would have acted seriously if it were in the past, but he currently saw nothing but flaws in the flames covering the guard; the Ascendant laws found there weren’t nearly as solid as Dao Patterns.

“Freeze!”

Su Ping raised a hand and pointed with a finger.

Time and space seemed to become solid all of a sudden, including the swooping Golden Crow.

The beast was paralyzed in midair. The space where Su Ping pointed began to crack, then the whole world fell apart like a torn painting. The Golden Crow’s surroundings were also destroyed; the fire covering him was removed.

The Golden Crow rolled his eyes in shock. “This is impossible!”

Su Ping saw that the Dao Patterns he released had shattered and tied both time and space. It was really simple; his opponent was completely unable to see or block the attack.

I think it’s on a whole different level…

Su Ping felt how terrifying Dao Patterns were. That Golden Crow guard was undoubtedly as strong as a Heavenly Lord, and yet the creature was defenseless in front of him. He even thought about how casually he could deal the killing blow.
