Chapter 777: Nothing Happened

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Yes.”

The old man wearing the purple robe nodded and accepted the tasks.

He was quite relieved to see that his father wasn’t reckless. Being the current administrator of the Ryan family, he knew that even though the family was strong, it would suffer huge losses if it had a head-on clash with someone in the mid phase of the Star State.

The more successful people were, the more likely they would cut their losses in time.

“I’ll ask around in the Star State Circle later on and see if anybody knows him,” said O’Neil grimly.

The black-haired woman and the white-robed old man looked at each other silently.

On the same day—

At night on the Kamp Continent, planet Rhea.

Woffett City was ablaze with lights under the night sky, as if it were day time.

Many people had gathered on the street where a huge battle took place during the day. Even the nearby streets had been crammed by battle pet warriors who had gone there to watch.

Too many people had witnessed the battle in the afternoon; the news couldn’t be blocked, especially not in the Federation where information was transmitted at an unimaginable speed.

The news could have been transmitted to other planets, had it not been for network limitations.

Everybody in the Kamp Continent had learned of the Star State battle on the street.

As for the other continents, certain well-informed forces would receive reports; they were putting attention to the matter too. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

According to some informants, some of the Ryan family’s honored guests had been involved in the battle!

Such news had an underlying meaning: someone had challenged the leading family’s authority on Rhea. It was definitely huge.

“Do you think the master of the Ryan family will come in person?”

“What is the background of this shop? Pixie Pet Store? It’s my first time hearing about it.”

“Is it an extraterrestrial corporation that intends to establish branches on Rhea? If that’s the case, they should make friends with the Ryan family instead of fighting it, don’t you think?”

“I was told that someone from the Ryan family was attracted to a beautiful girl in the shop and wanted to take her away, hence the fight.”

“A beautiful girl? What beautiful girl?”

“Dude, you haven’t been to the shop yet, have you? There’s a beautiful employee working there; she eclipses Alice in every way. You’ll believe me once you see her... I divorced my wife right after I went back home on the day I saw her!”

“Seriously? Buddy, are you really that ruthless?”

“That’s not a big deal. I would rather stay single and wait for her!”

“!!”

People gossiped in the crowd. There was no telling who started it, but the cause of the war was eventually attributed to a woman.

Many people then spoke about it for a while, remarking that beautiful girls were always the cause of disasters.

The customers who had been to Su Ping’s shop and seen Joanna, however, said that her beauty was mind-boggling to them, and that they would have fought for her too if they were strong enough!

The Ryan family wouldn’t get to step in at all!

“It’s already night time. I wonder if the Ryan family will send someone else.”

“Considering the Ryan family’s speed, it should be arriving from the Central Continent any minute now.”

“Will we be accidentally hurt in the battle later if we observe from here?”

“Are you nuts? There are so many people here. I’m here because someone from the Laiyefa family is here too. How could the Ryans fight in the city? They’ll probably move the battlefield to the tertiary space if they start a battle. We won’t feel a thing.”

“That’s true. But why aren’t they here yet?”

The observers were almost running out of patience.

The pet assessment shop across the street was also affected by the street collapsing; still, it had defensive measures and the devices inside weren’t damaged.

“That’s all I know.”

Cleo stood obediently in her office, while in front of her was the holograph of a middle-aged man made of data streams.

The man frowned and asked, “Is that all?”

“Yes.”

Cleo bit her lips and said, “I promise that everything I said is true. I didn’t know the shop at all, and I only left my pets for training there out of curiosity, and because I thought there was a master trainer in the shop after Lily bought two amazing battle pets from that place.”

The middle-aged man didn’t seem to hear her; he was in deep thought.

A moment later, he finally refocused and said indifferently, “Got it. The family will investigate it soon; you have nothing to worry about if your confession is true. Since you’re there, continue your observations and report to us immediately if you find anything.”

Cleo was quite relieved. She asked prudently, “My lord, may I ask how the shop’s boss offended our family?”

The middle-aged man frowned and looked at her. Considering her talent, he thought for a moment and said, “The shop owner, the young man you saw earlier, killed Prince Randall.”

“What!”

Cleo’s eyes widened with shock.

Randall was killed by Su Ping?

She couldn’t be more familiar with the name Randall, being a family member.

He was part of the main family branch, and was one of the three most talented descendants. Everybody had high hopes for him!

Even though she was just as talented—and would have grown as strong as Randall if she had enough resources—her position in the family was much lower than his!

There would have been no consequences even if Randall would have accidentally killed her!

Conversely, she would have been severely punished if she would have hurt him, even if only mildly. Her cultivation would have been abolished, or she might have been sentenced to death!

The main branch’s authority was not to be ever contested!

“Many people are aware of this matter, but it’s not exactly something that we’re proud of, so it is best if you better keep this to yourself,” said the middle-aged man indifferently and ended the communication.

The holograph instantly vanished.

Cleo stood, completely stunned. All she could think of was Su Ping’s calm face.

The day’s events had shocked her so much that her soul had almost left her body.

That guy is a Star State expert!

He also killed Prince Randall!

What emboldened him to do that?

Even if he is at the Star State, it’s not rational to offend the Ryan family, is it?

“Why did he kill Randall? Did the sixth prince piss him off? He must have...” Cleo was stunned for a long time while wearing a bitter smile.

She didn’t believe that Su Ping would have attacked a member of the Ryan family for no reason.

He could have killed her easily back when she was in his shop if there were grievances between him and the Ryans.

Unless... she was so insignificant that Su Ping didn’t figure out her connection with the Ryan family.

But that didn’t make sense, as her clothes clearly had the family emblem!

It was then obvious that Su Ping didn’t hate the Ryan family back then. Randall’s death might have been purely accidental. Alternatively, he might have pissed off the Star State expert while oblivious of the latter’s status.

After all, that guy had been pretending to be an Ocean State warrior.

Why do you have to pretend to be such a lowly fellow when you’re actually this strong!

You could pretend to be a Fate State expert if you prefer to keep a low profile. Nobody would dare to mess with you.

Also, nobody would feel surprised or shocked to see a Fate State warrior on the road. Such a disguise is both low-key and less troublesome. Wouldn’t that be much better?

“Good thing I didn’t say anything outrageous back then. I’m so scared...” Cleo was terrified since she remembered how she had snapped angrily at Su Ping in his shop. Su Ping could have then revealed his identity and straightaway request her family to have her killed if he were pushed hard enough.

After all, her family would never risk offending a Star State bigshot for the sake of a junior such as herself.

However, Su Ping had killed Randall, a talented heir of the Ryan family; the whole thing would not be easy to get over with.

Cleo took another deep breath and heaved a sigh. She walked out of the office with Lily in tow, then looked at the shop across the street through the window on the second floor.

The street was currently jam-packed with people.

However, the queue outside Su Ping’s shop was still obvious.

Cleo was in no mood to join the queue anymore, even if she were given a chance to stand at the front of the line; her life was more important.

“People should have already arrived from the Central Continent. Let me ask my father...” Cleo checked the time and felt confused. She quickly made a phone call to contact her father.

“What?”

Cleo was stunned yet again upon hearing the message over the phone.

“What’s wrong, cousin?” Lily was stunned for a moment; she didn’t eavesdrop on Cleo’s call out of courtesy, blocking her own ears for a moment.

Once she hung up the phone, Cleo said, still unable to process what she had heard, “My father said that the family didn’t react, although everybody had learned of the matter. Grandfather didn’t even leave the mysterious realm.”

“He didn’t?” asked Lily in disbelief, “Is our family going to let the matter go? B-But, we’re talking of Prince Randall being killed!”

Cleo was also in a trance.

That was so true.

The victim was Randall!

He was the brilliant star of the family’s younger generation, an unreachable genius to look up to.

Still, the family was intending to let things slide after he was killed?

Just now, Garland was escorted into the shop by him; the other two guests escaped. Do they think that the guy is not just a Star State expert, that even grandfather found it tricky to deal with him? Cleo thought, only to be horrified by the possibility.

Time flew.

Midnight soon arrived.

However, the starry sky above them was just as brilliant.

Half of the observers on the street had left. Even so, the street was still quite crowded.
