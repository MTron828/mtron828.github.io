Chapter 846: To Michelle

Su Ping vanished from the store and then reached a place in the sky, tens of thousands of meters high. He saw that Xingyue Shen’er and the others were waiting.

“Let’s go.”

Once she saw Su Ping, Xingyue Shen’er said, “You can do your secluded training on my spaceship. I’ll call you when we reach the Amir Royal Academy.”

“About that...” Su Ping coughed and said, “Why don’t we go there by planet? It’ll be more convenient.”

“Okay.” Xingyue Shen’er unconsciously nodded, but then realized what she had just heard. “By planet?”

She suddenly realized that the planet didn’t belong there, and that it was absolutely still, not interacting with the other planets, at all. She asked in shock, “Are you saying that the old... the bigshot behind your back is going to push the planet and escort you there?”

She was about to say “old guy,” but she remembered that the other Ascendant State bigshots weren’t not as close as her father; they could find such a form of address offensive.

O’Neil widened his eyes too. Is that Ascendant expert still on the planet? Will the planet be pushed away again?

“...”

He was dumbfounded, and then felt like crying. Why does that bigshot have to push my planet? Was there not another way to escort Su Ping?

Su Ping knew it was impossible to explain, so he coughed and said, “Well, she likes this planet.”

“She likes this planet...”

O’Neil didn’t know whether to cry or smile after hearing such a reply. It was definitely an honor that an Ascendant State expert would be interested in the planet he managed, but this expert seemed overly fond of it. Did his planet have to go anywhere Su Ping went in the future?

His planet would become a wanderer in space...

Everybody was lost for words. Someone looked at O’Neil sympathetically; he was the lord in name and a servant in practice...

“Fine.” Xingyue Shen’er didn’t know what to say either. Some Ascendant did have some quirks. But that was fine; it wasn’t her planet anyway, and it was just one planet.

“If so, the journey will probably take longer,” said Xingyue Shen’er.

Su Ping asked, “Will we get there in time?”

“Yes. Fine then, let’s take this planet too, and take this chance to meet the bigshot backing you,” said Xingyue Shen’er.

Su Ping was happy to hear that. “That’s great.”

Then, he suddenly thought of something and then found O’Neil. He asked, “Brother Zeus, are you fine with this arrangement?”

Am I fine with the arrangement?

Definitely not!

But do you think I would dare voice it?

O’Neil was quite depressed in his heart, but he didn’t show anything on the surface. Instead, he said with a smile, “It is my honor to be appreciated by an Ascendant State expert.”

“That’s good.” Su Ping nodded.

Then, he led them back to Woffett City.

All the customers fell silent when they arrived. They had previously seen the strangers beat off a Star Lord; it was truly horrifying.

They also saw the Lord of Rhea among them. However, the high and mighty lord whose statues were everywhere across the globe was following a girl, while the others were respectful and humble.

The position of a person in a crowd often indicated their importance. The Lord of Rhea was clearly at the rear of the crowd, while his peers seemed just as strong as him.

“So many bigshots. Are they all in the Star State?”

“Cut the crap. The two leaders might be Star Lords!”

“They’re almost like gods. To what does Rhea owe the pleasure of receiving this many bigshots?”

All the planet’s inhabitants had their eyes focused on that street. It was certain that Woffett’s economy would soar again, to eventually become the best city on Rhea.

“Is this your store?” Xingyue Shen’er looked at the Pixie Pet Store and gazed at the statues by the gate. Then, she glanced at the fat, low-level rat that was crouching underneath one of the statues. The rat wasn’t strong; it wasn’t even a Legend.

However... she easily recognized that the energy inside the rat was unbelievably disproportionate to its bloodline!

“Please follow me.”

Su Ping led the way. The members of the Alliance of Stars would be his potential customers as soon as his store became capable of training Star State pets.

Considering the store’s revenue, the function would be unlocked very soon.

Everybody entered the store and soon met Joanna, Tang Ruyan, and Green Lady, the most eye-catching of all.

In terms of beauty, Green Lady and Joanna were both impeccable in their own way; their styles were different, and yet both were stunningly gorgeous.

However, Green Lady was in the Ascendant State; she was more eye-catching thanks to her aura.

Joanna was just a clone. She was inevitably much less intimidating.

“Is she...”

Xingyue Shen’er looked at Green Lady with solemn eyes, while also amazed by her looks. She also sensed the same intimidating aura her old man radiated.

“It’s an honor to meet you, senior.” Xingyue Shen’er instantly lowered her head and paid respects.

She could act willfully before her father, but she had to show basic courtesy to other Ascendants. After all, they didn’t care for her at all.

The others quickly realized the situation based on her actions and hurried to pay respects.

Green Lady saw that they were the people who had lent Su Ping a hand; she then looked at Su Ping and asked, “Who are they?”

“They’re friends who dropped by to say hi,” said Su Ping with a smile.

Everybody including Xingyue Shen’er was surprised by Su Ping’s casual attitude. They guessed that the Ascendant was Su Ping’s backer, but they didn’t expect him to interact so casually with her. Are they blood related?

“Okay.” Green Lady nodded at the visitors, not bothering to add anything else.

She had followed the Twilight Deity King and met countless brilliant people in too many worlds. She was cold even to those who were as strong as her, not to mention to those who were significantly weaker.

“Everybody, I’m planning to close the store so I can cultivate. Why don’t you take a tour around the planet in the meantime?” said Su Ping, who planned to make the most of the time available to cultivate.

Xingyue Shen’er raised her head and glanced at Green Lady. Then she nodded at Su Ping and said, “Okay, just do what you must. Call me if you need anything. I’ll be right here on this planet. You don’t have my number, right? I’ll give it to you. Contact me if you need any help...”

Then, she looked at Green Lady again and realized that her help would probably be unnecessary, especially when an Ascendant State expert was by his side.

“Sure.”

Su Ping nodded and exchanged numbers with Xingyue Shen’er.

He had a sudden thought right before they left. The members of the Alliance of Stars were sort of his connections now. He asked, “Well, there’s indeed something that I wonder if you could help me with.”

“What is it?”

Everybody was refreshed. Helping Su Ping was actually an opportunity for them!

Most people would turn down weaklings when they asked for help, but it would be an opportunity to befriend the strong!

“I need some training materials. I wonder if you have any sources to get them. I’ll definitely repay you if you can find them for me.”

Su Ping intended to have them help him find materials for the third level of the Solar Bulwark. It was easier to find materials since he was at the moment connected to the Federation.

“That’s easy. What do you need, Brother Heaven Destroyer? Just tell me. I have a herb store and many suppliers.”

“I have friends who can help Brother Heaven Destroyer search for materials too.”

“What do you need?” asked Xingyue Shen’er with a solemn and straight face. She didn’t promise him she would get anything he needed, because she realized that what he needed was probably something extremely rare, or the Ascendant by his side would’ve gotten it for him.

Su Ping would remember their favor, seeing how friendly they were. That was the benefit of having a lot of friends.

“These are the things I need...”

Su Ping instantly listed the materials for the third level of the Solar Bulwark; he projected their pictures and descriptions with astral power.

All the materials were manifested.

Everybody watched and made notes, promising that they would try their best to help Su Ping find them.

“Thank you very much.” Su Ping cupped his hands and thanked everybody present.

“You’re too kind, Brother Heaven Destroyer.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I’ll do my best. No need to be so courteous, Brother Heaven Destroyer.”

“We haven’t repaid your favor yet, Brother Heaven Destroyer. This is no big deal.”

Everybody smiled politely.

...

Su Ping began to cultivate in seclusion after seeing everybody off.

As usual, he closed the store. He had confirmed the planet’s trajectory with Xingyue Shen’er. They were leaving for Michelle, a planet where the Amir Royal Academy was located.

It was quite the respectable tier-1 planet, much more developed than Rhea in every aspect.

Su Ping gave the Lord Badge to Green Lady after setting the coordinates, asking her to follow the route.

Then, Su Ping took Joanna to the Demigod Burial.

Su Ping preferred training in the cultivation sites; he would be fine even if he accidentally died during training, since he could always revive himself. Joanna would also be there, looking after him in the Demigod Burial, so that he wouldn’t be disturbed.

“Huh?”

Green Lady was slightly stunned to see the space channel that Su Ping had invoked. She vaguely sensed that it was linked to another world; that was something that even she might not be capable of doing: breaking the barrier between the two worlds.

However, Su Ping seemed to have opened the channel with ease. She didn’t even feel the slightest energy waves.

Is that the power of the terrifying will?

The Green Lady was solemn. She was left in awe when she felt an ancient will as she signed the contract; there was indeed a veritable bigshot behind Su Ping’s back. It could be a Deity King or someone even stronger!

Green Lady was further reassured that following Su Ping had been the right choice; he could really have a way to visit the Chaotic Realm of the Undead.

Tang Ruyan was nearby; that was the first time she had witnessed Su Ping enter a cultivation site, which left her dumbfounded. She had seen Su Ping entering rooms that she couldn’t access, so she simply thought that he was training there. Never did she think that Su Ping could travel to another world with a power she couldn’t understand.

No wonder the pets he trained became so strong. It was because they weren’t trained in the store, which was too small for them to exercise.

Thinking it through, Tang Ruyan wore a troubled expression; she found that Su Ping was even more enigmatic and far away from her than she had thought...

...

Once entering the Demigod Burial, Su Ping traveled with Joanna back to the palace where she lived.

The God Warriors on the mountain had been instructed to lock down the area and make sure that nobody disturbed Su Ping during his training.

Su Ping then trained in the following days on an open ground at the mountaintop.

He took out the fruits that Xingyue Shen’er gave him and swallowed them. He then enshrouded them with astral power for a quick absorption.

It would have been hard for an ordinary Fate State cultivator to absorb the fruit, just like digesting a pine. However, Su Ping only needed half an hour to absorb one.

The first fruit was quickly absorbed, and Su Ping grasped a law named domination during his state of meditation.

It was quite a powerful law that could dominate other laws. Of course, it would only be able to interfere if other laws were even more powerful.

Su Ping then swallowed the second fruit.

The second fruit brought the law of prophecy, which belonged to the time class. He wasn’t able to directly grasp the law of time, but there was a possibility that he would reach the field of time if he attained a better understanding of the law.

The law of prophecy allowed him to predict dangers and foresee the enemy’s attacks. It was very useful in melee battles and could work even against the laws that were even more powerful.

Other laws, such as Su Ping’s Boom, was a pure offensive law that would be crushed by more powerful laws.

He continued ingesting more and more fruits...

All the fruits were absorbed, and the laws melded into Su Ping’s body. Some of the laws contained in the fruits overlapped, but their repetitive ingestion allowed him to get a deeper understanding of the laws, finding more of their usages.

While Su Ping was training in seclusion, in the outside world—

Green Lady was already pushing Rhea towards Michelle, according to the map displayed on the Lord Badge. The planet disappeared with a blue, glittering trail in the dark and quiet universe.
