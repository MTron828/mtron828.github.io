Chapter 1267 The Skeleton Demon (2)

“An Ascendant against a Celestial…” someone mumbled. Those who were seeing the battle believed that this precedent would be recorded in history; this skeleton pet would become a legend in the universe!

“So, it’s possible for an Ascendant to do this?”

Liu Xia, Hai Mei and the other top Heavenly Lords watched the scene in a daze, unable to believe what they were seeing. Still, they knew that all of it was real.

The pet had unleashed a power that surpassed theirs.

It was shocking and embarrassing. They were all deeply touched too!

Once feeling the resistance, Ye Chen widened his eyes and roared with a fury coming from deep within his soul, “Die now!!!”

His hair fluttered furiously, and he harnessed all his power in a downward attack.

All of the countless creatures in Ye Chen’s universe listened to his command and offered their power. The energy from billions of creatures was manifested, ready to press down and swallow the Little Skeleton.

The latter didn’t even have a chance to escape. It would be immediately engulfed and crushed by that universe if it couldn’t hold on for much longer.

“Go to hell!!”

Mo Ri also took action. His dark universe was compressed and turned into a tiny black hole that dashed towards the Little Skeleton’s chest.

The two Celestials attacked at the same time with their universes. Let alone an Ascendant, even a Celestial would prefer to dodge their combined power.

Many people who were watching the battle couldn’t help but mumble, “It’s over…”

How is it possible to resist the attacks of two universes?

The Little Skeleton was looking intently at the incoming universes. Flames hopped in its eye sockets. The suddenly flared up the next moment, expanding to cover its head, almost like burning hair!

“Ughhhhhhhh…”

The undead creature’s hollow mouth let out a hoarse roar. Bones were separated on its chest area and another pair of arms grew out. Meanwhile, the Ascendant State worlds behind its back dazzled brilliantly again!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three Ascendant worlds were detonated one after the other. The violent power made its flames shine even brighter and affect a wider area. Two golden fists were condensed; they were the Fists of Exorcist that Su Ping had cultivated. The Little Skeleton had also grasped that technique; it performed the skill at that moment and stopped Mo Ri’s dark universe.

However, the clash with the dark universe pushed the skeleton back continuously.

“Roar!!”

The Little Skeleton roared and detonated another Ascendant world. It stood still in the void as if rooted on the spot. The fire in its eye sockets were like blood as the pet blocked the dark universe forcefully.

It seemed that the skeleton had infinite physical strength!

It was actually able to withstand the impact of two universes!

This scene seemed to be frozen in time, etched in everyone’s eyes. Countless people widened their eyes, unable to believe such a miraculous scene.

Both Mo Ri and Ye Chen felt completely at a loss. They could not believe it!

“This is impossible!”

Mo Ri lost his cool. What kind of strength was that?

Ye Chen was in a trance, but he soon recovered. Madness filled his eyes as he roared, “Keep going! It’s just an Ascendant pet. How can it stop me? How?”.

His body expanded significantly as he rushed out while laying a hand on his small universe. That hand seemed to contain the power of hundreds of planets; the universe shook and pressed on towards the Little Skeleton.

Black flames emerged from the small universe, which then spread to the Little Skeleton through the bone saber.

Mo Ri realized what was going on. He dashed and reappeared in front of the Little Skeleton. While confronting the pet with the two universes, he suddenly attacked with the Nether Saber, now with the awakened red python spirit.

The Little Skeleton was resisting the pressure imposed by Ye Chen’s small universe. Caught unprepared by Mo Ri’s attack, it was instantly tied up by the red python; dents and cracks appeared on the corrupted bones.

Mo Ri turned and kicked, sending the Little Skeleton flying. A lot of its bones fell off as it rolled in the void. It suddenly made a stabbing motion in the void, as if it were plain soil, right when it was about to hit Su Ping. It somehow stopped!

“Go to hell together!” Crazy eyed, Ye Chen attacked with his small universe again.

Mo Ri didn’t spare the pet any mercy, either. He could tell that the skeleton’s potential had been spent. Even if caught, it would only be an ordinary pet; might as well destroy it.

The Little Skeleton quickly got back to its feet when they continued their combined attacks. Its figure looked extremely slim while eclipsed by the two magnificent and brilliant universes.

It was like a tiny creature in comparison.

The scene seemed like a repetition of a time when the tiny skeleton was standing next to Su Ping.

However, Su Ping had turned into a tiny being to protect this time.

The universes had yet to reach them, but their power was already enough for normal Ascendants to spout blood and kneel. However, the Little Skeleton stood ground like a monument.

Some of its bones fell off and moved to cover Su Ping.

Su Ping, while paralyzed, realized what the Little Skeleton was doing. Desperation and madness made his brain boil; he wanted to shout and put a stop to it, but he was unable to control his body; he couldn’t even shed a tear.

Su Ping was practically wearing armor as the bones covered him.

The Little Skeleton became even thinner, but it still charged at the two universes. There was another explosion, and the pet’s seventh world was detonated.

A roar echoed throughout the sky as the violent power surged out.

Brilliant sword auras surged like tides and slashed at the two universes with a brutal force!

Both Ye Chen and Mo Ri grunted as they were stopped for a moment. Celestials rarely used their small universes directly to fight, especially because it was hard for them to recover. Their small universes had received damage just then.

Shocked and infuriated, both of them were determined to kill the Little Skeleton; it was all they could do to recover from the utter embarrassment caused by an Ascendant creature.

After a boom, the two small universes moved straight down and drowned the Little Skeleton.

A dazzling light burst out, the blast pushing Su Ping hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, closer to those observing the battle.

Everyone could see Su Ping clearly, and were astonished to see him unscathed. They soon noticed that the bones covering Su Ping’s skin were full of cracks. The skeleton had clearly blocked the terrifying blast at the last moment.

“What a terrifying pet!”

“It can mislead into believing it’s a Celestial pet! What bloodline does it have? I’ve never heard of anything like it!”

“I’ve never seen such a tough skeleton.”

All the observers had mixed feelings. The Heavenly Lords from the Heavenly Devil Alliance were staring at Su Ping; their eyes were blinking as they pondered whether to make a move and execute Su Ping while he remained in that weird status.

They would surely be awarded for it. However, Su Ping had fought two Celestials for a very long time; even his pet was terrifying. They weren’t sure of being successful, so none dared to act recklessly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Su Ping’s head was ringing at the moment; his eyes were almost blank. His body was static, but he could tell that the bond between him and the Little Skeleton was fading.

That was the sign of death!

His pupils narrowed, and his soul was almost exploding with madness

However, his body was still unable to move despite all his emotions. Furthermore, the more power he summoned, the more restrained he became.

The next moment-Su Ping suddenly felt that his body was drifting slowly.

The bones that had formerly covered his body began to fall slowly, reconstituting half of the Little Skeleton.

It was holding Su Ping with one hand, and crawling forward in the void with the other.
