Chapter 903: Divine Constitution’s Inherited Technique

“There are so many geniuses!”

Both the young man with golden wheels in his eyes and Su Jin’er had grave looks after the battle; four enemies from the latest group encountered were as strong as them. Adding the ones they had met earlier, they felt that there were at least a dozen contestants who were as strong as them.

They still thought that very few people were like Su Ping, but then again, they realized that the universe was truly too big. They were very special, up to the brim with secrets, but other people were in similar conditions.

Linghu Jian, Dragon Emperor, the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady and the others were currently resting with heavy hearts. Their greatest reward from the battle was that their pride was completely gone, feeling like ignorant beginners; scared of everything again.

Su Ping was taking a break too; he had seen it coming and wasn’t too surprised. After all, he had seen a lot of eccentrics in his outings to the cultivation sites. Not just the battle pet warriors, even some of the wild beasts were as strong as Star Lords.

Diqiong and the other Golden Crows he has met could also be counted as monsters able to challenge opponents beyond their level.

Even the beasts were able to do this, let alone human beings who had countless resources.

They met another group of people several hours later; they only had ten members, led by a top genius who had Ascendant State potential. The latter soon realized something was wrong the moment he fought Su Jin’er, so he quickly fled.

Su Ping and the young man who had golden wheels in his eyes tried to stop him but failed. Su Ping didn’t think much of it, but the young man was regretful. Ousting a top genius from the top hundred would have definitely attracted the Ascendants’ attention, and even that of Lord Supreme.

Unfortunately, the opportunity was gone again.

Half a day later, the continent shrinked again, and only a few hills could be seen in the distance.

There were six groups in total. Apart from Su Ping’s, the other group had members ranging from ten to a hundred; there were also top geniuses whose compatriots had been completely eliminated.

Those geniuses wandered about with cold eyes. They would probably survive as long as they weren’t attacked collectively.

“Brother, I can see that you have a large group. My friend told me that some of you are top geniuses just like me. We’re the strongest around, why don’t we settle this in peace by abandoning the unworthy members and avoid fighting each other?”

A dozen men stood on a mountain on the east side. There weren’t as many as in Su Ping’s group, but two of them were the top geniuses that Su Ping had defeated earlier.

The young man in the lead who had just spoken was tall and handsome. Some of the people around him seemed to have become nervous the moment he made that proposal.

On Su Ping’s side—Fang Hanxue, Shirley and some of the others looked at Su Ping anxiously too.

After having gone through so many battles, they knew they were too weak to make it to the top hundred. Even the geniuses like Linghu Jian and Dragon Emperor were at risk of being eliminated. It would be a good thing if Su Ping were to abandon some members, considering the interest of top experts such as him and Dragon Emperor, who would avoid getting hurt.

“That’s not a bad idea,” said Su Ping, making a lot of people nervous. But he then quickly asked, “However, we’re not the only group. If both our groups abandon some people, how can we ensure that the other groups will also abandon their members, so that we can end this competition in peace?”

The young man smiled and said, “We can join hands since you’re interested. I heard that you have several members who are very strong. So do I. We’ll be able to negotiate with others if we join forces. I don’t think anyone would dare to disagree, what do you say?”

Su Ping smiled and said, “It’s not a bad idea. But who will be in charge if we do join forces?”

The young man seemed to have expected the question. He replied with a smile, “The strongest would be the logical choice. However, our combination is intended to reduce unnecessary fighting. So, let’s just communicate if anything happens.”

Su Ping nodded and said, “We don’t need to abandon anyone yet if that’s the case. Our members would make a total of fifty; we can join our forces first and discuss with others.”

The young man realized what Su Ping was thinking. He said with a smile, “That works too.”

There were two young men with Ascendant State potential behind him; both remained silent. They had escaped from Su Ping and all their allies had been defeated. However, they didn’t show any anger on their faces; they were considering the big picture.

The others were relieved to hear the deal struck between Su Ping and the young man. But there was still a lingering worry. Someone would probably be abandoned in the end if other groups did join the group.

“Let’s go and ask them,” said the young man to Su Ping.

Su Ping thought for a moment and agreed.

Even though Linghu Jian’s sword array had been established there, it was time to march out to fight others; it was better to take action while the other groups had yet to merge.

Leaving the sword array wasn’t a huge loss; Su Ping had ascertained that it was only eighty percent as powerful as one of his attacks. Linghu Jian was only exaggerating when he claimed that it could defeat anyone below the Star Lord State.

“My name is Wu Linchuan. How should I address you?”

“Su Ping.”

The young man nodded; he then led his subordinates to one of their turfs.

Su Ping followed them; Su Jin’er and Linghu Jian tagged along. No one made a comment; Su Ping had the final say in their group. Su Jin’er was the only one who could offer suggestions, but she had never disagreed with him; it seemed that she didn’t care about anything.

The two groups were moving forward together, but they were still mutually vigilant in secret. They were currently one big group, but Su Ping didn’t really trust them.

Such an oral deal could be broken at any moment.

The sky thousands of kilometers on the west side turned red while they moved forward; thunderous waves were approaching, as if a massive battle were in progress.

Su Ping and Wu Linchuan looked at each other. They quickly changed their direction to the west side without uttering a word.

It would be for the better if they could seize the opportunity to eliminate the losers.

They had to kick others out if they wanted to stay.

On the west side—

A great battle was being waged. Dazzling light was flashing all over; all kinds of elemental skills covered the sky and tore the tertiary space open, filling it with violent particles.

The power of laws was swept left and right; a lot of dispersed laws had been reduced to a hazy mist.

At the center of the battlefield—three men were fighting a single person who was entirely golden, looking like a god. He was holding a lance that had crescent blades on one end. The spear was currently shrouded by a thick layer of laws and divine power that destroyed all the incoming attacks.

“Hoooooooooooo!” he roared. His sound waves cleared the surrounding chaotic energy and revealed the sunny sky. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You’re just a bunch of country bumpkins. You think you can make it all the way to the top hundred? Break!”

The man’s eyes radiated a dazzling light. He waved the long spear, causing a huge hole in the space to form. It looked like a vortex, which had a terrifying attraction force.

“Not good! My power of laws has been swallowed!”

“Look at his body! Is it an inherited technique from his Divine Constitution?”

The three men who were fighting him narrowed their eyes. The other geniuses who were attacking further away with secret techniques looked puzzled after they heard that.
