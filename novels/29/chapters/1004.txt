Chapter 1005: Unusual Item

Su Ping listened attentively.

“First of all, you need to know the mechanism behind the small worlds, and what is required to build a basic small world.”

The young mentor explained patiently, “To put it simply, when you fully master a law, it can be used to construct the nucleus of your small world, and your other laws will be the foundation of the small world!

“The power of your small world depends on its foundation. The more laws are melded into it, the more powerful it will be. However, fundamentally speaking, a nucleus is enough to build a small world even without the foundation. It can accommodate extraordinary power of faith.”

“Extraordinary power of faith?” Su Ping knew the power of faith, but was confused by this description. The power of faith had never been considered “extraordinary” in the Federation. Did the young mentor mean a different power, or did he think it was more important?

“Exactly. If you boost the nucleus of the small world with faith power, you’ll be able to harness its power! That’s the most basic small world.”

The young mentor continued, “Most geniuses’ small worlds have been built with the laws they have fully mastered as foundation. Your small world will be as hard as it can be if you fully master the four supreme laws and use them to make the foundation.

“If you fully master all four supreme laws, your small world built upon them will be perfect!

“In fact, you don’t have to try too hard when you condense the first small world. If you do, establishing a second small world will be a lot harder.”

The young mentor glanced at Su Ping and added, “Take me for example. I have three small worlds. The first one is based on many laws, including the four supreme ones.

“The second small world is based on the four supreme laws that I’ve fully mastered. This made my second world harder than the first one. They can enhance each other without swallowing each other.

“If you fully master the four supreme laws in the first small world, you will need to fight greater powers to establish a second small world, so that the two small worlds don’t melt into each other. Once they do, the special enhancement field between them will cease to be.”

Su Ping was stunned. He didn’t have to fully master the four supreme laws in the first small world?

“Sir, if so, won’t it be easier to condense a second small world if I build the first small world in a shabbier way?” asked Su Ping.

The young mentor shook his head and said, “You must have a grasp on the four supreme laws in the first small world. If you can’t, you won’t be able to bear the enhancing power of the second small world.”

Su Ping was then enlightened. He then asked, “Then, what did you use to construct your third small world?”

The young mentor looked at him and said, “I got my third small world by luck. I acquired a special inspiration from the heart of a strange beast, which was as powerful as the four supreme laws. I also mastered it even more deeply. That’s how I condensed a third small world that was even more powerful.”

“An inspiration?”

“Exactly. You may try to perceive the four supreme laws and perfect your first small world first. Then, you can fully master the four supreme laws and establish a second small world. That’s what we all do. All our students can condense two small worlds; however, it’s challenging to create a third one. You need to search for new inspirations!” said the mentor.

Su Ping understood.

So, inspirations were what really mattered!

Did that Ancestral God attain seven small worlds by obtaining many inspirations as powerful as the four supreme laws??Su Ping was dumbfounded. The four supreme laws were well-acknowledged as the greatest of them all; it would be rare to find any other laws as good as them.

“There’s another way to establish a small world.”

The young mentor continued, “That is, finding a special treasure. There are certain items in this world that carry special powers. You can use them as the foundation for small worlds if you can find them. As far as I know, each leaf of the chaos-born Thousand Paths World Tree contains a small world. You can establish a small world if you get one of its leaves.”

“The Thousand Paths World Tree?” Su Ping was stunned.

It was a horrifying thought, for each leaf to contain a small world.

“If so, wouldn’t I be able to condense thousands of small worlds if I found the tree?” Su Ping couldn’t help but ask.

The young mentor shook his head. “Of course not. As I said, your small worlds must be different from each other, to prevent them from fusing. The leaves of that tree are mostly the same; even if you get a hundred of them, only one will work for you.”

He shook his head with a weird expression as he added, “Why am I telling you this? Not even Ancestral Gods have been able to find such treasures; I was only making an example. There are many other items with special effects, but you’ll need luck to obtain them.

“Unfortunately, you are a human being. You could rely on your clan’s help to establish a third small world, especially if it were a high-ranked clan.” He glanced at Su Ping and shook his head.

Humans were just a vassal species in the Archean Divinity. There were indeed human experts beyond the realm, but none of them dared to break into the Archean Divinity.

Gods gave humans a place for survival because of those experts.

“So to speak, do high-ranked clans have such treasures?” Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He remembered the prince who challenged him, and suddenly envied him. Being a prince, the guy was definitely important in his family; it would also be really simple to form three small worlds, since he had grasped the four supreme laws.

He would be able to have more small worlds if he had other opportunities, or if he was talented.

That’s the capital of a major clan. I can’t compare to them.?Su Ping heaved a sigh and focused on his own cultivation.

He had almost finished mastering the four supreme laws. He intended to use the Fruit of Epiphany for the law of destruction. As for the law of vitality, he decided to wait for the seventh Astral Painting to form.

Those laws have been melted into the first small world. It seems that I’ll have to look for unusual items to establish a second small world, or to grasp an even rarer law.?Su Ping gradually made up a plan. For him, the trip was totally worth it; at least, he was no longer blind.

The task was challenging, but now he knew how to accomplish it.

“Thank you for your enlightenment, sir,” Su Ping thanked the young mentor sincerely. The latter had been patiently teaching him, without any sense of discrimination.

“That’s all right. It’s quite unusual for such a genius as yourself to emerge among humans; not many gods are able to condense a small world while in the Celestial God State. Keep it up; maybe the rise of humanity will depend on you,” said the young mentor with a smile.

Su Ping smiled. He knew that the young mentor was only making fun of him, but he was willing to step up to the plate, even though he wasn’t strong enough yet.

He bid his mentor goodbye and returned to his temple, as he waited for the duel.

Soon after, the beautiful servant returned. She seemed to be delighted as she greeted Su Ping. “Mr. Su Ping, the prince who challenged you to a duel was taken to the Board of Inspection. The duel has to be postponed.”

“Huh?”

Su Ping was surprised by the turn of events. “Did something happen to him?”

“I asked around. An accident happened to a princess of the Rain Clan. All the clan is furious; the Board of Inspection is investigating the matter,” said the servant with a smile.

While stunned for a moment, Su Ping remembered that four nobles of the Rain Clan had gone to the institute, and only one of them passed the test. He asked, “What happened to the princess? Which one was she?”

The servant looked around and said in a low voice, “The princess died. I heard that something went wrong during her cultivation. It’s the princess of the Rain Clan who went to the Fighting Heavens Academy.”

“The Fighting Heavens Academy…”

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. Was she the only princess who qualified? He had heard that the competition among the young scions was cruel, but he didn’t know that they could kill a princess while inside the Heaven Path Institute!

No wonder the other nobles are being investigated; they benefited from the princess’ death. However, were they not worried that the Ancestral God in their clan would find something out? That is, unless their supporters did something…?Su Ping realized that those major clans weren’t in harmonious terms.

However, it had nothing to do with him, so he simply shook his head and stopped thinking about it, as he had already accomplished his goal. He said goodbye to the servant and told her that he would enter seclusion again. Then, he killed himself when nobody was around.

Once he left using a random resurrection, Su Ping wandered the realm with his pets.

The Archean Divinity was undoubtedly vast. However, unlike the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, most places were inhabited by gods or their vassal species; there were cities everywhere. Therefore, Su Ping didn’t find desolate areas suitable for training until after a few consecutive resurrections.

Looks like the Chaotic Realm of the Undead is a better place for cultivation. I can fight monsters anytime I want,?Su Ping thought.

Su Ping left the Archean Divinity and returned to his store a few days later.

Su Ping had spent those days becoming more familiar with the Archean Divinity instead of just fighting. He saw a lot of new things; such knowledge was sometimes more important than strength.

The arrays and skills of the Archean Divinity are truly amazing; they’re much better astral skills. No wonder the gods have been standing above all the other species since ancient times.?Although Su Ping didn’t like gods because of their racial bias, Joanna and the young mentor were a clear example that not all gods were the same.

Su Ping truly admired the gods when it came to cultivation and secret techniques, since they were much more advanced than those of the Federation.

It was already nighttime when Su Ping returned to his store. He simply stood there in the lobby; the store was already closed. It was obvious that a fair amount of customers had been received during the day. Joanna and Green Lady were on the couch, and Tang Ruyan seemed to be fighting in the virtual battlefield.

Neither of the two women showed any response to Su Ping’s sudden arrival; they glanced at him and then minded their own business.

“Kid, why is it that you don’t need to go through the Heavenly Tribulation?”

Su Ping summoned the chaos beast, which had just passed the Enlightenment Phase, but had already grown more than twelve meters tall. He had already examined its level; according to the system’s identification, he realized that his pet had risen to the Void State after only spending a few days in the Archean Divinity!

However, what puzzled him was that the pet’s breakthrough to the Ocean State didn’t cause any Heavenly Tribulation, back in the Archean Divinity. It reached the Ocean State from the ninth rank in the most natural way.

Su Ping didn’t see any Heavenly Tribulation when it reached the Void State, either.

Is it possible that not even the Heavens dare to punish it??The idea popped up in Su Ping’s head. Ever since he learned that the Heavens were conscious, he started to have more thoughts about the Heavenly Tribulation, which wasn’t entirely natural as he originally thought.

“Howl!”

The chaos beast nodded at Su Ping, seemingly proud of its own progress.

Su Ping glanced at it and sent it to the pet room, straight to a nursing pen. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The chaos beast had acknowledged Su Ping as its master after those days exploring. It had also bonded with the Dark Dragon Hound, the Little Skeleton and the other pets.

It has just reached the Void State, and yet it’s already bold enough to attack Star State beasts and break into Star Lords’ small worlds. What a monster.?Su Ping shook his head. He thought that he was talented enough. He had even shocked Celestials when he condensed a small world while still being in the Fate State.

However, he was lacking when compared to that little monster.

A more devastating fact was, the pet had just been hatched a few days prior!

It seems that I have to cultivate harder, or the pet will surpass me very soon.?Su Ping had a feeling of crisis. It would be a major disaster if his pet grew up too fast and broke free from his contract.
