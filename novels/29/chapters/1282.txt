Chapter 1284 Closing of the Crack (1)

Seven days later,

Back in the temple, the flames inside the cauldron placed at the center gradually died out. The dark red patterns on its surface became even more intimidating, carrying the aura of the Great Dao.

Whoosh!

The cauldron turned into a woman, even more attractive than before. She felt delighted as she saw Su Ping who had been waiting. She quickly said, “Thank you for your help, boss!”

“How do you feel?” asked Su Ping.

“Thanks to the treasures that you found for me, boss, all my damages from the past have been repaired. I’m even stronger than before, after recovering the strength of my prime days. I can help you suppress some Deity Kings if you wish!” said the cauldron woman confidently.

“Your goal is to evolve into an emperor-level item. I can suppress a Deity King with one hand. I don’t need you,” said Su Ping.

The cauldron woman stuck out her tongue as she remembered Ye Chen, who had been dismembered by Su Ping; he was indeed too strong to need her help. She said obediently, “Of course, boss.”

“I’ll take you somewhere else later. I hope that you can truly evolve there,” said Su Ping.

“What place?” The cauldron woman was curious. She would enter the emperor level once she evolved, and would surely become stronger than Su Ping. She wondered why Su Ping wasn’t worried about that.

In any case, she could tell that Su Ping was completely unlike Ye Chen. He wasn’t really a skeptical man; rather, she saw him as a man who could be trusted and relied upon. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, Su Ping was definitely not gullible either, as he had tricked her and the worldly emperor-level sutra, having them enter his store and suppressing them with the store’s power.

She saw that Su Ping carried a special quality that was both reassuring and trustworthy. It was probably the real charisma of a leader.

“Archean Divinity.”

The two words uttered by Su Ping hammered the hearts of Shivalello and his companions, who looked at Su Ping and the cauldron woman with envious eyes.

“Well… Brother Su, can we go with you?” Shivalello couldn’t help but ask.

Su Ping glanced at them and said, “As Anna has already told you, you must become my employees and sign contracts with me if you want to go. However, there’s no need to ask again if you’re unwilling to entrust your lives to me.”

The four of them looked at each other in bewilderment, hesitating.

They had cultivated arduously for years on end. They would be downright stupid if they handed their lives over to Su Ping.

Was it worth it, just for a chance to visit their hometown?

Besides, it was unknown whether or not they could actually see it.

Ignoring their hesitation, Su Ping said, “Although I can’t take you there directly, don’t worry. I’ll contact the supreme experts of the Archean Divinity once I get there. You’ll be able to return soon if any of them are willing to help.”

Their eyes lit up. While holding back his excitement, Shivalello said solemnly, “Thank you very much, Brother Su. We’re eternally in your debt!”

“I’m just returning the favor; no need to thank me,” said Su Ping.

He bade them farewell, then returned to his store with the cauldron woman and the sutra old man.

It had only been half a day since he left the store, but it was already closed. Green Lady, Tang Ruyan and the others were all there. Although Tang Ruyan had never signed a contract and could go out freely, she had grown accustomed to staying inside the store.

“Boss, your parents are here, and your sister too; they are all in the building next to the store,” said Tang Ruyan in a hurry after seeing Su Ping return.

Feeling relieved by the news, Su Ping extended his senses and soon saw his parents and Su Lingyue in the building next to his store.

It had been a long time since he last saw them, but his parents didn’t look too old. As a matter of fact, no more than ten years had passed since he entered the Interstellar Federation. Although his parents weren’t battle pet warriors, they had spiritual fruits as nourishment; it was easy for them to live 10,000 years.

Su Ping noticed that Su Lingyue had already reached the Star State. Her vitality aura was more than fifty years old. It was clear that she had been cultivating in a place with accelerated time.

She was definitely a genius, to have reached the Star State at the age of fifty after emerging from a planet as underdeveloped as the Blue Planet.

She has indeed accomplished something.

Su Lingyue gave him a slight nod. Even though the Star State was no different from an ant in his eyes, it was already quite remarkable for ordinary people, such as Su Lingyue.

“Dad, mom.”

Su Ping simply spoke telepathically and projected himself into their heads.

“Ping’er!” A reunion after a long time. His parents were discussing the news when they suddenly heard Su Ping’s voice. They felt dazed by the sudden contact. Stupor gave way to excitement when they saw Su Ping in their heads.

“I don’t have much time right now; let’s catch up later. In case of danger, seek refuge in the store immediately,” said Su Ping.

His parents had heard of his feats and knew he was a celebrity throughout the universe right now. They didn’t know much about celebrities, except that such characters would be subject to swarms of people. They both nodded; tears flowed out of his mother’s eyes, but she quickly wiped them off.

Su Ping heaved a sigh. Although he could easily slay Celestial experts now, he didn’t even have the time to accompany his family. No one could prevent him from accompanying them at that moment, but there was a risk of not handling the catastrophe on time, and not being able to do anything about it.
