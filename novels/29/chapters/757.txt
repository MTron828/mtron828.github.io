Chapter 759: All Class A

Cleo couldn’t hold her temper any longer and said to Su Ping coldly, “Boss, I’m a customer as much as everybody else. Why can’t you sell them to me?”

She had already revealed her identity as a member of the Ryan family.

The Ryan family were like gods on that planet!

There were many other families, organizations and forces, but they all had to respect them!

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and said indifferently, “Like you said, you’re a customer as much as everybody else. Why must I sell it to you, and why can’t you follow the rules like everybody else?”

He slightly modified Cleo’s words and threw them back at her.

Enraged, Cleo said, “There are so many people in your shop. Will there still be any pets left when my turn arrives?”

“If there aren’t any, you can come early next time,” said Su Ping.

Cleo stomped in fury and demanded, “Are you saying I should just stand outside your shop every day? Rules are just words. If a Star State warrior were here, would you ask them to follow your rules too?”

She thought Su Ping was simply going against her.

There were no rules in that world when it came to real experts!

If the leader of the Ryan family, or any other Star State experts, were to show up, he would definitely invite them in!

If a Star Lord were there, he would probably even offer pets for free!

Su Ping became indifferent, “Even if gods were here, they would have to wait in line if they want to buy a pet from this shop!”

“You!” Cleo was so mad she could hardly breathe.

She and Su Ping had never met before; there was no way she had ever offended him. She was a beautiful woman who belonged to the Ryan family. Why did the guy have to give her a hard time?

Did he hold a grudge against the Ryan family?

As she thought of it, she suddenly wondered if the guy really considered the Ryan family as an enemy.

Her eyes flashed; she suddenly calmed down and then thought of many things.

He had sold three Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons with Class A aptitudes, which already meant a loss of a hundred billion!

If Lily—another member of the Ryan family—weren’t one of the customers, she would have suspected that it was this shop’s marketing strategy.

Wait a minute.

She suddenly became confused when she thought of Lily.

Lily is also from the Ryan family. Why did Su Ping sell her pets so easily?

Is it because Lily’s position in the family was too low and the guy doesn’t know it?

The more she thought about it, the more likely Cleo found it to be. She decided to check the shop’s background in the tax bureau.

She remembered that the shop had existed on that street for years but never caught any attention in the past. Little did she expect that it would cause such a huge tide!

“Please wait in line. Even if the pets are sold out, this shop still offers training services that can strengthen your own pets,” said Su Ping casually.

He wasn’t really hostile towards the woman. It was just business.

Cleo looked at Su Ping in confusion and thought for a moment, before she said, “Okay, I’ll take a look then!”

She then headed to the end of the line, only to find that it had already extended out of the shop.

Cleo was at a loss for words, but she held back and stood at the end of the line obediently. She also sent a message to a member of her family and asked him to help investigate the shop.

...

With Cleo’s competitive bidding gone, the remaining Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were soon sold out.

All the remaining customers looked awful, filled with regret for having run out earlier. They would have had a better chance to get to the front of the line when everybody else had left!

Su Ping had earned more than fifty million energy points once the ten dragons were sold.

He had gathered almost a hundred million energy points!

This would allow him to upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool immediately! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Still, instead of the upgrade, he chose to buy the Thunder Ocean Fruit first.

The Chaos Spirit Pool could be much more effective than before after being upgraded to level 5, with a chance of breeding Star State pets. The Star State actually included the Star State, the Star Lord State and the Ascendant State!

The Star State was the system’s collective name for the three sub levels!

Above the Star State was the Divine State.

Although that was too far away from Su Ping at the moment.

However, he knew that the cost for each breeding session in the Chaos Spirit Pool was a hundred million, which was the same as the cost of upgrading!

He could create Ascendant State pets if he was unbelievably lucky.

However, the odds of that happening were quite low; getting Fate State beasts was more likely.

It wasn’t easy for Su Ping to earn a hundred million presently. He felt that he would become depressed if he were to spend a hundred million on a Fate State beast.

Everything that had happened assured him that he was not a Son of Destiny or favored by the Goddess of Fortune.

If he intended to win against the odds, he had to invest much more than he could afford.

Besides, even if he upgraded the Chaos Spirit Pool, he would run out of money and would remain unable to use the upgraded Chaos Spirit Pool.

The Thunder Ocean Fruit, on the other hand, might be gone for good if it disappeared. He had to seize it!

A young man who finally had his turn asked nervously, “Boss, are there any more Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons?” He had heard that ten dragons had been delivered to the shop the day before, while ten had already been sold. He wasn’t sure if any more of them were still available.

“No.” Su Ping shook his head.

He had already trained the white-scaled drakeling to reach a mid-high aptitude, and the high aptitude wasn’t far off. He wouldn’t sell it easily.

Everybody sighed in frustration after seeing that Su Ping shook his head, even though they had seen it coming.

“Those pets were regular beasts at first. They couldn’t have gotten mid-level aptitudes without the training done in this shop.” Su Ping knew it was an opportunity to promote. “You can consider the training services in this shop. They will be worth every penny!”

“Training services?”

“Can you give them Class A aptitudes with your training?”

“Can you train any kind of pet?”

Many people asked questions.

Su Ping had become quite trustworthy when he talked about training since he had indeed sold three Class A Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons. Many customers thought it was impossible to catch three wild Class A dragons in a row, so there was the chance they might have been trained.

However, some other customers simply observed coldly without feeling tempted.

All of them knew that Su Ping’s dragons had been shipped over the day before. One day was probably enough for assessments, but not nearly enough for them to be trained, unless he was a master trainer!

The trainers in the Federation were divided into five tiers, each with a corresponding number of stars.

There were five levels in each tier, classified by five crystals. The five-starred trainers were the weakest, but they were more respected than Ocean State warriors!

The five-starred trainers were known as the Holy Spirit Trainers on the Blue Planet. They could enlighten pets with talents!

Underneath the five-starred trainers were the nine-crystal trainers. They were also known as apprentice trainers.

The most famous trainer on Rhea was a four-starred trainer. He dedicated his services to the Ryan family and had special privileges.

As for the three-starred master trainers, even the leader of the Ryan family would have to treat them respectfully.

Two-starred trainers were extraordinary trainers that the leader of the Ryan family wasn’t even qualified to meet.

One-starred trainers, who were at the top of the tiers, were also known as the godly trainers. They were the most admired in the Federation; even Ascendant State warriors would have to treat them respectfully.

To train regular Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons until they had Class A aptitude overnight was something that even the four-starred master trainer working for the Ryans couldn’t do!

“This shop offers two kinds of training services.

“The first kind is the normal training. Your pet will grasp at least one new skill, or slightly increase its combat ability with each training session.

“The second kind is professional training, which will significantly increase your pets’ aptitude, but it takes longer and costs more,” said Su Ping.

“Seriously? Pets would grasp a new skill after each training session? Do minor skills count?” someone couldn’t help but ask.

Su Ping said, “The skills they perceive will be at least of their own level.”

“Are you serious? If a pet is at the Fate State, will it grasp a Fate State skill?”

“That is correct.”

Su Ping nodded.

Everybody looked at each other in bewilderment and shock.

That sounded too unbelievable!

The young man at the front who failed to buy a dragon gritted his teeth and made a decision. “Boss, I want to train my pet.”

He then asked, “I intend to have an Ocean State Star Flower Dragon trained. Is it possible? What’s the price?”

“Yes,” said Su Ping, “Normal training costs a hundred million, while professional training goes for ten billion!”

To enable a king-level professional training required a high-aptitude Beast King to be trained; Su Ping’s Dark Dragon Hound was exactly a high-aptitude pet at the peak of the Ocean State.

“That expensive?”

Everybody was shocked for a moment, but then they were back to normal.

The price was slightly higher than the cost to hire a regular five-starred trainer, but much lower than that of a four-starred trainer.

After all, it required tens of billions to hire a four-starred trainer to develop a pet!

If the trainer had four stars and five crystals, it would mean that he was only second to the three-starred master trainers; his services would cost a hundred billion!

However, three-starred master trainers mostly catered to Star State pets. While a hundred billion was slightly expensive for Star State experts, it was still affordable.

“Boss, is the trainer in your shop five-starred or four-starred?” asked someone curiously.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He had just moved to a place more in touch with all the Federation and wasn’t familiar with many things. He said, “That’s a secret.”

“Boss, just tell us. Your shop will definitely hit the headlines if you have a four-starred trainer!” someone encouraged him.

Su Ping said casually, “I’m not interested in that. The training will be effective; if you’ve tried it and found it unsatisfactory, you don’t have to come again.”

Everybody was slightly confused and awed by Su Ping’s statement.

He’s that confident?

Exclamations were heard coming from the street.

“Oh my god, another Class A Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon!”

“What happened today? Why are there so many Class A Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons showing up in a row?”

“Did something happen to the Rumbling Thunder Continent? So many Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons with Class A aptitude have emerged out of nowhere!”

The exclamations would have been inaudible to ordinary people, but they came from the assessment shop which wasn’t soundproof to the ears of the battle pet warriors in Su Ping’s shop.

Everybody was shocked at the moment.

They looked at Su Ping with awe and fear.

Did all the battle pets sold in Su Ping’s shop have Class A aptitude?

Cleo—who was standing at the end of the line—changed her expression and hurriedly asked the employees in her shop about the situation.

Soon, her employees replied.

They confirmed that the person who had a pet assessed was a customer from Su Ping’s shop.

Cleo couldn’t have looked more awful after reading the message. She had not made up her mind in time to buy out all the remaining pets, even though she had intended to.

She currently felt she had missed a fortune.

“Another one with Class A aptitude!”

“So does this one!”

“Oh my god, it’s the sixth one!”

Exclamations were bursting out consecutively.

All the people present in Su Ping’s shop were stunned. Those who had previously been at the front of the line but later given up their spots were on the verge of a meltdown when they heard the exclamations.

They could have bought one of those dragons if they hadn’t left to snoop around at the assessment shop!

Many of them lost their cool, wanting to slap their own faces.

“So does this one...”

“A Fate State pet with a Class A aptitude! Oh my god, it’s already the second one!”

“The ninth one is the same! Please hit me! Am I dreaming?”

Exclamations were heard nonstop.

The customers who had bought pets from Su Ping’s shop went to the nearest assessment shop to check their aptitudes, which was already teeming with people.

Su Ping’s shop, however, was dead silent.

None saw it coming; their speculation actually came to pass.

Ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons had been sold in Su Ping’s shop, and nine had already been checked to have an A Class. So, all of them had to be Class A!

Soon, exclamations echoed again.

“The tenth one is also A Class!”

“I—I can’t freaking believe this...”

The customers inside Su Ping’s shop, however, were already too numb to hear anything.

Su Ping heard the noises too and raised his eyebrows. He didn’t expect that a mid-level aptitude according to the system would actually equate to a Class A in the Federation.

He didn’t know if Class A was the highest quality.

Su Ping decided that he had to find out more about the aptitude ratings in the Federation through his Lord Badge.

“What about it? Do you want to train your pet?” Su Ping asked, breaking the silence in the shop.

Wow!

Everybody was woken up all of a sudden, as if a bomb had been detonated in the shop. All of them shouted in awe.

“All Class A! Oh my god!”

“Please tell me that my ears are deceiving me!”

“How can I tell you anything if your ears are deceiving you?”
