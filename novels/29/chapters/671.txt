Chapter 672 Fury

Gu Siping didn’t say a thing.

He looked at Fei Tianyi in disappointment. He had thought of every scenario, but he never considered that one of those kids would talk about that person. If he could choose, he would have ignored Fei Tianyi who had just created a huge trouble for him!

Fei Tianyi looked at Gu Siping. He smiled and lowered his head, putting on an expression that said, ‘Sir, you don’t have to thank me. This is what I should do.’

Gu Siping was not in the mood to get mad at the young man. “We’ve tried to contact that person but failed,” Gu Siping said to the middle-aged teacher.

“You failed? Do you know that man’s address?” The middle-aged teacher raised his eyebrows.

Gu Siping looked at Fei Tianyi, afraid that he would offer “an astonishing remark” again.

Gu Siping suddenly realized that the person had visited the Valiant Academy but he and Fei Tianyi shouldn’t have been on good terms since Su Ping had broken Fei Tianyi’s record.

Fei Tianyi should hate Su Ping.

Why would he bring up Su Ping’s name? He’s grooming his enemy! “I know his address. I’ll send someone to fetch him,” Gu Siping said.

“Sure.”

The middle-aged teacher nodded and looked at the time. “But hurry. I don’t have time.”

Gu Siping nodded. He found a legendary battle pet warrior and told him what to do. “Go and look for Su Ping’s address. HURRY UP.”

When he said “hurry up,” Gu Siping gave the legendary battle pet warrior a meaningful glance. The legendary battle pet warrior understood that glance and nodded.

After the legendary battle pet warrior left, Gu Siping turned around and said to the middle-aged teacher, “Mr. Fang, please wait. He’ll be here soon.”

“Okay.”

Yuan Linglu bit her lips while standing in front of the cabin door.

Will I see him in a moment?

Would she have to go to the Hugh Mia Academy with him and study with him?

She remembered the videos she had seen. He had killed a Fate State beast king of and saved a base city. What a hero.

If they had to study in the same academy, she believed she would be defeated by him again.

She hated to admit that but reason told her it was bound to happen...

“Mr. Gu, the wine...”

The bearded middle-aged man stuck his head out of the door and grinned at Gu Siping.

Gu Siping: “...”

Longjiang Base City.

Pixie Pet Store.

Su Ping and Joanna were in the pet room. Su Ping was sitting in the nursing pen, cultivating while Joanna told him about the Heaven Lock.

She broke down the structure, type, construction, and other formation details.

Due to the time limit, Joanna was unable to offer an extensive review of all formations. She had to focus on the Heaven Lock.

Even if Su Ping managed to could learn it, he would only know this one formation. He would still be quite ignorant of other formations.

“I see...”

Su Ping nodded but was still confused. He would often ask questions when he got confused; he didn’t feel ashamed to ask.

“Wait. I have to call Xie Jinshui to get some updates.”

Su Ping came back to his senses after sensing the passage of time. Now and then, he would call Xie Jinshui to see how the base city was doing

A lot of base stations in the barren areas had been destroyed. He was no longer able to see the news of other continents. However, the Subcontinent District had three defense lines and each one had more than ten base cities to work on the communication. They could send and receive continental news.

“Xie, it’s me.”

“Mr. Su, no updates from other defense lines. The wild beasts seemed to have stopped. It has been quiet.”

Xie Jinshui went straight to the point. “Is that so? Half a day has passed and nothing?” Su Ping frowned.

He received the same answer several times. The defense lines were safe and there was no sign of wild beasts; it was as if they would have vanished from the Subcontinent District.

That was good news, but Su Ping was unhappy. If anything, he was worried.

Something was wrong.

“Can you call the other continents?” Su Ping asked.

Xie Jinshui said, “I’ve tried. Mr. Su, the Xing-Jing Defense Line has accepted us thanks to your heroic deed of saving the Longjing Base City. We can use their intelligence unit as well. However, we still can’t get information from other continents. Some legendary battle pet warriors have been talking about going to the other continents to have a look but they have not concluded yet. After all, we cannot afford to let legendary battle pet warriors leave their posts for nothing.”

“Tell anyone who wants to go, that they have approval. I’m suddenly feeling uneasy. If the wild beasts went to other continents, those places may have already fallen,” Su Ping said.

Xie Jinshui forced a bitter smile.

He had the same worry. After all, communication with the other continents had been lost and the Subcontinent District had been too quiet to be normal.

“Should we wait for a bit longer? I have discussed this with the Xing-Jing Defense Line. We’re going to have more guards out there, patrolling a larger area. We will be more at ease if they manage to find traces of beasts,” Xie Jinshui said.

At first, he became fearful whenever he saw a beast. At the moment, even the lack of beasts left him on edge.

Su Ping nodded. After the call ended, Su Ping thought for a while and shook his head. Anyway, he couldn’t have gone over to help if the other continents had fallen or were in crisis.

After all, he could not have gone to another continent but came back within a few hours as he did with Longjing Base City.

Even if traveled at full speed, it would have taken him five to six hours to make a round trip to another continent; many things could go wrong at that time.

“Let’s continue,” Su Ping said to Joanna.

Mastering the Heaven Lock as soon as possible would mean solving things earlier. If he was then able to consume the accumulated astral powers, he might have a chance to break through and reach the legendary rank.

As long as he had enough astral powerswhether the Heaven’s Test would come to him or not-he would reach the legendary rank.

“Okay.”

Joanna nodded.

The teaching continued.

Only two hours had passed, when suddenly, Su Ping’s phone rang. Su Ping was losing himself in the lesson when the ring alerted him. He picked it up. The call was from Xie Jinshui.

“Anything?” Su Ping answered at once.

“Mr. Su, a legendary battle pet warrior from the Tower just came to ask for your address. I couldn’t say no to him. I think he is going to see you. Be careful,” Xie Jinshui cautioned Su Ping.

The tension in Su Ping’s mind was gone.

A legendary battle pet warrior from the Tower?

He raised his eyebrows. Why would they come here now?

To make peace and to seek cooperation?

While he pondered over this, Su Ping left the nursing pen and went to the storefront.

He barely reached the store’s entrance when a person arrived. He was not flying any faster than a titled battle pet warrior, but the richness of his astral powers suggested that he was definitely at the Ocean State.

Whoosh!

The rugged-looking legendary warrior landed outside the store. He saw Su Ping and walked up the stairs. “You must be Mr. Su Ping.”

“What do you need me for?”

Su Ping came straight to the point

The middle-aged man wasn’t happy, given that Su Ping was occupying a commanding position by standing higher on the staircase. Since he was a legendary battle pet warrior, he had often held high positions in society. Not even the master of the Tower would boss around the way Su Ping did.

“Here’s the thing. Mr. Su, you were given a cherished chance because of your talents. It has to do with a famous academy in the Interstellar Federation. They like you for your talents and want you to go over for an interview. You will enjoy a blooming future if you can be admitted.”

The middle-aged man hid his unhappiness and smiled brilliantly. Prior to that visit, he had seen confidential information about Su Ping that the Tower had collected.

That young man was a monster.

The master of the Tower implied that he should stall for time. However, what if the teachers from the Hugh Mia Academy wanted to wait for him? What if they liked Su Ping and took him to the academy? If that were the case, getting on Su Ping’s bad side would not be a smart move.

The best way was to please both the master and Su Ping. That was what EQ was all about.

“The Interstellar Federation? A famous academy?”

Su Ping was surprised.

ver wa

He thought the Tower was approaching him to improve their relations, or to talk about cooperating to solve the problems of the Deep Caves. What was this about the Interstellar Federation and the academy? He knew about the Interstellar Federation. The Blue Planet was marginalized.

There were countless powerful warriors on the main planets of the Interstellar Federation...

The fact that an academy from the Interstellar Federation was there to recruit students when the Blue Planet was suffering was a good thing!

“What are the people from the academy like? Is anyone of them at the Fate State?” Su Ping asked at once.

The middle-aged man was surprised by that question. “Mr. Su, you see, the academy is top notch and I heard that the weakest of those people from that academy is at the Fate State. One of them is at the Star Rank. He can travel across the universe without relying on any external help...” “The Star Rank?”

Su Ping’s eyes glowed.

One at the Star Rank? This was like getting charcoal in snowy weather!

What bad luck for the wild beasts!

“Great. We’re going to survive the strike with a person at the Star Rank. What a timely help. Ha, ha...” Su Ping couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He could always stay within his store and survive in case of a full-scale wild beast strike.

However, the population around the world was large. He could save some but he couldn’t save all of them!

Still, things would be different if a Star Rank warrior could help.

Such a powerhouse could go straight to the wild beasts’ lair and turn it upside down!

The middle-aged legendary battle pet warrior was taken aback by the laughter. The main point wasn’t about that person’s rank, but the perfectly good chance offered!

However, Su Ping seemed to have missed the point; he was worried about the global situation.

The legendary battle pet warrior blushed at the thought; he felt ashamed of himself.

If it were him, he would have been so thrilled that he would have forgotten about any crisis.

“Mr. Su, they are here merely to recruit students; they won’t interfere with our business. The wild beasts... We’ll have to deal with them on our own,” the middle-aged man said unveiled frustration.

He was loyal to the master of the Tower, but he was also a citizen of the Blue Planet.

He didn’t have a chance to go to that academy. He had to stay on the Blue Planet and he would live or perish with it.

According to the information he had seen, he knew that this round of strikes came at full force; they had found eight wild beasts at the Fate State!

He wasn’t even sure he could survive the strike.

“What?”

Su Ping’s smile froze on his face. What?

They wouldn’t interfere?

Su Ping stared at the man. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

What the hell is that?!

Anyone at the Star Rank from the Interstellar Federation could have cleared out the wild beasts on the Blue Planet and humans would once again be the owners of the Blue Planet!

But the Interstellar Federation decided not to do so.

Well, they had marginalized that planet and it was okay in the olden days.

But finally, they could have helped in solving the problem!

And yet, that man said that they would not interfere?!

“Do they not know about the beast strike? Do they think we have a solution? Do they not know how many people we have?” Su Ping threw out several questions in a row and pierced the middle-aged man with his eyes.

The middle-aged man was stunned by Su Ping’s fury. He eventually forced a bitter smile. “Our master has mentioned this and he begged them for help, but they said they had their rules...”

“What rules?!”

Su Ping flew into a rage.

Rules could never be more important than lives!

He wasn’t talking about a single man’s life, but billions of lives!

What kind of regulations or rules could be more important than that? He didn’t think any rules would be broken, either. No negative impact would result from offering a bit of help!

Su Ping held down his rage and asked, “They said they wouldn’t interfere, huh? So, can you reach your master on your phone? They are still in your Mysterious Realm, right?”

The middle-aged man saw that something was off in Su Ping’s tone. “Mr. Su, what... what are you thinking about?”

“I am thinking of Bulls****ing!”

Su Ping snarled. “Let’s see if he doesn’t get angry and comes over to kill me if I give him all the Bulls****ing he could hope for! He said he wouldn’t interfere, right? Since he can’t kill beasts, he can’t kill a human, either!”

The middle-aged man widened his eyes.

What?!

That man was at the Star Rank, for crying out loud!

Cursing at a Star Rank warrior?

Also, judging by the look on Su Ping’s face, the man could tell that Su Ping wasn’t joking around.

This young man is indeed a crazy one!

He challenged the dignity of the Tower, and this day he wants to hurl verbal abuse at someone with Star Rank cultivation!

Still, this time... Su Ping was going out of his mind because of the wild beasts, because of the innocent lives around the world...

The middle-aged man suddenly had a hard time looking into Su Ping’s eyes. He wasn’t the heroic sort, while no one else on the Blue Planet was as heroic as Su Ping was!

Even the master of the Tower had to be obsequious with that “Mr. Fang” at the Star Rank.

After a moment of silence, the middle-aged man once again looked at Su Ping and said, “Mr. Su, don’t give in to your impulses. I know that you’re a heroic and generous man; truth be told, I am ashamed by all this. However, that man is at the Star Rank and he’ll kill someone if he gets angry. I think you should go to that academy. Sir, given your talents, I believe that you will soon come back a stronger man and you’ll save the Blue Planet.”

He had added respect in his remarks.

“A crappy academy with a crappy teacher, I won’t go there.” Su Ping pulled a long face. “Can’t you contact your master? Give me your phone. Let’s find out if that man can break his own rules!”

The middle-aged man stepped backward and said with complicated emotions, “Mr. Su, don’t give me such a hard time. I don’t have a phone, and I wouldn’t let you do that. I think you should go to that academy, for the sake of our Blue Planet. Even if you refuse in the end, I still don’t want to see you do such a suicidal thing...”

He didn’t like Su Ping at first. After all, Su Ping had shamed all the legendary battle pet warriors of the Tower.

However, at the moment, the middle-aged man felt so ashamed that he had dragged his feet on his way over.

“Suicidal? Huh, let’s see about that. I will let you see how he’s going to die if he dares to come after me!” Su Ping sneered.

The middle-aged man forced a bitter smile.

Su Ping was indeed arrogant, and lunatic to boot!
