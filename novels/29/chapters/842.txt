Chapter 843: Visit

“An academy?”

Su Ping was stunned for a moment. He asked, “One of the four best academies?”

“Yes. Only they would have such privileges; other academies are left out,” said Xingyue Shen’er with glittering eyes. “You won’t have to worry about the contest now that I’ve confirmed that you’re in the Void State. I’ll cover up for you, that’s what your older sister should do!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Older sister?”

Su Ping noticed the weird little title, mainly because the girl had left too deep an impression on him. If she called herself his older sister, wouldn’t he be even more childish than her?

“May I know how old you are?” asked Su Ping curiously, not showing any disrespect.

Age was only one factor; she was a Star Lord anyway, and deserved respect.

“Huh?”

Xingyue Shen’er instantly realized what was on his mind. She almost laughed due to rage. She was trying to get closer to him, yet she seemed to be despised?

“Do you not know it’s rude to ask a girl her age?” she said with a rigid face, “In any case, I’m your older sister, even if I’m eight hundred years older than you. Just call me older sister until you’re stronger than me. Got that?”

She raised her head proudly.

“Okay, sure.”

Su Ping was helpless, and could only accept it.

He suddenly remembered that the girl mentioned she had become a Star Lord in her eighties back in the divine residence. In any case, she had to be older than eighty, almost his grandma’s age.

However, that young grandma seemed too childish for his taste.

All the members of the Alliance of Stars had weird looks. Although their leader would normally act like a little girl, she was undoubtedly a strong Star Lord and would never address herself in such an intimate way. Alas, such intimacy was scorned by Su Ping, but a genius such as him deserved to talk to a Star Lord on equal terms.

Everybody admired him. They were also jealous, as it was almost certain that Su Ping would become a Star Lord in the future.

He was already capable of fighting enemies at the peak of the Star State when he was only in the Void State. Nobody could possibly become a Star Lord if he couldn’t.

The more they thought about it, the more helpless they became. Why was the gap between them and him so wide?

They were almost feeling too ashamed to talk to him?

“When are you planning to go?” Xingyue Shen’er was delighted and happy when Su Ping accepted their new form of address. She didn’t mind getting closer to Su Ping, not only because she owed him favors but also because he had great potential.

Even though she would soar with the old man’s help, Su Ping still had a chance to rise in parallel with her in the future.

It meant that they wouldn’t drift apart because of the strength gap, and they could be good friends!

It was definitely a lucky thing to have a good friend in a life of hundreds of thousands of years!

“Let’s wait until my training is done,” said Su Ping, “or is there not enough time?”

“There is. And you can also train in my spaceship. I have a level-1 astral power room that is perfect for training; we can travel to the academy while you train.”

Su Ping nodded and looked down at the blue sea with affection. He said, “I’ve just returned home, so I want to visit my old friends. If you have nothing to do, feel free to come with me or just wander around. This is a beautiful place.”

“Sure.”

“I’m coming with Brother Heaven Destroyer.”

“I’ll just take a look around and see the views on the Planet of Origin.”

All the others accepted with smiles.

Xingyue Shen’er looked at the magnificent tree behind them and said, “This tree is rather strange. Those guys must have been attracted to it, right? Have you thought about how to deal with it? If it stays here, someone else will come for it after we leave.”

Su Ping raised his head and hesitated, as the tree was too strange and he didn’t know its effects yet.

However, he could always ask his friends on the Blue Planet; they probably knew how the tree popped up.

“I’ll learn more of the matter first and handle it before we go,” said Su Ping.

Xingyue Shen’er nodded.

...

Next, Su Ping took her and many Star State experts to the Subcontinent District.

Some of the other Star State experts were wandering about and appreciating the sceneries on the Blue Planet.

The battle had already ended. All the people on both planets had seen Xingyue Shen’er and her entourage; they knew that most of these newcomers were Star State experts and the one who had beaten the weirdly-dressed young man had to be a Star Lord!

And yet, the man was standing respectfully next to Xingyue Shen’er, which meant that her identity was even more extraordinary.

Those people seemed to be Su Ping’s friends!

“It’s our lord!”

“Our lord is back!”

“He stands in that crowd like an equal. Tsk, tsk...”

Everybody on Rhea was just as excited as they watched.

The members of the Ryan family were greatly relieved, feeling they had recovered their backbone once they saw O’Neil.

On the mountain in the Rumbling Thunder Continent—

All the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons had complicated expressions.

Once they saw O’Neil, they understood that it wasn’t an opportunity for them to break free from that planet. If they did, the lord of the Ryan family would definitely go after them and drag them back.

“It’s over...”

“Just now, the mutant seemed to have killed Star State humans...”

“How can the mutant be that strong?”

Some of the dragons looked at the long white serpent and the strong Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon that were still impaled to the execution ground.

They had been sentenced to death because they had given birth to a mixed breed, bringing shame to dragons!

However... Was it really a shame?

The Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon with white scales was born from the humble body of that long white serpent, yet it carried unimaginable power!

Was it really an inferior bastard?

“Lin’er...”

The long white serpent and the large dragon looked at each other and mutually saw their delight and tears. They felt comforted after seeing that their child was safe and strong.

They could die without regrets.

At least, they had seen that their child had grown much stronger in the hands of that human being!

“Clan master...”

One of the elder Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons couldn’t help but look at their clan master, which was the only Star State being.

Many dragons turned their way upon hearing that.

The magnificent dragon shivered, as if having just woken up from a dream, then waved its tail as if the attention was uncomfortable. It was an involuntary reaction of awkwardness.

“Shall we proceed with the execution?” asked the elder in a low voice.

Silence.

A long silence.

There was not a sound on the mountaintop. The Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons who demanded to execute the wretched long serpent fell quiet. Although they still despised the creature, they were somewhat scared.

If they really killed them, would the mutant child come back for revenge?

The Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons had been caged like cattle... Should they really continue brutalizing each other?

After several minutes of silence, an old voice sighed and said, “Keep them in prison for now. Postpone the execution.”

Many dragons felt somewhat relaxed after such a command.

The elder was obviously relieved too and quickly got to work.

The long white serpent and the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon on the ground looked at each other, eyes showing delight. They didn’t expect their child to be so intimidating, enough for their lives to be spared!

...

On the Blue Planet—

Longjiang Base City in the Subcontinent District.

Whoosh!

Su Ping, Xingyue Shen’er and the others entered the Longjiang Base City under the spotlight of global media.

Everybody knew it was the place where Su Ping, the Lord of the Blue Planet, had been born!

That reason alone had turned the Longjiang Base City into the economic center of the Blue Planet and the biggest city in the world!

Once they got closer to the Federation, the base city had grown tenfold. Even the former slums had become fancy neighborhoods.

The suburbs had also been modified and developed.

The street where Su Ping had opened his shop in the past had become one of the busiest business streets in the city. It was a globally famous site, because everybody knew that the Lord of the Blue Planet used to do business there.

It wasn’t just a business street, it was a famous AAAAA scenic spot!

“It’s Mr. Su!”

“Boss Su is back...”

Legendary warriors flew with high spirits in the base city.

They were the Legends from the five major families and the Tower.

The Legends in the Tower had once hated Su Ping, but no one harbored ill thoughts after he defeated Nie Huofeng and saved the planet.

Of course, there were exceptions, such as Yuan Tianchen.

He didn’t resume his business activities in Longjiang; for that he chose a different city.

At the moment he could only watch Su Ping fly to Longjiang while the media followed him.

He never expected that the man who once competed with his granddaughter for legacies would reach such heights!

The man had killed Star State opponents easily. Even as he moved in a Federation full of experts, that young man remained daunting and unstoppable!

“Maybe I made a mistake. Lu’er, I wonder if you can keep up with him in that academy...” Yuan Tianchen mumbled with complicated feelings.

He knew that it wouldn’t help even if he were to lower his head and apologize to Su Ping. It was better for him to just avoid the man. That way, Su Ping might just forget such an unimportant person as himself.

...

Su Ping saw Xie Jinshui and Qin Duhuang.

Both of them flew out of their bases and quickly rushed to meet him.

Xie Jinshui had also broken through to the Legendary rank. He was in the Ocean State.

Earlier on, Su Ping had felt that he was talented and capable of becoming a Legend on his own. His judgment didn’t fail him.

In fact, their new dealings with the Federation and the cultivation methods they could get from them had aided many to become Legends, including Qin Shujian from the Qin family.

In addition, Qin Shaotian, the young master of the Qin family, had stayed on the Blue Planet to eventually take over the family’s leadership.

Qin Shaotian was already a Titled warrior at the moment. He tagged along with his father and uncles to meet Su Ping.

He no longer looked like the young man he used to be; he seemed much more mature and self-contained. Life had somehow worn out his edges.

Su Ping saw a lot of familiar faces. He couldn’t help trembling all of a sudden as he saw his father and mother.

Su Yuanshan, his father, was flying from a distant place while carrying his mother with astral power. Both of them were excited.

However, Su Ping didn’t see the girl who used to be his headache, and whom he always missed, next to them.

His heart was slightly heavy.

“Dad, mom.”

Su Ping walked to them and asked, “Where’s my sister?”

His mother laid her hands on Su Ping’s shoulder and hugged him. Then, she took a good look at him and said, “You’ve lost weight...”

His father said with a smile, “Your sister said she wanted to go out so she could catch up with you. She went to another planet... I couldn’t talk her out of it. Besides, young people need to gain more experience. The world is dangerous, but hiding in one place for life is boring.”

Su Ping’s lips twitched, as it wasn’t something a father would normally say.

She’s your dear daughter. Although she doesn’t always deserve it, this is a bit too casual of you!

Considering her sister’s abilities, she would probably have it hard on another planet.

Su Ping heaved a helpless sigh and admitted that there was nothing he could do. Nobody could be an eternal protector. Everyone had their own lives.

It was better to live a spectacular life than to live a long one.

“Mr. Su.”

“Mr. Su.”

Qin Duhuang, the leader of the Ye family and the others moved closer and greeted him respectfully.

Qin Shujian and Qin Shaotian, who stood next to Qin Duhuang, both wore weird expressions. Both had watched Su Ping grow up, but later on they had been left in the dust.

However, they weren’t jealous at all. They simply had a lot of mixed feelings about this.

Some people were just geniuses that you could never catch up with. Competing with them would only bring you pain.

Su Ping was exactly one of those people.

Su Ping felt warm when he saw the familiar faces he had always missed. He nodded and said, “It’s been a while. You’ve been troubled lately.”

“You’re too kind.”

“Good thing that you returned in time, Boss Su.”

“Boss Su, are they all your friends?”

Everybody was courteous and respectful. Liu Tianzong also was among them. He and Su Ping had a history in the past, but it was already resolved when the Lius apologized. He knew that Su Ping wouldn’t pick on them any longer. He simply felt that life was strange.
