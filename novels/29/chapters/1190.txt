Chapter 1191: Commandery Contest

“You’ve finally made the decision to become a Star Lord?” Shen Huang chuckled. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The others all glanced at Su Ping. It was clear that Shen Huang was very fond of that young man; that was why he spoke to him in such a teasing tone.

“It’s only because I had to,” said Su Ping helplessly.

Shen Huang smiled and said, “You must have heard about what happened. I didn’t plan to tell you, but don’t feel pressured even if you found out about it; just cultivate as usual. Take your time; if the sky collapses, I’ll hold it up for you!”

“I understand.” Su Ping nodded.

“The little guy the ancient devil hates so much is indeed peculiar…” A girl’s laughter sounded next to them; her voice was pleasant and somehow distant. She was exactly the Celestial expert of the Void Star Zone.

Su Ping couldn’t help but look at her, lost for words.?Is ‘peculiar’ really the right word to describe me?

“Little guy, I heard that you plan to publicize your unique method for cultivating multiple small worlds. Did you really mean it? What do you want in return? The Red Fire Star Zone wants to learn it first,” said another man. He was none other than the Celestial of the Red Fire Star Zone.

Su Ping said helplessly, “Senior, I have a name. It’s Su Ping.”

Chi Huo was rather surprised. He laughed and said, “You’re indeed bold. Su Ping, is it? I’ll remember it. I look forward to the day you become a Heavenly Lord.”

Many Ascendants from the Red Fire Star Zone that came along with Su Ping were sweating. Even though Chi Huo looked friendly at the moment, he was quite the tyrant in their territory; he would destroy dozens of galaxies for no good reason. Su Ping was truly bold to correct him!

“All right.”

Su Ping nodded and said, “I will publicize the cultivation method you mentioned for free, senior. I want nothing in return; everybody in this universe is free to learn, excluding those who have sided with the ancient devil, of course.”

“For free?”

Not just the three Celestials—also the Ascendants present in the palace were stunned to hear this.

They had originally thought that he would propose harsh requirements; after all, it was an unprecedented technique. Su Ping would be worth complimenting no matter what he asked in return.

But as things turned out, he was claiming that he would publicize it for free!

Does he have any idea how many things he would lose because of that?

Infinite wealth!

Infinite resources!

Shen Huang was dazed for a moment. He soon came back to himself and said telepathically, “Are you serious? Your cultivation technique is unique. You may be able to establish a top organization with that technique, and hire a lot of Ascendants to do your bidding; their juniors and families would also need the cultivation technique…”

“I know,” Su Ping replied.

“Then why do you…”

“Master, as I said, I want the technique to be popularized, so that the overall strength of humankind will be improved; the result won’t be as effective if I only teach it to a limited number of people. Even though I may have the prospect to gain a lot personally, that’s not what I really want,” said Su Ping telepathically.

Shen Huang was stunned on his throne, as if struck by lightning.

He didn’t even dare look Su Ping in the eye for a moment.

“Little… Su Ping, do you mean what you said?” Chi Huo stared at Su Ping solemnly, adding a great amount of pressure which prevented the latter from lying.

Su Ping looked back at him calmly. “Of course.”

Chi Huo gazed at Su Ping in the eye for a long time, before he finally moved his eyes away. He then took a deep breath, then looked at Shen Huang to check his attitude.

He knew that Su Ping meant what he said. However, Su Ping was Shen Huang’s disciple, and it remained unknown whether the latter would accept this decision.

Perhaps Su Ping didn’t know what he was giving up, but Shen Huang was not a kid.

Xu Kong also looked at Shen Huang after gazing at Su Ping for a while; she knew that Shen Huang was probably communicating with Su Ping via telepathy about the subject.

They had already learned of the power of that unparalleled cultivation technique from their disciples.

If Su Ping were to monopolize it, all the top forces in the universe would have to beg for his technique including the Celestial State experts—

After all, their disciples would be left far behind by those who did learn the technique. Those disciples would be weaker as Star Lords, and even more so in the Ascendant State. A few thousand years later, their organizations would be less powerful in comparison.

All the Ascendants in the palace looked at the young man with troubled expressions.

Could a Star Lord be this generous?

They felt ashamed of their own selfishness.

They had been more or less disdainful when it came to this genius who had just become famous. But all of them admired him; even those who had previously thought he was being pretentious changed their attitude.

Lying in front of the other two Celestials except Shen Huang and teasing them was tantamount to suicide.

In particular, the three star zones had just struck an alliance. The Golden Star Zone would be in a dangerous situation if the other two Celestials were affronted.

“If you insist, you have my permission,” said an unhurried Shen Huang after a long silence. Both Chi Huo and Xu Kong were relieved, and it showed in their expressions. They didn’t expect that even Shen Huang would fail to persuade Su Ping. What he was giving up was worth multiple Heavenly Lords!

Shen Huang then turned around and spoke to the other two Celestials, “However, it’s rather difficult to disseminate the technique to the entire universe; let me help you with that. We’ll start from the Golden Star Zone. Of course, if you two are willing to ally with the Golden Star Zone, we will pick suitable areas in your star zones and also teach the technique there.”

Chi Huo cursed inwardly, thinking that the latter was a sly old fox, but his delight remained. Even though he had to pay some price, early access to the technique would still be a great benefit of their alliance.

“Okay.”

Su Ping nodded. He knew that his master intended to make the best use of the technique. He wanted to disseminate it for free, but the universe was quite chaotic at the moment; it would be a major problem to prevent it from being acquired by Old Monster Ye’s subordinates. Only his master could address the problem.

Fortunately, even though the situation of the universe was changing by the day, the ancestral planet’s position was unchallengeable. The central government of the Federation was still in power.

The dissemination and theft of techniques were bound by federal law, all thanks to the saints. Even though there were underground markets, the law was at least respected on the surface.

“We’ll talk about that later.”

Shen Huang ended the topic. He wouldn’t give away the technique that easily; not until he gained enough. He wouldn’t hinder the technique’s dissemination, but he certainly wouldn’t let its creator suffer any loss either.

“After our discussion, we’ve officially decided that the Golden Star Zone, the Red Fire Star Zone and the Void Star Zone will be an alliance from today onwards. We’ll unite our troops!”

Shen Huang stood up and spoke majestically.

Chi Huo and Xu Kong rose one after the other. They slowly raised their hands, with red and black light appearing in their hands. Their light, along with the yellow light emerging in Shen Huang’s palm, floated in the temple. Very soon, a brilliant three-colored energy was formed, which fluttered in the palace.

“The Void Golden Fire Alliance has been born today. You must follow the rules of the alliance, and never kill each other!” declared Shen Huang.

“You must defend this flag with your life wherever it goes!” announced Chi Huo loudly.

“Our goal is to raise this flag in the nest of the Heavenly Devil Alliance and terminate this evil force of the universe!” Xu Kong’s feminine voice sounded rather high-pitched and inspiring at the moment.

The Heavenly Devil Alliance had been established by the Old Monster Ye along with other Celestials. It was defined by Xu Kong as an evil force; every war needed a justifiable excuse. Obviously, the Void Golden Fire Alliance considered themselves as the representatives of justice.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered while looking at the fluttering three-colored flag; he envisioned infinite blood and fire underneath that symbol.

A storm of blood would begin once the flag was erected.

This was all because Old Monster Ye had been set free.

A single Celestial expert had caused a war in the entire universe…

I would be able to slay him on my own if I were a Celestial, and with this end all the suffering and pain…?Su Ping thought, slowly clenching his fists.

He had seen too many desolate scenes in cultivation sites; most of their lands were ragged and barren, all due to war.

He had been through desperate times on the Blue Planet too. Their world was in crisis; he saw countless broken families. Warriors went to the battlefield and fell one after the other, leaving their families crying.

Su Ping couldn’t bear watching the pain of a single planet, not to mention one that involved the entire universe.

I have to cultivate even faster…?Su Ping thought.

“With the alliance forged today, we will need an army for it!”

The three Celestial State experts sat down. Chi Huo said, “In the spirit of fairness, all the members of this alliance who are capable enough may be promoted as generals! No nepotism is allowed here; your own skill is the only thing that matters. The strongest among you will be the commander of the troops of the three star zones!”

Everyone was shocked after hearing that.

Many unaffiliated Ascendants were so excited that their eyes were filled with tears.

They entered the alliance thinking they could be insignificant generals at best. However, there was a chance for one of them to become the commander!

The commander would only be second to the three Celestials!

Even Heavenly Lords would have to listen to their orders!

The Ascendants were excited at the thought. However, they knew that Heavenly Lords were the most likely to win the position, and normal Ascendants would not really make it.

However, they were still delighted by the whole competition.

The Ascendants who were from major organizations felt conflicted. Some of them were confident in themselves, not thinking it was a big deal. However, the ones aware of their weaknesses felt bitter; they had hoped to rise with their families’ influence and connections. But it was impossible now; they could only try their best.

“We’re mobilizing an army already?” Su Ping was surprised to hear the news. He didn’t expect that an army would be gathered that quickly.?Is the war starting soon?

Shen Huang heard him, then chuckled and said, “Do you want to watch? We’ll pick generals before we pick soldiers. You’re already a top Star Lord, and very close to the Ascendant State. Watching the selection process will benefit you greatly. It’ll be much more rewarding than training in seclusion.”

Su Ping felt dazed for a moment, but didn’t decline the offer.

He was also interested in finding out what the Ascendant State cultivators in the universe were capable of.

“Master, are we going to declare war on Old Monster Ye soon?” asked Su Ping.

Shen Huang paused for a moment, but shook his head. “Not yet. It’ll take hundreds of years to train the recruited soldiers and generals and turn them into an iron army. I don’t think we’ll fight the Heavenly Devil Alliance until a thousand years later…”

“A thousand years…” Su Ping remembered that and made calculations. That would give him enough time to cultivate for 10,000 years in the cultivation sites.

It would be enough time for him to rise to the Celestial State.

“Prepare yourselves for the commandery competition. All Ascendant State cultivators that are part of the Void Golden Fire Alliance are free to participate; you will be ranked according to your capabilities!” Shen Huang said as he addressed all those present, “The contest will begin in the Void God Battlefield in three days.”

Everybody accepted the request with excitement.

The meeting was adjourned.

Su Ping left the palace along with Ji Xueqing and Ye Feng. Ji Xueqing needed to prepare for the contest, so she bid farewell to Su Ping and left in a hurry; Ye Feng escorted Su Ping back to Rhea.

Su Ping asked his senior brother on their way back, “You’re not going to participate in the contest?”

Ye Feng nodded. “Of course, but my responsibility is to protect you; there really is not much preparation that can be done in three days. I’ll just do my best and fight.”

Su Ping nodded. “That’s true.”

“You must come and watch, junior brother; all the Ascendant cultivators of the three star zones will be there. It’s a rare opportunity for you who has reached a bottleneck,” said Ye Feng.

Su Ping nodded. Although he had seen some Ascendants in the cultivation sites—mostly beasts—they were different from the creatures of his own universe anyway.

Once he was back in the store, Su Ping worked along with Joanna and the others. He had consumed a lot of energy recently; he accepted a lot of professional training orders during those three days, and he had to deliver them by himself.

He earned a lot of energy in those three days; it was all in preparation for the next training session.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Su Ping left for the Celestial Court with Ye Feng again.
