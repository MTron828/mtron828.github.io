Chapter 711: A Second Law

Gu Siping became grim after hearing what Ji Yuanfeng said, but decided not to snap back; he wasn’t as good at talking as Su Ping was.

He instantly summoned his battle pets and charged at the Fate State wild beasts.

Ji Yuanfeng and his student followed him, concerned that something might befall the Tower Master.

Su Ping snorted and ignored Gu Siping. He solemnly focused his eyes on the sea dragon and the empress.

The empress would probably make a move if he wanted to kill the sea dragon, otherwise she wouldn’t have appeared when he prepared the previous attack.

“It’s best if you stay put.”

Once the empress noticed Su Ping move closer with his sword, she looked away from the battle in the secondary space to focus on him and frown. “Don’t interrupt my observation. You can’t kill anyone in front of me. I have no time for you right now.”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and paused.

She might sound arrogant, but her statement was true.

Same as him, the empress had grasped some of the basic rules. However, she was at the top of the Fate State, a major level above him!

After using up his power through consecutive battles, he only had enough for one more Void Sword, whereas she could obviously make use of the power of laws multiple times; he wouldn’t be a match for her.

Since she was planning on resting and observing the Star State’s usage of laws, it was a fine time for Su Ping to have a breather. He would rather not infuriate the emperor of the seas.

Humanity would collapse soon if the empress were to join the battlefield. Even if Su Ping was able to challenge her, she only needed to keep him busy and ask the sea dragon to hold Ji Yuanfeng back. That way the other Fate State beast kings would be enough to exterminate Gu Siping and the Deputy Chief.

Not to mention that there were plenty of Void State and Ocean State beast kings, as well as an overwhelming tide of lesser beasts!

Besides, the beast sides in the other directions remained inactive. There was no telling if their Fate State beast kings were on their way over; Su Ping had no time to contact the command center to figure this out.

All in all, it would be a fair deal if both he and the empress didn’t do anything!

“Sure!”

Su Ping accepted the demand and stayed where he was, observing the great battle in the secondary space.

The outcome of that interspecies war eventually depended on Nie Huofeng.

If he won, human beings would win.

If he failed, human beings would be destroyed!

The sea dragon then saw that Su Ping and the empress were watching the battle in the secondary space; it quickly rolled its eyes and slowly crawled to the battlefield nearby.

“I’ll kill you if you dare to join the battle.” An indifferent voice was heard near the sea dragon’s head.

The sea dragon froze for a moment. It looked at Su Ping angrily and roared, “Why don’t you try to kill me? Her Majesty will definitely execute you!”

Su Ping replied with a casual remark, “It’s fine if she attacks me if I attack you. But that way she won’t be able to enjoy the battle.”

The sea dragon’s expression changed in a subtle manner as it looked at the empress, only to discover that she was dedicating her full attention to the fight happening inside the secondary space. It knew how she craved to enter that level, and she was already at the doorstep of a breakthrough. All she needed to do was to open the door!

For the emperor of the seas... The sea dragon withdrew its gaze and glared at Su Ping, no longer moving from that spot.

It didn’t intend to waste that precious opportunity; if the empress understood something and advanced into the Star State, none of the sea beasts would be suppressed anymore. Otherwise, even if they won the war, they would still be dominated by the Lord of the Deep Caves...

On the other hand, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil—which had finally managed to heal itself—rose from the ground and stared at Su Ping with its black head. Still, the beast didn’t dare to make a move.

Su Ping had made two attempts to use his sword earlier, which made it aware that the human was still capable of launching the extraordinary sword technique.

“Stay where you are, or I’ll kill you.” Su Ping directed those words to the Heavenly King’s ears, just like a command.

The latter growled with eyes filled with fury, but the fury was gone when Su Ping turned around and looked back at it. It then decided to ignore him after much deliberation.

If Su Ping were to attack it, it was unlikely that the Ocean Emperor would defend it!

After all, it wasn’t one of the empress’ generals, like the sea dragon!

Also... Everyone was observing the battle; might as well join them. After all, the Ocean Emperor would be to blame later if the Deep Caves’ lord got angry!

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil turned to observe the secondary space. It was already at the peak of the Fate State but never found laws. It was only able to fend off the empress’ attacks with special blood skills, but she was capable of slaying it in a real battle.

So, it had never dared to piss off the empress in years.

If it was able to perceive the power of laws with such an opportunity, it would grow significantly stronger, possibly becoming the best demon king in its level!

A weird scene appeared on the battlefield after the Heavenly King lowered its head; the Heavenly King of Good and Evil and the sea dragon were crouched among the beasts—two giant and strong wild beasts in their own right—while Su Ping and the empress stood still in midair. Intense battles were taking place around them.

It was understandable that the Fate State Beast Kings and the other creatures didn’t attack the empress nor the Heavenly King, but it was mind boggling to see that none tried to attack Su Ping.

It was all due to his deterrent aura!

Everybody was amazed by the scene. Su Ping had awed all the wild beasts on the entire battlefield with his performance!

Su Ping was also watching the battle in the secondary space at the moment, but not as devotedly as the empress was; he was still prepared for possible ambushes.

He had seen too many Star State battles. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

So, he was quite astonished by the one taking place.

It seems that both of them are rather weak.

Has Nie Huofeng mastered a flame-based law? I don’t know which one it is exactly. It seems to be burning, or maybe melting...

The Curse-Winged Beast has mastered a law of swallowing, which seemed to be from the dark path. It had yet to use its spell power yet; it seems to be less reckless than it looks.

The more Su Ping looked, the more solemn he became. Although he wasn’t a real Star State expert yet, he had seen too many of them fighting. While the battle in front of his eyes was so intense that the void was being torn apart and flames were spreading out, he felt that something was off.

It seemed that those two were... immature?

Yes, immature.

Su Ping had seen the battles of Joanna’s Star State subordinates in the Demigod Burial; they were less splendid and had fewer explosions. However, the usage of laws was extremely skilled, like sharp scalpels. The contenders could always attack each other’s vulnerabilities.

The ones fighting at the moment were also making use of the power of laws, but it was more as if they were more bashing each other with hammers. The scene looked awe-inspiring, but was in fact overly unrefined.

It did make sense. The highest level on the Blue Planet is the Star State. Those two have nobody to teach them. The Star State gods by Joanna’s side could ask for her guidance as well as the counsel of other teachers; it was easier for them to be enlightened.

The more Su Ping watched, the harder he shook his head.

However, he concluded that he was even more pitiful when he realized that he had only grasped the basics of an annihilation law, even though he knew a lot of theories.

Su Ping wore a bitter smile as he turned to look at the empress. It was clearly improbable for her to perfect her understanding of laws by watching the battle.

After all, the two fighters were wielding complete laws; they weren’t deducing their laws. Even if they were, it would be hard to see the process clearly, especially when they were fighting with laws as weapons.

Laws are hard to understand...

Su Ping heaved a soft sigh. Aside from perceiving laws independently, the only alternative left was to watch other people’s deductions. Still, it would be hard to understand them with only one or two observations; otherwise, a single Star State expert would be enough to train many more Star State companions.

Su Ping had perceived the law of annihilation during his training in the Golden Crow World, all thanks to his abundant battle experiences.

A person’s daily experiences could be summarized into a deep understanding when an epiphany struck.

It was impossible to construct a tall building in a day!

Even though observing couldn’t help much with his understanding of laws, Su Ping still watched the battle carefully. After all, the battle was too significant. He also found that the rudimentary usage of laws actually made them easier to understand.

The Star State gods in the Demigod Burial used the laws in such a sophisticated way that he couldn’t understand at all.

“Burning... He can even burn space?”

Su Ping saw that the flames released by Nie Huofeng were enshrouding the secondary space. He could feel the heat even outside of it.

The heat was not a physical temperature, but the burning of the mind!

Su Ping then had an epiphany and felt he had a deeper understanding about flames.

His understanding of thunder had been raised to the mid level; he was able to release thunder skills close to the Fate State. However, he was only able to release mediocre fire skills thus far. He felt that he had just grasped something new about heat and burning, which were the fundamentals of the flame laws.

Fundamental elements were closer to the core.

While Su Ping was slightly distracted from the battle, the bones covering him became pointier and covered him as a shield. That was the Little Skeleton’s work. It had sensed Su Ping’s focus and changed from the attached state to semi-attachment.

It would have a chance to resist in Su Ping’s place.

...

“Obey me and be my pet. We can conquer space together!”

Boom!

Back in the secondary space, Nie Huofeng attacked with a scorching fist of flames reaching the Curse-Winged Beast. He had become significantly taller and looked down at the creature.

Roar!!

The Curse-Winged Beast roared and waved its claws to put out the flames on its body. It roared, “In your dreams!”

“Do you have to endure be maimed before you give in?”

Nie Huofeng’s eyes became cold. Flames spread out of his body, and a weird fiery rune emerged from his forehead. Adding his crimson hair, he looked like the God of Fire!

Once he became furious, destructive flames gathered in his palm. They twisted the secondary space around him and were almost tearing it apart!

The flames formed a long spear, one that was shining brilliantly and releasing the powerful aura of laws. It contained a complete set of laws!

“Break!!”

Nie Huofeng quickly threw the spear with light bursting out of his eyes. He then strode after the fiery spear and charged at the Curse-Winged Beast.

From the opponent’s perspective, the Curse-Winged Beast changed its expression upon seeing the brilliant spear. It roared, and the violent demonic aura around him formed a gigantic mouth, right in front of it.

Demon Swallower!

That was a law it had perceived. It had swallowed too many disobedient wild beasts in the Deep Caves over the years.

“It’s useless! Your law is too weak! Burn to ashes!” roared Nie Huofeng while he sprinted.

He had seen that his old opponent’s law was one of the most durable, while his own law had a much greater explosive power and could completely handle the enemy!

The moment of explosiveness was enough to win the battle!

“Blood Spell: Demon Sea!”

Right before colliding, the Curse-Winged Beast suddenly roared and its wings unleashed a horrifying blood aura. Complex runed came out of its wings; they produced a bloody luminance like a scripture.

The pure dark secondary space was suddenly filled by an ocean of blood. Tides were rising in the bloody ocean as the ancient runes were activated.

“What?” Nie Huofeng was dazed by the scene.

The next moment, the bloody ocean had already surrounded the fiery spear, and the dark runes displayed in them were entangling the spear like vipers as they tried to extinguish it.

“Haha, you didn’t see this coming, did you? It’s a bloodline skill of my clan! It was a punishment imposed on us by the ancient demon gods, but it later became our power!”

The Curse-Winged Beast was laughing and roaring crazily as it pushed the giant mouth towards the fiery spear.

“Even so, you still have to die!”

The shock on Nie Huofeng’s face was gone, and rampant flames rose in his burning eyes; the brilliant fiery spear would also produce a dazzling light, and white flames were rising.

The flames quickly got rid of the spell power and tore the bloody ocean apart. Then, it flew out of the roiling tides with an unstoppable momentum!

The Curse-Winged Beast was stunned for a moment and hurriedly resisted by unleashing a demonic aura, hoping to weaken the white flames on the spear, but it was burnt up the moment it approached.

“Die!”

Flames came out of Nie Huofeng’s eyes, making him look like a god. He pushed his hand, and the spear burned even more brilliantly and moved faster!

Boom!!!

The spear stabbed the mouth; the collision of the two laws caused a deafening noise.

Destructive energy surged out, and the beasts near the battlefield were instantly burnt into ashes, leaving no bodies behind.

Whoosh!

The Curse-Winged Beast was flung thousands of meters away. While stepping on the edge of the secondary space, it ended up with blood all over its body and a huge hole on its chest. A white flame was still burning inside the hole!

The Curse-Winged Beast struggled to raise its claws and put out the flame on its chest. Then, it looked at the flame-covered Nie Huofeng with the coldest killing determination in its eyes.

“Not yielding, huh?”

Nie Huofeng looked down at it from the heights.

The Curse-Winged Beast stared back at him, then suddenly grinned and laughed, dropping all the seriousness on its face.

“Nie Huofeng! I’ve waited for a thousand years. Today, I’ll cut you to shreds and eat you from your feet to your guts. You’ll have the chance to watch yourself being eaten by me!” declared the beast while it licked its cheeks, with its tongue secreting a copious amount of mucus.

Nie Huofeng added with cold eyes, “If that’s what you’re dead set on doing, you’d better die!”

He raised his hand and gathered the divine flames all over his body, forming a brilliant spear again.

The Curse-Winged Beast laughed even harder upon seeing that. Then, its laughter came to an abrupt halt, before it said in absolutely calmness, “Do you really think I didn’t know that you wanted me to break the seal? Hehe. I’ve kept the little creature you left to monitor me for a thousand years. Even though you were smart enough not to establish a contract with it, do you really think I was oblivious to it?”

Nie Huofeng was stunned for a moment, then his expression changed.

“What do you think I’ve been doing all these years?” The Curse-Winged Beast looked at Nie Huofeng with a casual gaze. Its violent and twisted aura was gone; it then became calm and composed as if it were someone else.

“That’s right. I’ve been preparing to eat you,” it said calmly, “Do you think I only have one law? Hehe. I’ve already perceived a second law two hundred years ago. It’s not complete yet, but it’s still usable...”

Nie Huofeng’s pupils contracted as he looked at the beast in shock. Was that statement true?

“Speaking of which, I have to thank you, for allowing me to fight in the Deep Caves without a chance to take a rest... You didn’t have such opportunities on the surface, did you?” There was mockery in the Curse-Winged Beast’s eyes.

“Do you think the resulting energy from the collisions in our earlier battle was dispersed? Yes, some of it has dispersed, but the rest of it is here...”

Then, an overwhelming demonic aura surfaced behind it, and then a giant mouth dozens of meters long appeared. It had released a demonic aura multiple times thicker than before.

Nie Huofeng could only gasp at the notion. His eyes were covered in brilliant divine fire while he observed the enemy. He changed his expression, as he did see the hints of a second law behind the Demon Swallower. The law was quite thin and vague. It seemed to be a law of disguise.
