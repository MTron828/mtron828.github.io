Chapter 57: The Explorers’ Warehouse

Fan Ganglie, Fan Xiaoyu, and all the others were dumbfounded.

The dark crack on the ground that extended for seven to eight meters with a width of half a meter startled them all.

None of them, except for Fan Ganglie, would have withstood such a powerful attack!

Was it done by the Little Skeleton?

Was it a low-level skeleton?!

When the group cast their looks on the Little Skeleton again, they soon noticed there was something different about it. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Little Skeleton’s bones were not pale white, but black. There seemed to be some blood-red glow flowing inside its bones, just like blood. Besides, there was a red gem the size of a thumb in the Little Skeleton’s skull. The gem was like the Little Skeleton’s soul and it kept emitting a weird scarlet luster.

“This is...”

Fan Ganglie shifted his attention back to Su Ping. A skeleton that could cut this deep with one slash had to be a middle-rank pet, at the very least!

Moreso, when did skeletons ever learn to use saberplay? Not to mention such a formidable saberplay. It implied that the skeleton had undertaken professional saber training!

Su Ping told the Little Skeleton to sheathe its blade and asked the group, “Is this good enough for you?”

Fan Ganglie’s eyes shone. He was convinced that it was just a sampling of what the skeleton was capable of; its real power was still hidden. That was to say, the skeleton was a pet at the middle-level at the very least.

Although Su Ping was probably not an advanced battle pet warrior as Fan Yujing had speculated, he was already qualified by explorer standards.

“No problem.”

Fan Ganglie stopped his mind from wandering and said to Fan Yujing, “Take him to the registration booth. Afterward, take him to the warehouse to pick a suit of armor. We will leave when you’re ready. There’s no time to lose. I’m afraid that the Blood Fox will be in danger if we waste any more time.”

Fan Yujing nodded and told Su Ping, “Brother Su, come with me.”

Su Ping didn’t send the Little Skeleton back to the pet space. He bent over to take out the Blood Bead from the Little Skeleton’s skull, in case it would fall off and get lost during battles when they entered the space fracture.

He put the Blood Bead into his pocket and said the name of the storage space in his mind to place the Blood Bead there.

Having finished this, Su Ping went after Fan Yujing.

Fan Xiaoyu, who had been on the side, told them to wait for her and hurried over.

Once they were far enough from the one-story house, Fan Xiaoyu threw a curious look at the Little Skeleton who was staggering along behind Su Ping. She asked, “What kind of skeleton is this? It seems to be out of the ordinary.”

“Out of the ordinary?” Su Ping asked, “Do you mean extraordinarily handsome like me?”

Fan Xiaoyu didn’t know how to respond to that. “Forget I asked.”

Then the rest of the trip became quiet.

Minutes later.

They arrived at a magnificent building in the heart of the base. Fan Yujing took the lead and went in. The hall was spacious but few people were there, taking into account it was in the dead of night.

They approached an automatic machine placed by the side of the hall. Fan Yujing asked Su Ping, “Did you bring your ID card? If not, stand there and have your iris scanned. The system will record your information and gain access to the civil affairs bureau. From here on, everything about you will become a secret.”

Of course, Su Ping didn’t bring his ID card with him. He followed Fan Yujing’s instructions and stepped on the footboard in front of the machine. Fan Yujing helped Su Ping to go through the options on the screen: “Explorer Registration-Temporary-Authentication-Iris Authentication,” etc.

A rock-arm camera slowly moved in front of Su Ping.

The red light glowed and Su Ping’s iris was scanned.

At the same time, everything about Su Ping was presented on the screen.

Su Ping

Gender: Male

Age: 18

Education: Blue Dragon Kindergarten, Saint Oriole Elementary School, Saint Oriole Middle School, and Baiwu High School

Family Connections:

Mother: Li Qingru

Sister: Su Lingyue

Father: Su Yuanshan

Mother’s Identity...

Sister’s Identity...

...

Su Ping saw the excruciatingly detailed information of him; so specific that even his hair was introduced. The surprise he felt gradually shifted to terror.

Just with this registration, his background information since he was a kid was collected and even information about his family was recorded in the file!

It meant that the explorers’ identity archive system had a high security clearance and could directly acquire related information from other departments whenever necessary.

When the Fan siblings saw Su Ping’s age, they were stunned speechless. Su Ping was indeed 18 years old. He didn’t lie about his age.

“Registered,” Fan Yujing said. He closed the information sheet and did not take another look.

Su Ping thought it would take longer. “That’s it?”

Fan Yujing smiled. “The registration for temporary explorers is simple and does not need to be approved, as long as you’re invited by a team. I invited you from the team’s intranet so you can register directly.”

Then, Fan Yujing tapped on the screen and inserted a string of passwords. Soon, their team’s web page was pulled up.

On the page were five profile pictures.

Below the five profile pictures was Su Ping’s profile picture.

“From now on, you will be our team’s temporary explorer. You have to be approved at the base if you want to become a full-time member.”

Fan Yujing went on with a smile, “But since you’re a temporary explorer, you won’t receive any allowance at the base and you won’t have an exclusive vehicle assigned. But in other aspects, you will enjoy the same benefits as the other explorers. Anyone that provokes you, as long as they are the initiators, you can just punch them at will. But don’t kill people so casually. After all, you’re not a formal explorer and you would be subject to a small punishment.”

“Just a little punishment?”

Su Ping was taken aback. Once again, he had a sense of the privilege enjoyed by explorers.

That being said, the explorers protected the base. They enjoyed a higher status than the army. It wasn’t rare for explorers to have such rights.

If any regular person could kill someone like an explorer could, it would be bitterly disappointing to explorers. For the higher-ups at the federal government, that would result in a greater loss.

“Of course, strength is the rule. A regular person unknown to fame would not be safe in these turbulent days,” Su Ping said to himself. He couldn’t say that all explorers were good people. If some hot-tempered explorer killed an average Joe, then that average Joe’s family would have no means to fight back.

That was sad for the weak.

Life was never equal in any world!

“Brother Su, although you are a temporary explorer, you have the basic rights of explorers. During every mission, merits will be distributed according to performance. When merits are accumulated to a certain extent, there will be different welfare benefits. Merit points can also be used to purchase various needed items.”

Fan Yujing smiled and went on, “Brother Su, let me take you to the explorers’ warehouse. Brother Su, you can pick anything you need.”

“Oh?” Su Ping’s eyes glowed. This was interesting.

Soon, they arrived at another building. They logged in on a computer and entered the interface of “Warehouse for Benefit Redemption”.

Fan Yujing introduced, “There are armors, weapons, and cultivation methods you may need, such as the four basic augmentation skills. Academies only teach from the first to the fourth ranks. But here, you can find augmentation skills from the first to the ninth rank.”
