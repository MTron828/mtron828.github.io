Chapter 1285 Closing of the Crack (2)

Only when a man reached middle age would he know that spending time with his family and working hard were complete opposites.

“Kiddo, our parents are yours to take care of; try your best to cultivate. Whatever resource you need, just ask Shen Huang, my master. He’ll accept your requests as long as they’re not too outrageous,” said Su Ping telepathically to Su Lingyue, who was cultivating in her pajamas at the moment.

She suddenly opened her eyes, as if waking up from a dream, then looked around but didn’t see his brother. However, the familiar voice still shocked her.

“Where are you?” “I’m in my store.”

“You…”

Su Lingyue recovered from the surprise and bit her lip. “You must be careful. I’ve already asked your master about you… Don’t handle all the dangerous missions on your own. This is the universe, not the Blue Planet we used to live on. Everyone is responsible to act when it comes to a universal disaster. Don’t push yourself too hard!”

“I won’t,” said Su Ping. There were ripples of surprise in his tranquil heart. Su Lingyue seemed to have changed a lot since they last met; she was less arrogant and stubborn, and became more mature and considerate.

She gnashed her teeth upon hearing Su Ping’s calm voice. She had pictured their reunion lots of times, expecting for both to either be thrilled, to be jabbing at each other immediately, or to share a warm hug. Never did she think he would be that calm.

The situation didn’t sadden her, though. She only felt sorry for him instead.

How many things did he go through to become so calm and poised?

Once he was done talking to Su Lingyue, Su Ping extended his senses to another place on the street. There, on the second floor, there was a powerful aura that belonged to Chi Huo.

“Any updates from the Mayhem Star Zone?” Su Ping instantly asked.

“The exploration teams that your master sent out have gathered some intel and live pictures. The crack in the universe has already closed, but there’s still a slight opening; both the ancient corpse and the creature beyond are gone. The entire Mayhem Star Zone was deformed, and laws have been completely rewritten. It’s a forbidden area devoid of life right now!”

Chi Huo added in a hurry, “Right now, there are still several exploration teams working with machinery. Based on their findings, it seems that the ancient corpse entered the crack.”

Taking a long time to overcome his surprise, Su Ping asked, “Does it mean that both the ancient corpse and the creature are outside the crack in the universe right now?”

“That is correct.”

Chi Huo continued, his concern evident, “I wonder if their battle is over. Something big is bound to happen if the foreign creature wins, as it first attempted to break into our universe. It’ll be too strong for anyone in our universe to counter.”

Su Ping became grim. He was aware of that possibility; after all, that was an existence in a realm beyond the Celestial State. Even someone as powerful as himself wasn’t confident of beating such an existence.

I’m not strong enough. I’m still too weak.

Su Ping secretly clenched his fists. He then said to Chi Huo telepathically, “Leave a message with my employees if any urgent information comes in. I’ll be notified the moment I return.”

“All right.” Chi Huo accepted the task.

Su Ping withdrew his senses, and immediately picked another batch of pets for the professional training package. This time he picked the Archean Divinity.

I’m probably still wanted by the Rain Clan. I wonder how long I can fight against a God Emperor with my current power.

He had never fought one of those overlords before. He had indeed met some in the past, but he was never able to understand their power; he couldn’t even understand the nature of their attacks. That was why it was impossible for him to figure out the gap between them.

Whoosh!

The teleportation portal disappeared. Su Ping then saw the dim and vast sky, where dark gold clouds were embedded like scales.

The land was flat and lush with giant trees and grass, where gargantuan beasts were lurking

“This is…”

The sutra old man and the cauldron woman tagged along; they looked around in shock.

The intense divine power and the overwhelming great laws in the air shocked them. It was definitely a whole new world, nothing like the Demigod Burial they visited recently.

“This is the Archean Divinity,” said Su Ping. He took out his Heaven Path Institute badge, only to find that it wasn’t shining; this meant that he wasn’t on the same continent and couldn’t use the badge’s teleportation feature.

“The Archean Divinity…”

Both the old man and the cauldron woman were shocked. Does the world we’ve only heard about in ancient tales still exist?

“Wasn’t the Archean Divinity destroyed?” asked the flabbergasted senior. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Su Ping replied, “It seems to have been reformed at one time.”

The sutra old man was thus enlightened.

Exactly at that moment-Su Ping raised his eyebrows and looked at a certain place in the void.

There, a vortex opened and a shiny golden spear swooshed out like a lightning bolt, shooting out from the deep spaces!

Su Ping quickly moved and dodged the spear. There was a boom—the earth trembled and a pit with a radius of hundreds of kilometers appeared!

Both artifacts changed their expressions upon witnessing such a terrifying strike. They looked into the vortex, only to see a man wearing shiny golden armor and a crown. Su Ping was quick to recognize that he was part of the Rain Clan, by looking at the patterns on the man’s attire.

He narrowed his eyes with overflowing coldness. “It’s been such a long time. It couldn’t have been easy for you to find me, right?”

The divine light was gone, revealing a brawny middle-aged general whose aura, although suppressed, was still intimidating; like an ocean floating in midair. He looked down at Su Ping and waved his hands, locking the area within hundreds of kilometers with golden light, which was a secret Rain Clan technique.

“Brat, you’re bold enough to show your face. I thought you would choose to hide in humanity’s ancestral land until you died of old age!” said the indifferent and emotionless middle-aged man.

“Emperor level!”

The sutra old man narrowed his eyes in shock.

The cauldron woman also noticed the power, surpassing everything; there was shock in her eyes. She seemed to be both scared and thrilled, as if something was boiling in her blood due to the stimulation!

“Why wouldn’t I dare to show up? Because I’m too scared of you?” said Su Ping coldly while sneering, “Why didn’t you send a prince of yours? Aren’t you a high-ranked clan? Your princes must be unparalleled. Bring a few more over; I didn’t have enough fun killing them last time!”

The old man and the cauldron woman’s eyes almost popped out. They finally understood what Su Ping did.

No wonder an emperor-level expert had attacked right from the get go. Su Ping had killed one of their princes! This is bad! the sutra old man cried in his heart. He had been planning to say a few nice words and apologize on Su Ping’s behalf… even though he had done nothing wrong.

But how could they forgive him after killing one of their princes?

“Boss, why don’t we retreat for now?” The cauldron woman was about to faint when she saw how proud and stubborn Su Ping was acting. That’s an emperor-level god. Why is Su Ping being this reckless?

“Humph. Your weapons are shaking in their boots.” The middle-aged fellow didn’t know what the cauldron woman had said to Su Ping, but he could tell that she was originally a high-level weapon. Her actions gave him great satisfaction. It was true that the humans had attached great importance to that genius, even giving him two decent weapons.

“You would be shaking too if I were at your level,” said Su Ping while staring at him coldly.

The proud god chuckled. “I know you’re extremely gifted, but don’t overestimate yourself. Do you think anyone at my level was any less remarkable than you when we were your age? Stupid human, you’re still ignorant while facing death. You will never grow to reach my level!”

The ground trembled as he spoke, and a stream of light flew back to his hand like lightning. It was none other than the golden spear he had hurled in the beginning.

“I was hoping that I could experience a God Emperor’s power; you’ve come at the right time.” Su Ping coldly summoned the young Chaos Beast and merged with it. Meanwhile, he also summoned the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound, who would probably benefit from witnessing their fight.
