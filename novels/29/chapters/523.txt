Chapter 525 Leaving T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

That voice startled the legendary battle pet warriors.

“The Chief!”

“Has the Chief finished his cultivation?”

The legendary battle pet warriors that had joined the Tower ages ago eyed the void around them with astonishment.

The Chief was, without a doubt, the single most powerful man on the Blue Planet. The Chief would stay in closed-door cultivation quite often. It was strange that he would come out this day. Was he disturbed by the noises here?

The legendary battle pet warriors who had joined the Tower in the recent century didn’t recognize the voice at first. The seniors’ exclamation solved their confusion. It never occurred to them that they would see him that day. They had heard so many stories about that mysterious Chief but never met him in person.

“Chief!”

The Deputy Chief, who was still preparing his strike, put away his sword. He turned to face a location in the void. Eventually, he cupped his fists and said, “Master, you have finished cultivating?” “Master?”

Many legendary and titled battle pet warriors alike were surprised by that salutation.

The Chief was the Deputy Chief’s master?!

But the members with the most seniority of the Tower were not as surprised. They were all conscious of how stunning the Chief was and the relationship between the Chief and the Deputy Chief.

Bzzing~!

There were ripples in the air and from the ripples stepped out a middle-aged man wearing a white robe.

The middle-aged man’s eyes were as deep and pure as the stars. He wore his black hair down, like a man from ancient times, standing in the air, bare-foot, and everything about him said he was a refined gentleman.

Su Ping looked at the man. There seemed to be white lotuses blooming around him in the void; that purity could settle the mind and calm down violence.

He felt the anger in his heart had faded away. “Peak of the Fate State?” Su Ping squinted his eyes.

He was of a steady mind since he was still merged with the Little Skeleton and was unafraid of any Space Confinement. He could leave.

“Chief!”

“Chief!”

The legendary battle pet warriors bowed with the utmost respect.

They were all at the legendary rank but they could not compare to the Chief.

The head of the Tower glanced over. He couldn’t help but feel sorry for the destroyed Nightfall Mountain, which brought him to a sigh. His gaze lingered on Su Ping for a moment and realized something strange about him.

“Sir, I can feel your breath of life. You seem to be young. Are you in your twenties?”

The titled and legendary battle pet warriors turned to Su Ping in disbelief.

In his twenties?

Seriously?This young man is not as old as he looked, is he?

Su Ping kept a straight face. “You can sense the breath of life. I think you’re getting the hang of manipulating time. You’re not that far away from the Star Rank, are you?”

The Chief was surprised that Su Ping knew this. “I wonder, which rank are you at?”

The onlookers were completely dumbstruck. Su Ping said that the Chief was reaching the Star Rank, and the Chief had to ask about Su Ping’s rank. Was he clueless?

Is this young man at the same rank as the Chief?

But isn’t he just in his twenties?

How could a person reach the legendary in his twenties?

Su Ping replied with a wordless snort.

Asking about a man’s cultivation rank was as stupid and impolite as asking a girl’s age.

The Deputy Chief scolded Su Ping. “Mind your manners!”

Su Ping looked at him from the corner of his eye. “What’s wrong with my manners? He’s your master, not mine. You should mind your own. You and I are not that close!”

“You!” The Deputy Chief was furious.

Su Ping said nothing else to the Deputy Chief. He was stopped by the Chief when he was preparing his second strike. Su Ping was unable to pretend that didn’t happen. Revenge was out of the question at the moment; he would have to solve the issue sometime in the future.

The Chief lifted his hand to stop the Deputy Chief from uttering another word and cast a warning glance at him.

That glance drove away all the rage on the latter’s face. He had always respected, and even feared, his master. The Chief must have already been there when he got out; he was just hiding in the dark to see how the Deputy Chief would deal with the matter.

And yet, the Deputy Chief failed to notice the Chief.

Were they really so different?

He remembered what Su Ping said early

The Star Rank.

That was a rank that was too far to reach for legendary battle pet warriors. However, the one that could make that breakthrough would be valued even in the Interstellar Federation!

“I’m Ji Yuanfeng. How should I address you?” The Chief was very nice to Su Ping.

Many legendary battle pet warriors were baffled by that friendly attitude. Some that were going to tell Su Ping off had to stop. “My name is just Su Ping, nothing unusual.” Su Ping was able to tell that the Chief didn’t mean him ill but he didn’t let his guard down.

The Deputy Chief was also an esteemed member of the Tower, and yet he broke his promise in public; one’s status had nothing to do with one’s character.

Ji Yuanfeng nodded. “You’ve created a good deal of troubles for us. Do you want to join us or leave?”

“I’m here for the herb. I hear you have the Soul Nurturer. Give me that and I will leave. Thanks for the invitation, but no.”

Ji Yuanfeng wasn’t surprised to hear his refusal. “Go and get the herb for Mr. Su,” he said to the Deputy Chief.

The Deputy Chief couldn’t believe what he had heard.

Nor could the legendary and titled battle pet warriors.

Give Su Ping the herb? Was the Chief not going to hold Su Ping accountable for killing three legendary battle pet warriors and destroying the Nightfall Mountain?

The Chief wished to speak further but stopped on second thought. He was able to notice that Su Ping still held a grudge against him. He would be a menace down the road if he were allowed to leave!

“Master...”

Ji Yuanfeng looked at him. “You promised that you would let him leave if he could withstand one strike. As the Deputy Chief of the Tower, you must deliver your promise.” The Deputy Chief felt embarrassed as if the Chief would have slapped him right on the face. He replied with a yes and left. Since the Deputy Chief didn’t object, no one else voiced opposing ideas.

Su Ping remained silent. He had been prepared to barge into the vault and grab all the treasures and herbs if they weren’t going to give him the herb. He had his storage space, the scroll, and the item that the old dragon king had given him. He could plunder away all he wanted. But that would mean that he would have to pay a heavy price and his life might be endangered.

Also, he wasn’t sure he could succeed while Ji Yuanfeng was present.

He would be more certain if the Deputy Chief were the only strong one to beat, since he was weaker than the Otherworld Heavenly King, a beast kind he had chased away. There was a chance that he could end the Deputy Chief’s life!

A moment later, the Deputy Chief came back.

He threw a black box to Su Ping.

Su Ping took it over and opened it quickly, clearly nervous. There was a half-transparent herb that was giving off a greyish hue. He could even see through the herb.

“Is this the Soul Nurturer?”

Su Ping wasn’t sure because he had never seen it before, but he had a hunch that it was the real thing. There were rich anima and aura of the dead in the herb and the two coexisted in harmony, which was miraculous.

Xie Jinshui and Qin Duhuang flew over. Xie Jinshui looked over and nodded. “Yes, this is the Soul Nurturer.”

Su Ping nodded. What a relief.

He said to Ji Yuanfeng, “I’m a man of black and white. I’ll take this and I owe you one. In the future, if the need arises, you can find me in the Longjiang Base City. Of course, don’t come if it’s too troublesome. You know what to do.”

Ji Yuanfeng smiled. “You’re welcome. This herb doesn’t belong to me, but to one of the legendary battle pet warriors you killed. You owed him one, if you owe anyone anything.”

Su Ping snorted. “I would snatch it from him. I would be okay with that. But you’re giving this to me, so I must say thank you, and I won’t forget your kindness.”

Ji Yuanfeng eyed Su Ping with interest but offered no reply.

“Okay, I’m off.” Su Ping put away the Soul Nurturer and turned away to leave.

Xie Jinshui followed him. He was only there to guide Su Ping; he would never go back to the Tower again.

It never occurred to him that going there to asking for an herb would lead to the death of three legendary battle pet warriors, including Legend Pluto.

That was a massive damage.

Not even the beast strikes at the Longjiang Base City had cost the lives of many legendary battle pet warriors, and still, three perished that day. It was funny how things worked out in life.

However, Xie Jinshui wasn’t judging Su Ping. He would have also vented his anger if he had Su Ping’s might. What the legendary battle pet warriors did was just exasperating. “Mr. Su, wait up.” Qin Duhuang approached him.

Su Ping was baffled. “What do you think you’re doing?”

Qin Duhuang first smiled at Su Ping before he turned on his heels and bowed to Ji Yuanfeng. “Chief, I’m Qin Duhuang and I have just joined the Tower. But now I’ve decided to quit. Of course, you can find me if the Tower needs me for something like guarding the Deep Caves in the future. I will still do what my obligation dictates me to do. I hope you can allow that, Chief.”

“Of course.” Ji Yuanfeng nodded.

It was unexpected to see Ji Fengyuan agreeing so readily; he was more easy-going than he had thought. He bowed to the Chief again and went after Su Ping. “Mr. Su, I’m going to follow your directions now.”

Su Ping looked at him but flew away without saying anything. The legendary battle pet warriors were not happy about letting the man leave, but they had to make way for him.

All the legendary battle pet warriors wore bitter looks as Xie Jinshui, Su Ping and Qin Duhuang left.

An outsider had gone to the Tower to swagger around and was allowed to leave just like that.

The legendary battle pet warriors were still full of indignation but didn’t show it.

Ji Yuanfeng suddenly smiled as he watched Su Ping leave. “What an adorable little guy.”

His smile vanished when Su Ping was no longer in his sight. He looked around. “Is what the young man said true? Beast strikes taking place... What are you still doing here, then? Who can explain?”

They were drenched in a cold sweat.

It implied that the Chief had already been there and he knew everything!

So... he had given his silent consent when Su Ping killed the three legendary battle pet warriors!

What a terrifying realization.

“Our forefather gathered all the powerful battle pet warriors on the Blue Planet when he built the Tower, hoping to be a guard for the whole world,” Ji Yuanfeng said coldly, “The Blue Planet is a primitive planet that has been abandoned by the Federation. If we don’t save ourselves, who will? What? Are you waiting for more spatial cracks or the things to crawl out from the Deep Caves?

“Those people out there are weaker than you but they are our hope, our future!

“Who is to say that there won’t be a second forefather among them?

“The young man who came today is a miracle. Who can say for sure that there’s not another one like him in the base cities that have been destroyed?” Fearing and trembling, no one said a word.

The Deputy Chief’s expressions changed as well. He realized that the Chief was surely using the situation to set things in order at the Tower.

Ji Yuanfeng glanced over the legendary battle pet warriors and all of them lowered their heads.

He shook his head. He knew that talking would not do anything sometimes. Everyone had their own philosophies and talking would not change that. Organization could only come after rules and orders were in place.

“The Otherworld Heavenly King... Longjiang Base City...”

Ji Yuanfeng stared at the cloudless sky, worried.

Suddenly, he realized that he might have forgotten something. The Otherworld Heavenly King was in the Longjiang Base City... So, was the Longjiang Base City safe or not? “I think that young man should be able to keep the base city safe...” he said to himself. “If he couldn’t, then the Skywalker should have solved the problem. “Anway, was I wrong? The young man is in his twenties, at the seventh rank. A strange guy...”
