Chapter 975: The Prince

Bang!

Su Ping’s sword sliced the general’s world in two, causing an even greater opening. However, he was completely exhausted after the attack and was unable to follow through.

This isn’t good enough to kill him. I should be able to execute him from inside his small world if I summon all my power in one go!”

Su Ping’s eyes were filled with killing intent, but his heart was extremely calm. Just like a cold predator, he considered how to better use his strength.

It has to be an instantaneous outburst, more intense than a volcanic eruption!

Fire… Lightning…

Su Ping pondered about laws with explosive outbursts, hoping to find an inspiration to unleash his power even faster.

The general took this chance to mercilessly kill him again, as Su Ping was already exhausted. He was hoping to kill him for good this time.

However, the killing only interrupted Su Ping’s train of thought for a moment. He continued experimenting after his resurrection. While adjusting his bodily structure, he changed the distribution of his cells from a pillar to a python, turning it into a smooth, streamlined shape.

Bang!!

Su Ping slashed forward again. The sword’s scorching aura was even dazzling to the general.

This time, Su Ping unleashed eighty percent of his strength!

A hole hundreds of meters wide was caused on the general’s small world. The sword aura continued unimpeded towards the general’s body. He dodged it in time, but he still broke into a cold sweat.

This human’s sword technique is becoming even more horrifying!

Is he growing?

Su Ping has been killed by the projection of his small world earlier on, while he currently was already able to cut apart the real small world at the moment. His growth was shocking!

Still not enough!

If I unleash all my astral power right where it’s stored, will I be able to release all of it at the same time?

Su Ping tried again but failed; it was equal to a self-explosion. Furthermore, his power blasted all over the place; it wasn’t nearly as concentrated as the previous seventy-percent concentration round.

If only my control of my body were higher. I’m still too weak,?Su Ping thought.

Others would probably think that he was a weirdo if they knew what he was thinking. How could anyone possibly gain control of a self-explosion blast?

Seeing that the human’s strength was increasing, the general came to the awful realization that he had become Su Ping’s sparring partner. He instantly shouted at his companions, “Hurry and summon the others. Someone is causing trouble!”

The other two gods were also shocked and infuriated by such development. They would only be instantly defeated if the general was unable to deal with the human. Neither of them was confident of resisting Su Ping’s horrifying sword technique.?Where is this monstrous human from?

The general held Su Ping back with his small world after the two gods left, and tried his best to deal with the young man.

He would stab Su Ping every time he was resurrected. His small world had been damaged again and again, and he had to repair it with his own energy; he was already tired.

Damn it, why can’t he be killed?

The general was frustrated and angry.

Soon after, dozens of gods flew over. They were all astonished by what they saw, as they could easily tell that their captain was fighting a human being.

“What’s going on here? A human being has dared to come to the mighty Rain Clan?”

“Is that human being fighting our captain? Are my eyes deceiving me? I didn’t drink yesterday!”

“??”

While all of them were shocked by the sight, the general roared, “Set the formation!”

Everyone finally took action. They quickly established a gigantic formation, which emitted a horrifying and pure divine power. The general then flashed to the center of the formation; all the divine power he had consumed was replenished.

While emanating a dazzling golden brilliance, he waved his spear and roared, “Kill them!”

Boom!!

The illusion of the general appeared in the sky; the thousands of meters tall figure slashed down with the spear.

The pressure of the spear alone had made Su Ping’s pores collapse, making him bleed hard. Even so, he didn’t step back, at all. Instead, his eyes were filled with determination.

Bang!!

Su Ping rose to the sky and collided with the spear; he was completely obliterated in an instant.

Tang Ruyan and Joanna also fell with such an attack. Joanna didn’t even try to resist, simply watching how the spear destroyed her.

Tang Ruyan had indeed raised her hands to resist, but she was too weak; resistance was futile.

Whoosh!

Su Ping revived yet again; he also resurrected Joanna and Tang Ruyan. He then stared at Joanna who was still stunned, and yelled, “Why aren’t you fighting? What are you scared of?”

Joanna shivered and turned her head. She looked at him with desperation in her eyes.

“You’re not yourself anymore!” Su Ping roared.

Joanna bit her lips but still didn’t offer a reply.

Su Ping’s resurrections shocked the gods who had just arrived.?Our formation is cutting time and space apart, yet these invaders can still be resurrected?

“Damn it!”

The general’s exasperation grew. He thought that the formation’s ultimate power would be enough to completely kill Su Ping, but the guy’s resurrection method was too advanced.

His actions were solemn at the moment. This time, he was planning on suppressing and capturing Su Ping, to later hand him over to the bigshots of his clan.?Such a weird human is worth studying.

Su Ping looked at the general’s small world confining him. This time, it was as suffocating as a deep sea thanks to the formation’s enhancement. He found it hard to move, and then saw the general’s intent in his eyes.

Su Ping thought of retreating.?Should I kill myself and resurrect in a random place?

However, he dropped the idea when he looked at the utterly desperate Joanna, and the gods in the formation, who were surprised yet disdainful.

“Anna,” said Su Ping.

While being slightly stunned, Joanna looked at him.

“Look at the high-ranked gods that you revere.”

Su Ping said slowly and calmly, “Their level is higher than ours, yet they cannot defeat us without a formation. Do you think they’d be a match for us if we were at their level?”

Joanna felt frustrated upon realizing Su Ping’s intention; those gods were indeed weaker than him in the Star State.

However, she wasn’t scared of those people, but the Ancestral Gods backing the Rain Clan!

Ancestral Gods were the strongest beings in the world. They were worshiped by all as true gods!

“You can also become a high-ranked god as long as you want to,” said Su Ping again.

Joanna smiled bitterly. Su Ping didn’t seem to understand the horror of the high-ranked gods. All gods wanted to be like them, but how many had succeeded?

Boom!

The general’s small world pressed closer, soon wreathing the three invaders. The laws of time and space were strengthened inside the small world to imprison them.

The general was somehow relieved after they were caught. He immediately said, “Send them to the dungeon with me!”

All the other gods nodded. One of them asked curiously, “Captain, who are they? A god came to cause trouble with two human slaves? Why can’t they be killed?”

“Indeed. The three of them are pathetically weak, and yet we still can’t finish them off without the formation. It’s definitely weird!”

All the gods were discussing.

The general remained cold and silent inside the formation; that was the only way he could keep Su Ping imprisoned. He was worried that Su Ping could break free if he merely used his own strength.

Everyone returned to the mountain.

Right when they arrived at the foot of the Rain Clan’s mountain, someone asked in surprise, “What are you doing?”

The general and all the other gods were shocked to see that person. All of them lowered their heads respectfully. The general replied, “Your Highness, we’re escorting outlaws that have trespassed the Rain Clan’s territory.”

“You are?”

It was a young guy wearing a golden robe with frost patterns. His eyes were like stars, clear and sharp. There was a mysterious old person next to him.

“A god and two weak human slaves dared to trespass the Rain Clan’s territory?” asked the young man in surprise, “Even if they have, you could have finished them off alone. Why bother with the huge formation?”

The general replied respectfully, “Your Highness, those three outlaws are very weird. They resurrect again and again no matter how I kill them. So, I had to capture them first.”

The general didn’t want to explain why he had to capture them with a formation. After all, it was rather humiliating for the leader of all guards to be unable to suppress a human slave, whose level was in fact much lower.

“They can’t be killed?”

The young man was obviously intrigued, but the old man next to him remained peaceful, unsurprised by what the general said.

“Is their expertise in time and space better than yours?” asked the young man curiously.

He could tell that the invading trio was weak, one of the girls being shockingly so. The only reason behind their constant resurrections was that their time and space attainments were better than the guards’.

Still, that conjecture was rather unbelievable.

After all, guards were considered elites in the Rain Clan. The invader’s lower realms but better control of time and space was an indication of abundant talent!

“I don’t think it’s about time and space…” The general ventured to answer.

The young man raised his eyebrows. While he saw that the general was probably still confused, he said, “Release them. Let me check this out.”

The general hesitated for a moment, but then nodded respectfully. The prince could easily suppress the invaders, even if they couldn’t be killed.

Once the general’s small world suppression was canceled, Su Ping and the others were immediately set free from a frozen state, physically and mentally. Su Ping looked around as he found that they were in a different place; he knew they had been imprisoned, but he didn’t know what happened afterwards.

Right before he managed to get his bearings and see the environment clearly, he heard a curious yet casual voice. “Rot in hell!”

The young man had already attacked.

The invaders were just three ants to him. He was curious about them, but he didn’t regard them as regular beings.

Bang!

A magnificent power rushed at Su Ping, even greater than what the general had been able to muster. Su Ping was planning on resisting, but then he found that his power was being restricted by a special field. Then, his body exploded.

His consciousness died out too.

But the next moment, Su Ping chose to resurrect on the spot. He looked at the young man with anger.

“Huh? You really can resurrect?” The young man was astonished, as if having just seen an interesting toy.

Brutality was radiating from Su Ping’s eyes.

The old man nearby opened his eyes and glanced at Su Ping, as if sensing Su Ping’s killing intent. The latter then felt as if a sharp nail were plunged into his forehead. His soul was torn apart, and his consciousness died out again.

Revive!

Su Ping was again amongst the living.

“Huh?” The young man was astonished. “I’ve already locked the surrounding time and space. How did you resurrect?”

He could not help but observe Su Ping carefully; such a weird way to resurrect was beyond him.

He was a knowledgeable prince. Very few things could surprise him.

“Are all the high-ranked gods capable of nothing except bullying the weak?!” Su Ping roared the moment he resurrected.

Dazed by this, the young man put on a smile and said, “Interesting. I’ll give you a chance to confess the secret of your resurrection. Then, you may serve under me.”

Su Ping gazed at him calmly, until the smile on his face was gone. Then he said, “I’ve seen the arrogance of the gods. What a shame. I’d love to see what the arrogance on your face would turn into when I stepped on it if we were on the same level.”

The young man’s expression turned grim, but he quickly composed himself, as if finding it unnecessary to feel angry because of an ant. He said casually, “You seem confident of yourself. If so, I’ll give you a chance.”

He raised a finger and said, “I’ll lower my strength to your level, and will only use one finger. I’ll forgive your disrespect if you win!”

The general’s expression had a sudden change once he heard that.

Before Su Ping could reply, he said, “Your Highness!”

The young man slowly turned his head to look at him with eyes devoid of emotion.

“T-This human is rather weird…” The general didn’t know what else to say; he had seen Su Ping’s abilities. The prince was indeed an unparalleled genius in the Realm of Gods, but that human was simply too unusual.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
