Chapter 441 Master Trainer Medal

“Sure.”

Su Ping nodded.

If they couldn’t find his name, he would question what the Trainers Association was up to.

Shi Haochi’s decision had surprised the guard, including those standing in the line, that Brother Lin and Yue Yingying. None could have foreseen that the master trainer would take Su Ping inside.

This was not a joke, okay?

No master trainer could be that young!

The solemn look on Shi Haochi’s face gave people the answer they were seeking. They began to feel sorry for the young man; he had angered the master trainer because of his ignorance. Later, if his name was not found, the young man would be unable to find excuses. He could kneel and apologize but nothing would work. What a frivolous young man...

Some of the older onlookers shook their heads and heaved a sigh.

The already angry Brother Lin was gloating over Su Ping’s impending doom. Why don’t you show off a bit more? You’ll see what happens after offending a master trainer!

“Sir?”

The young man and the young lady could not believe that their teacher would get involved with a man like this. It was an action beneath his status. He should have straight off told the young man to leave.

“You two go back and get your study materials ready. You, come with me.” Shi Haochi did not explain anything to his favorite students. He told them to get ready once again and left.

Su Ping calmly went after Shi Haochi.

Lin Feng sneered after seeing that Su Ping didn’t turn a hair. Hmm, still pretending. He comes and tries to fool a master trainer. Nothing and no one will help him once his name is added to the blacklist and is banned from the Trainers Association forever!

He deserves it. Ignorance is a sin. He cannot think that everyone will spoil him. “I didn’t know we would see such a lunatic here. I thought that those wackos merely existed in the news, not in reality.”

“You’re wrong. There are more freaks in reality than in the news!” The onlookers chatted. Some people felt sorry for Su Ping, thinking that he was merely making one mistake but more were gloating.

Su Ping walked behind Shi Haochi. They met many other trainers who would stop and say hi to Shi Haochi along the way.

Soon, Su Ping and Shi Haochi reached a building that was more like a villa. Shi Haochi looked at Su Ping. Young as he was, he was not nervous at all. “Wait here. I will go and ask,” Shi Haochi said.

“No problem.” Su Ping nodded.

After Shi Haochi went upstairs, Su Ping looked around the lobby. Many trainers were coming and going. Four master battle pet warriors were standing on guard by the door.

Su Ping didn’t remain standing in the lobby. He went to the lounge, found a chair, and sat down to wait.

He didn’t wait for long. Shi Haochi had returned from upstairs In less than 10 minutes. He quickly went down to the lobby but failed to see Su Ping. To his relief, he found him in the lounge. “Which base city are you from?” Shi Haochi asked, still in disbelief.

Su Ping could tell that Shi Haochi had already verified his identity. “Longjiang Base City,” Su Ping answered.

Shi Haochi asked a follow-up question at once. “Do you run a training stadium or do you work in a store?”

“I work at the Pixie Pet Store. I’m the boss.”

Shi Haochi stood in a daze.

Just then, he called the Vice Chairman and the latter sent him the name and all the pertaining information of the invitee.

Shi Haochi realized that Su Ping was the man!

The name, his family information, and the store he worked in were all checked out!

This young man was indeed the trainer they had invited!!

“I heard about this Moonfrost Dragon that has been progressing at an unbelievable speed. Did you train the dragon?” Shi Haochi could not help but ask again. It was just that Su Ping was too young for him to believe the facts.

It was the first time he had seen a master trainer that young!

Even though he had been born in the Holy Light Base City which was a sacred place for all trainers, he had never seen a master trainer close to twenty years of age!

“Yes, that’s me.” Su Ping nodded.

Su Ping answered, fully at ease. Shi Haochi felt himself trembling. He could not tell if it was due to excitement or astonishment. Some time before, the Vice Chairman had shown him a video clip.

It was the clip of a battle and the origin was unclear. But it was clear that the video had not been fabricated. The Moonfrost Dragon in the video had freaked Shi Haochi out. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

From the size, shape, limbs, the number of teeth, given his years’ experience as a trainer, he could tell that the Moonfrost Dragon had just reached adulthood!

The Moonfrost Dragon was merely at the seventh rank!

To be more exact, it had just reached the seventh rank!

However, it had demonstrated abilities close to the ninth rank, and even stronger than other ninth-rank battle pets!

That was amazing!

It was true that dragons were born to be superior and there could be some mutation, but the fact remained that the Moonfrost Dragon was unique.

Shi Haochi had once thought that not even a top-level trainer could have done that!

“How did you train the dragon?” The question had slipped Shi Haochi’s mouth before he knew it.

Su Ping answered. “Nothing much. Just ‘practice’!”

That answer was unexpected. But Shi Haochi soon found himself an explanation. Apart from the beginner trainers, the trainers would usually have their unique training methodologies. To ask a question like this was not polite. He was glad that Su Ping didn’t seem to mind the question.

“Sorry for the inappropriate question. Mr. Su, what is your trainer’s rank?” Shi Haochi’s apology was followed by another question.

Su Ping was speechless. Not this again!

“I don’t know, probably elementary ranks? I have never taken the tests anyway. I don’t know which test I can pass.” Su Ping gave an honest answer.

“Mr. Su, you must be joking. If you have trained the Moonfrost Dragon, then you must be at the master level. You cannot be at the elementary level with such results.” Shi Haochi forced a smile. No wonder the Trainers Association was inviting Su Ping to that conference. The association was most definitely thinking about recruiting such a special genius. “Is that so? Master level it is.”

Su Ping nodded. After all, Shi Haochi was a master trainer. He had to know what he was talking about.

“What a young man, with such a huge potential. Mr. Su, I wonder who your teacher is,” Shi Haochi said with admiration. A twenty year old master trainer. There was no doubt that Su Ping could become a top-level trainer in the future. Maybe there was a slight chance that Su Ping could become a Holy Spirit Trainer who would enjoy even superior positions. Even a legendary battle pet warrior would have to butter up to a Holy Spirit Trainer!

“Teacher?

“Does a system count?”

“What?”

“Nothing. Self-taught,” Su Ping said.

Shi Haochi didn’t understand a single word but he thought Su Ping probably didn’t want to leak the information. Self-taught? Not possible. To become a master trainer at the age of twenty was unbelievable as it was, not to mention without a teacher.

“Mr. Su, the conference will be held tomorrow. You have just come a long way from Longjiang Base City. Have you found a place to reside? How about you crash at my place tonight?” Shi Haochi proposed. He felt glad that he was seeing his students off, which gave him a chance to run into Su Ping.

Su Ping was from Longjiang and barely knew anyone in the Holy Light Base City. This was the perfect opportunity for Shi Haochi to build a relationship with him. In the future, when Su Ping became a top-level trainer, he would have already had an outstanding connection.

“Sure.” Su Ping nodded.

That would save him time that he would otherwise spend on finding a hotel.

“Mr. Su, this must be your first time here. How about I find someone to show you around the headquarters?” Shi Haochi asked.

“No need. I’ll just walk around by myself,” Su Ping answered. He was also interested in this place.

“Of course.” Shi Haochi nodded. Shi Haochi thought of an idea, “Mr. Su, please wait for me here. I will go and get my ID. no one will stop you with it, no matter where you go.”

Usually, he would leave his ID in the office drawer. After all, he had been there for years. He didn’t need an ID to get around. “Okay.”

Su Ping nodded. He had been in trouble just because he didn’t have an ID. He had to admit that the ID would make things much easier for him.

Shi Haochi left in a hurry and came back in a hurry. He gave a medal to Su Ping.

It was a hexagon medal with the edge shaped like a flame. A tiger was carved on the front of the medal; there was a dent on the back, in which a picture could be put in. Shi Haochi’s picture was in it.

Su Ping noticed that the tiger was similar to the stone tiger by the gate outside. Shi Haochi noticed that Su Ping was checking the tiger. He volunteered to explain, “This is a battle pet that the Trainers Association’s first-ever Holy Spirit Trainer trained once. The battle pet was a beast of the ninth-rank without hope of moving up. However, our first-ever Holy Spirit Trainer made the beast break through to become a beast king, and a powerful one at that.” That cleared up Su Ping’s confusion.

Having said goodbye to Shi Haochi, Su Ping left the lobby and began to wander around.

Soon, Su Ping reached a cluster of buildings that looked like school facilities. Many people were gathered there to line up in front of one of the buildings.

Surprised, Su Ping took a closer look and noticed the words “Test Center for Trainers” written on the building.

Is this the place where trainers take their tests? Su Ping wondered. Since he was there, he thought he might just as well go and have a look.

“Authorized personnel only.”

“Is that... a master trainer medal?” A guard stopped Su Ping but he showed Shi Haochi’s medal. The guard opened his eyes in astonishment. He realized that Su Ping had to be close to one of the master trainers. As such, the guard let Su Ping go in immediately without asking further questions. The other people cast curious glances over as they heard the guard’s shout of surprise.

“Huh? Isn’t... that...”

In the crowd, a group of young men and young girls were standing together. They could not help but turn around when they heard the guard using the word “master trainer.” One of them was so shocked that he was frozen on the spot.
