Chapter 1122 Test of the Ancient Road

With a single thought, Su Ping covered an ancient lamp with the perfect path of fire. There was a boom, and furious flames burned on the ancient lamp, covering the entire object; it looked like a ball of fire.

Just as I thought, the perfect paths last longer… Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He also extended the law of chaos too, instantly setting all the ancient lamps ablaze. There were nine fireballs in total.

An ancient road appeared at the end of the nine lamps. The road was deep and mysterious. The far end couldn’t be seen, as if it were the stomach of an ancient serpent.

There was no time to waste. Su Ping observed carefully for a moment, and quickly stepped in.

He felt cold from the moment he set foot on the ancient road. He was too strong to feel cold anymore, but the coldness was so real it went straight into the soul.

The Golden Crow shrieked inside Su Ping’s body, driving away the cold. He then observed the environment with fire in his eyes; the previous stone temple was already gone when he set foot on the ancient road. On the two sides of the ancient road was a bottomless, blue and black ocean.

Waves were rising and raging on the ocean, as if something were hidden within. Su Ping’s eyes were solemn. The extent of his master’s briefing only covered up to the legacy’s opening method, but didn’t mention the content of the test. His master was probably unaware of it.

Su Ping didn’t think his master would purposefully keep it a secret from him. Even if his master didn’t foresee he could claim the key, he was undoubtedly capable of passing the first two tests, so it was likely that he would still challenge the third test with others. His master didn’t have a need to keep anything from him.

It seems that those Celestials can’t enter this place. After all, it’s a test personally set up by another Celestial.

Su Ping moved forward and considered, The second test has to do with willpower. Then, what’s the third test about? Combat ability? What did the ancient deity think was most important for his heir? Aptitudes? No. Whoever inherits his legacy will be stuck in the Celestial State anyway, no matter what potential they have.

They can hardly make any improvement beyond the Celestial State.

It’s unnecessary to test potential. Did he test willpower because he was afraid his heir might not be able to endure his power while inheriting the legacy?

So, the third test…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He pondered over the manner while putting himself in the shoes of the dead Celestial expert who had made arrangements to pick his heir. Willpower was definitely necessary to inherit the test. He probably also wanted the heir to fulfill his last wish. Or maybe, he simply wanted to pick an heir of his liking

Could the third test be about personality? But the field didn’t look like it; Su Ping detected coldness and an overwhelming brutality in the ocean on both sides of the road.

The test was definitely not simple. After considering for a moment, Su Ping decided to prove his speculation in the simplest way.

He bellowed, “Ancient master, what’s this test about? Could you just tell me?”

– The simplest way was to ask him directly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Su Ping’s voice echoed in the void, making the waves in the ocean surge even more fiercely.

Still, there was no response in a long time. His eyes glittered. He looked back; the end of the ancient road was already gone. The place he came from was substituted by the same ancient road, stretching to infinity.

He tried walking forward.

Ten meters, a hundred meters, a thousand meters.

Su Ping walked for more than ten minutes, but felt as if he were stuck in the same spot.

There was no way to distinguish directions on that road; no matter how he walked, he couldn’t reach the end.

Is this what the trial is about?

Su Ping tried moving with Void Walker, but the result was the same.

I don’t think this is something achievable with the perfect path of space. If this is the test, then it’s too strange. Not every Star Lord is capable of doing that. A Star Lord who has grasped a perfect path already has the potential of rising to the Celestial State. If his requirement is even more rigorous than that, then the Celestial State expert really overestimated himself…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered as he observed the ocean.

The ocean water felt strange and dangerous. Deep down, he even regretted going to that place.

He didn’t know why he felt that way. All in all, the feeling of uneasiness and danger had been haunting him ever since he arrived at that place.

“Little Skeleton.”

Su Ping summoned the Little Skeleton with a thought.

The little one emerged from the summoning space and landed next to Su Ping, gazing at him.

Su Ping said, “Can you open the gate of the undead? Summon your lackeys to this place.”

The Little Skeleton instantly waved its hands, but shook its head soon after. It was clear that it failed in casting the skill. It was impossible to open the channel to another world from that place.

Su Ping frowned a bit. The Little Skeleton then moved his fingers again, and a dark ball of energy appeared in its hand; the ball then split up into many ghosts!

The spectres floated around the Little Skeleton, which stunned Su Ping. When did it pick up that move?

“You summoned them?” Su Ping asked something he considered self-explanatory immediately after. He then said, “Ask them to investigate the ocean.” The Little Skeleton nodded again; the little ghosts floated into the ocean like black balls.

Su Ping had an ominous feeling when the first ghost entered the ocean. He quickly said, “Stop. Bring them back.”

The Little Skeleton was stunned, but quickly did as told. The last few ghosts immediately floated back; however, the ghosts that did enter the water earlier never returned. Red light glittered in the Little Skeleton’s eyes, as if examining something. But the next moment, huge tides rose from the ocean and clashed against the road.

Following that, the ocean became ferocious and violent.

Su Ping’s expression changed somewhat as he examined the environment with the ultimate treasures he had.

The next moment, he saw a terrifying creature in the midst of the rising tide. The creature was revealed after the tide receded. Half of its body was exposed to the air. There were scary sharp stings on its back.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He was horrified, as it was neither a Star Lord beast, nor an Ascendant State beast, but a Celestial State creature! He could tell from his goosebumps that his assessment was undoubtedly accurate!

A Celestial State beast is in charge of the test?

Su Ping found it absurd!

Run!

Su Ping didn’t dally for a second as he took out all the treasures he had.

He activated the Prime Sky Mirror and quickly cloned himself. Then, he tried to escape into another space through the mirror, only to find that the local space was like a piece of iron; he couldn’t enter the void, nor teleport himself!

“Damn it!”

Su Ping was rather infuriated. He had a nagging feeling that the trial was more like a trap!

The beast was definitely not friendly!

“Path of Illusion!” Su Ping didn’t have the least bit of interest in fighting back. He invoked the power of his triple small worlds, and also performed the path of illusion to the fullest!

He instantly concealed his aura, and transformed into an illusion. He then took out a tremendous number of items and threw them to the ocean and the road.

As for himself, he reduced himself to the size of a grain with the transformation power of the Eight Nine Astral Painting; he hid himself inside a piece of inconspicuous armor.

The armor was hanging on one side of the road, seemingly about to fall into the ocean. It seemed to be quite remarkable. The clone made with the Prime Sky Mirror was standing and glowing while holding the mirror and all the ultimate treasures surrounding him, as if ready for battle.

By then, the behemoth had already swum to the ancient road, slowly revealing itself in the seawater. It turned out to be a giant, scary fish looking down at Su Ping on the ancient road, with its mouth open wide.

Next, red light darted out of its eyes and penetrated all of the ultimate treasures.

The Prime Sky Mirror rolled and tried to block it, only to be straight-off penetrated.

The Ascendant State treasure was destroyed, just like that.

While shrouded by the red light, his clone turned a red sculpture, which then flew towards the weird fish’s head.

A tentacle suddenly rose from the weird fish’s nape. There was a ball that looked like a lantern at the end of the tentacle; it absorbed the sculpture, and then disappeared.

After that, the weird fish turned around and raised a tide as it returned to the ocean.

Tides were still surging in the ocean, pushing everything that was on the ancient roadincluding the armor where Su Ping was currently hiding-into the seawater. The ancient road was so clean that it seemed as if Su Ping had never been there.

He fell into the ocean, and instantly noticed a freezing cold.

He didn’t resist it; he simply allowed the coldness to invade him. Su Ping was concealing all his aura at the moment. He even had the feeling that the strange fish had already noticed him, and was staring at him in a teasing manner, somewhere deep down the ocean.
