Chapter 1125 Rebirth

“Is that so?”

Su Ping twisted one of the glove’s fingers with a thought, and a tiny part of flesh fell from it.

Then, the tiny piece of flesh solidified into a thumb-sized figurine, which gradually rose from the ground. Su Ping spouted a mouthful of astral power that was soon absorbed by the figurine; it soon advanced to the Void State.

“You…”

The fat kid was astounded by what he saw; he never realized that Su Ping could create lives out of nothing!

That required a great expertise on the path of vitality!

Su Ping had already mastered it to the fullest.

Ascendants could even establish their own kingdoms in their small worlds.

When considering Celestials, they could create plenty of lives with a mere thought. They were Creators in a sense.

The power of faith that Shen Huang had gifted him was precisely drawn from lives he had created. However, those lives were mediocre in general; it wasn’t unusual that only one in ten billion creatures would have reasonable potential.

It was impossible to create lives with divine constitutions, unless they picked some rare media when the lives were constructed.

To put it simply, creating lives was just like molding clay figurines; the quality of the clay figurines depended on the clay they were made of.

Most importantly, the created lives could only stay in their creator’s small world and couldn’t appear in the real universe. They would quickly die once they were exposed, as they couldn’t endure the mysterious power of the universe.

That seemed to be the universe’s way of warning the cultivators that life itself was taboo!

Su Ping then cut the pill piece he had bitten off in two, and threw half into the mouth of the tiny creature he had created.

Moments later, the vitality inside the tiny creature plummeted, dropping from the Void State to the Ocean State, but it had even more abundant energy. It also gained a second-rate constitution!

Su Ping raised his eyebrows ever so slightly; as it turned out, the pill didn’t lie to him.

“What a waste!”

The fat kid was quite regretful to see part of his body be eaten. “I can reshape your body and build it up. If you have a normal body, I can improve it and make it an excellent body. If it’s excellent, I can make it rare…”

“So to speak, you truly are a great pill.” Su Ping’s eyes glittered with greed.

Even so, he didn’t pounce to eat the pill; instead, he asked, “Where’s your Sister Pan[1]? Are there other guardians here besides her?”

The fat kid asked back, “Aren’t you that old… man’s monster? How come you don’t know that?”

“You must have figured out already that I snuck into this place. I’m going to cut another piece off you if you ask me again!” said Su Ping ferociously.

The fat kid was terrified but relieved at the same time. He wasn’t sure whether Su Ping was an unlucky man or a disciple who had entered without permission; it could be either.

“I’ll tell you everything, but who exactly is Sister Pan?” asked the confused fat kid.

“I was referring to the sister you mentioned just now!” “Huh? Okay…” The fat kid understood. Instead of asking why Su Ping called him in such a way, he confessed dutifully, “Sister Golden Lotus commands us all, but she was restrained and weakened by your master. Still, she’s a nice person and we all listen to her.

“Aside from Sister Golden Lotus, there’s a bully who is actually your master’s weapon. She’s watching over this place.

“She’s a king-level artifact named Evolution Forge; it can melt all weapons and transform them into unparalleled treasures. She may later become a great emperor-level weapon if she also eats some top materials!” The fat kid quickly added, “But your master seemed to be concerned about her; he imposed three restraints on the weapon, fearing it would eat up all the other artifacts in his treasury by the time he was reborn. He would be held hostage by his own weapon if that were to happen; so, even though the bully is a guardian, she cannot leave his place easily.”

Su Ping asked, “How do you know that my master is in the process of being reborn?”

“Sister Golden Lotus told us. In fact, we would have guessed it even if she hadn’t told us anything. Your master searched for materials everywhere and created pills, including me. He was badly wounded back then, and had to be reborn in order to recover,” said the fat kid.

Su Ping was silent.

The trial was indeed a trap. However, rebirth… Was the man hoping to be reborn inside the body of one of the intruders?

If that were the case, Su Ping was the first person to enter the palace. Why wasn’t he picked?

Am I not handsome enough for him? Su Ping instantly felt affronted.

“My master’s fish is watching over this place. You said you know how to get out of here; what is your method?” asked Su Ping.

The fat kid asked nervously, “What if you eat me after I tell you everything?”

“I can still eat you, even if you don’t tell anything,” said Su Ping, “I can ask your Sister Pan after I eat you!”

“Please don’t eat me; I’m really not palatable. I’ll just tell you the truth, please don’t eat me. I can tell you my recipe, so that you can create another pill,” said the fat kid, eager to stay alive.

Lost for words for a moment, Su Ping finally said, “Just tell me the truth. I wouldn’t mind sparing your life if you’re obedient.”

“All right,” swiftly replied the fat kid. Then, he said, “These are the depths of the Nether Ocean. Your master’s Ghost Lamp Nether Fish is outside, watching over this place. However, there’s a teleportation channel underneath the palace which leads to your master’s study; that’s where the techniques he gathered over time are stored. We can find an exit there.”

“As simple as that?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows.

The fat kid quickly shook his head. “The teleportation channel is the challenge; that’s the place where the bully was restrained. If we want to leave, we have to do it when the bully is not paying attention.”

Su Ping rolled his eyes. “You said the bully is a king-level treasure, which is half as strong as my master when he was alive. We’ll both be obliterated if she notices us!”

The fat kid said pitifully, “But that’s the only way out; we can only slip out when she’s not watching. It’s been a long time since any unlucky man has descended to the palace. She’s been sleeping for a long time; we stand a good chance if we’re careful.”

“Then, why did the bully not teleport herself out of here? She should be free now that my master isn’t restraining her anymore, right?” “Your master left a magic sutra suppressing her inside the study; it’s one of the three restraints set on the bully. She doesn’t dare go there, as she would only be driven back,” said the fat kid.

“The magic sutra?” Su Ping was stunned. Was it an advanced technique?

What a great secret technique it must be!

“Then wouldn’t we only end up dead if we enter the study?” demanded Su Ping furiously.

The fat kid quickly said, “No, we won’t. Sister Golden Lotus is very close to the magic sutra; it will let us pass if she talks to it.”

“How do you know?”

“Sister Golden Lotus told me.” Su Ping stared at the fat kid, deep in thought.

He chose not to waste any more of his time a moment later. He turned his finger into a knife, and directly cut off half of the fat kid’s body. He said, “I’ll eat you if you’re lying to me. I’ll return this half when I leave if you’re telling the truth.”

The fat kid screamed. After hearing what Su Ping said, he stammered, “You’re just as vicious as your master. I’ve been speaking nothing but the truth, and yet you still don’t believe me!”

“Cut the crap. Let’s go see your Sister Pan.” Su Ping instantly moved out. He had to try, whether the fat kid was speaking the truth or not.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Things wouldn’t work out if he had to stay there forever. If the owner of the ruins was truly reborn, he would surely go there after his rebirth. He might even discover Su Ping, even though the latter had the perfect path of illusion.

The fat kid was decisive; he moved out of the jade box along with Su Ping, then led the way.

The fat round pill rolled over plenty of Ascendant State treasures, while a glove crawled after him. They soon entered an ancient room where a lot of treasures had been messily piled up. There were also medicines and strange branches emitting godly auras. While rolling at the front, the fat kid pointed out the hideouts of other treasures for Su Ping. “That’s Sister Jar’s place; that’s Brother Fire’s territory…”

Shortly after they reached the end of the room, where Su Ping saw that a golden gourd was floating in midair.

The fat kid pointed at the gourd and said, “Sister Golden Lotus is right there.”
