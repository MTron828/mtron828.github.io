Chapter 1486 The Ancestral God’s Tribulation (1)

“I’m only returning your favor,” Su Ping said coldly. He casually waved a hand to make the sword aura on his fingertip disappear. Then, he simply ignored the gloomy Rain Ancestor and returned to the world of gods.

Killing intent flashed in the man’s eyes, but he stayed his hand. It would be dangerous if they continued to fight and the ferocious dragon noticed anything.

The young human was no longer the same. The godly ancestor could hardly kill him on his own.

Su Ping returned to the desolate plain.

The place had already become a dark void. There was a bottomless pit on the ground.

He opted for staying there; that way no innocents would be killed. He looked at the sky, and saw how the world was already healing, and the Rain Ancestor’s aura was gone. The man had probably left.

Su Ping ignored the latter’s actions. If there was another sneak attack during the tribulation, he would make the guy experience the Heavenly Tribulation along with him.

With no hesitation, he released his auras unreservedly and soon reached the peak God Emperor level. The world suddenly became quiet when the Fire Dao’s undying universe was released.

There was still a breeze and clouds were floating, but nothing was ordinary.

In the distance, at the border of the desolate plain-none of the ones forced to retreat had left; they only stayed by the edge of the battlefield. All of them were shocked by Su Ping’s aura, not expecting him to still be there after such a fierce battle. It could only mean that he didn’t lose!

He couldn’t be a mere God Emperor if he was able to resist the Rain Ancestor’s attacks. He couldn’t be killed if he was also an Ancestral God!

Such realization left all the Rain Clan’s emperors with troubled expressions.

The elders of the Heaven Path Institute and the human emperors, however, were so thrilled that they were shaking.

Elder Yan Qing looked into the distance, where Su Ping was. There was shock and disbelief in her clear eyes. After such a short time, the junior in her eyes was already qualified to fight the Rain Ancestor!

“He’s already…”

Qian Hong swallowed as she stood in the crowd. She felt that her throat was extremely dry. It was incredible for her; she would have taken everything as a hallucination if it weren’t for the barren ground and the bottomless abyss.

She was trying to become a God Emperor, while Su Ping was already trying to become an Ancestral God.

No wonder… That’s why he was able to destroy the Heavenly Tribulation apart with one sword attack.

The tribulation for a God Emperor wasn’t much in Ancestral Gods’ eyes.

But then… Does it mean that he already had Ancestral God might while still being a God King?

Qian Hong’s mind went blank after such a thought; it was impossible to find any words to describe such an existence. He had shocked all the gods by killing emperors while being a realm lower. To be able to go head to head with Ancestral Gods while still being a God King… It was definitely unique! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He was the first to achieve that in all of history…

Her heart jolted when she looked in a certain direction, given that an intense aura was being emitted. Every genius wanted to be remembered. Her goal had never been to defeat those at her level, but to challenge the most famous geniuses in history. However, according to the records, she knew she was far from achieving such a goal.

As for Su Ping, she believed he was definitely the best in all of history!

I wonder if it’s lucky for me to live in the same age as this genius… Qian Hong thought bitterly.

Other than the Heaven Path Institute and the human representatives who were genuinely happy for Su Ping, the rest of the gods were shocked because of the young man’s feat. Nobody expected that a battle with Ancestral Gods would take place.

A new Ancestral God would probably rise very soon!

Dum!!!

All of a sudden-an illusory bell appeared right underneath the wall protecting the universe. As huge as a mountain, the artifact was ringing in the distance.

The sound seemed to be traveling through time.

Everybody was shocked by the ancient bell’s phantom.

“That’s the Grand Emperor Divine Bell!”

“The Grand Emperor Divine Bell is ringing! It’s the sign of an Ancestral God!”

“The other continents are probably hearing this too, right?”

Everybody was shocked. They had doubts at first, but the phenomenon reassured them.

The bell would appear every time an Ancestral God emerged. It was a chaos-made item, born in the depths of the godly universe. Nobody controlled it and nobody knew where it was; however, it would ring every time someone broke through to the Ancestral level.

The ringing would sound throughout the world of gods. This would alert all clans that a new Ancestral God had emerged.

Such a level was the peak for gods; any clan would have to look up to those apex cultivators.

Right then, in the sky above the godly world

—the illusion of a bell more than 100,000 kilometers wide appeared like the sun. It did seem illusory, but the carved Dao Glyphs it had were clearly visible. The odd thing was, normal people would soon forget those symbols after seeing them. Only God Kings managed to remember some.

The appearance of the bell would always be seen as a feat for any and all the cultivators in the world of gods!

All experts would benefit from the birth of an Ancestral God!

“The Grand Emperor Divine Bell!” “It’s appeared again. I’ve seen it three times in my life!”

“Who knows which clan has the Ancestral God hopeful. I wonder if they will die during the tribulation!”

“An Ancestral God… I wish there was an Ancestral God in our clan.”
