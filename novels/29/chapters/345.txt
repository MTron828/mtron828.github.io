Chapter 348 Instant Defeat! Out-of-control!

Although there was the word “dragon” in the name of the “Dark Dragon Hound,” the pet already had nothing to do with dragons, and the original dragon part in its bloodline was mixed with god knows how many races for god knows how many generations. The Dark Dragon Hound shouldn’t have been able to inherit any dragon skills, let alone the dragon’s roar.

Besides, the Dark Dragon Hound’s roar was appalling, and even more sonorous than the Apparition Ghoul’s cry! The judge wore a more serious expression. He was right. The Dark Dragon Hound was strange.

“What!”

Liu Qingfeng found the Dark Dragon Hound’s roar familiar. He felt a chill running down his spine. Something sprang to his mind. He thought of another horrifying pet.

That mutated Moonfrost Dragon. The Dark Dragon Hound was roaring just like the Moonfrost Dragon did!!

The contempt in Liu Qingfeng’s eyes vanished; fear took its place. Was he hallucinating? This was too much of a coincidence. Was the pet... He suddenly remembered that Xu Kuang bought the Top 5 package from that store!

The Moonfrost Dragon’s master was the girl aiming for the championship!

Both the pets were being trained in the same store!

He instantly felt a chill coming from the soles of his feet, making him shudder.

Soon, he settled his mind and his emotions. The Moonfrost Dragon was unusually horrifying but it was a dragon, to begin with. Dragons were born to be powerful and after special training, it wasn’t strange that it could exhibit uncommon power. But he was only facing a sixth-rank Dark Dragon Hound at the moment.

Nevertheless, just to be safe, Liu Qingfeng decided to alter his previous plan. He was going to bypass the Dark Dragon Hound and attack Xu Kuang directly.

He was young. However, as the future family head of the Liu Family, he was steady and could focus on the big picture.

Charge!

Liu Qingfeng was ready. His Nether Ghost was deterred by the dragon’s roar for a bit but that lasted for less than half a second. Under Liu Qingfeng’s command, the Nether Ghost let out a shrill and unpleasant cry that was inaudible for most people.

But that evil cry was darting toward the opposite side like a sharp needle. Xu Kuang had anticipated this move. The moment the Nether Ghost started its skill, Xu Kuang told his Apparition Ghoul to unleash “Ghost Whispers,” a spiritual defensive skill that would fend off the incoming attack.

Roar!!

Liu Qingfeng’s Crystal-wing Dragon roared and rushed at them.

The moment the dragon sprinted out, some lines formed by astral powers appeared on its body. The dragon’s speed, strength, defense, and even reaction were elevated instantly!

Charge!

Flames rose from the Crystal-wing Dragon. The scorching heat ignited the air across the stage. Even people outside the seal could feel the temperature rapidly rising. It was as if there were a massive furnace on the stage, burning away.

Xu Kuang gulped. He was a bit nervous. In his previous battle, he had suffered a lot because of the Crystal-wing Dragon which was a crazy and wild pet. The dragon’s skin was tough and its strength was mighty. Xu Kuang was unable to defeat the dragon back then.

Can the Dark Dragon Hound... do it?

His confidence from before dropped a bit as the Crystal-wing Dragon gained momentum.

The Dark Dragon Hound showed its teeth.

The hound stepped forward slowly, with bolts of lightning flickering around its four limbs.

That was the Thunder Sprint, an enhanced version.

Attack...

The Dark Dragon Hound felt Xu Kuang’s will was conveyed through the contract. The Dark Dragon Hound was ready. The roaring flames were coming at it, casting a red hue into its eyes.

The Dark Dragon Hound was in a daze. It seemed as if that evil man were standing behind and telling it to attack! The man was whispering into its ears.

The Dark Dragon Hound felt it had returned to those harsh environments and the voice was repeating, ‘attack’!

Hiss!

The Dark Dragon Hound showed its fangs and its eyes turned blood red.

Attack!

Attack!!

A dark aura oozed out from the Dark Dragon Hound all of a sudden; that aura grew and tumbled around. A huge wolf that was over a dozen meters tall came into being behind the Dark Dragon Hound. The wolf stood on the ground, ready to make a move. “No!”

The judge standing in the air turned ghastly pale the moment he saw the ferocious wolf.

The Crystal-wing Dragon was still charging forward and it, too, had blood-red eyes. In a fit of rage, the Crystal-wing Dragon didn’t notice anything different. The running dragon shook the stage. In an instant, the dragon had reached the Dark Dragon Hound, ready to tear the latter apart! The dragon waved its burning claws. The heat was distorting the air.

The Dark Dragon Hound slowly raised its head.

There was extreme violence hidden in that pair of eyes!

Destruction!!

Roar!!

The Dark Dragon Hound suddenly leaped forward and so did the huge wolf figure behind it. In less than a second, the Dark Dragon Hound had pressed the Crystal-wing Dragon to the ground and the huge wolf figure had the dragon completely under control. The wolf’s fangs which were made of black flames pierced into the Crystal-wing Dragon!

Those fangs were as sharp as swords. The wolf bit into the Crystal-wing Dragon’s shoulder and tore up a huge piece of flesh. The flames on the wolf’s fangs had scorched the flesh black.

Under the layer of burnt flesh, the dragon’s blood was boiling! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The flames had boiled the blood!

The excruciating pain woke up the Crystal-wing Dragon. The redness in its eyes began to fade away. The dragon stared at the ferocious figure, while roaring in fear and anger. The dragon’s scales stood up, summoning the Fire Protection while it also tried hard to push away that black monster. Even so, as soon as the Fire Protection was up, the dark flames had burnt through it within a second!

Pff!

The huge wolf formed by the dark flames ripped off one of the dragon’s wings. Blood was pouring down!

That scene quieted everyone down.

“How is that...?” Liu Qingfeng’s mind was slipping away. The Crystal-wing Dragon had been assisted by the two secondary pets with ninth-rank bloodlines. At the moment, the Crystal-wing Dragon should have strength almost equal to the titled rank. How could the dragon lose the advantage?

How could the dragon be completely overpowered?

While he was still in shock, he suddenly noticed that all the light had vanished and he couldn’t even feel his pets. The only thing he could feel was that a pair of eyes were staring at him from behind, a pair of eyes that spoke of violence and coldness.

Those were the eyes of a crazy monster! “No!”

Liu Qingfeng felt his heart had stopped beating. Death!

It was because he was seeing death!

“No, no!!” He was seized with terror. He was going to lead the Liu Family in the future. Was he about to die there? That could not happen! Roar!!

Within the darkness, a ferocious figure leaped across. It was the Dark Dragon Hound which had run past the Crystal-wing Dragon and was going after Liu Qingfeng directly.

When the Dark Dragon Hound was about twenty meters away from Liu Qingfeng, it suddenly felt a piercing pain in the depths of its spirit, of its brain. Even its soul was hurting!

Roar, roar, roar!!

The pain enraged the Dark Dragon Hound. It lost its mind and the violent aura around it grew even more intense. Staring at Liu Qingfeng madly, the Dark Dragon Hound threw itself at him.

Whoosh!

The Dark Dragon Hound was five meters away. Liu Qingfeng believed that his death was near when a man came to his rescue. It was the judge!

Over a dozen astral shields with mysterious patterns appeared in front of the judge.

Bang!

The moment the shields were set up, they were crushed into pieces by the Dark Dragon Hound!

Panicked, the judge raised his hand. An oval shield flew out. It was a secret artifact!

Bang!!

The Dark Dragon Hound’s claws smashed into the shield and the shield was pushed back; the judge flew backward for three meters.

That impact...

The judge couldn’t believe this. When he looked closer, he noticed that blood was seeping out from the Dark Dragon Hound’s fur and hair. Apparently, that strong impact had hurt the hound seriously.

The judge collected his thoughts and shouted to Xu Kuang in the distance, “Stop. You won the match.”

enses.

Xu Kuang had yet to come back to his senses Everything that went down had happened at lightning speed. He didn’t even see when the Dark Dragon Hound ran toward Liu Qingfeng and was clueless as to why the judge would come down.

Judges would interfere when they deemed that the life of one of the participants was in danger; this participant would be declared as the loser.

A titled-ranked judge would have never interfered for no reason. They would only stop the match when the danger was fatal.

Did I win?

Xu Kuang could not believe this. It was a bit fast, wasn’t it?

The judge’s shout pulled Xu Kuang back to reality. He quickly ordered the Dark Dragon Hound to stop.

However, that was when things took a turn for the worse.

Roar!!

The Dark Dragon Hound growled with a thundering rage. It ignored Xu Kuang’s command!

The pain from its wounds irritated the Dark Dragon Hound and the power of the contract over its mind was becoming vague. As such, at this moment, the Dark Dragon Hound unleashed the violence that it had pushed to the depths of its heart!

The killing intent and cruelty had consumed the Dark Dragon Hound, heart and soul!

Destruction!!

Once again, puffs of black smoke rose from the Dark Dragon Hound and the smoke soon grew to become a horrifying wolf!

This time, the wolf was over twenty meters tall. The towering wolf landed on the ground on all fours and emitted an energy that could only be found in the most ferocious monsters.

“What...?”

The judge was terrified.

The Dark Dragon Hound was out of control?!

He could see that there was no clarity left in the red eyes of the battle pet!

Feel that killing intent. How many deaths would the pet have to experience to accumulate this much killing intent?

“No!”

“It’s getting out of control!”

“What kind of monster is that? A Dark Dragon Hound? That cannot be a Dark Dragon Hound!”

ai

The ones sitting in the front rows-members from the major families and the municipal government, as well as some professors – could tell that something was wrong. They, too, were seized with terror.

The Dark Dragon Hound was like a monster from hell. They could feel that coldness even from the place they were seated.

The Dark Dragon Hound’s terrifying abilities were not the most shocking aspect. What appalled people was its cruelty. Not even some pets of the demon family at the peak could exhibit this level of violence!

What kind of training had this pet gone through?

“Open up the seal!!”

An official in suit and tie bellowed in haste.
