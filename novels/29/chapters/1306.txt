Chapter 1308 Dao Child (1)

Chen Xi’s expression changed quickly; he was forgetting what he saw moments before. He was also feeling how fast it was happening; some sort of power was affecting his mind and memories, which frightened him.

He didn’t feel an invasion of his mind; however, the fading of his memories was obvious.

Everything he had seen about his opponent was disappearing at a fast rate.

He’s not from this world…

Damn it…

It only took but a moment to forget everything he learned while peeping. Only the deepest fear of that young human remained. All his cells were telling him to keep a safe distance from his opponent, who was extremely dangerous! “What’s going on with Chen Xi?”

In midair-an elder was stunned by Chen Xi’s reaction, obviously noticing the smell of fear on the guy.

Is he scared of Su Ping?

“Must be his new technique; he can invade other people’s consciousness with his physical body. I don’t know the specifics but he’ll become a tricky opponent when he becomes an emperor. However, his move seems to have failed…” whispered the big-headed child with glittering eyes.

Chan Gong glanced at him and said, “You seem to know a lot. You two aren’t really close, are you?”

“No, but Emperor Bai is an old friend of mine; he’s this young one’s recurrent advisor.” The big-headed child grimaced.

“Why isn’t Emperor Bai here?”

“He’s been training in seclusion. You know he’s long been aiming for the Ancestral God breakthrough and he never gives up!” The child-like elder chuckled.

“This young human carries too many secrets; even I can’t see through him. I wonder whether this is a blessing or a curse for the Heaven Path Institute,” said an old man.

Yan Huang frowned. “What do you mean?”

“He’s had a lot of fateful encounters from unknown sources. I don’t know if they’re any good,” said the old man.

Yan Huang smiled casually with pride in her eyes. “His greatest opportunity was joining the Heaven Path Institute. Could there be a better opportunity in this world than that?”

“True.” The old man nodded. “I think Chen Xi has already lost. There’s something wrong with him; maybe the human played a trick on him. He’s lost all his fighting will and killing intent; only fear remains. He can’t defeat his opponent like this… We’ll ask him to tell us more about it when the battle is over.”

“Chen Xi loses and Su Ping, a human being, becomes the new Dao Child. What a day,” remarked the big-headed child.

Chan Gong chuckled. “I hope you won’t be petty. Having attained the title, he’ll be qualified to enter the Ancestral Gods’ Land; I wonder if the Ancestral Gods will like him. In any case, he’ll rise and become a powerful emperor from this institute.”

Even though the battle was still in progress, everyone could tell that Chen Xi didn’t stand much chance of winning.

He was reeking of fear. Even his sword was trembling; how could he possibly win?

“Do you have other moves?” asked Su Ping while Chen Xi kept moving backwards.

Chen Xi trembled instinctively because of Su Ping’s voice. He soon realized that, but he couldn’t remember why he was scared of the human. Anger rose in his heart, but aimed at himself. A Dao Child was scared by someone of that level?

No, it wasn’t exactly a peer, because Su Ping was at a major realm lower than him!

Such a fact made this even more unforgivable!

However, even though angry, he found it possible to contain his fear, which was beyond the mental level. His body was shaking uncontrollably.

Why is this happening? Chen Xi’s heart was full of questions. Gritting his teeth, he decided to attack again.

Bang!

This time he activated the power of his small universe and unleashed his constitution. His body grew and became a twenty-meter tall giant when he appeared in front of Su Ping and launched a slashing attack.

His sword was so large it was as long as Su Ping’s height. The attack was abrupt.

Su Ping didn’t hold back either. He unleashed the universe of chaos and fused it with his body. Then, using God’s Arrival, he released seventy percent of his power.

After a boom, his cold sword illuminated the sky and split the void apart. Along with a piercing scream, Chen Xi’s sword was broken and his body was torn apart.

Su Ping appeared next to Chen Xi. He couldn’t help but shake his head as he looked at the wounded opponent. Fear had significantly affected Chen Xi’s speed and strength; he was no match for Su Ping, at all. Even Qing Mu, whom he had defeated once, could very likely beat him in that condition.

It was all caused by the system’s deterrence.

Su Ping lost interest. He instantly said, “Take this attack!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Time was reversed, and the strength that Su Ping had just exhausted returned to his body. He was restored to his prime status, which was one of the benefits of mastering the secrets of time; he could stay in his peak state indefinitely. Even if he was too exhausted to recover by reversing time, he could borrow his own power from another time and space.

Bang!

His second attack was launched with full strength. The terrifying sword was swept out furiously, as if a torrent of chaos was moving in a random fashion.

Chen Xi—who had just healed his body-was shivering. It was possible to block the attack if he used all his strength to counter, but his fear prompted him to pick a defensive position. The next moment, his body was drowned in the sword auras.
