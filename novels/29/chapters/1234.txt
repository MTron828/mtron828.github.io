Chapter 1236 Unfolding World

“This is impossible!” said a voice, which was a cry of the woman’s soul. She was still alive, even though her head was gone, but she was so scared that her soul was ready to flee.

Su Ping had almost done her in.

The Dao Patterns currently gnawing at her neck stump gave her an irresistible feeling. What a brutal failure!

She was a Heavenly Lord!

Run!

She had no time to think as she was overwhelmed by an unprecedented consternation. Flesh wriggled on her arm and formed another head. Her collarbone also split up as she tried to abandon the flesh on her neck which had been contaminated by Su Ping’s Dao Patterns. She was unable to cleanse it, so she could only abandon it!

However, the head on her arm had exploded again before she could see the environment clearly.

“You!”

A cry of fear echoed, and many shadows appeared out of nowhere. The woman summoned her pets. “Stop struggling, and don’t make your partners die for you. It’s not worth it,” said Su Ping calmly.

The woman almost vomited blood after hearing that. What do you mean by ‘it’s not worth it’?

These are my pets. Should I just not use them and die?

She obviously didn’t have it in her to argue with Su Ping, nor did she have the time to. She simply ordered her pets to stall Su Ping no matter what as soon as they appeared.

A beam of golden light also darted out of her body; it was a ball of golden flesh that carried her soul and laws. It dashed towards the distance.

“You can’t run away.”

Su Ping shook his head and ignored the pets currently lunging at him. Although ferocious, they were merely following orders. His body shimmered and appeared in front of the golden light; he then gathered Dao Patterns on his fingertip and slashed like a blade.

“How can you be so fast?”

The woman sounded dumbfounded. She was fleeing using her ultimate treasures, and still, Su Ping caught up? That treasure had helped her escape from a Celestial in the past.

That feat alone had earned her the Heavenly Lord title.

Even so, she was actually stopped by Su Ping?

“Haven’t you noticed yet? You’re already in my world…” said Su Ping and ruthlessly gathered the nine Dao Patterns again to cut the golden light apart, along with the woman’s soul hiding within. Su Ping quickly punched several times and dispersed her soul, currently punch drunk.

Su Ping raised a hand the next second-a mouth appeared, which absorbed the dispersing golden light.

A torn piece of paper was spat by the mouth on his palm. Then, the mouth closed and disappeared; his hand was back to normal.

Given Su Ping’s physical prowess and endowments allowed him to resurrect with one drop of blood, and he could freely change any body part.

Su Ping detected a stream of power coursing his body after absorbing the woman’s soul fragments. There was even more power of chaos in his body; he was getting closer to the upper limit.

However, he was still unable to break the bottleneck.

Su Ping heaved a sigh, and then looked at the woman’s pets. He waved a hand and summoned the World of Mythical Chaosvast and hazy, which carried a primordial pressure. Seven Ascendant pets woke up from their daze, then looked at Su Ping with fright. What happened just now? Someone just died. She was from that human’s own kind.

She was just as strong as us, and this man just ate her.

The seven pets’ memories of the woman were already gone. They had just watched Su Ping eat the woman’s soul. They wanted to run away, but they were too scared to move. “Get inside.”

Su Ping simply made them enter his world; he could subdue them and sell them in his store later. Two of those pets were as strong as the Black Emperor Red Feather Phoenix and could fetch a reasonable price. His store could be upgraded to level six if all of them were sold.

None of those pets resisted, no matter how reluctant they were. They could only obey, as they sensed that the human was a more terrifying being than them.

Su Ping recalled the eighth world after the seven pets went inside. He had already unfolded seven small worlds to block the battlefield before he went to that point of time; it would be impossible for anyone to see what had happened. Still, some Heavenly Lords would have sensed the battle that had happened in another time and space without the small worlds.

I must go help Senior Brother You Long.

Su Ping recalled the multiple small worlds and looked at the other points in time, instantly seeing that the Ascendant cultivators from both factions were fighting and pursuing each other in different timelines.

Su Ping quickly found Senior Brother You Long in another time and space.

Whoosh!

You Long had previously supported him back in the Loulan family territory; Su Ping had always remembered the favor.

Boom!

You Long was fighting a bloody battle in the void. He seemed to be in a mess, his pets making a defensive ring. The opponent wasn’t any better, as they were evenly matched.

“Damn it!”

The longer You Long fought, the more anxious he became. He wanted to end the battle as soon as possible to rush and help Su Ping, as he feared that others would gang up on his junior brother.

Su Ping was only a Star Lord, but he was a sworn enemy to the Heavenly Devil Alliance. Those Ascendants would have gone after him even without the bounty.

This was especially so because Su Ping had shown extraordinary potential and could cause a great disaster in the future. None of them would sleep in peace until the boy died, even if the Heavenly Devil Alliance managed to conquer the universe.

“You dare to be distracted? Die!”

The young man seemed brutal. He quickly grew six extra arms, each with an eye in their palms; it was an ancient body technique. Eight eyes then darted purple light that penetrated You Long’s head

You Long regrew a head on his shoulder the next moment and quickly severed his neck to abandon the flesh set ablaze by the purple flames. His face showed wariness.

The attack had wounded his soul and his body was also weakened.

“Senior brother,” said someone while rushing over.

You Long was stunned. He turned around, only to see Su Ping moving towards him.

“Don’t come over. Find our eldest brother; he can protect you,” said You Long in a hurry.

His opponent was too tricky to deal with; he would be unable to take care of his junior brother.

“I’m here to help you,” said Su Ping. You Long was baffled by the response. He had thought that Su Ping was joking moments before. He didn’t expect Su Ping to repeat the offer. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Is he serious?

“There’s no need…” said You Long after quickly snapping out of his stupor, but the rest was interrupted while he saw a terrifying scene.

Nine Dao Patterns were manifested in Su Ping’s hand and formed a sword, which was used to aggressively slash out and cut apart all laws. It was shockingly powerful.

“You…”

The young man was about to mock Su Ping for technically landing in his palm, but then saw the latter’s attack. His eyeballs almost popped out.

Nine Dao Patterns?

What the hell is this?

Fury and shock made him react. He waved his hands and threw out a painting, from which a flood surged out.

The flood contained Dao Patterns; it was a top defensive treasure. However, the surging flood was cut into halves, and the painting was torn apart.

Su Ping immediately followed with another attack. This time, there were eighteen Dao Patterns, which were gathered into an even more terrifying sword aura.

“What the…”

The young man almost cursed. His only thought was that the ones providing intelligence about their enemies had been messing with him.

Run!

The young man almost stopped resisting. He could fight You Long, but now he had to flee since another man showed up and was as strong as a Heavenly Lord.

After a boom, the two sword auras-one more powerful than the other-caught up to the young man the moment he escaped into another space and time. He quickly turned around to resist, but his secret techniques were directly cut apart; there was a terrifying crack on his chest that was taking a long time to heal.

“What a monster…”

The young man shrieked and ran off even faster.

He had to relay that precious piece of news. The guy who was wanted by Master Ye was definitely pretending. He couldn’t be a Star Lord; he might even be much older than he looked!

Su Ping was about to chase the man, but You Long stopped him and said, “Don’t chase a desperate enemy.”

He looked at his junior brother with a complicated expression. He had heard that Su Ping had killed a Heavenly Lord from the Doom Star Zone, but he didn’t see it with his own eyes. Besides, it was in the eighth space; it could have been a fluke.

Still, Su Ping had just scared off a famous Heavenly Lord with merely two attacks. That was truly shocking.

Even he had yet to grasp eighteen Dao Patterns.

It wasn’t just the number, as he could easily tell that Su Ping was capable of compressing Dao Patterns. Those who were barely acquainted with a certain Dao Glyph could only parse it into hundreds of Dao Patterns, and those patterns would only be a bit more powerful than laws.

But once they were compressed into a dozen, they would be much more destructive.

“Senior brother, are you all right?” Su Ping heaved a sigh, seeing that he had lost the opportunity of killing the guy. It wasn’t a big deal for him, though; he could kill him in their next encounter.

“I’m fine. It’s just a mild injury.”

You Long grinned. He would never admit that he was wounded. It would be too shaming to be Su Ping’s senior brother if he was heavily wounded by the guy scared off by his junior.

“That’s good. Let’s go help our eldest brother,” said Su Ping.

You Long hummed and said, “Okay.”

The man then took out some medicines from his small world and dispelled the foreign Dao Pattern in his body.

“Senior brother, are you truly all right?” asked Su Ping, noticing how the other was taking medication.

You Long replied with an easy smile, “Don’t worry; these are just candies. I would have finished the guy off if you had come a little bit later.”

“Awesome, senior brother,” Su Ping complimented sincerely.

“Of course…”

They soon found Song Yuan in another time and space; he was fighting fiercely against Hai Mei. His triple merging skill had turned him into something akin to an exasperated giant. He could easily destroy a planet, and even twist a solar system.

“Our senior brother is doing well; let’s go help someone else. We’ll only hold him back if we step in.”

You Long flinched after looking for a moment. He was a middling Heavenly Lord, much weaker than his eldest brother. He especially noticed the Dao Patterns used by the two parties, which were much more powerful than those he knew.

“Huh? Okay…”

Su Ping was going to attack, but he paused after hearing You Long’s proposal. “Watch out,” said You Long before Su Ping could continue.

Su Ping also looked at his sides. A few powerful auras appeared and moved towards him.

They were three Ascendants that were even stronger than the woman he had killed.

“Junior brother, they truly think highly of you.” You Long quickly pulled Su Ping aside and unfolded his Ascendant State world to block the attacks. Still, his world was shaking and he was heavily wounded.

“Senior brother…”

Su Ping was going to attack when he was pulled aside. He felt at a loss, even wondering if You Long was actually working for the enemy.

“Die!”

The three enemies simply charged at Su Ping, none wasting time with words, nor bothering to finish off the wounded You Long. The latter was saddened by such development, as he was a Heavenly Lord in his own right. Could he not even compare to his junior brother?

“It couldn’t have been easy for you to become Heavenly Lords. Don’t you cherish your lives?”

Su Ping didn’t retreat. He didn’t try to hide, fearing that You Long would rush to his aid again. He stepped forward and moved to You Long’s front when the latter tried to protect him.

That strange movement baffled that senior brother.

The next moment—he saw a scene that they would never forget.

Brilliant words surfaced in front of his worlds, like blooming lotus flowers, splendid and mysterious. He was stunned by the beautiful scenery.

The abundant aura of a mythical creature was spread out, manifesting a power that belonged to the age of chaos. Dao Patterns dashed out like black dragons.

There were… thirty-eight Dao Patterns in total!

“Burn!” Su Ping coldly whispered and raised his hand.

The Dao Patterns began to interweave and a strange power emerged from the void, burning and collapsing both time and space.

The three Heavenly Lords widened their eyes in shock. The multiple small worlds and the flying Dao Patterns surrounding Su Ping made them wonder if they were hallucinating!

However, an excruciating pain caused by the burning sobered them up. Their protective laws were all melted. They hurriedly unfolded their Ascendant State worlds in an attempt to block Su Ping’s Dao Patterns.

However, the scorching power penetrated their worlds and set them ablaze.

“Is this… Working on the soul?”

“How is it possible? It has bypassed all our laws and Dao Patterns. Our Ascendant worlds are being suppressed by his small worlds…”

They were appalled. Su Ping’s power wouldn’t have worked on them directly unless their worlds were suppressed, and their worlds were of a superior realm. Su Ping’s small worlds, on the other hand, didn’t contain Ascendant power. However, their pressure made them feel as if they were confronting the whole universe…
