Su Ping suddenly felt nervous, like in the first visit ever to a cultivation site. He took a deep breath and stepped into the vortex.

The familiar teleportation feeling lasted a long time. Once he regained his senses, he saw a dazzling light and heard deafening noises.

“This is…”

Su Ping found himself in the middle of a magnificent war. He was as unremarkable as an ant on the battlefield.

The dazzling light was caused by the explosion of countless Great Daos, and the deafening noises were actual universes blowing up.

!!

A terrifying war taking place right before his eyes.

Warships as huge as universes exploded in the void. Even more warships surged out like bees dashing out of a honeycomb.

Myriads of people rose to the sky, letting out roars that could set one’s blood on fire. They marched on.

Dragon roars echoed in the world. They collapsed, wailing and shedding blood. The fire of divine phoenixes illuminated the infinite darkness, and dashed into the sky as dazzling red colors.

In front of the roaring, marching soldiers were figures as great as glittering statues. They had almost the same height, face and aura, as if copied from the same model. They belonged to a species he would never forget.

The Heavens!

Countless members of the Heavens were moving forward like a high wall.

On the other hand, the unknown species, including countless experts, dragons and phoenixes, were crushed by the iron wall. They were like fireflies in front of a bulldozer, leaving blood and shattered Great Daos everywhere.

Su Ping was right at the battlefield’s edge. His cells seemed to have melted by the infinite furious roars around him. The intense hatred and fury in those roars, despite being from another species, touched the feelings in Su Ping’s heart. He could feel their anger and despair!

A thousand, ten thousand, countless dragons flew towards the high wall of Heavens like the sand in a river.

Su Ping could notice their scales as they flew past him. All those dragons were in the Dao Heart State. Some were even Ancestral Gods.

Boom!

Their scorching auras swept over and Su Ping was knocked away. The pain instantly woke him up. He saw that countless experts were charging forth, almost thirty of them being Ancestral Gods, and thousands of Dao Heart experts.

Su Ping looked at the Heavens in the distance and quickly asked, “System, you can resurrect me even if I’m killed by the Heavens, right? Just like before?”

“Yes,” replied the system peacefully.

Su Ping felt relieved. Then, his eyes turned purely black; even the whites were gone. His face was filled with hatred and an immense killing intent.

He roared and his body expanded as he turned into a member of the Primitive Chaos Clan. He stepped out like a hundred-thousand meter tall mythical creature, causing the ground to tremble as he moved. A bloody sword was formed in his hand, made of his blood and the Fire Dao. It could slash an undying universe apart.

“Die!!” Su Ping roared and charged along with the dragons.

The dragon ancestors noticed his presence and looked back at him. They showed surprised when they saw his furious face but none of them stopped him. They could tell that his hatred wasn’t aimed at them, but towards the Heavens further ahead.

None of them ask where he was from or why he was attacking. They had already become comrades, because they had a mutual enemy!

“Roar!!”

The dragon ancestors’ roars echoed in the high sky. A golden light surfaced on their bodies, covering the dragons behind them. The rest of the dragons issued their own roars and their scales shone. It seemed that their bloodlines were resonating at that moment. An enormous, majestic figure appeared: it was a dragon made by the fusion of countless dragons!

The dragon eclipsed the entire world. The universes released by the other experts were incredibly small spheres in comparison to that behemoth.

After a boom, the dragon ancestors sunk their claws on the wall of Heavens. Immediately, tearing three of those humanoids to pieces. Black Dao Glyphs spurted out of their bodies and splashed in the void like worms.

The bodies quickly dried up, but they were soon replaced by three more members of the Heavens who filled the vacancies.

The dragon ancestors roared and waved their claws, crushing many Heavens.

A black circle darted from the rear of the Heavens and swallowed everything, while one of the dragon ancestors was attacking intensely. It looked like a black hole, only ten thousand times more terrifying.

The black circle obliterated everything on its way, until it expanded and caught the dragon ancestor’s neck, pulling it out of the enormous fused dragon.

Without the dragon ancestor’s lead, the dragon fusion instantly started to blur, as if about to disperse.

The dragon ancestor struggled furiously. It tore the black circle on its neck, but that only made the black circle narrower.

It suddenly roared and decisively sliced its own neck!

The dragon preferred to break its own neck than be humiliated!

The missing neck section was slowly regenerated. At a slow pace, but it was happening. However, a black circle appeared along with the flesh and blood.

The dragon ancestor was shocked and furious. It was like an unshakeable curse.

Splash!

A black chain was suddenly connected to the circle, which led to some place further behind. This instantly turned the black circle into a collar that pulled the dragon ancestor toward the wall of the Heavens.

The dragon ancestor roared and struggled hard. It severed its head a second time and simply turned around to fly back.

However, black circles grew out all over its body, and the chain quickly turned into several chains to haul its body.

The dragon ancestor released its universe, which was also wreathed by a black circle.

Its head grew out again, and roared as it was pulled by the black circles.

Boom. The massive creature suddenly detonated its universe. The terrifying power allowed it to spew destroying flames that drowned the Heavens. The flames died out soon after, though. The blackened flesh of the Heavens was quickly healed, too.

The dragon ancestor roared in grief. The dragons behind it also roared, feeling sad and furious.

Bang!

All of a sudden, a sparkling figure flew by and a burning sword fiercely slashed down on the black circles constricting the dragon ancestor, causing infinite sparks.

The dragon ancestor raised its head, only to see a tiny figure trying to cut the chains.

“Damn it!”

Su Ping slashed in a furious frenzy, realizing he was unable to break them. The chains only shook, however. They were extremely hard.

Whoosh!

One of the chains split up and tried to trap him.

Su Ping quickly dodged them. He wore an awful expression. He had used all his strength in his attacks, but he couldn’t damage the black links. Is it an ancestral-level attack?

The dragon raised its head and gazed at Su Ping.

Their eyes met. It was the first time seeing each other, but Su Ping felt an extreme pain. He knew he couldn’t save the great dragon.

“We won’t regret fighting the Heavens, even if we burn away!” said an intimidating and determined voice inside Su Ping’s head. He knew it was a thought coming from the dragon ancestor, conveying its solid determination.

Su Ping’s heart was shaken.

The next moment, he saw that powerful light erupted from the dragon ancestor and a soul flew out, burning in the most dazzling way possible. Its blood, life and its universe were all fully condensed at that moment. It charged at the Heavens with a shocking roar that would last eternally!

The burning dragon soul drowned the wall of the Heavens.

The furious flames burned for a long time without stopping, until a dark fog appeared from a place behind the wall; its highly corrosive nature was actually able to extinguish the flames. Only some empty shells of the Heavens remained in the burnt parts of the wall. However, those shells were soon pulled back.

A new batch of Heavens filled up those spots. There seemed to be an infinite number of them.

Su Ping stared at the scene; however, there was no despair in his eyes. He suddenly turned around and flew back to where the dragons were gathered.

While flying, Su Ping summoned the Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon and his other pets.

Hardly had the Inferno Dragon flown out when it detected its kin nearby. Although there were many types of dragons, their core bloodline was the same.

Su Ping’s dragon was rather surprised, but soon felt the grief and wrath of its brethren. The feeling was hard to describe, but some sort of fire was instantly ignited deep in its heart.

It roared and flew to meet them.

Su Ping moved to a place near the dragons and expanded his Dao Heart, his thoughts spreading toward the dragons. He was trying to sign a contract with them, to gather the enormous dragon figure again. Only this could unite their power!

Otherwise, the Ascendant-level dragons would be squeezed to death before they reachd the front lines.

The dragons instantly roared, feeling Su Ping’s will. Many Dao Heart dragons were resisting.

But the next moment, Su Ping poured his will and fury into his thoughts, letting them know his intentions.

Soon after, all those dragons gathered around Su Ping. They weren’t following him exactly, but the fury and killing intent he had sent out. They all shared the same target, which was the Heavens.

“Die!” Su Ping roared and all the dragons echoed.

The deafening roar was spread all over the battlefield, astonishing many beings on the warships and the Ancestral Gods in the distance.

Su Ping felt that the contract was quickly expanding, like vines in the bodies and souls of the dragons, as they gave their lives to him unconditionally. Their draconic might and their hate towards the Heavens also influenced him through the contract, making him even more furious.

“Since we’re all ready to sacrifice ourselves, we must make them pay a dear price, even if the cost is death!”

Feeling the resolve of those dragons, Su Ping realized why they would fight in a war they could not win. They had to go on and fight, even if they were doomed to failure and destruction!

There was nowhere else to go!

Since they were cornered, they were going to give it all!

The dragon’s dignity stopped them from running for their lives or even keeping seeds of their kind for the future, because even the weakest dragons had their pride and would do anything but abandon their kin!

A golden light surfaced on the dragons and the dragon illusion was condensed once more. Su Ping roared and charged in front of the dragons to clash against the Heavens, with himself spearheading the attack.

The golden illusion that gathered the power of all dragons and Su Ping’s struck the wall of the Heavens.

Su Ping instantly felt overwhelmed by the abundant willpower gathered. It was like hitting into a vast ocean of cotton. Such a magnificent amount of willpower could swallow him easily.

However, he was quick to recover his consciousness; like a sharp needle, he pierced that magnificent willpower. As he looked at the rows of Heavens’ creatures, Su Ping gathered all his blood and aura and swung his sword fiercely.
