Chapter 1408: Executing an Emperor (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Not bad!”

Su Ping sensed the terrifying aura emitted by that guy’s universe. It was solidified to such a degree that he almost became excited; even his blood was flowing faster.

“Die now!” Emperor Que roared and turned into a gray phantom, moving abruptly.

Time was falling and space was being split through the route made by his body, moving at a speed beyond all common sense. It wasn’t a flash move, but a transposition by tapping into the Great Dao.

The Great Dao traversed many different layers, times and spaces. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

!!

Such speed was undetectable if the onlooker didn’t have an equal expertise in the Great Dao. It was one of the reasons why God Emperors could easily crush God Kings.

There was a boom, and Su Ping blocked the punch. Their clash had already broken the shackles of time and space; they disappeared and reappeared in different times and spaces. Only the emperors present could catch sight of them.

All the God Kings were completely confused, losing track of their fight.

“He’s so strong. He truly has the combat ability of a God Emperor!”

Elder Yan and the others watched as Su Ping fought fiercely against Emperor Que. The whole situation left them in shock. Although they had noticed something in the past, they had never confirmed that Su Ping already had a God Emperor’s strength; all changed when they finally witnessed such a life-and-death battle.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Emperor Que roared and moved quickly to attack. The spear he summoned carried the terrifying power of Dao and the attributes of Phaseless Death, destroying the laws that Su Ping was setting up. The latter could only bind those laws with the power of contract; he would have been killed instantly if he only had the normal God King level.

“Damn it, what is that Dao Heart of yours?” Emperor Que felt the strange pulling force in Su Ping’s attacks and was rather angry. His Phaseless Death was completely suppressed and rendered useless.

“The Dao Heart to kill you!”

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. He fought wholeheartedly, enjoying that fierce battle. He felt that his body was gradually waking up; more and more power was being released.

Boom. Su Ping punched and knocked Emperor Que aside, then he roared, “Is this the best you’ve got?!”

The Emperor was incensed. Although most of his clansmen couldn’t see the battle, the emperors and the elders of the Heaven Path Institute could. A God Emperor fighting a junior was unfair to begin with; however, he was still unable to finish off Su Ping quickly.

“Brat, you’re dead!”

Emperor Que gritted his teeth and finally went all out. Blue light surged from his body, along with an elegant and superior aura: it was the Divine Rain Constitution of the Rain Clan.

His body grew significantly as a result, with secret patterns appearing on his skin. He had reincarnated ninety-nine times, sealing his experiences and power of every lifetime on his skin. Each pattern represented a life’s worth of cultivation power. All of them were released at that very moment!

There was a booming sound, and the entire sky shook. The time spanning from the past thousand years and the thousand years to come was shaking too. Some additional information was added to the memories of the Rain Clan; there was something that happened a thousand years prior, but they didn’t know why.

“I’ll show you the real power of an emperor!”

Emperor Que was furious, looking down like a gigantic divinity. His eyes pierced through time and space after converging the power of his ninety-nine secret patterns onto his person. He then slashed with furious abandon.

The Great Dao was pouring like a storm, and an infinitely powerful golden light rushed down.

Su Ping detected a brutal killing intent, and his blood started boiling beyond his control. Inside his blood were countless tiny spheres; each one gathered energy, resembling tiny planets.

“Good one!”

Su Ping gazed at the divine spear, unsure about having the power to block it, but his body was almost boiling. It seemed to be telling him that he longed for such a blast.

He roared and condensed the Contract Dao Heart. All the Great Dao within a hundred years had been marked by his Dao Heart. Such branding allowed him to directly absorb and utilize the Great Dao’s power, which was immediately concentrated on his hand.

In a trance, Su Ping felt as if he were holding a sun about to burst!

The power was so terrifying that it even scared and shocked him.

He had no time to think—he simply swung his sword and counterattacked!

There was a boom, and everything happened instantly. The spear gathered with Emperor Que’s infinite strength collapsed all of a sudden. The seemingly unstoppable and indestructible weapon fell apart like glass crashed into iron!

“This is impossible!”

Emperor Que trembled and lost his cool. His body seemed to have been hammered, and he suddenly felt a wave of helplessness.

The dazzling sword aura struck his head. Before he could react—his body glowed, and a roaring golden dragon charged forth. It was the dragon soul sealed within his armor.

However, the roaring dragon felt desolate the moment it touched the sword aura, as if it were but mere snow, completely unable to stop the sword aura!

Once the golden dragon disappeared, cracks appeared and expanded on Emperor Que’s armor. The armor fell apart in the blink of an eye!

“Oh no!”

The Rain Emperor—who had been observing the battle—quickly changed his expression. He hurriedly tossed a bloody scroll.
