Chapter 1555: Everything Can Be Tamed (3)

“Dao Ancestor!!”

“There’s a chance! There really is a chance!!”

Inside the three thousand warships—the experts of all species had hot tears running down their faces. Even though they had cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years and were exceptionally calm all the time, they couldn’t contain themselves at that moment.

“Go to hell!!”

Su Ping didn’t stop; he turned around and grabbed the dragon head. He could feel Yuan Long’s powerful soul inside, as well as the Chaos Qualification aura.

An idea suddenly occurred to him. Is it possible to bond with the Chaos Qualification?!

Everything could be trained. Everything was alive. In that case, everything could be bound by a contract!

A dazzling light emanated from Su Ping’s eyes as he considered the idea, thinking it was worth a shot to try. There was an extreme risk, because the Chaos Qualification belonged to Yuan Long. Making the attempt was tantamount with clashing head-on with Yuan Long at the soul level!

There was just a moment of hesitation; Su Ping made up his mind and his consciousness simply invaded the dragon head.

He was soon able to sense the chaotic bestowal inside.

His bonding power was spread out within, quickly detecting a ripple of resistance in the depths of that terrifying power.

Su Ping knew it was the consciousness of the Chaos Qualification itself.

However, that consciousness was unlike that of any ordinary life; it was more of a specific signal frequency.

Su Ping had traveled to many worlds and seen all kinds of faces, though, and was ready to accept everything.

He sent out his thoughts and touched the Chaos Qualification with the power of contract.

“What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!!” Yuan Long’s thoughts roared in his mind.

Su Ping felt that his mind was trembling and his body was falling apart.

He gritted his teeth and said, “I want you to die!”

“You think you deserve to lay claim to the Chaos Qualification?!” roared Yuan Long. Su Ping sensed that countless dragons were invading his mind, and biting him in a frenzy. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, roars echoed just then.

The Dark Dragon Hound, the Little Skeleton, the Inferno Dragon and all the other pets jumped into his mind and charged at those dragons ferociously.

“You think you deserve to be the ancestor of all dragons? You should just be the lamb you are and let my boss ride you. That would be the best outcome for you!” shouted the Dark Dragon Hound.

“Wanna hurt my master? Over my dead body!” bellowed the Inferno Dragon.

Without a word, the Little Skeleton summoned ghosts of thousands of warriors to fight the dragons.

Yuan Long was angered to such a degree that he almost broke his neck. This was happening inside his mind, and could directly understand what the pets were saying, which made him even angrier.

“Die! Die!”

Yuan Long attacked crazily. The illusory dragons roared and shattered the silhouettes of the Dark Dragon Hound and the others. However, they were reconstituted swiftly; they could be reborn in Su Ping’s mind as long as they weren’t completely destroyed.

Su Ping resisted the attacks with a gloomy attitude. Alas, he discovered that Yuan Long’s mind was horrifyingly strong, even without the Chaos Qualification. The ghastly soul power was like a heavy planet, while he only had a shovel; it would take forever for him to dig through the planet.

“Guys, I need you to help me block it!” Su Ping relayed with a thought. He couldn’t act on his own at the moment, and could only rely on the power of others.

Upon perceiving the request, the experts of the billions of species acted without hesitation. They simply entered Su Ping’s mind through their bond and fought the illusory dragons.

“Dao Ancestor, leave this task to us!”

“Dao Ancestor, just give us a command!”

Billions of experts flooded the mindspace. Gathered by the power of contract, they almost shared each other’s minds, knowing what everybody was thinking without saying a word.

Su Ping didn’t speak. He could feel their determination, which contained too many things.

He seized the chance to extend the power of contract to the Chaos Qualification, and was soon able to tap into it.

Upon contact, he also sensed the actual will of the Chaos Qualification. Ferocity, wildness, madness, bloodthirst… All kinds of negative emotions consumed him.

That Chaos Qualification was like a maddened dragon; even more short-tempered than Yuan Long.

Su Ping felt that his contract power was like a thin web trying to catch an enormous crocodile struggling hard.

“Be still! Now!!”

Su Ping gritted his teeth. His mind also went a little crazy, as the Chaos Qualification also aimed to seep into him. If this continued, he would become a slave and lose himself.

His eyes were bloodshot as he released the power of contract with full strength. He tried to communicate with the Chaos Qualification and borrow its power, but all that he got was anger and agitation.

The gap in willpower is too great. I can’t subdue it… Su Ping felt sad, and the mood turned into fury, influenced by the Chaos Qualification. He knew he would have to kill Yuan Long first if the power couldn’t be subdued. However, the latter still had the power of the Chaos Qualification and couldn’t be killed; he could barely be defeated.

As such, the quick attack strategy would fail.

I cannot fail… Su Ping was so exasperated he was on the verge of losing control.

At that moment, Su Ping suddenly heard the Little Skeleton’s voice.

“Master!

“Master, calm down. You can do this!” said the Little Skeleton.

“That’s right. Boss, you can do this. You once defeated a Celestial beast when you were only an Ascendant!”

“Master, I believe in you! You can do this!” said the Inferno Dragon.

“Master…”

“Master…”

The voices of the Purple Python and the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon were heard, and with them came their faith.

It was like having your head doused with cold water. Su Ping was instantly woken up, although he felt dazed for a moment. He didn’t know how they managed to break Yuan Long’s shackles, but they reminded him of many, many things.

Compared to other Undying State beings, he had only cultivated for 10,000 years.

However, he had experienced many things during that time span. He met a lot of people and tamed lots of pets.

Some of the pets he tamed were ill-tempered; others were timid, vigilant, and some of them were cunning.

Aside from being a warrior, he was also the best pet trainer there was!

Su Ping took a deep breath and calmed down, dispelling the killing intent and agitation in his heart. He transmitted his will and the contract power with a relaxed attitude.

The system never told me how the Chaos Qualification came to be, I suppose it used to be part of the system… Su Ping’s eyes glittered. His aura and appearance quickly changed.

Very soon, while harnessing the will of the contract bond, he transformed to resemble the Mother of Chaos.

He had spent a long time interacting with the system. Besides, Su Ping was still the system’s host and could precisely simulate the system’s aura.

“You…”

Yuan Long trembled. Deep inside his skull—he could feel an aura he couldn’t be more familiar with.

However, he soon realized that the aura wasn’t real and the Mother of Chaos wasn’t truly there.

He would have no choice but to escape if that were true.
