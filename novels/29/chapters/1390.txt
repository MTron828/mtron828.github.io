Chapter 1392: Cultivation (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Shen Huang’s words struck them like a heavy hammer and woke them up.

Indeed. We are Celestial State cultivators, existences above billions of people. How could we be frustrated?

“That’s right. No matter what happens in the future, we have to try our best and fight!” said a Celestial with aggressive eyes. He remembered the soldiers who had voluntarily sacrificed themselves. They had not been instructed to do that, and yet they did so, knowing they would die!

Even though their levels were low, they were a solid foundation for humanity!

“I’ll go and cultivate. Mr. Su, please take care of the steering,” said a Celestial in a polite and respectful tone. Although Su Ping had a history with them, they were on the same boat and were the last of mankind. They had also received a lot of Su Ping’s favors; their grudges had already been erased.

!!

“Sure.” Su Ping nodded slightly.

The other Celestials also said their goodbyes and left the store to find a place to settle down on the planet Su Ping had built for the store.

The planet was enshrouded by Su Ping’s barrier, and was as inconspicuous as a grain of dust. It could resist the corruption of many powers moving in the void.

“Xiao Su, call me if you need anything,” Shen Huang said to Su Ping.

“Okay.”

“Brother Su, I’ll seek you if I have any questions.” Chi Huo chuckled.

“Okay.”

The store was instantly less crowded after they left. Only Su Ping, Joanna, Tang Ruyan and Green Lady were left.

Once the others were gone, Green Lady mumbled in disappointment, “I never thought I would see that the universe protected by the Deity King would be conquered in the end.”

Su Ping immediately remembered the Twilight Deity King who had blocked the hole with his body, back in the ruins. He asked, “Have you met the Heavens too?”

Green Lady said gloomily, “The Deity King died in the catastrophe. That war was called the War Against the Heavens. All deities were fighting against the Heavenly Dao; it was said that the Heavenly Dao was corrupted and that it wanted to slaughter all deities.”

“The War Against the Heavens…”

Su Ping asked solemnly, “So, all the deities were destroyed by the Heavens too? What happened that caused the corruption of the Heavenly Dao?”

Green Lady heaved a sigh and said, “According to the sutras of the Deity Emperors, the world is dominated by the Heavenly Tribulation, which controls everything. Mortals have to be acknowledged by the Heavenly Dao and transcend the lightning sent by the Heavenly Tribulation in order to become deities.

“However, the Heavenly Dao was eventually corrupted and there was a period when it blatantly dealt lightning attacks. Even mortals could trigger them when they weren’t breaking through. Some who had to go through the tribulation actually experienced lightning attacks that were far more powerful than what their level required.

“In addition, all laws were in chaos and there were disasters everywhere. Someone said that the Heavenly Dao was abnormal, and later a Deity Emperor said that the Heavenly Dao was corrupted, which seemed to be because it had absorbed too much negative emotions from the world.”

Su Ping then slightly raised his eyebrows. It seemed that the Heavenly Dao was recorded in a different way in every age; after all, each had their own culture and understanding. The Heavens were collectively called Heavenly Dao, like mortals saw experts like God.

“I don’t think the Heavenly Dao was corrupted.”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “The Heavens have committed countless slaughters since ancient times. As to the situation you mentioned, I think it was only because the Heavens encountered something and weren’t able to completely control your era.”

Feeling Dazed, Green Lady asked, “Are you saying that existences from other universes were distracting the Heavenly Dao?”

“More or less,” said Su Ping, “However, since the Heavenly Dao was so worshiped in your era, it means that it could have arrived at any moment. So, our universe was actually found by the Heavens a long time ago, but they later abandoned it after eliminating your people…”

He remembered the corpse’s universe he had just left. Maybe, it wouldn’t catch the attention of the Heavens again; that is, until new lives and civilizations were born.

However, what Su Ping found odd was that the Heavens could have destroyed the entire world and even the entire universe after killing the deities in Green Lady’s era, if their true goal was to eliminate all lives.

As long as they were willing, not just the Heavens, even a Celestial expert could have laid waste to a universe and rendered it sterile, ensuring that no lives would ever be born again.

Did some expert survive from that era, or did the Heavens not really choose to transform the universe into a land of desolation? Did they only slaughter the deities and spared the universe from becoming a hopeless land?

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. It would be great if it were the first possibility. The Heavens’ purpose would be rather perplexing if it was the second one. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The twelve Sorcerer Ancestors fought the Heavens for unknown reasons, back in the age of chaos. The Golden Crow ancestor never elaborated on the subject. Was it because they were afraid of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors’ power? If that were the case, there would be no trouble, as soon as they slaughtered all lives. That’s the first guess…” Su Ping mumbled to himself.

He shook his head a moment later. He didn’t think he could find the answer, and the answer itself wasn’t that important in itself. In any case, the Heavens were the enemy, especially after causing so much bloodshed. He had to avenge the fallen humans with blood!

“I need to digest the power I just received. Anna, don’t be influenced by what happened and continue doing business. Try to promote the professional training service; we need to make more money,” said Su Ping.
