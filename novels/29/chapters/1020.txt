Chapter 1023: The Seventh Astral Painting

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Loulan Feng found it hard to believe.

Su Ping was only in the Star State, and yet his willpower was four times as much as Loulan Lin’s?

It had to be noted that Loulan Lin herself was an extraordinary Star Lord who was on the Divine Lord Rank. She was a monster compared to regular Star Lords!

She had been polished and strengthened in all aspects thanks to the family investment of countless rare resources and the improvement of special training techniques, including acquisition of pets, secret techniques and mental power development.

Thanks to all this nurturing and her own great gifts, she was finally able to reach 30th place in the Divine Lord Rank.

As for the monsters further above her, they either had top constitutions or even more unbelievable talents. But all in all, the gap between them wasn’t too far apart!

Su Ping on the other hand, was only a Star State warrior, and yet his willpower was four times stronger than Loulan Lin’s!

The most horrifying thing was that Su Ping’s willpower was almost reaching the readings of an Ascendant!

The minimal willpower reading for an Ascendant was 50,000 points. Su Ping was already approaching it!

“No wonder so many Star Lords went missing in the Sea of Illusions and only he returned. It wasn’t just Lord Supreme’s treasures, his own potential also had something to do with it…”

Loulan Feng was shocked and suspicious. He suddenly realized why You Long thought so highly of his junior brother!

In his current phase, Su Ping’s performance was already better than many Celestials’ exploits from the times when they were young!

“Is there something wrong with the equipment?” asked a scientist, feeling at a loss. He became suspicious of the equipment’s performance, even though the whole team knew it had never been wrong. Furthermore, they had been doing regular maintenance.

Loulan Feng didn’t say anything. His eyes glittered, and he arranged another test run for Su Ping.

Soon, the reading was out again. It was still around 36,000.

Loulan Feng suddenly took action after the test ended, infusing divine power into the equipment. Soon, the priceless equipment exploded.

“Something must be wrong with the equipment,” said Loulan Feng in a low voice, “Write a report and apply for a new one. Mr. Su, let’s go back.”

All the scientists were taken aback by the explosion. Their faces became pale when they heard what Loulan Feng said, as they would be investigated and held responsible if something was wrong with the equipment.

Loulan Feng had already taken Su Ping away from the place moments after.

“Mr. Su, this is about your own information; I must keep it a secret for now. I can have them test you again with a new equipment set if you want to publicize it,” Loulan Feng said to Su Ping on the way.

Su Ping realized that the man destroyed the equipment to prevent others from plotting against him after learning the information.

“Thanks.” Su Ping nodded. “I don’t need to publicize it. I’m not short of fame as it is.”

Loulan Feng felt relieved. He nodded and said, “Very few people are as gifted as you, Mr. Su. Fame is a burden for you right now. I’m sure that your story will become a legend of the Federation when you rise to the Ascendant State!”

Su Ping had been invited to the Loulan family by him, so he sincerely hoped that the young man could grow up safely and rise to the Ascendant State sooner.

“Sure.”

Su Ping didn’t know how to respond to such a compliment, so he didn’t say anything.

He too wanted to rise to the Ascendant State.

If he did, he would be able to peer into the secrets of the universe.

In particular, after seeing many other worlds, Su Ping was eager to ascertain the Federation’s position in the universe. Were the top cultivation sites beyond the universe?

…

Soon, they reached the Loulans’ holy cultivation land.

There were a lot fewer descendants of the Loulan family. The accident in the Sea of Illusions killed a lot of promising talents. It was a huge loss.

Su Ping’s arrival attracted the attention of many of the Loulans’ descendants.

They paid a lot of attention to the top genius who had returned from the Sea of Illusions, and were quite curious about him.

Su Ping went straight to the best seat. He bid goodbye to Loulan Feng and started training in seclusion.

Loulan Feng watched Su Ping disappear as the protective barriers were being set. He immediately asked Director Yu to take care of Su Ping.

“I’m right outside of the mountain. Why do you need me to be so close to him?” Director Yu, who had just arrived, was puzzled.

Loulan Feng didn’t explain. He said, “Mr. Su has just returned from the Sea of Illusions and he pissed off some Ascendants of other star zones. Also, he has a sensitive identity. We would be to blame if other families send anyone to assassinate him. So, please take care of him and don’t wander too far.”

Director Yu was rather puzzled. “Aren’t we being overly prudent? Who would dare to kill anyone here? Who would have such a death wish?”

Loulan Feng slightly shook his head, not bothering to reply. He turned around and left for their headquarters, ready to report the intelligence they had gathered about Su Ping.

Only the Loulans were in control of privileged information for the moment.

Inside the barriers—

Su Ping was completely devoted to cultivation after establishing the barriers.

Intense astral power was being concentrated by the astray array underneath his feet. The barriers around him were similarly absorbing astral dust in the sky and transforming it into pure astral power. Su Ping’s cultivation would rise while being seated inside the astral array, even if he wasn’t cultivating purposefully.

One star after the other was being gathered inside Su Ping’s body.

More and more stars were gathered as time went by. In the blink of an eye, there were already sixty-three of them!

“Gather!”

Su Ping controlled all the stars, making them dance and rearrange according to the seventh Astral Painting of the Chaos Star Chart.

The stars were sent to the openings in the Astral Painting, making it glow even more.

The astral dust was made of deity aura, which felt distant and unpredictable; it seemed to be half real and half illusory.

The last star was fitted in—a brilliant Astral Painting glittered, and the stars flashed as a whole. There were only sixty-three stars, and yet they seemed to have illuminated the entire world!

The momentary picture struck Su Ping, whose head felt dizzy and chaotic.

While he was immersed in such a strange status, he seemed able to see the river of life, the rise and fall of the universe, and the circulation of stars. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The sixty-three stars seemed to have multiplied and turned into billions that dotted the Astral Painting. Each star contained a strong life aura; they were like planets filled with lives.

The lives were glittering!

Su Ping was in a trance. None of his actions were deliberate at that point. Still, many vitality laws surged in his head. Those laws gathered and combined with the law of vitality he knew, bringing about an epiphany.

“Lives take root in hard stones.

“Lives reincarnate from dry bones.

“Lives are reversals and adaptations!”

Su Ping’s consciousness was devoted to a strange world where flowers were blossoming on vast meadows and bones were heaped on high mountains. However, the path of vitality circulated among all those things.

“So, life is not defined from the perspective of humankind.

“A stone has its own life too.

“Even if it’s shattered into a billion pieces, each piece is still an independent life.

“It’s reproduction and separation…

A long while later—

Su Ping’s consciousness returned to his body; the barriers formed with intense astral power appeared before his eyes. The law of vitality that Shen Huang had taught him was only rudimentary, to be used as a lifesaving method. However, Su Ping had almost mastered the law of vitality in full thanks to the seventh Astral Painting.

“Astral power, separation, birth!”

Su Ping raised his hand, and there was suddenly twice as much astral power inside the barriers; the pure energy was reproducing constantly under the control of the vitality law. Reproduction was only one of the many abstruse features of this law.

The astral power remained as effective as before; therefore, Su Ping’s absorption efficiency was doubled.

Su Ping continued reproducing astral power with the law of vitality. He only started feeling worn out until there were four times as much astral power.

So, manipulating energy is easy and costless. All I need to do is to master the corresponding law…

He was surprised by the law of vitality’s power. Not even Ascendants State experts could change the energy density in the environment without a cost; they had to do that through astral arrays or their own energy. However, he was reproducing energy with the law without being strongly affected by the process.

The only thing of note was that using the law was rather exhausting; he would feel tired if he did it for a long time.

Su Ping summoned his small world, which was compressed to a one meter radius around himself. The desolate views from that world were minimized.

While examining the small world with his mind, Su Ping immediately realized that it was a lot vaster, ready to accommodate much more energy.

Is this the limit of my small world??Su Ping tried to concentrate the power of his small world on his arm, instantly seeing that the space before his arm was collapsing. It could not bear the power of his small world!

The mere concentration of his power had already shattered the primary space!

Su Ping stopped trying, fearing that the energy would leak out and alert the people of the Loulan family.

Vitality, destruction, chaos and time… I’ve fully mastered the four supreme laws and perfected the first small world! Now, I can finally try to condense a second small world…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. The small world around him vanished, and he focused his attention on his body; it required new strength to establish a second small world.

The first small world was based on the four supreme laws.

The second small world could be absorbed by the first if it was constructed by normal laws, which would be pointless.

While the law of illusion is a law, it is unlike normal laws, founded on mental power…

Su Ping remembered how he condensed the first small world. Very soon, he concentrated his willpower and tried to establish a new small world with the law of illusion.

His deity aura was exhausted at a very fast pace during the world establishment. Meanwhile, Su Ping felt as if his small world was about to be torn apart.

This won’t do. The four supreme laws in my first small world are suppressing the second small world. They’ll only neutralize each other in the end.

Su Ping gradually slowed down and frowned after lots of effort. He felt it was correct to build a second small world with the law of illusion, but turning the idea into reality was rather hard.

The traits related to the law of illusion are enough to build a small world. Unfortunately, my first small world is too solid and is suppressing it.

The small world made with the law of illusion is in fact illusory; it shouldn’t conflict with the first small world. However…

Su Ping closed his eyes and kept trying.

All of a sudden, Su Ping vomited a mouthful of blood. His first small world, which had just been perfected, almost trembled and collapsed. Su Ping was too scared to try again.

“I’m going to try again in the cultivation sites after I return to my store. I should also visit the Heaven Path Institute and see what I can learn.”

Su Ping abandoned the idea of condensing a second small world in this place. Although he believed that the idea was feasible, there were still a lot of details that he needed to work on.

Su Ping concealed his aura and began to heal his wounds.

…

Inside the dark universe—

At the edge of a certain galaxy, a spaceship flew closer and eventually stopped on a desolate planet.

“The Loulans’ territory is right ahead of us. They have a lot of scouts and sentries; we’ll just wait for him to come out.”

Inside the spaceship’s main cabin—seven people were seated at a long table. Some were playing with their pets, some were polishing their nails, and others were sitting solemnly.

Among them, the young man playing with his pet had dyed his hair in multiple colors. There was also a crystal adornment at the corner of his eye. “He’s only in the Star State, yet the boss sent all six of us, and even the seniors on the Divine Lord Rank to deal with him. Isn’t it too much?”

“Indeed. He’s not protected by Ascendant anyway; I should be enough to kill such a kid,” said a man who wore a smiling mask in a low voice.

“You’d better drop that thought,” remarked a young man who had only one gigantic eye in the middle of his forehead, which emitted purple light. He belonged to the minority races in the universe; his people were very good at charm skills. They had the highest percentage of assassins among all clans.

“Although he’s only in the Star State, he’s already capable of challenging the top ten of the Divine Lord Rank. He also received the Prime Sky Mirror and an unknown number of treasures from Lord Supreme. He’s as good at saving his life as any Ascendant is. The organization appointed Senior Yin Xing to come with us, just to be safe!”

The one-eyed young man looked at the guy who stood in front of them while showing his back in their direction..
