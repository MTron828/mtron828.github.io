Chapter 1491 Ancestor Su (2)

Su Ping was soon able to find a suitable location in the wilderness, and instantly made construction plans. Right then, a voice sounded. “Please wait a moment.”

A shadow appeared in the world. It was invisible to emperor-level beings, but Su Ping could see him clearly. It was a young man wearing a black robe, with a purple vertical eye on his forehead. The fellow walked in a relaxed manner, but his every step seemed to be echoing with the world in a strange rhythm. It seemed that the world was shaking because of his feet.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. “Who are you?”

“I just heard the Grand Emperor Divine Bell and you don’t look familiar. You must be the new Ancestral God, right?” said the black-robed young man with a smile, “If you’re looking for a territory, I suggest you go somewhere else; this place belongs to the Bright Moon Clan.”

!!

“The Bright Moon Clan?” Su Ping raised his brows and asked, “It’s not one of the Seven Greatest Clans, is it?”

The young man’s smile fell. “What do you mean?”

“If you’re not one of them, don’t meddle in other people’s business,” said Su Ping with an unwelcoming expression, “We’ll only be using this continent. We won’t be stepping on your territory.”

Creation was an easy task for him.

He could instantly create a small universe.

In order to create a territory for humankind, he only needed to gather a huge amount of land and create mountains and rivers. It would be an additional piece of territory at the edge of the main landmass. It wouldn’t affect any previous arrangement, as the continent would be enlarged.

“I know, but this is the Bright Moon Clan’s territory, and we don’t like noisy neighbors. You’d better find somewhere else,” said the black-robed young man coldly, discarding all niceties.

Su Ping snorted. “Better move elsewhere if you don’t like neighbors. Humans are getting this place!”

“Why don’t you try?” said the black-robed young man coldly, “Besides, you must have the Seven Clans’ permission to establish a territory. Did nobody tell you the rules after you became an Ancestral God?”

“As far as I know, any high-ranked clan is free to settle down in a place they like. Being Ancestral Gods, if they can’t freely pick a land for their clans, what’s the point of being an Ancestral God?”

Su Ping looked at him coldly and added, “I don’t have time to waste on you. You can either move away or shut up!”

“How arrogant!”

The black-robed young man laughed because of fury. The purple eye on his forehead cracked open, with chaotic light flashing. A moment later, an expression of understanding appeared on his face. He said, “So, you’re related to the Heaven Path Institute. Did you rise there? This is indeed close to the institute, but it’s useless. You can’t settle down here, even if all four Ancestral Gods come!”

“I don’t need the other three Ancestral Gods to deal with you.”

Su Ping attacked just like that. He suddenly bellowed and the universe of fire appeared behind his back, then instantly turned into a ten-thousand meter tall giant. He stepped on the land, and chaos blood erupted from his pores to gather into a sword.

With a boom, the universe exploded and violent power surged as a sword aura.

“Condense!”

The black-robed young man sneered as the purple eye on his forehead was opened. There was the aura of a universe inside the purple eye, as if all the power was condensed there.

Boom. The purple light passed, piercing the sword aura.

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. He quickly set up a contract, invoking the power within a radius of 500,000 kilometers. The original power of the world was instantly gathered in his arm.

His other hand detonated his just reconstituted universe. He grabbed the sword with both hands and slashed furiously again.

The world was a mess and the continent was shaking. Time and space within ten thousand kilometers fell apart. Such an unusual phenomenon caused the spatial outer layer to shatter.

The black-robed young man changed his expression and looked at Su Ping in shock. He suddenly extended a hand, and a purple universe slowly rose behind him, exploding right after. The vertical eye on his forehead exploded at the same time. The two streams of terrifying power collided and turned into a purple burst of light.

The purple light and the sword aura collided, annihilating everything.

The horrifying impact was almost soundless. The sword aura continued and sliced through the purple light and reached the young man’s chest, obliterating his body.

Once the attack auras receded, there was a deep ravine a million kilometers long, spanning the continent’s area behind the black-robed young man’s back. All the cities, beasts and villages in that path were destroyed.

Ancestral God battles were world-destroying. It was inevitable.

In the void—the black-robed young man’s body was reconstituted, along with the purple light. It was his purple undying universe.

“The Chaos Clan?”

The young looking ancestor was giving Su Ping a sullen look. He didn’t die, but he failed! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was a known fact that Ancestral Gods could hardly kill each other, unless the most terrifying among them would gather to attack. There was only victory and defeat under normal circumstances.

He didn’t expect to be defeated by a new Ancestral God.

The power condensed by Su Ping had even scared him. He didn’t know what kind of method it was.

“You can leave on your feet, or on your back!” Su Ping offered with a cold tone.

The black-robed young man’s eyes also turned cold. “You can’t kill me. Spare me the arrogant act!”

“You’re just a loser!”

“You!”

The young man was infuriated, but facts were facts. He didn’t think he could block the attack, even if he had a second try at it. He would fail, no matter how many times he tried.

He didn’t die, but failure was embarrassing!

It would be humiliating if word got out!

“No matter what, you cannot take this place as long as I’m here,” said the young man angrily.

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. “Do you want me to destroy your clan?”

“Destroy my clan, and I’ll destroy yours!” said the unrelenting fellow.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and stared at the guy for a while. He nodded and said, “I’ll remember what happened today.”

“Humph!”

The black-robed young man snorted, not taking Su Ping’s threat seriously.

Both of them were Ancestral Gods. Su Ping had indeed defeated him, but he couldn’t kill him. Threats were pointless.

Not wasting any more time talking, Su Ping left the Original Dao World and returned to the Heaven Path Institute.

“Ancestor Su?”

Emperor Xin and the others saw that Su Ping’s expression was off. They had also heard a great noise, which made them a bit nervous.

The Chief Elder thought of something and asked, “Did you meet Ancestral God Hao Yue, Human Ancestor?”

“Do you know him?” Su Ping looked at the Chief Elder.

“The Bright Moon Clan members have a strange temper and are difficult to communicate with. They also love to live alone. Only their Ancestral God would approach you to stir a conflict,” said the Chief Elder with a bitter smile.

Su Ping nodded. “The place I picked is near their territory. He doesn’t want me to use that

area.”

Just as I thought… the Chief Elder pondered. He said with a bitter smile, “The Bright Moon Clan has always been this petty. Don’t be too hard on them.”

Su Ping shook his head but dropped the subject. He couldn’t do anything to that guy yet, and could only hold back for the sake of all humans. After all, he would mostly be away, and would have no chance to help if humans were attacked.

It was impossible to ask the Chaos Perception Dragon for help, either.

Being a ferocious beast, it would be seen as a public enemy of all gods once it stepped on that continent.

I’ll teach him a lesson when the Dark Dragon Hound and my other pets also become Ancestral Gods… Su Ping’s eyes were slightly cold. He said to Emperor Xin and the others, “I’m afraid you’ll have to stay where you are for a while. You can start packing for the time being. I will establish our territory in that place when I get back.”

“Ancestor Su, if the Bright Moon Clan is difficult to deal with, we can think about picking another place,” offered Emperor Xin after seeing Su Ping’s expression.

The latter shook his head. “I won’t change the place that I’ve picked.”
