Chapter 1372 The Fire Seed Plan (1)

“Those ancient corpses from the deeper spaces seem to be helping us,” said one of the Celestials, feeling shock and suspicion.

“Why are they helping us?”

“I once saw a similar scene in the deeper spaces years ago. Some ancient corpse was still moving, even though it was long dead. It was fighting some beast.”

“I’ve also heard of such incidents. The universe is so vast; there are too many secrets we can’t unravel yet.”

All the Celestials looked solemn. The ghastly corpses, for whatever reason, were fighting the alien, which was in their best interest.

“Do you think it’s because of some legacies remaining inside those corpses?” someone asked all of a sudden. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The thought left them in a daze; their expressions changed a bit. Those ancient corpses, being able to stand their ground against the alien, were probably universe dominators in the past. The legacy in the ancient corpse that appeared in the Mayhem Star Zone was acquired by the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin, and was very likely a universe dominator’s legacy. It was very likely that they could achieve a breakthrough if they could obtain those legacies.

None of them had dared to visit the Mayhem Star Zone because they feared being affected by the reigning laws and surrounded by other forces, if not killed. Noticing the glint in their eyes, Su Ping said gloomily, “They’re trying to buy time for us. If they can’t stop the aliens, there’s no way our defense lines can. There must be a reason why the alien dared to show up; do you have any place to run to?”

Everyone snapped out of their daydreaming after hearing what Su Ping said.

It wasn’t the time for finding legacies. Besides, there wasn’t even a chance for them to fight over them.

The arrival of those ancient corpses was their last chance. The consequences would be dire if they failed to block the enemy.

“There’s nowhere to go. We have yet to find where the Planet of Origin was spirited off to…” Shen Huang was grave. When they set up the alliance, they were ready for a life-and-death battle, but none of them expected it to happen that fast. They thought the war would last a thousand years, but something unexpected took place in a few years’ time.

The atmosphere in the conference room became heavy. Nobody looked good.

......

One of the Celestial State experts broke the silence. “Should we prepare a batch of seeds?”

Shen Huang glanced at him and the others, before he slowly said, “It’s time we initiate the Fire Seed Plan that we’ve talked about. This is our last endeavor.”

Then, he looked at Su Ping and said, “Xiao Su, in the unfortunate chance that we fail, I hope that you’ll take with you some seeds and help them survive in the universe, to prevent the extermination of humanity.”

Su Ping was stunned; he was never involved in that plan. He asked, “You want me to escape?”

“Not escape, but escort,” Chi Huo corrected Su Ping and said, “The Fire Seed Plan that we came up with was for the worst-case scenario. We’ll pick twelve batches of seeds and send them to twelve desolate places of the universe where they can reestablish order. There won’t be that many of them, to avoid catching attention. The seeds of the Golden Star Zone will be taken care of by you; they’re also the most likely batch to survive.”

Su Ping slightly changed his expression. He didn’t realize that those people had already made arrangements for him.

“I disagree,” said Su Ping.

Shen Huang looked at Su Ping with a solemn expression. “Xiao Su, don’t be sentimental. You’re not a deserter.. Someone must take care of the others in such perilous times. Your mission is harder than ours!”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “Master, It’s not me acting tough, and I don’t care what other people say! If we’re truly defeated, I will escape with the seeds you’ve arranged at the last moment, even if I’m called a deserter. However, the time has not come yet. I hope that I can fight until the last moment with you before we escape!”

All the experts were stunned. For a moment they looked at Su Ping in a different light; they seemed to respect and acknowledge him.

The Celestials from the other star zones in particular; they saw the strong yet arrogant youngster in a completely different way. So, the man is not just capable of suppressing others with strength. He also has a respectable heart!

Shen Huang said with comfort in his eyes. “I’m glad you understand.”

“The ancient corpses are fighting the alien. Should we help them?” asked one of the Celestials.

“Can we intervene?” Another Celestial State expert was concerned about their strength. That was a battle between universe dominators. They could easily get killed if they got involved.

Xu Kong said, “Maybe, we need to try using the mid-sized Titan Divine Array.”

Someone shook his head and replied, “That one requires thirty-six Celestials to work. There aren’t that many of us.”

“There are probably enough if we take your pets into account,” said Xu Kong.

Everybody was stunned for a moment. They had the idea in the past. However, someone had done calculations and found that there weren’t enough Celestials.

Noticing that Xu Kong was looking at him, Su Ping realized what she was thinking. He nodded and said, “It’s feasible. We can help the ancient corpses beat the alien with the power of the mid-sized Titan Divine Array.”

“We and our pets are twenty-eight Celestials in total. How many do you have, Mr. Su?” a Celestial expert asked.

“Twenty-eight…”

Su Ping calculated for a moment and said, “Close enough. Let’s hurry and start practicing.”

Everybody was astonished, not expecting that he would truly be able to provide eight more Celestials.
