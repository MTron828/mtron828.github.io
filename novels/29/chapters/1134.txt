Chapter 1135 The Path Seeking Pill

“Not that I know of.”

The old man shook his head. As if realizing Su Ping’s concerns, he said, “Young man, I wouldn’t demean myself by tricking you. Besides, you did Golden Lotus a favor. I won’t hurt you; you will only benefit from this.”

“That’s right. I trust Senior Dark Demon,” said Golden Lotus quickly.

Su Ping couldn’t help but glance at her, and felt like rolling his eyes.

That innocent girl probably wouldn’t even realize it if anyone sold her for money.

“Senior Cauldron...”

“Don’t ask me; I don’t know. But I think he’s right in saying it’s the only method. As for the side effects, humph, I only believe half of what he says anyway,” said the cauldron woman with a snort.

Hearing the anger in her words, Su Ping wore a bitter smile and said to the old man, “What’s your method, senior?”

“Like I said, it’s the most wondrous thing for you; others can’t have it even if they wanted to. This cauldron surely knows; it’s the king-level Path Seeking Pill!” said the old man slowly.

The cauldron woman’s expression changed a bit and and gazed at him. “You have such a

pill?”

“Not just the pill, I even have its recipe. The old monster was just mediocre at the beginning; he couldn’t have become a Deity King without me. He learned everything from

me!”

The old man spoke proudly, but then had a forlorn face. “Unfortunately for me, he learned everything except how to be a decent human being; it’s my fault that he transformed from an innocent young man into an unparalleled demon.”

“I’m glad you acknowledged it.” The woman sneered.

The old man ignored her and said to Su Ping, “This Path Seeking Pill allows you to feel the power of other levels; it’s a king-level pill that will give you the power and aura of a Deity King. Unfortunately, the effect will expire in three days.

“We must distance ourselves from the other Deity Kings in three days, or we’ll be exposed.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Su Ping was astonished. He couldn’t help but ask the system.

The system soon replied; the pill was also pet food, but it was of a high level and its details were unknown; that is, unless the advanced edition of the pet food encyclopedia was paid for.

“Another million energy points?”

“That is correct,” replied the system quickly.

Even though Su Ping felt he was being ripped off, he paid for it anyway.

He blamed himself for not getting in touch with the fancy foods sooner; he then planned to exchange for all the encyclopedias available after he returned to his store.

“Your store must first be improved to level 7 if you want to exchange for the top encyclopedias,” reminded the system.

Su Ping was lost for words. The system loved peeping into his mind, just like usual.

He stopped pondering over the matter. The information on the Path Seeking Pill popped up in his head after the exchange. The book was written in the age of deities and gods. There were emperor-level and even heaven-level pills!

Nobody had been able to create a Path Seeking Pill beyond the heaven level just yet.

Its effect is exactly the same as described by the sutra. He’s not lying to me. Su Ping was slightly reassured after reading it.

There wouldn’t be any side effects if he ate the pill while in the Ascendant State; he would benefit from it profoundly.

Alas, his level was too low; accidents could happen if he swallowed the pill. He might even lose his consciousness; if nothing untoward happened, all his power would be exhausted and he would become an ordinary person.

“Aside from the pill, I will teach you a technique named Thousand Illusions.

“Once you cultivate it, you’ll be able to simulate the aura of any person in your level. If you grasp it fully, you can even simulate the aura of a level higher than yours, but the highest you can emulate is the emperor level.”

The old man added, “Once you combine the technique and the Path Seeking Pill, you should be able to fool them if they don’t examine you thoroughly. Since you’ll be next to your master, I don’t think he’ll blatantly examine you. The other Deity Kings wouldn’t dare to insult you either if they know that you’ve inherited the legacy.”

The old man understood other people’s tendencies very well.

Su Ping gave a slight nod after hearing that. What he said was true. “There’s no time to lose; let’s get started since you’re on board.” The old man flipped his hand, and a black box appeared. He then removed the seal on the box; there was a crystal pill inside, which emitted an alluring fragrance.

“It was a king-level pill, but it couldn’t withstand the infinite loneliness and chose to extinguish its consciousness. What a shame.” The old man looked at the pill and heaved a sigh.

The woman raised her eyebrows. “Even if it hadn’t extinguished its consciousness, wouldn’t it still die if you feed it to someone else? Spare us the pretense!”

The old man shook his head. “If it’s conscious, then there’s no need to consume it; the pill can give this young man the same effect if it’s willing to help, although the effect would expire sooner.”

The cauldron woman snorted, but didn’t say anything The old man gave him the pill, and then pointed at Su Ping’s forehead; a technique was then instantly transmitted into his head.

“You’ve already picked up the technique thanks to my direct transmission, but you have to break the last bottleneck on your own if you want to reach the peak,” said the old man.

Su Ping instantly detected that a huge amount of information was spreading out in his head. It took a long while for Su Ping to finally realize he had basically grasped the technique, just as if he would have practiced it for years.

“Thank you, sir,” said Su Ping and accepted the pill, confirming that it was indeed the Path Seeking Pill.

He swallowed the pill without hesitation.

A cool and smooth feeling spread across his body as the pill entered his mouth. Then, Su Ping felt that a stream of power was permeating his every cell.

His body had already been full of energy; however, at the moment he was like a land overtaken by drought for years and finally embracing rain. A power he had never detected or experienced surged out of his cells and the bottom of his heart.

Su Ping’s consciousness was humming; he felt that his body was transcending.

His aura seemed to be expanding quickly. However, the rapid growth didn’t make him feel the least bit uncomfortable; he couldn’t have felt more exhilarated.

He soon approached the Ascendant State. In his head—the triple small worlds were condensed into a Divine Mark, which contained infinite power in the form of small worlds’ illusions.

After that, the Divine Mark quickly turned into a magnificent sphere that was like the universe itself.

Su Ping somehow felt like he had seen a similar view in the past.

It was like a super strengthened small world.

I have to condense a Divine Mark to reach the Ascendant State. Once I attain the Celestial State—the Divine Mark will evolve into a real world, or even... a small universe! Su Ping was enlightened as he felt the changes inside his body.

The pill had walked him through the process of rising to the Celestial State in something like a dream state.

Naturally, it was highly beneficial for him.

Even though he had fought Deity Kings in cultivation sites a million times, every outcome had been instant death; he could only experience how strong they were as an observer, but now he could do it in person.

No wonder the pet food encyclopedia described the pill as an extremely rare and precious pill for cultivation.

However, the pill had a minor flaw.

This shortcoming was nothing in the eyes of others; it was the conclusion made by the system after summarizing infinite information.

The flaw was that very few people who had taken the Path Seeking Pill would ever rise to the top of the next level.

In other words, if anyone experienced the next level through the Path Seeking Pill, they would only become mediocre in that level; very few of them could reach the top tier.

Perhaps that was the price of using external help.

Still, it was a king-level pill anyway; furthermore, it was very effective. Anyone with reasonable potential could reach the level they experienced with its help.

After all, it would be downright dumb if they fail on the road they had already trodden once.

This pill showed me how to condense the Divine Mark with triple small worlds; I’ll be able to rise to the Celestial State if I do the exact same. I’d be quite the tough Celestial... After all, not everybody has triple small worlds. However, my future journey beyond the Celestial State will be difficult if I do exactly the same as it showed.

I might not even have the courage to finish the rest of the journey.

You cannot depend on anything except yourself on the cultivation journey. I must walk on a superior path to neutralize the pill’s flaw.

Maybe I’ll be able to avoid the pill’s negative influence when I condense the fourth small world, Su Ping thought.

He certainly didn’t cultivate triple small worlds as arduously just to remain stuck in the Celestial State.
