Chapter 1455 Token of Trust (2)

While escorted by Iris and two others at the God Emperor level, Su Ping was like an emperor roaming the place incognito, viewing everything about the humanoids’ lifestyle. He discovered that their civilization was highly developed. The locals lived a patterned life; even the people on the streets were walking with the same pace.

Everything was in order.

Furthermore, that green glass world was extremely vast. Su Ping and Iris crossed many cities, continents and oceans, and they had yet to reach the end of such a massive place.

Su Ping stopped in some cities and bought world maps, only to discover that he had only visited less than one tenth of the entire region.

The area he had visited was already equal to seven hundred Blue Planets.

A few days spent there and Su Ping had already acquired lots of information from Iris. Although vigilant at the beginning, she stopped hiding basic information.

They’re not arrogant like the gods. However, they are cautious, indifferent and self-contained. He gradually became aware of the cyborgs’ indifference and rationality.

After estimating that enough time had passed, he bid Iris and his other hosts goodbye.

Hearing that Su Ping was leaving, Iris and the others were all curious. They were eager to find out how Su Ping would pass the green glass.

After all, even they were unable to destroy the barrier.

Su Ping wasn’t secretive about it; he also allowed them to inform the Selvegas. They witnessed how he summoned the system and a vortex appeared; one last wave goodbye and stepped into the vortex, vanishing without a trace. It was a friendly gesture toward his new allies, but it was also meant to intimidate them.

Iris and the others were stunned.

They had thought of many ways that Su Ping could leave. For instance, flying to the green glass and somehow fuse into it, or piercing the barrier. However, none of them expected such a simple approach.

They couldn’t even tell where the vortex was leading to.

They could only sense the vague trace of a frightening aura on the other side of the channel.

The bluish woman was the most shocked of all. Being a Selvega herself, she was one of the strongest cyborgs, but she realized that she wasn’t able to see the world on the other side of the vortex. She examined it carefully, only to detect a frightening aura, one that no Selvegas could ever have. It belonged to the legendary Sorcerer Ancestors!

So, he does have a Sorcerer Ancestor backing him…

The woman showed a troubled expression. The horror of the Sorcerer Ancestors was recorded in their archives with great detail. They could erase the entire clan with the wave of a hand.

Su Ping was supported by a Sorcerer Ancestor, and yet he went to see them and propose an alliance. She couldn’t help but wonder if her suspicion was a stupid offense.

In any case, she had to inform the other Selvegas of such a find; they would have to reevaluate that ally if theirs. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Su Ping went back to the store after leaving the world of cyborgs. Days and nights were much longer than they used to be, ever since he left the old universe. However, everybody still kept the original time system of the Federation. Sometimes, they would bid each other goodnight, even though it was still the middle of the day.

It was sunny outside, but all the staff were resting; it was obviously a later hour in the day. Su Ping’s shadow clone was training pets and there weren’t any spots available at the moment, which was the main reason why they closed every day.

He saw both Joanna and Tang Ruyan

cultivating, so he didn’t disturb them. He quietly left the store and went to the palace.

Once he got there, he noticed that Shen

Huang and the others were still waiting. He had spent a dozen days in the cultivation site, but only twenty-four hours had passed in the

real world.

“How is it going?” Su Ping asked.

All eyes were trained on him. One of the Celestials quickly replied, “She’s not back yet; she’s still exploring. There are many lives

hiding in the dark.”

Su Ping nodded and looked at the dark on the screen. Kayafollet seemed to be wandering in space, hoping to explore more territory.

space

“Did she encounter any monsters in space?” asked Su Ping, remembering what the bluish

woman said.

Everybody felt dazed. Shen Huang said, “There was a giant beast hidden deep in

space; however, she avoided it. There weren’t any other monsters… Is that giant beast very

dangerous?”

“Just one?” Su Ping was surprised. That single beast couldn’t be the same monster the bluish woman was scared of; after all, it couldn’t be possible that the many Ancestral Gods inside would be hiding behind the green

glass barrier to avoid a mere monster. “I’ll ask her to return,” said Su Ping. He immediately took out a red heart that he had dug out of Kayafollet’s body. She could feel it despite the blockage of the universe barrier and was also a beacon to call her back. All in all, telepathic messages and contracts couldn’t send any information; that was the

only way to call her.

The person on the screen paused right after. The next moment—the video feed quickly changed, showing a deep space view. Afterwards, Kayafollet broke through the barrier with a dazzling light.

Su Ping detected Kayafollet’s vague aura from

the void outside.

He waited patiently.

Her presence became stronger as she approached, until they could sense each other directly. It didn’t take long for her to get to the palace.

She

“You must be exhausted. How did it go?” Su Ping saw the fatigue on Kayafollet’s face. had definitely gone through many things that weren’t recorded.

“Thank you for your concern, master.” Kayafollet put on a smile, as if she were a little girl who had just been complimented. She then said solemnly, “I found some planets with humanoids that have very

developed civilizations.”

“Their planets are hidden behind natural barriers; it’s hard to notice them if you’re not

careful.”

“Based on what I sensed, the strongest

among them is as strong as me. Still, I didn’t dare get too close. So I left in a hurry.”

“I read from the memories of some ancient Ascendants who have lived for long periods of time. There seem to be some existences stronger than universe dominators among them.

“However, those existences live in secret places and I had second thoughts about searching for them,” said Kayafollet.

Su Ping nodded. “That’s right. They’re cyborgs. They have members who are in the Undying State, and there are plenty.” “Cyborgs?” Shen Huang and the others were stunned; they looked at Su Ping in astonishment. One of them asked, “Boss Su, how… how’d you know?”

“I’ve met them,” Su Ping said briefly, “They were also attacked by the Heavens, but luckily, they survived and hid in their universe. Maybe the Heavens reigned over this place for a while, but their domination has weakened as of late. We’ll be safe as long as we hide where the locals live.”

Everybody looked at Su Ping with shock and suspicion. Why did he know even more things about that place than Kayafollet, who had just returned from an exploration?

Even so, not asking was still the sensible choice. Su Ping carried too many secrets. Even if he explained, they probably wouldn’t understand.

“The most dangerous place is the safest place. If they’ve hidden themselves for so long in that place, it should be fine for us to stay there for now,” said Shen Huang.

“Cyborgs? They’re not living creatures?” asked a confused Celestial cultivator.

Su Ping shook his head and said, “They’re different from the machines we know, as they’re naturally-born life forms; they’re not dead objects with artificial intelligence.” The Celestial cultivator was still lost and confused.

“Let me see what you’ve found. If nothing else, we’ll pack up and settle down here for now.” Su Ping waved at Kayafollet.

Kayafollet stepped up obediently and placed her head below Su Ping’s hand, like a cat

enjoying touching.
