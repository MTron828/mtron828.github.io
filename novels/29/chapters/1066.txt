Chapter 1068: One Versus Three

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

However, Heather didn’t detect any other presence after a thorough examination.

Still, the result didn’t bring her any relief; instead, she felt colder and colder.

She had been observing Su Ping. He was indeed fearless; it wasn’t just pretense!

The battle between Joanna and the three Superior Gods had been transferred to a unique time and space constructed by some sort of power, where ten thousand years would pass in the blink of an eye; countless laws and paths were collapsing and reorganizing. Figures made of laws were flashing everywhere.

The battle was so splendid that Su Ping would not understand it even if he could watch, all due to lack of knowledge; he could only memorize the images, hoping that he would later unravel the details as his level rose.

“You’ve performed too many forbidden skills. Do you really want to die?”

Eborr revealed himself during the battle; his luxurious robe was torn and stained with a blood that wasn’t his.

He was angrily staring at Joanna. He knew that the war goddess was relentless as she fought her enemies; still, it never occurred to him that she was even crazier when it came to her own self in a real life-and-death battle!

Bang!

Eborr’s question was answered by a divine spear, which penetrated the void in the middle of countless, brilliant paths.

Eborr, infuriated, raised his hand and invoked his divine world, turning the tides and holding the aggressive spear as if it were his own weapon—

But his expression changed when he held it. His hand shook, and blood flowed out of his fingers.

“Oh no!”

The formerly calm Avril changed her expression and exclaimed, “Is she going to blow herself up?”

“Blow herself up?”

Eborr was just getting angry because of the wound, but his mood quickly changed to shock when he heard that.?Is she crazy??She knows she can’t win, and that is why she’s creating an opportunity for the human to escape by killing herself?

He unconsciously glanced at Su Ping, and was relieved to see that Heather was by his side.

It would be useless even if Joanna blew herself up if Heather was keeping Su Ping in check.

“If she really wants to die… Grant her wish then!”

Shivalello didn’t stop her; he was truly furious. They were only trying to capture Joanna, but the latter had been fighting back with all her strength, even using many forbidden skills.

Each of those dangerous skills would leave critical sequelae; tens of thousands of years would be required to recover. Given all the skills used thus far, she would die even if they caught her alive.

At the same time—Heather became nervous as she watched the battle. She knew that Joanna’s actions were unusual; there had to be a reason unbeknownst to them.

She looked around warily. A feeling of unease started to grow within her, in a place where not a single life was a threat to her; such a sensation was something she had not felt in a long time.

“Superior Gods are indeed strong, but not as much as I thought!”

While enveloped by infinite brilliance, Joanna’s eyes were bloodshot, and her aura was rampant. She had already started to deform after having used many forbidden skills; it was difficult to even keep her rationality. She had never been that strong… Adding her Divine Mark world, she was very close to the Celestial State.

Unfortunately, it was still impossible for her to beat three Celestial State experts.

Even so, she didn’t back off one bit. Rather, she wanted to gauge her own limits through such an opportunity, and really feel the power of the Celestial State.

Joanna stopped hesitating once the power brought by the forbidden skills began to decline. She would be confined and would lose the power to fight them if she fell from her peak state.

So, she decisively chose to detonate herself.

Her small world—one that contained her countless paths, and the world recently created in the Divine Mark—exploded at the same time. Her blood and the Titan constitution were fully burnt to a crisp right then.

The three Superior Gods changed their expressions upon feeling the terrifying waves of destruction. They quickly changed the spacetime surroundings. The entire temple would be destroyed if the power of Joanna’s self detonation surged out!

“She’s truly dying…”

Heather stared at her closely. She knew that the bigshot wouldn’t just sit idly and watch if they were present!

Still, nothing happened while she watched. Joanna’s body, like a scorching sun, exploded along with countless paths and laws in its most brilliant moment, releasing chaotic power.

Boom! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The entire temple was shaking; the void was shattered. The storm of laws was tearing everything apart.

The three Superior Gods immediately overlapped their divine worlds and countered the destructive power. Even so, they didn’t look very happy.

They had indeed pooled their powers, each of them had felt some pressure.

In any case, the Celestial State was exceptional; Joanna couldn’t hurt them; not even with her self destruction as long as they were prepared.

The strongest Ascendant expert could merely escape and survive when facing Celestial experts, but those powerhouses couldn’t be killed by the former!

Celestials could barely be hurt by Ascendants!

“Is she dead?”

Heather was stunned. She didn’t expect that Su Ping’s backer would just let Joanna die like that.

She was still watching Joanna’s explosion, but she diverted some of her attention to observe Su Ping… Only to see nothing but a peaceful smile on his face; it was as if he wasn’t considering the situation a big deal. He wasn’t sad in the slightest because of Joanna’s death!

This human!

A rising fury was bursting out of Heather’s eyes.

But the next moment—her face froze, as she was overpowered by disbelief. She looked like she had just seen a ghost.

At the same time… The three Superior Gods in the temple—formerly wearing grim looks after Joanna’s self explosion—changed their expressions and looked ahead in shock.

Joanna came back to life!

Her body was recreated from the pieces in the middle of divine light, and she was back in her peak state.

The spear in Eborr’s hand flew back to Joanna in a streak of light, profiting from his shock to escape from his grasp.

Her hand was beautiful and strong, just like before.

“Let’s fight again!”

Joanna stepped forward, her aura rising quickly. All sorts of forbidden skills surfaced instantly on her body. She charged at the three Superior Gods with her spear.

“She was dead…”

“Space and time were shattered. How could she have resurrected?”

The Superior Gods were dumbfounded.

The stronger they were, the greater their shock.

Did she resurrect by reversing time? Impossible!

Space and time had been shattered. What was there to reverse?

According to them, it was impossible for Joanna to resurrect. They didn’t understand what kind of power could revive her; she might have summoned herself from a time in the past by using the laws of nature. However, she had already been destroyed at that moment, and she couldn’t possibly summon herself from the past.

That is, unless someone else did it.

All of them were shocked at the thought of that. They looked around, and didn’t detect any unusual aura. They instantly stared at Su Ping, only to find that he was calm and unsurprised.

That human is indeed behind all of this!

He knows why!

“Even if someone took action, could they really have summoned her from the past? That’s impossible. She just blew herself up, cutting her past and her future; it cannot be reversed!”

Even Shivalello—always the calmest among them—was shocked and unable to think with clarity. Such power was beyond his comprehension.

They wouldn’t have been as surprised to see a resurrection if a Star Lord were present. They would have just assumed that it was a time reversal, and an Ascendant State method.

Ascendants would have thought that it had been a Celestial State method.

However, being Celestials themselves, the Superior Gods knew how thoroughly Joanna had detonated herself; it would have been impossible for them to save her!

Besides, some of the forbidden skills Joanna performed had absorbed and cut her power from the past and the future, making it impossible for her to resurrect in any way they knew!

Maybe Ancestral Gods would understand, since they were much stronger than Superior Gods and had mastered powers they didn’t understand; such a powerful cultivator could have accomplished that.

They were covered in cold sweat after considering the implications. They had never felt that uneasy and frightened as they were at the moment in their whole lives.

If Su Ping’s protector was an Ancestral God, they could be gazing at that place right then, undetected!

Boom!

The three Superior Gods simultaneously took action when Joanna charged toward them with her spear. Instead of a counterattack, they simply pushed her away.

None of them dared to attack randomly again; they were observing the environment with all their might, hoping to find the author of that feat.

However, the person was like a nightmare; one that only existed in their hearts. There was no sign of him, at all.

“Stop!”

Shivalello couldn’t help but say when Joanna tried to charge again, “Let’s talk nicely! We don’t have to do this!”

Joanna paused and demanded, “In other words, you’re willing to let us go?”

Shivalello hesitated and changed his expression. He was no longer confident of keeping Su Ping if Joanna could resurrect. Still, if they allowed him to walk away, they wouldn’t have a similar opportunity again. What if their guess was wrong?

Or maybe, that bigshot couldn’t show up for some reason at the moment. If that were the case, that day would be their best opportunity.

But he wasn’t willing to take his chances.

He would be forever doomed if he made a mistake!

“How did you resurrect?” asked Eborr directly. Although he could take a guess, he wanted to hear Joanna’s reply.

“None of your f*cking business!”

Joanna’s reply rendered Eborr speechless and grim. Her worst would have been to act cold and tough when she addressed them; but she had changed, as she was becoming truly rude!

“We wouldn’t have done this had you told us that you could resurrect, along with the rest of the bigshot’s capabilities,” said Avril, frowning.

Joanna suddenly looked at her, and then smiled.. “Negotiations should be done on equal grounds. Do you think there would be an opportunity to negotiate if I have to kill myself in order to prove we’re worthy of negotiating with you as equals?”
