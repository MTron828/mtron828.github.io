Chapter 1410: Emperor Yen (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

He hasn’t been suppressed?

The Rain Emperor’s face changed a bit the moment he noticed that Su Ping was still coming on top when facing Emperor Lie and Emperor Feng, and realized what was going on. The young human’s power was complete, without any signs of invasion; even the power of the Netherworld seemed to be supporting him!

Emperors are being suppressed by him. Is he carrying any special treasures??The Rain Clan leader’s eyes glittered. He was so terrified of Su Ping’s mysterious ways that he even risked asking someone from the Witch Mountain to attack him, a taboo organization; the Rain Clan would become a public enemy if anyone found any evidence.

However, Su Ping survived the Witch Mountain’s curse. He even became a God King and showed a terrifying power, comparable to that of an emperor.

He even suspected that the young human was the reincarnation of an Ancestral God!

The guy could be carrying the memories of his past life.

Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain how formidable he was!

Both Emperor Lie and Emperor Feng were once more trying to attack Su Ping. Although both were being suppressed by the latter, they were drawing the power of their respective universes, all to fight evenly with the human.

Elder Yan and the others were shocked by such development; Su Ping’s strength opened their eyes time and again. They were shocked by the power he displayed, which was greater than most elders’.

While they couldn’t translate their feelings into words, two figures appeared out of the blue and broke into the bloody world at an incredible speed.

Elder Yan suddenly changed her expression and realized something. She demanded furiously, “What are you doing?”

She couldn’t have been more angrier and shocked.?How could the Rain Clan be so shameless?

Both figures appeared inside the blocked space right when Elder Yan spoke, attacking when Su Ping had just forced Emperor Lie and Emperor Feng to retreat.

“Huh?”

Su Ping suddenly detected killing intent aimed his way, which rushed towards him without any warning; it had been suppressed and concealed, to later burst into the open like angry beasts, sneaking up on him. The killing intent alone was enough to consume him.

Su Ping widened his eyes in fury. He looked back and saw two pairs of cold eyes; they attacked him from two directions, using sword and spear respectively.

Those weapons contained the immense power of the universe. It was obvious that they were using their full strength!

Two vastly different powers surged and suppressed the Great Dao surrounding the young man; one of them was akin to hell, dark and strange, while the other was as unpredictable as falling snow.

“F*ck off!!” Su Ping roared, never expecting that the Rain Clan would deploy four emperors at once, nor the sneak attack.

They truly didn’t care about face when they were dead set on killing the enemy.

Su Ping waved a fist and broke the sword, and the long spear pierced his body. An infinitely sharp power was rushing into his body, ready to tear him apart. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He grabbed the spear and gazed at the person holding it; the latter looked back at him coldly, unwilling to give in.

“Contract!!”

Blood surged in Su Ping’s head. He sensed death; the power of the guy’s universe was terrifying, which was expected of an emperor. However, Su Ping’s own potential was exploited at the moment. He fully activated his Dao Heart, and the spear he was grabbing onto was also covered with the power of contract, feeling that he was about to control it fully.

“Huh?!”

The person who wielded the spear suddenly changed his expression, feeling that his long-time weapon was getting out of control.

“Drop it!”

Su Ping clenched the spear and shook it, unleashing several streams of power that burned like flames. Spikes seemed to be protruding from the spear, piercing the enemy’s hand.

The owner was forced to loosen his hold.

Su Ping dashed hundreds of meters back and plucked the spear out from his body. The massive hole was slowly recovering and the remaining destructive power was gradually being suppressed. Normal God Kings would have been obliterated had they been struck by the spear.

“You…”

The spear owner was a man who wore a dark golden robe. He looked gloomy at the moment, as it was embarrassing to be robbed of his weapon. Still, half his arm would have been blown apart if he hadn’t let go. His weapon had betrayed him.

The scene fell quiet. The four men surrounded Su Ping while showing contorted expressions.

No one expected the ambush to fail, thinking that one attack was enough to deal with the human.

The other experts that followed Elder Yan then realized what happened, as the whole exchange had happened all too quickly, ending when they could finally see it clearly. All the experts from the Institute were furious as they looked at the two fellows who showed up at the last moment.

“Rain Clan! Do you have any shame?”

“Four emperors attacking a single God King. Can you really be called emperors?”

“Not only did you gang up on a single person, but you even launched a sneak attack, and you have Emperor level cultivation. You think we would have stood idly if you killed the Dao Child?”

“How unscrupulous. This matter must be spread out, so that all the clans learn of your horrible ways!”

All the elders were incensed, and were openly pointing fingers as they shouted about all the Rain Clan’s wrongdoings.

The Rain Emperor looked gloomy, well aware that the matter was showing them in a very poor light. However, the winner was king; as long as they killed the enemy, would morals really matter? Talking about fairness in a fight was ridiculous. Was there any of the godly clans free from guilt? Had they never been unscrupulous in the past?
