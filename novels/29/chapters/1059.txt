Chapter 1060: Sky Slayer

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping noticed his senior sister’s arrival, so he hurriedly reported, “Senior sister, I now have a basic grasp on the Sun Chaser technique.”

Ji Xueqing, however, didn’t say anything.

She didn’t know what to say.

She claimed that it would take him ten years to learn the technique, if he was lucky. That was her original expectation.

However, as it turned out, he had grasped the technique in just two months. All of it felt like a slap in the face to her.

She had been observing in secret over the past two months, every day noticing his swift progress until he got the hang of the body movement technique.

Su Ping’s elder sister had finally realized that she had badly misjudged his capabilities. Even though he was still in a rapid growth phase, he had consolidated his abilities quite favorably, all thanks to his precise control over laws; it was almost as if he had indeed cultivated for a thousand years.

Plus, he was shockingly smart when it came to learning new things. That was why he was able to grasp the complicated body movement technique in only two months.

After a long time of silence, Ji Xueqing finally said in a peaceful tone, “Well done.”

“It’s all thanks to your teaching, senior sister,” Su Ping grinned and said to compliment her.

Ji Xueqing’s lips twitched. Still at peace, she said, “You have a very precise control over laws. Looks like you’ve trained in that aspect; no wonder you picked up the technique so fast. I may have to change your training program. Given your talent, you should be able to master the other secret technique in two months.

“I need to consider how to make the best use of the remaining time, so that you can be better prepared.”

Ji Xueqing glanced at Su Ping and put on a subtle smile as she spoke.

The other technique was even more complex; it would take him at least half a year to grasp it, even if he was extremely familiar with laws. Her original plan was for Su Ping to master the Sun Chaser in ten years, while he would depend on luck in regards to how much he could learn of the other technique.

However, Su Ping’s performance was beyond her expectations, which was a good thing for her.

Still, although happy with his performance, she had to get back at him for being slapped in the face.

She had been shocked time and again by Su Ping’s progress. This time, she had purposefully shortened the time because she wanted to win that one!

“I’ll try my best.” Su Ping nodded.

He wanted to grasp the technique as fast as possible too, and then focus on new laws.

“I heard from Master that the sword is your favorite. Therefore, the technique I’ve picked for you is a sword technique. Considering your talent, you must have mastered the law of sword, right?”

“That’s right.”

Ji Xueqing glanced at him when he admitted to it. It was still within her expectation, but she had conflicting feelings when she realized that Su Ping had mastered numerous laws, even though he was only in the Star State.

“That’s good. If that’s the case, you should be able to grasp the technique in two months.”

Ji Xueqing stressed the “two months” part, and then said, “This sword technique is called Sky Slayer. It’s very powerful, and it doesn’t consider defense at all. This sword technique makes you charge at your enemy without ever considering coming back!

“Although you may cut down your enemy with this technique, it may still be too dangerous if you don’t use the Sun Chaser movement technique.”

Su Ping listened quietly, knowing that his senior sister had surely spent a lot of time picking those techniques for him.

“Learn it well.”

The Divine Mark appeared on Ji Xueqing’s forehead again, transmitting the essence of the sword technique straight to Su Ping’s head.

He narrowed his eyes as he immediately felt an illusory, yet sharp sword aura in front of his eyes, which seemed to be cutting his pupils apart!

Although the sword aura was quite vague, he felt he was being cut apart just by watching. He had goosebumps all over his body.

Very soon, Su Ping noticed a sword aura rising between the sky and the earth.

It was like the first streak of light that broke the void!

The sword aura was unstoppable as it rose to the sky, seemingly about to penetrate the world!

It destroys everything in its way, never looking back; not even when it’s out of momentum…?Su Ping looked at the sword aura, and could vaguely feel the swordsman’s determination.

He had the determination of attacking and killing his opponent relentlessly, at the cost of his own life!

A sword was the weapon wielded by a master—

It could also understand its master’s intention!

Using a sword with physical strength was the worst; using a sword with tricks was better, and using the sword with determination was the best!

The sword aura seemed to contain some sort of willpower and determination at the moment. It tore the sky apart, above the chaos. Countless laws and lightning smashed down. The sword aura leaped against the river current. It fought back while facing countless strikes, using even more violent and crazy moves!

It didn’t dodge or circumvent, unleashing an even more dazzling brilliance!

This sword technique…

Su Ping was deeply astounded.

It was crazy and insane!

Once could almost say that such a technique had been made for lunatics!

It was all about killing and destroying, without considering one’s own safety!

The sword contained countless laws. What was even more horrifying: those laws didn’t enhance the sword; they destroyed each other, causing a strange power of destruction to emerge, which was then imbued to the sword aura, which would drown and destroy everything it touched!

If you want to kill your enemy, kill yourself first. This is almost a sword technique for suicide!

If you destroy your own laws, how are you supposed to wave this sword? It’s impossible to grasp this sword technique, is it?

Su Ping was so deeply shocked by the sword technique that he even wanted to back off.

He had felt the technique’s edge; it was really sharp and terrifying, with a killing aura that would ruin everything!

It seemed that even the swordsman who was performing the sword technique would also be killed by it!

Such a technique cannot exist; there must be a way to master it. Otherwise, those who practice it will die before they actually use it.

What kind of power can control all laws and have them release their features in order during the destructive sequence?

Su Ping was deep in thought.

Ji Xueqing smiled but didn’t say anything as she saw Su Ping ponder in shock over the technique. She gradually disappeared from view. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Time went by one day after the other.

Up on the mountaintop—Su Ping stood absolutely still, just like a statue.

He was still visualizing the sword aura in his head; the laws around the sword aura supported each other and unleashed a sharp power.

There seemed to be something working as a foundation and balance for all those destructive laws.

There’s only one thing that can possibly balance all the laws…

It’s the world!

Su Ping suddenly woke up, as if someone would have just poured a bucket of water over his head.

Then, he stared at the sword aura again. He immediately noticed more things since he had gained a deeper understanding; there really seemed to be a world hidden inside the sword aura!

I see…

The control over the world…

Su Ping finally understood what had happened. He raised his head, condensing a sword made of deity aura. He then raised his hand and waved the sword!

He controlled the sword in his hand as if he were controlling his small world.

He practiced again and again, releasing laws that ripped each other apart to the point of destruction as they surrounded the sword. They melded together, becoming a horrifying power.

Bang!

His sword was blown up by the laws in the first attempt.

Bang!

The second time was no different.

The third time, the fourth… Until the 832nd time!

The sword didn’t explode. Then, a sword aura darted out and then exploded.

Su Ping tried again and again.

So, it all comes to balance…

Su Ping gradually experienced an epiphany as he practiced. He couldn’t help but admire the creator of that sword technique.

Underneath the violent and crazy power of destruction was a balanced heart that controlled everything.

He could vaguely picture a man whose heart was calm, but his eyes were crazy. That was the creator of the sword technique.

His hand had to be brutal, and his heart must be stable!

Bang!!

The entire void shook after Su Ping slashed with the new sword aura. A deep black mark seemed to be surfacing!

“What happened?”

A person appeared near the crack all of a sudden; it was none other than Ji Xueqing. She had left with satisfaction after seeing Su Ping’s sword explode again and again while he tried his best to practice the technique. She was about to resume her own activities when she detected that her small world was quaking!

That’s right. Her small world was under attack!

Although the tremors were feeble, she was still shocked to find that her small world was affected. She was deep in the Celestial Court’s territory… Was someone ambushing her?

However, hardly had she shown up when she noticed the gradually receding light in midair.

A sharp cutting force was vaguely spreading out in the void. The air seemed to have transformed into countless blades in the place where the sword aura disappeared.

She felt she was inhaling blades that churned her body every time she breathed!

Ji Xueqing suddenly looked at Su Ping. Then, she extended her consciousness to the utmost depths of her small world, replaying what Su Ping had done while she was away, until she saw how his sword had slashed forth a moment earlier—

“You…”

Ji Xueqing stared at Su Ping in shock, her eyes with a slight shiver.

How long has it been? Has Su Ping already mastered the technique?

This sword technique was much harder to master than the Sun Chaser; it required precise control over one’s small world!

Su Ping felt exhilarated by the sword aura’s effect. He put on a smile upon seeing Senior Sister Ji; he had been planning to call out to her.

“Senior sister, I’ve mastered the technique,” Su Ping reported.

“…”

Ji Xueqing gazed at Su Ping, silent for a long time.

She had kept count of the time… It had only been one month!

She suddenly felt the urge to turn around and leave.

She couldn’t stay there any longer. It was too frustrating!

Where is this junior brother of mine from? He’s a true monster!

Although Ji Xueqing knew that Su Ping’s smile wasn’t intended to mock her, she started to doubt whether or not she knew what mockery was.

That was definitely mockery!

Yes, absolutely!

She took a deep breath and calmed down. Then she said, “Now that you’ve mastered the sword technique, junior brother, what will your next step be? Breaking into the Star Lord State?”

Su Ping shook his head. “I’m planning on going out for a trip.”

“You want to grasp more laws?”

She would have felt sorry for him in the past, as she knew geniuses all too well. Their kind was confident, stubborn and never looked back until they hit a wall.

However, Su Ping had torn down her expectations again and again. She didn’t have subsequent plans for Su Ping’s training, so she didn’t know what she should say to dissuade him..
