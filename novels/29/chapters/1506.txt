Chapter 1507: The Third Strongest In All Worlds (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The 108 Original Dao Glyphs were quickly decomposed in Su Ping’s consciousness. There was an abundant surge of chaos aura as the glyphs were melted. The universe of original chaos appeared when the Dao Glyphs were almost fused.

Hum!

The 108 Dao Glyphs were completely fused, and the chaos universe pushed the fire universe behind Su Ping’s back. The two universes collided, as if fighting for the core position.

The chaos universe gained the upper hand soon after. After all, it came from the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors; it wasn’t something a single fire universe could resist.

Su Ping tried to control them, but there was nothing he could do, just as regular mortals were incapable of splitting one of their cells with willpower alone.

It seems that the power of my fire universe is being blocked…

He was having trouble drawing power from his fire universe, which had been completely suppressed by the chaos universe; it was only capable of emitting a measly bit of power. It would be negligible for Undying State battles.

Good thing I didn’t condense the universe of original chaos at first. Otherwise, its pressure would have made it impossible to condense more universes!

Su Ping secretly felt lucky. His road to advance would have been completely blocked otherwise, unless he spent a long time completely changing his bloodline and dismembering the chaos universe and descend to the Dao Heart State to start all over.

However, this would be difficult and it would take him a very long time.

Su Ping tried working with the universe of original chaos again.

A terrifying amount of power was instantly released, which tore the isolating barrier he had made with the fire universe and continued to sweep across the void.

The guy from the Haotian Clan was still shouting. “Hey, hey, you haven’t given up yet? Break out for me!”

Su Ping automatically ignored the fellow’s ranting. He was shocked by his newfound power.?No wonder it completely suppressed my fire universe. The universe of original chaos is at least five times stronger!

It was noteworthy to say that the tiniest gap in the undying universe realm could determine the outcome of a battle. A five-fold gap was like comparing a brawny man and a child. He could easily kill the other party!

This is the universe of the Chaos Ancestors’ bloodline, which is the best of all clans… My current power is enough to crush all Ancestral Gods in the Archean Divinity; there wouldn’t be a need to use a contract…?Su Ping speculated.

He even thought that the Chaos Perception Dragon was probably no longer a match for him.

Adding the contract power… He felt he was definitely among the very best Ancestral Gods.

“System, do you know my ranking among all Undying State experts in history?” asked Su Ping in his heart.

The system replied calmly, “In terms of comprehensive strength, the third.”

“The third?!”

Su Ping was rather shocked. He thought he would be the best, or second best. However, there were still two experts stronger than him?

“How is it possible? In terms of universe, I carry one of the Chaos Ancestors’ bloodline, which is the best. Not even the mythical creatures from the other twelve clans amount to much when comparing with my current condition. If we add the powers of contract and those of my pets, I can definitely win against the two chaos dragons and even kill them instantly!”

After a moment of silence, the system replied, “In a way, you have indeed surpassed those mythical creatures; now you’re only second to the Sorcerer Ancestors themselves. However, the ones stronger than you are special.”

“Special?”

“Remember what I told you before? I was bound to someone else in the past.”

Su Ping instantly understood. “You bi*ch.”

“Watch your tongue!” said the system rigorously.

Su Ping almost felt a stinging pain, and was a little bit surprised. The system had never been as angry when he cursed before. It seemed to be seriously pissed.

He discovered that the system was becoming increasingly humanlike as the store was upgraded… or emotional. It was more and more like a real living creature, and not just an AI.

“Sorry, I apologize. So, in other words, I’m your weakest host?” Su Ping felt rather helpless. He always thought that his performance was good, never thinking that he would actually be weaker than the system’s previous hosts. The idea made him feel uncomfortable, and even a little bit… jealous.

“It’s not your fault.”

The system calmed down, then said with a snort, “You’ve done a good job. It’s my problem; I didn’t give you the proper resources.”

“That doesn’t sound like an apology,” said Su Ping.

“…”

His disappointment faded away, knowing that the system never lied; this could only mean that his performance wasn’t too bad. He then asked, “What about those two guys? Cultivation-wise, I think I’m already the strongest that anyone can become, right?”

“The one who ranks first obtains the Chaos Qualification, and once it’s absorbed, they will become a new Sorcerer Ancestor!” said the system, “Therefore, they would have the power to crush Undying State experts and to generate a million illusory universes!”

“…”

Su Ping did not know what to say.

Well… Fine, I admit defeat.

“Don’t they say that the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors are fixed?” Su Ping finally asked after a long time.

The system said, “Only the number is fixed.”

“In other words, the members can be replaced?” asked Su Ping immediately, “The Chaos Qualification is the Sorcerer Ancestor’s secret? Whoever gets it becomes a Sorcerer Ancestor?”

“That’s right,” said the system, “And a Sorcerer Ancestor happened to perish back then.”

Su Ping knew it was a truly lucky situation; he thought he was already lucky as things were. When compared to the real sons of destiny, he was just an ordinary person who had to earn everything through hard work!

“What about the second strongest?”

“He established a contract with a Sorcerer Ancestor,” replied the system.

“!!”

Su Ping was greatly shocked again.

One of them scooped up the Chaos Qualification, and the other made a contract with a Sorcerer Ancestor!

No wonder they were the two strongest amongst all clans throughout history. Him fuzzing about being third was a bit too much; he was actually dozens of times weaker than those two when they were at his level!

So, this is what it feels like to have a cheat…?Su Ping sighed, completely convinced.

“Where are they? When are you going to introduce us?” He wanted to find out what those two looked like.

“They’re already gone,” whispered the system with obvious sadness in its voice.

Dazed, Su Ping suddenly realized he had asked the wrong question. Why would the system pick a new host if those two were alive?

“So, they’re both dead? They were so strong and they had your help, but they still died in the end… Were they killed by the Heavens?” asked Su Ping.

After a moment of silence, the system replied, “If I say yes, would you be afraid of fighting the Heavens?”

“Of course not,” replied Su Ping without missing a beat, “If I don’t fight, I will regret it for the rest of my life. If I fight, the worst outcome is death. It’s not the length of life that matters, but the way you choose to live!”

He then changed the topic. “You’ve been training me just so I can fight the Heavens someday, right? So, you’re probably the Heavens’ nemesis. Maybe you were a victim, too?”

“You will know everything and see the real me when you unlock the level 9 store,” said the system.

“Just as I thought…”

Su Ping heaved a soft sigh. He had already realized that everything had an origin, including his system, when he saw the real universe through the Golden Crows ancestor’s memories.

Furthermore, the Earth he transmigrated from was just one of those planets.

It just so happened to be shockingly similar to the Blue Planet from the Federation.

The overall history and the industrial revolution were similar in many aspects. After all, there were countless planets and countless universes; it wouldn’t be too difficult to find two identical planets.

“I hope you’ll answer everything for me,” said Su Ping. Unlocking the store’s level 9 wasn’t too hard; he believed he would soon know all the secrets.

The system simply fell silent.

Su Ping dropped the topic. Whatever might happen in the future, his own strength would always be his most reliable asset; he could only rely on himself, and that wouldn’t change because of the environment. So, whenever you feel uncertainty or don’t know what to do, just try your best and improve yourself!

Bang!

Su Ping detonated the original chaos universe, then gathered his essence and blood to slash furiously again.

The dazzling sword aura illuminated the dark Dragon Prison. The other prisoners were visible for a moment, but Su Ping simply focused on the edge of the sword. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The sword aura disappeared like a stone falling into the ocean. It failed to break the floor!

“Hahaha… You want to break it just like that? I have to admit, your attack was more powerful than before, but did you really think you could break free so easily?” The guy from the Haotian Clan laughed crazily.

There was muffled laughter coming from other places. The others present also deemed Su Ping’s behavior as too stupid. They had tried many things, but all of them gave up in the end.

Tearing through a hundred universes was the bare minimum.

And that was just a theoretical way to escape. No one had ever achieved such a feat.

Su Ping’s eyes were deep. Without a word, he set up a barrier and sat cross-legged once more.

The power of his chaos universe had indeed fallen short. It wasn’t even close.

The fire universe has been too badly suppressed. If I can invoke the power of both universes, their power will double. Unfortunately, the chaos universe is too domineering…

Su Ping tried to activate the fire universe again. Again, only a tiny bit of power was able to leak out. It was pointless.

Good thing I condensed the universe of fire before. At least it created an opening for me. If I condense other undying universes and have them balance each other out, I’ll be able to control them all!

Su Ping felt lucky again. He stood up and looked at the other prisoners.

I will need a lot of Great Daos in order to condense other undying universes. Unfortunately, my body and power will be gone every time I resurrect; otherwise, I can just leave countless Great Daos and then resurrect to absorb them. That way, I’d be able to condense an undying universe very quickly…

Since he couldn’t consume himself, he could only rely on the power of the other prisoners to condense new undying universes.

Su Ping said, “I can leave this place, but not without your cooperation.”

“Hahaha… You’re still dreaming. How are you going to leave?” The Haotian guy laughed.

“Just ignore him. Tell me, what do you want?” said Yan Tai gently.

Su Ping replied with a calm expression. “I need you to release your Great Daos and let me absorb them. I have to take in all of your power.”

“You want to absorb our Great Daos?” Yan Tai was clearly stunned, obviously not expecting that he would outright say what she had always been trying to do.?Can this really be said so casually?

“I think you’re the crazy one!” The guy from the Haotian Clan laughed.
