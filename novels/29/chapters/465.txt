Chapter 468 Beast Strike

There was not a speck of cloud in the deep, blue sky.

High, high above in the sky, a huge figure that was more than ten meters long was flying by. It was a ninth-rank Saber-toothed Bird and sitting on its back were three people.

An old man was sitting on the neck of the bird while behind him were a boy and girl. It was Su Ping and Zhong Lingtong who were going back to the Longjiang Base City.

The old man was an elder from the Zhong Family, a titled battle pet warrior at the intermediate rank. He was told to escort Su Ping and Zhong Lingtong back. “Sir...”

Since she was sitting next to Su Ping, Zhong Lingtong felt a bit ill at ease. She was very curious about the young teacher she had just apprenticed to, but she was afraid to ask questions.

For example, sir, you look so young. How old are you?

Also, are you self-taught? Do you have a teacher? Is your teacher still alive?

She had no idea about Su Ping’s temper and she had to push all the questions to the bottom of her heart. She felt she could barely breathe. After some hesitation, she worked up the courage. “Sir, do you have other students?”

“Nope,” Su Ping said.

That was a short answer...

Zhong Lingtong was speechless. She had worked so hard to summon up the courage and that answer only had one word.

A miser with words!

Zhong Lingtong lowered her head. She pinched her clothes and her eyes became watery.

The old man sitting on the bird’s neck turned around and respectfully reminded Su Ping with a smile, “Master Su, we will be arriving at Longjiang Base City soon.”

Su Ping nodded.

Roar!!

Right then, a fierce bellow suddenly came from further ahead.

That roar was so loud that the three of them could hear it even while flying thousands of meters above the ground. Startled, Zhong Lingtong and the old man lowered their heads. They saw that dozens of people were being chased by a bunch of beasts on the ground. Two of the huge beasts appeared to be quite ferocious and tough.

“I don’t think they’re explorers.”

The old man was shocked to see women, kids, and other vulnerable people in the crowd. Some battle pet warriors had set up a seal to protect those common people who had no cultivation.

No explorers who went out for a hunt would bring along those common people.

“Master Su...”

The old man meant to ask Su Ping if he was willing to help.

“Get down there,” Su Ping said at once.

He stood upon the saddle as if there were a magnetic force pulling his feet to the saddle. The old man steered the bird to make a dive. Su Ping was face-down in such a position. The wind blew his hair up.

“Take care of my student,” Su Ping requested. He mobilized his astral powers and flew down when he was a thousand meters away from the ground. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Su Ping’s reminder came as a surprise to Zhong Lingtong. All of a sudden, she felt a spread of warmth through her heart. Whoosh!

Su Ping dashed to the ground.

He could see that the herd of beasts that were attacking this crowd of people was being led by two ninth-rank beasts. Su Ping threw himself first to the ninth-rank Column Cattle.

Whoosh!

He rushed to the ground like a meteor rock falling. Some battle pet warriors that were dealing with the beasts were gladly surprised to see this human being, a titled battle pet warrior, floating down from the sky!

The Column Cattle roared. A layer of earthy yellow armor appeared over its body as the Column Cattle smashed one of the battle pet warriors away.

Sensing danger, the Column Cattle raised its head. The view of a man diving down leaped into its sight.

Roar!!

Angrily, the Column Cattle stomped on the ground. Many spikes rose around it and the spikes grew quickly and converged into one huge pinnacle above its head!

Come on!

Su Ping did not slow down. He wielded his fist!

Compared to the Column Cattle, Su Ping was a tiny little man. It was like a small piece of rock was going to fall onto a boulder.

However, the next second, accompanied by a loud noise, the pinnacle cracked and the ground shook. Hiding beneath the pinnacle, the Column Cattle was frightened. Su Ping’s punch landed on the Column Cattle’s head. Its body fell into pieces. Due to the impact, a pit with a diameter of over ten meters appeared on the ground!

Instant KO.

The remains of the Column Cattle were scattered across the place. Su Ping stabilized himself above the location where the Column Cattle was at. He did not linger. Up in the air, Su Ping dashed to deal with the other ninth-ranked beast.

Whoosh!

The whistle in the air alerted the ninth-rank that was fighting a battle pet. The beast turned around, only to see the human being heading its way and the remains of its friend.

That view threatened the atrocious beast. Die!

Su Ping rushed to the beast and waved his fist!

Bang!!

Su Ping smashed away the hill-like beast which was barely breathing.

The other beasts screamed and scattered as their two leaders had met their doom.

It was happening so fast that many battle pet warriors had not realized what had happened. The ones that they were protecting in the seal were so frightened that their mouths hung ajar.

Within the blink of an eye, one of the ninth-rank beasts died and the other one crippled!

No one was able to utter a sound as they looked at the young man in the air.

“It’s you...”

In the crowd, one of the middle-aged men could not believe who he had just seen with his own eyes.

Su Ping turned to the man who said those words. The person looked familiar. After further thought, he remembered that this had been the titled battle pet warrior who had helped him ride the Lion Eagle to get to the Holy Light Base City.

“You?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows. “You’re not going to tell me that the underground railway is again under attack, are you?” Su Ping looked around.

Wu Tianming flew to where Su Ping was. He still remembered that young man who had punched a titled battle pet warrior to death but he didn’t know that Su Ping was much more formidable. Things pointed at Su Ping being at the peak of the titled rank, since he could easily eliminate two beasts at the upper position of the ninth-rank!

“Sir, thank you,” Wu Tianming expressed gratitude at once. Embarrassed, he produced a forced smile and continued, “Indeed, we were under attack again. Beasts have been quite active as of late. Considering what happened today, the leaders are thinking about closing this line and reopening after all the beasts are cleared.”

Su Ping didn’t know what to say. It was true that the underground railway could be attacked by beasts but it would only happen once or twice every year. However, he had already encountered two strikes on his way there and back. Barely a week had passed.

Was it him, or were the beasts out of luck?

Su Ping waved his hand. “Okay, I will take off.”

With that said, he flew back.

High in the air, both Zhong Lingtong and the Zhong Family elder were in shock. They were both aware that Su Ping was at the titled rank and yet they both assumed that he had simply relied on some special herbs. They didn’t know that Su Ping could be this violent. The rumors they had heard seemed to be true. Mr. Su indeed was at the peak of the titled rank!

The Zhong Family elder gazed at Su Ping with ardent respect. There was one step between the peak of the titled rank and the legendary rank!

Su Ping is a titled battle pet warrior at the peak and a top trainer. IF he could progress to the legendary rank, wouldn’t that equate to the high chance he would later become a Holy Spirit Trainer?

No wonder the family head reminded the young lady time and again to behave and learn well from Mr. Su. It turns out that the family head already knew about Mr. Su’s potential, and that he could become a Holy Spirit Trainer in the future! the Zhong Family elder thought. He quickly steered the ride to Su Ping’s way.

Su Ping sat down on the saddle. “Let’s go.”

Dealing with two ninth-rank beasts was effortless. He didn’t even have to catch his breath.

Su Ping’s calmness again filled the Zhong Family elder with mixed feelings. He quickly flew away.

On the ground, Wu Tianming, the other battle pet warriors, and the ordinary people watched as Su Ping left. Some even knelt on the ground and kowtowed in his direction.

That had just meant lending a hand for Su Ping. Still, for those people, Su Ping had just pulled them out from a desperate situation. They were naturally quite grateful. As they continued their journey, Su Ping noticed that there seemed to be more beasts than there should be in the wild.

It wasn’t a normal amount.

Su Ping frowned. Were the strikes not accidents but by design?
