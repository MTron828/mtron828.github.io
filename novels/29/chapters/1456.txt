Chapter 1458 Settlement (1)

Waiting for your salvation…

Su Ping could imagine the cyborg’s plan. When the catastrophe took place, they split up and hid in different places of the universe. When the horn of hope sounded again, the experts would break the shackles and rally to unite their forces again.

“Have all the monsters in this region left? Or maybe they’re hiding?”

Basha and the others exchanged glances, not fully convinced of what Su Ping said. They didn’t think the young man was lying; rather, they suspected that the monsters had tricked the latter. The Selvegas should have summoned them if the monsters weren’t there.

“In any case, let’s just keep waiting until the Selvegas do come,” said Crowe.

Su Ping nodded, as it was exactly what he had in mind. He preferred a middle-rank cultivation site for a temporary settlement. Things could go awry if they went to a place with Ancestral Gods.

It had to be considered that, even though he could restrain himself, his master and the others would live there for a long time. It could be risky if their memories could be read without them realizing it.

“Since you’re allies that the Selvegas have approved of, we will prepare a land for you to settle. We hope that you’ll restrain your people and prevent them from crossing the border, to avoid unnecessary conflicts,” said Crowe.

Su Ping nodded. “I will remind them. We will never cause you trouble.”

“Good.”

Basha and the others were relieved. They were somewhat concerned and nervous, given that Su Ping had snuck into their world with the Selvegas’ token of trust. Indeed, he was an ally, but whoever was his backer had to be as strong as the Selvegas. He could easily take over their place if he was greedy.

But with everything coming to that point, they could only compromise. It wasn’t like they could kick Su Ping away. They could only hope that the Selvegas had checked his integrity.

The trio led Su Ping to the palace so he could rest. They also asked someone to prepare a continent for him.

While Su Ping enjoyed their reception, Shen Huang and the others—who were still inside his small universe—were dumbfounded. None of them expected that Su Ping would so easily become an ally to the forces from that unknown universe’s planet.

Ally?

When did Su Ping strike an alliance with them?

Although Su Ping carried many secrets they didn’t understand, that was yet another great eye-opener for them.

In the middle of the reception, Crowe asked curiously, “Mr. Su, are you going to pick up your companions?”

Su Ping smiled and said, “They’re in my small universe right now. I’ll take them out immediately.. You may talk to them if anything is wrong whenever I’m in secluded cultivation.”

All three of them were alarmed and nervous. Is his bigshot backer going to show up?

Shen Huang and the others also became nervous after hearing what Su Ping said. They all felt pressure when they met the universe dominators of another universe for the first time.

Tas SOO

A force was soon imposed on them; Su Ping then took his master and everybody else out.

Noticing Shen Huang and the others who appeared out of thin air, Basha and the others observed them, only to be stunned the next moment. Su Ping’s companions… were too weak.

“Mr. Su, who are they?” Basha was puzzled, but she tried to hold back.

“They are part of the leaders of my clan. Many others died in the catastrophe, and our strength has declined considerably; I hope that you won’t despise us,” said Su Ping peacefully.

Shen Huang and the others were secretly sweating bullets, knowing that Su Ping was blatantly lying. Although a few Celestials had indeed been killed by the Heavens, they were not worth mentioning for the three hosts.

Still, they knew what Su Ping was doing. They were indeed allies, but they had to make an effort to avoid being ignored.

Even those who were in love tended to despise each other in a way. Differences in status could eventually lead to complaints and grudges.

“Leaders?”

Basha and the others were dazed for a moment. These people… are among the leaders of his clan? Wasn’t Su Ping at the top? What about his powerful backer?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They were slightly dissatisfied, thinking that Su Ping had only presented some of the elites of his clan and purposefully hiding their top warriors, which was a sign of distrust.

However, they didn’t point it out; it was just that the smile on their faces was less warm.

“Mr. Su, fighting the Heavens with these people is a truly impressive feat…” said Crowe softly.

Noticing the sarcasm in the man’s words, Su Ping knew he had been misunderstood. He didn’t explain, however. He said, “A lot of experts of my clan sacrificed themselves in the battle against the Heavens. Some are asleep. I can’t introduce them to you for now; please forgive me.”

The three experts finally thawed a bit. Basha said, “The continent is ready. Let’s go there and take a look.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping got up.

Shen Huang and the others immediately followed.

Basha waved a hand and a channel appeared. She stepped forward; there were strange waves of time and space inside. One could get lost and fall into deeper, more chaotic regions without sufficient understanding of the Great Dao.

Su Ping knew she was deliberately testing the Celestial cultivators. With a frown, he casually released a power to envelop his master and the others before entering the channel.

As for Chi Ying, the newly advanced universe dominator, he entered the channel with his own Dao Heart.
