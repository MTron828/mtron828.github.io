Chapter 1483 Annihilation With One Sword Attack (2)

Now that the elder saw Su Ping in the flesh, he instantly detected the immeasurable power in the young man’s body.

Such power far exceeded that of normal emperors. Even he felt inferior. “Is he really going to become a God Emperor…”

A slim figure stepped up. It was none other than Qian Hong, the oldest Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute.

Bright eyed and endowed with an attractive figure, she was like a beautiful and intoxicating flower blooming in the mortal world.

She had already found many Dao Hearts, but none was satisfactory.

She had an epiphany after learning that Su Ping killed the emperors of the Rain Clan, whose level was higher than his. She found her Dao Heart and broke through.

She was no longer a Dao Child, but a real God Empress. She became an honorary elder, and was revered even more than her normal peers.

Her combat ability was greater than many elders, too. Only a couple of them were more powerful, Elder Yan Qing among them.

Qioan Hong’s eyes flashed with fighting will upon seeing that Su Ping was becoming a God Emperor too. She was too proud to challenge him now that she was a God Empress. Although Su Ping deserved her attention since he had killed many emperors, it would be humiliating if she lost to him, and unsatisfying even if she won. After all, her level was higher and beating him would only be seen as the natural outcome.

Even if I’m no match for you, I’d like to know the difference in our strengths… Qian Hong thought. Su Ping’s achievements were too shocking. She didn’t think she could defeat him after he advanced, but she was eager to find out how huge the gap between them would be.

“He’s finally becoming an emperor, too…”

Several figures stepped out from the void. They looked quite old and were extremely low-profile, compared to the others around them. Their auras were barely noticeable.

They were the human emperors.

It was Emperor Xin who received Su Ping in the past, and many other emperors.

They were the pillars protecting humankind in that world.

Su Ping had shocked the entire godly world by slaying the Rain Clan’s emperors. Although the Rain Clan tried to keep it a secret, the event was too grand; even the Ancestral Gods had taken action. All the other high-ranked clans were aware of the matter.

The human clan didn’t see it coming, and were awfully concerned about Su Ping’s wellbeing.

After all, Su Ping was too talented. Back then, Emperor Xin gave him the Ember Palace he treasured the most, and invested whatever top materials humankind had gathered, hoping that Su Ping would become a new pillar of humanity someday.

Only a thousand years had passed, and Su Ping was already on that level.

Every emperor was a bigshot in the eyes of high-ranked clans, which made Su Ping an even greater treasure for humans. “Damned Heaven Path Institute, damned humans!”

The auras hiding in the dark all gritted their teeth in secret after noticing the new arrivals.

“Ask the Ancestral God to catch them once and for all. That ferocious beast might not be here. The Ancestral God can go and investigate in person.” Someone was already determined to kill. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Very soon, more and more figures appeared in the void.

Besides the Heaven Path Institute and the human clan members, the other high-ranked clans also went there to watch.

Su Ping was no longer a nobody. He had become famous in all clans, ever since he killed the emperors in the Rain Clan.

Some remote and weak clans even believed the rumors about him, blowing his abilities out of proportion.

“I had already felt that he was extraordinary when we escorted him out of the Rain Clan territory!”

“That’s right. Our actions were only meant to annoy the Rain Clan. I didn’t expect that we could make friends with humans.”

“Is he the one who killed the emperors from the Rain Clan? He’s so calm after invoking a black tribulation. Impressive!”

“Some Ancestral God assessed that he’s the best genius in the past hundred thousand years. He ranks first on the Chaos List in a hundred thousand year span. I wonder if it’s true.”

“It can’t be. How hard is it to make it to the top of the Chaos List? Don’t even mention staying up there for a hundred thousand years. An Ancestral God could be born in that period of time. Is he more talented than an Ancestral God?”

“True that. Besides, I think Ancestral Gods have better things to do than gauging the strength of a junior.”

“You’re right. I heard that Ancestral Gods only see eye to eye with their peers. The rest are like ants to them.”

The number of onlookers increased with time, filling the place with powerful auras. The black thunderclouds in the sky became more violent, too.

Su Ping noticed the figures around him. He didn’t expect to attract so much attention, even though he had picked a remote place. His eyebrows scrunched a bit. He saw the elders from the Institute and the human emperors, and knew they were there for his safety.

In the crowd, there was a female shouting. “Young man, keep it up! I think highly of you!”

Su Ping looked at her, only to discover that she was a fair-skinned goddess with purple eyes and purple hair. He had learned the specifics of high-ranked clans thanks to some searching in the Heaven Path Institute’s library… All to dispose of them completely if he was forced to kill them someday. Purple Pole Clan. They’re hardliners who worship the strong. Su Ping then looked elsewhere.

The girl’s shouts made the other gods chuckle. They bore no grudges against the human, and were only there to witness the evolution of a genius.

Su Ping frowned at the number of observers around him. He didn’t like being stared at, not because it made him nervous; he preferred a peaceful environment.

Clouds were still surging and the thunder were rumbling, but not a single lightning had struck.

He felt like the lightning had been brewing for almost ten minutes.

“If you’re not coming, I’m going to you,” said Su Ping.

His words were sent to the depths of the Heavenly Tribulation along with his anger.

The thunder was still rumbling, seemingly oblivious to Su Ping’s taunt.

The latter no longer bothered talking. He simply punched the thunderclouds.

After a boom, his fist illuminated the entire world like a rainbow. A hole in the thunderclouds was made the next moment.

Violent lightning was coming out through the hole. It was like a punctured ocean and the water was flowing out.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. This black tribulation was much more powerful than the Lightning Rat’s. So, it seemed to be preparing an ultimate strike!

This thing is truly conscious… Su Ping’s eyes were cold. There was no Heavenly Tribulation that would only strike twice. He blocked the first one easily, but the second one was ten thousand times more powerful. That was definitely cheating!

Fortunately, he could cheat, too; even if he was unable to resist, he could still resurrect.

However, Su Ping wasn’t planning to use that option. Coldness flashed in his eyes and he closed his fingers, gathering a brilliant sword aura, which seemed to be illuminating every corner within a radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.

The next moment, the sword aura rose against the sky.

Everything happened in a flash. The lightning about to fall like a torrent was frozen, and then cut in half. The thunderclouds fell apart like a painting, exploding with the art of cutting. The explosion energy collapsed after spreading for only dozens of meters.

After that, all the thunderclouds were consumed, even those from up above.

There was a sun in the dark sky within a few seconds. It was sunny again.

He cleared the sky with one sword attack!

Everybody was shocked into speechlessness by that crazy move, which happened too fast for them to react. They only felt terrified due to the lightning, but the next moment—the rising fear was gone and the skies were clear again.
