Chapter 831: Return

While Su Ping was feeling surprised, the three fighting Ascendant State experts realized something and stopped. They simultaneously looked at the vortex deep inside the torn chest.

Green Lady was by Su Ping’s side; she gave a sad and scornful smile after seeing their reaction.

“Indeed, they’re not dead yet. They’re coming back.

“Hehe, let’s go,” said Green Lady with an indifferent tone; Su Ping then found himself in the arsenal where a battle had taken place earlier on.

Su Ping heard a devastating explosion the moment he arrived; the noise was spread all across the divine residence!

Whoosh!

Green Lady didn’t stay; she became solemn again, then made flash movements with Su Ping again.

This time, they arrived at the stairs he had crossed in the beginning.

He suddenly saw a broken monument at the end of the stairs. There were several ancient characters on it that he didn’t know.

“The Deities’ Stairs are still here...” Green Lady looked at it and was about to take Su Ping away again, but then he saw a lot of people in the square next to the stairs. They were none other than the leader girl and the others who had been waiting outside.

All of them had somehow crossed the stairs and reached the square.

“Wait a moment.”

The Green Lady paused for a moment and looked at him, frowning.

Su Ping said quickly, “I have an old acquaintance over there. Could you let me warn her?”

The three Ascendant experts had pierced through the Celestial warrior’s chest and revealed the previously blocked Heavenly Pit. Adding what the Green Lady said, Su Ping knew that something horrifying must have been released, and staying there would mean death. However, his Tree of Laws was still in someone else’s possession.

“Huh?”

The Green Lady frowned and said quickly, “You have one second!”

“Sure.”

Su Ping summoned his power and sent out a thought into the proud girl’s head over at the square. “Get out of here! It’s very dangerous!”

The leader girl, who was checking the place at the moment, was stunned to hear the voice. She looked around but didn’t see Su Ping. However, she recognized him.

“Is it very dangerous?”

Her expression changed, when remembering the previous earthquake from a moment earlier. Was the noise not caused by the three Ascendants deep inside the divine residence?

She looked at the divine palaces in front of her and hesitated.

Su Ping started to feel anxious, given her passive attitude. Greed was truly the cause of death on many occasions.

In any case, he didn’t have time to say anything else, because Green Lady had already dragged him away.

If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have let her keep the Tree of Laws. Su Ping smiled bitterly. But it was impossible to predict the future anyway.

Once he reappeared, he found himself in space, right outside the divine residence.

“Is this the outer world these days?” Green Lady looked at the stars and planets in the vast universe, then left without hesitation.

Many more spacecraft carriers and warships were flying over. All of them were adventurers who intended to find some treasures.

Whoosh!

Su Ping found himself in an empty area. Based on the distant dazzling star, he realized he was already far away from the divine residence.

He heaved a sigh as he remembered the many people gathered in the divine residence. He didn’t know what was inside the Heavenly Pit. But since the Twilight Deity King sacrificed himself to stop it and Green Lady preferred not to talk about it, it seemed that the three Ascendants would barely be able to stop it.

It’s too dangerous. While risks may bring fortune, you might also get killed. It’s much safer in the cultivation sites, Su Ping thought.

“This place will fall soon. I’ll take you away.” Green Lady looked back. Su Ping knew that she was looking back at the place where the divine residence was.

He said, “I have a shelter. All you need to do is take me there, senior.”

“A shelter? It won’t matter. No shelter can keep you safe. We must go as far away from this place as possible. You mentioned that human beings are the strongest species nowadays. Are there any experts as strong as Deity Kings among you?”

“Yes, but I don’t know if they can arrive in time after the news spreads.”

“Don’t entrust your hope of survival to someone else. We’d better get away from this place,” Green Lady lectured, as if she was truly grooming Su Ping as a future Deity King.

Su Ping asked cautiously, “Senior, you only need to take me back to my shelter. It’s probably the safest place in the entire universe.”

“The safest place? Is it defended by a Deity King?” snapped the Green Lady.

Su Ping hesitated and scratched his head. “No, but there’s a guy who’s even trickier to deal with than Deity Kings are. It’s likely that not even a Deity King can conquer the place.”

“Huh?”

Green Lady was astonished. She looked at Su Ping and noticed that he wasn’t joking. She asked, “Are you sure?”

“Yes.” Su Ping nodded.

Green Lady was going to say that he had no idea how strong the Deity Kings were, but his confidence made her hold back and decide to check it out first. After all, there was some distance between that place and the divine residence; even if those things got out, it would take them a lot of time to get to where they were.

“Okay, I’ll go there and check it first,” said Green Lady, “Point out the way.”

Su Ping was relieved. He instantly took out the Lord Badge, which could show his position in the universe.

There were satellites everywhere in space, which ensured there would be a signal in every corner.

“It’s over there,” Su Ping pointed in one direction.

Whoosh!

Without a word, Green Lady took Su Ping away.

Their every flash passed by multiple planets, which amazed Su Ping.

Very soon, Su Ping saw Rhea, which was in the northwest side of Zeruprun.

“It’s right there.”

“There?”

Green Lady raised her eyebrows and looked down at the planet. She then said, “This planet has a thin spiritual energy. Even the strongest person is barely an Upper Deity. Are you sure your shelter can block a Deity King?”

She didn’t look good at the moment, feeling that Su Ping was underestimating Deity Kings.

Such experts were awe-inspiring. Lack of respect for them was punishable by death in the old days!

“Well...”

Su Ping didn’t know how to respond, but he had a lot of mixed feelings. She knew the situation of the planet after only a quick glance. Was that how terrifying Ascendant State experts were?

“It’s right there. All you need to do is follow me,” said Su Ping with a smile.

Green Lady frowned but didn’t reply. She then took him to a space station outside of Rhea, much closer to the planet.

The atmosphere and the checkpoints didn’t stop their advance.

In the high sky, with sea underneath her feet and continents around her, she asked Su Ping.”Where is it?”

Su Ping checked his position and said, “It’s on the continent just ahead. I’ll lead the way.”

He unleashed his astral power to move on his own and simply rushed forward in the fourth space at the highest speed.

Several dozens of seconds passed; Su Ping then came out of the fourth space and reached the sky above the Kamp Continent.

It would take him less than a minute to cross an entire continent. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He found that he was able to resist the chaotic sharp torrents in the fourth space with his body and not get hurt!

He had just realized how strong he had become. His estimation was that not even top Star State experts were able to achieve that.

Green Lady wandered casually behind Su Ping and observed the scenes down below. She had already scanned the planet fully when she was in space.

The bottom of every ocean, which were tens of thousands of kilometers deep; volcanoes, and the Rumbling Thunder Continent which were strewn with beasts, all of it had been investigated, but she didn’t find any shelter, according to what Su Ping mentioned.

Whoosh!

Very soon, Su Ping found Woffett City and flew there.

Su Ping reached the sky above the city and then flashed to his store.

His sudden arrival shocked the customers that were waiting in a long queue. Still, all of them were shouting excitedly after recognizing him.

Right after, they noticed Green Lady who arrived right after him. Many had difficulty breathing after they saw her gorgeous and unworldly face.

The previously noisy street instantly fell quiet.

“Huh?”

Tang Ruyan, who was by the door, noticed Su Ping’s company and was astonished by Green Lady’s look, too. She looked at Su Ping in a weird way, as he seemed to have kidnapped another girl who was as beautiful as Joanna—albeit of a different style—during his trip.

“How was business?” Su Ping was finally relaxed after returning to his store.

He greeted Tang Ruyan with a smile.

Tang Ruyan came back to her senses and snorted coldly. “Do you even need to ask? There are too many customers to receive. While Anna and I were busy making money for you, you actually...”

“Actually what?”

“Humph!”

Green Lady glanced at Tang Ruyan and immediately saw through her, inside and out. None of her cells and veins were secrets to her.

“This is the shelter you mentioned?” Green Lady observed the place, not expecting it to be a store.

What caught her attention were the two statues outside the store, which were valuable and intimidating thanks to the essence of beasts sealed inside.

The fat mouse underneath the statues was also strange; its level was low, but it had much more energy than their kind should.

“Indeed this is my shelter. I’ll show you around and introduce a friend to you. I believe you two will have a lot to talk about,” Su Ping replied with a smile.

He was naturally delighted to return home.

After returning home safely, Su Ping thought of the trip in retrospect and found it rewarding. It would be even more rewarding if the leader girl returned alive.

Green Lady didn’t reply, merely choosing to enter the store with Su Ping.

“Oh my god, who is she?”

“She’s so beautiful! I thought Ms. Anna was already unparalleled. I didn’t know that someone could be as attractive as her!”

“I wonder if she loves seeing people on their knees, because I feel like kneeling before her!”

“Boss Su is so awesome! I heard that he was out on a business trip, and now I see him returning with such a beautiful girl. Is Boss Su a beauty reaper? How can he always find such pretty girls?”

“I think that the strongest female warrior of the Federation can’t be as beautiful as them, can she?”

“I wonder if Boss Su is still hiring. I want to work as a gatekeeper for Boss Su!”

The customers in the queue outside the store came back to themselves and went crazy. All the males, from teenagers to old men, felt excited.

Inside the store—

Su Ping saw that Joanna was receiving a customer behind the counter. He instantly said, “Anna, I’d like to introduce you to a friend.”

Joanna raised her head, and astonishment flashed in her eyes. Did I feel it right?

This stranger feels somewhat familiar!

“Huh?”

Green Lady was also surprised. To her amazement, she discovered that she couldn’t detect what was happening in the other rooms of the store.

Not just the store, she should have been able to see the core of the planet if she wanted to!

She didn’t pay attention to living quarters such as that one when she scanned the planet. After all, the cities were mostly the same; a shelter able to resist a Deity King would normally be elsewhere, not in a downtown area. It should have been a special fortress in the wild.

Surprisingly, the shelter was indeed in the downtown area; of all things, it was a store!

“A pure-blood god?” Green Lady narrowed her eyes in surprise, as she had seen few gods with such pure blood. She also sensed that the woman had a strong body; she was probably part of the royal family among the gods!

“She is Joanna, my employee. This is Senior Green Lady. Anna, Senior Green Lady is as strong as your original self,” Su Ping introduced them with a smile.

Shock flashed in Joanna’s eyes.

As strong as my original self?

Is the stranger on par with Gods of Rules?

Su Ping brought a God of Rules back from his trip? It surely is intimidating!

Was she the person behind Su Ping’s back?

“As strong as her original self?” Green Lady was shocked by Su Ping’s words too. Is this girl only a clone? She was unable to tell, but she could sense that the girl’s energy was disproportionate to her level. She had to be an unparalleled genius if she wasn’t the clone of a Golden Deity.

After all, it was normal for a clone to have a horrifying aptitude given the experience from the original self.

“And you said that she’s your employee?” Green Lady looked at Su Ping suspiciously. Did a Golden Deity ask her clone to work for Su Ping?

Even her clone should still have dignity!

“Yes,” Su Ping nodded with a smile and said, “If you want to work in my shop, you can sign an employee contract. Right, if you work for me, I can take you to the Chaotic Realm of the Undead that you want to visit.”
