Chapter 693 Going to War

“Let’s do it!” said Xiang Fengran in heroic spirits. He stood up and said goodbye on behalf of the other three. “We’ll be taking our leave now. Take care of this continent!”

“Yes.”

“Lunatic, take care.”

Ye Wuxiu and Xue Yunzhen stood up, intending to see the off.

Xiang Fengran waved his hand with a smile. “Ah, there’s no need for that; we’ve dealt with such things before. You get to see everything when you stay in the Deep Caves. The worst outcome would be death and we are all prepared for that. Ha, ha...”

He went out the door after saying that and laughing in the end.

His three team members followed him out; the four of them flew away toward their destination.

Qin Duhuang and Zhou Tianlin were surprised as they turned to look at each other. Those were the legendary battle pet warriors who were stationed in the Deep Caves?! They were nothing like the other legendary battle pet warriors they had seen elsewhere!

Xiang Fengran never assumed any airs, always straightforward!

That was how a legendary warrior should act!!

The two sat up straighter out of instinct. They were legendary battle pet warriors

They should be just like him!

Xiang Fengran left. Su Ping was still pondering deep thoughts. He had gone into the Deep Caves and he had met Ye Wuxiu and Li Yuanfeng. Those were a group of people that had no consideration for their personal sacrifices. “Let’s get ourselves ready,” Su Ping said.

Ye Wuxiu and the others trained their gazes at Su Ping. Jing Shen said, “Brother Su, you live here and you know the situation better than we do. Tell us. What’s your plan?”

“We have enough people here so I suggest we start a blanket search around the three defense lines. Alert the others if any of you detect beasts in hiding; we will clean out the beasts together!” Su Ping shared his thoughts.

After considering for a moment, Xue Yunzhen proposed, “This works but I don’t think it’s efficient enough. I think we can split into four teams; each team will be in charge of one area and handle any group of wild beasts on their own if it’s within their power. If the group of wild beasts is too large, notify the others and we’ll do it together.”

“That’ll do,” Jing Shen agreed.

Ye Wuxiu said to Su Ping with a smile, “Brother Su, you don’t have to worry too much about us. We’ve had enough experience witnessing deaths; the big picture is what’s important. We are ready for sacrifice, as we’ve always been since hundreds of years ago!”

“Indeed.” Li Yuanfeng nodded with a smile.

Su Ping forced a bitter smile. “If you say so, we’ll adopt Miss Xue’s method.”

“Good.” Xue Yunzhen smiled. What a heroine.

Soon, they took out a map to decide which area each team would be responsible for. Ye Wuxiu, as well as the other two captains, would lead their original teams. Some of their teams had suffered grave casualties in the Wind Field. Xue Yunzhen, for instance, had always been in that region; only one man remained from her original team.

As such, Su Ping assigned Zhou Tianlin to her team.

She made no comment. Zhou Tianlin was just at the Ocean State and she didn’t think too much of him. But she did like Su Ping for helping her.

“Qin, you will join Brother Ye’s team,” Su Ping said.

Qin Duhuang nodded. He would do whatever Su Ping said.

Ye Wuxiu asked, “What about you?”

“I’ll be fine by myself,” Su Ping said.

Ye Wuxiu objected, “No way! I know that you are powerful, maybe more powerful than I am. But you would be all alone; that’s too dangerous. You won’t even have a chance to call for help on the off chance you run into a large group of beasts, with several being at the Fate State!”

“It’s okay. A few Fate State beasts cannot hurt me,” Su Ping said calmly. He didn’t have to hide his true strength at the moment.

The others looked at him, astounded by his response.

They didn’t think Su Ping was a person who would spout empty words. So, could it be that Su Ping was hiding the fact that he was a Fate State Warrior?

Ye Wuxiu, Xue Yunzhen and Jing Shen remembered Su Ping’s punch when dueling the Black Lunatic. They were even more convinced that this guess was correct. How exciting!

It would be great for them!

Zhou Tianlin jumped in with a chuckle, “Don’t worry. Mr. Su will be fine. He slaughtered a Fate State beast not too long ago, all by himself!”

“I will worry about anyone but Mr. Su,” Qin Duhuang added.

He and Zhou Tianlin had blind faith in Su Ping. Su Ping had gone to the Xing-Jing Defense Line; he had taken care of the wild beasts in a base city, and then killed a Fate State beast king. Besides, he had just sold forty Void State beast kings. People who could do that were beyond rare!

Su Ping was not at the Fate State? That would be a lie!

They even thought that Su Ping was hiding some Fate State pets!

“He killed a Fate State beast king?”

“What...?”

Zhou Tianlin’s information sounded shocking.

Ye Wuxiu and the others looked at each other, aghast. While they were the more powerful ones in the Void State and they could avoid being killed by a Fate State creature... they could not kill one!

The gap between the Fate State and the Void State was larger than that between the Void State and the Ocean State! How could Su Ping ignore the difference in ranks?!

Well... Su Ping might just be at the Fate State, which would exclude the different states factoring... They were still unable to tell what his real rank was. Their senses told them that Su Ping was at the peak of the ninth rank; that may mean that Su Ping’s actual rank was higher. He probably was at the Fate State, like the Tower Master!

Only a Fate State Warrior would sell battle pets at the later stage of the Void State.

Someone of such rank would only aim to get Fate State battle pets!

That had to be the reason. They eyed Su Ping with respect and troubled feelings.

Li Yuanfeng heaved a sigh. He believed that Su Ping was not yet at such a rank the last time he came out from the Deep Caves with the young man. After all, they had been in grave danger back then, and not once did Su Ping employ means of the Fate State. It had only been a short time, but Su Ping’s progress was astonishing!

What a strange guy!

“We might have offended you before, sorry.” Jing Shen stood up and apologized with a bitter smile.

Ye Wuxiu and Xue Yunzhen also said their apologies.

If Su Ping were at the same state as they were, that little match between him and the Black Lunatic would have been justified. But, given that he was at a higher state, he was a “senior” in their eyes!

Su Ping waved his hand at once. “Sit down, please. I am merely at the titled rank. You don’t have to apologize for anything.”

Not that again!

Zhou Tianlin and Qin Duhuang were awfully close to rolling their eyes. Su Ping just loved to play dumb! Always pretending to be weak!

Titled rank?

Ye Wuxiu and the other legendary battle pet warriors curled their lips. They would not believe it. They weren’t born yesterday! Su Ping quickly noticed he was misunderstood yet again. When will I ever clean my name!

Never mind.

The point was to deal with the crisis.

“We don’t have much time. Let’s talk about where we should go. I’ll take care of this area and you can pick your areas.” Su Ping pointed at the east, the largest area; over 10 Class A barren lands were located there. The environment was harsh, full of forested areas and swamps. That was a suitable place for wild beasts to hide.

They didn’t object this time, since they “knew” Su Ping’s state. They soon chose the places each of them would go.

They would leave with their own teams and return to the Longjiang Base City after the job was done.

Qin Duhuang was in charge of the communication. He had invested heavily in getting some SATCOM phones and each of the four teams would get one.

Su Ping got one, too. The phone would allow them to call each other within the continental area, but the signal would be lost outside the continent. That was why Xiang Ranfeng didn’t get one when he left.

“Call each other if you get into trouble! Let’s

go!”

“Come on!”

“Here we come!”

Three teams set off one after the other.

In the meantime, Su Ping went to his store and said to a bored Tang Ruyan who was sitting around, “Stay in Longjiang and look after it. I’ll be heading out to search for hidden wild beasts.”

“You’re going to leave? What if the beasts come here?” Tang Ruyan understood the situation that they were facing. That is why she voiced her concern; she believed that Longjiang was the safest place in the world, all thanks to Su Ping being there. If he were to go someplace else, the Longjiang Base City would be just as vulnerable as the other base cities!

“Don’t worry. The legendary battle pet warriors you just saw are going to start sweeping across the places around Longjiang first. They’re tasked with finding and dealing with the wild beasts that are close by.” Su Ping smiled.

He previously wouldn’t have dared to leave the base city because he shared Tang Ruyan’s concern.

Still, he was sure they would spot and deal with any wild beasts hiding near the base city with the help of Ye Wuxiu and the others.

“Well, if you say so,” Tang Ruyan cautioned him, “You must be careful. Do you want me to go with you?”

“No. You would only slow me down.”

“... Can’t you beat around the bush a little bit?”

“You might not understand me.” Su Ping rubbed her hair until it turned into a complete mess. Then, he happily left.

Whoosh!

While soaring in the air, Su Ping summoned the Dark Dragon Hound and the latter took its dragon form. The pet turned into a fierce dragon, but its head was still like that of a wolf.

Su Ping stood on its back and flew out from the base city.

He was heading east!

He flew past lakes, plains and swamps as he traveled. Dried and yellowish weed were everywhere; he would occasionally see a small number of beasts and most were around the seventh or eighth rank.

Su Ping ignored those low-ranked wild beasts; they weren’t part of the strike and represented no danger.

He checked the surrounding areas and his senses were able to penetrate hundreds of meters into the ground. He told the Dark Dragon Hound to fly close to the ground so that he could sense more clearly.

The stray beasts would usually run in panic because of the Dark Dragon Hound’s presence. The latter was more intimidating than a beast king was. After all, it had received the legacy from the old dragon king!

“Wait!”

All of a sudden, Su Ping noticed something was off in a mountain.

The Dark Dragon Hound came to a sudden halt and stopped hundreds of meters away from the mountain.

“They are hiding right there. Six beast kings...” Su Ping narrowed his eyes. That mountain was magnificent with flourishing woods. Many eighth and ninth rank beasts were there, while the six beast kings were quite good at concealing their presence.

They can easily flatten one base city in an instant. I cannot believe they are clever enough to hide there. Those beasts are organized and they are acting under orders...

Su Ping slowly drew his sword as he gazed at the mountain.

He placed his sword in front of his eyes. It was as if he were using the blade as a ruler to measure the mountain.

Next, he poured Ashura Energy as well as Divine Energy into the sword. A ray of glaring sword light instantly came into being, which increasingly grew in size and thickness. The ray of sword light whooshed down to smite the mountain.

Bang. The mountain was split open and boulders were rolling everywhere.

Su Ping heard countless beasts cry miserably. Blood tainted both halves of the mountain with red.

Su Ping dashed into the mountain that had been split open.

He heard some dragons snarling. Everything quieted down soon after; only the settling dust was left behind.

The two parts of the mountain collapsed and crumbled.

Su Ping came out with a little bit of blood on his shirt. He stood on the Dark Dragon Hound’s back and told it to press on.

The dust was finally settled, revealing blood and corpses. It was quite the hellish scene...

While Su Ping, Ye Wuxiu and the others were trying to clean out the beasts in hiding, the waves were tumbling in the ocean close to the Dragon Swamp Continent.

The wild beasts in the ocean were raising tides; waves were eating up the forests and flooding the land. Many wild beasts were revealed when the tides receded. The wild beasts pressed forward using their strange limbs.

There was a massive base city in front of them; the flames of war were raging.

Many people were running from street to street, swarming on their way to the plaza.

That was the place where a teleporting tunnel had been open, to help everyone escape with their lives.

Suddenly, a swirl opened in the air, hundreds of meters to the north of the tunnel. A ferocious beast came out from it.

The beast was completely red; it had more than a thousand bloodshot eyes. If Su Ping were there, he would have recognized the Thousand-eyed Demon Beast.

“Huh, how foolish...”

The Thousand-eyed Demon Beast gazed into the distance, grinning coldly. It was able to appreciate the scenes of destruction in the city.

“Cut it!” the beast bellowed. One eye on its forehead was opened wide and a ray of red light was shot from it.

Bang. The void was split open. Many people fell from the crack, as if a trash bin would have been turned upside down. Those people fell from the sky; those at the bottom were flattened.
