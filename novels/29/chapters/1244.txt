Chapter 1245 The Chaos Beast’s Rise to the Ascendant State

Hardly had the young Chaos Beast been freed when it roared excitedly and glistened, showing a lot of vortex-like pores. The power of chaos entered the pores in streams and strengthened it at a visible speed.

Su Ping was also looting the power of chaos with his Chaos Star Chart.

That was the most ancient energy; even one bit of the chaos aura was priceless in the outside world.

However, ordinary people could hardly endure the energy of chaos; they couldn’t digest it even if they absorbed it. Only Ascendants and above could.

The chaos aura in the entire space flowed differently as Su Ping and the young Chaos Beast started absorbing. At first, it was all flowing towards the woman, but now a portion was being diverted. Su Ping and his pet were like two reefs, blocking part of a surging tide. Their absorbing speed increased as they improved. They were pulling a massive amount of chaos aura into their bodies.

The woman couldn’t remain calm any longer. She said furiously, “What are you doing? I will surely kill you as soon as I’m done if you don’t stop!”

“You’re talking as if you would let us go if we stop.” Su Ping opened his eyes and looked at her mockingly.

The woman gnashed her teeth. “I was planning on sparing your life and have you work for me as a saint in the Planet of Origin since you’re the demonic store’s successor. But now you’re asking to be killed!”

“That’s not what you said earlier,” said Su Ping casually, “Besides, my back is too straight for me to work as someone else’s lackey.”

He then closed his eyes and absorbed the aura at full speed.

The steady flow of chaos energy was disrupted and divided into three streams; the largest stream was still moving towards the woman, but Su Ping and the young Chaos Beast were each claiming sizable flows too. Their combined pull was almost forty percent of the total energy.

“You!”

The woman couldn’t have felt angrier; there was nothing but coldness and fury in her eyes. She never expected that Su Ping would have a chaos creature, or that he would be able to compete for the energy with her. The energy is mine!

“You are doomed! Doomed!”

Kayafollet wanted to crush Su Ping to pieces. She had always been calm and unconcerned about things because she never lacked a thing. It was the first time that someone else was taking away what she desired. She wanted to terminate the ritual and kill Su Ping.

Still, her rationality told her that she would suffer a greater loss that way. There was also the risk of not being a match for Su Ping with just her own power; after all, she couldn’t kill saints as easily as Su Ping.

The only thing she could for the moment do was to inherit the first part of the legacy.

Nursing fury and regret, Kayafollet closed her eyes and fully activated the cultivation technique she had found in the ancient corpse to compete with Su Ping and the young Chaos Beast for the energy.

The energy reserve was supposed to be hers, but now she had to fight for it. Her frustration was reaching new heights.

What abundant energy. All the stars in the Chaos Star Chart in my body can be replaced with chaos stars!

Su Ping condensed the chaos energy to form stars. His own astral ocean and his cells had already been filled up. He would have to rise to the Astral Body State or condense chaos energy into stars so he could absorb more chaos energy.

The second option was undoubtedly what Su Ping went for.

The Astral Paintings in his body became more brilliant and even underwent unknown changes as the chaos stars were condensed one after the other, replacing the stars previously formed with astral power.

Su Ping immediately felt that his body had been filled with an aggressive power when the first Astral Painting was fully upgraded. It seemed that he could cut everything by invoking that stream of power; he would even be able to destroy Dao Patterns.

This Astral Painting is a hundred times more powerful.

Su Ping was quite thrilled by the unexpected turn of events. He was suddenly reminded of the technique’s actual name, realizing why it was named Chaos Star Chart. It turned out that it would ultimately require the power of chaos. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

That was what the technique was truly about.

Su Ping held back his excitement and continued with his power absorption and condensing stars for the second Astral Painting.

Time flew.

Su Ping was quick to absorb the power. One chaos-powered star was condensed after the other, replacing the previous stars in the Astral Painting.

The second Astral Painting was soon renovated with chaos stars. Its new functions delighted him.

The third came later, then the fourth…

He suddenly heard a roar when he was in the process of condensing the sixth Astral Painting. He couldn’t help but open his eyes and watch.

Kayafollet-facing him—also opened her eyes. Her fury was rekindled at the sight of Su Ping, but she didn’t say a thing; she only looked at the source of the roar.

Dumbfoundment filled her eyes after a quick glance.

The fat chaos creature was surrounded by a storm of chaotic energy, which was only a bit smaller than the one she had drawn.

“Huh?”

Su Ping was stunned by the changes of his pet and the thoughts conveyed through their bond.

The young Chaos Beast is about to make a breakthrough?

He observed the fat creature wrapped in chaos power; he didn’t stop it this time. He had previously been wary that its foundation wouldn’t be steady, back when the little one was rising at a fast speed. However, it had already spent decades roaming in cultivation sites along with him, and had already consolidated its gains.

The pet no longer held back upon realizing that Su Ping approved, suddenly letting out a loud and proud roar.

The roar seemed to have made it grow in one go; the creature used to sound like a naughty kid in the past, but now its call was proud and solemn.

The surrounding chaos energy poured into the young Chaos Beast’s body like a waterfall. Kayafollet realized what the pet was trying to do, which shocked and angered her, not expecting that Su Ping would truly allow his pet to steal her energy to achieve a breakthrough How much energy will it absorb to advance?

The energy was supposed to be mine!

Kayafollet was so infuriated that her heart was trembling and bleeding. However, rationality suppressed all impulsiveness. She quickly withdrew her gaze and focused on digesting the legacy.

I wonder if it’s possible to invoke a Heavenly Tribulation inside this ancient corpse…

Su Ping didn’t stop. He observed the legacy space while continuously absorbing the chaos energy and observing his soon to advance pet.
