Chapter 1444 Conception (2)

The darkness before Su Ping’s eyes suddenly disappeared, and he saw an unforgettable scene. Down below was a world of chaos, with the chaos aura fluctuating everywhere. At the center of the chaos aura was an item that looked like a flower.

There was a meatball at the center of the flower-like item, which had strange, slightly waving limbs.

Su Ping could tell it was an unusual living creature, possibly born from chaos.

“That’s the core of the Divine Eye,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon in a low voice. “It’s a special chaos creature. The divine power you see is just the accumulation of impurities released when the thing was conceived.”

Dazed, Su Ping stared at the wiggling body and felt that his blood was curdling. The Divine Eye was a womb to conceive this thing?

“The gods consider themselves superior; little do they know that they’re mere accumulations of impurities.” There was disdain and mockery in the beast’s eyes, as if he also looked down on the gods; the feeling also bone-deep.

Su Ping didn’t know what to say; that scene was just too shocking. He couldn’t help but ask, “Senior, are all the Divine Eyes in the world of gods conceiving those creatures? What will they become after they’re born?”

“I don’t know. I’ve never seen any of them being born. This thing will probably never be born. Countless years have passed and this thing has never changed. Maybe this is what it looks like, and it’s already been born,” said the dragon elder.

Exactly at that moment—the chaos creature in the flower seemed to have noticed something. Dozens of cracks appeared on the flower’s surface. They turned out to be eyes that were staring at Su Ping and the Chaos Perception Dragon.

The next moment, a strange and hoarse roar was heard, and the rays of chaos darted out of those eyeballs. The dragon was already prepared, quickly pulling Su Ping away and saying, “It’s angry. We’re already old friends; why is it so hostile?”

While speaking, he slapped the flower with its bloody claw, but the force pierced into the flower and was seemingly absorbed.

“Just as I thought,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon, “This thing is rooted in the world of chaos and any attacks received would be transferred to this world. To some extent, it is invincible; that’s why I warned you not to come here at first.”

Su Ping didn’t expect such a monster to be conceived in the Divine Eye. He had mixed feelings, thinking that the Heavens were tricky enough; now he learned of another deep secret.

“Do the Ancestral Gods know what this is?”

The dragon gave a slight head shake. “It’s both an artifact and a living creature from the age of chaos. Perhaps it was left by some big shot from that era. Maybe it was a weapon of theirs, or a descendant even. All in all, this isn’t something we can handle, unless we can reach that legendary level.”

Su Ping was quite solemn. A Sorcerer Ancestor?

Maybe he could ask the Golden Crow ancestor for more information. It was one of the Sorcerer Ancestors, one of the most powerful lives ever. It would certainly know something.

“The only way to destroy this thing is to destroy the entire world of gods, but that’s impossible,” said the dragon, “Although our attacks can break the barrier of the world of gods, it’s only part of it; the world can recover quickly. It would be pointless, as our destruction is not as fast as the world’s recovery. It cannot be destroyed unless all the Ancestral Gods gather and attack in a crazy manner.

“These Divine Eyes are the power sources in the world of gods. The seven greatest clans who control the seven Divine Eyes must have studied them a lot, but I’m not interested and I don’t know much.”

Su Ping asked curiously, “Why have no gods come to occupy this Divine Eye? Is it because of you?”

“It’s partly because of me, but mainly because of the local environment. The Divine Eye can’t be relocated. If any clan wants to control this Divine Eye, the clan would have to be here, or the Divine Eye would be of little use to them.”

The dragon added, “This is the desolate area at the border of the world that’s home to ferocious beasts. Any clan that moves here will be destroyed before they can benefit from the Divine Eye.”

Su Ping could agree, as he remembered the God Emperor monsters found all over the place.

The Chaos Perception Dragon looked at the growling monster in the flower and said casually, “Let’s go. This thing is getting angrier.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He then led Su Ping out of the area and retreated.

The latter could tell how the dragon was acting vigilant. It seemed that the thing was not only invincible in defense but also terrifying when it came to offense.

They quickly exited the Divine Eye.

“There are many more Divine Eyes in the borderlands like this one, still unclaimed. They’re found in regions teeming with beasts, too many for the gods to handle,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon, “The Divine Eyes occupied by the seven greatest clans happen to be in great locations. There were a lot of competitions over those seven Divine Eyes.”

The dragon seemed to be reminiscing as he spoke.

Su Ping smiled. “Senior, you seem to know a lot about the gods.”

“Of course,” said the other, “One of the clans even asked me for help when they competed over the Divine Eye. They have yet to return the favor. I would have asked them for help if two more gods would have shown up today.”

The creature seemed to be smiling after seeing surprise on Su Ping’s face. “Don’t think that we’re diehard enemies just because we’re called the Four Ferocious Beasts. With enough benefits, any two people can become allies and friends even. That’s why the four of us have been able to live as long.

“Of course, you have to be strong enough too; otherwise, your so-called friends will betray you in the blink of an eye.”

“Yes, you’re right, senior.”

Su Ping felt he had learned something. One of the seven greatest clans had actually teamed up with the ferocious beast once. Justice was indeed a mere excuse to fool stupid people.

“Let’s go. Time to move,” said the dragon.

He then glanced at the demonic ape and ordered. “Go back to where you’re from.”

“Boss, please forgive me,” begged the demonic ape.

The dragon snorted and said, “Get lost!” “Boss, have you forgiven me?”

“Get lost!”

“Thank you very much, Boss!” Thrilled, the demonic ape hopped and disappeared.

Su Ping felt puzzled. How exactly did that creature conclude that he had been forgiven based on two exact same phrases?

The Chaos Perception Dragon didn’t dawdle. He teleported with Su Ping in tow.

Time and terrain changed. Su Ping followed the Chaos Perception Dragon and crossed an infinitely long distance and then found themselves in a desolate area. The dragon stopped and looked around with satisfaction. “I’ll settle down in this place; you may find me here in the future.”

Right after he said that, a furious roar came from the distance.

Then, dark clouds surged in the sky and blocked the sun.

When they moved closer, Su Ping saw it was a giant beast that looked like a combination of an eagle and a dragon. It had a snake tail that stretched tens of thousands of kilometers. Its claws were so sharp that they could easily tear off a mountain.

“Bastard, who dares to break into my territory?” said an angry, high-pitched voice. But then the beast seemed to have clearly noticed it was the Chaos Perception Dragon. It stopped abruptly and then flew away at an even higher speed.

Su Ping could tell it was an Ancestral God beast too. He had expected a fierce battle, but he didn’t expect the creature to give in that quickly.

Looks like there are a lot more Ancestral God beasts in the world of gods aside from the Four Ferocious Beasts, Su Ping thought. “Humph. It ran fast enough; I do happen to be hungry.” The Chaos Perception Dragon snorted and lay down next to a mountain, before he said to Su Ping, “Don’t you like to practice? Go hunting and get me some food.”

Su Ping was rather lost for words as he saw the big guy’s lazy look. He had previously acted cold and aloof, rarely talking to the former. But the battle changed things, as the fellow kept teaching him and telling him secrets of the world of gods. He was actually not as taciturn as he seemed.
