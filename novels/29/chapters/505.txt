Chapter 507 Communication

Su Ping bit his teeth. He turned around, his back to the outer wall, to the battle pet warriors there. He made eye contact with the Otherworld Heavenly King. Su Ping instructed the Inferno Dragon to fight the plant beast king; not to defeat it, just to stall it.

He had to be the one facing the Heavenly King.

The Inferno Dragon was at the seventh-rank rank, while its combat strength was at the Ocean State. However, it would not stand a chance against a Heavenly King. On the other hand, he would be able to protect himself with the help of the dragon king’s treasures.

Come on! Su Ping made up his mind. Bolts of lightning flashed around him and he used the Eyes of Thunder to capture the Heavenly King’s movement. He wanted to catch its attention first, and then provoke it, using himself as bait to lure it all the way to his store. That was the only way he would be able to finish the Otherworld Heavenly King!

Roar!!

The Inferno Dragon looked at Su Ping as he dashed away. Eventually, the Inferno Dragon had to follow Su Ping’s orders due to the bond of the contract. The dragon pet began to run toward the plant beast king.

Su Ping could not get distracted to give more orders to the Inferno Dragon; he had to focus solely on the Heavenly King.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, the Heavenly King’s blood-red eye changed color. Alerted, Su Ping split into two and dashed to two different sides.

Bang!

A beam of dark colored light penetrated Su Ping, but the image was dispersed.

That was the fake one!

Su Ping was stunned. That beam came too quickly. He was barely able to dodge in time, even with the Solar Bulwark and the Eyes of Thunder!

Astral powers surged in Su Ping’s body. He extended his hands, and lightning flashed at his fingertips, instantly forming a thunder bow. An arrow made up by lighting was manifested. Su Ping aimed at the vertical pupil of the Heavenly King and released the arrow.

Boom!

The arrow dashed out with a loud noise, reaching the Heavenly King.

Before the arrow could reach the eye, a dark red barrier stopped the arrow which then broke apart. The lightning flashed over the barrier and dispersed.

Like he had anticipated, his strike was of little effect. After all, that was just a ninth-rank skill.

Suddenly, a glaring red light burst out from the Heavenly King’s eye. Su Ping was ghastly pale from fright.

Run!

He dashed around quickly, so quickly that he left after images. However, the dark-colored beam of light caught up with him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The strike didn’t make him feel pain, all thanks to the treasures he had. Still, the impact made him lose control of his body. He fell to the ground. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Whoosh!

Su Ping flew up right after.

The Heavenly King didn’t attack. That huge eye turned to gaze at Su Ping.

Su Ping didn’t stop. He had to provoke it, make it hunt him down so that his plan would work.

Thunder Prison!

A column of lightning bolts appeared above the Heavenly King. That lightning column came crashing down, turning into many individual bolts of lightning

The hidden dark red barrier appeared again; the lightning column was rendered useless.

Su Ping wore a grave look. That Heavenly King was most likely at the Fate State. If that was the case, he would be in fatal danger, even with the old dragon king’s treasures.

“Human... why do you have such a primitive and vast sense in you?”

All of a sudden, Su Ping heard an indifferent, odd, and hoarse voice in his mind.

Su Ping was surprised.

Was it the Otherworld Heavenly King? At the moment, Su Ping couldn’t think of other beings that were able to speak directly to his mind.

His spirit was strong, close to the ninth-rank. Only beast kings would be able to penetrate his spirit and establish a telepathic conversation.

Since communication was on the table, Su Ping’s hope was rekindled. “Are you the Otherworld Heavenly King? Why are you attacking us? Can you stop? I can give you something else as compensation.”

He knew he sounded quite childish.

However, he prefered to be direct with beasts. In the Heavenly King’s perspective, striking the Longjiang Base City was just a way to procure food. What was the difference between eating humans and eating wild beasts? Su Ping could find other ways to satisfy the Heavenly King’s appetite.

“Stop...

“You puny humans are just as laughable as usual. You begin to beg at the slightest trace of hope,” that voice said, arrogantly.

Su Ping was ghastly pale from fright.

That voice had just admitted being the Otherworld Heavenly King.

The Heavenly King had stopped attacking him.

“If you want food, I can take you somewhere else and you can eat up anything you want. I can feed you with piles of beast kings or anything else you want!” Su Ping continued, “Trust me, whichever choice that is, it’ll be much easier and better than going on a killing spree here.”

“Funny human being.”

The Heavenly King didn’t answer him. Unhurriedly, it continued, “I can tell that your astral powers are at the seventh-rank, not even the ninth-rank, but you can fight like a beast king. You must be the most interesting human being I have ever seen in the two thousand years that I’ve lived.”

Su Ping was stunned. Two thousand years?

If a person wanted to live up to two thousand years, a breakthrough to the Fate State was needed!

But things were different for wild beasts. Some Ocean State beast kings could live for a few thousand years while some wild beasts at the Fate State could only live for a couple of hundred years.

The Otherworld Heavenly King had lived for two thousand years. Whichever state it was at, it had lived through a terrifyingly long period.

“You have many secrets in you. My original plan was to kill, but now I see that capturing you is more interesting than killing you.” The Heavenly King adopted a soft tone. Its voice was even a little bit enticing.

To his surprise, Su Ping noticed that the Heavenly King’s eye was contracting. That was a sign that it was going to release a skill.

Su Ping wasn’t sure if he should be afraid or happy. He was partly afraid since his life was in danger but happy because he had managed to get the Heavenly King’s attention.

The next step was to run!

As fast as he could!

Whoosh!

Without further ado, Su Ping turned around and ran.

Since the Heavenly King wanted to capture him alive, he would run, luring it to chase him.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

When Su Ping had just started moving, all of a sudden, bright red vines full of thorns suddenly shot out from the ground. The extremely thick and seemingly ever-growing vines reached toward him.

Run!

Su Ping bellowed. He used up all of his strength as he dashed toward the outer wall. He wished he had more than two legs.
