Chapter 249 Doubts

“Is this the Pixie Pet Store?”

“Yes, it is. Look at the sign.” “Dear god! Look at the two statues. I almost thought they were two real dragons!”

“Me, too. Damn! Take a look at that golden-haired girl. She is incredible!”

A crowd of young people arrived. The two dragon statues had caught their attention just as they reached the door. After they stepped into the store, their attention soon shifted to Joanna.

She was exquisite.

She had a curvy build and breathtakingly beautiful facial features. This had to be what fairies looked like.

They had never seen someone so beautiful, not even on TV. For a moment there, no one was able to move a muscle.

As for Tang Ruyan... no one darted a second look at her, as if she were transparent to them.

Tang Ruyan was pretty and graceful, but going by human standards. Contrary to her, Joanna was like an artifact created by god. She was flawless. Perfection was the only word that could be used on her.

Some of the boys were forgetting themselves. They lost themselves in Joanna’s eyes that seemed too distant and yet filled with stories.

The so-called “love at first sight” was when people were charmed by the unique look that appealed to them.

After all, no one could “fall in love at first sight” of the ugly.

The female customers found it hard to be envious of Joanna’s prettiness. Instead, they felt ashamed of themselves.

Tang Ruyan was surprised and angry that all the customers’ attention had been focused on Joanna.

Of course, Tang Ruyan was well-aware that she was a little bit at a disadvantage when it came to competing in looks with Joanna. Indeed.

Just a little bit.

At least that was how Tang Ruyan saw it.

Besides, she wasn’t embarrassed for not looking as good as Joanna. It wasn’t like she was a trophy girl. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Tang Ruyan took a deep breath.

She kept a straight face; she stepped forward and said to a young man, “Hi.”

She thought she was doing the young man an honor by taking the initiative to greet him.

The young man stood on his tiptoes.

Tang Ruyan frowned. “You...”

“Stop talking. You’re in my way!”

Before Tang Ruyan could finish her words, the young man had interrupted her, annoyed. To this young man’s dismay, he realized that this girl was quite tall. Even as he stood on tiptoes, he was still unable to see that golden-hair girl that he was suddenly obsessed with. Being interrupted from his appreciation of the golden-hair girl was a waste of time, even for a single second.

Tang Ruyan could not believe this.

How dare this man shout at her?!

Was he courting death?!!

She was fuming with rage. She was about to do something when she noticed that the young man had lost his patience and ran past her.

All the other males were running past her as well. They gathered around Joanna and chatted with her, trying to get her contact info.

Tang Ruyan turned over. There was a huge crowd around Joanna while there was no one near her. Instantly, Tang Ruyan turned pale from extreme anger.

“Hi, I heard that you could guarantee a place in the Elite League’s Top 100. Is that true?” a short-haired girl in a leather jacket asked Tang Ruyan.

Tang Ruyan turned around. She was glad that, finally, someone had noticed her. She looked into the girl’s eyes so that she could take a good look at her face, while she said with her eyes, “That is right. This is me. I am Tang Ruyan!”

The eye contact continued.

One second... two seconds... The short-haired girl suddenly raised her eyebrows and put on a flirty grin. She put one arm around Tang Ruyan’s shoulder and said, “Are you free tonight? Do you want to grab a drink at Rose’s? My treat.”

...

A bulky young man approached the counter with a frown and asked Su Ping who was sitting here, “Who is the boss here?”

“I am.” Su Ping looked at the young man who appeared to be a sixth rank battle pet warrior, the same as him. “How can I help you? We offer pet training services and more.”

“You are the boss?”

The young man was surprised. He went there after he saw the ad. He had thought that a store that could hire a celebrity like Mu Shuangwan had to be resourceful and wealthy. It came as a shock to him that the boss was such a boy. The bulky young man frowned. He didn’t think that the boy was joking about this matter; such a joke could get him fired if the real boss knew, provided that there was a real boss.

“I saw the ad that if I train my pet here, you can guarantee that I can get into Top 100 of the Elite League. Is that true?” the young man questioned. He didn’t linger on the issue whether Su Ping was the actual boss or not. Since he was there, he was willing to try out the training

Su Ping nodded. “That is right. If you choose the professional training services here, I promise that you can get into Top 100 of the Elite League!”

The young man stared at Su Ping. “What if I can’t make it to the Top 100?”

“That is impossible,” Su Ping answered. That was bold. Su Ping was unexpectedly confident. At first, the young man only regarded Su Ping as an average teenager. However, those words reflected that Su Ping was not average, and there was something unique about him.

“Don’t brag. There is always an exception. You sound confident, but do you know what it will take to make it to Top 100? Do you know what kind of strength is needed?” The young man sounded serious.

Naturally, Su Ping had done his research. “According to the results of the past three Elite Leagues, in the Longjiang Base City, those between the Top 80 to the 100s are basically those at the intermediate position of the seventh rank. That is a conclusion I reached after I saw the data. To be safe, with a strength at the upper position of the seventh rank, you are pretty much guaranteed to land a spot among the Top 100.”

The young man was surprised to see that Su Ping had done his homework. Still, he wasn’t happy about Su Ping’s tone. “You make it sound so easy. Do you think the intermediate position of the seventh rank is easy to reach? What kind of pet do I have to provide for training?”

“Any pet, provided that it’s not at the first rank.” Su Ping smiled. “I may have to work against the clock if the pet is at the first

rank.”

The young man stared at Su Ping.

First rank?

Just working against the clock if the pet was at the first rank?

Su Ping made it sound like he could train a first-rank pet to be strong enough to participate in the Elite League. How full of himself Su Ping was!

The young man was not happy with this answer. He felt Su Ping was insulting him. “The Elite League is about to begin. How many pets can you train within such a short time? If I leave two pets with you, one at the third-rank and the other at the fifth, can you train them so that I can make it to the Top 100 in the Elite League?!”

The young man was not asking a question. He was accusing Su Ping. “Yes,” Su Ping answered right away.

The young man was stunned.

He had never seen anyone so confident in the world.

“The professional training is one million per session. As for the time, since you are the first one, you can pick up your pets tomorrow. If you’re not happy with the results, you can ask for a refund at any time. My store is here, and I have spent too much money on the promotion. It should be clear enough for you to understand that I wouldn’t run away after I accepted your money. Right?” Su Ping blurted out his answer quickly and kept his sharp gaze on the young man.

Su Ping realized that celebrity promotion alone would not work. His store’s reputation had not been established yet. Only after customers tried his service could they know that he was telling the truth.

Su Ping’s gaze startled the young man. Su Ping had demonstrated a level of confidence that the young man found hard to accept. Su Ping was not faking it. He indeed trusted his work.

A moment of silence later, the young man took a deep breath. He gazed at Su Ping and asserted coldly, “One million per session. The price is not cheaper than the service offered in Primo. Did you just say that the training will be done tomorrow?

“Hmm, I’m interested to see the effects. If the training fails, I will smash your store and you can close it for good tomorrow!”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. “I can understand that you have doubts about my services. Listen, what if you find my training satisfactory?” Su Ping managed to remain composed.

The young man sneered. “If you can make me happy, I will apologize to you in public. Hell, I will even tell all my friends to come here. They are all battle pet warriors!”

“I will even invite my teacher to come! He is a titled battle pet warrior!”

“Deal!”

Su Ping nodded.
