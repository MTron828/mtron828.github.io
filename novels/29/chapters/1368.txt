Chapter 1369 War Outburst (1)

“Even if the universe is intelligent and is specifically avoiding our area, I don’t think that would last long. There are some signs of merger in some places at the border…” Shen Huang said, “In any case, we do our best and prepare.”

“All right.”

Su Ping nodded.

Shen Huang wanted to say something else, but he suddenly changed his expression, as if he were listening to something. His expression turned grave.

“What’s wrong?” Su Ping narrowed his eyes.

“There was an accident.”

Shen Huang finally replied half a minute later. He stood up with an awful expression. “The report just came in: a fortress at the border just collapsed. There was some sort of power that destroyed it straightaway, and it kept on invading. Worms are also swarming in. This is a feed of the current situation.”

He waved a hand and displayed a scene.

In a space fortress-countless remains of both humans and pets were floating in space. The rubble leftover from the fortress was next to them; worms were flooding in.

Su Ping saw a lot of golden-armored worms and even the purple-armored kind at the rear. There weren’t many of them, but their purple color was quite eye-catching; their bodies were enormous.

“Celestial worm kings!” Su Ping slightly changed his expression. The worms had assaulted many places, but the purple-armored worm kings had rarely appeared. Lots of them had gathered to destroy one fortress. Were they going to launch a joint attack?

Humans had discovered over the years that the worms were as smart as ordinary adults. Some of the worm kings were exceptionally cunning.

......

Su Ping had tamed Greeny as a pet, and knew fully well that those insects were intelligent. His first thought was that attacking the fortress by surprise was the worms’ strategy.

“Damn it!”

Shen Huang wore an awful expression. Part of his consciousness was connected to the command room on the Astral Nexus. Someone posted in the front line was reporting. However, the information made him feel panicked.

The fortress’ destruction had nothing to do with the worm kings; it had been done by an invisible power.

The place was completely unable to resist, and was instantly destroyed; countless people were instantly ripped apart.

Said power was at the moment surging towards the second line of defense behind the fortress, and was unstoppable. Those who tried to stop it were killed without exception!

Who would have thought that such an urgent situation would take place at the front line?

“Xiao Su, I may have to ask Kayafollet to go there.”

Shen Huang listened to the battle reports. He didn’t have to command in person; many emergency measures had been taken by the military commanders. Hot weapons that could threaten Ascendants were deployed on the battlefield to suppress the worms.

In addition, the reinforcing Ascendant cultivators had set up military formations to stop the enemy; alas, the result was not ideal.

“She’s yours to command.”

Su Ping didn’t know what was going on in the front lines, but his body tightened, seeing how serious his master was.

The previous deduction was that the war would last a thousand years. Or rather, humans would have to endure for a thousand years. However, war was never as predictable as data. Accidents could happen at any time.

The alien lurking among the worms in particular, was an uncontrollable factor. It could destroy all defense lines immediately if it ever took action.

Shen Huang summoned Kayafollet via telepathy, who rose from one of the buildings on that street and flashed over.

She looked at Shen Huang and Su Ping respectfully. The Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin had essentially been killed and replaced with another personality, ever since Su Ping tampered with her memories.

Shen Huang immediately ordered her to stop the worms along with the soldiers in the front line.

Chi Huo and Xu Kong arrived after she left; both of them looked anxious. Chi Huo said, “The Anmu Fortress was destroyed. The second line of defense there is also under attack and will soon be broken through. There are six worm kings there; do we need to take action?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Shen Huang said gloomily, “Six worm kings. Those are all the worm kings we’ve detected recently. They want to tear the defense lines apart, once and for all. However, the report I just received suggests that the fortresses weren’t destroyed by them. I think the alien did it; just wait until they reach the fifth defense line.”

Xu Kong’s cute face was cold. She said, “Are those worms trying to go all out? They never attacked so fiercely before. Did something stimulate them?”

Shen Huang and Su Ping looked at each other, as they were immediately reminded of the universal merging they had just talked about. Was it going to affect the real world that soon?

“I will send someone to the border of our star zone and investigate the merging, just to find out how bad it is,” said Shen Huang quickly. Meanwhile, he reached out telepathically to another department and sent out the order.

“The merging of the universe…”

Both Chi Huo and Xu Kong knew about that phenomenon. Their faces didn’t look very good.

“Ask the other Celestials to meet with us immediately. Also, have the third defense line send battle reports right now. I want all the information we can gather about the enemy!” Shen Huang gave the order.

Chi Huo nodded. “I’ll relay this to the other Celestials right now.”

He disappeared after saying that.

Half a minute passed. The Celestials flashed to that place, one after the other.

Meanwhile, Shen Huang had reached out to the third defense line. The second defense line was too busy fighting to respond. The intelligence analysis job could only be entrusted to the following defensive checkpoint.

They had considered such an arrangement since the beginning, when they planned all defensive measures. So, the reconnaissance system of each defense line could cover the range of the previous two defense lines.
