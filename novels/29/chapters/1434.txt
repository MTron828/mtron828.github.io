Chapter 1435 Madness (1)

“You cunning gods, I won’t spare you!”

The demonic ape also stood up, feeling embarrassed and ashamed. It had gone there to report, but its actions guided the enemies over, getting its boss in danger.

“Don’t say that we’re cunning. It’s just you being too simpleminded.” The alluring Ancestral Goddess chuckled. “This is wisdom, which is part of us. Although you might not have it, you can’t prevent us from using it.”

Su Ping stepped up and said loudly, “Ancestral Gods, you’re the exalted ancestors of your respective clans. Is it fair to fight two with the six of you?”

“Who do you think you are to question us?” said an Ancestral God, who then urged the Rain Ancestor, “Finish him off already. I would have obliterated him if he wasn’t the Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute. They didn’t even check his bloodline; it is truly getting worse and worse.”

“Don’t intervene. Just hide somewhere.” The Chaos Perception Dragon spoke to Su Ping via telepathy, then stood in front of him. Its power surged and covered the young man with a vortex-like barrier.

“Senior, you tried it before; I can’t be killed, not even by you. There’s no need to protect me. It would only distract you,” said Su Ping right after.

The Chaos Perception Dragon’s eyes glittered. “They’ll probably unfold some sort of ancient array to isolate you from the world. Are you sure the existence backing you can still shelter you?”

“Yes!” said Su Ping.

The protective vortex was slowly dispelled. The Chaos Perception Dragon didn’t insist; he only said with a cold tone, “You’d better not die, or that kid will be mine.”

Su Ping felt warmth conveyed in those words. His heart felt hot as he smiled. “I will never let it come to harm. Senior, be careful!”

Boom. The six Ancestral Gods attacked fiercely; the void exploded all of a sudden.

The aftershock of the violent explosion was spread out. Su Ping resisted the effect with all his might. He summoned the Dark Dragon Hound and merged with it; a dog head appeared on his shoulder. Su Ping then said, “Let’s experience the Ancestral Gods’ power.”

“Howl!”

The Dark Dragon Hound roared, full of fighting will.

“Rot in hell!”

That cold voice was suddenly heard inside Su Ping’s consciousness, with a figure appearing out of nowhere and standing in front of Su Ping, feeling at home, as if he would have been there since the establishment of the universe. He was none other than the Rain Ancestor.

His eyes were cold and aggressive. His face was hidden; only his eyes were visible, full of coldness and killing intent.

Next, Su Ping felt that his entire body was frozen and all the Great Dao in the world was blocked. There was a special force field surrounding him, which kept on shrinking.

Is this the power of the Undying Universe?

A grand burst of light emerged from Su Ping’s eyes. He roared furiously, and his universe of chaos appeared behind his back. All the Great Dao found in its layers were manifested, transforming into a sharp sword.

The edge of that weapon had countless Great Daos and terrifying traits; it could slice and tear anything to pieces.

He waved his giant sword and brutally moved to slash the Ancestral God.

While entranced, Su Ping seemed to be back in the Heaven Path Institute’s arena. The Ancestral God’s shadow that Mo Feng, prince of the Rain Clan, had summoned almost made him collapse. Back then, the Ancestral God’s magnificent shadow had already imposed an unbearable pressure. He felt the great force on his back.

A long time passed; that Rain Clan prince was already dust by then. Now the challenge was to face the true body of the shadow he fought against in the past; the Rain Clan ancestor in the flesh. Su Ping swung his sword fiercely!

“Useless!”

Coldness flashed in the Rain Ancestor’s eyes. The power displayed surprised him and invoked his killing intent; he could not allow such a genius to thrive. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He suddenly understood why his clan’s God Emperors were executed in quick succession; the young man had a power exceeding that of normal God Emperors.

And all of this while being just a God King.

A finger suddenly pointed at the young man, and the giant sword came to a sudden stop. It shook and hummed; then, its edge collapsed into countless pieces.

All the condensed Great Daos were instantly disintegrated and shattered.

The Rain Ancestor had a deeper understanding of the Great Dao, allowing him to break Su Ping’s Great Dao with ease.

“You’d be just as useless in my eyes if we were on the same level!” Su Ping’s eyes almost collapsed. He became even angrier, as he glared back without an ounce of fear.

The Rain Ancestor’s eyes turned cold. He suddenly waved a hand

Su Ping instantly felt how a universe was crushing him. There seemed to be a world in his enemy’s fingers, which contained an unstoppable power.

He mustered all of his strength to gather the broken sword again and attack.

Concurrently, he used the Contract Dao Heart and drew the world’s power within a radius of 10,000 kilometers. A terrifying power fell into his control after the contract was established.

Su Ping expanded the range from 10,000 kilometers to 50,000 kilometers, almost reaching his limits.

“Go to hell!!” Su Ping roared, his body ablaze with golden flames.

Roar!!

Another roar was heard coming from Su Ping’s shoulder; it was the Dark Dragon Hound’s furious head. All its fur was standing at the moment, making it look like a ferocious wolf aiming to bite the enemy.

The sword was broken, along with the wolf’s sharp teeth. An arm suddenly approached and pierced Su Ping’s body.
