Chapter 1537: Ten Thousand Years of Cultivation (2)

Just as I thought. I was just polishing my wood that night; how could I transmigrate so easily… Besides, real transmigrations only happen in novels. How could it happen in reality? Unless… it was imposed by someone… Su Ping thought.

He asked, “There are many similarities between the history of the Blue Planet and that of Earth. They’re almost the same except for the different celebrities throughout history. You didn’t create the Blue Planet with a specific purpose, did you?”

The girl shook her head. “Of course not. I could have easily created one, that wasn’t necessary. There are countless planets in billions of universes. Let alone similar, it’s very simple to find a planet named Earth, even with the exact same history. You may find hundreds of planets named Earth with basically the same history.

“Evolution is basically the same after all, especially when it’s related to ordinary lives. They would naturally repeat the process from the primitive age to the industrial revolution.”

Su Ping was stunned for a moment.

!!

He knew that the system wasn’t wrong, but that also implied that there were too many universes in chaos; so many that it was easy to find another Earth.

The war he had to win concerned all the lives on those planets.

“Did you really pick me as the third host with a random draw? Don’t you have any requirements? For example, carrying some ancient bloodline? Or, was I the reincarnation of some Ancestral God?” Su Ping thought that it couldn’t have been that arbitrary.

“Ancestral Gods’ reincarnations aren’t so rare. I can easily create an Ancestral God; however, such creations are nothing special.”

The girl added casually, “I picked you randomly, but I knew you would achieve great things under my wing. On the contrary, if I went and specifically picked some genius with extraordinary intelligence, I might not have been able to fully bring out their strong suit.

“At the end of the day, it’s not potential but experience that matters in cultivation!

“Whether you’re smart or stupid in the beginning, you’ll be exactly what I want you to be after I give this experience to you.”

Su Ping was stunned. The system was exceptionally proud.

“Everything can be trained. The lives in this world may have thousands of faces, but most of them tend to use the same kind. The only thing that matters is the perspective you choose to understand them,” said the girl. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Su Ping sighed. “I thought you were captivated by my handsomeness.”

The girl rolled her eyes at Su Ping and said, “Your looks mean nothing to me. We don’t share the same aesthetics.

“I do agree that absolute beauty may have appeal across species.

“But you don’t have it.”

“Hehe.”

The girl was aware of Su Ping’s personality and left the matter at that. She said, “In the beginning I wanted to ask Ti Tuo to sign a contract with you as your pet. However, it’s not easy for him to come and join the war after the previous two failures; you can only count on those little buddies of yours. Fortunately, their performance isn’t too bad; at least they won’t drag you down.”

Su Ping was surprised by the previous plans. He looked at the young man in black, not expecting the system to try to persuade the fellow.

“I remember how Ling Tai was absorbed. It was so stupid; I won’t sign a contract with him.” Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo snorted and continued, “The contract is used to control subordinates. I don’t want to get involved with him in any way, especially regarding a consciousness bond.”

The girl heaved a sigh, as if recalling a matter in the past. She said to the now confused Su Ping. “The second host bonded with Sorcerer Ancestor Ling Tai. They practiced together a lot to improve their teamwork; however, they lost the war and the second host died. Ling Tai had a chance to escape…

Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo sneered and said, “However, he had to get himself killed. He said he would take back half the guy’s corpse, but only got himself killed in the end.

Su Ping was again surprised by the information, and could easily imagine how things unfolded.

The second host died. Sorcerer Ancestor Ling Tai—an expert that Su Ping had never met—charged to attack the Heavenly Dao to avenge him.

Su Ping understood the bond that was formed through a contract; it was the connection between two souls. Once two parties bonded with a contract, their minds would become engaged and they would inevitably develop feelings for each other, unless it was a pet completely disinterested about their master.

“Emotion is harmful. That’s what killed Ling Tai,” said Ti Tuo coldly, “It’s not just me. The other three won’t do something that stupid, either.”

Su Ping glanced at the latter; he was obviously scared he would do the same as Sorcerer Ancestor Ling Tai did.

“That’s all right. I’ll be by your side,” said the girl to Su Ping.

He then looked back at the system and her clear eyes, suddenly realizing that the system was the one that had accompanied him for the longest time.

No matter when or where, she was always with him.

Su Ping gazed at the system and said, “The so-called system binding between you and me should be a pet contract, right? It’s just that you’re the master while I stand in as a pet…”

The girl also stared back as she replied, “That’s right. I helped you in the same way you train your pets.”

“Then, why can’t I feel what’s on your mind?” asked Su Ping immediately.

“Because I shielded it,” said the girl, “I’m the Mother of Chaos. My mind is too vast and magnificent; you’d only find it unbearable and go crazy if I left it open. You’re too weak to bear it even right now. I won’t remove the shielding until you get the Chaos Qualification and become a Sorcerer Ancestor.”

Su Ping understood, yet the situation gave him mixed feelings.

He felt somewhat angry and weird.

He had trained the Little Skeleton, the Dark Dragon Hound and his other pets and considered himself an excellent battle pet warrior. He never expected to actually be someone else’s pet.

This particular ‘someone else’ was the Mother of Chaos, the very first life that ever existed, but he still felt weird.

He didn’t feel uncomfortable about it, though, because he never thought that pets were inferior to their masters.

The contract was not about superiority; it was a bond of equals.

However, one party would take the lead due to the difference in strength.

In other words, Su Ping became the pet, now that the system had truly awakened and took hold of her original power. He had been the system’s master in the past.

That was why he was called “the host.”

“Did you ask this Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo to gather the refugees from all universes to this place?” asked Su Ping.

The girl nodded. “It already began when the third war ended.”

“However, the way they are managing things here is rather chaotic,” said Su Ping, “Can such an unorganized mob really unite against the Heavenly Dao?”

“That’s not for you to worry about. When the time comes, I’ll put them in my universe and use their bodies as strength. They must participate in the war, even if they’re unwilling!” said Sorcerer Ancestor Ti Tuo coldly.

Su Ping frowned. “What do you mean? Are you saying that you’d use them as fuel?”

“Fuel? Good analogy. That’s basically it,” said the unemotional Sorcerer Ancestor. “It’s what they’re born for. I’m making the best use of them.”

Su Ping said in a somber tone, “But they’re alive! They’re living creatures!”

“This is exactly how lives should be used. Or do they have some special meaning to you?” Ti Tuo gave Su Ping an unhappy look. He could sense the latter’s fury, but he found it ridiculous. “To put it simply, rocks, metals and lives, each has their own prices; lives are 5, metals are 2, and rocks are 1.”

“Only living creatures see themselves as priceless, compared to rocks and metals. However, all of them are objects in our eyes.”

“Not really.” Su Ping looked at him solemnly. “Lives are not priceless, but they shouldn’t be squandered, either. Besides, yours is the most extravagant usage method of all. They could be sharp blades on their own, but you regard them as fuel. Even if you consider them to be pieces of metal, you’re turning them into a mere handle, when they could be used to forge the edge of a blade!”
