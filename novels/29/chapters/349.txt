Chapter 351 Mysterious Girl

While the matches between the Top 10 went on, some senior guards were yawning at the borders of the Longjiang Base City.

They had grown tired of the invariable and desolate sight that they had to look at all day long.

Every now and then, some small beasts would come out of nowhere and put on a chasing show, which would be their “entertainment.”

It had been just another average day thus far, except for the ground which started to shake all of a sudden.

The laziness and tiredness was cleared away from their faces; they immediately focused their minds and tried to trace the source of the disturbance.

The vibration was approaching them swiftly. Soon, from the horizon, a huge figure that was over a dozen meters tall came running along.

One of the guards used a telescope to look. It was a ninth-rank dragon!

A dragon that had reached adulthood!

Still in shock, the guard suddenly noticed some people were sitting on the dragon’s head. This was not a wild dragon. It had a master.

While the guard was still looking into the telescope, his commander suddenly jumped out.

“Open the gates and prepare to welcome our guests,” the commander said at once.

The guards sprang to action. It seemed that their commander knew who was coming and those people had to be important.

Soon, the dragon arrived.

The guards stepped back and the gate made of stones found deep in the ocean was slowly pushed open. All the guards stood in line to salute the people arriving. Besides them, all the commanders, including a general, had also shown up to wait for their guests.

The dragon slowed down in front of them.

Four people were on top of the dragon’s head. A middle-aged man and a senior jumped off. They visibly slowed down as they approached the ground, landing softly. This action even surprised the commanders; the general was the only man who managed to keep calm and wear a smile.

“Thank you.” The old man smiled. He had a hunched back.

“You’re welcome. Our mayor has prepared a banquet for you.” The general smiled. He secretly stole a glance at the other two who were still on the head of the dragon.

Both were girls but one of them had to be the maid because she was standing behind the other girl with respect.

The girl sitting at the edge of the dragon’s head was wearing a scarlet dress. She had a perfectly delicate face but there was some coldness in her eyes; her face was also devoid of expression on her face. She kept on gazing into the distance, not deigning to look at the guards even once.

The general didn’t show any unhappiness, as he had been briefed about the girl’s identity. It was normal that she wouldn’t greet him because she had seen more than enough titled battle pet warriors.

The general inwardly heaved a sigh while maintaining that smile on his face. “This way, please. We have prepared vehicles for you.”

The old man nodded. “Thank you, general, but our lady often gets car sick. We’ll just head in like this.”

Carsick?

The general was speechless. What a crappy excuse. You could just say that you didn’t want to come down.

Of course, the general didn’t say those words out loud. “It might not be convenient to be moving about with a dragon while in the city. How about you take my battle pet instead?”

The old man frowned and thought about the proposal. “My lady, what do you think?” he asked the girl. The girl finally removed her gaze from the distance and cast a look at the general. “Sure,” she said after a moment of silence.

The old man was relieved. He nodded to the general.

The general curled his lips. He was a bit upset; not everyone was able to ride his battle pet. He was actually inviting them, having to adapt to their moods while seeking their approval.

Though offended, the general hid his emotions well; he summoned his battle pet immediately. It was a ninth-rank Storm Hawk, a pet of the wind family with a violent character.

As soon as the Storm Hawk came out, it began to flap its wings, stirring up dust. The girl suddenly hopped onto the pet’s back,

Startled, the general hurried to comfort his Storm Hawk lest it would deem the girl an enemy.

Still, the general was too late. The moment the girl was hopping over, the Storm Hawk had already been enraged. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As the girl landed on its back, the Storm Hawk began to gather rich wind elements, with the intent to tear the girl apart.

Suddenly, the girl placed one hand on the back of the Storm Hawk and said one word.

“Halt!”

There seemed to be some ripples spreading from the girl’s delicate hand.

The Storm Hawk’s feathers trembled and the ground under its feel was also shaking.

Then, the heavy wind instantly died down, until it vanished without a trace.

The general could not believe this.

Did the girl just stop the Storm Hawk’s killing intent?!

That was astonishing. His Storm Hawk had already reached the ninth-rank and was three ranks higher than the girl. How could she contain the hawk?!

Still, the elder and the middle-aged man didn’t seem to be surprised at all. They had gotten used to it. They just showed a grin as they saw how stunned the general was.

The maid also jumped to the back of the Storm Hawk at this point, straight from the dragon’s head.

The old man made a grabbing gesture in the air and the huge dragon disappeared. “Sir, let’s go,” he said to the general.

The general came back to his senses but he was still flustered. So, the people from that place were like this?!

The general realized that the girl wasn’t minding him because of being overexposed to titled battle pet warriors. It was because she herself might have the ability of a titled battle pet warrior!

The general calmed himself down from his shock. He understood that he had embarrassed himself with that reaction. Without further ado, he hopped onto the Storm Hawk to join the others.

Before they took off, the general said to his commanders and soldiers, “Make sure you guard the borders. I’ll be right back.”

They saluted and shouted their agreement.

The round of matches had reached an end. The winners from the sixth to the tenth places had been settled.

Ye Hao was number eight and Su Yanying was number nine.

Number ten was taken by a battle pet warrior who was said to have been pursuing high grades in his studies.

Number seven was an explorer who had graduated from an academy a long time before.

Number six was the young man from the Zhou Family. That young man was not as powerful as Xu Kuang or Su Lingyue, but he could easily best the other participants. He had been demonstrating an overwhelming advantage at each turn.

His battle pets were qualified. His own skills, command, and strategy were all commendable.

Many people could tell that he had saved up some energy. Otherwise, he could have made it to the Top 5 and those matches would have been intense.

Night fell when the matches of the day ended.

Su Ping took Su Lingyue back home as soon as the matches ended, right after he said goodbye to Ye Hao and Su Yanying who went to see him.

Ye Hao and Su Yanying’s journey at the Elite League had reached an end. From then on, they could sit down and enjoy the matches as part of the audience.

“Mr. Su, I’ll be going to your store tomorrow,” Ye Hao informed Su Ping.

Xu Kuang’s win had provoked Ye Hao. Spending money? That was not a problem. He was from the Ye Family. Granted, he wasn’t one of the core disciples but he had been born in the immediate branch anyway. Besides, he had done well by entering the Top 10. He would be given many resources and would not be in want of money.

“Sure. Any time you want.” Su Ping nodded. He didn’t bother to think about the reason for Ye Hao’s unusual behavior.

Su Yanying forced a smile. She knew that Ye Hao was trying to compete with Xu Kuang.

She was becoming anxious by the thought that spending more money in Su Ping’s store would mean more strength.

She had been born in the shantytown area. She did come from a well-off upbringing, but her family could never compare with Ye Hao’s or Xu Kuang’s. She had to make money all by herself.

It was over 10 o’clock at night when they got back home.

Su Ping was constantly thinking about how to freeload through the Heaven’s Test so he grabbed a few bites and hurried back to his store. He didn’t give his mom any chance to ask him questions. Before he left, he also told Su Lingyue to take a good rest because the next day’s matches would be tough. She still had to compete in several and each of her opponents would be powerful, unlike before.

She could win all the way but that was not a reason to be relaxed; that was not a good habit.

Su Lingyue simply nodded without replying; she would obey him in every way when it came to cultivation and battle pets.

Su Ping left Su Lingyue at home to be bombarded by their mon’s praise and went back to his store. He closed the door and first went through the sorting of the pets the customers left in his store that day.

He placed the pets in different groups, picked out the two for professionals training, grabbed Joanna, and went to the Demigod Burial.
