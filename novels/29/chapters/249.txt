Chapter 252 Asking for Help

“Dude, I’ll have the general training, the one that costs one hundred thousand.”

“I’ll have a professional one. Sir, are you sure I can jump to the Top 100?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The customers approached Su Ping one by one, asking about the services and paying their bills.

With the Inferno Dragon there, none of the customers dared to underestimate this young man anymore. They were exercising great care even while posing their questions.

Someone did a rough calculation. This young store owner could show extraordinary talents at the Elite League of the Longjiang Base City and occupy a spot among the Top 100 with the Inferno Dragon alone.

He could even have a chance to make it to the Top 10.

Su Ping was young, which meant that his future was promising. He was a talent that no one should overlook.

The store remained in good order. Most of the customers were choosing the general training. After all, even people coming from a family with tens of millions in wealth couldn’t easily afford the one million. Spending that sum of money needed prudent deliberation.

Su Ping didn’t mind this. Professional training helped him make more money, but it was exhausting as well.

The dummy was able to handle the general training. But for the professional training, he would have to personally take over. Having finished the transactions, the customers left one by one.

The customers would still shake with fear as they passed by the door and saw the soundly sleeping Inferno Dragon near the steps. They chose to move to the other side of the staircase, lest they would wake this beast.

Su Lingyue was on her way to the store with her teacher Wu Guansheng. She had learned that it was the day the store was going to reopen from the promotions.

Never did she imagine that Su Ping could have invited a celebrity like Mu Shuangwan. Her past life had limited her view. She felt as if, overnight, their family had leaped forward to becoming a wealthy one, straight from their previous average life. She found this shift surreal.

When Wu Guansheng followed Su Lingyue to the store and saw the Inferno Dragon by the door, fright overwhelmed him. He had witnessed the terrifying power exhibited by the golden-hair girl. To his astonishment, she wasn’t the only deterrent power at the store. There was also this Inferno Dragon.

The dragon’s existence was not as stunning as a legendary battle pet warrior. Nevertheless, it was a rare sight.

Wu Guansheng had grown more scared of Su Ping and the connections he had.

They went into the store and saw how everyone was queueing properly, which was not a surprise for Su Lingyue. Whenever the store was packed, the customers would have to wait in line. That was how it had always been done.

“Hi, are you here...?”

Tang Ruyan was ready to greet the customers when she saw people enter. When she saw the two people coming in, stunned, she paused her steps.

Master Wu Guansheng?

She was startled. Seeing this master there was unexpected.

She had met this Wu Guansheng in the Mysterious Realm and had heard about him while attending some family meetings. Wu Guansheng was a titled battle pet warrior at the peak. He was older and less promising than Venerable the Blade. Still, Wu Guansheng was a mighty warrior that people could not afford to neglect.

Why would he come here?

A second of daze later, Tang Ruyan came back to her senses, eyes glistening with tears.

Finally, a VIP!

The other customers were as blind as bats; none of them could recognize her. She was of the firm belief that Wu Guansheng had to know her.

“Master Wu...” Tang Ruyan hurried over.

Wu Guansheng looked over, surprised.

He recognized her immediately. Wasn’t she the future family head of the Tang Family?

He took one more look, and the surprise grew. The way Tang Ruyan was dressed... She was wearing a uniform?

?!

Wu Guansheng was still confused. The first thing that jumped to his mind was that probably, Su Ping and the Tang Family were related in some way. Maybe, Su Ping, or the strong connections he had, were the ones supporting the Tang Family.

If that were the case, then this Tang Family would be “sophisticated.”

While Wu Guansheng’s mind was running wild, Tang Ruyan greeted him with hospitality, “Master Wu, how have you been? My father has been looking forward to paying you a visit.”

“Good, good.” Wu Guansheng stopped his train of thought. He replied to Tang Ruyan politely because he knew he couldn’t belittle her.

That was Tang Ruyan’s first interaction with Wu Guansheng. She didn’t know that he could be this friendly. Relieved, Tang Ruyan continued with a smile, “Master Wu, I’m currently working here so I cannot go back to report to my father. Please forgive me.”

“Of course.” Wu Guansheng waved his hand with a smile.

Tang Ruyan thought Wu Guansheng would ask why she was there. Surprisingly, she could tell that Wu Guansheng regarded her presence there normal, and he had no doubts or questions whatsoever.

That wasn’t conducive for her to imply her imprisonment.

She frowned and made a decision. Taking the risk of Su Ping finding out she sent a spiritual message to Wu Guansheng, “Master Wu, I am being held here against my will by this evil man. You must help me. Or, could you inform the Tang Family for me? Your help would be greatly appreciated!”

Tang Ruyan’s spiritual message startled Wu Guansheng, and her asking for help came as a shock.

Held?

Against her will?

Wu Guansheng understood what happened instantly, and that revelation astounded him.

That was to say, the future Tang Family head had been captured by Su Ping, right?

Wu Guansheng’s mouth twitched. He thought of Su Ping’s strength and that terrifying golden-hair girl. How bold Su Ping was. He had abducted this Tang Ruyan. Wasn’t he afraid that the Tang Family would seek revenge?

But...

Wu Guansheng understood that Su Ping was not afraid, considering how powerful that golden-hair girl was. With that girl present, whatever Tang Family’s revenge plan was would be of no use.

Having learned the truth of the relationship between Tang Ruyan and Su Ping, Wu Guansheng calmed himself down. “I am sorry. There is nothing I can do to help.”

With that said, he walked past Tang Ruyan into the store and waved at Su Ping.

“Mr. Su, hello.”

“Hi.” Su Ping gave one brief look and went back to tend to his customers.

Tang Ruyan was stunned still.

What...

The f*ck!

This Wu Guansheng was clearly in it with Su Ping. And she was asking for help from her enemy’s friend...

She felt ashamed, angry, and shocked all at once. She had never found out that Su Ping and Wu Guansheng knew each other. No wonder Su Ping was neither afraid of exposing her nor of the Tang Family’s potential retaliation.

Tang Ruyan’s face changed. She was wondering if she should let go of the fact that Su Ping had abducted her.

If she were to let go, then she would have to keep this confidential. She would utterly disgrace the Tang Family if word got out that she was kept there.

Su Lingyue darted a look of curiosity at Tang Ruyan with a frown. She had taken her eyes off of Su Ping for one second, and suddenly he had another pretty girl in the store. This female employee was less beautiful than the other one, but still, she was one of a kind, and even more stunning than Mu Shuangwan. “He is... so promiscuous.” Su Lingyue was fuming with rage. She stomped her feet before she went inside.

Su Ping looked at Su Lingyue and asked, “What are you doing here?”

She answered in a voice dripping with sarcasm, “I wonder who else will join the store if I am away for a few more days!”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows.

He didn’t understand.

But he was not in the mood to ask for clarification.

“Go back home and take your lessons with Wu Guansheng. I’ll send you to a better academy in the near future,” Su Ping answered, impatiently.

Su Lingyue retorted, “Wow, are you trying to get rid of me?”

Su Ping: “...”

Aware that Su Ping had requested a spot in Han Yuxiang’s Academy, Wu Guansheng felt a sense of emergency; it would be much harder for him to teach her if she went there in the future.

After all, the lessons in the academy would take up most of Su Lingyue’s time.

“Stay out of my sight. Don’t get in my way of doing business,” Su Ping shouted. He didn’t want to waste more time with Su Lingyue.

Su Lingyue snorted and went to sit on the chair in the lounge.

Wu Guansheng exchanged a few words with Su Ping and followed her there.

“Hmm, what is the big deal? I was just trying to help!”

Su Lingyue sat down and crossed her arms in front of her chest, full of wrath.

Wu Guansheng sat down next to her. “He is busy here. How about we go back for now?”

Su Lingyue respected her teacher. She shook her head and explained politely, “Sir, my brother’s store will be busy today. When more people come, I might need to help him out. Can we start our lessons later today? I don’t have to go to bed so early.”

Since she had said so, Wu Guansheng had no other choice but to acquiesce.

As Su Ping’s sister, she was not a person who could be offended.

Su Lingyue took out her phone and browsed through the news. At times she would dart glances at Joanna and Tang Ruyan, to see if they were slacking off as if she were a boss there.

All of a sudden, a piece of news popped out. “Pixie... Top 50?”

She saw the name of their store and the name of another big store. Immediately, she clicked to read the news.

Her expressions changed after she finished reading
