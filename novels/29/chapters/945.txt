Chapter 948: Failure

“So fast!”

Both of them were so fast that none of the onlookers could see them clearly. Only the Ascendant experts could see their actions. They were similarly shocked.

Not only had the girl defeated Six Lives Buddha… she was also as fast as Luo Ying?

Apart from the Ascendants, the other geniuses were observing with narrowed eyes, hoping to track her down.

Su Ping’s eyes turned golden as he watched carefully.

All of a sudden—

Bang!

A person had heavily smashed into the ground. The momentum didn’t stop until after sliding for dozens of meters.

Everybody saw that it was Luo Ying, seemingly frustrated while vomiting blood. There was an obvious footprint on his chest; his ribs had been broken and were currently pressing inwards.

A person flashed and appeared where Luo Ying fell. She was none other than Joanna, who looked down at him while pointing her spear at his forehead.

A powerful golden brilliance was condensed on the spear tip. She could kill the second best genius of the universe at any time!

The Ascendant escorting Luo Ying was shocked and about to take action.

The others were somewhat dazed by the outcome.

Luo Ying failed too?

His failure had also been awfully fast. It was tantamount to a slaughter!

Luo Ying, who was currently lying on the ground, found it hard to believe she was as fast as him while seemingly not trying her best, at all.?Is she really a Fate State warrior? What kind of monster is she?

Joanna indifferently dematerialized her spear. The golden brilliance was dispersed, which then flowed back into her body. She had lost all interest in continuing the fight.

She truly is unbelievably strong. Even I wouldn’t guarantee that I’m able to defeat her,?Su Ping thought after witnessing the exchange.

Even though he had condensed a small world, Joanna was too strong in every aspect. She was stronger than Six Lives Buddha and faster than Luo Ying. Her every other aspect was probably maxed out!

He couldn’t defeat her without using his small world.

The Ascendant escort stepped up and said politely, with cold sweat on his forehead, “Thank you for going easy on him, miss.”

Joanna seemed to merely be a Fate State junior, but that was only a reincarnation; her original self very likely a Heavenly Lord!

Normal Ascendants would hardly be able to develop such a horrifying reincarnation.

Joanna glanced at him and nodded casually, not saying a word.

The others woke up from their stupor. Dragon Shepard, who had lost earlier, had a confused and awful look. He could not figure out why such a horrifying being was living in such a normal store.

She could have won the championship had she participated.

Many looked at Su Ping and thought the same; they wondered about who was the strongest between the two.

Considering how easily Joanna had defeated the two geniuses, she seemed to be even more terrifying and invincible than Su Ping!

Mo Tianhua suddenly praised and looked at Joanna thoughtfully at that moment, “Great skills! I think I know why you didn’t participate in the contest. It would have been boring to compete with those kids.”

Luo Ying and the others had embarrassed looks after hearing that.

Joanna had previously claimed that fighting them would be like abusing kids, and that was exactly what happened.

However, all of them had already reached the final bottleneck before the breakthrough. How could anyone be that much stronger within their level?

The other Ascendant State experts were further convinced that Joanna’s original self was a Heavenly Lord, considering Mo Tianhua’s attitude, and thus their attitudes became much gentler. Even those protecting Dragon Shepard and Six Lives Buddha had quenched their anger. After all, Heavenly Lords were unrestrained beings.

Nobody would be willing to piss off their ilk.

Joanna silently glanced at Mo Tianhua. Defeating Luo Ying and the others was nothing to her; it couldn’t even be listed on her resume. All the opponents she had defeated were extraordinary talents, some of whom had survived for hundreds of thousands of years.

“Damn…”

In the crowd—Diaz was dumbfounded and lost for words.

He didn’t know that even one of Su Ping’s aides was that horrifying.

The girl is undoubtedly the best genius in the universe aside from Su Ping, and still she’s willing to work as a clerk for him? There has to be something going on between them!?Diaz felt even sadder after thinking that.?Why is that guy’s girl so awesome too? How can I possibly defeat him?

Su Jin’er’s eyes glittered with complicated feelings. She had been planning to get closer to Su Ping as his partner, but he already had such an excellent girl next to him. He might not have the least bit of interest in her.

Suddenly, an Ascendant State expert stepped up and asked in earnest, “Madam, would you like to be a guest of the He family?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Before he continued pitching his offer, Joanna indifferently said, “No.”

Her refusal was short, and straight to the point.

The Ascendant expert almost choked, but he didn’t show any dissatisfaction; he only wore an awkward smile.

As a matter of fact, he was only trying his luck. After all, the girl’s original self was an Ascendant State expert, one that would surely have her own organization already.

All the others abandoned their own plans after seeing their peer be shot down.

Mo Tianhua was further reassured that Joanna’s original self was probably as extraordinary as him, considering her behavior. He was quite impressed; after all, it would be extremely difficult, if it were even possible, for him to develop a reincarnation to such a level.

For her to defeat Six Lives Buddha was understandable.

However, it was rather terrifying to see her defeat Luo Ying easily as well.

After such a setback, everybody observed her with curious eyes, wondering whether or not she was stronger than Su Ping.

It didn’t take long for someone to ask the question.

Su Ping smiled and said, “We’ve never fought before, but we’re probably close.”

None of them pressed on the matter after he gave such a vague answer.

The group dispersed and returned to their respective spaceships after having a look around at the store. Su Ping asked Mo Tianhua to wait for him. He then placed the Chaos Egg he had fetched from the Heavenly Star Pavilion in the Chaos Spirit Pool.

Even though he could hatch it immediately, he would have to tend to it afterwards. He still had to report to his master first.

“This egg…”

Hardly had he brought out the egg when Joanna narrowed her eyes and asked Su Ping sternly, “Where did you get this? It seems to belong to a very ancient creature.”

“Indeed. I’ve also detected the aura of an ancient power,” said Green Lady via telepathy from the rear of the store. She had never appeared before the recent visitors, but she had been paying close attention to Su Ping.
