Chapter 234 One Stab

Yuan Tianchen slowly looked at the shop’s direction again, only to see the strange girl frowning at him as if she had seen something dirty.

No one had given him such an offensive look in a long time.

Yuan Tianchen was a veteran, but not a kid who was easily swayed by anger. He currently had enough reasons to stay calm and reassess the situation more carefully. He wished to figure out where this woman had come from.

An unknown legendary warrior that suddenly popped up out of nowhere was a serious problem. Also, a powerful legendary warrior was willing to sit inside this small shop and be ordered around by a young man? Who was he? Did he have someone influential helping him from behind the stage, or... was he actually someone strong who kept his true power hidden?

Yuan Tianchen found his anxiety was growing uncontrollably, as he suspected that there might be confronting two legendary warriors. If that was the case, he would lose in a direct confrontation if an all-out fight broke out.

Everyone had noticed that the girl was a legendary warrior, and they were equally shocked to realize that such a rare case had taken place right there, while nobody had heard anything about it.

There were only a dozen legendary warriors on this whole planet. Why would one of them stay in that insignificant shop?

They retreated farther just in case; they could no longer interfere when it came to a battle between legendary warriors.

Yuan Tianchen asked a question in a loud voice, “You’re not from this planet, I take it? Are you perhaps a member of the Federation’s interstellar operation teams?”

Humans had long begun exploring outer space and had successfully established many colonies on other planets. As a matter of fact, their home planet was slowly being forgotten over time as resources were depleted, diminishing the planet’s overall value. This was why the Federation would never send assistance to help in dealing with all the space fractures. They didn’t care.

Joanna raised an eyebrow. “Federation? What the heck is that? Some kind of gathering place for your pathetic kind? I’m not telling anything to an ant like you. Beat it! Don’t let me say it again.”

Yuan Tianchen lowered his head to keep his hateful look hidden.

Su Ping frowned and whispered, “Try not to reveal your origin. Stop saying god and divine power and such. You’re going to embarrass all of us.”

Joanna scowled. “My origin?? These lowly insects will never know where I came from. Do you know that I’m already trying to be nice here? My holy weapon can pierce that old fart’s heart before you see it! I just don’t want to get any blood on it!”

Su Ping didn’t doubt her words. If a pure-blooded god fought against a human... The result should be obvious. Besides, the system told him that Joanna was a powerful entity even compared to her people.

That old man was only an average legendary warrior, which was basically nothing when a god was present.

“Just... Don’t call our customers ants and insects, all right?”

“What’s the problem? It’s not like I’m referring to you!”

“Come on. I’m trying to lay low in this humble shop, you know what I mean?”

“Tsk.”

Outside, Yuan Tianchen summoned a space tear around him, from where a large creature with a humanoid body walked out, causing an obvious drop in temperature.

The creature was pitch-black, as if its body were a black hole, something that not even light could escape from. It had four arms holding four different weapons, a sword, a dagger, a chain and a curved saber. Each weapon was coated by dark mist that seemed to be made of countless screaming souls craving for revenge.

Even the sky turned dark as the creepy existence showed up.

Yuan Tianchen’s partners were shocked once again after seeing what he had just done.

That humanoid creature was none other than Yuan Tianchen’s pet. A Beast King at that. While it was not very big in size compared to other Beast Kings, it was no less deadly since it possessed every bit of prowess a Beast King needed.

Yuan Tianchen looked at his pet and uttered a single word.

“Fusion.”

The pet melted into a puff of smoke and dived inside Yuan Tianchen’s body, transferring the gloomy aura onto Yuan Tianchen instead. His original gentle old man image was instantly turned into that of a merciless murderer. His eyeballs had become completely black, as if possessed by a demon.

Another pair of limbs extended out from his sides, which held the same weapons of his pet.

Venerable the Blade stepped farther away with his friends upon sensing the dangerous aura coming from Yuan Tianchen.

The dramatic display attracted Su Ping’s attention as he glanced that way. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ohh, so that’s the rumored pet fusion skill only legendary warriors can use? He could feel the power of a Beast King radiating from the old man’s position across the distance. It was pretty impressive.

Joanna was angered again since the “tough customer” refused to stand down.

“I’m showing you mercy, worm, yet you do not wish to accept it, I see. There won’t be another chance!”

She slowly moved a hand across the air, creating a shining lance that filled the interior of the shop with a different kind of compelling might, like that of a righteous warrior who had lost his mind in too much bloodshed.

With her weapon in hand, she threw Yuan Tianchen a disdainful glimpse.

“DIE, YOU!!” Yuan Tianchen bellowed with two different voices echoing against each other.

The ground beneath him buckled, as he reached the shop in an instant and used all four weapons to attack Joanna from four different directions.

Joanna didn’t flinch in the slightest when the weapons were almost upon her.

Her retaliation was simple. When the enemy was close enough, she pushed her lance forward with a single thrust attack at lightning speed. The weapon was so fast that it left its lingering shadow behind.

Simple, quick, and deadly. Yuan Tianchen tried to defend himself, yet he failed. He found that an unknown force had briefly stopped his movements, as if someone had put a leash on him.

That brief obstruction was enough for Joanna’s weapon to reach his chest and go all the way through his body.

Everything went quiet as the other titled warriors watched how Yuan Tianchen, one of the most prominent warriors they knew, was helplessly dangling from a polearm that had pierced through his heart like a criminal trussed to a stake.
