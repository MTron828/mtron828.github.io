Chapter 717: The Test That Covers a Continent

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“What’s going on?”

Ji Yuanfeng, Ye Wuxiu and the others raised their heads, only to be stunned by the cloudy sky.

They suddenly detected that there was something familiar about the clouds.

Is it... a Heavenly Tribulation?

Is Su Ping breaking through to the Star State?

As they thought about it, everybody’s eyes widened in ecstasy!

Conversely, Ji Yuanfeng and the Deputy Chief were confused. Ji Yuanfeng stared at the clouds and remarked, “I don’t think it’s related to a Star State test!”

“Huh?”

Everybody looked at him. Ji Yuanfeng was at the peak of the Fate State, inching ever so closer to the Star State; he knew much more than the rest of them did.

“Chief, what do you mean?” asked Yuan Tianchen while evidently unsettled.

Ji Yuanfeng looked at the sky and said in a solemn tone, “Considering what is recorded in the ancient classics, the Star State test is not a lightning strike, but a test inside your own body. So, you would have to pass the test within yourself...”

Everybody was stunned, as they had never heard of such a thing before.

A test would happen inside your body in order to enter the Star State?

Then, what was the test about?

Li Yuanfeng suddenly remembered the “joke” that Su Ping told all the time. He said with utmost shock, “Is—Is he taking the Legendary warrior test?”

Everybody was quite shocked to hear that.

The Legendary warrior test?

Ji Yuanfeng’s expression also changed. He suddenly remembered how he was unable to detect Su Ping’s level!

He was already at the peak of the Fate State; it was hard and unnecessary for Su Ping to hide his level from him. After all, they were on the same side. He hadn’t even been able to gauge Su Ping’s real level when the latter was being cornered.

What he had sensed was that Su Ping was just an exceptional Titled warrior...

Was that his real level?

Ji Yuanfeng’s mind went blank as if it had just exploded after thinking about it.

A titled warrior had been fighting alongside them, and was actually the strongest of all?

The other legendary warriors were also astounded by Li Yuanfeng’s comment.

“Boss Su has always claimed that he’s just a titled warrior. I always thought he was joking...” mumbled a stunned Qin Duhuang.

Zhou Tianlin was also dazed by the thought.

The Lord of the Deep Caves was also shocked to see the gathering clouds. It realized something and looked at Su Ping in fright.

It had also sensed at first that the human wasn’t even a legendary warrior!

But it didn’t consider that a big deal.

It originally concluded that Su Ping had cultivated a certain ancient disguising technique. After all, how could he flash from place to place or make use of the power of laws if he were really just a ninth-rank warrior?

That wasn’t something that anyone in the ninth-rank could’ve done!

However, what was happening right before its eyes forced it into believing that the human was really just a ninth-rank ant!

A guy who wasn’t even a legendary warrior had almost trapped it!

Huraaaa!

The Lord of the Deep Caves let out a furious roar. “Bastard! Bastard! I’m going to kill you!”

Su Ping stood quietly in the sky. He couldn’t help but feel the desire to kill again upon hearing such fierce words, but he did his best to hold back and sternly look at the enemy. “Why don’t you try?”

A good thing about the Heavenly Tribulation was that anyone who attacked the person going through it would also be attacked!

It was also worthy of note that the power of the test wasn’t merely fixed at the legendary level, it would also depend on the level of the attacker!

If a Star State being barged in, the Heavenly Tribulation would adapt and deal the invader a Star State tribulation!

After all, Heavenly Tribulation was a true test from Heaven itself!

Heaven would pass judgment during such a trial; whoever attempted to kill the subject being judged was actually showing contempt and disrespect toward Heaven.

Su Ping was determined to kill the Lord of the Deep Caves. He wasn’t afraid of its meddling, and was confident of defending himself even if the latter really dared to attack.

He was already at the legendary level; passing the test was the last step.

He had dozens of times more energy than he did before; performing Void Sword attacks had become all too easy for him!

“You’re asking to be killed!” The Lord of the Deep Caves’ eyes glowed fiercely. It had always regarded Nie Huofeng as its primary opponent, then it finally defeated the man and almost killed him. Still, another guy had shown up.

“Even if you pass the test, so what? You’re still an ant even if you break through! I’ll kill you all the same!” The Lord of the Deep Caves gnashed its teeth.

Its voice echoed throughout the void.

Ye Wuxiu and the others at ground level were shocked to find that their speculation had been confirmed.

Su Ping was really going through a legendary warrior test!

He had truly been a titled warrior all along!

They were too shocked to say anything upon remembering that Su Ping had made two trips to the Corridor. They didn’t have the ability nor the courage to do that even though they had been at the legendary rank for ages!

And yet, Su Ping had done that when he was only a titled warrior!

“T-This guy...”

The Deputy Chief turned around. He looked at Qin Duhuang, who was quite familiar with Su Ping, and asked, “Back when he broke into the Tower and killed three legendary warriors in a row, what was his level?”

Qin Duhuang came back to his senses and looked at the Deputy Chief. He thought for a moment and said, “If what I perceived that day was accurate, he probably was at the seventh rank back...”

“...”

Silence reigned everywhere.

The seventh rank...

Su Ping had forced his way into the Tower and killed three legendary warriors when he was only a seventh ranker, barely an advanced battle pet warrior!

Even worse, one of them had been a Void State warrior!

The Deputy Chief was slack-jawed, stunned by what Qin Duhuang had said.

He had only been at the seventh-rank... The Deputy Chief had taken action for the dignity of the Tower, yet Su Ping had managed to block his attack.

Su Ping was only at the seventh-rank back then?

I failed to defeat a seventh ranker?

Not just the Deputy Chief, Yuan Tianchen and the others were just as dumbfounded. Yuan Tianchen in particular; he remembered how Su Ping had competed with his granddaughter for a legacy. No wonder she never won... She was competing with a monster!

An unprecedented super monster!

“Why is his legendary test so large?” At this moment, someone noticed how vast the thunderstorm shrouding Su Ping was!

Another onlooker was shocked after coming to that realization.

“The thunderstorm covered an entire mountain when I became a Legend. That was already shocking enough.”

“My thunderstorm only covered five kilometers. It drew everybody’s attention too...”

“This guy’s Heavenly Tribulation... Oh my god, why do I feel that it’s spreading hundreds of kilometers away?”

The legendary warriors exchanged their impressions in whispers, rekindling their first shock.

The Heavenly Tribulations they had passed had already been shocking and splendid enough, but they were just a minor breeze compared to the one over Su Ping’s head!

Ji Yuanfeng’s expression changed. His legendary test only had a twenty kilometer radius, which was massive in its own right. He had learned from certain ancient classics that the size of the Heavenly Tribulation depended on the examinee’s potential.

The more gifted one was, the larger the test would be, and the more they would attain if they passed it.

Whoosh!

Ji Yuanfeng rose dozens of meters from the ground. Starry light gathered in his eyes as he looked at the horizons.

To his shock, he discovered that he was unable to see the edges!

The radius was not hundreds of kilometers, but probably thousands of kilometers!

“T-This guy...”

Ji Yuanfeng looked at Su Ping floating high in the sky, wondering about how unbelievably gifted he was. He had to be one of the top geniuses in the entire Interstellar Federation!

...

In the north.

Two men were traversing the sky at a fast speed.

They were two legendary warriors. One of them had been tasked with delivering messages to the Tower by Gu Siping, and the other was the Legend who was permanently defending the Tower. They were at the moment on their way to reinforce the defense lines.

After all, even the first-generation Tower Master had gone to the front lines earlier.

As they saw it, the first-generation Tower Master—a Star State warrior—was enough to vanquish the beast tides!

It was exactly at that moment when clouds gathered in the sky above them.

Lightning then proliferated amidst the clouds; such a destructive aura struck a familiar chord in both of them.

“Is—Is it a Heavenly Tribulation thunderstorm?!”

Both of them stopped and looked ahead in surprise.

“How is it possible? Whose Heavenly Tribulation could have caused such a huge thunderstorm? Is it a Star State test?”

Further away, right at the edge of the Subcontinent District, waters were surging and many wild sea beasts were moving closer to the shore. There were so many of them that they could occupy every corner of the continent if all they went ashore!

All of a sudden, some of the beasts with higher cultivation stopped and looked up.

The sky at the end of the horizon became dark. Dark clouds seemed to be gathering and roiling.

“?”

“??”

The sea creatures were at a loss.

...

Behind the defense lines.

The entire sky had turned dim because of the thunderstorm.

“What the hell is that?” The Heavenly King of Good and Evil suddenly raised its head in the middle of their slaughter.

The other beast kings also stopped, astonished by the clouds above their heads.

“Someone is passing a Heavenly Tribulation. What’s this test? Is it for the Star State?”

“Is the Ocean Sovereign transcending?”

The Fate State sea beasts became excited and cheered loudly.

The Fate State beasts from the Deep Caves looked at each other in bewilderment.

The sea empress would probably fight against their king if she reached the Star Stage. After all, two tigers couldn’t share one mountain.

Outside the Pixie Pet Store.

The survivors who were hiding in the shop looked at the dim sky and the thunderstorm, wondering what was going on.

The kneeling empress also noticed the anomaly. She couldn’t raise her head at the moment; the best she could do was to see from the corner of her eye. She noticed how the distant skies were dim.

“Someone is going through a Heavenly Tribulation? How is it possible? This isn’t a Star State test!

“Is it a legendary test? No, that’s impossible. It wouldn’t be this vast...”

The shocked empress unleashed her energy and tried to break free so she could find out who was being tested.

Joanna squeezed through the crowd and walked out of the shop.

She looked at the thick clouds in the sky and gathered divine light in her eyes. The buildings then stopped hindering her view; she saw things in the far distance.

“It truly is him...”

Joanna was stunned for a moment. Her eyes twitched as she looked at the thunderstorm. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Heavenly Tribulation with a hundred kilometer radius that he had previously caused was already shocking enough for her, which also indicated his Star Stage potential. However, he was causing an even vaster test, with bounds she couldn’t even see. He probably had the gift to become a god!

...

Boom~!

The dark clouds were surging as if countless dragons were flying and coiling. Their pressure was becoming increasingly horrifying.

Su Ping became solemn as he floated underneath the clouds. He looked at the Lord of the Deep Caves, who had decided to return to the breached Heaven Lock and greedily absorb astral power to heal its wounds.

Su Ping couldn’t do anything at that moment; the Heavenly Tribulation would be disrupted if he tried.

Su Ping looked at the clouds above and roared, “Damn it, strike down already!”

The clouds surged as if provoked. The sky, as dark as ink, looked like an inverted ocean. Thick bolts of lightning were congregating from all directions.

“Come on!” roared Su Ping.

Boom!!

A lightning bolt struck down from the clouds. It was almost a hundred meters in diameter, which illuminated the world like a glowing pillar.

At that moment, everybody behind the defense lines sensed the pillar of lightning and looked at Su Ping.

“What a powerful lightning...”

Ye Wuxiu and the others became pale as they witnessed such a display of power. They didn’t think they could have resisted such an attack even though they were Void State warriors!

While still in the base cities far away, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil and the other Fate State beasts from the Deep Caves learned the position of the being that was going through the test by using the lightning as reference.

“Let’s go!”

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil roared and rushed over.

All the other Fate State beasts followed, eager to know the examinee’s identity.

More and more beast kings were gathering in the place where Su Ping was being tested. They were all eager to appreciate such a rare view. Not even slaughtering couldn’t pique their interest anymore.

After a loud bam, the pillar of lightning swallowed Su Ping’s body and heavily struck the ground, causing an earthquake with a hundred kilometer range.

The lightning was so dazzling that it was impossible to tell what was going on inside.

The lightning faded ten seconds later; Su Ping was still hovering where he used to be. His clothes and secret armor were all damaged, and his pet-fused athletic body was exposed.
