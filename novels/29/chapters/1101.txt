Chapter 1102: Sword Attack

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

There were hundreds of people who were traveling in the exterior.

They were mostly scattered. Su Ping and Shuai Qianhou were hiding in the sixth space; their cover was flawless, thanks to the path of space that Shuai Qianhou had grasped.

Nobody could detect them unless they were as strong as them.

Su Ping also covered their auras with the path of illusion. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Shuai Qianhou’s eyes narrowed a bit when seeing the law of illusion; he had sensed how powerful it was, back when Su Ping used it in the previous battle. He suspected that some Heavenly Lord had created it.

“Let’s not alarm them yet, not until we find their leader,” whispered Shuai Qianhou.

Su Ping didn’t make a sound. He was as experienced in hunting as Shuai Qianhou was; after all, he had been to plenty of adventures in the cultivation sites.

They snuck closer, not even attacking those who were alone; all to avoid alarming them.

They soon discovered that there were a dozen people among the hundreds of travelers who had grasped perfect paths. Still, it was hard to distinguish their leader.

“The leader must be hiding on purpose, in case of potential ambushers. It’s hard to tell which of them is the leader.” Shuai Qianhou’s eyes glittered as he considered how to address the problem.

He didn’t have the ultimate treasure anyway, and was inevitably concerned.

“Let’s find out with the key,” Su Ping said after thinking for a moment.

Shuai Qianhou was stunned. “They key? Do we even have a…”

He paused halfway, realizing what Su Ping was up to. He couldn’t help but glance at him.

Is he really considering himself a hunter?

Indeed, they didn’t have the key, but they could make up one!

Thanks to the information shared by their master, it was really easy for them to create a counterfeit with laws. They could make a key and see to whom the travelers would surrender it; that guy would surely be the leader.

Even though the key was fake, they had never seen the real key anyway, and they would have to hand it over to their leader.

That was the trick.

Shuai Qianhou nodded. Then, he saw the law of chaos gathering in Su Ping’s hand. A broken black sword was soon manifested; it was exactly what the key looked like.

Shuai Qianhou was quite envious as he watched. He also knew the law of chaos, but his expertise wasn’t good enough to construct anything as easily.

It was possible to even create lives with the perfect law of chaos.

However, it was rather difficult to create special lives, such as those with powerful constitutions; Su Ping would have to know the genetic information of those constitutions first.

They threw the broken sword in a place where two explorers would meet, all to prevent either of the two from claiming it.

Each of the two explorers noticed the sword shortly after; both were thrilled to see the key. They concealed their emotions and tried to hide the key; unfortunately, they soon noticed each other’s presence.

Both of them became extremely anxious for a moment.

After a while, they confirmed that both of them were aware of the key.

That stimulated their determination to kill each other.

They gradually wandered off the team, displaying great acting skills. However, someone soon caught up with their abnormal behavior. It was a given; their supervisors weren’t expecting them to dutifully surrender the key if they found it, so they had been observing with a keen eye.

The two were soon found and interrogated. Then, they revealed where the key was.

All the others were shocked to hear of the key’s discovery.

They didn’t expect their luck to be as good, to find the key shortly after they arrived.

Everyone gathered and dug out the key, which was buried deeply underground in mud. However, they could still detect it.

A dozen tough looking men in the crowd stood out. The key was later given to a golden-haired young man.

The latter wore a strange expression. Although he seemed calm, his excitement was obvious. His odd expression faded as he observed more carefully; he then gave the key to someone else, as if it were no big deal.

The man who received it was surprised to be given the key for examination. He accepted it in any case, and was delighted by the task. His delight was short-lived; he was going to say something when two aggressive auras darted out of the void.

Someone realized what was going on, and exclaimed, “Enemy incoming!”

However, the attack had landed thunderously just then.

The auras of a spear and a sword slashed at the golden-haired young man like a mountain.

Even though he had given the key to someone else like a lackey would, the first person to examine the key was undoubtedly the leader.

The golden-haired young man snorted, seemingly unsurprised; he had figured out the situation once he confirmed that the key was fake. Only those who received the Celestial experts’ memories knew what the key looked like, and they must have forged a key as part of a trap. He was already prepared to

defend himself; nevertheless, the two attacks were too powerful.

After a boom, the golden-haired young man was blown into the void, right when he had just prepared his defenses; even space was shattered.

The ground within dozens of meters was obliterated.

The others had finally realized what was going on. Some of them moved back, planning to take advantage of the chaos and escape.

There was another explosion, and the golden-haired leader made an instant return from the void, with blood on his lips. His robe was already in tatters, revealing the dragon-patterned armor inside.

“Just the two of you?” The golden-haired young man narrowed his eyes and stared at Su Ping and Shuai Qianhou.

The latter was solemn; he and Su Ping had almost tried their best in their previous ambush. Their thunderous attack with supreme laws was unable to heavily wound the guy.

“He’s mine. You take care of the rest,” said Su Ping outright.

Shuai Qianhou’s lips twitched. A lot of people present had grasped perfect paths; he was outnumbered. Besides, it was possible that there would be someone who had grasped a perfect supreme law, just like the red-robed young man.

Very soon, someone in the crowd recognized them.

“It’s him, Shuai Qianhou!

“know him, he’s the famous Star Lord from tens of thousands of years ago!

“The guy next to him is Su Ping. He’s the one who condensed a small world in the Fate State!”

Many of them were shocked to see Su Ping.

The guy was only a Star State warrior… Even so, was he bold enough to attack their leader?

Even more crazily, the terrifying sword aura released by Su Ping obviously contained a perfect path!

In the crowd—the dozens of tough-looking men were stunned after recognizing Su Ping’s level. They didn’t expect that anyone in the Star State could be as strong.

“Shuai Qianhou, we meet again. We fought in space thirty thousand years ago. Do you remember?” said an old man with a smile, as he walked out of the crowd.

Shuai Qianhou said indifferently, “I don’t. I never remember trivial matters.”

“Haha…” The old man laughed coldly. “You’re as pretentious as you were back then. Now that you’re here to get killed, I will certainly grant your wish. I heard that you are under Shen Huang. You got his ultimate treasure, didn’t you?”

Shuai Qianhou replied indifferently, “So, how do you want to die?”

The old man smiled coldly, not giving a response.

The golden-haired young man wiped his blood and looked at them coldly. He fixed his eyes upon Shuai Qianhou and said, “Finish off that Star State brat. I’ll take care of this one.”

Shuai Qianhou frowned and felt rather helpless. Everybody thought he was carrying the ultimate treasure. He actually became Su Ping’s cover.

He didn’t want to be anyone’s cover.

He would have a huge disadvantage if he fought without the treasure!

“Tm carrying the ultimate treasure. Let’s have a competition,” Su Ping stood out.

Everyone was stunned by Su Ping’s revelation. This Star State kid was carrying the ultimate treasure?

Su Ping was indeed a kid in their eyes.

He was only a Star State warrior. How many years could he have cultivated?

“Junior Brother Qianhou is but a new disciple. The ultimate treasure is too heavy a responsibility for him. It is his senior brother’s duty to look out for him,” said Su Ping.

Shuai Qianhou: ”

Everybody was lost for words again. Shuai Qianhou, who had been famous for tens of thousands of years, became the Star State kid’s junior brother. That was… hilarious!

The golden-haired leader raised his eyebrows in surprise, but he simply said with indifference, “It doesn’t matter. Finish him off. I’ll take care of this one.”

He didn’t care whether or not Su Ping was telling the truth; he would finish the guy off with the ultimate treasure.

“Junior brother, take care of yourself,” said Su Ping.

Then, while everybody was watching—he ruthlessly charged at the golden-haired young man, turning a blind eye to all the others.

Shuai Qianhou was rendered speechless. However, in terms of seniority, Su Ping was right and there was nothing he could say.

“He’s only in the Star State, and yet he’s provoking Lord Brian? Way to get himself killed!”

“Is he delivering the ultimate treasure to us?”

“Wasn’t the ultimate treasure entrusted to the strongest disciple? What was Shen Huang thinking??”

Everybody at the edge was observing the battle; none were planning to participate.

Some captains were roaring, “The rest of you, pay attention to your surroundings. Beware of other ambushers.”

They narrowed their eyes and observed the area; they found it ludicrous that only two people would attack them. How confident were those two?

But the next moment, Su Ping drew his sword.

The sword—with an edge made of the law of chaos—was formed in his hand. The intense aura of chaos made the void quake, like ripples on a lake.

An unimaginably powerful aura surfaced on Su Ping. It was the abundant deity aura that had been accumulating in his body.

“Slay the sky!”

Su Ping’s eyes were like glittering stars, and the edges in the dark night. A terrifying sword aura was gathered in his hand. That sword had once cut apart the sky in ancient times; it was glowing again at the moment!

“Oh no!”

“Dodge!”

The people standing dozens of meters behind Brian fled in panic, awed by the terrifying aura..
