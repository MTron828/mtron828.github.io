Chapter 1354 Execution of Causality (1)

Unfortunately, I’m not strong enough to spread my senses that far.

Su Ping sensed that the world beyond the crack had to be extremely precious; it involved the source of that world. Maybe the Golden Crow ancestor knew something about it.

After pondering about it, Su Ping felt the urge to visit the Golden Crow world again. However, it wouldn’t be easy to meet their ancestor. Last time, he only managed to communicate with him telepathically by using a drop of essence blood and his bloodline. According to the Chief Elder, it was a rare opportunity. The situation may not be repeatable even if he received another drop of essence blood.

“Xiao Su!”

Shen Huang dived from the sky and rushed into the building, thrilled.

His brimming power made him deeply realize how strong he was. It was all thanks to Su Ping’s help. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Chi Huo and Xu Kong snapped out of their shock and said enviously, “Congratulations, Shen Huang.”

Shen Huang glanced at them. He used to feel some pressure when he looked at them with his cloned body. They were Celestials, even if they concealed their auras.

.

But at that moment… He felt as if he was looking down at them.

Although he had just returned to the Celestial State and their levels were the same, he somehow had the feeling that he could beat the two of them at the same time.

...

Chi Huo and Xu Kong also sensed their friend’s change. His eyes were different; sharper, and filled with the gravitas of an emperor. They were quite envious. Everybody said that a great teacher could help his disciples a lot; never had they heard that a teacher could be helped by his disciple to such a degree.

“Master, how do you feel?” Su Ping focused his attention and smiled at his master.

Shen Huang replied, “Fantastic! I also feel that I can condense a Celestial State clone with the Dao of my previous universe!”

“It’s possible, if conditions allow. However, if there isn’t enough time and energy, it would be best to aim for the universe dominator realm,” said Su Ping.

Shen Huang smiled and said, “Of course, but our talent is limited. I don’t think there’s a chance to condense a Dao Heart in the next twelve thousand years.”

“It’s hard to say; maybe all you need is an epiphany.” Su Ping shook his head. There was a catastrophe underway. His master’s journey to higher levels would be delayed if he were to be distracted as he built a clone.

Shen Huang and the others looked at each other with bitter smiles. It may seem like just an epiphany to Su Ping. But to them, having epiphanies was extremely difficult.

Becoming a Universe dominator… That was their dream for countless years. It was the final cultivation goal for them!

“Shen Huang really found a great disciple,” said Chi Huo with a sigh, and obvious envy in his voice.

Shen Huang coughed and changed the subject. “Everyone should be there for the meeting already. Shall we go?”

“Okay.” Su Ping nodded.

Their minds quickly delved into the Astral Nexus. Su Ping then received Shen Huang’s invitation to the Celestial State conference room.

After choosing to accept, the virtual space in front of the young man quickly began to expand. Then, a conference room appeared at the end of said space; although considered a room, there were actually no walls. Around him was the boundless universe. There was a long table floating at the center, with 24 chairs flanking both sides. The chairs were being occupied by figures with powerful auras.

The throne ahead was usually reserved for the Primordial Empyrean Master. The Planet of Origin had always been responsible for scheduling meetings.

The throne was vacant at the moment, and so were the seats that belonged to the Saint Kings.

The other Celestials sat in their respective seats. Five of them had shown up.

Adding Su Ping and the other new arrivals, there were altogether nine people.

Two Celestials had perished; one was killed by Su Ping in the Mayhem Star Zone, and the other died at the hands of the alien in the worm tide. Only ten of the twelve Celestials remained.

“Two people haven’t come yet.” Chi Huo looked around and frowned.

Shen Huang said calmly, “They should be coming soon; it’s not like them to keep us waiting. They’re probably caught in something.” “Shen Huang, do you accept our proposal? You’ve brought your disciple here again. Are you going to do the same as before? If so, I’m leaving right now,” said a Celestial old fellow in a cold tone.

The others gave him frosty glances. Although Su Ping had threatened them by hurting the leader of the Black Desolation Star Zone through the Astral Nexus, that was it; none of the Celestials were cowards. If they accepted the terms, they would be submitting to someone else. It had been years since they submitted to anyone; not even the Primordial Empyrean Master would treat them that way.

“Shen Huang, I admit that this disastrous moment calls for an alliance, but you must not consider yourselves the main representatives of justice. Everybody here has been resisting the worms and fighting the catastrophe. You want to claim all the power like a dictator. That’s the reason why the alliance has never been formed!” said a tall Celestial cultivator, with ice in his voice.

Chi Huo glared at him. “So, in your opinion, we’re the ones holding everyone back? We’ve asked you to join forces with us in half a month, but you refused. I wonder what the leader of the Black Desolation Star Zone offered you. He once conspired with the devil from the age of deities and caused trouble to every star zone in the universe, so he’s afraid that we’ll get back at him. But, are we really that petty?”
