Chapter 543 Two Materials

The door opening alerted the crowd. People swarmed to the store at once.

“Hey, dude, is your boss here?”

“Are you serious? Sir, I am Zhao Ren. It is my honor to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you, sir.”

Some people failed to recognize Su Ping while some were better informed. They immediately recognized that the young man was a super-powerful battle pet warrior, the one who had defeated the Otherworld Heavenly King!

People swiftly began to bow respectfully.

The ones who had failed to recognize him shuddered in fear and hurried to bow to Su Ping along with the others.

Su Ping was baffled. “And you are?”

“Sir, we have heard about your heroic deeds when you saved the people of Longjiang from the grave disasters. We are here to pay you a visit and express our respect to you.” The middle-aged man named Zhao Ren took a step closer to Su Ping.

The others nodded in agreement.

No wonder they didn’t look like locals. They were all from other base cities.

Su Ping had to thank the Otherworld Heavenly King for his fame. “You don’t have to do this. I’m just a store owner. Don’t gather around my door, you’ll affect my business,” Su Ping said.

Su Ping was able to tell the purpose of their visit; they either hoped to befriend him or recruit him.

He, for sure, would not join any forces because he himself was a force. He didn’t need to get involved with others and it was against his wishes to have any other forces seeking interests under his name.

Su Ping went right back to his store after his reply. He was planning to go home and tell his parents that he was fine, but decided against it since there were too many people present. He didn’t want to lure those people’s attention to his parents, in case those people would befriend them first, eventually making things troublesome for his family.

None of the people waiting outside were offended by Su Ping’s departure.

That was what a legendary battle pet warrior should do.

Those advanced warriors, and even the titled warriors had been waiting there for days and they had been left unattended. But they still thought that was normal. After all, Su Ping was a legendary battle pet warrior.

People peeped into the door but no one dared to set their feet inside.

The two dragon statues outside were very lifelike and quite powerful, as if two beast kings were really there.

A Lightning Rat was crouching by one of the statues. People lost interest when they saw it was a low-rank Lightning Rat; they just thought that the rat didn’t have any intelligence since it couldn’t even feel the pressure from the dragon statue.

“I didn’t know that he was so young.”

“I almost said the wrong words but I didn’t. Good for me.” Those who had failed to recognize that Su Ping was the legendary battle pet warrior were quite distressed. If they would have talked to Su Ping while assuming great airs... they would have directly offended him; he could have slapped them to death and no one would say a thing. As a matter of fact, their families would have to go there later and apologize to Su Ping on their behalf.

Across the street,

Qin Duhuang was sipping tea on the second floor. He stood up the moment Su Ping opened the door and was about to descend to say hello when Su Ping went back in. Qin Duhuang went back to his seat.

The Longjiang Base City’s economy was booming and he had reached the legendary rank. The business and trades of the Qin family were carried out smoothly while having him in the family. The Qins had moved miles ahead of the other four major families; the latter were no longer able to compete against them. As such, even though he was the leader of such a great family, Qin Duhuang barely had anything to do.

All he needed to do was to say the word to sort out certain past disputes or contentions over some businesses.

After all, the fact that Qin Duhuang had reached the legendary rank was well-known to everyone in the upper class of the Longjiang Base City. No one could afford to hinder the Qin family’s businesses anymore.

It’s been merely ten days since I last saw Mr. Su and I think he has developed much more already, Qin Duhuang contemplated, his eyes narrowed.

An old man who was sitting with Qin Duhuang sounded surprised. “How can you sense this? As far as I can tell, his momentum seems even weaker than before. I would have mistaken him for a common man on the street.”

Qin Duhuang shook his head. “This is where you’re wrong. He has merged better with the world. I have to say that I cannot defeat him even if I were to merge with my pet.”

The old man was even more astounded.

Qin Duhuang was a legendary battle pet warrior and his strength would be more than doubled when he was merged with his beast king pet. How could he say that he wouldn’t defeat Su Ping even in that state?

Battle pet warriors were usually weaker than their battle pets and that was a general rule that would apply to Su Ping as well.

“Mr. Su is going to open the store for business. Go and tell our guys to hurry up and get a spot. Mr. Su was surely training pets while he closed the store.

“Many people know Mr. Su now, and more are coming to the Longjiang Base City. If they were to find that there’s a top trainer in Su Ping’s store, they will all rush over to try. We will forever lose our chances if one day Mr. Su gets bored and doesn’t want to run the store anymore,” Qin Duhuang added.

The old man understood immediately.

That was a fact.

Since he was such a stunning battle pet warrior, Su Ping was surely opening the store purely out of interest.

No matter how many times Su Ping had claimed he was serious.

No one... believed him.

They had to make the best of it while Su Ping was still interested in running a store. After all, the pet training effects in Su Ping’s store were marvelous.

When titled battle pet warriors wanted to ask a top trainer in the Holy Light Base City to train their battle pets, they would usually have to rely on some connections and spend a large amount of money. On the other hand, training in Su Ping’s store was fast, cheap, and amazing

“I’ll get right on it,” The old man replied.

Su Ping went back inside and called the masters of the 24 pets to go and pick up their battle pets.

While he waited for their arrival, someone gingerly walked up the stairs.

The one walking at the front was a middle-aged man and two suited fellows working as entourage were trailing behind. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Still, even those two were at the titled rank!

Su Ping was a bit surprised but didn’t think much of it. After the three went inside the store, he asked, “How can I help you? We offer pet training and various kinds of pet food.”

The middle-aged man explained himself, “Sir, I’m not here to buy anything. I’m the mayor of the Hancheng Base City and I just came here to express my appreciation. Thank you for telling Venerable the Blade to help us.”

Su Ping remembered the piece of news he had seen. “How is your city doing? Are you safe now?” “Yes, sir, we are quite safe.” The mayor turned his hand over and two boxes appeared out of nowhere. “Sir, I have been asking around and came to know that you’re searching for certain materials. I took the liberty to get that list. It just so happens that we had two of those materials in our base city; one in our inventory and the other one belonged to the Shen family. Their family head asked me to bring it to you as a gesture of appreciation.”

Su Ping’s eyes glowed.

He had been searching for materials he needed for the Solar Bulwark but he had not received any updates. Then the mayor of Hancheng Base City had suddenly given him two of them. What a pleasant surprise.

“Thanks,” Su Ping said at once.

He received the two boxes. Indeed, they were two materials he needed and both had been perfectly preserved. “Thank you very much,” Su Ping expressed his appreciation again.

The mayor was glad that Su Ping liked the gift. “This is just a minor gesture. Sir, I’m glad you liked it. If we find other materials, we will get them to you.”

Su Ping nodded. He was grateful.

Venerable the Blade decided to help the Hancheng Base City on his own and Su Ping was going to sell the Swamp War Crocodile to Venerable the Blade anyway. But the Hancheng Base City mayor had paid him a visit to thank him. Su Ping felt humbled.

“Sir, we won’t waste more of your time.” The mayor was ready to leave.

Su Ping asked, “I have an average beast king on sale. Do you want it?”

The beast king he spoke of was a dragon he had captured with the beast-catching ring while he was training the dragons.

The chances of catching a beast king with an advanced beast-catching ring were not high but Su Ping had noticed that the chances would be greatly elevated if the beast king was barely breathing

After wasting some beast-catching rings to try but fail to capture dragons at the Fate State, Su Ping used the last one to capture an Ocean State dragon with a combat strength of around

16.

The mayor was baffled.

He’s selling me a beast king dragon?

He wondered if he was hallucinating.

He suddenly remembered what Venerable the Blade said to him.

It turned out that having beast kings on sale was not a joke! This legendary battle pet warrior was indeed selling beast kings!

The mayor gulped. “Sir, sir, are you sure you have a beast king on sale? I wonder, what the price is like...”

“The price will be 180 million,” Su Ping stated.

The mayor felt dizzy.

So did the two standing behind him. All three were overwhelmed by disbelief.

What a cheap price for a beast king!
