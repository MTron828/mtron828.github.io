Chapter 1297 Go Together (2)

The duel turned into a gang fight?

“Let me.” A tall and handsome young man stepped up with indifference in his eyes. “Although it won’t be gratifying even if I win, I will have him pay the price for his arrogance!”

“Count me in,” said another young man, stockily built with a bear face; he was also a genius from a high-ranked clan.

The barrier closed after the two of them entered the battlefield.

At the auditorium-countless people were holding their breath and watching. The battle between Su Ping and Zhan Wushuang had ended too quickly for them to enjoy fully. Little did they expect that the former would propose a match against three!

Would he succeed?

If he did, he would set a new record for Dao Child challenge!

“Just stand by and watch; I can finish him off on my own!” said the now gloomy genius of the Divine Elephant Clan to the newcomers.

“Since we’re here, we won’t be standing by. I will have him pay a price for his arrogance,” said the handsome young man indifferently.

The elephant-faced genius turned around and glared at him. “I said I can finish him off on my own!”

“Didn’t you hear what I said?” The handsome warrior frowned and gazed at him coldly. The atmosphere became intense.

The audience was shocked; infighting was unexpected, especially before they went after Su Ping

“If you have doubts about me, I can go ahead and dispel them for you right now!” The elephant-faced expert turned around and looked at the handsome fellow coldly, like a newfound target.

“Is that so? I’ll move to finish you off too,” said the aloof, good-looking fellow.

“You two are really interesting. Why don’t you fight it out and leave him to me; go play games elsewhere!” The bulky bear chuckled and asked Su Ping, “Shall we begin?”

“Okay.”

Su Ping nodded.

Whoosh!

The bulky bear suddenly dashed; almost disappearing in an instant, to quickly reappear in front of Su Ping. He was so fast that many in the audience had yet to realize what happened.

The next moment, the bulky bear moved to smash forth with his fist. Even the wind caused by the attack was already leaving deep claw marks on the ground underneath Su Ping’s feet!

His attack was highly destructive. When he moved, he was like lightning!

But then an explosion burst out. Su Ping also swung his fists, and they reached the target sooner!

The pair of brilliant fists appeared out of nowhere. Like a giant Buddha reciting a sutra, he unleashed a magnificent fist aura able to suppress all the demons in the world.

After a boom, the bulky bear smashed into the ground with twisted arms.

While looking at the miserable opponent on the ground, Su Ping asked out of concern, “You weren’t ready yet?”

The bulky bear rose from the ground, grim faced and brutal. His twisted arms were soon healed, and his body soared, growing to a height dozens of meters tall. He was wearing ancient stone armor; armed with an gigantic ax as he stared at Su Ping like a god looking down.

The first clash helped him realize how strong the young human was. No wonder Zhan Wushuang failed.

“Humph. Is this what the Heavenly Bear Clan is capable of?” The other contenders narrowed their eyes, noticing how their temporary colleague suffered a setback. Although confident of killing Su Ping on their own, they had to get serious because of Su Ping’s performance.

“Get lost!”

The bulky bear ignored them, and simply charged at Su Ping with the ax. The illusion of a gargantuan beast appeared behind him. It was fuzzy and undistinguishable, but it released a bloodcurdling aura. That was the ancestor of the Heavenly Bear Clan who had received the most mythical bloodline from the age of chaos.

Su Ping vaguely felt an urge rise in his blood upon seeing that illusion behind the guy’s back, instinctively transforming his constitution. An ancient and barbaric aura emerged in his body soon after, along with an ominous shriek; a scorching golden shadow appeared behind Su Ping’s back and flapped its wings, as if about to swallow the world.

That shadow was none other than the Golden Crow, which was as dazzling as the sun. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

All the people witnessing the fight felt dazed after seeing the shadow invoked by Su Ping. For him to have the power of ancient mythical creatures in his body was unexpected!

Even though he was a human being, Su Ping had received lots of treasures and his bloodline was no longer pure.

Whoosh!

Su Ping rose like a great eagle and flew toward the genius of the Heavenly Bear Clan.

“Chaotic Sky Splitting Slash!” the genius of the Heavenly Bear Clan roared, with Dao Patterns surfacing on his skin. Behind his back—there was a brownish universe like a planet about to hit the ground. A magnificent power flowed out of the universe as his ax slash moved.

Space was shattering; all light seemed to have been swallowed. Everybody had been surprised by by that ax. Even though they were watching right there, they felt like ants about to get crushed!

Bang!

But the next moment—the terrifying aura and influence were gone. The mind-blowing ax was replaced by a sword aura. The aura didn’t hit the ax; still it passed right through the bulky bear’s body.

Broken arm.

Body falling apart.

The bulky bear’s condensed power-like a punctured balloon-stiffened, then quickly declined.

Su Ping had appeared behind his back at some point, ablaze with golden flames. He turned around, and the bulky bear’s body-as well as the brownish universe in midair—was enshrouded in golden divine fire, to burn like an enormous fireball.

The heatwaves made everybody feel drenched in sweat.

“Huh?”

Both the genius of the Divine Elephant Clan and the handsome young man were both dazed and surprised.

The bulky bear was just a candidate like the rest of them. They never saw each other eye to eye, but they had to admit that the gap between themselves and their rivals wasn’t huge.

But then the bulky bear’s vitality began to decline rapidly. The effect was irreversible!

He lost already?

“It’s your turn now,” he said while dealing an ax slash.

Su Ping’s voice resounded as he charged toward the young man of the Divine Elephant Clan.

“Are you kidding me?”

The genius elephant warrior looked at the bulky bear’s enormous body, which was still burning. Then, he sneered, “Fine. Let me finish you off!”

Boom. A blade aura resembling a crescent moon slashed at Su Ping, only to be knocked aside.

The attack wasn’t dealt by the protege of the Divine Elephant Clan-it was someone else.

“You!”

The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan was infuriated.

The handsome young man glanced at him and said, “If you’re still reluctant, I will work with him but I’ll finish you off first!”

The elephant-faced genius cursed in his heart, but he had to let the guy do what he wanted, considering how things had reached that point. If Su Ping did win against the three contenders… they would be too ashamed to see anyone.

“Hellish Suppressive Punch!”

The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan roared and expanded, becoming hundreds of meters tall; such a size didn’t show any clumsiness. He threw a punch at Su Ping, causing a dent in the void.

The furious punch caused a storm of laws on the battlefield, which would be enough to kill normal Ascendants in the area!

Su Ping coldly punched back.

He used God’s Arrival, the secret technique, unleashing thirty percent of his chaos universe’s power. His fist had never been as powerful.

Bam; the two terrifying fist auras collided in midair, like two destructive meteors.

Countless laws and Dao Patterns splashed out in the explosion.

A blade of pure white color emerged from the exploding fist auras. It was the handsome young man’s attack.

Su Ping casually sliced it and moved elsewhere. He continued attacking the genius of the Divine Elephant Clan, not giving him a chance to rest.

“You!”

The latter was shocked. He had used the most brutal first technique of his clan, but Su Ping had resisted it; he was unable to launch another attack for the moment.

Roar!

An ear splitting sound wave burst out, and an ancient illusion appeared. It was ‘Ying’, a mythical creature from the age of chaos; it gazed at the battlefield with a solemn attitude, commonly seen in the barbaric era.
