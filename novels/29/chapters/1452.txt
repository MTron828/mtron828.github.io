Chapter 1453 The First Ally (2)

After a boom, the brilliant punch moved like a dazzling meteor, crossing the deep space to meet the lightning blade.

An unstoppable, sharp aura burst out from the fist attack and drowned the lightning blade.

Bang!

The girl was instantly flung away, disappearing from view. She wasn’t able to resist the strike, and was sent flying decades into the future.

Su Ping stood on the spot, not moving to chase after her. He felt that the girl would die if he used more strength; such an outcome would sever all chances to make an alliance.

“That’s impossible!”

The girl was appalled. While recalling the terrifying force working against her arms just then, she felt as if she were pushing stars. Is that the real power of this chaos clan member?

The other blue humanoids were filled with disbelief. She used her original nuclear energy, and yet she was still easily suppressed by the invader?

The girl returned from the future soon after. She said with a troubled expression, “I’ve long heard that the chaos clan creatures were the strongest when compared with those of the same level, and that they can only be defeated by one of their kind. The rumors are indeed true.”

“Thank you. You were not bad,” said Su Ping. That girl was as strong as the God Emperors.

“What’s your name?”

“Su Ping. What about you?” “Iris,” said the girl, “Why did you break into our place?”

“As I said before, I’m here to propose an alliance,” said Su Ping, “My hometown was already attacked and destroyed by the Heavens, so I hope we can join forces. I will continue seeking other powerful allies, such as the gods in the Archean Divinity and other powerful races. I want all of us to gather up to fight against the Heavens.”

Iris raised her eyebrows. “So naive. Do you know how difficult it is? The gods alone are a big headache. That bunch of arrogant people would never lower their proud heads even in front of the chaos clan.”

“I will press their heads down, then,” said Su Ping.

Iris felt dazed for a moment. She then clapped her hands and laughed. “I like that. However, you can’t do it. There are many experts among the gods; they’re just short of a Sorcerer Ancestor. Otherwise, they would have had a place in the age of chaos!”

Su Ping nodded. “It’s not a problem as long as they don’t have a Sorcerer Ancestor.”

Iris raised her eyebrows, astonishment showing on her face. “So, you have a Sorcerer Ancestor as a backer.”

“That’s one way to look at it.” Su Ping thought quickly and decided that bragging a little was necessary to increase his odds of succeeding

“You wouldn’t have asked us for help if you had a Sorcerer Ancestor. You could have simply made us do your bidding.” Iris seemed to be peering straight into Su Ping’s heart. “I can tell you the truth. There are no Sorcerer Ancestors in my clan. That’s the final destination of all cultivators. Only the original lives born in the age of chaos can reach that place; it’s impossible to reach that level through cultivation.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She was completely honest as she spoke. There was no need to lie.

Su Ping had guessed as much. The humanoids weren’t derived from the chaos clan. The chances of them having a Sorcerer Ancestor weren’t high.

“Our Sorcerer Ancestor is still asleep. He was badly wounded, so there’s no need to wake him up for trivial matters,” said Su Ping with a normal expression. “You’re lying.”

Iris gazed at Su Ping and said, “The age of chaos is long over. After such a long time, even the worst wound should have been healed. Besides, a Sorcerer Ancestor can rise back to the peak as long as a tiny bit of their aura remains.”

“This is a special case. I can’t tell you the details; you may choose not to believe me.” Su Ping was casual about it, not keen on explaining further.

Iris was actually surprised and suspicious of his confident look; however, she was still unwilling to believe him. There was only a small bit of chance he wasn’t lying, because he was a member of the chaos clan.

The members of the chaos clan couldn’t have survived the catastrophe without a Sorcerer Ancestor’s protection. That was the only reason why she thought Su Ping was telling her the truth.

“Since you’re not malicious, I won’t give you a hard time. Wait for my mother to return and tell you the result,” said Iris.

Was practicing with him the moment they met not giving him a hard time? Good thing that he won… Su Ping said helplessly, “I hope it’s a good result.”

Everybody left the arena and returned to the palace.

Iris didn’t leave. She simply asked curiously, “Tell me more about the chaos clan. How did you survive for such a long time?”

Is she trying to dig for more information? Su Ping opened his hands and said, “I wasn’t born yet. I don’t know.”

Iris didn’t believe what Su Ping said and snorted. “Humph. How petty.”

“Why don’t you tell me something about your cultivation techniques? I’m quite interested,” said Su Ping

“I wasn’t born yet. I don’t know.”

Are the women of every species so vengeful?

Su Ping felt that it was better to simply appreciate the views.

Several hours passed in a blink.

Outside the palace-several magnificent auras were approaching. Su Ping raised his head and looked at the void.

Iris and the others, however, instantly became nervous. They hurriedly stood up with blue lines on their bodies, which was their way of paying respects.

The goddess appeared again, followed by three Ancestral God peers.

There’s only four of them? Su Ping slightly raised his eyebrows.

“Is he the invader?” The woman and the other three were also observing him. Their hostile demeanor was significantly reduced after confirming that he was indeed a member of the chaos clan.

“Kid, how did you sneak in?” asked an old

man.

Su Ping said, “Guys, there’s no need for us to investigate each other yet. I’m here with the sincere offer to make an alliance. There’s no need to fight the Heavens with us right now; it’s fine as long as you’re willing to participate after I find enough allies. We will kill the Heavens together!”

All of them were surprised by his straightforward approach; furthermore, he was absolutely fearless, even under their pressure. Such confidence made them think highly of that member of the ancient chaos clan.

“Haha. Very confident. That’s indeed the style of the chaos clan,” said a male with a smile, “I heard that your hometown was destroyed and you’re now wandering without a home?”

“That is correct.”

“You couldn’t even defend your own universe. Why should we even cooperate with you?”

“If the Heavens came here in large numbers, you couldn’t have resisted them either,” said Su Ping.

“How bold!”

The old man’s eyes became sharp after snorting in discomfort.

Su Ping stared peacefully at him without giving in.

All their interactions thus far made him realize that a mere show of sincerity and friendliness was pointless. An alliance would never be formed unless he was qualified to negotiate with them.

Kneeling would not equate to an alliance, but to slavery.

“You’re not afraid that we’ll kill you?”

“Aren’t you afraid that if you kill me, my backer will break your sky and so that the Heavens can pay you a visit?” said Su Ping coldly.

That was the blue humanoid’s greatest fear, and the main reason why they hadn’t interrogated him.

“We’ve already discussed, and we’re here to inform you of the result,” said the woman, “We’re fine with the alliance. But like you said, we will only take part in the war until you find enough allies to fight the Heavens. Finding more allies first is the condition.”

“Naturally. We’ll all be screwed if we hit the stone with eggs,” said Su Ping.

“In that case, let’s hope for a good collaboration.”

“Sure.” Su Ping smiled. It seemed that those people had chosen to compromise.

After all, his arrival was absolutely unexpected. They couldn’t fathom how his backer had done it, nor were they clear about his identity as a member of the chaos clan, which was intimidating.

“Senior, is this place the last peaceful world in your universe?” asked Su Ping.

“Of course not,” the man said, “This is just the region under our control. Our universe is boundless. The invasion of the Heavens forced us to separate and hide in different green glass worlds.”
