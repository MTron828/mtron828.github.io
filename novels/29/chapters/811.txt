Chapter 813: Divine Constitution

“He’s a Fate State warrior? How is it possible?”

“He’s survived for such a long time even though he’s only at the Fate State?”

“Huh? He really seems to be a Fate State warrior. What’s going on here?”

More and more people noticed the purple-robed young man after he took action. The rogue cultivators outside of the battlefield observed him with shock and suspicion.

Is the man using a disguise technique, or is that his real level?

“Fate State?”

The leader girl and the leader of the Ouhuang Alliance both narrowed their eyes. Very soon, someone recognized the purple-robed young man and said in shock, “It’s him? I heard that someone stepped into the eighth floor of the Phantom Lightning Tower and caused a burst of power in the sea of lightning. That’s exactly him!”

“I’ve seen this guy before. He seems to be the disciple of a certain Ascendant State expert. Why is he here? Is one of the three Ascendants inside the divine residence his master?”

“He entered the Phantom Lightning Tower? So he’s really at the Fate State? How is it possible? The previous strike contained the power of laws and was quite sophisticated. Even so, you’re telling me that he’s only at the Fate State?”

The Star Lords were more or less shocked. They looked at each other in bewilderment.

It was rather unbelievable to have the disciple of an Ascendant State expert exploring a mysterious realm together with them!

It was also of note that the guy was only a Fate State warrior.

He was still so weak. Why not keep a low profile? Was he not scared of getting killed?

However, even more unbelievable, the guy had heavily wounded someone in the advanced phase of the Star State!

“Humph, even if he’s a disciple of one of those Ascendants, it’s still nothing remarkable,” the leader girl snorted and said, after hearing the whispers.

There was disdain on her face, but her eyes were full of solemnity.

He was only at the Fate State, but he was already able to fight advanced Star State experts. He would definitely grow much stronger if he acquired the Tree of Laws.

She remembered that the Universe Geniuses’ Contest would soon be held.

The guy surely joined the exploration partly because of that.

She had also participated in the Universe Geniuses’ Contest years back, but her result wasn’t very satisfactory.

Inside the small world—everybody looked at the purple-robed young man in shock except for Su Ping.

“This can’t be real. Fate State warriors can’t be that strong. Even the geniuses from the five best academies can only manage to fight early Star State experts.”

“I can only sense that he’s a Fate State warrior by using my secret technique. Even if he disguised himself, he’s still horrifying enough.”

“He’s too dangerous. Let’s finish him off first!”

“Guys, let’s take him down then. It’s too dangerous to keep him alive!” someone suggested loudly.

The others didn’t say anything, but they turned and gazed at the purple-robed young man, considering him a primary target.

He seems to truly be a Fate State expert.

While standing behind Father Time, Su Ping also looked at the purple-robed young man who suddenly intervened, although confused. He couldn’t see through the guy’s level, but his intuition told him that the guy wasn’t at the Star State.

“Hehe.”

Hearing the loud roar, and seeing that he was already a public target, the purple-robed young man remained impassive. Chains surged from underneath his sleeves and pants, surrounding him like snakes.

“Now that I’ve decided to take action, I’m not afraid of being collectively attacked by the lot of you! Come on, help me with some warm up exercises!”

“How arrogant!”

The partner of the person who was wounded by him earlier roared and attacked him.

An aura spear flew out with the powerful law of destruction condensed in it, enabling it to penetrate anything. His power was doubled as divine power burst out from his body. Plus the power of his constitution, his attack was so terrifying that it could have destroyed a city or shaken a continent in the outside world!

“A mere elemental constitution…”

The purple-robed young man smiled casually, and his body suddenly glowed, emanating an abundant divine power. He looked like a dazzling god.

Everybody inside and outside of the small world was shocked.

“A divine constitution!”

“Oh my god, it’s the best divine constitution! Only one person in a million has that!”

“No wonder he’s so strong. He’s unparalleled with this divine constitution!”

As the purple-robed young man revealed his constitution, he released the dazzling brilliance of a star and swung his chains, which were imbued with the strange power of laws.

After a boom, the chains pierced through the aura spear and then pressed on.

“Help me!”

The advanced Star State expert was shocked and roared loudly.

Nobody attacked him while he was in trouble; they had no time to figure out if the purple-robed young man was truly a Fate State warrior. The divine constitution alone was enough to make everybody fall in awe.

Very few battle pet warriors in the Federation had a constitution!

The divine constitution was the best constitution, the absolute dominator; just like the dragons among pets!

The divine constitution was so rare that it would be lucky for one or two people to be born with one in a whole galaxy!

Roar!!

Some dragons roared and dashed out, and some battle pet warriors also moved out. They used all kinds of secret techniques and launched attacks that contained different laws and elements, determined to kill the purple-robed young man. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The scarred land collapsed and fell apart on the ground below the chaotic battle. The small world was shaking, as if a hundred nuclear bombs would have been detonated in the same area. Even the small world seemed to have loosened!

The purple-robed young man, however, sneered. A divine deer that had eyes all over its body appeared behind him.

The divine deer turned into light and melted into his body, making the divine brilliance on his body even more dazzling. Then, his chains turned into pure gold; the chains were collectively a special treasure made of the power of laws and many special materials. They could easily rip apart the laws that were less hard.

After a boom, his chains were condensed into a ball that surrounded his body when he was drowned by all the attacks.

There was a deafening noise; dozens of chains darted from the chaotic energy towards the men and their pets who had just attacked.

“He’s still alive!”

Father Time and Su Ping were observing. Father Time slightly widened his eyes.

Even though he wasn’t confident of resisting the crazy barrage just then, all the survivors at the moment were all distinguished cultivators in the advanced phase of the Star State who had special methods. They could easily kill anyone at their level with a joint attack!

And yet… This guy, who was only a Fate State warrior, managed to resist the attack?

Not only did the scene shock the champions in the small world, but the rogue cultivators and Star States outside also changed their expressions and became grave.

The leaders of the Thousand Feathers Alliance and the Ouhuang Alliance were no longer in the mood for bickering. They were so serious that they acted as if they were different people.

Both of them were equally scared of such an intimidating junior.

More importantly, the man had a powerful background, and they couldn’t just eliminate him.

If his master was one of the three Ascendants deep inside the divine residence, one of them would always keep an eye on the stuation.

“Hundred Ghosts, bind!”

After his roar, the chains that darted out of the chaotic energy flashed and tied up five pets as well as the three battle pet warriors.

The chains were absolutely unpredictable. Apart from the horrifying power of laws they had, they were also part of a sophisticated technique!

“The way the chains are used seems to be a legendary technique!”

“I heard there’s a chain technique that can tie up a galaxy when fully grasped. Any of the chains can pierce through a planet, and summon billions of ghosts to help you!”

The chains emitted red light while under the watch of the Star Lords. Then, the pets and battle pet warriors that were caught by the chains screamed miserably; red light surged from their skin. Then, the red light was condensed to a human shape and was then hauled back by the chains.

The bodies of the victims helplessly fell down.

The chains were able to confine souls!

“Fight for me!”

The purple-robed young man smiled casually and unleashed an even more daunting aura. He was able to fight those in the advanced phase of the Star State when he was only a Fate State expert, partly because of the techniques and laws he knew, and partly because his divine constitution provided infinite energy for him. That was why he could launch so many powerful attacks.

After the purple-haired young man gave an order, the red souls that were tied up by the chains roared and charged at Su Ping, Father Time and the other survivors.

Father Time slightly changed his expression and defended himself with the law of solidity.

The red souls, however, screamed devastatingly, which would cause mental damage. Father Time seemed to be in considerable pain.

Su Ping frowned. While facing the sharp sonic blades that were piercing into his brain, he roared in his heart with killing intent flashing before his eyes.

He was imitating the roar of a certain undead creature in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. His soul shivered when he heard the roar at a distance back then; it left a deep impression on him.

After multiple tests, Su Ping discovered that the roar could intimidate ghosts.
