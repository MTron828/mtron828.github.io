Chapter 1576: Prayer of the People (5)
Su Ping frowned and looked at the Heavenly Dao.         

    

"The Core chose me because it saw the miseries endured by the people, the ugliness of both gods and demons, and the worthlessness of this chaos. It wants to create a world without pain or ignorance. It wants peace!" said the latter with a cold voice.     

"It's thinking exactly the same as I do. That's why it picked me."     

Su Ping gazed at the Chaos Core. "Misery and suffering are parts of chaos. They allow us to understand how precious kindness and gratitude are!"     

"Of course you would say that; you've never experienced the utter despair and helplessness of the people," said the Ultimate Heavenly Dao with a snort, "You had her help. She addressed all your hardships. Have you ever really suffered?"     

Su Ping gazed at him and replied, "Am I not suffering right now?"     

Briefly speechless, the Ultimate Heavenly Dao in a dispassionate voice, "You know fully well what I mean. So, you also crave great power. You wish that I could forgive you; so does everybody else."     

Su Ping responded with a slight nod, "Indeed; I do wish for that. But if the miracle doesn't happen, I won't wallow in despair. Just like right now… Even if I lose, I have their company. I fought, I loved, I was furious, and I found peace. If there's failure in the end, I will accept it."     

"Spare me the nice words." The Ultimate Heavenly Dao snorted. "Do you know how many people in the world are never grateful to anyone? Their parents hate them, their friends betray them. There's not even a shimmer of light in their lives. Whom should those people fight for? And to whom should they be grateful?"     

Su Ping looked back at the fellow. "Indeed, there are people who suffer; that's exactly the reason why I should do it. Because I'm happy; I have friends, parents, partners, and the system who helped me grow from an insignificant ant to who I am today. I have customers who frequently visit my shop…     

"I'm so happy that I have to help them!     

"There are too many people who have suffered for my sake. I hope I can do my best to return their favors in kind!"     

Su Ping added, word for word, "You claim to be doing everything for the ones who suffer. However, that's not virtuous, at all. When you restart chaos, they will be annihilated, along with everyone else!     

"You claim to be saving them, but you're only abandoning them!     

"Nobody will suffer in the so-called eternal world that you've built. They've already suffered. Being the supreme dominator that you are, you can't even tolerate weaklings such as them. Isn't it even sadder for them?"     

"Nonsense!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao said coldly, "Like you said, you've been living a happy life, so you can't understand their despair. It's useless to talk; you've already reached your end!"     

Just as he was about to attack—the childlike Chaos Core opened its eyes and said, "If you can say the same things after personally experiencing the hardships he endured, I will return to her side."     

Slightly dazed, the Ultimate Heavenly Dao flashed a smile and said, "That's not a bad idea. I wonder what face she'll make once he comes to my side."     

Su Ping gazed at the Chaos Core. "Are you serious?"     

The small entity said with indifference, "Don't be too happy too soon. Do you realize you will surely become like him if you endure what he's endured? He was born after the Sorcerer Ancestors. You will live the painful lives of all the people that have been born, ever since the age of Sorcerer Ancestors!     

"It'll be remarkable if you can keep your own consciousness when everything is over."     

Su Ping immediately said, "As long as you keep your word, I surely won't turn like him!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao said with a chilling voice, "Then come and feel the wish of the people!"     

The latter's body blossomed like a flower right after. Countless life auras and thoughts were splitting from the inside out.     

Those thoughts instantly swarmed and covered Su Ping.         

    

He seemed to have fallen into a bottomless abyss. Just like those weaklings, he experienced their desperate and painful lives.     

"When everything is over, you will want to destroy this failed world. Just like me…" mumbled the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

…     

At the same time, in the world outside—     

The people from the different cultivation sites and the many universes looked at Su Ping who had been pierced by their great enemy. They found that Su Ping's body was absolutely still. Furthermore, his aura was quickly fading away.     

They also discovered that the contract power covering them was also vanishing.     

"Dao-Dao Ancestor, he's dead?"     

"Ancestor Su!"     

The remaining Undying State experts from the Archean Divinity were losing it, eyes filled with anguish. Their fighting spirit was completely gone by then.     

Even Su Ping died. Everything had truly ended.     

"Boss…"     

A few figures detached themselves from Su Ping's body. They were the Dark Dragon Hound, the Purple Python and the others.     

They looked panicked and dejected at his fragmenting body. To their fright, they noticed that the contract Su Ping signed with them had been cut off.     

Their memories would have disappeared along with the contract if it were in the past—     

However, they were already Undying State creatures, and they stored those memories in their bodies.
