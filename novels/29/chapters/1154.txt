Chapter 1155: Pressing Too Far

“The Wind Summoning Technique!”

Tang Jingyu suddenly squeezed his fingers after a fierce clash, then silver light flashed on his fingertips. A gale was raised on the arena all of a sudden, soon evolving into a tornado that wreathed his opponent.

“A true technique!” a disciple exclaimed outside the arena.

“He actually grasped such a powerful true technique!” Some disciples couldn’t have been more envious.

The Qin-surnamed fellow was clearly caught unprepared. Tang Jingyu also dashed into the tornado at that moment; the power of the tornado seemed to be spinning along with his arm. He quickly punched and threw the Qin-surnamed young man off the arena.

Whoosh!

The young man was picked up by some sort of power as he fell, and then taken to He Buyu.

The latter looked rather cold at the moment, unlike his formerly smiling self. He stared at Tang Jingyu on the stage. “He’s grasped a true technique after only a year of cultivation. You’ve really gotten yourself a great disciple, Senior Mu.”

Mu Xuefeng casually sat on her chair as if seated in a cloud, unresponsive.

Her attitude remained; He Buyu was unqualified to speak to her.

Zhuang Bizhe chuckled and asked, “Junior Brother He, who’s next?”

He Buyu looked at the disciples around him; some of them were slightly weaker than Qin Feng. They could have defeated the guy whom Qin Feng had beaten earlier, but they couldn’t possibly defeat Tang Jingyu.

“You have to take care of this.” He Buyu looked at a young man next to him.

The latter seemed plain-looking and unremarkable, but he was casual, unfazed by anything.

“No problem, Senior Brother He,” said the young man with a smile.

He then stepped forward and fell like a rock to the bottom of the ravine outside the arena, not slowing his fall any technique.

But the moment he landed—he simply stood there, without having caused any impact, as if he would have been standing there the whole time.

His performance made a lot of people change their expressions.

The young man then easily jumped to an altitude parallel to the arena, to then walk forward and reach the edge of the arena, as if he were walking on flat ground as he entered the arena.

The whole process was so casual and easy that most onlookers were shocked, not expecting anyone to control their strength with such precision—

Not to mention that he was a new disciple, just like the rest of them.

Zhuang Bizhe narrowed his eyes and looked at Tang Jingyu; he was slightly relieved once he saw that the guy was rather interested. “Whenever you’re ready.”

“I seek your guidance.” The young man crossed his arms casually.

Tang Jingyu did the same. “I seek your guidance too.”

Once formalities were done with, the Fang-surnamed young man dashed forward ruthlessly, reaching a spot only a dozen meters from Tang Jingyu in the blink of an eye.

“Wind Summoning Technique!”

Tang Jingyu instantly performed his true technique again; it had already been exposed, so he didn’t have to hide it anymore.

Another tornado was summoned, wreathing the Fang-surnamed young man. However, the latter slowed down his sprint; he seemed to be merely pacing, and his every step was as steady as a rock. The tornado couldn’t shake him in the slightest.

“Huh?”

Tang Jingyu raised his eyebrows, then squeezed his fingers in a different way. “Spiritual fog!”

A fog suddenly popped up amidst the tornado, which gradually slowed down and occupied the entire arena.

Those present couldn’t see the two guys in the fog, but Tang Jingyu could detect his opponent’s location precisely; he punched the guy in the face.

Whoosh!

The Fang-surnamed young man turned around and brutally slashed at Tang Jingyu’s neck with his hand all of a sudden.

The latter’s pupils contracted. He quickly tried to dodge, but his opponent’s hand grabbed his shoulder, pulling and then pushing him. While being pushed, the Fang-surnamed young man’s shoulder hit him like a mountain, and his elbow bashed his throat. Tang Jingyu was thrown away in the blink of an eye.

Zhuang Bizhe slightly changed his expression as he watched.

The fog was only a simple stealth technique; he was naturally able to see through it with ease. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He didn’t expect that Tang Jingyu would be defeated that fast, despite using two true techniques!

“He’s so agile; he crushed Xiao Tang with nothing but the hardness of his body and martial arts. He must have been an exceptional martial artist before he became a cultivator.” Zhuang Bizhe felt gloomy and angry as he realized they would lose.

On the stage—

Tang Jingyu quickly rose from the ground, feeling that his throat was burning and his neck felt about to break; even breathing was painful. He hurriedly concentrated his spiritual energy on his throat to heal it, and finally felt cool.

The fog and the wind didn’t work on them; what kind of method was that??Tang Jingyu looked at him in shock. He had been born in a renowned cultivator family; both techniques he had used were transmitted to its members and were indeed powerful. He didn’t expect them to be rendered useless!

Besides, his opponent had yet to use any true technique.

“Give up. You’re no match for me. I was once a master martial artist before I picked up cultivation,” said the Fang-surnamed young man, eyes as cold and dazzling as lightning.

He wasn’t very old yet, but he was already a famous martial artist; he was well known in the world of mortals.

“Give up?” Tang Jingyu changed his expression after hearing that, feeling humiliated and infuriated. Not once had he given up in his life; he wanted to be the best in every competition, and he had always been.

“Lighting Sting!”

Tang Jingyu quickly squeezed his fingers and attacked again. A lightning bolt emerged in front of his hand, and he slapped it towards his opponent.

The Fang-surnamed young man narrowed his eyes and stared at Tang Jingyu warily, as realizing what the man was doing.

“Rot in hell!”

Tang Jingyu slapped the guy’s chest.

Exactly at that moment—the staring Fang-surnamed young man narrowly dodged his hand, then slapped the back of Tang Jingyu’s head. The heavy impact made Tang Jingyu’s head ring; he stiffened, and couldn’t even remember what he was going to do.

That lapse in reasoning gave the Fang-surnamed young man an opportunity. He kicked and punched several times, ending with a kick in Tang Jingyu’s abdomen, sending him out of the arena.

Tang Jingyu recovered from the shock, his expression changing greatly. However, he was incapable of flying just yet; he invoked the Wind Summoning Technique to push himself back to the arena—

But his opponent kicked and punched him again as he tried to return. Tang Jingyu was unable to keep his balance in midair and instantly fell.

Zhuang Bizhe was rather grave. He waved a hand and picked up Tang Jingyu as he was falling. This also meant that Tang Jingyu had lost the battle.

The audience was rather stunned by the outcome.

The arena had been shrouded by the fog, and they were unable to see the battle clearly.?How was Tang Jingyu kicked out of the arena in the blink of an eye? He lost just like that?

Wasn’t the fog Tang Jingyu’s true technique?

How was he defeated while using his technique?

The disciples found it hard to understand. Then, something terrifying occurred to them. Had the Fang-surnamed young man formed the core?

Such a thought brought gasps and chills to many.

The fog on the arena was already gone at that moment, and the Fang-surnamed young man was revealed on the stage.

Zhuang Bizhe calmly and gracefully announced the result.

He Buyu chuckled and said, “Senior Brother, I heard that Senior Mu admitted six people with deity constitutions. Shall we continue?”

Zhuang Bizhe frowned, then looked at the Fang-surnamed young man who showed no intention of leaving the arena. “That won’t be unnecessary. Junior Brother Fang is extraordinarily talented; I don’t think the others can beat him.”

“How do you know that if they haven’t fought yet? This is practice anyway; they’re supposed to learn from each other and make progress together,” said He Buyu, chuckling.

Anger flashed across Zhuang Bizhe’s eyes. He had been frank, but the guy was still not letting him go. Would they not stop until they defeated all the disciples on their side?
