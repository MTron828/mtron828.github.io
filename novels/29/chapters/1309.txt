Fortunately, it wouldn’t take too long.

Right now, I need time to cultivate. Once I decipher the 108 natural Dao Glyphs in my body, I will master the real power of this bloodline and become a qualified descendant of the Primitive Chaos Clan.

Su Ping quickly asked Elder Chan to let him cultivate in his universe again.

Chan Gong didn’t decline his request. Seeing that the boy was still cultivating impatiently after just winning the Dao Child title, he said, “You may cultivate for now. The Dao Child succession ritual will be held in ten days. Everyone in the institute will watch you be crowned, and all the races in the world will know your name!

“The Rain Clan’s hunting order will be canceled. We will send someone to talk to them.”

Su Ping asked, “What if they refuse?”

“Then we’ll talk to them again. I’m sure they’ll change their mind,” said Chan Gong with a smile.

Su Ping felt rather touched, feeling the confidence in the elder’s words. He felt the charm of power again. He also felt relieved; the trouble caused to humankind in that world was resolved for now.

He had never helped the local humans, and he didn’t want to add to their troubles.

Time flew.

Su Ping was cultivating wholeheartedly in Chan Gong’s universe.

News that Su Ping had defeated Chen Xi, thus becoming the new Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute was spread out in the gods’ world.

......

There were nobles of many clans in the Heaven Path Institute, so it was impossible to keep the matter a secret. Dao Children received the attention of all the clans; they were the unparalleled geniuses at the top of the Chaos Talents Rank.

Naturally, many forces sent offers to such existences.

Although the Heaven Path Institute was also an organization, it wasn’t really tied to the students and was just a place for teaching and learning. Once the students graduated, they would be free to join any organization. Even the students could join some forces; however, they would have to take care of any trouble caused with those forces, as they couldn’t ask for the institute to step in.

With powerful elders supervising them, the students didn’t dare abuse the institute’s influence; otherwise they would be kicked out if they were ever found out.

In the Rain Clan, on a high mountain

The Rain Emperor, wearing luxurious clothes, sat gracefully at the peak. His robe seemed to hold countless stars, and two ribbons dangled from his chest like star rivers. It was as if he were seated at the center of the world.

His face was solemn and furious at the moment.

“I failed to execute that brat. It was negligent of me.” Emperor Que, one of the seven emperors of the Rain Clan, stood by the cliff with a grim expression. He learned of the news that Su Ping, against all odds, had become a prince of the Heaven Path Institute. He also realized that he probably wouldn’t have another chance to kill the guy.

Su Ping was under the institute’s protection. The clan would have to pay dearly if he died.

Even though a dead genius would no longer be a genius, the Heaven Path Institute would always seek justice for any deceased students!

For killing a Dao Child, the Heaven Path Institute would very likely ask for the life of an emperor in return! Such deterrence was the reason why the institute’s Dao Children were lofty and admirable.

Considering Su Ping’s potential—if he simply kept growing without disruptions, he would surely become a God Emperor, and a very tricky one at that!

“It’s not your fault. There’s something wrong with that guy.” The Rain Emperor was gloomy. He trusted Emperor Que. If the man said he killed Su Ping, he must have done so.

Besides, the brat wasn’t even a God King, and yet he could teleport across continents in the blink of an eye. Not even God Kings were capable of doing that.

“That brat carries many great secrets. We must figure out a way to kill him. Later, I will ask Elder Tian of the Witch Mountain to curse him. He will have to go through the Heavenly Tribulation to become a God King. That will be our last chance to kill him,” said the Rain Emperor.

“You want to hire someone from Witch Mountain?”

Emperor Que’s expression changed somewhat. The Witch Mountain was almost a taboo in the gods’ world.

There weren’t many people on Witch Mountain, but they were all unparalleled experts.

It was a place with a long history, said to own several heritages dating back to the age of chaos. They were good at using curse power; nobody would want to mess with them.

There were strange undetectable curses. The curse recipient would never find a trace, while the attack would work in full.

“We’ll probably have to pay a high price, right?” asked Emperor Que in a low voice.

“It’s worth it,” said the Rain Clan solemnly, “He will definitely become a God Warrior. Any price will be worth it to exterminate him while he is still in the cradle. If humankind aspires to become a high-ranked clan through him, they too will be placing all their hopes and resources on him. There’s also his talent… We must get rid of him as soon as possible!”

Emperor Que was dazed. He couldn’t help but glance at him in shock. Even the Rain Emperor sounded vaguely scared of the lad. Would the brat work a miracle and become an Ancestral God?

He couldn’t help but recall the battle against Su Ping, and immediately his face became solemn.

He knew it was extremely difficult to rise to the ultimate Ancestral God State, but he had to admit that the human did have a slim chance of accomplishing such a grand feat!

That sliver of a chance could be destructive for the Rain Clan!

In the human clan-Ember Palace.

“Ha, ha, ha…”

Emperor Xin and all the human emperors were there. They were excited after receiving the news.

Su Ping, who had strangely gone missing, went to the Heaven Path Institute and became a Dao Child. What a great surprise!

“Dao Child… A human Dao Child!”

“I heard he defeated Chen Xi, the famous prince from one of the seven greatest clans, and took his place!”

“Are humans truly going to rise? We’ve finally seen the light of dawn after hundreds of thousands of years in the dark!”

Some were excited, while others clenched their fists with moist eyes.

The Dao Child identity was essentially a protective badge!

Having the institute’s protection, Su Ping would become a God Emperor even if he were unlucky!

Very few Dao Children had died by accident, except for those who risked their lives exploring forbidden areas.

Other Dao Children would resign after becoming God Emperors.

Some of the elders in the Heaven Path Institute had been Dao Children in their younger days. They stayed in the institute and repaid the favor.

“The resources we invested in him weren’t useless. We even offended the Rain Clan for his sake. But it was totally worth it!” said one of the people present.

Reality was cruel. If another human would have offended the Rain Clan, they might not have had the courage to fight the Rain Clan!

It wasn’t because they didn’t have backbones, but because they had to accept the harsh reality!

Everybody wanted to act freely.

However, reality seemed to always strike them in the head, telling them to keep a low profile!

They had seen too many fellow humans be wrongly killed. Some geniuses were brutally executed for offending inferior members of high-ranked clans… but they couldn’t do anything about it.

This time, they had weighed the pros and cons and decided to bet on Su Ping. Little did they expect that they would really win!

“He’s currently cultivating in the Heaven Path Institute. Considering his new identity, he’s bound to receive endless resources; there’s no need to worry about him anymore,” said Emperor Xin in comfort after the initial delight.

The others nodded. Even though Su Ping was still weak and God Warriors could kill him, they didn’t have to worry about him anymore.

“The Rain Clan provoked us relentlessly, even allying themselves with other high-ranked clans to impose pressure on us. Now we have the confidence of uniting with the Divine Wind Clan and defending our territory. We can no longer stand being insulted. As for our rise, let’s wait for him to grow. It probably won’t take but a few thousand years…”

Emperor Xin said with glittering eyes, “We should keep a low profile in the meantime and hide our edge.”

“We’ve endured hundreds of thousands of years. A few thousand years more is nothing for us.”

Someone stepped up and spoke enthusiastically, “It’s said that there are treasures from the age of chaos in the relics found in the desert. We’re the only people who know of the relics right now. I’m willing to lead a team to explore it. We will later have resources when this Su Ping becomes a God Emperor and graduates from the Heaven Path Institute; this way we can help him ascend to the supreme Ancestral God state!”

Emperor Xin nodded, agreeing with the idea. He was also thinking about resources to invest in Su Ping later on. Otherwise, a God Emperor would only be able to slightly improve their status. He would still be incapable of tearing apart the darkness above their heads.
