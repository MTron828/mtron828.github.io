Chapter 558 Legend? Instant KO!

Kill her!

The many titled battle pet warriors of the Situ family and the Wang family charged toward Tang Ruyan.

The Tang family’s people were appalled. Indeed, Tang Ruyan’s performance was completely unexpected. That being said, dozens of titled battle pet warriors were going to attack her at the same time. Even a person at the peak of the titled rank would fall!

“Please, listen to me. For the sake of our friendship, I hope you can... help her escape. Your assistance will be much appreciated!”

Tang Linzhan found the strength to turn around and he addressed the several titled battle pet warriors that were from other base cities.

Those titled battle pet warriors had been unaffected by the bell’s spatial attack; they could move about at will. As such, Tang Linzhan’s hope relied on them.

Tang Ruyan was deemed as the Tang family’s future, considering the strength she just demonstrated. If Tang Ruyan could get away and cultivate for a few decades, there was a good chance that she could become a legendary battle pet warrior!

Say she was unable to reach the legendary rank, merely staying at the peak of the titled rank, she would still be the best among all the warriors of the same rank. She could always come back and take revenge!

“You don’t have to say so, Mr. Tang. We’re all willing to repay your past favor with extreme sacrifice!” one of the titled battle pet warriors claimed.

“Exactly.” “You don’t have to ask. Just tell us what to do, you can count on us!”

The other titled battle pet warriors agreed readily.

If they were to help Tang Ruyan get away from the siege, they would have to fight at the cost of their lives. However... since that was what Tang Linzhan needed, they would do so without hesitation!

They would fight till the last drop of their blood dried up! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

That was how they were going to repay Tang Linzhan’s kindness!

After hearing their words and seeing the determination in their eyes, Tang Linzhan, a man who was always full of schemes and plots, was brought to tears.

The fact that those well-known titled battle pet warriors would go to such lengths to repay his kindness was because of the help he had once offered. His help did have a mixture of a scheme in them but he was sincere for the most part.

What he got in return was the titled battle pet warriors’ resolution.

Tang Linzhan was overwhelmed by a surge of emotions but he couldn’t find words to reply.

Standing in front of him was Tang Ruyan who was holding a dark sword, with hair dancing in the wind. She kept a cold glare at the titled battle pet warriors of the Wang and Situ families. She wasn’t the least bit worried about their strikes. But when she heard Tang Linzhan’s words, she began to bite her lip. “I hope you can... help her escape...”

Tang Ruyan was filled with sorrow. However, she was determined not to let it show.

Even at that moment, Tang Linzhan didn’t call her “my daughter,” or “the child of our Tang family,” just “her.”

Don’t I have a name?

Don’t I have an identity?

You gave me my name, father!

So, I summoned all the strength I could and I took the fatal risk to come back, and yet, I couldn’t gain your approval.

Sorrow was burning her!

Tang Ruyan felt a scorching pain in her chest. It was like a hand of flames, squeezing her heart. She bit her lip so that she wouldn’t let out a sound. Since she was a kid, her father had told her time and again that she could never be weak, given her position as the future family head.

So, she didn’t allow herself to be weak.

Even at that moment, she would still follow her father’s advice and stop herself from feeling sorry.

Kill them!

Kill them!!

Tang Ruyan’s eyes reddened. Something was bursting out from the bottom of her heart. Killing intent surged out and the sword in her hand was making a slight noise. As if picking up on its master’s mind and emotions, the sword produced a thick, dark mist, as if crying for its master. That mist climbed up to Tang Ruyan’s arm as if to give her some consolation.

The wind was surging. However, as they reached Tang Ruyan, the wind stopped.

Above Tang Ruyan’s head, her dancing hair was expanding

Everyone was astounded. What has the girl gone through to be like this?!

The people of the Tang family were just as startled. They could not believe that was the girl they had known since she was a baby.

“You...”

In an inconspicuous corner, Tang Ruyu was staring at the vicious girl, visibly confused.

She was sure that the girl was Tang Ruyan. She would recognize Tang Ruyan even if she were a pile of ash. She could misidentify her father but she would never fail to recognize Tang Ruyan.

But...

Tang Ruyan was no longer the familiar girl she knew.

Tang Ruyu was convinced that the girl was Tang Ruyan and yet there was nothing familiar about her. Tang Ruyu had never felt like that before.

“Kill them!!”

The violent killing intent was screaming to find a way out.

Tang Ruyan raised her head. There were some strange and creepy lines on her face. Her eyes were blood-red. She took a step forward.

Demon Possession!

Bang, bang, bang, bang!! The moment Tang Ruyan took that step forward, the titled battle pet warriors of the Situ and Wang Families descended into a momentary daze. Her sudden change was unexpected. The girl seemed to be more intimidating than a battle pet warrior at the peak of the titled rank.

An appalling event happened during that momentary daze. A ripping sound was heard amid the many titled battle pet warriors standing in front of Tang Ruyan.

Before anyone could notice, Tang Ruyan was already standing inside the crowd of titled battle pet warriors.

She took the initiative to strike them!

No one saw how she did it. All they could see was how the titled battle pet warriors of both the Situ family and the Wang family were bursting into a rain of blood! All of them died within an instant!

Horror!

The other people were so frightened that their eyes stared woodenly.

What is she?

No titled battle pet warrior could have done that!

The family heads of the Situ family and the Wang family were panic-stricken, but they reacted quickly. The latter shouted, “Take formation. Dragon King Slaughtering. End her!”

The Situ family head’s senses came back to life as well. Tang Ruyan was like a wolf in a pack of sheep. No amount of titled battle pet warriors sent her way would matter.

“Listen up. Take formation. Seven Star Prison!”

The two families’ titled battle pet warriors collected themselves. Disregard their panic, they quickly adjusted their positions.

After all, they were titled battle pet warriors. They would make the right decision at once after receiving the right reminder.

But when the titled battle pet warriors were trying to get into formation, Tang Ruyan was still waving her black sword and collecting the lives of those titled battle pet warriors!

Bang!

Many of the titled battle pet warriors died before they could even scream. The armors would be cut through the moment they appeared.

The black sword could cut through anything!

Roar!

Roar!!

Startled, the remaining titled battle pet warriors quickly summoned their battle pets.

Those ninth-rank battle pets charged toward Tang Ruyan the moment they came out and they unleashed several different skills at her.

The ground was cracking. Spikes were growing out. Lava was flowing.

“Go to hell!

“Drop dead!!

“I will protect the Tang family!!”

Tang Ruyan’s face was twisted and her voice hoarse. She didn’t even sound like a girl. Her moves had become increasingly more violent. Her hair had turned into many machetes that were flying out as she ran around wildly.

A ninth-rank battle pet of the rock family reached Tang Ruyan, only to be halved by the hair-machetes. The battle pet’s scales should have been hard enough to withstand a missile and yet the scales fell to pieces like paper.

Tang Ruyan was running fast by leveraging the Shadow Tracing skill. She kept on wielding her sword; anything and anyone that came near her would die instantly.

No one and nothing survived!

“She, she is terrifying!”

“I don’t believe this. Is she at the legendary rank? No, it’s not possible!!”

“We cannot set the formation...”

The titled battle pet warriors of the Situ and Wang families were seized by terror. In a matter of a dozen seconds, Tang Ruyan had murdered more than a dozen titled battle pet warriors. It was as if she were merely chopping vegetables. Those who died had been titled battle pet warriors, for god’s sake... Some of them were at the upper position of the titled rank, senior warriors.

Still, they had died within one blow!

What kind of freak is she and where does she come from?!

The titled battle pet warriors who were trying to set the formations were hunted down by Tang Ruyan. She was acting so quickly that they didn’t even have time to discuss a plan. Even though they outnumbered her, they, in a state of disorder, were the ones at a disadvantage!

The Tang family’s battle pet warriors who were still under the containment of the bell’s effect were staring, open-mouthed.

No one could have anticipated this!

One girl overpowering dozens of titled battle pet warriors!

They knew the titled battle pet warriors from those two families; they could not believe that they were being routed. Some of the titled battle pet warriors had tried using secret skills but to no avail; Tang Ruyan would finish them with one swing of her sword.

Invincible!

Untouchable!

Tang Ruyan was like a goddess of war who was overpowering everyone!

The titled battle pet warriors who had been intent on helping Tang Ruyan were frozen on the spot. There was no room for them to step in!

Was she... truly the banished child of the Tang family?

They could not answer that question.

The family heads of the Situ family and the Wang family stared at the chaos with their mouths agape. Even the two of them were terrified by Tang Ruyan.

They were at the peak of the titled rank, and yet, they were being overwhelmed by Tang Ruyan’s momentum. What a terrifying realization.

Only a legendary battle pet warrior could terrify them so!

However, they clearly knew that Tang Ruyan was at the titled rank.

“She’s a monster!”

“How can she change like that? Is she truly human?”

“Is she a demon in disguise? Damn it. Why isn’t he here already?!”

The two family heads were afraid to go over and fight Tang Ruyan themselves.

Boom! Boom!

More and more titled battle pet warriors were dying. Their battle pets were unable to slow her down; she would kill them to get rid of them directly. No one and nothing could stand in her way!

She was like a beast that had been released in the middle of a flock of sheep.

Of course, those were not sheep. They were titled battle pet warriors and every single one of them had once drenched their hands in blood.

“You... both of you deserve to die!”

Tang Ruyan gazed at the two enemy family heads. They were the leaders of the two families. They had to be dealt with!

Kilil

She stepped toward them. To the onlooker, she had been on the spot a second before, then she stood in front of the two family heads the next.

Her hair fanned out and turned into eight machetes that were reaching toward the two enemy family heads.

The Situ family head snarled. He raised an energy shield. In the meantime, a dragon at the peak of the ninth rank appeared before him.

It was a Moonfrost Dragon!

The ground froze as soon as the Moonfrost Dragon landed. The Goddess of Ice shield was being manifested!

However, people heard a cracking sound halfway through the shield’s activation. The Situ family head’s energy shield had turned into broken pieces as well.

Darkness surged. Tang Ruyan held her sword and stood in front of the Moonfrost Dragon.

The dragon flinched as it looked at the coldness emitted by that pair of red eyes. It was seized by an urge to retreat.

Bang!

Tang Ruyan ran past the Moonfrost Dragon. The Moonfrost Dragon’s mouth opened, ready to unleash a skill, but that was the last thing it was able to do. The dragon’s head fell and the cut on its neck was neat.

Its sturdy scales had failed to protect it.

The two family heads were horrified as they looked at the dragon’s head on the ground.

That was a dragon with a peak ninth-rank bloodline!

As a matter of fact, the dragon had reached the peak of the ninth rank and its combat strength was the best. Still, beheading the dragon was like child’s play for Tang Ruyan!

What is that sword she’s holding, to enable her to cut through dragon scales?

“Die!”

Tang Ruyan reached the Situ family head.

She threw herself at him.

Terrified, the Situ family head unleashed astral powers while he took out a bottle. He crushed the bottle, revealing the dark red pellets inside.

He was about to take the pellets when he heard a calm voice. “No need to panic.”

That voice sounded arrogant. Tang Ruyan felt she had bumped into an invisible wall the moment the voice was heard. She was thrown back for more than a dozen meters before she stopped. She rolled her eyes and saw that figure gradually appeared in the air. It was an old man in a simple, cyan robe. There was a jade pendant on his belt. He carried a sword that was wrapped in a piece of cloth on his back. The old man seemed to be otherworldly.

Tang Ruyan recovered from that moment of confusion. Then, killing intent took hold of her again.

A legendary battle pet warrior!

The family heads of the Situ family and the Wang family both breathed in relief.

They bowed to the old man at once. “Lord Xu.”

The old man waved his hand, meaning that they didn’t need to dwell on formalities. He looked at Tang Ruyan from the corner of his eye. He found her quite interesting.

“You’re at the titled rank but you can still unleash such strength. I have never seen one like you before. No wonder you dared to come alone.”

Tang Ruyan stared at him. She could not tell why, but she was not afraid; even though she knew he was a legendary battle pet warrior. “Get out of the way,” she said.

The titled battle pet warriors of the Situ and Wang families were shocked when the old man arrived. After the initial stage of astonishment, to their delight, they realized that the old man was on their side.

With the legendary battle pet warrior present, no matter what Tang Ruyan was able to do, she was a dead person already.

In the meantime, the battle pet warriors of the Tang family were still staring at the old man in a daze. Tang Linzhan thought of something and the realization left him boiling with anger. Finally, he understood why the Situ family and the Wang family would join hands to attack the Tang family. The legendary battle pet warrior had surely given them directions.

He could not believe that a legendary battle pet warrior would go after his family assets.

It was as unethical as an adult meddling when two kids were arguing!

“Legendary battle pet warrior...”

“I cannot believe this...”

The Tang family’s battle pet warriors were astounded.

Even though they didn’t know who that man was, given their titled warrior’s senses, they were sure that the old man was at the legendary rank; he carried an aura that didn’t belong to the titled rank.

Tang Ruyu felt dejected. Hope was just coming back to her when the coming of that old man had thrown a damp towel over her head.

A legendary battle pet warrior was behind the plot against the Tang family!

She turned ghastly pale.

“I’m looking forward to discovering the secrets hidden within you...”

The old man looked at Tang Ruyan with a smile. For a girl at the intermediate position of the titled rank to be able to use such powers... He could not wait to dig out the mystery within Tang Ruyan. Halfway through his sentence, while he still had a grinning face, people heard the noise of something breaking.

The old man’s head fell to pieces!

Even his eyes popped out from his already torn head.

A skeleton’s fist was reaching through the bloodied, broken head!
