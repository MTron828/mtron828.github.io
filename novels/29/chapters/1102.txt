Chapter 1104: The Second World

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Brian called upon his men; two of them immediately dashed out of the crowd and approached Su Ping from two sides. They were going to help Brian suppress and kill Su Ping without giving the latter an opportunity to escape.

All the others fixed their eyes on Shuai Qianhou, who only seemed slightly graver than usual.

“Die!”

Brian cried out and attacked first. He instantly rose and stepped forward, breaking through space. He approached Su Ping and made a stabbing motion with his golden spear, using the laws of time and destruction at the same time.

Su Ping attacked with his sword. The scorching path of fire was swept out; the sword aura was splitting forth, then spreading into the void as an ocean of flames. It blocked both Brian and his two companions.

After a boom, the blade in Su Ping’s hand shook. Fortunately, he had an abundance of deity aura. Even though his law of chaos was weakened, he was still able to endure the attack with his enormous physical strength.

Astral Painting force!

Su Ping unleashed his strength again. The aggressiveness and infinite variations of the Astral Paintings made him more agile than ever. He extended his arms and slashed Brian’s chest with a strange sword technique.

Brian’s expression changed a bit, not expecting that Su Ping would still be able to fight back with that much power, despite the suppression of two supreme laws.

There was a resounding boom, and then he activated his golden battle constitution, which was also one of the top ten divine constitutions. That also meant that he had a third perfect law!

“Golden Sun Constitution!”

3

His body, face and arms were covered in brilliant, golden tattoos. A storm of divine power surged in a blink. All the energy inside his body was temporarily transformed into pure divine power!

He currently became as ferocious and stoppable as an ancient god of war.3

He wielded his golden spear with quick motions, launching a barrage of auras that completely prevented Su Ping from moving.

‘The sharp and destructive spear auras could have easily dealt with normal Star Lords, but Su Ping was also moving quickly slashing away with his sword. Both the sword and spear auras were offsetting each other; their impacts made the soil resound like drums, constantly shattering the earth.

Su Ping seemed to have an inexhaustible deity aura. Even though he was only a Star State warrior, his energy reserves were as large as those of Brian. The latter was shocked, and was determined to kill Su Ping right then and there. He was sure that the man would grow and become a major problem for

him!

“The Path of the Golden Sun!”

After fighting for so long and failing to kill the enemy, Brian finally made use of the path associated with his constitution. A golden sun seemed to be rising on the surface of a sea; it was so sacred and unworldly that many people’s expressions changed.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. Instead of resisting the attack head-on, he quickly moved into the void.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Mitch and Bourne—Brian’s helpers—tried to block Su Ping when he was escaping.

Both had grasped more than one perfect path, but those paths werent supreme; they didn’t dare fight Su Ping head-on, and could only stall him.

“Tce!”

Bourne activated his path. Everything around him was slowed down and overtaken by frostbite. The ultimate state of the path of ice was stillness and absolute zero.

Given such circumstances, even one’s mind would freeze; all atoms would be deactivated. If he wanted to, he could freeze an ordinary person for ten thousand years and then bring them back to life.

However, Su Ping remained unaffected while the wind and dust was solidified. The mixture of the paths of fire and illusion had weakened the ice and broken the absolute zero threshold, quickly thawing the ice.

Concurrently, Mitch had also activated his special path: faith! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Faith was a path that belonged to the mental class. It didn’t look like the basic physical paths, such as wind, fire and lightning. It was similar to space, which existed in the universe but could hardly be detected.2

He could tum everything he imagined into reality.

He was also able to construct some strong living creatures.

Theoretically speaking, he could construct an Ascendant State body, as long as his body could hold up.

He was even able to transform himself into an Ascendant State expert through his faith in a special way. However, his status would be flawed compared to normal Ascendants. Furthermore, he had to sustain the status all the time and it couldn’t last long.

The Ascendant State was forbidden on the central continent; that is why he didn’t really dare to fight in an Ascendant State body.

Otherwise, he could have imagined an Ascendant State finger, which would have been a threat to many unparalleled geniuses.

It only took an instant; the most solid box made of faith appeared and covered Su Ping. It blocked everything, preventing him from escaping.

“Mlusion!”

$u Ping quickly moved and melded the path of illusion into the path of chaos. Unfortunately, his path of illusion wasn’t perfect yet; otherwise, he could have transformed everything in front of his eyes into an illusion!

Boom!

‘The power of chaos surged out. The supreme nature of the power of chaos immediately reduced everything into chaos and broke the cage. Mitch was heavily wounded too, but he was able to hold Su Ping back for one second.

The next moment, the brilliant sun was hurled along with the golden spear.

Su Ping had to turn around and resist it.

Bang!

His body was flung back; his skin burst open and his blood splashed all over. The terrifying heat covered his bones with golden, scorching flames.

It only took one strike; his flesh and blood was separated from his body, and he was turned into a burning skeleton—

But the next moment, a shriek that belonged to the dominator of the skies resounded. A pair of brilliant gold wings was unfolded, regenerating flesh and blood on the burning skeleton. The blood that had splashed over the mud was soon pulled back into his body. He was restored very quickly.

He was then shrouded in scorching flames, and his eyes were golden. He was as majestic as a king.

His ancient Golden Crow Constitution was activated and blocked the terrifying strike!

2

His body had approached the limits of the Star Lord State; he could endure any attack unless it was beyond the Star Lord State!

His Golden Crow Constitution wasn’t as powerful in the past. After all, not even the Golden Crows were truly invincible on their level. However, his constitution absorbed the ancient power of chaos with the help of the Chaos Perception Dragon in the Archean Divinity; it had also developed special

mutations, which further enhanced his power.

All the people on the battlefield felt frightened when Su Ping revealed his constitution; the pets currently merged with them also felt the threat and relayed their fear. All of them felt that their blood was freezing.

Is this his battle constitution?

Brian narrowed his eyes; he had never seen one like it. Also, the pressure was intimidating even for him, but he had one of the best divine constitutions. Did a constitution better than the ten main constitutions emerge in the universe?

Su Ping unfolded his wings, fanning flames that burnt through the void around him. The fire left the primary space and entered the deeper spaces.

The flames kept burning through the deeper spaces and didn’t stop until it reached the sixth space.

Su Ping waved his wings and stepped out with Void Walker and Sun Chaser. He approached Brian in almost the blink of an eye, to slash brutally right after.

Brian was rather cold; although he was astonished at Su Ping’s constitution, the outcome wouldn’t be any different. He gathered the illusion of a small world on his golden spear and threw it.

After a boom, the illusion of the small world dispersed, but Su Ping was also flung back because of the blast.

“Let’s get this over with!” Brian spoke solemnly.

He realized that Su Ping, despite being a Star State kid, had the ability of launching a deadly strike; he didn’t want to get hurt.

Both Mitch and Bourne were serious; illusions of small worlds appeared behind them. Having the support of perfect paths, their small worlds were as solid as planets; both moved towards Su Ping to land a hit.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. It was indeed hight time to be done with it.

Brian was thus far the second strongest Star Lord he had ever seen!

The strongest in his books was Mo Feng, the prince of the Rain Clan!

There was a boom, while a small world appeared behind his back too. It wasn’t the illusion of his small world, but his small world itself!

‘The other three mixed in the fight changed their expressions after seeing the vivid spear behind Su Ping’s back. They didn’t expect the latter to be as crazy and desperate to fight in such a manner!

The small world’s illusion could always be re-condensed, but he could truly suffer from heavy injuries if it was broken. Was Su Ping going to launch a dying strike?

Brian felt gloomy as he sensed pressure from Su Ping’s small world. He didn’t hold back anymore, and evinced brutality in his eyes. Besides the two supreme laws and the golden sun path, he had also mastered three basic paths. He used all of them.

At the same time, his small world truly appeared behind him. The six perfect paths—like six golden dragons—hauled the small world and flew towards Su Ping.

Brian roared and wielded his spear, “Your ancestor was still a monkey when I traveled through space!”

“Lknow a person who also uses a spear. She’s thousands of times stronger than you!” Su Ping’s eyes were cold. He gathered his golden crow power into a hand, hurling down his small world!

After a boom, a dazzling brilliance burst out; it was as if a nuclear bomb would have exploded in the sixth space.

“Abbbhhhh…!”

Brian roared; his battle constitution was falling apart. He gathered all his power into an enormous golden spear, which extended from his small world and stabbed forward.

However, the illusion of a Golden Crow flew out of Su Ping’s small world and grabbed the spear with its mouth. Then, the two small worlds collided without reserve; Brian was heavily wounded. He was flung back, spouting blood, as if having been hit by a train just then.

His small world was as brilliant as the realm of deities. And yet, it was full of cracks at the moment.

Su Ping’s small world was the same.

However, Su Ping was standing right there. He wasn’t pushed back.

“Time Reversal!”

Brian wiped off the blood on his lips and laughed. His broken small world and himself recovered. All the cracks faded; the wounds and blood on his body also disappeared. Everything was back to what it was before the collision. His used power was also replenished.

“Come again!”

Brian roared and stared at Su Ping aggressively.

Su Ping replied rather casually, “Okay!”

‘The next moment—the small world floating above his head quickly recovered, and all the cracks on the surface disappeared.

Brian was stunned by the scene.

But the things he saw next where the most unforgettable.1

Another small world was rising slowly behind Su Ping’s small world,

2

It was truly an unimaginable scene!

Splendid, great and terrifying!

That was… a second small world!

Not just Brian, even the aides Mitch and Bourne stopped to see. They were stunned and couldn’t believe their eyes.

‘The two small worlds had overlapped; one of them was desolate, while the other was illusory and hazy. Such terrifying auras made them feel as if they would have faced the abyss.

“Come again!” Su Ping said.

In the next moment—the two small worlds were pushed forward..
