Chapter 1566: Failure
"Stop!"         

    

The Mother of Chaos immediately rushed forward. The currents of chaos were instantly stirred and followed her. She seemed to be hauling the whole world with her.     

"You're late."     

Right in front of the stone plate—the light dimmed a little. It turned out to be a magnificent figure, both a mountain and an abyss at the same time, quietly glancing at the Mother of Chaos with unparalleled condescension.     

Su Ping knew it was the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's original self, which appeared as a perfect great god. However, it was just a vision based on his own understanding. Every species would see an image they most revered.     

Perhaps only the system knew its true appearance.     

Bang!     

The intimidating sword aura passed by and split the chaos, tearing time apart like a cannon able to destroy stars. However, the astounding sword aura was suddenly turned to particles when about to reach the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

A shining green light covered his body.     

The radiance seemed gentle; however, it was a terrifying protective shield.     

The Mother of Chaos's expression changed greatly upon witnessing such a result. She shouted in shock, "Impossible!"     

The ultimate being gave her a light smile and said, "I have to thank you for attacking me with so many people twice. Wars are always painful, especially the lost ones. The grief and agony they can produce are beyond your imagination!"     

The Mother of Chaos stared at the green light covering the latter. All her aggressiveness was gone at that moment, temporarily losing her cool.     

Su Ping noticed that the system was acting oddly and quickly shouted, "System, what's wrong? That is the Chaos Core, right? Why did you stop?"     

The system was stunned for a long time, frustration and bitterness showing in her beautiful eyes. "A miscalculation on my part. I didn't expect that he would already be fused with the Chaos Core. Destroying him will destroy chaos…"     

"Fused…"     

Su Ping's mind was blown.     

He looked at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao in disbelief. So, chaos would restart no matter how the battle ended?     

"Why?"     

Su Ping found it hard to understand. The system had planned for such a long time, and even had someone like Kun Peng infiltrate the enemy. No doubt she had other arrangements he didn't know about. But now… the enemy is occupying her vitals?     

"The Core of Chaos acknowledged him as master?" asked Su Ping quickly, "Isn't the Chaos Core what gave birth to you? How can it be owned by someone else so easily?"     

The system said, gloomy and frustrated, "I was detached from the Chaos Core since birth. This Ancestral Land of Chaos needs its own support and power. Technically speaking, the Chaos Core gave birth to me, and I created the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors… Right now, he's already fused with the Chaos Core. We don't stand a chance."     

She looked frustrated, already giving up.     

That's right. She had made countless plans and arrangements, but she knew she had lost.     

The stronger someone was, the clearer the situation was to them. So, she knew it was pointless to struggle when there was no chance of turning the tables.     

Weaklings would often be incapable of reading the situation clearly. Even if it was hopeless, they would still try their best. They would only end up drained in the end, facing defeat in utter despair.         

    

A miracle?     

Someone the likes of the Mother of Chaos knew there weren't any. Everything was inevitable, following the Great Dao trajectories.     

Su Ping and the others found her words hard to believe.     

They had traveled a long way, some resurrected from the river of fate and gathered from countless universes. However, the battle was already over as things stood.     

"Mother!"     

Among the lives from cultivation sites—several streams of energy gathered and formed a figure emitting a Sorcerer Ancestor's powerful aura. He asked with a contorted expression, "Is it over?"     CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Su Ping looked at the newcomer. He didn't know him; however, judging by the aura, he instantly realized it was Yuan Shi who had long died in battle.     

The latter carried the chaos bloodline, making him easily recognizable to the former.     

It came as a surprise, as Su Ping didn't expect the allegedly dead guy to have been in hiding, his being split among different people from the cultivation sites.     

"We lost." The Mother of Chaos was gloomy. Her doom was approaching. Chaos would be dominated by the Heavenly Dao in the future; all her preparations had been for naught.     

"Kun Peng betrayed me and gave me wrong information. The Chaos Core betrayed me too…" Kun Peng's betrayal was within her expectations and she wasn't too surprised by it. However, the Chaos Core betrayal pierced deep into her heart.     

The core that nurtured her had actually sided with the enemy.     

Could it be that the Chaos Core also felt that the world she created was too terrible?     

"Mother…" Yuan Shi wore an awful expression. He had been hiding for a long time, and never expected such an outcome.     

He also understood the current situation, knowing that turning things around was impossible.     

The odds of winning were more than fifty percent in the beginning, but they had just turned to zero.     

"Your era is over. Now comes the perfect paradise I will build."     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao smiled. "There will be no slaughter, no fights, only eternal peace. I will no longer feel the misery of the people. When they're miserable, I am miserable. I won't feel their despair anymore, only happiness!"     

The Mother of Chaos gave up fighting, and made no effort to refute.     

Being forsaken by the Chaos Core made her doubt herself, despite persisting for such a long time.     

"I know you saved a lot of methods for the next war. You didn't use all your trump cards, fearing that you wouldn't stand a chance if you failed this time."     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao smiled again and added, "Unfortunately, there won't be a next time. Sorcerer Ancestors Yuan Long, Ling Tai and Kun Peng have fallen into my hands. They have the power of creation. They have weathered through countless eras of pain and misery in this world. My power comes from the origin of pain. I'm not like you, who got everything from chaos."     

"Shut up!" Yuan Shi roared, "You call yourself Heavenly Dao, and yet you're building an inferno of pain. You're no longer the pure Heavenly Dao. Quoting you, you are already infected; you just haven't realized it yet!"     

"I was born from the prayers of the people. They only pray in their most miserable moments, beseeching joy and happiness."     

The foul being continued after a smile. "Everything I do, I do to fulfill their prayers! I'm going to build the eternal and perfect world that everybody longs for! You say that I'm infected, but my determination has never changed. It's just that some sacrifices are needed to fulfill this wish."         

    

"Hilarious!"     

Yuan Shi was going to continue, but the Mother of Chaos stopped him.     

"Yuan Shi, no need to argue with him. Those who fail are always in the wrong. We lost; it's useless to talk. You should run right now. He's already fused with the Chaos Core and cannot be parted from it. You'll live even if chaos restarts," said the Mother of Chaos.     

Stunned, Yuan Shi gritted his teeth. "Mother, I haven't been laying low just to stay alive!"     

"I know!" she interrupted and stared back at him. "But you should know that unnecessary sacrifices are meaningless."     

Yuan Shi saw the ruthlessness in her eyes and felt sad. He also knew that they had completely lost, now that their opponent was fused with the Chaos Core.     

But… He was unwilling to surrender.     

"Ask Yin Que and the others to leave. Quickly."     

The Mother of Chaos turned around and looked. She was ablaze with power; more so than ever before. There was no chance of winning, so she wasn't saving her strength anymore. She released her pressure, and everybody experienced the territorial power of the person who had dominated chaos for countless years.     

Bang.     

The sword auras raged. Yin Que and the other Sorcerer Ancestors were fighting the Heavenly Dao humanoids; their opponents suddenly fell apart.     

The sword auras ignored distance, simply mincing and killing them.     

"Mother."     

The Sorcerer Ancestors were shocked upon sensing their mother's aura. The Golden Crow ancestor quickly said, "Mother, no need to worry about us; we can take care of them. Please save your strength!"     

"That won't be necessary. We've already lost; you should leave now," she replied.     

All the Sorcerer Ancestors were stunned, finding it hard to believe. We lost?     

They had already fought twice, but they had never lost as fast. It was even their first time seeing the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

The Golden Crow ancestor reacted and quickly asked, "We lost? Why? Is our enemy too strong for you? Or were we too late to help you?"     

"The Ultimate Heavenly Dao has fused with the Chaos Core; there's no chance of winning. You should leave!" said the Mother of Chaos.     

Her children were stunned, as if struck by lightning.     

They were filled with doubt and shock, understanding the gravity of the situation. Their enemy had actually ended their battle, once and for all!     

Shi Mang couldn't help but say, "He fused with the Chaos Core… How is it possible? You would have sensed his intrusion as it happened…"     

She stayed silent; that was the main source of her grief.     

Her reliance on the Chaos Core was the cause of such a failure.     

The Heavenly Dao invaded the core and fused with it, but she didn't feel a thing. That could only mean that the Chaos Core had voluntarily isolated her, choosing the Heavenly Dao.         

    

Otherwise, the latter would have been incapable of severing their connection.     

"You should also leave."     

The Mother of Chaos's body changed. She expelled Su Ping, the Inferno Dragon and the other pets out of her body and canceled the merging state. She even injected her own power into Su Ping and the rest as they detached, all to restore their power to peak status.
