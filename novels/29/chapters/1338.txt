Chapter 1339 Original Dao World (2)

Shockingly, Elder Chan looked at Su Ping and said with a smile, “Qian Hong, the unbeaten Dao Child has already condensed a Dao Heart of her own; she’s only looking for alternatives. It was a good thing you didn’t pick her; otherwise, you would have surely lost. After all, she’s already half a God Emperor.”

Su Ping was stunned. He vaguely remembered the looks of the other two Dao Children; he didn’t realize that the plain-looking woman was so awesome.

Shen Mo-the rather cool looking Dao Childwasn’t actually as strong as he appeared. “I didn’t mention this to you since you weren’t a Dao Child yet. Although I’m close to humans, I couldn’t reveal a Dao Child’s secret that easily,” explained Elder Chan, fearing that Su Ping would misunderstand.

Su Ping quickly shook his head and said, “Senior, you’ve already done me a great favor by offering me so many tips.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Feeling at ease now, Elder Chan said, “Fortunately, you’re not as arrogant and headstrong as other geniuses. You must know that you might break easily if you’re too hard. It’s best not to reveal your true sharpness all the time; it should be hidden in the sheath.”

“I understand, sir.”

Su Ping nodded.

“Now that you’ve sensed the Original Dao World, you’ll be able to practice a lot of other remote-killing skills. Mine might not be the most suitable for you, but they have their own specialties; not too destructive, but they’re hardly noticeable. You may want to seek Elder Yan Huang if you’re looking for the most destructive ones.”

Elder Chan chuckled and added, “She has a skill that allows her to kill someone located in a different continent, with ninety percent of your original self’s power. It’s just that it might be too eye-catching.”

Although Su Ping was stronger than others at his level, he had developed all his skills in life-and-death battles; they were quite suitable for him. However, God Kings who had cultivated for a much longer time than him knew much more skills.

He was able to kill them not because he was more knowledgeable, but because his power was overwhelming.

Now that he was part of the Heaven Path Institute, Su Ping certainly loved to pick up as many skills as possible; he wanted to grasp all skills that were easy to pick up and useful.

......

Maybe those skills would come in handy later on. On the battlefield in his universe outside

—he wouldn’t have a chance to break free and return to the cultivation site to continue his training every time.

“I’ll go visit Senior Yan Huang later,” said Su

Ping.

Elder Chan nodded. “First, I’ll teach you the Shadow Finger. Considering your cultivation, you’ll only be able to unleash 50% of your power if you attack a target on another continent. It’s a very covert move; your targets may die if caught unprepared. However, this skill won’t give you much of an advantage if they’re on alert.”

“As for Yan Huang’s skill, her target will be able to sense and defend against the attack even if they’re unconscious. They’ll survive if they can defend. If they can’t, they’ll die. These two kinds of skills have their own merits.”

“I understand, sir.”

Elder Chan stopped talking and began to communicate with Su Ping via telepathically. He parsed the skill and conveyed it to Su Ping.

Such a skill launched attacks through the Original Dao. The power could be transmitted, even though the target was on another continent; however, it heavily burdened the user.

Several days later,

Su Ping woke up in his conscious space; he had already grasped the Shadow Finger. Elder Chan didn’t hold anything back as he transmitted his teachings; it was very easy to understand his transmission. He was considerate and explained in detail whenever Su Ping had any questions.

“You may try it out.” Elder Chan looked at Su Ping with a smile. The latter had mastered the skill in the conscious space, but he had never tried it in the outside world.

Su Ping examined himself and then sank into his consciousness. The world around him changed; the buildings were replaced by the Original Dao that began to spread in all directions. Su Ping’s senses expanded toward infinity. He then gathered all his power and pointed his finger.

On a neighboring continent, in the wilderness, there was a God King beast sleeping in its nest. All of a sudden-it seemed to have sensed something and suddenly opened its eyes.

There was shock in its bloody eyes. After all, its body suddenly exploded, and a chaos-like shadow passed by. The beast wailed and its body was slowly healing. It looked around in shock, trying to locate the enemy.

But this was its territory; there was no threat within a range of tens of thousands of kilometers.

Inside the Toad Fish Palace-Su Ping breathed heavily. He felt he had used 80% of his power, but his attack only carried 40% of his strength; the reason being that it was the first time he performed the skill and he wasn’t familiar with it yet. A lot of power was dispersed.

Su Ping could tell his power was unleashed and attacked some sort of beast. He didn’t see the specific picture; however, he sensed that the beast’s vitality aura was weakened via the Original Dao World. Still, it did not perish. The attack was obviously not enough to kill the target.

Nevertheless, judging by its vitality, it must be heavily wounded. My attack was not in vain, thought Su Ping in delight.

He had practiced while often brushing the borderline between life and death, and he wasn’t short of skills in battle. However, he had never learned the current kind of special skills until he entered the Heaven Path Institute.

It’s good enough that I was able to hurt a God King. Those in the Celestial State could be killed right off. In any case, it’s a threat to those guys. Su Ping’s expression turned cold as he remembered what happened during the conference on the Astral Nexus.

“It seems like you’ve mastered it.”

Elder Chan sensed that Su Ping had struck a target via the Original Dao World. Furthermore, Su Ping had specifically picked a beast in the wilderness, not a god, which made him feel comforted.

“Thank you for your guidance, senior.” Su Ping quickly clasped his hands in salute.

He finally understood how the Rain Clan tracked him down the moment he showed up in the wilderness. They must have sensed him by following his aura in the Original Dao World.

The Rain Clan already had his aura memorized. If a God Emperor were to keep searching, he would be spotted the moment he left the institute’s territory and reveal his aura in the open.

However, since he now knew how to get in touch with the Original Dao World, he was able to hide his own aura. Even if he left the Original Dao World, he had the ability to mask his aura to prevent detection.

“There are a lot of places in this world that can’t be perceived through the Dao World; those must belong to the major forces.” Su Ping could see a lot of dark places through the Original Dao World; they seemed to have been dug out. However, those places weren’t deserted. They must have been covered up in some way to block any probing.

After thanking Elder Chan again, Su Ping bids him goodbye and goes to see Elder Yan Huang for further guidance.

Yan Huang looked like a girl around eighteen years of age, but her face was so cold that no stranger would dare approach her. Her eyes were as brilliant as stars, and the powerful aura she emitted made it impossible for anyone to truly mistake her for an innocent girl; she was undoubtedly a woman far stronger than most people.

There was astonishment on Yan Huang’s face after hearing Su Ping’s question. Obviously, she didn’t expect him to already tap into the Original Dao World after just becoming a Dao Child. Su Ping’s age was apparently not very old; that couldn’t be disguised, at least not in her eyes.

In terms of talent, he’s even much stronger than Qian Hong… Yan Huang did some comparisons and felt shocked. She looked at Su Ping solemnly.

There was a small chance that such a genius could rise and become an Ancestral God!

One had to be aware that all the Ancestral Gods had once been unbelievable talents that changed everyone’s understanding of geniuses.

Yan Huang didn’t hold back; she told Su Ping everything. Although seemingly aloof, her explanation was extremely thorough; he felt rather flattered. He also noticed that Yan Huang was much warmer than she looked, at least to him.
