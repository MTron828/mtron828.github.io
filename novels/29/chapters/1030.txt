Chapter 1032: Ascendant State

“Ascendant experts are really prudent, but don’t bother. This trip is totally worth it.”

The young man didn’t want to gossip about an Ascendant behind his back. After all, they had just talked to the man for a bit; he was worried that the latter would have ways to eavesdrop on their conversation. They knew how terrifying and capable the top ranking experts of the Dark Tower were.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, the one-eyed young man changed his expression. “Did you feel anything?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The charming woman was stunned for a moment. She narrowed her eyes and spread out her senses, but nothing came from the probing. She was about to shake her head when the one-eyed young man changed his expression and roared, “Move away!”

After a boom, the void was torn apart, and two sword auras slashed down.

The one-eyed young man reacted the fastest; he escaped into the void, reappearing thousands of meters away.

The charming woman was quite fast too; her body disappeared like rays of light, then reappeared in the distance.

The last young man had yet to realize what was going on, but the hideous pet in his arms had sensed something. It shrieked, unleashing a small world that looked like a honeycomb, where countless cocoons were buried in holes. It was rather scary.

The small world covered the young man while he fled. However, one of the sword auras managed to hit it; the small world immediately shook and then exploded. The sword aura flattened all the holes in the small world, and glowed. The hideous pet screamed and trembled in the young man’s arms, bleeding hard.

Without any ado, Su Ping shouted coldly, “Die!”

The entire planetary system had been wiped out, just so that they could kill him. The assassins of the Dark Tower had no respect for life, at all.

His clone also attacked the charming woman.

Su Ping unleashed his small world, and the law of time was spread out. The time and space nearby was consolidated; Su Ping was going to reverse time and bring them back to life!

“The law of time?”

The assassin trio looked somber as they saw how sand and stones were moving in reverse around Su Ping. Fortunately, all of them had released their small worlds and used them as buffers, which could prevent them from being corrupted by hostile laws.

It would require a lot of time if their target wanted to tear their small worlds apart.

“Nightmarish Charm!”

The stunning woman was shocked and wary as she looked at Su Ping’s clone charging at her. The clone was so intimidating that she found it hard to tell whether or not it was Su Ping’s original self. She knew that he had the Prime Sky Mirror, and what the artifact could do. But how could his clone—which was only half as strong as his original self—be so terrifying?

She used her special secret technique without hesitation.

Hers was a natural demonic constitution, a rare one related to spirits which endowed her with a mental power much greater than what those at her level would have. If Yin Xing hadn’t said that Su Ping’s mental power was much higher than hers, she and Zi Tong would have killed Su Ping in the illusions.

Su Ping’s clone stopped for a moment, but quickly broke free; silver light darted out of its eyes, which was Su Ping’s condensed mental power. It was strong enough to cut through everything, unless his opponent’s willpower was greater.

“Annihilation!”

Right when the clone attacked, Su Ping raised his hand and squeezed the young man.

It was just a simple movement, and yet the entire void collapsed. His small world was quickly manifested. Enhanced by laws such as time, space and speed, the law of destruction hit the young man’s small world, piercing through it unimpeded.

Ever since his small world was perfected, Su Ping was able to crush any Star Lord’s small world with his own, unless his opponent had also reached the peak!

“Divine path…” cried the young man in fear. Golden light circulated in his small world and fell to pieces before he could mend it. A terrifying aura was immediately spread to reverse the flow of time. He was then surrounded by the power of his small world. Although he managed to stop the reversion, his mind gradually slowed down and his body stiffened.

“Damn it!”

In the distance—the one-eyed young man was shocked. Su Ping was much stronger than he expected; he was even more unbelievable than how Yin Xing described. He even suspected that Su Ping had already become a Star Lord. However, how could any Star Lord be as terrifying?

The alluring woman was trying to flee from the clone. She had already sensed the smell of death upon seeing the young man be defeated by a single attack, so she cried to the one-eyed young man, “Captain, stop hesitating. It’ll be too late if you don’t attack! They must be dead already!”

The one-eyed young man felt cold; Su Ping’s unexpected arrival meant that their plan had failed and his teammates had very likely been killed. Only three members remained from the team of six. The young man they had high hopes for was even suppressed and defeated by Su Ping.

Both he and the alluring woman were better at mental attacks, but Su Ping was even better!

“What kind of bloody mission is this?”

The young man couldn’t have felt more regretful. He gritted his teeth; his body had already taken action. He had to take a chance, or all of them would die!

“Come out!”

Roar!!

A deafening roar came from the one-eyed man’s back, breaking Su Ping’s space and time blockade. The space nearby seemed to have been caught in a swamp that had tied everyone up. An indescribable, awe-inspiring, yet frightening aura was spread out. It was the Ascendant State aura!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He coldly gazed at the summoning vortex behind the one-eyed young man, from which a creepy head craned out. The head seemed to have been skinned, as it was bloody, while covering it seemed to be wriggling. Following the head, an enormous body crawled out.

The body was thousands of meters long, covering the entire sky.

The buildings nearby couldn’t endure the unrestrained pressure; all of them exploded and fell in the dust.

“An Ascendant State pet…”

Su Ping was quite gloomy. He had wanted to finish the battle as quickly as possible because he was worried about such a situation happening; although the chances were low, he was truly lucky to meet one.

“You just had a good share of food. I’ll give you some more if you kill him; you can eat as many people as you want in the future!” The one-eyed young man looked at the behemoth in fear. He had acquired that pet in the Home of Havoc, which served as his team’s ultimate weapon. However, it was extremely ferocious and terrifying, all because it had grown up in the Home of Havoc!

It might attack its own master at any time!

However, he didn’t have any other choice. The pet was his only hope.

Su Ping became even more sullen after hearing that. Many of the people who had been slaughtered in that star system might have been fed to the monster.

Retreat!

Furious as Su Ping was, he decided to step back; after all, the gap between them was too wide. The Ascendant State was too powerful for him at that moment; he couldn’t even beat the weakest Ascendant!

However, before he left, Su Ping exerted fifty percent of his strength with God’s Arrival and condensed all his laws into an ultimate sword aura. He then stabbed forward with his small world and the power of faith.

After a boom, the young man who had just woken up from the time pause was stabbed through. His eyes widened, as if he couldn’t believe he would die that easily.

The scary beast in his arms cried sorrowfully.

Bang!

On the other side—Su Ping’s clone roared and went on a rampage as it fought against the alluring woman, igniting all of its strength and small world to catch up with the woman and kill her!

Once it managed to kill the target, the clone exploded too due to energy overuse.

The two things almost happened simultaneously. Su Ping didn’t even have time to look at them; he simply escaped with the Prime Sky Mirror.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

The one-eyed young man saw the miserable deaths of his two companions. None of the measures that they had set in place had been put into use yet; Su Ping was simply too strong and unstoppable. The battles merely took two to three seconds. They were so strong that even the second place holder of the Divine Lord Rank they had ambushed in the past would have had to struggle in order to kill them; however, Su Ping was much more terrifying than that guy!

The one-eyed young man’s pet mimicked his actions and roared. It moved its scary eyes to gaze in Su Ping’s direction, to then open its mouth and inhale.

Space was immediately broken. Chaotic spatial power was absorbed by its mouth, but Su Ping was already gone.

The beast seemed to be infuriated. It shook, then vanished into deeper spaces.

Su Ping swiftly reached the seventh space with the help of the Prime Sky Mirror, wasting no time to charge at the eighth space.

The Prime Sky Mirror could keep him safe in the seventh space, but the eighth space was completely different.

Su Ping didn’t bother to hide his aura. He then quickly jumped back to the fifth space and concealed his aura. Later, he jumped back to the sixth space and escaped further and further away.

“Freeze!”

Once he arrived in the fourth space, Su Ping threw out a water ball and transformed it to resemble him, making it look alive.

After his vitality law was perfected, Su Ping was already able to create living creatures. However, he wasn’t yet capable of creating real souls and complete lives.

Still, if there was a soul, he could provide it with a living body to dwell upon.

He left part of his consciousness in the body he had just created, to then continue traveling. He repeated the process in every space layer.

Soon, Su Ping found that the body he had left first was torn apart when it was resisting blade torrents in the fifth space.

“It has locked onto me…”

Su Ping gloomily flashed nonstop. He had already left the Blue Castle Planetary System. However, instead of appearing in the primary space, he kept jumping into deeper spaces and leaving his clones behind.

He entered the eighth space again to leave immediately after. The eighth space was so dangerous that Su Ping felt scared every time he went there. He had the feeling that he might get lost there forever if he stayed for one more second.

The mysterious whispers and chaotic energy in the seventh space were being blocked by the Prime Sky Mirror, and Su Ping didn’t really feel a thing. That was why he was able to reach the seventh space even though he was only in the Star State.
