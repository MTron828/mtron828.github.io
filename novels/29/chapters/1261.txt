Chapter 1263 World-Destroying Heavenly Tribulation (2)

Mo Ri had barely summoned a bloody Heavenly Tribulation during his Ascendant breakthrough

Was the talent difference between him and Su Ping that large?

“Unfortunately, you have to die, no matter what sort of genius you are. Students with top scores aren’t necessarily the most successful, and geniuses won’t necessarily become the strongest, either. You must be lucky and clever so you can rise!” Mo Ri’s eyes were cold. He raised his weapon and charged at Su Ping again, swinging the Nether Saber.

Exactly at that moment-a black lightning bolt fell abruptly and smashed his body.

Mo Ri’s expression revealed shock. He quickly swung his blade to resist, only to be pushed thousands of meters back; his body shivered.

Was I considered his helper? Is this the power of a world-destroying Heavenly Tribulation? It’s almost as powerful as a Celestial’s strike with full force!” Mo Ri was shocked. He also realized why few people had survived a tribulation of that caliber.

How could a Star Lord resist those powerful lightning bolts?

Whoosh!

In the distance—Ye Chen was flying back after being knocked away by Su Ping. He was blushing furiously; a Celestial like him had been sent flying by Su Ping. It was humiliating.

He tore time and space to return quickly, and was hit by a black lightning bolt as he was getting ready to attack the young man.

“Damn it!”

Ye Chen instantly realized that he too was considered as Su Ping’s helper; it was impossible for him to explain. The tribulation terrified him; he was no longer as ready to attack.

But how could he wait while Su Ping finished going through his tribulation?

“Don’t worry; I don’t think he can survive it. The tribulation has only just begun.” Mo Ri approached him and dismissed his power, all to avoid being noticed by the tribulation.

Ye Chen was gloomy. “That kid is backed by the magic store. What if he has some ultimate lifesaving treasure? He’s already too strong with a Star Lord level. If he reaches the Ascendant State…”

He trailed off, but Mo Ri understood what he meant. His feelings were a mess.

Su Ping would probably become a threat even to Celestials if he broke through.

Such an idea would have been taken as a joke in the past, but Su Ping had challenged their common sense and worked miracles time and again; neither of them dared to underestimate him.

“He won’t last long, since he was wounded by my Nether Saber. We can’t attack him, but we can disturb him in other ways,” said Mo Ri.

Ye Chen’s eyes glittered. With everything coming to that point, it was the only thing they could do.

Su Ping embraced his second lighting strike while those two considered how to interfere.

The attack was thirty percent stronger; Su Ping detected the aura of death. The power was comparable to the attack of a Celestial expert with their small universe. He was forced to detonate another small world, and with it unleashing a stream of power. His sword auras became more dazzling than the stars, and he slashed the lightning strike!

The remains of the lightning bolt didn’t disperse; they instead surrounded him like a web and he soon felt as if he were in a swamp. His every cell was torn apart and destroyed.

Su Ping gritted his teeth and attempted to reassemble his cells. His body was continuously destroyed and regenerated; the process was repeated hundreds of times until the lightning’s power faded.

Su Ping now felt that his body was much harder; the astral vortices inside his cells were much more condensed. The stars in his body also became more solid. They’re having second thoughts about attacking? Su Ping noticed Mo Ri and Ye Chen’s passive stance and raised his eyebrows. He instantly figured out what was going on; the tribulation itself was unexpectedly lending him a hand, in a way.

If that was the case, he only had to go through the tribulation and break through to the Ascendant State; he could fight them afterwards.

It’s a shame that I couldn’t take a path as I planned. On the other hand, how did I invoke a black world-destroying tribulation with seven small worlds? Was there a misjudgment because I detonated my small worlds?

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. However, a sharp soul blade pierced into his brain before he could give it more thought.

He instantly realized who the attacker was. He roared in his mind space, condensing a hellish skeleton demon to crush the blade.

The power of the soul race coexisted with the Primitive Chaos Clan bloodline in his body. He was especially talented when it came to soul techniques, and was even able to resist Celestial attacks.

“Damn it!”

Mo Ri grunted in shock. Su Ping’s soul power is even greater than mine? How is that possible?

The kid hasn’t lived more than a century, while I’m a Celestial who has lived hundreds of thousands of years. My soul has been tempered with the passage of time. How can this kid surpass me?

Clouds surged again at that moment, and lightning bolts descended.

The black colored lightning stretched down like tornadoes connecting the sky and the earth. This time, they weren’t just aiming at Su Ping; the scope included the entire City of Sins, and both Ye Chen and Mo Ri who were next to him.

The City of Sins was also purified by the black lightning bolts. The ground was torn apart and all substances were obliterated. The people who were hit by the lightning were reduced to nothingness before they could scream. Even their souls were gone; they completely vanished from the universe.

Such a scene made many people flee in panic, as none of them wished to stay any longer.

Many experts who were observing the battle from a distance also ran in fear. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“The tribulation doesn’t discriminate targets?”

“Why is this happening? I was almost hit, even though I concealed my aura.”

“I read from an ancient book that the world-destroying Heavenly Tribulation eliminates all substances and lives within its range. Is that true?”

“How’s it possible? The range of this tribulation is too vast; everything can be destroyed within!”

Everybody was shocked. None of them could understand why the tribulation was also attacking observers like them. They had concealed their auras, and none of their actions could have singled them out as helpers.

Furthermore, they thought that the attacks were indiscriminate, considering the lightning strikes.

Except for Su Ping at the very center-who had already endured the accurate strikes of three lightning bolts—the other lightning strikes had randomly swept across the ground and destroyed countless buildings.

Bang!

Su Ping tried his best to resist those three lightning strikes, but he was still smashed deeply into the ground.

The extra bolts of lightning struck down before he could stand up. He felt as if having been torn to pieces, and his consciousness was rather blurry.

I can’t resist this tribulation? The idea popped up in Su Ping’s head and found it absurd, as he had already experienced countless tribulations. Not once did he expect that he would die in one!

Looks like they’re also being attacked by the tribulation…

Su Ping glanced over and saw that Mo Ri and Ye Chen were also being hit by the lightning bolts and was more or less comforted.

He gritted his teeth and got back on his feet at the bottom of a pit, then looked at the three small worlds floating behind him back.

In any case, I must see this through. Su Ping took a deep breath and detonated another small world before he swung his sword.

The three lightning bolts were cut to pieces. However, their resulting fragments surrounded Su Ping once more, as if he were a magnet.

They gradually formed a web around Su Ping, separating him from the rest of the world.

Su Ping detected a change of both time and space, as he was transferred elsewhere by the power of the tribulation. He was drowned in an ocean of lightning.

Su Ping could no longer sense Mo Ri or the others. It didn’t feel like the Mayhem Star Zone anymore.

The constant power of lightning outside of the web destroyed Su Ping’s body nonstop. He responded by reassembling his body again and again, using his accumulated power.

“The World of Heavenly Tribulations remains; they have the same origin. I hope this small world works…” Su Ping hurriedly activated the seventh world and tried to send the black lightning inside. That was too much for him to handle.
