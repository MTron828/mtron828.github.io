Chapter 1374 Faith (1)

Everybody became hopeful upon seeing that there were enough Celestial experts. If they could truly establish a mid-sized Titan Divine Array… they would probably have a shot at contending with a universe dominator!

“Let’s practice,” said Su Ping, unwilling to waste any time.

Shen Huang nodded and said to the group, “Considering that Xiao Su is the strongest, he will be responsible for the core; he will be the head and everybody else will take other parts of the body. Any objections?”

“Nope.”

“It’s only natural.”

Everybody nodded. Even though they had a conflict in the Astral Nexus’ conferencing room, all hostility toward Su Ping and Shen Huang was dropped once the alliance was established. Even if some were still angry, they prudently held back to face a greater enemy together. “All right, let’s begin.”

Shen Huang instantly transmitted the chapter of the mid-sized Titan Divine Array to the team. Su Ping had just given it to him; it would have been useless to have before, as there weren’t enough Celestials.

Very soon, both warriors and pets received the information. They began to practice. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Su Ping turned into the divine array’s main node. He released his own power and accepted everybody else’s.

The first practice ended in failure soon after. Some Celestials didn’t even figure out how the divine array operated; they made mistakes and the array collapsed.

Nobody blamed them. After the failure, Shen Huang encouraged the group to try again. No words were said as they quietly reestablished the divine array.

After failing time and again, the mid-sized Titan Divine Array gradually took shape.

Meanwhile, in the fortress outside

The worms were surging and swallowing the second defense line.

The worms had easily reached the second defense line through the opening made by the alien. A fierce battle was taking place; many Ascendants went to the battlefield with their pets.

Blood, torn limbs, bombardment, bellowing…

In the middle of the vast battlefield-caught in the heated atmosphere, all the battle pet warriors had forgotten themselves; they only had the faith of fighting until they could beat back the worms.

“Dad, will we win?”

Back on the planets, behind the defense line —the residents were watching the life-and-death battles on the big screen. All the entertainment programs were stopped at the moment. All the people of the different star zones and planets—whose skin, eye and hair color was different-were wearing the same expression.

They were praying, deeply worried. A father gritted his teeth and said, “Yes, we will certainly win!”

“Those are the Retts. They’re charging again!”

“I didn’t know that the cowardly Retts could be so crazy!”

“I hope that they’ll survive…”

Many races loathed each other in the vast universe. However, some people were discovering that some races they hated from the bottom of their hearts were actually much different from how they had imagined.

Their understanding of those races had been based on media and rumors. In fact, most ordinary people would spend their entire lives in the comfortable cradle made by their race, never really getting to know the outside world.

They discovered that many things were different from what they had imagined, once they saw the feed with their own eyes.

Boom!!

While everybody watched, eager and nervous, the second defense line didn’t stand stably as everybody was praying for. Rather, it was being torn apart and more Ascendants died. As for the weaker Star Lords and Star State cultivators, they were falling like dust all the time; too many of them died.

As the worm tide approached, a noise burst out of the deeper spaces next to the second defense line. A massive hole appeared in the void, with arms and heads darting out.

Those limbs and heads were extremely huge. There were wounds on their surfaces, but the blood was dry; all of them were dry corpses.

Torn arms and heads were thrown away. Meanwhile, a hideous and scary figure crawled out of the hole. It was none other than the alien from before.

The entire defense line was in turmoil upon seeing the alien. The battle-frenzied warriors sobered up, as if doused with cold water.

All of a sudden-a strange syllable sounded, echoing throughout the void.

The second defense line was abruptly solidified, as if frozen. The next moment, a heartbreaking scene took place. All the battle pet warriors at the defense line—from the weaker soldiers to the strong Ascendant commanders-exploded and were pulverized like smoke.

The appalling scene on the screen made the entire Golden Star Zone fall silent. All the people watched in a daze, nearly suffocating.

“How… was that possible…”

The command center was silent.

The advisors from all star zones of the universe were gathered there. They were the smartest people; and yet, they were all dazed and confused. Such power was not something they could tackle using their wisdom.

In the silence, someone roared, “Wake up, all of you!”

The roar drew everyone back to reality.

An advisor continued, shouting with blazing eyes, “The battle isn’t over yet. We can’t give

up!

“All the Celestials are practicing the Titan Divine Array; we need to buy them more time!

“Until the very last moment, not even gods can make us lower our heads!” His roar shocked and woke them up.

Maybe because of his words, and maybe because of the desperate situation, a strong eagerness to survive and the terrifying surge of faith when humans resisted disasters started bursting out from them.

“That’s right! We must stall him!”

“Even if we have to block him with our bodies, we have to hold him back!”
