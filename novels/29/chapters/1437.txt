Chapter 1438 Dao Ancestor (2)

The power unleashed by Su Ping was indeed strong, but he was definitely not an Ancestral God.

“Go to hell!”

A golden light slashed down as the Chentian’s Ancestral God released a Dao skill, which passed through Su Ping and cut his body to pieces.

The senior expert waved his hand casually, burning Su Ping’s remains into ashes.

“You were truly a rare genius. What a shame,” mumbled the Ancestral God. Even though they were enemies, he had to admit the brat had an amazing talent. Was it due to the ferocious beast’s bloodline mutation?

He suddenly had an idea, but he kept it for another time. He was going to leave for the battlefield, but then he froze all of a sudden.

A crack appeared ahead of him; Su Ping slowly came out and his aura gradually reached the peak.

“That guy failed, so you came? You don’t seem to be any better,” said Su Ping provocatively after resurrecting. He feared that the guy would join the others to attack the Chaos Perception Dragon. The only thing he could do was help it stall an Ancestral God.

“You!”

The Chentian Clan’s ancestor gazed at him as if he were looking at a ghost. Goosebumps ran all over his body. It quickly dawned on him why the Rain Ancestor said he couldn’t kill the boy.

He had killed the target, but the target had uncannily resurrected. What is going on? “What are you?” said the man, staring at Su Ping with fear in his eyes. He couldn’t understand how he was able to resurrect. He was an Ancestral God, an expert who mastered the greatest power in the world, being almost omnipotent and omniscient. Finding something he couldn’t understand gave him a real shock.

Su Ping wasn’t even interested in replying to the same question. He didn’t mind ridiculing the Rain Ancestor, but he wasn’t the least interested in talking with that strange Ancestral God.

“The Heavens may arrive in this world any moment now. You are Ancestral Gods, aren’t you aware of their existence?” asked Su Ping.

The expert’s body shook. “Are you one of the Heavens?”

He soon disapproved of the thought. “No. I’ve seen the Heavens. You’re not one of them!”

“You’ve seen the Heavens?” Su Ping was rather astonished by the answer. “Where? The weakest forms of the Heavenly Dao?”

“What’s it to you? Who are you exactly?” demanded the Ancestral God of the Chentian Clan.

Su Ping suddenly grew furious. “Cut the crap. Where did you see the Heavens? If you’re aware of their presence, you should know that they may arrive with all their forces at any moment and destroy the world of gods. And yet, you choose to fight amongst yourselves?”

The Ancestral God was stunned for a moment, seeing the young human’s angry look. Then, he sneered and said, “We’re here to eliminate the ferocious beast and save billions of lives. You think we’re fighting each other?”

“If the Heavens arrive, all the lives in this universe will be terminated. The Chaos Perception Dragon can also fight alongside you to resist the Heavens. Is this not a civil war?” roared Su Ping.

“Ha. I’ve seen the Heavens. They’re not as strong as you claim; I wonder where you heard the rumor. Did the guys in the Heaven Path Institute tell you? If they’re so terrifying, the Ancestral Gods of the Heaven Path Institute should have called us to discuss the matter,” said the god disdainfully.

“You’ve only seen their weakest members.” Su Ping was gloomy. Even if those Ancestral Gods were enemies, there were still people in that world who had tried their best to protect him, both humans and the Heaven Path Institute. He knew that he would need their strength if the Heavens did arrive.

“The stronger Heavens are even more terrifying than you. Do you think you’re already at the apex of all cultivation?” said Su Ping, holding back his fury.

The Ancestral God raised his eyebrows and gazed at Su Ping. “Brat, you seem to know a lot of stuff. You’re questioning our capabilities? Yes, we haven’t reached the legendary Dao Ancestor level. But are the Heavens truly that terrifying? Are their strongest members on par with Dao Ancestors?”

“Maybe not even Dao Ancestors can hold them back!” said Su Ping.

The Golden Crow ancestor could very well be a Dao Ancestor. However, it was still avoiding the Heavens; it wasn’t hard to imagine how terrifying the Heavens were.

“Ha!” The Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God smiled. “The Dao Ancestor level is the origin of everything and the final destination of all cultivation. They’re immortal, and know everything in the world. And yet, you say they don’t stand a chance against the Heavens? You don’t know what you’re talking about!”

He launched another attack.

A shadow rushed toward Su Ping like a whip. The latter instantly mustered all his strength and slashed furiously.

The sword aura was shattered and Su Ping’s body was forced back.

“Rot in hell!”

The Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God was gloomy. His attack of Ancestral God grade was blocked by a mere God King. He used 70% of his strength, in an attempt to completely squish the boy and see if he could resurrect.

Boom. Su Ping couldn’t resist; his body was obliterated.

However, he quickly came back to life. Seeing how dazed the god wasChentian, he said, “You can’t understand why I can resurrect, just like you don’t know how terrifying the Heavens are. There are many things in the world that you don’t know. Don’t think that you’re almighty just because you’re Ancestral Gods. You’re just frogs at the bottom of a well!”

“Impudent!” the Ancestral God roared, but he was truly shocked and furious.

Every word uttered by Su Ping had cut deep into his heart like a sharp edge.

Indeed. He had focused all his attention, but he was still unable to tell how the human could resurrect.

It was as if he were created by the Great Dao out of nothing.

But what kind of power was involved?

Is it a Dao Ancestor, an existence that all Ancestral Gods look up to?

Ancestor would

He soon shook his head. A Dao Ancestor would have the power to suppress them all with a mere thought if he were truly on Su Ping’s side. Why bother let Su Ping waste time talking?

However, he truly couldn’t understand that strange resurrection.

Is it some forbidden skill of a certain clan? Or maybe the bloodline ability of this ferocious beast? The eyes of the Ancestral God glittered, feeling that Su Ping was carrying a lot of secrets.

“I suggest you go back and get ready for the arrival of the Heavens. It may happen 100,000 or more years later, or it may happen tomorrow. This war concerns all the living creatures in this world. You must prepare, even a million years in advance!” said Su

Ping.

“Ha. You’re just an alarmist!” said the Ancestral God with a cold smile. “Although I don’t know how you resurrect, it’s fine. We’ll study you after we take care of that ferocious beast.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Su Ping clenched his fist, overwrought with fury. He didn’t expect that those Ancestral Gods would be no different from the Celestials he interacted with in his universe. They never changed; only doing so until a disaster truly happened.

Whoosh!

The Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God ran towards the Chaos Perception Dragon’s universe, ready to join the other gods. Trying to kill Su Ping was just a waste of time.

The longer he stayed, the more likely something would happen on the other side.

They had prepared a five-people array, based on their estimates in regards to the Chaos Perception Dragon’s combat ability. The array’s full power couldn’t be fully unleashed when he was absent. He had to join them.

Noticing how the god was running away, Su Ping quickly said to the dragon elder via telepathy, “Senior, take me to your universe. I will fight by your side!”

“That’s unnecessary,” was the dragon’s cold response.

“Senior, no need to worry about my safety; they can’t do anything to me!” said Su Ping in a hurry.

After a moment of silence-a vortex appeared and he quickly entered.

Beyond the vortex was the dragon’s universe. A massive battle was taking place.

He actually allowed me to join the battle, which means that it’s difficult to deal with those five experts, thought Su Ping. The thought left him with a heavy heart.

On the other hand, the Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God returned, significantly reducing everybody’s pressure. The Rain Ancestor quickly asked, “How did it go? Did you kill him?”
