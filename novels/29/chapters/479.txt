Chapter 480 Over 10 in Combat Strength

In an instant, Qin Duhuang and all the others had left, as quickly as they had arrived.

The storm quieted down.

The onlookers continued to sigh and exclaim with strong emotions, even after the big potatoes had left and the two pets were no longer there. Some of the onlookers began to develop some ideas. They couldn’t compete against any of the tycoons that could offer to buy the properties with some enterprises or the street of gold, but they could buy the buildings in the surrounding streets!

It was likely that the prices of the surrounding areas would go up once the tycoons moved to that street. The ripple effect would kick in.

As such, some of the onlookers began to leave, to go back and discuss their grand plan.

Su Ping went back inside since the two pets had been sold.

Soon after, there was another noise coming from the sky. Again, an advanced flying battle

pet.

From the bird jumped a man. He hurried to the store and looked around. He quickly spotted Xu Yingxue who was standing by the store’s front. “Yingxue, how is it? Are the pets still here?” the man asked in haste.

Xu Yingxue forced a bitter smile. Her captain had arrived too late. Everything was over.

“Someone else bought the pets, the family head of the Qin Family,” Xu Yingxue explained, “The other family heads were here as well but none of them got here in time.”

The man could not believe it.

Sold out? The family head of the Qin Family?

“Were the pets at the peak of the ninth rank?” the man asked.

“Of course. Why else would the family heads come here in person? You weren’t here to see them contending against each other...”

Xu Yingxue found saying those words a hard job. She wasn’t in a good mood. She would have grabbed the chance herself if she were any more powerful; she didn’t have to think hard to know how much stronger she would become. If she were at the eighth rank, with a pet like that, she could crush a lot of titled battle pet warriors!

A once in a blue moon chance had just slipped away right in front of her.

The man found it hard to accept. The realization that he had missed the chance pained his heart. “What was the price?”

He would feel better if the price was so high that he could not afford it. He thought that the family heads would certainly enter a bidding

war.

Xu Yingxue cast him a look of pity. “Sixty million,” said Xu Yingxue with a straight face. “... (._.)”

The afternoon arrived. Su Ping was ready to visit the cultivation site after all the customers left.

Before he did, Su Ping told Tang Ruyan to take Zhong Lingtong to where she lived, to prevent them from freaking them out when he teleported back. He didn’t want his secret to be revealed.

Once again, Su Ping was being all mysterious as he trained pets. Tang Ruyan rolled her eyes at him. Anyway, she could not complain. Things were better for her at the moment. He would throw her into the scroll before, but he no longer restricted her personal freedom. She had nowhere else to go so she decided to take the time and show Zhong Lingtong around the Longjiang Base City.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Zhong Lingtong agreed happily. She was curious about the base city that Su Ping was from.

Su Ping closed the door after they left. Together with Joanna, and the pets for professional training, they set off to the Demigod Burial.

Joanna had been eager to return to the Demigod Burial, just like Su Ping.

Joanna couldn’t go back to the Demigod Burial when he was away. She was worried about her subordinates and that they would go into fits of panic. After all, her return would be regular on previous occasions, but she had taken a bit longer this time.

Soon, a God Warrior showed up and fetched them from the island where they had landed on randomly, then he took them to Joanna’s castle.

Her subordinates were more than thrilled to see her royal highness return.

Su Ping didn’t send Joanna to start working right away; he told her to comfort her subordinates first. After everyone calmed down, Su Ping gave the pets for professional training to Joanna. Same as before, she took the pets to somewhere dangerous while he could stay in the castle and constantly bring the pets back to life.

Taking advantage of his time there, Su Ping decided to go through more rounds of Heaven’s Testing

Also, he could go to see the Celestial Gods with whom he had trained last time. He had some questions for them.

On the mountain, Su Ping summoned the Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon, and the Little Skeleton. Before he told the Little Skeleton to practice its saberplay with a Celestial God, he first tried the Enlightening Guide on the Little Skeleton.

It went quite well. Soon after, the talent of the Little Skeleton went from “N/A” to “elementary agility talent”!

The explanation was:

Enhance the overall speed one fold, valid for one minute and the cool-off period was five hours!

The word “overall” spoke volumes. It didn’t just mean the speed at which the Little Skeleton attacked. It also applied to the speed of energy flows and the aging process.

Of course, speeding up the aging process was not a positive effect but the consequences were bearable since it was just one minute. The speed increase for energy flow was great. For example, if the Little Skeleton had to use five seconds to prepare for skill, the preparation time would be shortened to 2.5 seconds with the elementary agility talent.

That talent would be very useful, whether in traveling, dining, or anything else.

Just as he had expected, the Little Skeleton’s combat strength was increased to 19.9!

That 0.1 gap was another matter.

Why would the system have to leave that decimal point? To get past the last 0.1 had to be difficult or else the Little Skeleton’s combat strength would not be stuck there.

What a stupid way of scoring.

Su Ping heaved a sigh but didn’t bother the system about it. The Little Skeleton should be equal to a legendary battle pet warrior at the peak of the Ocean State at the moment!

The 0.1 points would be the critical divide to let the Little Skeleton reach the Void State.

But the Little Skeleton is just at the seventh rank. This is not bad, Su Ping “comforted” himself.

The Little Skeleton’s aptitude rating had climbed back to above average.

There had been some ups and downs. Su Ping wondered what the grading above the first-rate was. Would there be another ranking list?

He shook his head. It was of no use to worry about this. Su Ping told the enlightened Little Skeleton to go and learn saber moves with Uncle Celestial God.

Then Su Ping enlightened the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon as well.

Enlightening, enhancement, and rule of thunder!

Su Ping used all of his training skills on his battle pets. He was never stingy in that regard.

The Inferno Dragon had also picked up some skills of the thunder family. Even the Purple Python did, too.

To Su Ping’s delight, he realized that the Inferno Dragon’s combat strength had reached 10, finally! It was at 10.5 right then!

Indeed, once the score surpassed the threshold, there would be a small but drastic increase.

The Inferno Dragon was also at the seventh rank. It had become a mature dragon. It was a seventh-rank dragon that was comparable to a beast king with above-average aptitude. Su Ping thought it was good enough.

The Purple Python’s combat strength was still lingering at 9.9 and its rank was the sixth. After all, the Purple Python’s bloodline was of the sixth rank. The Purple Python would be unable to climb up in rank without evolving. The extra astral powers that the Purple Python absorbed would have to be expelled since they couldn’t be contained in its body.

After the enlightening, Su Ping took his pets to the Heaven’s Test.

The notice Joanna had made public would always be valid. They heard from the God Warriors in the temple castle that some could not wait any longer and had already taken the test. But still, a few were waiting.

Su Ping felt sorry that he missed those chances. He decided to really sponge off from the rest of them.

Soon, the Heaven’s Test began. The mountain that had been quiet for a long time was bathed in thunder and lightning again. The huge thunderclouds once again appeared one after another. The powerful ones who lived in nearby cities were alerted.

Some of the old-time residents in the cities had become used to this by then. They would comfort the newcomers and said that there was no need for making a mountain out of a molehill and that they would see that phenomenon again as long as they stayed there long enough.
