Chapter 1489 Slashing the Tribulation (2)

The still-healing tribulation clouds were torn apart again, the gaps growing larger.

The Ancestral Gods were already solemn and expressionless in the distance.

Su Ping’s undying universe wasn’t truly remarkable. However, his bloodline poweralong with the terrifying power of the world —made him much stronger than ordinary Ancestral Gods!

This didn’t mean that he was capable of killing Ancestral Gods, though.

!!

He was only slightly stronger. Defeating them was possible, but not killing them.

Still, such a capability in itself was unbelievable. After all, he was still going through the tribulation. Furthermore, experts of that level would have to cultivate hard for hundreds of thousands of years to become stronger than their peers. Everybody had reached their limits, and any kind of progress was difficult, however small.

“Come again!” Su Ping roared and made a third slash, this time invoking the power of the world within 500,000 kilometers, thus making him even stronger than before. There was so much power that he had to hold his sword with both hands.

Then, he slashed in a different direction, drawing a massive “X” in the sky.

The clouds surged, and destructive black lightning bolts darted from both sides. They could easily pierce through the universe.

There was intense killing intent in Su Ping’s eyes. He directly gathered the power within 600,000 kilometers, and his power was more terrifying than ever before. He was getting close to his limits.

The enormous power was gathered in his body. Su Ping held his sword with both hands and attacked.

All the lightning bolts in the sky were extinguished.

However, the golden sword aura didn’t disperse. It was thrown further into the sky, causing another opening in the clouds.

“You don’t deserve to be my tribulation!”

Su Ping didn’t stop. He summoned the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon to merge with them at the same time.

A violent power surged into his body, dragons scales and sharp claws appearing. Minuscule Dao Glyphs were added to the ones already etched onto his body.

A dragon head and a wolf head, both thousands of kilometers tall, appeared on his shoulders like clouds. However, they simply looked petite in proportion to the gargantuan Su Ping.

Roar!

The Inferno Dragon roared. Its mind was connected to Su Ping’s and sensed his emotions. It knew that Su Ping needed power, so it didn’t hesitate to burn its soul and unleash all its power to infuse his master’s body.

The Dark Dragon Hound was also roaring at the clouds ferociously. All the power in its body was sent to Su Ping, establishing plenty of shields to protect him.

Su Ping was further strengthened by the two pets. His exuberant power made him feel capable of squeezing the sky apart.

He bellowed and invoked the power of the world again, this time reaching his limit of 800,000 kilometers!

Time and space seemed to be shaking. Infinite power from the world of gods surged into Su Ping’s body, who then felt that his body was melting. Such made him think there was nothing he couldn’t easily destroy.

Condense!

Su Ping gritted his teeth and gathered the power in his hands. A dazzling golden power was manifested, with hands as brilliant as suns as he detonated his universe.

“Break!!” Su Ping roared and swung his sword, launching a dazzling sword aura to the

sky.

The clouds covering the area shook violently. A huge pillar of lightning was condensed in the middle of the clouds and rushed to meet the sword aura.

But the next moment—the lightning pillar was easily torn apart.

The sword aura sliced the pillar like tofu.

The sky within a radius of a million kilometers turned into a pure gold color. The ones observing at ground level saw this spectacle as a brilliant river of gold stretching to infinity

Those watching from a distance would clearly see a golden sword mark.

The entire sky near Su Ping was golden and the clouds were gone!

While looking at the brilliant golden river above and feeling the terrifying energy fluctuations, all the emperors shivered. Is that the power of an Ancestral God?

When Ancestral Gods were furious, they could tear the world apart!

The few Ancestral Gods witnessing the phenomenon were silent, mulling over complex feelings. Although they hated to admit it, they knew that the young man could easily be counted among the strongest Ancestral Gods.

He wasn’t yet on par with the old monsters of the Seven Families, but he was definitely one of the top gods!

Su Ping stopped attacking and gazed into the sky, as he could tell that the clouds were ebbing and would not gather again. There was a crack spanning a million kilometers, and the clouds were collapsing.

He had destroyed the Heavenly Tribulation for Ancestral Gods.

It had been a truly destructive test controlled by the Heavens, but he didn’t see any of them.

They didn’t show up despite such provocation. Then, why would they destroy so many universes? Su Ping stared at the sky, feeling that the Heavens were rather unpredictable.

In any case, the system seemed to know a lot of secrets about them. Since he had become an Ancestral God, the system would tell him everything after upgrading the store to level

Su Ping looked at the Purple Python, the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon and the rest, then said softly, “You guys should hurry up. The upgrading prerequisite for a level-9 store is to cultivate an Ancestral God pet. Your Dao Hearts awakened a long time ago. It’s time to create your undying universes.”

All the pets were rendered speechless by the demand. They were already smarter than humans at the moment. For how long had they been God Emperors? Only someone like their master would expect them to become Ancestral Gods that fast.

Su Ping kept waiting patiently. Ten minutes passed, and the clouds were completely gone. He had officially passed the tribulation test.

Although he didn’t receive the tribulation’s power at the end, he wasn’t regretful.

He had the Dao of Tribulation and could simulate tribulations to nurture his body. He didn’t need that gift.

“It’s over!”

“He really drove away the world-destroying tribulation…”

“It seems that a powerful species will be born very soon.”

The Ancestral Gods watching from a distance were heaving sighs. Who knew that such an unbelievable thing would happen? They could tell that something groundbreaking would take place very soon.

Whoosh!

A few figures flashed by. The Ancestral Gods made an appearance.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered, but there was no surprise in them; he had already sensed their powerful auras while transcending the tribulation. He asked calmly, “Who are you?”

“Congratulations on achieving immortality.”

“Congratulations!”

The Ancestral Gods offered praises with smiles. Since they were already there, it wouldn’t hurt to greet such a badass. In all honesty, they didn’t really care about friends or even their own clan; Su Ping had reached their level and deserved some respect.

Ancestral Gods would live forever. This meant that they would get to see Su Ping’s face often for the rest of their lives.

“Thank you.”

Su Ping nodded, as he saw that their intentions weren’t malicious. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The experts introduced themselves and talked with Su Ping for a while, then left one after another.

Being lofty creatures, they had no need to suck up to anyone. No matter how strong Su Ping was, he couldn’t break the rules of the gods. Besides, they were too strong to have any worldly desires; they were only aiming for the cultivator’s final destination. They lived without a care for anyone else’s opinions, nor they needed to hold back. They were truly free.

Su Ping resumed his human form after they left.

He concealed his aura and examined his surroundings. He instantly approached the human emperors.

Emperor Xin and the others were stunned by his presence. Then, they bowed respectfully and addressed him in the most respectful way possible, “It’s an honor to meet you, Human Ancestor!”

Dazed, Su Ping quickly said, “That’s too much, seniors. You can just call me Su Ping.”

“We wouldn’t dare, Human Ancestor,” said Emperor Xin quickly.
