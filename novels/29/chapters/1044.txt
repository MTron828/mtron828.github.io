Chapter 1047: Return of the Dragon King

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

There was an earthquake in the continent where the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons lived. The adventurers who were near their habitat retreated in panic; they sensed that something shocking seemed to have happened to that mountainous forest region.

All the people traversing the continent heard a dragon roar at a certain moment.

It was the unified roar of thousands, possibly more Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons, who bellowed at the same time.

The sound seemed to convey their respects.

…

At the Pixie Pet Store in Woffett City—

Su Ping was still training pets inside the store. He received a lot of customers who had asked for professional training; he was currently the only person able to do such training.

He received a message from Green Lady when he returned from the cultivation sites in the evening; she told him that someone from the Ryan family had wanted to see him.

That came as a slight surprise for Su Ping. The Ryans were the rulers in all of Rhea; however, his identity was already well known. No one dared to disturb him unless it was really necessary.

“Where are they?”

“Outside the store.”

Su Ping opened the store, then saw many customers forming a queue beyond the stairs. Two old men from the Ryan family were standing on the stairs; they seemed friendly and respectful.

“What can I do for you?” asked Su Ping straight away.

“Master Su, we’re here to ask if the riot caused by the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons was something intended by you. Do you want us to deactivate the barriers?”

They were the current leaders of the Ryan family. Still, they were excited and in awe, not expecting they would have a chance to see him; they knew something about Su Ping, but not all of it. After all, the young man’s identity was graded tier 7, which was usually for those in the Ascendant State; not even lords of normal planetary systems would be qualified to investigate him.

They had investigated the riot through satellite observation and security cameras. They found that the white dragon, which started the riot, came from Su Ping’s store.

That was why they respectfully went to Su Ping’s store and asked for his guidance.

They would have to abandon the dragons if Su Ping had intended for that to happen, even though dragons were highly profitable for their planet—

After all, even that planet had been pushed by Su Ping. Wasn’t it obvious who the master of the planet was?

“Dragons rioting?”

Su Ping was stunned for a moment. It was clear that it was Little White’s work; he didn’t know what it was up to.

Energy waves surged in a void section ahead of him. Then, a sickly white-haired boy—who seemed rather unhealthy—slowly walked out.

However, if anyone looked him in the eye, they would find he was exceptionally calm and determined.

“You’re back.” Su Ping put on a smile and waved at him.

The leaders of the Ryan family narrowed their eyes in fear. Once they saw Su Ping wave his hand, they immediately realized there was some sort of relationship between them, and their shock grew.

The white dragon that caused a riot and suppressed all the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons turned out to be Su Ping’s pet!

So, was the white dragon simply carrying out Su Ping’s orders?

Both of them sweated hard. Was the trip over completely unnecessary?

“Have you taken care of things?” Su Ping looked at Little White and asked solemnly, “Have you made your decision?”

Little White gazed at Su Ping for a long time, before he finally said, “Master, I don’t want to leave you.”

Su Ping felt warm; he then patted the other fella’s head. “What about your parents?”

Little White lowered its head and said, “I’ve already told them my decision. There’s also something else I want to ask of you, master.”

“Huh?”

“I want to lead my people and search for an independent planet that we can claim as our own!”

Little White raised its head and looked Su Ping in the eye; the youngling’s eyes were clean, filled with tenacity.

It was hard to see such determination in a human kid, mostly because Little White had cultivated his personality during the life-and-death battles, back in the cultivation sites.

Su Ping felt slightly dazed; he looked at the boy’s unwavering eyes, vaguely realizing why he was doing that.

Anyone who saw their compatriots hunted by other races would find it unacceptable.

Humans had conquered beasts in the past, turning them into pets that would fight alongside them as partners.

However, some humans used to regard pets as battle tools that would act as scouts in dangerous places, then die for their masters!

That was the reason why Su Ping didn’t slay the Tiger Grief back in the Archean Divinity.

Every problem had a root. Su Ping preferred to address the roots of problems!

“So to speak, you consider them as your compatriots. Have you accepted them, and have you also been accepted by them?” Su Ping didn’t reply; instead he petted his contracted beast with a smile.

Little White was slightly dazed. Then, he lowered his head, as if feeling awkward.

Su Ping saw through what was on his mind and chuckled. “Don’t feel embarrassed. Jst let the bygones be bygones since the situation didn’t escalate. A strong man should always keep an open mind!”

The boy nodded heavily.

“You’re more than qualified to rule over a planet. I’ll find a planet suitable for you later,” said Su Ping.

It was really easy for him to purchase a planet at that moment.

Furthermore, as long as he expressed his intentions, countless people could offer planets to him.

Little White felt excited; he quickly thanked Su Ping, “Thank you, master!”

“There’s no need to thank me.” Su Ping squeezed his cheeks with a smile.

Little White was finally relieved, and he flashed a silly smile.

He knew that the universe was dominated by human beings, even though billions of other species also lived in it.

Without Su Ping’s protection—no matter how strong he was—he would be found by other experts if he led the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons out of Rhea; all of them would be caught and domesticated.

Finding a place that belonged to them was his goal, so that his people could live in peace.

That seemed to be a simple matter, but Su Ping was the only one who could do that for him. Very few masters would purchase a planet for their pets.

Even if they did, their pets had to show enough value first.

That young man before them, however…

He didn’t care about returns.

He put on a brilliant smile, with his face shrouded by sunlight. The boy couldn’t help but wear a silly smile too. Even though he had a terrible childhood and nearly died, all his misfortunes seemed to be leading him to a fortunate man and partner.

…

The two leaders of the Ryan family were dumbfounded by the conversation they overheard between Su Ping and Little White. They were even in greater awe of Su Ping, who was going to buy a planet for his pet.

They couldn’t even compare to his pet!

All of them wanted to ask if he was still short of pets.

They could work as pets too. They could play cute, or serve tea!

Unfortunately, Su Ping was clearly uninterested in them. They could only smile apologetically and prepare to leave.

Su Ping asked them to forbid anyone from hunting the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons until he purchased a planet and had them relocated.

The two of them quickly accepted the request and said goodbye in an awkward manner.

The customers waiting in line were similarly dumbfounded.

Could he be more extravagant?

The man is buying a planet for his pet!

Normal people often hesitated for a long time when they bought precious food for their pets, and had to ask their creatures to fight so that they could earn the money back. And yet, Su Ping was giving a planet to his pet!

That kind of love was truly eye-opening!

Everybody looked at Little White with jealousy.

By then all the people present understood that Su Ping was only running the store for fun, because his training expertise was disproportionate to the prices he charged.

Does he want to make money?

No, he only wants to have fun!

“His store is only open for half a day. What does he do in the second half of the day? Fun!”

“As expected of Boss Su. I’m truly impressed!”

“If anyone complains about how lazy Boss Su is because he closes his store early… I know what to say back to them.”

“Boss Su’s pet is rather unbelievable. It caused a riot and even transformed into a human being. What level is that pet right now?”

Everybody made excited remarks, mixed with other feelings.

They knew that Su Ping was powerful and rich. However, his casual decision of buying a planet was a direct demonstration of his wealth; it was so straightforward they were greatly shocked.

Some women in the crowd winked at Su Ping too.

Once he heard their discussions, Su Ping knew he had talked too much, having forgotten to mute his voice with a barrier. He hurriedly slipped into his store with Little White.

It’s true that nobody can refuse a man who’s rich, powerful and handsome!?Su Ping closed the door with mixed feelings.

Next, Su Ping simply reached out to Loulan Feng.

He would rather not ask his master to help him, as the matter was too trivial.

He already had too many connections with the Loulan family for him to keep a distance from them. Compared to the gifts the Loulan family master had offered, a mere planet was nothing.

Soon after, Loulan Feng replied to his message.

Su Ping told him about the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons and asked him to find a planet suitable for them.

Loulan Feng felt dazed; he didn’t expect Su Ping to ask him to buy a planet for a pet. However, he had seen a lot of things, and such a request wasn’t as surprising. That thing had happened to some members of the Loulan Feng family before.

Some of his family members loved their pets so much they would buy planets and turn them into playgrounds.

The members of a big universe-level family were that rich.

Loulan Feng quickly took care of that matter. The planet was being registered; the paperwork would be completed in eight hours. Then, the process would be complete.

The planet would be registered under Su Ping’s name, which was fine by him.

He continued training pets after the purchase of the planet was completed.

Little White was caught by the Chaos Beast and became his playmate.

The new dragon king appeared like a happy and carefree kid, playing and having fun in Su Ping’s store at the moment.

Su Ping gradually understood something through Little White’s incident.

He realized the significance of his store, and what the system was trying to teach him.

And that was: partnership!

There were countless hostile species in the universe; it wasn’t wrong for anyone to believe in their own species. On the contrary, those who sympathized with other species and loathed their own were seen as stupid and cowardly.

Real sympathy required courage. It wasn’t about betraying one’s own species and presenting oneself on the moral high ground, but about trying hard to change things one hated and complained about.

Human beings suffer injustices in many worlds and are treated like ants, beasts or pets!

Humans are the dominators of this universe, and regard every other species as a pet. However, pets aren’t just battle tools!

Only if we regard them as partners can humankind coexist with all the other species.

Only such humans deserve the respect of other species! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If we are evil too, are we even qualified to have other species respect us?

If we rely on our fists and strength all the time, our screams will be worthless if we’re eventually butchered by other species!

Although the strong preying on the weak is a universal law, if the strong can show mercy, being considerate to the weak unlike the condescending gods… Then, why not?”

Su Ping knew he was only capable of changing the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons’ fate by giving them a peaceful land.

However, that couldn’t address the source of the problem.

If all humans regarded pets as partners, then one day, the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons could eventually be willing to step out of the planet they were offered, and voluntarily fight alongside humanity.

Once I reach the Celestial State, my words will be more powerful. The things I want to express will be more persuasive!?Su Ping understood the fact, and craved strength even more.

A few days later passed, then a letter addressed to Su Ping arrived from the Celestial Court.
