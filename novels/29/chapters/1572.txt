Chapter 1573: Prayer of the People (2)
The Ultimate Heavenly Dao had a gloomy expression as he saw this happen; killing intent surged out as he suddenly took action. The Heavenly Palaces were instantly fixed. At the same time, a vast lightning bolt ocean was gathered around him, and a divine spear was slowly created!         

    

Just the appearance of the spear was making people feel an infinite sharpness, as if pierced through, even though they were hundreds of universes away.     

They were so frightened that they vomited just by looking at it.     

"Come on!!" Su Ping roared. He was no longer in the mood to consider anything else at the moment; too much blood had been shed. The world had fallen apart and billions of species had gone extinct. He only wanted to end everything.     

Even if he failed, he would burn the last drop of his blood!     

The violent sword aura contained the power of six Chaos Qualifications, as well as the strength of the experts from a hundred advanced cultivation sites and thousands of others. It was like two thousand universes colliding. The blast could have rendered a Sorcerer Ancestor unconscious.     

The fixed Heavenly Palaces collapsed. The sword was unstoppable, destroying the thirty-three Heavenly Palaces, once and for all!     

Bang!     

The sword struck the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's shoulder, severing his arm.     

Cold killing intent appeared on the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's face. The ominous lightning spear made an instant, piercing move.     

Su Ping instantly felt that his heart skipped a beat. It was as if everything around him were frozen. Even the power inside his body was isolated; he was like a weak mortal standing in a snowy world, facing arrows in all directions!     

Is this… the real gap?     

Even though he was far stronger than a Sorcerer Ancestor, Su Ping didn't expect that failure and death were still inevitable!     

Frustration! Fury!     

Sadness.     

"In the end, I couldn't save you…"     

There was a boom—a powerful shock wave passed and a person appeared in front of Su Ping. It was none other than the Mother of Chaos.     

There was a brilliant crystal in her palm, blocking the terrifying lightning spear like a shield.     

Su Ping recognized the object, similar to a Dao Crystal, but carrying an extremely special aura.     

A Chaos Core fragment…     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao's expression turned gloomy when he saw the crystal. The Mother of Chaos was born from the Chaos Core. The object had fallen from the core when she was born. It was the most formidable weapon in chaos.     

"With everything coming to this point, I'll finish the last part of this journey with you. It will also be the last journey of our lives," said the Mother of Chaos as she looked at Su Ping.     

There was a helpless, yet tender look in her eyes.     

Dazed for a moment, Su Ping smiled and said, "Let's go together, then. The Little Skeleton and the others are waiting for us."     

The Mother of Chaos smiled back. Her smile wasn't worn out by time, and her beauty seemed frozen in eternity. "Let's not keep them waiting, my host."     

She gradually turned into a burst of light and surrounded Su Ping as she spoke.         

    

Su Ping felt he was enveloped by her power. It was warm, familiar, conveying indescribable emotions. He then knew he had done the right thing. There were certain favors and feelings that couldn't be abandoned.     Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Having spent more than ten thousand years together, they were already the most intimate partners.     

"Since you acknowledged me as your master in this life, I will protect you with my own!" said Su Ping, his voice soft as he smiled. He didn't need to say anything else; he knew that the system was back.     

She was no longer the Mother of Chaos at the moment.     

There was only the 'bitchy' system that had accompanied him for a long time.     

Boom!     

Inside Su Ping's body—thousands of universes seemed to be exploding. An indescribable, terrifying power erupted from within.     

"Mother…"     

Yin Que and the other Sorcerer Ancestors were stunned by her actions.     

They all realized that their mother had given up the most honorable identity in chaos, then turned into Su Ping's pet. Furthermore, she wasn't just a pet connected to Su Ping via the contract. He was the complete master while she worked as support. She abandoned her whole being, only keeping her consciousness.     

It wasn't her throwing everything away; she offered it to Su Ping.     

Su Ping had become the inheritor of all her former being and power.     

Having the Mother of Chaos's body and the six Chaos Qualifications, Su Ping gained control of an unprecedented amount of power. For the first time, he realized exactly how strong the system used to be.     

"Looks like all of you are terribly ill!" said the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's, eyes dead cold, "I can just finish you off once and for all, so that there won't be any residue when chaos is restarted!"     

The lightning spear was revolving at a quick rate; more and more lightning was gathered. Concurrently, the other Heavenly Dao forces were quickly combined into a couple of Chaos Heavens.     

Those newly formed helpers quickly flew towards the Ultimate Heavenly Dao and fused with him.     

Su Ping was adapting to the system's body and looking at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's real form. He had long realized that the other humanoids were just clones to extend the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's excessive power.     

The ultimate nemesis became even more terrifying as the Chaos Heavens fused with him.     

"It's time to do it!"     

Su Ping was soon accustomed to the system's body. He charged at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao without hesitation the next moment.     

Bang!     

The sword aura glittered. The entire Ancestral Land of Chaos seemed to be cut apart. The thirty-three Heavenly Palaces protecting the Ultimate Heavenly Dao exploded as soon as they reappeared.
