Chapter 1446 New Universe (2)

All those present exchanged fearful looks after hearing Su Ping’s warning.

Even if their intentions weren’t malicious, they would be trespassers nonetheless; the local experts would certainly not know whether they were friendly or hostile.

Besides, if they were too weak, the most normal reaction would be to either destroy or enslave them.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As for making new friends… Would humans make friends with livestock? They had better things to do.

“Should we go in?” asked Chi Huo.

Everyone looked at Su Ping. He had told them that they had to look for more allies out there, after leading them out of their universe.

There were Undying State experts in that universe; it was definitely a potential ally. Still, it remained to be seen whether or not they would want to establish an alliance.

“We need to go in, but we must sneak in first and investigate. I don’t think this universe looks good. It may have been detected by the Heavens already…” said Su Ping after pondering for a moment.

Everybody was surprised. Shen Huang asked, “How so?”

Su Ping said, “The Dao technique outside of this universe is damaged. It’s a clear sign of having been attacked. If the Undying State experts inside were alive, they would have fixed it. You wouldn’t have detected this universe if the cover was fully functional. It would have been completely hidden.” Everybody was dazed, while Chi Ying looked wary. “No wonder I was able to sense it. In other words, is this universe as desolate as the one we visited earlier?”

“We won’t know until we see it. In any case, we must sneak in first.”

“Wouldn’t sneaking in be too dangerous? We’ll be hopeless if anything happens to you!” said Shen Huang immediately. He had always seen his disciple as humanity’s last hope.

The cultivation levels they had learned from Su Ping made them feel desperate. Without him, it would have taken countless years for a universe dominator to be born in the human clan, let alone the Undying State and beyond!

“I’m good at stealth movement. Should I sneak in?” asked Xu Kong all of a sudden.

Everybody gave her surprised looks. She volunteered? That exploring task could easily get her killed. All of them were Celestials, but they became much more modest ever since they saw the greater experts.

Su Ping looked at her. He smiled once he noticed that her offer was sincere, not just a polite gesture. “No, I have a better candidate.”

There was a slight change in their expressions. Some Celestials looked normal but they were actually feeling nervous, since they were also experts of stealth.

Su Ping waved a hand, and a figure appeared from the void. She was none other than the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin.

Kayafollet looked at Su Ping and the Celestials present. She said with a shy and angry tone, “What do you want from me?”

She knew that nothing good happened to her when Su Ping took her out.

With everything coming to that point, she no longer expected to regain her freedom.

Maybe death would be her freedom.

“There’s a new universe in front of us. You need to sneak in and investigate,” said Su Ping, “I will teach you stealth techniques. You won’t get caught as long as you’re careful.”

“You’re asking me to do your dangerous scouting again!” said Kayafollet angrily.

“That’s the only reason why you’re still alive. Why else do you think I haven’t killed you?” Su Ping asked back.

She gnashed her teeth. However, getting back her freedom after having fallen into Su Ping’s hands was impossible.

Su Ping glanced at her and said, “It seems that your memories need some adjustments. Better not resist. If you do a good job, you will always be remembered by future generations as the sailor who discovered the new world.”

“Who wants to be remembered?” Kayafollet was furious. She didn’t care about that pointless achievement.

Su Ping wasted no time; he simply imprisoned her. He modified her memories and signed another contract with his Dao Heart. It was different from the one used for pet control. He would only enslave and control her; all without being influenced by the latter.

If necessary, Su Ping could even control her through the contract without worrying about her betrayal or receiving false reports.

Kayafollet became docile all of a sudden. Once he was done with the tampering, she opened her eyes and said to Su Ping respectfully, “I will surely try my best.”

All the Celestials gasped when they saw her change. They too would probably forget who they were if Su Ping ever applied the same method with them.

Shen Huang and Chi Huo weren’t too surprised; they had already seen the young man use the method before. However, a long time had passed and Kayafollet seemed to have found herself again; this was probably because there were loopholes in her modified memories.

“You’re too weak right now. I will help you activate your legacy in full, so that you can enter as a dominator,” said Su Ping.

Kayafollet’s eyes glittered. “Thank you, master.” She spoke with awe and loyalty written all over her face.

“Master?”

Everybody was dazed. They didn’t know how Su Ping had done it, but he had apparently replaced the Saint King in her memories. Noticing her respectful demeanor, none of them thought she would be as obedient, even in front of the real Saint King.

Su Ping rose and said, “I’ll take her to the store and help her pass the tribulation. I’ll let you know when she’s ready.”

Everybody else rose in a hurry and saw Su Ping off.

Once he left the palace, Su Ping took Kayafollet back to the pet store. He went to the test room and examined her memories.

The memories related to the legacy were locked. However, considering Su Ping’s current Dao expertise, cracking such a lock was an easy task; after all, the War Emperor who had granted her the legacy was only a God Emperor.

He quickly saw the guy’s legacy information and relived the guy’s life.

He revealed his talent in a weak tribe and rose unstoppably. There were signs of the Heavens in his universe too.

“Huh?”

Su Ping realized that something was wrong. According to the guy’s memories, the Heavens were banished from the universe!

Wait a second, the guy’s body was in my universe, so the Heavens he saw were the Heavens that entered our universe, except that they appeared a long time ago…

Su Ping quickly changed his expression. The Heavens had been aware of his universe and entered it, but they were expelled!

Back in that war, the War Emperor was just a general. There were many fuzzy figures in his memory; those people were too strong for him to even remember them.

The Heavens were banished…

No wonder his body floated near the crack in the universe after such a long time. It wasn’t a coincidence; it was the lingering will in his corpse!

The Heavens were actually banished from the universe. Their last battle had to do with their expulsion. This determination wasn’t erased despite the passage of time…

Su Ping didn’t expect that the Heavens would have known his universe since a time long past.

There was once a glorious era, with countless powerful beings as strong as Ancestral Gods roaming about. They were able to beat the Heavens!

The experts of our universe must have also hidden our universe, back in that era. However, the concealing barrier was gradually damaged after they sacrificed themselves and banished the invaders, just as the new universe we just found. Then, a crack was formed in our universe, which attracted the Heavens a second time…

Su Ping looked awful. He felt a deep grief and regret.

Had he grown stronger sooner, becoming an Ancestral God 100,000 years prior, he would have been able to wander beyond the universe and review its history, thereby fixing the concealing barrier.

That way their universe would have been left alone; nothing would have happened.
