Chapter 1237 Instantly Killing a Heavenly Lord

“S-Six small worlds?”

You Long was stunned after looking at the small worlds behind Su Ping’s back. There were six of them!

He knew that Su Ping was cultivating multiple small worlds, but never did he expect to see that the former would have six!

Su Ping had only displayed three small worlds to Qing Hongyue, Shuai Qianhou and the others, back in Old Monster Ye’s residence!

Three were already enough to crush Star Lords, including the top ones such as Lin Xiu, even though he was only in the Star State. A lot of Star Lords had cultivated for 100,000 years, but unlike the mediocre ones, Lin Xiu was an unparalleled genius.

He remained a Star Lord for such a length of time just to ensure he would become a top Heavenly Lord when he entered the Ascendant State. It was also a preparation for his rise to the Celestial State!

He was quite ambitious. Unfortunately, he was crushed by Su Ping first, and then possessed later. Quite the unlucky fellow.

“Six small worlds are enough to suppress a Heavenly Lord…” You Long felt a strong pressure from Su Ping. He sensed that even he would be defeated if he were to fight his junior brother right then. Is it Su Ping’s hidden power?

“Die!”

Su Ping activated the Dao Patterns and quickly attacked.

Enhanced by the six small worlds, his Dao Patterns were enough to suppress those of the three Heavenly Lords. The advantages of higher-realm worlds were also nullified.

“We must kill him!”

The Heavenly Lord trio gritted teeth and held back their pain; they became even more ruthless and aggressive. This guy is so terrifying that he might turn things around even if we conquer the universe!

They were determined to kill Su Ping not only because of the bounty. They were simply frightened!

One pet after the other was called over; the trio merged with their pets, while asking those remaining to offer support. They concurrently performed their ultimate techniques.

Time and space changed, and they went to a future moment in the eighth space.

The future was only two hours from the present, back in the normal universe. It was very dangerous to stay in the future, as it depended on the present, and the unpredictable dangers that could arise.

The eighth space in the future was even more dangerous as it was. Even a Heavenly Lord could die at any moment.

A storm was suddenly pouring in the eighth space, although it was more of a gathering of laws than rain. Some of them were burning; some were golden, and some were corruptive.

Each raindrop contained the traits of various laws. Although weak and innocuous on their own, they would become powerful if many were gathered.

That was the ultimate technique of one of the Heavenly Lords, Dream Rain.

That technique required a great number of laws and a high power of understanding.

“Huh?”

Su Ping’s eyes glittered upon seeing the rain. His eyes of chaos allowed him to see through laws and patterns; the enemy’s secret technique was fully revealed. Each individual raindrop was weak, but they were connected by Dao Patterns. Once soaked by that rainwater, the Dao Patterns would invoke laws that would kill!

This secret technique is really creative. Su Ping couldn’t help but compliment. He then made a decision, making the rain in the eighth space intensify. The pouring rain became even more overpowering

The Heavenly Lord performing the technique was stunned for a moment, wondering if he had made a breakthrough.

The next second, he realized that something was wrong, as the rain was mixed with other auras; he examined them and his eyes widened as he looked at Su Ping in shock.

The auras were of the same origin.

Does the guy know my Dream Rain too?

But he didn’t pick up the technique from some relics; he created it!

Is it possible…

The Heavenly Lord felt a chill. Su Ping grasped it after a quick glance?

He admitted that his technique wasn’t too difficult, and any Heavenly Lord would have grasped it in a couple of years if he taught them. However, the young man had picked it up with a mere glance…

The Heavenly Lord felt rather frustrated. He felt chills as he looked at the six small worlds and the thirty-eight flying Dao Patterns. Any of the so-called unparalleled geniuses were mediocre when compared to Su Ping.

The other two Heavenly Lords were surrounding Su Ping. They felt raindrops fall on them, so they asked the first Heavenly Lord in confusion. “What’s wrong with your secret technique?”

“It’s not me. He just learned it from me. Be careful!” said the Heavenly Lord in a hurry.

Both Heavenly Lords were stunned. No wonder those raindrops felt wrong. They quickly vaporized the raindrops with Dao Patterns and used a shield to block the rain.

“Nether Flames!”

Another Heavenly Lord quickly took action, unleashing flames that removed the burning fire affecting his body. That was his own technique; he had only pretended to be in great pain when the Dao Patterns started burning him. He then attacked abruptly and punched with a fist covered with black flames; Dao Patterns made it even more powerful.

Every move was composed by Dao Patterns. The power of the move depended on the enhancement brought by the Dao Patterns.

Some of the top secret techniques had a perfect combination of Dao Patterns. Even three Dao Patterns could be arranged to be as powerful as seven!

That was the case of the Nether Flames, which contained forty-eight Dao Patterns which enhanced them significantly. At least 150 of the normal Dao Patterns were required to resist the strike!

Su Ping instantly realized the structure of Dao Patterns covering the fist. He realized that he could directly see the Dao Pattern structures in every move, ever since his bloodline rose to that of the Primitive Chaos Clan.

It wasn’t difficult for him to copy them.

Only moves with delicate combinations were impossible to be copied in a hurry.

Bang!

Su Ping also attacked. The last move was more complicated than Dream Rain, and it was impossible for him to copy in a rush. However, he had the secret techniques of the Golden Crows. He then launched a golden fist of flames that clashed with the enemy’s fist.

There was a boom-flames, flowing laws and Dao Patterns were spread out, destroying everything.

Part of the golden fist remained, which continued its path of destruction toward the Heavenly Lord.

The latter narrowed his eyes. Su Ping won the fist-to-fist clash?

He swung his hand in fury and shattered the remaining aura. He looked at Su Ping with a mix of anger and fright.

“Junior brother, let me take care of this one.” You Long charged at another Heavenly Lord.

Seeing that his senior made a move, Su Ping instantly focused to finish off the other two enemies.

Exactly at that moment-a strange aura suddenly emerged from the deep dark space.

Many ancient whispers were heard; their effect was highly piercing. However, Su Ping’s soul was powerful enough to ignore them. Those were voices left by experts from ancient times.

Even though they were long gone, their voices still echoed in the deep space.

Normal Star Lords would have felt awed and completely lost by the power in those voices.

The strange aura that Su Ping had detected was unrelated to the whispers. It truly gave him a fright. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was as if their current location were a pond and something dangerous had just dived into

it!

It’s best not to stay too long here!

Su Ping thought that the risk was too high. The deep spaces of the universe were too mysterious; so much so that even the Celestials had yet to explore them all; they were able to enter the ninth space, but they couldn’t stay for too long.

“Senior brother, let’s get this over with as soon as possible!” Su Ping shouted at You Long. You Long was well into a fight. His junior’s request stunned him, and made him wonder how he could possibly defeat a peer Heavenly Lord quickly.

Golden light emerged exactly at that moment

-You Long forced the enemy to retreat, so he could split his attention to look over at the light’s origin, only to be shocked.

A dim world appeared on the top of Su Ping’s small worlds; it was filled with clouds and rumbling noises.

A strange yet familiar aura was spreading out of the small world; it was as if he were confronting a Heavenly Tribulation!

“The seventh…”

Song Yuan was dazed, not expecting that Su Ping would have more than six small worlds.

The two Heavenly Lords fighting against Su Ping were stunned; their expressions immediately changed. Both were about to retreat, but Su Ping had already taken action; his Dao Patterns became even more brutal with the enhancement of the seven small worlds. They were like thirty-eight black dragons that were combined into a pair of thick, black Dao Patterns.

Bang!

The pure Dao Patterns flew out like sword auras, piercing one of the Heavenly Lords’ small worlds!

“No!”

The Heavenly Lord performing the Dream Rain skill quickly gathered the rain into a ball, in an attempt to cage the Dao Patterns.

Meanwhile he took out a few ultimate treasures, including a black tower, and kept on trying to suppress the Dao Patterns.

But the next moment—the rain ball broke and the tower exploded. The rest of the defensive treasures were also penetrated. Just like ferocious dragons, the Dao Patterns tied him up and corrupted him at a fast speed, making him age ten thousand years in an instant. All his power plummeted; it was impossible for him to resist the Dao Patterns.

The man felt like a baby confronting a Star State cultivator who had mastered laws. It was impossible for him to defend.

“Help…” There was desperation and fright in the Heavenly Lord’s eyes, but he didn’t give up. He gave an order to his pets, asking them to stop Su Ping even at the cost of detonating themselves.

His pets roared furiously and charged at the young man, but they were all stunned halfway.

ei

The broken contracts caused a shock to their souls, and the memories of their master were instantly erased. They momentarily felt that their brains went blank.

The Heavenly Lord perished. He was as hunched as an old man, and he quickly decayed until he turned into ashes; nothing was left behind. Only the seriously damaged ultimate treasures and armor fell from his

remains.

The other Heavenly Lord was the same; he tried to make a run for it with his soul alone, but Su Ping simply suppressed him, killing him from a distance.

Both Heavenly Lords died in no more than ten seconds. You Long and the last Heavenly Lord were stunned; the latter soon started trembling and quickly fled, not daring to stay any longer.

How terrifying.

Is he really a Star Lord?

He almost killed those two in an instant. Even Celestials would have taken longer!

“You’re hiding pretty well!”

Su Ping suddenly looked toward a certain point in the distance. There was a raindrop mixed among his own raindrops. The auras were almost identical, but his sensitivity was high enough to notice, so he directly pierced the hidden drop.

A scream was heard the moment it was pierced. It was none other than the first Heavenly Lord.

He had prepared this last resort when he performed his Dream Rain. His pets must have been momentarily affected because he deliberately canceled the contracts to fake his death.

Su Ping had no time to chase the Heavenly Lord that escaped from You Long’s side, and could only let it go.

He simply placed the two Heavenly Lords’ pets and their ultimate treasures into his fourth small world. Then, he quickly said to You Long, “Senior brother, let’s get out of here; I feel that something bad is approaching.”

“Huh?”

You Long was astonished. The instincts of a strong man like Su Ping were usually trustworthy; it was better to heed the warning. “Okay.”

They quickly exited the future time inside the eighth space and returned to the universe outside.

The world outside was still in chaos; many Ascendants had died. All those who were fighting were Heavenly Lords.

“Third senior brother is in trouble. I’ll go help him.”

Like those of a dragon, golden light glittered in You Long’s eyes. He had no time to give his junior more details as he simply entered another time and space. Considering Su Ping’s proven combat ability, he felt reassured even if he left him behind.

After all, it would remain to be seen who would be the one doing the protecting if they encountered an enemy.

I’ll be totally embarrassed if I stay with this junior brother of mine any longer… You Long cried in his heart, while coping with the jumble of mixed feelings. It was very likely that even his master was unaware of Su Ping’s real strength.

He’s only a Star Lord… And he’s already as strong as our eldest brother who has cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years. Although Master did mention that our eldest brother is not very talented, he has cultivated for a really long time.

You Long was overwhelmed by conflicting feelings.

Outside

Su Ping watched You Long leave. He glanced over and saw that his third senior brother was indeed in trouble; however, You Long could probably help him resolve it.

He looked around and saw that Ji Xueqing was being attacked by two Heavenly Lords; she kept moving while waiting for reinforcements instead of fighting them head on.

Good thing that they’re all safe and sound.

Su Ping was relieved to see that his senior brothers and sisters were all safe.

“Huh?”

“That Star Lord is still alive!”

“I just saw three Heavenly Lords chase after them. Is You Long really that strong? He actually protected this kid from three Heavenly Lords?”

The people from the neutral star zones were astounded by seeing Su Ping in the field. It was obvious that none of them had expected to see a Star Lord survive that terrifying battle.

Three Heavenly Lords had perished, and most of the Ascendant cultivators had died. This made Su Ping’s presence even more eye-catching Su Ping frowned when he noticed that the Purple Python was fighting a few pets. “Greeny, enough horsing around. This isn’t the time for fun; just finish them off already.”

Noticing how Su Ping was getting angry, Greeny feared that he would give it “benefits” next time they went to a cultivation site. It then changed into serious mode and coiled its body.
