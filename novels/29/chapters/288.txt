Chapter 291 The Tang Family’s Secret Skill

The venue’s atmosphere reached a climax because of the participation of the Moonfrost Dragon.

As Su Lingyue came off stage, the excitement amongst the people in the audience died down a bit. As more and more participants took their turns, some eye-catching pets were summoned, stirring up interest once more.

“I don’t think I’ve seen your sister’s dragon before.”

Fei Yanbo took his eyes away from Su Lingyue. He tried to find out about the dragon from Su Ping by beating around the bush.

He didn’t want to ask questions that could pry into other people’s privacy but curiosity was eating him alive. He had never seen such a dragon, which in itself was odd.

He was an advanced teacher at the Berserking Blade Academy. He knew all the pets that were listed on the Illustrated Book of Battle Pets, which, of course, included those high-profile, and rare dragons. He could say that he knew pets better than his son and wife.

Since his father had brought up the question, Fei Fei began to eavesdrop keenly.

But Su Ping said nothing in reply. His only response was a smile.

Fei Yanbo felt unhappy that Su Ping would not reveal the answer to him. That being said, it was natural that he would refuse to reply because the dragon was Su Lingyue’s secret and he promised that his store would make her a champion.

Fei Yanbo decided to change the subject. “I think your sister’s dragon is approaching the eighth-rank. Making it to the Top 100 will not be a problem for her. I think congratulations are in order.”

Su Ping answered politely, “I can say the same thing about your students. Two of them are good and Luo, in particular, has great potential.”

“Mr. Su, you’re too kind. Luo is too young. He has the skills but as for his experience, he needs to train for a few more years.” Fei Yanbo knew his students very well.

Fei Fei was unhappy that he didn’t get the answer he wanted. Yet, from the dragon, he could tell that Su Ping was not an average person. He never flung out another rude remark to Su Ping again.

Su Ping and Fei Yanbo exchanged some small talk. Since it was getting late, he decided to leave. He said goodbye to Fei Yanbo and thanked him for having offered him seating space.

Fei Yanbo was surprised, seeing that Su Ping would leave so early. There would be many more matches following. Wouldn’t he want to see how the other participants fared?

After some consideration, he thought he understood Su Ping’s decision. As a titled battle pet warrior, he probably was bored after seeing those kinds of fights.

Su Ping said his goodbyes and then sent a mental message to Su Lingyue, telling her to return home with him. “I’m still watching the games!” Su Lingyue protested at once.

Su Ping rolled his eyes at her. “The first challenge contest will go on for 24 hours straight. Can you finish watching them all? I’d rather see you using this time to practice. You have let out the dragon. From now on, when you go up to the stage, just summon the dragon and let it take care of things for you. If the dragon fails to protect you, then your time at the Elite League would have reached its end.”

Su Lingyue opened her mouth but said nothing as she recalled how she dragged her pets down this day.

Su Ping said nothing else to discourage her. Theoretically speaking, a student like Su Lingyue was not qualified to enter the Elite League. He had forced her to participate and could not complain about her weak skills.

That being said, to become a powerful person, one had to tread the unusual path. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

If she had waited till she graduated, trained three years to gain experience, and then waited for another three years to come and have the first try at the Elite League, she would have won a good place and exhibited an amazing performance; but by then, she would have wasted too much time.

To experience things that were not designed for her current age could help her grow up faster.

This was not a case of “pulling up seedlings to help them grow,” but to induce her to “mature earlier.”

Su Ping needed Su Lingyue to become more mature mentally and to see herself as a powerful warrior. This way, Su Ping wouldn’t have to worry when she left for the top-level academy of the continent. After graduating from that academy, she could establish her name.

As such, she could lead a life without concerns.

This was not a peaceful time, after all, but a time of chaos.

The only thing that separated them from the raging monsters was a wall. Strength was the only true wealth in this day and age!

They left the branch venue and went back home.

Su Ping first went to see his mom.

Wu Guansheng wasn’t waiting there. Su Ping supposed that Wu Guansheng thought she had little time to study when she left for this day’s match so he didn’t show up for the lessons.

So, Su Lingyue’s afternoon had been freed up.

“Come to the store later,” Su Ping said to Su Lingyue and then went back to his store after he said goodbye to his mom.

Su Lingyue didn’t understand his intention. She spent some time chatting with her mom and soon hurried to Su Ping’s store.

“What is it?”

“You have to train, right? Let her teach you.” Su Ping was sitting behind the counter, wiping the glasses. He glanced at Su Lingyue who had just entered and pouted his lips to point at Tang Ruyan.

“She’ll teach me? (I’ll teach her?)”.

The two girls said different things but in one voice. Both were equally baffled.

Then, they glared at each other as they came back to their senses.

“Su Ping, are you serious? Are you telling me that a waitress from your store is going to be my teacher?” Su Pingyue was furious. She was weak and she did slow down her pets that day but he didn’t have to belittle her like this. What an insult!

Tang Ruyan was stamping with fury. “Who are you calling a waitress? Everyone in your family are waitresses!”

Su Ping darted Tang Ruyan a glance. “Do not get me or my family involved when you argue with her. I will beat you!”

Tang Ruyan stared at him with wide-open eyes but failed to think of a comeback. This monster would throw her into the painting and shake her out often. He would never be a gentleman. He would certainly dare to beat a lady up!

“You two are colluding to bully me!” She stomped her feet again. A warrior preferred death to humiliation.

Su Ping didn’t answer. He turned to Su Lingyue who was also feeling affronted. He said, “She’s not outstanding, but she’s more than capable of teaching you. Besides, she’s not a waitress. She’s just a temporary helping hand. As for the day when she can officially become part of the staff, I’d say that far off in the future. She also faces the risk of being fired.”

And yet again, Tang Ruyan flew into a rage.

What did he mean by not outstanding?

She was a blessed girl!

The future family head of the Tang Family!

She was outstanding even among all the major families’ disciples. She became an advanced battle pet warrior when she was less than twenty years old. How many people could have done that?

Besides? Far off in the future? It was not like she was looking forward to that. He made it sound as if a store helper here were as grand as an army general. I would have already left if it weren’t for the fact that I cannot defeat you!

Su Lingyue stood akimbo and said, “I don’t want to learn from just anyone. I would rather train by myself in case she messes up my skills.”

Tang Ruyan was practically foaming at her mouth because of those two. “You don’t want to learn? I don’t want to teach you. It’s not like it’s a dream job or something. You, a middle-rank battle pet warrior at the fourth rank is holding me in contempt. Do you even have a brain?”

If her acquaintances would have been there to see this, their jaws would probably drop. The lady from the Tang Family who was always quiet and elegant was actually capable of using such vulgar language. Who would have thought?

Su Lingyue was surprised since Tang Ruyan was able to tell her rank. She challenged the latter, “Is that so? At which rank are you? Show me.”

“Hmm!”

Tang Ruyan sneered as if saying this was what she had been waiting for.

Then, she wore a look that said, “just you wait and see” and released her astral powers. She displayed her strength as a seventh-rank battle pet warrior right in front of Su Lingyue. Su Lingyue was struck dumb with astonishment.

She didn’t realize the store helper was an advanced battle pet warrior!

She could not believe that the girl was at this rank given her look and age.

She had thought that the girl had been hired because she had used her pretty looks...

“You...”

It took Su Lingyue a long time to come back to her senses. She stared at Tang Ruyan in confusion and surprise. What was Tang Ruyan trying to achieve by being there and work when she was so powerful?

Tang Ruyan noticed that Su Lingyue had been struck by awe. She sneered arrogantly. “Now, girl, do you think I’m qualified to teach you or not? But even if your answer is yes, I still won’t teach you. Your realization has come too late.”

Su Lingyue was still trying to figure this out. Su Ping had not said a word up until then because he wanted the girls to settle their disputes by themselves.

Since they had stopped arguing, Su Ping said to Tang Ruyan, “Teach her some of the combat skills of the Tang Family, or some of your secret skills. If I am happy about your teaching, I may release you earlier.”

Tang Ruyan could not believe that Su Ping would threaten her like this.

“No way!”

She refused resolutely. “The Tang Family’s secret skills cannot be learned by outsiders!”

“Then, which one do you think is more important? Your life or the secret skills?” Su Ping questioned.

Tang Ruyan bit her teeth in hatred. She had never thought for a moment that Su Ping would let her off the hook. But now, he was basically killing the goose that laid the golden eggs!

Tang Ruyan had become impatient. She had been a store hand for days and met so many people. Why hadn’t her information reached the Tang Family? Had she so little fame?
