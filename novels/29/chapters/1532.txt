“They were only illusions constructed by me, but they truly existed in the past.”

The girl stared at Su Ping and said, “The Remains of High Heavens that you visited once was a place and time before the first war. Back then, Sorcerer Ancestor Hun Yu and Sorcerer Ancestor Yuan Long had already forged an alliance along with the first host to fight the Heavenly Dao in the chaos era.

“Naturally, the battle ended with a brutal failure. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I escaped and fell asleep, awakening until a long time passed. I concluded the reason for the failure, and knew it was impossible to defeat the Heavens with the remaining forces, as we had never truly cooperated…”

As she spoke, the girl’s eyes were filled with regret. “That’s the greatest gap between us and the Heavenly Dao. So, I found the second host and created the combat system with contract pets, hoping that all the species would be gathered and trained through the contract.

“The method was truly effective. Thanks to the popularization of the contract pet system, the power of each universe was quickly doubled!

“Although the total amount was the same, the power they could unleash was ten times greater than before!” Her eyes glittered at the thought.

Su Ping gave her a slight nod. He had traveled to many cultivation sites and witnessed all sorts of combat systems, including runes, magic, combat aura, supernatural powers, sorcery, and several others; however, none of them could compare to the contract system.

The contract system was invincible in any stage when compared to the rest!

The more terrifying fact was its minimal toll on the user. The living creatures with the slightest spirituality in their bodies could quickly master the power of contract and take other species as pets. This multiplication of combat power didn’t require years of training.

For instance, the kids from rich families could easily reach the peak of the Star State and bond with Star Lord Pets as long as enough resources were invested in them.

The Star State was already the superior level in other combat systems. It was even seen as the peak of all combat ability in some universes!

After all, Star State warriors could travel in space and their bodies were indestructible. They could master the power of laws. They were Sage Mages in the magic system.

However, it was much easier to reach the Star State with the contract system than with the magic system; even a retard could do that with enough resources.

The total amount was the same, but their power was increased.

Su Ping could understand the one he knew as the system. It was just like the conservation of energy; the total number of experts in the universe was the same. They would be disorganized if they fought individually. But the total amount would drop from 100 to 10 with the contract battle system.

The quality of experts improved and the number of individuals declined. However, the total combat ability was improved to an unreachable level.

For mortals, the universes were boundless and mysterious. In the eyes of the system, the universes were just like military camps.

In order to fight the Heavens, she had to gather all the forces in the military camps, teach them better cultivation techniques, and further consolidate their power!

“Judging from the result, the second war also ended in failure. Why?” asked Su Ping.

The system was still promoting the contract method; either because there wasn’t a better option, or because another reason led to defeat.

The girl smiled bitterly and said, “Technically speaking, it was the third time. In the first war, I woke up and fought the Heavenly Dao. In the second war, I raised the first host to fight the Heavenly Dao. In the third war, your predecessor mastered the contract method and introduced it to all the universes.

“He completed the mission I gave him when he advanced to the Undying State.

“During the war, I asked Sorcerer Ancestor Ling Tai to sign a contract with him as a pet. We gathered the power of all the remaining Sorcerer Ancestors and universes, but we still lost.”

There was vague sorrow in the girl’s eyes as she added, “The capabilities of the Heavenly Dao were beyond our expectation. They are non-living creatures made by the power of other creatures. The casualties in the first two wars and the enormous grief they caused became nourishment for the Heavenly Dao.

“Therefore, although they suffered heavy losses in the second war, they recovered fully by the time the third war was fought.

“We weren’t fully prepared, and we lost again.”

Then, she fell into silence, as if she couldn’t free herself from those memories.

Su Ping frowned a bit. He knew this wasn’t something that could be explained with “not fully prepared.” After all, that girl was the Mother of Chaos, who had gathered the power of all the Sorcerer Ancestors. They must have taken extreme precautions for that war. That is, unless the Heavenly Dao tricked them with some sort of disguise.

Su Ping knew it was impossible to notice details in such a short amount of time.

He didn’t say anything, simply waiting in silence for the system to continue. He believed that she had learned a lot from the previous two defeats. After all, the losses on her side were colossal, as it could be perceived based on the privileges of the two former hosts.
