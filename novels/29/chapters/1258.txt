Chapter 1260 Self-Destruction (1)

“Master, you must live on!” the Little Skeleton’s voice cried out.

His magnificent figure stepped forward; the once tiny creature in the past stood in front of Su Ping like a towering tree.

The soul-stirring Heavenly Tribulation gathered in the sky above like a bloody and brown colored waterfall.

The overwhelming tribulation aura gave pause to the two Celestials, not expecting to see the rare bloody Heavenly Tribulation in that place.

The people in the City of Sins—as well as the Ascendants from the other star zones—were all invested as they observed the battle from a distance, too shocked for words. A bloody tribulation had already occurred earlier on; now it was happening again but dyed with a deeper color. It was almost similar to the legendary dark world-destroying Heavenly Tribulation!

And yet, it was a tribulation invoked by a pet?

Bang!

Mo Ri’s attack brutally launched an attack to strike the Little Skeleton, regardless of the tribulation’s effect.

The bony pet roared and its head was extremely scary. Bloody flames burned in its eye sockets. Those were its pupils, like immortal spiritual flames.

Bang!

The tribulation was shattered and Mo Ri’s attack was blocked by a swing of its bone saber.

In another place—Ye Chen was going to attack his target from the side, but then a dark wall appeared in his way. Many pale and hideous arms sprouted from the wall as they tried to pull him in.

Beyond the wall was the aura of another world; it seemed to be an opening to the netherworld.

Ye Chen slightly changed his expression in shock. Su Ping’s pet was too ferocious… It had such power even while it was barely to break through to the Ascendant State?

“Master, just go!” the Inferno Dragon called out in Su Ping’s head.

Su Ping was stunned; he looked at the Little Skeleton currently blocking all attacks going his way. For the first time, he felt that the kid he had been protecting had grown up. His eyes were teary, reflecting the comfort, relief, and sadness he felt.

He gave a slight head shake and said to the Inferno Dragon, “I’m done running. You will avenge me. Your contracts will be automatically canceled when I die, and you’ll be released to random places in the universe. You must live well…”

His energy became disorderly throughout his body as he spoke. The fused Inferno Dragon and the young Chaos Beast were separated from him against their wishes.

“Master, don’t!”

The Inferno Dragon’s eyes widened. That ferocious creature was wreathed in fear at the moment.

The young Chaos Beast’s eyes were too wide open. It quickly hugged Su Ping and shouted, “I’m not going! I’m not going! Even if I must die, I will die with you!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Su Ping was like a parent.

Su Ping smiled as he felt their affection, and then summoned the pet space. He commanded them with the power of their contracts.

“No!!”

The Inferno Dragon roared; the contract flames were burning him, causing an excruciating pain. His soul was burning and withering too.

The young Chaos Beast was also reluctant. It was ablaze with contract flames, but it was still unwilling to let Su Ping go.

“You must be obedient!”

Su Ping couldn’t help but fly into a rage, while tears flowed.

“I’m not listening!” roared the Inferno Dragon.

The young Chaos Beast followed. “Me neither!”

Su Ping tried to push the young Chaos Beast away, only to find that it was too strong. He was too weak at the moment because he had transferred all the damage unto himself earlier, and couldn’t push his pet away.

The Inferno Dragon lowered its proud head and implored humbly, “I will rise to the Ascendant State too. Master, we will surely buy enough time for you. You must live on! I’m begging you!”

Su Ping gritted his teeth and said furiously, “Stop making a scene!”

The Inferno Dragon didn’t reply. It turned around and rushed to the Little Skeleton’s side, his stance indicating that it would fight until the end.

The contract flames were burning its blood and soul fiercely. The dragon was shaking, but it stood firm. Su Ping could only see its stubborn back.

“You…”

Su Ping didn’t think he would be unable to make him obey at such a crucial moment. He was overwhelmed with the pain he felt. “It’s not worth it! This is not worth it! Why are you so unruly?”

as

The young Chaos Beast did the same, moving to join the skeleton.. Its chubby body was trembling in pain, but it said proudly, “There’s no way that you can leave me behind. I will not let anything happen to you, even at the cost of my own life!”

“Your pets are rather stupid…”

Ye Chen was in a daze while seeing how those two pets were protecting Su Ping, despite the contract penalty. He soon recovered, now with unusual grimness and fury.

Once he had his own loyal partners too.

However, those partners defected when he was in danger.

Su Ping’s pets were willing to fight alongside him until the last moment, despite the punishment for violating their contracts.

Why are they so different?

He wouldn’t have corrupted and later fallen to become a devil!

Ye Chen roared and swept his arm, which had turned into a battle ax. It smashed into the dark wall, cutting the protruding arms. Half of the ax was embedded into the wall.
