Chapter 192 Dragon Eggs

Since he already knew the way, Su Ping quickly found the inspection checkpoint, then waited for a bit in line, and entered the room he had just left not long before.

“It’s-Mister Su??” Qin Shuhai opened his jaw in shock but quickly recovered. “Did you just go on another exploration?”

“Yeah.” Su Ping nodded.

Qin Shuhai shook his head and decided not to ask questions. It was understandable that someone who had earned a big fortune in the Mysterious Realm would want to keep going.

Su Ping took out his backpack and unloaded its content-two energy crystals extracted from seventh-rank monsters.

Qin Shuhai looked at the items with twitching eyebrows. He was expecting better.

“Well... It seems you didn’t have much luck this time, Mister Su.”

“Afraid so.” Su Ping feigned a disappointed look.

“Don’t worry though. You can always try again and perhaps find more extraordinary treasures, as you did last time.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Thanks. That’s what I’m aiming for.”

Several titled warriors in the room gave Su Ping their friendly attention as they had already decided to treat him on fair terms.

However, there were exceptions, such as Lady Feng, who had always doubted Su Ping’s reliability.

“Hmph. That was some serious luck for him to find an Astral Spirit Fruit. Was he aiming to be the lucky dog again? Don’t make me laugh.”

Although the others didn’t quite buy her words. They voiced their support to Su Ping.

“Well, I’d do the same and try my luck in different sectors if I could.”

“Yeah. Luck isn’t something you can predict. Who knows what will happen? You just gotta keep on.”

When the inspection was done, Su Ping headed to the waiting area again, while rejecting several more recruiters coming his way.

He was quite familiar with the “workflow” at this moment. He skillfully made the payment, selected a target sector and teleported there, all the while without needing any guidance.

The flow of time ticked away relentlessly and two more days passed as Su Ping kept enjoying his job. By then, the workers in the inspection room were no longer surprised by his frequent visits in the least.

Qin Shuhai had lost count of the number of times he had seen Su Ping, since Su Ping had always returned after a few hours or even faster after each inspection. They would have seen him as another employee if they didn’t know better.

Qin Shuhai looked at Su Ping’s backpack, which looked rather filled this time. Similarly, all the others paid attention and wondered what kind of items Su Ping had brought back, after being disappointed so many times during those days.

“Please.” Qin Shuhai signaled Su Ping with a smile. They all knew what to do.

Su Ping nodded and unbuttoned the pack.

Thud, thud.

Several boring energy crystals and spotted eggs rolled onto the table.

The inspectors exchanged several confused looks as they wondered whether Su Ping had rummaged through a monster nest. None of them was a professional trainer. They couldn’t tell what kind of Astral Pets would come out of the eggs.

“Um, Mister Su? What are...” Qin Shuhai wanted to figure out what those were before they were sent for inspection.

Su Ping answered without a problem. “Four-Winged Storm Dragons. Ninth rank.” “Dragon eggs?” Qin Shuhai stared at him in surprise. “Three of them??”.

Four-Winged Storm Dragons were only considered to be lesser entities among their dragon-type friends, but they were still genuine dragons, not drakes or some halfbreed. They hardly lost when it came to fighting against something of the same rank. Moreover, those Storm Dragons were adept at speed, something that endowed them with a high survivability rate because they could simply escape if there was something they couldn’t handle.

“Mi-Mister Su, are you perhaps... selling them?” asked Qin Shuhai.

Su Ping looked around the room and saw how everyone was eager to buy the eggs.

“As titled battle pet warriors, you don’t really need these lower ninth-rank pets, right?”

Qin Shuhai chuckled. “That might be correct, but you should know that dragon-type pets are always rare, so nobody would pass up the chance to keep them as secondary pets. Besides, we can always use them as gifts for our younger family members. These things make great pets for pet warriors who have yet to reach our level.”

“I see,” Su Ping pondered, “May I know your offer?”

“Do you want money or other treasures in return?”

“Can I take a look at what kind of treasures I can take?”

With a bit of frustration, Qin Shuhai mentioned the names of several items of equal value.

Su Ping shook his head. “How much for selling them then?”

Qin Shuhai was surprised by Su Ping’s reaction, for he just thought that he had offered pretty good items just then. The armor he offered to Su Ping could block off the attacks of ninth-rank monsters, and yet Su Ping didn’t even give it much thought. “Let me see... For standard market prices, the egg of a ninth-rank dragon-type monster should go for 100 million.”

A muscular worker nearby chipped in by saying, “I give you 120, Mister Su. Can I have one of them?”

Su looked that way. “Can you pay right away?”

“Of course!” The man smiled widely when Su Ping agreed.

The others didn’t expect Su Ping to sell the eggs that easily, for they thought Su Ping would have better uses for them. For example, one could use those eggs to train three high-level battle pet warriors in no time, or give them to titled battle pet warriors as a gift.

If someone could control all three dragons and teach them to move as a team, their combined strength would grow beyond their limit.

Qin Shuhai quickly offered. “I’ll buy another one. 120 million. Immediate payment, just like before.”

“I’ll take the second one, Mister Su! 130 million for it!” another man called.

“150!” Qin Shuhai raised his price with an annoyed look. That successfully discouraged more competitors, for 150 million was well beyond the average price for the eggs. They might be valuable, but people still needed a lot of time and resources to raise the dragonets, which would probably cost them three to four times the original expense.

Since no one else was speaking, Su Ping gave the second egg to Qin Shuhai.

That was an income of 270 million deposited to his account.

Damn. If only I could convert the money into energy points...

He had more eggs stashed in his inventory space. Not Four-Winged Storm Dragons, but Thunderstorm Dragons. Though he wasn’t going to take them out for inspection.
