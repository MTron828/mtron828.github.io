Chapter 1233: The Atrium

“Junior brother, you yourself are going to publicize how to cultivate multiple small worlds. Teaching you the Three Hearts Technique is nothing compared to that. Besides, it’s not my ultimate skill,” Song Yuan explained.

The others weren’t a threat to him even if they mastered the Three Hearts Technique, which wasn’t truly a secret; it was just that only his disciples and his master knew the details of such technique.

His best disciple had already grasped double merging, and could compete with Heavenly Lords.

As for his master…

His master had already grasped the technique in full; it wasn’t of significant help to his master, but it was still a reasonably good technique.

“You flatter me,” said Su Ping quickly.

Song Yuan smiled and transmitted the technique to his junior via telepathy.

Su Ping was rather stunned by how straightforward his senior brother was. He secretly made a mental note about this favor.

None of the others commented on this. They had all seen their junior’s terrifying potential. It was understandable that their senior brother would want to improve their friendship by offering the technique.

Getting to the bottom of it, it was a world where strength was what mattered.

Only if a person had extraordinary potential and strength would others respect and invest in them.

Why would they think highly of a piece of garbage?

“Let’s keep going.”

Song Yuan led the way just like before, closely followed by the green-haired girl.

Su Ping was positioned in the middle of the team, which was the safest position; no one disagreed.

Su Ping split part of his attention to read the Three Hearts Technique while they traveled. He found that it wasn’t difficult to cultivate; he would only have to divide his body and soul into three parts.

The flaw was rather obvious. Splitting would imply weakening.

However, it was possible to combine the three parts again under special circumstances!

Still, the cultivation would be wasted and they would have to start all over if they were recombined.

The other two contracts would be wasted. The contracted pets would go out of control and flee immediately.

After all, once the contracts lose effect, the pets’ memories of their master would be erased.

They would bolt away even if they were close to their master in the past.

In fact, it wouldn’t be taken as a “defection,” because it was a normal reaction for wild beasts to avoid danger.

Only idiots would stay and wait.

It may be complicated for ordinary people. But I have the constitutions of soul entities and of gods; it’s truly easy for me to split up…?Having experienced the difficulties of establishing multiple small worlds, Su Ping felt that the Three Hearts Technique was a piece of cake; he could easily grasp it after figuring out its main mechanism.

Su Ping kept on cultivating while traveling.

The flesh inside his body was split. Su Ping’s control over his body was beyond anyone’s imagination after his bloodline advanced into that of the Primitive Chaos Clan. Furthermore, the constitutions of gods, soul entities and ancient deities were also found in his bloodline. He had refined those bloodlines to turn into a member of the Primitive Chaos Clan. Splitting up his body at the moment was even simpler than splitting his bloodline.

It only took one short moment for Su Ping to condense a second heart. His soul was divided into two parts too.

Even though my soul has split up, the total number of contracts is the same. The split souls aren’t independent; they’re still interconnected and can only fool the contracts in a way. Was the creator of the technique intending to divide his soul into three parts, so that he could contract thirty pets if he had once been able to contract ten?

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to conceal soul aura. So, it’s very unlikely; however, it’s possible to have the body merge with multiple pets in such a way…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

He didn’t have new pets. His new second heart and soul were still unoccupied.

He didn’t try splitting further.

He would have to cancel pet contracts first in order to relocate the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound to the second heart and soul—

If he did, Su Ping would feel even more uncomfortable than girls during that time of the month. He couldn’t prevent the weakening after canceling a contract, even though he had mastered the path of time.

The higher his level, the more binding the contracts would be, and the harsher the contract backlash would be.

The contracts are truly strange. Once canceled, their influence can’t be removed quickly, even in accelerated time and space. I have to wait in the normal universe until it’s no longer effective. On the other hand, I can totally accelerate time, turning one minute into a day; the influence would be gone in only a couple of minutes,?Su Ping thought.

The Golden Crows didn’t seem to have such contracts.

There were contracts in the Archean Divinity, but they were different from the contracts he had signed. They were more like slave contracts.

Those under contract would have to obey unconditionally, and couldn’t attack their masters. They were obligated to die if they were asked to.

The contracts Su Ping used were almost set on equal terms.

Pets could resist their masters in a way. Even though they would be burnt miserably by the laws set on the contracts, it was better than being forced to die.

If pets were stronger than their masters, they could even break free. That was why major families preferred not to hand overly strong pets to their core descendants.

Pets beyond one’s level would be the greatest danger.

“Junior brother…”

Song Yuan was leading the way; he suddenly turned around and looked dazed once he saw that Su Ping was meditating.

“Huh?” Su Ping looked at him in confusion, keeping the misty eyes of the chaos clan. Nobody had asked him about that yet; after all, everybody was allowed to have their own secrets.

“I just sensed that your aura changed a bit. Are you cultivating?” Song Yuan couldn’t help but ask. He suspected that it was an illusion, but he was all too familiar with the feeling.

Su Ping nodded and said, “Yes. I just tried the technique; I’ve only just cultivated to the second level. I’ll continue after we return. Let’s focus on our business for now.”

Song Yuan: “…”

It was real? I didn’t imagine it?

The guy already cultivated to the second level after I just passed the technique?

His lips twitched. He remembered his own disciples, who were geniuses from various star zones; they were all miserable when they cultivated the technique. After all, splitting the soul was really painful. As for Su Ping… He didn’t even bother to scream.

It was done just like that?

Everybody looked at Su Ping as if he were a monster. Even though they didn’t have technique, they knew something about it; its second level would already allow a double merging.?Su Ping already grasped that while on the move?

They didn’t think that Su Ping was bragging, since he had cultivated for no more than a hundred years, and he was already capable of fighting against Heavenly Lords while being a Star Lord. There was no need for him to brag.

“I finally understand why our junior brother is so tough,” said Han Ye with a bitter smile.

You Long smacked his lips, not knowing what to say. Delighted? Su Ping was almost exceeding him; how could he feel delighted? There were truly more and more monsters in their world.

Song Yuan silently kept leading the way.

The green-haired girl next to him couldn’t help but glance at Su Ping with fear in her eyes. Their eyes met for a moment and she was terror-struck; her keen senses told her that the young man was terrifying. He was like a well-hidden monster in the crowd!

But he was only a Star Lord…

Whoosh!

Everybody kept moving, using the channel caused by the previous attack. They zigzagged and traveled for almost eighty thousand kilometers and would occasionally see remains of human beings and insects, as well as confused pets nearby.

Those pets were clearly unowned. They carried abundant human auras and wore secret treasures forged by human beings. They were at a loss about what to do.

Chunyu simply slapped them into unconsciousness, and took them into his world.

The others fight over them, as they were just normal Ascendant pets.

“Watch out,” the green-haired girl suddenly whispered.

Song Yuan narrowed his eyes and slowed down, but he didn’t stop.

He gradually detected the situation up ahead as he got closer. There were human auras and an intense blood stench.

They slowly approached the area, and a loud monkey-like shriek was heard.

“Squeak!”

Everybody became slightly grim. They had obviously been detected.

“Who’s there? Ha. Just come on out; stop sneaking around.” Someone chuckled. “Whoever has made it up to here must be a group of at least Heavenly Lords. Let me see which star zone you’re from.”

Song Yuan didn’t bother pretending, which would be pointless. He walked out of the shadow projected by his pet, and went to the place where the sound came from.

He found himself in a spacious place after crossing the channel. The environment was rather dim and brown colored; it looked like some sort of large organ.

“The ancient corpse has a human shape. Even though we’ve been zigzagging, we’ve moved for quite a long distance; we’re probably close to the chest region,” said Song Yuan telepathically to his teammates.

Meanwhile, they observed the people who were already there. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

There was not just one person, but a whole group wearing clothes in different styles. They were obviously from different star zones.

Su Ping saw a few familiar faces among them, including Liu Xia from the Red Fire Star Zone, who had offered him inspiration on the path of ultimate darkness. There was also Xu Kong’s first disciple, who was on par with Song Yuan.

Besides them, there were a couple of intimidating people, who were surrounded by their own groups.

“The Void Star Zone, the Blood Charm Star Zone, the Flying Cloud Star Zone, the Sword Skull Star Zone…”

Ji Xueqing and the others were observing the people gathered with solemn expressions. They didn’t expect to see that many top Heavenly Lords of the other star zones. It seemed that they had arrived rather late to the party.

From those among them, the Blood Charm Star Zone and the Purple Shadow Star Zone belonged to the Heavenly Devil Alliance. The people of the Doom Star Zone had been killed, and it remained unknown whether or not they had been all the forces sent by the Doom Star Zone.

There were also representatives of the Dragon Sun Star Zone, which had been neutral in the beginning but were closer to the Heavenly Devil Alliance in recent times.

“The people of the Golden Star Zone…”

There was a sexy and beautiful woman from the Blood Charm Star Zone. Her face was stunningly attractive, and her body figure would make any man fall for her. She slightly raised her eyebrows and asked, “Why are you dragging a Star Lord along? Oh. Isn’t he the one who’s wanted?”

There were about fifty people present from a dozen star zones; even the weakest of them was an Ascendant.

Everybody looked at Su Ping with strange expressions after hearing what she said; they had all heard a thing or two about the legendary youngster who had emerged in recent years.

The latter was currently being protected by Song Yuan and the others.

Even those who had been training in seclusion for 10,000 years had learned Su Ping’s name when they got out.

After all, the universe was in turmoil and the Heavenly Devil Alliance was rising; a universal war was about to break out.

The main reason for the war was the agenda pushed by the Celestial expert of the Heavenly Devil Alliance. Whenever he was mentioned, Su Ping—the legendary Star Lord—was also mentioned.

“It’s Su Ping, right? He’s a Star Lord, but I heard that he’s as strong as a Heavenly Lord, and he’s the one with the unprecedented multiple small worlds. How bold of him to show up in this place; it’s a miracle that he’s still alive,” said a young man with a chuckle. He had golden patterns on his forehead, and was also from the Blood Charm Star Zone.

There was brutality in his handsome eyes.

They had no personal grudges against Su Ping. However, the latter was considered one of the Heavenly Devil Alliance’s main enemies because of his potential.

If he rose to the Ascendant State… Nobody would be able to kill him, unless Celestials took action!

His multiple small worlds were a first in the universe. There was no telling how strong he would become once he broke through!

The young man with the golden pattern thought that the kid was too reckless, and that it was a rare opportunity to deal with him, since Su Ping was still a Star Lord.

“Such a provocation is too demeaning for a Heavenly Lord,” said Ji Xueqing coldly, “Do you want to try us?”

“The Queen of Destruction is indeed short-tempered. Haha. She’s right; it’s better to fight than to argue. Sun King, I would’ve snapped if I were you,” said a Heavenly Lord from the Grand Star Zone, enjoying the drama.

They would surely benefit from Su Ping and his team fighting against the people from the Blood Charm Star Zone.

The young man titled as the Sun King glanced at him and snorted. He didn’t say anything else; it was unnecessary to make more enemies at the moment.

Song Yuan asked calmly, “Have you been waiting here because of that?”

There was a dark hole inside the enormous organ, and terrifying auras were spreading out from within, as if a beast were lurking inside.

The black hole was swallowing all rays of light; they couldn’t see what was inside, even while using Dao Patterns.

Liu Xia said to Song Yuan telepathically, “That’s right. Based on our computer scanning and telemetry, we’re very likely near the ancient corpse’s chest. The legacy may be inside the hole. However…”

They were allies; such tidbits of information could be shared.

“What about the previous attack?” Song Yuan asked telepathically.

“It came from inside the hole. That’s why nobody dares to go inside for now,” said Liu Xia.

Song Yuan narrowed his eyes. That attack was almost too powerful for him, even though it came from a long distance. He wasn’t confident of surviving it if he were to be hit up close.

Besides, nobody knew what had launched the previous strike. Was it just a casual attack, or one using their full strength?

Song Yuan felt that the situation was a bit tricky as he looked at the dark hole.

“You didn’t try exploring with pets or robots?” asked Song Yuan.

“We did. But you can’t sense where they are once they enter. Even the most advanced Abyss Pioneers were wasted soon after they were sent in. Look at the ground on your left side,” said Liu Xia telepathically.
