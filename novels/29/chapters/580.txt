Chapter 582 Breaking In

“Let’s go and have a look.”

As more and more students left for the Graveyard Forest, Qin Shaotian was also tempted.

Liu Qingfeng and Ye Longtian were still hesitating but Qin Shaotian had already stepped away. Having no other choice, they went after him.

Many students went toward the Graveyard Forest to follow after Su Ping and their Principal.

With Fei Tianli and some other popular students taking the lead, others that weren’t afraid of breaking rules on account of their influential family backgrounds decided to follow suit.

The teachers who were keeping order wanted to stop the students. But they felt their hands were tied when it came to people like Fei Tianyi. Having no better options, the teachers chose to stop some of the more average students that just happened to bump right into them.

The teachers knew they couldn’t stop the students with influential backgrounds. They could not afford to do that.

That was especially true for Fei Tianyi. He was more esteemed than some of the teachers; he would not be punished in any way as long as his mistake was not grave.

“Here we are.”

After ten minutes or so passed, Su Ping, Yun Wanli, and Han Yuxiang arrived at a dense forest where purple bamboos grew. The dark glow coming off from the bamboo gave a gloomy look to the forest.

“This is the Graveyard Forest.”

Han Yuxiang was trying to catch his breath. “The graveyard lies behind the purple bamboos which were found in an unknown world across a spatial crack. The purple bamboos can absorb the filthy and foul energy and oppress it. The purple bamboos are the reason we can isolate the Graveyard Forest. Otherwise, the foul energy found there would contaminate the entire Longyang Base City.”

“Indeed.”

Yun Wanli nodded with a serious look on his face.

Right then, a man came flying across the purple bamboo to greet them.

It was a strong and tall middle-aged man who was surprised to see Yun Wanli. In a hurry, the man dropped to one knee while hovering in the air. “Sir. How can I help you?”

“Please stand up.” Yun Wanli helped the man up and said, “I’m here for Mr. Nan. Is he inside now?”

“Nan?” The middle-aged man realized that the presence of the Vice Principal and the Principal together meant the matter had to be of importance. The man answered without delay. “Sir, do you mean Nan Fengtian, from the Nan Family of the Setting Sun Base City? He’s here. He came here yesterday and has been cultivating inside.”

Yun Wanli was happy to hear that. “Good. Tell him to come out at once.”

The middle-aged man nodded. A piece of dark rock appeared in his palm. He poured astral powers into the rock that had the number 19 appearing on it. The astral powers pouring in, made the rock produce a blinding radiance.

“The 19th level?”

Han Yuxiang was evidently surprised by the number.

The middle-aged man finished pouring in astral powers and lowered his hands down. “Indeed. Nan Fengtian is a talented offspring of Senior Setting Sun. He must be the student with the strongest willpower in our academy. Vice Principal, not even your student can compete against Nan Fengtian in the strength of spirit.”

Of course, the student the man referred to was Fei Tianyi.

Han Yuxiang had had many students in his life. But at the moment, merely one of them was still studying and was able to compete against Nan Fengtian.

There were four important students in the academy, Fei, Nan, Guo, and Ji.

The four were the best students of the year.

Fei Tianyi, sometimes referred to as “God Fei” by the admiring students, ranked No.1 among the four on account of his combat strength. Nan Fengtian came second and his willpower was stronger than anyone else’s. He was respected and worshiped by many students as well.

They heard some people approach while Su Ping and the others were chatting.

The first to arrive was Fei Tianyi. A hundred meters behind him was a girl that was just as agile as he was.

Fei Tianyi arrived and stood behind Su Ping and his teachers.

That girl stopped by Fei Tianyi.

“Hmm!”

The girl darted a glare at Fei Tianyi, vexed by the outcome.

She had made a move first but he caught up with her; she wanted to grind her teeth. That little run and chase was a small game between them and she had lost again.

“Huh?”

The middle-aged man was facing Su Ping so he was able to see Fei Tianyi and the girl arrive. He smiled at them. “Mr. Fei and Miss Guo are here. What a surprise.”

Han Yuxiang turned over and saw the boy and girl standing together. He was speechless. Why would they follow them instead of staying put at the plaza? Of course, it was too late for him to scold them at the moment.

That was one of the negative traits of those talented students. They sometimes held no regard for rules.

Soon, they heard more and more people approaching. The students were employing different methods to make their way over. Upon arriving, they all stood behind Fei Tianyi and the girl. Han Yuxiang had noticed they were all the outstanding students in the academy. What a headache. Han Yuxiang chose to ignore this.

So be it. If they wanted to watch, feel free.

Curious, the girl looked at Su Ping from behind and asked Fei Tianyi, “Hey, who’s that guy?” Fei Tianyi frowned and answered with coldness, “What does that have to do with

you?”

“Come on. I’m just asking a question. Can’t you answer like a normal person?” the girl complained.

Fei Tianyi was not in the mood to amuse her. He stared at Su Ping’s back, remembering what had happened between them by the Dragon Tower. Fei Tianyi clenched his fingers.

“I heard that this guy is Su Lingyue’s big brother... Really? He doesn’t look that much older. I cannot believe he’s at the titled rank. I thought Su Lingyue didn’t have any connections. How come the siblings are equally talented?” The girl placed one hand on her hip and the other under her chin. She tapped her cheek with her fingers.

Fei Tianyi was interrupted from his thoughts. Gravely, he said, “He’s not even 24 yet.”

“Huh?” The fact that Fei Tianyi would say anything was a surprise to the girl, not to mention that the reply was kind of strange. “What?”

Fei Tianyi no longer replied.

“Why isn’t he here yet?”

Su Ping stared at the bamboos with a sullen face. “How long do I have to wait?”

The middle-aged man noticed that unfamiliar person. “Who is this?”

“This is Fate Challenger Su,” Yun Wanli introduced.

“Fate Challenger?” The middle-aged man stared with wide-open eyes. “That’ titled battle pet warrior?”

Yun Wanli nodded.

The middle-aged man could not believe it. Fate Challengers were people superior to the titled rank who were able to compare to the legendary battle pet warriors. This young man was a Fate Challenger?

Han Yuxiang also thought that it had taken Nan Fengtian long enough to get out. He had not sensed anyone coming so he urged the middle-aged man, “It is taking too long. Tell him again.” The middle-aged man answered at once, “I will do that.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Su Ping frowned. “Can’t we just go in?”

Han Yuxiang shook his head. “The Graveyard Forest is a special place. Once a person goes inside, the seal will be activated and it can only be opened from the inside, or when the formation that makes the seal is cracked. But the formation is complicated and cracking it will take time. Let’s just wait for a couple of more minutes.”

Yun Wanli added, “Yes, let’s do that. Nan Fengtian is cultivating on the 19th level. It is very dangerous up there and even titled battle pet warriors at the peak can be contaminated by the foul energy. I suppose we should wait for him to come out on his own.”

Su Ping just said to the middle-aged man, “Do communicate with him again.”

“Yes.” The middle-aged man nodded and poured astral powers into the rock.

The black rock gave off a glow that gradually receded.

Fifteen minutes passed and nothing.

Han Yuxiang was getting scared. “Nan Fengtian is not in trouble, is he?”

Yun Wanli frowned. “I think that is possible. He, after all, is merely at the eighth rank. It is too much for him to stay at the 19th level.”

Su Ping didn’t like that at all. He stepped forward and directly flew into the Graveyard Forest.
