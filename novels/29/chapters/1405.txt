Chapter 1407: Killing a God King With the Snap of a Finger (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“He’s a Dao Child of the Heavenly Path Institute, a holy cultivation land where the secret techniques of all clans are collected. And still, you’ve raised such a bloodthirsty Dao Child!” Emperor Que spoke with repressed fury, coldly looking at Elder Yan and the others who stood in front of Su Ping. “Everybody knows that the Dao Children of the Heavenly Path State are the best on their level!

“However, don’t forget that raising such a high performing Dao Child would have been impossible without the gifts of all clans and all the clan’s secret techniques.”

“Emperor Que, that’s a different matter altogether. I know what you’re thinking, please don’t aim to slander.” Elder Yan frowned, realizing Emperor Que’s awkward situation. After all, all his clan was watching at the moment; suffering such a crushing defeat was humiliating and he had to look for an excuse.

However, that was a terrible excuse!

Such claims would only be seen as valid by his clansmen.

“Su Ping wasn’t really trained in our institute before he became a Dao Child; he cultivated hard on his own, and his title was attained only recently. Even if all the secret techniques are being collected in our institute, he wouldn’t even have the time to study them,” said Elder Yan coldly, “His current strength can only be ascribed to his own cultivation!

“It’s only natural that your God King would be no match for the Dao Child, who has excelled in the Heaven Path Institute and rose to the top of the Chaos Talents Rank!

“How many people of the Rain Clan have made it to the Chaos Talents Rank?”

Emperor Que burst into fury. “What do you mean?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Elder Yan said coldly, “Nothing. Just making things clear. You may accuse the Dao Child for offending your clan today, and we can offer an apology; however, you must not resort to slander!”

“You!”

Emperor Que was so infuriated his throat was trembling. Elder Yan’s actions were truly unwise, thinking he didn’t know about Su Ping’s background… He was only saying that to keep appearances. Such taunts were nothing for Su Ping and the others, and yet, she had to go and deprive him of the chance.

“So, in other words, you’re not planning to let this go!” Emperor Que gritted his teeth and said, “Your Dao Child offended our clan and killed a God King. He’s a God King too. So, let him pay for what he did with his life!”

Elder Yan frowned. “Indeed, both are God Kings, but…”

“Ahem!”

Two of the visiting elders quickly coughed and interrupted Elder Yan, knowing her wilful attitude and how she had little respect for anyone in the institute; not even the president was spared.

“Well, Emperor Que, we certainly want to settle this peacefully; I hope you can propose a solution,” said an elder with a humble smile, “Of course, we hope that you can set feelings aside. Tell us a solution that we can accept; killing the Dao Child is not an option. Asking the Dao Child to guard your gate… is too insulting for the Heaven Path Institute.”

Emperor Que was so furious his lips were twitching. Although Elder Yan was interrupted, he knew what she was about to say.

They were both God Kings, but they were different!

Is Su Ping’s life more precious than the Rain Clan’s God King’s?

Deep down, he knew this was a valid point, but he was still angry.

“Guys, stop talking. Your Dao Child is not the least bit regretful; I don’t think he’ll be convinced unless I take action to suppress him.” Emperor Que mustered his power, already determined to kill him.

Elder Yan and the others slightly changed their expressions. “Emperor Que, don’t be rash. We can still negotiate…”

“I’m just going to teach him a lesson, not kill him. You’re not even letting me punish him?” Emperor Que was seething.

Elder Yan and the others could certainly see his killing intent. If he started a fight, he would surely try to kill Su Ping.

“Emperor Que, please think carefully before you make a move! The Dao Child has won the appreciation of our Ancestral Gods; consequences will be serious if anything happens to him. It’s been years since the last Ancestral Gods’ war. If it breaks out, a lot of people will die, not just involving the Rain Clan and the Heaven Path Institute…” said an elder vehemently.

Emperor Que was slightly taken aback by this, not expecting that they would ask the Ancestral Gods to protect that human.

He could tell that they weren’t bluffing. If they killed Su Ping and the Ancestral Gods stepped up, there was the chance of powerhouses from other places joining the fight…

The Emperor’s face turned sour as he thought of the implications.

“It doesn’t matter!” said a cold and solemn voice.

A figure appeared outside the barrier, looking down at all the people present. “You broke into the Rain Clan’s territory and killed our God King. Today, even if the Ancestral Gods of the Heaven Path Institute take action, we will not let this go!”

Everyone showed different expressions upon seeing the newcomer. It was none other than the Rain Emperor, master of the Rain Clan!

Elder Yan and the others also reacted as they saw him arrive. One of the elders said anxiously, “Rain Emperor, it was wrong of our Dao Child to do what he did, and we’re willing to apologize. However, it’s not necessary to start an Ancestral God war!”

“We must kill him today!” The Rain Clan’s face was cold. “The ruined dignity of the Rain Clan will be reinstated with his blood! If he’s willing to apologize in public and you show sincerity by destroying one of your levels, we can then talk about compensation!”

“Are you serious?”

Elder Yan’s face was cold, knowing it was impossible for that man to take back what he said, or he would lose all his dignity as the leader of the clan.

However, the terms were so harsh it was basically a war declaration.

“Elders, no need to worry about me.” Su Ping was quick to step in. “It’s my own decision to come here; it has nothing to do with you. I’m only here to seek justice for myself. Rest assured, elders; I’m not an Ancestral God yet, but I will not fall. They can’t kill me!”

Elder Yan and the others were stunned. They showed bitter faces as they looked at the young man’s solemn and confident face.

None of them understood where his confidence came from, but they knew that reconciliation was impossible since he had worded it that way.

Su Ping wasn’t even willing to lower his head and apologize, let alone anything else.

“Are you serious?” Elder Yan gazed at Su Ping and said, “I can understand that you’re young and proud, but have you thought it through? This is the Rain Clan, a place that has produced eighteen God Emperors. Considering those who died and are presumably dead, seven have been seen in the past 100,000 years!

“Can you defeat them?”

Su Ping knew she was warning him. Flashing a warm smile, he said, “Just seven? I hope that I can enjoy myself!”

Elder Yan and the others were speechless. Arrogant? Such a thought was no longer entertained; instead, they saw pride and confidence to dominate a complete era.

If Su Ping survives this, the next era will probably belong to him, right?

The thought popped up in everybody’s heads. They fell silent for a moment.

The Rain Emperor was expressionless after Su Ping spoke, but there was thoughtful light deep in his eyes.

Emperor Que and another emperor were cold and determined to kill. If any other clan were to judge Su Ping’s actions, they wouldn’t think that their actions were justified. Not even the Heaven Path Institute could protect him, or they would be seen as enemies by the rest of the world!

“Bring it on!”

Su Ping turned around; the smile on his face was gone. He looked at the three emperors aggressively. “Who will come first? You, my old friend?”

Emperor Que looked into Su Ping’s eyes and sneered. “That’s right. The chance to claim your worthless life is mine.”

A golden ocean appeared around the expert, and the phantom of a magnificent universe surfaced behind his back. There were hazy black and white colors inside. The power of chaos was sensed in the places where the colors met.

Emperor Que had been trying to build a complete universe of chaos with Phaseless Death, which would further strengthen him and raise him to the top tier among God Emperors.
