Chapter 1257 Senior Brothers and Sisters (2)

Ye Chen sensed the threat and punched furiously to fight back. Dark waves surged out of his body, only to be neutralized by the materials on the warship’s lining.

Ye Chen’s expression changed a bit. He attempted to teleport the warship to another time and space; however, the Dao Patterns on the ship’s surface dispelled his secret technique, and the ship stayed course as it sailed toward him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Bang!!

An enormous explosion burst out; Ye Chen was drowned by it. A tiny black hole appeared in the void, swallowing all substances around him at a crazy rate.

The massive explosion continued to spread throughout the entire Mayhem Star Zone. All the residents in the City of Sins heard the noise coming from somewhere right above their heads.

Countless people craned their heads to look up out their windows. However, only those who were exceptionally strong could see the battle in the high sky.

“Watch out!”

Song Yuan was quite stern when he saw Ye Chen disappear. Naturally, he didn’t think that a Celestial could be killed in the crash. Otherwise, the Celestial State would only be a shameless realm.

Right after crying out a warning, a pair of enormous hands extended from his back and clutched his neck.

The hands exerted strength. Boom. Song Yuan’s head instantly exploded; his body became still.

Han Ye narrowed his eyes and roared, “Senior brother!!” He rushed towards him.

“Get lost!”

Ye Chen turned around, and one of his eyes shot a beam of black light that flung Han Ye back. His chest collapsed as if having been rammed by something; his body began to decay at a fast pace.

Whoosh!

Ye Chen suddenly disappeared. Instead of following up to attack Han Ye, he broke out of their encirclement and kept chasing after the fleeing Su Ping

“Stop him!” Ji Xueqing said in a hurry. Her attack range was too short to be of use.

Exactly at that moment-a brilliant sword aura passed by. It was from Chunyu, their second senior brother; his weapon illuminated the entire space.

Ye Chen was cut by the sword. His face was cold, but he ignored his injured arm and kept charging at Su Ping.

Chunyu’s expression looked awful. He didn’t expect that the enemy would be so determined to kill Su Ping that he would ignore his attack. Such an attack was strong enough to wound a Celestial and make it impossible for them to recover right then!

“Damn it, the gap between us is too huge.” You Long—who was getting ready to attackfound that the guy had already passed him and it would be impossible to catch up. His face became contorted.

Further ahead-Su Ping sensed the freezing coldness on his back while he ran. He slashed furiously with his sword, not looking back.

Still, his sword was clenched the next moment, and Ye Chen’s scary face moved closer. “Run, just keep on running. Nobody can possibly save your life today; anyone who offends me dies. I will refine your soul and turn you into my eternal puppet!”

While feeling the enormous force clutching his sword, Su Ping kicked his enemy and separated them. He glanced back, and was relieved to see that Ji Xueqing and the others were fine.

The enemy had caught up with him, but he didn’t feel sad after seeing that Ji Xueqing and the others were fine.

“You want to go home and cultivate to exact vengeance later? Unfortunately, you won’t have the chance!” Ye Chen sneered and charged at Su Ping again. His body expanded to more than ten meters tall. His body was

infinite power.

He was almost on the top tier of the Celestial State. After all, his goal was to become a universe dominator!

A body made of Dao Patterns… Su Ping’s heart was heavy. That was a powerful constitution, much better than the ten divine constitutions of the Federation. The best bodies carried Dao Patterns and even Dao Glyphs like his.

Whoosh!

Ye Chen’s arm transformed into a giant ax that slashed at Su Ping.

Su Ping also swung his sword with his full strength. The ax and the sword clashed; Su Ping’s arm trembled and he felt that he had gone against a rocket. The terrifying blast numbed his arm.

Ye Chen’s eyes were even colder after discovering that he was only a little better than Su Ping in terms of physical strength!

Seriously?

He was a Celestial. Even though it hadn’t been long since he inherited his new body, he had already modified it with countless outstanding materials. And yet, he was only slightly stronger than Su Ping. The situation was unbelievable for him.

“Die! Die!”

Ye Chen attacked fiercely. The ax marks lingered in the void for a long time; their effect made it impossible for the void to heal.

The void was filled by sword and ax marks as they fought. Every one of their collisions made buildings tremble in the City of Sins.

“Our junior brother… is so strong!”

Ji Xueqing and the others caught up and wanted to help, only to be shocked by the fierce battle.

They had tried their best to stop Ye Chen, knowing how terrifying the Celestial expert was. All of them were speechless as they saw their junior fight head to head with the guy.

Is our junior brother really just a Star Lord?

They wouldn’t have believed him even if he claimed he was an Ascendant!

The battlefield grew as they fought, the energy from the blasts was flowing outward. Some ax auras cut buildings to pieces, while some of the sword auras darted through the buildings.

Their heated battle made it difficult to control themselves and they were destroying the environment.

“No, our junior brother is burning his vitality. He cannot stay in that status for long!” Chunyu realized what was going on, and he clenched his sword tightly.

“We must figure out a way to hold him back. Let’s set up our military formation!” Ji Xueqing turned around, and saw that Song Yuan was dashing over.

His head had been blown up earlier on. Fortunately, he had a special lifesaving technique and managed to survive. However, he was clearly in a weakened state at the moment. He heard Ji Xueqing’s proposal and nodded, then said to Chunyu, “You will control the formation!”

Chunyu took the helm. Everybody quickly went about the formation set up, their power fusing and turning into a dozen meters tall giant that marched towards the battlefield.

Ye Chen instantly felt pressure when the formation giant stepped in, becoming even more furious. I’ve used almost all my methods except for my trump card, and yet I’m still unable to defeat Su Ping?

He found it impossible to accept!

“Get the hell out of here!” Ye Chen roared and punched crazily, but he was suppressed by Chunyu’s military formation and Su Ping’s attacks. He wasn’t winning. “Junior brother, run! We can hold him back!” said Song Yuan while inside the formation.

Su Ping sobered up, gritting his teeth as he

knew he couldn’t keep that status for too long. Even though he could fight a Celestial State, the price was too dear and he couldn’t fight for extended periods. Even the enhancement of eight small worlds couldn’t make up for the gap of two major realms!

“Take care!”

Su Ping turned around and fled after replying.

He knew the hope he was carrying on his shoulders. It was actually more painful for him to flee without looking back than to stay and fight!

“You can’t escape…” said a chilly sounding voice right then. Hardly had Su Ping turned around when he saw a cold face in front of him. It belonged to Mo Ri!

At the same time—something cold plunged into his chest.

Su Ping felt that his heart stopped beating.

The freezing cold, with the power of separation, made him lower his head and see

It seemed to have sucked his blood; the sword’s edge became red.

Mo Ri exclaimed in astonishment upon seeing that. He was thrilled, as he could tell that the spirit in his weapon was reviving. The spirit had regained its consciousness in the previous battle. The consciousness was expanding at the moment; he could hear a voice in his head, calling out to him.

The voice was extremely thirsty.

“This brat’s blood…”

Mo Ri looked at Su Ping, surprised and delighted. “This trip was totally worth it. Kid, I will gladly take your soul and your body

too!”

Su Ping breathed heavily. He punched fiercely, revealing the original eight small worlds on his fist; that was his most powerful attack. He aimed to smash his fist into Mo Ri’s face.
