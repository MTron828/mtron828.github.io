Chapter 570 Humiliation

The Valiant Academy was located in the Longyang Base City.

The name sounded similar to the Longjiang Base City but the two were quite different. The Longyang Base City was among the first base cities to be recognized as Class A base cities and was located in the heart of the Subcontinent District. The Longyang Base City had set up many rules and policies which had become examples for other base cities.

On the other hand, the Longjiang Base City was of middle-level grade, located by the border of the Subcontinent District.

There were many base cities with similar names, sharing the character “Long” in them, which meant “dragons.”

Back in the beginning stage of the world, dragons were the overlords of all beasts. When humans began to build cities, many of them were prone to adopt this “Long” character. They hope that, like dragons, their base cities would stand forever, and that they could scare away some of the wild beasts with the character.

Of course, the choice was seen as a mere assumption in recent days. Still, it was a dark age when the base cities were built; using that character in the name was a common practice.

The Valiant Academy was located in the most prosperous district of the Longyang Base City.

The number one academy of the Subcontinent District was equipped with the best devices and infrastructure; there were also Mysterious Realms which belonged to the academy and students could cultivate in them. It was amazing

The students were from different base cities but they had some similarities: most were strong performers and had some connections. After all, compared to talents, resourceful connections also mattered greatly. With enough resources and support, even a less talented student could rise above his or her peers.

The rich could easily turn his or her offspring into millionaires.

On the other hand, the common man on the street might have to struggle for a lifetime to see a glimpse of hope of becoming a millionaire.

No one had to be jealous of others. Resources needed to be accumulated and that was just the thing people lacked. It was already great that someone could live a well-off life when his or her previous generations had suffered in poverty. The big families usually had a foundation built over hundreds of years. That was why they could have a vast supply of fresh blood. Making sure the family could last for another century was a difficult task as it was.

High walls stood around the Valiant Academy and the greenery extended into the distance. Even though the academy was located in the heart of the Longyang Base City, the surroundings appeared to be quite empty.

The population was found outside that extensive area with plants and vegetation. Stores were crowded together; some of them were branches of famous brands that were operating in many base cities. Some stores would have celebrities ready to welcome the VIPs.

One could see all sorts of celebrities there; singers, people in business, people in fashion, etc. Those people would be glamorous anywhere else, but they were nothing special there, because the truly famous were the battle pet warriors.

People were able to see many titled battle pet warriors flying about and they had become more than used to that.

Inside the high walls was a vast world. There was a mountain on campus; the base was dotted with buildings.

Next to a waterfall

Some young people were arguing.

Behind one of the young people stood several battle pets, all massive and rare according to the Illustrated Books. Standing in the middle was a creepy looking battle pet; its limbs that were also sharp blades dangled to the ground. That was a battle pet of the demon family, the Bloody Servant!

Such a pet would be rarely seen, even in the Valiant Academy.

“Punk, we have told you many times, this is Brother Nan’s territory. Who told you that you can come in here?” A tall young man stared at the boy who was standing in front of the Bloody Servant. The former ignored the violence and killing intent from the battle pet.

“This is a public area. When did it become his?” The young man with black hair fought back. He clenched his fists. The young person who carried sharpness and anger in his eyes was Qin Shaotian.

Many major families would send their future family heads to learn and train in the Valiant Academy.

Graduating from the Valiant Academy was one of the tests some major families had for their future family heads.

He or she would be unworthy to lead the family, if the young one was unable to graduate with a satisfactory grade from the Valiant Academy.

“It is because I said so. Don’t you talk back to me. Get lost before I lose my temper. I don’t have time to waste time with the lot of you here.” The tall young man sounded very unfriendly. Those students standing there meant nothing to him. He could surpass them, both in grades and in family background. “You...”

Another young man was hopping mad.

If someone from the Longjiang Base City were there, they would have noticed that the young man was Ye Longtian, the future family head of the Ye family. A boy with a handsome look stopped Ye Longtian from venting his anger. The former said to Qin Shaotian, “Shaotian, never mind. Let’s go somewhere else since this is Senior | Nan’s place.”

“Hmm, would you look at that? A smart boy.” That tall guy snorted.

Qin Shaotian eventually unclenched his fists and left.

Ye Longtian had to leave with him; he didn’t even try to cast a glare at that overbearing person before they left. Hot-tempered as he was, he was a future family head; he was well aware that such meaningless things would not help and would only get them in trouble.

“Hmm, some guys coming from some insignificant base cities. Who do they think they are?”

“Right. Their families never had any legendary battle pet warriors. I wonder where he got that Bloody Servant. A good pet for a loser.”

The friends of that young man didn’t hesitate to diss and show their envy.

The Bloody Servant was the second most powerful battle pet of the demon family. If trained well, it would be able to reach the peak of the titled rank, to be counted among the most powerful. One would have to beat the battle pet with greater numbers; no single battle pet could defeat the Bloody Servant easily.

“Forget it. The battle pet’s master is the one who matters. It’s just a Bloody Servant, so what? It’s got a good bloodline but the key still lies in the battle pet warrior.” That tall young man didn’t seem envious.

His friends dropped the subject.

People outside the Valiant Academy might have argued, but that was the truth in the academy!

Battle pet warriors were the factor that mattered!

That was contrary to the public opinion which held that battle pet warriors had to rely on their battle pets.

The Valiant Academy had instead taught all of its students that when battle pet warriors were strong enough, having mastered strong skills, they could compete with dragons of the same rank!

“How humiliating for us to leave like that!” Qin Shaotian and the other two left that area. As they walked on the hillside, Ye Longtian could not help but punch at the boulders. He had to find a way to vent his pent up anger. He had never suffered that insult when he was at the Longjiang Base City! Not even the Qin family had humiliated him like this. He didn’t think that the Ye family was second to the Qin family.

However, things changed when he got there. He still had his pride at the very beginning. Later on, after being taught many lessons, he had learned to eat humble pie.

“There isn’t anything that we can do. Senior Nan’s family once had legendary battle pet warriors, we cannot afford to upset him. Also, he got here earlier than we did and he’s already at the eighth rank. I heard that he reached the 15th floor of the Dragon Tower some time ago; only those at the upper position of the titled rank could have done that.”

The young man who had stopped Ye Longtian shook his head. He, too, was upset, but he knew better to endure it for a future comeback.

“Qingfeng is right. We cannot get anything from angering them.” Qin Shaotian had finally calmed down, but the anger was still hiding in the depths of his eyes.

“I originally thought that we could make a name for ourselves once we got here, to let people see how amazing we were. But we are merely the stepping stones for other people. Look at them! Ah, how insulting!” Ye Longshan punched the boulders again. He had hatred written all across his face.

“That’s not a bad thing. We left that small place to see the world outside. We were two narrow-minded before,” Liu Qingfeng went on calmly, “The world is never in want of talents and freaks. I used to think that that guy was the only one in the world. But after we got here, I realized that there are many people like him, and this is just one Subcontinent District. I cannot begin to imagine how many people like him there are in other continents...”

Qin Shaotian and Ye Longtian descended into silence.

Indeed.

Furious as they were, they had to admit that many of their fellow students were freaks.

Senior Nan was just one of them. He was a star performer in the Valiant Academy.

There were people like him. Qin Shaotian and his friends thought that those who could fight others with a higher rank were the most talented. But that was quite commonplace in the academy; most students with mediocre performance were able to do that. The better ones were able to fight with those several ranks higher.

That Senior Nan was at the eighth rank, but was able to reach the 15th level of the Dragon Tower, which was regarded to be something which could only be done by those at the upper position of the titled rank.

One had to climb the Dragon Tower in its entirety without relying on battle pets.

At the titled rank, even one position could mean a world of difference.

“We are still too weak...” Liu Qingfeng whispered. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After a moment, Qin Shaotian turned around and started to walk away. “Let’s focus on cultivating.” Ye Longtian took a deep breath. He patted Liu Qinfeng’s shoulder. They were hostile to each other when the three lived at the Longjiang Base City, but they had become friends there.

“Let’s do that. We may not be able to catch up with those freaks but we have to compete among ourselves. I will make sure that the Ye family becomes the No.1 family of the Longjiang Base City!” Ye Longtian laughed after the comment. He walked behind Qin Shaotian.

Liu Qingfeng watched the two speechlessly. One of them was an enigma and the other a mindless fool. Liu Qingfeng was unable to understand why the Qin family and the Ye family had chosen those two to be their future leaders.

And Mu Chen... was always alone. He could have stayed with them but he was determined to make it on his own. But it later turned out that he could only be someone’s minion...

Liu Qingfeng shook his head and went after his pals.

He didn’t like Ye Longtian that much but he knew that he had made a good point.

They would never catch up with those freaks but he couldn’t lag behind those two.

The No.1 family of the Longjiang Base City will be the Liu family. I will make it so! Liu Qingfeng promised himself.

In the meantime, a figure was fast approaching the Longyang Base City’s outer wall. The stirred up wind was making a loud noise. Like a meteorite, that thing was on a collision trajectory toward the base city.

Boom!

A dragon broke free from the clouds.

Standing on one of the dragon’s shoulders was a man, arms crossed in front of his chest and his clothes dancing in the wind.
