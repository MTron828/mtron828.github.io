Chapter 666 Visitors from Another World

It’s a shame that their battle pets are a complete waste.

Su Ping shook his head.

The ghosts of those legendary battle pet warriors could be enslaved. However, the contracts with their battle pets had ended the moment they died; the battle pets had been sent to an unknown destination, directly from the contract space.

Maybe those former battle pets were sitting somewhere in a daze.

“Just make them do their job!”

Su Ping decided not to bother about those battle pets.

The red glow in the Little Skeleton’s eye sockets flickered; the ghosts of Lord Nie and the others cried out sharply and dashed toward the wild beasts.

Having become the Little Skeleton’s slaves, they had been enhanced by the skeleton’s energy. Their strength grew; apart from Lord Nie, the others were all at the Ocean State!

Also, since they had become ghosts, Su Ping could even sign contracts and make them his battle pets... But Su Ping would never do such a stupid thing.

After all, their aptitude... was poor...

After the mountain-like beast king died, the advantage of the human side was secured. Humans routed the wild beasts while led by the legendary battle pet warriors.

Victory was at hand; even the commanders and advisors had stepped out of their tents, brimming with smiles.

The crisis ended!

The Longjing Base City and the Xing-Jing Defense Line were safe!

Half an hour later

Humans began to cheer once the last group of wild beasts cried and collapsed.

It was over!

They had won!!

Some of the battle pet warriors climbed massive heaps of corpses, planted their flags and shouted to celebrate their victory.

Many battle pet warriors hugged each other with tears of joy.

Other battle pet warriors went and saw to their wounded battle pets at once to comfort them.

Some battle pet warriors were trying to find remains of their battle pets in the pools of blood and flesh.

In that moment of victory, all the war correspondents turned their cameras to the person hovering in the air with many legendary battle pet warriors around him.

People were able to see from the video capture that those legendary battle pet warriors treated that person with the utmost respect. “The fact that the Longjing Base City is safe is because of the powerful battle pet warrior covered in white bones.”

“It is this bone-covered legendary battle pet warrior who saved the Longjing Base City and the Xing-Jing Defense Line!”

“This man didn’t show up at the convention before the battle. I think he was assigned here by the Tower. We do not have information about his name and title yet...”

Many pieces of news were broadcasted around the world.

Some people were calling other base cities from the Xing-Jing Defense Line to tell them the good news.

The base cities from the same defense line knew about Longjing’s dire situation.

The public was waiting anxiously to hear the updates.

They would have to evacuate immediately once Longjing fell!

Some of the neighboring base cities had already mobilized disabled and vulnerable people to the shelters when they heard about Longjing’s crisis.

After all, that was the first battle after the establishment of the defense line!

The Longjing Base City had gathered many legendary battle pet warriors. If they couldn’t withstand the strike, the other base cities on the defensive line would surely be affected.

But the tables were turned the moment Su Ping arrived!

The war correspondents were livestreaming the battle and people had been able to see some of the videos of Su Ping fighting after he arrived. The videos were blurry, but they could see the scale of destruction.

Buildings shook and the ground trembled. That level of destruction had silenced all of those watching the live stream. Even the general public was stunned by what a single man could do.

A legendary battle pet warrior.

He was peerless, like a god!!

Su Ping would speak to the legendary battle pet warriors during intervals. The war correspondents were then able to capture close-up shots of Su Ping and the Little Skeleton standing next to him.

Everyone saw the man that saved the Longjing Base City. In another base city, an old man and his granddaughter were overwhelmed by disbelief as they stared at a screen on the street.

They had seen that face before. They had stood very close to each other!

The three had met on a train when they had gone to the Holy Light Base City for the competition.

“He... is at the legendary rank.”

The old man forced a bitter smile.

He was Ji Zhantang. He had fought against wild beasts on the train with Su Ping; later on, he learned that Su Ping was a top trainer... But to his bigger astonishment, Su Ping was also a legendary battle pet warrior!

A legendary battle pet warrior and a top trainer...

Ji Qiuyu felt this was a huge blow to her confidence.

Above the Longjing Base City.

Time for me to go back.

Su Ping looked around. Things were calming down.

The entrance to the passage leading to the Deep Caves had been blocked. The wild beasts were not trying to get out. Su Ping sensed that they had withdrawn.

The beast kings had been the first to run away.

They had gone back to the Deep Caves and Su Ping couldn’t go after them because it was time and energy-consuming. After all, the Deep Caves had a complicated terrain and the small Five Elements Formation was still in operation. The formation was of little use, but what if he got carried away in a battle and destroyed what little remained of the formation? Maybe he would end up giving more freedom to the wild beasts!

“Sir!”

“Sir!”

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Apart from the legendary battle pet warriors, some of the local peak-titled warriors flew to meet Su Ping. They were the base city’s tycoons; resourceful and well-connected, they could say one word and millions would lose their jobs!

Those titled warriors stopped when they were dozens of meters away from Su Ping. They were holding him in great awe and veneration!

The legendary battle pet warriors and Venerable the Blade stood around Su Ping. They were covered in wild beasts’ blood; panting with exhaustion but smiling.

Su Ping nodded to them. He was about to say something when a person hurried over.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows

Another one at the Void State!

That person was at the peak of the Void State, several times more powerful than Lord Nie! “I am Ma Feng, Longjing Base City’s Heaven Executor. Sir, thank you for your help.” The man smiled. He had hips as strong as a bear’s and a back as supple as a tiger’s. He had a long beard, although his eyes were small; they would turn into slits when he smiled.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. Ma Feng?

“What is a Heaven Executor?” Su Ping asked calmly.

He already had an idea.

Before that battle, he would have been completely clueless and surprised. However, after learning about the Heaven Lock-and the fact that both Longjing and Longjiang were part of the formation-Su Ping thought of the formation the moment that man said that he was a Heaven Executor. Since there was an active formation, it would be understandable for there to be some guards.

“Heaven Executor...” Ma Feng looked at Su Ping, surprised that he hadn’t yet heard about them. He knew that Su Ping had killed that mountain-like beast king, his immediate assumption being that Su Ping was at the Fate State!

Those at such a state would surely enjoy a high status in the Tower, with access to confidential information!

“Well... that is a long story. Sir, just think of me as a guardian.” Ma Feng smiled.

Since Su Ping was ignorant of it, he decided to not be too direct about it. After all, his job was confidential; he didn’t want to give any secrets away.

Su Ping said a meaningful “oh” but he then understood that his guess was correct.

“I didn’t see you just now.” Su Ping narrowed his eyes.

Ma Feng explained in a hurry, “Sir, please listen to me. Just now, two Void State beast kings were in the north and I was there. I didn’t have a chance to deal with them quickly. I left this place to Nie Zecheng. I didn’t know...”

“Is that so?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows.

A legendary battle pet warrior explained, “Sir, I can prove it. Mr. Ma simply helped us distract two beast kings of the Void State. Otherwise, our defense would have been broken a long time ago.”

The others nodded.

Su Ping calmed himself down. “I will leave all matters to you. I have to go back in case the Longjiang Base City is in crisis. You have to know that our defense is not as good as yours.”

“Sir, you are leaving now?”

“Sir, why don’t you stay for the celebration?”

The legendary battle pet warriors were surprised. “What? Do you think I should stay here and moan? Celebration? Look at those corpses... There’s nothing to celebrate; go and help repair the base city. All of you are legendary battle pet warriors from the Tower; you should make greater contributions. After all, most of those base cities have to make contributions to the Tower and that is how you get your resources,” Su Ping said grumpily.

The legendary battle pet warriors were dumbstruck. Su Ping had become hostile again.

They looked at each other speechlessly.

Listen to him...

Is Su Ping not a legendary battle pet warrior from the Tower?

Ma Feng was just as startled as anyone else. But he then understood why Su Ping didn’t know about Heaven Executors.

So, Su Ping is not from the Tower. But his strength... Could it be that...

Apart from Venerable the Blade and the other two who had met Su Ping in the Tower, the others thought of another place.

The Federation!

The Interstellar Federation!

Only there could people reach the Fate State; there were even those at the Star Rank, and people said that... There were gods in the Interstellar Federation!

They looked at Su Ping with a more ardent respect. If they could befriend Su Ping and managed to somehow connect with the Interstellar Federation, their future would be more promising than staying on the Blue Planet!

The Interstellar Federation had more resources; reaching the Fate State would be much easier compared to the Blue Planet!

If they could reach the Star Rank, their life expectancy could grow to tens of thousand years, and they could even use some special means to prolong their lives even longer than that!

They all desired immortality.

“Come now, go.” Su Ping looked at those who stood around him. The changes in their expressions were fascinating. They had doubts, confusion, surprise, and then delight. How strange... He didn’t bother to ask about that.

He took his leave without delay, vanishing on the spot.

Before he vanished completely, he left one sentence for Venerable the Blade, “Brother Leng, come and help the Longjiang Base City when you have time!” Whoosh!

Su Ping teleported. He reached a place full of lava at the battleground.

That used to be a street in the base city, but the street had been melted and a Lava pool had been formed. The Inferno Dragon was lounging in the pool. It was waiting for Su Ping.

Su Ping went down and stood on one of the dragon’s shoulders.

Su Ping summoned the Purple Python and Greeny from the base city through the bond of the contract, and he sent the Little Skeleton to the contract space to have some rest as well.

As for the ghosts of Lord Nie and the others, since the Little Skeleton was not enslaving them, the ghosts were suckered into the realms of the undead.

It was impossible to summon those ghosts without a medium. Of course, Su Ping did not plan on summoning them again. After all, the Little Skeleton could summon a lot of legendary rank creatures. He didn’t need those weak things.

“Go home,” Su Ping said.

The Inferno Dragon flapped its wings and flew up from the lava pool; lava dripped down from its wings. The dragon made a dash into the distance once it reached a certain altitude.

The battle pet warriors gazed at the person and the dragon with fear and respect.

The legendary battle pet warriors in the distance watched as Su Ping left. Many people held their gazes until Su Ping flew out of the Longjing Base City. Many battle pet warriors raised their hands to salute Su Ping.

He showed up without anyone knowing him.

He left with countless people bidding him farewell.

Tens of thousands of meters above the Longjing Base City.

The Longjing Base City could barely be seen; even the Xing-Jing Defense Line and the North Pass Mountain were as small as lines. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The clouds were dimly discernible.

That place was above the atmosphere.

Countless stars were flickering in the sky.

Suddenly, a massive spaceship quietly arrived close to the atmosphere. There was no sound in the vacuum of space. The ship was emitting exhaust fumes but there was no sound. It was as if the vessel were a ghost!

The next second, that spaceship bumped into the atmosphere; the skin of the spaceship had been forged with titanium and tungsten. The friction produced blazing sparks.

Silence was broken the moment the spaceship entered the atmosphere. The engine was howling.

“Is this the Blue Planet? How ancient.”

“I cannot believe that the astral power is this thin. Piss. Do you really think we’re going to find some talents here?”

“I heard that the highest rank is the Fate State. No one has ever reached the Star Rank.”

“Reaching the Fate State is already good enough given the local environment. Let’s go and find out if the information of those people they told us about is true. Alas, if it weren’t for the fact that we’re going through hard times recruiting, we wouldn’t have had to come here...”

Several people were chatting in the spaceship.
