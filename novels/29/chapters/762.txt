Chapter 765: Astral Crystals

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Abbott and his teammates were dumbfounded by Su Ping’s casual demeanor.

Su Ping had just killed a student from the Hugh Mia Academy, and yet he didn’t consider it a big deal, at all?

They had been worried whether or not Su Ping would kill them to keep their mouths shut!

However, Su Ping didn’t seem to care the least bit about them knowing.

“W-Well...”

Right when Su Ping was about to leave, the brawny middle-aged man quickly said, “You must be the boss who rented your pet to Abbott. I can only thank you, it was of great help and we truly appreciate it. We came here partly to return it to you, and partly to give you more money...”

“That won’t be unnecessary,” Su Ping casually responded, “You can come to my shop when you’re free. Other fine pets will be available later on; you can buy some if you want.”

“Huh...”

They were dumbfounded by such a response.

Su Ping had just killed two people, yet he wanted to continue doing business.

One of the victims was from the main branch of the Ryan family, and the other was a student from the Hugh Mia Academy. Why was he still not running?

The explorers were even more astounded by his fearless attitude. The only possible explanation was that Su Ping had greater and more powerful trump cards!

That was why he was fearless!

Could any guy who advanced into the Star State be a fool?

Their awe went through the roof as they thought about that. The middle-aged man said respectfully, “We will surely pay you a visit. Thank you for helping us today, senior.”

“That’s all right. I’m just here to pick up my friend.”

The middle aged man had a worried face as he looked at the corpses. He knew they would be affected by the event, even though Su Ping was the one who had actually killed them.

The people behind the victims would unleash their wrath without restraint!

“Senior, these are the items they left...”

The middle-aged man raised his hand, and a few treasures flew into his palm. He was rather tempted by them, but he curbed his greed and gave them to Su Ping.

The latter glanced at the items. He wasn’t planning on picking them up earlier, mainly because he wasn’t short of anything.

However, it wouldn’t hurt to accept the items at this point. He had already killed those people anyway; it wouldn’t make a difference whether or not he took the items.

“You should find shelter in case there are repercussions,” said Su Ping casually after accepting the items.

The middle-aged man became alarmed, then nodded respectfully.

He had truly made up his mind to leave Rhea right after Su Ping left.

The wrath of the Ryan family was too much for them to take.

As for the Hugh Mia Academy, that was easier. They had nothing to do with those deaths, although they had observed the whole thing, there would be no punishment due for their actions.

Su Ping simply left with the Little Skeleton after accepting the items.

The explorers began to breathe heavily when he left, as if a huge rock would have been removed from their hearts.

“This is unbelievable! The shop you went to is being run by a Star State expert!”

“Oh my god! An honorable Star State expert is working as a small shop owner!”

“There are too many experts in this world who like to keep a low profile. Let’s avoid being cocky on our future trips in case we piss off any bigshot that happens to be traveling incognito.”

“Captain, should we leave Rhea?”

The middle-aged man withdrew his gaze and heaved a sigh. “Yes, we must. Make the preparations right now. Ajer, buy tickets for us right now.”

...

Su Ping returned to his shop soon after.

The whole thing was just a minor incident in his perspective.

He didn’t care too much about either the Ryan family or the Hugh Mia Academy.

He believed he could take care of the Ryan family on his own. As for the Hugh Mia Academy, he didn’t think it would decide to wage war against him for just one student.

If they didn’t choose violence against him, he could always hide in his shop until he reached the Star State.

Those two people seemed to be from powerful backgrounds. I wonder what they left behind.

Su Ping glanced at the items in his hand. He had noticed that some of the items were for storage purposes when the middle aged man handed them to him.

He easily recognized the patterns on the items.

He had learned formations from Joanna for a while anyway; he could still recognize them, even though he couldn’t make any.

Huh? They’re locked?

Su Ping found it was impossible to open the items.

He instantly found Joanna in the shop and asked, “Can you crack the locks on these items?”

Joanna opened her eyes and looked at the objects. “Where did you get them? The blood is quite fresh. Did you kill their owners?”

“Yes, I just did.” Su Ping nodded.

He sounded like he had just killed some chickens.

Joanna was speechless. She knew that nothing good would happen after Su Ping left the shop; he wasn’t a tame and obedient guy, at all.

“Let me take a look.”

Su Ping gave one of the items to her.

Divine fire popped from Joanna’s fingers and vaporized the locks set on the item, but she controlled it neatly without damaging the item itself.

“It’s just a minor lock,” Joanna remarked casually after a few quick glances, then she quickly wove a pattern before she patted it over the item.

Very soon, the item clicked.

Joanna threw the item back to Su Ping and cracked the other items in the same way.

Su Ping accepted the item; his senses then entered the storage item without meeting any obstacles.

The first item was a bracelet which contained an enormous space. There was a hill of clothes by a corner of the space.

There were luxurious dresses, shoes, lingerie, hair bands and other women’s decorations. All that mound of clothing and accessories had been loaded in a super closet in order.

There were all kinds of secret treasures, but they only emitted the energy waves of the Void State. Fate State treasures had been placed separately.

There was another corner where glowing blue crystals had been piled up. The crystals emanated a dense and pure astral power.

Su Ping was slightly surprised, as the crystals contained nothing but astral power; they looked like compressed and refined astral power.

Are they training resources?

Su Ping intended to investigate them later.

There was miscellaneous stuff gathered in another corner, including a special glittering horn, something that looked like a beautiful spiky coral, and several maps.

Su Ping suddenly noticed a blue card that was kept separately in a rather obvious place.

He sent out a thought.

The card quickly flew out of the storage space in his hand.

“The Hugh Mia Academy?”

Su Ping was surprised to see the words on the card. He focused his attention to see more detail, and a piece of introductory information flooded into his head. He realized it was a student card of the Hugh Mia Academy.

No wonder it was kept in the most obvious place. It was probably more convenient to be taken out this way.

There was also a lock inside the card. Behind the lock was the feeble aura left by Denise whom Su Ping had killed.

There were many places inside the academy where the students’ identities had to be confirmed with the cards as well as the aura imbued in them.

Su Ping raised his eyes and asked Joanna, “Can you crack this lock?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Joanna was already used to the odd jobs Su Ping gave her. She accepted the item and frowned. “It’s slightly complicated.”

“Slightly?”

Su Ping was surprised. The student cards of the Hugh Mia Academy—one of the five best academies—were so important that the locks they used couldn’t be bad.

Joanna replied casually, “It was made by human beings anyway. You’re just juveniles in terms of formations.”

With that, she quickly gathered divine light on her fingertips and drew a vintage and sophisticated formation. The lock on the student card was instantly destroyed.

The aura saved behind the lock drifted out and vanished in the air.

Joanna gave the card back to Su Ping and said, “It is now ownerless.”

Su Ping checked it and found that it did become an empty card.

He casually tossed it into the system space. It was useless to him at the moment, but it might be useful later.

Then, Su Ping examined the other storage items one by one.

He also found some astral crystals mixed in the two old men’s items, but they weren’t as many. Together, they would only have about one fifth of what the girl had.

It wasn’t hard to imagine her position and privileges.

She was only a Fate State warrior; still, her resources were multiple times superior to resources than the Fate State men did.

There were also astral crystals in the young man’s storage item; they were about half of what the girl had. Apart from them, there were male clothes, secret treasures and miscellaneous stuff.

To Su Ping’s surprise, there were some female clothes next to the male ones. Plus, their sizes were quite similar...

Is the guy actually a drag queen?

What a shame.

Su Ping shook his head and collected the secret treasures. Then, he searched for information about the blue crystals with the Lord Badge and easily found what he wanted.

They were indeed training resources.

The astral crystals were natural crystals which contain astral power. They had five levels, namely green, blue, purple, red, and golden!

The higher-level astral crystals were much rarer; the quantity and purity of the astral power contained in them were significantly higher, too!

Most battle pet warriors ranging from the Ocean State and the Fate State trained with blue astral crystals—

Those who were poor even used green astral crystals.

They’re that expensive? One of them is worth a hundred thousand?

Su Ping looked for the pricing, only to be shocked.

One blue astral crystal would cost a hundred thousand astral crystals.

Ten of them would equate to a million.

The purple astral crystals were even more expensive. They went for one million apiece!

Su Ping remembered the girl’s hill of astral crystals. There had to be hundreds of thousands of astral crystals in it, if not millions!

“It is true that every genius is made of resources,” Su Ping secretly remarked.
