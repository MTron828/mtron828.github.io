Chapter 1057: Ranking

Su Ping found some information about the Blood Source Crystals from the Federation‚Äôs database too. However, it only listed two of the item‚Äôs usages: consolidation of small worlds and war creatures‚Äô modification.

The Blood Source Crystal could strengthen a small world once infused into it.

However, the crystal could never touch the blood of any living creature. Even if it accidentally touched a wound, it would still be absorbed into the body, corrupting the creature which would turn into a bloodthirsty animal with only fighting and killing on its mind.

Such usage was the first one detected. So, the crystals were applied to large-scale universal wars.

But then, people found that they could strengthen small worlds through further research; they were no longer wasted on war creatures after that.

After all, soldiers could be trained to be relentless, but there was only a limited supply of Blood Source Crystals in the entire universe. Few treasures could strengthen small worlds, and the crystals were the most effective of all; they were extremely valuable.

Su Ping had a surge of mixed feelings after receiving all those resources. The top geniuses did have a lot of privileges.

He suddenly thought of something, and called the system in his heart. Soon after, he opened the Multiverse Human Rank in his head.

He had barely made it to the top five hundred on the rank earlier on.

He wanted to check his ranking after absorbing the crystals.

After searching for a long time, Su Ping found his ranking, and was rather surprised.

‚ÄúThe 182nd!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ranked 182nd right now!‚Äù

Every level had its own rankings! Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

He was only in the Star State at the moment, but he had condensed two small worlds. Even Ji Xueqing, a Heavenly Lord, claimed it was impossible for him to make further progress!

Under such circumstances, he barely made it to the 182nd?

Did that mean that there were 181 guys who were stronger than him?

Su Ping had never questioned the system‚Äôs judgment or the ranking accuracy. After all, the system had always upheld high standards, and took all the species throughout history into account.

I think I‚Äôm almost reaching my limits, yet I only rank 182nd‚Ä¶ It means that I‚Äôm not the only human who has condensed two small worlds in the Star State!

Su Ping was feeling quite frustrated.

To be honest, he had indeed been rather arrogant.

He had killed a godly prince who was beyond his level when he was only in the Star State. How awesome was that!

However, even after such an astounding feat, he merely ranked 182nd amongst all humans!

Su Ping found it hard to imagine what kind of monsters the 181 guys ahead of him were!

However, I ranked behind the 400th earlier, barely entering the top five hundred rankings. I surpassed more than three hundred people just by condensing a second small world!

Maybe I‚Äôll be able to reach the top if I condense another world!

Su Ping was again thrilled at the prospect.

Even the Ancestral God in the Archean Divinity had only condensed seven small worlds. He probably had a high ranking among all species. Su Ping believed he would be able to rise in the rankings if he condensed seven small worlds.

However, even the goal of condensing a third world seemed far-fetched at the moment. Su Ping didn‚Äôt dare to dream too far. He could only try to reach the Ascendant State as quickly as possible if there was no way to condense seven worlds.

Let‚Äôs see how much higher my ranking will rise after I absorb the Blood Source Crystals,?Su Ping thought.

Su Ping no longer dallied; he closed the rank and calmed down, then waved his hand, attracting the Source Blood Crystals towards him.

His small world was manifested. He was enshrouded in the dead and desolate small world, which began to show amazing changes the moment it touched the crystals.

The crystals turned from bloody gems into flowing liquid, and then into a bloody mist. They became illusory in the end; projections that could be seen but not touched. They gradually melded with his small world.

A reddish hue was instantly added to Su Ping‚Äôs small world.

The bloody color was spread to every corner of the small world through laws.

A substance able to affect the small world. How wondrous.?Su Ping looked at the scene, visibly amazed. It was quite the eye-opener for him; there were truly all sorts of treasures in that vast universe.

Something has indeed changed.

Su Ping could tell that his small world was becoming increasingly harder. Once the reddish substance seeped into his small world, it then spread out, injecting new blood and energy to his small world. The laws in his small world were then intertwined and tightened.

I somehow feel that my small world was given life‚Ä¶

Su Ping examined his small world and his shock deepend. Those treasures were truly unbelievable.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

Ji Xueqing was still nearby, watching Su Ping absorb the Blood Source Crystals with his eyes closed. The young man showed no signs of stopping even by the time she thought he would be full.

Su Ping‚Äôs small world was like a monster with the stomach of a whale. It seemed that he would never be full!

‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù

Ji Xueqing was astonished. She narrowed her eyes and observed his small world carefully. She found that Su Ping wasn‚Äôt just collecting the Blood Source Crystals; he was truly absorbing them with his small world.

However, there was no sign of his small world from being filled, even though it had eaten lots of crystals!

His small world should be saturated by now, even if it has reached the peak.

Ji Xueqing wasn‚Äôt an idiot; she had seen many things given that she already was a Heavenly Lord. Su Ping‚Äôs anomaly made her immediately realize that her junior brother had more secrets!

This guy!

Ji Xueqing breathed heavily. She was a top genius too, and as every other genius, she was confident in herself, never thinking that others were better than her.

However, Su Ping had slapped her in the face with his potential.

I really want to cut him apart and see how many secrets he‚Äôs hiding!?Ji Xueqing‚Äôs eyes glittered. She felt embarrassed once again upon remembering how Su Ping had interrupted her several times earlier.

She wanted to give his junior brother an eye-opener experience, so that he would think twice before trying to show off in front of his senior sister!

Time flew by.

Ji Xueqing was no longer able to remain calm.

He‚Äôs still absorbing!

Is he still not done?

How hungry is he? Why is he still not full?

She had an awful looking expression as she saw how the Blood Source Crystals were almost running out. She had presented quite a large mountain of crystals mainly because she wanted to impress him. She thought that Su Ping would only need half of them!

However, the man ended up gobbling them all!

Many of the Blood Source Crystals were her own; she had prepared them for the juniors of her family.

But what could she do?

Interrupt Su Ping?

That was not possible.

Su Ping had yet to reach his upper limit since he was still absorbing crystals; so, he had to keep absorbing, otherwise his secluded training would be pointless.

Ji Xueqing calmed down after pondering further.?Never mind. If he does get the legacy, he will know the price that I‚Äôve paid today!

She was investing in Su Ping because she wanted him to owe her a favor, not to merely return those resources.

She was betting on the possibility that he would get the legacy.

It would not be counted as a waste of time if Su Ping returned those resources after he reached the Celestial State.

Su Ping stopped soon after, when the Source Blood Crystals were about to be completely consumed; a heavy aura began to spread from his small world afterwards.

Su Ping slowly opened his eyes and turned his small world into a ball that floated on top of his hand. He gazed at it, and found that it was virtually flawless, much better than before.

If laws were veins and the supreme laws were pillars, the Blood Source Crystals seemed to be the small world‚Äôs blood!

I didn‚Äôt know there were treasures that could strengthen a world built up through cultivation. It‚Äôs as though they exist in different dimensions. No wonder they are rare resources even in the scope of the entire universe,?Su Ping thought.

Although he didn‚Äôt do anything, Su Ping could tell that his combat ability was significantly improved.

He recalled the small world, never showing his other world of illusion, which had also been filled.

In fact, it would be hard for an outsider to detect it if he was determined to hide it.

After all, the small world was his own domain, created with his own laws. Only experts with a much higher cultivation‚Äîor anyone who tried to break into his small world by destructive means to investigate‚Äîcould see all the secrets within.

Let me check my ranking.

Su Ping closed his eyes again, and opened the Multiverse Human Rank.

The 165th!

Su Ping‚Äôs eyes glittered with delight.

His position had been improved by almost twenty ranks; that was a huge improvement!

Therefore, it was possible that he would rise to a very high position by the time he condensed a third world and absorbed the Blood Source Crystals again. He might even reach the top!

Ji Xueqing became calm again upon seeing the delight on Su Ping‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúHow about it? How do you feel?‚Äù

Su Ping opened his eyes and smiled. ‚ÄúThank you for your Blood Source Crystals, senior sister. They were fantastic!‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

Ji Xueqing then asked, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll try to break into the Star Lord State?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would like to see your laws first, senior sister,‚Äù said Su Ping.

He could naturally become a Star Lord; there was no need for him to spend a lot of time cultivating.

Ji Xueqing frowned, seeing that Su Ping was still unwilling to let go, but she didn‚Äôt try to persuade him again.

‚ÄúGood. Let‚Äôs proceed.‚Äù

She believed that he would promptly give up after trying.

The time wasted would be a price that he would have to bear.

Ji Xueqing stored the remaining crystals and was about to give Su Ping a demonstration‚Äî

Su Ping quickly asked, ‚ÄúSenior sister, do you have more of those Blood Source Crystals?‚Äù

Ji Xueqing raised her eyebrows and asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want more.‚Äù

Su Ping coughed after noticing the confusion in Ji Xueqing‚Äôs eyes. He didn‚Äôt want to expose his second world yet. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ have a friend. I want to gather some crystals for him.‚Äù

Ji Xueqing was lost for words.?Does the guy not know how precious Blood Source Crystals are?

‚ÄúJust get the legacy if you really want to help your friend. People will readily offer you things like this when you reach the Celestial State,‚Äù said Ji Xueqing casually.

Su Ping smiled bitterly, deciding not to insist. He could search for materials on his own after condensing a third small world..
