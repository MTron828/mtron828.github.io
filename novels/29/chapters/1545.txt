Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping took a deep breath. They were already dead, yet he could still feel their immense willpower after millions of years.

Slay the Heavens!

At the end of the day, their determination didn’t fail them, it carried on.

Su Ping stepped forward, eyes as sharp as blades. He could feel a cold and deep aura in the furthest distance of his perception, like a swirling black hole that twisted and swallowed his senses.

It was the familiar feeling produced by the Heavenly Dao!

!!

“Set up the first formation. Unjustified Heavenly Dao, charge!” Su Ping said in a low voice.

The three thousand warships shook, each of them a universe in its own right. Commanded by Su Ping, they were shaped into a sharp arrow with Su Ping at the front.

The billions of species inside the warships—led by the experts of their respective clans—set up the formation!

Their fighting will was unstoppable!

Once the magnificent ancient array was unfolded, Su Ping finally leashed out, transforming into an arrow and dashed forward.

The three thousand warships followed!

It had to be said that Sorcerer Ancestor Yin Que had left the perfect position for Su Ping, right next to the edge of the Heavenly Dao’ defense. This could allow Su Ping’s power as well as that of all his subordinates to reach the peak.

Su Ping noticed that the vague auras of the Heavenly Dao forces were also gathering.

The enemy had discovered him right when he charged toward them.

The war had already begun!

Billions of kilometers had been crossed instantly!

The chaos aura and the ancient Dao power was intense in the Ancestral Land of Chaos. Even normal Ascendants were hardly able to fly. Celestials were like ordinary people with a tiny bit of power; only the Dao Heart experts and above could travel freely.

Su Ping’s three thousand warships sheltered the weak, preventing them from being pressured by the prevailing environment. This also helped them unleash their power.

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, Su Ping saw the Heavenly Dao beings.

Those dark figures were like a majestic wall blocking his path. It was insurmountable and breathtaking, looking down upon all the other lives, making them feel insignificant.

However, the next moment—a long spear ripped the wind appart and pierced one of the Heavenly Dao creatures.

The being was set ablaze, and was instantly burnt!

Su Ping’s body was hundreds of thousands of feet tall, and was just as wild and domineering as the Heavenly Dao. He waved a hand and summoned his long spear to make a sweeping motion.

There was a loud bang!

All the Heavenly Dao creatures before him were cut apart like withered grass. The Great Dao power had fully annihilated them before they could react.

Su Ping was at the moment able to easily kill Undying State experts, let alone Dao Heart fighters.

However, after the Heavenly Dao beings were killed, the light of chaos appeared and more Heavenly Dao minions gathered in the void, seemingly coming from some sort of teleportation channel. They appeared out of thin air, giving Su Ping cold and expressionless gazes, utterly ignoring his shocking killing intent.

Su Ping discovered that all the Heavenly Dao forces were gathering where he was, their numbers endless to a suffocating degree as he pushed the reach of his perception.

“Die!!” Su Ping roared furiously, not giving those creatures an opportunity to delay.

He wielded the spear and jumped towards the Heavenly Dao ranks to make sweeping attacks. None of them was able to resist.

Behind him were the three thousand warships. They attacked the Heavenly Dao forces and instantly caused openings, crushing tens of thousands of humanoids to pieces.

The bodies stuck to the bottom of the warships broke free and kept fighting the Heavenly Dao in their incomplete state!

Some bodies mauled enemies crazily, like deranged monsters. Some of the corpses were already destroyed halfway, but they waved their remaining limbs and fought!

Further into the distance, within Su Ping’s range of perception—the seemingly identical forces of the Heavenly Dao surged like a torrent. There were too many of them, filling his view.

Killing intent surged in Su Ping’s eyes. The long spear turned into a sword, and his strength quickly soared. An intense sword aura turned dozens of kilometers long, slashing dozens of Heavenly Dao beings.

He discovered that those creatures’ actions were coordinated. Furthermore, even if they only had a Dao Heart level, the damage from the Dao attacks was greatly weakened.

The Heavenly Dao seemed to be highly resistant to the power of Dao found in nature. They would usually have the advantage if both sides were in the Undying State.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

All of a sudden, a hundred golden lights of chaos fell towards Su Ping like whips.

He blocked the light with his gigantic arm, which was left with hundreds of cracks. His body had been hurt!

It is important to recall that he had already attained the Primitive Chaos Clan body, which was even enhanced by the Golden Crow bloodline that had also been cultivated to the extreme. His body had been perfected after gathering the bloodlines of both clans; he was no longer able to absorb more bloodlines, even if he wanted to.

Normal Undying State experts were incapable of hurting him.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Su Ping looked up and saw Heavenly Dao fighters descend. They seemed to be slightly different, but they all gave him cold and angry stares.

“We’re fighting for our great cause. How dare you disrupt us!!” roared one of the Heavenly Dao fighters, its voice echoing throughout the battlefield. It released an immense aura of chaos and transformed into a creature as huge as a planet, looking down at the battlefield with eyes like the sun. “Listen to our judgment, and don’t reincarnate anymore!”

A brilliant light was emanated by its body. A hundred Heavenly Dao beings around it released chaos aura to connect to the transformed ally.

Instantly, all those humanoids extended their arms and the Wheels of Judgment appeared. The next moment, those artifacts swirled and gathered into an enormous wheel, even bigger than the warships condensed by Su Ping!

That Wheel of Judgment was big enough to swallow a warship.

The object emitted a scorching light as it moved towards our hero.

Su Ping stood on the battlefield like an unparalleled mythical creature, eyes arrogant and cold. The sword in his hand was glittering. As the enormous Wheel of Judgment fell—he suddenly roared and the sword turned billions of kilometers long, piercing through the entire battlefield.

Boom!!

The sword slashed down and the enormous Wheel of Judgment was instantly shattered, resulting in a hundred Heavenly Dao beings shivering. Some were even sent flying, suffering from heavy wounds.

Su Ping’s sword made a sweeping motion, instantly drawing a circle on the battlefield and clearing the area within. The hundred Undying State-level Heavenly Dao humanoids were cut apart by the sword aura. Whatever Dao power remained was the only thing keeping them alive.

He stepped forward and simply crushed their bodies, not even bothering to look back.

The Heavenly Dao forces were still flooding over, soon filling the circle that Su Ping had just cleared.

He continued to fight with a gloomy demeanor.

The number of Heavenly Dao fighters was beyond his imagination, and that was only a place in the periphery.

Su Ping didn’t know how long he had been fighting, but he saw no decline in the number of his enemies. That long battle was like a dream.

Roar!!

Exactly at that moment, a deafening roar sounded at the end of the horizon.

The roar swept through millions of kilometers, even making Su Ping’s soul shiver. The three thousand warships around him also shook!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and looked into the distance.

There, an unimaginably massive shadow was rising, its eyes alone being already as huge as the sun. Then, there was the enormous and scary dragon head, and a torso as huge as a galaxy!

Su Ping was dazed.

That was… Sorcerer Ancestor Yuan Long!

He immediately remembered what the system had told him: Yuan Long had been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao in the previous war!

“Indeed, you’re the ant that appeared in my memories. I already knew when my mother trained you in the illusions, and I knew that this war would soon begin. Just as I expected!”

Yuan Long saw Su Ping at the center of the battlefield. There was coldness in its enormous eyes.

“You knew?” Su Ping’s eyes were cold.

Yuan Long sneered, “That’s right. My level is beyond your imagination, and I’m even stronger than before. As long as I appear in your illusion and see you, I will know!”

“My name must not be spoken!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“My eyes see through everything!”

Its body coiled, occupying half of the enormous battlefield. It stretched forward and crossed millions of kilometers as it moved closer to where Su Ping was.

The enormous dragon head looked down at Su Ping like a deity in the sky looking down at mere mortals on the ground.
