Chapter 1258 The Skeleton’s Rise to the Ascendant State (1)

Mo Ri slightly changed his expression, then raised his hand to block the attack. Dao Patterns gathered in his hand like a vortex; however, they were penetrated by Su Ping’s fist and shattered the next moment. The violent force ripped his entire arm apart!

Whoosh!

Mo Ri was flung backwards in shock, as Su Ping was more powerful than he had imagined. Is the guy truly a Star Lord?

He thought that Ye Chen was deliberating buying himself more time as he saw them fight, all to avoid Shen Huang’s dying strike.

He just realized that Ye Chen wasn’t playing tricks. It was because the brat was truly unusual!

Su Ping approached his limits after forcing Mo Ri to retreat. His aura plummeted and he couldn’t even pretend to be tough any longer. His weakness was revealed.

The wound on his chest quickly began to spread out since his power was no longer suppressing the sword’s effect. The Dao Patterns and laws embedded in the wound were destroying Su Ping’s body.

Su Ping held back the excruciating pain; he tore the void open and charged to the distance.

“Become nutrition for my saber!” Mo Ri realized that Su Ping wasn’t pretending. He dashed over after the initial shock, and his blazing Nether Saber slashed down.

Su Ping stopped abruptly and was forced out of the void. The blazing saber approached his head, its fire reflected in his eyes.

Was he truly unable to go any further?

Stubbornness emanated from Su Ping’s eyes. He would admit defeat if he were to be the only one to die that day. After all, he had been through countless battles, and he was already prepared to die. Countless geniuses had perished before they could grow up, and he shouldn’t be an exception.

However… His master, Song Yuan and the others were going to be killed because of him. He didn’t want that to happen!

He didn’t want to fall before he had the chance to avenge them!

Whoosh!

His body turned all of a sudden, dodging the saber in a weird posture. Meanwhile, he raised his hand and invoked a stream of power that pushed Mo Ri back. He moved with the counterforce.

Mo Ri was shocked and suspicious. He could tell that Su Ping was running out of strength. How can he still be so strong?

Su Ping was equally stunned. Then, he sensed some thoughts transmitted to his head. He couldn’t help but lower his head, only to see flesh gathering on his chest wound. Then, a head craned out of it. It belonged to the young Chaos Beast!

“Master, I’ll sustain the wound and stop him for you. Just run!”

The young Chaos Beast spoke with the voice of a little boy.

Su Ping instantly realized what was going on. His eyes were brimming with tears; he had merged with the young Chaos Beast and the latter was voluntarily canceling the fusion, and transferring the wound unto itself to endure it in his place!

I’m your master, I should be the one protecting you!

“Boss, go! We’ve got this!” The Inferno Dragon’s voice also resounded in his head, no longer as obedient and funny as per usual; it was solemn and serious instead. It was clear that the pet knew it was an unusually critical battle.

Su Ping watched the young Chaos Beast break free from him and bit his lip. He recalled everything that happened on the Blue Planet.

The Inferno Dragon had once sacrificed itself too to protect him, and so did the Dark Dragon Hound!

Was it the young Chaos Beast’s turn? Still, there truly was no chance for him to turn things around and rescue them this time.

“I promised that I would protect you. Even if you stay, you can’t stop him for long. You should be the ones to escape. You’ve all been well trained by me; even though your bloodlines were humble at the beginning, you all have a chance of rising to the Celestial State and even higher. Especially you…” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Su Ping spoke with determination in his eyes as he looked at the young Chaos Beast’s head protruding from his chest. “Considering your ultimate chaos bloodline, it should be easy for you to grow and become an Ancestral God in the future. You shouldn’t die here.”

“Master, you…”

The young Chaos Beast was surprised. It sensed that the wound was being transferred back to Su Ping. He was returning the favor!

“But master, we’ll lose our contract and our memories of you if the contract is destroyed. We won’t remember that we need to avenge you!” cried the Inferno Dragon, feeling despair.

“I will engrave Dao Patterns on you. Even if you forget, you will still have a chance to avenge me in the future.” Su Ping’s voice calmed down.

He was unwilling to fall; he would have no chance to exact vengeance

However, he could only entrust the responsibility to the young Chaos Beast and the others.

They were all the most excellent pets in Su Ping’s eyes, with the best bloodlines in the world. They would surely exceed the Celestial State!

“What a shame. I promised that I would turn you into the strongest dragon ever. I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep that promise. I hope you won’t blame me,” said Su Ping to the Inferno Dragon with a solemn voice.

They had been communicating telepathically, and it was done in an instant.

The Inferno Dragon realized what Su Ping implied. That magnificent and ferocious dragon wept like a kid. “I don’t want to become the strongest dragon; I simply want to be your dragon forever!”

“Master, please don’t…” Fear emanated from the Chaos Beast’s black eyes. Su Ping’s control was greater when they were fused. Its power was increasing as Su Ping’s body withdrew the damaged flesh and sent his remaining power into his pet’s body.
