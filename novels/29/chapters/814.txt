Chapter 816: Su Ping’s Constitution

“Seriously?”

“The Void State... Even I can’t see through him with my Eyes of Delusion!”

“I didn’t notice it before. Is this guy really a Void State warrior, or is he concealing his strength?”

Many Star Lords were shocked and suspicious.

Their perception technique was definitely above the Star State, yet they couldn’t detect Su Ping’s actual level, which was rather weird.

Some of them even examined Su Ping with the power of the small world, but they still couldn’t detect any Star State aura in his body.

He seemed to be in the Void State from every perspective.

However... Only three men were left in the small world, and one of them was in the Void State?

Apart from the Star Lords, the unaffiliated cultivators in the Star State were also shocked and suspicious.

Many people in the Alliance of Stars had noticed Su Ping’s level and simply thought that he was good at disguise. They were rather surprised to hear the whispers.

Is nobody here able to see through Su Ping’s disguise?

His disguise abilities are truly astounding!

“Look, all those Star Lords are saying that Brother Heaven Destroyer is in the Void State. What is going on?”

“Seriously? Not even the Star Lords can detect Brother Heaven Destroyer’s real level?”

“Well... Who exactly is this new member?”

Many people in the Alliance of Stars looked at O’Neil.

O’Neil was at a loss just like them.

He knew that Su Ping was very strong, but he didn’t know that Star Lords also had a hard time seeing through his cover!

Is Su Ping at the peak of the Star State?

But if it were so, he wouldn’t have let Garland or neither of his fellows get away earlier.

O’Neil felt confused. He couldn’t figure out the reason, but there was a shocking conjecture he didn’t dare to confirm. If true, then Su Ping would definitely be much more horrifying than the purple-robed young man who had crushed all those Star State experts!

After all, Su Ping’s main focus was pet training. A grandmaster trainer at that!

“Huh?”

Still within the small world, the purple-robed young man noticed the aura Su Ping unleashed too. He slightly raised his eyebrows but didn’t pay much attention.

The Void State? I can easily take care of that guy if that’s his real cultivation.

If it was fake, it wouldn’t be a big deal. He was never good at scanning; advanced Star State warriors could have easily disguised themselves in front of him.

After all, he would be a real monster if he was better than them in every aspect!

“If you want to fight, don’t hide your cultivation and show me your real strength.”

The purple-robed young man chuckled.

All the contestants had been knocked out except for the two sturdy guys. He didn’t consider them a big deal at all; in fact he was delighted, since he was ready to take the Tree of Laws.

“You see through me?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Su Ping was surprised. Then, he didn’t hide his strength anymore. That purple-robed young man was quite tricky to deal with. Even he wasn’t confident of beating him, depending on how many trump cards the other guy had.

With a thought, he summoned the Little Skeleton, calling him for a dual fusion.

Swoosh!

The Little Skeleton quickly disappeared into Su Ping’s body. White bones soon grew out of his pores and spread on his arms, neck, chest and face. All his vitals were covered in bones. Then, after merging with the white-scaled Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon, he looked like a skeleton dragon!

His pointy tail was swept in midair and pushed the air out. If they were in the outside world, that tail swing was enough to tear open the secondary space!

Su Ping grew significantly stronger after the fusions, like a rising sun. He emitted an expanding aura.

Swoosh!

As he breathed, Su Ping felt like the air he exhaled could penetrate the void.

His eyes became solemn and sharp.

“Huh?”

“Dual fusion? That seems to be a parasite beast!”

“That skeleton... seems to belong to the Skeleton Kings’ family. Those aren’t parasite beasts. They’re battle pets strong in offense that are also capable of emulating the parasite beasts’ ability.”

“Skeleton Kings? But that skeleton doesn’t seem to be the same as the Skeleton Kings I know. It’s not as large... Is it an inferior mutant?”

“He seems to be in the Star State. Nobody in the Void State carries such an aura. His disguise technique is truly horrifying!”

“That’s true. Even I fail to find out exactly how strong he is exactly. He must be using top Star Lord secret techniques, or even of the Ascendant State!”

“He has really been keeping a low profile. He must hail from a powerful background!”

Outside of the battlefield, the Star Lords kept on whispering in astonishment.

Given that they sensed Su Ping’s aura, which was close to the advanced phase of the Star State, all had thought at first that they had made an error when gauging his level, as it wasn’t something that anyone in the Void State could achieve.

Maybe Su Ping wasn’t really an advanced Star State warrior, but he was undoubtedly in the Star State!

“A Skeleton King...” the purple-robed young man narrowed his eyes at Su Ping and then said casually, “You can only reach the advanced Star State with the dual fusion, so you must be originally in the beginning phase of the Star State. You may be a genius, but you’re not good enough!”

He suddenly launched an attack as he talked; an overwhelming number of chains were slapped on Su Ping’s head.

The chains were glowing. They contained the purple-robed young man’s power of laws and constitution, which were able to cut the land apart!

Su Ping didn’t say anything. He certainly knew that the dual fusion wasn’t good enough, which was why he performed it at the beginning.

“Not using your strength isn’t good enough, either!”

Su Ping suddenly threw a punch of his own. Billions of vortexes revolved inside his cells, unleashing a horrifying power that could rip planets apart. His astral power instantly rose to the peak.

The refined divine power in his acupoints were gathered and compressed on his fist, to then be launched with an attack.

Boom!

The fist glowed like the sun, releasing an overwhelming power when it collided with the chains.

The entire small world instantly began to shake; the shattered land also trembled!

The chains were flung back by the punch, and the divine light on the chains started to dim. The power of laws were also shaken and thrown back to the purple-robed young man like dozens of dead snakes.

Su Ping had actually won on that first collision!

All the observers outside the small world were shocked and filled with disbelief.

The punch was so brilliant and majestic, seemingly strong enough to shake the planet!

“This... This fist technique...”

“It’s so fierce and unstoppable as if able to destroy everything in its way!”

In the Heavenly Fist Alliance’s corner—

Shennong’s Three Punches looked at Su Ping in shock. He had been familiar with all sorts of fist techniques, but the attack that Su Ping had just demonstrated was still an eye-opener for him.

It was quite similar to the fist technique he practiced. They were both brutal and domineering.

However, Su Ping’s fist technique was even more domineering!

If he managed to learn something from Su Ping’s technique, his fist would become even more powerful than before!

“Huh?”

The purple-robed young man retrieved the chains and became cold. Anger and killing intent surfaced in his eyes; he had planned to finish off the guy quickly, but the latter had shown remarkable strength.

However, does he really think he can win the competition with that?

“Bloody Demon Immortality Technique!”

After a boom, the purple-robed young man performed his technique again. Deep red mist of blood rose from his body and was spread out over his chains.

The divine light covering the chains—mixed with the blood—became red-and-golden and looked rather evil.

Su Ping retreated his fist and gazed at his opponent coldly.

His fist was really powerful because he had made use of his own technique.

Some techniques could enhance a person’s astral power, some could invoke the potential in their own blood, and some could transform metals into energy.

The Chaos Star Chart that Su Ping practiced, on the other hand, helped him gather a horrifying and explosive power!

Su Ping was better able to notice how remarkable the technique was as he rose to higher levels; it was one of the reasons why he was confident of fighting that man.

“Thousand Lock Star Piercing Spear!”

Rage appeared in the purple-robed young man’s eyes. He performed a technique that he hadn’t used yet. Boosted by his divine constitution and his techniques, plus the law of destruction he had thoroughly grasped, he swung the chains like hundreds of snakes and gathered them to form a golden spear!

It was one of his strongest attack techniques. It abandoned all defenses and was fully focused on offense!

Together with the destructiveness of the chains themselves, it could pierce through even a sturdy advanced Star State pet!

“What an intimidating aura!”

“The Bloody Demon Immortality Technique seems to be an ancient evil technique!”

“I didn’t expect that the guy would have such a method. Didn’t he use it before because he had to defend against our attacks?”

“This guy is even more terrifying in a duel!”

The people outside of the battlefield changed their expressions when they saw the chain spear that gathered bloody aura and divine light.

All the champions who had been relocated earlier felt fortunate for not staying in the same world with such a monster. It was almost like staying inside a cage holding a ferocious beast!

“Brother Heaven Destroyer!”

Father Time’s expression also changed. He sensed a dazzling and unstoppable power that he had never encountered in his life. He wasn’t at all confident of resisting the following attack.

It was mind boggling to consider that the attack had been launched by someone in the Fate State!

Su Ping became solemn when he saw the horrifying spear. Vortices trembled inside his body, and infinite astral power flowed in his veins like rivers, making him much stronger than before.

“You have a constitution, and so do I!”

Su Ping’s eyes became completely black; the sclera was also replaced by darkness.

He had rarely used his constitution in the real world, but he decided to do so this time. It was the divine constitution invoked after he passed the tests in the Golden Crows’ world, known as the Sorcerer’s Divine Constitution!

Sorcerers had been the dominators of the world during primordial times!

The rays of light around him were gone after Su Ping activated his constitution; infinite darkness surged from the void. The rays were not swallowed, but drowned in the flood because they had no time to escape.

“A constitution!”

“Is it a demonic constitution? No, what a horrifying aura!”

“It’s indeed a demonic constitution, too scary in fact!”

“3700 demonic constitutions are recorded in the Federation, and only 22 are considered the best. I think this is one of the best demonic constitutions!”

“He disappeared in the nothingness and can’t be detected any longer. What a weird constitution!”

All the people outside the battlefield were astonished by such development.

Divine constitutions were the best of all. There were 700 different types of divine constitutions in the Federation, while nine of them were the best overall!

People with any of the nine constitutions were seen as super geniuses in the entire universe!

Then, there were the demonic constitutions. There were more than three thousand kinds of them, and 22 kinds were the best!

Down below were the elemental constitutions, which included tens of thousands of kinds.

Although Su Ping’s constitution was not a divine one, it seemed as intimidating as the purple-robed young man’s!

If it were one of the best demonic constitutions... It would easily crush the normal divine constitutions!

Sword Technique: Hell of Four Dimensions!

Su Ping took out the Little Skeleton’s bone saber.

His own sword had already lost the power of laws. Although made of hard materials, it was clearly not as good as the purple-robed young man’s chains and would probably be shattered with ease.

But the bone saber was different. It was made from the remains of a massive fang which would have belonged to an indescribable creature in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. It had existed for countless years; Su Ping had never seen anything harder than that.

God of Lightning, Boom, Annihilation and Cutting, the four laws were all compressed on the saber, which was ablaze in brilliant light.

“Break now!”

Su Ping rose to the sky and roared while carrying infinite darkness; he then went against the brilliant spear like a devil from hell.

He waved his saber!

The entire world was silent. Given the accelerated attack, the saber aura was unbelievably fast, almost appearing like lightning.

The man who had launched the Lightning Wave Saber earlier widened his eyes when he saw Su Ping’s attack.

He didn’t know how Su Ping had achieved it, but that moment of super acceleration was exactly what he had used in the Lightning Wave Saber.

Looking at the devilish Su Ping, the purple-robed young man was infuriated. He then roared, “You merely have a demonic constitution. Break now!”

His divine spear came piercing down from the skies, as if it were about to rip apart the small world!

If the spear ever stabbed a planet, it could have pierced it through!

After a boom, a saber aura covered the world. All sound was lost at the moment of collision. Then, horrifying sonic waves and blasts were spread out.

The earth was shaking, and a sandstorm was raging.

The brilliant spear was shattered and reduced to chains. The chains were then dispersed. Some fell to the ground, leaving pits hundreds of meters deep, and some were flung far back into the sky, to later disappear.
