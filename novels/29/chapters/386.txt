Chapter 387 Arrival

Under Tang Ruyan’s guidance, the customers went into the store one by one.

Su Ping opened his notebook and wrote down the customers’ information as usual.

The customers who were discussing excitedly about the store... They became as mute as fish out of fear saw when they saw Su Ping behind the counter.

After the things that happened in the finals, Su Ping’s video had gone viral on the internet and his face was known to everyone. There was no mistake. This was the guy who killed three titled battle pet warriors!

The new customers were shocked into silence and some recurrent customers were a bit nervous as well. They had seen Su Ping many times but they didn’t think much about him in the past. Things had changed after that day. Su Ping was a horrifying guy who could kill titled battle pet warriors. Whichever rank he was at, his strength had proven to be powerful. He should be held as an equal to the titled battle pet warriors.

Silence fell in the store.

Everyone was standing in line and no one talked, not even in whispers.

Every business deal was carried out in silence.

Su Ping could tell that things were a bit weird but there was nothing he could do. He didn’t make any comments to that and kept on noting down information as usual.

All of a sudden, Su Ping felt he might have instilled too much fear when he noticed how stressed out the customers were. Even so, there was nothing he could say.

Soon, the customers left the store one by one.

Some customers required their advanced pets to be trained and yet Su Ping had to politely reject them. He would become even more anxious every time a person asked for that service; he was eager to add that service in the store.

The day’s business deals were efficient since everyone stood quietly as they waited. In merely two hours, Joanna went to inform Su Ping that all the spots had been taken.

Su Ping checked the income of the day. Indeed, the amount of money indicated that no more places were available. He told the customers that business was over for the day, but they could return the next day.

The customers at the back of the line were unhappy that the store was closing this soon. Still no one said anything since they remembered what Su Ping did the other day. They heaved a sigh and left.

Some repeated customers had become used to this business pattern. The new customers, on the other hand, were surprised that a store would turn down any money-making business. After he closed the doors, Su Ping found a whiteboard and wrote down how many pets he could receive every day and the business hours. But, he wiped the business hours away. He had to go to a cultivation site to cultivate and train the pets. Sometimes, he had to stay longer, and sometimes, he could come back early.

He couldn’t say a specific time unless he opened the door in the afternoon from then on.

After all, no matter how late he had to stay in the cultivation site, he would always return in the afternoon the next day.

He placed the whiteboard outside and went back in to put away his notebook. It was noon. He wondered about what to do for lunch.

Someone else entered the store while he was thinking about lunch. “Brother Su.”

It was Venerable the Blade.

Venerable the Blade was dressed weirdly. He put on was a custom-made plaid shirt, a vintage peaked cap, and a pair of ripped jeans. This should be the outfit for a fashion icon.

Su Ping was surprised by this outfit which didn’t seem to be Venerable the Blade’s style.

“Where’s your skeleton?”

Venerable the Blade Leng Yingjun asked about Su Ping’s battle pet as soon as he came into the door. He was more interested in the skeleton than in Su Ping.

Su Ping had guessed that Venerable the Blade was there to teach the Little Skeleton. However, in the Demigod Burial, the Little Skeleton had learned better saber skills. After all, the Little Skeleton’s weakest teacher in the Demigod Burial was at the legendary rank and sometimes at the Celestial God Realm. He no longer needed Venerable the Blade as the teacher.

“It is resting,” Su Ping said. He didn’t take the Little Skeleton to the cultivation site with him in the recent outings. The Little Skeleton should have almost digested the bloodline of the Skeleton King by then.

He supposed that the Little Skeleton would finish it during the next couple of days, and it would possess the bloodline of a Skeleton King.

As such, the Little Skeleton’s aptitude rating would drop a bit more. Venerable the Blade smiled. “I saw many people outside. You had a good day at the store today.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“True. The Elite League has just ended. I did some promotion.”

“Brother Su, you have a very acute business sense.”

“Uh-huh. Have you had lunch yet?”

“Not yet.”

“Come and have lunch with me.” “Sure.”

Su Ping invited Venerable the Blade to join him for lunch back at home.

Su Ping grabbed Tang Ruyan as well.

Tang Ruyan was zoning out.

Venerable the Blade?

She was confused.

She never thought she could see such a big potato in Su Ping’s store.

Venerable the Blade had visited several times but Tang Ruyan had usually been in the scroll, so she had never seen him pay a visit. However, she had seen him in the Mysterious Realm. She had learned about Venerable the Blade even before she went to the Mysterious Realm. Venerable the Blade was a titled battle pet warrior who was famous across the entire Subcontinent District!

The Tang Family had even thought about recruiting him at a huge cost. But since Venerable the Blade was working for a legendary battle pet warrior, the Tang Family had to give up.

Having come back to her senses, Tang Ruyan could not help but ask gingerly, “You... are you Mr. Leng?”

Venerable the Blade looked at her. Few people knew about his surname. As an important person, his information was classified and was not a search away on the internet.

“You look a bit familiar. Are you from the Tang Family?” Venerable the Blade soon recognized her.

The future family head of the Tang Family was in Su Ping’s store?

Was there some connection between Su Ping and the Tang Family?

“Yes!”

Tang Ruyan was so excited that she teared up. “Venerable the Blade, can you please take me away?” she asked in a hurry.

“Take you away?” Venerable the Blade was baffled.

Tang Ruyan stepped to Venerable the Blade so that Su Ping couldn’t hear her. “Sir, he’s keeping me imprisoned here. Can you take me back to the Tangs? We will reward you greatly!”

Venerable the Blade was even more puzzled. Imprisoned? He turned around, only to see that Su Ping did not seem to be worried at all, which only added to his puzzlement. This guy is holding her captive? The future family head of the Tang Family? Why could she openly stay in the store if this was imprisonment? “Sorry...”

Venerable the Blade turned her down.

Tang Ruyan was not surprised. She remembered when Venerable the Blade and Su Ping were talking. Tang Ruyan turned a bit pale once she realized that the two seemed to be quite close. “Venerable the Blade, I promise you that the Tang Family will forget any past misdeeds as long as you can take me away. I promise!”

Venerable the Blade replied with a forced smile. What could the Tang Family do? Even Yuan Tianchen had almost lost his life there. Your Tang Family would only seek trouble for themselves.

Besides, he seemed to be a free man but he was also imprisoned by Su Ping in a way, because he had to go and teach the skeleton every week.

It was just that he was enjoying the teaching so he no longer viewed it as imprisonment.

“I really cannot do that. I think you should beg Brother Su,” Venerable the Blade said.

Tang Ruyan was stunned still.

She had exposed her identity and Venerable the Blade was still taking Su Ping’s side. Was she less important than Su Ping?!

Or, the two were closer than she had thought.

Frustrated, Tang Ruyan turned to Su Ping.

He looked at her from the corner of his eye. “You must have enough strength to say that many words. You don’t have to come to lunch. Stay here.”

With that said, he put away his notebook and said to Venerable the Blade, “Let’s go.”

Tang Ruyan was speechless.

How could she know that asking for help would cost her lunch...

“No wonder that guy is always fearless. Turns out he has found himself a sugar daddy.” Tang Ruyan filed her teeth as the two stepped away.

Su Ping slammed the door shut and locked Tang Ruyan inside.

Outside the store, Su Ping saw many people lingering close by. They were all from different media. Su Ping frowned but said nothing to the media. He and Venerable the Blade walked away.

The media wanted to interview Su Ping but were afraid to do so. Su Ping had already left while they were still hesitating.

Back home.

Su Ping told his mom to cook some extra dishes.

Li Qingru was happy to have guests.

Su Ping saw that Wu Guansheng was there as well, teaching Su Lingyue about healing skills. Venerable the Blade saw Wu Guansheng as well. A glint of bitterness flashed past the former’s eyes.

Wu Guansheng remembered the deal between Venerable the Blade and Su Ping as well.

The two of them exchanged some small talks. Lunch was ready. Su Ping told them to wash their hands and sit down for lunch.

Su Ping casually introduced Venerable the Blade to his mother but skipped mentioning the title. He simply used his name, Leng Yingjun.

Li Qingru regarded this fashionable Mr. Leng as a model. After all, Venerable the Blade was fit.

Li Qingru’s misunderstanding almost made Wu Guansheng choke on his food.

As they were approaching the end of their lunch, they heard a noise coming from outside.

A gust of wind was swept across the street.

Su Ping picked up some food and held his bowl while he went outside. At the door, he saw a shadow cast onto the street by a huge bird hovering in the sky.
