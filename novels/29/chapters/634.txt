Chapter 636 Peak of the Titled Rank

Su Ping was speechless.

Of course he knew that.

If the wild beasts could get there, it would mean that the Longjiang Base City would have collapsed.

Still, the store would be the last line of defense!

“Anyway, even if the end of the world is upon us, just stay here,” Su Ping repeated solemnly.

“Don’t worry. Your mom and I won’t go anywhere,” Su Yuanshan said, “Where are you going? The situation outside is very bad. I heard you have legendary rank combat strength, but with greater strength comes a greater responsibility. You must take care of yourself.”

“I understand.” Su Ping felt a surge of warmth spread in his heart. “I’m just going to do something that is my duty.”

Su Yuanshan nodded. “Good.”

Li Qingru yanked Su Ping’s sleeve and whispered, “I heard that those big families across the street are going to help the other base cities. Are you also going? Isn’t that too dangerous? I know you’re a good battle pet warrior, son, better than anyone else, but you’re not undefeatable. Don’t go anywhere. Stay here!”

She was almost begging.

Su Ping understood that his mom didn’t want him to take risks. He patted the back of her hand to comfort her. “Don’t worry. I won’t let anything happen to me.” Li Qingru was still worried but Su Yuanshan stopped her. “Our son knows what he is doing. Let’s not bother him.”

Li Qingru glared at her husband but eventually decided not to argue at the moment. “Anyway, I just want you to be safe!” she said to Su Ping.

Su Ping smiled.

Before leaving, Su Ping said to Zhong Lingtong, “Stay here and take care of my parents. Don’t go anywhere.” Zhong Lingtong wasn’t happy to see him leave that soon. “Sir, I...”

“Be a good girl!”

Su Ping patted her head and cut off the remaining part of her sentence.

His parents and Zhong Lingtong watched as Su Ping left the house. They felt that Su Ping was too far away from them...

Su Ping went back to his store and saw that the five families were still gathered in a meeting.

He wanted to lend a helping hand but he couldn’t split himself. He had to save the Little Skeleton.

He closed the door; he didn’t want to open the store to the public. He was going to use the materials he had brought for the second level of the Solar Bulwark. Finding the Little Skeleton was the priority; Su Ping believed he could deal with the ensuing crisis with the Little Skeleton.

His visit to the Golden Crows’ star had been a rewarding and vision-broadening trip. However, he had not become contemptuous of the Blue Planet’s conditions. The vastness of the Celestial Star and the powers of the Golden Crows were too distant from him. The Blue Planet was the place he had to focus on.

The Deep Caves... Su Ping had not reached the deepest level yet. He didn’t know what could be hiding inside.

Besides, the four Heavenly Kings could not be ignored.

“Has something happened?” Joanna asked after Su Ping returned.

Su Ping nodded. “I’m going to cultivate for a bit.” He was heading to the test room.

“Cultivate?”

Joanna raised her eyebrows. “Right after you came back?”

She sized him up and down. “I think the place you visited this time has benefited you...”

Su Ping nodded.

Without further ado, Su Ping went to the test room.

He took out the materials from his storage space.

Su Ping felt a surge of energy merely by being in front of those materials. The trip had indeed been fruitful. He agreed with Joanna.

He had already reached the upper position of the titled rank!

One step away from the peak!

His physical strength had increased, which could be seen from the first round of the trial.

Even without merging with the Little Skeleton, Su Ping was able to muster a combat strength close to the Fate State. He had not tried to use the Sword of the Void to confront any foes, but he could ascertain that it wouldn’t be a weak skill.

“Pal, wait for me...”

Su Ping took a deep breath and closed his eyes. The method to cultivate the Solar Bulwark appeared in his mind.

Whoosh!

Golden flames rose around him, burning the newly-changed clothes to ash. The flames didn’t hurt Su Ping. On his back, strands of golden light were shot out from the depths of his pores, faintly forming the figure of a Golden Crow; it was in a soaring posture as it reached the skies.

Su Ping lifted his hand and took the materials which had been refined by the golden flames. The impurities were discarded, leaving behind only the pure energy liquid. The energetic fluid flew into Su Ping.

He was increasing in momentum as he applied those materials.

Cry!!

Su Ping felt as if he had fallen into a trance and sucked into an ancient world when he absorbed the last material.

There was no sky, nor ground, nor stars. It was just chaos.

Still, there was a cry that had cut open through the chaos.

The cry was getting clearer and clearer, echoing in Su Ping’s mind. His cells and astral powers were vibrating along with the rhythms of that cry.

The filth hiding in the depths of his pores were being sifted.

In a daze, Su Ping thought he had seen a ray of golden light in front of his eyes.

Boom!

Su Ping felt that something had broken through his mind’s limit; immediately afterwards, his body suddenly broke free from that previous feeling of fullness as unprecedented violent energy gushed out of his body.

Cry!!

Su Ping opened his mouth and cried like a Golden Crow.

That sharp and sonorous cry echoed in the test room.

Su Ping opened his eyes and golden flames were burning inside them. He was covered in golden flames and a virtual Golden Crow appeared behind him. The image was almost intangible; one could barely see the three feet of the Golden Crow. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Su Ping felt a surge of unknown energy as it filled his limbs.

He was powerful! Invincible!

Su Ping felt he could pick the stars and crush the moon.

“Golden Crow Flames!”

Su Ping lifted his hand. A ball of golden flames appeared in his palm. The flames were twisting the air, leaving behind smoke-like dark marks. But the fact was that the space was cracking.

Golden Crow Flames, a terrifying inherent skill of the Golden Crows.

Beside the addition of the new skill, Su Ping felt his muscles had tightened. He made a move... In a blur, he had appeared by the other side of the test room and then he punched the wall!

Bang!

The wall was shaking. Those outside couldn’t feel the area shake but the feeling was clear inside.

“I have... reached the peak.”

e....

Su Ping stopped. He noticed he had reached the peak of the titled rank!

One step away from the legendary rank! “I wonder if I can fight a Fate State creature without the help of my battle pets,” Su Ping asked himself.

He had only been able to do so by merging with the Little Skeleton. He would have had to run for his life if the Fate State creature was exceptionally strong. However, the trial undergone with the Golden Crows and the Solar Bulwark’s second level had boosted Su Ping’s confidence. He had still not fought against a Fate State creature, but he was convinced he was a good contender, just like when he merged with the Little Skeleton.

He would only be stronger if he merged!

I am coming for you! Su Ping’s eyes glowed. The virtual Golden Crow vanished behind him. Moments after, a dark figure appeared and it looked just like Su Ping. That was Su Ping’s divine body.

There was a glint of coldness in the divine body’s eyes. The divine body gradually became one with Su Ping.

Whoosh!

Su Ping turned around. He reached the door in an instant and went out of the test room.
