Chapter 276 Venue at the Crescent Zone

Since the Gun Control Zone was far away, Su Ping didn’t even consider it.

The Crescent Zone was a bit closer but it was still some distance away. The round trip would take at least half a day.

On the day of the game, there were few customers outside Su Ping’s store. Those present were hard-core fans of the dragon, waiting eagerly for Su Ping to release it.

Su Ping didn’t plan on running his store on that day. Two days before the official start of the competition and business had dropped considerably. He looked up information about Primo, and it was the same for them.

As for the other pet stores, they were worse off. They were basically deserted.

Given the current situation, this was not because Primo conjured up some sabotaging plans. Therefore, Su Ping stopped worrying.

The day prior, merely a dozen people had shown up in Su Ping’s store.

The service prices in his store were high. Even for general training, the charge was one hundred thousand per round, which was several times higher than the prices at Primo. Some people wanted to return but they lacked the money.

Those passersby that had never gone into the store were scared away by the whopping price. Besides, since the competition was approaching, making efforts at the moment would be too late.

They never thought it was possible to achieve any progress by relying on one pet store for a day or two.

Training took time. It wasn’t like the pets could grow just because they took a lesson.

As such, most people chose to go to battle stadiums to train, which would give them more confidence.

“Let’s go. I’ll give you a ride today.”

Early in the morning, Su Ping locked the door and told Joanna, who couldn’t leave the store, to stay inside and spend time with some pets or to go back to the nursing pen.

As for Tang Ruyan, Su Ping kept her inside the scroll lest she would squabble with Joanna.

Tang Ruyan was naturally unable to defeat Joanna. However, on the off chance that she enraged Joanna and got herself killed, Su Ping would lose a perfectly fine, dedicated temporary employee for his store.

Su Lingyue was surprised that Su Ping was closing the door and did not plan on taking any business. She knew that Su Ping could pocket tens of millions a day; even when business was slow those last couple of days, he could easily make millions daily.

Was he giving up on money?

She felt sorry for him and her. The store was Su Ping’s but he was her older brother. So, what was his was also hers. “I can go by myself. I’m not a kid. You don’t have to drop me off,” she argued.

“That’s not up to you to decide.”

Su Ping sounded impatient. “Do you think I want to waste time on this? You are the upcoming champion. Countless people have their eyes on you. Primo has been quiet recently, but since the game is beginning, they will be up to something behind our backs.

“If they kidnapped you, knocked you out, and carried you away so you missed the primary match, how do you suppose I can keep the store running?”

Su Lingyue was still a student and a green hand in the Elite League. Only then did she realize the gravity of this matter. She shuddered with fear at the thought of such a possibility. Law was not closely enforced nor followed in the shantytown area. There were some roads without surveillance cameras.

Even surveillance cameras wouldn’t help much. For Primo’s powerful reach, surveillance cameras could not hinder them at all.

“I understand.”

Su Lingyue nodded. She began to take this matter more seriously.

Su Ping went to the street where a car was parked. Wu Guansheng had stayed late for the lesson the night before. At dinner time, Su Ping told Wu Guansheng to prepare a car for him and it arrived at night.

It was an explorer’s car with the best set-up, which was bullet and shock-proof. Not even rocket shells could blast the car open.

“Let’s go,” Su Ping shouted to Su Lingyue.

She got in as requested.

Su Ping fumbled around the steering wheel for a long time before he found where to insert the key. It was very well hidden.

Su Lingyue got nervous right away. Even finding where to insert the key took him such a long time? Was he serious?

“Do you know how to drive? I think you haven’t even taken driving lessons to get your license.” Su Lingyue was stressed out.

Su Ping didn’t seem to be bothered. “It is just driving. I am experienced in this. A driving license does not matter.”

All of a sudden, Su Lingyue felt having Su Ping go with her was more dangerous than her traveling alone.

“We can call a cab, you know?” “Sit tight. Here we go!”

Su Ping hit the gas without saying anything else.

The car dashed out.

Su Lingyue fastened her seatbelt at once.

When they reached the place where their family stayed, Su Ping stopped the car, rolled the window down, and shouted to their mom.

Soon, Li Qingru hurried out and said to her two children in the car, “I’m glad that you’re giving your sister a ride. I will worry less.”

Li Qingru knew that Su Lingyue was participating but not the fact that she was going to be made the champion. After all, Li Qingru would rarely search the internet, and to avoid making her worry, Su Ping told Su Lingyue to keep it a secret from Li Qingru.

“Mom...” Su Pingyue wished to speak but stopped on second thought.

“Drive safely and listen to your brother.” Li Qingru smiled.

“Mom, stay at home and don’t go out if not necessary. Just watch TV or you will miss her match,” Su Ping told her.

“I know. You don’t have to tell me.” Li Qingru laughed.

Su Ping said bye and rushed away.

Shocked by how fast Su Ping drove, Li Qingru shouted, “Aiee, slow down...!” The car had already vanished from view. Li Qingru heaved a sigh. “Oh my, I can never stop worrying about them....”

The Crescent Zone.

This was the rich zone in the shantytown; its prosperity could be sensed from the cleanliness and by how well the roads had been built.

Many luxury cars were traveling on the road. Su Ping meandered through the traffic and followed the navigation cues to the branch venue for the initial match.

“So many people?”

The huge number of luxury cars crowding the road stunned Su Lingyue. They were all traveling in the same direction: the venue. They were either participants or spectators.

Su Ping nodded. He could sense how excited people were about this grand event.

It would usually be a two-hour drive, but it took him four hours this time. Luckily, Su Ping left early so they made it to the main pathway.

Su Ping was relieved since no one had stopped them on the way. That being said, if not on the way, then the plan to sabotage them would certainly happen at the venue. He wondered if Primo would set up the trap there or after the first match. Soon, Su Ping parked his car.

The road was jammed. He couldn’t move another inch.

They got off and marveled at the sea of people. This was just the starting match of one zone, and yet, quite a lot of people had shown up. Wouldn’t it be more exaggerated when it came to the latter round and the final match? Someone shouted, “Move, move!

“Get out of the way! My son is a sixth rank battle pet warrior. He will most certainly get into the Top 1000. Do not get in his way. You cannot afford it!”

Su Ping turned around, only to see the crowd parting to clean up a path for someone.

A middle-aged man that appeared to be an overnight millionaire with a golden necklace on his neck and a designer’s watch on his wrist was exploring the way with a chubby middle-aged woman accompanying him.

Following them was a skinny young man with rosy cheeks. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“He’s a sixth-rank battle pet warrior?” Su Lingyue was taken aback. She didn’t expect that a random person she had met here was someone two ranks above her.

Su Ping took one glance and looked away. He didn’t seem to be concerned. “Nothing strange. I can tell that he just reached this rank because of some potions and materials. I suppose he has never visited the barren area. The only battle experience he has is limited to training in a battle stadium, which is of no use.”

Su Lingyue could tell that this young man lacked the ferocity that she would find in the explorers hunting in the barren area. All of the explorers had sharp eyes like wolves.

That chubby middle-aged woman bedecked with jewels shouted to Su Ping and Su Lingyue, “You, kid, make way.” Su Lingyue was just about to step to the side when Su Ping grabbed her shoulder and leaped up into the air. He was flying her to the venue.

When could they arrive if they had to push their way through the crowd?
