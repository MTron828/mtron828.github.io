Chapter 1336 Primordial Taboo (1)

“Brother Su’s power is beyond our understanding,” remarked Chi Huo, then asked curiously, “Brother Su, can you tell us how confident you are to deal with other Celestials with your current strength?”

Everyone turned to look at Su Ping; they were rather concerned about their current problem.

“Celestials are not a problem for me, no matter how many gang up on me, unless their number reaches the three digits,” said Su Ping subtly. After all, the ones present were allies. He didn’t have to be too blunt about it.

“Not a problem?”

“Three digits…”

They all looked at him in shock; his claim was unbelievable. Is it possible that he’s already strong enough to belittle the Celestial State? Could he compare to a universe dominator?

Noticing their appalled faces, Su Ping knew they misunderstood him, so he quickly explained, “But I would be forced to run if I encountered a universe dominator; my strength is still stuck in the Celestial State range.”

They were speechless; Su Ping’s explanation wasn’t convincing in the slightest. He was implying that he could crush any Celestial. He had to be almost as strong as a universe dominator.

He’s already this strong even though he’s merely an Ascendant… They found it hard to imagine how unbelievable Su Ping would become when he reached the Celestial State or continued to become a universe dominator.

Could it be that everybody who knows more about the final destination of all cultivation is as talented as him?

Kayafollet remained silent; she didn’t question what Su Ping said. He had killed her master and suppressed her. This time as they interacted once more she clearly realized that he was more terrifying than before.

Su Ping opened his universe of chaos and ushered Kayafollet. “Get in.”

......

Kayafollet sobered up and frowned. “Don’t you want me to participate in the war?”

Su Ping said coldly, “We’re not in a rush. Come here.”

Noticing his hostile demeanor toward her, Kayafollet didn’t press further, lest she was slapped again, which was more insulting than hurtful.

“Guys, I’m heading back. This place is yours,” said Su Ping to the rest of them. He didn’t want to waste any time, given the urgent situation.

“Okay.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They didn’t ask him to stay. Time was precious for a genius like Su Ping.

Su Ping returned to the store after saying goodbye. He saw that Joanna and Green Lady were registering more pets for training. He nodded and said to them, “Thank you for your hard work. Are there any pets for professional training? I’ll be working on that now.”

“Yes.” Joanna looked at Su Ping. “You just came back; are you leaving again?” “War is getting closer; I have to make the most of it and cultivate while I can. I can also increase our customers’ combat ability by training their pets; this will improve our overall strength,” said Su Ping. Joanna was aware of the situation since she had overheard their customers talking as they waited in line. Although she couldn’t leave the store, she had learned something. She directly asked, “Do you want me to go with you?”

“That won’t be necessary. I will take you next time and talk to Heather about their homecoming,” said Su Ping.

Joanna understood. She nodded and gave the pet list waiting for professional training to Su Ping.

He took a glance and picked those pets in the pet room.

He only picked Ascendant pets. His permission to train Ascendant pets had been unlocked after the Purple Python broke through and became an Ascendant. The reward for the professional training of an Ascendant pet was abundant. Training a few more would allow him to upgrade his store again.

Once he picked the pets, Su Ping took the sutra old man and the cauldron woman with him as his equipment to the cultivation site. Being his items, they could also be resurrected; only some energy had to be spent each time.

Su Ping returned to the Archean Divinity.

He was teleported to the sky above a prosperous city. Below him were buildings made with unique styles. A lot of massive white rocks had been used to make walls. Many airships were flying in the sky carrying gods of other places.

Su Ping simply took out the Dao Child’s badge and communicated with it; he soon teleported back to the Heaven Path Institute through it.

Indeed, it’s much more convenient than before.

Su Ping returned to his place on his own mountain. He was surrounded by abundant divine power; it was almost like breathing a sticky substance.

He took out the customers’ pets and asked the maid to take care of them while they cultivated.

The local environment was greatly beneficial for the pets and could improve their potential slightly; they could become powerful pets with minor training.

-However, to attain the best potential from professional training, Su Ping would have to put a lot of thought into it.

Su Ping ignored the pets and went straight to Elder Chan’s Toad Fish Palace.

The nearby disciples quickly bowed after noticing Su Ping’s arrival. Once he declared the purpose of the visit, they allowed him in.

“Why are you here? Did you encounter a problem during your cultivation?” Elder Chan was still dressed like a casual young man, but his eyes showed the passage of time. He noticed Su Ping the moment he arrived.

“Elder Chan, are you aware of the Heavens’ existence?” Su Ping was straightforward when he asked.

He intended to find answers in regards to the information he acquired from the Golden Crows.

“The Heavens?”

Elder Chan changed his expression; his casual face was gone, and his eyes became deep and dark. He unleashed his power to set up secret barriers around them; then, he gazed at Su Ping and said, “Where did you hear that name? You must not mention them directly, or there will be a disaster!”
