Chapter 1110 What Do You Think?

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

“Calivey! Brian!”

“It’s them.”

“They’re cooperating.”

Everybody fixed their eyes upon Calivey and Brian, who had been famous Star Lords for years. Even though they secretly took part in the trial, the news still leaked. All the people present were vigilant of them.

Qing Hongyue and Claudia looked at each other, both realizing what they should do.

Cooperating was the better choice.

They first had to finish off Calivey and Brian first.

To think they were still fighting and trying to kill each other a second before—

But the next second, they quickly decided to cooperate.

They immediately relayed the plan to their subordinates. Then, Qing Hongyue said telepathically, “I’ll take care of Calivey; you’ll take care of Brian. How does it sound?”

“Okay.”

Claudia gave a slight nod.

Brian was once known as Emperor Brian. He was a famous Star Lord, but she wasn’t scared of him.

She was known as the Queen of Time.

She once heard that Brian had perfectly grasped the law of time too. Some even tried to compare them, but she thought the comparison was demeaning.

Is there anything remarkable about the perfect law of time?

There weren’t many Star Lords who were as strong as him, but he wasn’t unique. She was the only one known as the Queen of Time; she was much stronger than those who had mastered the perfect law of time.

“Let’s get this over with as quickly as possible!”

They wasted no time attacking once they picked their respective opponents.

Since their battle had attracted Calivey and Brian, it might attract others too; they shouldn’t stay there for too long.

Even though they weren’t afraid of the leaders of other star zones, they didn’t want to be taken advantage of.

“Indeed. The best solution to solve a conflict is to find a mutual enemy for the parties involved.” Brian looked at the two women who were charging at him and smiled.

Calivey glanced at him. “They seem to already be set on who to attack. Can you tackle them both?”

“I don’t think so, unless Brother Su is willing to lend an ultimate treasure to me,” said Brian.

Su Ping had taken possession of their ultimate treasures. He’d be fearless if he still had his ultimate treasure.

“That’s unnecessary.”

Su Ping said, “You’re both wounded; let me take care of them. Just deal with the rest.”

Both Calivey and Brian heaved a sigh; they were hoping to seize the opportunity and get their treasures back. Alas, it was clear that Su Ping wasn’t that stupid.

As for their wounds… They were indeed in need of recovery.

But wasn’t it your doing?

Both were at a loss for words, so they remained silent after that. They were looking forward to seeing Su Ping’s small worlds in action, hoping to observe them several times more and do their best to understand their

mysteries.

“Die!!”

Qing Hongyue waved her hand. Dozens of top Star Lords under her command charged at Calivey’s subordinates.

Qing Hongyue simply charged at Calivey. She had black hair and fair skin; a classic beauty that seemed to have just walked out of a painting.

“Calivey, I’ve heard so much about you. Let me see if your star zone has been bragging about you with good reason,” roared Qing Hongyue.

Calivey pursed her lips; she wouldn’t have held back after such an affront if Su Ping hadn’t taken her ultimate treasure.

“Your opponent is me.”

Su Ping stepped up and stood in front of Qing Hongyue.

Qing Hongyue was dazed for a moment, seeing that Su Ping was only a Star State warrior. She obviously didn’t expect that anyone with such a low cultivation would be able to sneak into the core area of the central

continent.

She simply yelled at him without a whiff of politeness. “Where is this brat from? Get the hell out of here!”

Su Ping’s reply was a punch.

A dazzling divine power burst out in an instant; his punch caused the stones near the hill to crumble.

Qing Hongyue was shocked; she changed her expression. Su Ping’s punch was mixed with the laws of chaos and fire. His fist aura was like a burning meteor when seen from a distance.

“What the hell?”

Qing Hongyue moved quickly and punched back. The entire void seemed to be lifted by her fist; it blocked Su Ping’s fist with an unstoppable power.

Even so, she was greatly astounded. The Star State brat mastered two perfect laws?

“It’s not over.”

Su Ping’s eyes unleashed a dazzling coldness like stars in the sky.

He condensed a divine sword and slashed forth.

This time, he directly tapped on the power from his two small worlds. The explosive power in his arm was enough to shatter a special-grade planet into smithereens.

Qing Hongyue narrowed her pupils in shock, but she didn’t step back; her heart was filled with fury. This Star State guy is trying to suppress me?

No way!

After a boom, she activated her constitution and punched upwards.

But the next moment, her hand was cut and bleeding heavily. The overpowering sword attack connected; Qing Hongyue’s body fell quickly and crashed into the hill down below, making it collapse and leveling the area.

The scene came as a shock to all the volunteers fighting for Qing Hongyue and Claudia. They found it hard to believe.

They had experienced Qing Hongyue’s power in previous battles. The woman had mastered two perfect supreme laws and a dozen other perfect paths; she had also combined their traits to a virtually seamless level.

She was almost invincible as a Star Lord!

And yet, she had just been suppressed!

Boom!

A loud noise came from the ground. Qing Hongyue, unleashed a scorching light while shrouded in fierce flames. A pair of vivid phoenix wings unfolded behind her back; she had a special mutated constitution only

recorded in her family.

The constitution was related to an ancient and extremely powerful phoenix. She had been able to grasp the perfect path of fire when she activated some of its potential.

Once she broke through and became an Ascendant, she would even be able to acquire the ancient Phoenix Blood Divine Mark from her bloodline, allowing her to easily become a Heavenly Lord!

However, she didn’t want to become a normal Heavenly Lord!

She was determined to become the strongest Heavenly Lord, one that could even trouble Celestials!

That was also the reason why she had cultivated for 90,000 years without advancing to the Ascendant State.

Not even the Ascendants in the outside world could do anything about her, considering the secret treasures that the forces backing him provided. Only Heavenly Lords would have a chance to kill her.

Ascendant power was banned during the trial; many of her secret treasures couldn’t be used. Still, she was one of the strongest warriors!

“You’ve made me angry!”

Qing Hongyue’s phoenix-like eyes were filled with fury. She opened her hand, revealing an ultimate treasure that looked like a brilliant phoenix feather.

The entire void was immediately set ablaze as she waved her hand.

The path of fire? No, this is Ascendant State power!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes at first. The environment was so hot he felt like he was burning in an ocean of flames; his body was in excruciating pain because of the heat.

Still, he didn’t even bat an eye; he was already used to a pain ten times stronger.

Qing Hongyue thought that her ultimate treasure didn’t work on him, seeing his expression. However, her senses detected that Su Ping’s body was burning.

Does this guy not feel any pain? It’s not just physical pain; the fire also burns his soul at the same time. That is, unless he has an extraordinary willpower… Qing Hongyue was shocked and suspicious.

Su Ping activated the golden flag exactly at that moment.

The golden flag quickly passed through the blockage of laws and tied up Qing Hongyue’s red feather.

The artifact had been tailor-made by Qing Hongyue’s Celestial backer. She was the only one who could fully bring out its power; it would be awfully ineffective even if others claimed it, and not even as good as some

top Star Lord weapons.

The golden flag was at the moment tightly ensnaring the red feather.

The scorching power was quickly dispersed.

“An ultimate treasure?”

Everybody was stunned.

Nobody expected the Star State kid to be holding an ultimate treasure.

Could it be that he’s the leader of his star zone? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

So to speak, he was in partnership with Calivey and Brian!

Su Ping charged at Qing Hongyue again, before everybody figured out what was going on.

Qing Hongyue slightly changed her expression. She was surprised to look at Su Ping taking out an ultimate treasure, and even more surprised since it could tie her own. She believed that, given enough time, her

ultimate treasure could burn the golden flag; Su Ping didn’t seem to be cutting her some slack.

“You think that’s my only ultimate treasure?”

Qing Hongyue flipped her hand and a blue ball appeared; it was round, like a ball of water.

Soon after, the ball covered her body through her fingers, turning into a blue shield.

She had obviously gotten the treasure from someone else, all because her ultimate treasure is fiery; she was able to kill that guy and loot the ultimate treasure.

“You think that’s my only ultimate treasure?”

Su Ping repeated exactly what she said while approaching quickly, stunning Qing Hongyue.

The next moment, a battle axe appeared in Su Ping’s hand!

The battle axe was filled with a wild and violent power; its shape suggested that it was a highly destructive, yet ultimate treasure!

Qing Hongyue immediately changed her expression.

Has this Star State brat killed the leaders of the other star zones?

One ultimate treasure represented a star zone!

All the others were dumbfounded. Nobody considered Su Ping a big deal in the past, even if they recognized him. They admitted that Su Ping was indeed talented, but that didn’t mean he was qualified to take part in

the trial.

Once trying to get to the bottom of it, Su Ping was still too young.

Those who were qualified to compete were all top Star Lords who have cultivated for tens of thousands of years!

“Destruction!” Su Ping roared, suddenly activating the Ascendant power on the battle axe. A stream of power was swept out, which exceeded the destruction law’s power; such a strike was impossible to resist without

an ultimate treasure!

Qing Hongyue also changed her expression; she was rather shocked and infuriated.

She stood her ground, and unleashed her strength to charge at Su Ping.

It was her belief that her ultimate treasure could block the strike, but she wouldn’t give Su Ping the opportunity to try.

Scorching flames seemed to be drowning the sky. A small world surfaced behind Qing Hongyue’s back. It was her ‘real’ small world; the power of laws and faith contained were then transferred to her body. A burning

long spear appeared in her hand; she suddenly made a stabbing motion toward Su Ping.

“You think those are the only ultimate treasures I have?” asked Su Ping again.

The next moment, the shield appeared and shrouded his body..
