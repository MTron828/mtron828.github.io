Chapter 780: Giving In

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

In the mysterious realm of the Ryan family.

O’Neil was rather stunned after hearing the news.

There were two Star State warriors? Not just one?

The other person seemed to be at the peak of the rank?

Two Star State people were doing business together? Is that supposed to be a joke?

What intimidated O’Neil even more was that someone even stronger might be behind that powerful pair. Say, several Star Lords...

He couldn’t afford to piss them off!

He was of a mind to give in. Keeping a tough attitude would only make his family suffer. The “shop owner” who stepped out earlier was already tricky enough, not to mention the guy had an ally. He probably couldn’t take them down even if he invited his friends. Even if they did fight, the entire planet would be destroyed.

Unless... he asked the Laiyefa family for help.

After all, that planet belonged to the Laiyefa family’s solar system, and its prosperity was in their best interests.

But!

If he were to start a planetary war just because one of his grandsons had died, would he be punished and killed by the Laiyefa family afterwards?

He had no doubt about it.

After all, the whole thing had begun with his grandson Randall attempting to rob a Star State expert, thus offending him. Getting himself killed was a natural outcome.

Even if other Star State peers learned about the situation, they would also agree that he deserved death.

So, the whole thing was rather tricky.

His retaliation wasn’t justified.

He would not need to justify his actions if he were strong enough, but that wasn’t the case. That was the cold reality.

No reasoning was needed if he could crush his enemy. He would have to reason with them if he couldn’t. However, he couldn’t possibly win in such a negotiation.

What to do?

He had no choice but to give in.

The more he thought about it, the more awful O’Neil looked. In the end he took a deep breath, gradually breathing out his fury and recovering his calm state.

It was better to lose face than to suffer greater losses. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Deliver my order. Don’t piss off that shop again. Send someone to negotiate with them and have them release Garland. Fulfill their demands as long as they aren’t too outrageous,” said O’Neil solemnly.

The old man in purple nodded and accepted the task; he was relieved to see that his father wouldn’t act recklessly.

His years of managing the family were all thanks to his calm and considerate character. While Randall’s death was infuriating, anger couldn’t solve the problem; it would only make it worse.

He had been chosen to manage all affairs in the family, large and small, exactly because he was rational and calm enough!

If a grandson was gone, another grandson could always be born.

Besides, there were two more sons who were both rather promising.

Randall had provoked quite a formidable enemy for his family, much before he was fully grown. He truly deserved death!

The old man in purple thought everything through. The only thing that made him mad was that that worthless grandson had disgraced the family in battle!

It was unforgivable!

In Woffett City—

Many pets were repairing the street; they had grasped skills related to construction and life through special training.

The street was soon fixed with their help.

Some of the ruined shops were also renovated and strengthened.

The line outside of the Pixie Pet Store was very long. More and more people had joined it after learning that someone from the Laiyefa family was also there.

The stars and the moon were gradually gone, and the sun was rising.

The next day had soon arrived.

The pets and the city construction department had retreated, and so had the city guards except for one squad, which was asked to maintain order as an aid to Su Ping’s shop. They claimed that too many people were waiting and conflicts could potentially arise.

Those waiting in line were all battle pet warriors. They weren’t fools; how could there be any conflicts?

It was just a gesture of friendliness.

Very soon, it was ten in the morning.

“Why is the door still not open?”

“Will the shop remain closed because of the battle yesterday?”

“This is so inconsiderate. Why won’t he open the shop yet? Is this how you do business?”

“Are we waiting for nothing?”

“Shut up. How can you be waiting for nothing? The shop will open tomorrow even if they don’t open today. The wait will be worth it even if I stand here for a week to buy a pet!”

“Exactly. All the pets here have Class A aptitude. One day of waiting is nothing. Get the hell out of here if you don’t want to wait.”

Everybody in the queue whispered. It was then that the shop slowly opened, and Su Ping stood by the door. There were stubbles in his face after a single night.

Su Ping simply opened the door without taking time to shave, knowing that the customers had waited for a long time.

“You’re back.”

Su Ping looked at an empty space not far away from the team and smiled.

Tang Ruyan and Zhong Lingtong, who had been standing there, quickly ran to him. Zhong Lingtong stuck out her tongue and said, “Sir, you’re so awesome. Is our shop so popular after it just opened?”

“Yeah, I heard that our shop just sold some Class A pets. Is it true?” Tang Ruyan was curious too.

Neither of them expected that the shop would become even more popular than it was back on the Blue Planet; it was a stark difference after barely returning from the language school.

“It seems that you’re quite fluent in the Common Tongue now.” Su Ping chuckled when he heard them speak the language.

Tang Ruyan snorted and said, “Of course. We’re geniuses.”

“Geniuses? Go and entertain the customers.”

Su Ping smiled and then entered the shop.

“Have the ones who are here to claim their pets enter first,” said Su Ping.

Tang Ruyan regained the professionalism she had developed back on the Blue Planet. She saluted and said, “As you wish!” Then, she stood at the door with arms akimbo, before she roared, “Come on in if you’re here to claim your pet. If you have other needs, please wait.”

“Huh? Why? I have to keep waiting?” someone in the line shouted, angry about the girl’s announcement.

Tang Ruyan was a ninth ranker, which was quite a remarkable feat on the Blue Planet, but most of their customers were Ocean State warriors; they weren’t impressed by her, at all.

Although it was weird enough seeing someone as strong as her working as a store clerk, they had already seen the blond woman; Tang Ruyan’s appearance wasn’t as surprising.

“Rules are rules!” Tang Ruyan rolled her eyes and bellowed at the guy who complained.

The guy fell quiet after hearing that. Everybody had searched online for the rules in Su Ping’s shop while they waited for their turn. The rules in themselves were strange, but they had to be obeyed.

Some of the rules couldn’t be broken, not even with money, such as line cutting or spot buying.

The customers who were there to fetch their pets were delighted to follow Tang Ruyan’s cue; all of them entered the shop and quickly greeted Su Ping behind the counter.

Su Ping asked Joanna to take the pets out and give them back according to their names.

They were in awe of Joanna, who was said to be at the Star State. She had made the captain of the city guards kneel the night before. Even the red-haired Star State guy behind her was acting quite obediently.

It was then that the pet owners saw the red-haired young man on the couch.

Their hearts began to race once they saw him idling on the couch. They had inferred Joanna’s cultivation after noticing the captain of the city guards’ behavior, but Su Ping and the red-haired young man were undoubtedly Star State warriors!

None of the customers who fetched their pets dared to test the training effect in Su Ping’s shop; they were intimidated by the powerhouses in the store. They simply said goodbye and went to the assessment shop across the street.

The more prudent ones even went to the neighboring street for testing, lest Su Ping became angry, thinking that they didn’t trust him.

“B-Boss, I’m here to claim my pet.”

Cleo arrived with the pet-redeeming crowd and looked around. Her pupils contracted when she saw Garland, then she quickly withdrew her gaze. She wouldn’t no longer dare to behave as arrogantly as she used to on her prior visit to the store.

“Name?”

“...Cleo.”

Cleo didn’t know what to say. The guy forgot my name after a single day? No one with a Star State level would have such a bad memory, unless he never planned to remember her name.

“Oh, your pet is receiving professional training. It’s not over yet,” said Su Ping casually while looking at her.

The answer was within Cleo’s expectation. She nodded and replied, “Got it.”

She was mainly there to check up on Garland, so she simply turned around and left.

Garland is safe... for now.

Cleo had soon left and returned to her own assessment shop, ready to deliver the news back to her family.

But then, exclamations burst out of the lobby right when she stepped into the shop.

Cleo raised her head, and her pupils contracted.

The test pillar at the center of the lobby was showing a Class A reading!

Another Class A pet?
