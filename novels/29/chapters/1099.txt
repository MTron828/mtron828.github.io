Chapter 1101: Robbery

“Okay,” Su Ping agreed.

He, too, thought the efficiency was too low.

Besides, he also considered it as the best solution to the trial’s first test.

They could loot the ultimate treasures of other star zones first. In the end, those with the most treasures would be the most likely to win the competition over the key!

“Should we leave directly, or should we inform them?” asked Shuai Qianhou.

Either way, their teammates wouldn’t feel happy. Su Ping asked back, “What do you think?”

Lost for words, Shuai Qianhou cursed him for his cunning mind. If anything happened to their teammates, Su Ping would surely blame everything on him when their master asked them.

“I think we should inform them; they probably want to get away too. After all, they can’t possibly win the key if they’re stuck with us,” said Shuai Qianhou.

“Okay.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Shuai Qianhou gathered everyone shortly after.

Once all the team was present, Shuai Qianhou informed them that he and Su Ping were going to attack the candidates of other star zones, and that their lives could be at risk if they tagged along.

It would be time for goodbyes if they were unwilling to follow.

The others were smart enough to stay behind since he had put it so frankly.

Meanwhile, they were puzzled and shocked. Attack candidates of other star zones? Is it really appropriate?

Shouldn’t their priority be finding the key?

Wanyan Shuang frowned. She had wanted to leave the team, but hesitated when Shuai Qianhou offered the choice.

It would be difficult for her to survive without the ultimate treasure, if she encountered people of other star zones.

“If I follow you, can you give me one of the other star zones’ ultimate treasures?” asked Wanyan Shuang.

Shuai Qianhou glanced at her and said, “Of course not.”

There was no such thing as having too many ultimate treasures.

Besides, they weren’t really short of Wanyan Shuang’s help.

Shuai Qianhou would’ve finished her off if she hadn’t switched sides quickly.

Heaving a sigh in her heart, Wanyan Shuang said, “It’s time we say good time then. Good luck.”

“Same to you,” said Su Ping, chuckling.

Diaz’s expression changed constantly. He alternated between looking at Su Ping and then Shuai Qianhou, but he couldn’t gather enough courage.

He suddenly thought he would have been better off staying on the branch continent earlier.

Competing over the key was too dangerous.

“Junior brothers, we’ll only hold you back if we follow you. We can only wish you good luck now,” said Yu Jingze solemnly.

Shuai Qianhou nodded.

“About the tokens…” Elena hesitated.

Shuai Qianhou raised his eyebrows and said casually, “I have to keep one of the tokens for myself. Although it’s possible that I’l find more tokens, I’d like to make sure I have one right now. I gave away three tokens earlier, and I can only offer three more at the moment. Senior Brother Su, do you want

one?”

Su Ping nodded. “If you insist, yes.”

Shuai Qianhou was lost for words. The guy was speaking as if he were giving it to him forcefully!

“Only two tokens left,” said Shuai Qianhou.

He had to cooperate with Su Ping, and didn’t want things to become too intense between them.

Yu Jingze and the others looked at each other in bewilderment. Elena said, “We’ll continue exploring as a team. Two tokens will be enough for us; maybe we’ll pick up others.”

“Idon’t need any,” said Wanyan Shuang to them with a glance and a headshake.

Yu Jingze and the others felt relieved.

Shuai Qianhou immediately took out a pair of tokens and gave them to Yu Jingze. He then gave one to Su Ping and said, “It’s time we say goodbye then. I hope you’ll be lucky enough to find the key and the tokens.”

“You should be more careful too,” said Yu Jingze and the others with concern.

Su Ping looked at Diaz and said, “You’d better keep a low profile and hide when you find a token. I’m still waiting for you to catch up with me.”

Diaz felt dazed. This time, instead of acting tough, he asked out of reflex, “You’re not planning to win the legacy?”

“Tll try my best and see where fate leads me,” said Su Ping with a smile.

Shuai Qianhou couldn’t help but glance at Su Ping. He didn’t believe that kind of crap.

Diaz snapped out of his daze. He thought that Su Ping had at first wanted him to catch up after reaching the Celestial State. Was he just being nice, or was it a provocation?

He shook his head and said to Su Ping, “In any case, I hope that you’ll survive.”

Su Ping was stunned for a moment. He then glanced at him and smiled. “I wil

After everyone said their goodbyes, Su Ping and Shuai Qianhou quickly moved forward.

“Follow me.”

Shuai Qianhou led the way as they dove into deeper spaces.

He had many advantages in those regions with his perfect path of space. He was able to detect traps with clarity, and was remarkably fast.

Su Ping quickly dashed forward with Void Walker and followed him. They were ten times faster than before!

It wasn’t just because they were no longer held back by Yu Jingze and their other teammates; it was also because they didn’t have to process the information on mud, trees, etc. to look for the key. They only needed to find living people!

If they found targets, they would rob them!

“Although there aren’t any terrains marked on the map of the central continent that our master gave us, the continent clearly has the shape of a circle. There are twelve points at the edge of the circle where the winners of the branch candidates would be sent.”

Shuai Qianhou said decisively, “We’ve been searching within one of the twelve locations, Let’s go to the edge first, and then head to the other locations!”

“Sure.” Su Ping gave hima slight nod.

The place was too big. They could get lost if they went straight to the center of the continent.

If others were also combing the place like them, they would surely be near the location where they arrived. It would be easy to meet them.

On their way, while avoiding dangers in the void, Shuai Qianhou asked, “Senior Brother Su, did you grasp the path of fire first, or the law of chaos?”

The trip was long and tedious, so he would rather talk to Su Ping.

“The path of fire,” said Su Ping. There was nothing to hide about that. He asked back, “What about you?”

“Me too.” Shuai Qianhou smiled. “It seems that we’re quite similar.”

$u Ping couldn’t help but glance at him. He asked warily, “You’re not gay, are you?”

Shuai Qianhou was instantly lost for words. “Senior Brother Su, you’re overthinking. Cultivators like us don’t have any sexual desires. I’ve done it in every way possible since tens of thousands of years ago.”

“You have?” Su Ping narrowed his eyes.

Shuai Qianhou was amused by Su Ping’s reaction. “Senior Brother Su, you are still a new cultivator. You lose interest in those things after cultivating for tens of thousands of years. After all, even the greatest excitement will become boring given enough time. Human beings only have limited patience for

every matter; they would grow tired of anything sooner or later, however addictive it is.

“Leven lost interest in food when I started my twentieth millennium of cultivation, particularly because I didn’t need food to survive. You’ll get bored of it sooner or later if you’re only enjoying it for fun.”

“Can you ever be tired of having fun?” Su Ping was stunned.

“When you’ve cultivated long enough, Senior Brother Su, you’ll realize that the older a cultivator is, the more indifferent they will be, until they’re no different than rocks. Rocks are probably able to endure for countless years because of being emotionless,” said Shuai Qianhou.

Su Ping didn’t quite believe it. “What about people like our master, who has cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years? Are they even colder than rocks?”

“They’re even colder than blades.” Shuai Qianhou narrowed his eyes. But he soon added, “But I believe our master sincerely cares about us.”

“So do I.” Su Ping instantly nodded.

Shuai Qianhou glanced at him and smiled.

“If the two of us have to fight for the key in the end… will you go easy on me, Senior Brother Su?” Shuai Qianhou suddenly dropped his smile and stared at Su Ping.

Su Ping was stunned by the change. He said, “You’ve cultivated for fifty thousand years. How long have I cultivated? Shouldn’t you be the one going easy on me?”

Shuai Qianhou’s eyes glittered. He asked that question with another purpose, which was to test Su Ping’s trump cards. Whether or not Su Ping gave a positive reply, he would be able to infer that Su Ping had other trump cards he hadn’t used yet.

However, Su Ping’s reply was quite surprising for him.

“It would be boring if we have to act brutally towards each other in the end,” said Shuai Qianhou in a low voice.

Su Ping nodded. “In that case, you should just give it to me.”

Shuai Qianhou stared at him. “What if I don’t?”

“T’ll just fight for it then,” said Su Ping with a smile, “It’s the opportunity to reach the Celestial State anyway. We’ll see which of us is stronger.”

“Okay!” Shuai Qianhou nodded quickly. “Let’s find out!”

He then remarked, “To be honest, Senior Brother Su, although you’re still young, I like you very much. I will still respect you as my senior brother if I do reach the Celestial State in the end.”

“Okay.” Su Ping smiled and then continued, “We haven’t found anyone yet, but we’re already talking about this. If anyone hears this, won’t they think we’re just spewing bulls**t?”

“probably,” said Shuai Qianhou.

They looked at each other, and then both burst into laughter.

Time flew.

The pair moved at full speed in the sixth space.

Even though Shuai Qianhou had grasped the perfect path of space, he wasn’t as daring to enter the seventh space. Although he could survive there, that didn’t mean he could do whatever he wanted!

‘There were dangers they had to avoid even as they traveled in the sixth space.

There were ferocious beasts hiding in the sixth space. Some even moved in hordes; the leaders of those hordes were usually Ascendant creatures.

‘They chose not to provoke the locals and continue traveling. Two days later, they finally met people from other star zones.

‘There was a whole lot gathered.

“Oh my. That’s a lot of of them!” While hiding in the deep space, they carefully examined the sounds and inferred the number of people outside. They were quite surprised at the scale..
