Chapter 1420 One Finger (2)

“Are you done? You’ve been losing again and again. Why don’t you ask your Ancestral God to come here?”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes coldly. He didn’t give them a chance to keep calling for aid. He quickly attacked one of the emperors.

He wanted to gauge and push his limits, but he had already seen Ancestral Gods. The Chaos Perception Dragon-the creature that had once taught the young Chaos Beast-was an Ancestral God beast in the world of gods. It was even more terrifying than normal Ancestral Gods. Nobody had been able to tame it yet.

Su Ping knew it was impossible for him to win against an Ancestral God with his current strength. He would be instantly killed if he were to test his limits with Ancestral Gods.

We

Bang!

He swung the spear and instantly approached that emperor.

The latter quickly blocked the attack, but the spear pierced through his arm.

Su Ping stabbed again, gathering infinite Great Dao as a beam of light, which tore the enemy’s universe apart and pierced him in the void.

“Don’t you want your weapon? Here you go!”

Su Ping charged at Lin Tianzhan after killing that emperor.

The latter had bloodshot eyes, having heard Su Ping’s roar, and how the other emperor had succumbed. That emperor belonged to the Rain Ancestor’s time period. He failed to win the competition against the Rain Clan, and chose to become a follower. He had acted as elder, and protected the clan for a very long time.

Back when he was little, the guy was already a God King!

However, that uncle of his had already collapsed in front of him.

“You must die!!”

Lin Tianzhan gnashed his teeth. His body was trembling, never thinking that the actions taken by one person would endanger his clan. The battle against Su Ping was no different from a war against a high-ranked clan!

Besides, never had there been such swift deaths of emperors in the past, not even in the most intense clan wars.

Lin Tianzhan suddenly raised his head as the spear approached. He vanished from the spot.

But the next moment—the spear aura pierced into his body in the void. His armor was broken, while the flesh on his shoulder was obliterated. “You can’t even block your own weapon? How can I give it back to you like this?” Su Ping stepped out of the deep space and swung the spear again. His spear contained the power of the world within a radius of thousands of kilometers, and it was great enough to pierce any emperor. The result was like watching a mortal on Earth endure the pressure of ten thousand kilometers; he would be directly squeezed into a pulp.

The energy wake caused by the spear was already suffocating enough for Lin Tianzhan. Even the air seemed empty. He couldn’t understand why Su Ping was powerful to a terrifying degree. It exceeded the emperor category, but he wasn’t an Ancestral God. Furthermore, Su Ping’s own level was only that of a God King.

It was strange and incomprehensible!

Lin Tianzhan dodged again. However, the spear aura had already locked onto his soul and he couldn’t get rid of it. He tried his best, but he could only postpone the spear hitting him.

He had already been hit by the spear to some degree; the result was unchangeable. However, he struggled to alter the result if only barely, turning from heavily wounded to mildly wounded.

Boom. Lin Tianzhan was sent flying by Su Ping again.Half his face had been stabbed; the damaged section was bloody, with bones protruding. However, the flesh on his wound was wriggling and flushing out the Great Dao power inside.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. This guy was much stronger than the other emperors; he actually endured two spear attacks and survived.

“You’ve endured a power of a 10,000 kilometer range; this is enough to earn your right to be called a genius.” Su Ping’s eyes glittered and he charged again.

He was becoming proficient with his new power, the one borrowed from the world through the Contract Dao Heart in a radius of 10,000 kilometers. Normal God Emperors were no different from children in front of him. After all, too many laws and Great Daos were within that range. It wasn’t a simple power.

I wonder how much of this power I can borrow…

He didn’t slow down while he pondered. His third attack was about to hit the target, but then an illusory power descended. Su Ping instantly felt that Lin Tianzhan had turned into a special being, as if he were in another world; he couldn’t be sensed, and only his afterimage could be seen.

Concurrently—the aura that carried the strange power arrived in full.

Su Ping instantly saw mountains falling in front of his eyes. The pressure was so immense that he found himself in a snake den. He felt uncontrollably cold.

He raised his head and looked. Then, he saw a hazy inhuman figure that looked like a pure glowing entity, emitting gray light. There was a terrifying, compact power at the light’s core.

Su Ping didn’t panic. Even if he perished, he could still resurrect through the system. At the moment he was actually more interested in focusing and observing the power’s components.

With his chaos eyes, he saw that the power was made of an unimaginable number of Great Daos. However, the Great Daos melded together until they became countable. In the end, there was only one left!

The Great Daos were fused!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. You can do that?

While Su Ping watched, the hazy light erupted and darted towards Su Ping.

The latter felt instantly horrified. He would die if he made contact with the light by chance!

Resurrecting was something he could do, but Su Ping preferred not to go down that easily. He roared and controlled the power of the world, further connecting with the world. His universe of chaos gathered all the power and formed a vortex-like python. He was trying to resist the power.

That sharp python revolved like a storm and contained a terrifying tearing force. They would be constantly weakened once the enemy’s attack was in their range.

However, Su Ping didn’t know whether or not he could live to the moment the power was weakened.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye, too fast.

After a bam, the sharp python summoned by Su Ping was shattered. The next moment, his universe was pierced, leaving a hole; same with his body. The terrifying force completely twisted him; Su Ping was turning him into a black hole.

The light in front of Su Ping was gone. He then saw a finger. At the end of the compact, hazy light, was the Ancestral God’s finger! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Tearing, destruction, pain.

Su Ping sensed the expansion and decline of his body. The feeling was utterly familiar, as he had experienced it a million times.

“So, it’s the Ancestral God’s finger…”

Su Ping gnashed his teeth with craziness in his eyes, “You think you can squeeze me to death with just one finger? I’m not an ant!”

His soul roared, and the roar echoed in his skull. The blood in his head burned and boiled. His shattered and distorted body was recovering bit by bit. The power he formerly gathered stretched out from 10,000 kilometers to 20,000 kilometers, not stopping until it reached the 30,000 kilometer mark!

The tearing force acting on Su Ping was also blocked by the new power of the world that merely surged in. Both powers collided; Su Ping gradually gained the upper hand and suppressed his wound.

Everything happened all too quickly. Both time and space around Su Ping were too broken to be seen clearly. However, when observed from other times and spaces, it could be seen that Su Ping would recover the moment he was hurt.

“This is impossible!”

Lin Tianzhan and the others were so shocked by that scene that their souls were escaping their bodies. The ancestor soul’s attack didn’t kill Su Ping?!

Their dumbfoundment was such that their heads even went blank. It was even more shocking than mortals seeing gods arrive before their eyes.

They had been cultivating for ages; their accumulated knowledge, both conceived and consolidated over the years, was indestructible. When renewed, it was as intense as the explosion of a planet.

“Die now!!”

Bolts of lightning darted out of his eyes and shot through the whole world once his wound was healed. He clenched his fist and swept

out.

This instantly gave way to a terrifying scene. The void collapsed wherever his spear made contact; the void was collapsing and countless Great Daos were being annihilated.

Bang, bang!

Two emperors were hit first. Even though they had gathered all their strength to resist, they were like eggs hit by heavy rocks, and were instantly blown up into nothingness.
