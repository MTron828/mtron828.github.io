Chapter 1294 Collapse (1)

“Kill them?”

Everybody was stunned again. The big-headed child chuckled. “That’s all right. This is my Oceanic Universe of Clouds; I can reverse time and resurrect you if it comes to that. This is my universe; I make the rules here.”

“I understand.”

Su Ping nodded.

“Humph! How arrogant!”

Zhan Wushuang indifferently gathered a spear in his hand. He shook his weapon and stabbed forward.

Su Ping also stepped toward his opponent with a normal expression.

After a boom, the spear aura collapsed when it reached a ten-meter distance from Su Ping. Nobody saw the latter do a thing; the aura seemed to have collapsed by the effect of his own force field.

Zhan Wushuang narrowed his eyes. That was just a probing attack; he didn’t think that Su Ping’s reaction would be that casual. As expected of someone who was bold enough to challenge a Dao Child.

“Even though I can’t exterminate you, I will kill you once today for having slayed a prince of the Rain Clan!” declared Zhan Wushuang. Golden light burst out of his eyes, making him look like a god descending upon the land.

Whoosh!

While holding his spear, he charged forth and instantly tore open the surface of the Oceanic Universe of Clouds, flashing to a point right in front of Su Ping.

His golden spear aura darted out like a dragon rising from the sea.

In the auditorium behind Su Ping-everybody felt the sharpness and the suffocating pressure of the spear, despite the protective barrier. They were shocked; Zhan Wushuang’s casual attack was already that powerful!

Boom. Su Ping took action; he moved so quickly that the spear aura suddenly disappeared. Everybody saw the most unbelievable scene. Zhan Wushuang’s unstoppable spear was grabbed by Su Ping, just like daring to grab the head of a dangerous snake!

A blast was spreading out, but Su Ping’s body remained still.

“You want to kill me, but you’re not good enough. Wait, not nearly good enough,” said Su Ping.

His hand dragged the spear toward him as he spoke; his body dashed forward like a seagull, throwing a punch at Zhan Wushuang’s face.

The power of chaos burst out of his fist, swallowing all nearby laws like a roaring black hole. Zhan Wushuang’s hair was fluttering with the fist aura alone.

Zhan Wushuang narrowed his eyes and bellowed, “F*ck off!!” His body was glowing, and his other hand punched back.

There was a cracking noise, heralding a bone fracture; disbelief was written all over Zhan Wushuang’s face. His arm crumbled, and Su Ping’s fist smashed him in the face after dealing with the arm.

Zhan Wushuang’s head exploded and blood splashed out. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But the next moment—the illusion of a universe surfaced behind his back and powerful vitality was emitted. His headless body began to expand significantly, and his long spear glowed as he broke free from Su Ping’s grasp.

His head quickly grew back. He furiously charged at Su Ping.

“Is Zhan Wushuang at a disadvantage?”

Outside of the battlefield-everybody’s eyes widened when they saw that happen.

Nobody expected that the long-time famous Zhan Wushuang would lose the first clash against Su Ping!

“Zhan Wushuang was too careless.”

“That human is indeed capable.”

The other seven candidates had glittering eyes; Su Ping’s performance had made them turn serious. However, a couple of them still wore disdainful expressions. That was the bone-rooted arrogance of a high-ranked prince that could hardly be changed.

Boom!

There was suppressed fury in Zhan Wushuang’s eyes. He was representing the Rain Clan, which had been embarrassed by Su Ping time and again. His original plan was to exact revenge by crushing Su Ping with absolute power, but he was humiliated.

He pulled all stops and his constitution instantly burst out. Concurrently, a majestic figure arose behind him; it was none other than the Rain Clan’s Ancestral God!

The summoned illusion of such a figure was releasing a daunting and suffocating aura throughout the battlefield.

The great senior’s illusion had a universe ball in one hand. It was Zhan Wushuang’s universe, which contained unimaginable vitality!

“Zhan Wushuang is getting serious!”

“He’s so strong! Are all the Dao Child candidates like him? My shock is going to last for the next thousand years!”

“Even the candidates are already unbelievably strong. How crazy must the three Dao Children be?”

“No wonder some of the mentors are so courteous when interacting with the Dao Children, to even go out of their way to greet them. I got angry when I saw that once, thinking that Dao Children had no respect for the teachers. I didn’t know I was the clown…”

Countless students were too shocked to speak. Some of them were new students with a Star Lord cultivation; the barrier couldn’t fully block the pressure of an Ancestral God, and they were feeling the urge to kneel.

Back on the battlefield-Su Ping calmly raised his head and stared at the Ancestral God’s illusion behind Zhan Wushuang’s back.

He had already seen such an illusion before.

It had been summoned by Mo Feng, which had forced his Star State old self to go all out – just to remain standing.

The illusion summoned by Zhan Wushuang was more vivid and carried more pressure, but he felt less intimidated.

Su Ping was already able to remain calm in front of such illusions, since he had already seen creatures of such rank in the flesh.
