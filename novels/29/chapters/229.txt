Chapter 231 Hardcore Upgrade and the Arrival of Legendary Warriors

Upgrading the store to the third level would cost one hundred thousand energy points.

Su Ping had managed to accumulate many energy points when the business was flourishing. He had also spent many energy points when he was upgrading the Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation, buying nursing pens and other materials, and beast-catching rings in the system’s shop.

Besides, he visited the Demigod Burial. 1200 energy points for the admission price was merely a small part of his expenditure there.

The number of energy points he had spent on revivals during the seven days was huge. The revival’s energy points were 10 times the admission price. In total, he had spent over ten thousand energy points on revivals!

That was why Su Ping was afraid to go to the Archean Divinity.

He could afford the 9000 energy points requested for admission but he couldn’t afford the revivals there...

Su Ping heaved a sigh as he looked at the interface. He had 460,000 energy points left. He would have to spend 100,000 energy points to upgrade the store and that was one more step further away from amassing one million energy points to upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation...

Even though he felt his heart was aching as he was spending those energy points, he understood he had to upgrade the store right then. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation, even if he had enough energy points...

“Luckily, I can launch a professional training service after upgrading the store to the third level. One round of professional training can get me ten thousand energy points. If I can take on several such orders every day, to have one million energy points won’t be that difficult,” Su Ping said to himself. He stopped hesitating and went ahead to upgrade the store.

“Beep!”

“Terms to upgrade the store to the third level were met. Upgrade or not?” the system said. Su Ping sulked. “Can you quit it with the ‘beep’ before you say things?” The system answered with a question. “Don’t you humans think this is what smart systems should do?”

“Only idiotic systems do this.” “Is that so? I will switch to something else next time, then. Confirm your choice first.”

“You know what I am thinking. Why do you need me to confirm anything?’

“We should follow procedures, you know. Human rights. Am I right?”

Su Ping rolled his eyes. “Upgrade.”

“Ding!”

“The store will be upgraded. Business will be suspended for the next 24 hours. The newly added services are...”

Su Ping: “...”

He didn’t bother to continue his argument with the system. His attention was on a list with some new services that would be available at the store.

First, it was the long-anticipated professional training service. For every round of training, he would charge the customer one million federal coins, which would be converted into ten thousand energy points and the service would be available indefinitely!

As long as the customers could afford it, they could select this service which was the most suitable for wealthy students like Ye Hao.

The second new service was a venue for tests.

The store would have a designated venue for customers to test their pets’ skills. This way, customers would be able to perform tests directly in the store, instead of going out to find another battle venue after picking up their pets.

The third service to be added was pet sales.

That was an upgrade to the pet rental service.

Previously, the store had already established a pet rental service. Su Ping had never used it because he didn’t have proper pets to be rented out.

He trained the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound often and he treated them as his pets. He never planned on renting them out and he wouldn’t want to do so, either.

After all, people who rented those pets could use them wrongly. The pets’ lives could not be brought back if they, unfortunately, perish.

If the pets died, the customers would not get a refund of their deposits. In some way, the customers would have practically bought the pets at a huge cost. However, for Su Ping, pets like the Little Skeleton, the Dark Dragon Hound, and the Inferno Dragon were too valuable to be sold.

The pet sale service couldn’t have come at a better time.

Su Ping was happy about this service. At the Mysterious Realm, he had caught several beasts at the peak of the ninth rank with his beast-catching rings. Those pets, while at the peak of the ninth rank, were only average in combat abilities and had a poor aptitude. They were just the kind of pets that could be sold.

Su Ping didn’t want to keep those beasts for himself. Currently, Little Skeleton had already exceeded 10 in combat strength, much better than the beasts he caught.

Also, he couldn’t build contracts with pets at the peak of the ninth rank. His brain would explode.

After all...

His astral powers were only at the lower position of the sixth rank.

There was a huge gap between him and the beasts at the peak of the ninth rank. Currently, at the very best, he could master beasts at the lower position of the eight rank. That was at his limit. Controlling such a beast could backfire on him and he could suffer a mental breakdown. Beasts of the upper position of the seventh rank were the ones he could control but risks were still there.

“This is a good chance. I can sell the ninth-rank beasts in the beast-catching rings. Those kinds of high-level beasts can be appealing to high-quality customers. I’ll see those beasts as an advertisement for the store,” Su Ping said to himself.

“The store is upgraded now. Then what is the security zone like now?” Su Ping asked. This was his biggest concern at the moment.

The system replied, “The security zone within the territory of the store has been set up. As long as it’s within the scope of the store, the host will be safe. As for the other functions, they will become available after the upgrade is completed.” “Really?” Su Ping was happy to hear this. That was to say, he could step out at the moment and go to the other places he had purchased.

“The host can activate the visual function to observe the security zone of all the store. This way, the host can see the boundaries of the security zone. That function is available to the host only.” Added the system.

Su Ping was surprised. “Active.” He said at once.

Soon, in his sight, he could see a layer of the light green veil on the stairs outside the store and that light green veil extended further away from the store. Su Ping stuck his head out and saw the green veil covered up most of the other places he had bought.

Was this part of the security zone?

Su Ping’s eyes were glowing. This way, he could have an accurate understanding of the scope of the security zone.

Suddenly, he heard some car engines making noises outside. A fleet of a home decoration company drove in and parked outside the stores that Su Ping had purchased.

Su Ping had no idea about what was going on. In the next moment, many average-looking people got off the cars and stepped into the many stores that he had bought.

“What...?”

Su Ping stared at them and wanted to go and confront them.

“Host does not need to worry. Those are just energy beings that the system has created. They are here to provide cover for the upgrade of the store,” The system stated calmly.

Su Ping was taken aback.

To provide cover for the upgrade of the store?

He had thought that he just had to stay put for 24 hours and then the store would have a completely new look, with all the stores becoming one.

He never expected that the system could come up with those energy beings who were pretending to be a decoration team.

How queer this was!

Of course, this would save him a ton of trouble. Having someone pretending was better than all the stores magically becoming one overnight. Otherwise, he would have to explain to his mom and Su Lingyue.

“Will 24 hours be enough even if it’s for play pretend construction?” Su Ping asked.

The system answered. “This is a large team. The time is tight but it will not raise suspicions. People will only be amazed at the efficiency of the team.”

Su Ping admitted that he was awed.

The system was even more scheming than he was.

At the same time, Su Lingyue walked over after she heard the noises. She saw the decoration company fleet parked on the street. Surprised, she asked, “Why? Since when could this shabby street afford such a large-scale decoration?”

Since the system had offered a solution, Su Ping was more than happy to oblige. He said calmly, “It is me, your brother, that hired the team. They are all working on the stores that I bought. From now on, all of them will be ours. I want to put them together right now. After the work is done, you and mom can pick a place to live in.”

Su Ping had bought more places than what was required by the system. Those actual places would not be included in the system’s construction scope and would remain the same as before. Su Ping would have to find actual human companies to decorate and renovate them.

After his response, Su Ping had another question for the system. “You built such a large team and they came out from nowhere. If people knew about this, how do you think I should explain it? Wouldn’t it become more suspicious?”

“Do not worry. I have set up a company that they belong to. When the upgrade is over, no one is going to doubt a thing,” the system replied casually.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He did not make further comments because he knew the system was capable of doing this. After all, he still had that unknown, strange bank card that all the income of the store would be transferred to.

“You hired them? You bought all the places?”

Su Lingyue was dumbstruck. The street was crowded with cars and many workers were outside, getting ready for the renovation. He had bought all those places. Even if she had not begun to work yet, she still had an idea of how much money it would require given the value of their family’s own store.

Su Ping acted normal. Su Lingyue’s gut feeling told her to call his bluff. But she remembered what Su Ping did for her at the explorers’ base and his merit points of over four hundred million...

She decided not to say a thing.

She didn’t know when it happened, but she realized that she was no longer able to read Su Ping. She had thought she knew what kind of person Su Ping was but he had exceeded her expectations time after time.

Su Ping saw his mom getting up. She was woken up by the construction hustle and bustle. He asked her to follow him and Su Lingyue. They stayed within the security zone, went to the corner of the street, and found a diner that he didn’t buy out. He ordered something and they sat down for a simple breakfast.

During their breakfast, Li Qingru asked about the workers as well and Su Ping repeated his explanation.

Li Qingru’s first reaction was that Su Ping was joking around when he said he was the one hiring all the workers and buying all the other places. She could not believe him. She did a rough calculation and concluded that the cost would be at least two hundred million.

That number was astronomical for her. She could not make so much money even if she could live forever, let alone in this lifetime.

Su Ping could no longer hide the information that he was an explorer. He told mom about this which was the only logical explanation.

Li Qingru was still having doubts. Su Lingyue jumped out to clear Su Ping’s name. When she explained, she had a weird expression on her face. She proved what Su Ping said was true and implied that Su Ping was at a high rank, actually being one of the most powerful explorers.

Li Qingru put her hand over Su Lingyue’s forehead to see if the latter was burning up. Then she asked if Su Lingyue was indebted to Su Ping somehow.

Su Ping and Su Lingyue didn’t know what to say to their mom. Su Lingyue glared at Su Ping. It was so frustrating that one day, she would have to defend him in front of their mother, not to mention not being trusted.

Su Ping was helpless. He thought about showing them his bank card to prove his story. On second thought, he gave up on the idea. There was still close to a seven to eight hundred million balance on his card. Explaining that would be even harder.

Inside, he was sighing.

He couldn’t just call out the Inferno Dragon to demonstrate he could make money. As for finding proof of his identity as an explorer? He had not collected his gold-tier explorer medal yet. Even if he had, he assumed his mom would not recognize it.

After much deliberation, Su Ping believed there was only one person that could explain all this for him, Dong Mingsong.

Su Lingyue was studying at the Phoenix Peak Academy. Naturally, Li Qingru knew about the Vice Principal. She had seen pictures and information about him online.

Su Ping called Dong Mingsong and started a video chat at once.

The call went through. On the screen, Dong Mingsong was smiling happily. “Mr. Su, how did you find free time to call me?”

Su Ping heaved a sigh before he answered, “Here is the thing. Can you explain to my mom that I’m a teacher at the academy?”

Dong Mingsong found the request odd.

At the same time, Li Qingru had recognized Dong Mingsong. She gasped in surprise. Dong Mingsong knew what was going on. He greeted Li Qingru with a kind smile and then Su Ping let his mom chat with Dong Mingsong Ten minutes later, the call ended. Li Qingru looked at Su Ping, shocked and happy. She believed in his story this time. Dong Mingsong reassured her again and again. Finally, she understood that her son had awakened a long time before and had become an advanced teacher at the Phoenix Peak Academy!

The Phoenix Peak Academy was famous. Li Qingru was proud enough that Su Lingyue could be admitted. She didn’t know that Su Ping had achieved such a stunning achievement. He had joined the academy as an advanced teacher. How talented he must

be!

Tears came to her eyes. She was too excited.

Su Ping hurried to comfort her. He didn’t know she would be this thrilled.

“Look at you. Why didn’t you tell me about this before? When did you awaken? Why didn’t you tell me? I could buy you a pet. Our family is kind of poor but I would buy you a qualified pet at all costs.” Li Qingru’s eyes were filled with tears but she was smiling happily. She was glad that Su Ping had turned out to be so amazing and at the same time felt sorry for him.

She had never helped Su Ping in his cultivation. She knew that Su Ping’s accomplishments was definitely a result of his hard work.

That thought made her heart ache.

“Mom, this is a long story. I will tell you some other time,” Su Ping said. He could tell that her feelings were sincere from the look of her eyes. He was touched; maybe this was the reason why he was willing to call her mom.

Su Lingyue sat on the side, not saying a word.

“Your father will be happy to know that you’re full of promises. I have to call your father some time. You and Lingyue have grown up; your father won’t have to continue risking his life. I can tell him to come back to find a safer and easier job.” Li Qingru wiped off her tears and went on joyfully.

Su Ping had little memory of the father he had never met.

Su Lingyue said something for the first time in a long while, “It is time to tell dad to come back.” She was serious. “When I graduate, I will become a powerful explorer as well. Dad doesn’t have to go to sea to make money anymore. He can only come home a few times a year and what he is doing is far too dangerous.”

“Yes.” Li Qingru nodded.

This was what she had been worried about as well. She was always on tenterhooks. She would have never allowed her husband to take on such a risky occupation if it weren’t for their two kids.

Su Ping felt sorry to hear them saying those words. “Tell dad to come back. I will support the family.”

Li Qingru was comforted by his reply. “You have grown up and you can make so much money. In the future, your dad and I will be able to live an easier life, but we will continue to work. I will find a job with your dad when I feel better, to help you out on the off chance that you need some money in the future.”

Su Ping felt his heart was being crushed. He took a deep breath and said, “Mom, we will talk about jobs in the future. First, tell dad to come back. Also, from now on, you will live on this street. I will set up a house for you. In case of emergencies, I’ll be able to go and help you right away if you live close to me.”

Li Qingru nodded. She didn’t ask about what dangers there could be. She had lived long years and experienced many events. She knew the base city was not secure, especially in the shantytown areas.

Many base cities on the planet had fallen due to beast invasions. The way she saw it, this was probably what Su Ping referred to as emergencies.

Although the odds of such events happening to them was low, the risk was still there. It was better to err on the side of caution.

They finished their breakfast and Su Ping took Li Qingru and Su Lingyue to a store that used to sell sofas. They would stay there for the time being. He would find another time to hire a real decoration team to fix up this building as a house.

As for why they had to stay there, Su Ping made up an excuse. Since Su Lingyue knew the true reason, she helped Su Ping persuade Li Qingru into staying.

Li Qingru couldn’t argue with them so she agreed to stay.

After having helped them settle down, Su Ping went back to his store.

He heard the loud noises along the way, so loud that his ears were going numb. He asked the system. “Can you make it less noisy? There are other stores in business around here. This is too much a scene.”

“Got it.”

Soon, all the noises from the construction were less loud. The decoration teams shifted their work indoors. In this way, people could see that there was construction still going on but at the same time, they couldn’t see the specifics. This was enough for a cover-up story.

Su Ping was amazed by this hardcore upgrade.

He went back to the store and called Joanna out from the nursing pen. Powerful energy oozed out from her, which was too eye-catching because she had the momentum of a beast king.

He told her to dial it down and walk around the stores under construction to check his territory.

She obeyed his orders to retract her energy output. But she wasn’t happy about checking his territory. She felt Su Ping was abusing his powers for a personal agenda! But she remembered what she could get as an employee. She snorted as a protest and then was ready to go out.

It was at that time when some people showed up.

The leader of the gang was an old man with white hair. He was wearing a cyan robe. The old man appeared to be elegant and refined. He didn’t let out any powerful energy but he didn’t seem to fit in this environment. There was something about him that made people feel he didn’t belong to this secular world.
