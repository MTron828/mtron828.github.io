Chapter 1116 Prolonged Battle

“What is wrong with your head?” Lin Xiu found it impossible to understand; he simply thought that Su Ping was too confident in himself, so he didn’t want to talk to him anymore.

He activated the sword plate again, as an attempt to block Su Ping’s actions. Meanwhile, he ran off in another direction.

What Su Ping had said earlier misled him into thinking that the latter was only provoking him because he couldn’t force him to stay.

However, the clash made him realize he had been tricked. The kid was so cunning that he purposefully left such an impression on him. It would be impossible to suppress Su Ping in a head-on clash!

The saints’ ultimate treasure didn’t work on Su Ping. Even though he was one of the strongest without such a treasure; however unwillingly, he had to admit that he was incapable of killing Su Ping!

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Seeing that the other was running, Su Ping roared, “Halt!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He charged forward with the bone saber. The law of chaos and the path of illusion prevented him from being affected by other laws.

Exactly at that moment—the fleeing Lin Xiu suddenly turned around. His body broke the domain that Su Ping had created and he marched back.

It was a thunderous strike!

The light of four supreme laws emerged. All of them were perfect!

That was Lin Xiu’s real power!

He was one of the top Star Lords even without artifacts. His 100,000 years as a Star Lord rendered him already unparalleled with his aptitudes.

“The power of four extremes!” Lin Xiu burst out. His terrifying power was gathered to form a saber he used to slashed at Su Ping furiously.

His path of space was also perfect. When paired with time, it would yield the power of space and time. They resisted Su Ping’s tripled power with the other three supreme laws. His outburst was indeed able to break Su Ping’s domain of chaos, allowing him to break in!

Everything had happened too fast for him to react.

But Su Ping didn’t panic, as if having foreseen it. Killing intent surged out of his eyes as he made a stabbing motion. At the same timethe illusions of all three small worlds were condensed in front of his sword like a lotus flower!

“You…”

Lin Xiu was shocked.

The next moment, the two horrifying forces collided and Lin Xiu was instantly flung back, vomiting blood. Su Ping was also flung back; he didn’t look very happy. He had to admit that Lin Xiu was strong enough to cultivate all four supreme laws and make use of them with his own understanding. The man was definitely capable of rising to the Ascendant State!

He probably would have been defeated if he hadn’t cultivated a third small world!

“You were prepared!”

Lin Xiu’s face was pale but his cheeks were flushed. He wiped off his blood, with coldness and fury in his eyes. “Yes, because I knew that you were determined to kill me!” Su Ping sneered.

Indeed, he wanted to slay Lin Xiu, but the latter wanted to kill him even more!

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu only because he was angry, but Lin Xiu had to kill him to keep the saints’ secret from being exposed! Therefore, Su Ping realized that the latter was only pretending to escape. His fully charged strike collided with Lin Xiu’s half-baked attack, injuring the man heavily.

“Brat!!”

Lin Xiu was so furious he almost gritted his teeth into pieces. He would undoubtedly remember that obnoxious guy for the next 10,000 years if he didn’t kill him.

He could accept that his strength had been eclipsed, but then he had the feeling that his wisdom was also being eclipsed.

“Rot in hell!”

After catching his breath, Su Ping recovered his energy and healed his wounds with the path of vitality to then charge at Lin Xiu again.

Lin Xiu also took a deep breath, returning to his peak status in the blink of an eye. His perfect law of vitality had allowed him to survive being chased by an Ascendant expert!

“Fortunately, you’ve only cultivated for a hundred years. It would have been a headache if the trial were to be postponed for a thousand years!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were cold. He stopped hiding, and his face was brimming with brutality.

He had already seen that Su Ping had only mastered the perfect paths of fire and chaos, while the others had yet to be perfected. He managed to detect Su Ping’s expertise the moment he performed them; he was not afraid that Su Ping would pretend.

“I’m going to beat you, even if we have to fight a war of attrition today. Let’s see who will

win!”

Lin Xiu roared and charged, while an enormous shadow appeared behind his back at the same time. It was a hideous beast that melded with him; his combat ability was further improved in an instant.

No words were said; Su Ping charged toward him again.

Boom! Boom!

They clashed in the void and bombarded each other time and again. The illusions made with triple small worlds behind Su Ping’s back were splendid and eye-catching. The sword aura made with the law of chaos could rip apart Lin Xiu’s multiplied laws. Lin Xiu had already fused the four supreme laws and combined their traits; he was the strongest Star Lord in the Federation, even without multiple small worlds!

Nevertheless, he was still suppressed by Su Ping with the tripled law of chaos.

Lin Xiu was flung away again and again during the clashes, but each time he rose with heavy wounds, to later fully recover with the path of vitality.

Su Ping felt quite gloomy. He realized the survival potential when he just grasped the path of vitality. He didn’t know that the perfect path of vitality would be even more unbelievable; it could revive a person again and again, as long as they weren’t entirely blown up. It could keep them in peak status forever with the help of the power of time.

“You can’t kill me, but I can kill you!”

Lin Xiu noticed that Su Ping was helpless. Even though it was humiliating to be defeated time and again by Su Ping, he had the perfect path of vitality as support, and he was sure that Su Ping would not win a war of attrition.

After all, Su Ping would end up exhaused due to unleashing his full strength constantly!

Su Ping had also realized the flaw, but he didn’t panic. His path of vitality had significantly improved his stamina; adding the power stored in the triple small worlds inside his body, he could endure even if he had to fight for ten days and ten nights. However, a war of attrition was pointless. He wanted to win!

Am I not able to kill him until I fully condense the eighth Astral Painting?

The Astral Painting’s full power can’t be unleashed until all nine Astral Paintings are condensed…

Fighting while training? Wouldn’t that be a little bit disrespectful?

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He thought of a temporary retreat to later kill Lin Xiu after he cultivated the eighth Astral Painting. Still, he feared that the guy would escape after picking up the key.

Even though the continent was shrinking, it would be hard to locate Lin Xiu if he was determined to hide.

Besides, it was unlikely that the guy would just let him go instead of trying to kill him.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He had an extremely costly plan, so he hesitated.

“What are you thinking? Go to hell!!” Lin Xiu roared and slashed. The terrifying power of four extremes had nearly cut apart Su Ping’s body.

Su Ping quickly raised his sword and sliced through Lin Xiu’s law.

There was a boom, and Lin Xiu was cut into halves, which were quickly corrupted by the power of chaos. However, part of his body darted to a place afar and reshaped itself into Lin Xiu’s likeness, who regained his full strength again.

The remains of his old body, corrupted by the power of chaos, was soon reduced to smithereens.

If only my path of illusion were perfect too… Su Ping’s eyes glittered. The path of illusion and the path of chaos seemed to be a perfect match, just like the law of time and the law of space. He stopped thinking and attacked with full strength.

Lin Xiu sneered, but also charged forward.

They fought again and again. There was no way to tell how long it had been, but Qing Hongyue and all the others arrived from the void.

The group was shocked to see that Su Ping and Lin Xiu were still fighting in the void.

They had already finished off Lin Xiu’s six partners before they came. They thought that the battle should end right then. They didn’t expect that the pair would still be fighting after such a long time!

“Lin Xiu has fully cultivated all four supreme laws!”

“Oh, my god!” “That must be the top limit possible for a Star Lord, right?” Both Brian and Calivey realized how terrifying Lin Xiu was; both changed their expressions. As expected of the Star Lord who has cultivated for 100,000 years.

The other top Star Lords’ expressions were also changing. All of them had been dominators in the outside world, being the kind to reach the top of the Divine Lord Rank with ease; even the weakest among them could make it to the top three.

However, they were like normal Star State cultivators when compared with Lin Xiu.

The most terrifying of all, the monstrous genius Lin Xiu seemed to have been suppressed by Su Ping! “These two monsters…” Qing Hongyue didn’t know what to say about that pair of monsters. She had realized that—even though Lin Xiu was the strongest Star Lord she could think of

– he had been absolutely subdued by the young man.

Nevertheless, Su Ping was unable to exterminate him.

As a result, Lin Xiu resurrected again and again, while on the other hand, Su Ping’s path of vitality was imperfect. Even though it was incredible for him to have grasped it, he couldn’t win a war of attrition against Lin Xiu; the outcome of the battle would be hard to predict if they fought on. No wonder they had been fighting for so long.
