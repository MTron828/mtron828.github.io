Chapter 885: Su Jin’er

Upon seeing the outcome, the Star Lord asked the contestants coldly and unsympathetically, “Who’s next?”

His words woke everybody up from their shock; many of them changed their expressions and hesitated.

The Star Lord sneered and ignored them. He simply asked another Star Lord, “Release another one!”

The Star Lord accepted the command. She was also a Star Lord, but obviously a lesser one. She flew over to the continent and stored the brutal Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon. She then took out a bottle and unleashed yet another Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon, which was also an adult, even bigger than the first one!

Someone instantly changed their expression after seeing that.

Many hoped that others would tire out the ferocious beast for them first. However, trying to take advantage of others would not work here. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

While such dragons were rare, there were still tens of thousands of them in Silvy; it would be impossible for them to be used up.

Very soon, another eight or so contestants chose to quit; they didn’t think they would be any stronger than Queen of the Seas.

Holy King looked awful as he too chose to leave. He didn’t expect that Queen of the Seas, his long-time rival, would end up like that. She had a great chance of becoming a Star Lord and dominating a planetary system.

It was terrible for him to see his old rival die. He also realized the cruelty of that world.

The Star Lords outside of the region could have definitely rescued her in time.

There were also Ascendant State experts above them, who could have saved her with a single thought. Still, they simply watched as a genius perished.

It also made him realize that the so-called geniuses that their masters cherished were probably no different from ants when seen by the top bigshots in that vast universe.

They were merely ants with beautiful patterns.

On the other side—the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady, who was the hope of the Holy Oriole Academy—gritted her teeth and also quit. She wasn’t just afraid of the dragon, but also of Su Ping, Dragon Emperor and the Sword God’s heir.

It was hopeless for her to beat those monstrous geniuses in that test.

Therefore, she thought she would be better off by saving some strength to fight for the silver medal.

If she couldn’t get it, she would still become famous if she won third place.

As one contestant after the other backed out, only six people were left on the field, namely Su Ping, Oasis Gray, Dragon Emperor, Linghu Jian, Su Jin’er and Hayalim.

“Which of you will fight first?” asked the Star Lord again.

Linghu Jian stepped up and said coldly, “Me!”

The Star Lord glanced at him and gave him a slight nod.

The region was soon opened; Linghu Jian flew into it, carrying his wooden sword.

Everybody gazed at him; the legendary disciple of an Ascendant State expert had a good chance of winning the competition.

Soon, the battle began in that region.

This time, Linghu Jian didn’t fight with the wooden sword. He summoned his pets and merged with one, using their boost to charge at the Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon.

He drew his sword. It was a glittering silver sword, which was evidently a powerful secret treasure; it carried many flawless laws. Every swing of the sword was able to cut through the void and straight into the tertiary space, even the fourth space at times. Even the dragon’s fire breath could be cut apart too.

The man and the dragon fought crazily; they gradually reached the fifth space and fought there.

The stream viewers were shocked and silent.

He was incredibly strong; as expected of an Ascendant State expert’s disciple who had been hiding his strength.

Those who had been defeated by Linghu Jian were feeling angry and insulted. It wasn’t until that moment that they finally realized that the man didn’t draw his sword because he was being merciful toward them.

They would have died had he drawn the sword; none of them would have resisted any of his attacks!

“The Sword God’s young disciple is rather gifted.”

In the temple, high in the sky, Hai Tuo and the others were watching the battle.

They gave slight nods as the young man fought the ferocious dragon; it was an unusual show of talent, for someone in the Fate State to have grasped such profound sword techniques.

“Sword God got himself a great disciple, one who has understood his techniques when he’s only a Fate State warrior; he’ll be invincible after he reaches the Star State!” said You Ying.

Huan Lieshen looked at him and said, “Are you tempted?”

“Humph.” You Ying snorted and said, “No. I’m only interested in those who have Ascendant potential. Star Lords are just ants to me.”

The battle inside the region had soon ended.

Linghu Jian performed scary sword techniques while in the fifth space, fully carrying the power of laws. Finally, he slew the ferocious dragon.

The battle changed the other contestants’ impression of him; some were scared, and some were in awe.

“Let me!”

Next, the Dragon Emperor stepped up. Another Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon was released.

Dragon Emperor used his full strength. He set up a ten-dragon formation, which was quite splendid; all of the dragons were rare and well-trained. The three main dragons even had A+ aptitudes—although they were early Star State cultivation, they were able to fight against those in the advanced phase!

Dragon Emperor fought fearlessly since he had the support of the ten dragons. His attacks were unstoppable and yet well-controlled.

Soon—after paying a price of three dragons and some minor injuries—Dragon Emperor finally defeated the Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon.

The students in the Dragon Tomb Academy cheered in relief after he secured his victory.

Once Dragon Emperor finished, Oasis Gray also took action; half of his pets were dragons, and their lineup was quite strong. Adding the secret techniques he knew, he was capable of unleashing great power.

However, he had more or less underestimated the Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon. He never knew how horrifying the enemy’s power of laws was until he really fought it; it was highly destructive and corrosive, and he had to back away all the time.

Eventually—after activating his constitution and exposing his secret techniques—he managed to defeat it.

However, he lost half of his pets, and he was also heavily wounded.

Judging from his status, he would not stand a single chance of winning against Linghu Jian or Dragon Emperor without the use of top restoration medications. Even so, he had still won the admiration of the public, and would certainly rank among the top ten.

Oasis Gray seemed to be deeply frustrated once he left the region; he realized the gap between himself and Dragon Emperor. He had always despised the latter, yet he had ended up being slapped in the face. It was utterly frustrating.

“Are you going up?”

At this moment, a pleasant voice was heard close by. Su Ping turned around, only to find that it was the woman named Su Jin’er who was talking to him.

The woman was dressed in an ancient style; she seemed to have kept the old customs from the Blue Planet.

“I’m fine either way,” said Su Ping.

Su Jin’er grimaced and then said to the Star Lord, “I’ll go first then.”

Soon, Su Jin’er entered the region; the woman’s participation in the survival contest had been unremarkable, only gathering ten identity badges.

She didn’t lose in any of the ten battles from the previous round, though. But none of her victories was easy.

Nobody expected her to have the courage to stay after seeing the horrific Ferocious Skull Demon Dragons.

She wasn’t on the popularity ranking, not in the champion prediction ranking.

“Where is this girl from? She’s not bad-looking. Why does she seem so dumb?”

“It makes sense; most beautiful girls are dumb.”

“What bulls*it are you spouting? There are Ascendant State females too. They’ll shut you up permanently if you talk like that!”

“Just ignore them. They’re shamelessly invincible.”

“She seems to be confident. Securing ten victories would have been impossible if she were ordinary; she must have been hiding her strength.”

While everybody whispered, the Star Lord became solemn after seeing Su Jin’er. He then nodded and allowed her to enter the battling region.

The Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon soon took notice of Su Jin’er, and a battle instantly began.

However, Su Jin’er only summoned a battle pet to increase her strength; she then charged at the dragon barehanded.

“She’s so agile!”

She showed great expertise in body movement techniques the moment she attacked, approaching the target like a ghost and slapped it to pierce right into the fifth space, with it extinguishing some of the flames on its body and leaving a deep mark on its skin.

The dragon cried because of the pain, becoming even more brutal afterwards.

Su Jin’er, however, flew like a butterfly and punched every now and then.

It only took five minutes; the dragon collapsed with fist marks all over its body. Its bones and internal organs had been shattered into smithereens.

“What powerful laws! Those bizarre attacks too!”

Linghu Jian and the others were shocked by her performance. The power of laws in the woman’s fist ignored the protection given by the dragon’s scales, going straight into its body. Her every attack had been precise and casual, as if she were just taking a walk.

“Huh?”

Su Ping was just as surprised; she looked at the woman thoughtfully.

The woman had fought as if she could see every weakness, which allowed her to launch critical strikes. Her eyesight and control were so good that even a genius swordsman such as Linghu Jian would be subpar.

There are indeed a lot of geniuses in this vast universe. Su Ping had a solemn attitude. There were many geniuses in Silvy as it was; he wondered what stars would rise in the finals’ stage.

However, he was still confident of winning the championship, even if it would be a lot harder.

Su Jin’er returned; she patted her hands and put on a smile, then winked at Su Ping and returned to her position.

Su Ping realized that the woman was treating him differently for some reason; this made him feel a bit confused, but chose not to think much of it. He was about to step up, when Hayalim addressed the Star Lord first.

That woman had been in first place for a good while during the preliminary phase. Barely fighting in the first ten rounds, all her opponents fell; it was quite weird.

Many believed she had probably grasped enchantment or alluring laws.

Such laws weren’t uncommon, but few were as effective as the ones used by that woman.

A fierce battle started the moment she entered the region.

She summoned her eight pets and fought the dragon in an unhurried manner, and her cooperation with her pets was flawless. They were highly destructive; her pets alone had caused significant damage to the dragon.

She would attack and push the dragon back every time the latter was about to break the pet formation. Then, she would kite it again.

An hour later, the ferocious dragon was finally killed.

Everybody discovered that the woman had nothing amazing except for her precise control over her pets.

Her performance was on the top tier too, but it wasn’t as splendid as that of Dragon Emperor or Linghu Jian.

Was it a mental attack? Her mind suppressed the dragon... Su Ping narrowed his eyes. The prolonged battle allowed him to vaguely detect that the woman had great mental power, which melded into some sort of terrifying Force Field affecting the dragon.

He turned his head, and found that Su Jin’er was also interested in her. Linghu Jian, on the other hand, had an awfully grim look.

At this moment, the Star Lord said to Su Ping, who was the last, “It’s your turn.”

Su Ping withdrew his gaze and gave a slight nod.

He simply flew into the arena.

“Is he the kid who crossed a hundred floors of the all-class monument?”

“I hope I can see something new.”

In the high sky—Hai Tuo and the others looked at him with great interest.

Su Jin’er and Hayalim’s performances had aroused their interest; they thought of recruiting them as disciples.

You Ying’s eyes flashed. He had decided to talk to Hayalim after the match; her mental power and Force Field delighted him. She was exactly his favorite kind of genius.

He detected a brutal power behind that mental pressure.

She was a woman, but she had surely gone through hellish training to obtain such a killing intent.

Su Ping had stepped into the region as they watched, catching the attention of the Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon.

It was a newly-released Ferocious Skull Demon Dragon. Just like the previous ones, it was hovering in the vast sky and enjoying its recovered freedom.

“Come on out,” Su Ping whispered to summon the Inferno Dragon and the white-scaled Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon.

Little White noticed the ferocious dragon the moment it came out; it roared warily as it considered the dragon a threat.

Su Ping didn’t say anything; he simply merged with Little White and left the Inferno Dragon to fight alongside him.

He didn’t plan to summon Little White at the beginning, but since it was also a dragon, it was a good chance for it to learn how to fight other dragons.
