Chapter 417 Nine Seals

The Dark Dragon Hound appeared to be quite different from before. It was still a hound.

But it looked less like a hound.

Its dark fur had become golden and its body was twice its original size. The Dark Dragon Hound was lying on all fours on the ground and it was seven to eight meters tall. But if the Dark Dragon Hound stood up, its height would be at about fifteen meters!

Many thick golden scales covered up the Dark Dragon Hound’s limbs. Its paws were so sharp that they could break boulders.

On the back, it had several sharp spikes that were like many swords.

The Dark Dragon Hound had two huge horns on its head, strange and stunning at the same time.

The Little Skeleton, the Inferno Dragon and the Purple Python went to see the Dark Dragon Hound, looking up and down their friend that they found both strange and familiar.

Su Ping tried to sense the Dark Dragon Hound’s rank at once.

Still, the sixth rank.

First, Su Ping heaved a sigh in relief. Next, he was baffled. Where was the legacy? How come there was no increase in rank? The Dark Dragon Hound opened its eyes. Its dark eyes had turned golden as well. The glow in its eyes was elegant and strangely cold at the same time. That should have been an eye color of cold-blooded animals.

Su Ping walked around the Dark Dragon Hound, twice, but failed to notice anything out of the ordinary.

That was it?

While Su Ping was wondering, a puff of golden light appeared and took the shape of the dragon king. The figure was much thinner than before and appeared to be almost intangible. “I have given thy battle pet my legacy. Thou shalt take care of thy battle pet. Thou shalt not violate thy promise.”

The dragon king’s voice was feeble. “In case thy battle pet’s strength is too much for thee to handle, I have isolated the legacy into different groups.”

“The legacy related to my strength is temporarily sealed inside thy battle pet. There are nine seals and a part of the strength will be freed every time a seal is undone. When all of the nine seals are released, the battle pet will have my full strength. It will be at the peak of the legendary rank. As for reaching the Star Rank, it will be up to thy battle pet’s own efforts!”

“I will teach thee the method to undo the nine seals. Thou can undo the seals accordingly.” “The strength of each seal is different. After the first seal is undone, thy battle pet will reach the eighth rank. Undoing the second seal will bring thy battle pet to the peak of the titled rank. Undoing the third seal can help it reach the legendary rank...”

The dragon king’s soul let out a sudden growl. In the meantime, a streak of golden light was cast over Su Ping.

Su Ping felt some information was being infused into his mind. It was the method to undo the seals as well as what the Dark Dragon Hound could achieve as each layer of seal was removed.

Su Ping had gotten the answer as to why the Dark Dragon Hound’s rank was still the same. The seals were in place to lock in the energy. In a sense, the dragon king’s soul was quite considerate.

Touched, Su Ping said, “You may rest in peace. I will keep my promise.” The dragon king’s soul took a deep breath. “I’m not done yet... ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“My energy was sealed up, but the other part of my legacy, the dragon bloodline and the skills, all of them have been stamped inside your battle pet. Its bloodline is no longer that of the Dark Dragon Hound. Thy battle pet has received my bloodline, that of the Heaven Expansion Dragon. Although the bloodline is not pure, it will help thy battle pet cultivate to the legendary rank without any hindrance.

“Besides, having received my skills, thy battle pet’s wilt became much more powerful than the battle pets of the same rank. I hope you can cherish it!”

The dragon king’s soul was speaking for the sake of the Dark Dragon Hound.

It was as if the dragon king’s soul was afraid that Su Ping would no longer value the Dark Dragon Hound when it was gone. That, of course, was not going to happen. The dragon king’s soul was worrying about nothing.

“Do not worry. The Dark Dragon Hound will always be my battle pet and friend!” Su Ping said. He stressed the last word and for the first time, he was talking to the dragon king’s soul in a serious tone.

The dragon king’s soul gazed at Su Ping and nodded. For the first time, the dragon king’s soul was relieved.

The dragon king’s soul had at one point regretted over choosing this human being but there was nothing it could do. The dragon king’s soul would have to stick with its choice. The good thing was that, while the young man appeared to be indifferent to the other’s lives, he did care about his battle pets.

“This is my soul and your consciousness will be its host for the time being. If you are lucky enough to find the world of dragons, you can take out my soul’s coffin and bury it,” the dragon king’s soul said. A certain hue appeared from behind, which was the mysterious coffin that was shrinking down. By the time the coffin reached Su Ping, it had shrunk to the size of a finger.

Su Ping gave his consent; the coffin merged into Su Ping’s forehead and re-emerged in his consciousness.

Su Ping placed it in a corner of his consciousness. He planned to go back to the store and browse through the list of cultivation sites and see if he could find the world that the dragon king’s soul had mentioned. If he could, he would be able to grant the dragon king’s wish right away.

“You can leave. I want to spend the rest of my time alone in quietness.”

After Su Ping received the coffin, the dragon king’s soul relaxed. The soul thinned down.

Su Ping suddenly felt sad. He gave the dragon king’s soul one last look. A creature that had once been above the legendary rank eventually ended its life in solitude and loneliness.

“You are my inheritor, in some sense... So long, our next meeting will only be postponed indefinitely...”

The dragon king’s soul stared at Su Ping. From its eyes, Su Ping saw a trace of a smile, relief, and liberation. The dragon king’s soul faded away. The golden world gradually turned brighter and brighter.

The thing that could blind a person was darkness.

As well as light.

The glaring light had stopped Su Ping from being able to see anything.

When he opened his eyes again, green vegetation fell into his sight. A gentle breeze was blowing on his face.

This was... outside the Mysterious Realm!

Su Ping was surprised. Su Ping turned around. There should have been an entrance to the Mysterious Realm on the mountain behind him but there was nothing there.

Remembering the dragon king’s last words, Su Ping fell into a moody groove. A moment of silence later, he remembered something all of a sudden. He slapped his thigh. “F*ck, I forgot about the treasures.”

His heart was breaking.

In the next second, he noticed something appeared in his hand.

It was a small, golden silk bag.

Surprised, Su Ping opened the bag and noticed that the bag, like his scroll, was bigger on the inside than the outside. The inside of the bag was a world all its own.

In the bag, he saw all of the treasures that the dragon king’s soul had given him.

Su Ping heaved a sigh in relief.

Good. The treasures were still there.

Su Ping turned around and gave one last look to where the entrance to the Mysterious Realm had once been. He sent an order to the Dark Dragon Hound and told it to get down and bow.

He bowed as well!

Su Ping left the Mysterious Realm. From then on, there would no longer be a dragon king in the world.

A creature that had once been above the legendary rank was gone. Su Ping would try his best to fulfill its last wish.

Su Ping went down the hill. He picked up the residue energy. He reckoned that many people had gathered there before.

Su Ping squinted his eyes. He was right. The Mysterious Realm had been heavily guarded. However, the old man at the legendary rank had failed to anticipate that Su Ping could teleport to the Mysterious Realm directly. The old man was so scheming but his ignorance was the thing that defeated him in the end.

They were here a moment ago. That girl must have come out before me.

Su Ping shook his head. Although she was his competitor to get the legacy, Su Ping believed that the girl had a quite nice talent. He might run into her again someday in the future.

“Doggie, time to go home.”

Su Ping looked at the Dark Dragon Hound, no, the Golden Dragon Hound, which was following him. He jumped onto the Golden Dragon Hound, took the Little Skeleton, the Purple Python and the Inferno Dragon back and patted the hound’s head.

“Go. Show me what you can do.”

“Woof!”

The Golden Dragon Hound was still as joyful as it always was. It barked happily and started to run.
