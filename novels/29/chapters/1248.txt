Chapter 1249 Celestial Experts Arrive

Bang!

Kayafollet snapped two Dao Patterns out of her fingertips, which minced Su Ping’s blade aura like two black dragons; they even split time and space apart as they moved in the void.

“Restrict!”

Kayafollet made use of the small universe she had just gained. It was also one of the Celestial’s most powerful attacks. She didn’t give Su Ping any chance to react, intending to finish the battle as quickly as possible to avoid trouble.

A small universe rose like the moon in the void, carrying a silver brilliance that restricted everything that was nearby.

A dazzling golden light shined and blocked the light as soon as it reached Su Ping. A tall and majestic man walked out of the void at the same time, like a proud ancient emperor. He was none other than Shen Huang!

“Master!”

Su Ping was quite delighted to see Shen Huang, and quickly approached him.

“You…”

Shen Huang looked at Su Ping, only to be surprised. His keen eyes could easily discern that Su Ping was terrifying right then; so much so that probably not even Song Yuan was a match for him.

However, Su Ping was only a Star Lord…

He suddenly raised his eyebrows. Having no time to think, he enshrouded his disciple with the brilliance of his small universe and stared ahead. The void twisted in that direction and a figure appeared with a devilish aura. It was Lin Xiu, the current leader of the Heavenly Devil Alliance!

To be more exact, he was Ye Chen!

Su Ping also saw Ye Chen flashed over and his expression changed. Those Celestials moved as soon as the barrier of the Mayhem Star Zone was destroyed; they had probably been monitoring the region from a vantage point. “Brat!”

Ye Chen looked at Su Ping, his mortal enemy, with excitement in his eyes. “You were bold enough to leave the demonic store before you reached the Celestial State. Haha. Nobody can save you now!”

Su Ping remained cold and silent. Shen Huang glanced at Ye Chen and fixed his eyes on Kayafollet. He asked Su Ping with glittering eyes, “Did she get the legacy?” “Yes,” Su Ping replied telepathically.

“Why is she chasing you?” asked his master. He spread out his senses, and sensed that Song Yuan and the others were safe and on their way over. He instantly told them to stand by for now.

“Because I disrupted her inheritance. The Planet of Origin had some sort of scheme and conspired with the seven local forces. They got the legacy first,” said Su Ping briefly.

Shen Huang narrowed his eyes and realized what had happened. He was somewhat puzzled. Why weren’t Song Yuan and the others the ones aiming to stop her? Why was it Su Ping instead?

He had made his own speculations after feeling Su Ping’s aura, but it didn’t matter at the moment. Their primary concern was to get out of that place.

“Saint Heir, the Planet of Origin is the center of the Federation. This devil from the age of deities has raised a universal war since his rebirth. Countless people are mired in chaos and disaster. This is a rare opportunity… Why don’t we work together and suppress him to end this catastrophe?” Shen Huang asked Kayafollet.

Kayafollet stopped and looked at Su Ping who was being protected by Shen Huang. She said coldly, “That’s none of my business; you may discuss with the saints. Hand over your disciple, and I promise that I won’t interfere with your battle.”

She wasn’t an idiot. The battle between Ye Chen and Shen Huang was inevitable; the side she chose would be of critical importance. She could propose demands.

Ye Chen felt relieved after hearing her answer. He flashed a cold smile and said, “Stop struggling. If you want to control the war, you’d better admit defeat right now and give me your troublesome little disciple. I’ll spare your life for now!”

Shen Huang frowned and gazed at Kayafollet. “Saint Heir, this devil has been brutalizing people left and right; his goal is to conquer the universe. The Planet of Origin will be caught in the war sooner or later… Are you simply going to let him have what he wants? I’ve known the leaders of your planet for hundreds of thousands of years. Can’t we take care of this great enemy first? As for this little disciple of mine, I’ll ask him to apologize to you later.”

Ye Chen turned cold since he was being ignored.

Kayafollet said expressionlessly, “I’m still young and I don’t know you; I only want your little disciple. Or maybe you can kill him yourself; then I may consider lending a hand.”

Ye Chen raised his eyebrows and looked at the woman with a killing aura in his eyes. It was well hidden though; it would be better to avoid making another enemy unless it was necessary.

Shen Huang frowned and said, “Even though this little disciple of mine is naughty, he is kindhearted in nature. He’s willing to publicize the technique to cultivate multiple small worlds and help all the geniuses in the universe. He’s also a rare genius himself; it would be a shame if he died just like that.”

Kayafollet sneered. “Whatever kind of genius he is, he’s nothing in front of me. I’ve acquired the legacy of the universe dominator. I will surely rise to the top of the universe given enough time. I will be the only queen of the universe!”

Shen Huang was silent. He could tell that she was dead set on killing his disciple. It was partly because Su Ping had disturbed her during the inheritance, but his unparalleled talent gave her a sense of unease.

She would never be able to sleep in peace again if she didn’t kill such a genius after crossing him!

Shen Huang glanced at Su Ping and heaved a sigh after giving it some thought. He said to Su Ping telepathically, “I might not be able to stop them if they join hands. Can you ask the experts in your store to help out?”

Su Ping felt dazed, realizing what his master meant. His face changed somewhat, but tried to reply calmly, “Master, we’re too far away. I cannot summon them unless we return to the Celestial Court.”

Shen Huang couldn’t help but ask, “Is it really impossible?”.

Su Ping stared at him and replied honestly, “Yes, it truly is.”

He didn’t know what his master would do after such an answer. Would Master give me up, or…

“We’ll have to fight our way back then,” said Shen Huang, heaving another sigh.

Slightly stunned, Su Ping gazed at the back of the man defending him. He wasn’t as deeply bonded to Shen Huang as the rest of his disciples were; after all, they hadn’t been together for long. They were only master and disciple in name.

“Have you made your decision?” Kayafollet said and looked at Shen Huang coldly, “Don’t blame me for attacking you if you don’t hand him over!”

Shen Huang seemed to have sobered up. While looking at her cold expression, he suddenly smiled and revealed a powerful aura, then said, “I only showed you respect because you just rose to the Celestial State and became a peer. You’re the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin and acquired a great treasure today. And yet, instead of considering the big picture for the good of the universe, you’re attacking for selfish reasons. Is my disciple so talented that your heart is in a knot and you don’t know what’s right or wrong?”

Kayafollet changed her expression and demanded furiously, “Do you want to make an enemy of the Planet of Origin?”

Shen Huang looked down at her and said, “You’re not qualified to represent the Planet of Origin. I would advise you to call your Saint King to handle things!”

“You!”

Kayafollet was infuriated.

She would surely become a universe dominator one day, thanks to the legacy. It would take no more than a millennium, which was the blink of an eye for a Celestial.

Being ignored by that senior exasperated her. She wanted to unleash the legacy’s invincible power to suppress him.

At that moment-an old man’s voice sounded in the void, belying a smile, “I might as well show up, Shen Huang, since you’ve asked me to.”

White light appeared next to Kayafollet and gathered to form a white-haired old man.

The elder was wearing a white robe, while emitting a sacred aura.

Shen Huang’s expression changed, deep fury shown in his eyes. “Saint King, what’s the meaning of this?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Nothing. It just seemed that you were bullying the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin, so I made an appearance to support her,” said the old man with a smile.

Shen Huang said angrily, “We’ve known each other for 100,000 years. Are you really going to throw that aside?”

“I’m the one who raised the Saint Heir. She’s like my daughter, which weighs more than our friendship. If she wants your little disciple’s life, just give it to her. Is our 100,000-year friendship weaker than the bond between you and your little disciple which has only existed for a few decades?” asked the old man.

Shen Huang wore an awful expression, not expecting their friendship to be as flimsy as paper.

Ye Chen realized what was going on and laughed in delight. “Haha. That’s right. You’ve been friends for 100,000 years, and yet you’re unwilling to surrender your little disciple. How shameless!”

Shen Huang was gloomy; he was too angry to argue with them. They all knew what was on the table, which made him feel sad. A 100,000 year friendship was nothing. He thought that his ‘friend’ would stand on his side and discipline the Saint Heir. Not once did he expect that the other would side with her without hesitation.

It did make sense though; she was the Saint Heir anyway.

However, the guy had turned a blind eye to truth and justice.

“Do you fear my little disciple that much?” asked Shen Huang coldly after a long silence. “Nobody is going to hurt him today as long as I’m still here. It’s been hundreds of thousands of years since we fought for real. Let’s have another battle today, and see if our blood is as hot as before!”

The Saint King narrowed his eyes a bit, then said, “Are you truly going to sacrifice yourself for your little disciple? You don’t stand a chance of winning against the three of us. Your disciple is supported by the demonic store; you’re just his master in name, not a true master. Not once has he meant it whenever he’s called you master.

“You will even end up beneath him when he grows up. It might be possible that he’ll become your master in the future!”

Shen Huang gazed at him coldly and said, “You’re not wrong. However, I will ensure his safety in this life since he called me master. At least I won’t let him die while I’m here!”

“You should die before his eyes then!” Ye Chen sneered; he couldn’t wait to attack.

“Even though you’re a Celestial, you haven’t realized yet that nothing except yourself is who truly matters!” The Saint King shook his head.

“Think carefully. I will surely become a universe dominator when I fully grasp the legacy, which won’t take too long. It’ll be a thousand years at most; what you said today might get you killed in a thousand years!” said Kayafollet coldly.

Shen Huang stared at her and said, “Give my disciple a thousand years if you’re truly bold; he might catch up with you!”

“You!” Kayafollet was furious; that was exactly the source of her anger. She was determined to kill Su Ping because she was afraid she wouldn’t have the chance a thousand years later. Even though it was impossible for someone to become a universe dominator in a thousand years, Su Ping could work a miracle since he had the mysterious demonic store.

“Let’s have them die together since he’s determined to protect his little disciple!” Ye Chen suddenly took action and charged at Shen Huang, unleashing a devilish aura.

Shen Huang’s eyes exuded coldness. He was shrouded in golden brilliance like the sun. He dashed out in the next moment, choosing to flee instead.

He wasn’t stubborn; he had to retreat because he was outnumbered.

Whoosh!

A glow attacked him from the side as he turned around. It was a move from the Saint King.

Shen Huang changed his expression and looked at the man in shock and fury, not expecting his good friend to sneak up on him! The attack was unexpectedly fast. He swung his fist at it.

The Saint King was prepared, though. He had a short dagger in hand, which looked like a crescent moon. It pierced through Shen Huang’s fist aura and went into his small universe.

Shen Huang’s small universe instantly started to crack; Su Ping experienced a massive earthquake since he was inside it. He looked at the scene outside in shock and fury. The Saint King had snuck up on his master, even though they had the advantage in numbers!

“You’re just as stubborn as before!” The Saint King sighed with pity on his face, but his attacks were ferocious. Shen Huang was covered in dazzling glow.

Kayafollet also took action. She flashed to Shen Huang’s back and closed her hands, swinging a whip made with Dao Glyphs.

“Is it really appropriate for this many of you to gang up on him?”

Exactly at this moment-a flame arose and blocked the Dao Glyphs attack.

Chi Huo—with long red hair and surrounded by a fierce fire-emerged and stood in front of Shen Huang, looking down at Kayafollet. “You are the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin. How can you be this shameless?”

Kayafollet’s expression changed as she gnashed her teeth. “Get out of my way! Is the Red Fire Star Zone going to meddle in this too?”

“I should be the one asking you that question. When did the Planet of Origin become so shameless? Not only did you come here to snatch the legacy, you even attacked us instead of the devil who is disrupting the order of the universe.” Chi Huo pushed out two fiery Dao Glyphs that forced Kayafollet to move back.

“It’s great that you’ve come here. You’re not going anywhere!” While looking at Chi Huo, Ye Chen said to Kayafollet with brutality in his eyes, “Keep him occupied. We’ll finish off that guy first and then kill the brat for you while we’re at it.”
