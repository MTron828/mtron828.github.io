Chapter 1081: Gods’ Trial

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

He’s condensed a perfect path with a Star State cultivation…

Diaz looked at Shuai Qianhou, and felt quite helpless.

He thought that his master had just recruited a random guy, but his new junior turned out to be a monster.

He hadn’t even caught up to Su Ping yet, and an even more unbelievable genius had emerged!

The others changed their expressions too; they even felt ashamed of themselves.

They had just been humiliated by Su Ping, and the new guy was here to humiliate them again. They thought they didn’t deserve to have the same master…

“Are you Su Ping?” said Shuai Qianhou once he noticed Su Ping’s gaze; he smiled casually, as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Although he was just a Star Lord, he seemed to be as extraordinary as the Ascendant State experts.

He had seen too many geniuses during his past fifty thousand years cultivating. All of them were as brilliant as stars, but then they fell as quickly as meteors.

Having seen too many changes, he was already used to it, as if all the changes were constant.

Su Ping snapped out of his deep thinking and nodded.

He hesitated for a moment, but then held back.

After all, it would seem too rude to ask the guy about his family name upon their first encounter.

Seeing that Su Ping was hesitating, Shuai Qianhou smiled. “I’ve heard a lot about you, Senior Brother Su. You condensed a small world in the Fate State. That’s a remarkable achievement in the history of the universe…”

He paused for a moment and added, “Do you want to ask me how to grasp a perfect path? Let’s talk sometime. There’s something I’d like to share with you.”

He voluntarily acted in a friendly manner towards Su Ping.

After all, they had the same master. He did have to keep his pride, but he thought that people like Su Ping were worthy of his respect.

Given enough time, if Su Ping reached the Ascendant State, there would be a good chance that he would become a Heavenly Lord.

He always believed in making friends with those who were on par with him.

He wasn’t like that in the past.

It’s just that all his old friends chose to alienate him because of their gap; they became his subordinates, or even strangers. Then, he learned the importance of making the right kind of friends.

“Okay, that’ll be great.”

Su Ping thought for a moment, but didn’t explain. They weren’t too close yet; it was better to ask that question later.

The nearby Diaz and the others looked at him with envy and jealousy.

Shuai Qianhou had not talked with any of them when he arrived at the temple earlier. Even though Diaz had one of the best constitutions of the universe, he didn’t catch any of his attention.

Su Ping, on the other hand, made the guy express his friendliness since the former had condensed a small world while still in the Fate State.

I didn’t know we would be despised someday…

All of them wept in their hearts. They had been left out from Shuai Qianhou and Su Ping’s circle, exactly as how they had rejected others from their own circles.

All of them sighed, and hoped that they could get the true god’s legacy.

If that came to pass, they wouldn’t have to bend before anyone ever again!

Shuai Qianhou smiled and remained silent afterwards. He stood quietly in the temple.

Shen Huang smiled too. Both Su Ping and Shuai Qianhou were disciples he thought highly of. Su Ping was famous throughout the universe, but not for long. Shuai Qianhou, on the other hand, had passed his test and trained for 50,000 years. No one knew how strong he had become.

Maybe he had further stretched the upper limits of the Star Lord State again.

“Since you’re all here, let’s talk about the trial,” said Shen Huang slowly.

Everybody became serious and fixed their eyes upon Shuai Qianhou once the latter started talking.

“The gods’ trial was prepared by the twelve Celestial State experts. It consists of three parts: the first part is our test for you. You must pass our test in order to enter the real trial.

“The test is mainly intended to filter out the participants who have gotten here by pulling strings,” said Shen Huang.

Everybody was silent.

It was impossible to keep the trial a secret; a lot of organizations in the universe would want to participate. Not even the twelve Celestials could stop them all.

Those organizations might not have Celestials in their ranks, but there were so many of them that they couldn’t be stopped unless the Celestials suppressed them heartlessly.

The Celestials didn’t want to overdo things, so the best solution was to allow some of them to participate. Then, those people would be their allies, and oppose the others who wanted to participate in the treasure hunt.

Still, the Celestials were obviously ruthless. Those people would be filtered out when they outlived their usefulness in the first test!

After all, the real elites and geniuses in the universe were all under the command of Celestial State experts.

Those people would eventually fight for the last opportunity.

Those who weren’t supported by a Celestials weren’t even qualified to join the game!

“Once you pass the first test, you will then go through the next two tests, which were both set up by the true god. We’ve managed to figure out the content of the tests via several means.

“That true god was from the Divine Qin Dynasty. If you’re familiar with the history of the universe, you should know that it was one of the most powerful dynasties back in the ancient times!

“Therefore, the second test is one about willpower. You will enter a place similar to the Sea of Illusions.”

Shen Huang glanced at Su Ping as he talked.

Su Ping was stunned for a moment. Did the Loulan family invite him to the Sea of Illusions because of his master? Did his master give a silent approval, or did he somehow ask the Loulan family to train him for the test?

Su Ping thought that it was quite possible, as he remembered how Senior Brother You Long had shown up.

After all, Senior Brother You Long’s timing was perfect when he made his appearance.

“However, it’s worth mentioning that even those whose willpower isn’t good may still pass the test,” said Shen Huang slowly, “There are some special hideouts, or keepsakes, that will let you pass the test the moment you acquire them.”

Su Ping was puzzled by that piece of information.

It sounded awfully contradictory.

If the second test was about willpower, why were such places set up?

If those whose willpower was weak could pass the test, would the best successor truly come from among them?

Su Ping looked around, and saw that Shuai Qianhou was frowning too; he seemed to be thinking along the same lines.

Shen Huang glanced at them and smiled. “You’re not wrong; it’s indeed rather weird. However, we discovered later that you need luck, instead of strength, to acquire those keepsakes!”

“Luck?”

“You should know that everything in the universe has its own laws. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Living creatures on every planet operate based on their own laws. Galaxies stand in the universe with laws; everything lives and dies abiding by laws.

“However, there are some beings in the universe who have fallen to the corners of laws; those people can usually avoid many dangers. For instance, it’s a law to age and die, but if you’re in a corner of the law, you’ll be able to dodge or slow it.

“If an enemy is prepared to kill you a thousand kilometers away, you would be ambushed and killed by the law of nature. However, if you’re found in the corners of laws and you don’t follow laws, you turn around and leave. Then, the danger is no more!

“We call such beings the blessed.”

Everybody was somewhat puzzled by what their master had shared with them.

In simpler terms, they’re just lucky dogs, right? Lucky dogs actually evade the laws of the universe.. That’s really…?Su Ping was shocked too.
