Chapter 1261 Self-Destruction (2)

The Little Skeleton’s body shook, but the flames in its eyes burned even brighter. A gate opened in the void behind him; thousands of skeleton knights holding bronze spears charged out and moved towards the two Celestials like well-trained troops.

At the same time—the bloody Heavenly Tribulation descended and wreathed the skeleton in a lightning hell.

Su Ping clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. He suddenly dashed out; his weakened and heavily-wounded body unleashed an immense power.

His eight small worlds appeared like wheels of light. Then, the first small world collapsed.

Su Ping’s aura rose to the peak while filled by the exuberant power. That was the strongest condition he had ever been in.

He then extended his hands and forcefully threw both the Inferno Dragon and young Chaos Beast into the pet space.

“I won’t let you die.” Su Ping’s eyes were firm and cold. He stepped forward and stood next to the Little Skeleton. He said softly while looking at the red flames in his pet’s eyes, “You should go inside too once the tribulation is over. I will protect you this time. I am certain that you will avenge me in the future.”

The red flames in the Little Skeleton’s eyes hopped unpredictably as if buffeted by the wind. It said hoarsely, “Master, please don’t do this.”

“Be obedient.”

Su Ping smiled with the unusual affection in his eyes. He gently waved his hands and said, “Focus on your tribulation. I will protect

you!”

He then stepped forward. Gales were blowing in the void, making Su Ping’s hair flutter. Dark cracks appeared as he moved; the void seemed to be falling apart under his feet.

“I haven’t reached the Ascendant State yet, but I can still fight you with my Star Lord level!”

Su Ping’s voice was soft but extremely cold. His gentle and affectionate eyes turned as sharp as the edge of a sword. He gazed at the two Celestials with glacial intent. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The next moment, the small world behind him exploded!

This time it was the eighth small world, the last one and the most powerful he had cultivated!

“It doesn’t matter if I can’t embark on an unprecedented path. I can still fight you with seven small worlds when I rise to the Ascendant State!”

An indescribable stream of power surged out as his small world exploded, then dissipated as consumed by a black hole. The entire world fell quiet at that moment.

An ancient and distant aura emanated from Su Ping’s body. Such an aura belonged to the ancient mythical creatures gone ages before. It was the original power of the universe when it was created!

Mo Ri and Ye Chen slightly changed their expressions as they looked at Su Ping with shock and suspicion. The man was only a Star Lord, and yet they still found him threatening at the moment.

The Little Skeleton immediately realized what Su Ping was doing. It couldn’t help but shout coarsely, “Master!”

Su Ping was going to follow the skeleton’s steps. He was going to rise to the Ascendant State!

However, he wasn’t choosing the optimal way, but the next best thing.

Su Ping had chosen to detonate the eighth small world and rise to the Ascendant State with seven small worlds. It was impossible to have a normal breakthrough with eight small worlds. He could only lower the bar.

At least he would be stronger with the advance. He would then be capable of fighting them.

Since he was dying, why bother thinking about potential and prospects? Su Ping quickly condensed a path to the Ascendant State, as the painstakingly created eighth small world collapsed. There was an instant effect; he sensed that heaven and earth were calling to him.

The calling of the Ascendant State! Have the heavens finally acknowledged me? Well, well!

There was sadness and mockery in Su Ping’s eyes. Not once did he sense a thing when he had eight small worlds, but now it was possible, after destroying one of them.

It’s a shame that I don’t have enough time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have cared one bit about your acknowledgment! Su Ping gave an ominous look at the gathering clouds. Brown lightning could be vaguely seen among the dark red clouds. He glanced at the two Celestials with a cold smile.

“Come and fight me!”

“You’re asking to be killed!”

Both Ye Chen and Mo Ri had grim expressions. They had been more or less doubtful about Su Ping’s level earlier on; after all, for a Star Lord that strong to exist was impossible. However, the tribulation proved that Su Ping’s level was real.

A Star Lord stronger than any Heavenly Lord…

And now, he was rising to the Ascendant State.

“You must die!” Mo Ri’s eyes were as sharp as sabers. He summoned two enormous pets. One of them was a shining and colorful dragon, while the other was a bird whose wings carried a deathly aura. They charged at Su Ping

Both were Celestial pets, but they were clearly not as strong as their master.

The tribulation became even more violent as they entered the fray. Bloody lightning bolts struck the two creatures, but were blocked easily.

Even the bloody lightning bolts could cause them little damage, given their level.

“Get lost!”

Su Ping wasn’t relying on the tribulation’s power. He suddenly roared like thunder, not only taunting those pets, but also the Heavenly Tribulation!

He wasn’t interested in such a test!

The packed clouds surged and seemed to be dissipating after the roar. However, a pillar of lightning struck down as if ready to pierce the earth, seemingly gathering the power of all the lightning bolts.

The entire world was illuminated for a moment.

The people who witnessed that from the City of Sins even forgot to breathe. Their hearts skipped a beat, thinking that such a lightning strike was enough to raze the entire city!

Bang!

Su Ping was struck heavily; his head lowered a bit due to the lightning’s power. However, he struggled to raise his head and absorbed the tribulation’s power. His body went through a rapid evolution.

However, Su Ping was well aware that he would barely be able to defend himself with Ascendant power and seven small worlds when facing two Celestials. Killing them was out of the question, his power would be insufficient!

Bang!

The worlds behind Su Ping’s back exploded; one by one, from the second small world to the fifth. The noise from the blasts shocked the world.

What followed was the rise of Su Ping’s terrifying aura, making him look like a mythical creature. He suddenly drew his sword and slashed at Ye Chen.

His horrifying sword was filled with the power of three Dao Glyphs. He had been unable to make use of them and had to make do by parsing them into Dao Patterns. Now though, he was able to harness the power of three primitive Dao Glyphs at the same time!

A storm of sword auras was swept out. Somehow time and space in all the universe seemed to have solidified. Sword auras fell and eclipsed all the stars; Ye Chen widened his eyes in disbelief.

Bang, bang, bang, bang!

A golden bell flew out of Ye Chen’s body and collapsed. A tiger-shaped soul rushed out of his armor and roared, only to be destroyed by the unstoppable sword auras.

The sword slash reached his chest in the end. Blood gushed out and the armor was shattered!

Ye Chen was sent flying hundreds of thousands of kilometers away. He vanished as a black spot, his status unknown!

Mo Ri was appalled. He saw that Su Ping swung his sword again and launched another attack that was equally terrifying.

He quickly waved his sleeves, and three illusory black holes appeared around him. The sword auras destroyed two of them, but were twisted in front of the third and brushed past Mo Ri, unable to hit him. There was a boom; the City of Sins’ ground was torn apart, turning into an infinitely-stretching ravine!

Countless buildings were destroyed, with endless casualties.

“That brat…” Mo Ri looked at the ravine and slightly narrowed his eyes. He took a deep breath, knowing that it would be hard to get rid of Su Ping without using his real skills.

As a dark and round small universe appeared; Mo Ri’s aura was multiple times stronger. The Nether Saber in his hand was radiating power. There seemed to be a red python charging at Su Ping.

“Master, don’t…”

The Little Skeleton’s hoarse voice echoed behind Su Ping. In the next moment-along with the bloody light—the Little Skeleton suddenly passed Su Ping and slashed the red python’s head.
