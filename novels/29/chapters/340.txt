Chapter 342 Elementary Rules of Thunder

The sudden change visibly surprised the flesh-like mountain of fire. The monster had become bored since the two little things were only using the same skills. It was quite the surprising turn of events this time.

Bang!

Again, the monster waved its thick arm, which was surrounded by intense flames, and attacked the massive wolf that had been formed with Dark Hellfire.

The Dark Hellfire wolf howled and suddenly jumped to the other side of the monster. The wolf opened its mouth and took a bite of the monster.

The fangs made with burning flames were sharp and fierce; they burned into the bloated body of the massive beast.

The monster shouted. It must have felt pain. Abruptly, the monster breathed out profound, blood-colored flames which then took the shape of a hand that grabbed the neck of the wolf and pinched.

The wolf was torn into pieces, which seemed to have hurt the Dark Dragon Hound as well. It let out a miserable cry. Blood began to ooze from the Dark Dragon Hound’s face, giving a horrifying and tragic look to it.

Roar!!

The Dark Dragon Hound became even crazier. Flames converged once more and another wolf dashed out!

The Inferno Dragon unleashed the Roaring Dragon Flames at the same time. In the meanwhile, a ray of blazing light emerged from the monster’s chest area. The ray of light pierced through the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound almost instantly. Again, the two pets died on the spot! “Revive!”

Su Ping had been paying full attention to the situation. He brought his pets back to life without delay. There was a glow of excitement in his eyes. The change in the Dark Dragon Hound’s skill clearly signaled an upgrade in the original skill. The strange thing was that the wolf formed by the Dark Hellfire could jump around as if it were under certain control.

Generally speaking, most energy attacks would only target fixed points. Only some rare energy skills had tracking and adjusting abilities. However, the Dark Dragon Hound’s skill was even more complicated than the simple tracking feature. The wolf knew how to avoid strikes!

It seemed to have intelligence.

Su Ping couldn’t understand the underlying mechanism. The Dark Dragon Hound probably was the only one who knew about it.

Repeated practice is working!

To unleash the same skill for a thousand times, ten thousand times, and even for a hundred times, there is bound to be some change. The pets will understand that skill better!

Su Ping felt exhilarated after such an inspiration. He had found a way to learn Strengthening as part of the trainer mission the system had assigned to him. Apart from the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound’s offensive skills, Su Ping could strengthen their defensive skills as well!

Two hours later.

Roar!

The monster suddenly shouted, slapping the Dark Dragon Hound and Inferno Dragon to death; then, it turned into a ball of flames that quickly rolled away, smashing all the surrounding boulders and rocks. Soon, that monster disappeared. Su Ping stood there, astounded. What...?

Did the monster just run away?!

A beast at the legendary level ran away?!

People would never believe this.

Su Ping felt speechless. But he understood that the monster must have been fed up with the revivals.

It couldn’t kill the two pets but it could escape.

Su Ping felt disappointed. He was hoping that the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon could have developed further until the monster died.

The monster truly deserved to be at the legendary level. During the past two hours, the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon had been progressing fast, and yet, they still didn’t stand a chance to survive in front of that monster. “Let’s go. This time, you should join them.” Su Ping had the Purple Python go where the Dark Dragon Hound was. Having figured out the solution had delighted Su Ping. What he needed to do next was to force his pets to keep on practicing Both the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon cast an annoyed look at Su Ping. They had become severely traumatized after the two hours passed, both mentally and physically. True, they would be full of energy after each revival. However, the fatigue on their minds due to all the battling was not going away. They just wanted to have some rest. Su Ping could tell that they were tired thanks to the contract, which would convey their moods directly to him.

Still, the more tired they were, the more likely they would find inspiration.

No path toward strength was easy.

Su Ping knew that the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound still had some strength left. He could keep on pressing them.

Su Ping gave his order. The Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound had to keep moving. But they would whine occasionally as they moved along the way.

Time flew past.

Several days went by.

Su Ping, together with the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon came out from the location. The two gods guarding outside could sense some stunning changes in both Su Ping and his pets after merely three days.

In particular, Su Ping’s pets changed the most.

Each of his pets was at the moment giving out a profound and fierce energy, as if they had been training in hell. It was hard to imagine that they would become like this after three days.

The two were stunned still.

Su Ping stood at the head of the Purple Python and said to the two with a smile, “Thank you for waiting here. Let’s go back.” The two darted a glance at the battle pet that had a very low-rank bloodline. Usually, they would never take a second look at such pets. However, the pungent smell of blood caught their attention this time.

They soon came back to their senses. The one with the golden hair replied with a smile, “Brother Su, have you finished your training? I believe this was a rewarding trip for you.” “It was okay...” Su Ping said.

He waved his hand and several swirls appeared.

The Inferno Dragon, the Dark Dragon Hound as well as the Purple Python went back inside.

The smell of blood and killing intent in the area was instantly weakened. Su Ping waved his hands again and the swirls closed and disappeared.

The two gods covered up Su Ping with an energy shield. Instantly, they disappeared on the spot. That was a skill that could only be mastered by people at the legendary rank. Su Ping went back to the city and directly re-emerged at Joanna’s residence. During the past three days, Su Ping had never seen the most terrifying beast that he heard about but he had encountered a fair share of beasts at the legendary rank or even above.

Luckily for him, the most powerful beast he had met didn’t bother attacking him, saving him some energy points that he would have to spend on revivals.

“I’m back.”

Standing next to Joanna was a girl who appeared to be a secretary. Joanna came out of her room and took a look at Su Ping. She immediately noticed the unusual glow around him.

“Let’s go back. How are the customers’ pets now?”

“All taken care of.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Good. You never let me down.”

Joanna didn’t reply to that comment; naturally, she would deliver all her promises. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be the ruler of that place.

Su Ping waited while Joanna brought back the customers’ battle pets. Then, they went back to the store.

There was no light outside. It had to be nighttime.

Su Ping did some calculations about the time. He went to the cultivation site in the afternoon and stayed for a couple of days there. Indeed, it should be some time after dark.

He should have stayed in the cultivation site for a couple of more days. A ten-hour night in the real world would be 10 days in the cultivation site.

Huh, I think I’m aging a bit faster now that I’ve spent so much time in cultivation sites.

Su Ping turned on the lights and looked into the mirror. Leaping into his sight was a perfect face. There were some signs of tiredness amid his flawless facial features, a melancholic glow in his eyes, and his growing facial hair was sexy. He couldn’t be more handsome.

He exclaimed to himself. Admiring his own looks was the only time he could receive some comfort.

He dug out a saber that he had found in the Mysterious Realm and used it to shave. Ah, what a handsome youth.

Su Ping admired his looks from different angles and everything was perfect.

Then, he thought of the issue he was wondering about just then. Out in the real world, only an afternoon had passed. However, his body had experienced days in the cultivation site. Su Ping believed that at this rate, when his ID showed that he was 19, his body would have grown to the age of 20 already.

Maybe, when he reached his twenties, his body would be in his thirties and when he was around thirty years old, his body would be as old as forty or fifty...

Goodness!

How terrifying was that!!

Su Ping was afraid to chase after that train of thought.

Usually, people lose their hair when they are working hard. I’m losing my youth instead! This cannot go on. I admit that I will still be handsome even when I become old. But all the girls love youthful boys. I’m in the prime state of my looks!

Su Ping paced up and down in the store, worried. All of a sudden, he remembered the explorer’s warehouse. Of the herbs sold there, there was something called Look Preservation fruit.

That was sold at more than a million merit points.

In terms of astral coins, the price would be over ten million!

Buy it!

Su Ping logged onto the website, quickly found that fruit and the description soothed his mood. Indeed, the fruit could retain his youthful look.

He paid and the fruit was now his

as no

Su Ping placed the order and all he needed to do was to wait for the fruit to arrive.

“Done!”

Happily, Su Ping closed the website. Men should be generous enough to invest in their looks.

“Ding!”

“The host’s pets have ‘strengthened skills’.

“Mission progress (Elementary Trainer), 10%. The host can draw the first prize and shall do so within the next three minutes.”

The system’s sudden interjection startled Su Ping.

Su Ping’s eyes glowed after the system finished reporting. He never knew that he would get a chance to draw a prize right then. He had the idea that he would have to finish the entire mission first.

At the same time, that was another sign that the mission was difficult, even though it merely said “elementary trainer.”

To the system, Su Ping was still a green hand.

The familiar rotating disc emerged in front of Su Ping.

“Start!”

Without further ado, Su Ping started.

He waited for a moment before he shouted ‘stop’. The disc gradually stopped, pointing at a certain book.

Elementary Rules of Thunder

Su Ping looked at the book in confusion. Rules of Thunder?

What did it mean?

“Please pick up the prize,” the system reminded him.

“Ok.”

“Instant application, yes or no?”

“Yes.”

The book transformed into a puff of energy that flew to his forehead, just like when he had absorbed other skill books in the past.

He anticipated that there would be a great surge of information but he was still stunned.

The amount of information was massive!

The first thing entering his mind was a sudden clap of thunder that was louder than anything he had heard before. At that moment, he felt the only thing left in the world was that clap of thunder!

Afterward, it had an aura that was primitive and sophisticated.

As the continuous surges of information kept arriving, Su Ping saw a figure that was surrounded by bolts of lightning, mumbling something in an ancient language

He could hear the voice but he didn’t understand the words; at the same time he could understand some of the meaning.
