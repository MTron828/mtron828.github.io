Chapter 1503: Dragon Prison! (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Hun Yu Clan, what’s the meaning of this?” said one of the dragons with a deafening voice, reaching all the members of the Hun Yu Clan.

Sensing the hostile attitude, Su Ping narrowed his eyes and stepped out and said, “We bear no ill will, and we’re not related to the Hun Yu Clan; we only represent ourselves. We’d like to apologize if we offended you, but I don’t think we did anything offensive.”

Both of the great dragons shifted their gazes from the pets to him. Su Ping had an Undying State cultivation anyway; he was one of the influential people, even in the tribes of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors.

“The Primitive Chaos Clan?”

The two dragons had glittering eyes, already knowing of that clan’s demise. They were the Heaven’s first target, and were completely wiped out.

It was surprising to see a survivor. It was true that not all rumors could be trusted.

“They’re your subordinates? You may well be a survivor of the Primitive Chaos Clan, but your subordinates offended us, which is punishable by death!” said one of the dragons.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and replied, “I just said that we didn’t mean to offend you. If you consider resisting your dragon might is an offense, don’t you think it’s a bit too domineering?”

“That’s the rules of our clan. As someone in the Undying State, you should know that!” said one of the dragons with anger and dissatisfaction.

“Those are the rules of your clan; they only apply to your clansmen. We have our rules too, one is to never bend or yield!” Su Ping gazed at the host dragons with cold eyes. They were indeed seeking an alliance, but he didn’t want to back down.

What he needed was to be treated as equals, not to be bossed around.

“They carry the bloodlines of dragons, so they have to abide by the rules of the Original Dragons!”

One of the dragons said furiously, “All dragons derive from the Original Dragons. Have your seniors never told you that?”

“Even so, they carry other bloodlines too. Even if they’re dragons, they weren’t raised by you, nor do they have to follow your rules,” said Su Ping.

“How talkative!”

One of the dragons became angry. “Don’t come to us if you don’t follow our rules. You would also be punished, if not for the fact that your clan was destroyed and your contribution to the resistance against the Heavens!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Su Ping’s heart felt heavy. He didn’t expect those dragons to be so strict about rules. The mere unwillingness to kneel was already a major offense. Such a hierarchical system was terrible.

“Please don’t be angry.”

The colorful bird didn’t expect to have a conflict with the Original Dragons that quickly. She quickly said, “Perhaps they had no knowledge about those rules. Please forgive their first offense; I’ll ask them to apologize.”

She also said to Su Ping telepathically, “Make your subordinates kneel and apologize right now. Break their horns and hand them over; then they’ll probably let us off.”

Su Ping was stunned. He was so angry he could almost laugh.

However, it was clear that she was sincerely trying to help him, although the price was rather hilarious.

“Sorry. They’re not just my subordinates; they are my friends, and I never make things difficult for my friends. They have their rules, and I have mine; the Original Dragons’ rules aren’t the only things that matter!” replied Su Ping telepathically.

The massive bird was stunned, not expecting Su Ping to turn down her offer so decisively. She didn’t think he had any reason to refuse.?Subordinates? Friends? Could subordinates really be friends?

Besides, there was a major level gap between them.

It was just a realm, but the difference in power was enormous.?How could they be friends?

“You… Don’t be stupid. Where else can you go if you offend the Original Dragons? If you go and search another clan, you’ll probably encounter the Heavens on the way, and you’ll definitely die,” the colorful bird tried to persuade him again. She really didn’t want anything to happen to Su Ping; after all, he had done his best to help them, even though he didn’t have to. She remembered the favor.

“I know.”

Su Ping looked at the two dragons in the sky. Their oppressive and condescending aura was all too familiar. He suddenly felt sad.

Equality would never be an option unless both parties had equal strength.

That seemed to be the rule everybody had agreed upon!

However… Friendship was pure!

Or rather, any kind of feeling was pure.

Family, friendships, love… Did those things have anything to do with strength or status?

If they did, would they still be pure?

“I thought that gods were the most arrogant of all species. I didn’t know that dragons were even more so!” Su Ping chuckled lightly. He didn’t feel angry anymore, just sad.

He suddenly realized why the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors were incapable of defeating the Heavens. It could have something to do with strength, but also because they were never united.

“Sorry…”

Su Ping flew away from the colorful bird’s back, as an indication that his next actions would have nothing to do with her. “I’d rather die before making things difficult for my friends. Besides… They did nothing wrong.”

The colorful bird was dazed.

Su Ping flew with all of his pets to face the two dragons. He didn’t stop until he was eye to eye with them.
