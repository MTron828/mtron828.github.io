Chapter 615: Return

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping had to rely on the system to have an updated version of the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound, but Su Lingyue’s Moonfrost Dragon had evolved by chance. How lucky she was.

Even with the system, the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound had to go through many vicissitudes to evolve; they had been born as low-ranked battle pets. Su Ping had poured his heart and soul into training them... Those who weren’t in the know would hardly imagine what they had gone through.

“I gave the dragon a good master.”

Su Ping raised his hand. The Oceanfrost Dragon felt a familiar sense from Su Ping and it moved closer so that he could pat its head.

“This is the Oceanfrost Dragon, a beast with a Fate State bloodline. You must treat it well,” Su Ping said to Su Lingyue.

She was confused. “What is the Fate State?”

“The legendary rank has three states and the Fate State is the highest,” Su Ping explained, “The Principal is at the Ocean State, the lowest State of the legendary rank. In the entire Blue Planet, I suppose the number of legendary battle pet warriors at the Fate State is not over three.”

He was being conservative.

He had not met anyone at the Fate State when he visited the Tower.

Still, he had just learned from Yun Wanli that the master of the Tower was at the Fate State.

He didn’t know if there were others he had not heard of yet.

“Not more than three?”

Su Lingyue could not believe that. In the entire globe, there were less than three legendary battle pet warriors at the Fate State!

Even so, her battle pet had a Fate State bloodline. That was to say, she would have a chance to stand next to the most powerful battle pet warriors in the future.

Of course...

She thought of her own rank. She would have to reach the legendary rank when her battle pet attained that rank. She would have to cancel the contract with the dragon if she didn’t break through before that happened, or else she would be slowing her dragon down.

Su Lingyue gazed at the Oceanfrost Dragon with those thoughts weighing her down.

To reach the legendary rank... That was something she could not even think of.

Her highest goal had at one time been to reach the titled rank!

As far as she knew, the titled battle pet warriors would deserve the admiration of countless people.

That day she realized that she had to reach the legendary rank, or else she might have to part ways with the Oceanfrost Dragon in the future!

She had been with her dragon for a long time, and the dragon had stunned everyone for her sake during the Elite League. She had realized back then that she could never leave the dragon.

The dragon was not only her battle pet, but her friend and family!

Su Lingyue clenched her fists silently.

She was only a burden to Su Ping and she had almost gotten him killed recently; they had escaped by chance. However, Su Ping’s battle pet had been left in the Deep Caves and she didn’t even know if the Little Skeleton was still alive or not.

There was a time when Su Ping was the loser of the family and she the hope.

She had been working hard and studying well in school so that she could become a titled battle pet warrior one day, to better take care of her parents and the family!

And yet, she had become a burden, even for her battle pet.

She and her battle pet would eventually have to part ways because she was too weak!

Su Ping noticed that Su Lingyue was being troubled by something. He asked out of curiosity, “What’s on your mind?”

What was the girl thinking about?

Su Lingyue shrugged and shook her head. She pretended to be fine when she said, “Nothing. I just feel that the world is vast, while I am...”

Too small!

She didn’t finish her sentence. She felt sad and a sensation of unfairness.

“The world is a vast one indeed,” Su Ping replied. He could empathize with that. He had been exposed to countless worlds thanks to the system; he wasn’t even sure if the world he lived in was like one of the planes as defined by the system.

“The Oceanfrost Dragon has an inherited skill which I think is called ‘Birth in Frost.’ The dragon can stick to another object and disguise itself. This must be the reason why you were able to hide,” Su Ping said, “I didn’t know the skill could also enhance the strength of the target.”

Su Lingyue nodded. She didn’t know the details and she had only found out about the skill when the Oceanfrost Dragon used it. She had yet to find out about the specifics and only gathered some information based on her experience.

“What is that saying? ‘The silly ones are lucky.’” Su Ping chuckled.

Su Lingyue pursed her lips. “I don’t know how you manage to laugh right now. Aren’t you worried about your skeleton?”

Su Ping put away his smile. “Of course I’m worried. But, would worry get me anywhere? I have to find a solution. I can be sad all the time but that won’t help me, will it?”

Su Lingyue looked at him but remained silent.

She thought that Su Ping was just pretending to be okay, just so that she wouldn’t become burdened.

But do I... deserve this?

Longjiang Base City.

Pixie Pet Store.

The base city’s economy was gradually recovering after the beast strike. The strike itself had actually made the base city famous.

Fame exerted some influence; the base city was making more trading deals with other base cities, gradually becoming more attractive to other powerful battle pet warriors.

The Pixie Pet Store became even more famous and people in other base cities around the Longjiang Base City knew about that store. That was how it worked among battle pet warriors. Once they found a good pet store, they would tell each other about it.

Su Ping and Su Lingyue noticed many powerful presences on the street when they came back riding the Inferno Dragon. The buildings that were previously the residence of the general public were being occupied by battle pet warriors. The main street had become a commercial street catering to battle pet warriors.

Whoosh!

The Inferno Dragon descended from the sky and the flames which bursted free from the beast’s body alerted the battle pet warriors around.

“Dragon!”

“What is that dragon? I haven’t seen any dragon like that.”

“It’s kind of like an Inferno Dragon, but is it?”

People crowded around the Pixie Pet Store. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Duhuang—who lived right across the street—noticed the disturbance outside. He was surprised that the Little Skeleton had returned. He gave his paperwork to his secretary and left the building.

He had modified the building and made it a classy one.

“We’re back.”

Su Ping got down from the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder and gazed at the Pixie Pet Store. Even the air felt familiar and sweet.

Home sweet home.

The moon at home was the brightest of all.

“It’s Mr. Su!”

“Mr. Su is back!”

Some onlookers recognized him and shouted in excitement.
