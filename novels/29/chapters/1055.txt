Chapter 1056: The Bloody Source Crystal

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping was rather astonished by what he saw in the small world.

“Senior sister, have you already attained a flawless grasp on the law of time?”

“That is correct,” Ji Xueqing admitted quickly and casually. “However, the flawlessness of the law of time is nothing to me. Do you have any idea how many years I’ve cultivated?”

“How long have you cultivated?” asked Su Ping curiously.

Ji Xueqing instantly rolled her eyes at Su Ping and said angrily, “It’s none of your business. Anyway, I’ve grasped more paths than the people you’ve seen. All right; let’s talk in my small world. Talking here is a waste of time.”

“Okay.”

She and Su Ping stepped into the small world.

They emerged in the middle of a cloud cluster. However, Ji Xueqing relocated the two of them, landing on one of the cultivation mountains in the next moment.

“This is a cultivation place specially prepared for you.”

Ji Xueqing added, “You must have noticed that countless rare astral crystals have been buried in the mountain underneath your feet. All kinds of astral arrays set to facilitate your cultivation have also been established around the mountain. Those astral crystals and materials to build up the astral arrays were supplied by the forces investing in you.

“You don’t need to know who they are. If you get the legacy and reach the Celestial State, they will certainly benefit from it.

“All you need to do right now is to focus on your cultivation and drop all irrelevant thoughts. Improve as much as possible.”

Su Ping nodded.

He had already detected the astral power around him, which was as thick as seawater. It was ten times denser than that in the first seat found in the Loulan family’s cultivation holy land.

However, he also knew it was only for temporary use; the Loulans couldn’t possibly afford such an expenditure in the long run.

Su Ping thought for a moment and said, “Senior sister, there’s a couple of things I want to trouble you with.”

“What are they?”

“A while ago, I encountered the Dark Tower’s assassins. I’m safe now that I’ve returned to the Celestial Court. However, I’m concerned about my family…”

“Don’t worry about that.”

Ji Xueqing interrupted him before he finished. “Master already took that into consideration. He had your parents and your sister brought to the Celestial Court shortly after you were attacked. However, he doesn’t want you to get distracted because the trial is very important. That is why he didn’t mention it to you.”

Su Ping was dazed for a moment; his heart felt warm. He didn’t know that his master had already taken care of everything.

My naughty sister has been found too; Master is truly powerful. But that makes sense. No matter how naughty she is, she cannot possibly run away from the Golden Star Zone, so it should be very easy for Master to find her,?Su Ping thought.

He could not help but smile upon remembering his parents and Su Lingyue.

“Anything else?” Ji Xueqing asked.

“If possible, I hope that the Planet of Origin where I grew up could be brought to the Celestial Court too, so that it becomes easier to take care of the emergencies there,” said Su Ping.

His parents and sister were safe, but he also had many old friends on the Blue Planet. He didn’t want anything untoward happening to them. The Blue Planet would definitely become more important if it was moved to the Celestial Court. Once the trial ended, he planned to purchase some rare materials and modify his home planet.

“A planet relocation? It shouldn’t be a problem,” Ji Xueqing thought for a moment and said. “That’s not too hard. I can do that for you.”

Being a Heavenly Lord, it was a breeze for her to move a planet to the Celestial Court.

“Speaking of which, your home planet is not the real Planet of Origin, but an ordinary planet that resembles it. Some people must have left the Planet of Origin and migrated to your planet in the past. They took the culture from the real Planet of Origin to your planet.”

“That is the reason why your planet was left unnoticed for many, many years,” said Ji Xueqing. “Human beings will never forget the planet they originated from.”

Su Ping was stunned; he then realized that the history of humans on the Blue Planet was indeed short, spanning ten thousand years or so. However, Senior Sister Ji had obviously lived more than ten thousand years. So, the Blue Planet couldn’t be the oldest planet.

However, he wasn’t too bothered by this. After all, the planet was his mother planet; his place of origin.

“Where is the real Planet of Origin then?” asked Su Ping curiously.

Ji Xueqing glanced at him. Obviously, she didn’t expect Su Ping to be in the mood for caring about that. However, given his human roots, he had the right to learn more about his ancestors. She said, “The real Planet of Origin is at the very center of the Federation. It’s been well preserved. Only the saints of the Federation live there.

“Normal people can’t land there, not even Ascendants.”

Su Ping understood, choosing not to ask further. He simply said, “The last thing I need your help with is about cultivation. There’s another planet where my friends and some of my stuff remains. I hope it can also be moved to the Celestial Court, all to make it more convenient for me to go back and forth.”

Su Ping also wanted to move Rhea. Even though the astral power on that mountain was much denser than anywhere else, what he needed the most wasn’t astral power or cultivation, but an epiphany!

His astral power had already risen to the peak of the Star State, and he could become a Star Lord at any moment.

He had postponed the breakthrough because he had invested all of his astral power on condensing Astral Paintings. The improvement brought forth by a new Astral Painting was much more significant than a realm upgrade, so he had postponed it.

It wouldn’t take him three months if he currently wanted to become a Star Lord. He certainly didn’t need decades.

It would be easier for him to explore the system’s cultivation sites in order to trigger epiphanies. He preferred looking for opportunities in the cultivation sites over training in seclusion.

With any luck, he could make friends with some Celestial State experts, and get even more things from them.

“What is it that you need? Can’t you ask your friends to bring it?” Ji Xueqing was lost for words.?Does the man think I would handle his every request after accepting the first one?

What kind of place does he think the Celestial Court is? Could any planet be brought here?

“It cannot be delivered. I must go there and fetch it,” said Su Ping, rather awkwardly.

Ji Xueqing stared at him for a moment and said, “Fine. I promise you that. However, it will be moved back later.”

“Thank you, senior sister!” Su Ping quickly thanked her.

“Anything else?” asked Ji Xueqing, fearing that Su Ping would make another weird request.

“I was wondering if I could see the path you’ve created and the flawless law of time. I hope you can show them to me,” Su Ping coughed and said.

Showing one’s own paths and laws to someone else was an extremely private matter.

After all, if the other person was malicious, it was possible for them to find weaknesses and flaws. It was like giving one’s back to them.

Ji Xueqing, however, wasn’t surprised; she seemed to know that Su Ping would ask for that.

“That’s not a big deal. However, even if you watch my law of time, it probably won’t help you very much. Everybody’s path is different; mine may not be suitable for you. It’s possible that you won’t glean anything from it; if anything, only your understanding of time will be deepened.”

“I understand,” said Su Ping with a smile, feeling relieved.

He certainly didn’t expect to flawlessly grasp the law of time as she did, just by watching her.

His master would have taught all of his disciples, turning them into unparalleled geniuses if it were that simple. At the very least, all of them would know the four supreme laws.

However, imparting knowledge wasn’t that easy.

Many experts had presented lectures again and again. However, they could only deepen the audience’s understanding of laws by a slight margin if they listened a million times.

In order for their understanding to become flawless, they had to find their own ways.

“Anything else?” asked Ji Xueqing. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Su Ping shook his head. “No. That is all.”

“Okay.”

Ji Xueqing seemed to feel relieved. She said, “Let’s talk about the training program that I’ve prepared for you then. Firstly, we’ll solidify your small world. There are Blood Source Crystals here, which are special items that can improve the hardness of your small world. Only core members can afford them, even in some of the major families.

“Once your small world is consolidated, you may consider reaching the Star Lord level, and then cultivate to its peak.

“You said you wanted to grasp more laws, but to be honest, I don’t think you can grasp too many right now. I have two amazing ancient techniques; one about movement and the other is related to killing. If you can learn them, your combat ability will be improved by at least ten percent!”

After looking at Su Ping’s nonchalant expression, Ji Xueqing frowned and said, “Don’t underestimate a 10% improvement; your level has been rising rapidly. That is why you feel that you’re constantly becoming stronger. However, it won’t last forever; the Ascendant State will be a major hurdle for you when you aim to become a Star Lord.

“It’s very hard to progress any further before you overcome the obstacle!

“Many geniuses ten thousand years ago were stuck before the obstacle and caught up, or were even surpassed by latecomers.

“You’ve reached your limits in every aspect. You’ve mastered the laws that you should. Now that you can hardly progress any more, a 10% improvement in your combat ability is very terrifying!

“If you meet a Star Lord who has reached the peak like you have, you’ll be able to crush them!”

Su Ping nodded; he knew she had made a valid point.

“I’ll learn both of them,” said Su Ping.

He wasn’t confident of attaining a flawless grasp of a path, so he would follow Senior Sister Ji’s arrangements and strengthen himself as much as possible.

“That’s good.” Ji Xueqing was relieved; she was worried that Su Ping would be too stubborn to listen to her advice.

She was a genius in her own right, and she was even more pigheaded than Su Ping when she was young. Therefore, she had feared that Su Ping would be proud just like she was, potentially turning a deaf ear to any of her suggestions until he hit the wall and bled.

“These are the Blood Source Crystals!”

Ji Xueqing waved her hand; dazzling red light appeared on the mountaintop. A bunch of glittering red gems were lying on the ground—all those gems were as big as fists, and ten thousand times brighter than agate. They were of a pure red color, and carried no impurities.

“They will automatically melt and seep in when they touch the power of the world,” Ji Xueqing said, “Some say they’re solidified blood fragments of an ancient species. They are extremely rare, usually hidden in the deepest part of the universe..”
