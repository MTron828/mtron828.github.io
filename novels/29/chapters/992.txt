Chapter 993: The Blue Cloud Deity King

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Up in the sky—several sword auras glittered as they darted at fast speeds. Some of them were ridden by human beings, and some were pure auras; all were extremely sharp. They were currently flying towards a golden-scaled insect dozens of meters long.

The creature had golden scales all over its body, and a hideous looking mouth.

Two men and a woman were moving around, trying their best to kill it, but the situation wasn’t very promising.

While the human beings and the insect were fighting fiercely, a vortex appeared in a nearby point midair, from where a man and a woman appeared. The man was tall and handsome, and the woman was beautiful, clad in a green dress; she looked as graceful as an angel.

They were none other than Su Ping and Green Lady, who were fully prepared as they set off to visit the Luofu Realm of Deities.

Someone is fighting??Hardly had Su Ping arrived when he noticed the fighting. He immediately released his senses, finding that everyone present were Star Lords, including the creature. However, the latter emanated a profound aura, and an uncanny power inside its body.

Green Lady didn’t seem to notice any of them; she simply looked around with suspicion and confusion; she felt the place was definitely familiar.

Around her was a dense deity aura, as well as an assorted energy from the desolate land. However, the types of energy and their feeling gave her a sense of familiarity.

A fallen leaf could bring someone back to autumn; a frog croak could bring someone back to childhood. The pervading, assorted energy immediately reminded her of her travels with the Twilight Deity King.

“Is this really the place?” Green Lady felt that the situation was rather surreal. She was at Su Ping’s store a second before.?We’ve arrived in the Luofu Realm of Deities in the blink of an eye?

However, the familiar feelings gradually cleared all doubts about her of her current location, no matter how hard it was to believe.

It was then that she noticed the battle in the distance and fixed her eyes upon the insect.

“A Demon God Insect?” She was stunned. Then, her eyes glittered with excitement; she then dashed forth and appeared right at the center of that fierce battle.

Her unexpected appearance shocked all those locked in battle.

Then, an overwhelming aura covered the battlefield and paralized both the group of people and the beast; their eyes widened in fear, not expecting that the stranger was a Golden Deity.

Golden Deities in the Luofu Realm of Deities were actually Ascendants.

A tier above were the Deity Kings.

“It truly is the Demon God Insect…” Green Lady mumbled as she observed the being. Su Ping had dashed over at that point; she turned and looked at him. “Is this really the Luofu Realm of Deities?”

Su Ping opened his hands, feeling helpless. “Of course. Just ask them if you don’t believe me. They must know what this place is.”

Green Lady turned to address the humans, “Is this the Luofu Realm of Deities?”

“S-Senior.”

The trio was confused by her question. But then, they thought of a horrifying possibility; that female Ascendant had ascended from another world.

“This is the Realm of Deities,” said the young man in the middle with a prudent and respectful attitude. “Senior, we’re at your service.”

The Green Lady was in a trance.

She never really doubted Su Ping, but everything was simply too surreal.

She never thought that one day she would be able to visit Luofu once again; the place that the Twilight Deity King had once defended.

So to speak, had he accomplished his task?

He secured Luofu, but he was already gone.

While the Green Lady was trying to overcome her shock, Su Ping looked at the group and asked, “Where are we in Luofu? Do you have a map of the realm?”

The three people looked at Su Ping; all of them noticed that Su Ping was a level lower than them. However, they could vaguely feel some pressure from the young man, which made them feel weird. The thought was dismissed as an illusion caused by the Golden Deity nearby, thus not considering it a big deal.

“This is the Vast Wilderness of Luofu. This Demon God Insect caused a lot of trouble and was trying to flee to this place. We’ve been chasing it and trying to dispose of it for the sake of the people,” said the young man in the middle, trying to establish a positive image. He didn’t know where Su Ping was from or what kind of person he was, but positive images would always be more likable.

After all, they were in the middle of nowhere. No one would know if the strangers decided to kill them.

Su Ping understood what was on the young man’s mind, but he didn’t expose him. He asked again, “You’ve been chasing the creature this far, so you must have a map, right?”

After a moment of hesitation, the young man took out a jade chip and said, “This is a map of the Green Continent Island.”

“It’s quite old,” Su Ping said to himself after seeing the map. The three humans wore ancient-styled clothes like Green Lady. The jade chip seemed to be made of bamboo. Having learned a lot about the Realm of Deities, Su Ping extended his thoughts into the chip.

Soon, a virtual map popped up in Su Ping’s head.

Such a combination of energy and mastery are already quite advanced,

?Su Ping thought.

They were indeed dressed in an ancient style, but whether a civilization was developed or not didn’t depend on such superficial things. From a technological point of view, it was the mastery of energy that mattered.

Underdeveloped civilizations could only make use of the energy from its planet, while developed civilizations were able to harness stellar energy as well as cosmic rays.

The Federation, for example, was quite advanced when it came to utilization of astral power.

The civilization in the Realm of Deities was the same. Although preserving ancient customs, it made use of energy as well as the Federation did.

This meant that their secret techniques were very powerful! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The Vast Wilderness…” Su Ping saw a gigantic island on the map; the Vast Wilderness was just a forest that only took up a tenth of the landmass. There were massive cities in other places, as well as tribes and totems. Those totems covered an area as large as the Vast Wilderness.

Su Ping could feel the extensive scope of the place from what he saw on the map.

“This is the Green Continent Island? How many islands are there in total?” Su Ping asked curiously.

“Thirteen.”

This time, it was Green Lady who answered Su Ping’s question.

She seemed to have calmed down. Bearing a troubled expression, she asked while trying to hide her bursting emotions, “There is one or more Deity Kings on each island!”

The three locals were stunned. They thought that the strangers had ascended from elsewhere. None of them expected that Green Lady would know their realm that well.

“Green Continent Island… I wonder if the Blue Cloud Deity King is still alive.” Green Lady thoughtfully looked at them.

The faces of the three locals changed ever so slightly, as it was highly disrespectful to call a Deity King by name. However, considering she was a Golden Deity, none of them dared to make a case out of it. The young man in the middle said prudently, “Lord Deity King is master of the island. She is naturally alive.”

He felt that his head was ringing as he said that, knowing that he could be sentenced to death for discussing whether the Deity King was alive.

“The emperors and kings are dead. Why is she still alive?” Green Lady narrowed her eyes coldly. Even the air seemed a lot colder.

The three locals were shocked.?Is this woman doubting the existence of the Deity King?

Not even a Golden Deity should be this bold, or could she?

The trio cried inwardly, not knowing how to respond.

Su Ping had heard a thing or two about the war in the past from Green Lady. He was speculating as he said, “Why don’t you ask them what happened after the war? Also, which island is the Twilight Deity King on? Why don’t we go there and take a look?”

This trip was intended as a benefit for his employee anyway; Su Ping had decided to do whatever Green Lady wanted to do.

“The Twilight Deity King?”

The trio heard yet another Deity King’s name, now from Su Ping. They also heard that the strangers were planning to visit the Blue Cloud Deity King. Their hearts were shaking. They would have considered the pair as deranged, were it not for Green Lady’s Golden Deity level.
