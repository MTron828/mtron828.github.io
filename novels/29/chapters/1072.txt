Chapter 1074: Primordial Zombie

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At the store—

Both Su Ping and Joanna reappeared. There were two Joannas, one taller and the other shorter; they looked as if they were twins.

Joanna’s original self concealed her aura and glanced at the store, only to find that she was still unable to see through the closed rooms; she couldn’t help but heave a sigh.

The bigshot behind Su Ping was indeed far stronger than she could possibly imagine.

“Take some rest here. I need to pay a visit to the Archean Divinity,” said Su Ping. He was unhappy since he had been unable to form a third small world yet. Also, he had a speculation to confirm.

“To the Archean Divinity?”

Joanna was stunned for a moment. “Are you going to…”

“Cultivate, and visit the Heaven Path Institute. If I run into any bigshot, I’ll tell them what you need and see if I can find anyone to help you,” said Su Ping.

Joanna’s heart shivered. She couldn’t help but ask, “After everything that Avril and the others did to you, have you already…”

“Already what?”

Su Ping felt amused, understanding her line of thinking. “They did offend me, but that doesn’t mean I can’t help you. Why would I punish my friend because of other people’s stupidity?”

Joanna felt dazed.

She didn’t know how to describe her feelings; but then she knew she made the right decision.

“Whatever they did, I won’t stop with our plans, because I’m doing it for you,” said Su Ping with a smile.

Joanna nodded and suddenly said, “In that case, they can’t just get everything without paying up. I’ll ask them for something later.”

“Well…”

Su Ping was lost for words when he saw her roll her eyes.

When did she become this shrewd? Who taught her that?

“Fair enough. We cannot let them board the ship without paying for the ticket. Heather’s Divine Eye Tree, for example, was a good enough treasure; it wouldn’t hurt if we get more,” said Su Ping.

Joanna nodded quickly. “I’ll filter the treasures thoroughly.”

Well… she was smart anyway.

Su Ping glanced at her, and felt reassured. He said, “Take some rest then. I’ll be heading out.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping didn’t take Joanna or Tang Ruyan this time; he would be busy training, and wouldn’t have time to take care of them. After all, he wouldn’t be able to resurrect them if they were too far away when they traveled using a temporary contract.

He said goodbye to Joanna, and activated the cultivation site again.

Su Ping entered the distant, ancient world soof after.

He felt that something was wrong the moment he got in. He appeared in the middle of a seemingly vast sky, and he was falling fast.

He quickly regained control of his body and looked around. Then, he saw the most appalling scene.

So, he wasn’t in the sky, but right next to a massive eye socket!

The master of the eye socket was such a gargantuan ferocious beast that he couldn’t see its whole body!

He had been falling from the top of the eye socket; he had yet to reach the bottom after a dozen seconds. The empty eye socket alone was as deep as a ten-story building!

The most terrifying fact was that such a ferocious beast was dead!

Its skull still had rotting flesh and blood in some parts!

Special auras and energy were spreading from the pieces of flesh. It seemed that the flesh wasn’t simple meat; it seemed to be a hybrid of some sort of energy and laws.

“Not even a Celestial State beast could be this big…” Su Ping’s heart raced, but he soon calmed down. He had seen much worse; besides, he was invincible in that place.

Without another thought, Su Ping summoned the Little Skeleton and his other pets, then asked them to absorb the remaining flesh, which was an unusual treasure.

While the Little Skeleton hopped and searched around on the beast’s skull, Su Ping flew out of its eye socket and rose higher, trying to get a complete picture of the ferocious beast.

He rose higher and higher, until he was able to see the complete appearance of the beast, which had the head of an elephant and a humanlike. It also had a pair of rotten bat wings on its back. The wings alone were as vast as a forest, enough to cover several cities.

Su Ping couldn’t help but think,?Such ferocious beasts could have only been born in ancient worlds such as the Archean Divinity…

The thousand-meter long Ascendant beasts he had seen in the Federation were just worms in the presence of such a creature.

It had definitely been a beast with a realm beyond the Celestial State. Its prey might have been Celestials!

I keep seeing these things. No wonder my heart is so strong. Su Ping was truly impressed. Even though the beast was dead, no other beasts could be detected in the vicinity; all of them had been scared off.

Su Ping circled the ferocious beast, and soon saw something even more terrifying: he saw a huge claw mark on the spine of the beast. The claw covered one fifth of the spine… It was broken with a single strike!

The spine was as solid and long as a mountain ridge, and yet, it was shattered by one strike!

It was probably killed by a bigger and more terrifying beast.?Su Ping was terrified of the picture he was imagining. The Archean Divinity was too dangerous. It was probably the wilderness where a lot of ferocious animals lived; even gods would think twice to enter.

Maybe the place was a forbidden land!

After circling around the massive body, Su Ping flew down to examine it. The body had been mostly eaten up, but there was still pure energy left inside.

Su Ping entered through the wound on its abdomen; he instantly heard the screams of restless ghosts and felt a chilling cold. Countless creatures had perished in the beast’s entrails; even their souls were confined. Still, none had dared to escape, even after the beast died. They simply lingered inside.

“Little Skeleton!”

Su Ping instantly summoned the Little Skeleton, as it loved undead creatures the most. He had detected many powerful undead creatures inside, some of which were even in the Ascendant State!

“Have some fun here,” Su Ping said to the Little Skeleton.

The Little Skeleton nodded, then he changed his boy appearance to his old skeleton look, and crimson flames erupted from his eye sockets. He charged at the ghosts and “played” with them.

Su Ping didn’t join the battle. He waited in the corner while the Little Skeleton cleaned the place up, so that he could explore the place and see if there was any valuable treasure somewhere.

He had mainly gone to the Archean Divinity to check things related to the Source World.

I sensed the Heavenly Tribulation aura on that finger, when I was killed in the Source World…?Su Ping’s eyes glittered, as he had a theory. This time, he had gone to the Archean Divinity, which was far from the Demigod Burial, so he would definitely appear in a different location when he entered the Source World.

Light gathered in Su Ping’s eyes. Soon, the world zoomed in his eyes again, and the Source World was revealed.

At the same time, Su Ping covered himself in lightning again.

It wasn’t an unusual kind, but the aura of lightning he had learned when he experienced Heavenly Tribulations.

Lightning covered his body and concealed his aura. Su Ping’s plan was simple; he wanted to hide himself with the aura. The guardian was probably related to the Heavenly Tribulation; he might be able to trick them.

Covered in Heavenly Tribulation aura, Su Ping observed the Source World and instantly found many wandering paths and laws. They were like worms, or tentacles of a ferocious beast. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The scenery was rather creepy, but it was deemed as a delight in the eyes of cultivators.

They could learn paths quickly if they touched their sources.

They detected me and escaped when I tried earlier. I need to figure out a way to restrain them.?Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He immediately remembered his path of fire, and extended a fire to tie up a golden thread.

The golden thread seemed unperturbed. The red path of fire approached, quickly tying up the golden thread.

Su Ping instantly extended his consciousness to sense it.

Soon after, a magnificent amount of thoughts were transmitted into his head. The golden thread turned out to be the path of rock, which contained the laws of many substances, such as gold, silver, and many others.

The path of rock would make it easy to refine gold and other rare metals from plain ground. Gold was actually very cheap when compared with rare metals.

Refining metals was only the path’s simplest application. The attainable wealth from metal refining was not worth mentioning for a master in the path of rock. After all, not everything could be bought with money in the Federation.

Su Ping’s expertise on the path of rock improved at a fast pace. Many fragments of understanding were directly etched into his heart.

His mastery of the rock path rose quickly, and was nearly perfected.

Right then, the path of rock struggled violently and broke free. The other paths and laws nearby seemed to be alarmed; they immediately dispersed to escape.

Su Ping widened his eyes warily. The same had happened before, and the guardian in the depths of the Source World was attracted.

He looked around while chasing the path of rock.

Nothing happened as he moved onward. Su Ping realized that his speculation had probably been confirmed. His lightning aura concealed him, avoiding the guardian’s detection.

Su Ping boldly ran at full speed. His step was accelerated by the path of fire and other laws. Soon, he was able to catch up with the path of rock and tie it up again.

Su Ping gleaned more pieces of understanding and quickly absorbed them.
