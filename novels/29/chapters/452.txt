Chapter 453 Su Ping Taking the Test

In a magnificent building.

There was a huge, oval office. The Vice Chairman sat in his seat with the Fire Lord and Lone Star standing behind him. They were demonstrating their status, while guarding against Su Ping at the same time.

To the left of Vice Chairman, Master Bai and Ding Fengchun took their seats.

Next to them, Shi Haochi, Dai Lemao, and Chen were seated. As for Zhenxiang, Tongtong, and the other young people, they were standing behind their respective father or teacher quietly. If it weren’t for the fact that they had interacted with Su Ping to some extent, they wouldn’t have been allowed to be there.

To the Vice Chairman’s right were a dozen empty seats and Su Ping was the only one sitting on one of them.

“That is what happened.”

Shi Haochi gave an honest explanation. As instructed by the Vice Chairman, Shi Haochi explained how he had met Su Ping, the way he verified Su Ping’s identity, and a full recount of the things that happened that day, not sparing any details.

Everyone turned their sights to Ding Fengchun after Shi Haochi’s explanation.

No one expected that this fierce battle had started because of a mere argument! Of course, it was against anyone’s expectation that Su Ping would kill Xiao Fengxu in public.

What an audacious guy... Lone Star and the Fire Lord looked at each other speechlessly. Both knew that they wouldn’t have such courage. Master Bai didn’t look well. If it turned out that Su Ping was what he claimed he was, then Ding Fengchun was the one in the wrong. Ding Fengchun threatened to banish Su Ping from the Trainers Association forever after a mere argument. That was to shut Su Ping out from the trainers’ society directly.

For anyone who was making a living as a trainer, cutting off their career was to cut off their lifeline.

That would be hardly acceptable for anyone. In most cases, submitting to humiliation would be the solution. However, it just so happened that Ding Fengchun was dealing with a lunatic who dared to vent his anger in public, right at the headquarters of the Trainers Association.

Ding Fengchun wore a very interesting look. With anger, he cast a glare at Shi Haochi. What? Do you think you’re an automobile data recorder, listening to all the details...!?

At that moment, he still resented Su Ping but regretted his actions at the same time.

Xiao Fengxu and Su Ping’s argument had nothing to do with him. He merely meddled because he didn’t like Su Ping’s tone. He never thought that he could have gotten into such trouble.

“Is that what happened?”

The Vice Chairman asked Dai Lemao and Chen.

Dai Lemao and Chen glanced at Shi Haochi and then Ding Fengchun. They eventually nodded.

The Vice Chairman turned to the other master trainers present.

They first trained their eyes on Ding Fengchun. Nevertheless, they also nodded. Facts were facts. They could not lie to defend Ding Fengchun in that place.

“Vice Chairman, I didn’t know who Su Ping was. Master Shi had introduced him but I thought he was joking. I could not tolerate that man’s foul mouth so I scolded him.” Ding Fengchun filed his teeth. He could not overturn the fact but he wasn’t going to admit his mistake so easily. The Vice Chairman frowned. “Master Shi is a master trainer. Do you think a master trainer would joke about such things? Besides, if he was foul-mouthed, that is a problem of his personal character. However, you threatened to banish him. You would have practically doomed him if he were just an average trainer!”

Ding Fengchun was surprised... Vice Chairman, whose side are you taking?

The one who behaved atrociously is an outsider!

The Vice Chairman could read what Ding Fengchun was thinking from his expression but said nothing in reply.

Indeed, Su Ping was an outsider and he had done things that were practically a slap on the face to the Trainers Association.

That being said, there were underlying reasons. For those mistakes, the Vice Chairman knew he had to deal a severe punishment.

Su Ping was not a push-over. On the other hand, Ding Fengchun’s actions would have ruined the future of any no-name trainer.

He had to look at the big picture.

For some master trainers, their target was to move higher on the ladder and become a top trainer.

But, given his Vice Chairman status, he had to have a bigger vision and think about the trainers as a group.

The group would only develop when everyone could progress. Every piece of humble rubble was essential when it came to constructing tall buildings.

The trainers working at the headquarters of the Trainers Association despised trainers who didn’t work there. The trainers in the Holy Light Base City despised trainers from other base cities.

That was a well-developed chain of contempt.

But it should not exist.

“You are all master trainers and the headquarters have granted things to you according to merit, plus you were bestowed great powers. But you must know that is not a reason for you to act wilfully!” the Vice Chairman said with a cold tone. He had long wanted to correct their behavior when trainers abused their powers, but he had not found the opportunity and the right excuses.

Ding Fengchun turned a bit pale upon hearing the Vice Chairman’s words.

But he still felt wronged.

He had knelt in public!

That was the greatest source of anger for him.

He still felt he had not done anything wrong by claiming to banish Su Ping. He just regretted being nosy.

“Vice Chairman, how can you be sure that he is some master trainer just based on one name? You saw it just now and Lone Star can back me up. This man is a titled battle pet warrior while I am a master trainer. It is reasonable for me to have banned his training career when he offended me!”

Ding Fengchun found more excuses. He would have to apologize to Su Ping again if he admitted his wrongdoing. He was not going to!

He was the one humiliated.

The Vice Chairman’s eyebrows were knitted even tighter. He knew that Ding Fengchun was not going to see his fault easily and was still struggling. That was understandable, though. As a matter of fact, the Vice Chairman did not mean for Ding Fengchun to apologize to Su Ping again. After all, Su Ping had made Ding Fengchun kneel. They were technically even.

At the same time, Ding Fengchun did make a good point. The Vice Chairman turned to Shi Haochi. He remembered how Shi Haochi called him yesterday to ask about Su Ping.

Also, in his long life, he had never seen any trainer achieve such accomplishments in combat strength like Su Ping.

The Vice Chairman had clearly seen what happened to the Ghostdom Serpent. It was appalling to find that Su Ping was able to beat that battle pet when he didn’t even summon a battle pet of his own.

The Vice Chairman was aware that Lone Star was no match for Su Ping.

That was to say, Su Ping was most likely at the peak of the titled rank, or at least had abilities on par with such a rank!

He might even have abilities close to the legendary rank!

Shi Haochi was staring at Su Ping as well. He had placed his trust in Su Ping. However, even Shi Haochi had questions after that battle.

He was considering whether he had made a mistake.

“Mr. Su, do you have a trainer’s ID?” the Vice Chairman asked after some thought.

The trainer’s ID was a proof of authenticity for any trainer, especially the master trainer ID. The ID card had iris recognition and fingerprint chips. The ID could prove the holder’s identity and could never be faked.

“No.”

Su Ping shook his head. “I’m here because of your invitation. I also decided to take this chance to take the test. I’m eager to find out how the tests work while I pick up some general knowledge at the same time.” “You don’t have one?” The Vice Chairman was surprised that Su Ping would admit this so readily.

“Did you lose it or...”

“Never had one.”

“You see!?”

Ding Fengchun slapped the table. Riled up, he shouted, “I told you he’s not a master trainer. He didn’t even pass the test. He cannot be a master trainer!”

Su Ping cast him a glare from the corner of his eye. “I meant that I’ve never taken the test, not even the test for the first rank. I am self-taught.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ding Fengchun stood in a daze.

The Vice Chairman was baffled as well. Self-taught?

He had seen the video and was amazed. He was very much interested in that trainer, which was why he had been treating Su Ping so nicely after he knew who he was.

“You mean you’ve never been to the Trainers Association for a test?”

“Yup.”

The Vice Chairman was speechless. It took him a while to digest the information. So, Su Ping was a self-taught master trainer who had never taken a test?

How outrageous!

“Never took the test, huh? What a lousy excuse. I think it’s just you who cannot come up with a better one. Since you said you had never taken one, do you want to try the test here? We have a complete set of equipment for testing.”

Ding Fengchun sneered at Su Ping.

Moments before, he was not so sure whether Su Ping was a fake. But then he was absolutely confident that Su Ping was a liar after his responses. A liar found his way to the headquarters. Ding Fengchun could accuse Su Ping of a sinister plot.

“Of course I will take it, but don’t you ever think I’ll forget about you so easily.” Su Ping squinted his eyes.

Ding Fengchun pulled a long face. “I will kneel before you again if you can pass the tests and prove that you’re indeed a master trainer! But if you cannot pass the test, you will kneel and apologize to me in public. That is all I want. Deal?!”

If he could make Su Ping kneel to him, he would be able to recover some of his dignity in the end.

In the future, he wouldn’t feel that bad when he met other trainer colleagues. Besides, he planned on making Su Ping kneel first and then figure out why he had snuck his way into the headquarters. Revenge after humiliation was even more enjoyable!

At this thought, Ding Fengchun could not help but flash a smug grin. “I didn’t think people could be so stupid before I met you.”

Su Ping laughed out loud. True, he had never taken the tests but he believed his abilities should be enough to reach the master trainer status.

Previously, outside the cultivation sites, he could only qualify as a battle pet warrior.

However, thanks to the recent instruction received from the system, he had become an elementary trainer.

And that was based on the system’s evaluation. According to what he learned about trainers, he could do things that other master trainers could not do.

Furiously, Ding Fengchun stood up and screamed, “Vice Chairman, look, he is verbally insulting me again!”

The Vice Chairman: “...”
