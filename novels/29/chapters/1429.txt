Chapter 1431 Leader (1)

While Chi Ying was panicking, the first lightning bolt struck down.

The immense sense of crisis quickly dragged his consciousness back to his body. He trembled as he looked up. He was wreathed in flames, and the reflection of his universe surfaced behind his back.

As flames were swept out, he unconsciously performed the ultimate skill he was best at.

After a boom, the lightning bolt that came crashing down collapsed and the flames began to spread violently, like countless sharp blades, crazily destroying everything in the void.

!!

Chi Ying was instantly stunned.

Is it… my own move?

It was like the first time experiencing his new self.

So powerful. The terrifying Dao cracks in midair even made him tremble.

Have I become so strong after receiving the Dao Heart?

Thunderclouds were roiling again in the void.

The lightning accumulating was stronger and greater than before.

However, Chi Ying was filled with newfound confidence. His eyes were glittering. He gazed at the lightning above with anticipation and excitement.

In a blur, he seemed to notice a figure behind the Lightning Tribulation.

That figure was like the great Heavenly Dao responsible for all tribulations.

He was entranced for an instant, and his heart was suddenly overwhelmed by indescribable awe.

Boom!

The second lightning bolt struck down. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chi Ying took a deep breath and made a sudden attack. This time, he had a better control of his strength, not exhausting all of it like he did in the previous round, saving 30% of his strength and using the power of his universe to counter the lightning.

The lightning collapsed, but the dispersing tribulation aura ensnared his body like countless threads. The stinging pain made his body shiver uncontrollably; some sort of power seemed to be squeezed out of his body.

While resisting, Chi Ying built up his own power. He could vaguely sense that something in the Heavenly Tribulation was helping him polish his body and break the bottleneck.

Chi Ying was overly grateful. That arrogant kid had surprisingly helped him a lot, despite their past grudges. He felt somewhat ashamed. He quietly absorbed the tribulation power, his aura gradually increasing, just like a whale awakening in the deep sea. A heavy and terrifying aura was gradually spread out.

Time flew.

One lightning bolt after another struck down. Chi Ying gained better control of his new strength while resisting. He blocked them all.

Dawn arrived after the thunderclouds dispersed. The figure in the high sky was like a dazzling sun, one that couldn’t be looked at directly.

Chi Ying couldn’t help but narrow his eyes as he looked at Su Ping, to then look away. He examined himself carefully and heaved a sigh in the end.

He was immensely stronger than before, when he was a Celestial.

He felt that he could kill his previous self with one finger at the moment.

Maybe Su Ping considered Celestials like them as weaklings.

The very idea brought about mixed feelings. He found that Su Ping was a rather benevolent person. He would have casually slapped all those Celestials to death if he were in Su Ping’s shoes after being provoked.

There are always stronger people. Our past selves were like frogs at the bottom of a well. So stupid…

Chi Ying secretly heaved a sigh. They had been standing at the top of the universe for hundreds of thousands of years, considering themselves to be the top life forms that were closer to the apex of cultivation. In retrospect, it was just hilarious and stupid. Their privileges in the past were a complete waste.

He was just an apprentice on the cultivation path. What levels are above the universe dominator realm?

Chi Ying looked forward to it, but he knew it would be impossible for him to reach that point in his entire life. It would have been impossible for him to advance without Su Ping’s help; if he wanted to go further, he would have to count on the latter. However, the levels above the universe dominator were much closer to the cultivator’s final destination. Nobody could go there solely relying on someone else.

Su Ping descended from the sky and made a casual hand wave. The desolate planet was gone, and they returned to the empty, white-walled test room. It didn’t seem big, but they would have to traverse the distance of a planet’s diameter before they reached any of the walls.

“Right now, you’re already a true universe dominator. I hope you won’t forget your responsibility and continue cultivating hard. Don’t let arrogance rule you,” said Su Ping.

Chi Ying looked at Su Ping with genuine respect in his eyes. He nodded solemnly and said, “Boss Su, rest assured; I will. I have too many questions in regards to cultivation. Maybe the real final destination of all cultivation is to understand everything in the world, without having the slightest doubt.”

“More or less. You could say that,” said Su Ping, “Anyway, that level is still too far away for us.”

Indeed… Chi Ying thought to himself. He asked curiously and prudently, “Boss Su, what levels are above the universe dominator? Are you there?”

He couldn’t help but address Su Ping in a respectful way.

Su Ping slightly shook his head and said, “Right now, I’m only in the Celestial State. Above the universe dominator is the Undying State; once you cultivate it, you’ll be among the strongest in every universe. You can then travel across all universes. The corpse we saw before was in the Undying State. That is why it was immortal.”

“You’re still in the Celestial State, Boss Su?”

Chi Ying was visibly surprised. However, Su Ping’s casual expression made him aware that the young man was neither joking nor lying.
