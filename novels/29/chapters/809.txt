Chapter 810: Su Ping, Whom Nobody Sees Through

“What the heck…”

The leader of the Ouhuang Alliance lost his cool too.

You’re ganging up against those who are the strongest. Can you be even more shameless?

The answer was yes.

All the other people agreed. The alliance who made the proposal and the Ouhuang Alliance were already public enemies and it was almost certain that they would be kicked out!

It sounded like a joke, but it was inevitable.

It was impossible for the minority to resist the majority’s decision.

The former often held the truth, but the latter held the power.

“Let’s do it. Each party will send five champions for a three-minute unrestricted battle. Is it long enough?” asked someone.

Nobody disagreed.

More and more Star State experts were approaching; it would only be a waste of time if they stayed longer. More treasures were awaiting them inside the residence!

The Star Lords were unwilling to start a bloody fight and expose their trump cards ahead of time.

They preferred to let their lackeys do the fighting. It would be great if they won the tree, but even if they couldn’t, they wouldn’t be too regretful; after all, so many alliances were competing for the same tree.

The girl turned around and looked at the people in the small world, before she chose her champions.

“You, you, you…”

The four advanced Star State men were all chosen, but there was still one vacancy.

She glanced across the crowd; many people avoided eye contact with her when she looked at them.

They knew full well that it wasn’t a good thing to be chosen.

They might get killed in the chaotic battle against that many champions of the alliances!

There was also the fact that all advanced Star State warriors had been chosen, meaning that the battles would be in that level; the ones with early or middle phase level would be easily beaten.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, the girl’s surprised eyes stopped for a moment.

The Void State?

She examined the guy carefully and found that he was still at the Void State!

She had scanned him thoroughly, and even detected divine power in his body; it was profound, seemingly of an even greater purity than hers!

There are people that even I can’t see through? The girl observed him in surprise. “What’s your name?”

“Me?”

Back in the crowd, O’Neil, the Deity of Six Realms and the others around Su Ping turned around and looked at the latter, not expecting that their leader would notice him so easily.

Those at the mid phase of the Star State ahead of him were relieved, but still turned with surprise in their faces.

“My name is Heaven Destroying Celestial.” Su Ping blushed when he reported his name under the scrutiny of many.

“Heaven Destroying Celestial?”

The girl was stunned for a moment. Then, her eyes glittered, and she said, “What an excellent name! You’re very good. Come on and fight for me. I will reward you.”

“Well…”

Su Ping was at a loss for words. I was chosen just like that?

“Well…”

O’Neil was rendered speechless, too. So many people were ahead of Su Ping. Why was he chosen? O’Neil knew that Su Ping was strong, but the young man was just a trainer. He had defeated Garland and the others probably because his level was high and he had powerful secret techniques.

He had probably acquired many top battle techniques as a grandmaster trainer from the experts he was familiar with.

However, Su Ping couldn’t have been higher than the middle phase of the Star State. That was O’Neil’s judgment. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Besides, even if he was, he couldn’t compare to the others at the same level, who were real battle pet warriors. The combat ability gap couldn’t be compensated with secret techniques. Experience, methods and other abilities were all of critical importance to their performance in a battle.

But in the end, since the leader had picked Su Ping, O’Neil would not dare utter a word, only dropping a hint at him, asking him to stay safe.

“If you win this Tree of Laws by managing to stand until the last moment, I will give you all the fruits it has!

“In addition, whether you win or lose, I will give each of you a reasonably good secret treasure later!

“Whoever stands until the end will get to pick the fruits of laws first. This is an opportunity for you; if you seize it, you might be able to soar all the way into the Star Lord State!” the girl announced proudly.

Everybody was quite shocked when they heard that; none of them expected that joining the battle would have that many benefits!

They would be given a treasure even if they lost. Since the leader said that it was reasonably good, it couldn’t be garbage!

“I would’ve signed up for it if I had known about the rewards.”

“Give me a break, you’ll only get yourself killed. The leader wants people who can fight.”

“I admit that I’m not a capable warrior, but I’m surely stronger than the new member, am I not?”

“It’s hard to say. Didn’t you notice that the new member is concealing his cultivation so we see him as a Void State warrior? I can’t tell his real level. If he has such a powerful concealment technique, his other battle techniques must be just as powerful.”

“Is that so? Is he pretending to be weak when he’s actually an advanced Star State bigshot?”

Everybody noticed Su Ping and gossiped about him. Some were jealous, but they couldn’t sense Su Ping’s level so they kept their jealousy hidden.

It would be natural to be chosen if Su Ping was indeed such a bigshot.

Also, the leader must’ve picked Su Ping because she saw through his real level!

“…”

Su Ping didn’t know what to say after hearing their discussions. He finally understood why he had gotten chosen.

Pretending? This is my real level, all right?

He had never concealed his real level, yet nobody believed him. How dark do they think the world is?

Su Ping shook his head and walked forward. He had to admit that the leader’s reward was rather tempting. His combat ability would soar if he had a chance to pick a fruit from the tree. If any of the fruits contained the law of space, he would be able to fill his bridge and ascend to the Fate State!

The four advanced Star State men also noticed Su Ping. They were quite solemn.

None of them was able to see through Su Ping’s real level, which made them realize why their leader had picked him.

The girl extended her hand and sprayed divine brilliance on their head, before she announced proudly, “In the name of the goddess, I bless you. Fight, my warriors!”

The brilliance seemed spectacular, but it was absolutely useless.

Su Ping was again speechless. This leader must be mentally ill.

The other alliances were also picking their champions at that moment.

“Guys, have them fight in our small world, so that we can intervene in time to prevent casualties,” someone suggested.

Nobody objected.

Having decided, they joined their hands and connected some of the areas in the small worlds to construct a battlefield.

“Go, my warriors!” the girl cried again.

Su Ping sweated hard as he followed the other four experts into the small world.

More and more unaffiliated Star State experts were arriving at the site; some of them noticed the Tree of Laws and exclaimed.

Soon after, the number of people who learned about the Tree of Laws grew, causing an uproar.

Star State warriors were extremely tempted by the tree; if they acquired it, they would even have a chance to become Star Lords!

However, seeing that the alliances and some Star Lords had surrounded the area, they could only sigh with jealousy and regret.

The stronger experts always claimed the resources; they could only eat the leftovers.

The battles began once the champions of each party entered the small world, while overseen by a Star Lord.

Everybody charged against the Ouhuang Alliance from the very beginning, including the alliance that made the proposal. However, someone charged too fast and was ambushed by other alliances, soon causing a chaotic battle inside the small world.
