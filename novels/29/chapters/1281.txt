Chapter 1282 Ancestral Devil (1)

Shivalello chuckled and voluntarily greeted Su Ping, “We meet again.”Having learned his lesson, he knew he had to make friends with Su Ping if he wanted to return to the Archean Divinity.

“Yes. I’m here to ask for your help. I have to trouble you again.” Su Ping was rather courteous. After all, it was slightly ’embarrassing’ to ask for their help again and again.

Avril informed Shivalello and the others of the situation via telepathy. Their expressions changed, then looked at Su Ping as well as his companions, hesitating. “Fine. Since you’ve asked in person, we can only do our best.” Shivalello chose to accept after much deliberation. After all, he had already lost a fortune to Su Ping; all his losses would be for naught if he were to give up at that moment.

“Thank you.”

Su Ping nodded. “There may soon be a chance to help you contact some experts of the Archean Divinity. I hope someone can take this place back to where it belongs.”

All four of them were dazed; their eyes lit up. Avril asked in delight, “Really?”.

“I’ll try my best,” said Su Ping.

“As long as you try your best, we’ll be eternally in your debt. Even if you fail,” said Shivalello solemnly, anticipation showing in his eyes.

Su Ping nodded.

They became silent after showing their stance. They opened their respective treasuries, allowing Su Ping and his companions to pick whatever they wanted.

Wasn’t the Archean Divinity already destroyed? mumbled the sutra old man in his heart while following Su Ping. He recalled how Su Ping tricked them into entering his store; he had a feeling that the boy was fooling those four Celestials.

But obviously, he wouldn’t say a thing. After all, Su Ping was doing this for them.

They soon found a lot of rare items in the four treasuries. The cauldron woman was astounded. She could melt all things; the more treasures she melted and absorbed, the stronger she would become. Having such an assorted display of wealth that she was free to pick, she began to act like a starving refugee that had suddenly found a warehouse filled with food.

“What do you need?” Su Ping looked at the sutra old man.

The latter’s expression changed a bit, feeling that Su Ping had seen through his heart. However, he replied casually, “I used to be an emperor-level sutra. However, my path was broken in a battle, just like a man having his spine extracted. That’s why my level plummeted. I may be able to fix myself if I can find a blade to accommodate the imperial

path.”

“There aren’t any emperor-level blades here.” Su Ping shook his head.

“I can only try to heal myself with the rare medicine then, but the chances of recovery are slim,” said the sutra old man bitterly.

Su Ping glanced at him but didn’t say anything else. Once the cauldron woman picked enough materials, he left the treasuries and handed the cauldron woman to the four Celestials.

After that, Su Ping tore the void apart and took the sutra old man away.

He also left his pets behind.

“Boss, where are we going?”

The sutra old man followed Su Ping uneasily.

They soon stepped out of the void. It was a desolate place at the edge of the Demigod Burial, right in the middle of nowhere.

“You are my weapon. I’m going to claim you right now… Are you willing to accept?” asked Su Ping

Dazed for a moment, the sutra old man managed a smile. “Boss, being the heir of the magic store, you will surely rise to the ultimate peak. I was an emperor-level sutra in the past, but I’m crippled right now. I’m afraid I’ll become a burden for you.”

“That’s all right.”

“Boss…”

“Is that a no?” Su Ping’s eyes turned cold.

Greatly scared, the sutra old man quickly said, “No, of course not. Are you still questioning my loyalty, boss? I’m absolutely loyal to you. If you want to claim me, it will be my honor.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping wasted no time talking. He simply released some of his soul aura to him.

The sutra old man hesitated for a moment, then finally accepted Su Ping’s connection.

Su Ping was soon able to detect the sutra old man in his consciousness. It was different from a pet contract, as the link with a weapon was only a simple connection. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Still, that simple connection was all that Su Ping needed. He suddenly dragged the sutra old man unto himself.

“Boss?!” The sutra old man was greatly shocked, puzzled and scared.

“Don’t resist. I will read all your information,” said Su Ping indifferently.

Su Ping’s consciousness entered the old man’s body, which had a special structure. Hardly had it entered when Su Ping noticed a surge of information.

“The Fiend’s Book!”

Su Ping found the sutra old man’s real name from his delving into the information.

Then, he started turning the pages, one by one.

“Boss…”

The old man gritted his teeth and tried to stop it. However, he couldn’t resist Su Ping’s mental invasion, having acknowledged Su Ping as his master. Besides, he couldn’t even if he wanted to. Su Ping was able to suppress Ye Chen with ease; he was far stronger.

The only way for him to resist it was to destroy himself.

“A collection of evil arts, indeed,” remarked Su Ping as he read.

The arts written on the book were extremely vicious. Only the unscrupulous villains would be willing to cultivate them. There were violent and bloody techniques, as well as horrible sorcery.

Are these the evil arts cultivated by Ye Chen? There’s also the ancient devil’s constitution…

Aside from cultivation techniques, there were also many other secret techniques in the book, including ways to gain special constitutions. The constitution used by Ye Chen earlier on was exactly condensed through a cruel method, looting other constitutions’ bloodlines.
