Chapter 1338 Original Dao World (1)

“You want to kill someone across a distance?” Elder Chan asked, “How far exactly are we talking about?”

“The farther, the better. Say, across a continent for instance,” Su Ping estimated.

The Archean Divinity was extremely vast, and the twenty-three continents were quite distant from each other. Not even God Kings were able to teleport to another continent.

That is, unless they had set up divine arrays in advance.

“That distance is too much; it’s impossible for the attack to cross even with the perfect Dao of time and space. The only choice is to attack with the Original Dao World, but that requires a deep understanding of Dao…”

Elder Chan glanced at Su Ping and said, “First, I need to test your understanding of Dao. You haven’t found your own Dao Heart yet; I wonder if you can perceive the Original Dao World.”

“Thank you very much, senior,” said Su Ping gratefully.

Elder Chan waved a hand as though considering the favor as not a big deal. Then, he pointed at Su Ping’s forehead once more. Su Ping instantly felt that his consciousness was dragged out of his body and his senses tapping the environment became clearer.

He could vividly detect the laws as they swam around him like worms. Aside from laws-as his senses sank into deeper worlds-Su Ping was able to detect a lot of complex paths that supported their world like corals at the bottom of the ocean. They stretched all the way to infinity.

“Can you see the Original Dao World?” Elder Chan’s voice echoed in his mind.

Su Ping suddenly thought of experiencing the Golden Crow ancestor’s world with the heart blood, and the world instantly changed before his eyes. Those complex laws and paths were suddenly constricted, and the world turned gray like the ancient chaos. Deep in chaos, there were tubes stretching all over like veins.

If we were to examine them carefully, it could be seen that many great paths were interlaced inside the tubes.

That was not exactly the world that Su Ping had experienced when he met the Golden Crow ancestor. The world he experienced was much bigger and close to the origin. He even saw the terrifying shadows lurking in the depths of the Great Dao. The paths and laws that floated out of those shadows were like rotten worms.

“Senior, what’s the Original Dao World like?” asked Su Ping subconsciously. He wasn’t sure if what he was seeing was the Original Dao World.

“The Original Dao World contains a lot of paths. You may feel that plenty of primitive paths are spreading in all directions. There are also many lesser paths deriving from them. Let me give you a tour.”

Su Ping then felt that his consciousness had been divided. Part of his senses registered that the environment changed quickly; the ordinary view changed drastically. His senses were much keener, allowing him to see the dust and microorganisms in the air. He was able to see a lot of laws and paths as the view zoomed in.

He was eventually capable of seeing a lot of thick tubes spreading in all directions.

“That’s the Original Dao World,” said Elder Chan, “Once you’re able to see this world from above, it means that your consciousness has touched the Original Dao World and you can view the world in a purer way.”

“So this is it…” Su Ping was relieved; it seemed that he was successful.

“How about it? Is it the same as what you saw before?” asked Elder Chan.

Su Ping replied, “Thank you very much, senior. I think I’ve detected the Original Dao.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Are you sure? It would be futile if you haven’t sensed the Original Dao, no matter how you study the divine skill I’m going to teach you. Aside from that, you can’t improve your understanding of Dao by studying it; you have to cultivate the technique later,” said Elder Chan.

Su Ping nodded. “I’m positive.”

Part of the consciousness in Su Ping’s head receded like a tide. The touching sensation on his forehead was gone. Su Ping opened his eyes and saw that Elder Chan had retracted his finger.

“You’ve just become a Dao Child, and you’re already able to perceive the Original Dao…” Elder Chan looked at Su Ping with a strange expression. Such an outcome meant that Su Ping hadn’t used his real strength during the Dao Child competition.

“You’re not far from developing your own Dao Heart. It should be easy for you to find your own Dao Heart, considering your current understanding,” said Elder Chan.

Su Ping would become as strong as a God Emperor once he found the Dao Heart. As for his level, he could make a breakthrough at any moment.

God Emperors were extremely rare, even when considering the entire Archean Divinity. Ancestral Gods hardly revealed themselves, and God Emperors were the actual rulers everywhere.

Su Ping didn’t comment on Elder Chan’s words. As a matter of fact, he could condense any of the three Dao Hearts that the Golden Crow ancestor had shown him.

Seeing the Original Dao World without the Golden Crow ancestor’s help. My understanding of the Great Dao was improved through his world. Alas, I couldn’t see it as profoundly as the Golden Crow ancestor did with my own senses…

Su Ping was ever grateful to the Golden Crows.

“Of the three Dao Children, you’re the second to enter the Original Dao World. I thought it would take you several thousand years to reach that level. Looks like we underestimated you; you’re truly shocking,” remarked Elder Chan. Su Ping’s rise was definitely unexpected. Nobody knew him in the past, but he became outstanding all of a sudden; he had been absolutely unstoppable ever since they noticed him.

“Who was the first one?” Su Ping was quite curious.
