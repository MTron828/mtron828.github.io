Chapter 1273 Beyond the Crack (2)

“As I said, hand over the legacy.” Su Ping’s eyes were cold and emotionless.

“I didn’t choose the legacy; the legacy chose

me.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Kayafollet chose to give in. “The legacy is divided into three parts. Right now, I’ve only inherited the first part; I don’t know about the other two. You can’t have them even if you kill me. The ancient corpse has run out of power and does not have any legacy left. If you want me to hand the legacy you’ll have to wait until I inherit it fully.”

“Is that so?”

Su Ping raised a hand and laid it on her head. “Let me examine your memories and I’ll find

out.”

Kayafollet’s eyes widened. She said in fear and shock, “You can’t do that!”

Su Ping was going to use the soul searching technique inherited from his bloodline, but then a strange and creepy aura was suddenly spread out.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, hairs instinctively standing on end. He raised his head and looked.

The ominous aura came from the depths of the City of Sins in the distance.

It was the place where the ancient corpse and the crack in the universe were located!

Su Ping’s eyes turned into chaos vortices. Time and space before his eyes started to fold, allowing him to see the crack and the ancient corpse directly.

This power arranged things as if he were standing right in front of the crack.

He soon discovered that something was off; the crack in the universe had somehow become much wider.

“What is going on?”

While dazed, Su Ping saw Dao Glyph threads spreading out of the crack. They were ancient, primitive and dark, extending like some sort of beard.

Those Dao Glyphs were the source of his unease.

It seems that… something is coming out!

Su Ping’s heart raced as an ominous feeling overwhelmed him. Considering his combat ability, whatever made him uneasy had to be something terrifying. “Huh?”

Kayafollet sensed Su Ping’s sudden distraction, still trapped in a tight grip. While puzzled, she tried to struggle, only to discover that her small universe was still being suppressed. She also sensed something unusual as she tried activating her universe. It seemed that something had appeared in the world. What is this feeling?

Kayafollet was astonished; she couldn’t describe it. However, she somehow sensed a pair of eyes, gazing at her as a coldblooded hunter would.

A breeze passed through the world. The sky above the entire City of Sins fell quiet at that moment.

Many were crawling out from the ruins of the seriously wrecked capital, running for their lives.

All the denizens saw Celestials fighting and knew that the dome protecting the Mayhem Star Zone had been destroyed.

The fact that Celestials were present was a sign that they would no longer be safe.

Just as the locals were trying to escape-all the Ascendant cultivators from various star zones were looking at Su Ping and Kayafollet who had just emerged from the deeper spaces.

One of them was the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin, and the other was an unprecedented genius.

Many felt conflicted as they saw how the Saint Heir’s throat was clutched.

Everyone was waiting to see what would happen, but then some Heavenly Lords noticed something and looked back into the depths of the City of Sins.

Many more noticed their reaction, noticing that something was indeed wrong. Their attention was removed from the pair to focus on the crack in the sky.

The ancient corpse was still faintly visible.

However, the most important matter was the crack’s size. It was originally far smaller than the corpse, but now they were just as large!

Unusual auras were flooding out. Many people were frightened; trembling, goosebumps all over and feeling nauseous. It was as if something were raging in their guts; an uncontrollable fear etched deeply into their

genes!

“What is going on?”

“I feel like I can’t control my hands. They’re shaking!”

“Why? Why is my heart pounding? I can’t calm down!”

The Ascendants of all star zones were shocked; the top experts of the universe were overwhelmed by fear. Not even Celestials had frightened them as much.

Some were trembling nonstop, and while others held their chests as if about to throw up.

“Something’s happening to the ancient corpse. Is it regaining consciousness?” said one of the cultivators. That would be horrifying.

Was the ancient corpse, which belonged to a universe dominator, waking up?

“This place is not safe. Let’s go!” said another in the crowd, being fast enough to react. They had watched enough drama; time to run.

Some of them boarded their warships and flew away, while others planned to stay and watch for a while longer. If the universe dominator did wake up, he might not pay any attention to ants like them.

Ascendants were far too weak in the eyes of a universe dominator, just like worms on the ground, and they would most likely be overlooked.

All the people in the crowd were the adventurous sort; they saw the event as an opportunity.

Whoosh!

Some people were even flying towards the ancient corpse, trying to figure out what was wrong from close up.

“It’s not my doing.”

Since she was a Celestial, Kayafollet was also able to see the ancient corpse despite the long distance. She discovered that the massive body was no longer still; it was raising an arm!

The situation was truly odd. Was the corpse really going to revive?

The inheritance memories allowed her to learn what an unparalleled expert used to own that body.

So many years have passed. Is that man going to return?

“I know it’s not your doing.”

Su Ping was gloomy, and slightly surprised by the corpse’s unexpected move. However, he knew that his current unease was not being caused by the gargantuan body, but by something lurking in the depths of the crack in the universe.

It was somewhere beyond the universe.

Something seemed to be moving towards their world.

What could it be?

A creature from outside the universe?

Su Ping had seen countless cultivation sites thanks to the system; many of them were extremely vast. He was sure that they were not found in that universe.

If the universe could be compared to a planet, it could be considered that other worlds existed beyond that universe. Those worlds also had outer walls; however, there was the possibility of some unimaginable existences being able to break those walls and travel to other universes.

Should I stay and watch, or should I leave immediately? Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

“It is advised that the host returns to the store immediately,” echoed in his mind all of a sudden, using the gravest tone. Su Ping was slightly surprised. It was the first time for the system to be so readily warning him. Judging by the alert, the danger was obviously great.

It was possible that not even the system’s help would be enough!

“Let’s go!”

Without sparing a thought, Su Ping severed Kayafollet’s head, then sent it along with the rest of her body to his universe of chaos. He then moved to rejoin his eldest brother and the rest.

An ancient roar echoed while he acted, which deafened the entire universe!

The entire Mayhem Star Zone was covered by the distant and furious roar, which seemed to be coming from the void beyond the star zone. It worked directly on the soul; the laws it carried twisted the vacuum while transmitting into the far distance.

“What is going on?”

Su Ping raised his head and looked at the source of the roar, only to discover that the ancient corpse had stood up.

Was the ancient corpse resurrecting?

The next moment, Su Ping witnessed the most terrifying scene: at the edge of the universe’s crack-in between the black and twisted Dao Glyphs—a pair of hands reached outward, full of strange black spots.

Those hands were extremely huge; they held onto the crack in the universe.

“There’s something alright!!”

Goosebumps popped up all over his body the moment he saw the hands, feeling the deepest fear coming from his very soul. He knew it was probably the danger that the system wanted him to evade.

Run!

Su Ping quickly flashed and found Song Yuan and the others.
