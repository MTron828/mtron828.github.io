Chapter 1321 Return of the Lightning Rat (2)

Su Ping remembered the Little Skeleton. He knew the feeling very well.

The flashback in Su Ping’s head ended. He heard the Lightning Rat squeaking in his arms and sending an overwhelming thought into his head.

The emotion transmitted was the will to get stronger!

Even though it had forgotten Su Yanying and its second master, they seemed to have planted some sort of belief in its heart. This time, it didn’t get depressed or lie down waiting outside the store. Instead, it wanted to bond with Su Ping and get stronger; based on its own understanding and memories, Su Ping was a terrifying devil.

And yet, it had decided to voluntarily join hands with him.

Furthermore, it had even forgotten why it wanted to become stronger, or why it was grieving. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Nonetheless, it rushed to the scary human and made the choice. Su Ping had no idea why that obsession lingered in its head, even though it had lost its memories, but it didn’t matter.

Su Ping hugged the Lightning Rat and mumbled, “You’ve fallen too far behind. I’ll be more cruel and strict to train you. I won’t let you lose another master…” The Lightning Rat shivered after hearing what Su Ping said, as if some of its bad memories were triggered. It didn’t struggle, though; instead, it craned its head and squeaked, as if it was expressing a fearless stance!

Su Ping touched its head and then picked a few pets for professional training from Joanna. He then went to the pet room and teleported to a cultivation site.

This time, he picked the Golden Crows’ world.

That top cultivation site was too hard for the Lightning Rat, but Su Ping chose it for other purposes. He went there to ask the Golden Crows about ancestors and the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire.

The Golden Crows were definitely the best specialists when it came to fire.

......

Su Ping felt that his Golden Crow bloodline was somehow activated when sealed the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire in his universe of chaos; it was as if it were about to swallow the fire.

Still, he knew such an idea was impossible; he would only get himself burned in the end.

“Come on out.”

Su Ping summoned the Lightning Rat and his other pets. The random teleportation took them to a desert. Having gone to the Golden Crows’ world several times, he found that most places were deserts and hills, probably because of the scorching environment. Very few plants grew; those that did survive were mostly blades of divine grass and trees.

The Lightning Rat jumped out of Su Ping’s contract space and became wary again, rolling its eyes and looking around again. The familiar feeling—as if etched to its genesreturned to the small critter right then. It could not help but shiver and desire to flee.

The reaction stopped quickly after. For some reason, there was a thought in its head; it wanted to get crazy strong no matter what!

The thought was deeply implanted in its heart, like the constant reminder of a blade on top of its head.

It could not go against the thought; the only option was to grimace and obey.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered as he felt the rodent’s reaction. The little one would have already cowered-seeking protection next to his feet, only to be kicked away. However, it was only grimacing while standing on its own at the moment, as if hesitating and struggling. In any case, it didn’t back down and dodge.

An aura was approaching their location in the desert.

Su Ping had already discovered it was a Star Lord beast; however, it was much more terrifying than the Star Lord beasts outside. After all, most of the ancient mythical creatures from that world had chaos power in their bodies. Even the beasts of the Archean Divinity would be hard pressed in a competition.

“Now!”

Su Ping instantly asked the Lightning Rat and the customers’ pets to charge forward. As for the Inferno Dragon and his own pets, they stayed. They were strong enough to fight Ascendant mythical creatures; it wouldn’t be fair if they fought that tiny beast.

Su Ping discovered that the Lightning Rat was leading the charge. It burst out electricity with erect fur, showing a Star State cultivation. It approached the local beast with a gait that fused the truth of space, then unleashed hundreds of lightning bolts towards the enemy.

The local beast wasn’t easy to mess with. It resisted the lightning bolts with a hard shell, and then charged back at the Lightning Rat.

After a boom, the rodent was hit by the beast’s pincers. It fell into a pit like a sandbag and rolled for hundreds of meters. However, the pets in training caught up before the enemy creature could give chase and a chaotic battle burst out.

The little rat rose from the ground, not taking any time to rest. Lightning fluctuated even more dazzlingly, and its purple eyes turned bloodshot. It screamed and rushed forward again.

Wounded, counterattack, wounded again, charge again.

The process repeated. The same applied to the other pets, the only difference being that the Lightning Rat was acting on its own, while the others were compelled by Su Ping’s secret training technique.

Su Ping started to brood as he witnessed how the rodent was going all out. He didn’t order it to stop. Instead, he controlled the other pets and allowed the Lightning Rat to take the aggressive attacks.

A long time later, the tiny beast was finally exhausted and was about to flee. Su Ping easily killed it with one finger; then, he squeezed it, turning a more than two hundred meters long being to a meatball two centimeters in diameter. All the impurities were removed; only the fleshly energy remained.

Su Ping threw it to the Lightning Rat and touched its head. “Just eat. Eat more; you’ll grow stronger soon.”

The little one seemed to have understood, as it quickly swallowed the meatball.

Its wounds healed at a fast rate. Su Ping also imparted the great paths he had comprehended to the little pet, and helped it establish small worlds.

While the pet digested and absorbed the meatball, Su Ping embarked on the training journey for all those pets.

A few days later-Su Ping ran into a patrolling Golden Crow and spoke about his purpose. To Su Ping’s surprise, it recognized him and instantly led him to the ancestral tree of the Golden Crows.

Su Ping had complicated feelings as he neared their place. As he looked at the boundless, tall trees and the powerful Golden Crows perched on the branches, he could not help but wonder if he could crush the invading worms as soon as he took those powers back to his universe.

“You’re finally here. Huh?”

A brilliant figure flew closer. It was another Golden Crow, but it was clearly more slender and honorable than the average creature. Its every feather was perfect, like a natural engraving.

After landing, it transformed into a gorgeous girl, who was none other than Diqiong.

Diqiong felt something unusual the moment she saw Su Ping. She stared at him for a moment and was quite astonished. Su Ping seemed to have changed greatly since his past visit.

“You’ve broken through?”

Diqiong found it hard to believe. How long has it been? Su Ping’s speed of cultivation was even faster than hers.

“Sort of.” It wasn’t until Su Ping saw her that he realized he had forgotten something. “Sorry, I forgot the movies I promised you. I’ll definitely bring them next time.”

“Then why are you here?” Diqiong eyed Su Ping and said, “There seems to be a very special power in you. It’s vigorous, and may burst out anytime.”

“You mean my sexuality?”

“Bah!” Diqiong spat and rolled her eyes. “You have a purpose every time. Tell me about it. What is it this time?”

Su Ping waved a hand and the void parted to reveal an opening to his universe of chaos. The Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire could be seen locked inside. It was like a scorching star floating in a dark space.

“I want to learn the power to control fire,” said Su Ping outright.
