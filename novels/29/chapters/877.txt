Chapter 879: Over

Claesabe was shocked to see Su Ping back.

A team of more than thirty people had been single handedly destroyed by Su Ping in a manner of minutes?

Su Ping had also used a sword, not his fists, as everybody thought that was his forte...

Who could say that Su Ping’s best techniques were fist-related at the moment?

Claesabe came up with a bitter guess. Is it possible that he used his fist only because his opponents were too weak? Both of them were geniuses with the same cultivation level. Is the gap between us truly this massive?

The audience focusing on the live feed thought the same.

Su Ping’s performance had attracted the attention of many more people once the battle started. He then quickly rose to the top of the champion prediction rank in the end!

So strong!

He destroyed a team of thirty men. Everybody was also able to tell that he wasn’t even trying his best! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Boss Su is truly as horrifying as usual!”

“Our lord is invincible!”

All the viewers on the Blue Planet were excited to see that. Even Ji Yuanfeng and Qin Duhuang were thrilled; their eyes were bloodshot due to the excitement.

“Fist King? I think he should be called Sword King!”

“What Sword King? Didn’t you see that his sword was made of astral power? It means that he wasn’t carrying any sword!”

“Damn, who knows what he’s really good at?”

Those who had noticed Su Ping’s actions were discussing more heatedly than ever.

A Star Lord stepped up and said during their discussion, “His attack contained the power of twenty laws, and yet the twenty laws were combined quite neatly. It means that he hasn’t reached his limits yet; I believe he’ll become a Star Lord shortly after he reaches the Star State!”

Everybody was shocked to hear that.

They knew that the geniuses who had advanced with ten victories had mostly reached the limits of the Fate State—

They only needed an emerging thought to make a breakthrough to the Star State, but they had held themselves back to avoid breaking through to higher levels.

The Star Lord was implying that Su Ping could soon reach the limits of the Star State as soon as he stopped containing himself, and even become a Star Lord soon after!

Even the Star State was still very far away for the other Fate State warriors, not to mention the Star Lord State; the gap between them was too wide!

“Are all the geniuses that have emerged from countless planets like him?”

“It’s true that I don’t live in the same universe as those monsters.”

“I’m a Star State expert. I have to admit that I can’t defeat him...”

Su Ping received a lot of attention because of his overwhelming strength, and tons of new fans. Strength was revered on every planet of the Federation; Su Ping’s dominant approach had won the admiration of many people.

If Su Ping were to advertise any product, it would be sold out immediately!

On the hilltop, Claesabe swallowed and said carefully, “B-Brother Su, why did you drop those identity badges?”

Su Ping said casually, “We don’t need them. If anyone passes by and needs them, they can consider this as a gift from us.”

Claesabe was lost for words; he would have kept all of the identity badges, so that he would shock anyone at the end of the challenge.

“Come on. Let’s keep drinking,” Su Ping replied with a smile.

Claesabe and Ibetaluna looked at each other and sat down awkwardly with Su Ping. The place was open and dangerous; they would be relatively safe in Su Ping’s company as long as the guys on the popularity rank didn’t attack them together.

Claesabe took a mouthful of wine and remarked, “Brother Su, you’re truly much stronger than us.”

Ibetaluna gazed at Su Ping with a weird light in her eyes. She had always been proud as a descendant of the Knight King family, never lowering her head, not even before Oasis Dragon King. However, she was deeply impressed by Su Ping’s strength, and she began to have thoughts.

“Just train harder. You’ll be as strong as me,” Su Ping encouraged him.

Claesabe gave a bitter smile and chose not to continue. If training meant everything, everybody could be a genius.

He had always been the one who comforted others. And yet, he was the one being comforted on that day.

Time flew by.

Soon, another person moved over the mountain, then noticed Su Ping and the others.

Someone ran off in fear after seeing Fist King; still, some intended to surround him with their advantage in numbers.

More and more identity badges were piled at the foot of the hill like nails.

The contestants on the continent had lost access to the Internet and were unable to communicate amongst themselves, my impression of Su Ping was outdated.

However, the people watching the stream were shocked.

A hill of identity badges had been heaped underneath Su Ping.

There had been more than five hundred of them!

After all, almost eight groups had shown up to attack Su Ping; the largest of them had more than eighty members. This includes a couple of remarkable geniuses and three people who had made it to the top twenty on the popularity rank. Such a lineup could have been enough to defeat a lot of lone wolves and smaller groups in the survival test.

However, they were soon defeated by Su Ping; the outcome was to be expected, not suspenseful, at all.

Just like before, he annihilated all of them with his sword, and both his dragon and dog.

On the hilltop—Su Ping kept eating, drinking and chatting with his teammates. The interesting events they talked about gave Su Ping a deeper level of understanding of the Federation.

“There’s 120 hours to go. We’ve just endured a third of the total.”

Claesabe checked his watch and said, “Fewer people are coming this way. They must have learned to hide.”

“Indeed. It’s been five hours since anybody stopped by.”

Ibetaluna nodded; many people had encountered them. Most of them chose to back off after seeing Su Ping. The rest took advantage of their numbers and attacked. All of them had paid a gory price for their decision.

Many of them were strong enough to make it to the top hundred, yet they were knocked out by Su Ping.

“They could have picked up the identity badges at the foot of the hill, yet they had to go and try to rob us.” Su Ping shook his head. He had told those people to pick the badges at the foot of the hill, but they thought it was a trap so they chose to attack him. He had to react.

Claesabe smiled bitterly. Those contestants had no idea that Su Ping had no interest in those badges. Some of them also wanted to become famous by defeating Su Ping the Fist King. This resulted in them losing everything.

While they talked, a young man wearing a purple robe was moving with three other people. They were only a team of four, yet they swaggered in the high sky fearlessly.

“What a shame. I haven’t seen him yet.”

The young man looked around regretfully. He was trying to find Oasis Gray.

He had defeated the guy before; he was planning on knocking him out again during that match. He despised the guy for acting snobbish in his presence even after having being defeated in the past.

Suddenly, a woman in the team said, “Someone’s up there.”

The woman had golden pupils and another pair of vertical pupils within them, which was quite weird.

After hearing what the woman said, the young man asked quickly, “How many? Do we know them?”

“Three. One of them is the one called Fist King from the popularity ranking. The other two are among the top hundred too,” replied the woman quickly.

“Fist King?”

“Isn’t he the guy who finishes off his opponents with one punch? My master told me he’s from the Heavenly Fist Mountain.”

“He’s a tough guy, but we should be able to take him down if we work together, right?”

All three of them were deep in thought, just about to fight them.

However, the woman came to a sudden halt exactly at that moment.

“What’s the matter?”

The young man in the lead was stunned; he also decided to stop.

“D-Don’t go there.” The woman changed her expression in shock. “There’s something wrong with them. There’s a lot of identity badges near their hill.”

“A lot of identity badges?” The young man in the lead was stunned. “Aren’t they what we need? Let’s take them all. We already have enough, but the more we have, the better we’ll prove that we’re the best Fate State cultivators in the galaxy!”

“There’s hundreds of them...”

The woman could barely speak. Her pupils contracted right then, as she put on an expression of disbelief and fright. Her hazy golden eyes noticed that the young man who was drinking on the hill suddenly turned his head and locked eyes with her, in a casual and cold manner; it was as if he were right next to her. He looked her dead in the eye from that distance!

The guy noticed me!

How is that possible?

The golden light in the woman’s eyes was gone, and they turned brown. She urged in shock, “Let’s go! Something is seriously wrong with that guy!”

She was the first to turn around and flee after that.

Her teammates were definitely surprised; they had never seen her frightened like that.

They had no chance to ask, so they quickly followed her. It wasn’t until they were hundreds of kilometers away that the leader finally asked, “What did you see?”

The woman stopped and breathed heavily. She looked back with golden pupils and saw nobody was chasing them. She finally took a breath of relief. “Fist King is terrifying!”

“What?”

Her teammates looked at each other in bewilderment.

“Fist King was sitting on that hill where the hundreds of badges were lying around! They were drinking and talking without trying to hide. They were obviously waiting to kill anyone who went after them. Also, the guy noticed my presence when I could hardly see him clearly!” said the woman in haste, as if she couldn’t wait to spill out everything she saw.

Her teammates were stunned by the revelation. The leader frowned and asked, “Are you sure?”

Hundreds of identity badges? Did the guy defeat hundreds of opponents?

Even if he hadn’t, it was still quite shocking for him to have gathered that many.

“I am!”

The woman nodded solemnly. “It would have been hard if we did try to challenge them. Even if we could win, we would have to pay a heavy price. Someone might have been knocked out of the match!”

Everybody fell silent after hearing that.

A man who had looted hundreds of identity badges was indeed strong enough to eliminate one of them.

“I didn’t know that Fist King was this difficult to deal with. Never mind. Let’s just avoid him.” The leader frowned angrily, but decided to consider the big picture.

They had robbed everybody they had run into, never backing out from a fight, but they ended up fleeing at the sight of Su Ping in the distance. Those who watched this happen on the stream were in awe of Su Ping.

Time flew by.

Those who were still alive had learned to hide and move prudently.

Su Ping attacked less and less frequently; a lot of people had run away in fear the moment they saw the stack of identity badges near him.

Those badges were like bones buried at the foot of the hill. It was scary.

The survival test was soon coming to an end.

In the last two federal hours—

More people were active at the moment; many of the ones who had been hiding didn’t have enough identity badges. They had to take their chances towards the end of the test.

Soon after, someone noticed the identity badges next to Su Ping.

“Two more to go!

“I only need two more badges to advance!”

A young man was hiding in a shadow in the secondary space; the shadow was so hazy that it would be barely noticeable even if someone flew past him.

He was currently peeping at the hill in front of him through a needle-point hole.

There were plenty of badges at the foot of the hill.

He hesitated for a long time as he looked at the hilltop.

The three participants up there were cultivating at the moment; it seemed that nobody had noticed the place.

However, he knew that the badges were probably a trap.

Otherwise, who would have dropped them instead of pocketing them?

The countdown was nearing the fated zero, so the young man couldn’t wait any longer; he merged with his pet and activated a forbidden skill he knew.

Whoosh!

He blinked and reached the foot of the hill like a ghost. He grabbed three identity badges and flashed away, breaking into the tertiary space.

He instantly traversed a thousand kilometers!

Once he was at a safe distance, the young man finally returned to the secondary space and covered himself with the fog again.

He looked at the three identity badges in his hand, almost unable to believe he had successfully stolen them.

The tokens carried a special energy; they couldn’t be forged.

He scanned the environment and found that the trio didn’t make a move to chase after him. He was ecstatic, not expecting that his plan could really work out!
