Chapter 1356 Deterrence (1)

Is there a traitor?

A lot of thoughts flashed through Hei Huang’s heart in the end, but he could not think any further.

The sword aura of causality contained the power of Su Ping’s universe. It destroyed his universe as well as his body and soul!

Su Ping’s constitution of the Primitive Chaos Clan was made of many constitutions, such as the Original Soul Entity, the Divine Body and the Ancient Deity constitutions. Once they merged and evolved into that of the Primitive Chaos Clan, they didn’t just disappear; instead, they stayed in Su Ping’s body, like the Golden Crow bloodline, giving his attack a lot more attributes.

“What’s that noise?”

Outside the palace—both disciples and guards realized that something was wrong. They rushed in, even without their master’s permission.

After they broke into the palace, they witnessed a scene they would never forget.

Their master was seated in his throne, with a shocked and frightened face. There were three bloody holes on his chest and forehead. Not a wisp of vitality remained!

The entire palace was silent and cold, like hell itself. After being dazed for a moment, they recovered and rushed over crazily to check their master’s injury. One of the Heavenly Lords hurriedly reversed time and space in an attempt to bring their master back to life. However, even though time and space changed, their master remained motionless on the throne.

While time rolled backwards in the palace and a lot of people appeared and disappeared, Hei Huang was as dead as a still rock. He simply sat on the throne.

...

He couldn’t be brought back to life by reversing time and space!

Their master was dead within the limits of time and space that the Heavenly Lord disciple could manipulate, which ranged from the past thousand years and the thousand years to follow. It meant that the attack had killed all of their master’s presence during those two thousand years!

What a cruel and terrifying attack!

That was only the time and space that Heavenly Lord disciple could reverse.

“It doesn’t work!”

The disciple breathed heavily, nearly exhausted.

Despair and fright appeared in his face; his head even went blank for a moment.

As a matter of fact, he knew he couldn’t change anything by reversing time and space when he confirmed his master’s death.

After all, his master could have blocked the attack on his own if he could revive his master by reversing time and space!

“What happened? Master was fine a moment ago…” The disciple who was ordered to activate the array had finally returned. He was shocked by the scene.

“Let me see what happened!” The disciple who reversed time and space had a contorted face. He felt grieved by the death of his master, and also terrified as he stood inside the palace; his master’s murderer was very likely still lurking about, while he was still in the open.

He knew it would be pointless to escape if the guy could kill his master without alerting anyone.

.

This time, he reversed time and space again, but he didn’t focus on master. Instead, his power covered the temple as he hoped to dig out the truth.

Soon after, time was rolled back to a few minutes earlier. They then saw the horrifying scene that took place in the palace.

as

It was only a harmless projection; they only saw a few green lights darting in. Their master unleashed his universe in an attempt to resist the attack, only to be run through and killed while seated on his throne.

After that, they rushed into the palace.

None of them could believe it.

Their master had died… Just like that?

They didn’t see the war-like scenario they expected, or any enemy. There were only a few green lights, and their master died on the spot. He couldn’t fight back, at all!

Almost instantly, everybody’s hearts were enshrouded by a great fear. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

What kind of existence executed our master?

Meanwhile, in the conference room inside the Astral Nexus

Once he felt causality disperse, Su Ping said slowly, “Hei Huang is already dead. Is anyone else going to disobey?”

“What?!”

Everybody present was shocked.

Shen Huang, Xu Kong and Chi Huo were the most shocked of all. They looked at Su Ping in fright, knowing he wasn’t just bluffing.

Does it mean that Su Ping truly killed Hei Huang in such a short amount of time?

Su Ping’s body is still in Shen Huang’s room!

Part of his consciousness was even invested in the Astral Nexus session.

He can kill a Celestial cultivator from such a distance, in that status?

They were absolutely astounded, but they had to believe it was true.

“Who are you trying to fool?”.

The other Celestials sobered up and looked at Su Ping with shock and suspicion. One of them became sullen and said, “I didn’t expect you to be sordid enough to ambush Hei Huang during the meeting. Still, I don’t think Hei Huang would die that easily. He and I survived the dangerous Tianyu Mysterious Realm together; his survival abilities are beyond your wildest imagination!”

Su Ping glanced at him coldly, not bothering to waste time talking back. He turned around and said to his master, “Master, do you have people posted in the Black Desolation Star Zone? Or maybe, just invite his disciples over; let them check their master’s status and you’ll know if I’m lying.”

Shen Huang snapped out of his shock and immediately said, “I’ll make arrangements.”

He didn’t say anything out loud. Of course, he had spies watching in the Black Desolation Star Zone, and many other star zones for that matter. Similarly, there were other star zones’ spies in his Celestial Court; it was an unspoken but mutual understanding. Some of the spies were obvious, while others were so well hidden that even he didn’t know about them.
