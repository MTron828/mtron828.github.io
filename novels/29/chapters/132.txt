Chapter 133 Clash Between Academies

“You don’t?” The crew cut guy frowned and stepped in front of Su Ping’s bicycle, before he put a foot on the front wheel. He used so much force that the frame of the wheel squeaked terribly under the pressure.

“Kid, Ye Hao is the yearly tournament champion of your academy, and you’re telling me you don’t know him? Don’t give me that sh*t!” The offender looked as if he wanted to pull his hands out of his pockets and punch Su Ping already.

But he was stopped by one of his companions, who called to him with a cold voice, “Don’t cause trouble, Dai Yan.”

Dai Yan frowned again and stepped away, after which he gave Su Ping a threatening stare. “Don’t mess with me like that, kid, or I’ll show you...”

That was a bluff. He knew that he probably wouldn’t meet this random student from another academy again.

Su Ping didn’t answer because he had been checking his wheel.

Next, he slowly looked up and glared at the crew cut man. “Huh? What ‘ya looking at—”

The man didn’t get to finish his words when his body left the ground, before being slammed back down by an invisible force as if a wrestler was pummeling him. It happened too fast that he never had any time to prepare his astral power to defend his body.

He coughed up a puddle of blood under the shock and gasped for air on the floor.

“Hmph.” Su Ping looked elsewhere and rode away.

Someone had damaged his bike, so he wanted some payback. As simple as that.

Dai Yan’s partners were still recovering from what they had just seen. Dai Yan was one of their stronger members, yet he got squashed under a second without anyone touching him?

“You-stop right there!” A shorter, plump-bodied man rushed behind Su Ping.

Su Ping scowled impatiently and looked back, only to see all seven of them rushing to surround him.

Dai Yan exhaled a painful breath while resting on the shoulder of his friend. He gave Su Ping a hateful stare.

“Playing dirty with me, huh??”

He didn’t see Su Ping moving at all. The only explanation he could think of was that Su Ping used some kind of secret move. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meanwhile, the other seven people carefully inspected Su Ping from head to toe. If Su Ping could beat up Dai Yan so badly, even by using hidden tricks, they wouldn’t treat him lightly.

A man with a bulky build spoke next, “You be quiet, Dai Yan. We came to prepare for the coming contest, not to pick up fights. People will laugh at us if anyone saw you getting crushed at the front door of their academy!”

“Crush?? He was the one playing dirty tricks first! What would you do in my shoes, huh?!” Dai Yan yelled back.

“Hmph. Getting ambushed so easily only means that you’re weak.” The bulky man looked at Su Ping again. “You, tell me your name. I’ll challenge you.”

Seeing their strong friend making such a decision, the others silently gave Su Ping a sympathetic look.

By then, Su Ping more or less knew what these people were doing, which was not his concern.

“I’m in a hurry here. Move along.”

“You hit our guy, and you want to get away with it?” The bulky man gave Su Ping a mocking smile while not moving out of his way.

Su Ping sighed.

Trouble never ends, eh?

He hopped off the bicycle, parked it aside, and turned around to look at the group of students who probably came from another academy in the city.

He soon found the biggest threat, which wasn’t the big man talking to him, but another man in white who looked rather handsome by normal standards. This man was inconspicuously showing a high level of astral power. Also, he was the one who tried stopping the crew cut guy back there.

“Say, if I win, will the rest of you come up one by one and waste my time?” Su Ping spoke to the bulky figure addressing him.

Several of them laughed at that, while the bulky man raised an eyebrow in bewilderment.

“You got guts, kid. Do you think you can actually—”

Su Ping interrupted him with great impatience. “Yes or no? Just tell me already.”

“You little—” The bulky man grew furious as several blood vessels dangerously pulsed on his neck.

“Is this how Phoenix Peak Academy acts? They’re a fun bunch, you know that?” a man teased.

“Yeah. Are all the students like this guy? Cute.”

“Hey, Bear? He doesn’t give a sh*t about ya, see that? I never thought I’d see something like this in my life, HA!”

“oi kid! Do your worst! If you can beat up Bear, I’ll have some fun with you next.”

Su Ping shook his head while listening to the unproductive gibberish. Then he looked at the man in white, who had remained quiet all this time.

“Can you tell me? If I deal with this big one, will you leave me alone?”.

Luo Fengtian wasn’t expecting Su Ping to suddenly talk to him. He saw Su Ping’s serious look and felt something was off.

“No, I’m afraid not.”

“For the love of—fine. Hey, you lots. Come at me together, will you? Don’t keep me waiting.” Su Ping’s careless words silenced everyone.

Together?

They thought Su Ping was being cocky enough by speaking to their bulky partner so rudely. They weren’t expecting for things to take another turn for the worse.

They were the top eight of their academy when it came to fighting. Someone wished to challenge them to a group fight alone? This was so stupid!

Every one of them looked pissed off when Su Ping taunted all of them so openly, including Dai Yan, who couldn’t believe that such a madman had just wounded him.
