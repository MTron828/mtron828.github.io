Chapter 1165: Shocking Four Worlds

The expressions of both Emperor Ye and the Rain Emperor changed, reflecting not only shock, but also exasperation.

They felt insulted by Su Ping’s behavior!

“Don’t waste time talking to that garbage. Kill them all!”

Coldness manifested in Emperor Ye’s eyes; he knew that other high-ranked gods were watching. He wouldn’t kill Su Pin directly to preserve his clan’s dignity.

However, Su Ping had been leveraging that to his advantage, humiliating their clan nonstop.

So, might as well bury them all!

“Close off the mountain and annihilate them!” Emperor Ye said to the Rain Emperor.

The latter replied gloomily, “Once the mountain closes, it will forever be a taint on our clan’s reputation. None of them will leave today. However, we cannot kill them in a fit of rage; we’ll kill those ignorant bastards fair and square, making everybody compliment us in the process!”

There was a slightly different expression on Emperor Ye’s face. He asked, “Are you truly going to fight this brat? He’s just an insignificant ant…” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He found it disgraceful to fight Su Ping directly, even while limiting his own cultivation. It was disgraceful for an emperor to compete with a beggar.

“Why not?”

The Rain Emperor, however, replied telepathically, “There were once Ancestral Gods who sacrificed themselves to stop floods, and made friends with inferior creatures. This human brat has arrogantly challenged us; it would be our gift to him if we accept his challenge instead of delivering punishment for his lack of respect. Even if we kill him, history will still be in our favor!”

Emperor Ye frowned, knowing that the other had a point.

However, his anger was such that he wanted to kill everyone and end that bumming folly as soon as possible.

“He’s all yours,” said the Rain Emperor.

Emperor Ye was stunned. “Me? Aren’t you fighting?”

“I’m the clan master. How could I possibly fight him?”

“…”

Emperor Ye was lost for words.?You’ve accepted the challenge, and yet you’re asking me to take part in this embarrassing battle. That’s truly…

He didn’t say anything, knowing it was impossible for the Rain Emperor to actually fight. The latter represented the dignity of the Rain Clan, and that human eyesore wasn’t qualified to fight him!

Emperor Ye stepped up and said indifferently, “Brat, you are one arrogant human being. I’ll teach you a good lesson on behalf of your parents. Are you prepared to pay your tuition?”

“I am not arrogant; all humans are kind hearted, and they keep a low profile. I’m just talking about this matter. By the way, you could have sent a more capable rival,” Su Ping said calmly, diverting the blame aimed at him. He could leave the Archean Divinity at any moment, but he couldn’t let the local humans suffer because of him.

Emperor Ye became cold; his determination to kill that seemingly sly little fellow grew. There were other things he could say, but it would be demeaning to say them.

Being the God Emperor that he was, it was unbefitting of him to argue with a piece of garbage.

“Since you wanted to challenge me, I’ll give you an opportunity to experience real power!” Emperor Ye snorted and strode towards Su Ping. He quickly suppressed his aura, lowering it until he was on par with Su Ping.

“Emperor Ye accepted his challenge. How merciful!”

“If I were him, I would have snapped my fingers and killed that delusional son of a bi*ch!”

“Emperor Ye surely wants him to die without raising complaints; as expected of an emperor of our clan. Other gods should learn from his lenience!”

All the Rain Clan gods were shocked and excited, eager to see Emperor Ye tear Su Ping apart.

The middle-aged man with a feather crown and his partners’ expressions changed, not expecting Emperor Ye to actually accept Su Ping’s rude challenge.

“We’re screwed. Damn it; we should’ve stopped him.”

The human elder and the others could only blame themselves.

They thought that Su Ping was making such bold declarations only because he was young and reckless. Indeed, they were shocked by his talent, but that wasn’t nearly enough to even compare to Emperor Ye.

It wasn’t just about the difference in relation to small worlds, but also about the understanding of power.

When someone of a lower level used a tiny amount of power, it would be as vulnerable as a wisp of smoke—

But when it came to emperors, they could wield the same amount of power like a sharp needle.

“Come here and prepare to die.”

Emperor Ye was standing still, looking down at Su Ping indifferently. The man sounded as if he were issuing a command, or handing a gift.

His expression ever calm, Su Ping said, “Let’s not rush into anything. If I win this battle, you’ll release all the humans you caught and never bother them again. Agreed?”

“Ha.”

Emperor Ye sneered. “So that’s what you’re up to. You want to save them all by yourself? You’re rather bold; unfortunately, you’re just an unworthy ant. Beings of your sort don’t get to negotiate with me.”

“Unworthy? Me? It’s more like you don’t dare to accept,” said the indifferent Su Ping outright, “All of them are suffering because of me; it is only natural that I should rescue them. Aren’t you trying to avenge that prince of yours I killed? The previous battle surely made it obvious that I killed him fair and square!

“I killed him in the Heaven Path Institute’s arena while everyone was watching. Not once did I cheat!

“He deserved death, and yet you try to avenge him. Aren’t these the actions of sore losers?”

Emperor Ye snorted. “Cut the crap. I’m being merciful enough by giving you an opportunity to attack. The chance will be gone if you waste more time talking!”

Su Ping’s face became even colder. He said, “You don’t dare respond to what I said? Let me ask you. If I beat you, can you or can’t you release them? Just look for me if you have a problem with me. Don’t you have any balls?”

There was a slight change in Emperor Ye’s expression. The Rain Clan gods were similarly shocked and infuriated. Their understanding about arrogance was increasingly improved thanks to Su Ping’s words.?This brat should be killed a million times over!

Emperor Ye’s eyes were tearing Su Ping apart like cold nails. He said, “All right,”Search our n?wno?el.?rg” I accept your terms. I won’t punish you for stealing our ultimate treasure if you win. Everyone shall be released!

“However, if you lose…”

He put on a bloodthirsty smile. “Everybody will pay the price for your arrogance and impudence!”

“How will the winner be decided?” Su Ping asked back.

“When the other party dies; how else can you know if the utmost effort was applied?” Emperor Ye sneered.

Su Ping nodded. “All right. The battle will be over until one party is completely dead. In the case of a tie, are we going to keep fighting forever?”

Emperor Ye said impatiently, “Why are you so talkative? A tie? You’re overthinking; I’ll make sure that you instantly experience real power. There won’t be room for a tie.”

“Anything can happen. For instance, the prince of a high-ranked clan was killed by a human in the Celestial God State,” said Su Ping indifferently, “Better not be too confident there.”

Emperor Ye almost wanted to shred Su Ping’s mouth. The guy had been challenging his patience time and again by mentioning the prince’s death. He was obviously provoking the god to act irrationally.

“You’ll win if you’re still alive two hours from now,” said Emperor Ye coldly, “on the premise that neither party uses any external help or weapons.”

Su Ping nodded. “I like that. However, I expected a shorter amount of time. So, even a God Warrior still needs two hours to finish me off.”

There was a booming sound; the void around Emperor Ye cracked. A tiny fraction of his power was leaked, making the void shake.

“Brat, don’t try my patience; I’m already being extremely merciful by accepting your challenge!” said Emperor Ye coldly.

Su Ping knew the man was about to lose it, just by looking at his scary face. He stopped taunting him and said, “All right. Bring it on.”

“Wait.”

The feather-crowned man next to Su Ping said, “If it’s a duel, it should be done in a fair manner. Don’t you agree, Emperor Ye?”

Emperor Ye offered a cold reply, “What are you getting at?”

“Even though you’ve suppressed your level to match his, you still have the body of a God Warrior; you can destroy him a billion times over with physical strength alone. In the spirit of fairness, it would be better to create a Celestial God State clone before you fight him,” proposed the feather-crowned senior.

Emperor Ye snorted. “That’s unnecessary. What’s the point? He’ll be instantly killed by me anyway!”

The human leader shook his head in silence while wearing a smile.

Emperor Ye didn’t bother talking any longer; he restored his majestic aura and condensed divine light in his hand. Soon after, a Celestial God State figure with a face resembling him was constructed in the void.

Creating a life out of nothing was simpler than eating and drinking for God Emperors.

“Are we good now?” asked Emperor Ye grimly.

The feather-crowned senior gave him a slight nod, then looked at everybody else in silence.

They had realized Su Ping’s intention, but they didn’t think the latter could possibly defeat an emperor.

They were aiming to find an opportunity to rescue all the imprisoned humans while Su Ping fought the emperor.

It would indeed be a violation based on what the fighters had agreed upon, but it was important to save all those lives; they could make amends later.

“What a shame. To think a great talent such as him would emerge amongst our race; too bad he’s going to die young.”

“All shooting stars are short-lived; that’s why they’re beautiful.”

“He’s too bold and reckless. He would have surely become an emperor too, if he could have hidden his edge and kept a low profile. What a shame!”

All the human experts heaved regretful sighs.

They didn’t blame Su Ping, though. The latter had indeed caused the situation, but he had killed the clan’s prince in a consensual duel; nobody could really blame him.

They could only blame the Rain Clan for being petty, as they retaliated against humanity as a whole.

“This is exactly what major clans of this world do…” The feather-crowned senior shook his head with glittering eyes.

“What a waste of time. You proposed the challenge, and yet you’ve added all those rules. Don’t worry, it won’t take two hours; you won’t even feel much pain.” The Celestial God clone walked towards Su Ping with a cold smile; his every step was intimidating, seemingly moving in the void.

His route became unpredictable. He was walking slowly, one step after the other; however, hundreds of people were gradually emerging from the void around him.

Those were not his other clones; he had simply summoned himself from different points in time by using a mysterious technique.

Su Ping was alarmed; emperor-level experts were indeed not to be underestimated. It was the first time for him to fight such a formidable being.

He had seen people just as powerful, but actually fighting them had yet to happen. He would have been killed instantly, if the situation came to pass, not even realizing how he died in the end.

Even though the two were currently on the same level, Su Ping was still unsure about winning.

That was why he had set up that many rules and restrictions.

He had to survive for two hours!

Let’s find the gap between me and an emperor when we’re on the same level. How much more strength inside me can I dig out??Su Ping took a deep breath and adjusted himself to be at his peak status; the four supreme laws circulated inside his body endlessly. He was permanently kept in his best status.

Abundant, ancient deity aura was being radiated by his body. His body changed gradually; his hair became white like silver threads, with a sheen of deity aura.

His eyebrows had also turned white, and his pupils silver; he was bearing an old and distant aura.

Su Ping showed his real capabilities while facing Emperor Ye.

He revealed the ancient deity constitution he had just cultivated. A scorching aura was gathered behind his back, forming the wings of a Golden Crow.

The primordial aura made all the Rain Clan gods narrow their eyes.

The feather-crowned senior and the others were just as surprised.?Is it the extinct bloodline of gods and devils?

“Humph!”

Emperor Ye narrowed his eyes, realizing that Su Ping didn’t try his best in the last battle; there was indeed something.

But that wasn’t nearly good enough!

“I cultivated five small worlds when I was a God Warrior!

“Let me show you what the real power of worlds is like!”

An illusion emerged behind Emperor Ye’s back, just like a blooming lotus flower. It had many layers of brilliant and magnificent small worlds. The sight was breathtaking.

Five overlapping small worlds!

Such a wonder bedazzled all the Rain Clan gods.

Is that what their Emperor Ye was capable of?

“Five small worlds!”

The feather-crowned senior and the others had barely perceptible changes of expressions. Emperor Ye was almost cheating; his level and body were in the Celestial God State; he used the five small worlds he didn’t grasp until he became a God Warrior. The gap between him and Su Ping was too massive!

Su Ping’s expression changed a bit. He had known that every emperor had to be an unparalleled genius, but seeing one with their own eyes was still shocking.

He clenched his sword and infused it with all his power. At the same time, the power inside his body rose and reached the maximum. A brand-new silver colored illusion came out from the mist, back on the top of triple small worlds. It was none other than the Small Deity World, his fourth small world!
