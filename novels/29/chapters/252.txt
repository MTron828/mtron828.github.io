Chapter 255 Shocking

There was no way to negotiate with Su Ping. Song Lu had a headache and could only ask Mu Shuangwan for help.

Despite being a first-rate manager, her artful speech and eloquence were completely ineffective against Su Ping. The latter did not give her the chance to use them. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After Mu Shuangwan found out about the matter, she could only report it to the president. She was willing to bear the consequences.

After some discussion, and seeing that there was no way to salvage the situation, Star Entertainment Agency fulfilled the contract in the end and helped Su Ping contact all the popular platforms he had arranged beforehand. The first promotion was released.

After all, they would have to pay a large amount of compensation if they broke the contract.

Since things had come to this, they left it to fate.

That night.

Countless onlookers were gathered on various popular platforms. Some were live-streaming platforms, some were comprehensive search platforms, and some were news platforms.

At 8 p.m., a new splash screen popped up on all the platforms.

Usually, those splash screens were used to promote new dramas or hot topics, but at this moment, they were pointing at a shop.

Elite League! Guaranteed top ten!

Eight large words appeared on the page, instantly attracting the attention of countless people.

Since the Elite League was nearing, everyone was paying attention to it. Any news related to the Elite League would attract a lot of attention, not to mention the headlines.

Guaranteed to be in the top 10?

Soon after, the splash screen showed the introduction of the pet store.

There were several service prices and different combos.

There was a combo that guaranteed entry into the top 100 of the Longjiang League!

A combo that guaranteed entry into the top ten!

Professional training-one million astral coins!

Ordinary training—100,000 astral coins...

The prices of the various services were very clear in the ad.

When people saw that the so-called “guaranteed entry into the top ten,” as the main title instead of a subtext, the internal network of the base city erupted with fervor.

The Pixie Pet Store’s fame rose to the top in an instant. Almost everyone knew about it overnight.

“What kind of shop is this? How dare they guarantee entering the top ten?!”

“Holy sh*t, this is the Elite League, isn’t this shop making too grand a claim? Can they really guarantee it?!”

“I’ve never heard of this pet store before.”

“I heard it opened in the slums. Are the slums’ poor so crazy over money that they’ll make any claim?!”

“There’s also Mu Shuangwan’s endorsement? To earn this kind of scam money, I don’t know about you, but I’ll definitely become a fan!”

“Maybe there’s some mighty person backing this store. I’ll go and take a look tomorrow to see what’s going on.” Many controversial comments could be seen in the various promotional comment sections. Most of them were doubtful, but there were even more people who were extremely curious about this shop. After all, even if they wanted to tempt fate, there was no reason to use such a suicidal method. They might manage to earn some money, but they wouldn’t feel at peace.

Not long after the publicity event began

The battle of Mu Shuangwan’s fans ended up with the fans losing, causing countless criticisms to flood the board.

Star Entertainment Agency was in a public relations crisis and had to work overtime that night.

“Damn it, I knew this would be the result!”

In the office, the president was furious and scolded Song Lu.

Song Lu was trembling with fear. She lowered her head and did not dare to make a sound.

Mu Shuangwan sat on a chair, her brows furrowed, somewhat worried.

“Right now, the Internet is filled with criticism and doubts. Liu Yuan, the owner of the extraordinary pet store, is not a simple character. He’s a member of the Liu family. He must have known about this already. It won’t be long before he sends reinforcements on the Internet!

“This promotion is like a bomb that will blow up all of us!”

Mu Shuangwan listened in silence.

After a while, she said, “Maybe he really has a reason. Maybe he has a top-notch master trainer in his shop. After all, Venerable the Blade himself appeared in his shop before...”

“A top-notch master trainer? Hmph, if there’s really such a person, it would be more effective to get that person to step forward instead of getting you to be the spokesperson!” The president sneered. “Who knows if the person you saw at that time was the true Venerable the Blade. What kind of person is Venerable the Blade? Why would he show up at that place? Why would he expose and admit his identity?”.

Mu Shuangwan was slightly taken aback.

She had never thought about this. However, that person’s bearing and appearance did not seem to be a disguise.

“Immediately ask that foolish manager about what he’s going to do about the damage to your reputation. This is written in the contract. Get him to prepare the compensation!” The president scoffed and waved his hand.

At the same time, somewhere else.

Uptown, Primo headquarters.

That was a specially-built building. Outside was Primo’s trademark sign board.

“Boss, that shop is causing trouble again.”

“To think he guaranteed entry into the top ten of the competition. He must be crazy.”

“It’s probably because he was forced into a corner. Even a rabbit would bite when anxious. Heh heh, to kill the enemy, one must go crazy first.”

A few senior executives of the company were sitting together, chatting and laughing. In front of their meeting table sat a tall middle-aged man with a refined and gentle face. He was obviously a kind person, who had a gentle smile on his face.

“Have you investigated the background of this store?” the middle-aged man asked.

He was the owner of Primo, Liu Yuan.

“Boss, I’ve already sent people to investigate, but what’s strange is that the Municipal Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau are ignoring us,” a middle-aged manager in a beige suit said with a puzzled expression. With their shop’s and Liu Yuan’s background, it would be easy for them to carry out investigations. However, they had been met with a lot of obstacles.

The surname of Pixie’s boss was Su, not Qin, nor Mu, so what background could he have? The Liu family was the third largest family in the Longjiang Base City. Other than those with the surname Qin and the surname Mu who were untouchable... Wouldn’t others be easily bullied?

“You failed?” Liu Yuan frowned slightly.

Another older elder thought for a while and suggested, “Looks like this shop isn’t simple. Could the boy claiming to run the place be a puppet? Is someone behind all of this?”

Liu Yuan’s eyes flickered as he said, “I will contact the mayor later. Send some people to wait outside the shop. Keep me up to date with the latest situation there.”

“Yes, boss.”

“Oh no, boss!”

At this moment, the meeting room’s door was suddenly pushed open and a panicked young secretary rushed in.

That was Liu Yuan’s secretary; he had always exercised self-restraint and only employed male secretaries.

“Eh?”

Liu Yuan frowned. His secretary would not be so unruly unless there was something serious.

“Speak.”

“Boss, watch this video.”

The young secretary hurriedly ran over and handed the phone to Liu Yuan.

While everyone on the Longjiang intranet was doubting the pet store, a few videos that had been taken by a nosy person were posted on a pet forum.

There was a shop in the video.

The shop’s signboard was “Pixie.”

The electric signboard shone brightly under the night sky. The camera slowly shifted to the front of the shop’s door. The door had a statue and a wide staircase, making it look like a grand mansion.

However, the most eye-catching thing was the huge shadow beside the door.

It was a dragon.

The filming wasn’t clear as it seemed to have been late at night, but one could tell it was a dragon from the silhouette. Something seemed to be rising from the dragon’s body, as if flames were dancing.

The number of views on the video increased rapidly, attracting countless comments. In particular, the OP’s comments got the video pinned on the forum. “OP, are you kidding me? Is that an Inferno Dragon?” “It looks like a dragon.” “It’s an adult, but it only recently became one from the looks of it.”

“OP said that this is an Inferno Dragon? Stop joking. I’ll bet fifty cents that this is an Earth Dragon.”

“Cut it out. There’s a HD version of it in another video. This is a real Inferno Dragon. I’m already on my way to this shop. I want to show my face among the top ten of the Elite League this time!”

There were countless comments below.

This time, there wasn’t a one-sided doubt, but rather, it attracted more curiosity. Some even claimed that they had seen a real Inferno Dragon at the Pixie Pet Store’s entrance.

The debate continued, and everyone waited for a clear answer.

“That is... an Inferno Dragon!”

Liu Yuan’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at the dragon that was occupying the screen. Although the filming wasn’t very clear and perhaps it was because the place was too shabby since it didn’t have any street lamps, he could tell at a glance that it was an Inferno Dragon! An extremely rare top-notch dragon !

As someone who had opened a pet store for many years, his observations about all kinds of pets could be described as meticulous. There was no way he could be mistaken.

That shop had actually placed an Inferno Dragon at the entrance. Was this a showcase of their confidence?

Liu Yuan’s face darkened. No matter where the Inferno Dragon came from, the fact that it had been able to get such a pet showed that this store was not as simple as it seemed. It wasn’t as simple as a nouveau riche spending some money to hire a celebrity as a spokesperson.

W

One had to know that a top-notch rare dragon like that was not something that could be bought with money. One had to rely on connections, channels, and social networking

After all, it was a top-notch dragon pet. If trained properly, it could even be used as a main battle pet by a Titled expert. Moreover, it could raise a Titled expert’s status to be one of the best among his peers. “Damn it!”

He exerted some force with his palm and the phone was crushed.

The other executives and the young secretary were shocked when they saw his ferocious expression. They had never seen him lose his composure like that.

The executives looked at each other and realized that something was wrong.

“Prepare the car. I need to return to the Liu family estate.”

“Ah, oh, yes, yes...”

Before leaving, Liu Yuan said coldly to the executives, “You guys, send someone to keep an eye on this shop. I want to know everything that happens there!”

The few of them hurriedly agreed, but their hearts were pounding. Could it be that they had provoked a tough cookie?

mon

As time passed, the Pixie Pet Store became more and more famous. The true face of the dragon pet outside the pet store had been captured by some media outlets with acute noses. It was the rumored Inferno Dragon!

Instantly, the entire Longjiang intranet boiled with excitement!
