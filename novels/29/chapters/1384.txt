“You can practice with Anna for now. It’s not that easy to give away Dao Hearts. Both you and I have to make some preparations,” said Su Ping to the ones interested.

Considering his current capabilities, giving away Dao Hearts was a rather tiresome task.

Even the elders of the Heaven Path Institute would only give lectures after becoming God Emperors.

It was very difficult to give away Dao Hearts.

“What preparations do we have to make?” asked Chi Huo in a hurry.

!!

“The Dao Hearts I’ll be handing out are too powerful; you’re too weak to accept them completely right now. You may become corrupted and turn into puppets of the Great Dao if the Dao Heart is beyond what you can bear,” said Su Ping, citing the knowledge he had read from the library of the Heaven Path Institute.

Everybody exchanged bewildered looks, not sure whether to feel delighted or regretful.

Their delight was in knowing that Su Ping’s Dao Hearts were very powerful. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such a concern.

They knew that their chances to become universe dominators were almost zero with their own potential. It was also evidence that they had fully developed their limited potential.

“Then, how strong must we become before we can accept the Dao Hearts?” asked one of the Celestials.

Su Ping thought for a moment and said, “You should at least be able to fight Anna and end in a tie.”

“That’s all?”

Stunned, everybody looked at the blond girl by Su Ping’s side. The latter had just asked her to teach them. Is she really far stronger than us?

Joanna, however, turned around and looked at Su Ping with glittering eyes. “In other words, I can accept a Dao Heart too?”

Su Ping was taken aback. He asked, “You want one, too?”

“Of course I do.”

Joanna continued without hesitation, “Although I’m confident of becoming a God Emperor on my own, why should I waste my time if there’s a Dao Heart for free? Besides, you said that the Dao Hearts are powerful. If so, they’re good enough. God Emperors are top figures of every family, even back in the primordial times.

“Above them are unpredictable beings such as the Ancestral Gods. It’s already many people’s lifelong pursuit to become a God Emperor.”

Su Ping felt dazed for a moment, noticing how solemn she was. On second thought, it did make sense.

Perhaps he had become too used to those existences since he had often practiced with God Emperors and encountered powerful, ferocious beasts.

However, God Emperors were rare experts in any cultivation site—

They could sweep across his universe. They were also revered giants, even in the Archean Divinity.

“All right, if you want, I’ll give you one when there’s a chance,” said Su Ping. Considering her combat ability, she was technically ready to digest an unparalleled Dao Heart.

Joanna flashed a smile, seeing that Su Ping accepted her request; instantly, the entire store became brighter. All the Celestial State experts were in awe.

“Can we practice now?” a Celestial expert asked, “I want to find out how far I am from being qualified.”

Although they had doubts about Joanna’s strength, Su Ping was very confident in her and she had to be special. None of them dared to underestimate her.

“Fine by me; we’re not doing business anyway,” said Joanna casually.

“Go and practice then. It would be better for all to take this opportunity and figure out where you stand. It’ll also help you get to know your own strength better,” said Su Ping.

Everybody followed Joanna to the test room.

Su Ping didn’t go in. Instead, he harnessed some laws and built a planet outside the store. After all, a prerequisite to establish a store was for the place to be located on a planet. Su Ping had to ensure that there was a planet as the store’s base.

However, thanks to how he twisted laws, the mass and density of said planet were changed greatly. It was even narrowed down to the size of a grain of dust.

If anyone were to observe that micro world, they would find that amazing scene.

After doing that, Su Ping released some of the figures from his small universe and asked them to live on the planet outside his store and see about setting a residence.

The planet was protected by laws. Su Ping wasn’t worried about anything happening to them. As long as they didn’t approach a member of the Heavens too closely, that would just be an inconspicuous grain of dust.

Su Ping found Nie Huofeng, the Blue Planet’s acting overlord, and asked him to maintain order.

Su Ping had never set foot on the Blue Planet after winning the Universe Geniuses’ Contest. However, his feats were spread throughout the universe. The news reached the planet since it was reconnected to the Federation. This time, he didn’t even greet his old acquaintances when he took them into his small universe.

Nie Huofeng had obviously grown unused to meeting. He knew that Su Ping was very strong, but he didn’t expect him to become a top expert of the universe. How long has it been?

In terms of age, he had cultivated for a thousand years and was much older than Su Ping. He had only become a peak Star Lord after rejoining the Federation, and was but one step away from the Ascendant State.

The Ascendant realm was a major hurdle. Anyone who could reach that level before 10,000 years of age could be considered a genius.

Nie Huofeng instantly carried out Su Ping’s orders, and was very confident with the latter’s endorsement. Even while meeting with Ascendants, he wasn’t afraid of commanding them and sending them to the right places. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Order and prosperity were being restored on the planet where the store was located.
