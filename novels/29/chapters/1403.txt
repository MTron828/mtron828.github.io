Chapter 1404: Challenge (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You are the one behind the divine curse set by the Witch Mountain.”

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. The guy had basically acknowledged it without trying to cover it up.

Emperor Que snapped out of his stupor and said with his usual coldness, “What divine curse? I don’t know what you’re talking about. Instead of doing Dao Child things in the Heaven Path Institute you came to the Rain Clan’s territory to cause trouble. Not even the Institute can protect you today!”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. The guy had definitely not misspoken, but he was denying the matter about the divine curse. He simply didn’t want to get the Rain Clan publicly involved with the Witch Mountain, which was a taboo in the world of gods.

However, Su Ping read disdain and killing intent in Emperor Que’s eyes. He was clearly implying, ‘we did ask someone to cast the divine curse, what can you do’?

!!

As long as they never admitted to the fact, Su Ping would have no chance to sentence them.

However, they underestimated the young human’s temper. Su Ping didn’t go there because he cared about evidence. The guy was merely reluctant to admit what they did because he feared that other clans would look down on them.

“You are a high-ranked clan, and yet you asked someone from the Witch Mountain to curse me. Are you incapable of killing a Major God by yourselves?” Su Ping looked down at him. “Your prince offended me, so I killed him. You offended me too, and you will pay for it!”

“Offend?”

Emperor Que was infuriated by what Su Ping said. Fury rose in his eyes like waves. “Who do you think you are? A lowly human being. You think you deserve to be offended?”

He wasn’t angry because Su Ping killed the prince. It was because of the word “offend.”

In practice it would only be the juniors who could offend their betters.

Su Ping’s condescension was intolerable for him. Someone who had always looked down upon others was now facing a humble human who dared to look down upon him. Such arrogance was infuriating!

Su Ping sneered, noticing how exasperated the guy was. Some people were just like that; they could not tolerate being treated like they treated others.

“If I’m a lowly human, what was your prince who was at my level but ended up dying by my hand?”

Su Ping looked down at him and continued, “What are you who failed to kill me despite being a God Emperor?”

Emperor Que flew into an outrage. “Impudent! Die now!”

He suddenly took action. A divine spear was condensed in his hand all of a sudden, and he slashed toward Su Ping furiously.

After a boom, the void crumbled and the world seemed to be falling apart. That spear was unstoppable.

Coldness emanated from Su Ping’s eyes. He simply responded with a punch, not bothering to dodge. His fist carried such overwhelming power that he looked like a golden giant smashing down at Emperor Que.

With a bam, the spear struck the divine fist; it seemed to be the clash of a fist and a spear. In fact, it was the fierce collision of each other’s laws and universes.

“Phaseless Death!” Emperor Que roared and utilized the power of his Dao Heart, which was Phaseless Death; it could disintegrate all combined laws and reduce the enemy’s attacks to their original forms.

“Contract!”

Su Ping was also quick, releasing the power of his Dao Heart in an instant. The Great Dao condensed on his fist was quickly gathered as it was being dismembered. It was then condensed in a strange way, and was no longer disintegrated!

“My Dao Heart happens to suppress yours!” Su Ping came to that realization. There was coldness in his eyes. However, there was no delight; he was only bored. He was looking to find his limits in that place, and Emperor Que obviously couldn’t push him much.

“Rot in hell!”

The power in Su Ping’s body surged out, and he punched fiercely. After a bam, the spear was instantly crushed. His fist reached Emperor Que, who was flung backwards, penetrated the barrier above the mountains. Like a meteor, he darted into a mountain at a hundred times the speed of sound, collapsing the latter.

“Emperor Que has been defeated?!”

“That’s impossible!”

“Is that real or not? Who is that person?!”

Most of the Rain Clan’s people on the mountains were able to see their fight, except for the weaker ones.

Emperor Que had been smashed into the ground in their first clash!

Everybody found it hard to believe, especially the God Kings who had recognized Su Ping. They looked at the human with utmost shock.

The divine fist didn’t lose momentum, striking the barrier above the mountains and causing a loud noise.

Even the humble gods who didn’t have any talent in cultivation changed their expressions. They were unable to see the battle clearly, but the strike on the barrier suggested that the enemy had the upper hand.

After a boom, Emperor Que darted out of the mountain and glared at Su Ping with bloodshot eyes. “Damn you, bastard. I will kill you!”

“You can’t!”

Su Ping’s voice was indifferent, as if he was announcing a fact while stripped of all emotion. Such indifference further infuriated the god; his blood seemed to be burning.

He had ever been despised like that. The most embarrassing fact was that Su Ping was only a God King, and the guy had managed to wound him!

The moment Emperor Que was about to charge—a crack appeared in the void and several figures flashed out. A graceful woman stepped up and extended her fair hand, establishing a barrier that stopped Emperor Que. “Sir, please wait a moment.”
