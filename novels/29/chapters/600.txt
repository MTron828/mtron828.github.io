Chapter 603 The Real Hell

Su Ping felt relieved once Li Yuanfeng went inside the scroll. Li Yuanfeng was certainly a powerful fighter, but it was enough to run fast when escaping was the sole objective.

Su Ping put away the scroll and looked at the young man with crimson eyes that had yet to take any action.

He found interest and curiosity in that young man’s eyes. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The young man with crimson eyes pointed out, “You have Ashura energy and some strange Divine Energy. I don’t think you’re one of the regular human creatures.”

Su Ping darted him a glance and then teleported away at once.

Chatting?

No kidding. That beast king could chat with him but he would be courting death if he continued to stay there.

Those were the Deep Caves. More and more beast kings would arrive with every passing minute. He would be unable to escape if he was surrounded by beast kings!

He wasn’t even sure if that beast king was the biggest boss of the Deep Caves; it could very likely be another minion. It would be even more dangerous if the second case were true!

The crimson-eyed young man licked his lips as Su Ping dashed away. “The Ashura energy is so pure. Reaching that rank will no longer be a dream if I can get that...” said the young man, eager for a taste.

Buzzing!

He raised his hand. The space in front of him became twisted.

Thousands of meters away, the walls began to grow in front of Su Ping. It was more as if he were falling. He was being sucked into a folded space, like a bottled bug!

“Break!!” Su Ping shouted. He cut through the folded space with his sword.

Boom. He unleashed both Ashura force and Divine Energy with that move. The dark sword light cut through the folded space!

Whoosh!

Su Ping broke free from the constraint!

He teleported away without looking back.

“What?”

That confident smile on that crimson-eyed young man. He could not believe that a guy at the titled rank had been able to break free from his Space Folding. Not even the other Fate State beasts would have had such an easy time getting away!

“That sword is not a common one!”

The young man noticed the root cause at once. The sword was strange and its light was worrisome for him.

That was a move that could threaten the lives of those at the Fate State!

“No wonder he dares to let the other Void State human hide.” The young man narrowed his eyes; killing intent was visible in all of his four eyes. He decided to quit playing games, stepping into the void and vanishing right then.

If Space Folding wasn’t enough to keep Su Ping inside, he would go and kill Su Ping himself!

Boom!!

Su Ping reappeared on a certain spot. He had barely emerged when he lifted his sword!

Bang. A sharp claw reached out from a place in front of him, aimed at smashing his head. But he successfully deflected the blow with his sword.

The crimson-eyed young man came out; he frowned at his failure.

“Such acute perception. You’re a curious one among your kind.”

The young man squinted his eyes, no longer hiding his killing intent. Su Ping’s skills had frightened him. That person was merely at the titled rank... What would he become when he reached the legendary rank!

A hidden hazard had to be dealt with!

Su Ping had been able to get away, all thanks to the sword. He teleported again without saying anything.

Many sharp blades assaulted him when he emerged.

He cut them off with his sword.

Su Ping’s agile reactions frustrated the vicious young man.

“Freeze!”

He lifted his hand and space began to tremble. Su Ping felt as if someone had smashed his chest with a hammer. That blow would have killed him if it weren’t for his exceptionally strong body!

That was the true strength of a creature at the Fate State!

Such a creature could kill another creature at the Void State with a single blow!

“Go away!!” Su Ping bellowed. Dark flames were burning around the sword. He wielded the sword with all of his might.

The space was so thick that teleportation was not possible; the area gave out a harsh noise and the sword left a dark crack in space.

Turbulent air filled that crack. Su Ping stepped into it without hesitation.

“Hmm!”

The crimson-eyed young man pulled the crack to the sides.

The crack widened further and something pushed Su Ping outside.

The young man said, “World of Nothingness!”

Su Ping turned out to be a trickier problem than he had imagined. The spatial skills alone weren’t enough to stop Su Ping, which was a surprise. He was compelled to use his other skills.

The World of Nothingness was an inherent skill that he could use since he was born.

It was a spiritual strike that could affect other Fate State beasts. That was not a skill that could enable him to kill Fate State creatures!

The crimson-eyed youth was not good at close-quarter combat. He was more skilled with long-range spiritual strikes.

Silence!

The world had no sound!

Blood-red beams emerged from the young man’s eyes and lit up the world.

The red light enveloped everything, including Su Ping. The young man only had the chance to use the skill when others looked right into his eyes. But then, he no longer needed to wait.

Su Ping felt the world turn red in front of his eyes. The next second, he found himself falling into something soft, and that substance soon gave him a cold and slimy feeling

He looked around. He was in an ocean of blood!

The young man with crimson eyes appeared in the sky. He looked down at Su Ping who was soaking in the ocean of blood and gave his verdict, “Human creature, prepare to experience fear.”

He was annoyed, given that Su Ping had been able to escape several times.

It was like the times you were trying to kill a mosquito, and failed after several tries; you might have lost that urge after some time.

The tranquil ocean of blood began to tumble. Su Ping saw many evil creatures rising from the ocean of blood. Their appearances were ugly and vicious; some of them had organs growing outside of their bodies, which was quite gruesome. The smell of blood was so real that Su Ping thought that he would die in reality if he died in that ocean of blood!

The young man with crimson eyes said to Su Ping, “You don’t have to wonder. Your brain will die here and you will never go back to your normal life!”

Su Ping was surprised.

He was just thinking about that.

“I can sense every thought you have in my World of Nothingness. So, you have no chance to escape at all. This is something like a Field of Laws... Do you know what a Field of Laws is?” the vicious young man asked with contempt.

The Field of Laws was something that only those at the Star Rank would be able to construct.

That was a rank he aspired to reach!

Of course, it wasn’t fun talking about his great expectations with a human creature.

“Something like a Star Rank skill?”

Su Ping was frightened. That Thousand-eyed Demon Beast had to be a very powerful beast at the Fate State, much more so than the Otherworld Heavenly King.

“You know the Star Rank?” The young man was surprised to have learned that thought from Su Ping.

Su Ping said nothing and ignored the evil creatures that were crawling closer to him. Wisps of Ashura energy burst out of him, cutting the evil creatures into pieces.

“Is this the fear you talked about?” Su Ping gradually lifted himself from the ocean of blood and he calmly gazed at the young man with crimson eyes.

“Hmm.”

Su Ping was unwilling to give up. The crimson-eyed young man snorted. “This is just the warm-up!”

Su Ping heard some sad and shrill cries when the sound of his voice faded away. Twisted beasts crawled out from the ocean of blood; some of them were formed entirely of bodily organs and it was truly disgusting.

Su Ping looked at the beasts that were approaching him, but he didn’t seem to be disturbed.

“Since you can see my thoughts...

“Then see the true hell...” Su Ping said.

Hardly had his voice faded away when an area with darkness and shadows appeared behind him. His Force Field was opened, full of killing and slaughter. This time, the Force Field seemed to be able to extend all the way to infinity.

He was in a spiritual realm; the strength of the Force Field was related to the strength of his spirit.

An ancient and ugly world appeared in the Force Field.

The mountain had been formed with corpses and the water was blood. The demons and fiends roamed around in that world.

Roar!

A strange, yet indescribably free cry was heard. A gigantic figure emerged and came down from the sky. The figure was larger than anyone could imagine; its descent was disturbing the clouds. It was impossible to express the horror contained inside that figure. Anyone could be driven to madness because of fear!

However, something grabbed that gigantic figure and pushed back into the sky. The scream of pain echoed in the sky and on the ground. At the same time, a noise was heard, as if someone were chewing on bones. Blood rained down from the sky.

The clouds were tainted red and the ocean of blood was disturbed by drops of blood. There were some remains mixed in the blood rain.

The pupils of the young man were contracted upon witnessing that sight. The terror in his face was extreme.
