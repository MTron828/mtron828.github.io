Chapter 474 Exhibition

The other customers waiting in line heard the stunning conversation between Su Ping and Xu Yingxue. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Su Ping was going to sell pets at the peak of the ninth rank?

Weren’t pets at the peak of the ninth rank the most powerful pets below the beast king level? Who would sell such pets? Was he willing to do it?!

“Sir, do you mean it??

The young man standing behind Xu Yingxue stepped forward and asked the question immediately after Xu Yingxue walked away. He was so excited that he didn’t remember to mention that he was there for pet training.

“Yes.”

Su Ping nodded.

The young man could not believe it and neither could the people standing behind him. If it weren’t for the fact that the orders in Su Ping’s store had always been kept well and rarely would anyone make a noise, the customers would want to scream their lungs out.

What a shocking piece of news!

Su Ping was selling pets at the peak of the ninth rank. For most stores, not even their most prized treasure could reach that rank!

“Sir, can, can I buy it?” a refined middle-aged man in a smart dress asked, his voice trembling.

Su Ping darted a look at the man, sensing the profound astral powers in him. “Which rank are you at?”

“I am an, an advanced battle pet warrior.”

“Oh, no.” Su Ping shook his head. “Only master battle pet warriors and above can buy these pets or else the pets cannot be contained. I must ensure the safety of my customers.”

Battle pet warriors could build a contract with pets two ranks higher.

A seventh-rank battle pet warrior could sign a contract with pets of the ninth rank!

But that merely applied to the average ninth-rank pets, not those at the peak of the ninth rank.

A contract could be established if one forced it, but that would place the battle pet warrior in extreme danger, since the pet could get out of control at any time. By then, the first one to be attacked by a vicious beast running wild would be the master; the pet would even eat up the master as a snack.

The middle-aged man was wordless for a long time.

ne

He wanted to say ‘please just sell the pet to me and I would never hold you accountable for anything’! However, as the words reached the tip of his tongue, he became scared.

The pets were at the peak of the ninth rank!

The most powerful pet he had was of the eighth-rank. He didn’t have any pets at the ninth rank, not to mention the peak of the ninth rank, something that was second to beast kings!

The other customers felt disappointed. But at the same time, they were aware that such pets could only belong to the powerful. As for them, they could just be happy they could be there witnessing all this.

Most people present were at the fourth or fifth rank. Few were at the sixth-rank. After all, the number of advanced battle pet warriors were few, let alone master battle pet warriors!

There were less than one thousand master battle pet warriors in the entire Longjiang Base

City!

Half of those master battle pet warriors would be stationed in the strongholds outside the base city. As for the other half, they would be either busy making money every day or enjoying their retired lives in the base city.

They were willing to go to the store and take a look after they heard about their amazing training services. However, they were unwilling to stand in line waiting and squander away their time. As such, some master trainers that were interested in Su Ping’s store would hire people to stand in line on their behalf. Still, after this day’s new regulations, the ones who were lining up for the money left. As a result, the ones remaining were basically all low or middle-rank battle pet warriors. There were a few who were advanced battle pet warriors.

At the store.

Xu Yingxue called her captain. She blurted out as soon as he picked up, “Captain, where are you? Stop whatever it is you are doing. Get some money and come to the Pixie, right now!”

“Huh? What?” Xu Yingxue could hear some noises coming from the other side of the call.

Her captain sounded confused, “What is going on? Is someone bullying you? What Pixie?”

“The most popular Pixie Pet Store in the base city!”

Xu Yingxue could hear that her captain was hunting in the barren area and she could hear other team members that were talking to her captain. Feeling impatient, she shouted, “Pets at the peak of the ninth rank are on sale here at a low price. Hurry over, or you’ll lose the chance!”

“What? Pets at the peak of the ninth rank? On sale?”

The captain noticed the keywords. “Yingxue, you’re not kidding with me, are you?” He could not believe this.

Xu Yingxue was losing all her patience. “Do I look like someone that would joke around? I’m the first person to know and the news will get out soon. You won’t get anything if others come first. This is a rare chance!”

The captain realized that Xu Yingxue meant it. It was just that he had not recovered from the stunning news. Pets at the peak of the ninth rank on sale?

Who would do that?

“Wait for me. I’m going right now. Stall him... beep...” He hung up before he finished his sentence.

Someone was battling against some wild beasts in a place found in the barren area. “Captain, was that Sister Xu?” someone asked. “Yes. I need to get back to the base city, so I’ll leave the mission to you. I have to go now.” The middle-aged man who was the captain summoned a flying battle pet, hopped onto its back, and took flight at once, dashing into the distance.

The other team members had never seen their captain in such a hurry before.

“Did something happen to Sister Xu?”

The others were afraid. They were no longer in the mood to kill those wild beasts to get merit points. Someone who seemed to be the vice-captain shouted, “Let’s go. Hurry up!”

“Yes!”

They cleared the area of the wild beasts and left in haste.

At the store, Xu Yingxu was glad to have made the call but she was still worried. Their team would be empowered if her captain could get the pet that Su Ping said was at the peak of the ninth rank. They could have their way even in Class A barren areas!

She wasn’t sure if her captain could make it.

She turned to the counter, only to see that Su Ping was walking outside.

“What is going on?”

Xu Yingxue went after Su Ping.

Su Ping went to the door while surrounded by customers who were begging to see the pets he was planning on selling. He agreed, since he was going to sell the pets sooner or later.

There was a long line outside the store.

Those people in the line were surprised that Su Ping would exit the store.

Su Ping went to the location where he once left the Inferno Dragon on display. He pulled up the interface and summoned the two newly added battle pets.

Two swirls came out. At first look, one would think that Su Ping was calling out his own pets.

Roar!

Along with a low roar full of bloodthirsty intent, wild energy emerged from the swirl; then, the Fierce Fire Ape landed heavily; it was more than a dozen meters tall, as high as a two or three-story building. With red hair and skin, the Fierce Fire Ape seemed to have come out from blood itself.

Wild and barbaric!

A violent beast that had never been tamed was standing there.

The Abyss Spirit Feeder stepped out from the other swirl. The Abyss Spirit Feeder had a body that was like a cloud of dark and twisted mist, and also a raging wildfire floating in the air, but there was a faint sight of flesh and blood inside. What looked like a layer of skin was in fact a mass of slippery and soft tissues, giving people an unusually uncomfortable feeling.

It was complete darkness around the Abyss Spirit Feeder. There wasn’t even the slightest trace of a shadow.

The two pets at the peak of the ninth-rank stunned the customers who had followed Su Ping outside, including those who were still standing outside the store and unaware of their previous conversation.

As she came out after Su Ping, Xu Yingxue was taken aback by the two pets.
