Chapter 1134 The King

There was a hazy and chaotic space inside the root.

However, there was abundant life energy and the aura of assorted laws.

Hardly had Su Ping entered that place when he realized he would soon be able to perfect his path of vitality if he were to cultivate there. He would become truly invulnerable by then, just like Lin Xiu.

No, he would be even more unbelievable than Lin Xiu!

After all, he had triple small worlds. Even Ascendants would find it hard to kill him with a tripled perfect path of vitality, unless they were Heavenly Lords! But he couldn’t stay in that place for long; Su Ping was quite regretful because of it. The woman glanced at Su Ping and asked, “Brat, are they the twelve Deity Kings you mentioned?”

The old man smiled. “It seems that you weren’t lying.” It seemed that he hadn’t believed what Su Ping had told them until that very moment. Su Ping complained in his heart, but didn’t show any dissatisfaction on his face. He nodded and said, “Yes, they are the ones. Can we go ahead and leave the ruins right now?”

“Of course. My old friend would never lie to us,” said the old man and nodded.

The cauldron woman snorted, but stayed silent.

They soon followed the old man’s lead, and they walked inside the intangible space inside the root, until they reached a place.

The old man stopped and groped in the darkness. He gave a slight nod as he seemed to have detected something. “This is the place. old friend, thank you for bringing us here.”

There was a slight surge in the darkness, as if replying to what he said.

The evil book extended his hand into the darkness, as if he was examining something. His expression changed moments later. “There’s the aura of Deity Kings outside!”

“Huh?”

The cauldron woman too changed her expression a bit and moved forward. Still, she didn’t approach the old man; she simply moved to another side. Her face was solemn. “Have we been exposed? Highly unlikely. The ancient tree’s root reaches the deepest parts of the void. Not even Deity Kings can detect it. They would have snuck in already had they detected it…”

“Maybe they’re just on guard…” said the old man with glittering eyes.

“There are Deity Kings outside?”

Su Ping was slightly dazed, then delighted after hearing what they said. The two people were more dangerous than Celestial State experts, who had to take his master into consideration… 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Su Ping suddenly frowned as he thought of this; his delight faded away like an ebbing tide.

Those Celestials knew he had the key to enter the third test first. If they detected him when he got out, would they think he had already found the legacy?

If that were the case, they could decide to kill him before he could grow strong enough.

In particular, if he met the Celestials who were hostile to his master, they would surely take action!

If he died, he would be another dead genius, which was worthless. Even if his master wanted to avenge him, the man would only be fighting for his Celestial expert dignity…

Su Ping’s face soured as he thought about it.

“What’s the matter?” asked the old man with a frown, as he keenly noticed Su Ping’s expressions.

Seeing that the cauldron woman was also looking at him, Su Ping knew it was pointless to keep it a secret; they might even suspect him if he did. So, he simply confessed.

Both of them fell silent afterwards.

“Are the twelve Deity Kings cooperating? No wonder we saw one here. They’ve probably surrounded the place…” mumbled the old man.

The cauldron woman frowned. “So in other words, it’s impossible for us to go out?”

“There’s only one way, which is to find my master,” said Su Ping, “If I can locate him, I’ll be able to show up right in front of him. Nobody else would dare make a move while I’m under his protection.”

The old man gave a slight nod. “That’s a good idea. Has your master given you anything? The Heaven Square Mirror can find him with any item that carries his aura.”

“Yes.”

Su Ping instantly took out the ultimate shield treasure. He didn’t expect it would be useful there; he gave it to the old man.

“Huh? The laws on this artifact are restricted. It’s an incomplete ultimate treasure, but I think it was broken on purpose…” The old man was slightly surprised to see the ultimate treasure.

The woman glanced at it too, and sneered. “Whoever crafted this ultimate treasure is quite skilled. They’re almost a king-level refiner, from what I gather.” Su Ping was slightly intrigued; the saints on the original planet were indeed not simple.

The old man then took out the Heaven Square Mirror; he threw the ultimate treasure into the mirror, which swallowed the artifact like water. Then, the mirror became flat again, with ripples spreading out. The hazy depiction inside it became clear, displaying two majestic men.

They were surrounded by the boundless darkness of the universe. In front of them was a splendid residence floating in space, but it was slightly old and ragged.

“They’re both at the gate of the residence.” The old man glanced at the picture and asked Su Ping, “Which of them is your master?”

“The one on the left, in the golden robe.” Su Ping was slightly relieved to see Shen Huang in the picture. The other Celestial next to his master appeared to be a handsome young man in white. He looked quite charming too.

One of them looked like an unparalleled emperor, and the other was like a handsome gentleman.

“Huh?”

Exactly at this moment-Shen Huang and the other Celestial suddenly stopped talking as if they detected something. Then, they both looked in the general direction where Su Ping and the others were on the other side of the mirror.

The old man slightly changed his expression. “They detected us? How sensitive; looks like Deity Kings these days aren’t simple!”

The cauldron woman narrowed her eyes and said, “So, we may have to return to where we came and leave through the main gate. Still, the old monster left dangerous traps there; I wonder if they have disabled the traps.”

“Probably not.”

The old man shook his head. “They wouldn’t dare enter the residence easily, and they’re just observing from the outside; they probably don’t want to take risks. All the Deity Kings are absolute dominators on their territories; they will never work with each other sincerely! “When a group of smart people gather, they’re no better than a swarm of stupid pigs. That’s just a bunch of human beings; they’re bound to be selfish no matter how high their level is!” “Then what do we do?” The woman frowned.

The old man put away the Heaven Square Mirror. The two Deity Kings had already detected it; something could go wrong if they kept observing. After a moment of silence, the old man said, “I know a shortcut that can bypass the traps and lead out of the residence.”

The woman couldn’t help but gaze at him suspiciously, before she finally sneered and said, “You’re truly shrewd. Even the old monster didn’t know that, right?” “He was too weak to see through me completely,” replied the old man with a casual tone.

The woman sneered in response, knowing he was telling the truth. The sutra was at the emperor level; the old monster was incapable of comprehending it completely. “The problem right now is how to escape when we get out. According to what he said, they will think that you have won the legacy. However, you’re too weak at the moment; how can you guarantee that your master won’t enslave you and then claim the legacy in your body?” The old man stared at Su Ping and said, “Even parents might sell their children for petty interests, let alone something like a Deity King’s legacy.”

Su Ping was stunned for a moment; he stared at him solemnly and said, “Senior, I cannot give you any assurance; that’s just my instinctive decision. Besides, I’d gladly go for a different option if we had one.”

The old man looked him in the eye and gave him a slight nod. “Indeed. We don’t have any other choice right now. However, I have a method to make sure he won’t act greedy before you.”

“What’s the method?” Su Ping was stunned.

“It will turn you into a Deity King for a brief period!” said the old man.

Su Ping was shocked. “Really? Does it have any side effects?”

The old man was surprised to hear such a reply; most people would have been thrilled to hear such news, but Su Ping was exceptionally calm. He suddenly realized why the young man could cultivate dual small worlds; he was indeed one of the best in terms of potential and personality.

“There are indeed side effects, but you won’t be badly affected. To be more precise, it’ll give you the aura of a Deity King for now, but you wouldn’t be a real Deity King.”

The old man continued, “The side effect is that your level will plummet and you’ll turn into an ordinary person. However, your potential won’t be hurt; it’ll take no more than ten years for you to cultivate back to your current level. All that matters is whether or not you’re up for it.”

Su Ping was stunned. Do I have to re-cultivate? “What about my dual small worlds?”

“The laws and paths you’ve grasped won’t disappear. Even if you become an ordinary person, the power will still reside in your body; you can even be called the strongest mortal alive,” said the old man.

Su Ping was rather suspicious, but he didn’t show any of it. He simply asked, “Are there other ways?”
