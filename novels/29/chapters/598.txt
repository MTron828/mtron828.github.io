Chapter 600 Pursuit

“Hush!”

Li Yuanfeng and Su Ping were on their way back. All of a sudden, Li Yuanfeng signaled Su Ping to keep quiet. Su Ping understood the signal right away. He held his breath and submerged into the wall with Li Yuanfeng.

Boom_!

A beast full of power and grandeur had crawled over from a fork in the road, leaving behind a foul smelling scent; Su Ping felt he was getting dizzy.

He quickly held his breath again and used astral powers to force the toxins out of his body.

The beasts wobbled away. Li Yuanfeng and Su Ping waited for a while before they resumed their journey.

“I think those beasts are getting more active,” Li Yuanfeng pointed that out with a grave look on his face.

Most of the beasts had been asleep when they first got into the Corridor. But by also counting the beast they had just met, they had encountered over a dozen beasts on the move as they made their way back.

They found four of the beasts which had been asleep when they got there in the beginning; they currently were also moving about.

When it came to beasts, their time would be spent either on finding food or resting, mostly the latter.

That was it.

But the beasts could remain full for half a month or even longer after each time they hunted; it was strange that all the beasts would come out to find food all of a sudden.

“I think we must leave as soon as possible,” Su Ping said.

He also felt something was off. He could not say what, but it felt as if something were watching them.

The beasts that were roaming about seemed more violent than before. He felt uneasy.

“Sure.”

Li Yuanfeng nodded.

They pressed along, following the marks they had left on their way in. The Corridor had a complicated structure, like a massive spider web where anyone could get lost. However, they were able to find their way back thanks to the marks left by the Dark Dragon Hound.

“Wait a moment.”

Li Yuanfeng made a sudden stop.

He pressed his ear on the wall. Something seemed to have frightened him a few seconds later, because he began to shout, “Run!”

Su Ping was confused. But Li Yuanfeng had begun to teleport, not even bothering to maintain his disguise. Su Ping quickly realized that it had to be some grave danger and immediately followed.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The two of them quickly teleported from one spot to another in the Corridor.

Sometime later, a dark swirl suddenly appeared in the air right in front of them.

Wings reached out from that swirl and following the wings was a gigantic beast which resembled a lion. The beast had four black wings and its height reached over a dozen meters, while its length was at about thirty meters. The beast carried an overwhelming energy.

“I see the two tiny things now.”

The beast with four wings looked down at Su Ping and Li Yuanfeng from a height, flashing a terrifying grin.

The beast’s upper body didn’t resemble a lion, but a human being. It had four arms and each held different weapons, including a rod, an ax, a sword, and a piece of iron chain.

“It’s a Void State beast!”

Li Yuanfeng was scared. His instinct told him that it wasn’t an average Void State beast king. He was even getting goosebumps; he wouldn’t have felt that way when he was fought regular beast kings of that rank. After all, he had been fighting in the Deep Caves for eight hundred years; he had killed a lot of them.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He was also able to notice this before Li Yuanfeng cautioned him.

He was familiar with beast kings of all states because he had met many.

“Let’s get this over with!” Su Ping whispered to Li Yuanfeng.

A swirl opened up and the Little Skeleton came out.

Li Yuanfeng nodded. He opened up swirls of his own to let out his beast king battle pets as well.

He had opened up 12 swirls in an instant.

The 12 beast kings stood on the path. That was the most powerful ensemble he had.

Whoosh!

A dragon covered with sharp spikes bellowed. Just like a ray of light, the dragon vanished as it went into Li Yuanfeng. He merged with his dragon.

The old warrior grew in strength instantly; he had gone far beyond the Void State immediately!

The other battle pets didn’t stay idle while he went through the merging. They started to unleash their skills. Colorful wisps of energy were poured into Li Yuanfeng. He became a warrior wearing elegant armor the moment he finished with the merging. He looked like a god who had descended from heaven!

“Go to hell!”

Li Yuanfeng snarled. He absorbed the energy that his battle pets shared with him and instantly reached the four-winged beast. Li Yuanfeng extended his arm, which had turned into a dragon’s limb.

Space was twisted. A black claw mark appeared in the air. Space was wrapped into a cube from which many iron chains were shot out, tying up the flying beast.

Bang!

Li Yuanfeng slapped the winged beast. There was a bang and the vicious beast slipped backward for hundreds of meters. Li Yuanfeng then heard that the iron chains were breaking before he could strike again. The four-winged beast uttered a long cry into the air.

The beast’s violent energy was soon spread all across the Corridor.

The beast was covered in dust but the red glow from its eyes was still visible.

“You puny Void State insect. This is not a place for you to prance about!”

The flying beast stepped forward as it roared again. A dark blast wave came out from the beast’s mouth; it had hit Li Yuanfeng across the distance the moment it appeared.

Li Yuanfeng’s many armors and shields broke. He quickly used his arms to protect his head but the impact still smashed him away.

Su Ping rushed over and stopped Li Yuanfeng from touching the ground... But the impact of the fall still stunned him.

Whoosh!

Su Ping helped Li Yuanfeng recover his footing “That thing is scary!”

Li Yuanfeng looked pale. He wasn’t able to win with a single blow, even while using his utmost strength. The four-winged beast was simply terrifying!

“Let’s flank it!” Su Ping proposed.

He gradually showed his true strength. White bones were appearing from under his skin, covering him up like a piece of armor. Even his face and lips were covered with white bones; it seemed as if his teeth were growing outside.

Li Yuanfeng narrowed his eyes. “What is this?”

“A special skill,” Su Ping mentioned casually before he teleported to the beast.

Apart from borrowing the Little Skeleton’s strength, Su Ping was also able to unleash some of the Little Skeleton’s skills.

Of course, save for the legendary rank skills.

Bang!

Su Ping was then merely dozens of meters away from the winged beast. The space around the beast had become more solid; there were blades in that space which could cut Su Ping into pieces the moment he stepped into that area. He directly decided to use a spiritual skill, a rare one that the Little Skeleton had mastered.

Nightmare Space!

The spiritual strike could bypass any limitations in space.

The four-winged beast was startled. The next second, the spiritual manifestation of the beast appeared in the Nightmare Space that Su Ping had summoned.

Go to hell!

Su Ping slapped at the beast with tremendous force.

“Roar!!”

The winged beast had finally seen its surroundings; the towering Su Ping scared and enraged the beast. It was immediately able to tell that it was the spiritual realm. The beast felt humiliated by the fact that a human being was trying to crush it with spiritual strikes. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The beast roared and demonstrated its strong killing intent, gradually growing in size to become as large as Su Ping, then pounced at him.

Su Ping punched at the beast but the latter was even more vicious, ignoring the punch and pinning Su Ping on the ground, then attempted to tear him apart with its teeth.

That was Su Ping’s spiritual manifestation and the strike was aimed at his spirit. The killing intent was ebbing away from Su Ping’s face. The next second, a dark Force Field opened up from behind him. An incomparable low roar from the ancient times melodiously emerged from inside.

It seemed to be coming from the end of the sky.

The four-winged beast trembled as if having suffered a heavy blow; it gazed into the Force Field and saw the outline of a terrifying creature.

The beast was scared.

The beast cried all of a sudden; it turned into a puff of mist and vanished.

Su Ping went back to reality again.

He saw a deep wound in the beast’s chest. That pain had pulled the beast out from the Nightmare Space. Li Yuanfeng was about to land another blow but the beast pushed Li Yuanfeng away; the shockwaves in the air forced him to step back.

Boom_!

The earth trembled and the mountains swayed. Vines grew out from the walls around them, entangling the beast’s body and wings.

That was the doing of one of Li Yuanfeng’s beast kings.

The next second, dark flames burst out from the winged beast, which burned off the green-glowing vines.

Roar!

The beast turned around, glaring at Su Ping with fear and rage.
