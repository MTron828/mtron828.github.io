Chapter 1128 Alarmed

Su Ping entered the depths of the ancient palace while led by Golden Lotus. Hardly had Su Ping arrived when he saw the bully mentioned by the fat kid.

It was an ancient purple cauldron, with black and white steam popping up; it had engravings of many vivid and strange ferocious beasts. The essence of those beasts had been absorbed by the ancient cauldron.

The artifact was currently still, surrounded by abundant laws that looked like smoke, giving it a splendid look. “That’s the Evolution Cauldron!”

Golden Lotus said with solemn eyes, “The channel is right beneath it. She seems to be sound asleep right now; let’s just be extra careful.”

Su Ping saw that there was indeed an unusual array below the cauldron; it was probably the teleportation array mentioned by Golden Lotus.

However, Su Ping thought it was just a normal cauldron after observing for a good while.

How can we know it’s sound asleep? Su Ping wore a strange expression, but he didn’t ask. He noticed a transparent barrier ten meters away from the cauldron; it glittered whenever a breeze passed.

That’s right; the barrier even blocked the passage of air.

“That’s the barrier imprisoning the cauldron. It cannot be breached from the inside, but it’s not that hard to pass to anyone outside. I know the trick; be careful,” said Golden Lotus with a grave expression.

She then cast a spell, releasing the aura of laws and a power that Su Ping couldn’t recognize. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A strange rune flew out soon after, which was then imprinted on the barrier.

The center of the rune made the barrier twist a bit, and an opening was made.

“Let’s go.”

Golden Lotus spoke telepathically. She then floated through the opening without making a sound, just like a stream of smoke.

Su Ping frowned. He quickly reduced his body size, and also flew past the barrier.

Hardly had he passed the barrier when Su Ping noticed the most daunting aura looming in front of him. He slightly changed his expression, not daring to lay eyes on the cauldron due to fear of being noticed.

He realized that the fat pill boy wasn’t bluffing. The cauldron was indeed a Deity King weapon!

Its aura undoubtedly contained Celestial State power!

Su Ping held his breath, and slowly approached the cauldron behind Golden Lotus.

The closer to the cauldron, the greater the pressure was. Fortunately, Su Ping had seen plenty of experts in cultivation sites; he wasn’t overpowered by the ominous atmosphere, and simply carried on.

One step after the other.

Su Ping felt he was moving towards his doom.

The path they took was so frightening that anyone else would have been terrified. However, he rationally controlled his body and kept it relaxed, without releasing any of his aura

Gradually

He approached the Evolution Cauldron.

It was quite the magnificent artifact, with a massive ten-meter body. Su Ping also saw the three curses restraining the cauldron like three black, wicked dragons.

The teleportation array was at the feet of the cauldron.

Golden Lotus moved like a fish as she reached the bottom of the cauldron.

She turned around and waved at Su Ping, asking him to relax.

He wasn’t feeling impatient. He sustained the same speed in the last few meters as he walked forward, withholding his aura completely until the both of them were standing underneath the cauldron.

Su Ping looked as solemn as before; he had yet to relax completely.

Golden Lotus was slightly astonished by Su Ping’s calm demeanor; she then glanced at him with approval in her eyes. She was slightly angry with him because of his greed, but she had to admit that his mind was stronger than expected; anyone else would have been exposed already.

After all, Su Ping’s level was too low; it was indeed remarkable that he hadn’t been paralyzed before a Deity King weapon.

Furthermore, the Evolution Cauldron had consumed plenty of ultimate treasures and refined the corpses of many tough beasts; it was even more intimidating than a Deity King!

Golden Lotus moved her hands, releasing threads of aura from her fingers; she was going to activate the array.

Exactly at that moment-a gentle voice was suddenly heard. “Do you need my help?”

Golden Lotus abruptly stopped moving her hands. She seemed overcome with shock; she moved much faster the next moment, hoping to activate the array as soon as possible. But then a force struck her and Su Ping, hurling both against the barrier. Su Ping felt that his bones were falling apart; he would have been reduced into a bloody pulp were it not for his tough body.

Also, the laws all over his body had been blocked. He would have truly died if he were truly squished into a pulp.

Su Ping was shocked. It happened too fast; no more than 0.001 seconds had passed since the voice sounded.

The gentle voice gradually turned cold and scary. “My lovely pills, are you trying to flee again?”

Su Ping raised his head, only to find that the magnificent cauldron gradually transformed into an enormous woman.

The lady was six meters tall, but she was quite slim, endowed with fair skin and a pretty face. The coldness on her face made her look even more charming.

Golden Lotus had already gotten back to her feet nearby. She asked with an awful expression, “When did you discover us?”

“The moment you came in…” The woman looked down at her, without even bothering to look in Su Ping’s direction. She said to Golden Lotus, “I asked you to give up last time, but here you are yet again; I would have swallowed you if you weren’t the pill he needs!”

Golden Lotus’ face showed a contorted expression; she took a deep breath and then moved to stand in front of Su Ping. She also said to Su Ping telepathically, “I’ll try to buy some time for you. See if you can get away.” Meanwhile, she spoke to the cauldron, “Are you still willing to serve him? You have the potential to evolve and become an emperor weapon, and yet you were restrained by him. You, of all people, should know what kind of person he is; it won’t be possible for you to escape when he returns!”

“Of course I know that.”

The woman said indifferently, “That’s why I’m not letting any of you go. You must taste the pain and loneliness along with me!”

“Lunatic!” Golden Lotus couldn’t help but curse.

“If the pain is inevitable, I’d rather share it with someone else. Don’t even think about getting away!” said the sneering cauldron. “I gave you a choice before, to take you out of here If you allowed me to plant a curse inside your body, but you didn’t accept. If you want to die with me, then let’s die together!”

“I will never let you plant a curse inside my body and control me!” yelled Golden Lotus.

“Why don’t we just stay if you don’t want to negotiate? Even if we stay here, I will still serve him. He wouldn’t dare let me advance, but he’ll cherish me. You’re different, though; he will eat you. Let’s see which of us gets to live longer!” said the woman with a sneer.

Golden Lotus replied furiously, “I won’t let him eat me! Even if I can’t leave this place, I’d rather destroy myself than let him eat me!”

“In that case, why don’t you just accept my offer?” replied the woman with a snort. “You pills are truly stubborn and inflexible!”

Golden Lotus said furiously, “How many creatures have you killed? You would retaliate against everybody who crossed you before if you leave, including us. I cannot let you leave this place; only he can restrain you!”

“You’re asking to be killed!” Coldness was glinting in the woman’s eyes, as if about to attack.

“Wait a moment, let’s just talk nicely,” said the nearby Su Ping, “Maybe I can help you escape!”

He sensed that he had already been surrounded by a killing aura, knowing he would probably kick the bucket if he remained silent.

Also, the previous conversation had helped him in gleaning something: the woman was intent on cooperating with Golden Lotus and leaving that place. The pill had mentioned that the cauldron was scared of a sutra found in the study, and the sutra was one of Golden Lotus’ friends. The cauldron probably intended to coerce the sutra into letting her go by planting a curse inside Golden Lotus.

The woman stopped her attack upon hearing Su Ping’s proposal.

She would have crushed the weak human had she not heard what he said last; she wasn’t interested in anything else he might have said.

Golden Lotus changed her expression and looked at Su Ping. She asked, “What do you want?”

“Since the both of you have a mutual enemy and target, I think it would be a win-win if you cooperate and leave this place together,” proposed Su Ping straight off.

The woman raised her eyebrows and sneered. “Listen, even this brat understands simple logic, while you don’t. I know you’re an effective pill, but I truly worry for my brain’s health if I tried swallowing you!”

Su Ping: “…”

Golden Lotus was quite grim. She had planned to help Su Ping escape, but she didn’t think highly of him anymore, given how greedy he was, and hearing his offer.

“There’s no way that I’ll cooperate with her.” Golden Lotus stared at Su Ping. “I know you want to live, but you’ve chosen the wrong method; you know too little about her. The old monster ended the lives of many in the most brutal way, to later feed them to her. The world would fall into chaos if she leaves!”

Su Ping was lost for words. He didn’t know that Miss Pan was actually a pill with a great sense of justice; no wonder she swore not to cooperate with the cauldron. “Miss Pan, we’ve living in a different age. Even if she does go out, she won’t be able to cause trouble. Also, if the information about her is exposed, I’m sure that many Deity Kings will show up and fight for her. Those unable to get her would aim to destroy her. Such cooperation will work in our favor,” said Su Ping telepathically.

Golden Lotus was dazed for a moment, but her expression didn’t show an improvement. She asked, “What do you mean?”

“Miss Pan, aren’t you able to tell if I’m lying? I assure you that she won’t cause a disaster to the world if she gets out; this age is no longer the one you’re familiar with. She will be wanted by the entire world if she causes any trouble. All the Deity Kings would join forces to eliminate her. She won’t have a chance to do anything evil!” said Su Ping in a fast telepathic message.
