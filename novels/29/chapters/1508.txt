Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Bang!

Yan Tai was answered by Su Ping’s blade. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The other prisoners fell silent when they saw the battle; Su Ping’s ruthlessness was an eye-opener for them. It was a first for them to see that the Primitive Chaos Clan—which was known for their gentleness—had such a brutal member.

“He’s even crazier than the Crazy Original Dragon!” mumbled the guy from the Haotian Clan.

“Yan Tai is truly unlucky. Even if she kills him, she’ll be badly wounded, too. Maybe… I’ll have a chance to taste her someday,” one of the Undying State prisoners remarked.

The battle lasted a long time, until Su Ping was finally exhausted.

“Rot in hell!!”

Once she noticed that Su Ping couldn’t hold on for much longer, Yan Tai went on a rampage and ripped his body to pieces, splashing his blood in the void.

She didn’t give him a chance to beg for mercy, as she simply vented her fury.

“It’s over…”

The other prisoners were surprised to see Su Ping’s vitality aura disappeared. They had thought that he had some trump cards, considering how fiercely he was fighting, but there were none.

“Have we been caged for too long that the world outside has changed? Even the Primitive Chaos Clan has gone crazy.”

“Huh?”

Before the prisoners finished discussing, the extinct aura reappeared.

All the blood disappeared, and Su Ping’s figure was condensed once more.

“Come again!”

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. He detonated his chaos universe and fought desperately, just like before.

Yan Tai narrowed her eyes and lost her cool. “This is impossible!”

She was absolutely certain Su Ping had died. There was no way for him to resurrect, yet there he was.

The higher one’s level, the more truths would be revealed, and the more stable their world views would be. So, shock and fear would hit them harder when something blew their minds.

The other prisoners were also dumbfounded, looking at the battle in disbelief. Everything felt like an illusion, but they believed in their senses. Death while in the Undying State was irreversible; not even Sorcerer Ancestors could do anything about it.?And yet, the guy resurrected?

Could it be that everything was an illusion and we were all tricked?

When ruling out all the impossible, what remained—however unbelievable—was a fact.

They could only conclude that they had been tricked by Su Ping with some sort of ability, and that he never truly died.

While the prisoners were still coping with the shock, Su Ping was back at it again, battling against Yan Tai.

Bang!

Bang!

Time flew.

There was no concept of time inside the Dragon Prison. However, Su Ping knew that two weeks had passed, based on the time flow in his inner universe.

During that time he had used up three lives, finally killing Yan Tai of the Heixiang Clan in the end!

Yes, he killed her!

If not for her being locked in space and the prison’s weakening effect, it would have taken me ten lives to achieve this… Is every top expert from the Sorcerer Ancestors’ clans like this?”

Su Ping held Yan Tai’s body and swallowed it. All his pores opened up to absorb Yan Tai’s Great Dao and improve his condition.

The second undying universe he was planning to condense was the universe of illusion.

That was also the second small world he had established.

The perfected Dao of Illusion began to grow in the depths of his original univers at a fast pace, once a considerable amount of Great Dao fragments were absorbed. Such a development was much faster than when the Dao of Fire was formed.

The Great Dao in Yan Tai’s body fell apart into countless pieces, and Su Ping absorbed them all.

The Dragon Prison was absolutely quiet; only the sound of Su Ping assimilating Yan Tai’s body could be heard.

If it were possible to see them, the prisoner’s faces would show ashen expressions.

They saw how Yan Tai had begged for mercy and perished, and they knew that they could share the same fate.

At the moment they weren’t in the mood to figure out why Su Ping could resurrect indefinitely. Instead, they cursed the Original Dragons for not restraining the guy from the Primitive Chaos Clan!

They would basically be screwed if that monster was allowed to roam free!

The formerly loud Haotian fellow was also silent.

It was in that quiet environment that Su Ping assimilated Yan Tai’s flesh, absorbing her essence and Great Dao. His aura became increasingly powerful, deep like an abyss. He skimmed through Yan Tai’s memories and realized why those people were so brutal.

So, the easiest way to improve was to feed on beings in the same cultivation realm!

He resumed his cultivation after he was done eating.

Two weeks later, the undying universe of illusion took shape.

Two months later, the new undying universe of illusion was completely condensed.

Fortunately, the fire universe created an opening which allowed me to transfer the pieces of Great Dao to the Illusion Dao. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to condense another universe.

Once the undying universe became active, it began to radiate a power that joined forces with the fire universe to counter the universe of original chaos.

The previous opening was instantly widened, as if there was an arm.

However, the combined effort of those universes was still not enough to overthrow the pressure from the universe of original chaos. He couldn’t even invoke the power of his three universes at the same time.

As expected of the power from one of the Sorcerer Ancestors’ bloodlines. Looks like a balance can only be reached until I master at least two more universes…?Su Ping took a deep breath and finished Yan Clan’s remaining flesh. His body was then improved, while also inheriting some of the Heixiang Clan’s morphing abilities.

The Heixiang Clan excelled in shapeshifting, just like Golden Crows were good with flames. That strange power could be very useful in battle. Su Ping had experienced the shapeshifting effect firsthand when facing Yan Tai, as she killed him using a different form each time. Those transformations had been truly complex.

The morphing power was also useful for concealment. The Heixiang Clan had the best lurking abilities among all the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors’ clans. That was why Yan Tai was able to ambush many other Undying State mythical creatures.

Su Ping stood up and looked at the other prisoners.

Without saying a word, he approached the fellow from the Haotian Clan.

“You, nutcase, what are you doing?” said the guy quickly. After seeing how serious Su Ping had acted while eating Yan Tai, he was a little bit scared.

Most importantly, half his combat ability was being restrained by the Dragon Prison, which would leave him at a huge disadvantage. He would be worn out to death.

“I’ll be bailing you out from the Dragon Prison.” Su Ping strode towards him. “Through my stomach.”

“No. I don’t want to leave. Don’t come any closer!” cried the guy from the Haotian Clan.

The other prisoners’ eyelids twitched as they witnessed the situation; it would probably be their turn once he was done with the fellow.

Once he saw that Su Ping wasn’t planning on stopping, the Haotian guy roared furiously, “Original Dragons, are you blind? Can’t you see what’s going on here?” Sounds of tremors were heard coming from the ceiling, as if in response to what he said.

Su Ping stopped and craned his head, only to detect a few extremely familiar auras. The void inside the prison floor was split open and a few figures dashed out. They were none other than the Inferno Dragon and his other pets.

Su Ping was dazed.

The Haotian fellow was also taken aback. He said in shock, “Damn, why were Dao Heart guys thrown here?”

The other prisoners were just as stunned as they looked at the junior newcomers.?Are these creatures snacks??They had been caged for a long time, and the Original Dragons’ ancestor had never provided such a service.

“You…”

Su Ping didn’t expect the Inferno Dragon and the others to show up.

Roar!!

A furious call instantly echoed throughout the entire prison floor.

The Inferno Dragon was ablaze with scorching black flames. A vague shadow appeared on its back, which was its burning soul. The beast instantly saw his master and flew over with hot tears flowing. “We found you!”

They rushed to meet him. They seemed to be only a few thousand meters apart, but they were located in different spaces. However, the pets broke through and soon arrived where Su Ping was.
