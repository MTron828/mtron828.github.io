Chapter 1111 All Must Die

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

The scorching spear stabbed Su Ping with precision, but it was blocked by the shield and couldn’t pierce it.

The furious power was dispersed. Qing Hongyue widened her eyes in disbelief.

Besides her, everybody around her was similarly dumbfounded.

Three!

The Star State kid had three ultimate treasures!

Su Ping slashed with his axe after Qing Hongyue’s attack collapsed.

A boom resounded; Qing Hongyue was smashed to the ground by Su Ping. Her blue shield rippled, and the Ascendant State power it had was greatly weakened. It had already been damaged by her red feather when she

acquired it.

Her shield was then further damaged because of the battle axe’s destructive power.

Whoosh!

Su Ping charged forward and chased after his target.

But exactly at that moment—he suddenly started moving in the exact same spot, even backwards.

Su Ping turned around, then saw that Claudia was influencing him with the path of time.

Boom! Su Ping waved his battle axe; its edge completely destroyed the laws around it. Claudia’s face was contorted and pale; it was truly difficult to resist the terrifying ultimate treasure with just laws.

How could such an ultimate treasure fall into Su Ping’s hands?

Or rather, how could the previous owner be slain by someone in the Star State?

She didn’t know why, and she was too shocked to think at that moment.

Su Ping didn’t even turn around as he broke free from the time law restriction. He continued his charge toward Qing Hongyue.

She rose from the ground; her clothes were ragged, but she wasn’t badly injured. She raised her head upon hearing a wind rush, only to narrow her eyes. She flapped her phoenix wings, dashing quickly like a streak of

red light to avoid Su Ping’s strike.

He aggressively unfolded his Golden Crow wings and activated his constitution, to then give chase at full speed using Void Walker.

“Don’t run!” Su Ping roared.

Qing Hongyue felt utterly frustrated. You think I’ll listen to you?

Not only am I going to run, I’m also going to run faster!

While running, Qing Hongyue shouted furiously, “Calivey, you’re just going to watch him grow stronger? He has three ultimate treasures for offense and defense. Add in the golden flag, and he’s already invincible.

You’re cooperating with him in such conditions? Think again!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She tried to talk sense into them, knowing that she and Claudia could hardly kill Su Ping, not to mention that Calivey and Brian were watching.

“You think he wouldn’t finish you off the moment I give him my ultimate treasures!” Qing Hongyue demanded furiously.

Calivey and Brian looked at each other, with twitching lips.

Naturally, they knew Su Ping was virtually invincible at the moment.

Besides, the latter had yet to use his real strength…

His ultimate treasures had already made him invincible; they covered offense and defense, and were enough to crush all his opponents!

Likewise, Claudia made an effort to persuade them too, no longer in a hurry to attack. “Are you two really going to continue working with him?”

Qing Hongyue charged at Calivey and roared, “Do you not realize what a great combination of ultimate treasures he has? You think I’m pretending to be weak? Goddamn it…”

An urge to curse was about to overcome her.

She had truly been suppressed!

Her opinion of those two powerhouses was indeed low, thinking they were truly stupid to cooperate with a monster like Su Ping, and that they would get killed sooner or later.

Calivey and Brian were both lost for words upon seeing Qing Hongyue’s suffused visage due to fury.

Su Ping’s combination of ultimate treasures was certainly great, because those ultimate treasures used to be theirs…

Why didn’t they resist?

They certainly wanted to…

“Stop talking; I suggest you give up right now. Cultivation isn’t easy, just think about staying alive for now!” said Calivey.

Qing Hongyue almost vomited blood. What idiots! She couldn’t have explained the situation any clearer. Those two are still determined to help Su Ping? Are they related to Su Ping by blood? Even if they were his

ancestors, they didn’t have to be as caring.

All of a sudden, an idea occurred to Qing Hongyue.

Her face was instantly stiffened. She observed carefully, finding that Calivey and Brian’s expressions were indeed unusual; they seemed rather helpless.

Her speculation was confirmed; she realized what had happened.

“Damn it, you pieces of trash!”

Qing Hongyue was still infuriated after realizing what had happened. Those two had lost their ultimate treasures to Su Ping, a mere Star State warrior? Who lost first?

She couldn’t have felt more furious.

Exactly at that moment—a terrifying force surged towards her.

Qing Hongyue turned around and narrowed her eyes as the battle axe rushed to strike her again.

After a boom, she was flung backwards again.

The water shield covering her rippled intensely, and lost more than half of its power.

Su Ping held the battle axe and charged again; he hacked with the axe before Qing Hongyue rose from the ground.

She was rather panicked; she lost a lot of her energy every time the water shield was damaged. It became evident that her ultimate treasure wouldn’t hold much longer after Su Ping attacked a few times.

She felt goosebumps all over her body right when she thought of fleeing.

After a boom, the water shield suddenly gave out and exploded.

Qing Hongyue felt nigh stark naked in a snowy world after being deprived of her water shield. She was paralized by fear.

Su Ping was holding a crimson dagger in his other hand.

“What the…”

Qing Hongyue felt she was about to collapse once she noticed the crimson ultimate treasure.

“You think those were my only ultimate treasures?” Su Ping asked again.

Qing Hongyue felt like crying.

He had used the two destructive ultimate treasures at the same time and her water shield exploded. Su Ping didn’t hold back anymore. He made a stabbing motion with his crimson dagger, cutting apart the law of

vitality Qing Hongyue was using to protect herself and continuing toward her neck.

Qing Hongyue quickly moved back; however, her law-based power was destroyed by Su Ping’s ultimate treasure the moment it was released.

Having an ultimate treasure made a massive difference.

It was a weapon picked by a Celestial for their candidate!

Those who were part of other forces were destined not to have any ultimate treasures. They would be enslaved by the twelve ultimate treasure bearers, all within the Celestials’ calculations.

Some of the factions had taken this into consideration, still hoping to grasp a chance no matter how slim it was.

Bang!

A ghastly cutting trait with Ascendant State power brushed past her.

Qing Hongyue felt that her body was as cold as a corpse.

She was desperate. Deafening noises reached her; Su Ping’s attack had produced a ravine hundreds of meters wide next to him. He had actually created an abyss!

Su Ping’s sharp blade stopped right next to Qing Hongyue’s face as he declared coldly, “Calivey is right; it wasn’t easy for you to cultivate. Your life will be spared if you surrender your ultimate treasure!”

All of Qing Hongyue’s underlings were overtaken by shock as they witnessed that scene.

The Star State kid used four ultimate treasures!

They would’ve suspected that Su Ping had smuggled ultimate treasures into the trial if they hadn’t known it was impossible…

Somewhere close by—Claudia changed her expression; she flashed into another point in time.

She knew it was impossible for her to kill Su Ping by herself after seeing Qing Hongyue be defeated.

There would still be a chance for her if Su Ping only had offensive treasures, but he carried a defensive ultimate treasure her law-based attacks could hardly penetrate. Besides, Su Ping wasn’t a defenseless kid; he

wouldn’t simply stand there and allow her to attack. His counterattack was just as terrifying!

Fortunately, she was the Queen of Time; she was even confident of getting rid of Brian if the latter chased her.

Both had mastered the law of time, but their expertise was different.

It was just like how people who used the same weapon wouldn’t be equally strong.

Su Ping noticed that Claudia had run off, abandoning her subordinates. He didn’t chase her, but dropped a hint at Brian.

The latter understood and instantly disappeared.

Su Ping fixed his eyes upon Qing Hongyue. “Make your choice. I don’t have much patience.”

Hers was a sorry sight at the moment. She and Claudia weren’t allies to begin with; it was understandable that she wouldn’t step up to help her. However, all hope was lost now since Claudia had left.

“T’ll hand them over,” said Qing Hongyue with an awful looking expression. “Did you get your ultimate treasures from Calivey in the same way?”

“Smart one,” Su Ping complimented her calmly.

She smiled bitterly as she quickly complied, releasing the bond she had made with the two ultimate treasures. Then, she said to Su Ping, “My master personally made the phoenix feather for me. You cannot use it, even

if I give it to you; how about you let me keep it? I’ll give you a hand if we encounter anyone else.”

“I don’t need your help,” Su Ping turned her down without thinking, “It doesn’t matter whether or not I can use its power. The important bit is that you won’t be able to use it.”

Qing Hongyue felt like cursing.

Su Ping looked in the general direction where Brian disappeared to chase after the other woman. Ripples surfaced in the void exactly at that moment, and Brian quickly staggered out.

His chest was bloodstained again.

He was badly wounded.

Su Ping frowned; Claudia had an ultimate treasure. He had simply wanted Brian to trace her, not expecting her to be as brutal.

Right when he was about to talk—another person suddenly flew out of the deep space and fell to the ground.

She had a tall and elegant body, but she was heavily wounded too. It was none other than Claudia who had escaped earlier.

Judging by her condition, she was even more badly wounded than Brian!

“Brother Su, enemies!” Brian ran to Su Ping as quickly as possible the moment he returned.

He knew he wouldn’t be safe until he rejoined Su Ping.

Pah, pah, pah!

Someone clapped their hands.

The next moment, seven people slowly walked out of deeper spaces. Their leader was a handsome, sunny young man that made everybody who saw him feel at ease.

He was very likely one of the sunny dispositioned seniors in a school.

However, his eyes lengthened and became narrow when he smiled, making him look like a smiling viper.

“Marvelous.” While applauding, the young man squinted and chuckled. “Unfortunately, all of you have to die!”.
