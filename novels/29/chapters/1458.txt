Chapter 1459 Settlement (2)

Basha and the others looked solemn; they stayed silent after seeing Su Ping’s actions. Whether or not the latter was trying to hide the top-tier warriors of his clan, he was an ally nonetheless; perhaps he was just being prudent. They didn’t do anything else to test him, as it would be too offensive to overdo things.

At the end of the channel was a blue ocean.

In the center of the ocean was a vast continent, with mountains, plains, forests, flowers and grass, bursting with life. They could sense the remains of laws in the sky above; it was clearly a new creation.

“This place is important; it is located at the border between our south and north territories. This ocean is called Matiya, the largest of all, and this is one of its bays. We’re letting you stay here as a gesture of our friendliness,” said Crowe.

“Once you get to know this place better, you will know what a great geographical location this place is,” said Basha with a smile.

Su Ping nodded; their goodwill was rather impressive. He said, “Thank you very much. If there’s anything I can help you with, feel free to look for me.”

“Of course,” said Crowe with a smile.

“Now, this place is your territory. We will update the world map as soon as possible, so that everybody is aware of the matter. I hope that you’ll restrain your people well.”

“No problem.”

Su Ping nodded.

Su Ping watched them leave, then looked at the spacious continent before him. Even though it was referred to as a continent, it was ten times as big as the Blue Planet.

There were trillions of survivors rescued from the old universe-even a hundred Blue Planets wouldn’t suffice to accommodate them—and yet, those survivors were mostly living in the small universes of Shen Huang, Su Ping and the others. A lot of them were inside the Ascendant cultivators’ worlds; some Star Lords had also packed their families and friends in their small worlds.

Living in those places was no different from living in the outside world.

Any environment could be created and modified. It was actually more comfortable.

That new continent only had enough to accommodate the Ascendant cultivators and the Star Lords. It was more than enough.

“I will set up a barrier to protect you and block them,” Su Ping said to his master and the others, “This place will be yours in the future. Call me if anything happens. You can also establish a communication port outside the barrier; if there’s anything they want to tell you, they can use it.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Everybody nodded quickly.

Chi Huo couldn’t hold back anymore and asked curiously, “Boss Su, when did we become allies with them?”

Su Ping smiled and said, “It’s just a coincidence.”

They stopped asking, as they noticed Su Ping’s reluctance to tell. Su Ping carried too many secrets for them to figure out.

Shen Huang looked at the beautiful yet lifeless continent and remarked, “In any case, we have our own home for now…”

“However, according to them, this place is not safe; something will happen sooner or later,” said Chi Ying.

Su Ping nodded. “They were attacked by the Heavens before, but there were more experts in their clan who were able to hide. Perhaps something will happen in a dozen thousand years or so. We must leave before that; you should try to improve your strength in the meantime.”

“We must leave in a dozen thousand years?” Everybody was stunned for a moment. It was like having to move in a few years. Indeed, there was still a long time for that, the feeling of homelessness returned.

“Only if we keep cultivating and reach the apex of cultivation can we be qualified to

settle the score with the Heavens, live in peace, and even take back our universe,” said Su Ping.

Hiding was very likely an easy task for Sorcerer Ancestors.

Unfortunately, that level was still too far away. The world observed by Su Ping through the Golden Crow ancestor had been the most bizarre scene. Ordinary lives would never be able to imagine what those existences saw. “Boss Su, you’re right.” Chi Ying nodded, with ambition surfacing in his eyes.

The other Celestials, however, were showing

bitter expressions, as they weren’t confident of rising to higher levels. They couldn’t even condense a Dao Heart without Su Ping’s help… Su Ping’s goal was too far away for them.

They had already lost their cultivation momentum, and only wanted to live in peace. Feeling frustrated was understandable. After

all, cultivating diligently their entire lives had only gotten them to the Celestial State, which had already drained them; the future journey was even more difficult and exhausting.

Shen Huang realized what they were thinking; actually, he was feeling the same, so he could sympathize. He didn’t brood on the emotion, though. He spoke with a lively tone. “Let’s modify this place first.”

“Okay.”

They immediately started planning.

Many locations were marked, based on the area and shape of the continent. Then, they went ahead and started working.

The continent was soon divided into nine regions, same as the distribution in their hometown universe. The central area was left for Su Ping; as for the other regions, they built them according to the environment in their own star zones, essentially making them miniature star zones. Their ecosystem and climate were independent, which made them feel at home.

Su Ping went to the central region. The store was still on planet Rhea, but the planet had been perfectly fitted into the continent. He transferred all the planet’s residents to the continent.

He then contacted the Star Lords and Ascendants and asked them to accommodate

civilians in their small worlds.

In the other regions—Shen Huang and the other Celestials summoned their subordinates to help in settling the civilians. Then, they made arrangements for the Star Lords and the Ascendant cultivators.

The weakest residents on the continent were

Star Lords.

Only the families and friends of some experts who wanted to live in the outside world would be released.

“Is this the world in the new universe?”

At the store’s door-Joanna, Tang Ruyan and the others all looked into the distance. The store used to be on a business street, but they currently saw nothing but a vast plain before them.

Their building seemed quite lonely there. However, they knew that the place would soon be crowded.

Joanna raised her head and looked at the green sky, mumbling to herself, “The sky looks familiar…”

Su Ping asked, “Have you ever heard of the

cyborgs?”

“The cyborgs?”

Joanna was dazed for a moment. It dawned on her. “I didn’t know it was them. They are a

species that inherited the legacy of a major clan from the age of chaos; they’re essentially a derived species. I heard that they’re very smart. I remember what that is: It’s the Dao Crystal Piece. They’re using the Dao Crystal Piece to hide themselves; no wonder the Heavens can’t detect them…” “The Dao Crystal Piece?”

Su Ping looked at the green glass sky up above.

“That’s right. The Dao Crystal emerged in the age of chaos; I heard it was created in the big bang. It’s a product of the Great Dao; if ordinary lives hold the Dao Crystal in their hands, they will immediately comprehend the Great Dao and reach extraordinary levels,” said Joanna.

“So, it’s an ultimate treasure born from chaos.” Su Ping nodded.

“Anna does know a lot of stuff,” Green Lady

remarked.

Joanna said, “My grandmother told me about it when I was little. She said that a mythical creature had hidden inside a Dao Crystal to avoid being hunted by a Sorcerer Ancestor, back in the ancient age of chaos. It worked, as it escaped detection. Back then I thought it was just a story; I didn’t know that it truly existed.”

No wonder the presence of the Great Dao is so active and their cultivation is accelerated,

even though they’re hiding here. This is the preparation that the expert cyborgs made for them to rise again, right? Su Ping thought. “I wonder when we can return to our universe…”

There was nostalgia in Tang Ruyan’s eyes. Ever since she started following Su Ping, she had lost her family, her planet and even her universe. She only felt lucky that Su Ping had always been by her side and she could see him

all the time.
