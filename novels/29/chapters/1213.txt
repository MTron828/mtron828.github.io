Chapter 1215: Establishing the Eighth World

“The Primitive Chaos Clan?”

Su Ping felt puzzled as he looked at the Chief Elder.

“A lot of mythical creatures were born in the beginning of the universe. They formed many clans, each having their own totems and faiths.” The Chief Elder looked at Su Ping, conflicted feelings showing in his eyes. “However, one particular batch of creatures was born when chaos was split up. They were the Primitive Chaos Clan!

“Their clan members were powerful, with many types of energy and Dao Glyphs infused in their bodies. It’s said that they were able to build a new universe when they reached the peak!

“Still, all chaos kept splitting after the birth of the Primitive Chaos Clan. The powers that emerged gave birth to many other mythical creatures, including the Golden Crows.

“However, the mythical creatures born afterwards didn’t have many Dao Glyphs in their bodies anymore; only some of them had a few Dao Glyphs, such as the ancestors of the Sorcerer’s Bloodline you had before. They had twelve Dao Glyphs in their bodies, and knew the origins of laws such as wind, rain, and lightning.

“As for you…”

The Chief Elder looked at him with admiration and even some vague jealousy in his eyes. “You have 108 Dao Glyphs. Even though you cannot wield their power yet, you’re essentially carrying a gold mine. Not even Golden Crow peers will be able to fight you once you’re able to wield the power of the Primitive Chaos Clan.”

Su Ping listened while in a daze, never expecting that the combination of his bloodlines and constitutions could form the ultimate bloodline of the Primitive Chaos Clan.

Based on what he heard, it was a mythical lineage, even more terrifying than the Golden Crows’.

But even if I didn’t have the Primitive Chaos bloodline, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to defeat Golden Crows with the same cultivation level…?Su Ping thought. Of course, he couldn’t say anything aloud; after all, he owed them a big favor. It would be truly ungrateful of him to slap them in the face.

“Chief Elder, if you put it that way, will I be able to dominate all lives on my level when I completely grasp the Dao Glyphs in me?” asked Su Ping.

“Basically.”

The Chief Elder heaved a sigh. “Actually, you’re already talented enough to beat most juniors in my clan. Only the top geniuses may defeat you, such as Diqiong, who carries the ancestral bloodline.

“Still, you will surpass Diqiong very quickly by the time you grasp the Dao Glyphs. You could be on par with the ‘Heavens’!” said the Chief Elder.

Su Ping was both stunned and excited. He still didn’t know what the Heavens meant just yet, but he believed that none of them were weaker than Celestials.

“I can’t understand or use the Dao Glyphs though. Can you give me some guidance, Chief Elder?” asked Su Ping.

The Chief Elder nodded. “That’s normal; it would be bizarre if you could. My original plan was to let you go through the rite of passage after your own bloodlines became mythical, so that the bloodlines could combine and reach higher levels. But I didn’t expect…”

He gave a slight head shake and said, “You’re too weak right now. I’ll help you understand two Dao Glyphs; you must comprehend the rest on your own.”

Still dazed, Su Ping asked again, “Then, I don’t need to participate in the rite of passage anymore? Please let me; even though I’m a member of the Primitive Chaos Clan, my heart is still with the Golden Crows. I was born a Golden Crow and I’ll die as one!”

The Chief Elder rolled his eyes at Su Ping. “Enough of that. It’s not that I’m not letting you take part; you simply cannot participate anymore. Our bloodline residing in your body has already been absorbed by the Primitive Chaos bloodline as nutrition during the fusion; you’re no longer connected to our clan by blood.”

This gave Su Ping a shock; he quickly examined himself, only to find that he couldn’t see any signs of the Golden Crows in his body anymore, just like the Chief Elder said. He tried to activate the Solar Bulwark, but failed.

The young Golden Crow I saw…

Su Ping recalled everything that happened during the fusion of bloodlines. He had vaguely seen the illusion of a young Golden Crow shrieking.?Was that when the bloodline was sacrificed?

The Golden Crow bloodline, which he had cultivated so arduously, was gone. Su Ping felt somewhat regretful.

“I don’t have the Golden Crow bloodline anymore. Why are you still willing to help me, Chief Elder?” Su Ping looked at the great crow; he was flattered and confused by the guy’s generosity. Was it only because there was a human Heaven Master?

The Chief Elder’s favor was clearly not small.

The elder gave a slight head shake, with a smile on his weary face. “I’m just wagering on a possibility, and I hope I made the right decision. Anyways, I’ll help you understand two Dao Glyphs. How far you can go in the future will depend on your power of understanding.”

Su Ping felt that the Chief Elder had taken him to a world full of scorching golden flames, vast and endless.

They were reflected on the ground, which looked like a golden, tranquil lake.

The Chief Elder waved a hand, and two of the 108 Dao Glyphs found in Su Ping’s body shook, then floated in front of the young man’s eyes.

“Let’s start with this Dao Glyph. It represents fire! But it’s different from the path of fire you know; it contains all fires found in the universe through time!

“We can dissect the glyph into eighteen Dao Patterns, including temperature, splitting, scorching flames, golden fire…” The Chief Elder waved a hand and inferred those details for Su Ping’s benefit.

The Dao Glyph revolved slowly, emitting golden light that turned into complex Dao Patterns. Each pattern was magnified 100,000 times; countless laws could be seen among them.

The Dao Pattern of temperature alone contained the temperatures of time, space, void, ice, and many others.

Those patterns were floating before Su Ping’s eyes. He was stunned, never thinking that the laws in that world could be as complicated. One of the eighteen Dao Patterns already contained all features found in the perfect path of fire. The other seventeen patterns contained many more things.

That revelation made him understand that the path of fire he knew was just at a beginner level, far from perfection.

There was a lot more he had yet to assimilate!

Mastery… Perfection… The so-called perfection only means that the laws I grasp are complete and can be melted into the Dao Pattern as part of it.

The eighteen Dao Patterns contain thousands of laws, but they can only construct one Dao Glyph in the end…

The eighteen Dao Patterns swirling around him left him in a daze. Only eighteen of them and he could see thousands of laws in them.

He suddenly understood why it was said that the three thousand Dao Glyphs could describe everything in the universe.

A single Dao Glyph contained infinite wisdom and laws by itself. Su Ping had a sudden and strong thirst for exploration; he wanted to explore all paths and find out the ultimate secret of the universe.

Once again, the Chief Elder waved a hand and slowly destroyed the Dao Patterns, inferring them from laws. Countless laws were split up and gathered into Dao Patterns, which reassembled to form a Dao Glyph, which contained infinite traits and variations.

Time flew.

Once the Chief Elder finished analyzing the Dao Glyph, he pushed it back into Su Ping’s body and said, “How much you can understand is up to you. Even if you can’t understand fully at the moment, you should be able to manage in a hundred years.”

He had already planted the seed; it could sprout at any time.

After grasping the first Dao Glyph, Su Ping would be able to grasp the others one by one…

“The natural-born glyph of the Golden Crows…” Su Ping mumbled and felt something. Scorching flames emanated all over his body all of a sudden. The glyph of fire glittered brilliantly inside his body. Its features were burning, using Su Ping’s energy as fuel; they were manifested as Golden Crow fire!

“…”

The Golden Crow opened his mouth, stunned. He knew that Su Ping was smart, but he didn’t expect that the boy would be able to wield the power of almost ten Dao Patterns after watching a single demonstration!

He suddenly felt regretful. Had he helped Su Ping using their clan’s rite of passage, that genius could have eventually become a rising new star among Golden Crows!

Time and space were twisted as Su Ping controlled the power, and all kinds of Dao Patterns appeared around him. They contained enormous power, enough to crush any Star Lord.

Su Ping even felt that Dao Patterns could even put him on equal terms when confronting Ascendant laws!

Dao Patterns can be used to construct laws…?Su Ping remembered the law he had created during the fusion of bloodlines. He instantly unfolded some Dao Patterns, and inserted some of their features into another pattern. One of the Dao Patterns quickly changed and several laws were born!

They were just ordinary laws, but they brought new features to the Dao Pattern.

The Chief Elder’s eyes widened and his hands began to shiver when he saw this. He didn’t say anything to avoid disturbing the human. His regret couldn’t go any deeper.

Is this fate at work? Maybe… He’ll be able to put an end to this war like that human being did!?The Chief Elder was pondering in silence, awash with complicated feelings.

A long time passed. Su Ping was really excited with the initial testing. He asked the Chief Elder, “Do you think I used it correctly?”

“…Yes.”

Then, the elder taught Su Ping the second Dao Glyph.

Once the demonstration was over, the Chief Elder said to Su Ping, “You only have enough energy to use two Dao Glyphs right now. You can try to comprehend the rest of the Dao Glyphs on your own. It’s up to you whether to stay here or not. I’ll ask Diqiong to arrange a residence for you if you choose to stay for a while.”

Su Ping thought for a moment and said, “I wish to cultivate here for a while longer.”

“Okay.”

The Chief Elder nodded. The vast golden world was gone; they were back in the tree hole. The crow elder summoned Diqiong who was waiting outside, then waved a hand. “Arrange a place for him to cultivate. See him out.”

Diqiong was confused. She asked, “Chief Elder, are you all right? You look rather exhausted.”

“Go…”

The Chief Elder waved her off; his exhaustion was on a mental level.

She was still puzzled, but she didn’t ask further. She then glanced at Su Ping and a strange feeling rushed over her. She vaguely found Su Ping threatening, as if he were her natural enemy.

But, did Golden Crows have any natural enemies?

Once they were outside the tree, Diqiong sized Su Ping up and asked, “Your bloodline…”

“It’s now complete.”

Su Ping chuckled. He controlled his body and regained the human appearance, shrinking back to a two-meter height; he looked tall and handsome.

“I know it’s complete; what’s your bloodline now?” asked Diqiong suspiciously.

“I won’t tell you.” Su Ping grinned.

Infuriated, Diqiong stomped on the ground. “Do you think it’s anything special? It can’t be as good as ours. Humph!”

Su Ping smiled, not planning on arguing with her. His bloodline couldn’t have advanced without the Golden Crows’ help; he would obviously not attack their princess.

Su Ping summoned the Little Skeleton and his other pets when they reached Diqiong’s residence. He wasn’t in a hurry to leave because he intended to consolidate his gains. There were also other things to do—

For example, he needed to teach his pets the way to establish seven small worlds, so that they could do the same.

Su Ping wasn’t afraid of his pets betraying him; he already considered them family after having spent so much time together.

Besides, he wanted to condense the eighth world right where he was!

That’s right. Su Ping thought he had figured out how to establish the eighth world after gaining the Primitive Chaos Clan’s bloodline. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The seventh world was the World of Heavenly Tribulations.

The eighth world would be the World of Mythical Chaos!

I’ll consider rising to the Ascendant State after establishing the eighth world. I’m already capable of creating laws of my own, but none of my experimentation creating laws broke through the Ascendant State bottleneck…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered; he was slightly worried about his journey to the Ascendant State.

Normal Star Lords would invoke a Heavenly Tribulation after creating a law of their own, and would become Ascendants if they survived!

However, he didn’t sense a whiff of tribulation when he created laws. He then thought that his journey to the Ascendant State would be different; normal methods were probably useless to him. He had to make preparations.

“Is there anything I can help you with?” Diqiong took good care of Su Ping even though she often bickered with him.

“Yes.”

“What?”

“Watch the door for me.”

“Get lost!”

Diqiong berated herself for being generous to such a guy. She stormed off, leaving two Golden Crow guards.

Time flew.

Su Ping imparted the Little Skeleton and the other pets the laws he had grasped through the method offered by the system. It was amazingly effective; if Su Ping was strong, his pets would be strong too. Conversely, Su Ping could borrow from the findings of his pets.

Su Ping’s secluded training to condense an eighth world began right after the Little Skeleton and the others grasped the knowledge.

The eighth world had primitive chaos and the 108 Dao Glyphs as its foundation. He constructed the world bit by bit. Unlike the previous seven worlds, the eighth world wasn’t founded on one particular law; it was a much bigger and more solid world, built with more materials.
