Chapter 804: Leader of the Alliance of Stars

Su Ping left the laboratory and returned to the lobby.

The Little Skeleton was standing there; its white bones were covered in bloody stripes, which made it look evil and demonic.

In addition, although the Little Skeleton wasn’t leaking much aura and was quite self-contained, it carried an intimidating aura; looking like a king peering down at its subjects.

Su Ping was slightly surprised. Was this caused by the Condensed Blood Dragon Crystal?

He used the Pet Identification Skill on the Little Skeleton and found that its combat ability had increased by more than fifty points; it had essentially grasped a new law.

It also had a new bloodline ability.

Dragon Demon Bone Shield:

Transform dragon bones into a shield with the power of the Bone Demon. Can be used in the merged state!

It turned out to be a defensive bloodline ability.

It can also be used when it’s attached to me? If that’s the case, I can have the Little Skeleton take over my defense when I battle, Su Ping thought.

Although he preferred offensive abilities, defense was necessary under certain circumstances.

Su Ping looked at the Little Skeleton and noticed the changes in its bones, which seemed to contain a dragon aura; there were also scales on some of the bones.

The scales were even more obvious at the finger bones.

Su Ping petted the Little Skeleton and asked with a smile, “How do you feel?”

The Little Skeleton gazed at Su Ping in silence for half a minute, before it slightly opened its mouth. “Good...”

“You can talk now?” Su Ping was surprised to see his bony pet talk, in the local tongue.

The Little Skeleton had a great power of understanding. After all, it had been in the nursing pen all the time. Even though it was just a lowly skeleton at the beginning, it had grown to become an ultimate pet.

However, it never seemed too good at talking.

“Great, I’ll ask the dog and the dragon to teach you how to talk.”

“Okay...”

Su Ping smiled, choosing not to stay any longer. He left for the Void Debris with his pets as well as some of the customers’.

He went to that place again because he wanted to gain more experience before he reached the Fate State. If he was able to perceive one more law of space, his bridge would become more solid and his combat ability would be doubled.

...

In the Void Debris of Void—

Su Ping looked for beasts to test his combat ability.

Having just absorbed the Retribution Phoenix’s feather, Su Ping knew that he was stronger, but he didn’t know exactly how strong he was when he merged with the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound.

Inside the fourth space—Su Ping rushed unstoppably as if he were roaming on a continent.

Occasionally—when he ran into the chaotic power of laws in the void—Su Ping captured it in time. That was a benefit related to the laws of space.

He wouldn’t have been as sensitive if he would have grasped another law.

He searched and fought on the way. When he encountered cracks, he simply broke in and fought in the deeper fifth space.

While he was there, even Su Ping had to tread carefully in spite of his understanding of space. He may get injured or even killed if he was careless.

Also, the most dangerous thing here was the vague whispers of ancient creatures.

Those words were left by ancient, Ascendant State creatures, or even stronger, in other times and spaces. Their bodies were immortal, and their words contained extraordinary power that couldn’t be worn out by time. The words were saved in that deep space.

Such words contained the mental power of those ancient creatures, which could be alluring; they could easily drive people crazy.

Fortunately, Su Ping had great willpower; he simply broke free whenever he ran into formidable enemies.

After going through all the practices, Su Ping ended up with a better understanding of his combat ability.

...

The next day.

Su Ping returned to his shop. It was business as usual in the morning; however, the city preliminaries would be held on that day and his pets would have to participate.

Su Ping didn’t close the shop; he simply asked Joanna and Tang Ruyan to take care of things.

Even if Tang Ruyan was unable to deal with the customers, she could still work as a supporter while Joanna supervised the shop.

Su Ping arrived at the field of the preliminaries and reported the Little Skeleton’s name; all the referees then jumped from their chairs in awe and greeted Su Ping respectfully.

The news of the previous day had been spread out, and the mayor had already issued instructions for them; none dared to be disrespectful.

This Little Skeleton’s master is the Star State boss who defeated a Star State expert from the Hugh Mia Academy, making him vomit blood. How could we dare offend him?

Not just them; even O’Neil, the most powerful man on Rhea, had to treat Su Ping courteously.

Su Ping was at a loss for words since he had been seen through quite easily. He finally remembered that the Little Skeleton had been exposed the previous day.

Fine. I’ll simply reveal myself and resume my original appearance.

The rule is that every pet will fight random opponents, right?

Hearing the exclamations around them, Su Ping gave a bitter smile and asked, “When will my match begin?”

“Right now,” said one of the referees obstreperously.

The game will start whenever you want it to start.

Su Ping’s lips twitched when he saw the guy’s attitude. He confirmed yet again that those who were strong enough could change the rules!

Su Ping didn’t intend to break the rules. He waited patiently.

The match began soon after; the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound were summoned.

From Su Ping’s perspective—the city preliminaries were just sort of a formality.

However, what happened later gave Su Ping a better understanding of “formality.”

The opponents to contend against the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound simply forfeited the games. As a result, they left the arena after wandering for a moment.

Later on, the Dark Dragon Hound and the Little Skeleton ran into each other and would have to fight. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Su Ping simply had the Dark Dragon Hound give up.

It was unnecessary for them to fight, as they had fought enough in the cultivation sites and the Dark Dragon Hound was definitely unable to beat the Little Skeleton. A fight would be a waste of time and energy for them.

Besides, even if they were to fight, the audience would not have the chance to see their performance, because their battle would have definitely extended to the tertiary space.

Very few battle pets had passed the screening phase to begin with, and many contestants decided to forfeit. So, the preliminaries would probably be completed within one day, when they usually took a week.

Su Ping yawned while he waited; it was quite boring for him to watch other pets fight.

To be more specific, the battles of those pets were quite juvenile as they were.

Su Ping even saw a few pets he had trained, but he wasn’t very satisfied with their performance. He felt he should conduct a pertinent and more thorough training if he ever met those pets again.

Those pets had already been trained by me anyway. How could they be so lame?

However, while Su Ping was dissatisfied, the audience was exclaiming and cheering.

They were regretful that they didn’t get to see Su Ping’s pets fight, but the fierce battles of some of the other pets were quite spectacular.

Bored out of his skull, Su Ping went to see a referee and said, “I won’t come tomorrow if nobody challenges my pets. You can simply report my name. How does it sound?”

The referee was a Fate State old man; he was stunned to hear that. If anyone else would have said that... he would’ve slapped them in the face. Just who do you think you are?

However, Su Ping was the one who said it.

“Yes, of course,” he crossed his hands and said humbly and respectfully, “You don’t have to come to such trivial games, senior. I don’t think anyone would dare to challenge your pets.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping nodded and then returned with the Little Skeleton and his other pets.

...

Su Ping returned to the shop, then saw Tang Ruyan and Joanna who were still greeting customers.

Tang Ruyan looked at him in surprise after noticing that Su Ping had returned a bit too quickly. “It’s over already?”

“No, I returned in advance.”

“Is it too boring? Haha.” Tang Ruyan was able to piece the situation together based on Su Ping’s expressions; she couldn’t help but laugh.

Su Ping rolled his eyes and was about to replace her, when he suddenly received a message via the Lord Badge.

He quickly viewed the message.

“Esteemed Lord of the Blue Planet, you have a notification from your battle alliance.”

Battle alliance? Is it the Alliance of Stars that was made of battle pets?

“Open it.”

Soon after, the image of a hazy person appeared in Su Ping’s mind. The person seemed to be slim and roughly 1.6 meters tall.

A soft voice that pretended to be cold and condescending gave out an order.

“All members of this alliance, listen to my command. Gather on the Red Fire Planet in Zeruprun at 9 in the evening on the 18th!

“This alliance is determined to claim the divine residence; all members have to be present. Those who defy my orders shall be expelled; you may ask for leave in advance if you have special circumstances.”

Su Ping was rather surprised. The divine residence?

Is it the one that O’Neil mentioned earlier?

The Alliance of Stars is going to participate as a group in that excursion?
