Chapter 534 The Dragon Spike

Kill that human!

The dragons took turns to try their claws at killing Su Ping. He didn’t just stand there, letting the dragons hurt him. He would fight back with all his might every time! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He carried with him an unyielding will. No matter how much weaker he was, and no matter how little hurt he could do to the purple-blood dragons, he would fight back, with all his might!

As a matter of fact, the old dragon could ignore Su Ping’s strikes, but not the other purple-blood dragons. Su Ping was a person that had the ability to kill the weaker ones at the Fate State. His strikes were not without effect; those purple-blood dragons were experiencing sharp pain! “You vermin!” “Why are you still coming back to life? Why?”

“Die! Drop dead!!”

The purple-blood dragons carried on with their attacks. Their strikes were a way for them to vent their fury in the beginning, but they had gradually become mentally disturbed since Su Ping was still able to revive and hurt them. The minor injuries had developed into serious wounds.

More importantly, the constant revivals had deprived the dragons of hope!

It was a tiny human being, but he was a source of despair for the dragons!

Some purple-blood dragons decided that they could no longer take it. They wanted to seal Su Ping, which would stop him from coming back to life. They would freeze Su Ping for eternity until he naturally died of old age. He would not be able to revive by that point, not again!

That proposal was agreed upon. The purple-blood dragons thought there was a limit to Su Ping’s revivals. They were worn out after such a long time fighting, physically and mentally. After all, they would have to use a great amount of power each time they struck.

For example, it took a normal person vigorous punches to kill prey; the person would sweat and get tired after throwing hundreds of punches, but the prey could fight back every time. Not only would the person become tired, there would also be pain. “Seal him!”

“Banish him to the Evil Dragon Ruins!!”

After gaining approval from the old dragon of the Star Rank, the other purple-blood dragons worked together and froze the space around Su Ping, then created many chains that trapped him inside.

The accumulated strength of eight purple-blood dragons at the peak of the Fate State completely immobilized Su Ping.

The Force Field was still behind Su Ping, operating. The figures inside the Force Field were vague but intimidating.

That old dragon had noticed Su Ping’s Force Field and how odd it was. But after thinking that Su Ping was merely a puny human being, the old dragon decided to ignore it. While Su Ping was unable to move his body, he was able to work with his mind. Those purple-blood dragons had finally decided to seal him, which was what he was worried about. He struggled but was unable to regain his freedom.

I think it only works on my body, but not on the astral powers inside me.

Su Ping noticed that. Maybe it was because he wasn’t that much weaker than the purple-blood dragons at the Fate State. As such, they could merely stop him from moving around physically. Su Ping had an idea.

Bang!

All the astral powers inside the cell cores began to blast out. The surge of energy was more than he had ever experienced. Still, the chaotic and uncontrollable energy was running wild and he himself was the first to be destroyed.

Bang!

Su Ping’s body was gone and so was his soul.

Such a resolute suicide...

Revive!

Su Ping returned again and he was finally free. That was to say, the purple-blood dragons would have to seal him again.

The dragons were stunned, then they flew into a rage. Killing himself to escape. That was unacceptable!

While he glared at them, Su Ping once again was standing in front of the dragon origin.

The old dragon realized that the eight purple-blood dragons themselves were unable to stop Su Ping. The old dragon summoned up its strength and sealed off both space and time.

That would mean that Su Ping’s mind would no longer function and he would be unable to kill himself.

Su Ping was soon immobilized.

“Go and get the Dragon Spike. We must destroy his astral powers!” the old dragon announced. The purple-blood dragons hated themselves for not thinking about it.

Once Su Ping’s powers were depleted, they would be able to do whatever they wanted with him.

Su Ping would wish he were dead. They would have the freedom to torture him at will!

Whoosh!

One of the purple-blood dragons flew away at once.

Before long, the dragon came back, bringing three blood-red spears which were glistening brightly. The spears didn’t seem to be made of metal but... some sort of polished fangs! “The Dragon Spikes! Let’s end him!” the purple-blood dragons bellowed.

Without hesitation, the dragon pierced Su Ping through with one of the spikes and nailed him on the ground in front of the lake.

The blood-red spikes were quite thick. Three would be needed if they wanted to nail a dragon. But considering how small Su Ping was, one would be sufficient. After Su Ping was impaled, the old dragon stopped freezing time and space; it would cost the dragon too much energy to continue that lock.

Su Ping regained his mind the moment the old dragon stopped. The first sensation he felt was pain, a piercing pain in his chest. Su Ping saw that he had been impaled. He could not move at all while being nailed to the ground.

The more appalling realization was that he was completely unable to feel his astral powers! “What is this!” Against the pain, Su Ping snarled.

Seeing how Su Ping struggled amused the purple-blood dragons. The one that was still holding the other two spikes sneered at Su Ping. “No matter how powerful you are, there’s nothing you can do now that you’re pinned by the spike!”

“We only use this punishment for the most sinful dragons. You’re the first pitiful creature who can enjoy this in all of our history!”

“Soak in the feeling. Consider this an honor for you!” The purple-blood dragons looked down on Su Ping, feeling pleased. They never imagined that one day they would be forced into such a state by such a pitiful being. What a shame.

The old dragon glared at Su Ping, wishing to cut him into pieces.

Well, that was not a wish. The old dragon had already done that. But cutting him into pieces had not been of any use.

Su Ping tried to find traces of astral powers but failed in the endeavor. With a heavy mind, he tried to summon the Dark Dragon Hound but he didn’t even have the astral powers to do

that.

He was like a man of the common run.

Su Ping endured the pain as he said to the purple-blood dragons, “Is this how honorable you boast yourselves to be? You use this dirty trick to imprison an opponent that you cannot defeat. Don’t you feel humiliated?”

“Punk, do not try to provoke us again.”

“Such a pathetic move. Do you honestly think we will fall for that? I will treat you so well that you’ll wish you were dead!”

The purple-blood dragons did fall prey to Su Ping’s provocation. But indeed, Su Ping had pointed out a harsh fact. The purple-blood dragons chose to ignore that provocation. No other dragon would know if they didn’t speak of that day’s humiliation.

He felt a disturbance in his mind while he was thinking about a solution. He wanted to look over but was unable to, considering his state.

The water rippled in the lake, and a large amount of dragon origin was swimming toward the Inferno Dragon.

Su Ping was able to tell that the Inferno Dragon was coming back!

The disturbance on the lake had also alerted the dragons. They flew into another wild fit of rage. “Stop it!”

“Ah!! You dirty thing. Stop it!!”.

“What are you trying to do with so much dragon origin?”

The enraged purple-blood dragons wanted to make the Inferno Dragon leave the lake. And yet, they couldn’t find its current location.

The Inferno Dragon was at the bottom of the lake as it rebuilt its body. The turbulence in space alerted the Inferno Dragon when the purple-blood dragons struck, so the Inferno Dragon had moved away.

“Get out of here!!”

The purple-blood dragons were losing their minds. But this time, no matter how angry and agitated they were, they didn’t strike.

They could harm the dragon origin if they reached too deep inside; no more dragon origin would be generated if the harm was too grave. That would mean that the purple-blood dragon race would end along with the depletion of the dragon origin! The old dragon stared at the tumbling water with a grave look.

A swirl appeared in the water. The Inferno Dragon was at the center of the swirl and the dragon origin was surging toward it.

The old dragon thought about trying to freeze time. But the special nature of the dragon origin dictated that it couldn’t be frozen by time. The dragon origin continued to move toward the Inferno Dragon; the old dragon would only be able to stop the dragon origin to flow away after it killed the Inferno Dragon.

Still, the old dragon had to be cautious, since the Inferno Dragon was inside the dragon origin.

“Go to hell!”

The old dragon struck after finding the right timing. It wielded a blade of time. Those below the Star Rank would not be able to foresee the arrival of such a blade. Surely the Inferno Dragon would be unable to detect it!

The old dragon was careful. The blade was just strong enough to kill the Inferno Dragon and was not as sharp, to avoid hurting the dragon origin.

Bang!

It went without saying that the Inferno Dragon had died.

Su Ping furiously brought the Inferno Dragon back to life.

The Inferno Dragon was restored to the state it was at before dying. A new body was formed and it was different from before. Mixed with the dark red scales were some dark purple scales which were found on purple-blood dragons.

The Inferno Dragon regained its consciousness fully after coming back to life; it was a bit confused about the things that were happening. Instinct alone had told the Inferno Dragon to consume that delicious thing.

The Inferno Dragon could then see how Su Ping had been impaled to the ground.

The pet dragon was immediately incensed.
