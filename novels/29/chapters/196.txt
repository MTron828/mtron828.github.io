Chapter 198 You!

“Who’s there!”

Senior Feng flew into a violent fit of rage.

A deep blue strand of astral powers surged out of him like a hurricane, and things within a five thousand meter range appeared on his mind within an instant; soon enough, he saw three beasts crouched behind him near some towering trees.

When he had a clear sense of one of the pets, calm as he usually would be, he could not help but feel fear.

“Inferno Dragon!”

Senior Feng did not expect to see a rare dragon at this place. Inferno Dragons were among the best three dragons on the blue planet. But other than the Inferno Dragon, the other two beasts were less eye-catching. The Dark Dragon Hound and the Purple Python were both middle-rank beasts. Only those two were a bit different. They seemed to be larger than usual.

Tang Ruyan was checking on some piles of dirt on the ground which she had found strange, as if something were hiding there. She turned around at once when she heard Senior Feng’s angry voice, only to find him burning with rage.

Tang Ruyan stared blankly at him for a moment. When she came back to her senses, she dashed over. “Senior Feng?”

Senior Feng kept his focus on the three beasts. Those three beasts from different species were not wild beasts. They were someone’s pets. He cautioned Tang Ruyan, “Beware. We’re not dealing with a regular guy.”

He had not seen that person yet but someone with an Inferno Dragon pet could not be some simple boy.

Tang Ruyan was surprised to see Senior Feng acting so serious. She looked around, highly vigilant.

The burly man, who was still stuck in front of the tree, did not expect there would be another sudden change in this incident. Someone was lurking nearby, attempting to take the treasure away from the Tang Family.

The burly man forced a smile; this was an opportunity to vent his anger. He threw a look at Senior Feng. Since the latter had shifted his focus away from him, he worked up some strength and ran to another direction.

“Do you think you have a chance?”

Senior Feng glanced at the burly man coldly. At his command, the dark shadow behind him dashed away. This time, the dark shadow ran even faster than before. In the meanwhile, two clones were generated.

The three dark shadows reached the burly man in an instant and pierced his body like three sharp blades.

The burly man, in a fit of fear, wielded his saber and his fists. However, since the three dark shadows were too fast, none of his strikes found a target. Soon, the burly man lost control of the situation. To make it worse, Zhuo Fengqun also went and joined the fight.

“We are from the Tang Family. Who are you? Dare you show your face?!”

Senior Feng paid no heed to that burly man; the man was as good as dead for him. But the person with the Inferno Dragon was giving some pressure. He put his guard up.

The other Tang Family guards had taken care of the burly man’s teammates. They approached Tang Ruyan to protect her.

Senior Feng could tell that the three beasts were not leaving. Instead, they were getting closer. It surprised him to find that someone could be this bold and arrogant. He felt dread because of this person.

A young man’s voice sighing was heard coming from the Purple Python.

“Enemies do walk a narrow path...”

If you didn’t look carefully, it would appear as if the Purple Python could speak.

Tang Ruyan and the other guards saw the three beasts. All of them were appalled when they cast their eyes on the Inferno Dragon.

Inferno Dragons were so rare and precious that not even the Tang family had one!

It was one of the three best dragons but this kind was extremely rare. Money alone was not enough to buy an Inferno Dragon. There were only a few of them in the entire world. The Tang Family couldn’t buy one even if they wanted to. They had to be blessed with great luck to come across one!

Tang Ruyan was both surprised and wary after seeing the Inferno Dragon. She secretly activated an astral power shield to cover her body and assumed a combat position.

Senior Feng stared at the Purple Python. When he checked closed, he sensed another presence on the head of the Purple Python; that presence stunned him.

That was someone... he was familiar with it.

He couldn’t remember where he had met that person but it had been a recent encounter.

“What a coincidence. We meet again.”

The scales on the Purple Python’s head shrank down a bit, revealing Su Ping. He smiled as he glanced over the crowd.

Tang Ruyan and the guards who had been on high alert were surprised when Su Ping revealed himself.

They had met this person when they first entered the Mysterious Realm. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Is he that hothead?!

Tang Ruyan didn’t know what to say.

She had thought that this person had to be a titled battle pet warrior from a powerful background. After all, Senior Feng had taken action. The person who had just made a display of power belonged to the titled battle pet warriors category. He must be extremely confident to be able to snatch the box away from Senior Feng.

How could she have known that it was the young man Su Ping who was behind all this?!

There came a noise and then a miserable cry from afar. Under the concerted attacks from the Devil Shadow and Zhuo Fengqun, the burly man had finally collapsed. The Devil Shadow crushed his neck and ripped his head off.

Before he passed away, the burly man punched Zhuo Fengqun, who turned pale because of the serious injury.

The Devil Shadow ate up the burly man’s head and flew back to Senior Feng. Zhuo Fengqun moved back to Tang Ruyan’s side after this man had been taken care of. Zhuo Fengqun noticed that something was off as soon as he arrived. He was frightened to see this Inferno Dragon among the three pets.

Soon, he noticed Su Ping who was sitting on the head of the Purple Python. That realization stunned him.

“You!”

Senior Feng pulled a long face. He knew he had detected a familiar presence. He didn’t notice this punk sitting on the Purple Python at first. He couldn’t believe that it was this punk who had snatched the box away, nor did he foresee that the punk who couldn’t even pass the second dragon bone had an Inferno Dragon!

That was to say, this punk must have stopped voluntarily as he climbed the dragon bones.

Tang Ruyan had a similar realization; her pretty face was covered in ice. No matter who Su Ping was, given his age, he definitely wasn’t stronger than Senior Feng. She could tell right away that this Inferno Dragon had just reached adulthood.

The Inferno Dragon was one of the best dragons. That being said, because of the limitations on its rank, the Inferno Dragon could not display its full strength.

She found it ridiculous that this person didn’t run away after he had snatched the box away. Rather, he had the guts to walk up to them. He was simply suicidal!

However, his action alerted them. This person was acting boldly. There might be an ambush set up! “Which family are you from?” Senior Feng asked.

Su Ping grinned. “You’re about to die. You don’t need to know.”

Senior Feng and all the others were angered by those words.

“You’re so full of yourself!” Zhuo Fengqun, who was still catching his breath, heard Su Ping’s words. “Punk, you were lucky we didn’t kill you at the plaza. You would have been long gone if it weren’t for the fact that Venerable the Blade came to your rescue. Since you’re here to seek your doom, let me grant your wish!”

Su Ping smiled but the look in his eyes was frigid. He didn’t leave because he wanted to get back at the Tang Family for the slap he took at the plaza!

He couldn’t harm the Tang Family outside because a battle would put him at the center of attention. But, things were different inside the Mysterious Realm.
