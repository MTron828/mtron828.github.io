Chapter 477 Chance Only Favors the Prepared Mind

“Mr. Su, are you serious?”

Zhou Tianlin was baffled. He stood, rooted on the ground. Su Ping was fine settling for sixty million and forgoing the billions?

He was giving away the pets for free!

Qin Duhuang was just as puzzled. What did he have up his sleeve?

“Mr. Su, how do we proceed?” Qin Duhuang asked at once. He didn’t care about how much money he had to spend. He would be willing even if Su Ping were to ask for over one million. He just wanted to get the pets as soon as possible.

“How?” Su Ping didn’t know what to say, “Delivery upon payment. Give me a good review after we finish our transaction. That is how. Have you all forgotten how to buy things after staying in your high positions for too long?” They all looked at Su Ping, still dumbfounded. Of course, they knew how to buy things. But that was how they would buy common pets!

We’re talking about pets at the peak of the ninth rank here. So simple? Really?!

Qin Duhuang came back to his senses at once. “Mr. Su, I will pay right now. You’ve already promised me that you’re going to sell them to me. I’m paying right now. Sixty million, right? I am giving you one hundred million!”

With that said, he was ready to transfer the money on his phone.

First come, first served. Since Su Ping had said so, he would have to trust him!

Anyways, the top priority was to get the pets! Zhou Tianlin and the family head of the Ye family hurried over. “Me, too!”

They elbowed each other away, trying to be the first to give Su Ping money. Su Ping said grumpily, “Please, you’re all family heads. Why aren’t you acting even as politely as the common people? Don’t you know something called a line?” Zhou Tianlin and the family head of the Ye family were rendered speechless.

For god’s sake, pets at the peak of the ninth rank could make any common titled battle pet warrior become outstanding! Who would care about politeness? Su Ping should be happy that they didn’t start fighting about the pets!

While the two of them were getting red in the face, Qin Duhuang had snatched the first position in the line. Standing behind him was his old friend who reacted quite quickly as well.

“Mr. Su, I’m ready to make the transfer.” Qin Duhuang smiled brightly. Whether Su Ping meant what he said or not, Qin Duhuang was the first in line. No need for him to panic anymore. Su Ping nodded. He texted his account number to Qin Duhuang and asked, “Which one do you want?”

“That one.” Qin Duhuang paid one hundred million and pointed to the Fierce Fire Ape, “That is a pet of the fire family, a perfect fit for

me.”

Su Ping nodded and replied, “That one is 59 million. I’ll give you back the extra money. I told you, not a penny more. Don’t make me go through the trouble of giving back money again in the future.”

Qin Duhuang was speechless. He was just trying to be generous and he ended up being scolded.

Su Ping really didn’t want to make money?

Qin Duhuang gave an embarrassed smile but didn’t ask more questions. He could not figure out Su Ping’s personality, so he decided to be prudent and precise in speech.

Su Ping saw the 59 million astral coins were converted into five hundred and ninety thousand energy points. After feeling a tingling pain in his heart, he heaved a sigh inwardly and shook his head. “All right now, go and sign the contract. Anyway, do you know the requirements for buying pets in my store?”

“Requirements?”

Qin Duhuang was about to sign the contract. Su Ping’s words made him nervous. “What requirements?”

Qin Duhuang said to himself that things indeed were more complicated than it appeared. Zhou Tianlin and the family head of the Ye family thought the same thing. Su Ping had other intentions.

Su Ping had to repeat his rules, “Anyone who buys pets in my store cannot abandon or transfer the pets. If you don’t need the pets or the pets have become useless to you, you will have to wait for 10 years before you can cancel the contract!

“Even after that, you must treat your pet well. Either you find the pets a new master or you find a way to make sure that they can spend the rest of their lives in comfort.”

All three were puzzled. They thought that Su Ping was going to ask them something extremely hard or was up to something shady. It turned out that it was a simple demand.

Who would transfer or abandon a pet at the peak of the ninth rank!?

“No problem,” Qin Duhuang answered at once.

“You better be a man of your word. Once you violate your promise, your name will be on the blacklist and shall never be removed from it!” Su Ping sounded serious.

The rules were made by the system. The system must have a way to supervise the pet owners and anyone who violated the rules would be put onto the blacklist automatically!

Qin Duhuang knew that Su Ping meant it. He thought about it seriously and answered after he was sure that he could do it. “I will make sure of that.”

Su Ping nodded and said nothing else.

Su Ping mentioned no more rules or requirements. Qin Duhuang asked carefully, “Then, should I go and sign the contract now?” “...Yes.”

Qin Duhuang breathed in relief after gaining Su Ping’s permission. Amid everyone’s eyes, nervously and excited, Qin Duhuang approached the two pets.

He went to the Fierce Fire Ape and raised his head to look into its eyes. The ape was looking at him as well. What a pair of cold and detached eyes. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Instead of feeling afraid, Qin Duhuang was quite happy. The more violent the pet was, the more powerful it would be!

First, Qin Duhuang unleashed a small wisp of astral powers and placed his hand on the ape. He started the process after making sure that the pet was not resisting him.

Roar!

The Fierce Fire Ape bellowed during the process.

Since Qin Duhuang was a titled battle pet warrior, signing the contract with a pet of the ninth rank was not a difficult thing. Soon, the contract was established. A beam of blue light turned into some intricate lines that were engraved on the Fierce Fire Ape. The lines submerged into its fur and left a mark on its soul.

In the meantime, similar lines appeared on Qin Duhuang’s forehead and then sunk into his skin.

The contract was signed. Nature was the witness.

Qin Duhuang was happy once he felt the additional consciousness in his mind. A swirl appeared; the Fierce Fire Ape glared at him but did not resist being sucked into the swirl.

Again.

The swirl appeared and the Fierce Fire Ape emerged. Zhou Tianlin and the family head of the Ye family could not believe that this pet had really become Qin Duhuang’s!

He spent 59 million and got a pet... at the peak of the ninth rank.

The two of them were envious. They turned to Su Ping, “Mr. Su, I...”

“Mr. Su, how much is the other one?”

The old man standing behind Qin Duhuang hurled out his question faster.

“That one is 65 million,” Su Ping said.

The old man transferred the money without even blinking his eyes. He was quite happy, as a matter of fact.

A noise was heard in the sky, right when he paid the money. Two massive birds flew over. Even while being hundreds of meters in the air, the wind was still strong enough to stir up the dust on the ground.

Two men jumped off from the birds, Mu Beihai and Liu Tianzong.

The two of them saw the two pets as soon as they landed.

They hurried to greet Su Ping. Remembering what he heard from the report, Mu Beihai asked, “Mr. Su, how much?”

Liu Tianzong turned his sight away from the two pets and looked at Su Ping with anticipation.

After all that he did to Su Ping, Liu Tianzong struggled for a bit deciding whether he should go after he received the information, which was why he was late. Once he saw the two beasts with his own eyes, he was sure that both were at the peak of the ninth rank and quite intimidating.

Buying any one of the pets would mean that the Liu family could be saved after giving half of their assets to Su Ping.

As long as he could become more powerful, he could make the money back bit by bit. If what he heard was real, Liu Tianzong decided that he had to fight for a chance!

Su Ping darted them a look as he broke the bad news to them. “You’re too late. The two pets have already been sold.”

“What?”

Liu Tianzong felt he was struck by a bolt from the blue.

Mu Beihai could not believe it, either. He turned to Qin Duhuang and Zhou Tianlin and pulled a long face. “Did you buy them?”

Zhou Tianlin and the family head of the Ye family were not looking happy, either. Not the plural you. It was just Qin, that scheming old punk!

“Well, sorry about that.” Qin Duhuang knew he couldn’t hide such information and he didn’t plan on doing so, to begin with.

Mu Beihai’s face turned black with rage as Qin Duhuang gloated. Mu Beihai was a bit afraid of Qin Duhuang, for starters. Since Qin Duhuang got his hands on a new pet, that would mean the gap between them was even wider.

“Mr. Su, how much did Qin spend? I will give you one more billion!” Mu Beihai said to Su Ping at once.

The onlookers who still lingered for the fun felt they could no longer take the shock. Indeed, they would never understand the big potatoes.
