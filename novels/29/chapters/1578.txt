Chapter 1579: Epilogue: Welcome Back (2)
The Ultimate Heavenly Dao's magnificent body was trembling due to anger. His voice also became scary. "Shut up! Shut up! I'm going to consume you and have you experience the deepest sadness inside my body!"         

    

The Chaos Core suddenly interjected, "You can't do it."     

He moved to stand next to Su Ping. Shooting a cold look at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao, it said, "As I said, if he can make a second choice, I will return to her side."     

The Heavenly Dao said with a frightening tone, "Do you think that going back would change things? I can still restart chaos, even without you. All I have to do is break you!"     

"You can't do it."     

Those same words were now uttered by Su Ping.     

He extended an arm and looked at his nemesis, whose body had already become a twisted, ghastly object. "Haven't you realized it yet? I've experienced all the prayers of the people, everything you have gone through. In other words, I am already the Ultimate Heavenly Dao bearing the prayers of the people. I have everything that you have!     

"What you don't have is now by my side."     

Su Ping added in a soft voice, "I can sympathize with the people's sadness as well as you do. Come on; I will show you the light that the people have never begged for. Only by standing in the light will they stop praying. That part happens to be the most beautiful scenery in the world."     

"This is impossible!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao couldn't accept such an outcome, and resorted to a sudden attack. His willpower surged like a tide, covering Su Ping with ominous shadows.     

Su Ping remained at ease, but his body kept expanding. That was just a manifestation of willpower. He turned into an infinitely massive figure, then grasped the Ultimate Heavenly Dao in one hand.     

He was demonstrating as much power as the Ultimate Heavenly Dao had thus far.     

Meanwhile, the Chaos Qualifications and the Mother of Chaos' body were inside Su Ping. The Chaos Core was also on his side; everything in the world of chaos was concentrated on him.     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was being held tightly by Su Ping, and his power was being constantly dispelled, until he was reduced to a young child, one that shared a striking resemblance with the Chaos Core.     

He felt terrified as he looked at Su Ping, unable to imagine that the latter would be able to master such a terrifying power.     

"Come with me. I will show you the prosperity in this world," said Su Ping softly.     

A magnificent willpower descended with overwhelming pressure. However, no matter how magnificent, it was a benign force. Su Ping was extending a sincere invitation.     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was instantly capable of understanding everything about Su Ping through that incoming surge, including his thoughts when he experienced the people's prayers.     

Hate, fury, grief, pain… Everything he had experienced was also experienced by Su Ping.     

However, right in the midst of those massively negative thoughts, there were faces and figures that glittered every now and then, like brilliant gold.     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was stunned.     

He then realized that Su Ping had not pulled any tricks; he had truly seen and experienced all those lives. However, Su Ping had indeed made another choice.     

So, those things are so fascinating?     

Dazed, the child that the Ultimate Heavenly Dao had become sat in Su Ping's palm.     

That very moment, he knew he had lost. Both his strength and his heart had collapsed, completely.         

    

Even if he wanted to stop it, he couldn't.     

After a long, long time—     Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao raised his tiny hand. The giant hand formerly supporting him was gone. A pair of long and warm arms grabbed him.     

Just then, a contract was established.     

The next moment, a terrifying power exploded inside Su Ping's body, which was also spread out.     

He wasn't surprised, though. He looked at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao with gentle eyes and said, "We'll set off together after we say our goodbyes to them."     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao nodded, showing a troubled face.     

Su Ping smiled and left the Chaos Core.     

Outside—     

The gigantic, crumbling body suddenly froze.     

The cracking stopped, and all the fissures were healing faster than light, recovering in the blink of an eye.     

All of it happened at an extreme speed. The Mother of Chaos, who had been standing like a statue, widened her eyes as if just awakening up from a dream. She felt excited and somewhat uneasy as she perceived the reviving aura inside Su Ping's body.     

"This aura…"     

"Is he back?!"     

Yin Que and the rest of the Sorcerer Ancestors woke up and hurriedly looked at Su Ping's body.     

"He must have been transformed by the Heavenly Dao…" Hei Xiang wore a troubled expression.     

"System…"     

Su Ping looked at the system, who at the moment seemed like a tiny dot from his perspective. He said with a smile, "It's been a long time."     

"It has truly been a… long time." The Mother of Chaos looked at Su Ping in a daze. The hefty worries in her mind were quickly gone when she saw his warm smile. She felt like crying.     

She understood what he had been through. How could Su Ping still treat her that way?     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao had chosen to destroy chaos after all.     

Even so, Su Ping just said that 'it had been a long time'.     

"There's no need to worry. I have subdued the Heavenly Dao," said Su Ping with a smile.     

For reassurance, he even placed the Heavenly Dao on his shoulder.     

Indeed, the Ultimate Heavenly Dao was sitting on one of Su Ping's shoulders, just like a kid. Looking at the Mother of Chaos's stunned expression, he turned his head and snorted. But then, he thought of something and said to her, "Maybe I was wrong. We'll be going together so I can confirm everything. Maybe someday in the future I will return and destroy this chaos!"
