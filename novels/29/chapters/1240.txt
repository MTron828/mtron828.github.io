Chapter 1242 Legacy

Su Ping saw that those Ascendant cultivators weren’t the elites that had gathered in the body’s heart earlier, but another group of middling cultivators; he ignored them and pressed forward.

He saw a lot of fleshly remains and machines on his way. After zigzagging through the channels, he found that he had reached the neck of the body according to the map.

The head was right in front of him.

“Is the ancient corpse reviving?” Su Ping was surprised and confused.

He soon saw his first senior brother and the others. Liu Xia and the other elites were there too, standing in front of a narrow, long channel. In front of them were a group of Ascendant cultivators clad in unusual clothes, including some Heavenly Lords. Su Ping saw that some of them were wearing armor he was familiar with.

It was the same armor worn by Ascendants from the Wolf Fangs, a local organization.

Su Ping solemnly reached the edge of the crowd and asked his senior brother telepathically about the situation.

Although slightly dazed, Song Yuan didn’t turn back. He used his mind perception and noticed Su Ping, then replied telepathically, “Where have you been? I’m glad that you’re safe. This is the ancient corpse’s head. The locals of the Mayhem Star Zone have laid claim to it. The legacy is very likely inside the skull.”

“Did the previous noises come from this place?” asked Su Ping.

“That’s right. There was a sign that the ancient body was reviving. I suspect that someone is trying to inherit the legacy right now,” said Song Yuan solemnly.

Other factions noticed Su Ping’s arrival while they communicated, but nobody was in the mood to talk to him. All of them felt suspicious and wary. Some channels had already been occupied by local forces when they entered the corpse. They were forced to choose alternate directions to avoid conflicts.

Eventually, all of them ended up in the heart.

The heart turned out to be a dangerous trap, not a treasure trove, while the head had been occupied by the locals.

What made them furious was that the seven local forces had become united at that moment. Any team alone was unable to face them.

“You certainly know something. Damn it. How can you criminals possibly keep this?”

“F*ck off, or else we’ll show you no mercy!”

The foreign Ascendants cursed with contorted expressions.

The locals remained vigilant and unprovoked as they heard the curses; some amongst them laughed, while others were indignant.

“The local forces have been in conflict for countless years. There are bloody grudges among them. How can they be so united?” Lian Qi was shocked and suspicious; he couldn’t even imagine seeing the seven hostile forces united in such an unprecedented manner. It was unbelievable.

“Wolf Fangs’ brothers, can you tell me what’s going on inside?” Lian Qi asked them in secret via telepathy.

Those Ascendants—with black tattoos of wolf fangs-glanced at Lian Qi but didn’t reply. One of them said indifferently, “Sorry, there’s nothing we can say. You’d better go back to where you came from. Stop wasting your time here; you won’t get anything.”

Lian Qi was dazed for a moment. His face was pale.

“Stop waiting. Just crush them!”

Someone spoke to all the foreign cultivators telepathically, in an effort to unite the forces of other star zones.

“Yes, let’s do that!” someone gave a positive reply.

“Let’s attack them together! Those bastards don’t deserve the legacy. We’ll show them our fury!”

“With everything coming to this point, let’s finish off the external enemies instead of fighting amongst ourselves,” said the Ascendants from various star zones.

Hai Mei surprisingly chose to propose a truce to Song Yuan. “Let’s take care of those guys first. We’ll settle our score later.”

Since she had announced it in public, Song Yuan said, “No problem.”

Right when they were about to take actionsome noises came from the back of the local cultivators. Then, a sacred light shone, and some people were walking in the light. Once the light faded away, everybody saw that they were priests wearing golden and white clothes.

“The saints?”

Song Yuan could not help but lose his cool at the sight.

He didn’t expect to see the saints from the Planet of Origin inside the body’s skull.

The saints lived in seclusion and rarely showed up in public. His master had told him that those saints also went after the ancient corpse, but he was barely seeing them at the moment, so he forgot about the matter. He didn’t know that they were already there and that they were controlling all access to the skull.

The local cultivators lowered their heads and backed off.

Everybody was shocked by the scene. They suddenly realized why the ever-warring local forces would be as united.

They had already been subdued by the Planet of Origin saints; their conflicts were just an illusion.

Those mysterious people had expanded their influence and secretly controlled the Mayhem Star Zone…

No wonder even characters like the twelve Celestials were quite vigilant of them.

“Guys, we’ve already cleared this place. Please go back.” The head of the saints was a tall and brawny young man with a chiseled face and fair skin. He had no eyebrows, and there was the trace of a vertical silver pattern on his forehead, seemingly the sign of a rare bloodline.

Everybody was shocked and infuriated. Someone couldn’t help but say, “Saints, we’ve all heard that you’re never competitive. Everybody is entitled to a share of this ancient corpse. Isn’t it unreasonable for you to stop us from staking a claim?”

“Exactly. We haven’t seen what’s inside yet, and you want to kick us out just like that?”

The Heavenly Lords weren’t so easily intimidated. Shocked as they might be, they wouldn’t meekly give up the opportunity. “Don’t let greed be your undoing,” warned the saint indifferently.

“The Planet of Origin is conspiring with the criminals of the Mayhem Star Zone. They’re all the offspring of criminals who were banished to this place because of their wrongdoings. You established order in the Federation, and yet you manipulate the criminals in their own den. That’s outrageous!” someone yelled.

“Shut up! Stop calling us criminals! What are we guilty of aside from offending your Celestial backers? Have they never killed innocent lives?” roared a woman who was wearing bloody armor.

“Celestials don’t need to explain what they do to you.”

“That’s hilarious and unreasonable!”

“Everybody, the apocalypse of the universe is coming. We would rather not hurt any of you; please, just leave,” said the saint again, as coldly as before, “Even if you fight, you will only get yourselves killed; you won’t get anything. Our Saint Heir is already in the process of inheriting the legacy. Once the ritual is completed, your offense will only bring disaster to yourselves and your Celestial sponsors!”

Everybody changed their expressions, shocked and infuriated.

There was indeed a legacy there!

Furthermore, the saint was definitely overbearing; he was completely unlike what saints usually acted.

Not only was he threatening them, he was also threatening their Celestial leaders.

Those people represented all the twelve star zones of the universe, so the saint was threatening the strongest people in the universe. What made him act so confidently?

Was it only because of the legacy?

“Guys, we cannot wait any longer. We may be able to disrupt the inheritance if we attack right now. We can fight for it later and see which of us is the lucky one!”

“That’s right! Let’s go! Don’t hesitate!”

All the foreign Ascendants were anxious and angry. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Chunyu, Ji Xueqing and the others looked at their eldest brother, waiting for his reply.

The leaders of other star zones quickly approved the proposal, and so did Song Yuan.

“Stupid!”

The saint seemed to have realized what they were trying to do. He snorted and casually dropped a golden ring, which quickly expanded and blocked the channel. The ring surrounded them, creating an independent world.

“Is this… a Celestial State treasure?”

Someone recognized it and felt shocked. The ring was enhanced by a Dao Glyph that wasn’t being suppressed by the rules of the Mayhem Star Zone. Is it possible to use Celestial power inside the ancestral body?

Someone then launched a fierce attack.

“Die!”

The power of Dao Patterns surged out and slashed the golden ring, but they were like raindrops hitting a rock, unable to cause any damage; the patterns fell apart.

Back at the rear-Su Ping gazed at the people in the ring. The local cultivators and the saints were all calm and expressionless. He vaguely felt that they had other trump cards.

However, there was no reason for him to give up the emperor-level legacy right before his eyes. Even if he didn’t need it, he could still give it to the Little Skeleton or the Void Bug, the latter would then have the ability to command more insects.

Su Ping instantly joined the operation. He was about to attack when special waves started to spread out. A soul power ripple was being produced by the skull, quickly enveloping all the people present and invading their minds. Everyone felt that someone was touching their backs with a pair of cold hands, causing goosebumps.

The soul entity bloodline in Su Ping’s body was instantly activated, tearing apart the invasive soul power and transforming it into nutrition for himself and thus increasing his combat ability.

“The Boundless Realm!” a cold voice resounded. It was the voice of a woman.

Su Ping saw that the channel before his eyes was spinning as the voice echoed, but his immense soul power shattered the soul power the next moment, which stopped the spinning motion.

Song Yuan and the other Ascendants next to Su Ping were gradually twisted and sucked into dark channels above them. In the blink of an eye, Su Ping was the only one left.

“Huh?”

Su Ping was slightly dazed, not expecting to be the only one able to resist the soul power.

All those encircled by the golden ring were also bewildered to see that Su Ping was the only one left when Song Yuan and the others had been ousted.

Even the indifferent saint was rather shocked and confused.

They could all tell that Su Ping was a mere Star Lord.

The shock was moderate, being saints of the Planet of Origin; they knew about that famous genius full well. They knew that even though he was a Star Lord, his combat ability was comparable to that of a Heavenly Lord.

Nevertheless… Why is he still here?

Did the Saint Heir ignore him because of his level?

Su Ping frowned while the onlookers were shocked and suspicious. His eldest brother and the others were swallowed, seemingly having been relocated. He could only rely on himself now.

After thinking for a moment, Su Ping said to the ones remaining, “Get out of my way. I don’t want to kill you.”

Everybody was surprised; they put on weird expressions after hearing that.

This Star Lord told us, a group of Ascendants, that he doesn’t want to kill us?

It had to be noted that a dozen of them were Heavenly Lords, while two were as strong as Song Yuan, not to mention that the five saints of the Planet of Origin were all Heavenly Lords too.

They were so strong that even the elites of all the star zones had to consider their options when they were still present, right when they decided to attack. And yet, Su Ping was bold enough to say such a preposterous thing, even though he was alone. It was hilarious.

“Young man, I’m aware of your potential; however, you’re still too young. Don’t let yourself be blinded by greed. Given your talent, you might become the next Saint Heir if you’re willing to join the Planet of Origin,” said the young saint at the center of the group. His voice wasn’t as cold as before, and was actually gentler. It was obvious that he liked Su Ping for his talent and wanted to rope him in.

“I’m not interested in being a Saint Heir,” said Su Ping with sharp eyes, “I’ve even killed an heir of the gods before. Get out of my way, or don’t blame me for what happens!”

“Hilarious!”

“Is he out of his mind?”

“Should I go out and suppress him?”

The cultivators of the seven local factions chuckled. Someone thought that Su Ping deserved a good lesson.

“What a shame…” The saint heaved a sigh with regret.

Bang!

The next moment, Su Ping launched a fierce attack. There was a boom; the golden ring trembled and hummed. The world inside the golden ring was also shaking and collapsing.

One had to be aware that it was an actual Celestial treasure, and the world inside it was not an Ascendant world, but a small universe with Dao Glyphs.

Such an inner universe wasn’t as sturdy as that of a Celestial, it shouldn’t have been shaken that easily.

The unexpected power of the attack left everyone in shock. All of them shot disbelieving looks at Su Ping.

Given that the attack wasn’t enough to destroy the artifact, Su Ping took a deep breath and flames burned at the corners of his eyes. The young Chaos Beast and the Little Skeleton emerged from the summoning space and stood behind him.

The aura of chaos from the young Chaos Beast left the five saints in a stupor. Their casual demeanor was replaced by shock.

“Merge!”

Su Ping quickly merged with the young Chaos Beast, while the Little Skeleton covered his body too, the bones making him look like a devil.

His height rose to almost ten meters, as he revealed his Primitive Chaos Clan constitution. The terrifying aura of the ancient mythical creature gave all the people inside the ring a fright.

The pressure felt by their blood and souls was intimidating, making them feel as if they were looking up to a colossus.

“Break!!” Su Ping roared, invoking all his power. His thirty-eight Dao Patterns appeared and gathered to form a longsword, which slashed forth as ready to cut the universe in two.
