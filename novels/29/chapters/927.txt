Chapter 930: Six Paths of the External Phase

Bang!

Su Ping simply threw a punch.

A dazzling, golden fist aura was pushed out like a meteorite, along with the power of a hundred perfect laws; even the void seemed to be shaking.

“Die!!”

Diaz punched in kind, not showing any mercy.

His fist was purple and black, seemingly containing a destructive lightning bolt, but there was a strong attractive force in his palm. It collided with Su Ping’s fist aura, causing visible ripples in the air.

Whoosh!

A sword aura dashed out from the fist aura, cutting it apart and slashing towards Diaz.

Diaz narrowed his eyes and quickly raised his hands to launch a purple vortex to fend against the sword aura.

The vortex was cut apart, but the twisting force inside the vortex was able to rip apart the sword aura.

Bang!

Su Ping had already approached Diaz before he could react.

A hundred laws were condensed into a sharp sword in his palm, slashing through the cracked vortex.

The quick attacks were definitely unexpected to Diaz, not thinking that Su Ping would launch that many fatal attacks in quick succession from the very beginning. Still, he was a top genius with abundant battle experience, so he quickly reacted and gathered glittering purple vortices behind his back.

He waved his arms and the void in front of him was twisted, becoming part of the gigantic vortex.

Su Ping’s body was instantly swayed. At the same time, streams of power were attached to him, ready to dissect the energy inside his body.

“Path of the Divine Sword, Heavenly Punishment!”

Su Ping waved the sword and cut straight toward Diaz’s head, ignoring the swaying force.

A hundred sword auras burst out in front of the sword, slashing down at the same time.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Diaz was soon drowned in the storm of sword auras; they were manifestations of laws which carried a truly destructive force. They also contained the power of tribulations, increasing their damage.

“How fast!”

“How relentless, even from the very beginning of the battle. Do they really want to kill each other?”

“He’s unstoppable.”

The clash left all the onlookers dumbfounded; none of them expected the battle to be as breathtaking from the start.

Some geniuses were astonished by the man who was drowned by sword auras. They knew they would have hardly endured that strike.

That meant that Su Ping could instantly defeat them!

Roar!!

A man roared like a crazy beast exactly at that moment, while being under the sword aura bombardment. Then, two vortices that looked like eye sockets appeared, and Diaz emerged absolutely unscathed, except that his clothes were somewhat ragged.

“Are you capable of nothing except being beaten up?” Su Ping withdrew his sword and retreated from the man’s field of reincarnation.

“You’re too hasty. Warm-up is over.” Diaz squeezed his shoulders with a cold smile. “Thank you for helping me stretch my arms.”

Su Ping remained casual and silent, simply attacking again.

“Freeze!”

Diaz raised his hand and then pressed it down, confining space around him. It was a complete path of space!

“Break!”

Su Ping took a deep breath. His sword aura penetrated space without being hindered immediately reaching Diaz.

His eyes glimmered. “Your path of space is flawless too? No wonder you’re so arrogant.”

Pff!

Su Ping cut his chest apart with the sword of laws, but the next moment, he grabbed Su Ping’s wrist and chuckled. “Gotcha.”

Su Ping was unsurprised; he simply stared at him peacefully.

“Have a taste of my sword!”

Diaz’s other hand gathered sword aura and slashed at Su Ping.

But the latter stepped aside and dodged the attack with ease. He looked at his tightly held wrist, and he simply cut his opponent’s healed body apart once again.

Pff!

Whoosh!

Diaz seized Su Ping with one hand and attacked consecutively with the other. He didn’t dodge Su Ping’s attack, and his body was healed again and again after being cut.

It was one of his constitution’s abilities: his body could be constantly renewed.

And yet, all his attacks were dodged by Su Ping with agile moves, even though one of his hands was caught. Diaz was reluctant to cut the arm he was seizing, because Su Ping could break free once he lost his arm. When facing a genius as strong as himself, he could only make the best use of his advantages by restraining the guy in his field. He was confident that he could withstand it until the end.

“Are you capable of nothing except being beaten up?” Su Ping asked again.

Diaz’s face turned cold after he heard that. It was only mockery the first time, but it felt like a slap right in the face the second time. It was true that his attacks had not landed, while he had been hit many times. Su Ping wasn’t causing real damage, but it was still quite upsetting.

“Get lost!”

Diaz couldn’t hold back any longer after missing the target several times. None of his attacks landed a hit, while he was being constantly bashed. This made him look really stupid.

Whoosh!

He slashed at Su Ping’s arm, ready to get back at him.

And yet, Su Ping’s wrist unleashed a horrifying force which knocked away his fingers, breaking free.

“Was that your best?”

Su Ping looked up at him.

He usually didn’t talk that much during battle.

However, Diaz was a special target.

He felt that his victory would be flawed if he didn’t say anything.

Diaz gazed at Su Ping with gloomy eyes and suddenly put on a smile. “You really think I was trying to attack you? Did you not realize that you lost a lot of astral power?”

Su Ping replied with a smile, “Did you steal my energy with your field during your attacks, then use it to heal yourself? So, you didn’t really lose anything in this clash, did you?”

Slightly stunned, Diaz changed his expression and said, “It seems that you’ve investigated my constitution.”

“Do I even need to investigate? It was too obvious. Also, didn’t you realize that I haven’t lost any energy, at all?” Su Ping asked back.

Diaz examined himself and instantly looked awful.

He knew that his plan didn’t work out, given Su Ping’s peaceful attitude.

He didn’t know how Su Ping had done it, but the guy probably had a similar method.

He recalled how Su Ping broke free from his grasp, so he knew that the latter probably let himself be caught on purpose.

A good predator was often disguised as prey to fool their targets.

“It seems that tricks are truly useless.” Diaz looked at Su Ping thoughtfully and calmed down. “There’s no need to mock me. You think I’ll burst into fury? I won’t let anything affect me while I fight. Let’s get serious, now that the warm-up is over.”

“Sure.”

Su Ping nodded.

Their conversation left a lot of the eliminated geniuses dumbfounded and lost for words.

That fierce clash just a moment ago was just a warm-up to them?

They felt that they would’ve already been defeated during the warm-up.

Whoosh!

Diaz took out a long spear. It was exactly the weapon he had used to single handedly fight three top geniuses in the earlier battles.

He looked much stronger than before when he held the spear; he took a deep breath and unleashed his strength with dazzling light in his eyes.

Bam! The void behind him shook. He used the counterforce to instantly charge at Su Ping; there was a great attraction force on his chest and spear tip.

The pull force was a hundred times greater than before. It looted and crunched all the surrounding energy.

The soil and stones on the ground ten thousand meters down below were quaking and rising.

Su Ping stood where he was; golden flames emerged all over his body. He activated the Solar Bulwark, and the aggressiveness of the Astral Painting was added to his astral power. He then stepped up and swung his sword, launching a sword aura able to cut apart the atmosphere!

Bang!!

Diaz’s hair was fluttering. His spear attack met Su Ping’s sword, seemingly holding up the entire sky as he held the spear with one hand.

“Great!” he exclaimed. Then, six dark gray spheres appeared and floated around him; one of them flew closer and swiftly moved towards Su Ping like a sharp needle.

There was a slight change of expression in Su Ping’s face. He detected a horrifying threat from the gray needle, so he spewed a mouthful of flames that could burn anything.

The flames were swept out, but the long needle continued moving through them.

Su Ping was stunned.?Not even the Golden Crow flames work? This had never happened before!

In the palace—a Celestial State remarked in surprise, “It’s the Six Paths of the External Phase!”

Some of the Ascendant State observers were stunned by this, so they became solemn; others shook their heads and sighed, feeling that the battle was already over.

The Six Paths of the External Phase was a method of the Reincarnation Divine Constitution, based on the Grand Reincarnation of the Six Paths!

They could form six flawless paths with the power of reincarnation, which could destroy or swallow anything!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Su Ping snapped one secret technique after the other.

Some were laws of ice, in an attempt to freeze the needle; some were laws of solidity, trying to block it; others were laws of swallowing… However, all of them were penetrated by the gray needle.

Su Ping became solemn; he gathered all the power of laws in his body on a single point and shaped it into a long needle too.

Bang!

The two needles collided. Then, Su Ping’s needle of laws was broken, while the gray needle was deviated, becoming a lot paler.

Diaz raised his eyebrows, but he wasn’t truly surprised; Su Ping would have lost long before if he couldn’t counter that attack.

“You’ve already made use of all your laws. What can you do now?”

Diaz sneered.

The other five spheres around him also turned into needles and moved to stab Su Ping.

The latter narrowed his eyes. A fierce, dark astral power surged out of his body all of a sudden, which had an ink-like appearance. The space around him turned black; all kinds of rays were gone, and even senses were impaired.

“Huh?”

Diaz was stunned for a moment.

But the next moment, he realized that it was Su Ping’s constitution!

Whoosh!

His long needles lost their way in Su Ping’s Field of Darkness. His control over them was also weakened, which shocked him. He had tried very hard to practice that technique, and it was closely related to his constitution. And yet, it was affected by Su Ping?

What kind of field is that?

It was clear that it couldn’t be a simple Field of Darkness.

There was a darkness constitution, which belonged to the demon class.

There was also the dimness constitution, the hellish constitution, and so on.

All those constitutions could form a Field of Darkness to block the opponent’s senses. However, there was something more in Su Ping’s field.

“Come back!”

He could only recall his Six Paths of the External Phase as he was unable to track Su Ping down. He was worried that they might be ruined if they stayed there for long.

“The attack has been countered.”

One of the onlookers was stunned by what he saw, not expecting that Su Ping could deal with the Six Paths of the External Phase with such a move.

In the next moment, everyone saw that the inky field was swiftly expanding. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Diaz quickly moved back, unwilling to step into Su Ping’s field.

However, the field was expanding really fast in his direction. His body was soon touched by the edge of the field; he instantly trembled, since he felt an extreme cold.

He felt that he was touching ice. Very soon, he could see nothing but blackness.

“Break!!”

Diaz didn’t panic. Rather, he was determined to keep fighting.

A competition of constitutions?

I have one of the nine strongest divine constitutions!

It’s one of the best in all the history of the universe!

Only one of the other divine constitutions could compare to his.

However, Su Ping’s field didn’t look like any of the divine constitutions he knew.

Boom!

Vortices appeared around Diaz; he opened the Field of Reincarnation, unleashing a horrifying attraction force that tried to swallow the Field of Darkness.

Alas, he quickly realized that his reincarnation constitution failed to expand any further than several dozen meters from him, as if it were being suppressed!

How is this possible?

Diaz narrowed his eyes in shock.

I’m being subdued and defeated in a competition of constitutions?

Is Su Ping’s field better than mine? Or has he developed it more deeply?

No way!

Diaz found it impossible to accept such a result. He could accept being defeated by Su Ping, but he couldn’t accept that his constitution wasn’t as good as Su Ping’s!

He had the reincarnation constitution, one of the best!

Diaz became thoughtful.?Master said that my constitution hasn’t been fully developed. That must be it. I haven’t gained full control of my constitution yet.
