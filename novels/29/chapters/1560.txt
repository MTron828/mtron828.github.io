Chapter 1561: Merging of the Heavenly Dao (1)
"Yes, I'm done acting."         

    

The wounds on the Mother of Chaos healed quickly. She said with indifference, "Ti Tuo's mission was to lure all of your here, so that I could kill you all at once so you won't cause more trouble!"     

Su Ping had just approached the system to check her wounds. He was briefly dazed, not expecting the betrayal to be an act. No wonder the Golden Crow and the others' reactions were so strange when Kun Peng swallowed Ti Tuo.     

"Humph!"     

Sorcerer Ancestor Xuan Qi snorted, "You are no longer at the peak. It won't be so easy for you to finish us off. By the way, he's about to reach the Chaos Core in the Ancestral Land; once it's broken, chaos will be dissolved and everything will restart!"     

"You can die now, then!" roared the Golden Crow ancestor, suddenly charging towards Xuan Qi like the wind.     

Sorcerer Ancestor Hun Yu said indifferently, "Why bother struggling? There are indeed too many ants roaming in chaos; they would be erased if everything is restarted and a brand-new world of chaos will be created. That will be a good thing."     

"I've been sleeping in the Dao of Death all the time, but what do you even think life is?!" Sorcerer Ancestor Shi Mang suddenly charged forward and turned into a dark blade to attack Hun Yu furiously.     

Bang!     

Hun Yu released its universe, the biggest and hardest compared to those of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors. Shi Mang's full-strength strike didn't break it.     

"You were created by me. I truly don't want to be the one to act and erase you." The Mother of Chaos stared at Hun Yu and Xuan Qi. She raised her hand; even though she said those things, there wasn't a speck of indecision at that moment. Besides, the bond between a mother and a child was unique to some species; there were other kinds whose children would feed on their mother upon birth.     

Some would even eat the children they had just given birth to, seeing it as a natural option.     

The Mother of Chaos didn't harbor much of the expected special feelings. She only felt regretful, as one would feel by needing to destroy fine, personally crafted pieces of art.     

Whoosh!     

The Mother of Chaos waved a hand, and the chaos energy floating in the void was suddenly destroyed. Two terrifying forces akin to huge axes slashed out, making Hun Yu and Xuan Qi change expressions.     

Hun Yu hurriedly moved his universe to block the attack aimed at Xuan Qi.     

The former's universe trembled and almost fell apart.     

Exactly at this moment, the five Chaos Heavens also took action—     

"Judgment!"     

They released the same light of chaos. Wheels of Judgment flew out of their bodies and spun in the sky, moving towards the Mother of Chaos like sharp blades.     

The latter narrowed her eyes, she pointed her finger at the incoming attacks, shooting a black beam that destroyed the balance of one of the wheels.     

She then rushed towards the five Chaos Heavens.     

"I'll leave the other Heavenly Dao forces to you," said the Mother of Chaos.     

Su Ping nodded. "Be careful. I'll lend you a hand in case you need it."     

"There's no need to worry."     

The system's voice was extremely calm.         

    

She was so fast that Su Ping's senses couldn't even follow. She was even faster than Yin Que!     

"What is going on?!"     Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xuan Qi was rather shocked by the sight. It dawned on him. "Damn it, Ti Tuo must've given the Origin Stone to Mother!"     

"You can die knowing the truth now!" bellowed the Golden Crow ancestor. The ever-burning flames released by the latter covered millions of square kilometers and pulled Xuan Qi into its universe.     

"You think you can kill me?!"     

"I survived the previous three wars, while you didn't," said the great crow proudly.     

The taunt worked, as Xuan Qi was furious. Among all Sorcerer Ancestors, its forte was attacking. However, its attack was deflected by the Ultimate Heavenly Dao. On the other hand, it was the weakest when it came to defense and escape. That was why it was eventually suppressed.     

Elsewhere—Ancestors Shi Mang and Yin Que moved towards Hun Yu and attacked the latter's universe.     

Hun Yu was definitely one of the top three Sorcerer Ancestors, and had never lost a duel. It was suppressed by the Heavenly Dao, not because it was weaker than Yin Que and the others, but because it chose to endure all of the Heavenly Dao's attacks for everyone. As a result, it was heavily wounded and captured.     

"Hun Yu, you can still turn around!" shouted Sorcerer Ancestor Shi Mang.     

"My clan is being controlled by the Heavenly Dao. I cannot turn around anymore!" said Hun Yu in a low voice and released its universe, covering Yin Que and Shi Mang, trying to imprison them.     

However, Yin Que was quick to react and dodged the attack. However, Shi Mang was slower and was enshrouded in it.     

"You helped me block the Heavenly Dao's attack back then. I owe you a favor. I hope you won't die before I am able to pay you back!" said Yin Que to Hun Yu.     

"If you want to return the favor, just stay away from this war," said Hun Yu.     

"That's impossible!" declared the former, "The Heavenly Dao is blatant and lawless. I will never let this go. I'm not here for Mother, but for myself!"     

"Let's fight then! The loser will have nothing to say!" said Sorcerer Ancestor Hun Yu.     

Yin Que answered with action, quickly moving to attack and trying to rescue Shi Mang.     

At the same time—     

The Mother of Chaos had already attacked the five Chaos Heavens.     

She was even faster than Yin Que. Nobody was able to capture her trace.     

Her attacks were so powerful that only one move had left a Chaos Heaven heavily wounded one, nearly killing them.     

While clearing the other Heavenly Dao forces, Su Ping noticed that the system seemed to have combined the power of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors. She was the best in terms of offense, speed and defense!     

The five Chaos Heavens were forced to retreat due to the system's attacks. They were completely incapable of defending!     

The power shown by the system not only surprised Su Ping, but also infuriated the five Chaos Heavens. They realized that their enemy had made sufficient preparations and Ti Tuo's betrayal was a trap. They weren't there to surround those remnant nemeses; the remnants were surrounding them!     

Once the remnant forces passed that defense line, the big plan would be ruined.         

    

"Die!!" bellowed one of the Chaos Heavens, as a terrifying aura of chaos was burning all over its body, mixed with some sort of special fire. The fury on its face turned blurry because of the flames. The humanoid also seemed to be calming down, eventually turning into a dazzling ball.     

Whoosh!     

He dashed to another Chaos Heaven and merged with it.     

"They're yours."     

The other three Chaos Heavens acted with solemnity. "Even if it's not possible to stop them, you have to stall them."     

The next moment, those three Chaos Heavens were ablaze. Their faces became numb, and they turned into dazzling light, which surged into the body of the Chaos Heaven at the center.     

The latter's body was undergoing changes. An aura far more powerful was perceived, and its body was even more gigantic, with limbs that were destructive to a terrifying degree. It threw a punch at the Mother of Chaos and actually blocked the sharp blade formed with her Great Dao power.     

The Mother of Chaos slightly changed her expression and said ruthlessly, "I knew you would use this method; you were the inspiration for the contract system I developed."     

Su Ping—who at the time had been dealing with the rest of the enemy forces with the Inferno Dragon—was also keeping an eye on the system. Her answer left him in a daze for a moment; he then looked at the fused Chaos Heavens and understood.     

The contract and the fusion were created based on inspirations from the Heavenly Dao's tactics in the previous wars.     

The Heavenly Dao members can fuse together; if all of them merge… The idea crossed Su Ping's mind.     

He also noticed at the moment that the humanoids being hunted by the Inferno Dragon were gathering in one place, actually giving birth to a Chaos Heaven emitting silver light.     

So this is how Chaos Heavens are created…     

The other Heavenly Dao beings can fuse, too. Is it possible that all of them are actually the same thing?!     

His expression involuntarily reflected the shock upon thinking about this. If all the Heavenly Dao humanoids were the same thing, and were just clones of the original body, how terrifying would the original body be?     

It would even be a hundred times stronger than a Sorcerer Ancestor!     

There must be some sort of restriction preventing all of them from fusing. Otherwise, why would they split up their power? It would be easy to kill all twelve Sorcerer Ancestors with such power, just like squeezing ants to death. This entire world of chaos should have been cleared already! Su Ping thought. He believed that was the reason.     

The Inferno Dragon was already fighting against the newly condensed Chaos Heaven.     

Su Ping chose to let his dragon pet battle it out with the humanoid, seeing that their battle was too shocking. He led the Dark Dragon Hound, the experts from the billions of species, and the just resurrected people to attack the other Heavenly Dao beings, trying to clear the area as quickly as possible; that way they would not condense into another Chaos Heaven.     

To some relief, Su Ping noticed that there seemed to be some sort of requirement set for Heavenly Dao fusions to take place; they couldn't fuse at will. The other humanoids were only jumping and dodging, trying to buy more time. They didn't just merge to fight back.
