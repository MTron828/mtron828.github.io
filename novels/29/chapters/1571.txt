Chapter 1572: Prayer of the People (1)
"Have you reached the limit…?"         

    

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao had an indifferent expression as he looked at the twenty-four Heavenly Palaces that had been breached. "Indeed, you are much better than the previous two puppets. However, you're still just a chess piece."     

"This isn't over!"     

Su Ping's eyes were cold and crazy. An immense aura of chaos surfaced on his body, attracting the power around him at a crazier speed. All the power sent through the contract by all the experts from the cultivation sites and all the species was further condensed on Su Ping.     

They were indeed bound by the contract, but he couldn't mobilize all their power at once, due to the limits of his body.     

However, the limits were broken yet again.     

The three Chaos Qualifications melted inside Su Ping's body, causing a fundamental change. He basically surpassed the Sorcerer Ancestor stratum, reaching a whole new level.     

"Gods, demons, deities…"     

The powers of all species from all cultivation sites were gathering on Su Ping's body. The power infusion seemed to be conscious, amassing unprecedented strength.     

They had previously held on against the Heavenly Dao together, but they failed to forge a true alliance due to clan and family disputes.     

Godly arrogance, the coldness of deities, the cruelty of demons, the deceitful nature of humankind, the beasts' savage ways… Every clan had their own unscrupulous nature and found each other incompatible. Therefore, they were only tools and fuel in the hands of Sorcerer Ancestors, and could only offer their strength passively.     

For the first time, they formed a unified front with Su Ping's willpower as the bridge.     

Powers with all kinds of attributes were concentrated in his person, transforming into chaos power. He was able to absorb the variegated sources at the same time thanks to the three mutating Chaos Qualifications.     

From the weaklings to the Undying State experts.     

The price paid was the Inferno Dragon and the Little Skeleton abandoning their Chaos Qualifications and walking to their deaths!     

Bang!     

The dazzling sword reappeared and continued to slash down from the 24th Heavenly Palace. The Great Daos fused, turning into a Sword of Judgment, and actually sliced all the way to the 28th Heavenly Palace.     

"So close!"     

The Golden Crow ancestor wore a troubled expression; however, he quickly made a decision. Dazzling light flew out of his body, which turned out to be his Chaos Qualification.     

He chose to hand over his own power to Su Ping, abandoning his Sorcerer Ancestor status!     

They were already linked as one through the contract, but it was different when he truly handed over the Chaos Qualification.     

The crow ancestor had been burning his vitality and unleashing the most extreme strength. However, life was boundless for him, as life itself was like an abstract concept for Sorcerer Ancestors. They would only have to rest for a while so they could recover peak status with the help of the Chaos Qualification.     

With that move, he had completely shut his way out.     

He could truly die now!     

"Ancestor!"     

The Golden Crows, including the Chief Elder, all of them cried in shock when they saw this happen.         

    

They could burn their lives and die, but not their ancestor.     

If their ancestor was alive, he could create Golden Crows whenever he wished.     

His action was tantamount to making a crazy bet, staking the future of their entire clan on that young man!     

Su Ping's heart shook upon receiving that Chaos Qualification. It was too shocking. He glanced at the Golden Crow ancestor, only to see a smile.     

Nothing was said, but everything had been said in that exchange.     

Su Ping understood the ancestor's intention. He gritted his teeth and absorbed the Chaos Qualification, melting it with the three Chaos Qualifications already fused in his body.     

His body was emitting a scorching power. Golden flames were burning on his body like feathers, carrying the fury and a ferocity able to annihilate anything.     

Su Ping was able to control more power as the Chaos Qualifications was integrated. There were almost ten advanced cultivation sites.     

"What a lunatic!"     

Yin Que, Shi Mang and the other Sorcerer Ancestors couldn't help but gasp when they saw the crow ancestor's action. He was truly depriving himself of a way out!     

"So brutal," said Shi Mang with a bitter smile.     

The Golden Crow ancestor spoke with eyes like torches, "I only want to see if the sword can cut his head!"     

"I will go with you!" was said, all of a sudden.     

Hao Tian actually gave away his own Chaos Qualification too. He was like a solemn and sacred god, with overflowing aggressiveness in his eyes. "I'm not interested in this boring eternity!"     

Yin Que said with a troubled face, "You've both lost your minds!"     

"Count me in too," said Hei Xiang with a chuckle, "It would be pointless to me if chaos is restarted and it doesn't look like how it is right now."     

The Chaos Qualification emerged from his body and flew towards Su Ping.     Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Two additional Chaos Qualifications, Su Ping now had six of them. His body underwent a strange change and turned infinitely larger. He seemed to have turned from a mythical creature into a vast cluster of mist. No longer a Sorcerer Ancestor, he turned into another kind of being.     

Being in such a state, there was no limitation to Su Ping's body size. He could swallow a grand universe with a thought, or turn into a grain of dust with another.     

As long as he was willing, he could accommodate hundreds of grand universes into his body. His every pore contained boundless space. Each hair could slice the sun and pierce a universe!     

"I was too merciful before!"
