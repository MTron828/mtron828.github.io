Chapter 1474 Strange Disease (1)

After a hum, the white-robed old man trembled, and the madness in his eyes was cleared for a brief moment, although befuddled. He looked up and noticed Su Ping who landed like a god, then asked without much thought, “Who are you?”

“Primordial Empyrean Master!”

A crimson light passed by, and Chi Ying appeared next to Su Ping. He glared at the strongest man from their universe.

They once revered the Primordial Empyrean Master, both for his strength and for his contributions. The man had established a Federation, freeing humans on remote planets from being enslaved by alien races or eaten by beasts.

However, when crisis struck, the reputed expert was the first one to flee. They were all disappointed.

“You’re… Chi Ying?”

Stunned, the old expert recognized Chi Ying. The kid had been stuck in the Celestial State for hundreds of thousands of years, and yet he…

Three beams of light passed by, and the cyborg leaders moved close to Su Ping. Once they noticed the people on the Planet of Origin, they couldn’t help but look at Su Ping “Are they… humans too?”

“Yes, they are the traitors of humankind,” replied Su Ping coldly.

The three leaders exchanged stunned looks, partially understanding the situation. Being leaders of a major race, they knew that there were traitors in every clan, especially when under enormous pressure. “If they’re traitors, just kill them, that way they won’t cause too much noise and alarm the monsters,” said Basha. They had seen a fair share of traitors, but they couldn’t tolerate them.

“You…”

The Primordial Empyrean Master was fully awake now. He looked at the three alien experts, Chi Ying, and Su Ping who seemed to be a leader of sorts. He had never seen Su Ping, and didn’t know when the guy rose to prominence. Is the guy an old monster from some ruins?

The old expert immediately asked, “Chi Ying, you left the universe too? What’s the situation? Are the Heavens still there?”

Chi Ying sneered and replied, “Do you really care about our universe? Didn’t you know what would happen when you led the people in the Planet of Origin away?”

The Empyrean said bitterly, “The Heavens can be dated back to the distant age of chaos, which was a great era we weren’t able to see. Any creature from that era can crush us with ease. However, the Heavens were able to end the chaos era; I had to keep some hope for humanity.”

“By hope, you mean saving yourselves?” Chi Ying sneered. “That’s just a fancy way of saying that you turned tail. None of us were born yesterday. Don’t bother explaining.”

The Primordial Empyrean Master was silent. Indeed. They had all lived for hundreds of thousands of years, and not even kids would fall for that. It was pointless.

He said, “I knew the Heavens had arrived, but I didn’t know how strong they were. I feared they would instantly destroy our universe, so I had to leave with the Planet of Origin right away. I know you can’t forgive me. I wouldn’t forgive myself if I were you.”

“Humph!” Chi Ying sneered.

The old expert looked at him and said, “I didn’t expect you to be the most talented one of the twelve Celestials. Now, you’re also a universe dominator. Are those aliens your friends? The Heavens are our enemies; we shouldn’t fight each other. How about an alliance?”

Chi Ying laughed, but he didn’t decline the offer. He looked at Su Ping.

Although he despised the old man’s actions, he had to admit that the latter was very strong, and they could use all kinds of help to increase their odds of winning against the Heavens. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Didn’t you leave the universe? How did you end up here?” said Su Ping coldly, not bothering to acknowledge the offer.

The Primordial Empyrean Master was slightly surprised. Judging by Chi Ying’s reactions, the young man seemed to be the one who called the shots.

He observed Su Ping carefully, but didn’t find a single trace of the universe dominator realm on him. The young man seemed to merely be a Celestial.

However, he vividly remembered that the guy was the first to arrive and yell at him after tearing an opening through the Planet of Origin’s barrier.

“Who are you?”

“Just answer my questions,” said Su Ping coldly.

The old master was slightly angry, but he didn’t let anything show. He smiled and said, “We did have a pair of coordinates outside of the universe where we could temporarily live. However, something went wrong. We encountered a mutated mythical chaos creature that destroyed our planned destination. We’ve been wandering ever since.”

“A mythical chaos creature?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows. “Are there mythical chaos creatures in the Realm of the Heavens?”

“Yes, but their population is not large,” said the old man, “According to the records, when the age of chaos collapsed, many mythical creatures scattered about and escaped. Some of them simply wandered beyond the universe. However, the places beyond the universe are boundless; it’s hardly possible to run into them. We were simply too unlucky…”

He couldn’t help but sigh as he recalled the situation.

“Why were you yelling just now?” Su Ping asked.

The Primordial Empyrean Master was stunned for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, “I was affected while I fought the mythical chaos beast. The diseased has been haunting me since then.”

“The disease makes you scream loudly?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows.
