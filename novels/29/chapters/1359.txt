Chapter 1360 Personality Fashioning (1)

“What’s this?”

Kayafollet’s heart felt tight; Su Ping’s bluntness belied an absolute confidence. With everything coming to that point, she would rather not wait and die, even though she knew she couldn’t beat him.

While talking-she suddenly attacked. A terrifying aura burst out; a silver pattern appeared on her forehead as she punched Su Ping fiercely.

There was a bam; Su Ping countered her palm as if knowing she would try a sneak attack, collapsing all the energy concentrated in her palm. Then, he raised his hand and pressed the curse onto her head.

“Be quiet.” Su Ping’s voice was steady and indifferent.

Kayafollet said angrily, “You’re despicable!”

“I defeated you fair and square. How is that despicable?” Su Ping asked back, while sending the curse’s power into her consciousness.

Kayafollet instantly felt that a dark power was invading her brain. She instantly activated a secret technique in an attempt to disperse the power; however, she felt like a drunkard the moment she thought of that.

Infinite information surged into her head; countless pictures and episodes appeared. They were such a mess that she felt her brain was being corrupted.

Soon after she discovered that her mind was frozen; she actually couldn’t feel her body anymore. The dark aura quickly faded away, leaving nothing but darkness and silence around her.

She tried again, quickly performing a soul technique, only to discover that she couldn’t feel any power. Her heart instantly sank; she knew that she had probably been struck.

“Bastard, let me out!” Kayafollet roared furiously.

There was no response from the silent darkness, not even a single echo.

After cursing for a while, she even felt more panicked and sorrowful than before. She had just inherited the universe dominator’s legacy and had yet to grow, and she was already enslaved. It was humiliating!

.....

“Let me out! I’m willing to submit to you!” Kayafollet gnashed her teeth.

“I’m begging you!”

In the quiet darkness-a beam of light appeared out of nowhere.

The light gradually formed a vortex, which looked like a channel to the outside world. However, Kayafollet couldn’t sense any way out; she only saw Su Ping through the hole. “Only because you’re begging me, I’ll give you a chance. Even if you suddenly die someday, you should know why.” What Su Ping said chilled her to the bone.

Soon after, Kayafollet found that the darkness around her was gone. Not only could she see Su Ping, but she could also see the environment and… herself.

It was like observing herself as a third party.

She then found that her face was absolutely numb.

While observing with shock and suspicion, she regained her expression and her eyes were shining again. It was as if an empty shell had been filled with a soul. “Master!”

The next moment, Kayafollet felt frightened. She saw as her body flashed a sweet smile and bowed at Su Ping, then she spoke in the most obedient manner.

“W-What did you do to my body?” Kayafollet said with a mix of anger and fear.

Su Ping didn’t move his mouth, but his voice echoed in her years. “Nothing. I simply isolated your consciousness and built another soul based on your memories, which I edited a little bit. It seems to be working well.”

“Y-Y-You’re the devil!” Kayafollet was shocked and infuriated. She didn’t know how to describe that young man. He was like a devil straight from hell.

“If it’s impossible to save the world by acting as a god, I must carry out the executions as the devil.” Su Ping’s voice echoed in her mind, then she saw him smile.

“You cannot do this…” Kayafollet roared furiously.

But Su Ping’s voice wasn’t heard again. Back in the pet room-Su Ping looked at the absolutely obedient Kayafollet, and felt more or less regretful. Although he had made an altered copy of her soul and controlled her, he didn’t acquire the memory of Kayafollet’s legacy; otherwise, there would be a chance that the personality he developed could inherit the legacy and become a God Warrior some day.

The War Emperor’s legacy will probably be lost. What a shame. His dead body retained his fighting will; that’s why it mauled that alien. It might not even be a coincidence that the body was floating near the crack. It’s possible that the body noticed the crack and moved there to block it…

Unbelievable as it might sound, Su Ping thought that was the most likely reason.

It was hard to imagine what a great and stubborn hero the War Emperor was when he was alive.

It wasn’t the first of such men that Su Ping had seen. The Twilight Deity King, Green Lady’s master, was the same. Even though he died, he blocked a hole using his own body. Back then, Su Ping was too weak to see what was in the hole; no one knew if it was the deeper universe, or a crack to another world. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Either way, that kind of stubbornness suggested how fierce the great war that once broke out had been.

While focusing his attention, Su Ping said to the respectful Kayafollet, “You’ll follow my master for the next couple of days and do whatever he asks.”

“Yes, master,” said Kayafollet obediently.

Then, she said goodbye to him and went to Shen Huang’s building.

Su Ping simply talked to his master telepathically, letting him know of the situation: that Kayafollet had been enslaved by him and he could freely order her about.
