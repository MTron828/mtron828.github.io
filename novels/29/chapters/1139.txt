Chapter 1140 Suppression

“So, you’ve been making preparations.” The old man realized what Su Ping was up to; he had been conspiring with the cauldron woman without letting anyone else know.

He had probably made such an arrangement to fend against him.

However, what puzzled him was Su Ping’s candid acceptance.

He would have remained ignorant and could have fallen for the trap if Su Ping hadn’t said anything

Was it because he thought it was unnecessary to hide anymore, now that his master was with him?

“Don’t you know that working with devils will have unexpected consequences? Young man, you’re too careless,” said the old man.

The cauldron woman sneered. “I’m more trustworthy than you.”

“Since you’re free, our deal is over; your master mentioned that Old Monster Ye is coming here. I’m leaving.”

The old man wasn’t interested in talking to the woman anymore, and wanted to straight out leave. The store gave him an extremely creepy vibe; he had been uncomfortable ever since he entered.

The cauldron woman nodded. “That’s right. I promised I would ensure your safety. Since this guy is not hostile, I thank you for your help and bid you goodbye. Until next time. Haha; I doubt we’ll ever meet again. Hahaha…”

She turned around and walked out after saying that. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Su Ping smiled and shut the door with a thought.

“It’s too late to leave now, guys.”

“Huh?”

The old man stopped with a cold expression. “Young man, what do you want?”

“I risked my life on the way over; I cannot let you walk away just like this. Besides, considering your personality, you’ll be a hazard if you leave; it’ll be better if you just stay here under my supervision.” Su Ping chuckled. He finally shed all pretense.

“Why? You think your master alone is capable of holding us back?” The cauldron woman turned around and narrowed her eyes.

She and the old man were not hostile towards each other anymore; they seemed to be on the same side.

Shen Huang: “???”

The latter felt innocent when comparing with their hostility and brutality. I haven’t done anything yet. Why did they mention me?

Su Ping fanned the flames before he could enter a word edgewise. “Master, I think they’re looking down on you.”

Shen Huang glanced at Su Ping, lost for words. Are you expecting me to clean up the mess you caused?

However, one responsibility of a master was to clean up their disciple’s messes.

He asked, “Who are those two people? Both of them seem to have Celestial power.”

“One of them is a wicked cauldron that slaughters people, and the other is an evil sutra that was a bad influence to a kid,” said Su Ping, not explaining their functions in detail.

Naturally, Shen Huang knew they weren’t as simple as that; he was rendered speechless again by Su Ping’s concise explanation.

The cauldron woman was stunned for a moment, but then burst into laughter. She turned around and said to the old man, “See? He says you were a bad influence for a kid! Haha. Old Monster Ye would be infuriated to death again if he ever heard that someone was calling him a kid!”

The old man gloomily said, “Spare me your sharp words. Kid, you’re not just relying on your master, right? You’re also counting on the being hiding in this store, right? Why don’t you ask them to come here and meet

us?”

The cauldron woman stopped laughing, and also looked around.

They certainly knew that Su Ping wasn’t acting boldly just because of his master, or he wouldn’t have been as cautious on his way there. Furthermore, they knew that Su Ping was acting vigilantly before his master in a way. However, the latter seemed to have dropped all wariness ever since he got there.

He seemed confident even after dropping all pretense.

Shen Huang was quite curious about the person backing Su Ping, since he had never been able to see through. Seeing no response, he asked Su Ping, “Disciple, where is the being who severed your river of fate?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He had learned about some of the Celestial methods when he experienced the Celestial State power, such as cutting off one’s fate to release oneself from destiny. The system had probably changed his fate when it was bound to him.

“They aren’t qualified to meet him,” said Su Ping.

Even though the system hadn’t shown its power often, Su Ping knew it well enough; those two were truly unqualified to meet him.

The system was at least an Ancestral God, if not something even more powerful.

“…” Shen Huang was lost for words.

In fact, I want to meet him too!

However, he found it embarrassing to ask again because Su Ping had already put it that way.

“Brat, you’re being too cocky,” said the cauldron woman with a frown. “Even though I approve of your previous behavior, I should kill you a hundred times over for your rudeness!”

Su Ping smiled and ignored what she said, then spoke to Golden Lotus, “Miss Pan, I told you that I had a pill friend; I suggest that you stop following this demonic sutra. Ask your pill friends to stay in this store; this will be your shelter.”

Golden Lotus was in a daze; she couldn’t help but look at the old man. “Well…”

She was more convinced of Su Ping’s claims after seeing Green Lady.

Green Lady and Joanna also realized what was happening. Green Lady was slightly awkward, but Joanna behaved normally; she had been bold enough to challenge the Superior Gods, back in the Demigod Burial. She wasn’t afraid of mere Deity Kings; besides, she had seen the power of Su Ping’s store.

Nobody could act freely while being inside.

“You didn’t get the legacy?” asked Joanna.

Su Ping shook his head. “It was a trap, and I nearly got killed. I couldn’t have made it back without them.”

“A trap? You nearly got killed?” Joanna was dazed. Su Ping was invincible in the cultivation sites and was able to resurrect; his life was never at risk. Was the legacy even more dangerous than the trip to the Archean Divinity?

She became cold; while looking at Shen Huang, she demanded, “Aren’t you his master? Why didn’t you foresee the danger? Are all the human Celestials as useless as

you?”

Shen Huang: “?”

Who is this audacious girl?

He was rather stunned. He had seen his share of arrogant Heavenly Lords given his status, but none of them had dared to act that way in front of him, let alone yelling to his face.

“That’s right. You’re the boss’ master and a Celestial State expert. How can you let our boss be caught in danger?” Tang Ruyan hopped out and clenched her fists in fury.

Shen Huang fell silent. “Good thing our boss is fine. Otherwise, I would certainly go after you one I make a breakthrough!” said Joanna with a snort.

Tang Ruyan, on the other hand, rushed to where Su Ping was and examined him for wounds.

Su Ping didn’t expect them to be as bold or excited because of him. He coughed and said, “I almost got killed, but I pulled through. I’m back safe and sound, aren’t I?”.

“If you hadn’t… Humph!” Joanna snorted and walked away with arms crossed.

Tang Ruyan said angrily, “What if you were indeed killed?”

Su Ping rubbed her head and looked at Shen Huang. “Master, please don’t mind them. They’re only concerned for my well being.”

“Hehe.”

Shen Huang’s lips twitched.

The old man and the woman were rather astounded too. Su Ping’s master was a Deity King anyway; and yet, the two girls had yelled at him. One of the girls was terribly weak even; who gave her the guts to scold him?

“What a bunch of weird people,” mumbled the cauldron woman. Then, she said to Su Ping, “Kid, I don’t have time for you. Show me what you’ve got, or I’ll just raze your store to the ground; your master won’t be enough to hold me back.”

Su Ping said, “I went through so much trouble to bring you to safety. You’re my trophies; how can I let you get away?”

“You consider us trophies?”

The cauldron woman flew into a fit of rage.

The old man also had a cold expression.

“You are a cauldron and a sutra. What are you if not trophies?”

“You’re asking to be killed!”

The cauldron woman threw a punch at Su Ping from a distance.

Shen Huang raised his eyebrows; he certainly couldn’t let Su Ping die in front of him. He was about to take action, but then a magnificent power emerged out of nowhere. The cauldron woman’s attack was dispelled; after that, she shivered and fell to her knees, as if she were carrying a mountain on her back.

“Huh?”

The unexpected turn of events made both Shen Huang and the old man change their expressions; both anticipated that Su Ping had made preparations. However, such preparations were rather terrifying.

“W-What’s this…” The cauldron woman was astounded and pale-faced. The store disappeared from her sight, and found herself in the middle of a dark void; she couldn’t see anything. However, something was stinging her back, like a heavy stare looking down upon her from high above.

She was as insignificant as an ant at that moment.

The feeling reminded her of the days when she was being forged.

She had been absolutely helpless back then; she was as vulnerable as a thread of silk.
