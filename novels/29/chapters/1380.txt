Chapter 1381: Running (2)

Most of his local friends and acquaintances were Star State warriors or Star Lords. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Having no time for niceties, Su Ping simply placed them in his universe.

They were helpless as he absorbed them with divine power; they were relocated without control or a chance to resist!

The formerly prosperous Blue Planet was soon emptied; all the travelers and locals were moved away.

He then moved on to the next planet and repeated the procedure.

At the same time—the seven members of the Heavens floating in the void examined the battle traces and their deceased ally. Their roars—which sounded like whispers of ancient gods—echoed in space, vibrating in the consciousness of every living creature in that universe. Myriads of ordinary people fell to their knees and trembled.

The voices and thoughts made them feel anxious and scared, as if they were digging deep into their bones.

Su Ping slightly changed his expression and stopped all of a sudden. He sensed that the aliens were searching for the power that was able to eliminate their kin.

“Damn it!”

Su Ping looked at the planets ahead of him, knowing that there was no time to relocate those people. Leaving would mean abandoning those people to face a desperate fate.

However, Su Ping had to leave immediately to avoid being caught.

Whoosh!

Su Ping returned to Rhea. As he made his way back, he sent telepathic messages to other Celestials and asked them to return as soon as possible. Those alien creatures were very likely about to attack.

......

The universe would instantly fall if seven beings on par with top God Emperors attacked at the same time!

Such power could overturn the entire universe!

The Empyrean Master from the Planet of Origin was probably a universe dominator, and he reigned over the Federation for hundreds of thousands of years; what could one expect of seven top God Emperors?

The contacted Celestials no longer dared to linger. Some of them had yet to relocate all of their subordinates, they had to brace themselves and make the painful choice of abandoning the rest.

If possible, they would certainly take them all away, but the conditions didn’t allow it.

Su Ping appeared in his store directly. The attacks of the Heavens would soon strike that planet; he didn’t feel safe, even if he stood on the streets. One had to consider that a millisecond was an extremely long time for a universe dominator; time and space were meaningless and could be extended. He only felt safe when he reached the store’s territory.

Very soon, the Dark Dragon Hound and the other pets were remotely summoned back by Su Ping through the contract.

He could summon them remotely if they were in the same star zone and weren’t under attack.

The other Celestials arrived at that moment. They entered Su Ping’s store with tightened bodies.

Shen Huang returned, grave-faced.”I’ll ask the remaining soldiers to initiate the self-destructing sequence. Hopefully, they’ll buy more time for us.”

He had already asked the remaining troops on the fourth and fifth defense lines to attack the aliens. The strategy wasn’t meant to deter the invaders, but to merely distract them while the Celestials and the Fire Seeds made their getaway.

“We asked the weaklings to protect us. How disgraceful…” One of the Celestials looked bitter, knowing the arrangement was inevitable. They would burn their lives and fight; reality was too cruel.

“We’re leaving right now?” asked one of the Celestials in earnest, hoping to flee from that dangerous place as soon as possible.

“At least 80% of people are staying. Will they hate us?” Xu Kong returned with unwillingness in her eyes.

Everybody looked grave. Su Ping was going to say something, but he detected something and his expression changed.

Boom~!

In space—a series of planets began to shatter!

Planets were falling apart; atmospheres were torn; substances were splattering in the vacuum. Even the ordinary people could hear the noise!

It was as if the entire universe were quaking!

Everyone stopped talking and widened their eyes. The most dazzling and terrifying scene was happening; all the planets they could see were exploding like fireworks.

The most horrifying power was swept out; none of those planets could resist. Without a doubt, all the people found on those planets, be they billionaires or civilians, were crushed to smithereens.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, losing his cool for a moment. Then, he reacted and quickly sent his power underneath the store, covering half of the continent and narrowing it into a glimmer of light, darting in a certain direction.

The power and waves of the Heavens were already radiating everywhere; Su Ping only hoped to avoid their detection.

However, the waves were moving very fast and glowed like sunlight; even though Su Ping was fleeing at full speed, he could still feel their effect. He secretly cried and quickly changed their appearance; by twisting laws, the narrowed continent and store turned into a rock, making it look like a flying meteor roaming the universe.

Even the speed had been instantly lowered by Su Ping and moved to hide among other rocks.

Inside the store—the Celestials noticed Su Ping’s disguise; they all held their breaths nervously.

Once detected, it would be impossible to escape.

None of them dared to extend their perception too far, and merely prayed in silence. Even if they were lofty Celestials, they were completely in the hands of fate.

Once the waves passed them by, Su Ping sped up and dove into deep spaces to flee as fast as he could.

The probing waves of the Heavens still existed in the deeper spaces, reaching all the way into the ninth space.

Su Ping quickly found a group of Void Beasts in the eighth space. Feeling delighted, he quickly inserted his store and the narrowed continent into one of the Void Beasts. Then, he controlled the Void Beast to stray and fly away from the swarm to move in a different direction.

Soon after moving away, the group of Void Beasts behind him exploded all of a sudden.

Su Ping saw infinite blood and flesh splattering. His face was cold.

The Heavens were attacking indiscriminately, not even sparing the lives in deeper spaces.

He instantly leaped into the ninth space and saw fresh bodies again, which was also the doing of those alien creatures.

Shen Huang said gravely at that moment, “Three Fire Seeds have been destroyed.”

The others look at the latter, who gloomily added, “The signals received suggest that three Fire Seeds were destroyed.”

Everybody was silent.

They couldn’t imagine what a hellish view it was outside.

If they couldn’t escape, they would probably be buried in that place too.

“Why did we encounter those things? Damn it!” said one of them with clenching fists.

Everyone was feeling rather pessimistic; they could only place their hopes on Su Ping.

The latter was wholeheartedly controlling the shrunken-continent, piloting the Void Beast to move in the deep spaces.

He soon found a place full of ancient corpses.

“This is…”

Su Ping felt slightly dazed. The place seemed to be an ancient battlefield. Many incomplete bodies were floating about, emitting strange yet horrifying auras, sharing some similarities with the War Emperor’s body found near the crack in the universe.

After a quick count, he noticed that there were more than thirty!

“All of them were universe dominators when alive…” Su Ping felt a chill.?What happened to this universe in the past? Why are there so many remains of universe dominators?

Is it because they fought the Heavens too?

Su Ping had no time to think. He passed the area with corpses, which contained a lot of weapons and armor; they were clearly ultimate treasures as they had yet to decay, but Su Ping wasn’t affected by greed.

The other Celestials also took note of the scene. They were in shock.

One of them whispered, “There are indeed too many secrets that even we don’t know about this universe…” They had explored many Mysterious Realms and labeled some of them as forbidden lands. Not even experts like them would act unrestrained when moving in the ninth space.
