Chapter 1465 Upper Limit of the Cultivation Method (2)

“The upper limit of this cultivation method is too high!”

“Even the ancient chaos entities couldn’t be much stronger than them, could they?”

“That’s not necessarily true. They could be stronger than the mythical creatures.”

“Do you think humans could contract mythical creatures as pets?”

After days of friendly bouts, the cyborgs were more and more curious about the human cultivation method, since they found it mysterious and terrifying. The upper limit achievable was also unimaginably high.

Furthermore, a horrifying speculation emerged. Could humans only establish contracts with beasts?

Or, could they bond with any living creature?

Their thoughts went wild. If truly feasible, could humans bond them, too?

Many cyborgs felt ill at ease, and considered their human allies a huge threat.

The second Ascendant cultivator went up and easily won with seven Ascendant pets.

The cyborgs suffered consecutive failures as cultivators went up one after another, and only got two points in the end.

The gap was so huge that all the audience fell silent.

They had won 39 points in the Star State category. The higher the level, the fewer points they got. Would they lose completely in the 3 against 3 Celestial-level battles?

The very notion haunted the cyborgs’ minds. Those who didn’t participate were having certain thoughts too…

Without pets, they didn’t think they would have been any weaker than their human counterparts in the friendly contest. If they had the cultivation method, wouldn’t they be able to crush their opponents?

After a few days of rest, the Celestial State battles began.

The battlefield was a special small universe built by the cyborg leaders, enough for the Celestials to fight freely.

Shen Huang, Chi Huo and Xu Kong fought as representatives. They crushed their opponents without giving the cyborgs any hope.

The host humanoids fell silent after such a crushing defeat.

They had picked excellent and renowned experts; they didn’t expect such a fiasco!

Shen Huang was the last one to leave the battlefield after the battles ended. He dismissed his pets with a relaxing smile; there wasn’t even a drop of sweat on him. He wasn’t wearing battle armor, but the golden robe he usually wore. Nothing implied that he had just taken part in a great battle. His opponent, on the other hand, seemed to have been struck by lightning. It was quite embarrassing.

Shen Huang didn’t leave the battlefield after the disgruntled referee announced the result. Instead, he stood in the small universe and, facing cameras in various directions, looked at Basha and the others who were seated in a corner. He said with a smile, “Thank you for your participation in the friendly contest. Now that it’s over, there’s something we’d like to propose.”

“What do you want?”

Basha looked awful. Do the humans despise us after such a complete victory?

“Our leader visited a Selvega of your clan and struck an alliance with them. We believe that, as compatriots, you don’t mean us any harm. Besides, we have a common foe to fight against.”

Shen Huang paused for a moment and then continued with a smile, “If you want, we’re willing to share our cultivation method with you for free.”

After a boom, all the cyborgs in the green glass planet exploded.

All the locals who watched via live stream were stunned after reading the captions translating Shen Huang’s message in their language.

They were willing to share?

For free?

Are humans crazy? That’s the fundamental technique of their clan!

Basha and the other leaders were also stunned; they remained silent in their seats for a long time until they recovered. But instead of being overjoyed, they considered Shen Huang’s motive.

“Why?” asked Basha, while staring at Shen Huang in the eye, even revealing the aura of a dominator as she spoke.

“Because we’re allies, are we not?” Chi Ying, who was seated in a chair close by, also emitting a hint of dominator’s aura, while he tilted his head and spoke with a smile.

Basha sensed his powerful aura. Based on what she saw in their contest, the stronger a human was, the more contracted beasts they had. Therefore, the guy next to her could very well have ten contracted beasts at his level!

Basha and the others changed their expressions upon such a thought.

With such a combat ability boost, the three of them together were probably no match for the guy next to them.

Not to mention that there was still Su Ping backing them.

Behind that public leader, there was also the real leader who actually met the Selvegas of their clan… The three cyborgs felt alarmed.

Without a doubt, humans were on par with them. Their chances of winning were unclear if their cooperation ended on bad terms.

The fact dawned on them, and they became much gentler than before, quietly dismissing the dominator auras.

“That’s right. Because we’re allies,” said Shen Huang, “Besides, we won’t lose this technique after teaching it to you. It would only make our alliance stronger, which is a good thing.”

“Is this what humans think?” Basha mumbled. She couldn’t tell whether or not Shen Huang was lying. If true, then she had nothing to say and would only feel admiration for this clan. If it was fake, then what was the scheme?

Is the cultivation method actually flawed?

However, do they really think that all cyborgs would learn the technique because it was taught for free?

The leaders would surely study and experiment first before promoting the technique.

They would eventually discover if the technique had hidden flaws that would harm cyborgs…

The last thought made Basha put on a smile and stand up. She looked at Shen Huang with a pondering demeanor, then said, “I appreciate your generosity very much. As allies, do you need us to do anything in return?”

“You’ve already repaid us by providing us a place to live in. We’re very grateful,” said Shen Huang with a smile.

“That’s just a small place for temporary residence.” Basha shook her head.

Shen Huang didn’t propose any requests. He had hoped to establish a real friendly relation with the cyborgs through the friendly contest, so what he said was mostly true.

However, there were certain truths in that world that had to be told in a tactful manner in order for them to be heard and believed!

After the matter was settled, all the cyborgs were thrilled.

“This is unbelievable. Humans are publicizing such a powerful technique for free!”

“Just because we’re allies? Is this some sort of scheme?”

“Don’t bother. We’ll know the details of their cultivation technique very soon.”

“I admit it was premature of me to say what I did. I’ll beat anyone who says that this battle method is unscrupulous!”

“What’s unscrupulous? Isn’t battle always about outnumbering your enemies?”

“That’s true. Duels are just obsolete.”

The gloomy clouds enshrouded the humanoids were halfway gone.

Some of them, however, thought that humans were up to no good.

Shen Huang didn’t let the cyborgs wait for too long. He shared the technique with the three leaders and asked them to promote it.

Shen Huang knew that they would experiment on it first, but he didn’t point it out.

Once they learned the technique, Basha and the others wasted no time trying it. They also sent a lot of envoys to the Nine States. Some actually captured humans of different levels in secret and took them back.

Basha read the memories of those humans and used them to cross-check with the cultivation technique. She found that it wasn’t incomplete, and she also learned a lot more about the human clan.

“I didn’t know that Mr. Su, the human leader, is actually a young man who rose to prominence recently.” Basha and the others were surprised. Then, they thought of the real leader behind Su Ping who met the Selvegas. They knew that he couldn’t have grown to become so strong without a real expert’s teaching

The memories also helped them confirm that they had no evil intentions. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Therefore, Basha had those human beings sent back in secret once they drew the information.
