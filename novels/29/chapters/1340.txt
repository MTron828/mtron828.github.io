Chapter 1341 Understanding (2)

Su Ping entered cities and towns like a normal traveler with the money he received from the Heaven Path Institute.

He passed through swamps and deserts, encountering beasts and desolate woods.

He also met some of the local adventurers.

It was the first time for him to truly sense the uniqueness of the Archean Divinity ever since he went to that world.

When he turned into a middle-ranked god, he discovered that most gods were friendly to him, all their arrogance and prejudice gone.

After he traveled for a few days and turned into a high-ranked god, not only was their arrogance gone, he even saw modesty and respect in them.

They call themselves gods, and they’re omnipotent to humans; but the fact is, they’re just relatively stronger beings. Gods and deities are all like this. Is there truly an emotionless and unbiased existence keeping order?

Su Ping fell silent.

You would have to be devoid of all emotion in order to be absolutely fair.

Emotions were the opposite of rationality, which demanded indifference and objectiveness.

If I abandon my emotions, will I be able to transcend and become a real dominator?

The idea occurred to Su Ping. Deep in his heart, his rationality told him it was a feasible approach.

......

Furthermore, it seemed to be a road that led to some ultimate height.

However, he dropped the idea when he remembered the Little Skeleton and then saw the Inferno Dragon, the Purple Python and the Dark Dragon Hound near him.

In the world that the Golden Crows’ ancestors saw, lives were made of grains of sand that bumped into each other. Are they really alive?

Or maybe, are lives what accommodate thoughts and ideas?

The shadows that were deep in the universe… The floating Great Dao… They all seemed alive. It’s just that their life forms were absolutely incomprehensible to us.

One must cultivate by imitating nature. Since ancient times, humans have gained strength by observing and copying nature; nature and the universe are the best teachers…

Lightning gave us fire; it’s a gift from nature. We make tools by learning from nature; flowers, grass and trees have their unique ways of living that we can learn from.

How does rain fall? How do flowers blossom? Everything contains the Great Dao…

“Everything contains the Great Dao…” Su Ping mumbled. A sentence suddenly occurred to him,

Everything could be trained! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

That was what the system said.

So… the Great Dao can be trained too?

Su Ping’s eyes widened at the thought, and countless others rolled dazzlingly in his mind. The question that had been puzzling him seemed to have found an answer, and he was ready to grasp it.

If everything can be trained, the Great Dao can also be trained… Then, what kind of existence can nurture the Great Dao?

Su Ping’s mind shook. He had a vague trace of the direction to find his Dao Heart.

What he didn’t expect was that the key to the question was actually something the system had said to him a long time before.

Everything could be trained.

Su Ping had always thought that the system was just being snobbish when it said that. However, it seemed that those words contained an ultimate secret.

Su Ping couldn’t help but smile. He had found a direction for his Dao Heart.

“Brother Su, why are you smiling?” a pleasant voice floated over.

Su Ping turned around and saw a beautiful girl staring at him curiously inside the carriage. The girl’s brother, sitting next to her, was brawny and handsome; he was also looking at Su Ping in surprise.

The latter withdrew his gaze from the window. He was in such a great mood that he smiled again and said, “I just thought of something delightful.”

“What is it?” asked the girl curiously.

The siblings were part of a cross-continent trade group that Su Ping had met two days earlier. They were shipping a batch of resources to the neighboring continent. Aside from resources, they had extra space for gods who intended to smuggle items. They usually charged higher prices than cross-continent teleportation arrays for such a service. Most of the people who hired them for such things had their own problems. Some were even of the criminal sort. “Val, watch it,” immediately said her brother. Most people who hired them carried secrets. Even if they weren’t criminals, they might have secretly escaped from their homes. Most teleportation arrays had records, and they could get caught if they chose to teleport.

The girl stuck out her tongue and gave Su Ping a cute smile.

She looked like a teenager, but she was actually thousands of years old and had already reached the Ascendant State. She was one of the stronger guards of the trade group.

After all, the higher-tiered God Kings were well respected on every continent. They could hardly be seen on adventuring or trade groups. Even when they did show up, they would always become the center of attention.

Su Ping smiled, not feeling bothered by the questioning. He sat up straight on his seat, now in a good mood after having found the key to the question in his heart. Although he couldn’t condense a Dao Heart immediately, at least he knew where to start. All he needed was an opportunity to condense the Dao Heart.

He had seen all sorts of gods and plenty of beautiful, miserable and even cruel scenes during his trip. All of it served as nourishment for his soul.

“I’m leaving,” said Su Ping, as he was now ready to leave for the Red Dome Realm at a moments’ notice.

The destination of that caravan was too far away from the Red Dome Realm. There was no need for Su Ping to take a detour anymore. He would ask for more Heavenly Fire from the Red Dome Realm and then return to his store.

“You’re leaving?”

Stunned, the girl quickly said, “But we haven’t arrived yet. We’re in the static void between continents; it’s very dangerous outside. We…”

Before she finished the carriage stopped all of a sudden.

There were three dragons blocking their path, with crimson scales from head to toe. There were thousands of people with them, and more than thirty carriages, all hauled by the same dragons. Those beasts were in the Ascendant State; they too could be useful in battle.

“What is going on?”

The young man inside the carriage slightly changed his expression and spread his senses. The next moment, he revealed his aura and said in a low voice, “Val, come with me.”

The girl also realized that something was wrong. She said to Su Ping, “Just stay here, we’ll be right back. There might be a problem, but don’t worry; we’ll take care of it.”

Su Ping didn’t respond, and simply spread his senses. At this moment, the carriages were traveling in a channel through the void. Said channel was established between two continents; outside the channel was a static void that contained illusory and blinding power. It was also home to the Void Beasts that everybody was scared of.

Void Beasts could weaken their godly power and were deemed as banes to all gods. Such channels were usually established by God Emperors through the Original Dao World. They were considered safe areas.

A spaceship was currently in the way of the carriages. The spaceship had forcefully squeezed into the channel; there were a dozen people inside the vessel communicating with the leader of the convoy.

Su Ping listened for a while and realized what was going on. He didn’t know that there would actually be bandits wandering in the void.

What a dangerous profession. That spaceship seems to be an excellent artifact; no wonder they’re able to travel across the void and come to this place… Su Ping remarked. He could sense a few powerful Void Beasts lurking in the void nearby. Those people would become easy prey without the channel protecting them.

Void Beasts could easily kill gods who were at the same level. Most gods kept clear from such creatures.

Su Ping watched quietly. If his companions ran into trouble, he would solve it for them. Such a situation wasn’t a big deal for him. It would also count as a reward for the girl’s kind reminder.

Very soon, the two parties reached a deal. The convoy would pay some money to avoid the conflict.

Su Ping was reassured. He was about to take out the Red Dome Realm’s badge and leave, when he suddenly raised his eyebrows.
