“You’re going to teach us that?”

Brian looked at Su Ping with extreme shock in his eyes after hearing what the latter said.

He suspected that Su Ping was kidding; he wasn’t certain though, because Su Ping wasn’t smiling.

Brian suddenly felt that Su Ping meant it by the way he looked at him.

Are there really such people in this world?

Brian had been famous in space since tens of thousands of years ago, and he had a Celestial State expert backing him too. However, he had never heard about the possibility of cultivating a second small world!

It had to be an unparalleled secret technique, one that had never been used in the universe before.

‘That also meant that Su Ping was unique. He had displayed a power that nobody else had!

In terms of path perfection, Su Ping wasn’t as good as him. After all, he had cultivated for far too many years more than Su Ping; his accumulation was much greater.

However, Su Ping had suppressed him with his dual small worlds.

The improvement of one supreme perfect path was not as significant as that of a new small world.

“Tm still considering it.” Su Ping nodded.

Although the secret technique was powerful, the cultivation process was very demanding.

So, even if he publicized the technique, it was up to a person’s own luck and abilities whether or not they could succeed.

He always thought that many techniques were eventually lost because those who knew them were afraid that it would bring them no good if they imparted them to others!

‘There had indeed been many bloody cases where masters were killed by disciples.

However, this technique was different. Not everybody who learned it would succeed in the cultivation path.

That was also why the Heaven Path Institute didn’t regard it as an ultimate technique. New students would quickly have access to the technique.

They didn’t have to prove their aptitude or make contributions to lear the technique, because the technique was demanding in and of itself.3

Su Ping was already one of the best Star Lords throughout the universe. At that point no one could surpass him, even if he shared the secret technique. Besides, it was much easier for him to practice the technique with the help of the system’s cultivation sites.

Brian was intrigued. He wouldn’t have lost as miserably in the battle against Su Ping had he known the technique and condensed a second world of his own!

“If you really teach the technique to me, I swear I will never be your enemy!” said Brian while staring at Su Ping.

Su Ping glanced at him and replied, “What are you talking about? Are you saying that you’ll be my enemy if I don’t teach it to you?”

“Well, not exactly.” Brian quickly shook his head. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He didn’t want to be killed yet.

Su Ping chuckled and said, “All right, treat your wounds.”

He then closed the barrier and started his cultivation.

Brian gazed at Su Ping’s closed barrier with glittering eyes, but then heaved a sigh a good while later. Whether or not Su Ping meant it, that day’s battle was an eye-opener for him.

That unprecedented technique would be exposed sooner or later; it couldn’t be kept a secret forever, even if Su Ping killed him.

The entire universe would probably be shocked once Su Ping did release the cultivation technique, including the twelve Celestials and the saints who lived on the primitive planet.

This cultivation technique has further improved the Star Lords’ upper limit. Future Star Lords will be even stronger and more terrifying! Brian thought quickly about the implications, and had mixed feelings about it. He had heard of the universe’s catastrophe in the past, but he didn’t know the details. If

Su Ping truly did that to resist the universal catastrophe, then he would be doing all human beings a great favor!

Inside the barriers—

Su Ping was seated inside the shield. He slowed down the time around him by a hundred fold, which was the minimum speed he could handle without affecting his cultivation.

After that, Su Ping took out the loot he had found.

The loot included all sorts of stuff, including many pieces of lingerie; Su Ping burned all of those useless things.

2

Su Ping found a lot of cultivation elixirs among the items.

All those who had died were top members of their forces. Su Ping was quite surprised at the amount of goods he found, which could easily be used to buy dozens of galaxies.

Some of the medicines were extremely rare. There were also ones meant to polish the body, some to improve the power of understanding, and others were meant for pets.

Su Ping was in dire need of energy. He piled all the medicines in front of him, and ate them all.

1

He needed energy to condense the eighth Astral Painting and the third small world.

Even though he had stored plenty of energy, it wasn’t enough for his goals.

I’m going to establish a third small world first, and then cultivate the eighth Astral Painting! Su Ping quickly made a plan. He hadn’t built a third small world with the law of source yet; it was a good opportunity for cultivation.

Time flew.

Su Ping ate the medicines one after the other; his body emitted a terrifying heat, just like a steamer. That was the overflowing energy his body couldn’t absorb in time.

Behind Su Ping’s back—two small worlds appeared and blossomed like red lotuses.

Su Ping sank his consciousness into the small worlds. Condensing the double small worlds was quite arduous; it wasn’t easy to grasp the path of illusion, and it was just as difficult to integrate the two small worlds.

Fortunately, he had already mastered the method for melding the two small worlds. It would be much easier to condense the third small world since he had found the law of origin.

He only needed to embed their cores further and more deeply.

Triple small worlds are what the teacher of the Heaven Path Institute is capable of making. However, not all triple small worlds are equally powerful. According to that teacher, mine should be very powerful; after all, each small world is close to the limits.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. His mind directed the power in his body and sent it toward his small world, all the while creating the shape of the third small world.

With the law of origin as core and his power as the content, something new was taking shape.

Su Ping had to constantly transmit energy in the process.

Fortunately, a huge amount of medicines were piled up in front of him; he recognized most of them. He could identify foods easily with the encyclopedia of pet food he had acquired from the system.

I found the law of origin from the Source World for the third small world. Where can I find the path for the fourth small world?

4

I should pay another visit to the Source World when I find some free time. There are countless paths inside; I wonder if I can find a path that doesn’t exist in the universe.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

However, he wasn’t really hopeful about that. He simply wanted to try his luck.

If he did find unknown paths in the Source World, maybe it wouldn’t be that difficult to condense multiple small worlds.

Only a perfect path had to be grasped. So, anyone could try their luck in the Source World and find more paths to condense small worlds.

On the other hand, people like Junior Brother Qianhou have been famous for a long time. And yet, they only know one or two more paths than I do. That’s strange.

They also have access to the Source World. It should have been fairly easy for them to fully grasp other paths

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He thought about asking Brian when the seclusion was over.

Time flew.

Su Ping’s third small world finally took shape after having almost ten precious medicines.

He called it the Path Source World.

He had named the world after the place where he found it.

The first small world was the Astral Power World, the second small world was the Illusory World, and the third was now the Path Source World.

The core was melted and embedded, and the Path Source World was soon combined with his double worlds.

The triple small worlds were finally integrated; their power was connected, and a terrifying aura started to emanate from Su Ping.

‘The aura didn’t leak out, thanks to the blockage of the shield and the barriers, but Su Ping could feel the astonishing changes inside his body. His willpower had been significantly improved, and his astral oceans were also expanded.

He was at least ten times stronger!

Is this the power of having triple small worlds? I feel like I can see the sixth space and even feel the seventh space!

Su Ping was shocked; he felt he was filled with power. If he repeated his encounter with Brian again, he somehow felt able to cut apart all of his paths with nothing but the world power he released.

He took a deep breath.

He eased the surging power inside his body, then glanced at his triple small worlds, which overlapped and blossomed; the Path Source World was on the top. Many paths were flying like dragons inside; the perfect paths were most eye-catching of all.

I feel that the paths are very active in the Path Source World. It looks like the path of origin is very intimate with plenty of laws… Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

He had the feeling that those paths were alive.

Maybe they were life forms that human beings couldn’t understand or define.

After observing them for a while, Su Ping looked away and checked the time. He had been training in seclusion for twenty-one days, but only a couple of hours had passed thanks to the slowed time.

Su Ping continued consuming medicines.

Pure power flowed into his body, filling up his expanded astral oceans.

He directed the power into the depths of his body and condensed more stars.

Back in the Source World, he had cultivated enough paths for him to condense all 72 stars!

More stars started appearing in his body as the medicines disappeared into Su Ping’s mouth.

Each star contained a fully-mastered law.

Su Ping tried to embed the perfect path of fire into one, only to find that the condensed star was bigger and more brilliant!

Maybe when I understand and grasp enough perfect laws, I’ll be able to reshape the eighth Astral Painting and later replace all of them with perfect paths! Su Ping thought.

3

Condensing stars with fully-mastered laws was just the minimum requirement of the eighth Astral Painting.

But that was not the upper limit.

I wonder what kind of change the eighth Astral Painting will bring forth when it’s complete… Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He looked forward to the result..
