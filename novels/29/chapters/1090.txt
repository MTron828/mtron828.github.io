Chapter 1092: Clearance

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Even if they survive, they’ll just be losers unqualified to go to the central continent without the tokens.”

Someone smiled casually as they looked at the running allies.

Had it not been for that rule, they wouldn’t have minded killing all deserters because of their betrayal.

But first things first; their primary target was getting the tokens. A hundred people are able to resist the power of the sixth space… Yu Jingze and the others watched their opponents; most had escaped, while a hundred of them stayed. Those who had fled survived the attack, but none dared to linger for long.

As for the rest, they had been killed directly.

It only took ten seconds for a huge number of opponents to disappear, and just a hundred chose to remain.

It was an indicator—the hundred men could briefly stay in the seventh space!

The seventh space was traversed by Ascendants and above, as it contained unknown dangers, some of which had been buried for so long that they were threats even to Ascendants themselves.

Undoubtedly, the ones who remained were outstanding Star Lords from their respective forces.

All of them are usually hard to find; to think they would be here… Diaz looked awful. He realized that he was only subpar among the participants of the trial.

Loulan Lin was probably within the average range.

As for Su Ping… He was probably above average. Shuai Qianhou—a Star Lord who had grasped perfect paths—was undoubtedly at the very top.

Shuai Qianhou stared at the red-robed young man and the others before him, who remained motionless. However, the profound laws they harnessed were resisting the space power invasive attack. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Those five experts had undoubtedly grasped perfect paths.

But

He didn’t expect to really hurt them with that single attack.

He had only used it to clear the area.

The clearing had yet to be finished.

“Void Flames!”

Shuai Qianhou raised his hand again. Scorching flames abruptly burst out of the void; they burned furiously and covered the entire sky.

The world seemed to have turned into a furnace, about to melt everybody!

They had grasped the fire law, and therefore didn’t require oxygen; they spreaded in space while able to melt all the other laws. It was the second perfect path he knew!

“What the hell is this?”

“The path of fire. It’s the perfect path of fire!” The formerly calm warriors who had remained were frightened at the moment. Only part of the seventh space had been replaced with a part of the outside world. All the victims had been killed by the seventh space itself.

But then, Shuai Qianhou started getting serious. He made use of his space power and the path of fire, making it ten times more damaging.

Those who had been merely defending themselves with laws and secret treasures met their end. Their treasures were melted and their laws were broken;the flames were so fierce that they couldn’t use anything to block them.

The scorching power melted their senses, astral power, and laws!

“Help us!!!”

“Oh no…!” Some screamed and others moaned. Just like the previous victims, they had let out miserable cries and begged for help; even more people chose to flee from the area.

The enemy was much stronger than what they had imagined; it mattered not whether or not they were in an alliance. Besides, their alliance wasn’t real to begin with.

Dozens more collapsed in the flames; even more people tried their best, using their secret treasures, forbidden skills, and other trump cards to escape from the fire.

Only twenty people stayed.

Roughly five of them were struggling to resist. Some had been deformed, turned into ghastly monsters; they seemed to be using a special ancient technique which granted them an enormous power.

However, the power couldn’t reverse the invasion of the perfect path of fire.

The red-robed young man and the others stood still and ignored the screams.

The brawny young man had a cold look; he was seemingly unaware but also having expected something of the sort.

While standing behind Shuai Qianhou-Loulan Lin, Yu Jingze and the others were in shock. Most of the people who had surrounded them were eliminated. No wonder Shuai Qianhou didn’t panic at all; he even provoked the survivors.

It was true that he was showing mercy by letting them join his team!

Wanyan Shuang, however, frowned; she knew Shuai Qianhou too well to be shocked. What worried her was that, even though many people had been eliminated, only the real bad a**es remained.

Some of them were probably just as strong as Shuai Qianhou.

“Void Flames!”

Shuai Qianhou waved his hand coldly. A purple blossom of flames was suddenly gathered in the void, then flew towards the survivors.

Purple flames splashed out from the flower of fire, then flying at their enemies like lotus flowers.

The red-robed young man stared at the scene, completely unconcerned about the situation. He remarked casually, “It’s time.”

Behind him—the brawny young man who had spoken to Shuai Qianhou grinned and replied, “Let me try him out for size again!” He stepped up and roared loudly.

The void trembled, and a terrifying sound blast resounded; it wasn’t a simple sonic wave; even so, it contained a special frequency. It was a law.

Shock!

There were some people hiding due to shock, who didn’t flee to a far place; he had chosen to stay around and get the loot. He was ready to pick up the loot, but then he widened their eyes with fear. O The next moment… Their heads exploded. The sonic waves destroyed the purple flames. Yu Jingze and the others—who were behind Shuai Qianhou—quickly changed their expressions and merged with their pets, changing the laws around them. Any substance and energy approaching them would be turned to ice if they set up that law. Loulan Lin and the others reacted in time and set up other laws quickly, hoping to weaken the terrifying blast. The law of shock was quickly disseminated along with the sonic waves. Yu Jingze and the others changed their expressions, and then vomited blood.

They stepped back; Elena even grunted as she was flung back. All her facial organs were bleeding, making her pretty face look rather ghastly.

Wanyan Shuang had a cold demeanor. The law that surrounded her resisted the law of shock; she wasn’t the main target anyway, and she resolved the attack without a sound.

She turned her head, only to find that a certain man in another direction had remained still.

It was none other than Su Ping.

The law of shock, however, disappeared without a sound; right when it approached Su Ping. It seemed to have collapsed on its own.

Su Ping was standing in front of the Loulans participating in the trial; they were completely unscathed. They also heard the sonic waves, but no one had been injured.

Wanyan Shuang narrowed her eyes. It was true that, even though the guy who easily killed Ye Ling was only in the Star State; he wasn’t at all simple! “Mr. Su…”

The Loulan family members could not endure any more shocks, but then they saw that Shen Huang’s other disciples, including Yu Jingze, were looking rather miserable and injured. They looked at Su Ping, realizing he had resisted the shock on their behalf.

Loulan Lin secretly gritted her teeth, while her face showed a troubled expression.

Further ahead-Shuai Qianhou was unaffected. He was already fighting the brawny young man. The torn flower of fire healed quickly. Then, purple flames were spread through veins that couldn’t be seen in the void; they seemed to be tying up the brawny young man.

“Cut!” the brawny young man roared. That was the path of breaking, a second perfect path he had grasped.

The path of breaking consisted of sharpness traits, invasion, ruination, and the others. It was only less destructive than the ultimate law of destruction!

The law of destruction consisted of only one feature, which was destruction itself.

It was capable of obliterating everything. Including itself!

There was a boom, which was not a real sound; it was the rupture of laws that were only audible through the mind.

The spreading purple veins and flames were blocked. The brawny young man sneered; a dragon that looked like a scorpion and a dragon arose on his back and entered his body. His body was instantly expanded, and he grew sharp scales as he charged at Shuai Qianhou.

Shuai Qianhou was indifferent; he was surrounded by laws. The path of fire entered the void and combined with space, turning into sharp, purple fiery spears that stabbed the brawny man.

A giant axe showed up in the brawny man’s hand; it contained terrifying laws, and was a powerful Star Lord; a treasure that innately carried multiple laws!

It contained multiple features; it was quite destructive and multipurpose.

Su ping gathered the path of breaking on the axe and waved it quickly, destroying the purple fiery spears. A Shuai Qianhou condensed a long spear in his hand upon seeing that; he tore the void apart and fought the guy. Space itself changed quickly. They soon fought all the way into the deeper spaces.

Noises originated from the void every now and then, as if a deeper space was

being apart.

Everybody waited anxiously, and despair rose.

Only one of the opponents had already kept Shuai Qianhou occupied; even though Shuai Qianhou was indeed strong, he would have been unable to quickly finish off that opponent, which meant that his teammates were in great danger.

The battle continued. Shuai Qianhou and the brawny man were nowhere to be seen, even after several minutes passed; only the noises could be heard.

Facing them—the red-robed young man withdrew his gaze and chuckled. It seems that they’re trying to break the tie. What about you? Shen Huang must have left important information for you, right? Tell me; I may reconsider sparing your lives for your master’s sake. 1 Yu Jingze and the others had awful-looking expressions, and unconsciously glanced at Su Ping.

The latter was carrying the ultimate treasure. They could only hope that the treasure could beat those opponents. It would be impossible for their opponents to let them leave.

“Huh?”

The red-robed young man and his companions were surprised, seeing that everybody was looking at a Star State individual. Soon after, a person whispered something to them, and all of them seemed to have been enlightened..
