Chapter 1255 Predestination (2)

“Master, give me some time,” said Su Ping in a hurry.

“All right!” Shen Huang replied while fighting. He didn’t know what Su Ping was going to do, but he would never let his disciple collapse while on his watch, especially after having fought for so long. Might as well enjoy the battle since it was impossible to escape!

Su Ping instantly closed his eyes; his brains were practically boiling as his thinking went into overdrive.

Time, space, void, world, Ascendant State…

The answer is predestined…

The barriers of the universe…

Small universe…

Infinite information went back and forth, interweaving in Su Ping’s head, including the epiphany for the Ascendant State he had attained moments before. Considering the system’s answer, Su Ping felt that he was very close to finding the road to the Ascendant State.

I cannot rise to the Ascendant State with my own laws. The differences between the Ascendant and the Star Lord levels, aside from the unique laws, include the Ascendant State worlds…

Only by going through the Heavenly Tribulation and earning the Heavens approval can one’s world evolve…

Yes, the purpose of rising to the Ascendant State is to change my small world…

So, even if I can’t win the Heavens’ approval, what’s the big deal?

Su Ping snapped out of that rush of thoughts, just like having someone pour a bucket of cold water over his head. He finally realized how his mind had been restricted for too long. It was also partly because all the Ascendants he knew had advanced by creating their own laws.

Why did they have to go through the Heavenly Tribulation?

Where was the Heavenly Tribulation from?

Su Ping wouldn’t have known the answers without the cultivation sites. However, he had learned of the existence of “Heavens” back in the Archean Divinity and on his visits to the Golden Crow world.

They represented a level and were also living creatures themselves!

It was better to stop and not rise to the Ascendant State if they didn’t approve of him and gave him tests?

Bulls*it!

So, the answer the system was referring to is the Chaos Star Chart… Su Ping finally realized that he had been holding the key the whole time. It was funny that he had never realized it in the decades he had explored the cultivation sites.

If you won’t let me rise to the Ascendant State… I will just ascend on my own then!

Su Ping suddenly widened his eyes, which glowed brilliantly.

But the next moment—he saw a man as dazzling as the sun being flung back. His armor was ragged and his blood spilled throughout the void. He was none other than Su Ping’s master! “Master!”

Su Ping’s eyes widened.

“Humph. You’re running out of strength. I said that I will turn your spine into the back of my throne, and I mean it!” Ye Chen charged at Su Ping, ignoring Shen Huang who was badly wounded.

He hated Su Ping partly because the latter had snatched his treasures, but the main reason was that Su Ping’s potential and the mysterious demonic store scared him.

Die!

Ye Chen raised a hand, creating an enormous hand made of energy that clenched Su Ping’s body.

“Get lost!” Su Ping roared and unleashed his fighting will. He fully activated his Chaos constitution at that moment. A huge amount of chaos power was released along with his attack. His sword aura illuminated the void and made Ye Chen’s energy hand collapse, while moving further towards the ancient foe.

“Damn it!”

Ye Chen changed his expression, becoming even more determined to kill Su Ping. He didn’t expect that the latter would be able to survive in the ninth space and still have reserves to launch such a powerful attack while in a suppressed environment. He was strong enough to crush all Ascendants, and he was just a Star Lord.

Both the Saint King and Mo Ri were astonished. Su Ping’s attack would have shocked them if he were an Ascendant, not to mention that he was just a Star Lord. Never had they seen an Ascendant as strong as that young man.

“He’s indeed a little monster. Indeed, he cannot be left alive…” Grimness flashed in Mo Ri’s eyes as he charged at Shen Huang, leaving Su Ping to Ye Chen, who was the most determined to get rid of the boy.

A Celestial could kill any Star Lord, no matter how brilliant.

After all, he was two realms above.

“Devilish Constitution!”

Ye Chen took action again, unleashing a torrent of devilish aura. He had been greatly exhausted by using the oracle and the hellish realm. He was forced to use his constitution, hoping to finish Su Ping off as soon as possible.

His strength increased as the constitution was manifested, then he rushed towards Su Ping across the void.

Su Ping’s eyes were bloodshot, as his fury couldn’t go any higher. He had finally found the road to the Ascendant State but had no time to try it. His opponent would have enough time to kill him hundreds of times if he chose to advance right then and there!

Giving up was the only option?

Desperation was one of the greatest pains in life. Still, a greater pain was the hope of being freed from despair but having no means to see it through.

Countless geniuses had probably experienced the same in all of history.

“Magic Restriction!”

Ye Chen’s face was cold; his black hair fluttered. He launched a round of attacks; Su Ping instantly felt that the Dao Patterns by his side were going out of control.

There was a boom. Ye Chen smashed with his fist, and Su Ping responded in kind. He was flung hundreds of meters back, while Ye Chen also shook, flying almost ten meters back. The outcome left him in shock.

“You really have to be killed!”

Coldness emanated from Ye Chen’s eyes. He charged even faster.

“You wouldn’t have survived a single punch if we were on the same level!” Su Ping roared and fought using his full strength and burning all his essence. Since he couldn’t break through, he knew that it would be his last battle.

He had been through countless battles back in the cultivation sites. Never did he think that his final clash would take place in the ninth space, with those odds.

“But there are no ifs in reality.”

Ye Chen’s face was cold. He knew that Su Ping was right, but that was just how life was. He didn’t feel embarrassed; after all, Su Ping had the mysterious demonic store as backer, while he only had an incomplete emperor-level sutra; everybody had different opportunities. He was quite satisfied with his life, thinking that it wasn’t bad for him to have reached that level.

Bang!

The sword aura slashed forth; Ye Chen attacked and shattered it. His flame-covered fist punched while Su Ping quickly sent a sword attack again. Their fight continued; neither could win!

“Die! Die! Die!”

The longer Ye Chen fought, the more shocked he became. He was already using his real power, and yet he was unable to suppress the boy. Each of the sword’s attacks was as powerful as one made by a Celestial, and Su Ping was actually launching them consecutively. The old man could tell that Su Ping was burning his vitality. However, it was impossible even for Heavenly Lords to burn their vitality to overcome the gap and fight a Celestial!

Roar!

Elsewhere-Mo Ri and the Saint King were also using all their methods to suppress Shen Huang. Neither of them held back. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

That battle would have ended long before if they weren’t wary of Shen Huang’s dying strike.

“Get out of the way!” Shen Huang roared. He was covered in blood at the moment while acting like a madman. His golden hair was messy and his armor was cracked. Elder Yan

— who had merged with him—was very close to burning up his vitality.

He couldn’t sustain his prime status any longer, and his strength was declining.

That pivoting point was exactly what Mo Ri and the Saint King were waiting for.

“Disciple!” Shen Huang roared all of a sudden.

Su Ping, still fighting Ye Chen, shivered when he heard his master’s calling. A rush of conflicting feelings filled his heart; there was so much he owed this master, but he didn’t even have a chance to return the favor!

“I will give you one last ride. Run using your full strength!” Shen Huang roared, and unleashed the light of a scorching sun. The void was torn apart, and the golden ocean swept over and drowned everyone present.

The next moment-everybody returned to the sky above the City of Sins from the battleground in the ninth space.

Su Ping instantly felt that he was hundreds of times stronger, no longer restricted by the ninth space’s pressure. He looked at Shen Huang, only to see that his master was smiling at him in comfort, right in the middle of the golden sun.

Su Ping’s eyes were tearing up. Am I truly worthy as his disciple?

“Run…” Shen Huang relayed that soundless message with his lips. Su Ping heard him, but his heart was filled with sadness, as it was impossible to escape.
