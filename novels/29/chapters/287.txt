Chapter 288 Her Turn

“Alas, look at him. He’s using his most powerful pet at the beginning. He should have known better and hidden his edge.” Fei Yanbo could not help but shake his head in disapproval.

Fei Fei darted a glance at his father. “Brother Fengtian is demonstrating power. This is what men should do. Just go ahead and fight. What is the fun of being overly cautious? Besides, others may know that this is his most powerful pet. So what? That is a rare dragon. What can they do even if they know? Worst case scenario, Brother Fengtian will have to fight against four. It’s not like he cannot win!” He didn’t agree with his father.

Fei Yanbo glared at his son. “Nonsense. What do you know? I am talking about strategy!” “Bah.”

The boy sneered. He clearly didn’t care about what his father said.

Fei Yanbo pulled a long face. He would have beaten his students up if they dared to talk to him like this. But this boy was his son and he couldn’t resort to violence with him. If he scolded his son too much, his son would tell mom and he would be punished...

Su Ping chuckled. “Mr. Fei, your son is not wrong. Just go ahead and fight. With strength, you shall be afraid of no one. Also, I don’t think Little Luo is an impulsive person. To him, this Elite League must be just a training opportunity. He never cares about ranking. He can always come back next time.”

Fei Fei was surprised that Su Ping sided with him. As he looked at Su Ping again, Fei Fei then thought that the person who had squeezed into this narrow room was less repulsive. Still, he was not happy about Su Ping using the words “Little Luo.” Luo Fengtian is older than you. How dare you call him “Little Luo”? So disrespectful!

Fei Fei snorted in dissatisfaction but refrained from arguing with Su Ping.

Fei Yanbo was speechless at Su Ping’s reply. “You’re an experienced fox yourself, better at hiding than anyone. Now you say that power rules. It’s like I don’t know that!” Fei Yanbo said to himself.

The thing was, you could have power but others could have more power. You were sending yourself to doom when you didn’t know how to use strategy!

While they were chitchatting, the battle had begun.

When the Dark Pit Dragon appeared, the audience cried out in shock. They didn’t expect that they would see such a rare dragon. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The other four on the stage looked at each other in speechless despair. In an instant, they had reached a silent agreement. The four began to dash toward Luo Fengtian together.

They summoned their pets and surrounded Luo Fengtian from all four directions.

All of the pets were of the element family, with some having middle-rank bloodlines while others had advanced bloodlines. However, the pets chickened out as soon as they came out, due to the overwhelming presence of the Black Pit Dragon.

Only one of the pets seemed to be trained well. The violent pet released its skill toward the Black Pit Dragon under its master’s command.

Roar!

All of a sudden, the Black Pit Dragon roared.

That pet’s strike failed to leave a mark on the Black Pit Dragon’s scales. On the other hand, the four pets, as well as their masters, had been heavily mauled and frightened by the Black Pit Dragon’s ferocious roar.

The next second, dark energy began to ooze out from the Black Pit Dragon. A blast wave originated from the Black Pit Dragon and was spread out, sweeping the four and their pets off the stage altogether.

Victory!

The audience cheered in excitement.

“Brother Luo, nice job!”.

Thrilled, Fei Fei waved his fists, as if he were the one on stage, winning.

Fei Yanbo didn’t know what to say. Victory for Luo Fengtian was not a surprise. But what was there to cheer for when his victory came so easily? It was his pet that overpowered his opponents. Besides, Luo Fengtian would have won with any pet other than the Black Pit Dragon given the capability of the other four. However, Luo Fengtian just had to be so high-profile. He was asking for trouble!

Of course, while Fei Yanbo harbored some unspoken criticism, he could not pour cold water on Luo Fengtian in his moment of triumph.

Fei Yanbo turned to Su Ping and saw the latter smiling. But the latter’s smile was kind of strange. It was like Su Ping was smiling an... amiable smile?

“Mr. Su, you must have given your sister a powerful pet for her to win the championship, right?” Fei Yanbo thought of something. He had seen that Inferno Dragon and was aware that the rare dragon that everyone would take delight in discussing was just Su Ping’s secondary pet.

Since Su Ping was confident that his sister could win the championship, then the pet he prepared for her should probably be stronger than his secondary pet. “It is fine. Just another dragon,” Su Ping replied. He didn’t intend on hiding this from Fei Yanbo and was not afraid that Fei Yanbo would leak the information.

Fei Yanbo knew he was right. His curiosity grew. A dragon that could be more powerful than the Inferno Dragon would be one of those that were few and far between. It could be... a dragon of the legendary level.

The Inferno Dragon was rare to begin with. Could it be that, during this Elite League, he could bring out a dragon that was even rarer than the Inferno Dragon?

Fei Yanbo didn’t ask for the details because pets were considered confidential information for participants. To ask for more details would be impolite. He would be even more embarrassed if Su Ping refused to reply.

Luo Fengtian had returned to the seating area.

Since the stage had been freed up, a new group of participants went up.

On the eight stages, the battles varied and the audience could watch anyone they liked. A true feast to the eyes.

As more and more battles came to an end, Fei Yanbo’s students had taken turns to go up to the stages. He was glad that, while he had brought many students, none of them ended up on the same stage. So, they didn’t have to fight each other.

Several hours later, all of Fei Yanbo’s students had finished their battles.

Only two of them lost, since they encountered more powerful opponents. Those opponents seemed to have come from other zones. It was common that some participants from the uptown area would try their luck on the two branch venues in the shantytown area.

After all, for many people from the uptown area, the shantytown was a place with little resources and the ranks of both pets and participants were generally low. They could have an easier time passing by going there to compete. Fei Yanbo was not happy about the defeats. But, the two of them could still make it to the next contest as long as they could win the coming one-on-one challenges five times in a row.

Soon, Su Lingyue’s name and a picture popped out on the screen.

Finally, she was up.

Su Ping adopted a more serious attitude and cast a glance at the staging area.

Su Lingyue was not far away from Su Ping. By then, she had seen her name on the screen as well. Then, she turned around out of instinct. As she saw Su Ping’s encouraging look, her uptight nerves relaxed a bit.

As Su Lingyue’s name appeared on the screen, some among the audience began to discuss and there were some insulting words mixed in. “Finally, your sisters’ turn.” Fei Yanbo sat up straight but he inadvertently bumped into the lady sitting next to him again. Annoyed, the lady glared at Fei Yanbo.

Su Ping nodded.

Fei Fei looked at Su Ping, curiously. “That’s your sister? Why aren’t you participating when she is?”

“It would be pointless for me to participate,” Su Ping replied. Fei Fei raised his eyebrows. He thought he understood the underlying meaning. “Huh, you’re no better than me then. You can only survive one round as well. As a big brother, it must be quite the shame to have your baby sister beat you.”

Fei Yanbo was scared pale. He scolded him, “Nonsense. Apologize to Mr. Su, right now!”

Su Ping having killed people the previous day was still visible in his eyes. Su Ping sat there just like any average dude, without exhibiting a whiff of power. Still, dogs that don’t bark are the ones that do bite. If Su Ping was angry, Fei Yanbo was sure that he couldn’t survive the retaliation from a titled battle pet warrior.

Fei Fei was stunned still. Usually his father would scold him but he would hardly be that strict. Embarrassed, Fei Fei argued, “What, Mr. Su? I didn’t say anything wrong, did I? I am merely telling the truth!”

“You! How dare you! I must teach you a lesson. No one will help you even if your mother was here!” Fei Yanbo stood up in rage. He had to discipline his son. If he continued to be so audacious, he would cause some troubles in the future.

But someone pushed Fei Yanbo down.

Su Ping patted his arm. “Never mind. Let’s watch the match. Don’t be so angry about your son. I won’t mind.”

Fei Yanbo looked at Su Ping who was still smiling. After a second of hesitation, Fei Yanbo sat down and heaved a sigh. “Mr. Su, do not lower yourself to this bastard’s level. His mom spoils him rotten. I will discipline him when we get back home!”
