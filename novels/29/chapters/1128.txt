Chapter 1129 Departure

Golden Lotus looked at Su Ping with a mix of shock and suspicion.

She had indeed concluded that Su Ping was speaking the truth. She had also learned from the unlucky bastards who had accidentally fallen into the ocean that the age she had been born in was over. No one knew of the infamous old monster or the demonic cauldron that once scared the entire world.

Nevertheless… The cauldron was a Deity King weapon!

“Are you sure? Although I don’t know the age you’re living in, are you familiar with the Deity Kings’ power?”

Su Ping replied carefully, “Of course. The Ghost Lamp Nether Fish is a Deity King beast; it even has a chance to rise beyond. Still, no Deity Kings are able to cause trouble in this day and age, unless they’re Deity Emperors!”

“Why do you keep winking at each other? Are you conspiring something?” asked the cauldron woman at that moment. Her voice was cold and her eyes were like blades cutting Su Ping apart.

He might be able to struggle against Ascendant State opponents, but he was like a fish on the chopping block in front of a Celestial, completely unable to defend himself!

“Senior, I’m trying to persuade her,” said Su Ping quickly.

The woman slightly raised her brow and sneered. “Good. Just go to hell if you can’t!”

She was indeed not easy to deal with.

After heaving an inward sigh, Su Ping continued telepathically, “Miss Pan, just think about it. I know you care about the people in the universe, but I’m also one of them; I’ll die right now if you don’t accept. Besides, the situation outside will be in our favor.”

Golden Lotus changed her expression and stared at Su Ping.

She didn’t know whether he was telling the truth, or he was merely trying to survive. “If both you and the cauldron stay here, wouldn’t the universe fall into disaster too once the old monster is reborn and reclaims the cauldron?”

Su Ping gazed at Golden Lotus and added, “The cauldron and the old monster together will mean twice the disaster! It’s better to separate them than let them wreck havoc together. I think we shouldn’t stop her; rather, we should help her escape. If that were to happen, the old monster won’t have his weapon, and we can suppress her with other Deity Kings. Wouldn’t that be for the best?”

Golden Lotus felt dazed for a moment. Her eyes glittered as she quickly considered the matter. She stared at Su Ping and said a moment later, “Are Deity Kings the strongest experts out there?”

“To my knowledge, yes.” Su Ping nodded.

Golden Lotus asked again, “Did you come here with the help of a Deity King?”

“Yes, this has to do with a trial. Twelve Deity Kings sent their disciples over for the legacy. They didn’t know it was a trap…” said Su Ping frankly while looking Golden Lotus in the eye.

Her expression changed as she asked, “Twelve Deity Kings noticed this place?”

“That is correct.”

Golden Lotus fell silent.

She knew that Su Ping wasn’t lying. So, if the cauldron did escape, she would probably be noticed and suppressed by the Deity Kings immediately.

Still, the pill lady would probably share the same fate.

“Is that our destiny?” mumbled Golden Lotus, with confusion in her eyes.

The woman frowned and asked, “What nonsense are you talking about?”

Su Ping’s expression changed a bit after hearing her response. He was afraid she would be frustrated, so he quickly said, “Miss Pan, don’t worry; I have a way to hide all of you from the twelve Deity Kings if we get out of this place.”

Golden Lotus was stunned; she couldn’t help but look at Su Ping. “You?”

“That is correct.”

Su Ping nodded.

He saw the confusion in her eyes, and could only heave a sigh. She was suspicious, even though she knew he was telling the truth. In any case, it was understandable.

After all, there was no way that a normal Star Lord could hide anything from a Celestial. After hesitating for a moment, Su Ping said to the woman, “Senior, can you remove my restrictions?”

The woman raised her eyebrows and sneered, “Are you asking to be killed? Don’t tell me what to do!”

“Senior, I’m helping you persuade her. You know that I’m too weak to escape from this place without your permission,” said Su Ping while looking her in the eye.

The woman narrowed her eyes and stared at Su Ping, before she answered with a snort.

Su Ping instantly felt that the restrictions on her body were removed. The power of laws returned to his body. He couldn’t help but sigh in relief. He then said to Golden Lotus, “Miss Pan, behold!”

The next moment, the illusion of a small world surfaced behind Su Ping’s back.

The woman sneered with disdain in her eyes. But then she saw that another small world appeared above the first one soon after.

Her cold smile froze, and astonishment flashed across her eyes.

“This is my second small world!” Su Ping only revealed double small worlds, and then said to Golden Lotus telepathically, “Once we leave this place, you and your pill friends can hide in my second small world. That way, the Celestials will hardly be able to detect you.”

Golden Lotus was visibly shocked. He obviously didn’t expect that Su Ping was capable of doing

that. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I had only heard about it before. I didn’t know it was really possible…” Golden Lotus murmured.

“Miss Pan, how does it sound? Please think of your pill friends,” Su Ping tried to persuade her.

Golden Lotus was silent for a moment. Then, she took a deep breath and said to the woman, “All right, I accept. I know you want to plant a curse on me because you want to coerce Senior Dark Demon with me as hostage, but you must promise me that you’ll lift the curse after we leave, or Senior Dark Demon won’t let you

pass.”

“Do you really accept?”

The woman was surprised, not expecting that Su Ping would truly persuade the pill lady.

She stared at them suspiciously, and then said to Su Ping, “Brat, how did you persuade her? Tell me the truth. Is there some sort of ploy going on here?”

Lost for words, Su Ping replied with a bitter smile, “Senior, I simply told her that I’m also one of the people she cares for, and that I hoped she could save me first. There’s no need to worry. Besides, you’re going to personally plant the curse. Miss Pan is willing to give her life to you; do you still not trust her?”

The woman frowned; she knew that Su Ping was right. However, she found it uncanny that Golden Lotus-who had been stubborn for countless years—would suddenly change her mind.

“It seems that I need to plant more curses, just to be safe.”

The woman thought for a moment and then said to Su Ping, “Brat, you seem to be quite clever. I’ll plant a curse on you too, but don’t worry; I’ll lift it for you when we get out.”

She then spouted a curse before Su Ping could say anything; it looked like a black fire that went into Su Ping’s chest.

He felt that his chest was burning. He lowered his head, only to see a black lotus flower etched over it.

“You…”

Su Ping felt like cursing, but held back in the end.

Those ancient demons were indeed hard to trick; they were brutal and cautious.

Golden Lotus’ expression changed somewhat. She said to the other woman, “I already accepted your request; what more do you want? Lift his curse!”

“No, I won’t!” The woman snorted. “You’d better behave, or I will kill him right now!”

What a temperamental woman!

Su Ping secretly cursed her, and then said to Golden Lotus, “Miss Pan, never mind; let’s just get out of here first.”

Golden Lotus couldn’t help but say, “But…”

“It’s impossible to negotiate with her; but don’t worry, I have a way to tame her,” said Su Ping telepathically.

Golden Lotus was dazed and surprised at the same time, but she didn’t let it show. Could Su Ping really tame this cauldron?

She wasn’t really convinced, but Su Ping meant it when he said it.

He wasn’t lying to her.

This left her rather puzzled, finding that Su Ping was even more enigmatic than before. “Little pill, I’m coming.” The woman chuckled and approached Golden Lotus. Then she added, “You’d better not resist, or this kid will go boom!”

She opened her fist to mimic an explosion while she spoke.

Golden Lotus grimly said, “Just hurry up.”

The woman grimaced. Then, black flames surged all over her body; she sent them to Golden Lotus with the power of curses.

Golden Lotus didn’t resist; she simply endured it all. The process ended until her fair skin was covered by black flowers.

“You…”

Golden Lotus trembled with fury.

The woman chuckled and clapped her hands. “All right, it’s time to go.”

Then, she ignored them and eagerly activated the array behind her.

“Come on.”

The woman waved at Golden Lotus.

The latter gritted her teeth and walked toward the array along with Su Ping.

He only felt relaxed until he finally set foot on the array. There was a flash, and the ancient palace was no longer there. Darkness went away, and he found himself inside a pavilion as vast as the starry sky.
