Chapter 798: Divine Residence in the Void

“Nice to meet you,” Su Ping replied.

Not sensing any aggression from the man, instead seeing a gentle smile on the man’s face, Su Ping realized something.

“Senior Grandmaster, greetings.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The nearby Pablo spoke respectfully through telepathy.

“?”

O’Neil was about to confess the purpose of his visit; he was confused after hearing what Pablo said. A moment later, he couldn’t help but feel greatly shocked when he saw that Pablo’s respect was directed towards Su Ping.

Grandmaster?

This young man is the grandmaster trainer of this shop?

But, wasn’t he the battle pet warrior who fought against Garland and his fellows, defeating all of them in the end?

Not just O’Neil; Garland also looked at Pablo in shock.

“Okay.”

Su Ping nodded and simply went straight to the point. “Is there anything I can help you with?”

O’Neil snapped out of his shock, but he was still shaken by the revelation. He only knew that Su Ping was being backed by a grandmaster trainer, but he didn’t know that the grandmaster trainer was Su Ping himself!

He was both a grandmaster trainer and a warrior with Star State combat abilities. Right, grandmaster trainers were at least at the Star State; fighting wasn’t the guy’s specialty. Being a grandmaster trainer was his main focus.

O’Neil began to perspire cold sweat; he felt that his back was chilly when he remembered that his grandson had tried to rob a grandmaster trainer of his pet.

“Senior Grandmaster, I’m here to apologize to you on behalf of my unworthy grandson,” said O’Neil sincerely, lowering his head.

Although he had already sent someone to apologize on his behalf, he decided to apologize again, as the man’s identity was too important.

“That matter has already been taken care of. I won’t do anything as long as the Ryan family doesn’t offend me again,” said Su Ping, as if already aware of what they had visited him.

O’Neil looked at him, not seeing any anger on his face; he was finally more or less relaxed. He said, “I’m here partly to apologize, and partly because I learned that you’re a grandmaster trainer. It just so happens that our family has a thirty-thousand-year Transcendence Tree.

“The tree blooms and bears fruit every five hundred years.

“Those fruits are extremely rare; I’ve specifically brought two of them to you. I hope you can accept them.”

He took out two black-and-golden boxes as he spoke; they had seals to prevent the energy from leaking.

Su Ping was slightly surprised, not expecting the guy to show up bearing gifts.

The guy was also offering him the Transcendence Fruits he desired to find.

Those fruits also existed in cultivation sites, but he had yet to find the right cultivation site to look for them; it was hard for him to stumble upon those fruits if he didn’t have any directions.

“I’ll take them then.” Su Ping chuckled.

He didn’t examine the fruits. It was unlikely that the fruits were fake, since they had gone there specially to offer them as gifts. That is, unless they were trying to piss him off.

Regret flashed in O’Neil’s eyes, but he recovered quickly.

Garland and Pablo looked at each other with a weird expression. O’Neil had originally planned to present one fruit, but then he decided to offer another after learning of Su Ping’s identity.

The fruits were so rare that not even the Ryan family had a large stock. The Ryans had in fact offered such fruits to many honorable guests in the past hundred years; there weren’t many of them left.

“Apart from the two Transcendence Fruits, I have a piece of intelligence that I wonder if you’ll be interested in,” said O’Neil uneasily.

At first he thought that the young man would be interested in the news.

However, he was no longer as confident after learning that he was a trainer.

After all, most trainers would mostly focus on training their pets; they rarely went out on risky adventures.

“What is it?” asked Su Ping.

“A collapsing vortex was recently detected at the edge of Zeruprun. It was at first believed to be a small black hole, but it turned out to be a mysterious realm.”

O’Neil continued telepathically in a low voice, “After some investigation, it’s been found that there’s an ancient divine residence inside that mysterious realm. The place emanates a dazzling light, which indicates the presence of great treasures. The news has yet to spread. I learned it from a senior Star Lord I’m familiar with.”

While talking, he looked at Su Ping and added, “Quite a few Star Lords are currently cracking open the defense mechanisms outside the mysterious realm. The best treasures will naturally belong to them, but we can still take things they’re not interested in.”

“A divine residence in the void?”

Su Ping was surprised. An ancient divine residence?

“Are there good items in it?” Su Ping wasn’t too interested in mysterious realms. After all, the cultivation sites he had access to equaled to countless mysterious realms.

However, some of the natives in those mysterious realms had already claimed the treasures. They were so strong that Su Ping was unable to take the treasures away despite going through countless resurrections.

Su Ping had obtained a lot of treasures from the Demigod Burial only because of Joanna’s help. Otherwise, the local experts would have already claimed the unusual treasures, and he couldn’t have picked so many of them in the wilderness!

“Well, to call them good is an understatement. They’re spectacular!”

O’Neil was shocked by Su Ping’s question. He instantly continued, “Some of the ancient mysterious realms flow out of the deeper space and appear anywhere in the universe when their restrictions have loosened.

“Some of the famous mysterious realms have so many treasures that not even Ascendant State experts can exhaust them! Such mysterious realms are all under the control of the major forces. They are used as training sanctuaries!

“The smaller mysterious realms are also controlled by top experts and large forces, but that unowned mysterious realm has just been found and is open to all of us. Based on the intelligence I’ve acquired, it might belong to the primordial era. It’s very likely that it contains lost secret techniques.

“Training techniques, runes, and pills of ancient celestials may be available. Even Star Lord seniors would be interested!”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, as he truly felt tempted.

He asked, “Must be very dangerous going there, right? Otherwise, all the treasures would have been taken away.”

“There are indeed dangers, but I don’t know how severe they are.” O’Neil wasn’t surprised to hear that. After all, trainers would never be as bloodthirsty as the battle pet warriors. A battle pet warrior would have been trembling with excitement after hearing the news; they wouldn’t have considered the dangers.

Battle pet warriors grew through experiencing dangerous battles. It came with the territory.

Su Ping glanced at him, deep in thought.

He wondered if that was a trao the guy had set for him.

“I’ll think about it,” he said.

O’Neil wasn’t surprised. If Su Ping were a battle pet warrior, his intelligence would’ve been a great help and could’ve been worth a Transcendence Fruit.

However, it seemed that the information wasn’t as intriguing as he thought.

“Tongtong, come here.”

Seeing Pablo, Su Ping suddenly thought of something and summoned Zhong Lingtong to him.

“Sir.”

Zhong Lingtong greeted him obediently.

Then, she looked at the visitors curiously. She knew Garland, and was surprised to see the Star State bigshot again.

“This is the master trainer I found for you. You will learn about pet training from him for now,” said Su Ping.

He also said to Pablo, “Take good care of her. I will examine her homework once in a while.”

Pablo looked at Zhong Lingtong and found that she was rather cute. Feeling relieved, he said, “I will.”

He was slightly puzzled. Why was Su Ping giving his own student away? To test his sincerity?
