Chapter 1476 Ancestor (1)

“If you want to read, I’ll show them to you.” The Primordial Empyrean Master didn’t say anything else; he simply cursed inwardly, hoping that Su Ping would also contract the strange disease after seeing the strange

corpse.

He quickly locked his memories. As he did so, the indescribable scene popped up in his memories; he couldn’t help but shiver and roar uncontrollably.

Su Ping and the others were surprised by the old expert’s reaction, which was clearly the previously mentioned disease. However, it was unbelievable to see how a universe dominator would go crazy just because he saw a corpse.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered, as he was arriving at a terrifying speculation. That corpse was definitely not from an Ancestral God. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Could it be… some chaos ancestor?

Su Ping had seen Ancestral Gods before. The ones alive were hardly intimidating in his eyes, let alone dead ones.

Although the Primordial Empyrean Master couldn’t compare to him, the guy was a universe dominator in his own right. An Ancestral God couldn’t have affected him so.

“Freeze!”

Su Ping raised his head, sending a stream of soul power into the guy’s consciousness. He instantly felt some assorted thoughts. The guy truly seemed to have gone crazy; it wasn’t a trick.

The old man woke up shortly after. He seemed to have realized something, his expression looked awful. He said to Su Ping, “Just read!” “Okay.”

Su Ping was not worried about the risk of editing or hiding some of the memories. His thoughts went through and soon detected the soul of the Primordial Empyrean Master.

“Is this your soul power?”

The old expert sensed Su Ping’s soul power and felt shocked; it was like a dark ocean carrying an ominous aura. It was hard to imagine how brutal this young man’s heart was, completely unlike the calm person he seemed to be.

Su Ping didn’t respond. His soul power invaded the man’s memories, which were soon replayed. However, the memories were short, and those further away had been locked by some power.

He didn’t try to tear the lock open; he simply read the accessible parts.

The memories started from the moment the Primordial Empyrean Master left the universe.

Very soon, Su Ping located the memories he was interested in.

A strange image was suddenly displayed before Su Ping’s eyes.

In the dark and quiet space, the shape of an ancient object came to view; perfectly still, seemingly made of black materials. It was silent, cold, while at the same time mysterious and terrifying.

There were sudden changes in the world Su Ping was viewing, right when the shape of the ancient corpse appeared.

The body shook all of a sudden. Then, it appeared to be reviving, as it began to move. The bodily tissues were slowly detached from the body and turned into thousands of threads, like hairy tentacles trying to surround him.

An indescribable fright clenched Su Ping’s heart. He was having a hard time breathing. The actual scene made him suspect that he wasn’t reading the man’s memories, but actually witnessing that terrifying existence in person and was being corrupted…

“No!”

Su Ping roared and unleashed his power to break free.

“Boss Su!” someone said in a hurry.

Su Ping sensed a few powers covering him; although weak, they were clearly concerned for him.

He woke up right after. He finally realized that his muscles were tight and his universe of chaos had appeared. He had also revealed the gigantic body of the Primitive Chaos Clan. Su Ping turned around, only to find that the three cyborg leaders, Chi Ying, the Primordial Empyrean Master and the others were looking

at him in fear.

Su Ping guessed that he had lost control at some point. He was quite distraught because

of the experience. “I am sorry.”

None of them could stop him if he lost control.

“I’m glad that you’re fine…” Chi Ying was quite scared. Just then, he thought that they were screwed. Fortunately, Su Ping woke up

in time.

The latter managed a smile, and then raised his head to reverse time and see what happened. He was meditating as he read the Empyrean Master’s memories. Then, he trembled and roared, revealing his true form and the chaos universe. He almost started

attacking.

I truly lost control…

Su Ping’s heart was heavy, as losing control over reading some memories was completely

unexpected.

“Did you see it too?” The Primordial Empyrean Master looked at Su Ping in shock and suspicion. The aura that the latter displayed had terrified him. He no longer treated the young man as a peer, but as a

person with the legendary Undying State. “Where did you see the corpse? Do you remember the location?” asked Su Ping.

The old expert shook his head and said, “I can’t recall those memories anymore. I go

crazy whenever I think of it; I only know that it happened.”

Su Ping nodded ever so slightly. There was indeed something wrong with the guy’s memories. He even suspected that it wasn’t a corpse, and was somehow residing in the elder’s memories.

Furthermore, the owner of that corpse could be in a different time and space; in the past,

or maybe the future.

That kind of existence was beyond his understanding. It was undoubtedly a chaotic

ancestor!

Even though the body had been left behind, nobody could observe it; if someone did, it would have a strong influence on their memories.
