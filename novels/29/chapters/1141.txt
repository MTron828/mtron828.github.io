Chapter 1143 Subduing

The cauldron woman slightly changed her expression. The fright caused by seeing Old Monster Ye made her tremble uncontrollably; she was instinctively walking out of Su Ping’s store.

Her rationality was stopping her, but she was still moving forward at a slow pace.

The old man stopped her and shook his head at that moment.

The cauldron woman snapped out of her shock, drenched in sweat. She didn’t expect that the old man who had suppressed her for countless years would give her a hand at that critical moment.

“Thank you.”

“It’s nothing. I’m just helping myself; he would use you to attack me later if you go back to him.” The old man smiled. “Besides, the kid wouldn’t have let you leave, even if I hadn’t done anything.”

The cauldron woman looked at Su Ping’s back with glittering eyes.

“They’re mine now. Who are you trying to scare off?”

Su Ping sneered as he looked at Lin Xiu, who was trying to threaten his new items. “What a loser you turned out to be. Your weapons, pills and even the book that once taught you have betrayed you. How disgusting must you be? Oh right. I heard that your parents abandoned you when you were little. You were truly born to be alone!”

“Shut up!”

Lin Xiu burst into a fit of rage. “Do you want to die?”

“Yes, maybe of old age.”

Su Ping seemed rather casual, but his words were sharp. “It was quite unscrupulous of you to have cursed your own weapons. Your parents leaving was not your fault, but you are indeed to blame if your weapons and most trustworthy partners chose to betray you. If I were you, I would have been too ashamed to be reborn.”

Veins popped up on Lin Xiu’s forehead; his handsome face couldn’t have looked more awful. He was exasperated by every word uttered by Su Ping.

“I emptied your undersea treasury. Are you angry?” Su Ping kept provoking him. “The dragon and phoenix blood containers you prepared are here. They have a decent taste.”

Lin Xiu breathed heavily and trembled with fury. His eyes were bloodshot, but he didn’t madly rush to attack Su Ping.

The guy finally gnashed his teeth when Su Ping was finally done. “I wonder what makes you so confident, to be provoking me so fearlessly; but it can’t be them. Fine; let me see what other trump cards you have. Otherwise, prepare to be forever imprisoned by me!”

He suddenly raised his hand at the end, and a huge opening appeared in the void; brownish seawater surged out.

The cold seawater flowed endlessly; it seemed to be enough to drown the world.

From the depths of the seawater came an enormous and ferocious fish. It was none other than the Ghost Lamp Nether Fish.

“Beast, make up for your mistake!” said Lin Xiu with an admonishing tone.

He would have killed the creature and made soup with it if he weren’t short of strong warriors after his rebirth.

The Ghost Lamp Nether Fish shivered a bit. It instantly turned around, soon noticing Su Ping by the door. The creature’s crimson eyes widened, with anger and brutality; it vaguely remembered having detected the young man’s aura before. It thought it had eaten that human.

Roar!

The beast roared and charged at Su Ping, blaming all its misfortunes on the young man. It was so scared of Old Monster Ye that it wanted to mince Su Ping into pieces.

“A second Celestial pet!”

“This guy does have something!”

“I wonder if Su Ping is capable of resisting it. To think he would provoke his enemy so fearlessly; he surely made preparations. What will they be?”

The Celestials watched from a distance, not intent on taking part; they were eager to find out how Su Ping would resist the strange fish.

Only some people in the crowd seemed anxious

The members of the Loulan family were among them.

Alas, they didn’t have any say in the matter; they could only watch, even though they were on tenterhooks.

So helpless.

Loulan Lin couldn’t have felt more insignificant. Used to being the beloved princess of the Loulan family, she had always received whatever she needed. Even though she had been defeated by strong enemies before, she knew fully well it was impossible to protect anyone she cared about without enough power.

Her family had told her about the cruelties of the universe, and she had seen some of them. However, experiencing them in person felt different.

Furthermore, what she was experiencing was much less painful than what happened to the people from the bottom rungs of society, whose families were shattered.

“Lord Mu Shen…”

Right when Loulan Lin mustered her courage and was about to beg the Celestial expert next to her—the Ghost Lamp Nether Fish came to an abrupt halt. It was about to bite Su Ping’s store apart, when it fell straight to the ground as if electrocuted.

Its tail was still wagging, but it couldn’t move anymore; it seemed to have been restrained by an invisible power. “Huh?”

Lin Xiu changed his expression and asked angrily, “What are you doing?”

The Ghost Lamp Nether Fish sent back feelings of pain and fear, but the fear wasn’t caused by its master; it had been scared by something else.

The fear was so strong that even Lin Xiu was almost experiencing it.

What did it see? Lin Xiu was stunned by such a reaction; he carefully observed Su Ping’s store, but didn’t see anything.

He eventually noticed that something was off; the seemingly-plain store had completely blocked his senses.

Even though the store looked like a regular building, he felt it was a fully closed sphere.

His senses were completely unable to pierce it

Neither could he sense what was below the store.

There seemed to be something blocking everything within a certain radius, while taking the store as the center.

“It’s been detected that a creature attacked this store. Do you want to kill it?” the system’s unemotional reminder echoed in Su Ping’s head.

Su Ping didn’t give an answer immediately. He looked at the Ghost Lamp Nether Fish, whose head was already the size of his store; its brutal and bloodthirsty eyes were filled with fear; it seemed to be begging for mercy. This guy has eaten a lot of people; it deserves to be executed, but it’s better to make use of it, Su Ping thought. He asked Joanna, “Do you need a pet?”

Joanna raised her eyebrows, realizing Su Ping’s intent. “You’re offering it to me? But I cannot remove its contract.”

“You’ll be able to tame it after the contract is automatically removed,” said Su Ping, “Just move it into the store for me.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Joanna understood and nodded; she stepped forward and forcefully pulled the Ghost Lamp Nether Fish into the store.

The creature’s head-which was as big as the store-quickly shrank in size as it approached the door. The fish kept shrinking as Joanna pulled it inside, until it became five meters long as it was ultimately dragged into the store.

The miniaturized fish still looked hideous and creepy with its fangs, but it was also cute somehow.

Su Ping further compressed it to a length of ten centimeters with the power of his store, making it look like a normal fish.

The Ghost Lamp Nether Fish no longer dared to bare its fangs anymore; it had been shivering ever since it entered the store, just as if it would have entered the mouth of a devil. Someone seemed to be looking down at the fish. The pet was even more scared than when it was by Lin Xiu’s side.

It lay on the ground, trembling with fear; its previous aggressiveness was long gone.

The Celestials present became solemn as they witnessed the scene.

As for Qing Hongyue, Loulan Lin and the other juniors, they were dumbfounded.

That was a ferocious Celestial beast; how could it have been suppressed by Su Ping that easily?

Most importantly, they didn’t even figure out how it was being suppressed!

Not just them; the Celestial experts were the same. However, they vaguely detected that there was something wrong with Su Ping’s store, as if a terrifying expert was hiding there.

That being was probably a Celestial, if not a stage beyond!
