Chapter 1477 Ancestor (2)

“How should I cultivate once I’m in the Undying State? The world that the Golden Crow ancestor saw is a void. All lives are as insignificant as grains of dust; they can create and destroy everything with ease, including the universe…” Su Ping mumbled while feeling confused.

He could understand the Undying State, and he had already touched it.

However, the ancestral level was beyond his imagination.

What lies beyond the Undying State? How can I continue to become stronger?

The most terrifying fact is that… Even an existence such as that one was killed by the Heavens…

Su Ping’s face was covered with grimness and desperation. Although he had cultivated quickly with the system’s help, and not many were faster than him in all of history, he found it hard to breathe when facing the terrifying Heavens.

“You’ll go back with us for now. It wasn’t easy for you to cultivate; make up for what you did later,” said Su Ping to the Primordial Empyrean Master. He planned to let the guy be for now, because he wanted to read his memories after he reached the Undying State. Then, he would locate the corpse and go there to have a look.

The experts in the Undying State were basically immortal. Su Ping believed that he would be unaffected if he saw the body again; at least the influence wouldn’t be as bad.

The Golden Crow ancestor sleeps all the time. Perhaps, it’s partly for cultivation, and partly for the sake of others…

When you’re too strong, you must learn to live in seclusion, because you’ll disturb and even hurt others with your strength when they see you. That might be the case for any top expert… Su Ping thought.

It might be a good thing that they were hard to come by.

If they were truly seen, they could scare someone to death.

“Okay.”

TIOL

The Primordial Empyrean Master nodded, although he didn’t feel anything special. In his eyes, it was normal for Su Ping not to kill him, having a universe dominator’s cultivation. After all, he was definitely one of humanity’s pillars of humanity.

“Let’s go back now. Sorry, guys. He’s from my clan. Sorry for the trouble he’s caused,” said Su Ping to the cyborg leaders.

Basha and the others exchanged glances and hesitated, but stayed silent in the end.

They wouldn’t have spared the guy in the past. After all, not only did he hit the green glass, he had also yelled loudly, which significantly increased their risk of exposure.

However, Su Ping had said his piece and revealed his terrifying form. None of them dared to disobey.

All of them sensed that Su Ping’s power could easily kill them all when he lost control. He was on a completely different level.

As no objections were raised, Su Ping covered the Planet of Origin with his power and shrank it, turning it into a ball. He held it in his hand and returned with Basha and the others.

Everything was quiet as they made their way back. Su Ping was searching their surroundings with a keen eye, but didn’t detect any of the monsters the cyborgs had mentioned.

He wiped all traces of their presence, being more thorough than the Primordial Empyrean Master.

They were soon back, near the green glass covering. Su Ping moved a finger and made a tiny crack, then led everyone inside.

The old expert followed. Seeing the vast world inside, he remarked with glittering eyes, “It’s true that there can be a whole world in a grain of dust…”

Su Ping thought of something and asked him, “You struck the green glass before. Why did you leave?”

The Primordial Empyrean Master was clearly acting more respectful in Su Ping’s presence. Even if the youngster had just forcefully read his memories, he was smart enough not to let any anger show. He replied casually, “I noticed that something was off, so I came to take a look. I found that it would require a lot of time for me to open this. The Fortune Bell rang just as I was about to keep trying, so I decided to leave in a flash.”

“The Fortune Bell?”

Su Ping was surprised.

“It was an ultimate treasure that I found by accident years ago.” The elder glanced at Su Ping and took out a black bell. “I couldn’t have made all my achievements without it. I would have been just a normal cultivator.”

“So, this is your cheat?”

“Huh?”

“What did you mean when you said it rang?”

“Oh, this Fortune Bell will alert me if something good or bad is about to happen. I survived a lot of dangers thanks to this item,” said the Primordial Empyrean Master with a smile, ‘This is a chaos treasure bound to my soul, and it’ll fall apart if I die. There’s no way to unbind it. One bell for one life.”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. It seemed that the last part was said because the old man feared that he would try snatching the artifact.

However, he was probably telling the truth, since he had frankly confessed the treasure’s usage.

“Let me take a look.” Su Ping extended a hand.

The old man’s lips twitched; he unwillingly handed the item over. He was more or less worried, as normal people wouldn’t try stealing it, but it would be troublesome if Su Ping wanted to try.

“What a strange item. There seems to be a great Dao power sealed within.” Su Ping examined the Fortune Bell and felt as if it were alive. It was even rejecting him.

He looked and confirmed that it was a treasure from the age of chaos. However, it wasn’t born from nature; it was handcrafted.

“You said that this item can predict things. Let’s do an experiment,” said Su Ping.

The Primordial Empyrean Master felt dazed. “How?”

Su Ping gave the bell back to him. Then, his expression changed as he released a surging killing intent.

The old fellow became petrified and his pores were shrinking. The universe in his body popped up behind his back under the stimulation.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

Exactly at that moment—the Fortune Bell rang three times in rapid succession.

The Primordial Empyrean Master narrowed his eyes, knowing that the danger predicted by the bell came from Su Ping.

However, Su Ping dispelled his killing intent and the bell quieted down.

“It’s truly effective…” Su Ping mumbled.

The old man almost cursed aloud. The Fortune Bell only rang because Su Ping was truly going to kill him. If it didn’t ring, maybe he would have truly died!

What a lunatic!

He secretly gritted his teeth. However, since he was weaker, there was nothing he could do.

“So, if you hadn’t left, you would have encountered danger outside the green glass…” Su Ping frowned, while his eyes glittered.

Is it possible that some of the monsters the cyborgs mentioned were still lurking about, even though most of them had left?

His mood took a dive at the thought. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He lacked time to cultivate; however, it seemed that fate was against him. He would never cultivate in peace.

Su Ping heaved a sigh and took the Primordial Empyrean Master back to the Nine States with a heavy heart.

“He will stay with us for now. He won’t cause any more trouble. Sorry for the inconvenience,” said Su Ping as he apologized to the cyborg leaders.

The cyborg trio was much less angry, seeing that Su Ping was being sincere. Their only choice was to drop the matter.

Once they left, Su Ping returned the minimized Planet of Origin to the Primordial Empyrean Master. “This is the continent that the cyborgs have given us; you will live here for now. The territory has already been divided. There’s no place for you; you can live with Chi Ying for now.”

The old expert glanced at Chi Ying, knowing that Su Ping wanted Chi Ying to supervise him. He didn’t refuse. He smiled bitterly and said, “I’m homeless. It’s not bad to have a roof over my head. I’m not picky.”

Su Ping nodded and glanced at Chi Ying, who understood the intention and nodded back at him.

After helping the Primordial Empyrean Master settle down, Su Ping spoke to his master telepathically. He planned to raise a few more universe dominators, so that there would be enough people supervising the newcomer while he was away.

As for the monsters outside the green glass, Su Ping intended to make the Primordial Empyrean Master keep an eye on them. The guy’s Fortune Bell had useful potential.

I simply want to cultivate in peace for 100,000 years. I hope that nothing happens… Su Ping prayed in his heart.
