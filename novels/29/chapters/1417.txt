Chapter 1419 One Finger (1)

In the midst of exploding energy, Su Ping tore the God Emperor apart and stepped through his remains. Surrounded by flames, he was the only monarch of the world!

He gave his enemies an aggressive look. “Weren’t you going to kill me? Why are you still not doing anything?”

His demand woke them up. They felt humiliation and anger.

One of the emperors couldn’t take it anymore and dashed with a roar, “I’m going to cut off your head!” He was like a dragon from barbaric times. The universe behind his back glowed, as if about to suppress both time and space completely.

Countless scary ghosts surrounded his body, their ghastly appearance made them look like hellspawn. They were all the enemies that he had killed; their souls were restrained, becoming part of his combat ability.

All those ghosts were roaring and charging fiercely at the moment. They were going to overturn the world, like the masters of hell itself.

“You’re so old… You should just lie down and rot!”

Su Ping’s eyes were brilliant. He suddenly stomped in the sky. An enormous bare foot appeared out of nowhere, imposing such a strong pressure that all the ghosts screamed in fear.

The emperor roared and turned into a black blade, cutting time and space and piercing through the sky. His attack went directly into Su Ping’s consciousness; it was unavoidable!

Su Ping wasn’t planning on dodging, though. Without losing any of his momentum, he stepped down and caused trembling waves in the entire Rain Clan within a thousand years.

The black blade—that emperor’s transformation-was knocked from the high sky and went into the depths of the shattered space, where space turbulence was rampant. It was so dangerous that normal God Kings would not dare step in.

However, the guy was an emperor; the deep space alone wasn’t enough to kill him. However, his body was at the moment unable to move underneath Su Ping’s foot, and he could only tolerate the corrosion of the power, which felt like ants biting.

“You!!”

The emperor’s eyes were almost popping out, suffused with shock and fury. He was an unparalleled emperor, among those who dominated the world of gods; even the emperors of the seven greatest clans would treat him with respect. However, he was at the moment under Su Ping’s foot like a dead dog. How humiliating!

“Looks like you’re nothing more than ants!”

Su Ping’s disdainful voice was heard up close. High above the enormous bare foot, in the midst of the infinite darkness, his cold and brilliant eyes were looking down indifferently, like a deity would.

After he said that, the bare foot unleashed infinite light. The emperor was crushed to bits before he could struggle; even his soul had been obliterated. He was completely minced by the Great Dao! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Tianzhan and the others were late reinforcements; all of them trembled with fury after seeing that happen. The emperors, whose growth could take 100,000 years, had died in succession by Su Ping’s hand.

“Summon the ancestor’s soul with my blood!!” Lin Tianzhan growled all of a sudden, no longer as casual as before; he switched to a wounded beast mode, violent and ferocious. His body was ablaze with a dazzling divine power. Even the wake of his energy was spread for thousands of kilometers. He looked like a glittering sun.

His fellow emperors were terrified by what he said, but they also realized that holding back was no longer impossible. The little monster was unimaginably powerful… They had to suppress him with that move!

“Summon the ancestor’s soul with my blood!!”

“Summon the ancestor’s soul with my blood!!!”

The sky above the Rain Clan changed as the emperors roared indignantly. Or rather, the entire Rain Clan’s territory was going through some sort of change.

Even the people in the small cities at the border of the Rain Clan’s territory—which was billions of kilometers away from the battlefield-somehow felt a chilling coldness in the air. It was as if the cities themselves would have turned into the stomachs of enormous pythons. Everybody felt scared.

“The ancestor’s soul…”

The Rain Emperor, who was stopping Yan Qing and the other elders, suddenly looked back at the battlefield in an unimaginable distant point in time and space. There was shock in his eyes. He had already asked Lin Tianzhan and the other old-generation monsters to take action. Were they incapable of finishing the guy off? Did they have to burn their souls and blood to summon our ancestor’s soul?! “What are you doing?!”

Yan Qing and the others, still detained in the Rain Emperor’s universe, somehow felt scared. They could barely sense the outside world, and something gave them a chill; something horrifying had happened to the world.

“Summon the ancestor’s soul?”

Su Ping slightly changed his expression upon hearing the call. He had read about that secret technique from certain classified books in the Heaven Path Institute’s library and was unique to the high-ranked clans. They could briefly summon the soul power of their Ancestral God after using blood from the clan’s direct descendants. It was a terrifying move, which was also protection granted by their Ancestral God to the experts of their clan.

Even if they were fighting countless light years away, they could still use that trump card to save their lives.

That was also the reason why the high-ranked clans could look down on other races, even if they fought against equals; they had the support of an Ancestral God. Asking the Ancestral God to show up was unnecessary. They could suppress the enemy by merely summoning his soul. How could their peers have the slightest chance to fight them?
