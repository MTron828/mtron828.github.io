Chapter 1276 Merging of Universes (1)

“Master,” said Su Ping to the young man before him.

He dispelled the chaos force field; Song Yuan and the others walked out.

“You’re the only ones left?”

The young man slightly changed his expression after seeing them. He said, “I’m sorry that you were caught in this Celestial battle. Thank you for your sacrifice.”

Song Yuan recognized their master’s aura, realizing it was his clone; they felt both lucky and sad. They offered greetings and then fell silent.

“Old Huo, I owe you one; I’ll return the favor later,” said the young man to Chi Huo.

Slightly stunned, Chi Huo shrugged and said, “Don’t talk like that. It’s me who owes Brother Su one. I would have been in hot water if it weren’t for him. The Saint King was acting so unscrupulously that he was also ready to kill me.”

“Brother Su?”

The young man looked at Su Ping while slightly dazed, soon able to notice something unusual. Su Ping had indeed concealed his aura, but his master detected a profound power inside his body; one that would cause an extraordinary shock if released.

Chi Huo explained the situation, “Your original self was executed, so it’s natural that you don’t know what happened. Brother Su somehow broke through, then he killed the Saint King and fed him to his pet. That guy’s sordid disciple was also caught by Brother

Su.”

Shen Huang was truly astounded.

Su Ping killed the Saint King?

He even captured his disciple alive

“You…”

Shen Huang looked at Su Ping in disbelief. How could Su Ping, who used to be a mere Star Lord, achieve such a formidable leap?

Su Ping felt depressed due to his master’s disbelief. He explained, “I’ve just reached the Ascendant State; it wasn’t difficult to finish them off. Master, I will surely help you reach the Celestial State again.”

Besides Shen Huang, Chi Huo and his disciples were lost for words after such a declaration.

The reason he could kill the Saint King was that he broke through to the Ascendant State?

They had never seen anyone who could kill beings of higher realms with such ease. Furthermore, it was to kill a Celestial while being an Ascendant, just like an ordinary person killing an Ocean State battle pet warrior. It was crazy!

“Brother Su is indeed an unparalleled genius.” Chi Huo chuckled dryly, not knowing what else to say. He thought that Su Ping had acquired some sort of treasure; little did he expect to find that the man had only reached the Ascendant State.

He was already that strong in that realm.

They couldn’t have accepted the fact since Su Ping could fight a Celestial after reaching the Ascendant State; after all, it was remarkable enough to fight top Heavenly Lords while still being a Star Lord. However, Su Ping slew Celestial cultivators like dogs. It was unbelievable!

“Had I known this, I wouldn’t have asked you to compete over the universe dominator’s legacy. I underestimated you…” Shen Huang snapped out of his stupor and smiled bitterly.

He had previously thought that it wouldn’t be difficult for Su Ping to enter the Celestial State, and that the latter would become one of the top experts once he made the breakthrough.

However, to his surprise, Su Ping was an eye-opener again.

He was able to kill Celestials while still being an Ascendant. Advancing to the Celestial State would only make him even stronger.

A genius of such caliber was definitely qualified to become a universe dominator following his own path!

“It’s all in the past. Something’s wrong with the crack in the universe found in the Mayhem Star Zone. It’s unclear whether the ancient corpse can block it. If not, maybe our universe will soon be invaded by another universe dominator. Master, stay on Rhea near my store for the time being.”

Su Ping said to all the people present in a solemn tone, “If we’re in danger, I’ll be able to ensure your safety even if the universe dominator comes.”

Everybody was stunned. They looked at Su Ping in disbelief.

He can protect us, even if the universe dominator showed up?

All of them had heard a thing or two about the ancient magic store, Su Ping’s backing. But, was the store really that powerful?

Suddenly it dawned on them. No wonder Su Ping is such a genius; how could such a monster be raised without an unimaginable being as a backer?

“An invader coming through the crack? A dominator?”

Shen Huang was slightly stunned by Su Ping’s briefing.

Chi Huo then pointed at the clone, sending all the relevant information in a wisp of light. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Shen Huang stayed silent, quickly accepting the feed and realizing what had happened after his death. The information included the image when Su Ping killed the Saint King and fed the pieces to his pet. Such an image was much more shocking than a simple description.

Su Ping also remained silent, fearing that something could happen in the Mayhem Star Zone. If the unknown creature in the crack dealt with the ancient corpse, it would probably be powerful enough to reach them in a flash. They would be in grave danger by then, even if they were standing right outside the store.

He led everyone to the Celestial Court’s orbit where Rhea was spinning around.

Su Ping went back to Rhea and returned to his store.

Chi Huo wasn’t one for courteously declining the offer; the unknown danger beyond the crack frightened him. Su Ping was at the moment confident of resisting a universe dominator, so he was fine with staying on that unremarkable planet for the time being.

All of them quickly followed Su Ping and went to his tiny pet store.
