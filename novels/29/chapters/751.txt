Chapter 753: Business and Sales

Once the training for the first batch of Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons was over, the white-scaled dragon was already capable of fighting against an early-phase Void State beast.

All the beasts living in the dangerous lands of the Demigod Burial were brutal. If those trained dragons were in the outside world, they would already be able to handle mid-phase Void State foes.

Su Ping decided to go deeper into the dangerous territories when the turn for the second batch of dragons came; three of them were at the Fate State.

He came across many Fate State beasts, with the occasional one at the Star State.

The drakeling had just become accustomed to Void State foes, but it was soon facing Fate State enemies; it was cornered and pushed to its limits again.

Apart from rapidly growing drakeling, the Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon and the Purple Python had also benefited a lot from the battles. They were more familiarized with the power of laws that Su Ping had taught them and they could fuse it with their own skills.

Adding the exotic fruits they ate on the way, their combat ability was further improved. The Purple Python’s even reached 99 points!

Su Ping felt a headache when he met such a limit again.

But he wasn’t too anxious this time; if he could perceive another law and teach it to the Purple Python, its combat ability would probably surpass the hundred mark!

The training in the Demigod Burial made the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons panic; the Fate State trio was even appalled.

None of them had been aware that the human kept such a horrifying secret!

They had never been to that place, and the beasts were entirely different from those on the Rumbling Thunder Continent. Most of them carried a sacred aura and were able to unleash a much greater strength.

One of the older dragons—which actually had an advanced Fate State level—was even taught a lesson by a mid Fate State beast.

However, all of them showed quick growth when Su Ping revived and healed them.

Su Ping was not afraid that the pets would leak the secret after they left. Thanks to the binding power of the almighty power of the system, they would never be able to reveal any secrets of the cultivation sites, even if they learned the human language.

The silencing ability was beyond what Su Ping could understand.

Time zipped by.

The sun rose and the stars fell on planet Rhea. The night was over.

Many people had gathered on the street when it was barely dawn.

This street was particularly lively on that day.

If one were to make a turn on that street, there would be a young Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon standing outside a pet shop named Stars. The creature was a dozen meters long and could be considered a teenager.

The street was so wide that the dragon didn’t block the way whatsoever.

Next to the young dragon were several female employees who were promoting the store’s specials.

“The Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons are on sale!”

“New Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons with B+ qualities are waiting for you!”

Not every customer was interested. Lots of hunters were trying to catch Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons on Rhea in that time of year and many battle pet warriors made the trip on spaceships to buy them.

Therefore, many pet shops offered special discounts on those dragons so they wouldn’t miss out.

All those pet shops either had their own training bases or hired professional hunters to catch dragons on the Rumbling Thunder Continent.

While the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were popular, they were available in a lot of shops; only those with high quality could attract attention.

B+ quality was already high for a beast!

Further above was the A quality, which couldn’t be acquired without strenuous training; such dragons were the best in their clan.

Some customers were soon attracted to that shop by the B+ quality advertising.

“I was told that someone sells Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons on this street. Is it this shop?”

“I don’t think so. I remember that the place is called Pixie Pet Store. That’s quite easy to remember.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“But there’s also dragons available in this shop with B+ quality. Should we take a look at it?”

More and more customers were attracted and started to gather outside the shop. Some of the customers—who had visited Su Ping’s shop the day prior—found it impossible to squeeze in, so they simply went to Su Ping’s shop.

However, they found that Su Ping’s shop was still closed when they got there.

It’s already nine o’clock... The shop hasn’t opened yet?

Many people were speechless. Some even wondered if the shop owner was frustrated by the B+ quality pets in the other store and preferred not to be eclipsed by them.

“The shop is still not open? I’ll pass.”

“Let’s go back to the first shop and see how much the B+ dragons go for.”

Many people ran out of patience outside of Su Ping’s shop and were about to leave.

Right at that moment—

Su Ping’s shop was opened.

This many people?

Hardly had he opened the shop when he found dozens of people outside. He was slightly surprised, but not too much. After all, the arrival of ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons was quite a good marketing strategy.

Tang Ruyan and Zhong Lingtong were still learning the Common Tongue, so Su Ping would have to welcome the customers on his own.

“Come on in, please,” said Su Ping after he turned around and entered the shop.

“Hurry, hurry!”

A lot of people had glittering eyes when Su Ping opened the shop. After all, a shop able to take in ten dragons in one go surely had a powerful background, and the dragons themselves couldn’t be too bad.

Even if they weren’t B quality, C quality would still be fine as it was more affordable to most people.

Not everybody was seeking A-quality ultimate pets, which were only affordable to the wealthy. Most people would settle for one that was good enough.

They would at the very least be happy if they could summon one. Who could tell the quality of a pet from its appearance?

“Boss, where are the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons?”

“Are they available today? I want to buy one!”

“I was already here yesterday! Boss, I came first!”

Many people swarmed into the shop.

After seeing so many people rushing in, Su Ping quickly said, “Line up! Line up! No fighting!”

One brawny man yelled in the crowd and squeezed his way to the front. “Get lost! I came here first! Get out of the way!”

The brawny man emitted a Void State aura which intimidated the others. The person who lost his spot to the man was an Ocean State battle pet warrior; he was angry but unwilling to argue against the rude fellow.

“As I said, don’t fight. Please go back to your position,” said Su Ping coldly after seeing that happen.

The brawny man had just gotten in the position he stole. He was stunned to hear what Su Ping told him and replied with an angry tone, “Boss, mind your own business. When did I fight? He gave his place to me willingly. Anyway, hurry up and stop wasting our time!”

He saw that Su Ping was only an Ocean State warrior, so he didn’t consider him a big deal.

That was indeed a powerful shop, since they had been able to catch ten dragons, that young man was definitely not the one who did it. The burly man saw Su Ping as a mere representative of the real owner.

Su Ping became completely cold after his response. He said, “Please leave. You’re not welcome in this shop.”

“What?”

The brawny man almost couldn’t believe his ears; the other customers were just as surprised. The victim didn’t even complain, but the owner is going to oust the guy anyway?

The brawny man was furious after hearing what Su Ping said; he laughed in fury and quickly snapped, “You’re asking me to leave? I’m here to buy three Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons. Do you even know who I am? Do you know how much money I have?”

Su Ping said indifferently. “I don’t care who you are. My shop, my rules. Anna, throw him out!”

“Yes, sir.”

Joanna, who was standing by the pet room door, accepted the task and casually approached the brawny man.
