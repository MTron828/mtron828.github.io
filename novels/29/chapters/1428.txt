Chapter 1429 Tribulation on Behalf of the Heavens (1)

Chi Ying’s senses recovered instantly, no longer blocked by the store when he entered. There was an immediate feeling, an immeasurable aura that stood like a mountain. All his pores were shrinking beyond his control. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The store was quiet. There was only the occasional voice asking the name and condition of a certain.

Chi Ying looked at the source of the sound and noticed a man squatting in front of a ferocious beast, asking it to open its mouth. He placed his head in front of the scary big mouth and looked inside, completely at ease.

The pet was extremely obedient. Like a statue, it sat still with its mouth wide open. There was some fear in its eyes, as if afraid of something terrifying taking place by doing something wrong.

This is a truly horrifying pet store… Chi Ying thought.

“Boss Su.”

He immediately walked over with a warm smile on his face. His greeting was humble, without the arrogance he formerly showed during the conference.

Su Ping nodded and leaned back after some examination. He said to the battle pet’s master, “It’s been eating assorted foods, which resulted in blood maggots growing in its mouth. You must ask it to take care of its own hygiene. This time, I’ll do the cleaning for free.”

The middle-aged man felt truly flattered. He quickly replied, “How can I accept your service for free? Boss Su, just name a price, or I will feel uneasy.”

“This isn’t important.” Su Ping waved his hand, leaving the matter to rest. He invoked the power of Dao and simply eliminated the blood maggots found between the pet’s teeth. Those bugs weren’t simple; they were the cause for massive headaches, even for that Ascendant State beast, as it couldn’t kill them. It had to look for a doctor for assistance.

However, considering Su Ping’s level, he could address the problem even without having any facility or experience.

“Thank you very much, Boss Su.”

The middle-aged man quickly offered thanks, not insisting on the money part. Money was like garbage for people as powerful as Su Ping; insisting would be taken as an insult. He said timidly, “The usual ecosystem’s cycle disappeared ever since we left our old universe. Wind Spirit Birds used to be the ones able to get rid of all the pet’s food residue, but they should be extinct now, unless someone contracted one of them.”

Su Ping fell silent. They could only save their own kind first when they left their home. Humans weren’t the only life forms in the boundless universe.

Aside from humans, many species were destroyed along with the universe.

“One day, we will return to our universe and our hometown!” said Chi Ying nearby; however, it sounded like encouragement.

Such an answer left the middle-aged man shocked for a moment. He was quick to realize who it was and quickly offered a respectful bow.

Chi Ying waved hand right after. He then looked at Su Ping and stood with a solemn and pious manner.

“Follow me,” Su Ping said to Chi Ying.

“All right.”

Chi Ying nodded obediently; he was both anxious and hopeful. He was currently like a model student in school who followed Su Ping dutifully.

The latter took him to the test room, which had a boundless space.

Su Ping had at first thought that it was some sort of developed technology. But at this moment, he realized that it was a sophisticated Dao application.

After entering the room, Su Ping asked casually, “Why did they send you first?”

Chi Ying was instantly shocked. He swiftly replied, “Shen Huang asked us to draw lots. I was really lucky to get to be the first.”

“A fair election…” Su Ping was enlightened. No wonder his master didn’t want him to misunderstand. However, he didn’t really care; he would have been more relieved if Chi Huo or Xu Kong were picked first.

However, since they had set their own rules, Su Ping didn’t really care; it was only a matter of time, anyway.

“Are you ready?” Su Ping looked at him.

Chi Ying was rather anxious. “D-Do I have to make preparations?”

“The pursuit of the Great Dao is always risky. Are you ready in case you die here?” asked Su Ping.

Chi Ying’s heart was racing. He asked prudently, “Boss Su, is the risk that high? I’m not really that talented. I’m worried…”

“It isn’t too risky. As long as you’re determined enough, I don’t think anything bad will happen,” said Su Ping casually. Actually, the risk involved when imparting the Great Dao was very low, or he wouldn’t have offered assistance. He only said it to test the receiver’s faith; it would be a waste if the recipients of the three unparalleled Dao Hearts weren’t determined enough.

Moreso, the three unparalleled Dao Hearts couldn’t have been developed easily. Their creation involved a lot of hard work.

“Well…”

Chi Ying felt like crying; he had never been told about the risk. He suddenly realized why Shen Huang didn’t use his privilege and simply went with a fair selection.

It’s true that nothing good is free in this world… Chi Ying smiled bitterly.

Su Ping remained silent, simply staring at the hopeful Celestial. He could tell from the flashing bitterness in the man’s eyes that there was some hesitation.

“Have you decided?” he asked.

Chi Ying’s heart shook. Seeing the young man’s peaceful eyes, he somehow found the courage and thus took a deep breath. “I’m ready. On the off chance I die trying, it’ll only prove that I wasn’t talented enough. This is the only opportunity in my life to become a universe dominator. I hope that I can seize it!”
