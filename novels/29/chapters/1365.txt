Chapter 1366 Transcending the Tribulation (2)

He chose to teach them the law of illusion and build the Illusory World with it. Even though such a world wasn’t too destructive, it was very useful when it came to survival. Su Ping hoped that all of them would return alive.

Back in the Archean Divinity, the God Emperor elders could publicly transmit their understanding of Dao.

Not even Celestials could do that, because their realm was merely at the threshold to the understanding of Dao.

Su Ping wasn’t a God Emperor yet, but he was already halfway there. Imparting knowledge wasn’t difficult for him, especially when it was just about laws.

After covering them in barriers, Su Ping simply transmitted the law of illusion into their minds. Meanwhile, he released a bit of chaos power to them.

That bit of power surged like waves and soon raised a storm inside their bodies, turning into the cornerstone of their small worlds.

Su Ping guided them via telepathy. He was essentially controlling their bodies and helping them cultivate.

Very soon, they began to emanate Star Lord auras, and their strength grew.

While Xingyue Shen’er and the others watched in shock, the shapes of small worlds appeared behind their backs soon after. Their level of completeness increased, and they emitted a mysterious yet powerful aura.

“He really did it!” one of them said, obviously amazed.

“Why do I feel that it’s even more powerful than my small world?”

“What an illusory aura.”

......

There was envy in some people’s eyes, realizing how extraordinary those guys’ small worlds were.

Soon after, Su Ping canceled the barriers and said to them, “The Heavenly Tribulation is blocked inside this store. You will have to go through it once you leave. Still, it should be easy for you with the protection of Ascendant State pets.”

Those people opened their eyes and couldn’t help but examine themselves after hearing what Su Ping said. They were thrilled as they sensed the abundant power in their bodies. They never expected to become Star Lords so easily.

“The Heavenly Tribulation is being blocked?”

Everyone else was shocked again, after processing what Su Ping mentioned. Is this the power of a Celestial State master?

Xingyue Shen’er’s father was just as shocked. Su Ping’s methods were beyond his imagination.

“Go and pick your pets,” said Su Ping. Everyone snapped out of their shock, but mixed feelings remained. They knew that the gap between them and Su Ping was huge, but never did they imagine it would be as huge as that between mortals and gods.

Xingyue Shen’er wore a complicated expression. Su Ping was merely in the Star State and she could beat him easily when they first met. Still, he quickly managed to reach a height she couldn’t even see. His capabilities were completely beyond her understanding. Is this what talent means?

She dismissed her thoughts, knowing it was pointless to think about it. She followed her father to see the Ascendant State pets and pick to her liking.

The beasts crouched on the ground obediently while everybody was choosing. They looked angry, as if ready to lunge at any moment, but they were being restrained by some sort of power.

Thankfully, Su Ping was right next to them. All of them were scared, but they gritted their teeth and went to see them.

Soon after, someone picked a pet and completed the contract.

Su Ping asked the person to freely test and command their pet there, so that they would become more intimate.

Soon, earthquakes shook the test room as many secret techniques were cast, causing a large-scale destruction. However, the damage was fixed in the blink of an eye.

A long time later, Su Ping led everyone out after they completed their contracts and finished testing.

They walked out of the test room and were less scared of their pets. Although the pets looked ferocious, they were extremely obedient, which was a delight.

“Thank you for your great help.” Xingyue Shen’er’s father cupped his hands at Su Ping gratefully.

The others also rushed to express their thanks.

Su Ping waved a hand and said, “We’re all friends; no need to thank me. You’ll be embarking on a perilous journey. I hope that you’ll be careful. I’ll prepare another great gift for your safe return.”

Someone asked curiously, “What great gift?”

Su Ping smiled but didn’t answer. “You’ll know when you return.”

Xingyue Shen’er slapped the head of the person who asked, and said angrily, “Su Ping only hopes that we can return in one piece. What more do you want?”

The guy stuck out his tongue and smiled awkwardly.

“I will surely bring them all back,” said Xingyue Shen’er to Su Ping. She was both perky and serious, as if she were making a vow.

Su Ping nodded and walked them out.

Right after they left the store, the sky was instantly filled by clouds; the Heavenly Tribulation was invoked.

“Indeed, there’s indeed a Heavenly Tribulation!”

All the new Star Lords looked up at the sky, searching for the tribulation source.

Other people on the street were also astonished.

The ones who summoned the tribulation flew to the sky and passed their test, attracting a lot of attention.

The lightning bolts struck down. Their new Ascendant pets took action and blocked all the lightning strikes. The Heavenly Tribulation was over.

Once passing the tribulation, they landed and thanked Su Ping solemnly again.

The latter stood at the door and bid them goodbye.

He felt lost as he watched them leave, wondering if any of them would be missing next time he saw them.

He shook his head; there were things he couldn’t stop even if he were omnipotent. Each person had their own decision, their own life, and their own faith; Su Ping couldn’t interfere.

He returned to his store and continued exercising in cultivation sites.

Time flew.

In the World of Magical Beasts

Su Ping was sitting on a cliff, bones piled up underneath his feet. There was a commotion in the vast forest down below. The Inferno Dragon, the Lightning Rat and the Dark Dragon Hound were hunting beasts and making a scene.

He was drinking a spicy and strange liquor from a bottle made from a stomach. It was a local specialty.

Next to Su Ping was a brawny, human-shaped beast. His golden eyes were glittering, with hair unkempt, like a primitive barbarian.

“Brother Su, does someone as strong as you have worries too?” The Magical Beast spoke hoarsely.

Su Ping looked at him and said, “Every living creature has worries. Come to think of it, your child was just born; I don’t have anything special for you. It just so happens that I killed a Chaos Sorcerer not long ago. That’ll be my gift for your child.”

The guy was a local he had befriended in that world.

He was also the young master of a certain tribe, talented and strong. At the moment he was already a Celestial.

“A Chaos Sorcerer? That’s a great gift,” said Aryado, “Brother Su, your world must be very vast. It can’t be as tiny as our place.”

Su Ping shook his head. “It’s not much different. The tiny place you’re familiar with is only the area you’re in. Beyond the surrounding ocean there are other places and more of your compatriots. However, those regions are even more dangerous. It’s fine to just stay here.”

“Is that so?”

Aryado became interested. “Have you been to any of those places? Can you tell me?” Su Ping smiled and then told him about the general situation of some places he had randomly teleported to. One of them listened and the other talked. Su Ping finished his retelling by the time the battle in the forest ended. He stood up and said, “I have to go.” “I really envy you, Brother Su. You can travel everywhere,” said Aryado.

Su Ping smiled. “If there’s a chance, we’ll be able to travel together. You can break through this universe and truly regain freedom when you reach higher levels.”

Aryado shook his head. “My potential is running out. Maybe I’ll have to rely on my child in the future.”

“Maybe. I didn’t get a chance to see your child this time. See you then,” said Su Ping.

Even though that world was full of brutal magical beasts, many of them had gained wisdom, such as the primitive human beings. Also, they attached great importance to lineage; they had few children, and most of them had better potential than their parents.

“Okay.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Su Ping bid his friend goodbye, then looked at the Lightning Rat and his other pets, then beckoned to them and simply teleported back to his store, right in front of Aryado’s eyes.

Aryado was then left alone on the cliff.

“Maybe we will meet again in the future…” Aryado mumbled.
