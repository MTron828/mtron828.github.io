Chapter 1332 Celestial State Meeting (1)

“They will be my representatives. They’ll do the talking with whoever disobeys.” Su Ping planned to enslave them and have them work as his muscles to make the best use of them.

However, he still had to go to the Heaven Path Institute and find a way to control God Kings.

He had seen enslaving techniques in the institute’s library, there were definitely ways to control them.

“Will they be obedient?” asked Xu Kong.

She was quite considerate. Her wariness when dealing with Su Ping grew; he could naturally suppress them if he could detain two Celestials. If Su Ping wanted to become a dictator… Since the Primordial Empyrean Master had died, nobody in the universe could stop him.

“I will make them obey,” said Su Ping.

Shen Huang glanced at his disciple, knowing he wouldn’t make empty promises. Besides, there was the powerful and mysterious store backing him. He said, “In that case, I will make them bend.”

“When will the meeting be convened?” asked Su Ping.

“Right now. They just reached out to us, and we came to inform Shen Huang. Since Brother Su is also here, why don’t we all participate? We can bring her with us,” said Chi Huo.

Kayafollet remained expressionless. She knew she had to listen to Su Ping for now, and felt lucky since he only wanted her to resist the worms, so she still had value. She could look for a way to escape if she was sent to the battlefield.

“All right; let’s go and take a look.” Su Ping nodded. He wouldn’t act friendly to Celestials who were busy with infighting while disaster was afoot.

Almost all of humanity was united when the Blue Planet was almost destroyed. Those Celestials were far stronger in comparison, and yet they couldn’t make the right decisions. It was hilarious.

“In on the Astral Nexus. Shen Huang, invite Brother Su.” Chi Huo waved his hand, and they were all transferred to a boundless space. Su Ping and all the others were present. The menu of the Astral Nexus was displayed in front of Chi Huo’s head as he sank his consciousness into it.

“Despite the worm assault, the Astral Nexus hasn’t been badly damaged yet. Only some of the remote space stations were destroyed,” said Shen Huang to Su Ping, “Enter the Astral Nexus. I’ll invite you to the meeting room.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping said to Kayafollet, “Better come too.”

Kayafollet gave him a slight nod. Both of them entered the Astral Nexus through their watches soon after. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Su Ping received his master’s invite and entered the meeting as soon as he got online.

He chose to accept, and the world changed before his eyes, finding himself in a brilliant space where there was an extremely long table. On the two sides of the table were ancient chairs that carried an ancient aura.

Many were seated on those chairs at the moment. They were releasing terrifying auras.

While Su Ping looked around, he suddenly heard a displeased voice. “Why are there two more people? Who brought them in?”

Su Ping looked at the source of the sound, only to discover that it was a tall and handsome young man with crimson long hair. He had an elbow on one of the chair’s armrests, which made him seem to be at ease.

“I brought them here. You have a problem with that?” Shen Huang’s face turned cold. Even though his original body had been destroyed and he was only as strong as a Heavenly Lord, he would not stand for any challenges.

“Chi Ying, don’t ask for trouble. He is Shen Huang’s disciple, Brother Su, and she is Kayafollet, the Saint King’s heir from this generation. Both of them are Celestials,” said Chi Huo coldly.

The Red Fire Star Zone and the Red Shadow Star Zone were never compatible. They despised each other.

“Huh?”

Everyone was more or less intrigued after hearing Chi Huo’s introduction. They had obviously heard a thing or two about Su Ping; all of them had sent their representatives to fight for the legacy in the Mayhem Star Zone. Ye Chen had been too busy dealing with Su Ping back then, and didn’t attack the people from the other star zones.

Therefore, except for those who died inside the ancient corpse, the rest returned safely and informed their factions.

“The young man who fought Ye Chen? And the Saint King’s heir who obtained the legacy?”

All of them glanced at Su Ping and Kayafollet. They had seen her before; after all, how could they not pay attention to the Saint King’s heir?

Su Ping actually attracted more attention.

That was the name they had heard most frequently in recent days.

In a mere span of a hundred years, he had won the Universe Geniuses’ Contest and even fought someone in the Ascendant State while being a realm lower. It was also said that he was as strong as a Heavenly Lord, even though he had yet to reach the Ascendant State!

The last news they heard was that Su Ping fought Ye Chen, Mo Ri and the others until he rose to the Ascendant State.

Even though auras could be concealed while in the Astral Nexus, it was still possible to infer someone’s real level by gathering some information. Celestials in particular; they could check if Su Ping was hiding anything.

“He truly is in the Ascendant State…”

Many eyes present were glittering as they gauged Su Ping’s actual level.

Ignoring those curious and suspicious gazes, Su Ping looked around and noticed that only seven of the sixteen thrones had been occupied.
