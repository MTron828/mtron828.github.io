Chapter 483 Riding the Beast King

Even though Tang Ruyan was surprised by Su Ping’s answer, she believed that he could very likely win first place, given how he had easily overwhelmed the Tang Family elders who were at the peak of the titled rank.

Tang Ruyan was itchy for a try. “Can you take me with you? The store will be closed with you gone anyway. I’ll have nothing to do here.”

Su Ping darted her a glance of contempt. “Who said I would close the store? Joanna will be too busy by herself. You two will help her.”

Tang Ruyan pouted. She couldn’t even find an excuse to retort.

She quickly lost interest anyway. She remembered that it was likely that she would meet some elders from the Tang Family at the Supremacy League; she was not in a mood to see any member of her family at the moment.

Zhong Lingtong remained silent. She was dying to ask when Su Ping would start teaching her training skills but feared to ask, shy and timid as she was.

Su Ping saw that Qin Duhuang and his old friend were playing chess outside the door of his store. He looked at the door of the other building; he saw Mu Beihai sitting in a brand new desk that was absolutely unfit for that old building. Mu Beihai was going through some files while dealing with family matters.

These guys really were going all out.

Su Ping shook his head. At the thought of the Supremacy League, he decided to call Qin Duhuang Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Duhuang was surprised to hear Su Ping shout his name. He was gloating inwardly. “Yes, Mr. Su?”

Mu Beihai took his eyes off the files. He gazed at Su Ping, nervously. Zhou Tianlin and Liu Tianzong had both stopped what they were doing. They were feeling a lot of pressure. Was Su Ping going to sell pets again?

Everyone was getting ready for a sprint.

“I heard that the Supremacy League has started. Aren’t you going to participate?” Su Ping asked. The Supremacy League had begun but it didn’t seem that Qin Duhuang and the other guys were going.

Everyone breathed in relief and at the same time; they were disappointed, though. Liu Tianzong stood up and explained, “Mr. Su, you don’t know this but the Supremacy League is for young talents like you. Old guys like us are half-buried in the ground. We’re not suitable candidates anymore.”

Even though Su Ping had asked for half of the Liu Family’s assets and almost left them broke, Liu Tianzong no longer hated Su Ping. For one thing, Su Ping had the legendary battle pet warrior backing him. For another, Su Ping himself was intimidating enough; it was possible that he could grow to become a legendary battle pet warrior himself.

All Liu Tianzong wanted to do now was to better his relationship with Su Ping. If Su Ping were to add the Liu Family to the blacklist and deliberately avoid the Liu Family when he sold pets in the future, then the Liu Family would be really doomed. Sooner or later, the Liu Family would be crushed by other families, eventually being forced to leave the Longjiang Base City.

Qin Duhuang glared at Liu Tianzong for answering the question first. You’re too chatty! “Mr. Su, are you participating?” Qin Duhuang asked with a smile, “Given your strength, I think winning the championship will be a piece of cake for you. I heard that the winning price is quite miraculous. It is something that can enable a pet to pick up a talent! A pet with a talent skill is hard to come by. Mr. Su, this is a chance you cannot miss!” “I will go soon.” Su Ping asked, “Which place could you win if you were to take part?” Liu Tianzong grabbed the chance again. “Mr. Su, don’t worry. You’ll be No.1 and that is for sure. As for us, entering the Top 10 will be good enough for us. After all, some shameless old guys from other base cities will join in the competition. All of the Top 10 winners will be at the peak of the titled rank.”

Qin Duhuang was furious. Can’t you see that Mr. Su is talking to me? Why are you butting in?!

“Peak of the titled rank...” Su Ping nodded.

Without further ado, Su Ping went to the store and opened the door.

The customers also heard the conversation which baffled them. Supremacy League? The peak of the titled rank? None of those words was something they could understand.

Tang Ruyan and Zhong Lingtong started their job as the greeters as soon as the door was opened. Now and then, they would pick up something for Su Ping or run some errands.

“I’m here for my pet.”

Xu Yingxue stood in front of the counter to pick up the pet she had left there the day before. Su Ping still remembered her. He browsed through the record, found her pet, and told Joanna to take the pet out.

Soon, Xu Yingxue’s seventh rank pet was taken to the storefront.

The pet was so different from before that Xu Yingxue had almost failed to recognize it. The contact and the bond told her that it was indeed her pet. Still, the violence in its eyes and the killing intent coming off from the pet had filled her with apprehension!

How could this have happened after just one day!

Zhong Lingtong, who was talking to the customers, was just as startled. Shy as she was, she was quite observant. She still remembered the pet of the element family. After all, that pet was a rare one and the lady chose the professional training package. She was curious as to what the professional training was like. What she was seeing made her question if something had happened to her eyes.

This was after the professional training?

It was practically a different pet!

One day and such drastic change... That training had to be comprehensive, covering the pet’s natural traits, strength and energy, and... Everything! How could that have been done in one day?!

“Your pet’s combat strength can compare to the average ninth-rank beasts. You are welcome to find out in the test room. I wrote down the names of the new skills on this note,” Su Ping stated. He had become more proficient in his job as time passed. He would write down the achievements of the training for each pet on a sticky note. That way, the pet’s masters would immediately find out what was different about their pets. Xu Yingxue could not believe this. “Ninth-rank beast?”

Her pet was at the seventh rank and after just one day, he told her that her pet could compare to a beast of the ninth rank?!

Impossible!

She had heard that the training in Su Ping’s store was marvelous and she did feel nervous standing in front of her pet. “So, I’m going to test the progress of my pet... okay?” she said, hesitating “Yep.”

Su Ping nodded and told Tang Ruyan to take Xu Yingxue to the test room.

After Xu Yingxue left, Zhong Lingtong could no longer hold back her curiosity. She summoned enough courage, went to the counter, and asked Su Ping, “Sir, was that really something called training? How can you achieve that in merely one day?”

As far as she could tell, not even a top trainer could have done that within such a short time.

Su Ping didn’t blame her for asking. He left her with a thought-provoking answer, “What matters is not how much time you have, but how you use the time!”

Tong Lingtong nodded, still half confused.

Su Ping told her to go back and see to the customers. He had to take care of the day’s business as soon as possible so that he could head to the Supremacy League.

Soon after, Xu Yingxue arrived from the test room. She still felt she was having a dream and her feet were weak. If it weren’t for the fact that she had just witnessed it with her own eyes, she wouldn’t have believed a word Su Ping had just said!

My pet indeed could compare to a ninth-rank beast!

That is amazing!

The advanced skills that her pet had learned were all quite impressive. She would never have never imagined that this could be achieved within one day.

That one hundred million... was so well spent!

“Mr. Su...” Xu Yingxue approached Su Ping, still feeling that the situation was surreal. She bowed to her waist and expressed her gratitude, “Thank you so much. I will never forget your kindness!”

Su Ping didn’t know she would be that excited. Of course, he was aware that other customers had also been freaked out by the result.

“Please, you’re too kind. Remember, you did pay me money.” Su Ping helped her up.

The customers standing in the line were not surprised about this sort of reaction. Some new customers—even those who just went for the general training-would be so thrilled that instead of just saying thank-you, they would even want to offer him presents but he didn’t accept any.

Xu Yingxue produced a forced smile.

Money? Compared to the result, one hundred million was nothing.

“I will never forget,” Xu Yingxue insisted. She bowed to him again and left.

Su Ping didn’t know what to say. What a stubborn girl.

After Xu Yingxue left, Su Ping continued with the other customers. He did tell the customers who were there for the professional training that they would have to wait for a few days to up their pets and that he would give them notice by then.

After all, he would have to leave to get the Talent Stone.

Those customers accepted gladly. The other stores would have to spend months in training. Su Ping was just asking for a couple of days.

Soon, no more spots were available.

The customers that were still waiting had to leave in disappointment.

Su Ping turned the store to Joanna and told her to set up the dummy training.

“Sir, when are you going to be back?” Zhong Lingtong asked. She was in a strange place and she had no friends there. Su Ping was the only one she was a little bit more familiar with. She was not happy since he was going to leave.

“Don’t worry. Soon.”

Su Ping rubbed her head. Messing up her hair had put him in a good mood.

Not a short-tempered girl. Unlike Tang Ruyan, Zhong Lingtong didn’t get angry about her hair. She just eyed Su Ping with her watery eyes.

Su Ping was never fond of the feeling of saying goodbye. He waved his hand, pretending to be unaffected. After some thought, he called the Swamp War Crocodile out. He was worried that he would encounter legendary battle pet warriors during the Supremacy League. The Little Skeleton was still awakening its bloodline and could not help him at the moment. The only powerful pet he had was the Inferno Dragon whose combat strength had just surpassed 10. Relying on the Inferno Dragon was not safe enough.
