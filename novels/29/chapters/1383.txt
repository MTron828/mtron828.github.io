“Where are we going?”

Everybody inside the store was at a loss while looking at the vast and desolate space.

They turned and looked at Su Ping, who was their sole backbone at the moment.

“We’ll look for our allies!”

Su Ping recovered from the shock caused by the system’s words. In any case, since he had exited the universe, the only solution was to find the universes where the Archean Divinity and the Golden Crows were found. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Only by unifying with their forces would he have a chance to fight the Heavens.

“Allies?”

Everybody was dazed.?Are there other races beyond the universe?

How is Su Ping certain that they are allies and not enemies?

That is, unless Su Ping had already visited them.

Considering the mysterious magic store and his own terrifying power, they came to a sudden realization.

Su Ping’s talent was beyond their imagination.

Maybe Su Ping had already left the universe and cultivated in an unknown place with the store’s help. That was the only explanation for that young man’s unbelievable achievements.

......

“Ours is not the only universe that exists. There are other universes, like the one where gods live,” Su Ping briefly explained.

Everybody understood. A Celestial said, “No wonder some godly treasures were found in Mysterious Realms. They were crafted in ways beyond our human understanding. I wondered why such a powerful race would disappear from our universe. So, they have a universe of their own.”

“In other words, were the godly Mysterious Realms in our universe left by gods who invaded our universe?” asked Xu Kong.

Su Ping felt dazed.

Indeed, there were a lot of Mysterious Realms of other races in their universe. Some of them belonged to gods; many Ascendant State cultivators found divine power in them.

If the Mysterious Realms were indeed left by invading gods, they could have easily conquered the entire universe. However, there was no history of gods in the federal civilization.

Is it possible that the gods who invaded our universe thought that our universe was too weak and weren’t interested in reigning over it??Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He didn’t really think it made sense.

“Mr. Su, do you know where we should go?” someone asked Su Ping.

Su Ping glanced at him and slightly shook his head. “There are no coordinates beyond the universe; we can only try our luck. Besides, this region is home to the Heavens.”

Su Ping thought it was better to tell them where they were located at the moment.

Everybody was of Celestial rank, the very pillars of humanity. Although the revelation would cause panic, it would make them be more cautious.

“Home to the Heavens?”

Everybody was puzzled.

Su Ping said, “I mean the aliens hiding among the worms. They’re called the Heavens, and they have a long history. Their clan is very powerful; there’s no way of knowing how much of their power remains.”

“The aliens are the Heavens?”

Everybody was greatly surprised; Su Ping’s words terrified them. An old Celestial asked in shock, “We’ve run into the aliens’ nest?”

Aren’t we asking to be killed?

All their faces changed, and they quickly retracted their senses, fearing that the aliens might notice them.

“Are human beings bound to go extinct?” said one of them, exhaling a pessimistic sigh.

“Mr. Su, if you knew this was the nest of the Heavens, why bring us here?” Someone looked at Su Ping with an awful expression. He didn’t suspect that Su Ping was conspiring with the aliens, as it was unnecessary. Those aliens didn’t need to conspire with the young man to lure them into their nest. Besides, Su Ping alone was enough to execute them.

Everybody else looked at Su Ping too, as they understood the logic. Su Ping took them to that place, knowing it was dangerous. Was there another reason?

Su Ping could only smile bitterly in his heart as he saw their eyes. He had never known of such a matter until that moment. Still, had he known earlier, there still wouldn’t have been anywhere else to run to.

“No need to panic,” said Su Ping, “This place is boundless. Although this is where they live, they haven’t really explored every part.”

That was Su Ping’s deduction.

If the place beyond the universe was where the Heavens lived, then it had to be something lying outside of every universe.

The Realm of Heavens was found outside of every universe.

Perhaps the place was not the Realm of Heavens in the beginning, until it was occupied by them.

Not all of the cultivation sites that Su Ping had visited contained signs of the Heavens, which meant that many universes had yet to be discovered by them.

It was like humans being unable to find every single trench in the ocean.

Those neglected by the Heavens were either lucky dogs or races that voluntarily chose to hide, like the Golden Crows did.

Su Ping guessed that the Golden Crow ancestor had done something to their universe to prevent the Heavens from noticing anything, even if they passed by.

That is, unless, the Original Heavenly Dao showed up—the one that, according to the system, was comparable to the Golden Crow ancestor.

Everybody became shocked and suspicious by Su Ping’s words. According to what the latter said, they were playing a wild gamble!

They would be doomed if they encountered the Heavens or were found by them.

They could only bet on not encountering any.

Some people seemed desperate. Having just experienced such a massive catastrophe, they didn’t really think that luck was on their side.
