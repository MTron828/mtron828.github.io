Chapter 150 Online Tutoring

Su Ping arrived at the store and looked at the time. One hour and a half had passed.

That was half an hour wasted.

He felt sorry for the loss of time. As soon as he entered the store, he took out the pets that had finished with their training, picked out another group, and then gave them to the dummy trainer.

While the dummy was performing the training, Su Ping sent the Little Skeleton to the nursing pen.

As for the Inferno Dragon, it would have to stay in the contract space.

The Inferno Dragon was too large to fit in the small store at the moment. Su Ping felt the urge to make enough money to buy the other stores nearby so that he could upgrade his store.

Having settled the Little Skeleton, Su Ping went back to the storefront to wait for potential business while cultivating astral powers.

In the meantime, he opened the computer and logged onto the explorers’ website to access the page for private tutors.

“This time, I have to find someone smarter, someone that can understand what I say after a few words so that progress shows more dramatically...” Su Ping told himself. The first one he found had made him waste half a night.

In a villa.

Xu Kuang was playing computer games. He was a top student at the Berserking Blade Academy... but top students also needed entertainment. He couldn’t devote all his life to cultivation. That would bore him to death.

Xu Kuang screamed at the screen, “Why are you hiding there? Come on. I’m losing my life here!

“F*ck vou. Come on out!” He was fuming with anger.

On the computer, Xu Kuang was playing top solo, controlling his pet “Razer Crocodile.” This Razer Crocodile was a cute, cartoon version of the real-life Razer Crocodile. In the game, the Razer Crocodile appeared to be adorable and at the same time, powerful. The several skills provided in the game were the standard inherent skills Razer Crocodiles would master.

In this era when battle pet warriors were mainstream in society, not only were pets irreplaceable help in people’s lives, pets were involved in all industries as well.

Xu Kuang clicked on the keyboard like crazy. Even so, the screen dimmed down soon. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

(Thunder Basilisk inflicted 823 points of damage on you with its flames...]

(Thunder Basilisk inflicted 320 points of damage on you with its tail...)

Xu Kuang saw his then hiding teammates dash out from the tall grass upon his death. Then, the skill didn’t work and the Thunder Basilisk that their opponents controlled had returned to their base tower...

As such, their opponents collected some loot along the way and went back. “Damn it...”

Xu Kuang was burning up. He clicked on ESC and exited the game.

“You idiots. Let’s see how you play with one less person...”

Five minutes in the game, angry for two hours.

Ding!

While Xu Kuang’s wrath had yet to dissipate, a window popped out on his computer.

Xu Kuang took a look. “Your friend ‘Longjiang Cool Dude’ has logged on.”

It was him!

Xu Kuang’s eyes glowed and the anger was subdued by a large margin. That was only a game, which was nothing compared to his future. He clicked on the pop-up window and entered the website at once.

To wait for Su Ping, whenever he was at home, he would keep his computer on at all times. He thought if he met Su Ping again, he could ask for another tutoring session.

Last time, thanks to Su Ping’s instructions, Xu Kuang became No.2 in their academy. The only one he was second to was that guy surnamed Mu.

That was a stunning progress. He wouldn’t have achieved this no matter how many expert tutors he could hire.

As for finding other titled battle pet warriors?

He had to find the right connection.

Su Ping was a rare case where a titled battle pet warrior would reach out in person and the tutoring turned out to be more than effective. Su Ping was better than the other titled battle pet warrior tutors Xu Kuang had seen before. Xu Kuang would not hesitate to pay double the price for Su Ping’s guidance. Two smiling face stickers were sent.

“Mr. Su, hi.” Xu Kuang typed quickly.

At the store.

Ding!

Su Ping had just opened the page without taking a closer look when he saw someone sending him a message.

He was curious. He clicked it open and saw the name and the chat history. He suddenly remembered the “buyer” from last time.

“Hi.” He gave a casual reply and then went back to browsing the page. Xu Kuang was excited since Su Ping had actually replied. Fearing that Su Ping would log off soon-after all, masters like him would be busy-Xu Kuang typed rapidly, “Mr. Su, do you have some time? Could you please come for another session? I’ve recently had some questions about my pets. Money is not a problem. You can name the price.”

Su Ping received the message. He opened it and raised his eyebrows. Money was not the problem? Even so, he couldn’t have set the price at two million, twice as high as before.

But if he raised the price by merely hundreds of thousands, to him, that would still be a loss.

“I’m busy,” he rejected.

Xu Kuang was surprised by this short reply. The excitement in his heart died down.

This result was not acceptable to Xu Kuang. He sent many adorable emojis with watery eyes. “Mr. Su, just come and give me some random instructions. I mean it. How about I give you 1.5 million?”.

Su Ping, “...”

The increase in price was just as he had expected. He wasn’t interested.

Xu Kuang added, “Mr. Su?

“I am begging you. I am having miserable days here...

“My combat abilities were drastically enhanced thanks to your instructions from last time. That was quite beneficial to me. However, there is still someone I cannot win against...

“Mr. Su, consider this a charity. You can name your requirements as long as you can come and give me some guidance.”

Su Ping was browsing through the page for other students’ information. He was annoyed by the many system alerts. He wanted to unfriend him. That being said, considering he had made money through Xu Kuang, unfriending him seemed unethical. He opened the chat and saw all of those words, emojis and stickers.

Alas.

Su Ping heaved a sigh and began typing. “I’m really busy. But, if you have any questions, you can ask them now. If I know the answers, I will explain them to you. Of course, this won’t be for free.”

“Really?”

Xu Kuang was excited after Su Ping had finally replied. He typed at once, “Mr. Su, you are so nice. Here is the thing. Last time, I used my...”

He typed the problems he had run into during his battles and waited for Su Ping’s reply nervously.

Su Ping read through the question which was commonplace for him. He provided the answer and in the end, he said, “I charge half a million for this answer.”

Xu Kuang carefully read the messages Su Ping sent. He suddenly felt refreshed and enlightened.

He didn’t mind it when he saw Su Ping mentioning the cost. Xu Kuang answered readily, “No problem. Mr. Su, thank you so much.”

“Don’t mention it,” Su Ping replied. After a pause, he asked, “When will you transfer the money?”

Xu Kuang didn’t expect to see this. Immediately, he answered, “Now.”

“Okay,” Su Ping replied fast. Not long after, Su Ping heard the ring tone on his phone. The transferred amount was correct. Su Ping was happy and had a better impression of this guy. The chump was average in combat but quick in providing money. There was hope in him.

Xu Kuang asked to check, “Mr. Su, have you received the money?”

“Yes.”

“Mr. Su, the holidays are coming up. Can I pay you a visit?”

Su Ping knew that Xu Kuang was trying to figure out his address.

He didn’t mind this. After all, nothing could hurt him within the bounds of the store.

“Sure,” he consented.

Xu Kuang resided in the upper town area and was a wealthy kid. He had to belong to a household similar to Ye Hao’s. Su Ping would not let go of such a rich customer. Xu Kuang had thought at first that Su Ping would turn him down. Someone like Su Ping was unlikely to reveal his address. Xu Kuang only asked this question to try his luck. Su Ping agreeing took him by surprise.

Looking at the word “sure,” Xu Kuang took a while to believe it. He was shivering in excitement. He couldn’t believe he had found out the address of a master warrior so easily.

Before Xu Kuang could type another message, Su Ping had already forwarded the address of his store.

The slums?

Xu Kuang was confused about the address. But that was all. He didn’t hold any contempt because of the location.

He knew that some mighty figures would choose any place as residence. Mere worldly possessions were not of their concern.

People would usually rely on precious possessions to increase their social status and identity. However, when it came to those bigwigs, anything they touched, even garbage, would be considered precious treasures. That was how the world worked.

Xu Kuang wrote down the address and sent some kissing emojis to Su Ping. Su Ping looked at them but didn’t answer. He continued to browse the page.

Xu Kuang didn’t bother Su Ping anymore. Since he had the address, he could pay a visit to Su Ping and would no longer be afraid that he would disappear.

Then, Xu Kuang heard someone going upstairs. He turned around. It was his big sister, Xu Yingxue.

“Stop playing games. Have some fruit.” Xu Yingxue arrived with a plate of expensive fruit slices; she placed the plate next to the computer.

Xu Kuang was too happy to eat any fruit. “Sister, I have a piece of great news!”

“What?” Xu Yingxue saw that Xu Kuang was so excited his neck was turning red. She giggled. “What? Penta kill?”

Poof! This was unexpected. What kind of great news would that be? It wasn’t like he was addicted to computer games.

“Sister, what are you talking about?” Xu Kuang said grumpily.

Xu Yingxue sat on the nearby couch. Her long and white legs seemed to be glowing. She picked up some fruit and went on, “Fine. Tell me. Have you become No.1 in your academy?”

Xu Kuang’s excitement died down again.

“Never mind. I’ll tell you.” Xu Kuang didn’t want to face another blow.

Xu Yingxue didn’t answer back. Upset, Xu Kuang continued, “Do you remember that titled battle pet warrior I talked to you about? I met him today and got his address.”

“Address?” Xu Yingxue was taken by surprise. She opened up her beautiful eyes in curiosity.
