Chapter 156 Not Allowed

“If so, go to the back of the line and wait.”

Su Ping only asked Ye Hao a casual question. Since Ye Hao wanted the training service, Su Ping remembered the one hundred thousand Ye Hao had paid before. Su Ping added, “You booked the 10th spot. It’ll be your turn after number 9 is done.”

Those words shocked the other people waiting there. “Mr. Su, we can make reservations?” “I want that, too!”

“How can we make a reservation?”

Those in line threw out their questions at once.

Su Ping didn’t expect that this information could cause such a huge reaction. He lied... promised Ye Hao when the business was still bleak.

It seemed that everyone was excited about the reservation option. That was understandable. If they could make a reservation, they wouldn’t have to wait there by the door in utter boredom.

Su Ping suddenly realized that this was a good way to make money.

I’m making money from the reservation of services in my store. That is perfectly justifiable!

Someone’s deep-buried soul of a dishonest businessman was awakening. Right at that moment.

“Warning!”

“The store will only receive customers that mean to have their pets trained. No reservation will be accepted. No past reservation is valid,” the system said seriously in Su Ping’s mind.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. In his mind, he argued, “Why didn’t you say so when I took Ye Hao’s money? Besides, I’m not asking you to add the reservation service in the store. This is just another method of making money that I personally suggested. Someone else is bound to detect this business opportunity if we don’t do it, and they will make the money that should be ours.”

Ye Hao asked another question to Su Ping, “I can give you more money. How much will it cost to be the first?”

The line was long. Ye Hao didn’t have the patience to wait for another nine people.

Su Ping stopped the conversation in his mind. He remembered the system’s words so he didn’t cross the line. “There’s no set price for now. You have to wait for your turn.”

Ye Hao frowned. He looked at the boy standing in front of Su Ping and asked, “How much do I have to pay for you to give up your spot for me?”

The boy was startled. He had heard about Ye Hao’s wealth. Hesitating, the boy proposed, “Five, five thousand?” Ye Hao replied at once, “I’ll give you ten thousand and I will take your spot.” The boy was overjoyed. “Are you serious? Here, take my place.”

The ten thousand was enough for the boy to have his pet trained there once.

The other people behind this boy were taken aback. All of a sudden, their eyes began to glow. They had an epiphany. This was a brilliant way of making money!

And an easy way of making money at that.

Those standing at the front did nothing more than get up early in the morning.

You could make ten thousand just by getting up early?

Ten thousand was what a person could make in two months!

This was some easy money! Su Ping knew this would happen. He pulled a long face and said to the system, “See, they are the ones who’ll be raking in the money.”

The system: “...”

Su Ping heaved a sigh in sorrow since the system didn’t reply. “System, you are too innocent. You don’t understand the complexity of human nature. You can set up a rule that no one can transfer their spot and they can only have their own pets trained. That being said...”

He stopped before he had finished his sentence.

He wished he could slap himself in the face.

The formerly quiet system said, “You’re right. From now on, people that come to the store cannot transfer their spots in the lines. Besides, they can only train their own pets. The ones that transfer their spots will be blacklisted forever. I will recognize them no matter what disguise they take!” No kidding!

Out of anger, Su Ping slapped himself in his face.

Ye Hao was scared by Su Ping’s sudden action. The former thought that he had offended Su Ping by proposing to buy the spot. Ye Hao said in a haste, “Mr. Su, don’t do this. Mr. Su, it’s not worth it...” Su Ping didn’t say anything to him. Inside, he was arguing with the system, biting his teeth, “System, it is unethical to copy other people’s ideas.”

“You’re not other people. You are my host,” the system corrected him.

Su Ping was on the verge of bursting into tears. He wasn’t moved. He was enraged.

The lines were about to fall apart. Many students at the head of the line were turning around to sell their spots. All of a sudden, Su Ping realized that what system did was not entirely bad.

If the spots could be sold and transferred at will, then maybe, in the future, when he opened up the door, the only faces he could see were the ones lining for other people but not people that had gone there to train their pets.

Maybe, when this news was spread out, the general public would occupy the spots and use this as a way to earn a living.

Besides, someone with untoward intentions would hire many people to occupy the spots to make a fortune.

At this rate, no matter how good the services would be in the store, the reputation would be permanently damaged.

Su Ping sighed inside and then announced to the customers, “The spots in the line cannot be transferred. Everyone must be here to have their own pets trained. Anyone that doesn’t want their spots can leave. Anyone that is found out about having sold their spots for profit will be on the store’s blacklist forever!”

The restless crowd quieted down at Su Ping’s words. Everyone was dumbstruck.

The boy at the front of the line was about to take Ye Hao’s money. That boy was stunned and he asked, “So, my spot is?”

“No transfers allowed.” Su Ping had no other choice.

That boy was vexed. He would throw a temper if it weren’t for Su Ping’s strength. He was that close to receiving the money. Frustrated, the boy said, “But, this spot is mine. I can give it to whoever I want, right?”

Su Ping nodded. “That’s right. So, the store is mine. I can receive whoever I want.”

The boy was speechless.

Ye Hao didn’t expect this, either. The spot had been taken away from him. He even wondered if Su Ping was doing this because of him. Who would implement such strange rules?

If this was the case, even titled battle pet warriors would have to wait in line at the store?

“Then, my reservation...” Ye Hao was worried.

Su Ping found this a problem as well. He asked the system and it replied, “One-time exception and cannot be repeated.”

Su Ping was relieved to have this answer. He said to Ye Hao, “I think highly of you. That is why I saved the spot for you. It is not a matter of money. The store never had a reservation service available. If you want to come for training, come earlier.”

Ye Hao didn’t know what else to say.

He never intended to go there for the training in the first place. But then Su Ping sounded serious and he even suggested coming earlier.

Ye Hao might not even come back again. It was just that the business in Su Ping’s store was busy. Ye Hao knew that Su Ping probably didn’t have time to talk to him because he had only gone there to talk about cultivation.

Since Ye Hao had said that he wanted the training service himself, to turn around and leave would seem dishonest. He didn’t want to cozy up to Su Ping. That being said, he didn’t want to provoke a strange guy with a background he couldn’t figure out.

“Fine.” Ye Hao sighed and stood in the line to wait.

Su Ping’s words explained the situation to the other students. Some felt disappointed that their way of making money was gone. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Some students from better-off families were relieved. If Su Ping had reservation services, they would have to fight for the spots against some wealthier guys. That wouldn’t make any sense.

The training service provided in Su Ping’s store was outstanding. The price was high but considering the effects, the fee was not expensive at all.

But if the spots could be transferred, then the price for the spots would be raised to a whopping high level, and the spots could be even more expensive than the training service itself. When people went there for the training service, they would have to pay more for the spots. That wasn’t worth it.

Since the noise gradually quieted down, Su Ping went back to business. Since everyone else had accepted this rule, the boy that was going to sell his spot to Ye Hao couldn’t complain about it. He just sighed to himself.

Outside the store, Xu Yingxue and Xu Kuang had witnessed everything.

She found this interesting. This store owner was young but he was seasoned.

Besides, she had heard people in the lines whispering. They were praying that they could still get a spot that day.

Hmm, hunger marketing.

Xu Yingxue sneered. She stepped forward. “Make way.”

Ye Hao turned around. “Who are you?” Xu Yingxue glared at him but didn’t answer. She said directly to Su Ping who was taking notes, “Are you the owner or the servant here?”

Su Ping looked up. She was a slim and beautiful lady with a well-developed body. Soon, he noticed the familiar person standing next to her. Was that Xu Kuang?

Xu Kuang didn’t know that his sister would be this blunt. He was scared. He pulled his sister’s sleeve and tried to stop her, “Sister...”

Su Ping understood their relationship at once but he wasn’t interested. He went back to write down his notes and said, “I am the owner. Go back in whether you want the training service or anything else. But we don’t have many spaces for training left today. I suggest you come back tomorrow.”

Xu Yingxue was furious since Su Ping had paid little attention to her. Her face was clouded as she said, “I heard that you’re a titled battle pet warrior. I see that some students here refer to you as their teacher. You’re quite the con artist.”
