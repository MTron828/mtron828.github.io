Chapter 1150 Terrifying Cultivation Speed

“It’s too early to call her ‘master’ yet. You cannot be her disciple until we return to the sect and have your background checked,” said an old man in a hurry.

The Mu-surnamed woman gave a slight nod. “I appreciate your gesture.”

“Okay.” Su Ping could only accept the arrangement.

The other hopefuls deemed him shameless for his obsequious behavior. All of them would become immortal cultivators. Did he have to go that far?

The old men chatted with Su Ping for a while longer to ask about his general situation. They proudly introduced him to the Heaven Asking Church once they realized he wasn’t acquainted.

All of the old men were core disciples of the Heaven Asking Church. Their potential was limited, even though they were already trying their hardest; it was barely possible to make a breakthrough without major opportunities.

It seems that the Ascendant State has been a major challenge since ancient times.

Dragon roars came from the testing field now and then while they chit chatted, as someone’s deity constitution was figured out. Nine candidates were gathered on the high tower at the end of the day, Su Ping included.

In addition, many other candidates whose potential had met the standard were gathered downstairs.

The Mu-surnamed woman said casually, “It’s over. Time to go back.”

The old men nodded respectfully. Someone instantly waved their sleeve to retrieve the nine silver pillars on the square. They unleashed a dazzling silver light and made the earth quake as they shrank and turned into nine needles, which then flew into one of the old men’s sleeves.

Everybody’s eyes glowed when they witnessed such an amazing technique; on the other hand, those who failed were regretful and in pain.

The Mu-surnamed woman flew back to her carriage like an angel on earth. The tower they stood on also quaked and took off, revolving in midair as her carriage rose to the sky. Su Ping and the others were seeing rotating landscapes.

Then, the tower shrank and fell into the woman’s hand, to then fly away after the phoenix cried; the remaining people on the square craned their heads enviously.

Su Ping and the others shrunk along with the tower, making the world outside even vaster. The ones selected had eyes full of wonder after having just embarked on the journey to immortality.

Su Ping was already used to it, so he didn’t consider it a big deal. However, the others were already exclaiming in excitement. Even the shy ones were also envisioning their future with glowing eyes.

They passed through the hazy mist and rose high into the sky, leaping into the clouds.

None of the selected had ever flown before; they exclaimed all the way.

A long while later, After traveling through a thick cloud, the latter gradually dispersed, revealing a mountain and a pavilion high in the clouds.

The place was splendid and awe-inspiring.

Outside the gate was a sword-shaped mountain that was a hundred meters long, with the words “Heaven Asking Church” inscribed.

The carriage behind the phoenix flew by; a lot of people riding flying swords could be seen. All the people riding the tower were excited, knowing they had arrived at the place of deities.

The Mu-surnamed woman quickly led them to a mountain that seemed to be the registration center. The tower revolved and released the passengers, who followed the elder’s lead and made a line to register.

There was an enormous mirror in the registration center, which reflected everything that ever happened in a person’s past.

It was meant to prevent spies of other sects from sneaking in.

Su Ping looked at the enormous mirror and mumbled, “This mirror is a great treasure. If only I could steal it.” He held back in the end.

The enormous mirror glowed soon after. Su Ping looked into the mirror, only to see nothing but his own reflection; it was just like a normal mirror.

Other people’s reflections in the mirror had shown different faces, which belonged to their previous lives. Some women were bearded muscular men in their previous lives, and some muscular men were alluring women, having been reborn after being tortured to death, which attracted a lot of attention…

“Huh?”

The Star Lord at the registration center was slightly surprised when he saw Su Ping’s reflection; he couldn’t help but size him up. “I cannot see your previous life. Has someone blocked it on purpose? Tell me the truth. What are you exactly?”

Before he could finish-Su Ping’s reflection in the mirror changed. It was replaced by a hideous man begging on the streets.

“You were a beggar in your previous life…”

The old man was puzzled for a moment. He then looked at Su Ping and said, “Why didn’t it show up right away? Weird. Did something happen to the Three Lives Mirror? Lagging? That’s impossible…”

That had never happened before. The situation left him rather confused.

But then, other scenes from Su Ping’s previous life were displayed, confirming that he wasn’t a demonic spy.

Su Ping’s current life was displayed in more detail. He was born in a rich family, but his family was slaughtered when he was little; he lived in the wilderness until he was adopted…

In the end, he picked a lot of skills and passed the Heaven Asking Church’s test before he went there.

The scenes flashed in the blink of an eye, but the old man saw it all.

“Go.”

The old man waved his hand. He would rather not ask any further since there was no problem about Su Ping’s background. He didn’t know how to explain the brief blankness, but it was impossible to alter the mirror’s functions. That was the Heaven Asking Church’s headquarters; nobody could cheat there.

Su Ping was gloomy as he retreated from the enormous mirror, but he was actually quite relieved.

He instantly asked in his heart, “System, did you do that?”

Su Ping was rather surprised when he saw his previous life’s scenes, also thinking that something had gone wrong with the mirror. However, he soon realized that it was completely made up when he saw his past.

“Exactly. I used some of my power to give you a hand, but only in this cultivation site. Don’t count on my help in the outside world,” declared the system proudly.

“Be grateful to this system. You would’ve been kicked out without me!”

“Grateful my ass. You made me look so ugly in my previous life. That was quite the malicious revenge!”

“You don’t appreciate my kindness at all. Get lost!” the system cursed furiously and fell quiet. Su Ping couldn’t help but picture a little girl crossing her arms angrily in front of her chest, turning around to show her stubbornness and fury. “This guy…” Su Ping raised his eyebrows and stopped arguing.

Su Ping returned to the place where the Mu-surnamed woman was; an old man immediately stepped out and said with a smile, “Su Ping, you’ve been approved by this sect. You may now pay respect to your master.”

He was trying to please her by attracting talented disciples like Su Ping.

The Mu-surnamed woman also gazed at Su

Ping.

Even though the young man had called her master earlier on, it didn’t mean anything. It was mere flattery.

“Master, it’s an honor to meet you,” Su Ping nodded and said without hesitation.

There was gentleness in the woman’s eyes. She nodded and said, “Okay. Henceforth, you’ll be my disciple; I’ll try my best to teach you. We’ll hold a recruitment ritual when we return to my place.”

“Okay.” Su Ping nodded.

Some of the other candidates moved closer and also acknowledged her as their master.

Six of the nine candidates recognized her as their master. As for the last three, they had their own backgrounds and goals, so they politely declined her offer.

The Mu-surnamed woman wasn’t upset by this. Once the screening ended, she took her disciples away from the mountain and flew through the clouds. She eventually landed on a lone peak.

Lots of buildings made in ancient styles were found there. Some disciples were practicing in the open grounds amidst the buildings.

The disciples on the mountain knew that their master was back when they saw the carriage. Aside from those who were cultivating, the rest of them gathered by the gate.

“Master has brought new disciples over.”

“Fantastic. We’ve got new toys.”

“Phew. I’m finally out of the bottom rungs.”

The disciples gathered by the gate looked around in excitement.

The Mu-surnamed woman landed, then released Su Ping and the others. All of them landed in front of the gate. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Including Su Ping, the six with deity constitutions stood at the rear, while the others arranged themselves right behind them. The senior disciples observed curiously; they were shocked to see that six newcomers had deity constitutions.

“Master has recruited six disciples with deity constitutions in one go?”

“I heard that a lot of unparalleled geniuses have been born as of late. Is it true?”

“It’s said that Bei Yanfeng has also recruited many disciples with deity constitutions. They’re probably going to eclipse us again a couple of years later in the contest. It isn’t bad, though. Our master has found her share of talented disciples.”

The Mu-surnamed woman stood in front of the hall while they discussed; the colorful phoenix turned into a tiny bird that perched on her shoulder.

“My last name is Mu, and my title is Xuefeng.”

Mu Xuefeng looked at those gathered with a tranquil expression. “As my disciples, you must follow the eight rules of the Heaven Asking Church, and my three rules. Those who break the rules will be either crippled or banished from this school.

“Apart from that, no formalities are required in your daily lives; you only need to focus on cultivation.”

Everyone’s heads were lowered as they listened quietly.

Mu Xuefeng then told them the eight rules of her sect and her three rules in detail. The gist was that the Heaven Asking Church was righteous and nobody was to kill others easily.

To put it simply, there shouldn’t be a problem as long as I follow the moral code, Su Ping thought. It seemed that the sect rules weren’t too strict, unless a candidate was simply an outlaw.

The recruitment ceremony began after she explained the rules.

Some disciples offered them tea. The new disciples drank the tea and kowtowed, thus concluding the ritual.

“The six of you were born with deity constitutions, which is extraordinary. Still there’s no guarantee to you making achievements with that alone. It is but a mere bridge for you to reach the sky!

“You must figure out your own approach by yourselves.”

Mu Xuefeng then said to Su Ping and the others. “In the first year, you will sleep and cultivate with other disciples. You won’t have any privileges; I will make personalized cultivation methods for you when you show that your potential is well deserved. All of you have the potential to rise and become core disciples, even exceeding me. I hope that you’ll focus on cultivation and not be sidetracked.”

All but Su Ping accepted her instructions with excitement.

The potential to exceed their master?

How much potential could they possibly have?

The rest of the disciples looked at Su Ping and the others with envy and jealousy.

Then, Mu Xuefeng asked a few senior disciples to lead the new disciples to their dormitories.

They were supposed to become familiar with the environment on the first day.

They would be collectively taught cultivation methods until the second day.

As for the rest, it would only depend on their own work.

“I’m your senior brother. You may call me Zhao Feng.”

A handsome and brawny young man led Su Ping to the buildings on the mountaintop and entered a yard. While walking, he added, “All of you have deity constitutions. You’ll surely enter the inner circle if you work hard. Master didn’t give you any privileges only because she didn’t want you to become arrogant.”

The group understood their master’s decision; she feared that others would become jealous of them, due to their potential and privileges.

“With your potential, you will soon leave others behind, and then we’ll be able to cultivate together,” said Zhao Feng with a friendly smile. The others were delighted to meet him.

After their dormitories were settled, many disciples wandered on the mountain and visited the divine place, only to be shocked again.

On the second day

The disciples were gathered by Mu Xuefeng, who then taught them the beginner cultivation methods.

It was also the cultivation technique of the Heaven Asking Church. The first volume consisted of nine parts. There was a chance to reach the Star State when grasping the ninth part.

The second volume consisted of three parts, allowing anyone to become a Star Lord.

The third volume enabled the Ascendant State.

The last part consisted of five volumes. Judging from what Mu Xuefeng said, Su Ping realized how powerful the Heaven Asking Church was. Their sect leader couldn’t simply be a Celestial. They were probably beyond the Celestial State!
