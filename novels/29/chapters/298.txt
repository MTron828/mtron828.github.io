Chapter 300 Piss Off!

Not wasting any time, Su Ping got into the black car parked outside the store.

He stepped on the gas and the car went at top speed. The droning noise of the exhaust pipe was spread along the street. Su Lingyue, who had been cultivating in her bedroom at home was startled by this familiar noise. She stopped cultivating, hopped off her bed, and went to take a look through her window, only to see that Su Ping was dashing away in that familiar car! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Where is he... off to?”

Su Lingyue was in a daze. From the speed alone, she could tell that it wasn’t a drive in a calm state.

Su Ping drove the car and entered the highway.

He drove his car at top speed along the highway and soon arrived at the toll booths found at the border of the uptown area. Many cars were waiting in several lines to pass.

“Telekinesis!”

As Su Ping wielded his spiritual power, the car took to the skies and directly flew over the toll booths. Given the strength of his mind, manipulating an armored vehicle that weighed almost two tons was a child’s play. The flying vehicle immediately caught the attention of those in the vicinity. Some stared open-mouthed. It was a surprise that they could see a titled battle pet warrior there! The siren strapped to a tall pole went off but was soon turned off by someone. No kidding. No titled battle pet warrior would have to pay on the highway. Across all the base cities, titled battle pet warriors were eligible for the highest level of special treatment. After all, when the base cities were under attack by beasts, the ones that would make the greatest contribution to protect the base cities were the titled battle pet warriors.

They were the cornerstone in human society and everyone would treat them with respect!

Having flown over the toll booth, Su Ping landed his car slowly and kept moving along the highway. Soon, he got off the highway and drove to the Zhou Family’s residence in the Kings’ Zone according to the navigation. The residence of the Zhou Family was not merely a building; it covered a large swath of land, and could be called a city within the city. Every facility needed was ready and available in this garden-like residence, including a private hospital, battle venue, a training stadium for pets, supermarkets, etc.. Those that could live there were direct-line descendants of the Zhou Family, or some born of concubines but had made outstanding contributions to the Zhou Family.

All the facilities and equipment were the best of their kind. Take the pet clinic for example; all the staff was formed by master healers. For some Zhou Family members who weren’t direct descendants, whenever they couldn’t find a cure for their pets outside and would want to go to the family clinic, they would have to apply for approval and reserve in advance.

Branch members who had not made any contributions couldn’t even have a chance to step into the Zhou Family residence even if they wanted to.

Su Ping stopped his car. The exhaust pipe was burning hot. Su Ping got off of the car and looked at the huge gates; they were actually larger than any usual entrance. There was an archway and several guards were posted; the threshold was large enough for seven to eight cars to go in together.

A guard shouted as Su Ping approached the gates, “Halt. Authorized personnel only. Have you made any reservations?”

Su Ping cast a glance at the guard. Whoosh!

The guard suddenly was lifted off the ground and hovered several meters in the air; he waved his arms and legs in a fluster.

“Can this count as a reservation?” Su Ping asked.

All of the other guards were appalled by this. They hadn’t been able to tell that this young-looking man was a titled battle pet warrior! They couldn’t believe that he was showing his actual age. Some titled battle pet warriors could use special items to keep their young looks. They put their astonishment aside and a team leader stepped forward. “Sir, who are you here to visit? I will report it and have someone come to pick you up at once!”

Su Ping looked at him coldly. “Your family head!” The team leader was taken aback. He could notice that Su Ping was there with hostile intentions. This was not a friendly visit. “Sir, this is the Zhou Family’s residence. You cannot be disrespectful.” The guard felt troubled but he had to work up the courage to warn Su Ping. He knew that the camera was running and if he flinched, the surveillance video would record his coward act. Afterward, he would be fired and banished from the family. “Piss off!”

Su Ping was not in the mood to waste time there. He said those two words and energy surged out of his body, pushing away all the guards. But he spared their lives.

He was there to finish the mastermind behind that scheme and it was not his wish to go after innocent lives. Of course, whether those guards were innocent or not was another question. Su Ping clasped his hands behind his back and went through the gates. The guard who was lifted suddenly fell down. Since the guard was at the fifth rank, falling from such a height would only be a bit hurtful but he wouldn’t be injured.

The guards crawled up from the ground as Su Ping broke into the gates and used their intercom to alert others in the family. The Zhou Family’s residence had a nice landscape. The flourishing grass made a green carpet on the ground. All the streets were wide and neatly-built; they could allow several cars to travel side by side at the same time.

Su Ping walked a bit and felt this pace was too slow. He waved his hand and a dark swirl appeared in the air. With a roar, the Purple Python wiggled out of thin air.

The Purple Python was close to fifty meters long, a length that was found among the common eighth-rank pythons, although the Purple Python was merely at the sixth rank. Because of the limitation of its bloodline, for the moment, the Purple Python was unable to achieve further breakthroughs. Su Ping stomped the ground and jumped up. With arms behind his back, he stood tall on the Purple Python’s head.

“Let’s go!” Receiving the instructions, the Purple Python moved forward along the wide street. Coldness was exuded by its cyan-colored eyes. Not long afterward, a crowd of guards suddenly rushed at them from further ahead. They were wearing a matching yellowish armor. They were members of the Zhou Army!

That was a private army owned by the Zhou Family; all its members were the outstanding disciples of the Zhou Family. They would have to be at least advanced battle pet warriors to become members of this army!

“Stop right there!” The soldiers were furious to see this young man standing on top of the huge python’s head. They hurried over as soon as they received the reports from those guarding the gates. It was unbelievable that there would be such a rude invader. How dare he summon his pet and move about in their Zhou Family’s residence! “I’m here to visit someone. As to all the irrelevant personnel, stay out of my way!” Su Ping enunciated every single word. “How audacious!”

“Those who offend the Zhou Family shall be punished with death!” The soldiers stood in two lines. They all began to mobilize their astral powers. Swirls of various sizes appeared next to them or above their heads. From those swirls snuck out battle pets that were of different species but were all equally terrifying. In an instant, the spacious street became overly packed.

Su Ping squinted his eyes.

He waved his hand and opened up a crack in space. Heavy flames gushed out from the crack as if a volcano had erupted. Following that was a soul-shattering roar that lingered in both heaven and earth!

The Inferno Dragon could feel its master’s killing intent and determination. Surrounded by Inferno Dragonfire, the Inferno Dragon was there to answer its master’s call!
