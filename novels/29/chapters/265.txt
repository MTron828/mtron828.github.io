Chapter 267 Crazy Announcement

“Okay...”

Song Lu said one word after the first half of Su Ping’s sentence. As the second half of his sentence reached her ears, Song Lu was stunned still

The... championship?

She was in such a big shock that she almost dropped her phone.

She held tighter to her phone and came back to her senses. “Mr. Su, are you sure you are saying the right words? Or, did I hear it wrong? How many spots for what?” She felt she had to make sure she heard right.

“No more multiple spots. I said the champion!”

Su Ping had to reiterate so that she would not remember it wrong.

Song Lu kept her eyes wide open. This time, she was sure that she heard that word. Su Ping was not mentioning a number. He said... the champion! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He wanted to make someone the champion?!

Was he in his sane mind!!

Wasn’t this implying that Su Ping would pre-determine the champion for the Elite League’s qualification trials in the Longjiang Base City?

Song Lu could not think straight.

He was talking about the championship... No one in the top 10 or top 5, not even the people who came in second and third could compare with the champion. There was only one champion and the champion was the focus of attention!

The competition in every year’s Elite League was fierce. Not even the several local ruling families could claim that their people would win the championship, not to mention a small store like Su Ping’s! As it had always been, it was the young talents of the major families that were fighting for the championship. No one else ever was included in this fight.

At the very beginning of this call, hearing Su Ping’s calm voice, Song Lu thought that he was unaffected by the news Primo had released the night before. At the moment, she understood that not only was Su Ping affected, he had been driven out of his mind!

In the state of extreme craziness, he sure sounded sane. Nevertheless, his composed tone did not change the fact that he had become a lunatic. Why else would he boast such a wild statement?

“Sir... Sir, please think this through. Becoming the champion is not easy. Fighting for the Top 10 is already a risky game. The champion is always someone from the big families. The entire base city will be in an uproar if we spread out this message!” Song Lu’s voice was trembling.

She was nervous, afraid that Su Ping would be hell-bent on having his own way after he had gone “insane”.

If Su Ping insisted, she would be unable to stop him. Her only option would be to go down with this madman.

“I know. Since this is a competition, then let us compete. I am using legitimate ways. It is not like I am breaking the law or something.” Su Ping stayed calm. He had considered the risk of his decision. Otherwise, he would not have informed her when Primo’s advertisement had been online for so long.

He had to take more concerns into account than Song Lu could imagine.

That being said.

Since he had the ability and he was not committing a crime, why would he step away from the competition?

Besides, even a legendary battle pet warrior had to flee his store. When people came to bully him, he would show people that he wasn’t a pushover.

“Sir...” Song Lu could hear that Su Ping was never going to change his mind. All hope was lost for her.

She felt that the phone in her hand was a bomb that could blow her up at any second.

From their previous interaction, Song Lu had become aware that she would never be able to persuade Su Ping. Besides, when Su Ping was dead set on his ideas, they could not stop him. They could refuse to advertise for him but he had money. He could ask for another company to do the promotions for him while Song Lu and Mu’s Agency would have to deal with the huge liquidated damages.

Song Lu regretted ever taking this job and in the meantime, she regretted having listened to Vice Principal Dong.

What kind of a lunatic did he refer to her!

He was not doing her a favor!

“What?!”

In the office, after hearing Song Lu’s briefing, the Mu Agency’s president practically shot up from his chair. He stared at her in disbelief with his jaw dropped.

Sitting on the side, Mu Shuangwan was just like a deer caught in the headlights. She could have never imagined that Su Ping would be capable of such crazy decisions when the Primo stores pushed him to the edge!

The champion?

How terrifying this sounded! He was saying that he was going to appoint a person and that person was going to be the champion!

What would the major families think of this?

“Did you try to talk him out of it?” he asked Song Lu. Song Lu produced a smile of desperation. “I did everything short of dropping to my knees to beg him. People like him are usually determined and cannot be persuaded.”

The president curled his lips.

He knew better than anyone that those who met the most success in life were usually resolute and unlikely to be swayed.

But... Su Ping was a wacko!

He would never come back until he reached a dead end. He was on a suicide mission!

“No. I cannot allow this to happen. Cancel our contract with the store. We’ll deal with the huge liquidated damages!” Taking a deep breath, he announced his decision.

He understood fully that paying the huge liquidated damages would mean they would lose money.

Still, furthering their cooperation with the store would cost them more money. Even their entire company would be destroyed because of this!

This time, Su Ping wasn’t merely upsetting Primo, a store.

He was going against the entire base city!

He was targeting the championship!

How frantic was he!

“Cancel the contract?” Mu Shuangwan frowned. She was the one who had decided to go along with the job. She had second ideas about canceling the contract. She had met Venerable the Blade in Su Ping’s store. Canceling the contract would mean that Venerable the Blade would have an unfavorable impression of her and the Mu Family.

Also, she had not quite figured out the relationship between Venerable the Blade and Su Ping.

If Venerable the Blade and Su Ping were close, then canceling the contract would make a deep impact on the Mu Family.

The president of the company darted her a look and could understand her concern from the expressions on her face. He waved his hand. “I will take responsibility. The Mu Family cannot spiral down to hell with this crazy man. He said the championship. We could have worked something out if he had said second place. Champion? Does he even know what he is talking about? Who, of the million participants, would be willing to accept this result?!”

Mu Shuangwan heaved a sigh. “I understand.”

“End of discussion.”

“What should we do about... his advertisement?” Song Lu asked cautiously.

“We will cancel the contract and then publish his statement. Since doom is what he is seeking, then let us give him that. We are canceling Mu Shuangwan’s contract as his spokesperson, not the one for publishing his announcement. Anyways, we are just connecting him with some of the advertisement platforms. It is not our fault that he says those words.”

Song Lu smiled bitterly. When Su Ping placed the Inferno Dragon outside his store, they were happy that they had found the right partner.

However, soon, the Primo store exhibited another advanced pet and they provided more appealing packages. Those actions had cornered Su Ping.

Mu Shuangwan could sympathize with Su Ping. Primo had gone too far. The night before, when Primo’s advertisement went online, ninety percent of the customers outside Su Ping’s store left. The ones who stayed were either her fans or the Inferno Dragon’s fans.

“You will be held accountable for this matter. This is going into your year-end review.” The president of the company glared at Song Lu.

Song Lu was the one who had made the contact. She couldn’t escape from it.

Song Lu forced a smile. She knew this was coming.

Back to the store.

“Champion?”

Tang Ruyan overheard Su Ping’s conversation. She stared at him in disbelief.

She was aware of the Elite League. It was an international competition. Currently, they were at the stage of qualification trials at the base city level. She had once been a participant, having won first place in the qualification trials in the base city she came from.

However, later on, she failed in the regional competition.

Since she was a seventh-rank battle pet warrior at the moment, though she was still eligible, age-wise, her rank had exceeded the upper limit...

“Are you planning on participating in person? Not everyone can become the champion,” Tang Ruyan asked curiously. She remembered that when she won first place, she had to rely on her ninth-rank pet.

Also, back then, she was powerful enough herself. She could defeat the most advanced battle pet warriors without having to rely on her pets.

Her strength and her pet combined were what made her the champion.

Su Ping put away his phone. “Of course not.”

This was just a qualification trial at the base city level. He couldn’t have entered the competition himself. He would be bullying other participants if he did.

“You’re not?”

Tang Ruyan did not expect this answer. If Su Ping were to participate, she was sure that he could win first place. After all, he could defeat her.

But if he was not going, then she wouldn’t be so sure whether he could deliver this promise.

“Then what will you do if someone comes with money and asks for this service? You can give that person a ninth-rank pet. But it can backfire if the person is too weak. Or, in the competition, if someone kills the battle pet warrior, no matter how powerful the pet is, it will still be of no use!” Tang Ruyan stated. She couldn’t understand what this man was thinking at all.

“Why would I make an outsider the champion?” Su Ping said, “I have a person in mind.”

“Who?”

“Brother!”

Right then, someone dashed into the store. It was Su Lingyue. She saw the store was devoid of customers, just like she had imagined.

The night before, she had been worried sick when the Primo stores launched one advertisement after another. She came to knock on the door at the dead of night.

But the door was closed and she couldn’t push it open. She wondered if the soundproofing of the door was too perfect because no matter how hard she banged the door, Su Ping didn’t react.

“Have you seen the news? The business is slow today, right?” Su Lingyue asked in haste.

“No. The store is packed.”

“What is packed? No one is here.” “Right, you saw no one and you asked me that question. Do you need to repair your brain damage?”

“You!”

Su Lingyue was furious.

How could he be in the mood to taunt her at this time?

“Primo is also putting an advanced pet on display. Many people are there to check it out. They are promising that they can send people to the Top 5. I heard some people have bought that service and the name list is out.” Su Lingyue was too anxious to diss Su Ping.

Su Ping nodded. “I saw that. Since they are aiming for the Top 5, then we will get the championship. That will make us better than them.”

“The championship?” Su Lingyue glared at Su Ping. “Are you serious?”

“Dead serious.”

Su Lingyue touched Su Ping’s forehead. “You’re not burning up. How come your brain is not working?” Su Ping rolled his eyes and slapped away her hand.

Su Lingyue realized that he wasn’t joking. She was taken aback. “Do you mean it?”

“Of course.”

“I“

Su Lingyue said nothing for a while. After a moment, she asked, “Are you going to participate?”

Su Ping rubbed her head. “You will be participating. Get me that championship. I will publish your name, so don’t let me down.”
