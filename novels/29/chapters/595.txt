Chapter 597 Traces

The forks in the road made the Corridor more complex.

Li Yuanfeng and Su Ping had to fight their way through and find places to hide every now and then. Half a day had passed and even Li Yuanfeng was getting a bit lost.

“I think... I’m lost.”

At another crossroad, Li Yuanfeng stopped and scratched his head.

Su Ping could not believe him.

Lost?

You think?

“I came to this place hundreds of years ago. I can’t even remember when, but I don’t think the Corridor was like this. The structure changed; I think some beasts of the stone family must have done this.” Li Yuanfeng forced a bitter smile. He made it sound as if it weren’t a big deal but the frown gave him away.

Getting lost in there meant danger!

Before they entered the Corridor, Li Yuanfeng had pointed out that they would have to go through more detours if they ever got lost. There they would find many beasts and most of them would be of beast rank, including ones at the Void State.

They would encounter a Void State beast king at some point!

Su Ping was at a loss for words.

Of course, he wasn’t thinking of blaming Li Yuanfeng for it; time could erase so many things. He already owed Li Yuanfeng a bit, merely due to the fact that he had been willing to risk his life to act as his guide.

“How about I go back with you? I can then come back and try on my own,” Su Ping proposed.

Su Ping had told the Dark Dragon Hound to make some markings along the way. Of course, they weren’t the usual markings, like canine urine. The Dark Dragon Hound had learned a special marking skill by itself. It wasn’t based on urine, but the skill did have something to do with saliva.

They couldn’t find their way forward but the markings could make sure that they would be able to find their way back.

“No.” Li Yuanfeng shook his head.

He could no longer fulfil his job as a guide at that point.

Sure, there would be no problem for Su Ping to escort him back to safety, but he wouldn’t accept that arrangement. “We’ve fought our way over; we must have disturbed other beasts close by. We also killed some beasts in their lairs, and those empty lairs would soon be occupied by other beasts as well. To go back would entail a bigger danger. We should keep moving forward.”

Li Yuanfeng continued, “I don’t have much of a sense of direction right now, but I do have experience that can be of assistance to you. I prepared myself for the worst before I came with you. Should anything happen to me, Brother Su, I just hope that you would give up searching for your sister, leave this place and live on!”

Su Ping was moved into speechlessness.

“I’ll make sure that nothing happens to you,” Su Ping said after a moment of silence.

He was grateful for Li Yuanfeng’s support.

However, since he accepted Li Yuanfeng’s kind offer of accompanying him, Su Ping decided that he would save Li Yuanfeng before he saved himself.

If I receive drops of water when in need, I shall return the kindness with a spring. That was the principle that Su Ping had always adhered to.

Of course, the same rule applied to viciousness as well.

Li Yuanfeng patted Su Ping’s shoulder in silence. He looked at the paths ahead. A wisp of astral power flew out of Li Yuanfeng and flickered in the air. Something pulled the astral powers to the left.

Li Yuanfeng said, “Let’s take the path to the right.”

Su Ping had understood his intention the moment he unleashed his astral powers.

He would also use that method to find his way in cultivation sites. The veteran warriors would usually know of similar methods.

Astral powers flying to the left meant that there were beasts absorbing astral powers in that general direction. So, going to the right path was safer!

“Sure.”

Su Ping patted the Dark Dragon Hound and pressed forward with Li Yuanfeng.

Inside the sealed area in the field of Ice.

An aloof-looking young man with dark hair voiced his worries, “I wonder if they’ve found the exit yet.”

An old man shared his concern, “I hope that Old Li is OK and that the young man stays safe. Once that youngster reaches the legendary rank, he will have the potential to be someone who could become the master of the Tower.” He was the one who had cautioned Su Ping to be careful with the way he spoke.

Ye Wuxiu heaved a sigh. “It is not them that I’m worried about. I’m more concerned by what the beasts are up to.”

“Cap, are you worried that the other entrances are in the same situation?” someone asked.

Ye Wuxiu nodded as he heaved another sigh. “If that’s the case, more beasts will come out from the Corridor. They will wipe us out and they’ll finally gain access to the outside world. The Tower will never react in time.” The others looked at each other in silent dismay.

The Deep Caves were like a turtle, containing the beast kings under the shell.

The shell was hard; the beast kings were unable to break the shell with the ancient formation.

However, the openings for the limbs, tail and neck represented chances for the beast kings to get out.

The legendary battle pet warriors had to look after those openings. They were able to do their job because they only had to deal with a few beast kings each time, all due to the terrains.

However, it would be a completely different story if the beast kings could get past them and reach the world outside.

The number of legendary battle pet warriors in the Tower was limited. The base cities above ground would have been flattened by the time they managed to wipe out all the beast kings!

“I think they can check out the situation in the Corridor. If they can come back...” The middle-aged man did not finish his words.

The others suddenly understood why Ye Wuxiu agreed to have Li Yuanfeng go with Su Ping.

Li Yuanfeng would not only protect Su Ping, but also gather information!

They had been in the Deep Caves for far too long to reject such an idea. They weren’t worried about their own lives; they just hoped that all their efforts over the years wouldn’t have been done in vain!

“If only those folks in the Federation could come and help us get this over with...” a man suddenly exclaimed with a bitter tone.

“Don’t count on the Federation. They just think of the Blue Planet as a scrapped place. Apart from the official government, no one would want to waste their resources on performing kind deeds like this.” That idea was rejected coldly.

Everyone shook their heads. They had never placed their hopes on the Federation anyway. The Federation?

Well, they indeed had people that were above the legendary rank!

One of such people could have contained the beasts in the Deep Caves with one blow and solve the problem that had been a painful problem for the Blue Planet for over a thousand years!

But...

No one like that would want to waste a teeny, tiny bit of their energy on the Blue Planet.

It was just like a billionaire who wouldn’t go to a remote mountain village just to donate one coin.

They didn’t want to blame those people and that was the most pathetic part.

Because, if they were the ones with power, they wouldn’t notice a minor problem on a minor planet, either.

Three days went by.

Inside the Deep Caves.

Su Ping and Li Yuanfeng were hiding next to a wall, resting for a while.

They could not believe that they had not found the exit yet after three days had gone past; they still had to play hide-and-seek in there. When hiding wasn’t possible, they would run away or finish the beasts as quickly as they could! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

They had tried their best to fight at the very beginning, but later opted to run whenever possible to save some energy.

“The opening must lead to the Hurricane Field, which is between the Ice Field and Flames Field. I think we shouldn’t be far from the Flames Field,” Li Yuanfeng whispered.

They had found a swirl and tried it the day before, only to end up in the Hurricane Field which was a world devoid of ground and water. They couldn’t even find a place to step on. The legendary battle pet warriors would have to fly around in the air all year long; they would use artifacts that could enable them to stand on air.

Their astral powers would have been depleted if they had to rely solely on themselves.

Li Yuanfeng and Su Ping left the Hurricane Field and continued their search.

They spent the past three days acting with extreme caution.

Boom_!

A beast roamed over from around a corner; it was a mix between a snake and an insect that went past Su Ping and Li Yuanfeng.

It didn’t notice them.

They stopped cloaking themselves and found their way forward once it left.

“Wait!”

All of a sudden, Su Ping noticed that something was glistening on the path that the beast had just gone over.

Upon a closer look, he noticed it was a silver scale!
