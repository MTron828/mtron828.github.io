Chapter 1423 Aid of the Beast (1)

There was a resounding boom; the universe exploded and the handsome God Emperor exploded in the void like withering snow. His soul quickly perished due to the spear’s aura, only the scream of his soul remained.

The other God Emperors of the Chentian Clan were appalled. They looked at Su Ping in disbelief. He killed our royal prince with a single attack?

Their prince was supposed to be their clan’s next leader. He had been tasked with leading the team and visiting the Rain Clan to gain more experience; nobody expected him to die so easily.

Su Ping snorted, not even looking back. He summoned the young Chaos Beast and merged with it. Then, he fled from that place.

He was too fast for any of the God Emperors to react and stop him.

The reason why cultivators at that level were rarely killed was their escaping abilities. They were hard to catch once they were intent on fleeing, unless there was a huge strength gap, which was rare. Su Ping was an exception.

Lin Tianzhan had a gloomy visage; he flashed to the ancestral land.

There would still be a chance to block the boy before he returned to the Heaven Path Institute, as long as the Ancestral God woke up in time.

Ancestral Gods could travel across the world with a single thought, as long as the destination wasn’t behind special barriers.

Lin Tianzhan arrived at the Ancestral Land; he then saw that the Rain Emperor was at the moment kneeling and offering apologies.

“Have you reported the matter to the Ancestral God?” Lin Tianzhan asked telepathically in a hurry.

The Rain Emperor didn’t even dare to look back. He only replied via telepathy, “I’ve told the Ancestral God everything.”

Lin Tianzhan took a deep breath and fell on his knees. “Ancestral God, we beg you to wake up and execute the instigator. That guy will definitely grow to become troublesome!”

After a moment of silence, a vast aura surfaced along with a cold and indifferent voice. “He is but a mere God King, and you want me to suppress him. Have you forgotten to grow up while being under my protection?”

Lin Tianzhan sweated hard and quickly said, “Ancestral God, please forgive us. We never slacked off. It is very likely that this monster’s true body is an Ancestral God. We’ve already tried our best; there’s nothing else we can do.”

“Humph. No Ancestral God would waste time building clones.” The indifferent voice was filled with disdain. “We seek the path to transcend. Creating clones is pointless; we’ve already been through all the worldly tribulations that we should go through. No Ancestral God would use them. Besides, I don’t feel any connection between him and an Ancestral God. He is an authentic God King!”

Lin Tianzhan was appalled. Su Ping’s body has his true self?

He had overheard the conversation between Yan Qing and Su Ping, and thought that Su Ping was indeed an incarnation. However, he knew that the Ancestral God would never lie; if the latter said there was no connection, there couldn’t be any!

Could it be that… Su Ping was only lying to reassure Yan Qing and the others?

He came in person to provoke the Rain Clan. How bold is he?

No wonder he escaped… Lin Tianzhan reached a sudden realization, understanding why the young man had left in a hurry after killing the royal prince of the Chentian Clan. So, he was truly worried that the Ancestral God would show up and kill him!

“You’ve completely disgraced me. If you’re so incompetent, maybe I should kill you all and start a new batch!” The Rain Emperor’s voice was cold and expressionless. His words made the Rain Emperor and Lin Tianzhan have goosebumps all over their bodies. They took their superior’s words as true; after all, Ancestral Gods could create and destroy anything with ease! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

One person was an entire clan!

As long as the Ancestral God was alive, any clans they created would become high-ranked clans.

That was the reason why such figures were powerful, and why the middle-ranked vassal races were trying their best to raise Ancestral Gods of their own.

The Rain Emperor said in a hurry and kowtowed heavily, “Ancestral God, please forgive us!”

Lin Tianzhan also lowered his head in panic, shedding all of his emperor’s pride. Ancestral Gods were irreplaceable, while emperors were just ants in front of them.

“Humph!”

Instantly, a terrifying power was spread out. However, the aura vanished all of a sudden; the heavy and mysterious pressure of the Ancestral God also disappeared.

Both the Rain Emperor and Lin Tianzhan were somehow relieved, knowing that the Ancestral God had taken action.

In the void, somewhere in the deep space.

Su Ping was leaving the Rain Clan territory at full speed, rushing after merging with the young Chaos Beast. He then found himself in the sky above another continent.

Su Ping wouldn’t die, but he preferred to not reveal his ease to resurrect.

“Huh?”

All of a sudden, Su Ping changed his expression.

The void around him was instantly frozen. All the Great Dao under Su Ping’s control was solidified, the power wrested from him!

Su Ping struggled to turn his head, using all his strength to move his body a little bit. Then, he saw a glowing figure walking in the void behind his back. The figure was untainted, seemingly beyond this world. His gait was slow, but he brought forth a strong deadly threat with every step he took.

He moved closer. With every step, Su Ping felt that all his blood was being squeezed out of him. His body was expanding and about to explode!

Just the pressure of the guy walking was almost unbearable for the young man.

Was that the power that an Ancestral God could reveal?

Su Ping did not panic. Rather, with intense fighting will in his eyes, he gnashed his teeth and said, “You’re the Ancestral God of the Rain Clan. Are you going to bully someone who’s two levels weaker than you? Are all the God Emperors of the Rain Clan so useless that they had to ask their old ancestor for help?”
