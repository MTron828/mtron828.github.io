Chapter 1497: The Ultimate Cultivation Site (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

She recalled Basha’s memories, so she didn’t think there was another Ancestral God among humans.

That being the case, even if Su Ping had hidden some of his strength, it would be impossible for him to defeat the three of them.

Besides… They didn’t represent the entirety of their top forces. They were still hiding something.

As she thought of this, Elaine could only say that the human was innocent and trusting.

She looked at the dark universe through the Dao Crystal as she flew forward, feeling sad at the thought of permanently leaving the universe where she was born.

It had been a brilliant place once, with dazzling nebulae and countless flying spaceships. However, only desolation remained.

The debris of many spaceships floated in the void; part of it was already covered in thick dust. Some of the bodies of her powerful compatriots were frozen in the void.

“The Heavens…”

Hatred surfaced in Elaine’s eyes. She wasn’t an Ancestral God when the war broke out, only a Dao Heart expert.

A hundred thousand years after the war, the gore still haunted and tortured her day and night. She was eventually awakened, and became an Ancestral God.

…

Time flew.

A week passed in the blink of an eye.

On the continent—

All the human Celestials became dominators, using one of the three Dao Hearts presented by Su Ping, according to their preference. It would be impossible for them to become Ancestral Gods after receiving a preselected Dao Heart, but that was already a great gift for them.

After all, they could barely reach the Dao Heart State with their own potential.

The Dao Crystal was gradually flown to the other side of the universe as the week passed. They encountered two more Dao Crystal worlds on the way; one of them had an Ancestral God cyborg.

Altogether four Dao Crystals were moving towards the edge of the universe.

Elaine and the others were silent as they watched the wall protecting the universe ever closer. They knew they would never return.

They could vaguely feel the will of the universe when they were about to leave. It was a very gentle power, whispering goodbye to her children like a mother would.

Elaine and the other Ancestral Gods’ had moist eyes. Only they—being Ancestral Gods—could feel the will of the universe, and the profound feelings therein.

They had relied on their talent and the help of the Universe’s Origin as they grew. That kind of help couldn’t be felt until they became Ancestral Gods, and could only ascribe it to their luck.

However, there was a law behind everything. The rise of the sun, the setting of the stars, and even the falling snowflakes were all made of the Great Dao, somehow predestined.

Destruction, birth, recreation, and death. This was just a miniature, a tiny gear on an enormous wheel that pushed the greater fate.

They silently said goodbye in their hearts. Then, they saw the universe split open, to find a strange channel outside.

That was a channel that the universe had opened for them. It led to somewhere safe.

It was also the last thing the universe would do for them.

Elaine and the others gritted their teeth and flew into the twisted channel without hesitation.

Time was paused there. The area inside the channel was a strange place where time and space didn’t matter. They were already far in a distant location when they got out on the other end of the channel.

The vortex slowly closed and dispersed behind them.

The cyborg universe’s aura was gone, just like that.

They gazed in silence, and showed their highest respects according to cyborg etiquette. It was the first time for them to use that gesture since they became Ancestral Gods.

After paying respects, the tall and slim cyborg took out a map and a festering severed hand; even some bones were showing. However, it emitted the aura of immortality, as if it had existed for countless years.

The severed hand floated in the void. Then, it slowly raised the index finger and pointed to a certain direction.

The tall and slim cyborg heaved a sigh of relief. He stored the hand and said, “Let’s go.”

They returned to the Dao Crystal and concealed their auras, carefully erasing all of their traces as they moved.

Inside the Dao Crystal, on the continent—Su Ping looked on with hands behind his back, completely silent.

He had seen how the cyborgs escaped the universe. They had fled succesfully with the help of the Universe’s Origin.

“We’ve already found the direction. We should be able to get there soon, as long as we’re careful.” Elaine’s figure was formed near Su Ping as a gentle light.

“How soon exactly?”

“Soon means soon. Three hundred years, perhaps,” said Elaine.

Su Ping nodded and said, “Thank you for your hard work in advance.”

“You’re still planning on letting me control the crystal?” asked Elaine.

Su Ping said, “I’m planning on cultivating for a while. Find my people if you need anything. They’ll inform me.”

She couldn’t help but say, “You already have an undying universe. The next realm belongs to the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors; it’s not a level that we can reach through cultivation. Cultivating is pointless from this point on. Aren’t you being too careless if you’re only cultivating?”

“How do you know it won’t work if you don’t try? Besides, I’m not trying to reach higher levels. In any case, I’ll always become stronger as long as I keep cultivating, even if just a little bit,” said Su Ping.

Elaine touched her forehead and said, “Are all humans as weird as you?”

“I don’t think so.”

After saying goodbye to her, Su Ping returned to the pet store and asked the system in his heart, “System, you can sense the things around the store, right? Can you send messages inside the cultivation sites if anything happens?”

“Yes, but it’s not free,” said the system casually, “Don’t be nervous. It only costs a hundred thousand energy points.”

Su Ping’s lips twitched. The system was truly as greedy as ever.

It was just a simple notification. It was clearly taking advantage of him.

Su Ping shook his head, unwilling to argue with the system. His store was always filled with Ascendant guests every day, who took Ascendant-level pets for training. That tiny bit of expenditure was nothing compared to his abundant income.

After passing by the counter, Su Ping asked Joanna for a list of pets that required professional training. He then picked them in the pet room.

He was strong enough to sign temporary contracts through the Contract Dao Heart, without the need of the system’s temporary contract.

He could also randomly bond or release pets without suffering soul exhaustion after canceling a contract.

His understanding of the Great Dao was perfect after reaching the Ancestral God level. He was now even more unbelievable than the Creator.

After all, the Creator only created one universe.

That could easily be done by someone with cultivation in the Celestial State.

After picking the pets, Su Ping brought up the sites’ listing. He didn’t browse through the list this time, since he focused on the very first name, which was also the hidden cultivation site above all the other cultivation sites: the Remains of High Heavens!

The ticket to enter that site was very expensive. A hundred million energy points per visit.

Every resurrection would cost a million energy points.

Su Ping didn’t have much savings in the past. Also, judging from the ticket fee, it was an extremely dangerous place. Even if he went there, he would probably be killed in a flash. That kind of trip used to be pointless.

However, things were different now. He had become as strong as the best experts in history after breaking through. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Only the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors were stronger than him.

He now felt confident of exploring that place.

He wanted to find out how dangerous the place was, to deserve such an unbelievable ticket fee.

“Warning! The host is about to enter a chaos-level cultivation site. The ticket fee is a hundred million energy points. Please confirm!” The system’s solemn voice made Su Ping’s heart race.

He replied without hesitation, “Confirm.”

He soon noticed how his store was a hundred million points short. But before he could feel the pinch, he saw the transportation vortex open. The vortex itself emitted an ominous aura, as if some sort of unknown power had invaded the store.
