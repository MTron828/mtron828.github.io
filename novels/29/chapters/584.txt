Chapter 585 The Deep Caves

“Don’t waste my time. Where is Su Lingyue?”

Su Ping gazed into Nan Fengtian’s eyes. His instinct told him that Su Lingyue’s disappearance had something to do with Nan Fengtian.

The student produced a forced smile, “Sir, Mr. Su, I really don’t know where she is. I just learned about what happened to her. I’ve been cultivating...”

Pff!

Nan Fengtian was forced to stop talking because one of his arms was torn off. Blood gushed out.

That sudden strike caught Nan Fengtian off guard. It even took him a few seconds to feel the pain. He eyed Su Ping with terror and the killing intent in Su Ping’s eyes told him that the young man didn’t believe him at all. No matter what he said, Su Ping would kill him!

Putting his hand to staunch the wound, Nan Fengtian stepped back. “Sir, you’re wrong about me!”

“Fate Challenger Su!”

Yun Wanli could not stand to see his student go through that cruel treatment. He put himself in front of Su Ping. “Fate Challenger Su, you have no proof, so I hope that you show mercy. Nan Fengtian is our student and a descendant of a legendary battle pet warrior. His forefathers stayed in the Deep Caves and made great sacrifices for humankind. He does not deserve this...”

“Move!” Su Ping said without any emotions.

“Fate Challenger Su!”

Yun Wanli pulled a long face and unleashed his astral powers. He knew that he couldn’t defeat Su Ping, but he couldn’t stand the sight of Su Ping hurting his student right there.

“Mr. Su, I understand your sister is missing...” Han Yuxiang wanted to calm Su Ping down as well.

However, Su Ping disappeared right in front of Yun Wanli. He re-emerged in front of Nan Fengtian; he placed a hand around Nan Fengtian’s neck and picked him up off the ground.

Yun Wanli was afraid; he knew that something bad was going to happen the moment Su Ping vanished. The latter already had Nan Fengtian in his grasp.

“Fate Challenger Su!” Yun Wanli shouted. His hair and beard were dancing in the air. He was boiling with anger.

“No one can save you today. I am going to ask you one more time. Where is Su Lingyue?” Su Ping said to Nan Fengtian. Nan Fengtian felt he was under more pressure than when he reached the 19th level. His face blushed because of the suffocation and he had to squeeze out his reply, “How dare you say that I’m lying? You have no proof and you are slandering me. I’m a good guy...”

“My words are proof. I say you’re lying so you are lying.” Su Ping said those bold words. He didn’t do anything but a cut appeared on Nan Fengtian’s chest. Blood was spilling out.

“Tell me or I will not only execute you but your entire family!” Su Ping claimed. Nan Fengtian’s heart was pounding with a mix of fear and anger. He bit his teeth and turned his gaze to Yun Wanli. “Sir, help...” The Principal was afraid to act given that Su Ping had Nan Fengtian in his hands. “Fate Challenger Su, I’ve treated you with respect but you’ve only paid me back with contempt. Do you really want to turn hostile to us and the entire humankind?”. “So what?”

Su Ping turned over and continued indifferently, “I’ve visited the Tower. Those people were just a bunch of vermin. Say one more thing and I will kill you too.”

“You-hmph!

Yun Wanli was purple with rage.

Fei Tianyi and the girl could not believe what they had just heard Su Ping say.

The Principal was at the legendary rank and Su Ping still claimed that he would kill him regardless?

Han Yuxiang was trembling. He had heard stories about Su Ping. He didn’t dare to move at all for fear that he would further enrage that relentless killer. Su Ping could drown the entire academy in blood!

Nan Fengtian could not hide the fear in his eyes. Once Su Ping’s eyes fell on him again, with a pale face and with trembling lips, Nan Fengtian said, “I, I will tell you. Miss Su is in the Deep Caves...” It never occurred to Su Ping that Nan Fengtian would give up that easily. Su Ping turned pale with fright when he heard the name. “What did you just say? Say that again!” Su Ping stared at Nan Fengtian with a frightening look.

He came to know about the Deep Caves during the Supremacy League.

He understood that the Tower would have to send legendary battle pet warriors to the perilous Deep Caves all year round. Nan Fengtian was on the verge of being strangled to death. He struggled with all his might to squeeze some words out, “I, I’m telling the truth...”

Su Ping stared at Nan Fengtian as if he were a demon. It took Su Ping a few seconds to contain his killing intent. He loosened his grip a bit and asked, “What is she doing in the Deep Caves?”

Nan Fengtian’s voice trembled. “She, she wanted to go herself. She said she wanted to train there...”

Su Ping fell silent.

Right then, Yun Wanli and Han Yuxiang had approached them. Yun Wanli was happy to see that Su Ping was getting less angry. “You just said that you didn’t know. When did Miss Su go to the Deep Caves? Why didn’t you stop her?” Yun Wanli scolded Nan Fengtian.

“Why didn’t you? That’s a dangerous place. Even legendary battle pet warriors can die there. It’s no different from courting death,” Han Yuxiang added.

“I, I couldn’t stop her...” Nan Fengtian sounded sorry.

“You...” Yun Wanli heaved a sigh as he looked at the innocent-looking Nan Fengtian before he said to Su Ping, “Fate Challenger Su, we have no time to lose. I’ll go with you to find your sister now.” “Sister?”

Nan Fengtian didn’t know that the man was Su Lingyue’s big brother.

Nan Fengtian gulped.

Su Ping darted a glance at Yun Wanli and then his eyes landed on Nan Fengtian’s face again; his voice sounded deadly and stripped of all emotions when he spoke. “She wouldn’t have gone there for no reason; and even if she insisted, she wouldn’t have directly avoided you. Ji Feng has already told me why the surveillance didn’t work around the Dragon Tower.”

Nan Fengtian instantly turned pale. He trembled and his knees almost buckled with fright. Crying, he said, “I, I didn’t mean to. I just thought it would be fun to say it and she went. I didn’t mean to hurt her...”

Yun Wanli could not believe that.

Han Yuxiang was startled first and a cloud obscured his face.

The students could not believe that the ever proud and distant Nan Fengtian would end up in that humiliating position one day. He was begging; it was an ugly sight.

They were also able to tell that the girl’s disappearance was because of him.

Su Ping lowered his head. A glint of killing intent flashed past his eyes. Bang. Nan Fengtian turned into pieces of flesh and drops of blood.

The glint of killing intent disappeared in Su Ping’s eyes. He turned around and asked Yun Wanli, “Where’s the closest entrance to the Deep Caves?”

Yun Wanli came back to his senses. He was appalled by the scattered remains and the pool of blood. Still, he had to answer. “He must have been speaking of the place that our academy is responsible for. I will take you there right away.”

Su Ping frowned. “On-campus?”

“Yes.”

Yun Wanli nodded and said to Han Yuxiang, “Close the Dragon Tower for now and send someone to guard it. I will go to the Deep Caves with Fate Challenger and come back as soon as we find Miss Su.”

Han Yuxiang nodded. “Mr. Su, I am sorry. I failed. I won’t absolve myself from the blame...” said Han Yuxiang with guilt.

“If I cannot find her, you will follow her to the underworld,” Su Ping warned Han Yuxiang before he took off.

Han Yuxiang was colorless and could barely stand.

Finding Su Lingyue in the Deep Caves?

Even Han Yuxiang lacked the courage to go there on his own.

Not to mention the fact that Su Lingyue had been missing for a week. She had been there for at least seven days and the odds of her still being alive was close to zero!

Yun Wanli heard that warning as well, but he couldn’t change the past. He just prayed that Su Ping’s sister was a lucky girl or else he would be unable to stop Su Ping when the latter returned to start a killing spree.

He had learned from Su Ping’s move just then that he was much much weaker.

The tension over the Graveyard Forest disappeared as Su Ping and Yun Wanli left. The students looked at each other in speechless astonishment. If it weren’t for the remains on the ground, they would have thought that everything had just been an illusion.

“Senior Nan is dead, just like that.”

“He was so young when he reached the 19th level and he came from a family with a legendary battle pet warrior. He could have become one in the future. But he’s gone.”

“I heard that Senior Nan and Su Lingyue had some disputes. I didn’t believe it then.”

“Pah, such a cruel guy. He tricked Miss Su into entering the Deep Caves. That is plain murder.”

“Oh shut up. This isn’t the first time this has happened, no need to make a fuss. All I can say is that this Nan guy struck a rock.”

“Right. The Nan family is doomed!”

The students discussed. Some had abandoned the name “Senior Nan” and would refer to the deceased as “the Nan guy.” A dead talent was a loser that no one would remember.

“Which rank... is he at?”

Qin Shaotian and his friends gazed as Su Ping took his leave.

Su Ping was bold enough to kill students in front of the Principal and claimed that he could also kill the Principal. They found that Su Ping was an enigma.

Is he above the legendary rank?

Really?

“I didn’t know that the new girl’s brother was such a monster...” the girl surnamed Guo said, her heart still fluttering with fear.

Fei Tianyi clenched his fingers.

Fei, Nan, Ji, Guo.

Nan Fengtian had ranked second. Even though Nan Fengtian’s combat strength was weaker, his spirit was stronger. Fei Tianyi had always viewed him as a powerful rival. However, Nan Fengtian died, crushed by Su Ping as if he were merely a piece of paper. Genius? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

All of a sudden, that word sounded ironic to Fei Tianyi.

He had thought that no one would be able to kill him easily since he had combat strength close to the titled rank.

However, he then understood he was as weak as an ant in front of a truly powerful man.

“And you said he was less than 24? Really?” The girl was still curious.

Fei Tianyi curled his lips. “However strong you are, there’s always someone stronger. I suggest you spend the time wondering about this on cultivation. You’re too weak. You can’t even catch up with me...”

“I @ #...”

The girl stomped her feet. “Oh shut the hell up. I’m just asking you a question. And however strong you are, there’s always someone stronger... What? I am bound to reach the legendary one day. You can get a headstart but wait and see how I will exceed you!

“Bah.”

Fei Tianyi sneered and left without further ado.

“Damn you!” The girl stomped her feet again before she left.
