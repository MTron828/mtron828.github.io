Chapter 774: Compensation

Su Ping looked at the pets and ignored them.

Perhaps due to the Little Skeleton and his other pets, Su Ping had always been tolerant of other people’s pets and would prefer to take care of the battle pet warriors first, instead of dealing with the pets.

Whoosh!

Su Ping left the tertiary space with his pets and went back to the outside world through the secondary space.

The giant hand from his Force Field was instantly dispersed.

Su Ping approached the red-haired young man and said indifferently, “Don’t try to flee, or I’ll chop off your head the moment you take action. Give it a try if you don’t believe me.”

That was quite a threat.

The red-haired young man, who was struggling to leave, stopped moving and asked, “What do you want?”

The astonishing speed that Su Ping had shown in the earlier battle was too high for him; he wasn’t confident of making it out alive.

He could tear into the fourth space and break free or fight Su Ping there, but it would take time for him to enter the fourth space. Besides, when considering the distance between him and Su Ping, he would probably be chopped up to pieces even before he got into the fourth space!

That guy was undoubtedly in the mid phase of the Star State!

Maybe not even O’Neil himself would be strong enough to defeat him!

“You offended me, and yet you’re asking me what I want?” asked Su Ping indifferently while looking down at him.

In the meantime—

On the back street, Cleo, Mia and the other Void State people returned to the outside world from the secondary space.

Filius was among them.

Although he was at the Ocean State, he had Void State pets that could help him enter the secondary space.

Filius’ head was a mess at the moment, attempting to overcome the shock.

He wasn’t able to clearly see the recent battle, but the scene in front of his eyes was already astounding enough. The formerly high and mighty Star State expert was talking to Su Ping while lying on the ground.

Su Ping, on the other hand, was looking down at him as the victor.

That was a Star State expert!

He was an expert just like O’Neil, the planet’s dominator; a being able to travel through the universe without the need of vehicles!

Still, such a man had been defeated by Su Ping!

The boss of that tiny shop was also a Star State expert. Filius remembered his past actions before Su Ping. He didn’t feel he had done anything inappropriate back then, but still, it had been too bold and outrageous of him, once he realized Su Ping’s identity!

He would probably be beaten and punished severely if anyone of his family ever learned that he had spoken to a Star State warrior so impolitely!

Filius became more horrified as he mulled over the situation. He already started to consider how he should apologize to Su Ping.

Cleo was standing nearby; she was stupefied to a stronger degree because she knew that the man Su Ping had just defeated was one of her family’s honored guests!

There was obviously a grudge between him and the Ryan family!

No wonder Su Ping wasn’t at all interested in her previous offer when she hoped to cut in line!

Cleo found her answer, but she was slightly confused. If there were conflicts between Su Ping and the Ryans, why did he accept her professional training request?

Is he intending to kill my pets?

The thought scared her, but she soon thought otherwise, because he could have easily killed her on the spot if he really wanted to harm her.

Cleo was so confused that she couldn’t think straight.

Mia was just as shocked. She didn’t expect that the boss of a random shop on a tier-3 planet would be a Star State expert!

Her father was right; certain experts loved keeping a low profile. It would be for the best to never be arrogant when moving outside!

No wonder the training effect of this shop is so shocking. Even someone with Star State level can only work as a manager. There must be a master trainer in the shop, if not a three-starred grandmaster trainer!

Mia was quite shocked. Even the leader of the Laiyefa family had to treat grandmaster trainers politely, always making an effort to not piss them off.

After all, grandmaster trainers could raise Star Lord pets, and they often made friends with many Star Lords given their special profession. Offending a grandmaster trainer was tantamount to affronting a group of Star Lords, which was all kinds of bad.

The entire street was quiet at the moment; nobody dared to even breathe aloud.

While still inside a pit on the street, the red-haired young man wore a complicated expression. He gnashed his teeth and said, “It’s true that I offended you first. I’m willing to compensate!”

“How?” replied Su Ping casually.

“How do you want me to compensate?” The red-haired young man became a lot more hopeful after hearing that Su Ping wasn’t determined to kill him.

Su Ping said coldly, “Your life is in my hands. Your partners have escaped; nobody will come to rescue you. Now, name a price for your life.”

The young man’s expression had a slight change. Given Su Ping’s peaceful tone, he had already guessed that his partners had either died or escaped.

He was slightly relieved to hear that they were still alive, but he still felt horrible.

The red-haired young man pulled himself together and looked at Su Ping, begging, “I’ll give you all my secret treasures and wealth. How’s that sound?”

“I can get all that after I kill you,” said Su Ping calmly.

The young man looked terrible.

Su Ping was implying that those things didn’t belong to him anymore, and he had to trade other stuff in exchange for his life!

However...

Strong people like him always took their valuable items with them, except for their houses and other assets that couldn’t be carried.

Otherwise, the valuable items wouldn’t belong to them anymore after they died.

The red-haired young man gritted his teeth and made up his mind. “Do you want money? I can give you money. If you don’t need money, I have sources to buy some rare items; I can buy them and give them to you. I also have invitations that are limited in number. I can give them to you, so that you can join certain top circles...”

They were all the additional treasures that he could offer.

For instance, he had joined certain circles thanks to a lot of effort. Such circles only welcomed a limited number of people; money and Star State rank wasn’t enough to get in.

“Really?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows after hearing what the young man said, not expecting that he could really offer something interesting.

He thought for a moment, but then felt slightly uncomfortable to be watched by so many people. “Okay, get up. Let’s talk in my shop.”

The red-haired young man was relieved to feel that Su Ping’s killing intent was gone. He nodded and stood up; he also recalled his pets that were still in the tertiary space.

Su Ping led the young man into the shop and didn’t relax until they entered the shop’s safe area. He would be able to suppress him with the power of the system once they were inside.If the system refused to help, he could still ask Joanna to take care of him.

While Joanna’s reincarnation wasn’t at the Star State yet, that red-haired young man was probably unable to beat her.

After all, Joanna knew much more laws and truths than Su Ping did, and her methods were imaginable. Her real combat ability was even more horrifying than Su Ping’s pets combined.

Obviously, the young man didn’t know he had entered an inescapable place. He only knew that his life was momentarily out of danger. Once he relaxed, he then noticed that the whole street had been turned into a mess because of their fight, and some of the shops across the street had collapsed.

However, Su Ping’s shop remained absolutely intact. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He again remembered that their joint attacks didn’t shake Su Ping’s shop and could only smile bitterly, becoming even more wary of Su Ping.

He was even more wary of Su Ping than he was of O’Neil.

O’Neil was his friend, and was only 30% wary of him.

However, he was 120% wary of Su Ping!

After all, Su Ping was bold enough to stay there after killing a student of the Hugh Mia Academy, one of the best academies in Silvy.

Su Ping was only slightly stronger than himself, still far off from the peak of the Star State, but, who knew if someone stronger was backing him?

It would make sense that he had the courage to kill a student of a prestigious academy if he had a Star Lord supporter.

The red-haired young man was even more scared and regretful when he thought of this possibility. He was a respected Star State warrior, but got defeated after standing up for O’Neil’s grandson. It was so not worth it!

Although that grandson had been an excellent seed, he was just a grandson anyway!

He had the potential to reach the Star State, but only the “potential.” He could only reach that level if he grew up smoothly, without any trouble.

Still, life was never smooth. Setbacks and sufferings were the norm!
