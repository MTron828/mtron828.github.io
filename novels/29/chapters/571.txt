Chapter 573 The Dragon Tower

“Vice Principal?”

Xu Kuang was also surprised to see him. He recognized that the new arrival was Han Yuxiang, the Vice Principal he had seen once during orientation!

He was a great man. His statues stood in many places on campus and the plaques listed his great contributions! This man knows Su Ping?

“I won’t talk to ask about why you took this long to tell me about this incident. Let’s talk about the disappearance of my younger sister first.” Su Ping went straight to the point.

Han Yuxiang felt his heart had stopped for two seconds, fearing that Su Ping would teach him a lesson right there.

He knew all too well how bold Su Ping was.

He wasn’t a resident from the Longjiang Base City but he had been keeping tabs on Su Ping ever since he left the base city.

It was impossible to not be concerned about such a dangerous man.

The Tang family had returned with defeat and great losses; the Star Organization had been forced to give Su Ping gifts and apologize to him. The young man was a monster that no rule could stop!

“Mr. Su, please, allow me to explain,” Han Yuxiang blurted out.

Su Ping glared at him. “I told you that we won’t talk about you now. Tell me about my sister. Don’t you dare waste another second. My sister can be in greater danger with every passing second. Give me the short version if you want to keep your life. Now!”

Mo Fengping and Xu Kuang were overwhelmed by disbelief.

It was as if Su Ping were talking to one of his servants!

But Han Yuxiang was a famous titled battle pet warrior!

Han Yuxiang felt cold sweat was oozing out of his forehead. “Sure, sure. The thing is, your sister entered the Dragon Tower to train seven days ago. We haven’t heard from her since then. I have verified the access records of those who have entered the Dragon Tower. She did go there.”

“I sent people to search the Dragon Tower, with the exception of the levels that not even I or the most talented students can go to, but we couldn’t find her anywhere.

“I then got the surveillance video in that area but something went wrong and the camera stopped working

“I had people search on campus but no one has been able to find her. I even paid a visit to Clairvoyance to ask for their help, but it’s been days and they haven’t told me anything. I had no other choice but to ask Fengping to go to Longjiang Base City. After all, the Otherworld Heavenly King was there. I thought your sister might have snuck home once she heard...” Han Yuxiang told Su Ping everything in one breath; he ended up gasping for breath at the end. Maybe he had been talking too fast, he also had to gulp to clear his throat; he wondered if Su Ping would find that explanation satisfactory.

“Why didn’t you tell me right away?” Su Ping asked.

Han Yuxiang produced a forced smile. He whispered, “I thought I could find her. I would have troubled you for nothing if I would have been able to handle it and warned you anyway.”

Su Ping stared at Han Yuxiang. He was able to tell that the latter was lying, but he also found out why Han Yuxiang wasted all that time. He was afraid of punishment.

“Show me to that tower,” Su Ping said.

Han Yuxiang was relieved to find that Su Ping had not resorted to violence yet. He nodded and showed the way as if he were a simple doorman.

Mo Fengping and Xu Kuang’s minds had stopped working.

Han Yuxiang was no longer that majestic and detached titled battle pet warrior to them. They would have never imagined that a man like Han Yuxiang could be that weak-kneed.

Xu Kuang looked at Su Ping, his mind blank.

He had always known that Su Ping was a powerful and talented man. That being said, Han Yuxiang was at the titled rank after all, being the Vice Principal of the academy to boot. He was a man of many honors!

After Xu Kuang had gone through so much suffering in the academy, he knew more than ever how privileged a man like Han Yuxiang was. However, Han Yuxiang was terrified, not even daring to protest when Su Ping was rude. If anything, he was afraid he would upset Su Ping further.

Mo Fengping also baffled. He still had no idea about what was going on. “Let’s go,” Su Ping ordered the Inferno Dragon.

Han Yuxiang waved his hand to deactivate the seal and lead the way.

The guards posted by the entrance were stunned speechless. They wondered who Su Ping was. Why would Han Yuxiang go there in person and offer apologies to him? What a terrifying man.

Boom!

The Inferno Dragon stepped over into the campus.

The seal was rarely deactivated; everyone had to get in or out with their IDs. Han Yuxiang was making an exception for Su Ping. As a matter of fact, riding on a huge battle pet on campus was against the rules, but it was clear that Han Yuxiang was not going to bother Su Ping about it.

While sitting on the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder, Xu Kuang shouted to that group of young men, “Give me back my ID!”

The young men looked at each other, hesitating. They could tell that Su Ping was not a common man and they felt a bit scared since Xu Kuang had some sort of connection with him.

“What ID? Don’t lie. We don’t have it.”

“Right. You must have lost it. Don’t blame us for your mistakes.”

The young men hurried to wash their hands off the problem.

Xu Kuang was furious. “You grabbed it. Don’t you lie about it!”

Su Ping told the Inferno Dragon to stop. He glanced over at the young men. “Give him back his ID.”

“Sir, we didn’t take his ID. Don’t listen to him.”

“Sir, listen to me. I am part of the Hong family of the Yanxiao Base City...”

“Sir!”

The young men hurried to name their origin and status, but the dragon had lifted its paw before they could finish. All light was blotted. The young men turned pale, fearing that the dragon’s paw was going to land on them.

Bang, bang, bang!

The dragon’s paw did land on them.

The ground trembled. The young men were unable to get out. They were flattened.

That sudden event shocked Mo Fengping, Xu Kuang, as well as the guards. No one saw it coming!

Su Ping killed some students in public, right there!

One of the students was a talent from the Hong family of the Yanxiao Base City and he died. What should the school tell the Hong family?

The other students were also from some influential families.

Han Yuxiang soon calmed himself down. Even though his heart was racing because of the deep killing intent he perceived from Su Ping, Han Yuxiang was afraid to say anything to put any blame on Su Ping. “Mr. Su, you don’t have to deal with them yourself. See, your pet’s paw got dirty.” Han Yuxiang even had to apologize.

Su Ping pointed out coldly, “They had Xu Kuang’s blood on them. They clearly had Xu Kuang’s ID and yet they lied to me, and to you. They deserved to die.”

Mo Fengping opened his mouth but no words came out.

The thing that surprised him, even more, was his teacher’s reaction. What a mad world it was.

“Sir...”

Xu Kuang turned to Su Ping. He would have never expected for Su Ping to straight out kill those young thugs for his sake. Of course, Xu Kuang did wish for the chance to have skinned those bullies. But despite all of his anger and hatred, he didn’t have the ability to make it happen, not in years to come. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Still, Su Ping had helped him vent his anger.

The Inferno Dragon lifted its paw, revealing the pool of blood; it used its nails to carefully fish out a chain from the mess and then threw it to Su Ping.

Su Ping didn’t catch it; the chain was transferred to Xu Kuang.

The Inferno Dragon continued on its way. Its stomps made the ground tremble.

“Sir...”

Xu Kuang stared at his ID and bit his lip.

He knew that Su Ping had never told anyone that Xu Kuang was his student. Xu Kuang was the one with a thick enough face to address him as his teacher. And yet, Su Ping had been willing to resolve the matter for him. All the students whom Su Ping killed had strong connections; he had learned that fact after being bullied for a long time.

Even so, Su Ping was willing to help him. Xu Kuang didn’t know what he could ever do to repay him.

Xu Kuang kept his head low and remained silent; no one was able to tell what he was thinking

Mo Fengping had gathered himself by that point. Since his teacher had not accused Su Ping of anything, he could not, either. He would glance at Su Ping from the corner of his eye every now and then. He felt suffocated even by merely standing next to the young

man.

Han Yuxiang showed the way and the Inferno Dragon walked down the boulevard. Its paws left many indentations on the ground. The streets and boulevards on campus were very tough; the Inferno Dragon was not strong enough to destroy them completely.

Some students were stunned by the sight along the way. The fact that Han Yuxiang was in front of the Inferno Dragon caused more of a sensation.

er seen a

Everyone in the academy knew Han Yuxiang. No one had ever seen anyone riding on a large battle pet on campus. “Who is that?”

“I think he’s the Vice Principal’s guest.”

“Is that Mr. Mo there? Who is that dude? He’s covered in blood.”

“Let’s go and have a look.”

Many students went after the Inferno Dragon, fed by curiosity.

They could not think of anyone able to ride on such a large battle pet on campus with the Vice Principal showing the way. Is that man a legendary battle pet warrior?

That possibility worked like a charm. More and more students began to gather behind the Inferno Dragon. It would be thrilling to know if that man was indeed at the legendary rank.

A legendary rank battle pet warrior was visiting the academy and they, the students, were lucky enough to meet a legend!
