Chapter 1411: Emperor Yen (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The most upsetting matter for the Rain Emperor was that they had failed to execute Su Ping within that powerful suppression. Just then, the power displayed by the human suppressed what most emperors could muster; it wouldn’t be outrageous to say that he was a top emperor.

Besides, he didn’t see Su Ping use any special treasure; it was the young man’s own power.

To be precise, it was the power coming from the latter’s strange Dao Heart.

He suppressed the Netherworld and even robbed Mo Shou of his weapon. What kind of Dao Heart is that??The Rain Emperor’s eyes were cold as he clenched his fists. He knew he had to kill Su Ping that very day, even if he had to fight in person!

“Don’t give him any respite! Attack and get this over with!” the Rain Emperor ordered.

The four of them exchanged looks and charged at Su Ping again.

They were peers and fellow clansmen, quite familiar with each other’s power and their teamwork was flawless. Su Ping was immediately suppressed by their universes at the same time. He was on the verge of losing!

Nobody could win against that many enemies. Su Ping was indeed strong, but he was being forced to retreat due to their neatly coordinated attacks. The four emperors were using the power of their respective universes; ones were strange and unpredictable, while the others couldn’t be countered. The young human was being constantly injured as they fought.

Seeing this scene, Elder Yan demanded the Rain Emperor in fury. “Rain Clan, don’t be too shameless. Are you trying to make me step in?”

The Rain Emperor looked at her coldly and said, “It was your Dao Child who was rude first. I said that unless he begged on his knees, he would have to pay with his life for what he did. How can the dignity of a high-ranked clan be ignored?”

“But you’re not giving us a chance to apologize!” Elder Yan was angry.

“I did give it to you, but he didn’t cherish it. It won’t be given again!” said the Rain Clan coldly. “If you attack, our Ancestral God will be awakened. None of them will get away!”

His expression was enough for her and the others to know he was being serious. The elders were furious, as they could also tell that the Rain Emperor was determined to kill Su Ping. It was very likely that he would ask for the Ancestral God’s help if they intervened.

It was understandable if they were in his shoes, considering Su Ping’s potential. None of them would have dared to let such a terrifying enemy off the hook.

However, how could they possibly watch Su Ping die when he was such a promising talent?

“Guys, this is of paramount importance. Go tell the president. If the Rain Clan requests the help of their Ancestral God, the Heaven Path Institute must fight back!” Elder Yan gnashed her teeth.

The elders looked at each other in bewilderment. They never thought they would trigger a war of Ancestral Gods because of them. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Elder Chan quickly agreed, “That’s right; we can’t let the Dao Child fall. He’s just a God King, and he can already fight with emperors. He will surely become an Ancestral God!”

The other elders were in shock, but hesitation was thrown out the window. Some of them turned around and left.

The Rain Emperor became even colder upon seeing their actions; however, he knew it was impossible to stop them since they were also emperors. He could probably stop one of them, but not several at the same time.

“Emperor Yen, I ask for your help to suppress this thief, immediately!” said the Rain Emperor telepathically.

The one summoned was an extremely old emperor of the Rain Clan. Although he had yet to become an Ancestral God, he was an old monster in his own right. The expert was already an emperor back when he was still a God King.

A long sigh resounded. “How long has it been? Have we been buried for such a long time that such a genius has already sprouted?”

Then, from the depths of the Rain Clan’s mountains—a deep and terrifying aura began to spread. With presence belying an ancient nature, a figure took a single step and entered the Netherworld Scroll, crossing all the mountains.

Su Ping, who was fighting the four emperors fiercely, suddenly trembled and sensed a terrifying aura.

The aura was akin to that of a corpse and a mighty god. It was powerful and nigh invincible.

He suddenly raised his head and narrowed his eyes. He then saw an old man with unkempt hair who wore ragged clothes. The ancient fellow stood in the distance, with stars that were as profound as the universe.

“Emperor Yen!”

Emperor Lie, Emperor Feng and the others were shocked, not expecting their chief to ask that old emperor to take action. He was one of the ancestors of the clan; still a peer, but none of the emperors thought they could beat him. He was one of the top emperors.

“Emperor Yen!”

Elder Yan and the others outside the barrier also saw the newcomers and their expressions changed, shocked by the clan’s ruthlessness; they actually asked such an old monster for help.

She gave a gloomy roar and charged into the Netherworld Scroll.

“Emperor Yen, let’s trade some blows!” declared Elder Yan. Although she had a girly appearance, her eyes were brilliant and she looked like a deity.

“Yan Qing.” Emperor Yen raised his eyes when he saw Elder Yan. He chuckled and said, “I heard that you became an empress too. How is your grandfather?”

“My grandfather died while fighting the rebelling dragons in the ocean. He’s gone but his soul will live forever; he’s not as despicable as you!” roared Elder Yan.

Emperor Yen said casually, “Fairness is not important when you’re dealing with your enemies. Invaders are enemies. Not even the lowly ants and worms check their numbers before they fight to have even matches. Fighting with many against one is a way to protect our own people. Eliminating the enemy with minimum casualties is justice!”

Elder Yan knew that talking would be pointless. She said, “I’ve heard so much about you, Emperor Yen. Let’s see if you’re as strong as you’re said to be!”

Emperor Yen’s eyes turned cold and he said indifferently, “On your knees.”

His words were like a royal decree. A terrifying force was instantly imposed upon Elder Yan. Her body was softened and her knees were bent. She almost fell.

“Break!”

Elder Yan was shocked. She unleashed golden power to support her body. She glared at the man. “Emperor Yen, you’re good. However, I kneel to no one in this world, except my parents. Not even the Ancestral Gods can make me bend my knees!”

Emperor Yen repeated with indifference, “On your knees!”

His words seemed to be magical. Elder Yan was trembling and her legs gradually flexed some more.

She gritted her teeth. A universe appeared behind her back, providing infinite power that supported her knees and her body.

“On your knees!”

“On your knees!”

“On your knees!!”

Emperor Yen coldly yelled out orders with heavier and heavier tones.

His every order made Elder Yan’s body tremble violently. She was already trying her best just to resist those commands.

The four emperors at the center were shocked and their wariness for their own fellow elder grew, although they were somewhat proud too. They had heard that Elder Yan was one of the top elders in the Heaven Path Institute, having made astonishing achievements. Such a display made them realize how worthless they were in front of Emperor Yen!

Su Ping saw Elder Yan as she struggled to persist; her body bending and her grimacing face. He felt that his heart was burning. That was his own affair; he didn’t want to implicate anyone. He went there for revenge, and he could make his escape on his own at any moment.

Still, those people didn’t know that. They had gone there to help him, even risking their lives!

“Elder Yan, I don’t deserve your kindness!” Su Ping took a deep breath. His eyes revealed his chaos power, pupils and whites gone. There were only stars in his eyes.

His body changed too and expanded significantly; a profound and ancient aura of chaos was manifested.

Su Ping finally revealed his original form, the body of the Primitive Chaos Clan after the blood fusion!

That body contained the 108 Original Dao Patterns.

Given his current level, cracking Dao Patterns was a breeze. After being able to peer into the Original Dao World, unlocking Dao Patterns was as simple as eating or drinking.

“I only came here only to test the power of my Dao Heart, but if you want a fight, a fight you will get!”
