Chapter 522 Shatter the Heavens!

“Stop!”

A legendary battle pet warrior at the Void State stood up. He pushed the air across the distance to hinder Su Ping and save the old man.

Boom~~

The surging air crushed Su Ping like a falling mountain, but that overwhelming surge of air was soon disrupted by the force surrounding Su Ping. He threw a punch at the old man with his bone-covered hand, which was as glaring as the sun.

The old man stared with eyes wide open; there was nothing left in the world for him to see.

Nothing except for the approaching golden fist!

The punch had yet to land on him, but the wind that had been stirred up was enough to blow away his soul!

No, no way!

The old man shuddered in fear. He was no longer that agitated man; only a scared man remained. He couldn’t even begin to imagine how such strength could be wielded by a puny human being who wasn’t even at the legendary rank.

Defense!

In that critical moment, the only thing he could think of was to save his life.

He instantly set up many defensive barriers and armors. The most noticeable of them all was a virtual image of a golden toad. It was a legendary skill that could not only withstand physical attacks, but also energy attacks and poisons.

That was the skill which allowed him to have his way even during fierce battles.

Su Ping’s hand bumped into the virtual toad. The toad’s head caved in all of a sudden, before it reached its limit and then exploded.

Boom!!

Su Ping’s hand was still pressing forward. The many other barriers and armors behind the virtual toad gave in and cracked, one by one. Some strange barriers came out when his hand was about to land on the old man’s chest, and then more virtual figures appeared to protect the old man from the strike. And yet, the virtual figures lasted for less than 0.1 seconds before they broke and Su Ping cleanly landed a punch on the old man’s chest.

The old man arched his back. His eyes popped out, making the fear and surprise in his eyes even more prominent.

I couldn’t stop the punch even after using all of my defensive skills?!

He had brought out all the armors and barriers he had collected over the years. Any one of them was sturdy enough to fend the strike from a Void State being!

Bang!!

Like a balloon, the legendary-ranked old man burst open, turning into a mist of blood in the air.

The wind blew the mist away as soon as the blood mist came into being. Only scattered objects remained. Some with better sight could already see that those things were the old man’s fingers, teeth, knees, and other body parts.

That old man was punched to death even while being fully prepared!

The legendary battle pet warriors who had at first viewed Su Ping with contempt were frightened at the moment; appalled, even. Were we wrong about Su Ping or are we just having a nightmare?

Could this guy be, in fact, a legendary battle pet warrior?

Legend North King was the most startled of all. He had met Su Ping at the Supremacy League where the latter had already demonstrated his ability to defeat legendary battle pet warriors. But he didn’t think much of it because that old man of the Qing Family was a loser who merely had one beast king. He wasn’t nearly as good as the old man who had just passed away. It was also important to consider that Su Ping’s fight at the Supremacy League had not been as easy as at that time!

One punch!

That day, with one punch, Su Ping had finished that old legendary battle pet warrior!

Legend North King was able to tell that Su Ping’s punch was even more threatening than before.

This young man has grown up too fast, too fast!

“Ah!” A titled battle pet warrior screamed because a broken hand had fallen into his arms.

Some teeth still tainted with blood fell onto the heads of another one, scaring the wits out of him.

When the old legendary battle pet warrior died, the pet he had merged with died as well. As such, the pet’s body parts came down along with the rain of remains.

The two beast kings that the Dark Dragon Hound had been battling against came to a brief stop as the contract broke.

Taking that chance, the Dark Dragon Hound snapped the neck of one of the beast kings and then pounced onto the other one, finishing the latter quickly. Soon, the two beast kings were lying in a pool of blood.

The pungent smell of blood pervaded the air.

No one said anything. The legendary battle pet warriors eyed Su Ping with astonishment. They had just been angry when Su Ping killed Legend Abyssal Ocean without warning.

Angry because Su Ping had dared to harm a legendary battle pet warrior.

But at the moment, anger had given way to panic.

In a face-to-face battle, Su Ping had still been able to kill a legendary battle pet warrior within one move, and they didn’t have to check to know that Su Ping had merged with his pet.

Is Su Ping not at the legendary rank!

Of course, he is!

However, the young man must have used some secret ways to fool their perception and hide his strength. That was the only plausible explanation because their perception told him that Su Ping was at the seventh rank according to their perception. It was ridiculous!

Xie Jinshui and Qin Duhuang stared at Su Ping in disbelief.

They both knew that he had defeated the Otherworld Heavenly King, but they weren’t there to see with their own eyes. They didn’t know that Su Ping’s strength had developed to such a state!

This was how Su Ping was able to defeat the Otherworld Heavenly King!

The silence lasted for half a minute this time. A young looking man stood up, with a gloomy expression. He was the one who had tried to stop Su Ping just then.

However, his attempt had failed. Given how fast Su Ping had killed the old man, the young man was convinced that Su Ping was at the Void State!

“Who are you really? You must have been at the legendary rank for quite some time. It wouldn’t have taken long for us to find out. Are you really from the Blue Planet?” the young man asked, with a wary look.

His words reminded the other legendary battle pet warriors.

Indeed.

They had never heard about this person.

It would be hard for him to stay unnoticed for long after reaching the legendary rank.

Some of them were hiding, like the old man of the Qing Family. Still, this would involve keeping activities to a minimum, including cultivation.

As a result, people like the old man from the Qing Family would have weak powers, even at the legendary rank. They would only be able to defeat those at the titled rank, and not their peers who cultivated normally.

But Su Ping was not like that old man of the Qing Family. They had not heard about him, but he had managed to stun them all.

It would be understandable if he were from another place.

That “other place” would mean the Interstellar Federation.

The legendary rank battle pet warriors seemed fearful upon thinking about this possibility. Legendary battle pet warriors weren’t valued in the Interstellar Federation. If Su Ping originated from there, he surely had some strong connections that they couldn’t mess with.

That being said, the Blue Planet also fell into the Interstellar Federation’s jurisdiction, since it was also its point of origin. They could report the wrongdoing to the Interstellar Federation and ask them to send someone to discipline him.

“Who told you that I was at the legendary rank?”

Su Ping glared at the young man. “As for the other question, you don’t deserve to know the answer! The wild beasts are running loose out there and you’re still in the mood to amuse yourselves here, instead of going to hunt them down to clean up the barren area. You ignored the pleas to save the lives of tens of millions!

“Since the Tower is not set up to protect the vulnerable, you will no longer receive money and respect from the vulnerable!” Su Ping turned to Xie Jinshui, “Mayor, I will be the one protecting the Longjiang Base City from now on! Do not waste your money on these cowards!”

“You!”

Some legendary battle pet warriors’ faces turned crimson with anger.

However, Su Ping had killed two of them in a row; both had been done with a single move. Some of the Ocean State Warriors didn’t even dare to argue, although they were livid with rage.

Some of those at the Void State were flushed with agitation.

Su Ping’s statement had cast a glint of doubt in them. It was evident that Su Ping was from the Blue Planet and he loved his base city dearly, which was why he went to the Tower to create a scene, all for the sake of that base city. His actions wouldn’t have been worthwhile if he weren’t from the Blue Planet.

“Are you saying that you’re not at the legendary rank?” the young one asked again, “Are you trying to say that you’re a noble one at the Star Rank?”

The other legendary battle pet warrior’s pupils contracted wildly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Such an existence was not among them but the name alone carried an overwhelming power.

A noble at the Star Rank! The Star Rank was a step higher than the legendary rank, an incredible tier!

Those who were at the Star Rank would be esteemed even in the Interstellar Federation!

If that were the case, then killing a beast like the Otherworld Heavenly King would be a piece of cake.

“None of your business.” Su Ping glared at him. He never did anything to conceal his strength. All those people could sense it; they just wouldn’t believe it.

Su Ping’s contempt irked the young man. Furiously, he cried, “Don’t you know that the Tower is heaven for the Blue Planet? You killed two legendary battle pet warriors today. I suggest you improve your attitude or you’ll find death soon enough!”

“Death?”

Su Ping sneered. “By whom? You? If this is the heaven of the Blue Planet, then I will shatter the heaven today!”

“Outrageous!”

“You cannot challenge the entire Tower even if you were at the Void State!”

The legendary battle pet warriors were boiling with anger. Su Ping’s remarks were like slaps right on their faces.

Su Ping wore a sarcastic grin; he felt sorry for them.

He could tell that—while all those legendary battle pet warriors were accusing him and shouting madly-none of them were willing to step up. They were all waiting for others to take the lead.

Not only could the general public act cowardly. The powerful ones could be cowards as well.

Cowards!

Su Ping’s disappointment was just as strong as his anger. Legendary battle pet warriors were supposed to be the rare talents, but they turned out to be spineless people clinging to life instead of challenging death. Was this how mankind’s most powerful should be?

“I’m not interested in challenging you... and you’re not worth my while,” Su Ping mumbled. He had lost interest.

He gazed at Legend Pluto. “I’m here to ask for the herb. I heard you had the Soul Nurturer and I want that. Name your price. You can sell it to me or you can give it to me for free. Your choice.”

Legend Pluto was also at the Void State and he hailed from the Nordic region. He, too, was hopping mad because of Su Ping’s attitude. Even so, he was aware that this person was not to be underestimated. He had seen how Su Ping stopped the young legendary battle pet warrior.

As far as Legend Pluto could tell, Su Ping was also at the Void State and he wasn’t sure if he could defeat the latter.

“You want my Soul Nurturer?”

The sudden change of subject took Legend Pluto off guard. He also sensed that the other legendary battle pet warriors were turning their focus to him. “I do have it. But, I’m not going to sell it to you, nor would I give it to you for free. Your demise is already determined. Do you honestly think you can leave the Tower after committing murder? How hilarious.”

“What?”

The fading killing intent rose again. “Have you thought it through?” He glared at Legend Pluto.

“What? Do you want to fight me?” Legend Pluto raised his eyebrows. He wasn’t sure if he could crush Su Ping, but he wasn’t afraid of him. Besides, his peers were there. Once he injured Su Ping, the others would spring up and join in. “Since you are not giving it to me... then you don’t need to stay alive!”

Su Ping enunciated each word. The still Force Field suddenly began to spin and a glint of violence rose from his eyes. Boom!

A stream of energy burst out from Su Ping, creating a turbulence.

In the next second, Su Ping strode toward Legend Pluto who was still seated.

Legend Pluto was taken aback by Su Ping’s sudden move.

Frightened by his resolve, Legend Pluto didn’t hesitate to summon his battle pet. Nine swirls opened up at the same time; nine beast kings emerged. Three of the beast kings had already reached the Void State!

There was a beast king that looked like a mass of tumbling black fog, without a tangible body. The beast king murmured and then seeped into Legend Pluto, “Master...” Soon, two beams of darkness oozed out from Legend Pluto’s eyes. There was something wickedly strange about him and his skin became so pale that he looked like a dead man. Behind him was his Force Field which displayed an ocean of blood; many corpses floated in the ocean of blood, which produced a horrifying view. “Space of Slaughter!” Legend Pluto shouted. His voice sounded different; it seemed that there was another voice layered behind his voice. Darkness had swallowed all the light around them, seemingly about to eat Su Ping up.

“I will show you the authentic world of the dead!”

Legend Pluto wore a cold look. The ocean of blood was tumbling, emitting a foul smell that began to spread across the dark area.
