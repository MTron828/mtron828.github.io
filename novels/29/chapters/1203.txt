Chapter 1204: Killing a Heavenly Lord

“This is impossible!” exclaimed the giant on the other side of the bloody chain exclaimed. An old Ascendant riding the giant’s chest area—who was almost as good as a Heavenly Lord—looked at Su Ping with shock written all over his face.

“How can he possibly have so much soul power? It’s impossible. A Star Lord! He’s merely a Star Lord!”

Not just him, the other Ascendants were quite taken aback too.

Not only does he flaunt a top Ascendant State body, he also carries the soul power of a Heavenly Lord?!

The energy inside his body had yet to completely transform into Ascendant State power, but Su Ping was almost an Ascendant at the moment!

“Sh*t!!”

The ones manning the giant that used full force to slay Su Ping were the most embarrassed and infuriated. They raised the saber, but Su Ping had clearly broken free from the soul chain.

How could they possibly hit the target right then?

“Die!”

Once free, Su Ping simply charged at the giant that jumped out of nowhere with an ambush attack of his own.

His Golden Crow shape was no longer brilliant; it was filled with the aura of death, and looked like a rotten corpse. He approached the enemy in the blink of an eye.

The enemy realized what Su Ping was up to. The giant quickly swung bloody chains, unleashing a fiery Ascendant aura. Many Ascendant worlds appeared and moved towards Su Ping.

Bang!

Su Ping waved his claws and easily ripped the bloody chains apart. Once transformed into a soul entity—even though his physical strength was weakened—he could hurt the enemy’s soul with his own soul power. That was a significant feat.

The bloody chains failed to stop Su Ping. The Ascendant State worlds then descended and enshrouded him.

Su Ping instantly felt restraints all over his body; many powerful laws pierced his body, trying to suppress and rip him to pieces.

“Break!”

Su Ping was dragged down, as if he were negotiating a swamp. He suddenly trembled, then many small worlds appeared around him. Even though they weren’t as powerful as Ascendant worlds, they overlapped like lotus flowers. In the blink of an eye—his third, fourth and fifth small worlds showed up!

The five small worlds resonated together and stacked like lotus flowers, immediately repelling the Ascendant worlds.

Even though the giant had concentrated the power of nine Ascendants—and could release any of the nine Ascendant worlds—it couldn’t unify their power; bundling them together was the only option, and their pressure would be the same. Su Ping’s overlapping small worlds, on the other hand, had a multiplying effect; they could compare to Ascendant worlds in terms of bursting power!

The brilliant five small worlds amazed all the people on the battlefield.

The Ascendants who showed up as reinforcements were shocked at the sight.

That’s the little Star Lord’s unique secret technique: multiple small worlds!

Most unbelievably of all, he had cultivated five small worlds!

Such power made a lot of Ascendants feel jealous. Su Ping didn’t have any shortcomings at the moment. He was more than able to fight against Ascendants one on one!

“This brat…” Elsewhere—Liu Xia also noticed the change while she controlled another giant. The Ascendants of the Red Fire Star Zone in her formation were all shocked. To think that such a genius had emerged in the Golden Star Zone.?No wonder he’s wanted by a Celestial!

“Those chased by Celestials in history were mostly Heavenly Lords. He’s the first Star Lord to achieve this, and rightly so!”

“Is that the effect of having multiple small worlds? I can’t believe it. There’s truly a way for a Star Lord to challenge an Ascendant!”

“The universe is truly a boundless place. We were simply too ignorant!”

They didn’t forget to accelerate and gather around Su Ping as they discussed with mixed emotions.

Su Ping no longer felt restrained after pushing the Ascendant worlds away with his five small worlds. He then approached the giant, letting out soul-piercing shrieks and waving his claws, riddling the giant with wounds.

The Ascendant cultivator located on its shoulder was exposed; Su Ping’s sharp claw moved toward him before he could recover.

“No!”

The man was terrified, feeling cold as he gazed at the sharp claw approaching, which was Su Ping’s sword underneath.

His pupils dilated, overwhelmed by fear; he never thought he would ever experience the fear of death because of a mere Star Lord’s attack!

He quickly released his Ascendant power, then used two secret techniques that would take a toll on his body later, all for a quick increase in combat ability. Still, everything happened all too fast. Su Ping’s sharp claw had ripped him apart before he could move, making him look like a golden flower in bloom!

The torn up body was swallowed and minced inside a vortex.

All those witnessing the fight were even more shocked.

A single attack killed the opponent!

Even though Su Ping had shown comparable strength when fighting the giant, the realization wasn’t as straightforward as that victory.

A Star Lord had instantly killed an Ascendant State cultivator!

“This is unbelievable! Our junior brother is really tough!”

“Damn! I finally understand why our master likes our junior brother so much.”

“He’s tremendously strong. Hurry up, First senior brother! Let’s go there!”

Song Yuan was shocked too. He was spurred into action by the urging voices, dashing over without caring about the consequences. He had seen countless geniuses since he was Shen Huang’s first disciple, but none of them was like Su Ping!

He’ll definitely become the champion of the universe when he reaches the Celestial State. He might even be able to unify the whole universe, and make the saints on the Original Planet lower their heads…?The idea occurred to Song Yuan, but he soon suppressed it and focused on fighting the giants.

Su Ping became even more brutal after killing that Ascendant, relentlessly attacking the weakened giant, causing critical damage with every move.

The giant had been formed by nine Ascendants anyway; none of them was a Heavenly Lord. The controller was barely as strong as one, and thus, the giant only had average Heavenly Lord might. It was soon heavily wounded under Su Ping’s crazy attacks.

Bang!

Su Ping tore the giant’s other arm, then forced the Ascendant found there to come out. He then bit him apart.

“Go to hell!”

A sharp and terrifying aura came from the rear. It was the giant that had made the strong attack to slay Su Ping before; it charged at Su Ping with saber in hand.

Su Ping didn’t reply. He dodged the attack, then kept on attacking the ambushing giant, soon tearing off its two legs and executing the Ascendants inside!

Everyone was flabbergasted to see how easily he was fighting against two giants. They finally realized that normal Ascendants were no match for him!

This Star Lord is still far from reaching the Ascendant State, but he’s strong enough!

He’s almost as strong as an upper Heavenly Lord!

“Mr. Su, we’re here to help!”

Along with the roars, several military formations were moving closer. Behind them was a beautiful and magnificent giantess. She was Goddess Galan, the founding mother of the Loulan family.

The military formation, which recreated their founder’s image, was of the utmost sacred condition. She unleashed a terrifying wave of destruction that easily pierced the void.

The formation led by the master of the Loulan family moved to offer aid; the other Ascendants of the family were also approaching while manning smaller formations.

All of them saw how strong Su Ping was; they felt thrilled and shocked, not expecting their family to have won such a jackpot. Investing in Su Ping had been the best decision the family had ever made in the past 30,000 years!

“He…”

Inside a formation—Jian Lan wore a conflicted expression. Su Ping’s performance exceeded everyone’s expectations; even Heavenly Lords like her were shocked. She knew that Su Ping had a chance of rising to the Celestial State and shine in the universe, but she had just realized that he was already strong enough to dazzle them all.

Jian Lan heaved a sigh when the thought of her granddaughter came to mind. She remembered what she had told her descendant; however, it was an extremely arduous task to even catch up with the shadow of such a man.

Jian Lan felt conflicted as she remembered the things that happened to her when she was young. She didn’t expect her granddaughter to repeat her life; the only difference was that her loved one had died before she was strong enough to rescue him.

The greatest distance between two humans is the gap in strength.

Bang!

The people of the Heavenly Devil Alliance too realized what a genius Su Ping was as they gathered and swarmed closer. They knew fully well that such a threat had to be exterminated!

Even though Su Ping was hardly a weak toddler, it would be impossible to kill him in the future if they didn’t act right then!

A lot of giants quickly charged at Su Ping; it was quite a splendid scene. Su Ping’s reinforcements chased them, and the giants were in the lead, hoping to kill Su Ping before the reinforcements arrived!

“Junior brother!” Fang Shiliu roared and charged as he tried to offer assistance. However, he was held back by the giant led by Dark Fire King. His battle pets were heavily wounded too. Even though Dark Fire King was the only one fighting him, he could only struggle to ensure his safety; after all, the guy was an actual Heavenly Lord enhanced by a formation. He would be able to break free if he were as strong as his eldest brother.

Su Ping glanced at the giants surrounding him; there were a dozen of them. His eyes were cold, since that wasn’t a cultivation site. He could not die there! Not even once!

“Little Skeleton!”

“Little Fatty!”

Su Ping suddenly summoned his battle pets.

Two figures quickly appeared in front of Su Ping. One was like his shadow, extremely tiny. It was the Little Skeleton.

The other was a white-furred chubby creature. It was the young Chaos Beast.

Even though Su Ping had never focused on training the latter, it had a top-graded bloodline and had received training from the Chaos Perception Dragon. It was the strongest among Su Ping’s pets! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Not even the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon could compare, and they had fought countless battles with Su Ping. Its bloodline was truly special!

Roar!!

Hardly had the young Chaos Beast arrived when it sensed the powerful auras surrounding them. Such a stimulation roused the creature, which then expanded, bristling with fury. It began to emanate strange auras, as if some sort of ferocious beast were awakening and revealing its true, scary appearance.

“Stop roaring! Come and merge with me!” Su Ping said quickly.

The Little Skeleton had already merged with him, covering his body with an exoskeleton which made him look like a tyrant from the netherworld.

The young Chaos Beast glared back at Su Ping because of the interruption. However, it wasted no time in merging with Su Ping’s body.

The young Chaos Beast was ferocious and could certainly defeat enemies above its level, but it was only a Star State creature; Su Ping feared it would be surrounded and killed.

A terrifying power radiated from his body after the fusion; it was abundant and ancient.

It was the power of chaos!

Su Ping took a deep breath; it was the first time fighting with such an arrangement.

He had mostly trained his own abilities while in cultivation sites, rarely merging with his pets. The dual merging made him experience an unprecedented power explode inside his body.

“Phew…”

Su Ping exhaled. The world changed before him, as his eyes were transformed into eyes of chaos, which looked like vortices. The universe changed significantly; laws surfaced, and the traces of divine power were visible. In addition, a more unusual power was also manifesting.

Su Ping then saw strange lines interconnecting; they seemed to be the very essence of the universe.

Is this the universe in the Little Fatty’s eyes?

Su Ping looked at the giant, then instantly noticed plenty of those lines; some were extremely feeble, and they were the cores supporting the massive creation.

Are those the flaws of the military formations?

He charged ferociously to test his findings.

Those powering the giant knew that reinforcements would soon arrive, so they went all out, burning vitality and adding the enhancement of Ascendant worlds to charge at Su Ping.

The previously magnificent Ascendant worlds became crude in Su Ping’s eyes. They were made of countless lines, which also revealed lots of vulnerable spots.

Su Ping flew quickly through the openings past the Ascendant worlds. He wasn’t pushed away; he actually went through them. All the Ascendants inside the giant were left in shock!

Su Ping actually passed through our worlds without using his own?

The next moment, Su Ping unleashed the power of his small worlds in full scale. The pressure of the six dazzling small worlds froze the giant for a moment.

Su Ping immediately slashed with his divine sword and burning soul power, cutting the giant apart!

An explosion took place. However, the blast didn’t spread out; it actually collapsed like a black hole, consuming all the Ascendants and crushing them!

Their souls were completely pulverized; revival was impossible.

Many of the warriors operating the giants were rendered speechless upon seeing the astonishing attack.?A single attack killed a Heavenly Lord?

The giants had already reached Su Ping; all of them gazed at the monster covered in bones. They were all frightened, and determined to get rid of that genius!
