Chapter 1554: Everything Can Be Tamed (2)

The little one wasn’t just fighting instinctively like before. There was more rationality.

Its rational mind was telling to run away, right then!

There was no turning back.

Because there was only a mob of billions supporting them.

However, the Little Skeleton didn’t care about that. It only had to ensure Su Ping’s safety!

Just as when the small fellow was about to control Su Ping’s body to retreat, a thought was suddenly relayed. Su Ping’s gentle voice echoed in the Little Skeleton’s head. “You did a good job. Now, let’s do this together!”

The little one was dazed. Even though it was at the moment transformed into protective bones to cover Su Ping, it had the feeling of being embraced by its master.

While fused in a body filled with power, Su Ping’s will was surrounding and protecting it.

“Everyone, are you willing to sacrifice yourselves for me!”

Su Ping’s voice resounded, echoing throughout the three thousand warships.

Inside the vessels, the experts from billions of species and the mythical creatures bonded with him saw Yuan Long’s terrifying appearance once it was angered. The pressure was so overwhelming that they were suffocating, despite the protection offered by the ships.

Su Ping’s body was standing before them, as tiny as a bug compared to Yuan Long!

Even so, he was determined to shake the giant!

All of a sudden, a thought was transmitted with infinite indignity and fury.”Yes!”

“We’re willing to serve you!”

“We’re willing to die for you!!”

Without words, they understood Su Ping’s thoughts and determination through their bond.

Aside from his astonishing combat ability, they had also sensed his sadness. They knew; not only would Su Ping die if they backed off, they would all be killed by the furious Yuan Long.

“We will give you the last bit of our power in our scalding blood!”

“I’m the only one left of my clan, but I will die without regret!!”

“I will make another contribution to the Dao Ancestor with this weak body of mine!!”

“Dao Ancestor, you must win! Ughhhhhhhh!!”

Inside the three thousand warships—the experts of billions of species burned their lives. Their immortality was instantly burnt to the maximum, releasing a power that surpassed the explosion of universes!

When seen from a distance, the massive ships were enshrouded in abundant flames of vitality!

The mythical creatures riding on the warships that hadn’t established a contract were dumbfounded by the behavior of billions of inferior creatures. They actually had the ambition to fight a Sorcerer Ancestor with everything they had!

Many Dao Heart experts burned all their power and vitality, turning into a blazing stream of light. Their bodies were utterly deformed, leaving only spheres with power. Their sentience was quickly extinguished as Su Ping borrowed their power. Only their last wishes lingered!

“You have to win!!” roars were echoing throughout the world.

Su Ping’s eyes were wet, but he didn’t look back. He clenched his fists and absorbed all of their power. His body was almost about to explode. He looked at Yuan Long who was charging furiously, and then dashed forward like a madman.

Roar!!

The Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon, the Little Skeleton and all his other pets charged alongside him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Black lightning tore the world apart. Su Ping’s body reached the ancient dragon in an instant. The moment when their furious and resentful eyes clashed seemed eternal.

Then, both parties unleashed their fiercest and most brutal attacks.

“Ahhhhhhhh!!”

Su Ping swung his sword with reckless abandon. His sword auras contained the power of all the Great Daos.

Yuan Long roared furiously, also attacking in a frenzied state. They clashed, both receiving numerous wounds.

Dense sword marks appeared on Yuan Long’s body, and Su Ping was already covered in blood!

“Go to hell!!”

Su Ping jumped to Yuan Long’s head and sat on top. He brutally stabbed it with his sword. Then, a few arms that looked like sharp claws emerged from both sides of his body; they slashed crazily, ripping scales.

“Hoooooooooooo!”

Yuan Long roared with anger, struggling, yet unable to get rid of Su Ping for the moment.

Su Ping kept on slashing, and the dragon was finally unable to hold back. The Chaos Qualification on its forehead flew towards Su Ping like an illusion.

However, there was a crazy glint on Su Ping’s scary face at the moment. He simply ignored the Chaos Qualification attacking him and condensed a gigantic sword to slash at Yuan Long’s head!

“Have you lost your mind?”

Yuan Long was truly shocked at the moment, sweating, even. That was a feeling he had only experienced when he fought against the Ultimate Heavenly Dao. He couldn’t even feel anger anymore.

Su Ping was actually unafraid of death, and simply wanted to go down with him!

However, there was no time for him to summon the Chaos Qualification.

The sword passed by, severing the enormous dragon head; his chaos blood was sprayed in a million kilometers.

The scene seemed eternal!

The experts in the three thousand warships along with the mythical creatures were too shocked to speak.

Su Ping… actually did it!

He beheaded the enemy!

Even though the strike wasn’t enough to kill Yuan Long, it was already an unbelievable miracle!

Since the dawn of time, the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors had been above all other creatures. The gap in between was simply insurmountable. However, just then, Su Ping had managed to cut Yuan Long’s head with everyone’s help!
