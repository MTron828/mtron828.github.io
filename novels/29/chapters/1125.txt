Chapter 1126 Conspiracy

Su Ping observed the golden gourd; he detected a law-based seal on it, but it wasn’t very powerful. Even he could lift it with ease.

“Tell her to come out then,” Su Ping said to the fat kid.

The latter shook his head and said, “Sister Golden Lotus is imprisoned there; she can’t come out. Wicked restraints have been imposed on her, all to block her power; even I can overpower her right now…” Su Ping glanced at him and said, “And you simply brought me here? Aren’t you afraid that I would eat you both?”

The fat kid glanced at him, with a deeper meaning showing in his eyes.

He obediently confessed, “Sister Golden Lotus is a Unity Essence Golden Lotus Pill; you can’t eat her. No one is able to bear the effects of eating her, except for Deity Kings. Furthermore, Sister Golden Lotus is carrying vicious restraints. You’ll be the one to suffer because of the restraints if you eat her,”

“What’s her effect then?” asked Su Ping curiously.

“She can help you develop your core. I don’t know the details; you’ll have to ask Sister Golden Lotus for the exact answer,” said the fat kid while shaking his head.

Su Ping glanced at the latter, and thought his words were probably true.

Otherwise, the fat kid could have lured him into eating the pill, and end up with a curse.

“Is the bully around?” Su Ping looked around.

The fat kid shook his head. “No. She’s elsewhere; it’s safe here.”

Su Ping didn’t detect anything else either; he immediately destroyed the laws covering the golden gourd. It was possible to incinerate the seal with the perfect path of fire.

The pill boy was shocked yet again upon seeing the perfect path of fire released by Su Ping.

The seal was then lifted; an abundant fragrance began to spread. Both the fat kid and Su Ping seemed intoxicated.

The fragrance was refreshing and pungent; they felt as if floating in clouds.

“Sister Golden Lotus!” the fat kid snapped out of it and shouted; he seemed to be quite enthused.

Su Ping also recovered and gazed forward.

“It’s you? Why are you here? Who’s this?” a pleasant voice came out of the gourd, while concurrently a fair hand appeared and grabbed the container’s edge. Following that, the most elegant and attractive face emerged; she seemed serene and casual.

Su Ping was slightly relieved upon seeing her; it seemed that the fat kid didn’t lie to him. The abundant fragrance wafting from the woman was a clear indicator of her pill nature.

She was a little bit like Green Lady, but her fragrance seemed even more abundant than that of Green Lady’s.

The woman noticed Su Ping. She put on a slightly solemn expression and asked, “Who’s

he?”

She seemed to have realized that it wasn’t the kid, but the stranger who had broken the seal on the gourd.

“He claims to be that old monster’s disciple…” the fat kid quickly offered introductions.

Su Ping quickly followed suit, “Hello, Miss Pan, the name is Su Ping.”

The woman was rather puzzled. “Miss Pan? My surname isn’t Pan; you may call me Golden Lotus.”

“Okay, Miss Pan,” Su Ping nodded and then continued, “I was told you know how to get out of here. Is it true?”

The woman was dazed for a moment, and then wore an odd expression. Is this man an idiot? I just asked him to call me Golden Lotus.

She inwardly shook her head and discarded the matter altogether. Then, she said, “If you’re his disciple, why did you come here? Also, he’s been reborn already; he can’t recruit more disciples. Who are you exactly?”

“I was accepted by my master in a place of heritage; I’ve never seen him in person,” said Su Ping.

The woman stared at Su Ping for a while, then shook her head. “You’re lying. I can see through your heart; it’s pointless to lie in front of me. I’m going to ask you again… Who are

you?”

Su Ping was stunned.

Is the pill this formidable?

The fat kid poked a finger on the glove and said, “I knew that something was wrong about you. Just tell me the truth; we’re not malicious. You must be an unlucky man who fell here, aren’t you? But it’s fairly good that you managed to bypass the sleeping fish and come here. It’s unnecessary to test us; we all want to get out of here.”

The fat kid seemed shrewd and worldly at the moment, as if he had already seen through Su Ping’s disguise.

The latter raised his eyebrows; he then chose not to keep it a secret anymore. He said, “You’re right. I’m a trespasser. I saw the fish earlier, but it didn’t notice me; I simply want to get out of here. I will be in your debt if you can give me a hand!”

The woman gazed at Su Ping for a moment, then slightly shook her head. She said, “You’re not lying; I believe you. I do know a way to get out of here. There’s indeed a channel that leads to the study. We can use it to leave this place. However…”

“There’s a bully guarding the place,” added the fat kid, “This bully has been sleeping for a long time. If we’re careful enough, we’ll be able to slip past her.”

“That’s right.” The woman nodded.

She then glanced at the fat kid and said, “You seem to have told him everything. By the way, were your wounds caused by him?”

The fat kid quickly complained and said, “He forced me to confess everything, and he didn’t believe what I said; he threatened that he would eat me whole. Sister Golden Lotus, you must punish him!”

While he looked at the fat two-faced kid, Su Ping thought that he should have bitten him harder.

The woman gave a slight nod, but didn’t lay blame onto Su Ping. Instead, she comforted the fat kid, “He meant it when he said he would be grateful if he could leave. He couldn’t have truly meant to hurt you; no need to be angry with him.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The fat kid was both stunned and frustrated.

Su Ping was surprised; the woman seemed truly able to see through his heart. He thought for a moment, then gazed at her with plenty of inappropriate thoughts.

“What’s on your mind?” The woman frowned; she felt some sort of insult coming from Su Ping’s eyes.

Su Ping shook his head. “Nothing. I simply thought it must be painful that you’re living in the gourd all the time, Sister Pan.”

“You’re lying!” she immediately replied.

Su Ping’s lips cursed, but he didn’t deny it; he already received the answer he wanted. It seemed that the woman could only tell whether or not he was telling the truth, but not his exact thoughts. After all, she would have burst into a fit of rage had she known what he was really thinking…

“No time to waste. Should we go check the bully?” asked Su Ping.

The woman glanced at him, and gave him a slight nod.

The fat pill boy also said, “All right, let’s get out of here. We won’t have a chance to escape if the old monster is reborn successfully and comes back.”

The woman said, “Since we’re leaving, we’ll bring the other pills with us. We’ve been partners for such a long time; we cannot abandon them.”

The fat kid clapped his hands. “Sister Golden Lotus, you’re right.” Su Ping glanced at the fat kid, who had apparently never thought of rescuing the others. The fat kid definitely deserved to be eaten, considering how he had directly sold her out when threatened by Su Ping.

However, the latter had promised not to hurt them; he wouldn’t do anything, unless they harmed him first.

“If you’re taking your partners away, it shouldn’t be a problem if I take some of the treasures, right?” asked Su Ping

The woman looked at Su Ping, unsurprised. She nodded and said, “You reached this place risking your life; leaving empty handed wouldn’t do. You may take something.”

“Okay.” Su Ping instantly said to the fat kid, “Go fetch your pill partners. Miss Pan, please show me around so I can check the treasures.” “Why are you bossing us around?” shouted the fat kid, who seemed a lot bolder now that his sister was there.

Su Ping glared at him. “Because I can eat you!” The fat kid immediately lost all his fury. He glanced at Sister Golden Lotus while making himself look pitiful, but she appeared to have seen through his plan; she didn’t look back as she simply said, “It’s settled then.”
