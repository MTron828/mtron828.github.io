Chapter 651 Alliance

Su Ping put away his sword and said to Legend Riverside who was still in a trance, “How are things in the battlefront? Are more beasts coming? If not, this beast king must have escaped my detection.” Legend Riverside finally recovered. “Are you... at the Fate State?”

“None of your business.”

That dismissal completely pulled Legend Riverside’s consciousness back to reality. He shook his head to Su Ping’s first question. “We haven’t detected any more wild beats. This beast king’s appearance was completely out of the blue. I don’t know if you... sir, if only this beast king escaped your detection or whether more are coming.” After Su Ping proved able to kill that Void State beast with a single cut, Legend Riverside had begun to consider Su Ping as a legendary battle pet warrior at the Fate State.

He had never seen Su Ping in the Tower, but those who lived in the Tower had secrets. Some of the legendary battle pet warriors who had joined the Tower ages before would never show themselves in public.

He only knew some of the newly affiliated legendary battle pet warriors by their names, not their faces.

Even Legend Riverside had always had the feeling that the Tower was an unfathomable organization.

“I think that was just a fish that escaped from the net,” Su Ping said. He added, “I’m going back, so I will entrust this place to you. I will do some checking on my way back and deal with any new beast kings that I find. Of course, it would be great if I don’t find any.”

Legend Riverside twisted the corner of his mouth. Deal with them?

It was as if killing beast kings were like stomping ants to death.

But, that wasn’t an exaggeration for Su Ping... “I have offended you. Sir, please forgive me...” Legend Riverside lowered his head and apologized. He didn’t consider it shameful to apologize to a Void State Warrior, let alone one who was at the Fate State.

“Get over it. Just keep this place safe.”

Su Ping waved his hand. “You must pay attention to any abnormality. This worldwide wild beast strike is not as simple as you might think. There can be an even bigger strike. If you cannot keep the city safe, keep the people safe. You can even give up the city altogether.”

Legend Riverside didn’t expect that Su Ping would talk that way.

A bigger strike?

Legend Riverside was startled. Su Ping sounded too serious to be joking; it seemed that he was privy to some inside information.

“Sir, are you serious?” Legend Riverside asked.

He would have died along with the demise of the Holy Light Base City if Su Ping hadn’t been there to help.

He no longer doubted that Su Ping had killed twelve beast kings by himself.

The Void State beast king was probably the leader of the twelve beasts and the commander of that strike.

“I guessed it. I’m not sure.” Su Ping shook his head.

He was indeed unsure. He merely thought it was possible.

If he were sure, he would have made the information public and pressed further to relocate the Holy Light Base City.

After all, compared with all the people’s lives in the base city, keeping such information confidential was not the priority.

It was just that he wasn’t sure.

The only relocating destination would be Longjiang Base City. However, Longjiang’s space was limited. How many people could the Longjiang Base City take? Also, apart from the Holy Light Base City, the other base cities were also under attack.

He couldn’t give refuge to everyone in Longjiang. The Holy Light Base City was a Class A base city after all, with a history spanning for hundreds of years. The base city’s defense devices were much more advanced than those of the other base cities!

The people of that base city could still be kept safe. However, the other Class B and Class C base cities would be easily turned upside down by one beast king!

“You guessed it?” Legend Riverside gazed at Su Ping with reserve. He wanted to ask something but eventually kept the question to himself.

Right then, many people approached them; they were the titled battle pet warriors who had been fighting the Six Swirls Conch.

“Nice to meet you, sir!” “Nice to meet you, sir!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

All the titled battle pet warriors bowed to Su Ping. Su Ping was taken aback. “You don’t have to thank me. You also did your part, stalling the beast king, or else the harm would have been greater.”

The titled battle pet warriors seemed to be thrilled and excited.

They believed Su Ping was a legendary battle pet warrior, one who was even more powerful than Legend Riverside!

No beast strikes could unsettle them while having such a legendary battle pet warrior as a guest!

Whoosh!

Another person arrived. It was Lu Qiu. After all, he was a titled battle pet warrior, and he had also seen how Su Ping had slain that beast king with a single cut.

Lu Qiu seemed to be surprised and embarrassed.

He stood in front of Su Ping, but was unsure about proper etiquette in front of Su Ping.

Same as before, Brother Su?

Legend Riverside was unable to finish that beast king but Su Ping then managed to kill it with only one move.

It was unquestionable: Su Ping was at the Void State or above!

Lu Qiu was the Vice Chairman of the Trainers Association and a man of high status. However, the best he could aspire to was to be shown respect by those at the Ocean State. As for Void State Warriors, even those at the Ocean State would have to treat them with respect!

“Mr. Su.”

In the distance, the commander-in-chief made his way over with some titled battle pet warriors. They were clearly excited.

Su Ping was getting a headache from seeing all those joyful faces. “The entire world is in an abyss of suffering. I have to go... Time is pressing. Try to get this place repaired.” The commander-in-chief didn’t even have the time to express his gratitude. He said in a hurry, “Mr. Su, you were the one who killed this beast king. Why don’t you stay so we can host a dinner in your honor?”

Su Ping had already guessed their goodwilled intentions but he declined. “I was only lending a hand. You won’t have trouble for the time being, while I still have to go and take care of my base city.

“There’s nothing worthy of honor and praise. We survived the current strike but there can be more in the future. I suggest you stay on high alert; don’t let your guard down.”

The commander-in-chief opened his mouth but no words came out.

It was surprising to experience Su Ping’s direct and unorthodox personality.

“Sure,” the commander-in-chief said.

He knew that he couldn’t have persuaded a powerful man like Su Ping. Rather, pushing too hard would have only made Su Ping unhappy.

Su Ping nodded. He heaved a sigh and was ready to leave.

“Brother Su,” Lu Qiu stopped him.

He rubbed his hands with embarrassment. “The thing you asked me, does it still count?”

“What?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows.

“About relocating to the Longjiang Base City.”

“Oh? I thought you weren’t going. You said you wanted to be buried here.” “Well...!” Lu Qiu cleared his throat. “I’m staying. I only want to relocate some of the young in my family. I was wondering if you could take them with you.”

Su Ping understood. The man was trying to protect his family’s future.

“Fine. You have twenty minutes. Can you bring them over?” Su Ping asked.

Lu Qiu was overjoyed. “Yes! Of course! I’ll tell them to come right now!”

With that said, he made a call to his butler and said four names. He spoke with the most serious tone he had ever used.

After hanging up the call, he called someone else so that the four young people could get there as soon as possible.

While Lu Qiu did that, the commander-in-chief and the others were surprised by what that arrangement meant.

Soon, they realized something; something that Su Ping said. More beast strikes... They turned pale. Was that not the end of it?

Lu Qiu was trying to leave a way open for the future. Is the Holy Light Base City in danger? The commander-in-chief asked at once, “Mr. Su, could you take two from my family as well?”

Su Ping looked at the commander-in-chief. “Only if they can get here within twenty minutes. If it’s not possible, you can take them directly to the Longjiang Base, but be careful.”

“Of course! Thank you, Mr. Su!”

The commander-in-chief began to make calls as well.

They wanted their young to go with Su Ping because they were worried about potential beast strikes on the way.

Apart from the Holy Light Base City, many other base cities were being attacked. The wilderness was not as peaceful as before; not even titled warriors could ensure their own safety.

“Sir, there are three in my family...”

The titled battle pet warriors joined in.

Su Ping looked at the titled battle pet warriors who had been fighting against the beast king. “You have twenty minutes. I can take them with me if they get here on time. Go and call your families.”

The titled battle pet warriors thanked Su Ping and went to make the calls.

More titled battle pet warriors started to gather their families’ young ones as well.

Moments later, many people arrived while riding on huge birds.

“Lord Lu.”

Two titled battle pet warriors came down from a bird at the peak of the ninth rank with four young people in tow. A pair of them were teenagers, while the other two were in their twenties.

The four looked around curiously. They had seen the collapsed outer wall and the beast king’s corpse when they were in the air. “They’re here,” a titled battle pet warrior said to Lu Qiu. The former found the reigning vibe was kind of strange.

Lu Qiu nodded. He looked at the four and said, “Here they are.”

“Sure.”

Su Ping didn’t make further comments.

“Come here. This is Mr. Su, a legendary battle pet warrior. He will take you to the Longjiang Base City. You must behave... Respect Mr. Su like you respect me!” Lu Qiu said to the four with a serious tone.

The four were surprised, since the young man who seemed to be close to their age was at the legendary rank.

They were well informed, being young members of big families. They knew that some special herbs could keep a person’s appearance; there was also the chance to change a person’s appearance after reaching a certain rank.

“Nice to meet you, Mr. Su,” the four said. Su Ping nodded. “Don’t be so exaggerated. I’m just going to take them there. The Longjiang Base City is not big, but it’s not a small one, either. It can take a few extra people. You should know that I don’t have time to take care of them.”

Lu Qiu said at once, “I understand. You don’t have to; we are already more than grateful that you can take them with you.”

Su Ping nodded.

Soon, the others arrived.

Time was almost up. He looked around; there was about a score of people.

Roar!

A swirl opened up behind him and a scorching heat came from within. The Inferno Dragon stepped out. It looked small when compared to the Six Swirls Conch, but it wasn’t any less intimidating. “That battle pet....” Legend Riverside was surprised by the battle pet.

He was even more afraid of the battle pet than that the Six Swirls Conch!

Still, he was also able to tell that the battle pet was also at the ninth rank, just like Su Ping.

Su Ping told the Inferno Dragon to take it down a notch.

He rode on one of the Inferno Dragon’s shoulders and said to the crowd of young people, “Come on up.”

The young were a bit afraid, but that was a pet, not a wild beast. Soon, a first went up to the Inferno Dragon and the others did the same thing

The Inferno Dragon rolled its eyes. It wasn’t happy to see those people climbing up using its tail as a ramp.

After everyone got up, Su Ping said to Lu Qiu, “I’m leaving now.”

“Take care, Mr. Su.”

“Thank you, Mr. Su.”

The others said.

The Inferno Dragon flapped its wings and let out a roar that echoed in the sky. It took flight.

Su Ping unleashed astral powers over the passengers in case the wind blew them off.

They looked at the Holy Light Base City, saddened by the departure.

Su Ping had seen a few small groups of wild beasts along the way. They no longer posed a big threat. That beast king was a fish that escaped the net.

Su Ping shook his head and directly flew to the Longjiang Base City.

He arrived in half a day.

What he saw along the way made him frown.

He had seen many groups of wild beasts, the largest ranging in the hundreds of thousands. Some groups merely had thousands of beasts. All of them were roaming the wilderness.

Those wild beasts were threatening.

Once he arrived at the outer wall of the Longjiang Base City, he asked the guards for Qin Duhuang’s whereabouts and went to him.

Soon after, he found Qin Duhuang guarding the south.

“Qin, is everything okay?” Su Ping steered the Inferno Dragon to meet with him.

Qin Duhuang was talking to an officer when he heard the voice. He turned and asked, “Who are those people behind you?”

“I went to the Holy Light Base City and brought some people with me.”

“The Holy Light Base City? Did you lend a hand? Just now, Xie heard from Clairvoyance that the Holy Light Base City was enduring a major strike. How was it?” Qin Duhuang asked at once

“The beasts have been taken care of.”

“...Right. You were there. It would have been troublesome if you couldn’t have taken care of it.” Qin Duhuang forced a smile.

He had witnessed how Su Ping had defeated the Otherworld Heavenly King and he had been searching for information in the old archives. Even though Qin Duhuang didn’t join the Tower, he had gained the basic knowledge about the legendary rank.

He had started to treat Su Ping as one at the Fate State.

“The situation is getting worse across the world and many base cities are being attacked. Just now, Xie said that the Tower wants to take the initiative and ask all the base cities, all of them, to form a defense alliance in order to fight the beasts,” Qin Duhuang said.
