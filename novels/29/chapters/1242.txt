Chapter 1243 Unstoppable

“This is impossible!”

The local cultivators and the five saints were all shocked, goosebumps sprouting all over their bodies. The Heavenly Lords among them had instinctively taken action, even before realizing that the golden ring wouldn’t withstand Su Ping’s strike!

They were still too slow, though. The deafening explosion sounded like a billion humming bees. They felt that their souls were ringing.

Then, the most splendid scene occurred: the golden light was dispelled. The small universe seemed to have collapsed.

Without the golden ring’s protection, they once again found themselves in the ancient corpse, back in the same time and space as Su Ping did. Their horror was comparable to having fallen into a cage of ferocious tigers, or a pit of venomous snakes. The five saints quickly recovered and exclaimed in shock, “Don’t just stand there! Stop him!” Their voices were slightly distorted, as the scene was beyond terrifying.

They finally realized why that Star Lord had been left behind. The Saint Heir didn’t ignore him; she was simply unable to teleport him! The others also reacted out of shock and fright, launching Dao Patterns and secret techniques. Their Ascendant worlds glittered as they established a military formation in an attempt to stop Su Ping.

Su Ping charged again with his sword.

There was a boom, and the formation shook with a single attack. The interconnected Ascendant worlds were quaking and falling apart.

“What the hell?”

“How can he possibly be this strong?”

“Is he an Ascendant or a Celestial?”

Nobody could believe what was happening; Su Ping was only a Star Lord in their eyes. Even the five saints were rather suspicious at the moment. Was the intelligence provided unreliable? The briefing was most likely fake if Su Ping had a higher cultivation.

Had Shen Huang already taken precautions against the Planet of Origin?

Su Ping didn’t give them time to think. He attacked relentlessly; the formation shook tremendously with each strike. Everybody who was powering the formation felt as if they were being hammered; each strike made their hearts pound. The world and their bodies felt about to collapse at any moment. It was insufferable.

“Stop!”

One of the saints couldn’t help but yell, “Do you intend to fight us all by yourself?”

“I will if you don’t move out of my way!”

Su Ping stepped forward with sharp eyes; the edge of his sword became sharper. The thirty-eight Dao Patterns were compressed into 26; the number decreased, but their power increased significantly. His arm bulged, combining his physical strength and the power of the Dao Patterns. He then launched a furious slash with his sword.

The formation collapsed with an explosion all of a sudden, and thirty Ascendants from the seven local forces vomited blood. Some were flung back, while others passed out.

“You!”

The five saints were shocked and infuriated, not expecting Su Ping’s crazy actions. However, they realized that the latter wasn’t a Celestial yet, or his attacks would have been even fiercer.

“Stop him! We must not let him disturb the Saint Heir no matter what!”

The five saints took action. Their bodies were covered by a sacred glow; their pale faces becoming even paler at the moment, while their eyes also became pure white. They unleashed their Ascendant worlds, which gradually fused into one world.

Fusion of worlds?

Su Ping was dazed by such development. There was something that hit him and produced an epiphany.

The five saints’ Ascendant worlds fused into one world that produced five illusions and was astonishingly powerful. Their bodies emitted a glowing mist, as if they were also about to melt.

Su Ping was compelled to ask, “Which species do you belong to?”

The saints’ method was uncanny. “You will know after you die,” said the five saints at the same time. Even their voices were somehow synchronized.

The next moment, their glowing bodies melted. The light faded and in their place appeared a ten meter giant with ten arms and eyes.

Its ten eyes stared at Su Ping with indifference and mockery. “You’ve forced us to use the Ultimate Sutra. Whether you are a Star Lord or an Ascendant, you can die without regrets now.”

Su Ping gazed at their Ascendant worlds while turning a deaf, as if pondering about something

“Tenfold Prison, suppress!”

The fused giant suddenly raised a hand and condensed holy light, seeing that Su Ping was ignoring him. The power of a terrifying curse that contained ten Dao Patterns moved towards Su Ping as the Ascendant world pressed down.

Su Ping came out of his reverie; his eyes turned colder as he looked at the enormous hand approaching him. “I’d like to pay a visit to the Planet of Origin if I have a chance. I’ll find out what saints really are!”

The Dao Patterned sword he held seemed to be twisting and reconstructing while he spoke.

A lotus-like small world was also revealed behind his back as this happened. This time though, they were actually eight small worlds!

A hellish aura was spread throughout the battlefield when the World of Mythical Chaos emerged on the top of the lotus flower. The local Ascendants—who had just seen a ray of hope—were now terrified, as if they had just descended into hell. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

An unimaginable primordial aura was released from Su Ping’s body.

“Obliteration!”

Su Ping raised the reconstructed Dao sword. The eight small worlds allowed him to compress twenty-six Dao Patterns into only

six!

That was the power of three Dao Glyphs. Each of the Dao Glyphs had essentially been divided into two Dao Patterns!

Once combined into one Dao Glyph, the glyph’s true power would be unleashed!

Su Ping was very close to attaining the original Dao Glyphs!

His sword was already releasing a destructive aura, even before the attack. The features of the three Dao Glyphs made the local Ascendants see unusual phenomena where fire was burning in the void, seemingly located in deep spaces, about to be ripped apart at any moment.

The incoming curse power collapsed under the sword’s power, including the embedded Dao Patterns. The saints’ five Ascendant worlds also fell apart, just like brittle glass.

They were just piled on top of each other, it wasn’t a true fusion. What a petty trick!”

Observation alone was enough for Su Ping to see that it wasn’t a genuine fusion. Their power was only stacked, meaning that the final world was five times as powerful as each individual world.

However, when only two worlds were truly fused, the power increase would be at least three fold!

When three worlds were fused, the power increase would be at least nine times!

Such a boost was the advantage brought forth by a real fusion. Piling worlds could only produce a limited improvement.

However, all five saints were top Heavenly Lords as strong as Song Yuan. Their combined power was enough to crush any Ascendant cultivator.

However, their power is just mediocre when you take into account the Ascendants from ancient times!

Having traveled in many universes, Su Ping knew that the Ascendants of his universe had yet to reach the true limits of the realm. They were only subpar when considering cultivators of other worlds.

The giant saint’s body and soul cracked as the Ascendant world was shattered. The being wasn’t fully broken, only badly damaged and spacetime laws couldn’t heal it. The giant’s ten eyes widened in shock and disbelief.

He’s not a Celestial. How could he possibly… It baffled them why Su Ping could fight and even heavily wound them with one strike, considering his lower realm. His power was domineering!

He wasn’t harnessing Celestial power!

Furthermore, they even realized that Su Ping’s small worlds didn’t even carry the Ascendant aura. They hadn’t been enhanced by a Divine Mark yet!

Was he strong only because of the multiple small worlds?

“Get lost!”

Su Ping kicked the giant saint to the ground, and trapped it, as it lost all defensive capabilities. He sent the fused giant to the seventh small world, where the Heavenly Tribulations would work as a prison.

The locals snapped into attention and shivered when they saw that all the saints had been defeated and captured. They didn’t even dare to breathe loudly.

Su Ping couldn’t have been more intimidating at the moment. His aura seemed bloodthirsty too, as if he were a devil emerging from an ocean of blood.

None of the local Ascendants confronted him as he approached. They simply flinched.

Su Ping glanced at the group of locals and noticed how they had lost the will to fight. He snorted and grabbed a Heavenly Lord from the crowd. “Lead the way. I’m going to find the Saint Heir!”

The Heavenly Lord was grabbed like a chicken; he was too shocked to resist. Su Ping was like a giant devil that could rip him apart with ease.

He was a strong man and trusted his instincts, so he quickly obeyed, even though he was reluctant in his heart.

It took him less than a second to make that decision.

Su Ping moved forward on Greeny’s head while keeping the merged form, following that Heavenly Lord’s lead.

They soon passed through some strange brain tissues and reached a spacious place.

There were a dozen people with powerful auras in that place; they quickly noticed Su Ping and the Heavenly Lord’s arrival. The former’s presence came as a surprise, being a complete stranger.

Su Ping assessed the overall situation. There were a dozen lakes of liquid chaos; those people were bathing in those lakes and absorbing the power.

At the center of those lakes was a glimmering crack. Using his chaos eyes, he saw a vast realm beyond.

“Who’s he?”

“Isn’t he Su Ping, the genius who’s made a splash as of late?”

“Meng Ke, why did you bring him here? You want to get killed?”

None of the dozen people moved from their positions, merely limiting their efforts to scolding the Heavenly Lord who had guided Su Ping.

The latter blushed, not knowing how to explain. He knew he would die if he complied with Su Ping’s orders, but death would also be the penalty if he did so.

One of the lounding saints stood up and said, “There were noises coming from outside. Did something happen?”

Su Ping noticed that all those people were Heavenly Lords; this didn’t scare him. He said indifferently, “Nothing important. It’s just that the people you sent to block me were outright useless. If I’m not mistaken, your Saint Heir is among you, right? Does that lead to the land of legacy?”

He pointed at the glimmering crack.

The saint asked gloomily, “What do you want?”

“Do you even need to ask? Who doesn’t want the legacy of a universe dominator? And yet, you’re leaving it to your Saint Heir. You are really loyal… dogs.”

Su Ping spoke in disdain with cold eyes. It suddenly occurred to him that the saints were very similar amongst themselves. Their skins were also pasty white, which made them look weird.

“Humph. How arrogant; the Celestial Court has done a poor job raising you!” The saint snorted and then addressed the others, “Take care of him first. He’s not simple; he doesn’t seem to be a pure human being. He actually carries half of the chaos bloodline…”

Everyone shot greedy eyes at Su Ping upon hearing that.

They hadn’t left those lakes for a moment, exactly because they wanted to absorb the power of chaos and improve their bloodlines.

Su Ping, on the other hand, carried an obvious and abundant chaos aura; his body would become a great nourishment if he was killed and eaten.

“You can’t be any more mistaken.”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “Your eyes are truly poor. Indeed, I’m not a pure human, but I don’t carry half the chaos bloodline either. I have the complete chaos bloodline.”

“Die!” the saint roared furiously.

The people in the lakes rose and charged. Su Ping looked around and saw the twelve of them, which were five saints and seven top Heavenly Lords. Judging by attire, they were probably heads of the seven local forces of the Mayhem Star Zone, including the Wolf Fangs.

Su Ping was cold and merciless.

“Rot in hell!”

Su Ping gathered his aura into a sword and slashed out.

“What?!”

The terrifying sword aura was swept out. The three Heavenly Lords leading the charge were instantly drowned; their Ascendant worlds shattered the moment they were unleashed. They were absolutely vulnerable in front of Su Ping’s sword!

The scene appalled the other four, who stopped to look at Su Ping in shock.

They sobered up and realized the seriousness of the matter.

“Boss, run! He’s a monster!” The head of the Wolf Fangs suddenly received Meng Ke’s telepathic message, and was stunned by what he heard.

“I have no time for you! F*ck off!” Su Ping preferred to save time. That Saint Heir was inside the crack, and would probably inherit the complete legacy at any moment. If she did, there was no way he could resist a universe dominator’s power. He had to disrupt the process.

With everything coming to that point, backing off would mean suicide.

“Block him!”

The five saints became furious when they understood what Su Ping wanted to do.

Ivory light emerged from their bodies as they tried to fuse. However, Su Ping was prepared this time; he suddenly dashed towards one of the saints and slashed down.

The saint looked at the giant Su Ping with wide, pale-colored eyes, somehow having forgotten how to dodge.
