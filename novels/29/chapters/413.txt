Chapter 414 Conflict of Bloodlines

“Sir, sir?”

Su Ping was baffled. The look of the dragon king’s soul scared him. Something must have gone wrong.

“Thou hast an ancient bloodline...”

The dragon king’s soul trembled. The majesty in its voice disappeared and fear had overwhelmed it.

The more powerful the creatures were, the greater their fear toward the ancient bloodline would be. The supernatural beings from distant ancient times should have been extinct. How could one of those bloodlines be handed down to reach the current age?

The dragon king’s soul was unable to believe this. The bloodline was weak but that wisp of energy was enough to make it shudder in fear. If it weren’t for the fact that the dragon king’s soul had withdrawn in time, its soul and consciousness would have been swallowed!

Cry!!

While both Su Ping and the dragon king’s soul were standing in a daze, from Su Ping’s internal organs came an almost inaudible cry that seemed to come from another time and age. The cry was instilling fear and dread.

Phew!

Su Ping felt flames were bursting out of him. The golden flames had torched the air. The world constructed by the dragon king’s soul was gradually caving in and breaking up because of the burning.

Behind Su Ping, right in a blind spot, the flames turned into a Golden Crow that was looking down on the dragon king’s soul and everything else. The Golden Crow was a vicious beast from ancient times. A glint of killing intent was visible in the Golden Crow’s eyes.

The dragon king’s soul trembled and its half-melted body was collapsing even further.

All of a sudden, the dragon king’s soul bellowed and dashed to the side.

Whoosh!

The dragon king’s soul wormed its way to the Dark Dragon Hound that was standing close to Su Ping.

The Dark Dragon Hound was crouching by Su Ping’s feet, looking at him fawningly, when the dragon king’s soul pierced into its body. The next second, the Dark Dragon Hound’s eyes turned golden in color and its hair was dancing in the air. The Dark Dragon Hound was bathed in a beam of holy and golden light.

Su Ping was stunned.

What... is going on?!

As the dragon king’s soul entered the Dark Dragon Hound, the water from the golden lake was dragged into the Dark Dragon Hound as well.

In an instant, the huge body of water was gone.

The Dark Dragon Hound was still bathing in the beam of golden light that was shining brightly. Soon, the beam of golden light turned into a golden cocoon. Su Ping could even see some silk threads on the cocoon!

The huge cocoon was dozens of meters long, which looked more like an oval egg.

This was beyond comprehension.

Where was the legacy?

So... the dog got it?!

Su Ping stood staring at the huge golden cocoon for a long time, transfixed.

At the same time, he noticed that his body temperature was dropping quickly and the burning sensation on his back faded away as the shrill and violent cry died down.

Indeed, it was because of the Solar Bulwark...

Su Ping curled his lips. Just then, he could clearly notice the change in his body. Besides, the golden flames covering him were an evident indication that the Solar Bulwark was the reason for the sudden twist.

The Solar Bulwark was a skill which belonged to the Golden Crow race. Since Su Ping had reached the first level, he had managed to generate a wisp of the Golden Crow’s bloodline. But it never occurred to him that the bloodline would react so violently when he was about to receive the legacy. The energy that belonged to the Golden Crows inside him was stimulated and the outburst of energy had freaked out the dragon king’s soul, so much so that the dragon king’s soul darted to where the Dark Dragon Hound was. How ridiculous! Su Ping was having mixed feelings of grief and joy.

While Su Ping was smiling a bitter smile, he suddenly heard the dragon king’s soul speaking to him from the golden cocoon. “Why, why not tell me thou were a descendant of the ancient supernatural beings?” The dragon king’s soul sounded tired and pained.

Su Ping was speechless. How could I tell you when you didn’t ask me?

Besides, I’ve always felt that I am a human being...

“So, sir, did you... pass your legacy to my battle pet?” Su Ping asked, gingerly. He had to confirm.

Hearing this question, the dragon king’s soul suddenly let out a sorrowful scream. That voice penetrated the golden cocoon and was loud enough to shake the world.

The scream was deafening. Su Ping covered his ears at once.

“Because of you...”

After the roar, the dragon king’s soul was speaking in a more lifeless and frustrated tone.

Su Ping interrupted the dragon king’s soul. “Sir, I didn’t mean to harm you. You can take your legacy back if you cannot pass it to me. Why did you have to....”

Those words seemed to anger the dragon king’s soul even more. After two more roars, the dragon king’s soul fell into silence.

The Su Ping called the dragon king’s soul several more times.

Nothing

He wondered if the dragon king’s soul was gone after the legacy was passed on.

When he began to feel bored after waiting for a while, he heard the dragon king again. “Once the bestowal process begins, the world of my origin will start burning. If I hadn’t carried on with the process, the world of origin would have burned until nothing remained. Why else... dost thou think I would choose a dog?”

That explained it.

But it seemed that the dragon king’s soul was insulting his battle pet.

Since the dragon king’s soul was in such misery, Su Ping decided to stop badgering it about this. “Sir, so, what is happening now? You have passed your legacy to my battle pet. Will my battle pet’s power increase suddenly? Does it mean that I might not be able to contro it?”

If the Dark Dragon Hound had reached the ninth-rank because of the legacy, then for Su Ping, despite his strong spirit, controlling the Dark Dragon Hound would be hard. The Dark Dragon Hound could easily get out of control.

Again, the dragon king’s soul answered with silence.

There was no such thing as complete empathy.

The dragon king’s soul wallowed in utter despair but this inheritor was still heartless. He was still thinking about himself.

What he asked was not the point, all right?

The dragon king’s soul had been waiting there for hundreds of thousands of years. It set up the tower just to find a qualified inheritor. However, in the end, everything was conferred to the dog

That was the result of waiting for hundreds of thousands of years?!

Compared to this tragedy, Su Ping’s worry was not worth mentioning! If it weren’t for the fact that the dragon king’s soul was tough-and at the same time, had spent much energy while handing over the legacy-it would have gone ballistic.

The good thing is that there’s still hope...

That was the only thing that the dragon king’s soul felt glad about.

It was always better not to put all the eggs in one basket.

That was its experience after fighting countless fights.

Having received no answer, Su Ping called it, “Sir?”

The dragon king’s soul replied with silence. It was not in the mood to talk.

Su Ping called the dragon king’s soul several more times. Still, no reply. Su Ping heaved a sigh. “Sir, this isn’t fair. I didn’t get this legacy but I still have to keep my promise of sending your soul back to the world of dragons. Don’t you think I’m in a ton of trouble?” Su Ping kept on talking regardless.

The dragon king’s soul: “...”

If it could go back in time to the point when it was about to choose inheritors, the dragon king’s soul swore that it wouldn’t conduct any tests; it would have disregarded everything and simply chosen the other girl directly.

As for this guy...

End him!
