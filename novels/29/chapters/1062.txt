Chapter 1063: Gods’ Pride

I need to train Greeny too when I have the chance. There aren’t any beasts like Greeny in the Federation. They must have been by the Federation…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered as he pondered.

Space around him stopped changing soon after.

The sharp spike unfolded, presenting a new scenery before him. It was a magnificent temple.

“We’ve arrived.”

Heather moved with agility. Space around her dispersed like smoke, revealing their presence as they emerged from the void. The guards present became wary the moment they showed up, but soon bowed respectfully after recognizing Heather.

Heather walked at the front. She led Su Ping, Joanna’s original self and her reincarnation to the temple through the white stairs.

Hardly had Su Ping entered the temple when he detected three indomitable auras deep within. He raised his head, and immediately saw three figures on three thrones hovering in midair.

They were two males and one female, who resembled impeccable art pieces done by nature.

The three Superior Gods had also been gazing back at Su Ping since he set foot in the temple. They saw everything about him, inside and outside.

Still, they did so in a subtle manner; they simply examined him in secret, out of curiosity for the human mentioned by Joanna.

“He’s indeed not simple!”

He’s a mere Celestial God, and yet there’s the power of a small world in his body. There’s also the aura of the four supreme laws…

Maybe Anna was right.

All the three Superior Gods realized how tough Su Ping was. His combat ability was quite terrifying for a Celestial God.

They had seen countless pure-blood godly geniuses, born and raised there, but even they fell short in comparison!

Joanna then made the introductions. “This is Shivalello, this is Eborr, and this is Avril. He is Su Ping, whom I’ve told you so much about. He’s our hope to return to the Archean Divinity. He’s also a friend and an important partner of mine.”

Su Ping was slightly surprised by Joanna’s introduction; he stole a quick look at her, only to find she was staring at the three Superior Gods with solemn eyes.

“I, Su Ping, pay respect to the Superior Gods,” Su Ping greeted them casually.

The three Superior Gods were definitely intrigued; it was quite rare for the usually proud and taciturn Joanna to befriend anyone.

The latter never lowered her head, even in front of the four of them.

Eborr—who was seated on the left side—stared at Su Ping and said, “Young human, I heard that your big shot protector has a way to visit the Archean Divinity. I wonder if you can ask them to help us move to the Archean Divinity. If you do that, we will be eternally in your debt; we will try to give you whatever you want!”

His voice was magnetic; his presence was as charming as the sun, and he was extraordinarily handsome too. His golden and luxurious robe made him look even more awe-inspiring.

Su Ping shook his head and said, “That won’t be easy. We have to ask the experts of the Archean Divinity for help; Anna has surely told you about this in detail. We’re currently studying in the Heaven Path Institute. It should be much easier so seek the support of the Institute’s Ancestral Gods if we impress one of them.”

“Of course, there’s another solution.”

Su Ping continued, “If you’re willing to become my employees, like Anna, and you move all the the realm’s inhabitants into your small world, I’ll be able to directly take all of you to the Archean Divinity.”

All the three Superior Gods frowned; they had learned a thing or two about the so-called employment from Joanna. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After all, Joanna couldn’t have left out Su Ping or his store in order to explain the trip to the Archean Divinity.

“According to Anna, we cannot leave your store without permission if we become your employees; we would basically be imprisoned in your store, right?” asked Avril, frowning. She had the voice and aura of an ice goddess.

“It’s true that my employees cannot leave my store randomly. But I can fire you right after taking you there, if you want to live in the Archean Divinity forever,” said Su Ping.

He wasn’t afraid that the secrets of his store would be exposed.

After all, even the four Superior Gods would remain stranded in the Demigod Burial without his help.

Those Superior Gods were no different from locals of primitive planets in his eyes. They weren’t a threat.

“Wouldn’t that be troublesome?” asked Eborr, frowning. “Can’t you just ask your protector to pull our whole world back to the Archean Divinity? If they can easily teleport you, this shouldn’t be too hard, right?”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “It’s very hard to explain, but it’s impossible to do that. I wish I could let you return to your homeland sooner, but only the two methods I proposed are feasible for the moment.”

Shivalello, seated at the center, was a middle-aged man who looked like a great emperor. He gazed at Su Ping and said, “How can we make sure you will voluntarily cancel the contract after we become your employees? We would be at your mercy if we sign the contracts, according to what Anna has told us. Wouldn’t that be so?”

Su Ping frowned ever so slightly. He suddenly realized why Joanna had stressed that he was her friend and important partner.

She had never said such a thing to him until that very moment. Obviously, although the Superior Gods had agreed to meet him, and they wanted to return to their homeworld through his abilities, there was no trust between the two parties, even with Joanna as an endorser.

“Su Ping won’t go back on his word,” said Joanna.

She stood up and stared at the three Superior Gods on the floating thrones. “Although he may often be playful and even mischievous, he never goes back on his promises! I trust him; I hope you can trust him too. I know it’s a very difficult decision, but we must trust him if we want to return to the Archean Divinity!”

The gods’ expressions changed upon hearing that. Eborr frowned and said, “I know you trust him, but this matter is of critical importance. According to what you said, we would be in the territory of that big senior once we become his employees, and we would lose all control of our lives.”

He glanced at Su Ping and said, “Even though he took you to the Archean Divinity, how can you make sure he didn’t do it for the purpose of winning your trust and ours through you?”

There was a slight change in Joanna’s expression, seemingly infuriated. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“We’re still hoping that the bigshot could directly pull this wasteland back to the Archean Divinity. We will surely thank them accordingly,” said Eborr peacefully.

“You…”

Joanna wanted to continue, but Su Ping straightened his arm to interrupt her.

She was stunned for a moment; she wouldn’t have paid attention to Su Ping’s movements in the past. Still, she couldn’t regard him as a simple, lucky human anymore, not after everything they had gone through in the Archean Divinity.

In particular, after Su Ping had stared at the Ancestral God in the eye despite the enormous pressure, and slew the prince of a renowned clan in public… She further realized that, even though the human had a strong protector, not all of his achievements were caused by luck and their help.

“There’s no need to keep talking.”

Su Ping was completely calm. He didn’t look at Heather, who seemed a bit surprised. Instead, he stared at the three Superior Gods and said calmly, “As I said, you have two options. Firstly, you can become my employees. Secondly, you can wait until we receive the attention of the top experts of the Heaven Path Institute. I’m not asking you to work for me. Also, to be honest, my store is not in need of hands at the moment.”

“Huh?”

The three Superior Gods were stunned for a moment, seeing how calm Su Ping was. They somehow sensed contempt on the human’s calm face.

Their astonishment had some anger mixed in.

“Young human, do you have any idea who you’re talking to?” Eborr, who was as brilliant as the Sun God, had a slight frown while he revealed his aura, which was as scary as a deep abyss. He seemed to be growing infinitely taller, as a lofty mountain that looked down at Su Ping.

“Eborr, what do you mean by this?”

Joanna was incensed by the latter’s actions, seeing that he was no longer concealing his aura. She stepped forward and stood in front of Su Ping—

But Su Ping pulled her arm to stop her; his expression remained impassive before the three Superior Gods, who were stunned for a moment. He was calm while facing the momentum of a man who was as terrifying as a deep abyss; Eborr was indeed like a ferocious beast that would swallow him at any minute.

His aura could chill and terrify any Ascendant.

However, Su Ping wasn’t at all intimidated, having experienced the pressure of the Ancestral God in the Archean Divinity. His eyes remained the same, and were even colder than before.

“I know who I am talking to. The question is, do you?” Su Ping’s voice was calm, but it resounded in the temple like rumbling thunder.

“I’ve come a long way, with kindness and sincerity, for the pursuit of true knowledge.. Is this the treatment you’re offering me?”
