“This feeling...”

The old man changed his expression and shivered; he felt he had become the person whom he used to be when he served the great emperor earlier on; he was as docile as a cat back then.

Any inappropriate thought would be detected the moment it occurred to him.

The emperor was a hundred times more terrifying than Ye Chen.

The old man was feeling as if he were being controlled by the emperor again.

It was impossible for him to break free, no matter how he tried!

“You must abide by the rules of my store.” Su Ping looked at the cauldron woman who was shivering on her knees. She was no longer as arrogant as before; rather, she was trembling like a wounded kid.

The cauldron woman heard Su Ping’s voice, but didn’t find it in her to be enraged; the stare piercing her back stopped her from entertaining any negative thoughts.

“Are you obedient now?”

Su Ping removed the system’s restrictions and squatted in front of the kneeling woman.

She was sweating hard. The pressure had been released, and she felt saved. Still, what Su Ping said filled her with fury again; she instantly lashed out.

They were so close to each other that she was confident of suppressing him before anyone could react.

She could then hold Su Ping hostage and leave that creepy place.

However, the previous pressure was imposed on her back again the moment she raised her hand—this time even more violently, like the foot of a giant god.

There was a loud noise,and the cauldron woman was thrown to the floor, vomiting blood. She felt that her essence was dispersing and her body was being dismembered. She was on the verge of death. Terrified, she quickly said, “I was wrong! I was wrong!”

Su Ping glanced at her indifferently, and asked Joanna, “This is a demonic cauldron. Do you have a good way of taming her?”

Joanna had already expected what would happen to the cauldron woman; after all, she had thought of doing the same in the past. She had given up the thought ever since she saw how troublemakers were suppressed in Su Ping’s store.

“Getting to the bottom of it, the demonic cauldron is just an artifact. We can tame her in the same way we bind artifacts. However, you can hardly subdue a semi artifact with your current power, not to mention a supreme artifact like this one.”

Joanna continued, “However, I have a secret technique called Artifact Dismemberment, which can tear it apart and reshape it into suitable weapons for you. Even though they might not be as powerful, you’ll be able to use them.”

Both the cauldron woman and the old man’s faces showed slight changes. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Are we going to be torn apart?

The cauldron woman couldn’t have felt more regretful. She would have stayed at the bottom of the sea had she seen that coming. The brat turned out to be even more treacherous than Old Monster Ye.

What angered her more was that both she and the demonic sutra had been fooled into going to that place by that brat.

She had underestimated her enemy!

“Brat, wait, young man, I was wrong. We made a deal that we would part ways after escorting you to safety. You cannot do this to me,” she quickly said.

Su Ping replied, “I only cooperated with you because I feared that Senior Dark Demon would try to kill me. However, I have no doubt that you’ll be even more dangerous without him.”

The cauldron woman gnashed her teeth. She would have killed Su Ping at the first chance had she known that would happen.

They had to hide in Su Ping’s small world to escape undetected from the twelve Deity Kings. However, Su Ping took that as a chance to set them up.

“I promise I’ll be a different person after I leave; I won’t hurt anyone else, I swear!” said the cauldron woman quickly.

Su Ping gave her a slight head shake. He was about to say something, but then furrowed his brow. “Someone’s here.”

“Huh?”

Both the cauldron woman and Shen Huang spread their perception, only to find that their senses were still blocked by that strange store; they couldn’t detect anything outside.

The sounds outside the store had been completely shut off after the door was closed.

“Looks like the Celestials tracked us down...” Su Ping could see everything outside. Many Celestials followed the reborn Lin Xiu; they seemed ready to enjoy the drama.

Next to Lin Xiu was a tall Celestial expert wearing a black robe with a golden dragon pattern. He looked as majestic as an emperor. It was none other than Yong Ye.

Su Ping remained peaceful. The secret of his store could be exposed in the battle, but he had no time to care about that anymore; he asked Joanna to open the store.

The old man made a run for it the moment the store was opened

Joanna reacted faster, though, as if she had seen it coming. Golden light burst out of her body as she wielded her spear to push him back.

“Damn it!”

The old man’s expression looked awful; he didn’t expect the god to be as strong as a Deity King. She would even be one of the strongest Deity Kings once she made a breakthrough!

“Behave!”

Su Ping glanced at the old man; he knew that the latter was definitely not as innocent as he claimed. He would rather trust the cauldron woman than trust the old coot, all because he couldn’t see through him. The cauldron woman was evil, but she was frank at least.

The old man knew his opportunity had gone up in smoke as he looked at Joanna blocking the door; anger and brutality flashed across his eyes. He didn’t make another sound, like a shadow in the dark or an insect in the dead of winter.

“Master, take care of Yong Ye, and I’ll deal with Lin Xiu. What do you think?” Su Ping asked Shen Huang.

The latter glanced at Su Ping. He wouldn’t have considered it seriously in the past, but he no longer dared to underestimate his disciple anymore; not after having witnessed the power of the formidable being inside Su Ping’s store.

Although he didn’t confront said power directly, he vaguely detected it was beyond the Celestial State.

Just as I expected. Only the terrifying beings who should have died a long time ago could have raised a disciple able to cultivate a small world in the Fate State and even triple small worlds later on!

Shen Huang heaved a sigh in his heart.

Being Su Ping’s master, he felt deeply frustrated at that moment.

“Be careful,” said Shen Huang in a low voice. He exited the store and stared at both Lin Xiu and Yong Ye. He also glanced at the ferocious beast Lin Xiu was riding, to then fix his eyes upon Yong Ye. “Why have you come to my disciple’s planet?”

The Celestial newcomer sneered. “Do you not know what your disciple has done? A mere Star Lord lied to us. It’s unforgivable!”

“My disciple was held hostage by some evil items. He had to do that in order to survive,” said Shen Huang coldly, “Even if he’s guilty of lying to Celestial experts, he should be punished by the Universe Court. Is it even your place to do anything?”

“Cut the crap and just hand over your disciple. We’ll take him to the Universe Court and be tried, just out of respect for you!” roared Yong Ye.

“That’s preposterous. Do you want a war?” bellowed Shen Huang. His voice made the void quake.

His roar could have shattered an entire planet.

However, the other Celestials that tagged along had isolated time and space from that planet. Even if anyone was outside Su Ping’s store, they couldn’t see nor detect any of the visitors; the place was in an independent time and space.

“If you want war, war you will have! You’re so protective of your disciple; no wonder he made such a horrible mistake. He should be executed!” shouted Yong Ye angrily.

Lin Xiu stared at Su Ping and spoke in a cold voice, “Brat, hand them over and I’ll grant you a quick death!”

Su Ping walked out of the store and looked at the two people in the sky; there were other Celestials and their disciples, but they were only there to observe.

It was clear that the battle would change the balance of the universe.

“It’s Su Ping!”

“He’s out.”

“He does carry a Celestial State aura. No wonder he tricked us.”

The rest of the Celestials fixed their eyes upon the young man, wondering how he would choose.

Would he beg for mercy, and return what he stole from the ruins back to their owner?

Or would he just stubbornly fight back?

What would Shen Huang do?

Su Ping opened his mouth. His voice echoed in the sky. “You’re in the Celestial State. Are you really that stupid?”

All the Celestials were dazed by the answer. Shen Huang was the only one whose eyes glittered; he actually felt relieved.

Su Ping’s solid confidence probably stemmed from his reliance on the expert backing him.

It seemed that he had made the right decision.

“Yong Ye!”

While staring at the flabbergasted Yong Ye, Su Ping called him by his name and said, “Just take a good look. Is the person next to you really your disciple? I’ve already killed Lin Xiu; all the Celestial’s disciples can attest to this. They watched the whole thing!”
