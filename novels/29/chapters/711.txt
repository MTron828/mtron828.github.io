Chapter 714: Subduing the Empress

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“My lord, please give us a spot for my daughter. She just had her sixth birthday...”

A battle pet master flew to a spot several hundred meters away from Su Ping and knelt on the pet’s back. He kowtowed so hard that he was on the verge of breaking his head.

Next to him was a lovely little girl, who was shaking his arm and trying to stop him from kowtowing. Her tears were heartbreaking.

“My lord, please let my wife in. She’s pregnant...”

Some titled warriors moved closer and fell on their knees with bloodshot eyes, before they implored humbly, “I’m willing to be your slave and forever work for you in my next life. Please...”

More and more people were approaching. Some wanted to go into the shelter, while others wanted to send their families in.

Su Ping’s face was covered in the shadow. All the begging around him was too loud to be unheard. Ji Yuanfeng and the others were sitting next to Su Ping; all of them looked horrible.

Given Su Ping’s lack of response, Ji Yuanfeng gritted his teeth and made a decision. He pointed at the man who escorted his pregnant wife and allowed her to go in.

The titled warrior was so thrilled by Ji Yuanfeng’s approval that he quickly kowtowed and said gratefully, “Thank-thank you, my lord. I’ll definitely repay your favor if I have a next life...”

“Go now,” Ji Yuanfeng quickly said and then pointed at some people in the crowd. Those people were mostly women and children. Ji Yuanfeng saw a lot of old people too, but after a moment’s hesitation, he decided to leave hope to the next generation.

The shop was soon crowded again when those people flooded in.

There were a lot more women and children who were pleading to be saved. Although they only took up one third of the population present, their number was still astonishing.

After all, almost ten million people had gathered, and half of the district had been filled up!

Seeing that the begging worked, more and more people kowtowed and did the same, which made Ji Yuanfeng look bad. He knew that there wasn’t enough space to save all of them!

Furthermore, more humans were waiting to be rescued in places that they couldn’t see...

At that moment, all the legendary warriors present were silent.

They had proudly enjoyed people’s awe and respect in the past. And yet, they felt like they were roosters that had just lost a fight at the moment...

While facing that cataclysm, they could only watch their compatriots fall. They wanted to save those people, but they were incapable of saving any. They couldn’t even save themselves without Su Ping’s shelter!

Sad!

The deepest sadness!

Suddenly, a rough yet confident voice came from the safe area in the shop. “Men of the Tang family, come out with me!”

Then, a muscular middle-aged man struggled to squeeze through the crowd. He was Tang Linzhan, the former leader of the Tang family.

Following his command, a lot of men trailed behind him and exited the shop!

Most of them were young, but some were old and others were just teenagers. The youngest didn’t even seem to have hit twenty yet, and the oldest already had white hair.

“Then men of the Tang family can still fight!” roared Tang Linzhan.

His loud voice echoed in the shop and stunned everybody.

Amidst the crowd in the shop, Tang Ruyan fell into a daze as she looked at the back of the man who had just walked out of the shop. Her old memories suddenly flashed back, and she suddenly remembered how the same man had warmly helped her get back to her feet every time she fell when she was little.

However, the man changed the moment she became a substitute. He had always scolded her, asking her to try harder...

Father...

She felt she was on the verge of tears. All her anger and disappointment faded away.

“Huh?”

Hovering in the sky, Qin Duhuang and Zhou Tianlin looked at him in astonishment, not expecting the old leader of the Tang family to be man enough to stay willingly.

Everybody knew that staying outside meant certain death!

“Thank you, Mr. Su, for protecting the female members of the Tang family. This is the least I can do!” said Tang Linzhan loudly to Su Ping while clasping his hands.

Everybody looked at Su Ping, only to discover it was impossible to see his expression.

Su Ping showed no response.

Tang Linzhan took a deep breath. He had walked out, both because he was manly, and because he hoped that, after sacrificing himself, Su Ping would let the female members of the Tang family stay in the shelter.

He had been more or less worried about the friction with Su Ping, which was why he walked out so determinedly.

The Tang family would not go extinct as long as the female members survived!

He had fulfilled his responsibilities as a leader of the family; he deserved the position his father had entrusted to him years back!

While Tang Linzhan was thinking that, he suddenly heard a voice. “The women of the Tang family aren’t weak either!”

The voice was high-pitched. It was a girl’s voice, but it sounded no less assertive than any man’s.

A petite girl rushed out of the crowd filling the shop. It was Tang Ruyu.

Tang Ruyan, who was still inside the shop, was stunned to see that.

Tang Linzhan’s expression had a drastic change. He bellowed, “What are you doing?”

“My sister is now leading the Tang family, so I’m not needed anymore. I’ll stay and accompany you!” said Tang Ruyu to Tang Linzhan with a solemn tone while staring at him. Her eyes seemed to be saying, ‘Father, I know what you’re thinking, so I’m here with you!’

“Nonsense!” snapped Tang Linzhan.

“I’ve made up my mind!” Tang Ruyu stared at him with glittering eyes.

Tang Linzhan was stunned, unable to say anything else.

The legendary warriors in the sky wore troubled expressions. Some seemed to be admiring the Tang family, and some turned around, as if they were too ashamed to look at them.

Exactly at this moment, Qin Duhuang suddenly opened his mouth. “Men of the Qin family, time to come out!”

The Qin family was the nearest to Su Ping’s shop, so a lot of members of the Qin family were there.

A lot of men of different ages strode out after Qin Duhuang said that.

“Hahaha, I already wanted to come out just now!”

“Is the Tang family really afraid of a battle!”

“The worst possible outcome is death, isn’t it? I’ve been waiting for it since I was born!”

“The Qin family won’t be dwarfed by the Tang family!”

More and more men of the Qin family walked out. Some elders put on a smile and said, “I’ve lived long enough anyway!”

After seeing that, Zhou Tianlin gritted his teeth and also roared, “Men of the Zhou family, get out!”

Many members of the Zhou family instantly ran out, as if they were staying not to be killed, but to be awarded. They were full of pride!

Some of the members were hiding in the crowd. Zhou Tianlin saw them and was angry, but he didn’t say anything. After all, some of the young men of the Qin family didn’t come out either. They were obviously the cowards.

Since they were cowards, it would be pointless and humiliating to ask them to come out.

Ten thousand spaces were emptied after the men of the families walked out.

After that took place, Ji Yuanfeng quickly sent the vulnerable groups in. However, the vacancies were soon filled up again.

Su Ping’s shop was like a cup, while the people outside were like an ocean. The cup could easily be filled until it overflowed!

Most people were still without a spot; they could only wait to die in despair.

Seeing that Su Ping had been silent for a long time, Xue Yunzhen called him uneasily, “Boss Su?”

Several seconds later, Su Ping slowly turned his head and looked at her, before he said, “I’m fine.”

Staring at his face for a while, Xue Yunzhen said in a low voice, “Don’t be frustrated. You have tried your best. All of us have. We wouldn’t have saved anyone without you. If you must blame someone, just blame the Lord of the Deep Caves for being too strong...”

Su Ping’s lips twitched slightly, but he didn’t say anything.

Exactly at that moment, the coldest voice suddenly boomed, “You’re all here...”

The air rippled, and the Ocean Sovereign stepped out of the void, with her long legs gleaming as attractively as before. Her appearance lowered the temperature in the neighborhood and formed ice on the ground.

Everybody changed their expressions.

The Ocean Sovereign has come!

She was the toughest Fate State wild beast below the Star State, and she had made her appearance there!

The moment the empress arrived, multiple void doors emerged behind her; the Heavenly King of Good and Evil, the Heavenly King of the Otherworld, Seven Sins, and the other Fate State demon kings walked out. The Fate State wild beasts that were in the other directions had mostly gathered around her. They made the buildings in front of them collapse while releasing a horrifying pressure!

The humans who had gathered at the shop were so terrified that they were all screaming.

The survivors inside the shop were scared, also screaming at the top of their lungs.

The terrible monsters that they had usually seen on TV had arrived right in front of their eyes. Adding to that, the TV could only display their image, whereas the monsters in reality were giving off their full presence. Their horrifying aura was almost reaching for the survivors like claws.

Many of them were suffocating and trembling with fear. Most had even lost control of their bowels and the place was becoming smelly.

Some of them even passed out.

“It’s great that you’ve gathered. This saves me some time...” The Ocean Sovereign looked at everybody; her eyes were briefly fixed on Ji Yuanfeng and Su Ping, then she put on a cold smile.

Ji Yuanfeng, Yuan Tianchen and the others felt their blood was freezing; they were no match for the Ocean Sovereign, at all.

Everybody looked at Su Ping, who might be the only person that could fight the Ocean Sovereign.

But not even Su Ping might be able to defeat her!

“Let’s... evacuate!” said Ji Yuanfeng, gritting his teeth.

They weren’t going to hide in the shop anyway, and a fight would be pointless!

More importantly, they would never win the fight!

Even if Su Ping was able to keep the Ocean Sovereign busy, the other Fate State beasts were still too strong; some of them might die while entangled in a fierce fight!

The Lord of the Deep Caves was also close; it could arrive in the blink of an eye with its Star State abilities!

However, the Lord of the Deep Caves didn’t seem to be interested in annihilating them. Instead, it turned around and went to another base city.

Su Ping took note of its movements, knowing that its aim was to destroy the Heaven Lock.

It was obvious that the Lord of the Deep Caves wanted to swallow the thousand-years worth of astral power inside the Heaven Lock. Or rather, it was trying to force the heavily-wounded Nie Huofeng to show up to kill him!

All in all, the Lord of the Deep Caves wasn’t paying attention to them.

“We can fight them!” said Su Ping thoughtfully after taking a deep breath.

If it were a moment earlier, he would’ve chosen to hide as Ji Yuanfeng suggested, because a fight was absolutely pointless. However, he was greatly touched when the men down below gave away their precious spaces, their sole opportunities of life.

Those who were much weaker than him were completely determined to fight. Could he hide and watch them be slaughtered? No, he couldn’t!

“Don’t overestimate yourself,” said a shocked Ji Yuanfeng after hearing Su Ping.

Su Ping turned around and looked at him gravely. “I’m not overestimating myself. I simply don’t want to regret it later. Even if I must hide or run, I want to do so knowing that I tried my best first!”

Other men were “overestimating themselves” so much that they were basically giving away their lives. Why couldn’t he try his best to save some lives and make his contributions in this battle that could annihilate the human race?

Ji Yuanfeng was dazed after seeing Su Ping’s eyes.

“There’s a way to suppress her!” Su Ping said to Ji Yuanfeng telepathically, while looking at the Ocean Sovereign who was moving closer with an unhurried pace.

He was scared of being overheard by her.

Ji Yuanfeng’s eyes glittered. But soon, he resumed his usual expression and replied telepathically, “What is the method? How can I help?”

Since Su Ping told it to him, he was definitely needed in the plan.

Su Ping said, “When I fight her later, can you teleport her to my shop?”

Ji Yuanfeng was stunned. He asked in confusion, “To your shop?”

“Yes, if she fails to cancel her attack and hits the divine formation in my shop, her attack will be bounced back, that would heavily wound her!” said Su Ping. The divine formation was a lie, but the effect was real. The Ocean Sovereign would trigger the system’s counterattack if she invaded Su Ping’s shop!

In such a case, she would either be wiped out or be suppressed!

The problem was how to make her enter the safe area around the shop.

The remote attacks that struck the shop would only be nullified; they would not trigger any counterattacks. The system could only suppress lives within the range of the shop. So, the Ocean Sovereign had to enter the area and launch an attack!

Otherwise, Su Ping would have easily lure her into launching remote attacks and then dodge, so that she would hit the shop and trigger the system’s counterattack.

“The divine formation can bounce off attacks?”

Ji Yuanfeng was shocked and suspicious. He could believe a divine formation was able to resist Star State attacks, but it was rather unbelievable that it could also reflect attacks!

Wasn’t Su Ping invincible on the Blue Planet if he had such a formation?

“Can you teleport her?” asked Su Ping.

Ji Yuanfeng’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and said, “I can try, but I’ll need other people’s help. I think it’ll work as long as we catch her unprepared.”

Su Ping nodded. “That’ll do.”

Since there was a chance, it was worth a shot!

In fact, he had another way to suppress the Ocean Sovereign, which was the special-grade beast-catching ring he had recently purchased at the cost of eight million energy points.

The special-grade beast-catching ring could capture Fate State wild beasts with a success rate of 80%!

It was almost certain that he could catch her as long as he wasn’t too unlucky!

However... Su Ping had given it some thought; he had to save as many people as possible!

Therefore, he left the special-grade beast-catching ring for another plan and intended to deal with the Lord of the Deep Caves with it. After all, the ring had a 10% chance that it could capture Star State wild beasts!

“Here’s the plan...”

Su Ping quickly told his idea to Ji Yuanfeng via telepathy.

Ji Yuanfeng was slightly surprised by the idea. He quickly nodded and accepted his task.

“Tsk, tsk. Cutie, we meet again.” At this moment, the Otherworld Heavenly King cackled among the many Fate State beasts behind the Ocean Sovereign.

Hearing that, the other Fate State beasts couldn’t help but look at the Heavenly King, wondering why it knew that horrifying human.

Su Ping snorted and ignored it. He simply looked at the Ocean Sovereign coldly and said, “Given your status, you reign over the seas of the Blue Planet and have the most subjects. And yet you bend before the Lord of the Deep Caves, willingly fight for it. You’re pathetic!”

“You are quite talkative for a dying man.”

The Ocean Sovereign’s eyes became cold, and ice blades darted out of the void towards the humans who had come to seek protection. Thousands of them were killed in the blink of an eye!

The other humans fled in panic after seeing that.

Su Ping’s expression changed. He declared with cold eyes, “Don’t think I can’t do anything to you. I can easily suppress you!”

“Can you really? Why don’t you try?” The Ocean Sovereign sneered. “With your shallow understanding of the power of laws? Let’s see which of us is better. Practicing with you is a great way for me to perfect my understanding of laws. You’re a rare opponent indeed; I almost can’t bear to kill you!”

“Get lost!”

Su Ping roared and charged at her with his sword.

The space around him was suddenly twisted. Hundreds of sharp ice blades—all made of laws—surrounded Su Ping at the same time.

Su Ping’s expression changed, all due to the Ocean Sovereign’s deep understanding of laws. It wasn’t perfect, but it was very close!

Her energy was also much more abundant than his!

After all, there was a major level gap between them. That was too wide a difference.

Su Ping gritted his teeth and summoned the Little Skeleton. When the violent energy was attached to him, he waved his sword, which seemed like a black lightning bolt.

After a boom sound, all the surrounding ice blades were annihilated.

In the next moment, Su Ping saw that the environment around the Ocean Sovereign turned into a snow world. The ground, the air, and the space; everything was condensed!

The condensed domain was like an enormous channel of ice that approached Su Ping, who was about to be swallowed by the laws.

Of course, Su Ping would not allow her to do that. He had recovered some of his strength, and he could manage to launch two strikes with his sword.

He felt exhausted after breaking the Ocean Sovereign’s attacks with one strike; he could only launch one last strike!

He had to make her reveal her vulnerability with the strike!

“Ahhhhhhh...” Su Ping roared and punched. All the astral power in his body was burning, and all the star vortices in his cells were revolving like windmills. Violent energy was imbued into his fist, which unleashed a dazzling power.

“Huh?”

The Ocean Sovereign was slightly surprised by Su Ping’s brutal punch, which didn’t involve any power of laws but was almost capable of interfering with her domain.

That was how strength could break all tricks!

“Freeze!” the Ocean Sovereign said softly.

The coldness in the domain was all moved towards the Fist of Exorcist, trying to freeze the scorching fist aura!

Su Ping’s eyes emanated coldness at that exact moment, and his hidden killing intent was unleashed. He dashed and reached the Ocean Sovereign with a weird movement technique.

Die!!

Su Ping roared suddenly.

“Humph!”

The Ocean Sovereign, however, suddenly widened her eyes coldly, as if she were prepared for Su Ping’s surprising attack. Chains of ice appeared in front of her in the next moment, interweaving to form a shield.

The black sword aura cut the shield and vaporized half of it; heat and light from the friction was spreading out.

But the sword aura was worn out all too soon!

Seeing that Su Ping’s energy had run out, the Ocean Sovereign knew he was exhausted; that was the best opportunity. “Rot in hell!”

She instantly rushed forward.

However, the world suddenly flashed before her eyes. Then, Su Ping was gone; he was replaced by faces filled with dread.

“Huh?”

The Ocean Sovereign was quite alarmed. Then, she realized that it wasn’t Su Ping, but her, who had been teleported.

The people in front of her were all humans.

Did they teleport me away so that Su Ping could escape?

Being right in the middle of a battle, the Ocean Sovereign didn’t have time to think. She waved her claws without any mercy, upon sensing that all the humans present were weak, and some were even ordinary folk.

Intense frost was spread out; all the humans were going to be frozen into ice sculptures!

However, the frost disappeared the moment it formed, as if it would have never been invoked in the first place.

The Ocean Sovereign was stunned for a moment. Then, an unprecedented feeling of horror grabbed her heart; the weird thing reminded her of something.

If they wanted to save Su Ping, why didn’t they simply teleport him away? Why did they teleport her?

She detected that the humans present weren’t dangerous, so she never bothered to think much of it. However, the strangeness of the situation made her realize that it was a trap!

Retreat!

She wanted to leave, but something was loudly drumming right inside her head.

The Ocean Sovereign felt like her soul, willpower and energy were all dispersing. Her ears were ringing, and she was hardly herself anymore.

Her power of laws seemed to have been dispersed too, and she couldn’t wield it!

On the other hand, a notification sounded in Su Ping’s head. “It’s been detected that a creature is attempting to sabotage the shop. Would you like to suppress her or kill her?”

“Suppress her!” replied Su Ping instantly.

He looked back and saw that one of the Ocean Sovereign’s legs had stepped into the shop, her hands had entered the shop, and the energy unleashed by her fingers had shrouded the shop. She was almost a textbook saboteur according to the system’s definition!

Boom!!

The moment Su Ping said “suppress her” in his head, the Ocean Sovereign trembled and heavily fell on her knees outside the shop!

The scene silenced and astounded everyone!

The previously domineering empress of the seas was on her knees! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The humans in front of her—all of whom had almost passed out a moment earlier—looked at her as she knelt before them, and felt like they were going crazy.

What is going on?!

Up in the sky, Ji Yuanfeng and the other Legends were all stupefied. The former had learned of Su Pings’ counterattack, but it didn’t quite go as he expected.

It was even more shocking than killing her!

Nearby, the legendary warriors who cooperated with Ji Yuanfeng in this stratagem had been made aware of Su Ping’s plan. They were as surprised as Ji Yuanfeng and didn’t expect the counterattack to be like that.

“Y-Your Majesty...”

The Fate State beast kings’ eyeballs almost popped out when they saw that happen.

The most esteemed emperor is kneeling in front of a bunch of humans?!

“How is this possible?”

The nonchalant attitude had completely disappeared from the empress’s pretty face; her eyes were widened with disbelief.

She sensed that an enormous force she couldn’t resist had been imposed on her body!

The power of laws as well as the energy inside her body were being held back; they couldn’t be released in the slightest!

“Kneel there and reflect on your behavior!” said Su Ping coldly as he flew back to the shop and looked down at the empress, as if he were a god delivering a judgment.

The empress gnashed her teeth. The humiliation almost made her head explode; she was about to go on a rampage.

She summoned all her strength and tried to crane her head. However, what horrified her was that no matter how she invoked her power, the force that suppressed her remained absolutely unaffected!

It was like a mountain on her back. She couldn’t even shake it off!

What the hell is this?

The empress couldn’t help but shriek, which was an ear splitting sonic attack. But her shriek was blocked the moment she uttered a sound.

“Humph!”

A snort seemed to come from nowhere.

The snort was light, with disdain and condescension, as if it came from an emperor who looked down at the planet from the clouds.

Only the empress could hear that voice. All of a sudden, her mind went black, and her heart was overwhelmed with an unprecedented feeling of horror, like none she had ever felt before, not even that of the Lord of the Deep Caves that she had to bend to.

In other people’s eyes, the female creature was stiffened as if hit by a lightning strike. Her eyes lost focus, her pretty face was full of fear, drool was dripping from her lips, and most appallingly of all, fluid was flowing from her thighs.

The empress had wet herself!

The many legendary warriors who saw this were too shocked to talk.

What happened to the empress? It looks like she just saw something horrifying!

Everyone present was unable to fight the urge to look at Su Ping, eager to know why this was happening.

It was quite unbelievable that the empress who had ruled the seas for a thousand years had wet herself because of fear!

Su Ping also noticed that and was a little bit astonished. He didn’t know how the system had dealt with her. Did it project the Chaotic Realm of the Undead he knew, straight into her head?

It would be a natural reaction if that were so; she had probably been paralyzed with fear by the sceneries of that world!

Roar! Roar!

Roar!!

“Unhand Her Majesty!”

The Fate State beasts were exasperated. They couldn’t stand to see the empress’s wet dress, and they had also seen her on her knees, which was already insufferable. It was even more humiliating than them kneeling!

Humiliation could only be washed away by blood!

All the Fate State sea beasts rumbled close. The humans who had gone to Su Ping’s shop were so scared that everyone ran to the back of the shelter. There was no room for them inside the shelter, so they could only get as close to it as possible.

Ji Yuanfeng and the others stepped out upon hearing the demon kings’ roars.

“Your emperor has already surrendered. Do you still want to resist?” roared Ji Yuanfeng.

“Bulls*it!”

The Fate State sea beasts were seething with anger. How could their emperor surrender?

Su Ping was rather pale. He was already extremely weak after performing the two strikes.

He quickly absorbed the surrounding astral power and recovered his physical strength. He canceled the fusion with the Little Skeleton in the meantime, and then asked it to help.

He didn’t summon the Inferno Dragon, its combat ability hadn’t truly reached the Fate State yet, even though it had swallowed the Purple Dragon Crystal. It might accidentally be killed in a Fate State chaotic battle in the .

“If you don’t surrender, I’ll kill her!”

Su Ping landed and laid his sword on the nape of the empress who was still on her knees, before he declared to the Fate State sea beasts.

Even though he looked enfeebled, his previous performances had left a deep impression on the beast kings. Besides, Su Ping had laid a sword on the empress’ nape, yet she didn’t put up any resistance... As a result, all the beast kings had to stop even though they were angry and frustrated.

Ji Yuanfeng and the others—who were gritting their teeth as they prepared to fight them—were all relieved.

They would surely lose the fight. After all, there were a dozen Fate State enemies, and only Ji Yuanfeng and the Deputy Chief were in the Fate State on the human side.

As for Gu Siping... he was still nowhere to be seen, and had probably already died.

Ji Yuanfeng had already noticed that Gu Siping had been caught by the Lord of the Deep Caves during the escape; he was clearly hopeless.

On the other side, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil gave an order, “Humph, if they’re not going, we are!” It considered this as a chance for revenge.

The Otherworld Heavenly King and Seven Sins were both eager to try. The other beast kings from the Deep Caves also roared brutally and stepped out, ready to attack.

Su Ping said coldly upon seeing the alert, “Stop them if you don’t want your emperor to die!”

He was addressing the Fate State beast kings of the seas.

All the Fate State beast kings changed their expressions.

The Fate State beast kings of the seas were so angry that their eyes were almost flaming.

The demon kings of the Deep Caves, on the other hand, looked at them warily, fearing that they might really change sides!

Noticing the impasse, Su Ping quickly roared, “Get the hell out of here! You are just useless chickens without the Ocean Sovereign. Do you want me to kill you one by one?”

The humans who had gone there to seek protection in the shop were all shocked by his roar. He speaks so confidently in front of so many horrifying monsters. Is he a god?

The Fate State beast kings had a change in their expressions. They were shocked and angry.

All of them could tell that Su Ping was not nearly as strong as before, but they clearly remembered his performance.

Su Ping was indeed capable of killing them, and none of them knew how much strength Su Ping had left.

A Fate State beast king would prefer not challenging Su Ping, who was holding the empress hostage at the moment, so it made a suggestion, “Hurry up, go and inform the Lord of the Deep Caves.”

The other Fate State beast kings realized that they didn’t need to waste their time on Su Ping either, and could simply leave him to the Lord of the Deep Caves.

“Let’s go and conquer the other places first.”

“Stomp on them and enjoy!”

Very soon, the bloodthirsty beast kings of the Deep Caves chose to play in other places and leave the food in that place for the future!

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil looked awful. It looked back at Su Ping, seeing that all the other Fate State beast kings had retreated, only to find that he was also staring at itself. It changed its expression and remembered Su Ping’s sword.

“Let’s go.”

It didn’t dare to stay any longer since all its allies had retreated.

Phew!

Everybody was relieved to see Su Ping force the Fate State beast kings to retreat with a few words.

All of them looked at Su Ping with admiration and respect.

Su Ping noticed their eyes, but his heart was bitter; he didn’t feel proud and neither did he feel satisfied. If the Lord of the Deep Caves couldn’t be taken care of, what was the point of that momentary lapse of peace?

“Do you have the contact information for the first-generation Tower Master?”

Su Ping raised his hand, then he summoned Ji Yuanfeng and the others.

After a moment of shock, Ji Yuanfeng shook his head. “Do you want to ask him for help? I don’t have his contact details. I thought he was dead until he showed up today; his student is probably the only one who can reach out to him.”

“Do you mean Gu Siping?” asked Ye Wuxiu.

Ji Yuanfeng nodded.

A legendary warrior next to Yuan Tianchen said palely, “When I was run... retreating, I saw that... that Mr. Gu was eaten.”

Everybody’s expressions had a slight change upon hearing that news.

Only the Lord of the Deep Caves could have eaten him; none of the Fate State beast kings were strong enough to deal with him.

Su Ping couldn’t help but heave a sigh in his heart, seeing that they didn’t have a solution. But he was prepared for that. He simply said, “In that case, we’ll just look for an opportunity. The Lord of the Deep Caves will soon remove the seal and release the planet’s astral power that has been sealed and accumulated for a thousand years.

“When the moment comes, Nie Huofeng may come out to compete for the astral power. If he does, I hope we can work with him to seal the Lord of the Deep Caves once again.”

Su Ping was going to say “catch,” but he said “seal” in the end, so that it would be easier for them to understand.

It would have been too scary if he proposed to catch the Lord of the Deep Caves.
