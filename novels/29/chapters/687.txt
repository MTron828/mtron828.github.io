Chapter 690 Feeling Him Out!

“My lady... you must be the current head of the Tang family.” The old man wearing emerald earrings stepped forward from the stunned crowd. He didn’t appear as composed as he did when the group arrived.

He never expected that he would see that vicious girl from the Tang family there!

Also...

Why was she acting like a greeter girl?

Wow, he knows me... Tang Ruyan raised her eyebrows. She was gloating again. It seemed that her heroic deeds when she helped the Tangs had impressed many people. She had surely earned fame across the Subcontinent District.

She cleared her throat and answered, “We have no head of the Tang family here, only a working girl. You’re welcome to come in and have a look if you’re here to buy something, but please don’t gather around like this if you’re not.”

A working girl... the onlookers were speechless.

The head of a family—the biggest ancient family of the Subcontinent District-was calling herself a working girl... You’re insulting the working class!

The old man wearing emerald earrings answered after hesitating for a bit, “Well, we are indeed here to buy pet food.” He suspected that the new head of the Tang family probably didn’t want people to know she was working there; she had to have some secret agenda. He then decided to play dumb in case he found out something he shouldn’t.

After all, the Tang family had become the most powerful family in the continent after devouring the resources of the other two families. They had at least a hundred or so titled battle pet warriors, including Tang Ruyan. No one would dare to offend the Tang family.

“Come in.” Tang Ruyan nodded.

The old man with earrings nodded. He was about to walk up the staircase with the crowd in tow when he heard a noise approaching.

The noise was loud but the titled battle pet warriors were still able to hear it when it was still far in the distance. They were able to tell that more than a dozen people were approaching

They turned around and saw the dozen people coming close in an instant.

Whoosh!

One of them vanished in the air, then reappeared right above the crowd. “Brother Su, we’re here!” He laughed heartily.

“Brother Li.”

Su Ping came out from the store.

Apart from Li Yuanfeng, he saw captain Ye Wuxiu, the old man that they called Mo, and a man from the Han family.

The four were old acquaintances from the Ice Field and the other legendary battle pet warriors were guarding the other fields; he had met them the second time he visited the Deep Caves.

“You’re all here!” Su Ping was surprised.

“Yes, I dragged over. We’ve heard about everything that’s happened. The Tower is disappointing... I heard that a whole continent was already gone...” Li Yuanfeng was laughing one moment but he pulled a long face the next second. A continent was destroyed. How many died!

He could not even imagine that!

Su Ping knew that their information wasn’t up to date because a second continent was added to the list.

As such, he could estimate the time when those legendary battle pet warriors left the Deep Caves.

While Li Yuanfeng was talking to Su Ping, the many titled warriors present gazed at them in confusion.

They realized they had never seen those people before.

The Tower? Disappointing?

Those words did not make sense. Why would a titled warrior... talk about the Tower like this? They remembered how he teleported over. Only the legendary battle pet warriors-aside from some freaks—could master that skill!

Is this man a legendary battle pet warrior?!

The elders of the Qin, Liu, and Zhou families were also stunned speechless. Since they knew that Qin Duhuang was at the legendary rank, they immediately noticed that the new arrivals had a similar rank!

Some of them were ten times or even a hundred times more powerful than Qin Duhuang!

Horrifying!

How could Mr. Su gather so many legendary battle pet warriors?!

He’s like a second Tower Master!

“Brother Su, I heard that you have the ability to finish warriors at the Void State,” said a middle-aged man in black armor who stepped closer from behind Li Yuanfeng. The look in his eyes was cold and determined; that was due the prolonged battles he had experienced Just standing there was threatening enough.

Su Ping didn’t feel offended by that challenging statement. He replied with a smile, “Brother Li has told you, right? He always says wonders about me. Don’t take that too seriously. But...”

His smile disappeared. “He was telling you the truth.”

He would be modest when necessary and not when unnecessary. Otherwise, he would be seen as a fool.

Li Yuanfeng had pooled this crowd together to fight against the wild beasts. It would reflect poorly on Li Yuanfeng if they questioned Su Ping’s ability and he merely used the humble card.

“Really?”

The legendary warriors still hovering in the air were wide-eyed, as well as the titled battle pet warriors on the ground.

The four people who had returned were dumbstruck. Dude, spare us the nonsense! This level of arrogance could get you killed!

“Is that so?”

The middle-aged man in the black armor squinted his eyes. They were willing to travel with Li Yuanfeng to meet the so-called “Brother Su.” For one thing, Li Yuanfeng had recommended Su Ping with passion. For another they were disappointed with the Tower upon finding out the things that happened above ground.

Li Yuanfeng had also said bad things about the Tower after a brief trip to the world aboveground at the Tower. Their impression about the Tower worsened after that. The fact was that the Nordic Continent had been destroyed. That was why they were willing to meet that Su Ping since Li Yuanfeng had been praising him all the time.

Some of them had seen Su Ping stepping into the Corridor, which had stirred up a sensation. They would, for now, believe that Su Ping had gotten some abilities since he could get out of the Corridor twice.

Su Ping did not answer. He gazed at the middle-aged man calmly and confidently.

The middle-aged man in the black armor gazed at Su Ping. He wasn’t intimidated like the others. “If that’s the case, why don’t he have a one on one bout, Brother Su? If you’re able to take it, I will sincerely believe you. I would be willing to work with you and talk about fighting the wild beasts!”

Li Yuanfeng said nothing. He understood that words would be useless from that moment on; whatever he said would be taken as inconsequential. Seeing is believing.

Su Ping had to settle this matter himself.

He had seen Su Ping in battles. He knew Su Ping could do it! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The other three old acquaintances of Su Ping didn’t comment, either. Su Ping had to get over that difficulty himself. They were also interested in finding out what Su Ping could do.

“No problem,” Su Ping said calmly.

The silence was caused by them. It was because of this calmness; that was a man who deserved respect.

“Okay.”

The middle-aged man in black armor such a calmness. “Guys, please set up a seal for us.”

“Sure thing.”

“Mind your strength. He is Brother Li’s friend after all.”

Two legendary battle pet warriors stepped forward.

Though the two did not deliberately show their energy, their mere presence was overwhelming. That was because of their experience in the Deep Caves.

An old legendary battle pet warrior said with a smile, “Please make some room for us, please.”

The titled warrior with emerald earrings and the others felt they were lifted off the ground before they knew what happened. They were all dumbstruck when they were able to see things again.

They were standing just outside Su Ping’s store, But then, they were over a dozen meters away!

All of them had been transferred over!

It happened so quickly!

What was that?

The titled warriors gazed at those standing in the air. They felt as if they were standing underneath more than a dozen beast kings.

Were they all... at the legendary rank?

That was a crazy idea that was taking root.

A lady at the legendary rank said indifferently, “Let’s go!” The old man who had moved away those at the titled rank unleashed his astral powers in full force. A seal was quickly formed in the air.

“System, don’t intervene,” Su Ping said to the system.

Those people were standing within the range of the store. He worried that the system would automatically try to protect the system protected by him, directly obliterating that middle-aged man.

He would have to change a location.

“Don’t worry. He’s weaker than you and he doesn’t mean you any harm. You are ready; I won’t intervene,” the system answered.

Su Ping nodded.

“Do you need to summon your battle pet?” the middle-aged man asked. Su Ping shook his head. “No.”

So, a man of confidence. The middle-aged man said, “I won’t summon battle pets, either. I’ll tell you this, though. I’m at the later stage of the Void State and I’m one step away from reaching the Fate State. The strength I am going to use is at about the middle stage of the Void State.”

Wow... that was detailed. Are you cautioning me?

Su Ping felt a bit humiliated but he knew the man did not mean it. “I suggest you wield all your power since you’re going to test my strength. Sir, don’t you worry; I can take it.” The middle-aged man looked at Li Yuanfeng.

Li Yuanfeng didn’t say anything after some hesitation. Su Ping had taken him out from the Deep Caves, and the kicker was that he wasn’t a man of impulse.

The middle-aged man smiled, since Li Yuanfeng didn’t object. “Good. I will do that, then.”

“Okay,” Su Ping replied with a smile. The lady and the old man powering up the seal looked at each other in surprise; they asked Ye Wuxiu who had remained quiet for quite a while. “Ye, what are you doing over there? Come and help us. Or do you want to see the Black Lunatic destroying a base city?”

The titled battle pet warriors could not believe what they had just heard.

Destroying the base city? How strong would the energy have to be? They held their breaths. Ye Wuxiu came back to his senses. He stepped forward and poured his astral powers into the seal.

While Ye Wuxiu was doing so, the middle-aged man in the black armor had already started to unleash his own astral powers. The air was twisting around him and that was because of the radiation produced by his cultivation. He had combined spatial rules with his astral powers which could disturb space in unknown ways.

Only those with a profound understanding of space could have done so.

Su Ping stood by the door and watched with his hands clasped behind his back.

His astral powers were pure and condensed after all the Heaven’s Tests he had taken. His astral powers would be better than that of any legendary battle pet warrior present!

Astral powers were light when they were pure. As such, he could act faster than any regular warrior. If someone had to use three seconds to prepare a skill, he would only use 0.3 seconds!

Boom_!

Lightning bolts came into being all of a sudden; they had emerged from the middle-aged man in the black armor. All his hair was standing on end.

He withdrew his sword.

The light from the sword was so bright that the titled warriors felt their eyes were burning up. They had to close their eyes.

However, they were very curious about the upcoming battle. They used astral powers to repair their eyes so that they could keep them open. Lightning bolts and astral powers were converging on the blade. The middle-aged man’s eyes were flickering. He stared at Su Ping who was still composed, so composed that it made things seem as if he would have given up. The middle-aged man did not stop.

“I cannot believe he is doing this.” The old man realized that the matter was more serious than expected. The Black Lunatic was using his best move. He had learned that skill in some Mysterious Realm and he combined it with the lightning skills he had learned.

“Go ahead!”

The middle-aged man shouted and held his sword. The many lightning bolts around the blade dashed forward and the ray of sword light whooshed out!

Su Ping also took action the moment the middle-aged man waved his sword. A golden glow came over his eyes. Su Ping was using the actual Divine Energy, strong and pure; he was becoming something akin to a god!

The next second, he focused his astral powers on his fist.
