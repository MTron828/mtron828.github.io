Chapter 1350 The Breeze (1)

“It’s complete for now. I’ll come back later,” said Su Ping

That body polishing was extremely rewarding. However, he didn’t think his body had been fully polished yet; there was still room for improvement. His estimate was that his body would become as strong as that of an Ancestral God once it was fully polished!

However, it would take a very long time to achieve such refining. Su Ping was planning on going back to the world outside and see what was going on.

“You can come back any time,” said the realm master, “Don’t forget our deal.”

Su Ping nodded and was about to leave, when two voices sounded all of a sudden. “Young friend, please wait a moment.”

Su Ping turned around and saw they were the other two God Emperors who were collecting Heavenly Fire’s energy there.

“You must be a Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute, right? I am Qing Bing of the Tan Clan. I’d like to make friends with you; feel free to look for me if you ever need to forge a weapon. I know a thing or two about weapons. I surely won’t disappoint you,” said the gray-robed man with a smile.

The other old man also tried to make friends with Su Ping. “I am Tian Dan from the Yao Clan. You can come and find me if you’re short on herbs; I dabble a bit in medicine refining.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The realm master was slightly surprised, but she quickly understood their intentions and secretly heaved a sigh. Geniuses were welcome everywhere; others would probably never get a chance to receive their help even if they asked. However, those two were actually fighting to befriend the young man; it was clear that they had noticed his terrifying potential.

“You’re too kind, seniors.” Sensing their kind attitude, Su Ping would certainly not slight them. Any connection he made would act as a deterrent to protect his fellow humans in that world.

...

“Dao Child, how I envy you. These two masters are usually very proud. It would have been impossible to request weapons or pills if I hadn’t lent them the Heavenly Fire,” said the realm master, subtly pointing out that their identities were special.

She didn’t mind him making friends with those two seniors. After all, Su Ping was a member of the Yan Clan in a sense; the stronger his connections, the better. “You’re making fun of us, master.” The two old men smiled helplessly but didn’t deny the fact. They wouldn’t have accepted the realm master’s every request if not for the access to the Heavenly Fire, unless she had paid a good price.

“You polished your body with Heavenly Fire. Your body must be as sturdy as that of a God Emperor, if not better. I will refine a Chaos World Pill and a Mythical Dao Body Pill for you if you enter the fire and fetch me a piece of Divine Fire Crystal!” said Tian Dan.

“Hey!”

Qing Bing from the Tan Clan was quite surprised by such a request.

The realm master narrowed her eyes and said in a daze, “Master Tian Dan, how generous of you; both are rare pills. You said before that you were short of materials when I asked for some...”

“I was. I’ve just found all the necessary materials.” Tian Dan stared at Su Ping with a normal expression. “I’m sure you haven’t taken these two pills yet; they will surely help you rise to new heights.”

Based on her reaction, Su Ping knew it had to be some marvelous medicine. He said with a different expression, “What are Divine Fire Crystals?”

Master Tian Dan was clearly delighted, given that Su Ping’s interest was piqued. He quickly replied, “Divine Fire Crystals are the essence of the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire, which contains the most abundant fire. It’s the best fire you can use to refine unparalleled medicine. If you want to fetch some, you must go to the deepest part of the Heavenly Fire...”

While speaking, he glanced at Su Ping and said, “If you think it’s too hard, I can wait until you can resist entering deep into the fire.”

The realm master slightly raised her eyebrows. She casually said, “What kind of medicine are you trying to refine? Does it require such divine crystals? Normal Heavenly Fire can’t satisfy you anymore? In any case, even if the Dao Child doest get a Divine Fire Crystal for you, it’s still a treasure of this realm that mustn’t be given away easily, or I won’t be able to explain to my family.”

Tian Dan realized what she was implying. He instantly said, “I would certainly make up for your loss. As long as you provide materials, I will refine you three pills for free! In addition, I will give you a Mythical Dao Body Pill. How does that sound?”

The realm master was secretly dazed for a moment. Tian Dan’s offer was too tempting for her to refuse.

Although Divine Fire Crystals were quite precious, it wasn’t of much use to her. Besides, they were constantly condensed by the fire, and would be replenished in twelve thousand years or so.

Seeing that the realm master was deep in thought, Tian Dan looked at Su Ping again. “Dao Child, what do you think?” Su Ping thought for a moment and said, “All right. I’ll get you a divine crystal next time when I’m ready.”

“All right!”

The senior was delighted by the agreement. “I’ll be waiting for you. I hope you won’t keep me waiting for long.” Su Ping nodded and smiled. “In the meantime, you can start preparing the pills, master.”

“Of course,” said Tian Dan with a smile.

Qing Bing heaved a sigh, but chose to remain silent.
