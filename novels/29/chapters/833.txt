Chapter 834: Arrival

Rumbling Thunder Continent—

On an enormous mountain deep inside the Thunderous Woods.

Many Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were gathered. Some were flying above the mountain, and some had landed on the top.

There was a deep lake at the peak. Half of the lake had been filled with blood.

A dragon was crouching in front of the enormous lake; its body had been entirely tied up with chains and impaled with sharp black nails, making it impossible for it to move!

Next to the strong Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon was a white long serpent. Its white scales were bloodstained, and was also impaled to the ground.

An intimidating, cold and ruthless voice emerged from an old dragon.

“You come from a lesser species, and yet you allured one of our kind and attempted to have a child. That’s punishable by death!”

“Kill them!”

“Kill them!”

“Kill them!”

All the dragons roared outside of the field. Their roars echoed throughout the mountain.

On the ground, the long white serpent lay with sorrow in its eyes.

Nearby, the restrained dragon suddenly widened its half open eyes!

“Roar!!”

It let out such a mad and intimidating roar all the other dragons’ roars were suppressed!

“You must kill me first if you want to kill her!” said the enchained dragon with bloodshot eyes. It craned its head, and the chains on its body were tightening and tearing at its body. Blood sprang and dripped on its scales.

It raised its head and looked around with pride and dignity.

On the ground, the long serpent trembled and looked at it. Tears flooded out of its eyes. It sobbed and said, “No, don’t worry about me. You’re the prince; they won’t do anything to do. My death is nothing. If there’s an afterlife, I’ll definitely be reborn as a dragon so that we can live together...”

“You don’t need to be reborn as a dragon. You are a perfect match for me right now!” The massive dragon lowered its head and looked down gently.

The long white serpent cried sadly with tears on its face.

All of a sudden, a devastating roar burst out, and a horrifying pressure covered the field.

“Shut up!”

All the dragons lowered their heads and looked at the new arrival in awe.

It was their clan master!

“Evil son! You mated with a humble long worm and even gave birth to a weird bastard. When will you come to your senses?” bellowed the clan master furiously.

“She’s not a long worm. She’s my partner!” The dragon raised its head and looked at the superior being, which was actually much bigger than itself.

That was their king, the one it had never dared to defy, until that day. It looked at its father with fury and determination in its eyes!

“Shut up!” the clan master roared again, finding it impossible to tolerate the situation. It said to an older dragon nearby, “Execute them and let them die in the Dragon Transformation Lake. It’ll be our last mercy for them!”

“As your wish, clan master.” The old dragon accepted the order dutifully.

Exactly at that moment, an exclamation burst out.

The sky above became dark, and the moon appeared.

Stars were also moving at a high speed at the same time, and a neighboring planet with a distinctive ring was left behind; it could no longer be seen.

“Huh?”

The clan master was stunned to see that. It raised its head in shock. “Why is the planet moving? How is it possible? O’Neil is definitely incapable of this. Did he encounter a formidable enemy?”

At this moment, the nearby dragons also exclaimed, shocked by the unprecedented scene.

An elder couldn’t help but ask, “C-Clan master, what’s this about?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Is it an illusion? What’s O’Neil up to? Has he found out about our escape operation? The clan master was puzzled and suspicious too.

On the ground—the impaled Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon didn’t look at the strange phenomena. It simply lowered its head and tried its best to move closer to the long white serpent despite the flowing blood. They looked at each other affectionately; they only cared about each other at the moment.

Being determined to die, they preferred to cherish whatever time they had left together.

“The stars are moving!”

“No, I think our planet is moving!”

“What’s going on?”

All the dragons looked up at the sky, so distracted by the unusual phenomena that they forgot about the execution altogether.

...

The Laiyefa family, which ruled over their planetary system, was also shocked when Rhea sailed away from Zeruprun.

They had been monitoring every planet in their territory; they had quickly noticed when Rhea bolted away.

“What is going on?”

“Is Rhea running away?”

“Was it pulled out from the gravity ring? Is there something wrong with the planet’s gravity?”

“I don’t think so. The readings of the surveillance devices are normal. It seems that some external power is pushing this planet away!”

“Weird. It’s been detected that the waves on the planet were in the green range when it broke free from the solar system. They were only equal to a level-nine tsunami!”

“That’s not possible. It’s fleeing so fast that a global level-20 apocalyptic tsunami should have been caused, considering the momentum!”

At the same time, Rhea’s cry for help was sent.

Very soon, their intelligence report and Rhea’s cry for help were both delivered to the leader of the Laiyefa family.

“Rhea is flying off orbit?”

“Weird. No need to panic. I’ll go there and take a look.”

The master of the Laiyefa family instantly set off to investigate.

Being a Star Lord, he had his own special spaceship. He took it out of his storage and rose to the sky in the blink of an eye. Then, the engines were fully activated, boosting the spaceship into a vortex right in front of it like a sharp arrow.

Whoosh!

The spaceship disappeared; it was already eight light years away when it reappeared.

...

The spaceship soon reached Rhea after a few consecutive ships. While inside the spaceship, the Star Lord saw that Rhea was moving forward in the void like a burning meteorite!

“Huh?”

The lord was shocked by what he found when he caught up with Rhea. This planet seems to be covered by a mysterious and profound power... Is that an Ascendant State power?

It was shocking. Rhea is being moved by an Ascendant State expert?

Why would an Ascendant expert steal planet Rhea?

It’s not that prosperous a planet anyway. Did they find a random target? Weird. The Ascendant State expert never contacted me to talk about the matter. Is it due to fear of violating federal law?”

Lord Laiyefa frowned, wondering what to do.

He couldn’t be reckless when dealing with an Ascendant State bigshot.

“My lord, should we intercept Rhea?” said a sexy girl who wore a delicate space uniform.

She smiled with a vivacious expression, but she was actually a robot. Her skin was made of silicone gel which felt like human skin.

“No. Let’s just follow it for now,” said Lord Laiyefa, frowning.

It wouldn’t hurt to wait until things were made clear.

...

On Rhea, inside the store in Woffett City.

Su Ping asked Tang Ruyan to send the customers away and close the store.

Although some of the customers had noticed the glowing Green Lady, they didn’t know what she was doing, and would never associate the pusher of the planet with such a beautiful girl. After all, everything was too unbelievable. Most people were still unable to believe that their planet was moving; they thought that something had gone wrong in outer space.

“So fast!”

“Senior, how much longer can you hold up?”

Su Ping was still shocked as he looked at the map on the Lord Badge. The planet was moving as fast as a spaceship.

“How much longer?”

Green Lady turned around and looked at him. “Are you kidding me? You think this is an exhausting task?”

“...”

Fine, forgive me.

“The planet will do a spatial jump. It may be bumpy,” said Green Lady.

Then, the emerald light outside her body became more brilliant. After a “dum,” Su Ping felt an earthquake and heard exclamations.

“The sky is gone!”

“All the stars are missing. What’s going on?”

Everybody was shocked and frightened, not having the faintest idea about what was happening to the planet.

Su Ping came out of the store and looked, only to be crept out, as Green Lady had inserted the entire planet into a deeper space!

Deeper spaces were so dangerous that only those in the Void State could travel in the secondary space.

However, considering the pitch dark space outside the planet, Su Ping felt that it was more likely to be the tertiary space or the fourth space.

The deeper the space was, the faster one could travel. Suddenly, Su Ping heard ambiguous whispers that disappeared at a fast speed. However, he already had goosebumps.

Were those the whispers of the ancient creatures in the fifth space?

While Su Ping was numbed by shock, stars appeared in the sky again, and rays of sunlight were far away. A radiating star could be seen at a distance; they had jumped into a solar system.

Very soon, the scenes disappeared as the planet jumped again.

Su Ping returned to his store and looked at Green Lady, only to find that she was more solemn than before. It seemed that flying a planet in deeper spaces was a demanding task even for an Ascendant State expert.

Su Ping looked down at the map, only to be astounded.

The previous jump had covered one fifth of the entire journey!

They crossed at least seven solar systems, and were hundreds of thousands of light years away!

“Blue Planet...”

Su Ping looked at the glittering spot on the map, which was where his home planet was located. Father, mother, sister, wait for me. I’m coming!

Su Ping began to make preparations. He summoned the Inferno Dragon, the Little Skeleton and other pets and made sure they were in their best status.

Very soon, the second space jump was over.

The distance was significantly shortened again.

Time flew.

Everybody on Rhea remained shocked.

...

At the same time, on the Blue Planet.

Ever since the Deep Caves were unsealed, the planet’s land mass was significantly improved, and it was much bigger than before. Constructors returned to the continents that were ruined by beast tides when the disaster was over, then began the reconstruction process.

Most of the destroyed base cities had been mostly fixed.

In a deep sea adjoining the Subcontinent District—one could see a tall tree standing. The lower half of the tree was submerged in the surging sea, and the exposed part had already pierced through the clouds, seemingly stretching out of the atmosphere.

The crown of the tree was surrounded by clouds. Its green leaves were reflecting sunlight, showing its extraordinary nature.

That was exactly the mysterious tree that had emerged on the Blue Planet a couple of days prior.

The tree was so enormous that it was soon discovered. There was no way to hide it!

The Blue Planet was already connected to the Federation at the moment. Many travelers had gone to the Blue Planet, which was the oldest planet known as the Origin of Life, to see what that ancient planet actually looked like.

Given the presence of all those foreign travelers, it was impossible to keep the tree a secret. More and more adventurers had gathered for the tree as time went by.

Right then—many people were looking at each other vigilantly above the tree.

“There’s a mysterious force field underneath the tree’s crown. I can’t approach it!”

“None of my laws can break it. This tree is so mysterious. I think it’ll yield an incredible fruit!”

“This may very well be a Star Lord plant!”

“The Baloya family came here first, so the ancient tree belongs to us. Does everyone agree?”

“Bulls*it! Whoever sees it gets a share. The Baloya family isn’t qualified to monopolize it!”

All of them looked at each other coldly, mutually regarding the others as their competitors.

Far in the distance, several men floated on the sea and looked up at the tree, as well as the foreigners above it.

“That massive ancient tree grew too fast; it has to be a precious treasure. Are we really giving it away to the foreigners?”

“What choice do we have? Our lord isn’t here. Senior Nie was wounded and is still resting. All the warriors present are in the Star State just like Senior Nie. We’re incapable of keeping the tree, even if we wanted to.”

“Damn it. The tree grew on our planet. Why do we have to give it away? We’re not even allowed to have a share!”

A few men responsible for monitoring the invaders had gathered there. All of them had grim and angry looks.
