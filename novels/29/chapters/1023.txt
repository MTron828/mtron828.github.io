Chapter 1026: Assault

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“This is not possible!”

Loulan Lin’s faith was collapsing. She found the situation unacceptable.

She tried her best, yet she was completely unable to hurt Su Ping. Even though he had voluntarily stopped using the laws of time, he was still able to slay her with a single attack. The gap between them was devastatingly huge!

It also meant that she still had a very large room for improvement!

However, she had been feeling that she had hit a bottleneck and would hardly improve from then on, unless she found her own path and rose to the Ascendant State!

That was also an indicator that her talent and potential had almost been exhausted!

Is Lord Supreme’s disciple really this monstrous?

Loulan Lin looked at Su Ping with a complicated expression. She gnashed her teeth and said, “Let’s have one more match. You may go all out and I’ll use my real level too. Let’s have a real spar!”

“Okay.” Su Ping nodded readily; he was glad that she listened to his advice.

He would have started to feel bored if they fought again on the same level. After all, the gap between them was too wide.

Su Ping’s quick acceptance made Loulan Lin feel rather frustrated. However—having gauged his strength—she didn’t feel that the guy was underestimating her. She had never suffered such a huge setback since childhood; she felt like a loser now that she had been defeated by a Star State warrior.

The two of them entered the virtual battlefield again.

Su Ping smiled upon looking at Loulan Lin, whose aura had risen to the Star Lord State; he would finally be able to use more of his strength.

Although unable to release his small world, Su Ping had long discovered that Star State cultivators didn’t have to use the power of a small world to defeat Star Lords. They could break a Star Lord’s world as long as their laws were sharp and powerful enough!

If the world could compare to a hard iron ball, laws would then be like steel needles.

I don’t think my deity aura has been recorded. I’m just a regular Star State cultivator right now, only 2% as strong as my original self??Su Ping was rather excited. He had been performing his minor ultimate tricks, which weren’t costly and could be powered just a bit of the energy inside his body.

However, he was facing Loulan Lin who was a Star Lord using full strength, and he couldn’t make use of his small world. As a result, he felt unusually challenged due to the pressure.

Right before him—Loulan Lin was already prepared. She said solemnly, “This is rather unfair. I won’t mock you even if you fail.”

She meant it. She wouldn’t have challenged Su Ping in such unfair conditions if she hadn’t been as eager to prove herself.

She wouldn’t feel the least bit proud, even if she won.

Perhaps she simply didn’t want to lose, deep down inside, or admit that she was too weak!

“Okay.”

Su Ping glanced at her. He saw respect as well as fury in the girl’s eyes; so, his attitude also became solemn.

Su Ping intended to use all his strength despite all the restrictions! All to respectfully face his opponent.

Bang!

All restraints were removed as the battle began. Loulan Lin didn’t attack first this time; she waited for Su Ping to take action. A beautiful, scenic world popped up around her, with a hazy mist and rare flowers which blossomed all over.

It suggested that the world in her heart was clean and wonderful.

However, wonderful things weren’t suitable for battles. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Su Ping’s eyes turned deep. He quietly stood where he was, like a predator whose muscles had been warmed up. He calmly assessed his prey’s weaknesses.

The aura inside his body was flowing slowly, seemingly unprepared to fight right then.

And yet, all of the aura was concentrated in one direction.

Loulan Lin wasn’t in a rush either; after all, she was a Star Lord. It was normal for her realm to pressure Su Ping and make him act prudently. However, having made use of the power of her small world, she didn’t think he could beat her with any laws or skills. She was feeling embarrassed by how that unfair revenge was unfolding.

“Bring it on…”

Hardly had Loulan Lin opened her mouth when all the hairs on her body twitched. Her voice was muffled, and her body tightened; it was an instinctual reaction.

The beautiful world suddenly turned from an illusion to a real entity in front of her.

However, exactly at that moment, a sword aura mixed with the properties of many laws was already approaching.

The law of time!

The sword aura had arrived a second before she saw it.

Her small world blocked some of the sword aura, but not completely.

There was a boom, then Loulan Lin felt that her head had gone blank, as if something had broken and was then digging into her shell.

Following that, she saw that the sword aura turned into the most brilliant light that occupied her world.

“Ahhhh!”

Loulan Lin couldn’t help but cry and move back. Then, she nearly fell off. She found herself back in the cabin, and the equipment in front of her was displaying the final image of the battle, when her “body” collapsed on the virtual battlefield. Su Ping was the winner!

Loulan Lin gazed at the scene, not entirely convinced.?How did I fail?

She enshrouded herself with her small world for protection, considering that Su Ping could ambush her with the law of time. Still, her small world was shattered?

On the other side—Su Ping took off his helmet, feeling satisfied.

The previous experiment had allowed him to discover one thing: unleashing the full strength of a normal Star State cultivator in the advanced phase was precisely enough to penetrate a Star Lord’s small world!

Loulan Lin ranked among the top thirty fighters on the Divine Lord Rank, and her small world was much harder than those of normal Star Lords, which meant that only half the energy was required to deal with a normal Star Lord.

Considering proportions, it was merely one percent of his total energy!

The expenditure was so insignificant that he could easily absorb and recover energy right after using it.

That was the advantage of having abundant astral oceans. Not only did they boast a fifty-fold capacity, he was also able to replenish his energy and heal himself much faster than normal Star State cultivators while in real battles!

“This is impossible…” Loulan Lin found the picture rather disorienting. She even suspected that something had gone wrong with the equipment.?Did I sit in the wrong direction?

Or maybe, was her astral sign not compatible with Su Ping’s?

“How did you do it?” Loulan Lin looked at Su Ping with eagerness overflowing through her eyes. She could not believe what she had just seen.

“I have a secret technique that is called God’s Arrival…”

Su Ping was going to explain further, but then the cabin trembled violently; the ship might have hit something. Loulan Lin’s pet instantly fell from the table; however, it was quick to react. The creature jumped and landed safely, before it looked out of the cabin with vigilant eyes.

The Little Skeleton, at the moment resting on the floor, lost its bones. Some of them slid under the couch, and its skull rolled until it reached one of the cabin’s walls, just like a ball; its eye sockets were emitting red colors, as if blinking.

“What is going on?”

Loulan Lin was stunned.

Su Ping suddenly had a strong sense of danger, so he instantly unfolded his small world. Once his small world appeared, golden light shone and enshrouded Su Ping, Loulan Lin, and the other serving Star Lords in the cabin. After that, a deafening explosion burst out.

A sharp stream of silver light dashed over, and the spaceship was quickly burnt into dust, vanishing into space.

The space vessel was so solid that even Star Lords would have a hard time trying to destroy it; however, it was as vulnerable as paper in the eyes of an Ascendant. The Federation had yet to create spaceships and equipment effective to deal with Ascendant State cultivators.

That was also one of the reasons why Ascendants were so renowned.

They were in a dark area where planets of different sizes could be seen at the moment; however, all those planets seemed desolate.

“Who’s there? Stop hiding and show yourself!” Director Xue appeared in front of Su Ping and Loulan Lin. The girl who flew the spaceship solemnly stood behind them.

There was nobody else in the dark space. A streak of silver light darted again from the void and moved towards Loulan Lin the moment Director Xue said that.

Director Xue’s expression had a slight change of expression. His Divine Mark surfaced on his forehead, and the entire void seemed to be collapsing. He then shattered the silver light.

“Pay a hundred Divine Source Stones if you want to pass!” said a cold voice which echoed in space, spreading in all directions.

“Space bandits?”

Director Xue narrowed his eyes and said, “Are you aware that we are members of the Loulan family? Our family emblem is included in the spaceship’s livery. Or, are you indeed aiming at us?”

“What’s all that about the Loulan family? You think the Loulans own the universe? I only rob those who are rich. Hurry up! Cough up the Divine Source Stones and your lives will be spared!” declared the voice.

Director Xue squinted a bit, then glanced at Su Ping who was behind him. After a moment of silence, he suddenly manifested a hundred shiny stones. “Are these enough?”

“Yes!”

The voice laughed, and a force was unleashed to collect the loot. “Big families are truly generous!”

The voice sounded delighted. However—witnessing the situation from a place in deep space—the mysterious speaker Yin Xing was feeling quite gloomy. His target succumbed too easily; the group of travelers willingly allowed themselves to be robbed, which was beyond his expectation. One of his speculations was that his target had already realized the robber’s true purpose.

Yin Xing laughed and said, “See you later!”

Right when he said that—streaks of silver light burst out of the void, flying from all directions toward Director Xue.

“They’re indeed coming for us!” Coldness surfaced in Director Xue’s eyes. He summoned his spear, and four Ascendant pets stepped out of the vortices around him.

Considering the beautiful pilot, there were altogether five Ascendant State pets!

All of them looked like human beings, but they then roared and revealed their monstrous, real appearances after being summoned.

Gigantic, horrifying creatures began to appear. Some entered Director Xue’s body and merged with him, while others unleashed their abilities and made space collapse.

One of the pets was an eight-armed, hundred-meter tall ape with black fur all over its body. It extended its hands and twisted the void as if it were cloth, in an attempt to locate the enemy hiding there.

Bang!

A fiery pillar suddenly emerged from the void and struck the ape in the chest. The scorching flames on the surface began to disperse, but the sparks contained many laws of fire; even the hardest ores on a planet would have been burnt to ashes by those laws!

Only laws could be used to fight laws!

The eight-armed ape roared, not giving a single step back. Instead, it moved forward and stomped on the void as if standing on solid ground, making the void shake. While feeling exasperated, it then extended its hands into the deep space, breaking the fiery pillar and pulling out a gigantic hand.

However, the head was ten meters in diameter, and the neck behind it was dozens of meters long. Further behind was another hideous head that was unleashing a complete path of lightning towards the ape.

Countless lightning bolts exploded, containing the traits related to the law of lightning. A complete path was tremendously horrifying; it could easily tear a Star Lord’s small world apart..
