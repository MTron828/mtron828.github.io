Chapter 1153: Challengers

Zhuang Bizhe thought for a moment and said, “Other disciples might have misunderstood him.”

Mu Xuefeng slightly nodded her head and asked, “Apart from them, are there other exceptional candidates?”

“The others don’t have deity constitutions. Most have merely cleansed their marrows; some junior brothers who aren’t talented enough haven’t even done that yet. It’ll take years before they build their foundations.”

Zhuang Bizhe smiled and added, “However, there are two junior brothers that are quite exceptional; they’ve already built two foundations, showing an extraordinary power of understanding. They might become core disciples too.”

“Oh?”

Mu Xuefeng’s eyes glittered. “In that case, bring them here too; I’d like to hand them a gift.”

“Yes.”

…

The news that Mu Xuefeng had finished her training session was a shock to many disciples. Some disciples felt jealous upon learning that some of the outstanding new disciples were to be rewarded by their master.

Su Ping had been training deep inside the jungle and was oblivious to the whole matter.

“Every step in the cultivation path is more difficult than the last; I didn’t expect to be surpassed that quickly. I do envy Senior Brother Tang for his innate deity constitution.”

“Senior Brother Fang built his foundation without a deity constitution. Maybe we’re just too stupid.”

“I’ve just cleansed my marrow. I’m almost ten times stronger than before and it’s a breeze to knock down a dozen muscular men. I was going to take a break for a couple of days, but I didn’t expect them to be so far ahead.”

Everybody whispered on the mountain.

Mu Xuefeng resumed her secluded training after helping in foundation improvement for her disciples, then another half a year passed in the blink of an eye.

Every disciple would be tested a year after their admission.

On that day, all freshmen were informed to gather in front of the hall.

“Is everybody present?”

Zhuang Bizhe stared at the junior brothers and sisters as he stood by the gate.

“Two are missing. Junior Brother Zhou went to the rear mountain for training a couple of days ago and was hurt by a ferocious serpent. He’s still resting and cannot join us; he asked me to report his condition to you and Master,” said a young man respectfully.

Zhuang Bizhe frowned a bit. “Can he get off his bed?”

“Well… I think so.”

“Then have him come; there’s a chance that Master can help treat him,” said Zhuang Bizhe.

Dazed for a moment, the young man quickly replied, “Got it. I’ll fetch him immediately.”

“Who else is missing?” asked Zhuang Bizhe.

Everybody looked at each other in bewilderment. They noticed that only five of the six people with deity constitutions were at the front. Obviously, one of them was missing.

“It’s our junior brother named Su Ping,” said a young man angrily. He was among the disciples with deity constitutions.

“I heard that he’s been cultivating on the rear mountain; I haven’t seen him in a long time. Some claimed to have seen him surrounded by ferocious beasts in the woods; I don’t know whether or not this is true.”

“Did he accidentally get killed in the jungle?”

The other disciples speculated. The ones who had once offered gifts to Su Ping could only sigh, feeling that their investment had been wasted.

“He has a deity constitution anyway. Why did he cultivate on the mountain?” asked someone curiously.

The others who had deity constitutions were able to cultivate in the special cave frequently, all thanks to the financial aid of their senior brothers and sisters; they had been making progress at a fast pace. As for the mediocre people like them, they had to train on the rear mountain and hunt beasts for spirit stones.

Zhuang Bizhe keenly heard their whispers and frowned. “Did something really happen to him?”

Mu Xuefeng had also heard their discussion clearly. She furrowed her brow and said to Zhuang Bizhe, “Go take a look on the rear mountain. Bring him back if you find him.”

“Okay.” Zhuang Bizhe nodded.

Having already cultivated the second volume, he was able to establish a world inside his body and was able to detect anything on the rear mountain.

Whoosh!

Zhuang Bizhe simply tore the void apart and entered the rear mountain.

His unpredictable flash shocked many of his fellow disciples, who showed envious looks.

On the rear mountain—

Su Ping was still cultivating inside a cave.

He had plundered a massive amount of treasure from Old Monster Ye’s palace. Much of it was in the form of pills that had extinguished their consciousnesses. So, Golden Lotus didn’t take them away; she left them in the treasury and Su Ping picked them up.

Su Ping had been making dramatic progress thanks to those pills.

I didn’t trigger any Heavenly Tribulation when I made the major breakthrough like I did before. Do I have to become a Star Lord to trigger it??Su Ping was surprised. However, he had been through enough Heavenly Tribulations; one missing tribulation didn’t matter at that point.

Exactly at that moment—Su Ping detected a visitor.

“Huh?”

Judging by the guy’s robe, he was very likely a senior brother of his.

“A beginner Star Lord…”

Once he sensed the guy’s level, Su Ping concealed his aura and took out his watch. He realized that a year had passed since his enrollment.

“It’s been a year already…”

Su Ping heaved a sigh with troubled feelings. He looked out of the cave, only to find that the tiger was still working as his guard. It had actually risen from the seventh to the ninth rank.

A two-rank spike in only one year was rather astonishing; it was the fastest the tiger could advance considering its bloodline.

There were also three dog-sized tigers next to Su Ping, healthy and strong. Even though they were still young, they had all reached the fifth rank.

All of them had benefited a lot from Su Ping’s cultivation.

It’s time to go back. I should also ask Master where I can find the core of the Realm of Deities…?Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He quickly moved to the cave’s entrance.

He released some of his aura, then noticed how the young man quickly dashed towards him.

Indeed, he’s looking for me.

Su Ping waited patiently for Zhuang Bizhe to arrive.

The latter was slightly astonished to see Su Ping, and even more shocked to see the tiger at the entrance of the cave. He was about to kill it—

“Wait a second, senior brother,” said Su Ping quickly, after noticing his deity aura waves.

Zhuang Bizhe: “?”

“Please spare it,” said Su Ping.

Zhuang Bizhe was stunned for a moment. He was in a hurry to attack because he feared that the beast would hurt his junior brother; he didn’t expect that Su Ping would defend it. It wasn’t until that moment when he realized that the beast wasn’t intent on hurting Su Ping. There were also a couple of young tigers next to the latter, which seemed to be close to him.

“Are you Junior Brother Su? What’s going on here?” Zhuang Bizhe couldn’t help but ask.

“I can communicate with beasts; they won’t hurt me,” said Su Ping.

Zhuang Bizhe was enlightened. He said, “Junior Brother Su, you’ve cultivated here for a year, right? I had someone check your dormitory; everything is covered in dust.”

“I lost track of time when I devoted myself to cultivation,” said Su Ping.

Zhuang Bizhe was lost for words. “Master feared that something had happened to you and sent me to fetch you. Come back with me since you’re all right. It’s been a year, so it’s now time to test your performance. Those who are outstanding shall be rewarded.”

“All right.” Su Ping had already realized the purpose of the man’s visit.

Zhuang Bizhe rolled his sleeves and shrouded Su Ping with a cloudy power. Then, they quickly set off.

Su Ping turned around and looked back to say goodbye to the tigers outside the cave.

The two of them returned to the hall. They could perceive the inhaling and exhaling sounds from a high platform where disciples were practicing.

Zhuang Bizhe and Su Ping walked out of the void, then flashed to a certain place down the stage. Su Ping had already been through similar things and wasn’t surprised. He cupped his hands at Mu Xuefeng. “It’s an honor to see you, Master.”

“I’m glad that you are fine.” Mu Xuefeng gave a slight nod, then narrowed her eyes when she fixed her attention upon Su Ping.

“Thank you for your concern, master,” Su Ping quickly replied.

“Humph. Junior Brother Su is truly an honorary guest. Nobody can invite him over except our senior brother,” said an angry young man with a snort. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Su Ping looked at him in surprise. “Junior brother, who are you?”

“Junior brother? My name is Ma Bo. We came to this place together with Master. You don’t remember me?” The young man was even angrier, seeing that Su Ping had forgotten him; he was one of the few with deity constitution anyway.

“So, you’re junior brother Ma who came with me. Forgive me for my lack of respect,” said Su Ping, although the sentiment was not behind it.

Ma Bo was rather infuriated by the latter’s insincerity, but he held himself back because Mu Xuefeng was present. He said, “I heard that you were cultivating on the rear mountain. It’s been a year; you must have built your foundation, right?”

“Yes.” Su Ping nodded.

Ma Bo sneered in his heart, but didn’t show it on his face. He simply asked curiously, “How many foundation layers have you established, Junior Brother Su?”

“Are you my son? Why should I tell you?” Su Ping asked back.

Ma Bo burst into fury. “What’s that supposed to mean? You’re being absolutely disrespectful!”

Zhuang Bizhe frowned when he heard their argument and was quick to stop them. “That’s it.”

Ma Bo gritted his teeth and glared at Su Ping. “Let’s see how much progress we’ve made in the last year on the stage later, shall we?”

Su Ping was lost for words.?Where is this idiot from, provoking me nonstop??Does he really not know what death means?

“What’s your problem?” asked Su Ping.

Ma Bo replied grimly, “I beg your pardon?”

“Is it hard to understand that question?”

“You!”

Feeling sweat on his forehead, Zhuang Bizhe said angrily, “Shut up! If you want to fight, fight on the stage later!”

Ma Bo glared at Su Ping and finally fell silent.

Having no time to bother with him, Su Ping approached Mu Xuefeng and said, “Master, there’s something that I’ve wanted to ask you.”

“Oh?” Mu Xuefeng gazed at Su Ping with great interest. “What is it?”

“I wonder where I can find out more about the mysteries related to the core of deity aura?” Su Ping looked her in the eye.

Mu Xuefeng narrowed her eyes. “The core of deity aura? That’s already beyond any divine technique. If you find out about them, every word you say will be the truth; you have to grasp the second volume to see the true nature of things. As for the mysteries of deity aura, you’ll have to explore the twelve rivers in the sky.”

She looked up to the sky as she spoke.

It was still daytime; three suns were hanging high in the sky above them. The blue sky was boundless, but twelve rivers could be vaguely seen; they occupied the sky like twelve dragons.

“It’s said that all the deity aura comes from them; the twelve rivers are the origin of deity aura in the entire world. Many have tried to explore them, but they’re so dangerous that not even Deity Emperors can enter them easily,” said Mu Xuefeng softly.

The other disciples looked up at the sky after overhearing that, not knowing that the twelve rivers of clouds they had grown tired of watching were actually that mysterious and splendid.

“I have to go to the sky?” Su Ping raised his head and narrowed his eyes.

“Ha. Don’t aim too far,” said a sneering Ma Bo nearby.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and spoke frankly, “I’ll just punch you in the face if you keep being such a pain in the ass. You hear me?”

Ma Bo was dazed. He obviously didn’t expect Su Ping to be that bold, to threaten him right in the presence of their master.

“Punch me? Come and try!” declared Ma Bo angrily.

Pa!

Su Ping dashed forward and slapped him right after he said that. There was a crisp sound, and Ma Bo was flung back. Behind him was the arena; he fell right in the middle of it.

This brought shock to the pair of cultivators currently practicing there, as it was completely unexpected that a third person would join them.

Zhuang Bizhe was just as dazed. He was about to give his two juniors a warning, but was cut short; Su Ping acted too fast, before he could do anything.

“Is he Ma Bo?”

“Ma Bo, the guy with a deity constitution? Why is he in the area? It’s not his turn yet, is it?”

“He didn’t go there voluntarily; he was just slapped into the arena.”

Many people turned their heads and looked in shock at Su Ping, the one behind the slap.

The other man had a deity constitution, yet Su Ping had simply slapped him away.

He did it right in front of their master. He was truly bold!

How unruly. Isn’t he afraid that his master would punish him?

Zhuang Bizhe snapped out of his stupor, and looked at Su Ping with a mix of shock and fury. “What are you doing?”

“Granting his wish,” Su Ping replied naturally.

Zhuang Bizhe was rendered speechless.

Exactly at that moment—a roar came from the sky, and many radiant flying swords descended from the sky, with graceful arrow-like curves.

“It’s the Moon Watching Mountain!”

All the senior disciples wore awful expressions when the visitors revealed themselves.

“He Buyu from Moon Watching Mountain pays his respects, Senior Mu.”

A handsome young man in white clothes stepped out, carrying a sword on his back. He caught the attention of many female disciples.

Mu Xuefeng slightly furrowed her eyebrows. She nodded casually and asked, “Why are you here?”

“Moon Watching Mountain recruited a group of disciples last year. They’ve been working hard since then; my master asked me to take them out and see what the disciples of other sects were capable of, so that they’ll be motivated to work harder upon their return,” said He Buyu with a smile.

Mu Xuefeng asked casually, “Are you here to challenge us then?”

“We wouldn’t dare challenge you; we’re simply seeking your guidance,” said He Buyu quickly.
