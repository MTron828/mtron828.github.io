Chapter 117 Bustling Shop

Su Ping offered a goodbye to his mother and went to his room. But before he could start cultivating on his bed, he heard footsteps approaching; Su Lingyue then opened his door.

The girl tried to look unruffled, but the way her eyes darted about while avoiding his eyes suggested that she was anything but calm.

Su Ping expected his sister to barge into his room so he wasn’t surprised. For now, he would wait for Su Lingyue to speak first.

Su Lingyue listened to the sound of their breaths and suddenly felt stressed out. Never in her life did she think that she’d get so mentally strained just by entering Su Ping’s room.

While trying not to be too obvious, she took a quick glance at the man sitting on the bed, only to feel worse when she saw Su Ping looking at her all calm and collected.

This made her angry.

“...Don’t you have something to tell me after what happened at the academy?” Su Lingyue spoke up while keeping a straight face.

“What do you mean? What do I need to tell

you?”

“Why you—” Su Lingyue clenched her teeth. “How on earth were you employed at our academy? And where did you steal that Inferno Dragon?” “Why would I tell you that?” Su Ping smiled slightly without looking too cocky. Su Lingyue grimaced as she realized that her hunch was true, much to her discomfort. “You awoke way earlier than we thought, didn’t you?”

Su Ping didn’t say anything about it.

Su Lingyue took several deep, careful breaths, before continuing. “That skeleton you have... You had enough strength to take me on since a while ago, am I right?” She was blushing when she said that. Judging by what she had seen during the day, her Phantom Flame Beast was nothing against the skeleton. If her brother managed to raise the Inferno Dragon to adulthood as well, he wasn’t going to “take her on.” She’d be squashed like a bug!

She knew she was no longer Su Ping’s rival. But she wanted to hear it from Su Ping directly. It would both annoy her and put her at ease. Somewhat.

Ugh. What a little nuisance she is. Su Ping complained to himself.

“As a matter of fact, yes.”

There was no point in denying. Everyone could see that Little Skeleton was more than enough to beat any of her pets.

Su Lingyue felt really bad even though she had expected such an answer. Why didn’t her brother show any signs of it? Until recently, she still gave him jump-scares in the morning. Why wasn’t he fighting back?

She could think of a good explanation for that but refused to believe it.

Su Ping lost his bit of patience when her sister just stood there without responding for several full minutes. “Go back to your room if you’ve nothing else to say. I need to cultivate.”

Su Lingyue gave him a final, thoughtful look and left the room.

Su Ping thought he needed to deal with more questions than those. But again, he was happy to be spared.

The next morning, Su Ping went downstairs and didn’t find his sister, which was rare. Most of the time, Su Lingyue would be having breakfast at such a time.

Did she receive too much of a shock and decided to run away from home?

He extended his perception and sensed astral power coming from Su Lingyue’s room. It seemed the girl was just sleeping in. Which was good. Su Ping made quick work of his meal, hailed his mother, stuffed another piece of toast in his mouth and left through the door.

Soon after he departed, Su Lingyue walked down the stairs while dressed in her full outwear for traveling outdoors. She wasn’t oversleeping; she was waiting to stalk Su Ping so she could find his secrets herself, since she couldn’t get any direct answers from him even if she asked where that Inferno Dragon came from.

It just so happened that she had nothing to do during the weekend.

“I’m leaving, mom!” She grabbed something from the bread basket and rushed to the door.

“Be careful, dear! Wait, aren’t you resting today?”

Li Qingru stepped out of the kitchen; by then Su Lingyue was nowhere to be seen.

“Busy with something? Oh, well. I should leave her be.”

Using her mother’s electric bike usually used for shopping, Su Lingyue headed to Su Ping’s shop as fast as she could while detecting his position by using her astral power as an “antenna.”

You can’t hide your stuff from me... She smirked proudly.

Half an hour later, Su Ping arrived at the shop at the usual time. When he was a few dozen meters away from the door, he saw a lot of young students already waiting in the chilly morning air, including several returning customers he recognized.

For some reason, there were way too many of them compared to before. Perhaps he was getting more and more famous among the students thanks to that lesson.

Several students saw him coming and all rushed his way; he almost crashed into them with his bicycle.

With his way blocked, he had no choice but to get off earlier. “Good morning, Mister Su!” “Hey, hey sir! Remember me??” “My pet, training, please!”

Su Ping tried shooing the several overly passionate people out of his face. “Make way! Like always, get in line and wait. First come first served!”

nt to lock up the bike again so it wasn’t snatched by a thief in the chaos. Luckily, no one asked why he was so protective of such a cheap bike.

Su Ping entered the shop and quickly scanned the waiting crowd. There were about 30 people. If he could get several training orders meant for middle-rank pets, those customers would provide him roughly twenty thousand energy points.

“Name, phone number, service. You know the drill.”

The one standing ahead of everyone spoke up, “It’s me, boss! Zhang Baoxing. A training round again.”

Su Ping remembered him. The guy was always there to train middle-rank pets. So far, he had contributed over 3,000 energy points to the shop.

“All right. An early riser, I see.” Su Ping nodded. “If I remember correctly, you’re always the first in line.”

“Heh heh... You know what, boss? I’ve been waiting here since 5 in the morning.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“What? Man...”

Several customers waiting further behind realized why they always fell behind even though they woke up pretty early each day. They silently made up their minds to arrive even earlier next time.

“Okay...” Su Ping wrote the new order. “Payment, if you will.”

As a frequent buyer, Zhang Baoxing made the transfer of 100,000 in a few seconds and summoned his Pyro Canine.
