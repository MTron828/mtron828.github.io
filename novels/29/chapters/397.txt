Chapter 399 Finish It

“What?”

Su Ping was going to see Xie Gange out, so he saw the approaching dark cloud as well.

He immediately used the Star Prism and gathered astral powers on his eyes. Coupled with the help of the Solar Bulwark, his vision was enhanced, soon recognizing that the cloud was a flock of birds.

Dark Feather Phoenix?

Thunder Sparrows?

Su Ping was puzzled. Both the Dark Feather Phoenix and Thunder Sparrow were birds but the latter was the former’s food. As a matter of fact, most of the birds were the Dark Feather Phoenixes’ food. Why would those two kids stay together?

Soon, as the flock of birds moved closer, Su Ping saw humans moving about on the backs of the birds.

This was not an attack.

Xie Gange was about to fly up and deal with the flock of birds when he noticed the humans as well. He gazed at the crowd. So, those people belonged to a certain force.

With such a power, that force had to be foreign.

All of a sudden, a name jumped into his mind. Only one family would use Thunder Sparrows as mounts! Why would that family come here?!

The dark cloud blotted out the light. The flock of birds came with an impressive display of power. The wind stirred up by their flapping wings was swept across the street, creating a doomsday view.

The reporters who still lingered outside the store were terrified. The heavy wind had turned over the devices and equipment they had set up. Some people were losing their hats to the wind as well.

“Huh?”

Inside the store, Venerable the Blade and the family elders were able to see what was happening in the street. They couldn’t see the sky since they were sitting or standing inside, but they did feel as if darkness had prevailed. It felt as if dark clouds had emerged from nowhere and a storm was brewing.

What caused the sudden change of weather?

Soon, some of them heard birds crying outside.

The cries weren’t loud; in fact, they were barely audible to the common people. But being titled battle pet warriors, they could hear the noise quite clearly, as if they were surrounded by the flock of birds.

What is going on?!

Surprised, they hurried to the door.

At the first look, they gasped.

So many birds! All of the numerous Thunder Sparrows had grown to the eighth rank!

In front of the Thunder Sparrows...

Some of the family elders held their breath. Is that the Dark Feather Phoenix?

A bird at the peak of the ninth rank?!

“They are...”

Following the family elders to the door were Tang Ruyan and Yan Bingyue.

Tang Ruyan’s first reaction when she saw the Dark Feather Phoenix was to be pleasantly surprised. But she immediately thought of something worrisome.

She would have started gloating, and pointing at Su Ping’s nose, shouting triumphantly if she had never seen what the skeleton was able to do. Having witnessed the skeleton’s power, Tang Ruyan was more worried than happy. She wondered how many of his family members were coming. She could tell from the number of Thunder Sparrows that it was a Feather Army!

In total, the Tang Family had five Feather Armies!

There were five thousand Thunder Sparrows in the five armies and all the masters of the Thunder Sparrows were eighth-rank battle pet warriors. Those eighth-rank battle pet warriors would normally be considered as big potatoes in the remote base cities. However, they were merely members of the Tang Family’s Feather Army!

As powerful as the Feather Armies were, they were more suitable in a mass brawl. For one-on-one battles, an individual’s strength would matter more.

She wondered how many elders from the Tang Family had shown up.

Tang Ruyan was clutching her clothes. She was so nervous that her palms were sweaty.

A Dark Feather Phoenix...

Venerable the Blade was stunned when he saw the largest bird flying in front of the Thunder Sparrows.

The Dark Feather Phoenix enjoyed great fame; it was a quite rare pet. Few people owned a Dark Feather Phoenix in the entire Subcontinent District. The most famous one was the person from the Tang Family. Therefore, Venerable the Blade had realized who was coming right after seeing the Dark Feather Phoenix!

He remembered the girl from the Tang Family who had been staying in Su Ping’s store. Venerable the Blade cast a glance at the girl. The Tang Family must have received the news and was coming for her!

Su Ping had just taken care of Xie Gange from the Star Organization and then the Tang Family arrived.

Venerable the Blade curled his lips and gazed at Su Ping from behind. Su Ping was too good at stirring up trouble. First, he provoked the largest force in the Subcontinent District and then he rubbed an ancient family the wrong way.

Venerable the Blade realized he had indeed paid a visit on the wrong day. He had accomplished nothing this day, other than joining in the fun.

“Dark Feather Phoenix. Are they from the Tang Family?” “I think so. I’ve heard about them.”

The other family elders were whispering.

Qin Shuhai was confused. Was there anything special about the day? He could understand why the Star Organization would make a move. But why would the Tang Family go there?

Su Ping heard the whispers. The Tang Family? Interesting

He looked at Tang Ruyan. Finally, he could use her to get something practical. In the meantime, the Dark Feather Phoenix flew downward until it stopped to hover in the air. The Dark Feather Phoenix had a wingspan of over a hundred meters, which had blotted out the light across several stores. With the other two ninth-rank battle pet warriors and the flock of Thunder Sparrows, no place on the street could see any light.

The flock of birds stopped. The reporters outside the store were shaking in fear. Some even planned on running to Su Ping to seek some protection. However, Su Ping and those titled battle pet warriors were another source of pressure. The reporters gave up on the plan and inched closer to the walls.

A certain number of reporters were quite like war correspondents because they still didn’t forget to take photos in that critical moment.

A suffocating atmosphere enveloped the entire street as the Dark Feather Phoenix and the Thunder Sparrows stopped. The people on the street were on edge.

Cry!!

The Dark Feather Phoenix called. The shrill cry was like an invisible and intangible sharp blade. The glasses were shattered in buildings on the street that weren’t part of the pet store!

The average men in the street covered up their heads. That bird call had almost knocked them unconscious. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“We are from the Tang Family!

“Who is the boss of the Pixie Pet Store? Come out!!” shouted a man standing on one of the Thunder Sparrows. The man had a stalwart figure; he had crossed his arms in front of his chest. He was able to remain standing on the soft feathers of the Thunder Sparrow without any help from any devices. He was looking down to see the street below.

The family elders stared at Su Ping in astonishment.

It was the truth. Those people were from the Tang Family, one of the four ancient families in the Subcontinent District!

They had gone there for Su Ping!

What has this devil done to upset the Tang Family?

Su Ping saw the glasses breaking on the buildings. He could tell that some people were bleeding out of their eyes and ears because of the shrill cry. A glint of coldness rose in his eyes. He could not sand this.

“Finish it!” Su Ping said, coldly.

That furious voice frightened Xie Gange, Venerable the Blade, the elders, and Tang Ruyan.

They all knew that Su Ping could make that happen!

But this was the Tang Family! Could he do this to them?!

The Little Skeleton was standing next to Su Ping. Upon hearing the command, the Little Skeleton looked at him and then the huge Dark Feather Phoenix in the sky above the street. A crimson glow rose in the Little Skeleton’s eye sockets. The glow grew brighter and brighter until they seemed like two balls of fire were burning in the eye sockets! A strong killing intent was emitted from the Little Skeleton.

Realizing that the legendary-rank skeleton was going to take action again, the family elders hurried to the sides in fear.

Venerable the Blade and Xie Gange were just as afraid as anyone else. Not daring to stand in the way, they stepped to the sides to make room.

Yan Bingyue was again baffled. She had seen the skeleton taking action before. Sure, it was incredibly powerful. Even so, why were Venerable the Blade and King of Arms so scared?
