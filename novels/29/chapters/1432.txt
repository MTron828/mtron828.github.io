Chapter 1434 Gathering of Ancestral Gods (2)

Su Ping understood the concept. He nodded and dropped the subject. He then asked the Dark Dragon Hound to look for nearby God Emperors. They quickly found a divine beast that they had beaten up earlier, and the latter was so scared that it fled the moment it saw them. However, Su Ping flashed over and blocked its escape route. He said with a smile, “Play with my buddies for a while.”

“Which clan are you from? Don’t push too far. If you’re too outrageous, I’ll eat anyone from your clan I come across,” said the divine beast angrily.

It had been terribly beaten up by Su Ping the previous time, so it wasn’t really confident of making such a claim.

“You’ll die if you dare eat any of them.” Su Ping smiled and then asked the Dark Dragon Hound and the others to “greet” their old friend.

His pets had fought the beast before; although they didn’t win in their last encounter, they had gained experience. They felt excited as they surrounded the beast again, hoping to subdue it.

Time flew. Several days passed in the blink of an eye.

One day, a rumbling noise came from the distance. A God Emperor beast that was fiercely fighting against the pet beasts felt so frightened that it turned tail and fled without caring about their incoming attacks.

Su Ping—who had been observing the battle and considering his things—was surprised by the unexpected noise. He sensed the horrifying pressure of an Ancestral God in the air.

“The Rain Clan?”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He didn’t expect that the Rain Clan would decide to act that quickly.

He looked at the source of the aura, which was a behemoth that looked like a walking titan. It stepped out of the void and stood in front of the Chaos Perception Dragon lying on the ground.

Su Ping changed his expression. His killing intent surged out and he quickly moved closer.

He was still too weak to fight an Ancestral God, but he had to help using his resurrection advantage.

Right after his aggressive arrival, he was dumbfounded by what he saw. The intimidating beast suddenly crouched in front of the Chaos Perception Dragon and concealed its aura obediently.

Su Ping was stunned, hovering in midair and not knowing what to do.

The Chaos Perception Dragon glanced at Su Ping who had just arrived, with a bit of gentleness in his eyes. Soon after the creature regained its usual coldness and said, “Relax. This is just my buddy.”

Su Ping opened his mouth in shock.

The Chaos Perception Dragon has a buddy too? And it’s an Ancestral God beast? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Boss, who’s this god?” The giant apelike Ancestral God raised its head curiously and grimaced. “Did he come here by accident? I happen to be hungry.”

Su Ping instantly sensed that a ferocious aura had locked onto him.

“Senior, are the Four Ferocious Beasts on close terms?” Su Ping asked the Chaos Perception Dragon.

The latter replied casually, “Make no mistake. He’s not one of the Four Ferocious Beasts. The four of us have taken a neutral stance; we can join forces if those gods gather and try to kill us. We won’t hesitate to take action and stomp those gods even if they’re only trying to get one of us. The Four Ferocious Beasts is not a grand name; there should only be one king.”

Su Ping was stunned by this, and could only smile bitterly. He was able to understand the relationship of the Four Ferocious Beasts. The most surprising fact was that the newly arrived Ancestral God beast was not even among them. It seemed that there were still huge gaps in power amongst them, and the Chaos Perception Dragon was undoubtedly on the top tier.

“Weird. Since when are you so close to gods?” The apelike Ancestral God heard their conversation and felt curious, finally dropping the idea of eating the young man.

“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask. Why are you here?” said the dragon indifferently.

The other behemoth slapped its head rather innocently. “I almost forgot. I just saw some Ancestral Gods passing through my territory; they seemed to be looking for something. I tailed them and eavesdropped, only to find that they were looking for you. So, I came to report the matter to you.”

The Chaos Perception Dragon couldn’t help but glance at Su Ping. “They must be the guys you talked about.”

Su Ping nodded and said, “Looks like it. How many Ancestral Gods are there in total?”

The ferocious beast glanced at Su Ping, only to discover that the young god was not scared of him at all, which puzzled him. However, he detected the abundant aura of chaos on Su Ping, vaguely guessing that the young man could be somehow related to his boss. He then changed his attitude and said politely, “There are six Ancestral Gods altogether.”

“Six. That should be right,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon all of a sudden.

Su Ping and the ferocious beast were dazed. The next moment—six figures appeared out of nowhere, coming from six directions. Their divine power surged out and surrounded the place, forming an independent world.

Su Ping saw the illusions made by the universes behind their backs and the connections of their divine power. Their power had completely isolated the place.

Is this the power Ancestral Gods can muster?

They could cut the grand universe apart by joining hands!

“You…”

The ferocious beast changed his expression; realization dawned upon him and anger followed. “You followed me here?”

“You’re right. This demonic ape is indeed rather dumb,” said a glowing Ancestral God who wore a tall jade hat.

“How else could we find the nest of this particular ferocious beast? It’s actually living near the Divine Eye. This is a good environment. Truly bold,” said an Ancestral Goddess who had an alluring body figure, wreathed in purple light. Her voice was sweet and intoxicating

“However, we must now take care of this demonic ape. It’s rather troublesome. Which of you wants to do the honors?” said an imposing person who held a spear. He looked like a tough young man. “Let me. Give me some time; I can kill it as long as it doesn’t run off,” said a chuckling fellow, who was another Ancestral God. “That’s the brat who killed multiple God Emperors of the Rain Clan, right? I heard that he’s a human being who rose to prominence a few years ago. I didn’t expect him to be a descendant of one of the Four Ferocious Beasts. Your God Emperors’ deaths are not surprising; I didn’t expect that a hybrid could be such a genius. We should try with a ferocious beast sometime,” said another Ancestral God, chuckling with a folded fan.

Su Ping saw that he looked similar to the guy from the Chentian Clan he had killed. His face turned cold.

“Since he’s here, we’ll just finish him off while we’re at it.” The Rain Clan’s Ancestral God was cold and determined to kill Su Ping. Never did he imagine he would be insulted by a God King.

“Let’s make things clear.” The charming Ancestral Goddess smiled. “He’s a Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute; you should take care of the grudges between him and the Rain Clan on your own. We just came here to hunt this evil beast. You don’t need our help to deal with this brat, do you?”

The Rain Ancestor snorted. “Don’t waste my time. I certainly don’t need your help.”

“Wow. You’re so mean. You weren’t like this when you asked us to come,” said the Ancestral Goddess after a chuckle.

The Rain Ancestor was about to say something, when he suddenly changed his expression. Not just him, the other five Ancestral Gods took swift action. The nearby time and space exploded, and the mountainous Chaos Perception Dragon slowly stood up.

The young Chaos Beast was sent back to Su Ping, still covered in purple light; it seemed to be going through some sort of transformation in that status.

“Don’t disturb it. Take care of it for me,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon indifferently.

“Senior, can you defeat five of them on your own? If you can’t, let’s just make a run for it. Don’t bother with me,” said Su Ping immediately. He retrieved the young Chaos Beast so that the battle wouldn’t affect its transformation.

“Up until now, I’ve only eaten four Ancestral Gods. They all tasted good.” The Chaos Perception Dragon licked its lips and its amber eyes gradually turned dark red, like two blood moons floating in the sky.
