Chapter 1485 Ancestral Gods’ Battle (2)

The aura belonged to an elegant young man clad in a green robe, his face alluringly beautiful. He carried the dominance of a man in power, along with an ancient aura of solitude. He was frowning, with coldness in his eyes.

“A-Ancestral God!”

“It’s the Rain Ancestor…”

Everybody was wide-eyed in shock. Their pupils shrank, and they trembled uncontrollably, as if fearing they would somehow offend his honorable existence by their smell alone.

The people of the Heaven Path Institute looked awful, not expecting the Rain Clan to be so petty. That was essentially a war declaration against them.

The clans that were hostile against the Rain Clan heaved sighs. At first they thought that the Rain Clan had one more enemy while they acquired an ally, but it would be for long.

“Ancestor!”

The emperors in hiding, including Lin Tianzhan, jumped out and paid their respects in delight. Their ancestor wouldn’t have gone there if the ferocious dragon was present. That was the best moment to kill Su Ping.

While ignoring his underlings, the Rain Clan Ancestor only stared at Su Ping coldly and indifferently. “Looks like that beast gave you a lot of power.”

“You can only cultivate power; no one can give it to you,” Su Ping said coldly, “Last time I warned you not to mess with me. Our grudges had been already cleared, and I’m not planning to retaliate anymore. However, you just keep making trouble for me. Do you really want your clan to be wiped out?”

All the onlookers gawked at Su Ping in shock.

He told an Ancestral God that he was going to annihilate his clan?

He’s even more arrogant than in the rumors!

Although they had to admit that Su Ping had the capital to be arrogant, he was facing an Ancestral God!

Anyone would have to bow in the presence of an Ancestral God!

No matter how extraordinary a genius was, becoming an Ancestral God was the highest achievement.

“Humph!”

The Rain Ancestor’s eyes were cold. No longer wasting time talking, he launched another attack. His power surged like a green rainbow, with the phantom of an ancient tree behind him. The tree seemed to be rising through the clouds, in remembrance of the world tree from the age of chaos.

It was said that there were eight world trees that held up the skies.

Lin Tianzhan and the other emperors looked at their ancestor in shock. Undoubtedly, their forefather was serious. Is it in answer to Su Ping’s provocation?

The others also realized that the Rain Ancestor wasn’t going to casually erase Su Ping from existence; he was using his real strength. Even his bloodline power was manifesting, which was proof of how formidable the strike would be.

The elder roared suddenly, “Rain Ancestor, do you really want to become the Heaven Path Institute’s enemy?”

The Rain Ancestor didn’t stop. If Su Ping wasn’t dealt with, there would be four Ancestral Gods in the Heaven Path Institute, making it harder for the Rain Clan to resist.

As for their three Ancestral Gods, one of them was pursuing the greater Dao; another was wounded a million years in the past, and had ever since cultivated in seclusion. As to the third and youngest, he wasn’t scared of them. The Rain Clan could face those three. However, the case would be different if Su Ping became an Ancestral God, too.

The guy had once killed emperors whose levels were higher than his, and would be tricky to deal with if he became the fourth Ancestral God.

“How stupid!”

Su Ping’s eyes grew even colder as he saw the attack. He suddenly countered, and the scorching Fire Dao universe appeared behind his back; it turned into a brilliant golden bird, which was the legendary Golden Crow.

He was already able to activate all the power in the Golden Crow bloodline and transform into a real Golden Crow, which was just one of his forms when he switched bloodlines.

Su Ping spat out flames like a ferocious bird that would burn the world. The Rain Ancestor was surrounded.

The seemingly young expert lost his cool the moment he noticed Su Ping’s Fire Dao universe. He couldn’t help but shout, losing his Ancestral God composure for a moment, “This is impossible!”

He had already felt that something was wrong when Su Ping resisted his strike. He believed it was an infused power from the ferocious beast, never expecting that it came from Su Ping’s undying universe!

He had learned everything there was to know about Su Ping through his sources, ever since their last failure. He analyzed thoroughly and realized that it was merely a young man with an extraordinary growth speed.

However, he then realized how terrifying that growth speed was!

Even Wen Tian—the most gifted Ancestral God of the Heaven Path Institute—was beneath Su Ping’s talent!

Bang!

The scorching flames were swept out, colliding with the green rain. The two terrifying powers began to tear the world of gods apart; even the aftershocks had forced the nearby emperors to flee.

In the blink of an eye, the territory within millions of kilometers was reduced to smithereens. All the beings in that area died in the wake of their attacks.

Without a doubt it was a veritable fight between Ancestral Gods, which could turn the entire world upside down!

That was the main reason why Ancestral Gods would be reluctant to fight, as casualties would soar if they intervened. In particular, the battlefield would be completely destroyed.

While in the midst of an energy storm-Su Ping and the Rain Ancestor marched to the void beyond the world of gods.

Su Ping thought of the Heavens and was more or less vigilant. He could leave that world at any moment, but he didn’t want to draw the Heavens’ attention.

The Rain Ancestor, on the other hand, stared at Su Ping with a contorted expression; no one knew what he was thinking.

A few attacks had helped him confirm that Su Ping had an actual undying universe. This would basically make it impossible to kill Su Ping on his own.

It was really difficult for an Ancestral God to kill a peer.

Only if several Ancestral Gods took action would this be possible, wearing the victim to deach.

The Rain Ancestor would end up exhausted before he could make the kill, even if Su Ping stood still and allowed the strikes to land. The exception would be for a far stronger Ancestor to act, like the Chaos Perception Dragon.

That was the reason why the Four Ferocious Beasts were so infamous.

They could eat Ancestral Gods!

“Do you regret it?”

Su Ping looked at the Rain Ancestor coldly.

The latter took a deep breath. “How do you want to end this?”

Both of them were top experts. They had already weighed the pros and cons, and their speech was very concise.

“Half of your territory,” said Su Ping coldly, “Or your clan will be destroyed!”

The Rain Ancestor said gloomily, “You have to protect humans, too. I will destroy them if you destroy my clan, so we’re the same. After you transcend the tribulation and become a real Ancestral God, you must follow the rules and not wantonly invade other clans!”

“In other words, you don’t want to pay for anything?” Su Ping looked at him with disdainful eyes. “You made up those rules for the Ancestral Gods to follow, so you can abide by them. So far, I’ve only walked as a mere mortal, and I’ve only followed the rules of one

place.”

The Rain Ancestor frowned. He didn’t ask Su Ping what that place was, as he wasn’t curious about it and was too lazy to ask. He only said in a cold voice, “No matter what you say, you should know the consequences when you violate the rules. Since you’re practically an Ancestral God, let’s wipe the slate clean. The Rain Clan won’t trouble you again, and you should do the same.”

“Wipe the slate clean?” Su Ping smiled. “Only I get to say that. You attacked me first, and now you talk of peace after realizing that you can’t beat me? It just so happens that I need a new territory for humankind. The Rain Clan will offer half of its territory, or it’ll be useless, even if you beg for mercy when I raze the Rain Clan to the ground!”

“Ha. Come and try then.” The Rain Ancestor sneered. Although wary of Su Ping’s potential

—and knowing that Su Ping would probably be a troublemaker even after becoming an Ancestral God-rules were rules. Su Ping couldn’t violate them. Calling his ferocious beast backer would violate a taboo and all the gods would gather to kill the boy.

He would love to see that happen.

Bang!

Right when the Rain Ancestor turned around to flee-Su Ping condensed a sword and slashed furiously.

The dazzling sword aura reached the target in the blink of an eye.

The Rain Ancestor turned around all of a sudden, then used a green rain to block the sword aura, like a water curtain.

But the next moment… The sword aura tore it apart and struck his chest.
