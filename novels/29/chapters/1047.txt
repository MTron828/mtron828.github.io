Chapter 1050: Beaten Up

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Do you really want to do this?”

Bu Wanli was rather shocked, not expecting Su Ping to be so bad-tempered. He had revealed his Divine Dome Academy’s disciple identity, yet Su Ping was still unwilling to let him go!

The sole response to Bu Wanli’s question was the Little Skeleton’s instant slash. A black saber aura was launched, cutting through space and time as it reached Bu Wanli in the blink of an eye.

The two girls next to the young man changed their expressions and quickly dodged.

Bu Wanli narrowed his eyes in shock too. He had realized that the boy was Su Ping’s pet. While pets able to transform into humans were rare, it wasn’t too surprising that one of Lord Supreme’s disciples would have one.

However, it was beyond his expectation that the boy was that strong.?The law of time? What kind of terrifying pet is this?

The law of time and space had spread over in the blink of an eye, freezing and petrifying him!

Bang!

A silver shield suddenly flew out of Bu Wanli’s pocket and shattered the paused time and space. Once unrestricted, it rolled and turned into an energy cover that shrouded Bu Wanli.

Bu Wanli finally woke up from that pause thanks to the special protection. Shocked and infuriated, he quickly threw a punch with blue flames popping up from his body. Unusual patterns surfaced on his skin, indicating that he had a notable constitution. Although it wasn’t as good to be listed as one of the ten best constitutions, it wasn’t any less powerful.

It was then that a saber aura containing all sorts of laws cut down, causing ripples on the energy shield, which nearly crumbled.

Before Bu Wanli could react—the Little Skeleton approached him again and cut for a second time!

The pet actually launched a third attack right when the second one was making contact!

On the other side—a dragon breath that contained destructive energy fell down like a comet.

Bu Wanli roared, and an ancient saber appeared in his hand. It was black colored, which carried an amazing power.

He used it to cut furiously, making the world echo with him. The projection of his small world was manifested in front of the saber’s edge. That was an ancient saber technique that harnessed a powerful annihilation aura, equal to a weakened version of the law of destruction.

Boom!

The Little Skeleton’s saber auras broke the energy shield and collided with Bu Wanli’s saber. At the same time—containing four supreme laws, the Inferno Dragon’s breath smashed down.

The void was trembling violently, and space began to collapse.

“Chaos!” Brutality emanated from Bu Wanli’s eyes. That was his ultimate trick, the law of chaos, which was one of the four supreme laws!

His law of chaos had already been perfected. It had the power to change the universe and reverse everything!

However, an opposing power moved toward him and crushed him like a scorching sun!

The young man also detected a familiar vibe from the saber aura and the dragon breath. It was precisely the law of chaos, and it had also been perfected!

“What the heck…”

Bu Wanli was instantly bewildered. His eyes widened with disbelief.

What kind of pet is that?

Bu Wanli’s skin was withering, due to the corrosion of the law of vitality. The energy inside his body was also quickly dying out, all due to the law of destruction.

His life source was soon affected by the laws, and his life was at risk.

Everything happened too fast. All of a sudden—a shadow flew out from Bu Wanli’s back and punched. Dazzling brilliance akin to that of an exploding star burst out in an instant, neutralizing all laws and energy.

However, the shadow became even vaguer after the attack, as if about to disperse at any time.

“Who are you?”

The shadow was an old man who stood in front of Bu Wanli with an awful looking expression. He was slightly relieved after seeing the environment clearly.?Good thing they’re not in the middle of nowhere. The Celestial Court is still a lawful place; we won’t really be in danger as long as I stall the man.

“Who are you?”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He realized that the old man seemed to be the clone of an Ascendant.

“This is the Celestial Court; you dare to fight here? Are you not afraid of getting killed?” demanded the old man.

“So you know where this is. And yet, you dared to insult Lord Supreme’s disciple in his territory. Are you not afraid of getting killed?” Su Ping flung the same words back.

“Lord Supreme’s disciple?”

The old man changed his expression and looked at Su Ping up and down. Soon after, he recognized Su Ping and exclaimed, “You were the champion of the last Universe Geniuses’ Contest, who then became Lord Supreme’s newest disciple?”

Su Ping didn’t reply, but his expression implied a positive answer. He was waiting for their apology!

The old man turned around and looked at Bu Wanli, who was pale-faced at the moment. Bu Wanli had cultivated in the Divine Dome Academy for thousands of years, and had already become a Star Lord. Still, a boy who had just reached the Star State had beaten him and even activated the Divine Mark clone he had left embedded in Bu Wanli’s body.

“Wanli was ignorant and offended you; it is indeed a mistake. I will punish him and ground him soon!” said the old man to Su Ping in a friendly manner.

“Why are you assuming that he offended me, and not that I offended him? Aren’t you being unreasonable?” asked Su Ping curiously.

The old man stiffened, then gritted his teeth in fury.?If you weren’t Lord Supreme’s disciple, you would have surely been the culprit here!

However, they had pissed off one of Lord Supreme’s disciples on the Celestial’s territory. No matter whose fault it was, they had to take the blame for the moment.

Holding back his fury, the old man struggled to continue, “I know Wanli very well. He’s always reckless. Just consider it as a favor for you. Just let it go, all right? I’ll ask Wanli to apologize to you later.”

“I don’t like later. He can apologize right now.”

Su Ping waved his hand generously and said, “He asked me to say that I’m a bumpkin a hundred times. So, I asked him to say it a thousand times. What do you think?”

The old man was dazed; he then glared at Bu Wanli. Of all people, he had to piss off Lord Supreme’s disciple on his territory.?Are you downright stupid?

But even though he was infuriated, his family would be fully humiliated if Bu Wanli were to say that a thousand times in public.

“You’re both geniuses; that was just an oral argument. Is it really necessary?” said the old man, “I’ll ask Wanli to personally visit you and apologize…”

“Hold on,” said Su Ping coldly, “Do you think he and I are the same?”

“…”

The old man was dazed; he nearly choked with fury upon seeing Su Ping’s cold expression. Bu Wanli was the top genius in his family, and the future prosperity the whole family looked forward to. And yet, Su Ping didn’t even think he could compare to him?

Even though he’s Lord Supreme’s disciple, he’s still too arrogant!

“I want neither compensation nor visits; you’d only make my house dirty. A thousand times. No discount. Just tell me whether or not you agree; if you don’t, I’ll beat him up!” Su Ping appeared barbaric and unreasonable.

The old man’s face was blue and pale. He was an Ascendant State expert anyway, and yet Su Ping didn’t show him any face. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, that was the Celestial Court and the elder wouldn’t really dare to do anything. If he really attacked Su Ping, he would probably be ripped apart by Lord Supreme the next second.

“You! You!”

Bu Wanli trembled with fury due to Su Ping’s arrogant declaration. However, remembering the horror felt in the recent life-and-death moment, he ultimately chose to not say anything.

Without further ado, Su Ping simply gave the order. “Humph. Do it!”

The Little Skeleton and the Inferno Dragon were going to step forward, when the old man changed his expression and quickly said, “Do you really want this? We’re willing to apologize, but…”

The Inferno Dragon and the Little Skeleton simply ignored him and attacked Bu Wanli.

The old man was going to help, but he heard a snort. His expression changed, and his body became a lot vaguer, nearly falling apart. He looked pale and scared, no longer willing to move.

Bu Wanli hurriedly cried for help once he saw that the two horrifying pets approached him again, but the old man remained absolutely still.

Bu Wanli was soon covered in blood under the Little Skeleton and the Inferno Dragon’s beating, despite his resistance; even his limbs had been broken. Although he could heal himself with medicines, he looked quite miserable at the moment. He moaned on the ground, overwhelmed by pain.

“Humph!”

Su Ping clapped his hands and summoned his two pets. He then said to the golden-armored senior, “He’s all yours. He wounded someone else for no good reason. Arrest him!”

The old man felt dazed, not expecting that Su Ping could suppress and beat up a student of the Divine Dome Academy with nothing but two of his pets. They didn’t need to help at all.

His lips twitched when he heard what Su Ping said.?Who was the person that wounded someone else here?

However, he didn’t really sympathize with Bu Wanli, as Su Ping could have killed him for what he had done.

Su Ping dropped the matter after the middle-aged man accepted his request, since it had just been a minor incident for him. He asked the Little Skeleton and his other pets to leave with him.

Up in the sky—the two girls who had stepped aside earlier looked at each other in bewilderment. They stared at Bu Wanli, who was moaning now and then, although he was gritting his teeth to hold back the pain, and found the situation unbelievable.

“He’s so unreasonable!” said a black-haired girl in a low voice, frowning. It was obvious that she didn’t like Su Ping’s behavior. The man had beaten Bu Wanli too hard, and for a mere verbal insult.

The other girl, however, didn’t say anything; she simply shook her head and said, “Let’s go. We don’t want to ruin our business.”

…

Su Ping wandered in the Celestial Court; he had been too busy cultivating to appreciate the scenery.

He was almost dazzled by the wonders he saw as he made his way and approached the Celestial Court’s central area.

All kinds of rare pets were available. There were also secret techniques, valuable treasures, and the latest technological products developed in the Federation. Many of them were made for pets.

For instance, there were virtual pet clothes. Pets could be sent to a virtual world, where all sorts of attires and equipment could be applied to them. That was intended for girls who loved dressing up their pets.

This place is paradise as long as you have money.

Su Ping had conflicting feelings while he wandered about and watched.

He was even more determined to move his parents to that place.

He finally sped up after roaming for an entire day, and went to his master’s palace.

“You’re finally willing to come back.”

Inside the magnificent temple—Shen Huang was majestically ensconced in his throne.. He looked down at Su Ping with a smile.
