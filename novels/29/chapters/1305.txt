Chapter 1306 Not To Be Peeped at (1)

Su Ping and Chan Gong entered the battlefield together. The former landed slowly under the young-looking elder’s encouraging gaze.

The previously noisy battlefield fell quiet with the human’s arrival, like someone pressing the mute button.

Everybody stared at the two unparalleled geniuses.

One of them was a Dao Child and a prince from one of the seven greatest families, while the other was a human genius who had recently become notorious for angering the Rain Clan.

The silence gradually felt depressing. Chen Xi observed Su Ping in silence before he opened his mouth shortly after; his voice was warm and instantly defused the intense atmosphere. “I heard that you defeated Qing Mu and cut his chaos world tree. It was so, right?”

“I heard that you also defeated him,” said Su Ping.

Outside of the battlefield-Qing Mu was speechless.

Just start fighting already. Why’d you have to keep bringing me up?

Chen Xi said with a casual smile, “They said that you’re extremely arrogant. I thought you would pick Qian Hong or Shen Mo; however, you picked me in the end. Looks like you’re also careful and cautious; not all rumors can be trusted.”

“It’s said that you’re the weakest of the three Dao Children. It’s only natural that I would choose you, don’t you think?” said Su Ping.

Chen Xi pondered for a moment and said, “Understandable.”

“Good.”

......

The two talked like old friends. The audience was rather shocked, as they didn’t look like two people ready to fight.

“Then you must have gotten your hands on some information about me. Any solutions?” Chen Xi asked again.

Su Ping nodded. “I have never tried it yet. I hope it’ll work.”

“Let’s do it then.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chen Xi added, “I also hope to find out what kind of power is able to cut the power of condescension.”

His body started radiating ivory light while he spoke the last sentence, and a silver universe appeared behind his back. He instantly disappeared, then reappeared in a flash, right in front of Su Ping.

Bang!

Su Ping’s pupils contracted, and he took action in a hurry. However, an enormous force struck his chest, followed by excruciating pain. He instantly felt he was flung back.

Before he landed-Chen Xi made another approach, slashing with his sharp sword. Feeling the lethal crisis, Su Ping couldn’t help but roar, unleashing the power of chaos and the darkest domain. Intense darkness was swept out, covering a radius of dozens of kilometers with his body as the center.

Bang!

The next moment, Su Ping fell out of the darkness region and didn’t stop until after rolling dozens of times.

It all happened in a blink. A moment earlier, the two of them were having a nice conversation, while they already clashed the next. Su Ping seemed unable to fight back thus far.

“He’s so strong!”

“That is Dao Child Chen Xi’s power? I heard that his universe has the highest speed possible!”

“No wonder Qing Mu failed. No matter how strong you are, it’s useless if you can’t hit the enemy!”

All the people at the auditorium were shocked, as nobody had expected that the record breaking Su Ping would be so terribly suppressed!

They had anticipated a fierce evenly-matched battle, but one side had crushed the other!

Chen Xi stopped and stood quietly on the battlefield. “You don’t seem to have a solution.”

Su Ping rose from the ground; his sword wounds had already healed. While looking at the elegant young man, he heaved a sigh and said, “You’re indeed fast. I can’t sense nor be prepared for it!”

“Before you admit defeat, can I experience that power of yours?” Chen Xi looked at him.

Su Ping nodded. “You will surely experience it before you lose.”

“Huh?” Chen Xi frowned. He was clearly

puzzled.

Su Ping didn’t say anything else; he simply closed his eyes.

He remembered the countless battles in cultivation sites where he defeated those who were far stronger than him, and who were too fast for him to keep track of. His body returned to its original state; all his cells were tightly connected. His mind went blank at that moment.

Chen Xi took action again, noticing how Su Ping was standing with eyes closed, as if preparing for something. Although he sounded courteous, it didn’t mean that he was merciful.

Bang!

Almost instantly—when Chen Xi’s sword was about to cut Su Ping’s neck-another sword appeared out of nowhere and flung Dao Child Chen Xi’s sword away.

The great power of that clash made Chen Xi’s sword hum nonstop.

“Huh?”

Chen Xi slightly changed his expression. He blocked it?

Was it luck?

A storm of swords enveloped Su Ping, determined to mince him. However, right when they appeared, a sword emerged like a crescent moon and moved with an unstoppable aura.

Countless sword auras disappeared all of a sudden. Chen Xi moved and dodged the sword, but his attack had been resolved by Su Ping.

Whoosh!

He raised a hand, and his body turned into hundreds of shadows to attack Su Ping from all directions.

Su Ping stood where he was, but his upper half was moving quickly. He countered all the incoming shadows. Sword against sword, he shattered all of Chen Xi’s attacks.

Whoosh!

Chen Xi returned to his original position, his face not as relaxed as before while he stared at Su Ping.

The speed feature of his universe was the greatest reason why he defeated Qing Mu. However, his power had been countered by Su Ping!
