“Thank you, sir.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Su Ping looked forward to it.

The Chaos Perception Dragon wasted no time talking, and simply took Su Ping to see the Divine Eye, where golden power was flowing out like a golden river of sticky magma.

The surging divine power in the river gradually dissipated and was spread in the entire world of gods.

!!

The Great Dao in the world of gods took that divine power to all places.

“The divine power is like blood,” said Su Ping with mixed feelings.

“The universe is a life form by itself,” said the dragon, “It’s just that most species’ definitions of life are too narrow. Most define flowers, grass and trees as non-living creatures. Some of the other species think that rocks, rivers and clouds aren’t alive. However, they are all living entities born from the Great Dao. They are simply different beings.

“For example, lightning dies the moment it’s born. Its whole life takes place in that brief moment.

“The wind gathers and disperses slowly. That’s the life of the wind.

“It is exactly because of the difference between life forms that most species can hardly understand each other. However, if observed from a higher perspective, you’ll realize that most things are alive.

“In the long history spanning billions of years, even some of the powerful species can only glow for a moment, just like lightning does.

“Some species live long lives, so they despise short-lived existences and don’t consider them as being alive. However, even those powerful species are simply repeating the same moment until they die. Lightning, on the other hand, reveals the most brilliant side of its life during that one moment, even though it dies quickly. It doesn’t need any extra longevity.”

Sa

Su Ping felt dazed. That was the first time that the Chaos Perception Dragon had said so many things to him.

The universe was a life?

The difference in life…

Su Ping suddenly thought of his Dao Heart. Different lives tended to reject each other; the contract was actually a power able to connect different lives.

It allowed them to listen to each other’s hearts and experience each other’s feelings.

If the universe is a life… Su Ping instantly felt goosebumps all over his body. His Contract Dao Heart could control other lives, the Great Dao and even the world to borrow their power. Were they all alive?

Since they were alive, could he make contracts with them?

He suddenly remembered that the system said that everything could be trained.

Su Ping didn’t expect that the idea of “everything’ entailed such a big scope!

Could the Great Dao and the universe be trained too?

If they were both alive, they could be trained!

Wait, the young Chaos Beast is exactly a creature born in the Great Dao during the age of chaos. In simpler terms, it is a manifestation of the Great Dao! So, the Great Dao truly is a life form and can be trained. The same goes for the universe…

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, feeling his horizon broaden with a new realization. I can build up my universe by training… The Undying Universe… A lot of ideas occurred to him, vaguely finding the way to become an Ancestral God.

The system, which loved peeping into his heart, didn’t reply to any of his thoughts, which further assured that his guess was right.

“The gods, who claim to respect and love all lives, only respect and love lives that they’re biased for. The ones they are against aren’t even defined as lives by them, and are seen as dead. The hypocrisy!” said the Chaos Perception Dragon.

His contempt for gods was evident.

Su Ping gave a slight nod. He had a deep understanding of the gods’ arrogance, which was ingrained bone-deep and couldn’t be changed; just like every species had its own bad attributes.

“Let’s go. I’ll show you the real look of the Divine Eye,” said the dragon.

He then turned around and ordered the demonic ape, “You stay here.”

“All right, Boss.” The creature seemed to be extremely obedient at the moment. His boss was almost killed by the six Ancestral Gods that the guy unwittingly guided over, so he feared that his boss would eat him in a fit of fury. He only wanted to make up for what he did.

The dragon shrank its body size and led Su Ping into the Divine Eye.

The strange loss of gravity was felt, followed by the feeling of passing through a thin membrane. Su Ping was surrounded by abundant divine power. He wasn’t too surprised, being his second visit. He simply examined the place and followed the dragon.

The Divine Eye’s surface was a boundless ocean of divine power. Cultivating there was more effective than cultivating in any of the holy lands in the world of gods.

The rise of the seven greatest clans was exactly because each controlled a Divine Eye. They had ten times more elites than the other clans did.

Su Ping reached a dark area after passing through the ocean of divine power. The place was extremely deep, and not much divine power could be sensed. He seemed to have entered some ruins.

He couldn’t even sense other times and spaces there. It was a simple, barren and desolate region.

“Down below is the core of the Divine Eye, and the real source of the artifact. Be careful,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon.

Su Ping’s eyes narrowed.

Their bodies kept sinking. Su Ping sensed the pressure building around him. There seemed to be something at the bottom of that passage.
