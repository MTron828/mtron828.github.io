Chapter 762: Law—God of Lightning

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I caught one, but it only has a C+ aptitude,” said Mia helplessly.

She had indeed caught one and tested it on the way back; she was secretly happy when she learned that it was a C+ beast.

After all, most of the wild beasts caught were Class C; the C+ beasts were the best among them. They could reach a B- Class after some minor training... If a master trainer was hired, it wouldn’t be hard for them to raise the pet to a B+ Class!

However, she heard news about the ten Class A dragons as she was making her way over to Su Ping’s shop to have her pets trained.

Class A... That was something that she could only dream about.

Buying a Class A pet would have been much easier and less time-consuming than training one!

Still, it would definitely cost more money!

“All the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons I caught were sold out,” said Su Ping, “If you have one, you may consider training it. After all, improving it to Class A isn’t that hard.”

Filius was speechless.

Do you even hear what you’re saying?

Improving a pet to Class A isn’t that hard? Just like how a certain big shot had said that making ten billion was just a small goal?

Mia was quite shocked, too. She couldn’t help but ask, “Boss Su, you sold all the dragons you caught?”

“Yes.”

“All of them...”

Mia’s eyes widened. She had seen three of Su Ping’s dragons when they last met. Could it be that all three had Class A aptitudes?

She couldn’t have felt more regretful. She would have had a chance to buy one if she would have returned to his shop right away, but she missed the chance.

She was rather angry with herself.

That was all because of her being overconfident. How could a keen-eyed pet store owner catch random beasts?

Why didn’t I think of this earlier?

But regretting it was pointless. Mia looked at Su Ping and asked, “Boss, when are you going to the Rumbling Thunder Continent again?”

She wanted to go with him. Missing a chance could be due to carelessness, but missing it again would be downright stupid!

Su Ping shook his head and said, “I don’t plan to go there for the time being. Maybe later.”

What Su Ping said made Mia think he was unwilling to reveal his schedule. She secretly heaved a sigh, but she understood that it was dangerous to expose one’s schedule to a complete stranger.

“Do you have other Class A pets in your shop, boss?”

“Not for now.” Su Ping didn’t know what to say about her stubbornness. “Don’t you have a Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon? Even if it wasn’t born with Class A aptiture, it can be trained to reach it. Why do you insist on buying a Class A pet?”

“It can be trained to that level?” Mia was stunned.

“As long as you have enough money,” said Su Ping, “It just so happens that this shop has just begun to offer the king-level professional training today. One training session will cost ten billion. Your pet’s aptitude is guaranteed to reach Class A. Do you have the money?”

“For real?”

Mia gazed at him and suddenly exclaimed in delight, “I want to train it! As for ten billion... I have the money!”

She didn’t have so much cash in hand, but she could borrow it.

She thought of a certain person.

Su Ping nodded and said, “Everything is fine as long as you have the money. Prepare it and come back early tomorrow. There are no more openings today.”

Mia was about to take out her Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon, but was then dumbfounded by what Su Ping had just said.

She had previously been able to train however many pets she wanted in Su Ping’s shop, but now she had to wait for openings the next day?

Filius was quite relieved; he looked at Mia sympathetically when he noticed how Su Ping treated such a gorgeous woman exactly like he treated him.

“I’ll come early tomorrow morning then,” said Filius.

Mia noticed Filius and heard what he said. She didn’t know what to say. It seemed that she wasn’t the only one who wanted Su Ping to train their pets.

Has the shop become this popular in a single day?

It did make sense.

Considering the training results from the shop, and since it had sold ten Class A Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons in a single day, it was only natural that the shop would become popular.

She felt frustrated; she would have returned sooner had she known this.

“Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow morning.” Mia heaved a sigh inwardly while offering a graceful smile to Su Ping on the surface.

Su Ping nodded.

Once he saw the two customers off, Su Ping closed the shop, then found Tang Ruyan and Zhong Lingtong in the language school.

“How’d it go? Have you picked it up?”

“We’ve learned about eighty percent of the Common Tongue, except for the uncommon words.”

Both Tang Ruyan and Zhong Lingtong were happy to see Su Ping.

Su Ping nodded. He spoke in the Common Tongue to test them. Seeing how they answered fluently, he said, “Keep on learning, and return to the shop to help me tomorrow.”

The large number of customers called for assistants.

Tang Ruyan asked in surprise, “Do we have many customers?”

“More than many.”

“Got it. I’ll work harder.”

“Me too!” Zhong Lingtong added cutely.

Su Ping nodded, said his goodbyes and returned to his shop.

He closed the door and ignored the reporters who tried to swarm in.

That was a completely new batch of reporters. He wouldn’t have time to do anything else if he took interviews every time.

Once inside the shop, Su Ping checked the energy revenue made in the day.

They were more than 380 million!

He had earned more than three hundred million energy points in a single day, which meant thirty billion astral coins!

Cleo’s professional training had produced ten billion; the ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were sold for sixty billion, and the normal training for the other customers raised a sum of more than twenty billion!

However, there was still a lot of work to do.

The pets had to be trained in different batches, and the professional training would take days. Even if he took the pet every time he trained others, it would be hard to improve its aptitude to a high level simply by exposure to deadly experiences.

He also had to use herbs and special environments to strengthen them.

Alternatively, he could simply impart knowledge to the pet.

If he shared some of the power of laws with the pet, its combat ability would probably soar immediately, and its aptitude would soon reach a high level.

However, the power of laws was so precious that Su Ping preferred not to use it unless it was the only option.

I should eat the Thunder Ocean Fruit first! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Without further ado, Su Ping found the Thunder Ocean Fruit in his storage.

It was a purple fruit enveloped by lightning; it also had protruding patterns that looked like scars.

I hope I can understand the power of laws, Su Ping thought.

The fruit only promised an increase in the odds of a new understanding, but he had never been a lucky guy. He simply hoped that the eighty million energy points he spent on it weren’t a complete waste.

He quickly chewed the fruit and swallowed.

As he chewed the fruit, he felt how countless lightning bolts were bouncing inside his mouth. Had it not been for his high resistance, he would’ve been paralyzed or even blown up by the lightning.

The bouncing lightning bolts ran amok inside his mouth like snakes; Su Ping had the strange feeling that the lightning bolts were alive!

He sat cross-legged and closed his eyes to chew and then swallow the lightning bolts, bit by bit.

The lightning bolts slithered inside his body like perky loaches. Su Ping felt that all his cells and blood were being activated.

He had an epiphany at that moment.

So, lightning didn’t just mean destruction; it could also bring forth new life!

New life from destruction!

Some of the bolts roamed all the way up and reached his brain while he was in a trance. Then, his head felt as if it were exploding; countless jumping lightning bolts surfaced in his memory and gathered in the most profound ocean.

That ocean was flooded with lightning.

The lightning bolts were either exploding, rumbling, vanishing, or circulating... They were boundless and had various shapes.

So, the lightning bolts had that many variations!

Su Ping’s mind was gradually absorbed by those concepts.

...

A long while later.

Su Ping opened his eyes.

Real bolts of lightning jumped out!

Fizz, fizz!

There was a lightning bolt in Su Ping’s palm, bouncing and shrieking like a bird. The lightning flew away from his palm and floated in front of him, without disappearing.

The lightning emitted a special aura, which was the power of laws!

While the energy from the lightning was weak, the power of laws was making space tremble, as if it could tear apart the primary space with ease!

This lightning is alive...

Su Ping gradually understood as he observed and thought, Infinite circulations, and birth from death, like the god who created the world. Let me just call you the God of Lightning’s Law.

The lightning seemed to hum and tremble after receiving a name; the power of laws that it released was even more profound.

Su Ping also emerged from his meditative state. He knew that he didn’t really comprehend and grasp that law until he gave it the right name.

Naming it incorrectly would mean that he hadn’t really understood the law properly, which could then gradually disappear in the end.
