Chapter 663 A Beast King at the Fate State

One man to change the situation!

Su Ping’s appearance had turned the tables. That was beyond anyone’s view of legendary battle pet warriors.

It turned out that a legendary battle pet warrior could be quite horrifying!

That man was worthy of being called a legendary battle pet warrior!

He was a legend!

Whoosh!

Su Ping didn’t stop after killing those beast kings. He flew to the surrounding areas and discharged some bolts of lightning in the process, or launched sword attacks at the gathered wild beasts.

Those wild beasts-intimidated by Su Ping’s killing intent-started to run away. They gradually learned it was best not to stay together so that they wouldn’t be killed together at once.

The other battle pet warriors got their chance since the wild beasts were running in different directions; they charged at the wild beasts.

The five legendary battle pet warriors were less burdened thanks to this effort. They could then go and fight the lone beast kings or give support to other battle pet warriors.

As such, the situation gradually improved for the human side. Humans turned defense into offense while led by the legendary battle pet warriors!

“We did it! We’re winning!!”

“Come on guys! Don’t give those damn beasts a chance!!”

“Kill them all! Give me back my friends!!” “Give me back my niece!”

The war correspondents spread the news. The battle pet warriors felt their morale improve.

They had been suffering before that moment!

They had to watch their partners die!

They had to see their battle pets die, their companions even when they ate and slept!

It was then the time for revenge!

It was a time for retaliation! The battle drums were beating. The Sonic Elephants were chanting at the same time; those beasts were merely at the eighth rank but their chanting could inspire the battle pet warriors’ morale!

A group of Sonic Elephants forming a wall and chanting together could greatly uplift the battle pet warriors’ spirits! Of course, those chants would be useless when a dragon roared!

That was how terrifying a dragon could be.

As the Sonic Elephants chanted, the battle pet warriors shouted and charged forward, closing in on the wild beasts.

The battle pet warriors advanced and progressively defeated the wild beasts under the leadership of the legendary battle pet warriors.

Venerable the Blade was thrilled. He knew that calling Su Ping for help was the right choice.

Su Ping was even more powerful than he had thought. Even without Lord Nie’s help, Su Ping was strong enough to save a base city!

Even though he was also at the legendary rank, Venerable the Blade could not help but admire Su Ping.

He wondered how great his life would be if he could be like Su Ping!

Whoosh!

Su Ping ran through the battlefield and cleared a path. Many wild beasts were either killed or scared away.

The battle pet warriors gazed at Su Ping with admiration and respect. They ran past the dead wild beasts and charged deeper into the cluster of enemies.

They had to get their base city back!

That was one of humanity’s homes!

Is that a passageway to the deep Caves? Su Ping gazed at the place where the beast kings came from; it had at one point been the point with the largest number of beast kings; only some advanced wild beasts remained in that area, including many ninth-rank beasts, all because he had scared away or killed the beast kings. Beasts would usually be at high ranks, except for the cubs, to survive inside the Deep Caves.

More beast kings...

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He detected the presence of beast kings in the deepest part of the passageway. There had to be several beast kings hiding inside!

Whoosh!

Su Ping dived down from the sky like a fighter plane. Bolts of lightning were flashing in the palm of his hands; he lifted his sword and a ray of sword light cut open a path through the throng of beasts, leaving behind many pieces of flesh and pools of blood.

However, given the sheer number of wild beasts, more would move forward to fill in the gap. The white bones were gradually retracted and removed from his person.

Su Ping’s appearance was restored.

“Use Undead Enslaving!” Su Ping ordered.

The Little Skeleton stood by him tamely and its eye sockets were glistening in red. A profound mist of darkness oozed out from the Little Skeleton. What happened then alerted many people. The nearby war correspondents captured a close-up shot of Su Ping.

Su Ping was the highlight everywhere.

He was the person that could decide whether humans could win in the end!

“Is he the legendary battle pet warrior?”

“Handsome indeed...” “Is that his battle pet? It’s so small, and it looks just like any other skeleton. Is it actually a beast king?” “Look, the skeleton is about to do something!” Under the eyes of many, the mist of darkness began to spread toward the wild beasts. Whenever the dark mist made contact, the wild beasts would cry and there would be a noise like bones clicking together.

Many twisted beasts dashed out as the dark mist faded away. Those were all the beasts that Su Ping had killed!

Those beasts no longer had a pulse but their bodies were still warm. They could still bleed but they no longer felt pain. The twisted creatures ran toward the other wild beasts.

The entire horde of wild beasts descended into chaos.

The enslaved wild beasts carried with them a dark element; they were even more powerful than when they were alive. Besides, those twisted creatures weren’t afraid of dying. They soon caused a great number of casualties on the wild beasts’ side.

In the meantime, a door to the realm of the undead appeared behind the Little Skeleton!

That was the Little Skeleton’s most powerful skill. The pungent energy of death was being unleashed as the demonic door was opened. The battle pet warriors and wild beasts both felt a chill. It was as if the world would have been connected to an unspeakably horrifying place.

Roar!!

Many skeletons dashed out from the door soon after.

There were skeleton dragons with red eyes, fallen angels with dark wings, and some twisted creatures.

The ancient wolf skeleton warriors charged forth with their spears, carrying a power from the past.

The many wild beasts gathered in front of the passageway to the Deep Caves were crushed when the skeleton army struck!

Many of the skeleton warriors were equal to beast kings!

A rough estimate would be that there were over a dozen with beast king strength. The Little Skeleton could have summoned something even more terrifying if it were at a higher rank!

Overwhelming!

The wild beasts were falling like flies due to the skeleton warriors. The skeleton dragon, the fallen angels, and the other creatures were charging as if the area were deserted!

rea we

One man and one skeleton against all the wild beasts!

No one was able to utter a single word.

How terrifying!

That person is a god of war!

“Take care of this place. I’ll finish those that are still inside,” Su Ping said to the Little Skeleton. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Little Skeleton nodded with a dull look.

Su Ping teleported again and again; he soon reached the passageway into the Deep Caves.

He could no longer see what the buildings around the passageway were once like. The blocks of cement and steel were turned upside down. More and more wild beasts were coming out and some beast kings were hiding in some places, observing. The beast kings felt it as Su Ping moved closer. Soon after, some of the beast kings ran toward the deepest parts of the passageway!

They were running away!

They had surely felt the trail of killing Su Ping was leaving behind. The beast kings decided to run away since Su Ping was going their way!

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He decided not to chase the beast kings that were escaping. Killing all the wild beasts was too great of a task when done alone. Even when he finished off those wild beasts, there would always be more hiding in the Deep Caves.

Boom!

Su Ping wielded his sword. The ray of sword light landed on the ground and bang, the rocks rolled over and blocked the passageway. The wild beasts that were running toward the entrance were cut open.

Those wild beasts had strong vitality; their remains were still wiggling after being halved.

Some war correspondents hovering in the sky riding bird pets captured Su Ping on video as he blocked the passageway. They broadcast the scene all across the base cities... The other battle pet warriors were even more inspired!

The passageway had been cut off!

Those wild beasts were like rats in a hole!

Finish them!

The battle pet warriors were shouting loud enough to make the sky shake.

The wild beasts that were about to break into the human’s city had been being slain.

No more wild beasts came out from the collapsed passageway. The ninth-rank beasts would have been able to shatter the boulders blocking the opening, but no wild beasts had made a move.

The collapse was a signal.

It was a signal of danger.

Approaching the entrance would be dangerous!

Even the beast kings had escaped and gone back to the Deep Caves. Without the beast kings to lead them, the lesser wild beasts that couldn’t make it back to the passageway wandered close to the entrance, hesitating.

Some of the more scheming beasts had turned around and escaped.

“Huh?”

Su Ping suddenly noticed something as he hovered in the sky. He gazed into the distance.

Boom_!

The entire base city was shaking!

This startled all the people who were fighting. The quake was so strong that some battle pet warriors fell to the ground.

What is going on?

Earthquake?!

The battle pet warriors who had a more acute sense suddenly narrowed their eyes. They were shaking; they felt something terrifying.

Moo!!

There was a loud bellow, which resembled a mix between cow’s moo and a dragon’s roar. The center of the battleground had caved in. There was a team of hundreds of battle pet warriors that didn’t have time to run away. A pile of dirt pushed them up and then something in the cave sucked them in; they were shouting in misery. The next second, a huge thing—as massive as a mountain, covered with thick but soft dark fur-got out from the cave. Fate State?

Su Ping recognized that at once.

He could not believe that there would be a beast at the Fate State, which would be on par with the Otherworld Heavenly King. Still, it was still unclear which of the two was stronger. That being said, he was sure that this beast king was leading this strike!

If I hadn’t made the trip over... This base city would have been doomed...

I wonder how the other defense lines were doing...

Su Ping’s mind was weighed down.

He didn’t think the Xing-Jing Defense Line was an exception. Humans would suffer if there was a Fate State beast king on each defense line!

While Su Ping was considering that possibility, the behemoth suddenly let out a shrill noise that turned all the surrounding buildings into dust. The high pitch call echoed across the entire base city.

The many battle pet warriors gazed into the distance with fear.

Even some beast king pets were frightened.

As a matter of fact, they were the ones most afraid since they felt that the mountain-like beast king was overpowering!

Beast king pets were insignificant when compared to that monolithic beast. “What, what is that thing?!”

“A beast king at the Void State? No...”

The legendary battle pet warriors seemed to be wary and surprised.

The Starburst Dragon didn’t seem to be as intimidating. They felt as if a viper were licking the back of their necks, but they did not dare to move at all!

“Look. What, what is that?”

“Humans!” “Humans and beasts!!”

“Is that Lord Nie...?”

Soon enough, someone noticed that some figures were dangling on the vines. The legendary battle pet warriors focused their sights; they were appalled by what they saw.

It was Lord Nie and the others who had fled with him!!

Many fragments of beast king corpses were tangled in the vines. The beast kings had been torn to pieces, mostly leaving out their heads or internal organs, which made for a ghastly sight.

Venerable the Blade was startled.

He had thought that Lord Nie had run away. He didn’t know that a beast king had captured him!

Ambush?!

Venerable the Blade felt his blood freeze.

That beast king had surely been hiding outside the base city.

He would have been caught by the vines if he would have tried escaping with Lord Nie!

Whoosh!

Su Ping ran to the Little Skeleton. To be safe, the Little Skeleton also moved and closed the gap in the air, then merged with Su Ping. Since the wild beasts had been routed, the Little Skeleton no longer needed to babysit the area.
