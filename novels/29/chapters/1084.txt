“Well

Yu Jingze, Diaz, Elena and the others were astonished.

They had been aware that it wouldn’t be a simple game of rock, paper, scissors.

However, the auras they released and the laws around them had made them

feel a suffocating pressure moments before.

In terms of aura, Shuai Qjanhou was stronger; his perfect path made them feel

insignificant, as if they were looking at the cosmos.

Surprisingly enough, Su Ping was the winner in the end

Obviously, Shuai Qjanhou didn’t see it coming either. Although he didn’t try his

best, and he only used the perfect law of space and some other laws.. it wasn’t

enough to crush his opponent?

The clash was brief, but too many things had happened during that moment.

Both of them predicted their rival’s choices with the law of time, and made the

corresponding adjustments.

Their expertise on the law of time was similar, so they had to use other laws in

the end

Shuai Qjanhou gazed at Su Ping and quickly thought, Was there some law that

tricked my laws and senses?

He didn’t expect that he would lose.

Give it to me, junior brother,” said Su Ping with a smile.

It was a good thing he used the law of illusion, or it would have been

troublesome.

Diaz and the others were silent, not knowing what to say.

Who could have known that Shuai Qjanhou, who had cultivated for fifty

thousand years, was unable to beat Su Ping? Did he underestimate him?

Shuai Qjanhou was silent for a long time, and gradually became calm again. He

nodded and said, “Senior Brother Su, you are indeed extraordinarily gifted.

“You flatter me,” said Su Ping humbly.

He accepted the stone shield from Shuai Qjanhou’s hands; everyone had looks

of regret as they fixed their eyes upon the shield.

They wanted to compete for it too, but even Shuai Qjanhou had been unable to

beat Su Ping. They had been crushed by Su Ping not long before; it was

pointless to fight him again.

Su Ping examined the shield carefully, and detected a strange power that was

deeply hidden within; that was probably what made the shield so special.

Master left the shield for us, but he didn’t tell us what it was for. Was he not

afraid that we would fight for it? Or maybe. Did he do this on purpose, to see

how we would choose?

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

While the candidates from other forces were destined to be eliminated, many

of his senior brothers and sisters were bound to be eliminated too.

The law of the jungle couldn’t be better demonstrated in that trial.

Brotherhood and companionship were vulnerable in front of the true god’s

legacy.

Without any hesitation, Su Ping tried dripping his blood over the shield.

There was no reaction. Su Ping instantly condensed a mental mark and affixed

it on the shield.

The shield changed soon after, and all sorts of information was transferred to

him. The stone surface cracked, revealing the real shield which seemed to be

made of black metal.

I see!

Su Ping reviewed the new information and understood a lot of things.

The stone shield was an ultimate treasure, but it only applied to the central

continent, where it could be used for both navigation and self-defense!

It could protect him from the dangerous traps that other Celestials had

prepared!

By the way, god-level creatures were forbidden on the central continent. There

was a special law that would eliminate any god-level creature it detected!

It was meant to prevent the forces behind the candidates from replacing al

their pets for others with Ascendant cultivation. In that case, even the most

talented Star Lord would be crushed by the extravagant pet lineup.

If so, the trial would be a contest of pets, not one of the disciples themselves.

“Junior Brother Su, what’s this?” Jiang Si asked curiously, although using a

prudent tone.

Su Ping’s eyes were clear again. After seeing their curious looks, he smiled and

said, “This is an ultimate treasure for our self-defense in the central continent

It seems that there will be dangerous threats which will require the use of this

treasure

“So, the ultimate treasure is for our defense?” Everybody was surprised; it was

true that a shield was essentially made for protection.

still, even if it was an Ascendant State treasure, their master was surely rich

enough to give one to each of them.

To put it simply, this is a special Ascendant State treasure,” Su Ping said to

them, “Tt’s fine if our Ascendant State treasures are sealed in the central

continent. We’d better not unseal and activate them, or they will cause

disasters.

“As for this secret treasure, it won’t cause any harm even if it’s used on the

central continent.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

While deep in thought, Shuai Qjanhou said, “So to speak, the ultimate treasures

are part of a competition between Celestials.”

That is correct.

Su Ping nodded.

Yu Jingze, Diaz and the others were also pondering. Some looked at Su Ping

with suspicion, questioning what he told him. But they didn’t have any proof,

and could only trust him for the moment.

“Let’s go search for the tokens,” proposed Diaz.

“Let’s go,” Su Ping said straight off.

They quickly rose and dashed towards the nearest token.

Moments later, they reached the nearest token, which was the core of a fruit.

Thanks to the pet food encyclopedia he had gotten from the system, Su Ping

recognized that it was the core of a rare spiritual fruit from the ancient times.

Unfortunately, it was very difficult to grow such fruits. The core must have

been dropped there after the fruit was eaten.

Did their master do this?

Su Ping raised his eyebrows, feeling that it was a joke of the Celestial experts.

“Why does this stone look like a fruit core? Diaz picked up the token in

confusion.

The token had been guarded by a Star Lord beast, which was easily killed by

Shuai Qjanhou. He got the token easily.

The token looked like a purple crystal on the surface.

Su Ping smiled in silence.

“Let’s continue.

Soon after, they arrived at the second site.

Why didn’t Master keep all the tokens together? He knew we would enter

sooner than all the others Su Ping was quite curious, wondering why his

master had done that.

Did he want to pressure them?

Or, was he reluctant to cheat as blatantly?

The candidates of the other forces would fight for nothing if he would have

placed all the tokens and ultimate treasures in the same place.

Wait, in that case, those people might not fight upon meeting each other; they

might unite. It could become a threat if their alliance grows big and they find

that we have all the keepsakes...

Su Ping realized why his master had made such arrangements; he had feared

that they couldn’t resist the joint attacks of all the other candidates.

“I suggest we take five tokens for now,” said Su Ping.

“Why? asked Diaz in confusion.

Su Ping said with a smile, “We should at least give others some hope.”

The others were confused; wasn’t that kind of merciful act redundant in that

trial?

Shuai Qjanhou, however, agreed. “I think we should.”

Everybody else was stunned to see him agree; they frowned but didn’t say

anything.

They soon reached the fourth token’s spot; there they saw that three people

were searching for something.

They seem to know that a token is here. Did they acquire the intelligence from

somewhere?” asked jiang Si in confusion.

Yu Jingze said calmly, “Maybe. The Heavenly Lords backing them know our

master, who told them the information for old time’s sake. That explains why

Master didn’t put all the tokens in the same place for us.”

“I see.” Diaz was enlightened.

“What do we do about them?” asked Qjao Lusi, who had purple hair and golden

eyes.

Yu Jingze said, “What do you think? Master already returned the favor by

sharing some information. They’re just unlucky for having met us.”

Both Su Ping and Shuai Qjanhou were silent.

Their silence implied their conniving plans.

Soon after, all of them dashed forward.

The trio quickly recognized who the new arrivals were. Then, they realized

what had happened, giving way to shock and fear. One of them quickly said,

“Please, let’s talk nicely. We’re willing to back off.”

They had given up before the fight even started.

“Rot in hell!”

Shuai Qianhou, however, turned a deaf ear to their pleas and quickly took

action. The space around him was turned upside down, and the three men were

dragged toward him easily; they were about to be torn apart.

“We’re willing to back off, and yet you’re still set on killing us?

All of them were shocked and infuriated, not expecting Shen Huang’s disciples

to be that ruthless. They had pretended to retreat and disseminate the

message.

The trio was infuriated since Shuai Qjanhou had imprisoned them, all because

they were enraged. They released their battle pets and their own power.

All of them had consumed drugs and injected a special potion.

Their combat ability soared. Astral power erupted from them like flames.

Tattoos that looked like special metal veins surfaced on their skin.

“It’s the Federation’s Berserker Potion

That’s the Alloy Tattoo, a terrifying enhancement material with bad side

effects.

Yu Jingze and the others were knowledgeable enough to recognize the items.

Their expressions changed; they had never used such things because it would

affect their potential. That was a cost they were unwilling to pay

They’re members of the Amate family, from the Mordo galaxy,” Diaz frowmed

and said, “We must kill them as soon as possible. Their family is very

complicated.”

Everybody attacked, together with Shuai Qjanhou.

Su Ping also charged forward. He smashed forth with the Fist of Exorcist,

making the void quake.

“All external enhancements are bubbles!

Shuai Qjanhou took action; his hands squeezed, and the void exploded. Infinite

power of laws sprang like sharp stings; space then became twisted,

dismembering the three guys. It was useless to escape, no matter how

powerful their outbursts were.

The perfect law of space had infinitely lengthened the distance between their

powers and their bodies. However great the power was, it would be useless if it

couldn’t be transmitted to the body.

Only laws could be used to counter laws!
