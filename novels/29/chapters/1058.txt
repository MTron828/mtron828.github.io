Chapter 1059: Primordial Talent

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Okay.”

Su Ping accepted the arrangement.

Ji Xueqing didn’t waste any time. She gathered the laws that were currently dispersing around her and said solemnly, “Firstly, it’s a body movement technique that can help you escape from danger. It’s an ancient technique called Sun Chaser!

“This technique was acquired from ancient relics. It’s said that it was created by ancient giants who tried to chase after divine birds. Unfortunately, the technique is incomplete, as only the first part was found.

“Even so, it’s still a very sophisticated martial art. It wouldn’t be easy even for Celestials to catch up with you if they don’t use the power of their Divine Mark and their flawless paths!”

“The Sun Chaser?”

Su Ping was rather intrigued.?The Golden Crow was a way the sun was referred to, back in the primordial days. Is the technique related to the Golden Crows?

I should visit the sealed Golden Crow stars and get to know them better.

“The original technique set is in Master’s treasury, but I’ve made another copy with my Divine Mark. I’ll impart it to you right now. Try your best to grasp it,” said Ji Xueqing solemnly.

Su Ping nodded.

A crack suddenly appeared on Ji Xueqing’s forehead, just like a third eye; pure divine power began to spread from the golden, vertical slit. A stream of power was suddenly transferred to Su Ping’s head.

He instantly felt the influx of a colossal amount of information. While in a trance, he vaguely saw a shadow that was running, jumping and flashing.

Nothing but its legs could be seen as the shadow ran faster and faster. The legs became all there was.

They contain that many laws?

Su Ping was astonished.

That pair of running, jumping legs contained countless laws, which merely propelled them, adjusting them and even changing the environment to accomodate their movement.

Su Ping gradually became fascinated.

He saw the running man again as the trance continued. The man was glowing brilliantly as he rushed across mountains, rivers and plains. He crossed the end of the world and stepped into space; he continuously ran in the void, which changed constantly as if voluntarily boosting his legs.

The wind, the air, space and time; everything was helping him run.

Su Ping was deeply astounded.

He didn’t know laws could be used in such a way!

When that man ran, the entire world seemed to be helping him!

That man looks rather familiar…

Su Ping had an odd sensation of familiarity as he saw that man, which puzzled him. The man had to be the technique’s creator, who had died millions of years before. It was impossible for Su Ping to know him.

Wait a moment, his fists…

Suddenly, he saw the man’s upper half. The man was waving his arms too as he ran. Su Ping felt a greater sense of familiarity when he saw those gestures.

Su Ping suddenly woke up.

He realized why he thought it was familiar: he had seen the man when he practiced the Fist of Exorcist.

The Fist of Exorcist was a boxing technique given by the system; he had only cultivated it to the third level. Since his swordsmanship improved, he had preferred to kill his foes with his sword from then on. He had melded features of the boxing technique into his sword techniques, no longer spending much time on the Fist of Exorcist itself.

After all, he only needed one ultimate skill.

But, he had seen the illusions left by that man when he practiced his technique.

He punched fiends and chased after the sun… He must have been invincible when he was alive, right??Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He felt sorry that such an extraordinary figure had also disappeared in the river of time, and his name had been forgotten.

But—

There was also the possibility that the man was still alive, but the world he lived in was in all likelihood far removed from the Federation.

While we’re on this subject, how far is the universe governed by the Federation from the worlds listed in the system??The idea popped up in Su Ping’s heart. He immediately asked the system in his heart.

“I’ll tell you when you reach the Celestial State,” replied the system lazily.

Su Ping rolled eyes in his heart. “Are you going to entice me with some legacy too? Being the system, you should be ashamed. If I were you, I would’ve given myself an Ancestral God’s legacy. That way I could guarantee that my store would have branches throughout the universe, and you could do anything you wanted.”

“What an excellent dream. Just go back to bed; maybe you can continue this dream,” said the system with a snort. It did not mince words.

Su Ping spat, no longer wanting to argue with the system; after all, it was unlikely for him to win.

He dropped all distractions and focused on grasping the technique.

He was quick to learn something from the man’s legs, possibly because he had already seen the man practicing the Fist of Exorcist and found him very familiar.

The Fist of Exorcist allows me to suppress everything, destroying all laws and paths with invincible power.

This Sun Chaser technique, however, uses laws and makes everything in the world serve me, aiding my body in reaching the perfect status to travel across the universe.

The first part of the technique already shows a fantastic usage of laws. I wonder what I’ll be able to do if I completely grasp the technique.

Su Ping couldn’t help but admire that ancient senior, as there had been countless geniuses throughout history.

It would be a lifelong pleasure if I could meet those talents in the cultivation sites,?Su Ping thought.

Facing Su Ping—the Divine Mark on Ji Xueqing’s forehead was already gone.

She thought that he had reached a bottleneck, seeing the constant change of facial expressions, ranging from confusion to anger. She smiled and said peacefully, “Take your time. I won’t be a nuisance; just call me if you need anything. You still have twenty-five years left for your cultivation. I hope that you can master this body movement technique in ten years.”

Su Ping opened his eyes. Then, he saw that Ji Xueqing had stood up and then disappeared with a smile.

“Ten years…”

Su Ping was rather lost for words; he had only cultivated for a dozen years in all his life.

The body movement technique was wondrous, but the core of it had to do with the usage of laws anyway. He had a complete grasp on his strength thanks to the life-and-death tests he had gone through, and thus he could make use of any law. Now that he had a teacher, he merely needed to imitate the teacher in order to grasp the Sun Chaser technique.

Su Ping didn’t waste his time. He shook his head, then fully devoted himself to the Sun Chaser technique.

Many laws were manifested around his body; they were arranged in different order to carry out their distinctive features.

Time flew.

Ten days later, on the mountaintop.

The peak of the mountain had already been flattened by a man running back and forth. He was fast and unpredictable, while being surrounded by many laws; time and space changed accordingly, seemingly helping him move as he sprinted. Both gravity and wind seemed to have turned into his wings too, accelerating his step.

Su Ping shook and paused all of a sudden, nearly falling off when he stopped. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It’s indeed harder than I thought. I’m not truly good at it yet.

Also, the key of this movement technique is sprinting…

Su Ping stood there and thought hard.

He resumed his practice a moment later.

His blurry shadows dashed quickly on the mountaintop; at moments there were hundreds of them. All of them were soon gone, and never reappeared.

“This guy…”

Ji Xueqing was watching from a corner of her small world; her plan was to mind her own business. However, out of all expectations, she saw that Su Ping was moving on the mountaintop only a few days after they parted. She didn’t think that Su Ping could grasp the technique that fast, no matter how talented he was.

It would be inevitable for him to be clumsy while he learned the technique; she was planning to record it.

She was delighted at the thought of keeping Su Ping’s awkward recordings for later, when he obtained the legacy and reached the Celestial State.

But then, she soon realized that something was wrong.

Although Su Ping wasn’t good at the technique yet, he wasn’t clumsy at all; his moves were actually agile.

Also, his moves improved with each time, evidently becoming faster!

Did he know it, or saw it performed before? Did Master show him the original copy of the technique?

Ji Xueqing was so shocked that she could not believe her eyes. However, that was her small world; she could see everything clearly, even with her eyes closed. There was nothing she could possibly miss.

She quickly found out what was going on: Su Ping had a crazy control over his strength!

He made use of all his laws one after the other. The features of those laws replaced each other at a quick speed. Still, Su Ping seemed to be quite at ease, not at all overwhelmed by the process.

“This guy…”

Ji Xueqing didn’t know how to describe Su Ping.

How many years has he cultivated?

Still, he had extremely precise control over his strength. He had consolidated his abilities really well, even though his strength was still improving at a fast pace, as if he would have cultivated for a thousand years!

Time went by one day after the other; Ji Xueqing finally abandoned her activities to stare at Su Ping every day; she watched him getting the hang of the technique at a high speed.

Two months later—

Ji Xueqing had to show up..
