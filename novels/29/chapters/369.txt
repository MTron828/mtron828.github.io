Chapter 372 Participation

“Don’t worry. It will be fine,” Su Ping said to Su Lingyue.

He told her the result at once.

Having known the result, the helplessness in Su Lingyue’s eyes disappeared. A glow of happiness and hope burst out from her eyes. She asked him a couple of more times to confirm the results and he nodded to her solemnly. She wasn’t sure, wondering whether he was merely comforting her. The dragon could indeed survive indeed.

“Frosty...”

Su Lingyue walked over and patted Frosty’s paws. “I will never ask you to do anything you don’t like anymore,” she said, feeling sorry and guilty

The Moonfrost Dragon’s breathing had calmed down. It nodded to her with a loving look in its eyes.

Su Ping was happy that the Moonfrost Dragon’s state had been stabilized. The next second, coldness came back to his face and killing intent to his eyes. Whoosh!

Whoosh!

In the meantime, two people dashed onto the stage to where Yan Bingyue was. It was Yin Fengxiao and Zhao Wuji.

They were worried and nervous. By the time they saw that Yan Bingyue had lost a hand, both were seized with astonishment which soon turned into wrath! “How dare you!”

“You bastard!”

Yin Fengxiao was hopping mad. Since the young man was still standing there with his back to him, Yin Fengxiao raised his hand and sent an energy hand toward him.

Roar!

Su Ping didn’t turn around. The Dark Dragon Hound had noticed the incoming attack. Angry, the Dark Dragon Hound bellowed and then discharged a ball of fire.

Bang! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

That ball of fire bumped into the energy hand, generating a shockwave in the air. The forces of the two strikes neutralized each other.

Yin Fengxiao had not meant to hurt Su Ping. He just wanted to get the young man’s attention and force him to turn around. He wanted an answer. Of course, he didn’t anticipate that the Dark Dragon Hound would jump out.

Yin Fengxiao darted a look at Xu Kuang in the distance with a gloomy expression on his face.

When Yin Fengxiao was about to make a second move, the three titled battle pet warriors from the government had already dashed to the stage after they noticed that things were spinning out of control. They put themselves in front of Yin Fengxiao.

The three of them were there to stop him. Recognizing their intention, Yin Fengxiao’s face became clouded. “Is this how things work in your Longjiang Base City, a titled battle pet warrior bullying a sixth-rank battle pet warrior? The big bully the small? Breaking the rules of the competition?” he bellowed.

The three titled battle pet warriors from the government worked out a bitter smile. They turned around and looked at the back of the young man in fear. The fact that the young man could crack the seal with one punch had filled them with dread.

The seal should be able to withstand a strike from a legendary battle pet warrior!

Of course, a true legendary battle pet warrior could destroy the seal beyond repair with one punch.

The young man must have exerted full strength when he punched out in fury. But the fact that a hole appeared on the seal was enough proof that the young man’s strength was very close to the legendary level.

He could be an old guy at the peak of the ninth-rank in a young man’s clothes!

He could even be one of the most powerful ones at the peak of the ninth-rank!

One of the three from the government tried to calm Yin Fengxiao down in haste, “Mr. Yin, this is an accident. Please, calm your anger. We have so many people here... You could dismantle the entire venue if you fought here.”

“He’s right. This is all a big misunderstanding. Let us do the talking for you,” the other one added.

Yin Fengxiao burst into laughter out of extreme anger.

Misunderstanding?

If it weren’t for the fact that the young man was too busy healing the dragon, he couldn’t even imagine what could have happened!

If Yan Bingyue were to die there, he would hardly absolve himself from the blame.

It never occurred to Yin Fengxiao that the three from the government—who had been extremely reverent and respectful to them and understood their background-would speak in the defense of that young man at the moment.

Were they worried about a possible battle breaking out between them, which could hurt the innocent people here?

Yin Fengxiao bit his teeth. He understood that if he were to fight the young man, the impact of their battle would probably destroy the venue.

Besides, the young man didn’t appear to be weak. The way the young man had cracked the seal with one punch was still visible in front of Yin Fengxiao’s eyes. This young man is a formidable character. Yin Fengxiao wasn’t confident that he could beat the young man.

“You...”

Yin Fengxiao took a deep breath, controlling himself and suppressing his indignation. “Tell me how you want to deal with the matter. Lady Yan has suffered an undeserved misfortune. You must give us an explanation!” Yin Fengxiao gnashed his teeth. The three from the government produce a forced smile.

They cast a glance at the family heads, hoping that they would come up and help mediate between two quarreling parties, only to realize that all of them were sitting there comfortably, as if none of it concerned them.

Those guys did crave nothing short of a nationwide chaos!

The three titled battle pet warriors from the government were having a headache. They only went there to stop the argument and sided with the young man because they knew that the young man was the boss of that store... or at least, the boss who had come forward to the public so far.

Something horrifying had happened in that store.

Information of that event was kept confidential and no one had dared to say a word about it. The higher-ups in the government were afraid that the store owner would blame them for leaking any pieces of information.

That being said, as titled battle pet warriors hired by the government, the three knew a thing or two. The theory was that there was someone formidable protecting the store and possibly a legendary battle pet warrior was involved.

That was why the three had to step forward and stop the fight. In the event of the young store owner and Yin Fengxiao’s party becoming enemies, whichever side met with a mishap, it would be a great disaster for the Longjiang Base City! “There’s no talking needed. Apologize. Debts of blood must be paid in blood!” Zhao Wuji said in a piercingly cold tone.

The three titled battle pet warriors darted a glance at Zhao Wuji speechlessly. Dude, can you not tell that the young man is at the peak of the titled rank, someone who can reach the legendary rank? Why would someone like him apologize to Lady Yan?

The three knew that Zhao Wuji was saying that to pressure them.

“Please wait here while I talk to him.” One of the three from the government worked up the courage.

Then, he quickly flew to the other side. While he was trying to approach the young man, the Dark Dragon Hound barked at him, treating him like an enemy.

The man stopped over ten meters away and said to the young man, “You... must be Mr. Su, the store owner. What do you think we should do about this?”

The man carefully phrased his words, feeling awkward.

If this young man were indeed at the peak of the titled rank, he would easily be subdued. After all, he was merely at the intermediate position of the titled rank; he had to treat the young man with respect.

As his voice faded away, silence fell for a few seconds.

Su Ping slowly turned around and cast an emotionless glare at the man and then glanced at the few people in the distance who were waiting for his reply. “What do you think?”

The man from the government shivered under Su Ping’s stare. With a bitter smile, the man said, “Well... since this happened during their match, Mr. Su, your intervention was against the rules.”

“Rules?”

Su Ling looked at him. “Did you comply with the rules when you wedged in a sixth participant, unplanned? Besides, just now, she obviously had the chance to win. She could have simply knocked Su Lingyue out to win directly, but she had to insult her opponent!” As he reviewed the matter, killing intent once again surged into his eyes.

In the distance, Yin Fengxiao and Zhao Wuji were shivering in indignation.

Su Ping showed no intention to apologize!

“Lady Yan joined as the sixth player, so what? She is qualified!” Zhao Wuji wore an angry expression. “If any sixth-rank battle pet warrior from your base city can compete with Lady Yan, we are willing for them to battle it out. If Lady Yan loses, we will resign!”

“Yes!”

Yin Fengxiao sneered. “Considering Lady Yan’s strength, if she would have gone through the entire process from the mass selections, more people would have been hurt by her. Our Lady Yan didn’t start there, and that had helped many participants avoid encountering a powerful opponent too early in the game! “We are practically giving other people a chance at the Elite League!”

The man who went to negotiate with Su Ping was in a difficult position. He looked at Su Ping; his expression basically said, ‘see, Mr. Su, they do make sense’.

“Is that so?”

Su Qing squinted his eyes. “Such being the case, let me join in the fun then!”
