Chapter 90: Meet Acquaintance

“Are you serious?”

“Do you know that, given your talents, joining any one of our teams can guarantee a monthly salary of over a million in the future? Aren’t you interested?”

Those people frowned with clouds over their faces. They had been arguing there for such a long time and it turned out that Su Ping claimed he had no interest. This was an opportunity that many so-called talents could never get in their lives and Su Ping had just turned it down.

Sitting on the couch, Dong Mingsong wore a strange look. He was having a deja vu kind of feeling. It was like the same thing that had happened just moments before...

Su Yanying didn’t know what words to use to describe her feelings right then. Su Ping had turned down the Vice Principal’s offer and had just refused the invitations of so many top-tier explorers’ teams.

He wasn’t interested in becoming a student nor an explorer. What was his interest?

Besides, Su Yanying didn’t understand what the explorers’ teams and the Vice Principal saw in Su Ping. The Lightning Rat had been trained in Su Ping’s store. However, it was evident that the one training the Lightning Rat was the mysterious master trainer working for his store. It had nothing to do with Su Ping, who didn’t train the Lightning Rat. It was unlikely that a master trainer could be this young. Could it be that those people were trying to approach that master by forging a relationship with Su Ping?

Wasn’t that too much of a trouble?

While Su Yanying’s thoughts were floating about, Su Ping gave his answer, “I am sorry. Please go and find someone else.”

Everyone looked at each other speechlessly as Su Ping claimed his refusal again. They were all frustrated. They had fought against each other for such a long time, but it was merely their wishful thinking. Su Ping had no desire to join them at all.

Since Su Ping had demonstrated his resolution, those people could only stop trying to persuade him. Besides, they were having some worries. Su Ping was young but he could escape from Frigid Brine. No matter how talented he might be, he couldn’t have learned this by himself. There had to be a powerful backer. Therefore, none of them were willing to risk offending such a connection.

“Fine.” Feng Baili sighed. Regret was written all over his face.

Ji Rongying stepped forward and handed Su Ping a card. “Here’s my contact information. You may not need this now but in the future, if you’re interested, you can contact me then. Our team will always welcome you.”

What Ji Rongying did reminded the others. They offered their contact information as well.

Su Ping accepted all their cards and said, “I will take my leave if you don’t have any other matters.”

Everyone smiled a bitter smile and let Su Ping go.

When he was about to step out of the office, Su Ping had an idea. He turned to Dong Mingsong and said, “You are the Vice Principal, right? Can you please do me a favor?”

“Eh?” Dong Mingsong did not expect that Su Ping would talk to him all of a sudden. A second of surprise later, Dong Mingsong asked, “What is it?” His eyes were glowing. Su Ping had asked him for a favor. The former would then owe the latter.

Su Ping went on, “Promote my pet store in the academy. Tell students that the Lightning Rat was trained at my place. Students that want to have their pets trained can come to my pet store.”

By luck, he had met the Vice Principal. This was the best advertisement opportunity, better than what the two minions under Su Yanying and Lan Lele could do.

Su Yanying was taken aback by Su Ping’s words. This man had cast his eyes at the Vice Principal? The Vice-Principal of a famous school, he was the professor and an eighth-rank battle pet warrior. The Vice Principal enjoyed fame and prestige in the entire Longjiang Base City. How could he help with advertising?

Dong Mingsong was surprised as well. He didn’t expect those words from Su Ping. What shocked him more was that, based on Su Ping’s words, he ran a pet store and that genius Lightning Rat had been trained there.

The explorers were just as baffled. Young as Su Ping was, he was the owner of a pet store? Was this a family business? Was that Lightning Rat honestly trained in his pet store?

Feng Baili thought of something. He turned to Su Yanying and asked, “What was the strength of your Lightning Rat like before it was trained?”

Su Yanying became nervous as he asked this question. She knew that Feng Baili valued her mainly because of her genius Lightning Rat. Being its master, she had some credit.

However, she was well aware that she had done nothing. Before she handed the Lightning Rat to Su Ping’s pet store, the Lightning Rat was just an average, low-rank Lightning Rat. But later on, the Lightning Rat had become a formidable being that had defeated a seventh-rank pet of the dragon family.

“Intermediate position of the first rank.” Hesitating, Su Yanying said the truth. Lying would not get her anywhere. Given the connections and powers the explorers had, they could find out about the truth easily. Besides... she was eager to know if her strength would be recognized by them without the credit of training the Lightning Rat.

“Middle position of the first rank...”

Everyone was surprised, which was followed by silence.

It was a rank common amongst average Lightning Rats. To train a Lightning Rat of the first rank into something that could defeat the seventh-rank pet of the dragon family... that wasn’t merely outstanding. It was unbelievable!

Not even a master trainer they knew could have achieved this!

They considered that the very best master trainers on this planet were incapable of this!

“Are you sure?” Feng Baili asked, being more serious than ever as he gazed at Su Yanying.

Su Yanying answered, “Yes, I am.”

A ray of light glistened in Feng Baili’s eyes. He said to Su Ping, “Well, now I have to call you Mr. Su. I wonder where your pet store is. I want to pay a visit.”

“Sure.” Su Ping took out the name cards he had prepared and handed them out.

Everyone took a name card and looked at the address. It wasn’t far away. This wasn’t a store at a prime location and the name was mundane. They had never heard of it.

“I’ll be going now,” Su Ping said after he distributed all the name cards. He could tell from their eyes that those people would pay a visit and might become key customers. He could make a fortune.

Dong Mingsong came back to his senses. He said at once, “Don’t worry. I will promote your store for you,”

“Thanks.” Su Ping took off after he expressed his gratitude.

The others saw him out and left as well. They had gone there for Su Ping. Since he had left, there was no need for them to stay in the office. As for Su Yanying, she had signed a contract with Feng Baili. As far as the other explorers were concerned, she was one of them already and further talk with her was unnecessary.

Everyone walked out of the corridor with Su Ping. Along the way, they would meet some teachers from this academy. The teachers would greet the Vice Principal and the explorers as they crossed paths. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Once they arrived at the first floor of the office building, two people headed toward them. Su Ping knew one of them. It was Luo Guxue. With her was another middle-aged teacher, and they were discussing something.

Sensing a huge crowd’s presence, Luo Guxue and the middle-aged teacher threw a glance. Luo Guxue looked up, and this one glance surprised her. She had to check carefully to make sure that she did recognize this young man.

“You are here.” Luo Guxue hurried over. Her voice was filled with pleasant surprise.

Su Ping nodded. “I came to watch the exhibition matches.”
