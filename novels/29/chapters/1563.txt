Chapter 1564: Core of Chaos
"So, the loser has to admit defeat in the end. Strength is what matters, right?" Sorcerer Ancestor Yin Que sneered.         

    

"I guess you could say that," said the peaceful Heavenly Dao with a smile.     

Su Ping suddenly intervened, "It's not an eternal world you want to build. You're only turning your own vision into a concrete existence; you're the one who's really infected. That is no longer the wish of the people. You have your own desires… This is just your own selfish thought!"     

The smile on the peaceful Heavenly Dao's face fell somewhat. He gazed at Su Ping and said, "He's the third challenger leading all the people to attack me, right? He looks much younger than the previous two."     

The Mother of Chaos said coldly, "He's here bearing the will of the people, and he's going to end your illusion with me!"     

"That is correct," Su Ping stepped forward and said in a cold tone, "You want fairness for everyone. But how can everyone get everything equally? You say that everyone will receive the same things you get. However, the most precious things in the world—except for the rare cultivation resources, money, wealth and power—are the scenes you witness and the people you interact with every day!     

"By your logic, when I see the sunset, others have to see the sunset, too. When I look down from a high building, others have to do the same. It would be unfair otherwise! There are 976 particles whenever I take a breath of chaos aura, and all the others have to absorb 976 particles too, or it would be unfair!     

"When I turn to one side and look at things, the others have to do the same, or it would be unfair!"     

Su Ping stared at the peaceful Heavenly Dao with blade-like eyes. "There won't be any living creatures in the world you want to build, only one kind of life. To be more precise, there will only be a single living creature! That's the only way to ensure absolute balance. If all creatures aim to achieve absolute balance, they must stay unified!     

"Without thousands of faces, only having thousands of people living the same life, it would just be one person, no matter how many they are!     

"This is just the manifestation of your own wish, not the wish of the people. You have violated the will of the people. You don't deserve to be called Heavenly Dao. You are an Evil Dao!"     

"Well said!"     Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Golden Crow ancestor couldn't help but shout, "Kun Peng, did you hear? The world he's heralding doesn't exist. There are no lives in that world, and you don't have a place in it, either!"     

Kun Peng's expression changed a bit as he looked at the peaceful Heavenly Dao.     

Before he could ask—his body trembled all of a sudden. Many sharp blades protruded from the peaceful Heavenly Dao and pierced through his body. Then, those sharp blades moved as arms and pulled him toward the peaceful-looking being.     

Kun Peng was shocked and furious. He revealed his true appearance and shrieked at the peaceful creature, "What are you doing?!"     

"It was just a matter of time. Since you have doubts, I'll just remove those doubts for you," said the peaceful Heavenly Dao, "You can't understand the eternity that I pursue, and you don't need to; since you're already sick, that is. You only need to disappear and leave a clean world of chaos behind."     

"Do it!"     

The Mother of Chaos quickly attacked the peaceful Heavenly Dao while the latter was absorbing Kun Peng.     

Both Yin Que and the Golden Crow ancestor shrieked and followed her, killing the Chaos Heavens that tried to stop them.     

"No need to bother with me. His original self is destroying the Chaos Core deep inside the Ancestral Land of Chaos. He's purposely delaying you here…" roared Kun Peng.     

The Mother of Chaos changed her expression. Everything would collapse once the Chaos Core was destroyed; all law and order would crumble, and they would lose all their power. They would all turn to dust once chaos perished.     

"System, you go first. I'll stop him!" said Su Ping.     

He rushed over, his body transforming into a magnificent mythical creature, as massive as the peaceful Heavenly Dao. Behind him were the experts of all species and the people from the cultivation sites.     

The Mother of Chaos had a contorted face. She could feel Su Ping's honest feelings, she knew he wouldn't be able to stop the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

Even if it was just a clone.         

    

"You think you can stop me? I'll show you how your predecessors ended!" The peaceful Heavenly Dao was cold. Part of his body turned into sticky fluid, completely covering Sorcerer Ancestor Kun Peng. There seemed to be countless strange mouths wriggling and biting. Kun Peng's furious roars could be heard.     

Another part of his body moved and attacked Su Ping.     

The latter instantly felt that his Chaos Qualification was somehow shivering in fear.     

"Die!" Su Ping roared.     

The experts of all species set up military formations in his warships. The people from the cultivation sites also charged at the other Heavenly Dao beings.     

It was impossible for them to participate in the clash against the Ultimate Heavenly Dao, or they would only turn to dust, dying as soon as they got any closer. They could only stop the lesser humanoids.     

The war that spanned through eternity was resumed yet again.     

Various species fought against the humanoids.     

The people from the Heaven Path Institute—led by Wen Tian and the other Ancestral Gods—formed arrays and killed several enemies in a row.     

The other high-ranked clans also fought the Heavenly Dao forces under the lead of their respective Ancestral Gods.     

The war stretched to infinity, battling and bloodshed everywhere. However, the gory images gradually turned into the background. It was the Sorcerer Ancestors and the Mother of Chaos who would play a critical role in that fight.     

They charged on the battlefield. Chaos collapsed wherever they passed and the void became even more desolate. Their true appearances and their universes were quickly displayed, exploding and turning into an unimaginable blast.     

Bang!     

A brilliant sword aura passed by. Su Ping merged with the Little Skeleton and the Inferno Dragon. Su Ping felt the power of three Chaos Qualifications inside his body. They were connected, bringing forth a terrifying power.     

His sword was much more powerful than before, seemingly ready to cut the entire Ancestral Land of Chaos apart. Its sharpness could be felt from light years away.     

The weapon contained so much Dao Power that it could invade memories and erase the target at a primary level.     

Anyone hostile to Su Ping would have a sword aura grow inside their heart and would eventually die!     

When the sword rose, it was unstoppable!     

The peaceful Heavenly Dao's body transformed into a cavity of sorts, moving towards the sword like a sheath and instantly swallowing it. The power on the blade was quickly shattered and dispelled.     

Su Ping changed his expression, not expecting such a powerful strike to be incapable of hurting the peaceful Heavenly Dao.     

This attack was so powerful it could have instantly wounded another Sorcerer Ancestor!     

A clone of the Ultimate Heavenly Dao was already terrifying!     

"The power of three Chaos Qualifications is truly interesting," said the peaceful-looking being with a smile. "However, they are just products from an old age. They will be gone when the Chaos Core is broken. Everything will be over soon."
