Chapter 130 Sold Out

Many of the students waiting to pick up their pets witnessed how the Wing Beast tried to demonstrate violence and how it had been subdued by Su Ping the previous day. Even the training of the Wing Beast was completed within a day.

Such being the case, their pets had most likely finished training as well.

The students waiting there gradually quieted down. They were feeling less nervous and anxious and stood in line in an orderly manner.

Su Ping returned their pets one by one and the queue was shortening.

The students that had come with doubts and anxiety were overjoyed to see the amazing changes in their pets. While relaxed, they circled back to the other queue to have their pets trained another time.

Su Lingyue stood by the door, dumbstruck.

She recognized many people, that young man with the Wing Beast in particular. They only came here yesterday. How could the training complete today?

The night before, she saw Su Ping locking up the store and leave without taking anything with him. He spent the night at home...

This was such a short time. In the day, he had to look after the store and attend to the customers. At night, he had done nothing. How did he train those pets?

She was overwhelmed with questions and yet she knew this wasn’t a good time to ask. So, she pressed down her curiosity.

At the same time, Su Ping had begun to accept new orders.

Just as before, Su Ping demonstrated no service attitude. Not one bit of his actions pointed at “the customer is king” philosophy.

His expression was cold and his tone was stiff. He just asked for the customers’ names and pets and told them to pay.

What kind of business handling is this?!

Su Lingyue was not a businessperson herself. Still, at the very least, she knew one had to smile at the customers!

As for Su Ping, he wore no expression, not so much as a fake smile.

Su Lingyue was dying to go there and remind Su Ping to correct him. The remaining trace of reason in her mind stopped her.

Then, she heard Su Ping announcing the price.

Was it 100,000 coins?

Su Lingyue was startled.

Is he robbing the customers?!

Training a pet costs 100,000 coins?!

What surprised Su Lingyue even more, was that the customer paid up without even so much as a thought.

...Did he just pay 100,000 coins? Su Lingyue was still in a daze. She was wondering if the man was paying with game currency. Since when could people squander away money like this?

How could he give away the 100,000 coins just like that? “Thank you, Mr. Su.” The student expressed his gratitude to Su Ping, handed over his pet, and left in buoyant spirits.

Su Lingyue felt her world view was being challenged.

Su Ping sent this shaking pet into the pet room and then returned to record information and collect training fees.

He had been working hard to streamline this process. However, half an hour later, the long queue had not shortened because more people showed up later on.

Su Lingyue had become immune to this scene. During this half an hour she was watching, Su Ping had pocketed several million coins...

Several million!!

That was so much money!

All of her life, Su Lingyue had regarded money as valuable. She would be happy for days when her mom gave her a few hundred coins as pocket money. At the moment, she felt the money was no longer money, but leftovers...

Su Ping was making money faster than a money printing machine!

Was this their family’s store at all?

Was this her loser brother?

“You are Su Lingyue, right? Do you want to have your pet trained as well? Why don’t you take my spot?”

A boy had been noticing Su Lingyue. She had been standing in front of the door as if she tried to cut the line but lacked the courage to do so. The expressions on her face kept changing. She had been there for a while without asking to cut in line.

The boy thought this was a fantastic chance. When it was about his turn, he immediately went to Su Lingyue’s “rescue.”

Su Lingyue came back to her senses. The glances darted at her made her flush. She said, “No, thank you.”

Then, she made up her mind, worked up the courage and stepped into the store, very natural and poised.

The other students were stunned to see Su Lingyue standing next to Su Ping. Was she cutting in line so brazenly?

Su Ping threw a look at Su Lingyue and said, “Stay away. I’m busy.”

Good job, Mr. Su!

Several girls at the head of the queue were delighted to hear Su Ping’s words. Su Ping could turn down Su Lingyue the school babe. Indeed, he was a strict and impartial teacher!

Su Lingyue was angered and ashamed because of the strange looks fixed on her. She glared at Su Ping and suggested, “I can collect money for you.”

Su Ping rejected calmly, “No need.”

And yet, Su Lingyue did remind him. The store’s business was doing very well. He was snowed under with work at the moment. He wished he could hire an employee.

The system seemed to have sensed Su Ping’s thoughts. “Employees must sign a pet contract with the host.”

Su Ping was surprised. In his mind, he asked, “Doesn’t that imply that the employees must be pets?”

“That is correct.”

The system continued, “Since this is a pet store, only pets are allowed here.”

“Oh.” Su Ping understood.

He found this explanation acceptable. At the same time, something didn’t sound right.

Since there were too many customers present, Su Ping didn’t have the time to overthink. He put down the names, collected money, and sent pets into the pet room quickly.

Su Lingyue was provoked by Su Ping’s words and many students misunderstood her because of his reply. She felt both embarrassed and furious. She wanted to explain that she was Su Ping’s sister but explaining was not in her nature. She swallowed back her words.

She went behind the counter and sat down, panting with rage. She turned around so she didn’t have to see those students.

She threw him a glare when Su Ping came back out from the pet room.

Su Ping cast a glance at her. If she wanted to hang out, so be it. He went back to his previous work.

Su Lingyue knew that nothing she could say would change the situation at the moment. She snorted at him. All of a sudden, she noticed the many items on the shelves. When she saw the price tags, she opened her mouth in astonishment.

If this store weren’t their family’s business, she would have declared it was a gangster shop!

Is Su Ping selling products or robbing people?!

Anything she cast her eyes on had a price of several hundred. Most of the items were priced at several thousand coins and quite a number were sold at over 10,000 coins. There was nothing sold below one hundred! Who are Su Ping’s target customers anyway?

She turned around and saw Su Ping still collecting money. All of a sudden, she didn’t know what to say.

Their family would have made a great fortune overnight if the business had been conducted as Su Ping did long before!

All of a sudden, she understood. At this rate, in one month, Su Ping would have made more than enough money to buy that Inferno Dragon!

Ten minutes later.

Su Ping came out from the pet room again. There was still a score of people waiting outside. He said to them, “All the spots have been taken. Please come back again tomorrow.”

The student who was ready to transfer the money was taken aback. He stared at Su Ping. “Mr... Mr. Su, what do you mean?!”

He never thought there were limited spots available!

Su Ping felt sorry for the student who had to go back home after queuing there for such a long time. However, the training space and the nursing pens had all been stuffed and the system didn’t allow for any pets to be retained in the store. He had no option but to repeat, “That is right. Please, come back tomorrow.”

Those still waiting looked at each other speechlessly. Since Su Ping had made it clear, they had no choice but to leave.

“Sir, I, it is my turn now...” That student was unwilling to give up.

Su Ping heaved a sigh. “Next time, come earlier.”

“...” The student didn’t know what to say. He left in frustration since Su Ping didn’t leave any room for persuading.

The long line outside the store disappeared gradually. Sitting at the counter, Su Lingyue could not stand this anymore. She went up and yanked Su Ping’s sleeve. “Why are you letting them go? All the spots are taken? There is still room here. You can make it work!”

Su Ping darted a glance at her grumpily. “Do you honestly suppose I haven’t thought of that? But I have my rules in the store. Okay. You have been here long enough. You can go home now.”

“No way. Didn’t you say that there are no more spots available? Show me.”

With that said, Su Lingyue went to pull the door to the pet room. However, the door was incredibly heavy. No matter how she tried, the door would not budge.

“Do not mess up my job. Go back and cultivate,” Su Ping dragged her away and cautioned her.

Su Lingyue never expected that she would be defeated by a door, which had astonished her. Su Ping’s words re-ignited her anger. She pouted and said, “Don’t think that I’m afraid of you just because you can defeat me. I wasn’t paying attention to cultivation in the past because I didn’t have any worthy opponents. From now on, I am going to work hard. Hmm, I will surpass you. Just you wait!”

“Good luck.” Su Ping flashed a false smile. Su Lingyue could sense his ridicule. She bit her teeth and stomped her feet in anger before she left.

Staying there would only be embarrassing for her. She had realized that without violence, she no longer had any other ability to win against her mean brother. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Su Ping was relieved since Su Lingyue had left. Finally, this piece of trouble was gone. He opened the pet room’s door, went inside, and pulled up the cultivation sites. He selected some pets and started the dummy training process.

While the dummy training was ongoing, he went back to the storefront to close the door.

Then, he pulled up the cultivation sites’ window again, selected the dragon king’s heritage ground, and went to explore the dragon scales with the Purple Python, the Inferno Dragon, and the Dark Dragon Hound.

Su Ping left the store closed for the rest of the day. He did nothing but train.

The result turned out to be outstanding.

Each round of the dummy training would last an hour. In total, forty to fifty pets were trained and those were all stored in the training space. Pets staying in the nursing pens were the remaining ones to be trained.

Apart from taking care of the customers’ pets, Su Ping had been staying in the dragon king’s heritage ground all day long. He went there seven or eight times and took a couple of hours rest.

The seven or eight times meant seven to eight days inside the cultivation site.

During those days, Su Ping explored over thirty dragon scale lands. Besides, the three pets went through transformative changes as well. They had all metamorphosed from infancy into youth.
