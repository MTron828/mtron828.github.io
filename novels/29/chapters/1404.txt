Emperor Que suddenly changed his expression. He looked at the people in front of his eyes with shock and fury. “What’s the meaning of this? Your Dao Child is causing trouble here, and you want to indulge him? Nobody can take him away today! He has to die! He must pay with his life for humiliating the Rain Clan!”

The elders of the Heaven Path Institute had just appeared in front of Su Ping.

The latter looked at Elder Chan and the other elders he was familiar with. Their sudden arrival shocked him, as he didn’t think he would be found that quickly.

“Emperor Que, allow us to say a few words.” The graceful woman who stood in front of everyone was none other than Elder Yan, whose yellow robe fluttered like a beautiful golden lotus. With coldness on her face, she said slowly, “It was indeed wrong for the Dao Child to do that. Can you let him go for the sake of the Heaven Path Institute? We’ll make up for it. Tell me what you want.”

“His life!” Emperor Que roared.

“You may ask for anything except the Dao Child’s life,” said Elder Yan.

Emperor Que was infuriated. He said, “What do you mean? You think the Rain Clan lacks anything? Like I said, he has to pay with his life today. You failed to raise him properly; we will demand your institute for a proper explanation after he dies!”

Elder Yan frowned. “The Dao Child is still young and reckless; I hope that you can give him a chance. Indeed, he embarrassed your clan today; I’ll ask him to apologize. You may ask for another compensation. How does it sound?”

She could tell that Emperor Que was dead set on killing; taking a humble approach was the only option.

Emperor Que’s eyes twitched after that response; he was even more infuriated and ready to kill, especially when considering the young human’s age. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The guy was only a few hundred years old, and he had already grown to become that terrifying. How could he be spared?

“Apologize? That is a given. I can only let this matter go if he kneels before the gate of the Rain Clan for 100,000 years!” Emperor Que sneered.

Elder Yan slightly changed her expression. “Emperor Que, we came with sincerity. I only wish you would be reasonable. He can’t kneel for 100,000 years; he is a Dao Child of the Heaven Path Institute.”

Emperor Que knew she was right; Su Ping kneeling would also be a humiliation for the Heaven Path Institute. He knew he had to somehow deal with the boy by separating him from the influence area of the Heaven Path Institute, or they would only argue back and forth.

“Apologize to all the members of the Rain Clan and guard our gates for 100,000 years!” said Emperor Que.

Elder Yan frowned and said, “Emperor Que, he can apologize, but guarding the gate is too outrageous!”

“You think that’s outrageous?” Emperor Que was so angry that he laughed. “He broke into our territory and provoked us. That’s not outrageous? The Rain Clan is a high-ranked clan; how could we ever tolerate such provocation? How will the other clans view our clan if he’s not punished?”

He stared at Elder Yan and the others. “Don’t think that the Heaven Path Institute can be unreasonable because you have three Ancestral Gods. You allowed your Dao Child to commit this folly; it is now time to bear the consequences! Our Rain Clan only has one Ancestral God, but he will surely defend our interests!”

Coldness was bursting out of his eyes as he spoke. “Do you intend to start a war between Ancestral Gods?”

Elder Yan and the others showed different expressions as they pondered. It was true that the Heaven Path Institute had three Ancestral Gods, which ensured its special status. However, they also knew that many clans envied that special status. Besides, Su Ping had indeed made a mistake; even if they asked the Ancestral Gods to protect the boy, the Rain Clan and the other clans would surely impose pressure on the Institute later on.

One had to resort to reason when it was impossible to win with strength.

That was the cruel and coldblooded law of the universe!

“Elders, this is between me and the Rain Clan. I hope that you won’t meddle.” Su Ping felt touched upon realizing what Elder Yan and the others were thinking. They were willing to pay a huge price, offending the Rain Clan for his sake.

“Dao Child, don’t say anything inappropriate,” said Elder Chan in a hurry, fearing that the human would add fuel to the fire.

Su Ping slightly shook his head and looked down at Emperor Que. “I, Su Ping, am responsible for what I did. I was the one who broke into your territory and killed your prince. You claim that my actions aren’t warranted… You conspired with the people of the Witch Mountain to curse me. It’s fine, even if you don’t admit it, it’s fine; those who are strong always get to explain. I’m here today to challenge all the God Kings of the Rain Clan!”

“Do you dare to accept my challenge?”

His words rumbled in the sky like thunder.

All the people in the clan’s territory heard it; their eyes widened in disbelief.

It had been years since the Rain Clan was challenged.

Su Ping is going to challenge all the God Kings in our clan?

Most of them were infuriated; how could they tolerate such contempt?

“He’s so arrogant. Kill him!”

“Accept his challenge!”

“Accept his challenge!”

The furious roars were gradually unified. Loud voices were echoing on every mountain; most belonged to the lowest-rungs’ cultivators.

They only knew that it was impossible not to accept the challenge of someone who had provoked them in such a way.

The God Kings in the Rain Clan, however, showed baffled expressions, hoping to mute all their voices.

Accept the challenge?

Why don’t you go fight him?

Didn’t you see that he smashed Emperor Que into the ground? He’s clearly a monster!

Although he was a God King, he was as strong as a God Emperor in terms of combat ability.

Any of them would die if they fought him!

“Shut up!”

“This is an important matter for our clan! Don’t meddle!”

Some God Kings suppressed the voices on their mountain, claiming that the matter was too important. The people present were placated and intimidated.

They didn’t suspect that the experts would not dare to accept the challenge; they only thought that there were more underlying complications to the challenge than what they could see.

Elder Yan and the others all felt like laughing by such a reaction, but they chose to restrain themselves. If they did, Emperor Que would probably go on a rampage.

What was that all about?

Su Ping issued a challenge, and the positive replies were actually suppressed by their own people.

That was too cowardly!

However, the elders couldn’t help but sympathize with those people, considering Su Ping’s strength!

A duel among peers was fair. However, not just in the Rain Clan, very few people in the entire godly world could fight him on equal terms!

Su Ping was a Dao Child of the Heavenly Path State; he was already one of the strongest at his level since he could attain that position. He was currently the strongest of all the Dao Children by far; people at his level were no different than ants to him.

“You don’t dare to fight me?” Su Ping sneered and said, “Is this the pride you proclaim to have? Even your weakest clansmen knows that your bones must be tough; however, your higher-tiered clansmen seem to have soft bones. That’s fine. I’ll go easy on you… I will challenge all the God Kings of the Rain Clan at the same time!”

His voice echoed throughout the sky, reaching the ears of all the people in the Rain Clan.

Even if their God Kings tried to block his voice, it was infused with power of the Great Dao and couldn’t be blocked at all.

Emperor Que could have blocked it, but he was too proud to do so.

Such an action was beneath his God Emperor status, and would be tantamount to accepting defeat.

“Do you dare?” Su Ping roared.

The entire Rain Clan was silent.

Those who had been scolded and muted looked at each other in bewilderment.?One person to challenge all the God Kings of our Rain Clan? How unbelievably arrogant!

However… the bigshots of their clan were not responding!

Many clansmen were worried and suspicious at the moment.

Could it be that… our Rain Clan is truly scared of this person?
