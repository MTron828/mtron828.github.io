Chapter 420 All Together Now

Soon enough, all parties learned of Su Ping’s return.

The major families in the Longjiang Base City were also alerted!

All the major families had sent someone to stand guard on Taohuaxi Street. Every family hoped to be first in knowing when Su Ping returned and the first to be there so that they would leave a good impression on him.

The moment Su Ping appeared, all the major families were informed at almost the exact same time.

The Qin family.

“He is back. Go. Tell Shuhai and Shaotian to come with me.”

Qin Duhuang, family head of the Qin family, stood up at once. He was no longer in the mood to chat with the friend that had visited him to enjoy some tea.

This friend was at the upper position of the titled rank and he was from another base city. Naturally, he was surprised that Qin Duhuang would react like this after receiving a piece of information.

“Hey man, what is going on?”

“Nothing. A terrifying fellow is back and I have to go and visit him. Please wait for me here,” Qin Duhuang said.

“A terrifying fellow?” That friend of his was astonished. It was rare for Qin Duhuang to be scared of someone like this, unless that someone was a legendary battle pet warrior. Who was the person that Qin Duhuang would describe as terrifying?

He wanted to ask a few more questions but Qin Duhuang had already left.

The Mu family. “Hurry up and tell Brother Three and his granddaughter Mu Shuangwan that Su Ping is back.”

The family head of the Mu family was startled after he learned of Su Ping’s return. He gave those orders without wasting another second.

Su Ping didn’t have any issues with the Mu family. The only conflict between them was about Mu Shungwan having advertised for the store. Things went out of control back then and Mu Shuangwan had canceled the contract. Su Ping was no longer the same as before. The elders of the five families were there when Su Ping overwhelmed the Tang family and forced the Star Organization to back down. That indeed happened. The family head of the Mu family knew he had to treat Su Ping seriously since there was some mysterious legendary battle pet warrior with him.

No one in the Mu family had dared to spread the fact that a legendary battle pet warrior was residing in the Longjiang Base City.

After all, in the off chance they disturbed that legendary battle pet warrior, the Mu family would be wiped out with a single move.

At the same time, the Liu family, the Zhou family, and the Ye family also sprang into action. Their family heads prepared some presents and left for the street in the shantytown area without delay.

The five families were going to gather at the Taohuaxi Street.

Inside the store.

Someone arrived at the store, moments after Tang Ruyan finished her conversation with Su Ping.

They were from the Tang family.

Tang Ruyan did a little bit selfish thing since she had informed those from the Tang family first so that they would be the first to get there, which would demonstrate their sincerity.

The Tang family had sent over a family elder, as well as two titled battle pet warriors, one male, one female. The three of them were all quite famous.

“You must be Mr. Su, right?”

The Tang family elder saw Su Ping sitting on the couch. The elder had looked at Su Ping’s picture before he arrived. As soon as he recognized Su Ping, the elder wore a big smile, walked up to him, and said politely, “My title is Ghost Chains, Mr. Su.”

While he made the self-introduction, the two titled battle pet warriors standing behind him were sizing Su Ping up and down as well.

The information they received was correct. The man was young and not even at the seventh rank yet.

This was a person who could overwhelm three elders of our Tang family?

The Tang family had found a way to get videos of the Elite League competitions in the base city. They had seen the young man in the video. Both of the titled battle pet warriors were surprised that the young man, who was at the sixth rank, could be on par with titled battle pet warriors!

The titled rank was three ranks higher than the sixth rank. This young man was not a common human being! Su Ping darted a glance at the old man titled Ghost Chains. “Have you brought the treasures to me?”

The old man titled Ghost Chains smiled fawningly. “Yes. I suppose you mean the Illustrated Handbook of our treasures, right. I have brought all the Illustrated Books of all the treasures in our family’s collection. You can choose whichever one you want. We will deliver to you the ones you like immediately.”

With that said, he handed over a portable flash drive that could be connected to the phone.

Su Ping took it over and plugged it into this phone. He saw an icon pop out and clicked it open. The information about many treasures was presented to him.

There were pictures, explanations of the functions and categories.

Su Ping didn’t hurry to choose any of them. He browsed through the data first.

There were over two hundred pieces.

In the old days, Su Ping would have been surprised by the amount but since he currently had over ten thousand pieces of treasures, he was no longer interested.

Also, judging by the amount, Su Ping believed the Tang family had not shown him everything

That was understandable, though.

After all, the Tang family had a huge collection of artifacts and treasures. It was unlikely that they would show him all the treasures they had. Those treasures were their secret weapons and would be distributed to the Tang family disciples in the future. Information of those treasures was classified. Letting others know about the information and functions of all the treasures would diminish their effects.

“Mr. Su, could... would you please let us meet Tang Mingqing and the other two for a little bit?” The old man titled Ghost Chains smiled obsequiously. Tang Mingqing and the other two were being held prisoners there. Ghost Chains knew this was not the time for him to act in a conceited way.

He had learned from the information collected that there was a legendary battle pet warrior in Su Ping’s store, which had made the Tang family all the more prudent.

Su Ping cast a glance at him and then nodded to Tang Ruyan who was standing next to him.

Tang Ruyan said to the old man titled Ghost Chains, “Just a moment, please.” She turned around and went to the test room. Su Ping had given his permission and the door had opened automatically.

Tang Ruyan pushed the door open and invited the three elders to come out.

The three elders were in a terrible state after having spent five days without water or food. Of course, they hadn’t reached the point where they would starve to death. As soon as they came out, they saw Ghost Chains and the other two titled battle pet warriors from the Tang family.

The three of them were seized with a surge of emotions. For the past five days, they had been on tenterhooks. They thought something must have gone wrong between their family and Su Ping. Being unable to receive any information for the past five days, the three elders remain awake all night with worry.

Ghost Chains breathed in relief to see the three elders were still alive. The three of them were important to the Tang family. Losing the three would be a great damage to the Tang family. Second, considering the Tang family’s actual future family head, each and every one of them was more important than Tang Ruyan!

Su Ping paid no heed to their meeting and focused his mind on browsing the Illustrated Books.

Soon, he had picked out nine pieces that were quite nice. Four of them were weapons and the other five had other special effects. Su Ping was unable to find any other piece to his satisfaction.

“I heard that the family heirloom of your Tang family is impressive,” Su Ping said.

Ghost Chains as well as the three elders including Tang Mingqing became scared. “Mr. Su, that is our family heirloom and you have already said that you wouldn’t ask for that...” Ghost Chains said carefully. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Su Ping knew that they wouldn’t give him that and he wasn’t asking for it, either. But since Ghost Chains had misunderstood him, Su Ping decided that he could follow his lead, “Since I won’t ask for it, then let me know the specific functions of that family heirloom. I don’t think that is an outrageous request, is it?’”

Ghost Chains found no word to reply. Feeling awkward, he darted a look at Tang Mingqing and the other two elders.

The three of them were having a hard time deciding as well. Su Ping could come up with ways to counter their family heirloom when he found out about the specific functions.

The Ocean Umbrella could help them ambush and kill legendary battle pet warriors. But if the legendary battle pet warriors knew that beforehand and thought of ways to strike back, the Ocean Umbrella would be of no use in this regard.

“Well, Mr. Su, the family heirloom’s secrets are exclusive to our family head. We know very little about it,” Ghost Chains answered.

“Then tell me whatever it is you do know,” Su Ping pushed him. Ghost Chains was a bit less worried. It seemed that Su Ping was aware that they weren’t going to tell him everything and was fine with them telling whatever they could. That would make things easier for them. Soon, Ghost Chains told Su Ping all the information about the Ocean Umbrella that had become public knowledge or that it had been found out by other families.

For example, the Ocean Umbrella could be used to kill legendary battle pet warriors or to manufacture illusions, etc.

Those were not secrets anymore; they became the general basics about the Ocean Umbrella.

Su Ping was surprised to learn that the Tang family would be able to get such a treasure. The Tang family had no legendary battle pet warriors but they could assassinate them with the Ocean Umbrella.

Su Ping didn’t even get many items like this in the dragon king’s collection of treasures. As to the items that were like the Ocean Umbrella, he couldn’t use them just yet due to his current rank.

He could only use two treasures that the dragon king had given him, the dragon horn and the armor.

“Good to know.” Su Ping did not push them for more details. He would be satisfied to get some general information. He could ask them more but they didn’t necessarily want to answer. The Ocean Umbrella would be useless to them if they made every feature known.

Su Ping picked out several more items and told Ghost Chains. “I want these. Bring them to me tomorrow.”

Ghost Chains felt his heart ache. The Tang family did hide some of the top-level treasures but they did include many top-level treasures in the thumb drive to prevent Su Ping from getting suspicious and he had picked all of them.

All of those top-level treasures had been tainted with blood. The Tang family had acquired them either by robbing or searching Mysterious Realms.

Su Ping’s random selection had cost the Tang family a decade-long effort!

A decade was not a short time for a family. The Tang family had a history of hundreds of years but they did have to go through great ordeals to make it happen. Any wrong decision could have cost the Tang family or it would get them excluded from the circle of the most influential families.

What happened this day, without a doubt, was a heavy blow to the Tangs. However, they couldn’t argue with Su Ping. If they offended him again and angered that potential legendary battle pet warrior, that could mean the end of the Tang family! The Ocean Umbrella could kill legendary battle pet warriors but that wasn’t to say that the Tang family was confident enough to challenge legendary battle pet warriors. The Ocean Umbrella was an item that could protect them, a trump card. “Can you bring them over tomorrow?” Su Ping asked.

Ghost Chains came back to his senses. “Of course. Mr. Su, don’t worry.” He smiled fawningly.

Su Ping nodded.

He wasn’t all that interested in the treasures. But he wanted them to show their disposition.

He wasn’t one to be provoked easily.

The ones that did anger him would have to pay the corresponding price.

While they had just finished talking, someone else arrived.

It was Xie Gange, the King of Arms, from the Star Organization.

He was surprised to see Ghost Chains. It never occurred to him that the Tang family would send over another old guy at the peak of the titled rank.

Xie Gange and Ghost Chains exchanged some eye contact as a way to greet each other. Xie Gange approached Su Ping, said hello, and took out a small thumb drive. Just like the Tang family, Xie Gange had stored all the information in the thumb drive.

Su Ping went back to picking treasures. While he did so, more and more people showed up.

The Qin family, the Liu family, the Mu family... in an instant, the representatives of the five major families were gathered at the Pixie Pet Store. This time, the family heads had made a personal visit!

Five automobiles that were exclusive to the five major families were parked on the street. It was a good thing that there weren’t any regular pedestrians on the street. Otherwise, they would have been utterly astounded!

The five family heads turned a bit pale when they saw the Tang family elders as well as Xie Gange in the store. The family heads came in, said hi to Su Ping, and then stepped to the sides, waiting quietly. Those that came with the five family heads were the promising young talents of each family, including Qin Shaotian, Mu Shuangwan, Ye Hao, Zhou Chuan, and Liu Jianxin.

A considerable number of titled battle pet warriors were standing in the store while Su Ping was the only one sitting on the couch. At this sight, the young, including Qin Shaotian, were filled with complex emotions.
