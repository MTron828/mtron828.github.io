Chapter 1363 Old Friend (1)

Behind that ancient gate-a lofty, yet vague shadow was slowly manifested.

The shadow was as high and mighty as a god. It stood there, seemingly becoming the center of the universe, enshrouded in an inexplicable

aura.

“In such a weak universe?” someone said in a whisper, and the void trembled violently. The voice alone had almost caused the nearby space to collapse.

A purely dark figure appeared and knelt in front of the gate.

“…I see.”

The shadow beyond the gate seemed to have received the message and whispered, “Keep investigating. Don’t alarm anyone.”

After that, the shadow gradually dispersed, along with the gate.

Exactly at that moment, something unusual happened in the trembling universe; it was twisting quickly. Hideous arms and heads surged from a crack, seemingly creatures from the deep sea. They roared and charged at the kneeling dark figure.

The latter snorted and turned into a streak of light, vanishing into nothingness.

All the scary arms and heads came to a halt after losing their target. However, the crack kept wiggling slowly, as if it were healing.

In the Celestial Court.

The place was like a gigantic star illuminating the area within several light years.

Many spacecraft carriers were slowly flying out of the teleportation points at the border of the Celestial Court, which accommodated countless soldiers and civilians.

Some tycoons were currently standing on the observation tower at the top of a spacecraft carrier and stared at the golden Celestial Court through the transparent protective shield.

There were twelve star zones in the universe, but most people would never have the chance to set foot in another star zone in their entire lives.

Not just crossing star zones, even crossing galaxies was extremely rare; only the rich and energetic could afford it.

The civilians were hiding in the cabins at the bottom of the spacecraft. Their faces, large and small, filled up the narrow windows as they gazed at that strange place with confusion and anxiety in their eyes.

According to the notice of the higher-ups, they were probably going to live in that place for a very long time.

That would also be the last shelter of the universe.

Once those Celestials moved there, Shen Huang, Chi Huo and all the others got busy. They led the newcomers to the designated areas so that they could settle down.

The defense line around the Celestial Court had been narrowed down to the core of the Golden Star Zone, with a radius of only several dozen light years. The place was instantly flooded with all the immigrants.

Shen Huang, Chi Huo and the others had manufactured a lot of planets in advance to accommodate the immigrants.

While everybody in the Celestial Court was busy receiving the guests, the Celestial experts were all present in the highest conference room; they hadn’t met in reality for a long time.

“Shen Huang, why is your command center on such a tiny planet?”

Hardly had they arrived when they posed the question. However, their tone was casual, not demanding. After all, Shen Huang was too powerful; nobody was willing to provoke a conflict with him.

They would be idiots if they argued with the host in his place, just after moving there.

“Xiao Su likes staying on this planet, so we turned it into the capital of the Celestial Court,” replied Shen Huang with a smile, being open about the matter.

Everybody felt dazed; the reason was quite unexpected. They thought there was something special about that place, since it was chosen as their hiding place; however, it merely turned out to be that the young man was fond of it.

“Shen Huang, you truly dote on Mr. Su,” said a Celestial expert awkwardly, addressing Su Ping in a different way. The latter didn’t have a title yet; they could only call him by his name.

“We’ve come from far away. We’d like to meet this Mr. Su fellow; will he attend today’s meeting?” asked someone else. Their intent was obvious; they wanted to check first hand how strong that arrogant upstart was, a guy from who knows where.

Shen Huang saw through their plan but didn’t back out. He said, “Xiao Su is usually very busy; I will tell him about you and your request to meet. If he’s free, he will probably come.”

“What is he busy with?” asked another Celestial.

Shen Huang glanced at him.”Cultivation, of course; a genius cannot evolve with talent alone.”

Chi Huo interrupted them and spoke with an impatient tone, “All right, enough chit chat. Now that you’re all here, let’s talk about the future defense plans for the border.”

Always short-fused, he quickly became angry when he noticed that they were wasting time.

“What’s the rush?” Chi Ying-leader of the Red Shadow Star Zone-rolled eyes at him. The two were old nemeses. Although he had bowed down before the Celestial Court, he was still at loggerheads with Chi Huo.

The latter narrowed his eyes and gazed at him coldly.

Chi Ying raised his eyebrows, but eventually looked away. That was Chi Huo’s home field and he didn’t want to start a conflict; after all, there was the monster backer who was able to kill Hei Huang remotely.

Shen Huang waved a hand and said, “Now that you’re all here, ask the advisors of your star zones to attend this meeting too. We have to listen to your opinion regarding the arrangements for the defense line.”

“Shen Huang is right.”

The other Celestials nodded. They were clearly happier when they found that their host wasn’t a dictator.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
