Chapter 1038: Challenge Accepted

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A deep pit appeared amid the dust, while golden divine blood splashed from the center. The brawny man’s lower half body was deeply buried in the pit. His chest had been cut apart, and all his ribs were cracked; he looked like a dying flower. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“You are a mere servant. How did you dare to be so disrespectful?”

Su Ping coldly raised his finger without showing any mercy.

“You… How bold of you…” The brawny man was more furious than shocked, right up to his dying breath; he didn’t expect that Su Ping would dare attack him outright. Most terrifyingly of all, that human was irresistibly strong. A moment earlier, he was almost reminded of the pressure given off by his young master from Su Ping.

Bang!

An aura that had been ultimately condensed was launched from Su Ping’s finger, piercing through the brawny man’s head and annihilating his soul; he couldn’t even be resurrected.

Su Ping didn’t even bother to look at him. He left the island and went straight to the Heart Mirror Academy, where the princes lived.

“Well…”

“He dared to kill that prince’s servant!”

“He’s so strong! Isn’t he just a Celestial God?”

Back on the island—the other students who lived in the other palaces witnessed the scene in shock. All of them were astonished, not expecting such a bold move from Su Ping. The conflict between them would definitely not end peacefully!

“Master…”

Outside Su Ping’s palace—the maid who served him was rather shocked by what she saw. She chased after him with worry showing in her eyes.

“Is he going to answer the challenge? Let’s go. I want to watch.” The princess who lived in one of the palaces rose and left for the arena.

The students in the other three palaces walked out; duels were always rare, especially those where the Rain Clan’s princes were involved.

Su Ping flew beyond the island and soon left the Unifying Heavens Academy. He reached the Heart Mirror Academy which was outside of the Heaven Path Institute.

The people inside the Heart Mirror Academy were those who had not met the divine quality requirement. They were asked to cultivate their personalities there.

Su Ping came to the sky above the Heart Mirror Academy and roared, “Where are you? The prince of the Rain Clan who challenged me! Come out!”

His voice rumbled throughout the Heart Mirror Academy like thunder in a sunny sky.

All the people who were cultivating in the academy looked up in surprise. They were even more astonished when they heard the stranger demand the presence of the Rain Clan’s prince. The Rain Clan was among the most powerful clans in the Archean Divinity. Who would dare to challenge them?

Two men were talking in one of the courtyards; both were dazed by Su Ping’s roar. One of them raised his head in confusion, and the other put on a cold smile with glittering eyes.?Has that guy finally run out of patience?

“This is outrageous! Who dares to call my clan so disrespectfully?”

A man rose to the sky from one of the courtyards. He was a prince of the Rain Clan, who was tall and graceful like a young emperor.

Su Ping looked at him, realizing that he wasn’t the young man whom he had met earlier. He said coldly, “I’m not here for you. Get lost!”

“You are a mere human being. How bold of you!”

The young man was infuriated. Had it not been for the rules, he would have slain Su Ping to uphold the Rain Clan’s honor.

“He’s here for me.”

An indifferent voice was heard. A young man walked over from a place in the void with hands behind his back and casually reached Su Ping. He was none other than Mo Feng, the prince.

His lips were curled, and his eyes were indifferent, as if he were looking at a dead person. “Are you finally done hiding and ready to accept my challenge?”

“Your challenge?”

Once he heard Mo Feng’s words, the young prince realized it had been Mo Feng himself who had caused trouble. He snorted and said, “He insulted the Rain Clan in public. You’d better ensure he dies quickly!”

Then, he waved his sleeves and retreated, leaving the matter to Mo Feng.

Back in the courtyard, everybody realized what had happened after hearing what Mo Feng said.?So, Mo Feng challenged this human to a duel; no wonder he came.

However, they saw the human as rather idiotic. Although Mo Feng wasn’t a student of the Heaven Path Institute, it wasn’t because he wasn’t strong enough, but only because his divine quality didn’t meet the requirement.

There would be few in terms of combat ability who could match him.

After all, he was a prince who had won competitions in one of the best clans. How talented must he be to have achieved that?

“This human being is a mere Celestial God, yet he dares to accept the challenge. He’s trying to get himself killed!”

“I would have cultivated in seclusion until I became a Major God if I were him!”

“This isn’t even a human territory, and yet he dares to disrespect the Rain Clan? His own clan might be wiped out because of it!”

Many gods looked at Su Ping coldly from their courtyards, thinking he was too stupid and arrogant. All of them expected him to be killed soon.

“What did you do to my servant?”

Mo Feng didn’t see his servant with Su Ping. He had ordered his servant to provoke Su Ping and coerce him into accepting his challenge, all to prevent him to stay in seclusion for a long time. After all, he knew the young man was an amazing genius who had made the Chaos Bell ring. He was confident of himself, but he didn’t want to postpone the matter for too long since accidents could happen.

“I killed him,” said Su Ping in a voice as cold as a blade, “He was just a humble slave, yet he disrespected me. Don’t worry, you’ll be joining him very soon!”

Mo Feng’s eyes glittered with coldness. “My servant’s life is a hundred times more precious than yours. You shouldn’t have touched him; you will soon die a miserable death!”

“Let’s go then! I’m not here to fight you with my tongue!” The cold faced Su Ping flew towards the arena, not saying another word.

Mo Feng sneered and closely followed him.

Many people in the Heart Mirror Academy shook their heads and thought that Su Ping would only get himself killed. Many others rose and followed them; they were rather curious about the reason for Su Ping to dare challenge the Rain Clan’s prince while he still was a Celestial God. He shouldn’t have made such a stupid decision, unless his head had been kicked by a donkey.?Does he really have something he can rely on?

News of the Rain Clan prince’s duel was immediately spread as the students in the Heart Mirror Academy moved out.

On one of the islands of the Fighting Heavens Academy—

Joanna was cultivating in her palace while studying a stone book, which recorded the powerful secret techniques of the Fighting Heavens Academy. She had been making fast progress thanks to her original self’s experience, and had already reached level three. Even Ascendants would find it hard to grasp that level, but she was very smart and had already mastered the key.

Discussions came from outside the palace all of a sudden. Joanna had just had an epiphany and was going to continue studying, but then she overheard the Rain Clan and the duel.

She was awfully sensitive about the Rain Clan, as she had accidentally trespassed on their territory during her past visit to the Archean Divinity.

She focused her attention and listened. The next moment, her expression changed.

The Rain Clan’s prince is going to challenge a human?

Joanna immediately thought of Su Ping; there weren’t many human beings in the Heaven Path Institute, and even fewer were related to the Rain Clan. She remembered the trouble Su Ping had caused for the Rain Clan earlier.

Wait, this is the Heaven Path Institute. He can still resurrect if he’s killed, but the existence behind him will be revealed, and the Ancestral God in the institute will surely investigate the matter…?Joanna’s expression changed abruptly. She couldn’t sit any longer, so she rushed out. She then asked her maid for directions to find the duel arena, and immediately went there.

In the dueling arena—

The place was rather cold, as it was rarely used; its floor was even covered in dust.

However, a lot of people had gathered in that place. They looked around frequently, but none saw the stars of the show.

“Is he not here? Did he flee?”

One of the maids was confused. She was on the same island where Su Ping lived, and had chosen to go there and watch the battle after seeing how he had killed the Rain Clan’s servant. However, Su Ping was nowhere to be seen.

“He went to the Heart Mirror Academy,” said a young god. He established a cloudy mirror in his hand that displayed what was happening outside the Heart Mirror Academy.

“He voluntarily went to meet the Rain Clan’s prince!”

“That human lost his mind!”

Many people were surprised, thinking that the human was trying to get himself killed.

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

Su Ping rushed to the dueling arena, with the Rain Clan’s prince following him closely behind.

“They’re here.”

“That human is just a Celestial God. How could he possibly win?”

“Is he ready to beg for mercy?”

Many people who sensed Su Ping’s level were rather shocked.

Su Ping was acting cold as he noticed all the unmasked scanning, but then chose to ignore all of them. He didn’t hide himself either, and released all of his aura.

Bang!

Mo Feng snapped his finger. The bell in the arena was instantly ringing throughout the field.

Very soon, an old man stepped out of the void; he was an Ascendant level god. He frowned and looked at everyone, before he asked, “Who is requesting a duel?”

“Me!”

Mo Feng spoke with hands behind his back, seeming like an unparalleled expert that looked down upon everybody else.

The old man looked at him and recognized his identity. He then gave a slight nod. “Who’s going to accept your challenge?”

“Me,” said Su Ping.

The old man looked at him in surprise, only to be astounded. He said, furrowing his brow, “Young man, what is it that makes you want to challenge this prince of the Rain Clan? Can’t you just apologize and compensate?”

He thought that the result of the duel was already certain, seeing that Su Ping was a mere Celestial God, and that it would be a one-sided slaughter. He had also detected the student badge on Su Ping’s person, which indicated that he was an official student, one who had good divine quality and talent; he didn’t want Su Ping to die so young.

“It’s already too late.” Mo Feng sneered.

Feeling the old man’s kindness, Su Ping nodded at him and said, “Thank you, senior, but that will be unnecessary.”

The old man glanced at them and heaved a sigh. He had seen too many young and ambitious geniuses, so he stopped persuading him. “Get prepared, then.”

He waved a hand after both of them entered the arena, to invoke divine laws that would block the entire field.

“The duel won’t end unless one party dies or the victor forgives the loser. I hope that there’s still mercy in whomever wins,” said the old man slowly. He had said the exact words a million times, but none of the people who had entered the arena had ever listened to him. One of the fighters would surely die, with blood gushing out.

“My mercy will be to grant him a painless death!” Brutality manifested on Mo Feng’s face as he revealed his true nature, as he was no longer afraid that Su Ping could escape..
