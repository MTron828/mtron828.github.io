Chapter 1278 Primordial Empyrean Master (1)

“Why is this happening?” Su Ping felt compelled to ask.

“The reason hasn’t been figured out yet; there are all kinds of theories. Some claim that the energy in the universe is fading, but the principle of entropy increase still remains, so the theory was debunked.”

Shen Huang continued, “Others say that the universe used to be solid, until it was somehow divided into nine layers; they are fusing right now, returning to their original state. So far, this is the most reliable theory, but it doesn’t have any substantial evidence.”

Chi Huo said, “If the universe is combined, the remains from ancient times found in deep spaces and the whispers of the ancient lords that were sealed deep in the universe will be released to the primary space. Ordinary people would be squeezed to death, and the weaker battle pet warriors would go crazy because of the remaining prehistoric power.

“Only Star Lords and above will be able to move freely by then.”

Shen Huang nodded solemnly. “However, there are only a million Star Lords scattered across the universe. That doesn’t even compare with the population of a tier-5 planet.

“We would have to keep all the weaker beings in our small universes. We’ll ask the Ascendant State cultivators to accommodate civilians in their small worlds. According to the future scenario, all the people will be living inside Ascendant dominions, and each owner of said dominions would be seen as a lord,” said Chi Huo.

Su Ping fell silent after the briefing. There seemed to be a solution, even though the catastrophe itself was a delicate matter.

After all, there had been signs of its coming since more than 100,000 years prior. Su Ping’s master and the others had probably considered many countermeasures.

I don’t think this is the same catastrophe mentioned by the system. Otherwise, the system wouldn’t have warned me in such a way. The shrinkage of the universe poses little threat given my current strength…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He felt that the shrinking of the universe was probably just the beginning

The real catastrophe had yet to begin.

In any case, he had to improve his strength and upgrade his store as fast as possible.

“Master, I want to know more about the Planet of Origin. How many Celestials are there, besides the twelve of you? And who are the sages you mentioned?” Su Ping asked quickly, trying to find out more about the top secrets of the universe.

Shen Huang and Chi Huo looked at each other. The former answered, “Right now, you are indeed qualified to know everything. I will send a request to the Planet of Origin to raise your identity to the highest tier, so that you can browse through all the secrets recorded in the past million years of our universe. “The Planet of Origin is the brain of this Federation, as well as the center of the federal government. The sages lead the federal government, and are the pinnacle of human wisdom. Their brains have evolved significantly; they are both politicians and the best scientists. They take care of all affairs pertaining to the Federation.

“Even though us Celestials control the twelve star zones, we’re only independent lords to some extent.

“We have to file applications to the Planet of Origin when it comes to the top level matters, such as raising your identity to tier 9, which requires their permission. I have clearance to raise it to tier 7. Tier 8 is for talents who have made remarkable contributions to the Federation, such as top Heavenly Lords, top trainers, top generals, and the like.

Shen Huang continued, “The sages are mostly Star Lords; very few are in the Ascendant realm. They’re smart and good at scheming. Although talented in cultivation and fighting, their journey to the Ascendant State depends on devotion and concentration; oftentimes they’re too distracted to advance their cultivation.

“Considering the Federation’s advanced science and abundant resources, it’s already impressive that they become Star Lords. They usually live between 100,000 and 200,000 years.

“Ascendant State sages are mostly as strong as Heavenly Lords. They’re the leaders of all sages.

“Aside from sages, there are also saints!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Saints are the Planet of Origin’s armed forces commanded by the sages. The Saint King you met and Kayafollet are both saints from the Planet of Origin.

“There are only three Saint Kings on the Planet of Origin: the first generation, the second generation and the third generation. The one I fought is the third-generation Saint King, the only one who is roaming in the universe right now.

“The first-generation and second-generation Saint Kings retired when the third-generation Saint King grew up. It is said that they’re spending their retirement on the Planet of Origin, studying the ways of universe dominators.

“Kayafollet has apparently grown up; she should be the fourth-generation Saint King.”

“There are two more Saint Kings?”

Su Ping was surprised by the Planet of Origin’s might. There were three Saint Kings —all of Celestial cultivation-residing on the planet. No wonder it was the de facto center of the Federation.

“Why would the three Celestials listen to the sages?” asked Su Ping curiously.

The sages were of a much lower cultivation; could they subdue Celestials with their wisdom alone?

Su Ping believed in physical strength; even the smartest people had to rely on some medium to convey their wisdom. They could be knocked out with a punch if they ever met a reckless individual, and all of their wisdom would be for naught.

“This involves the Planet of Origin’s greatest secret.”
