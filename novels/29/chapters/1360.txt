Chapter 1362 Unification of the Universe (1)

Looking at their eyes, Su Ping understood that they were unwilling to give up the land. After all, it was also home to countless gods; they couldn’t just leave it behind.

“Now that you’ve reached a decision, I’ll try not to keep you waiting too long,” said Su Ping.

“Mr. Su, really, don’t feel pressured by this. We actually enjoy our life here. Especially when we thought that we would soon leave, it suddenly occurred to us that there are many places we haven’t appreciated yet,” said Shivalello.

Eborr nodded. “That’s right. I plan to travel the world again as an ordinary god. Maybe it will take several hundred years, maybe several thousand. I want to take a good look at this place.”

Su Ping could sympathize with them. He nodded and said, “If you choose to stay, there’s something I would like to request.”

“Mr. Su, do speak.”

“I need a large batch of food. If conditions allow, I hope that you can ask the local residents to plant crops for me. The more, the better,” said Su Ping.

He had planned to seek help from the Heaven Path Institute, or the master of the Red Dome Realm. Considering his deputy master identity, it wouldn’t be hard for him to task a batch of people to grow food.

“Food?” All four of them were stunned. That was obviously the last thing they expected Su Ping to ask for. To them, food was a strange and distant word; after all, they no longer needed any. They did eat on occasion, but only to satisfy their senses; they were certainly uninterested in normal food, and only indulged in delicious cuisine.

“Yes, food for humans.” Su Ping nodded.

“You need it for your people, Mr. Su?” asked Shivalello.

Su Ping shook his head. “Not my people, but my compatriots. We’re now faced with a war, and we might be short of food.”

“Got it.”

Heather looked at Su Ping in surprise and asked, “Mr. Su, considering your strength, there are wars that you can’t win?”

.....

“Of course.”

Su Ping answered without thinking, “Even if I become an Ancestral God, there will be wars I can’t win. Although strength is the only thing that matters, there are things that you can’t accomplish on your own.”

His own words somehow led him to a realization, and then vaguely understood how to find his Dao Heart.

All four gods felt puzzled, as they couldn’t understand what Su Ping told them. A war that not even an Ancestral God can win?Is the other party an Ancestral God too? In their eyes, when someone was strong enough, they could single handedly suppress an entire clan. That was the case in the Archean Divinity; the birth of an Ancestral God could promote an ordinary clan to become a high-ranked clan.

Clans without Ancestral Gods had to back off in front of a high-ranked clan.

After all, such existences could easily destroy any clan if they ever chose to take action. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

That was absolute strength!

“If you need it, Mr. Su, we’ll definitely do our best. Growing food is easy for us. You killed the ultimate beasts in forbidden places a while back, now those places have shrunk in size; there are a lot of empty areas to grow food,” said Shivalello.

Su Ping nodded. “I’ll entrust the matter to you then; the more food, the better.”

.

“Okay.”

All of them nodded.

Su Ping didn’t stay for much longer. He said his goodbyes and left that world.

He returned to the store and placed the trained pets in the pet room. Then, he picked another batch of creatures and left for a different cultivation site.

Time flew.

Su Ping traveled to many cultivation sites. While training his customers’ pets, he also trained the Lightning Rat, the Inferno Dragon and the others. Even though they were already strong, capable of fighting Celestials except for the struggling Lightning Rat, Su Ping didn’t allow them to relax; he continued with the harsh training, as he knew that a war would very likely break out, and there was the alien among the worms. Middle-rank cultivation sites were no longer challenging to his pets. He could only choose the high-rank ones.

Aside from the Archean Divinity and the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, there were a dozen more sites of high-rank.

They were places such as the Realm of Bleak Dragons, the Remains of Ancestral Humans, the Realm of Magic Beasts, and so on.

Su Ping discovered that the enemies in those high-ranked sites were as strong as those found in the Archean Divinity. In the Realm of Bleak Dragons, for instance, they found all kinds of dragons; many of them were in the Celestial State.

In the Remains of Ancestral Humans there was nothing but giants who were hundreds of meters tall.

The trees and mountains were extremely tall too. Su Ping had the feeling that he had been miniaturized to a thousand of his original size. Even a leaf was as massive as a cloud.

Most giants, named Ancestral Humans, were as strong as cultivators of Celestial level. Oddly enough, they didn’t cultivate any small universe; their bodies were terrifyingly sturdy.

Compared to these worlds, the place I live in is only a middle-rank cultivation site at best. However, considering all the middle-rank cultivation sites, it is definitely one of the best… Su Ping considered the level of his universe and found it inferior.

How far away those cultivation sites were from his universe was a mystery. Their experts were certainly capable of tearing apart his universe. If they ever found it, the invasion of any Ancestral God would be an absolute disaster.

However, our universe has never been invaded in ages. It’s like Earth in the past; in the middle of a vast universe, but it never encountered an interstellar civilization. Like an isolated village in the mountains…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. Maybe-once he became an Ancestral God and could travel beyond the universe—he would know what it was like out there.

He went to those cultivation sites and led his pets to fight and defeat all kinds of Celestial State creatures, while also making a lot of friends on the way.

Getting to know those strangers gave Su Ping an amazing feeling. Although they were from different races and had different habits, they were very similar in certain aspects.

It was quite marvelous and lovely to share similarities with a stranger from a completely different race.

All creatures were different. Maybe the differences between creatures were not meant for them to reject each other, but to understand and appreciate one another.

Su Ping’s heart was further polished after returning from his outing. On the eighth day, the first Celestial expert arrived in the Celestial Court with his star zone’s residents and army.

Shen Huang and Chi Huo welcomed the new arrivals.

More Celestials experts teleported over on their spacecraft carriers in the following two days.

Far in the Black Desolation Star ZoneKayafollet had been sent to help them gather their forces. All opposition and dissidents were suppressed by her; the universe was gradually unifying and gathering.

In an unknown place in deep space—there was an ancient gate, which was slowly opening
