Chapter 1399: Slaying the Heavens (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

At that very moment—the sword cut into the arm of the Heavens’ race member.

Black blood was sprayed from the sky like black rain, which was strangely corrosive and fragrant. Even laws were being pierced; no substance could resist.

The black lifeblood fell on the mountain and was blocked by the barrier; which immediately began to burn as white Heavenly Fire.

“What is… that?”

At that moment, the other elders noticed the figure deep inside the clouds. They were stunned.

!!

Someone quickly changed their expression, widening their eyes in shock as if realizing something.

The person was terrified, as they sensed an unsettling aura coming from that figure.

“The Heavens…” someone whispered the ominous name which had been buried in the annals of time. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The thunderclouds that had been torn apart by the sword were quickly healed; they now had additional white flames that echoed with the lightning. It was clear that the alien creature hiding in the clouds was infuriated; to attack he was using both the tribulation and his Heavenly Fire.

Su Ping sneered. He was no longer worried, as he knew that there weren’t any other members of the Heavens in the vicinity. He waved his sword and launched another powerful attack.

The sword aura seemed to be a reflection of the netherworld, cutting the sky in half.

The newly condensed thunderclouds were cut to pieces. Even the Heavenly Fire coursing inside them was dispelled. Su Ping had mastered the law of tribulation, so he actually destroyed the lightning from within. Heavenly Fire didn’t pose a threat for him, either. His second attack injured the alien’s arm again, leaving another injury.

“Get down here!!” Su Ping roared.

The member of the Heavens deep inside the clouds also roared, dispersing the clouds and finally revealing himself; he seemed reluctant to stay hidden. Fury twisted his face as he charged towards Su Ping.

“What’s that?”

“A monster?!”

Everybody was able to see the man from the Heavens’ race. All the students in the institute were in shock, eyes as wide as they could go. Even some of the mentors were shocked.

They thought that Su Ping was fighting against the Heavenly Tribulation; none of them thought that he was actually battling a monster.

“I’ve never seen such a creature before…” mumbled the young-looking Qian Hong with a frown.

“He carries the aura of chaos…” Shen Mo also narrowed his eyes as he examined the monster that appeared out of nowhere.

“It is indeed a member of the Heavens…”

Elder Chan was shocked, as he saw that scene from a distance, not expecting that Su Ping’s claims were actually true. He knew that Su Ping wasn’t a liar, but there was no evidence to back what he said. Things changed, as the evidence was right before their eyes.

The Heavens had truly invaded their world, and were taking action in the Heaven Path Institute!

“Help the Dao Child!” said an elder as he quickly reacted, dashing toward the mountain.

Su Ping had a cold smile as he stared at the member of the Heavens swooping down to attack him. He remembered how he was banished from his own universe and how the battle pet warriors died while covering their retreat. He could no longer hold back his hatred and fury.

Many familiar faces were left behind, and it was all because of the Heavens.

“One life for one life! Your life is only enough to compensate for the death of one human being!” Su Ping roared crazily and condensed a dazzling divine sword in his hand, slashing furiously.

“Judgment!”

The member of the Heavens roared and waved his hands. A Wheel of Judgment made of many small universes appeared, causing a heavy and overwhelming pressure.

Although that particular member was only a basic form of the Heavenly Dao, he was a God Emperor in his own right. He seemed to be even more terrifying than the elders of the Heaven Path Institute.

Su Ping had already seen the Heavens’ power of judgment, and would have only fled in panic if it were in the past. Back then they were only able to resist with the Titan Divine Array by combining the power of other Celestials. But now, he suddenly felt that the Wheel of Judgment was nothing and that he could shatter it with an even greater power!

A violent power surged out of Su Ping’s body. He waved his arm and slashed at the Wheel of Judgment, causing a huge blast.

The air on the entire mountain was obliterated. The mountain would have also been destroyed too without the protection of the barrier, but the rivers and soil in the surroundings were all gone.

The mere wake of such power had destroyed all substances.

“I’m coming to help you!”

“Don’t hurt our Dao Child!”

Furious roars were heard. The elders of the institute flew to the mountain and stood in front of Su Ping, launching various attacks that forced the creature to retreat.

Elder Chan approached Su Ping and asked quickly, “Are you all right?”

Su Ping gave him a slight head shake. While looking at the elders around him, he said, “He’s one of the Heavens. You must be careful.”

“I didn’t expect that the mythical thing I read about in ancient records is real!” said an elder with a sigh, who gazed at the alien with an odd expression. “He’s a God Warrior, but he seems to be much stronger than us. Is he truly one of the Heavens that ended the age of chaos?”

“He is not as strong as I expected,” said another elder. Although he couldn’t defeat the guy in a duel, the guy was clearly not as strong as the Heavens mentioned in rumors.

“He is only the basic form of Heavenly Dao, one of the weakest among the Heavens,” said Su Ping quickly, fearing that they would underestimate the enemy.

“One of the weakest?”

Everybody was stunned; their expressions changed.

If the weakest was as strong as that guy, then there had to be a lot of Ancestral Gods among the Heavens, unless their population was small.

The man from the Heavens’ race gave the elders a cold stare. Filled with fury, he suddenly raised an arm, and a silver scroll appeared in his hand.

The scroll was made of pure power. However, the power was not the Great Dao, but something that Su Ping couldn’t understand, like the Heavenly Fire.

As the member of the Heavens slowly recited two ancient syllables, everybody felt that the void was shaking and their bodies were being restrained. They could no longer feel their universes.

“What is going on?”

“My body…”

Everybody was appalled. Without a doubt, it was the creature’s doing.

However, they had never heard of such a method before. Have all our universes been restricted?

Whoosh!

The member of the Heavens stored the scroll and charged at them.

An elder suddenly changed his expression. He was stunned, as he could only move at an extremely slow speed. He summoned all his strength, yet he could not accelerate. His eyes were bloodshot as the alien charged at him.

“Damn it!”

The other elders also felt the unprecedented danger. Their shock was evident. Is this a member of the Heavens? Even the weakest among them is this impudent when facing so many God Emperors?

When the creature was about to crash into the elder standing in the lead, Su Ping suddenly roared, “Get lost!”

He charged forward and the universe of chaos appeared behind him. He condensed his power on his fist and punched the member of the Heavens back.

The alien was clearly shocked when he saw the universe behind the human’s back. He could not understand why Su Ping was still able to release it.

“Looks like you don’t know everything!” Su Ping roared and punched in rapid succession. His punches struck home like thunder.

Fist-shaped dents appeared on the alien’s body, forcing the latter to retreat.

The elders were shocked by the turn of events, all wide eyed. Su Ping was too ferocious; the power he displayed was as impressive as theirs.

Did he just pass the God Emperor’s tribulation?

“Rot in hell!”

Su Ping aggressively raised his fist. After gathering all the power in his body, he threw a punch.

The member of the Heavens realized what was going on, and instantly summoned the Wheel of Judgment to protect him.
