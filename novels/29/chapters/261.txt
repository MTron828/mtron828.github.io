Chapter 264 Breakthrough

“Well, not bad, not bad at all.”

Su Ping checked the pets one by one. All of them were rated as above average, up to the standard of professional training.

As for their combat strength.

Since those pets had low-rank bloodlines, even though they weren’t above average, their combat strength had just reached seven in rating, similar to the Lightning Rat, or even a bit inferior to the Lightning Rat.

The Lightning Rat had been regarded as above average as well but it had been trained multiple times. Of all the pets of the same level, the Lightning Rat had excelled. But then again, it was still hard for the Lightning Rat to progress further than that.

Having trained pets many times, Su Ping had discovered some patterns.

Generally speaking, to be rated as above average, pets with low-rank bloodlines would have to have a combat strength of around seven.

For pets with middle-rank bloodlines, they would have to reach nine points in combat strength.

As for pets with advanced-rank bloodlines, up until then, Su Ping had not trained such pets yet. He assumed it was highly likely that those pets would have to have at least a combat strength of 10 to be rated as above average in aptitude.

For the moment, only the Little Skeleton had a combat strength beyond 10. And yet, the Little Skeleton was merely at the sixth rank and was considered below average. It was because its bloodline was formidable, which had brought down its overall rating.

On the other hand, it was thanks to the Skeleton King bloodline that the Little Skeleton could grow up so fast and smoothly.

“Having someone on the inside is good.”

Su Ping exclaimed to himself.

In the old days, he would have to train the pets by himself, which was life-threatening. He had spent seven days, ending in complete exhaustion, just to train the Celestial Pig. Look at him now. The training went along swimmingly while he was lying around, and it even took less time than before!

The more he thought of it, the more he believed that hiring Joanna as his employee had been a wise decision.

The admission fee to this Demigod Burial was expensive but it was money well spent. From then on, he could look at this place as his dedicated professional training ground and Joanna would be the person in charge.

“Let’s go. We’ll come back later,” Su Ping said to Joanna. He was ready to go back. “Coming back?” “Of course. We have more pets to be trained Besides, I want to enjoy that spring a bit more,” Su Ping said cheerfully.

Joanna rolled her eyes at him. What a greedy man.

Of course, she said nothing. The spring was precious but Su Ping was her boss. For the great cause of revisiting the Archean Divinity, she had to give up on those trivial benefits for the time being.

Since she said nothing to oppose him, Su Ping summoned the system to take them back to the store.

Soon, the swirl in the air emerged and sucked in Su Ping, Joanna, as well as all the pets.

By the time they opened their eyes again, they were in the familiar environment within the store.

Su Ping found places for the pets that had completed their training and then looked through his notebook to select the second batch of pets to be trained.

Too bad that Joanna is just an employee and her pets cannot be brought back to life when they die. Otherwise, I could ask her to help me carry some pets, which could save me some trips and admission fees.

How vexing.

In the cultivation sites, when Joanna died, she would be sent back to the store directly.

However, the pets she carried would die for real and could no longer be revived. As such, Su Ping had to give up on the idea of having Joanna carry some pets for him.

“Let’s go.”

After he got ready, Su Ping bought a ticket to the Demigod Burial again. Joanna remained poker-faced.

Soon, the two of them arrived.

Their “driver” this time was still the Major God named Augu.

This Major God didn’t seem happy to see Su Ping. But since Joanna was with him, the Major God didn’t show his anger. That being said, that warm smile on his face did disappear.

Time flew. Soon, a night had passed.

Dawn broke and twilight cast its beautiful hue to the countless households in the Longjiang Base City.

One night had passed in the base city, but Su Ping had been working for 10 days in the cultivation site.

He had spent all of his time cultivating in the spring during those 10 days. He had stayed in the water for so long that his skin had become wrinkled.

As for the pets?

He had let Joanna take care of the pets. Su Ping, the hands-off boss, had been busy with his own cultivation.

Joanna did not let Su Ping down. All the pets they had brought were different from before. At the moment, every pet was rated as above average.

During this time, Su Ping had progressed markedly. He had reached the intermediate position of the sixth rank.

All of the star vortexes inside him had changed into a golden color with a stronger pulling force, which had a direct impact on his strength.

In battles, the level of strength released in an instant was critical. In a fight of life and death, the instant outburst of strength could enable Su Ping to react faster than his opponent because the time he needed to build up his strength would be shorter.

The “Fist of Exorcist” he had picked up was a skill that relied heavily on the instant outburst of strength. The golden star vortexes began to spin around as Su Ping started to practice the “Fist of Exorcist.” He was feeling better and stronger. When he built up his strength to the extreme, his punch could even cause some sonic booms!

The sonic boom was of a minimal level and it still took him too long to unleash the “Fist of Exorcist,” which implied that he couldn’t put this skill in practice just yet. He had a long way to go before he could just punch out and generate a sonic boom without extra effort.

Su Ping had a feeling that by the time he reached the upper position of the sixth rank or the seventh rank, he could attain the first rank of the “Fist of Exorcist.” By then, with one punch, he could kill a ninth-rank beast!

Su Ping supposed that if he were to compare himself to a pet, according to the system’s criteria, he would be regarded as average or above average by then.

I must learn the first level of the ‘Fist of Exorcist’ before I reach the seventh rank!

Su Ping set himself a goal.

He was the owner of a pet store and he had trained so many pets that had been rated as above average while he himself had not reached this rating when he had practiced the “Fist of Exorcist.” That would reflect poorly on him.

At this moment, Su Ping didn’t see himself as a battle pet warrior, nor did he count the pet’s strength as his own.

“Let’s go.”

Having checked all the pets, Su Ping told Joanna it was time to go back.

Joanna nodded. She excused the servants, gave several orders, and went back to the store with Su Ping.

“Come on, little guy.”

Su Ping summoned the Little Skeleton to see how many Divine Crystals it had consumed.

The Little Skeleton had consumed over one thousand of the two thousand pieces. The Divine Charge in the Little Skeleton had exceeded one hundred. Those Divine Crystals Joanna had provided were of high quality. Each Divine Crystal could add about 10 points of Divine Value.

Ten Divine Crystals could generate one Divine Charge. Because of the storage of over one hundred Divine Charges, Su Ping could see a divine enhancement cost listed behind all of the Little Skeleton’s skills.

Su Ping had witnessed the power of divinely enhanced skills. As such, he had high expectations of the Little Skeleton’s combat strength.

Combat strength: 10.7

The one hundred Divine Charges had increased the Little Skeleton’s combat strength. Su Ping could see some faint, dark golden glow in the Little Skeleton’s bones. The special aroma unique to divine energy was refreshing.

I assume the Little Skeleton’s combat strength will reach 11 points when it’s done consuming all of the two thousand Divine Crystals.

But the Divine Charge has not seen any qualitative change. A one hundred Divine Value will transform into one Divine Charge. But even with one hundred points, the Divine Charge has not transformed into anything. Is this it? Or, is more Divine Charge needed to transform to another level?”

Su Ping couldn’t arrive at any conclusion. He decided to drop the matter.

Anyways, an increase in combat strength was good.

Su Ping told the Little Skeleton to continue to consume the Divine Crystals. He looked at his watch. It was nine in the morning; still early. He rested for a bit and then cleaned his store.

“Get ready for business.”

After everything was ready, Su Ping unfolded the scroll and shook Tang Ruyan out from it.

“You, you, you... Can you not tell me before you get me out?”

Tang Ruyan fell to the ground. Caught off guard, she landed in an embarrassing position, which left her blue faced. “It’s okay. I don’t mind.”

“I do mind!!”

“Sure. Open the door and look refreshed. Time for work.”

Tang Ruyan stomped on the ground, furious; she refrained to reply to Su Ping. After she tidied up her clothes and found out that her hair was in a mess, she asked, “Hey, is there a bathroom anywhere?”

“Yes.”

After the upgrade, the system added a user-friendly feature in the store, i.e. the bathroom. Of course, there was nothing special about the bathroom except that the faucet looked kind of fancy...

Fuming with rage, Tang Ruyan went to the bathroom to tidy up her clothes and hair. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Joanna, on the other hand, had bathed and changed in the Demigod Burial. Su Ping went to open the door without waiting for Tang Ruyan.

Outside, a few people were present.

Su Ping looked around. Fewer people than expected were waiting outside.

Based on the previous night’s situation, he should have seen a huge crowd gathered there in the morning. Did I hurt people’s feelings by closing the store early?

Not likely.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He summoned the Inferno Dragon. “Rise and shine. Get in position.”

The Inferno Dragon snorted. The Inferno Dragon wasnt happy about this arrangement. It was a dragon, with dignity. “En?” Su Ping darted a glance at the dawdling Inferno Dragon. Wishing for a round of training?

No one knew a man better than his own father. No one knew a pet better than his own master. Su Ping had raised the Inferno Dragon by himself. The Inferno Dragon trembled at Su Ping’s glance. Its sluggish steps turned into a scoot. The Inferno Dragon went to its spot by the door, adjusted its position, and crawled down.

Oh, how bright the sun is and how beautiful the flowers are.

Well, lying around seems to be nice, right?

The Inferno Dragon shot a look at the people checking it out from across the street and then closed its eyes to continue its nap. Su Ping went back to the store, sat behind the counter, and waited for customers. He picked up his phone to browse through the news. He didn’t forget that a store was competing against him since the previous day.

A night had gone by. What kind of lousy plan did Primo cook up this time?

Immediately, Su Ping was intrigued by a piece of news.

The first pop-out advertisement on a website that Su Ping frequented was Primo’s.
