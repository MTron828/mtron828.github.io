Chapter 447 Get Out

Who was the young man?

Everyone, all the students, and Ding Fengchun were all frozen in genuine surprise.

Who gave him the courage to talk to the young master of the Xiao Family like this?

Not even a master trainer’s child would offend the Xiao Family in such a way.

At the same time, from Su Ping’s reaction, the onlookers could tell that he and Xiao Fengxu weren’t friends. Quite the contrary. They both seemed to have a feud of sorts.

After some thought, considering what Xiao Fengxu had said earlier... That young master was not as refined and gentle as he looked.

Chen and Dai Lemao had even more questions about Su Ping after the exchange. They felt as if Su Ping had been angered by that shaming remark.

Both of them turned to Shi Haochi. If this was a mistake, then it would all be his fault!

Shi Haochi turned a bit pale. It wasn’t because he had doubts about Su Ping. It was because Su Ping was verbally insulting Xiao Fengxu. Of all the families in the Holy Light Base City, the Xiao Family had also had top trainers once, though... that top trainer had passed away years and years before.

That being said, there was still some lingering influence of that top trainer who had built up quite a network before he passed on. Besides, the Xiao Family still had master trainers at the moment.

Su Ping had created so much trouble for himself!

Zhou Jin, Tongtong, Qian Xiuxiu, and Zhou Jin were all staring at Su Ping in astonishment. How hot-tempered the man was.

Xiao Fengxu’s face was clouded. Su Ping didn’t soften his words at all; he had not shown any mercy. What a slap on the face.

Anyone with a little bit of politeness and sophistication would have merely retorted with some mild irony even when angered, since so many big potatoes were there.

Look at Su Ping. He blurted out insults straight away.

Talking about poor manners!

“Brother Su, what do you mean? I don’t think I have offended you.” Xiao Fengxu pulled a long face. It was beneath him to shout insults back at Su Ping.

Faking innocence was the right way to go.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows.

Huh, you want to play?

“Of course you didn’t offend me. But you know very well what you have done. I despise garbage like you. You are worse than a beast. Even talking to you has dirtied the air!” Su Ping didn’t go easy on him.

Playing? “An Actor Prepares.” You should read that.

Wa

Su Ping’s words once again stunned everyone. They felt like a huge piece of interesting gossip was going to be unleashed. The onlookers turned their gazes to Xiao Fengxu. What could he have done to piss Su Ping that badly?

Xiao Fengxu couldn’t believe what had just happened. I was following the playbook but you were improvising! How could you make something that was sheer fiction so real? You made it look like I really did something that left you aflame with indignation!

Xiao Fengxu looked around through the corners of his eyes. Even though the onlookers didn’t wear obvious expressions, he could tell that they were eyeing him strangely.

What the heck...

“Don’t slander me. What have I done?!” Xiao Fengxu was quivering with rage.

Su Ping sneered. “You know what you did!”

Of course, he wouldn’t spell out the details. It would limit the onlookers’ imagination.

“You. You!”

Xiao Fengxu bit his teeth. All of a sudden, he turned to Shi Haochi, Chen, and Dai Lemao. “Sir, is he your family member or student?”

Chen shook his head at once. “No.”

He wouldn’t want to offend the Xiao Family over Su Ping.

Dai Lemao shook his head as well. Shi Haochi tried to mediate the dispute. “Mister Xiao, calm down. Maybe there’s some misunderstanding.”

Xiao Fengxu looked at Shi Haochi who seemed to be the closest to Su Ping. “Sir, is he your student or family member?”

Shi Haochi shook his head. Su Ping was younger than him. However, the more powerful trainer shall be the teacher. Shi Haochi held Su Ping as his equal and as someone with tremendous potential.

“Since he’s not related to either of you in any way, then, I wonder what an elementary level trainer is doing at the master trainer’s conference.” Xiao Fengxu was still filing his teeth.

He shifted the subject. He couldn’t come up with a good explanation for the other issue.

Since Su Ping wanted to turn hostile, then hostility he would get.

Xiao Fengxu had heard Su Ping admitting that he was an elementary level trainer at the stadium.

If it weren’t for the fact that he couldn’t figure out the relationship between Su Ping and the three master trainers, Xiao Fengxu would have called security to get rid of him. He would even suggest Master Ding adding Su Ping’s name to the blacklist!

Back then, when Su Ping left, Xiao Fengxu went to the Traffic Bureau. He knew where Su Ping was going but he was too late. As luck would have it, they met again. There was no way that Xiao Fengxu was going to let Su Ping go.

The onlookers then turned to Shi Haochi.

Shi Haochi was confused as to where Xiao Fengxu had heard about the elementary level trainer matter. “Mister Xiao, Brother Su is not tagging along. He has an invitation but he lost it. He is a master trainer, our special guest.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

His words silenced everyone.

Zhenxiang, Tongtong, and Dai Lemao were the ones who reacted less emphatically because they had already heard the story. Still, they were still having doubts about Su Ping.

They had all heard what Xiao Fengxu had said.

Elementary level trainer? Really?

Zhenxiang and Tongtong looked at their father with worry.

Dai Lemao and Chen looked at each other. They wished to talk but stopped on second thought. Eventually, they heaved a sigh and decided not to reason with Shi Haochi.

They could not understand why Shi Haochi would trust Su Ping like that.

“He is a... master trainer?”

Ding Fengchun stared at Su Ping in disbelief.

The two middle-aged men and the fair lady standing behind him were wondering if Shi Haochi had said the wrong words.

The many students were staring with their mouths agape. None of them could believe this.

A master trainer that young?

From another base city?

Not even the Holy Light Base City, the incubator of trainers, had witnessed the birth of such a young master trainer. Was Shi Haochi sure that he wasn’t making a joke?

Hu Rongrong stood in a daze. Her ears had clearly heard Su Ping say he was an elementary trainer. Su Ping sounded sincere back then.

She could not figure out why the master trainer believed Su Ping was a fellow master trainer.

It never occurred to Xiao Fengxu that this would be the answer he would get. “Master Shi... did you just say that he’s a master trainer?”

Shi Haochi knew how unreasonable it sounded and how hard it was to accept. “Brother Su has never taken any tests but he has trained pets in a way that is too difficult for even master trainers to manage. Do not belittle Brother Su Ping just because of his age. Age does not matter.”

Xiao Fengxu suddenly broke into laughter.

At first, he had just tried to get rid of Su Ping and teach him a lesson.

However, faking to be a master trainer was not a minor offense. This was a capital crime!

His death would be tragic!

“Master Shi, you have been fooled by his glib-tongued lies!” Xiao Fengxu smiled and continued, “I once heard him admitting that he was an elementary trainer.”

Shi Haochi looked at Su Ping with confusion.

Ding Fengchun shook his head at Shi Haochi to indicate his disappointment.

Su Ping asked Xiao Fengxu, “Then, did you hear me admitting that I was your father?”

The grin froze on Xiao Fengxu’s face.

Enough!

That was enough!

Could you be reasonable!

“Courting death!” Xiao Fengxu glared at Su Ping with a clouded face.

Su Ping was about to say something when he heard a snort. Ding Fengchun squinted his eyes.

“You swear like a trooper. No trainer is like you. Get the hell out. You will no longer be a trainer from this day forward, and you shall be forever disqualified from taking any trainers’ tests!”
