Chapter 1462 Reality and Acting (1)

Su Ping believed that sparring was the fastest way for the two parties to get to know each other.

There were no friends who didn’t fight at one point. Those people wouldn’t understand the relationship between pets and their masters without fighting them.

“The four of you, come here,” said Su Ping to the envoys. The small group approached obediently, acting rather timidly before the alien leader. Even though Su Ping had already concealed his aura, he had left an intimidating impression on them.

“When you go back, ask Basha if she wants to hold a friendly contest with my clansmen, so we can get to know each other better,” said Su

Ping.

The four were rather surprised to hear him call their leader by her name. One of them frowned and said, “Wouldn’t that cause misunderstandings?”

“It won’t,” said Su Ping.

Dazed, the man was about to continue, but his companions stopped him.

“We will report the matter when we return,” said one of them.

Su Ping nodded and then ignored them afterwards; he asked Tang Ruyan to keep them occupied. He then went to see Joanna and handed over the pets he trained, asking her to inform their respective masters to pick them up.

Later he briefly told his master about the friendly contest through telepathic communication, then went back to his secluded training.

“A friendly contest? That’s a good idea, indeed.” Shen Huang agreed with the proposal, as he had the same idea in mind. Now that Su Ping proposed it, it was a good chance to put it into practice.

Shen Huang sent someone to contact the cyborg leader.

Several days later, they reached an agreement about the contest.

Both humans and cyborgs were excited when the news got out. All of them were ready to participate.

Preliminary contests were held to select the candidates in every cyborg city. It was just a “friendly” contest, but nobody wanted to lose face.

Furthermore, only the juniors were going to fight. Nobody would lay any blame if they were too competitive. The losers would only be able to blame their representatives for being too weak.

Therefore, both parties were selecting the strongest representatives of each realm for the battles.

The levels agreed upon by Shen Huang and Basha included the Star State, the Star Lord State, the Ascendant State and the Celestial State. They were like the different weight divisions in boxing matches.

There were different numbers of representatives for each realm. The Celestial State had the fewest. Both parties would only send three people.

There were ten for the Ascendant State, twenty for the Star Lord State, and fifty for the Star State.

While the cyborg cities were fiercely picking their representatives, Shen Huang and the others were picking strong battle pet warriors in each level too. As for the Celestial State, Shen Huang would fight in person as one of the representatives. After all, he was much stronger than other Celestial cultivators after his realm was recovered thanks to Su Ping’s help.

As for the Ascendant State, those representatives were picked from amongst the top Heavenly Lords discipled under the Celestials.

A “friendly” contest indeed, yet they didn’t want to lose.

Half a month later

The friendly contest officially began.

The battlefield was in the cyborgs’ territory; after all, they were the hosts. Shen Huang and the others were glad to see this. The Nine States were similar to their old universe at the moment; it would be troublesome and inconvenient if the battlefield were there, with many cyborgs going there to watch.

In one of the cyborg’s holy capitals

That was where Crowe-one of the three ultimate leaders—lived.

It was relatively close to the Nine States, and was extremely prosperous. The architectural style was rather exotic, but still luxurious and enjoyable.

Shen Huang, Chi Ying and the carefully picked representatives went there.

The friendly contest would be live-streamed to all cyborgs, who could watch the contest in real time.

The Star State battles would take place first.

They were going to be held in a special arena located in the holy capital, which had sufficient reinforcement for Star State battles. The space in the arena had been infinitely expanded, so that the representatives wouldn’t be limited.

“Are they human beings? Their skin colors are so strange.”

“Exactly. There are all sorts of colors. They’re not identical like us.”

“Weren’t we told that they enslave beasts to fight for them? Why don’t I see any beasts near them?”

Everywhere in the world, the cyborgs were watching Shen Huang and the other humans enter the venue.

Basha and the other ultimate leaders were present during the opening ceremony, as were Shen Huang, Chi Ying and other Celestial State cultivators. They would sit at the highest place in the auditorium.

Once the opening speech ended, the contest of the Star State began.

The cyborg candidate who entered the arena raised a round of cheers. He had been picked after rounds in many cities, attracting a lot of fans during the preliminary matches.

“I didn’t think it would be Niwacott. He’s a Star State animal! He defeated someone with his same level with just one hand.”

“I heard that he carries that Original Energy Bloodline.”

All the cyborgs were surprised to see the cyborg participant, not expecting such a strong representative to be sent first.

On the other hand, the candidate sent by the humans was a rather petite girl.

Seeing how slim she was, many cyborgs wondered if Niwacott would be fearful… of accidentally killing her.

It was just a friendly contest anyway. He would be disqualified and punished severely if he killed his opponent!
