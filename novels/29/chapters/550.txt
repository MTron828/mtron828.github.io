Chapter 552 Aggression and Betrayal

“Onward!!” The ninth-rank beasts took the lead and charged their way into the Tang family compound. The other battle pet warriors formed arrays to converge their astral powers. The battle pets they summoned were grouped according to their categories. Some of the battle pets that were of the same family were able to collaboratively unleash some bloodline skills.

Boom_!

The shield over the Tang family compound gave out a loud noise. The bugle of war was sounded.

“Humph. They are early indeed.”

Inside the Tang family compound, an elder crossed his hands behind his back and stood on a platform, looking down on the scene from a high spot.

The enemies were upon them, like surging tides. He could not tell how many there were but he was sure that it was a force prepared to destroy the Tang family.

“I cannot believe it’s you, Brother Three!”

The elder’s eyes flickered in the darkness. If Su Ping were there, he would have recognized that the elder was Tang Mingqing, the one who had visited his store.

His eyes were as sharp as those of a vulture. He dialed a number on his phone; he said with a low voice, “Sir, everything is ready. We’re waiting for your arrival.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Good,” the man answered in a deep voice. In the meantime, the shield over the Tang family compound was getting weaker by the minute. It would be quickly destroyed, given the many battle pet warriors and pets involved in the attack.

While the shield was about to crack, some noises were abruptly heard behind the invaders.

Many fireballs rained down from the sky. The ground trembled as some slops were raised and from them rolled down many boulders.

“Ambush!!”

“The Tactic Army is behind us!”

“Let’s go!”

A leader of the invaders took decisive action; the invading force immediately turned around and charged toward their assailants.

The titled battle pet warriors who had been observing joined in the battle to crush the Tang family assailants. After all, many of the battle pet warriors were also the elite fighters of their respective families.

As the invaders were caught in that fight, the shield over the Tang family compound broke; many battle pets then charged forth from inside the Tang family compound. The battle pets unleashed many types of long-range strikes, making loud noises.

Mist was created; fire was summoned and ice was born.

Glamourous rays of light broke forth in the night sky.

The battle pets snarled and barked, exploring the way. Boom

Bolts of lightning were kindling the night sky.

The invaders looked up, only to see a flock of birds that had a wingspan of more than a dozen meters. The birds flew in the sky, much like floating buildings, and all the birds were Thunder Sparrows!

The Tang family’s Feather Army!

“No, the Thunder Sparrows are collaborating!”

“Listen up! Set up in formation!” “Initiating the Dragon Formation!” The invaders lined up in a special pattern as the orders were issued. They pooled their astral powers together. Instantly, as their astral powers got in sync, a huge shield appeared out of nowhere, right above the invaders; it was a shield as powerful as the one that had been protecting the Tang family compound.

In the meantime, a bolt of lightning of the Thunder Sparrows’ making came crashing down.

That bolt of lightning was hundreds of meters thick. The power surge cut off the electricity supply of half of the Yedou Base City. In the distance further away, some residents even saw electricity sparks in their houses.

Boom!!

The bolt of lightning came whooshing down toward the shield.

Lightning flashed, lighting up the night sky. The radiance was offending to the eyes.

The lighting screamed as if thousands of birds were chattering in an unpleasant way.

Following the bolt of lightning were the strikes from the battle pet warriors. They shot arrows that could pierce through hard materials. The shield was already on the verge of collapsing because the bolt of lightning and the arrows had crushed it completely.

Boom, boom, boom!

Many battle pet warriors were hurt by the arrows.

The casualties were rising among the invaders during that volley of attacks. There was no doubt that the Tang family’s Feather Army gained the upper hand and had inspired awe in their enemies.

“Is that the Feather Army?”

“I thought the Tang family had lost a Feather Army. How come there are still so many of them!?”

“No, this is a mixed bunch. Not all of them are master battle pet warriors!” While the invaders flew into a panic, the titled battle pet warriors among them were able to find the weaknesses of the Feather Army.

The Feather Army entered the fight forcefully, but many of them were just there to make up the numbers. Even though they weren’t weak, they didn’t work well with the master battle pet warriors. It was evident that the Tang family had mobilized members of their other armies to fill up the ranks, because of the previous loss of the Feather Army.

As such, the Feather Army would be less intimidating.

“Brother Feng, how about we have a match? Let’s see which one of us can kill more of them.”

“Sure thing. I do want to see the power of the spear skill in your family!”

The titled battle pet warriors charged toward the Feather Army.

Swirls appeared next to them; they summoned their battle pets and flew to clash with the Feather Army.

The Feather Army was a formidable force, made by two thousand battle pet warriors. That being said, the titled battle pet warriors were not working alone, either. When it came to comparisons, the Feather Army appeared to be quite clumsy.

The titled battle pet warriors tore up the Feather Army’s formation. The members of the Feather Army had to deal with those titled battle pet warriors. “I will go and help them!”

The titled battle pet warriors of the Tang family who were standing in the compound charged forth.

In the meanwhile, Tang Ruyu was standing on high ground, watching and issuing commands.

Right then, a person approached her and she became alerted. She turned around, only to see her father arrive, clad in armor.

But her father was not as sickly as before. Rather, his eyes were full of violence and he was quite vigorous, like a caged beast about to be set free.

“Father... Sir, you wound...” “What wound? Did you think I would foolishly get myself hurt in cultivation?”

Tang Linzhan sneered. He approached Tang Ruyu and said, “The Situ family and the Wang family have been coveting our things for more than six decades. They thought I did not know. Hmm. What? Do they think I’m blind?”

Tang Ruyu was scared pale.

More than sixty decades?

Since she was a kid, she had always been told that the Situ family and the Wang family would battle, just any of the four ancient families would contend against each other.

She had even heard that the Situ family had once killed titled battle pet warriors of the Wang family, and she had seen pictures as proof!

She had thought that the Situ family and Wang family were fierce opponents. But father said that they had been working together for more than six decades!

So, everything she thought was already proven was just for show?

The deceased titled battle pet warriors were “performers”?

She couldn’t help but draw a long breath.

Using titled battle pet warriors’ deaths as part of the show... How cruel could the two families be!

“Go and get your Uncle Three,” Tang Linzhan said.

Tang Ruyu was about to ask why when Tang Linzhan focused his mind on the battle; he would be the person in charge from that moment on. He had to say that Tang Ruyu was to be left in charge on purpose and faked his wound. So, did he suspect there was a traitor in the family?

A glint of coldness flashed past Tang Ruyu’s eyes. She nodded.

Soon, an elder came with Tang Ruyu.

The elder turned pale when he arrived and saw Tang Linzhan.

“Brother Three, come here,” Tang Linzhan said without turning to greet the elder.

The elder was unable to tell if Tang Linzhan was angry.

The elder smiled fawningly at once. “Sir, are you feeling better? I’m so happy. We will be much more assured with you here.” “Come closer.” Tang Linzhan didn’t reply. He repeated his demand.

The elder said yes and stepped over.

However, after two steps, the elder unleashed astral powers and dashed toward Tang Ruyu.

The fawning smile on his face turned into ferocity.

It happened too fast but Tang Ruyu just glared at the elder coldly, as if she had anticipated this. She moved away, only leaving behind a blur on the spot. In the meantime, a shadow appeared; it wielded a sword to face the elder.

“You’re free from my containment. How is it possible?” shouted the elder in surprise.

He was at the upper position of the titled rank. How could Tang Ruyu escape when she was at the eighth rank?

“That was only a dummy version of me. Take a good look.” Tang Ruyu pointed it out. The elder put on a twisted look. He shouted and punched at the shadow, reaching Tang Ruyu directly, trying to land a punch on her face.

“Humph!”

Right then, a person snorted. Before he knew it, Tang Linzhan had put himself in front of Tang Ruyu and blocked that punch in her stead.

The punch landed on him but he remained perfectly still.

A green glow flashed past him.

“Perfectly still!”

The elder cried out shrilly with terror in his

eyes.

Tang Linzhan had reached the top state of the Glass Bulwark.

He could withstand the strikes from ninth-rank beasts with his body alone. Only legendary battle pet warriors or those close to the legendary rank could have hurt him!

When did the current family head of the Tang family reach the top state of the Glass Bulwark? He was merely forty years of age!

Not even the elder could have done that.

“I wanted to give you a chance but you threw it away,” Tang Linzhan declared coldly.

Bang!

He punched out, as quick as lightning. The next second, the terror-stricken elder trembled.

There was a hole on his chest.

His lips trembled. With a bitter expression, the elder murmured, “Sir... please forgive my family...” His voice died down before he could finish his sentence. “You should have realized the price of betrayal.” Tang Linzhan flicked the blood off his hand and went away.

Tang Ruyu stared indifferently at the corpse and the shadow behind her disappeared. Her face was a bit pale. After all, that elder had been at the upper position of the titled rank. She wouldn’t have survived that strike if her father hadn’t stepped in.

While the traitor had been uprooted, things weren’t looking good for the Tang family.

The Situ and Tang families were prepared. They had many titled battle pet warriors while the Tang family’s Feather Army was on the verge of splitting up. The titled battle pet warriors were riding their ninth-rank battle pets, charging all over. The Tang family was losing ground.

Roar!!

Right then, a primitive roar pierced the night

sky.

Every member of the Tang family wore a grave face. Their blood was freezing; they were terrified by that feeling.

Is that a beast king?!

Boom!

A gigantic rhino-like thing appeared. The creature had sharp spikes all over its body. The battle pet warriors of the Situs and the Wangs were making way for it.

That gigantic creature charged toward the Tang family compound.

Several ninth-rank battle pets of the Tang family stopped on their tracks after hearing the creature’s roar. Trembling, the battle pets began to withdraw.

The beat king’s power overwhelmed everyone present. While it ran around as if under orders, those ninth-rank battle pets ran toward the beast king, even though their shaking had not stopped. Bang! Bang! An invisible force in the air crushed almost all the ninth-rank battle pets to death. One of the battle pets that was of the stone family didn’t die at once but was close.

The gates of the Tang family compound fell.

“Sir!”

Tang Ruyu was startled.

On the other hand, Tang Linzhan didn’t appear to be quite surprised. “Get the Ocean Umbrella ready. Let’s kill the beast!”

Tang Ruyu ran off at once...

But before long, Tang Ruyu had returned; she appeared to be agitated. In a hurry, she broke the news, “Father... sir, there’s something wrong with the Ocean Umbrella!”

“What?”

Tang Linzhan was scared by this.

The Ocean Umbrella was their family treasure and heirloom. What could go wrong with it?

The man taking care of the Ocean Umbrella was a person he trusted with his heart and soul.

All of a sudden, a man came shouting in indignation; it was Tang Mingqing. “Sir, it’s Brother Seven. He has turned against us!” Tang Linzhan trembled. He had almost blacked out.

The man I trusted the most betrayed me?

He would have been less surprised if his daughter Tang Ruyu would have been the one to betray the Tang family. He would have never believed that the man he saw as a brother, the one who had saved him from peril so many times, and the one who had almost died for him would betray him!

“No way...”

The voice was hoarse, as if there were a fire in his throat.

But he didn’t sound certain.

“Sir!” Tang Mingqing shouted.

Tang Linzhan came back to his senses but he was still a bit absent-minded. Soon after, sharpness came back to his eyes; he couldn’t allow himself to give in because he was the man in command of the Tang family. “Brother Seven cannot break the Ocean Umbrella or take it away, even if he betrayed us. I’ll go and take a look; you stay here,” he said to Tang Ruyu.

She nodded.

Tang Linzhan ran toward the darkness.
