Chapter 1302 The Lost Power (1)

Qing Mu lost his cool and couldn’t help but exclaim, “This is not possible!”

His dark power came from an ancient and forbidden land; it had been a marvelous weapon that never failed him since he obtained it. Even when he was defeated by other Dao Children, it was due to his shortcomings and not the dark power. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The dark Qing Mu clone was even trickier to deal with than his immortality bloodline.

However, the ever undefeated clone was destroyed by Su Ping!

Aside from Qing Mu, all the other candidates were shocked to see this happen.

Earlier on, they still felt unconvinced. But now they didn’t know what to say about Su Ping.

He had managed to cut the chaos world tree’s projection and the dark Qing Mu in ways they couldn’t understand, accomplishing something that none other could.

“Was that the greatest power you were proud of?” Su Ping looked at Qing Mu coldly after slaying the dark clone. The man was devoid of killing intent, so he didn’t continue attacking. The battle had been a teacher; he found that his path of Heavenly Tribulations countered the creature from beyond the crack.

That creature was somehow related to Qing Mu, but instead of asking him directly, he chose to find more information through the elders.

If the creature beyond the crack was indeed related to Qing Mu’s family, Su Ping would expose his weakness for others to take advantage.

Qing Mu was sobered up by Su Ping’s mockery, but then remained stunned for a moment. In the end, he refocused his attention and glanced at Su Ping. “What was the power you just used?” “You don’t deserve to know,” replied Su Ping.

Qing Mu was speechless, but he also knew that it was probably Su Ping’s trump card. Who would reveal details of their trump cards? He wasn’t angry by the reply. He said peacefully, “I lost. You’re strong enough to challenge the Dao Children, and beat them even. Good luck.”

Seeing how casual he was, Su Ping raised his eyebrows and asked, “Was the power you just used a core secret technique of your family?”.

Qing Mu glanced at Su Ping. How did you answer my question just now?

“It was a lucky find; it has nothing to do with my family,” replied Qing Mu. He wasn’t angry with Su Ping, but he wouldn’t reveal the source of his power, either.

Su Ping felt dazed for a moment; the guy didn’t seem to be lying. He was actually quite delighted… After all, the man was from a high-ranked clan supported by an Ancestral God; however bold he was, he couldn’t challenge the authority of such a being. If the man’s family truly wanted to invade his universe, he would have no choice but to keep a low profile in his store and cultivate.

Qing Mu stayed silent after that. He turned around and left.

The battle ended just like that. The Dao Child competition also ended.

The three remaining candidates were all silent. They didn’t blame Qing Mu, as they could tell that Qing Mu had used his strongest moves; it had to be said that Su Ping was more extraordinary than expected.

“When was such a genius born from the human clan? They’re truly lucky!” Some people’s eyes were glittering; they found it hard to believe.

“He’s truly capable of doing that…”

Tan Xiangyun gazed at Su Ping on the battlefield, her anger gradually receding. Su Ping’s capabilities were proof enough that listening to her elementary lecture would be of no use. She would have left early too if she were him, as it would have been a waste of time to stay.

“I wonder which Dao Child he’s going to challenge!” said someone in the audience to begin speculating about the odds of Su Ping defeating a Dao Child. Considering the strength he displayed, he had at least a 50% chance of becoming a Dao Child.

There was no telling which one of the Dao Children he would challenge.

There were three of them, but their strengths varied.

No one knew the specifics; however, everyone knew that one of the Dao Children had kept the title ever since they were admitted to the institute. Not once had the post been snatched.

“Old Toad’s eyes are truly keen. This man is truly capable of becoming a Dao Child!”

All the elders had noticed Su Ping’s extraordinary talent. They were also able to glean that the technique used to destroy Qing Mu’s dark clone had been inspired by Heavenly Tribulations.

Even though they understood, they didn’t grasp the concept as profoundly as Su Ping had.

The knowledge they had about tribulations was enough to destroy Qing Mu’s dark power. Some had studied and concluded that they were of the same origin, so they could destroy each other.

“He’s bold, smart, and he has a hefty stack of trump cards. Not bad!” said Yan Huang who stood at the center. She had always been taciturn; such an extensive remark was surprising to anyone who knew her.

An elder chuckled and said, “Looks like Senior Sister Yan Huang thinks very highly of this human genius.”

Yan Huang replied casually, “Why? You don’t think highly of him?”

“Surely you jest, Senior sister. This guy’s potential is unquestionable; I heard that he’s not a real God King yet…” The elder chuckled and his eyes became solemn.

The others listened in silence. Their eyes lit up.

The most candidates were God Kings; it was normal for them to grasp a universe

And yet, Su Ping had defeated them while being a realm lower. He was much more talented than normal candidates; even the current Dao Children would be hard pressed when compared to him.

However, potential was just potential. Su Ping’s level was lower when he challenged the Dao Children, which would place him at a disadvantage.
