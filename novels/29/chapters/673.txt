Chapter 675 Destruction

A deadly silence prevailed in the intelligence station.

The well-trained frontline workers-people with strong psychological endurance-were in great panic.

The Nordic Continent... had been destroyed!

An entire continent was destroyed!

The two to three billion people in all its base cities had become food for the wild beasts!

Only a few legendary battle pet warriors and some of the more powerful titled battle pet warriors had managed to escape. The others were gone. The base cities had become lairs for the wild beasts.

No one would have believed such news, were it not for the fact that the source of information couldn’t be faked.

The silence lasted for a long time. The leader of the intelligence station, one at the peak of the titled rank, was the one who came back to his senses first after their stupor. “Tell the Tower right away. Also, send this information to the legendary battle pet warriors of the three defense lines directly. Use the secret channel for emergency communication. Call them directly and do not tell anyone else!” The entire Subcontinent District would fall into chaos once a shocking piece of news of such magnitude was revealed to the public.

The general public would lose all hope; they would be capable of unthinkable things and when they became desperate.

The frontline workers then snapped out of their shock. Although pale from the scare, they began to comply with the orders and relayed the information.

The head office of the three defense lines of the Subcontinent District received the news in no time. The legendary battle pet warriors were struck dumb after they saw the content. One continent was destroyed! It was gone, quietly. They had heard nothing that could have forewarned them of this!

They didn’t even receive any calls for help!

It turned out that destruction could befall them faster than they thought!

“So... Would this be the end of humanity?”

At the Xue-Yang Defense Line, an old lady at the legendary rank was standing in a pavilion. She gazed into the deep night sky; it was so deep and dark it was suffocating.

“Those wild beasts gathered at the Nordic...” An old man with gray hair was sitting in his study in the office at the Sheng-Long Defense Line.

He was Yuan Tianchen, the commander-in-chief of the Sheng-Long Defense Line.

He had learned from the master of the Tower that the number of beasts at the Fate State was eight. He knew that the strike was large in scale. And yet, the strike was even more intimidating than he had expected.

He remembered that the Nordic Continent used to have three legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State in command.

However, the news said that only one of them had escaped; the other two had passed away!

The one who got out went back to get treatment in the Tower.

However... Once the other continents collapsed one by one, the Tower would eventually have to face the strike as well. Where could they go to by then?

I think I have to think of a backup plan. I cannot just sit here and wait for death. I am just glad that she has left and the academy has come in time. It’s just that...

Yuan Tianchen felt sorry and happy at the same time. He was happy that his granddaughter had left the hellish place the Blue Planet was; at the same time he felt sorry because the people from the academy could have saved them easily but they ignored the crisis. He had been unable to beg them to help, because they could end up getting impatient; he might have been killed by them before the beasts even got to him.

A hideout... I think that Mysterious Realm will do, Yuan Tianchen thought. The Blue Planet was not a large one, but there were many spatial fractures in the barren areas. Some of the spatial fractures would lead to lost worlds and Mysterious Realms.

Those Mysterious Realms were spacious; he could easily find a place to hide.

“The Nordic Continent... is gone.”

At the Xing-Jing Defense Line, a middle-aged legendary battle pet warrior fell to his chair. He had just heard the message.

The entire Nordic Continent was gone!

There was a dull look on his face. Many thoughts flashed past his eyes in a single second, but he reacted fast enough. He thought of a man.

“I have to tell him!”

He knew that the young man was the true protector of the Xing-Jing Defense Line. That young man deserved to know this important news.

Longjiang Base City.

Pixie Pet Store.

Su Ping poured some water for Joanna and asked with a chuckle, “So, you and me, alone in a room in the middle of the night... and yet we’re talking about formations. Do you think people will buy this?”

Joanna grabbed the mug and rolled her eyes. “I cannot understand how you can make jokes at this time. It’s your home planet that is suffering.”

“No matter how dire the situation is, I cannot lose the ability to make jokes. It won’t get any worse,” Su Ping replied with a smile.

Joanna drank the water. “I think you’ll be able to master the knowledge in two days, based on your progress. You’ll manage to learn it in three days... I am a good teacher.”

“Huh, you don’t say.”

Beep!

Su Ping received a call.

The smile vanished from his face.

“Mr. Su.” Xie Jinshui’s voice was trembling. “I, I just heard this. Something happened!” “What happened?” Somehow, Su Ping thought of what he had seen in the depths of the Deep Caves.

“The Nordic Continent... is gone!”

Xie Jinshui broke the news to him, “The entire continent is gone! I heard that only two or three legendary battle pet warriors were able to get out! All the base cities are gone. They were occupied by the wild beasts!” Su Ping was livid. Why was he not surprised?

He knew it would happen.

He knew that based on the wild beasts he had seen in the Deep Caves; that global beast strike would be critical.

“I see,” Su Ping said with a heavy mind.

He thought of those people from the Federation who had left during the day. He clenched his fists and rage was coming back to him. However, he didn’t vent his anger this time.

The Nordic Continent was dominated the moment those people left. That was not a coincidence!

Su Ping would never underestimate the intelligence of wild beasts. Some beast kings that had been cultivating for hundreds of years could be as scheming as humans.

He even suspected that the wild beasts were also able to get information from humans.

“Mr. Su, the legendary battle pet warrior in charge of the Xing-Jing Defense Line is coming to see you.” Xie Jinshui’s fear was relieved by a small degree. Su Ping had said only a few words, but somehow, the sound of Su Ping’s voice had calmed him down

“I will tell the guards to keep an eye on the barren area. Mr. Su, this time...”

“We will get through this!”

Before Xie Jinshui could finish, Su Ping had cut him off with a confident attitude.

Confidence was what he needed! As well as determination!

They would lose all hope if they allowed themselves to suffer mental breakdowns before the battle!

Su Ping’s words dispersed all the confusion and fear in Xie Jinshui’s mind. He took a deep breath and said, “I cannot believe I have to be comforted by you at this hour. Mr. Su, I feel mortified, but I know what I should do. Whatever happens, I will be there with everyone and we will fight till the last second!”

“Yes.”

Su Ping nodded.

He hung up and looked outside the store.

A legendary battle pet warrior was flying toward him through the night sky.

Soon enough, that legendary battle pet warrior arrived at the store. It was Mr. Lu, the one in charge of the Xing-Jing Defense Line.

“Mr. Su.”

Su Ping nodded. “The mayor told me... This is not a joking matter. The Deep Caves have been quiet for years and many vicious beasts have come into being. There are far more beast kings at the Fate State than you can imagine. You must pay attention to all the information. You won’t even have time to ask for help if you don’t make preparations for when the wild beasts arrive.”

Mr. Lu looked rugged. The composure that the young man assumed boosted his confidence. Mr. Lu then promised, “I’ll make sure of that. I won’t worry now that you know about this, Mr. Su. You can call me directly if you think of anything. Here’s my number.” “Okay.”

Su Ping saved Mr. Lu’s number in his phone.

After some deliberation, Su Ping suggested, “I would suggest re-organizing the base cities along the defensive line. The smaller the area is, the easier it’ll be for us to protect the people.”

Mr. Lu replied, “I will find a way. I know that most people would be unwilling to leave their homes but these are desperate times. They have to obey.”

Su Ping nodded.

The general public didn’t know the severity of the matter just yet.

They knew that the strike was serious and the ensuing disaster was grave, but they didn’t know that the entire world was suffering. Once people knew that, their panic could lead to something worse.

Mr. Lu left and Su Ping went back inside.

“We don’t have enough legendary battle pet warriors. I wish we had a way to make titled battle pet warriors reach the legendary rank directly.” Su Ping heaved a sigh.

Joanna heard that. “There are ways. It’s just that the price is heavy.”

“What?”

Su Ping was surprised.

“Of course, the legendary rank is not a big deal. That is just the first step to leave the mortal life form for us gods. The difficult thing is to reach the Star Rank.”

Joanna then said, “There are several fruits that I know of which can help a creature evolve from the mortal form.”

“What...”

Su Ping blinked.

Knowledge was power!

Joanna was well-informed and he could never compare to her. After all, she was from the Demigod Burial and her original self was a god.

“Do you have any such fruits?” Su Ping asked at once.

Joanna rolled her eyes at him. “You’re using me again.”

“You’re the wealthy lady, well, a goddess.” Su Ping grinned.

“Hear me out.” Joanna snorted. “Of those fruits, apart from one that is called the Original Test Fruit, the others have side effects. However... the Original Test Fruit is extremely rare.”

“The other fruits can help a person break free from the mortal form, but since the person would skip Heaven’s Test and would have to suffer the side effects, the person’s talent would plummet and would be weaker compared with others of the same rank. Of course, for people in wealthy families who don’t have the least bit of talent, taking such fruits is OK. But other than those people, rarely would anyone do this.” Su Ping was startled. “Do you have an Original Test Fruit?”

“No,” Joanna answered quickly. She gave him a glance through the corner of her eye. “I would have given it to you if I had any.” Su Ping felt a spread of warmth in his heart.

She sounded angry but her answer was gentle.

“How about the other fruits?” Su Ping said, “It’s okay that they have side effects. I can fetch some people at the titled rank, those who can’t reach the legendary rank on their own because of lacking potential. As such, those fruits would be priceless for them.”

“That is true.”

Joanna nodded. “But I only have two. After all, they don’t have any use to me so I didn’t think of collecting them.”

“That’s good enough,” Su Ping said at once.

Good enough.

He could help two people reach the legendary rank. He didn’t care about those two people’s combat strength. He cared about the fact that legendary battle pet warriors could establish contracts with more and better battle pets!

A legendary battle pet warrior at the Ocean State could have battle pets at the Void State! Eleven of them!

He could allocate twenty-two Void State beast kings if he could get two fruits!

The two legendary battle pet warriors would be like carriers of battle pets. Su Ping would ask the two to sign contracts with new battle pets so that the battle pets could go and fight!

That would be twenty-two battle pets at the Void State! It was equal to 22 legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State!

“Sure.”

Joanna did not refuse. She didn’t need the fruits anyway. Besides, she had recently been seeing herself as part of Su Ping’s family.

Joanna cautioned him, “I suggest you give someone else the fruits. They won’t be good for you.” Seeing the excitement in Su Ping’s eyes, she was worried he would get carried away.

Su Ping was startled. “Why is that?”

“This fruit is used to break the barrier. Using this fruit to reach the legendary rank would not bring you benefits. Your potential will be limited; that kind of fruit is only helpful to those that are weak to being with,” Joanna explained.

Su Ping nodded. “I understand.”

He wasn’t planning on eating that fruit. That was like pulling up seedlings to help them grow and it wouldn’t be worthwhile.

“Should we go and get them now?”

“Yes, please.” Su Ping nodded. He asked the system to send them to the Demigod Burial.

Half an hour later, a swirl opened up.

Su Ping and Joanna went back to the store. Half a day in the Demigod Burial, but only half an hour in real life.

“Have you thought about who you want to give the fruits to?” Joanna asked Su Ping.

Su Ping replied, “Not yet. They would have to be people that I trust.” He had to give the fruits to those he could confide in...

But there weren’t many titled warriors he could trust. He knew Qin Shuhai but he thought the man had great potential. He would be able to reach the legendary rank by himself when the time was right. Giving him the fruit would not benefit him.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
