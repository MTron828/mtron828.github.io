Chapter 648 Poaching

“That man knows all the details. I don’t think we should allow him to enter the base city, not to mention the head office of the Trainers Association...” Legend Riverside said with a frown. The commander-in-chief seemed to disagree. “But Brother Lu seems to trust that man. Brother Lu is a top trainer. He should be able to tell if that man is a beast in disguise...”

“What if Brother Lu cannot tell for certain? Do you know how big of a problem that would be?” Legend Riverside snorted. He didn’t feel comfortable about the situation.

Su Ping hadn’t taken any credit from anyone, but Legend Riverside was not okay with a man boasting

Also, Su Ping was quite suspicious. How had he managed to know all about their intel!

“I still think there has to be a reasonable explanation. I don’t think Mr. Su is a beast in disguise,” the commander-in-chief continued, “If he were, he wouldn’t have told us all the details and we wouldn’t have questioned his identity. Why would he bring all that up if he were a beast? I wouldn’t make any sense.”

Legend Riverside was tongue-tied. He could not answer the question.

“Brother Su, is everything fine at the Longjiang Base City?” Lu Qiu asked with concern, “The entire world is in trouble. I heard that something happened at the Deep Caves and a lot of beast kings got out. This strike is a case in point... It is a first for us to have seen a strike with a dozen beast kings or more. It was as if they had merely come out from nowhere.”

Su Ping shook his head at the question. “Longjiang is currently out of trouble. We also have legendary battle pet warriors; we can figure something out if something were to go wrong. I believe the Longjiang Base City is the safest place in the world. “You can come with me if you guys want to relocate to Longjiang. We can take care of each other,” Su Ping advised.

Su Ping was serious but Lu Qiu didn’t understand the reason for that proposal.

Longjiang was the safest place in the world?

It was only a Class B base city, while the Holy Light Base City had been a Class A base city for a long time. They would have survived a strike with one or two beast kings, without any help from the Tower.

On the other hand, one beast king would mean disaster for a Class B base city!

“I want to make you the same offer. I can make arrangements if you want to relocate to the Holy Light Base City,” Lu Qiu said. “I’m being serious,” Su Ping said grumpily, “It would have been impossible for that Ocean State Warrior to stop those twelve beast kings and the other wild beasts if I hadn’t shown up, and I’m not saying this because I underestimate him or anything. The Tower would have had to send another legendary battle pet warrior over to give him a hand.

“But, you also know that since the entire world is in trouble, the Tower has too many problems to deal with at the moment. They don’t have warriors to spare.”

Lu Qiu understood that.

“Brother Su, tell me the truth. Were you serious about the twelve beast kings?” Lu Qiu asked.

Su Ping didn’t know what to say. “I finished them myself. Do you think I cannot count? Additions and subtractions within a hundred are not a problem for me.”

“...” Lu Qiu didn’t know what to say.

This is not a math problem!

It’s about whether you could actually handle that many beast kings!

You’re just at the titled rank!

Which titled battle pet warrior is able to kill twelve beast kings?

Su Ping knew he wasn’t getting through to Lu Qiu from the looks of it. Lu Qiu’s mind had limited his vision. Su Ping could only blame the fact that he was just too outstanding.

“Brother Lu, I’m telling you this because I see you as a friend,” Su Ping said, “The situation is very complicated and the problem at the Deep Caves is a lot more serious than you think. I took care of today’s strike, but they may try again another day!

“And the second strike will be more intense!”

“By then, the Holy Light Base City won’t be able to handle it! Being a friend, I would hate to see you suffer.”

Su Ping was sincere.

After a moment of stupor, Lu Qiu whispered, “Do you know some inside information?”

“Kind of.”

“Can you tell me?”

“I have already told you. All in all, we are in great danger and the beasts will not give up so easily. The Tower might not be able to handle it,” Su Ping cautioned him.

Lu Qiu narrowed his eyes in fear. “Not even the Tower? I don’t believe it. The Tower is a global organization of legendary battle pet warriors. Not even all the legendary battle pet warriors working together can solve this issue?” Su Ping shook his head.

Lu Qiu turned pale after seeing Su Ping shake his head without hesitation.

He no longer spoke.

They hurried on, soon arriving at the Association’s office building. The streets outside were crowded; many people were standing in lines near the front gate.

Many trainers were hurrying to and fro among the buildings.

The base city was still under a state of emergency. Only warriors and army vehicles could be seen on the streets.

“We’re here. I’m going to find you some study materials. How many do you need?”

Lu Qiu decided to set the beast strikes and the relocation matters aside after they arrived.

Su Ping no longer talked about those pressing issues, either. He had said more than enough.

“The more the better,” Su Ping said.

As far as he could tell, the Holy Light Base City could collapse at any moment; those study materials could end up buried or destroyed. He would rather take away as many with him as possible.

And what about staying there to protect the Holy Light Base City?

No, no way.

Longjiang needed him. Besides, based on what he had seen in the Deep Caves, whether he could save Longjiang or not was still a question. Maybe in the end he would only be able to protect the neighboring streets around his store.

War was coming; there was only so much that Su Ping could do. It was unrealistic to only rely on his own power to save everyone.

At that very moment, there might be base cities around the world where many were dying and weeping in sorrow.

The war had affected the world. There was no paradise on the Blue Planet. “Well...” Lu Qiu said, “If you want to ask for more, you can trade with your own training method materials... One for ten. Is that okay with you?”

“I just want the free stuff.”

IL11

“Three copies then. I will use my merit points to get them for you and you can come back for others after you finish the three.” Lu Qiu forced a smile.

“Sure thing.”

...

They flew across the crowd.

All of a sudden, Su Ping saw a line; there were a few people wearing trainer uniforms at the very front.

The two girls.

Su Ping saw two familiar faces; he immediately recognized them. “Brother Lu, wait for a moment,” Su Ping said.

Lu Qiu stopped.

Su Ping flew toward the line.

“It is you. Where’s your dad?” Su Ping asked the two girls.

Their father was Shi Haochi, the man who had once helped him. It was Zhenxiang and Tongtong.

The two girls were quite surprised to see Su Ping descend from the sky. “What, what are you doing here?”

“Why? I shouldn’t be here?”

“That’s not what I meant. I thought you had gone back... Are you here to help?”

Shi Zhenxiang finally found her tongue. She was gladly surprised.

Su Ping nodded. “What are you doing? Where’s your dad?”

“He’s in a meeting. We’re here to help,” Tongtong said with a chuckle.

Su Ping said to the two girls, “I’ll be going back soon. Do you want to go with me to the Longjiang Base City? It is safer there.” “Safer?”

Shi Zhenxiang eyed him with confusion. “But that is only a Class B base city, right? We would happily go but your base city is not safe at all. Why don’t you come here? We have a legendary battle pet warrior in the Holy Light Base City, since we’ve been paying fees to the Tower. The Tower will focus on us, you should stay here instead.”

Su Ping repeated himself for the girls’ sake, “This isn’t necessarily safe. Think about it. If you want to, come meet me later and bring your dad with you.”

“You’re not making any sense. We will not leave. In any case, the Holy Light Base City is on the verge of enduring great disasters. We cannot leave.” Shi Zhenxiang was determined.

Tongtong nodded along.

Su Ping knew he couldn’t persuade them like that, so he tried something else. “Your problems have been solved but the Longjiang Base City needs more assistance. Are you willing to go and help?” “Solved? How? The wild beasts haven’t arrived yet.” Tongtong’s eyes were wide open. “She’s right.”

“It is true. You’ll receive the news soon enough,” Su Ping said.

The two girls were still full of questions while the closeby onlookers were startled. The problem had been solved? But we were just getting ready to fight!

“Has the Tower sent another legendary battle pet warrior?” Shi Zhenxiang asked.

Su Ping offered a silent smile. “We will go if the Holy Light Base City is safe, but I don’t think we can be of much help. We can help train battle pets for free and strengthen them. But there’s only so much that we can do...” Tongtong said. “Yeah.” Zhenxiang nodded in agreement. Su Ping heaved a sigh inwardly. These sisters are so nice. Offering help, without any strings attached.

“It’s a deal. I will go and find your dad later,” Su Ping said.

After saying their goodbyes, he went back to where Lu Qiu was.

“Are you sure that you want to take them away with you?” Lu Qiu frowned. He didn’t approve of Su Ping’s actions.

Longjiang would be more dangerous than the Holy Light Base City. Su Ping’s offer did more harm than good..

Lu Qiu was unable to understand why Su Ping was doing that.

“I can give you two rare battle pets if the Longjiang Base City needs assistance,” Lu Qiu said.

He didn’t know Su Ping well enough to give him rare battle pets for free. After all, each rare battle pet was valuable, but this was war; they should help each other at this time. He valued Su Ping and would hate for him to suffer misfortune.

Su Ping heaved a sigh. “Brother Lu, I’m serious. Think about my offer. The Longjiang Base City is safer. Trust me.”

Lu Qiu produced a forced smile. “I won’t leave even if it’s true. This is where I grew up, my home. I want to be buried here when I die, not somewhere else.”

Su Ping knew that there was nothing else he could do.

A short while later, Lu Qiu took Su Ping to the Association’s library.

He told Su Ping to wait outside while he went to pick the study materials for him.

Once he returned, Su Ping placed the materials in his storage space, then they went to find Shi Haochi.

“They’re having a meeting. I forgot to tell you that. Our Chairman has just exited his most recent seclusion and is right by the door of becoming a Holy Spirit Trainer. I spoke to our Chairman about you; he has a great opinion about you. You’ve come at a good time. Talk to him; he may give you some inspiration. You may also become a Holy Spirit Trainer in the future!” Lu Qiu said gaily.

Su Ping was surprised. Holy Spirit Trainer?

Holy Spirit Trainers could inspire battle pets and make them intelligent!

That was something similar to what the Enlightening Guide could do.

To be exact, Su Ping was already a Holy Spirit Trainer.

He had already tried the Enlightening Guide when he participated in the competition back then. It was just that no one connected him to a Holy Spirit Trainer, and he only realized that after he went back.

“Well, we will talk about that later. If the Chairman agrees to it, I hope he can relocate to the Longjiang Base City. That will facilitate our discussion,” Su Ping said.

Lu Qiu did not know what to say.

Su Ping is thinking about poaching the Chairman?!

Discussion?

Didn’t you hear what I said? The Chairman is going to become a Holy Spirit Trainer. You should learn from the Chairman, not... discuss with him.

Lu Qiu was speechless. He realized that the stunning fact he had just revealed had not amazed Su Ping in the slightest.

Lu Qiu shook his head. He didn’t want to argue about it.

“I’ll take you to Shi Haochi,” Lu Qiu said. He led Su Ping to a tall building where the important meetings were held. The seal around the building would continue to stand even if a bunch of ninth-rank beasts were to strike it for an hour! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

That was a critical location for the Association.

Su Ping immediately sensed that dozens of eighth and ninth-rank battle pet warriors were gathered on one floor. As a matter of fact, they should be called trainers. Their astral powers weren’t condensed enough when compared to the actual eighth and ninth-rank battle pet warriors.

“I’ll go in and let them know,” Lu Qiu said.

Su Ping nodded.

Lu Qiu left; soon after, many people came out from the building along with him. There was a man with white hair and a white robe. There wasn’t a speck of dust on him. He was a man who seemed not to belong to that world.

It was an educated and graceful old man.

“Sir, this is Mr. Su,” Lu Qiu introduced.

He then turned to Su Ping. “My original intent was for you to go and meet the Chairman, but as you can see, our Chairman is not a man of formalities. He decided he could come to you instead. Don’t tell him what you just told me. No more nonsense.”

Su Ping sized the Chairman up and replied to Lu Qiu, “That was not nonsense. I’m serious.”
