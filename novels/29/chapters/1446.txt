Chapter 1447 Universe of Machines (1)

With everything reaching that point, it was simply too late to talk about the past events. Su Ping only felt deeply regretful; after all, too many lives had been sacrificed in the universe because of the barrier’s decay.

After reviewing the guy’s legacy memories, Su Ping simply extracted the recorded techniques and summoned Kayafollet’s consciousness to interpret them for her benefit.

The guy’s Dao Heart was Eternal Fighting. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As long as his soul and body remained, he could continue fighting. It was an eternity of sorts.

Without a doubt, it was an extremely powerful Dao Heart.

No wonder his body was still so determined to fight, years and years after his demise.

“Too many stories must’ve taken place in our universe; it’s just that they were lost in time and nobody knows about them…” Su Ping mumbled.

Kayafollet was able to understand at a very quick pace, all thanks to his teaching and interpretation. She had basically been teaching herself thus far, but now she had the guidance of a teacher. Her improvement was fast and tangible.

A long while later

Once she fully digested the legacy, Su Ping resumed the normal speed of time and switched the test room into a desolate planet, just like he did for Chi Ying. He then said, “I’ll help you with your Heavenly Tribulation. Be careful.”

“Yes, master.”

There was even more awe and respect in Kayafollet’s eyes; Su Ping became as great as a god in her eyes.

He flew up to the high sky and summoned a tribulation aura; dark clouds gathered soon after.

She polished her body with the lightning striking down. Her own aura became sharper and more condensed, and she gradually released the aura of a universe dominator.

Kayafollet became a real universe dominator by the end of the tribulation.

After appraising the second dominator that emerged thanks to him, Su Ping patted her shoulder and checked her memories again. He was able to confirm that everything was fine, right before he taught her stealth techniques he learned from the Heaven Path Institute.

Su Ping planned to set off with her when everything was ready.

“Master, I will try my best,” she said with a solemn expression.

Su Ping nodded. “You must be very careful.”

“Okay!”

The pair went back to the palace. The Celestials gathered after receiving the news.

Only three days had passed since Su Ping left with Kayafollet. Everyone sensed that the former Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin was emitting such a terrifying aura that their hair was standing on end. It was just as when they saw Chi Ying.

“A dominator!”

Chi Ying knew she was as strong as him, from the moment he saw her. It was quite shocking for him. Only three days had passed; it was long enough for a Celestial cultivator to transform into a dominator. That was Su Ping’s terrifying ability.

Some Celestials withdrew their surprise and spoke in awe, “Boss Su, you’ve worked hard.”

Su Ping gently waved a hand, showing that Kayafollet was free to go.

Shen Huang spoke after she left, “We’ve prepared some exploration equipment able to transmit the views she saw through the gaps found on the universe’s barrier live. If a few special conditions were met, she could even sever the transmission and record videos for us to watch when she returns.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping nodded and said to Kayafollet, “You can find your universe first.. You may hide your equipment in your universe first; your primary mission is to hide yourself, while the second one is to investigate. Understand?”

“Yes, master.” Kayafollet felt warm. She nodded obediently.

Shen Huang gave the equipment to Kayafollet; all the experts witnessed as she left their last land of hope with everyone’s expectation for that unknown, dust-like universe.

Guided by Su Ping, she soon found a vulnerable part on the barrier protecting the unknown universe and quietly broke in.

The former returned to the palace and waited for updates with the others.

After all, accidents could take place at any time.

Everybody saw a live feed sent by her equipment as she went in. Based on what they saw, Kayafollet was flying in quiet space; the stars in that universe were quite dim, and only some flickering lights could be seen. It seemed that the stars found there were sparse.

Everybody’s heart was tight; they were nervously observing the feed.

Kayafollet carefully approached one of the lights.

Su Ping could only watch; there wasn’t any feedback other than the visuals. However, Kayafollet was able to sense more through the Original Dao World, which couldn’t be captured by any equipment.

The light became gradually clearer as she moved closer. It turned out to be a planetary system. There were dozens of glowing planets around the star, their lights reflecting upon each other. The planetary system was quietly spinning and moving forward in space. There were dozens of planets in it. The smallest planet was like a meteor, while the biggest was even larger than the sun. She lingered outside the astral object for a moment before she pressed forward.

She obviously didn’t detect any lives in that system.

The images captured by the equipment were unable to show more details of the planets from such a far distance. None of them expected that one of the few planetary systems in that universe was actually desolate.
