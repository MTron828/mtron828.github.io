Chapter 633 Form Divine Body

The onlookers were surprised that Su Ping was still standing on the twig. What is the foreign creature doing, waiting here?

Diqiong and Su Ping suddenly disappeared. They seemed to have been teleported to another place.

Some Golden Crows seemed to have understood. They shifted their attention away from that foreign creature.

The trial for the Golden Crows continued.

In the meantime, in a different place.

Countless stars were shining and a primitive river of energy was traversing the sky, emitting a surging breath. On the ground stood a massive skeleton that extended into the distance.

Diqiong and Su Ping appeared on the skeleton. The wind was chilly; strong as Su Ping’s body was, he was about to tremble due to the cold. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He gazed into the distance. There seemed to be a snow mountain in front of him, but upon a closer look, he realized it was actually a piece of bone.

He didn’t know where he was. It most likely was some important, off-limit location for the Golden Crows. Being familiar with this place, Diqiong was neither surprised nor uncomfortable. Diqiong began to explain to Su Ping, “This is our race’s Forbidden Land.”

Diqiong knew that the Chief Elder must have recognized Su Ping and wanted to befriend

him.

After all, the Golden Crows had no idea what the world outside the Celestial Star was like. They knew, however, it was not a peaceful time and the exterior was in turmoil. The Golden Crows were unwilling to get involved in a brawl; that was why they chose to close the star. Still, some battles would come to their doors regardless.

To be prepared for the future, it was necessary to befriend a descendant of a Heaven Master that had purposefully approached them. “A Forbidden Land?”

Su Ping was perplexed. Before Diqiong could elaborate, a ray of golden light suddenly appeared out of thin air in front of them. The ray of golden light eventually revealed a Golden Crow.

This crow was not large compared to the others, but it was still massive, as far as Su Ping was concerned.

“You have passed our trial. Thus, you’re entitled to the rewards.”

It was the Chief Elder. Its voice was refined.

Su Ping was surprised. This is the Chief Elder? The one that I could only see the lower half of?

After the Chief Elder finished talking, a cloud of light suddenly appeared in front of Su Ping. Then, the light became muddy; it was difficult to look at it directly, and was basically indescribable. The light seemed to be full of countless colors; it produced an eerie and bizarre feeling.

Su Ping felt as if a beast were waking up in front of him.

“That is heaven’s blood!”

The Chief Elder said, “The heaven’s blood has been purified; all of its prior will has been stripped off of it!”

If the blood had been freshly harvested from said “heaven,” not even Diqiong, lest Su Ping, would be able to use it. The heaven’s will in the blood would tear them apart!

“You’re learning our skill and we consider that you now have part of our bloodline. This heaven’s blood will inspire your potential. If you do have the potential to have a divine body, that potential will also be inspired...” the Chief Elder said.

Su Ping still had his head in the mud. He simply knew that the item was precious.

“Thank you, Chief Elder.”

“You don’t have to thank me,” the Chief Elder said. The cloud of murky light suddenly smashed into Su Ping’s chest and seeped in.

Su Ping’s body trembled; he felt like his chest was being torn. Something squeezed in forcibly. Then there was an extremely cold feeling... It seemed that the blood all over his body had frozen, but after that, it was an extremely hot sensation, as if his entire body was about to burn to a crisp.

That contradictory and complex feeling made Su Ping endure a little bit of pain.

Soon, that boiling sensation receded and turned into a numb sensation. Su Ping’s entire body was paralyzed; he could not feel a thing and only his consciousness remained.

“Focus...” the Chief Elder said. Su Ping felt that voice was very far away from him.

There was an odd alternation of light and shadow in front of Su Ping and then he appeared in a turbid world. That world was empty, only some mottled lights and shadows existed. There were also a few beams that looked like meteors, but were in fact powerful principles and rules...

Su Ping was shocked to see himself surrounded by principles...

While being in that chaotic world, he felt his eyes were somehow “opening,” as if he had one more eye on his forehead. His understanding of the world had changed sharply.

Chaos, rules, heaven and earth, the universe... Su Ping was completely immersed in it, unaware of the passage of time. Time had no meaning in such a place; it was akin to a controllable substance.

It was a wonderful, unspeakable feeling.

Suddenly, Su Ping felt an extremely cold feeling, coming from the bottom of his heart. Then he felt as if there were a creature standing behind him, staring at him.

The creature’s gaze was cold, but Su Ping didn’t feel scared; rather, he felt extremely affectionate.

What is that?

Su Ping wanted to turn his head around but found that he could not move.

Buzzing. Su Ping opened his eyes again. He saw that he was still standing in front of the Chief Elder on the snow mountain, or piece of bone, whatever that thing was.

The cold and powerful gaze that had fallen on him still remained behind him, and Su Ping couldn’t help but look back. Suddenly, he saw a pair of extremely sharp eyes and a figure covered in black mist.

“Interesting. Sorcerer divine body...”

The Chief Elder didn’t seem to be all that surprised. If anything, the Chief Elder sounded relieved. “I see that the dark sorcerer’s bloodline trace in you was stimulated.”

Su Ping looked at the cold and dark figure behind him. It gave him quite a familiar feeling, as if he were looking at himself. “This is a divine body?” he asked the Chief Elder in surprise.

“Yes. That is your divine body,” the Chief Elder answered.

Su Ping couldn’t help but look up at his divine body, and suddenly had a strange feeling. Triggered by a thought of his, the dark figure suddenly merged into him; he instantly felt his strength was ascending rapidly. He felt his body was about to explode... That was even more powerful than the strength the Inferno Dragon gave him!

The dark sorcerer...

The Chief Elder blinked but didn’t say anything.

The strength of the divine body gradually faded away and the dark figure no longer appeared behind him. The divine energy’s power was part of him.

“I thought you would awaken our flaming sun divine body. It is a surprise to see that you have a sorcerer’s divine energy. Either way, you do have a divine body and there is room for improvement. I hope that your divine body can evolve to its ultimate form one day, the Darkest Divine Body,” the Chief Elder said.

Su Ping committed that to memory. He nodded. “Thank you for the advice, Chief Elder.”

“Those are the materials for the Solar Bulwark’s second level,” the Chief Elder said.

A pile of herbs and materials appeared in front of Su Ping. He took a glance and saw that all the materials he needed were there.

He was excited. His trip had been rewarding, even without getting those materials. His trip had turned out perfect since he did get them!

He could save the Little Skeleton!

Little Skeleton, hang in there!

Su Ping stored the goods in his storage space.

The Chief Elder was once again confused. It could not understand how Su Ping opened another space. Su Ping was anxious to return. “Sorry to have bothered you. If it’s all right with you, I’ll be taking my leave.”
