Chapter 660 Instant Kill!

Whoosh!

Su Ping didn’t stop after punching that beast king to death. He hurried over to another place where a beast king was fighting against three groups of battle pet warriors.

The sense of danger stimulated the beast king; it roared out of instinct.

A layer of dark armor emerged and covered the beast king; it was the beast king’s inherent skill. The armor was quite sturdy, able to endure attacks from dragons of the same rank for several minutes.

The other beast kings heard the cry for help and looked over.

Boom!

Su Ping dashed closer, decidedly punching the beast king with full strength.

The beast king’s dark armor caved in with a bang; blood and flesh squeezed out from the cracks in the armor. Still, Su Ping didn’t stop; he pushed his fist further into the beast king.

It was as if a mountain would have fallen onto the back of the beast king!

The ground trembled and the beast king was pushed to the ground.

Whoosh!

A thick wind arrow was discharged toward Su Ping from a distance. He was about to land another punch on the beast king when he sensed the incoming attack; he turned around on the spot and landed the punch on the arrow.

Boom!!

The air rippled. The arrow then broke to pieces.

It had been shot by a creature that was dozens of meters long with a pair of butterfly wings. The beast king was covered in strange, dark patterns; its claws were hideous and it had a mouth similar to a crab’s.

Su Ping left behind the beast king he had just beaten half to death. He reached the winged beast king with two teleportations.

Woo!!

The winged beast king seemed able to anticipate Su Ping’s movement. The beast king generated a wave of a rare sonic blast at Su Ping.

That sonic blast smashed the concrete and steel rebar into dust.

Su Ping wasn’t the least worried. He had merged with the Little Skeleton and even if he wasn’t, he could have easily stood the blast.

Huraaaa!

Su Ping roared.

The moment he did so, clouds began to tumble in the void behind him. A huge skeleton appeared and roared together with Su Ping.

Su Ping’s roar dispersed the sonic blast. The winged beast king was caught off guard; it began to bleed and its chest caved in. The beast king collapsed on the ground at once.

The battle pet warriors were stunned into silence.

One roar and a beast king fell?!

Who is that guy?

Even Venerable the Blade was startled. He had always known that Su Ping was a powerful one and his hunch was right about the young man.

Still, what happened just then made him realize he had underestimated Su Ping.

Not even a legendary battle pet warrior at the Void State could have done that!

That is, unless it was a legendary battle pet warrior that focused on sonic blasts. If it was, but clearly, that was not Su Ping.

That guy was a freak!

After the roar ended, Su Ping glanced at the winged beast king and slashed at it with a sword skill that combined lightning bolts and Ashura energy. He had integrated his understanding of the rules of lightning with the Sin Cutter.

The creature wasn’t even able to fight back; the cut landed on its head, utterly crushing it. There weren’t even signs of breathing afterwards.

Su Ping turned around and went to another place.

He saw many ninth-rank wild beasts leading other weaker beasts; they were fighting against battle pet warriors.

Su Ping generated bolts of lightning and smashed those wild beasts.

Those bolts of lightning had combined the energy of the Heaven’s Tests; they also had a natural suppression against ninth-rank wild beasts. All those beasts were crushed as a result; even the ninth-rank beasts died on the spot.

The ones that were a little bit away from the stampede were lucky enough to survive.

Su Ping was like a fighter plane streaking across the sky, the bolts of lightning being the bombs he unleashed. The wild beasts were routed, buying some time for the battle pet warriors to catch their breath.

“Is he a legendary battle pet warrior?”

“I don’t remember seeing this man in that pre-war meeting.” “That is terrifying. Is that what a legendary battle pet warrior can do? It’s amazing!” “I think this legendary battle pet warrior is more intimidating than the others. We would have already won if the others were like him.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The battle pet warriors gazed at Su Ping who was flying across the sky with admiration and respect.

Even titled battle pet warriors were insignificant in a war like that. However, Su Ping had managed to become the man under the spotlight. He was able to control the forces of nature.

At another section of the defense line

The noises were world-shaking. Everything had been ripped up and no one could see what the place had once been like; all the buildings had collapsed to the ground.

That was the most difficult section being contained by the defense line because a large number of beast kings had been gathered at that point.

Standing on one side of the defense line were dozens of beast kings; several battle pet warriors were standing on the other side with their battle pets. Both sides were unleashing legendary rank skills of various kinds. The stone skills made the ground rumble and the plant-related skills created swamps and odd vines. Fire was raining down from the sky and the fireballs came crashing down. Clusters of chaotic energy were found everywhere. The radiation emitted by the chaotic energy was enough to kill ordinary advanced battle pet warriors directly.

Some legendary battle pet warriors had suddenly heard someone approaching; they then saw a man quickly flying toward the defense line. The man had been able to teleport across the more peaceful zones; he would generate lightning bolts and when he was flying past areas with a larger number of wild beasts.

Blasting wild beasts with such a speed and frequency required a large reserve of energy. Common legendary battle pet warriors would have exhausted their astral powers by then.

Some beast kings had tried to stop that man but he would kill them with one punch.

“Who is that?”

“Teleportation? Is it a Void State Warrior?”

“That is not Lord Nie. Someone else is helping us?”

The legendary battle pet warriors shouted, openly showing their delight. They would have a chance to win with the help of a Void state warrior!

“He is awesome!”

“I think he is better than Lord Nie!”

The legendary battle pet warriors marveled at the fact that Su Ping was able to kill beast kings with a single blow; nothing could slow him down.

Not even Lord Nie was capable of that.

The young man’s actions were clean and neat; it was as if he weren’t killing beast kings, but ninth-rank beasts instead!

Roar!

A beast king suddenly jumped out and displayed its anger; it was a Starburst Dragon covered in red scales... a Void State beast king!

The five legendary battle pet warriors and their beast king battle pets trembled after hearing the roar; their blood froze and their brains buzzed.

There were times that dragons were even able to knock out their enemies by using their roar or killing them directly!

“A lord-level beast king. Damn it!”

“I cannot believe this. The other one was distracted by the Heaven Executor, but he hasn’t returned yet!”

“Hang in there, guys. That legendary battle pet warrior is coming!”

The five legendary battle pet warriors were seized by a fit of despair, but the thought of that unknown man arriving to help boosted their confidence.

Lord Nie and the Heaven Executor weren’t there, but the newcomer was also at the Void State!

They could do this!

The five legendary battle pet warriors were unleashing astral powers while using their full strength.

Two of them had some questions in mind because they felt... the man lending a hand... looked somewhat familiar.

Where have I seen him?

In the meantime, the Starburst Dragon had charged forward, away from its group. The flames burning around its body were glorious. Even though the dragon was more skilled in close-quarter combat, it did not lack long-range strike skills. Of course, the wild dragon’s most noticeable trait was its strong constitution, which was why dragons were famous.

The legendary battle pet warriors turned pale as the dragon moved toward them.

“Charge!”

“Stop it! We cannot let the dragon tear open our defense line!”

Boom! Boom!

The legendary battle pet warriors tried all the skills they knew to stop the dragon, using special gravity fields or creating swamps for example. The ground caved in and a swamp as large as a football field appeared.

Still, the Starburst Dragon vanished on the spot and re-appeared right in front of the defense line. The dragon blotted the sky; it was glaring down at a beast king battle pet from a height.

That beast king battle pet was a Blazing Crocodile that was powering that special gravity field. The dragon’s sudden appearance caught the crocodile completely off guard, freezing on the spot.
