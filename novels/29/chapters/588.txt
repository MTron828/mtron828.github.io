Chapter 591 The Legendary Battle Pet Warriors

They had not traveled in the field of Ice for long when Su Ping and Yun Wanli were met with a strike.

Some ice spears had suddenly emerged from the snow. In the meantime, a group of beasts leaped out from the snow and charged toward Su Ping and Yun Wanli.

Without hesitation, Su Ping told the Little Skeleton to go and kill the beasts.

Those ninth-rank beasts instantly died by the Little Skeleton’s bone blade.

Red blood tainted the snow. Su Ping and Yun Wanli resumed their trip; they were attacked several times more but Su Ping took care of them with ease.

Most of the beasts they met were of the eighth or the ninth rank; there were a few beast kings but none of them was of the Void State.

They had covered over one hundred thousand meters when the Winged Wind Listener whispered to Yun Wanli, “Old Wan, I’m hearing battles about one hundred thousand meters ahead of us.”

“Battles?”

Yun Wanli turned to Su Ping.

Su Ping was worried, thinking that Su Lingyue was there. He told the Inferno Dragon to hurry.

Whoosh!

The Inferno Dragon let out a roar, flapped its wings, and flew onward at full speed.

Something like whirlwinds appeared on the Inferno Dragon’s wings; it was a skill called the Force of Wind which could greatly elevate its speed.

The Winged Wind Listener was surprised to see the Inferno Dragon using the Force of Wind, which should be a legendary skill that was only mastered by a small number of beast kings of the wind family. How come the Inferno Dragon is able to use it?

Yun Wanli had also noticed that, but Su Ping’s skeleton was even weirder. So, for the Inferno Dragon to be using that skill was nothing. “Come on, let’s go,” Yun Wanli urged his pet.

The Winged Wind Listener came back to its senses. This pet was also using the Force of Wind; the pet’s flight path was a strange one, but it soon caught up with the Inferno Dragon.

After all, being a pet of the wind family, it wouldn’t be slower than the Inferno Dragon.

After rushing for ten minutes or so

Su Ping and Yun Wanli had reached the place the Winged Wind Listener had mentioned; they had kept on tackling with many beasts along the way.

As they looked into the distance, they saw a magnificent snowy mountain range. A bunch of beasts was running toward some people by the opening of a valley!

A dozen beast kings were trying to stop the wild beasts’ attack; some people were running about close to the beast kings as they also fought against those creatures.

“That’s the strategic pass!”

Yun Wanli could not believe it. “This is the entrance to the next field. Those must be the legendary battle pet warriors from the Tower!”

Su Ping recognized that those people were indeed legendary battle pet warriors.

They were trying to stop the wild beasts at the moment. The weakest beasts were at the eighth and the ninth rank, while there were also dozens at the beast king rank!

It was a terrifying scene!

It would be appalling to see three or four beast kings attacking together at ground level. However, there were dozens of beast kings in this situation!

That was much more horrifying than the attack Su Ping experienced in the Longjiang Base City!

Of course, he could not tell if any of the beast kings were like the Otherworld Heavenly King, which was at least at the Fate State, a grade which was much more powerful than the Void State.

One Otherworld Heavenly King at the Fate State had enough power to crush hundreds or even thousands of beast kings of the Ocean State.

“Go and help out,” Su Ping said.

He didn’t like the Tower. However, he couldn’t sit around and do nothing while he witnessed how the legendary battle pet warriors were struggling to stop the wild beasts.

After all, the entire world would be in chaos if those beast kings were to get out.

Yun Wanli was scared, but that very fear shamed him. Even Su Ping-who had turned hostile toward the Tower—was willing to step up. On the other hand, he-a member of the Tower and a man respected by countless students of the academy-was thinking about escaping. What a shame.

“Come with me!”

Yun Wanli bit his teeth.

The Winged Wind Listener looked at Yun Wanli with worry. Compared with duty and obligation, the Winged Wind Listener cared more about Yun Wanli’s life.

It only had one master, Yun Wanli. Whoosh!

Su Ping flew toward the valley; the legendary battle pet warriors immediately noticed him. They stole a second from their fight and darted him a look, quickly relieved to see it was a human being approaching. The legendary battle pet warriors threw themselves into the fight again.

Su Ping stood in the air, looking down at the crowd of beasts. He could tell the strength of the beast kings since he was close enough.

Most of the beast kings were at the Ocean State and three were at the Void State!

None of the beast kings was at the Fate State!

That was good news to Su Ping. Beast kings of the Fate State were still quite tricky for him. He could muster combat strength at the Fate State when he merged with the Little Skeleton, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have a problem fighting Fate State beast kings.

He had been able to force the Otherworld Heavenly King to leave because the latter was unwilling to get hurt. He had noticed how the Heavenly King had saved some strength as it was leaving “I see that the beasts have outnumbered us. Let’s show the beasts what outnumbering truly means,” Su Ping said to the Little Skeleton. The Little Skeleton understood. It left the dragon’s shoulder and flew into the valley.

Soon, the Little Skeleton was above the gathering of beasts in the air. Some of them noticed the Little Skeleton, as it was covered in darkness. In the meantime, a primitive door was opening in the air behind the Little Skeleton.

Gate of the Undead!

A chilly wind blew from the inside of the door as it opened; evil creatures came out, riding on the wind. The wild shrieks and howls were terrifying

Those creatures dashed out from the world inside the door.

There were skeleton knights and there were skeleton beasts.

The wild beasts were disrupted as the undead creatures joined the fray. The undead army soon stomped some of the eighth-rank and ninth-rank beasts to death.

“What is that skill?”

“Calling of the Undead? No, it cannot be. There should be some media...”

“Those creatures are good!”

The legendary battle pet warriors noticed the chaos made by the Little Skeleton. The pets of the undead family could use skills to summon creatures, but they would have to use some corpses. It was also noticeable that the creatures they were seeing were much more powerful.

The undead creatures coming out from the door were listening to that skeleton’s orders; it was the master of them all!

“No wonder the skill is scored over 80. This can increase combat strength by a large margin...” Su Ping, of course, was not surprised. He had tested the strength of the skill in a cultivation site. There was once a time when the Little Skeleton summoned a creature at the Void State.

The Little Skeleton’s current combat strength was 39, higher than the Void State beasts, but lower than the Fate State. If the skill’s score had something to do with the pet’s combat strength, then Su Ping would have been certain that the skill was of the Fate State.

The Little Skeleton stepped away from the door as it was stabilized. An area of darkness was established around the Little Skeleton; this skill was named the field of Darkness.

Any beast touched by the Field of Darkness was shouting miserably. Noises of pain were heard, as if the beasts were boiling in oil; their scales and fur were burned.

The Little Skeleton was like a walking death dealer.

The Field of Darkness was not that effective against beast kings; they would be hurt but it was nothing serious. On the other hand, the other beasts were less lucky. The corrosion would take their lives.

The Skeleton King’s skills are scary. Su Ping stood on the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder as he watched. The Little Skeleton was enough to manage since there weren’t any Fate State beast kings. He would also need to stay on alert in case he failed to detect any beast kings of the Fate State.

Besides, the Little Skeleton had strong regeneration abilities. Even a Fate State beast king would have to go through much trouble to kill the Little Skeleton.

Cry!

At the same time, Yun Wanli had charged at the wild beasts with his pets. However, he was afraid to go too deep into the group of beasts. He assisted the other legendary battle pet warriors and killed the beasts that the Little Skeleton had left out.

The tides were turned, thanks to the Little Skeleton. The beast kings launched a strike to deal with the Little Skeleton. Still, the Little Skeleton’s skills were stunning; it killed several beast kings in a row. The other beast kings knew that things were not looking well for them.

Roar!

A beast bellowed with unbridled fury.

The other beast kings stopped; although unwilling, they turned around and chose to run.

Some of the other beasts stayed while some fled with the beast kings.

In an instant, there was nothing left but a ground full of corpses and blood.

Su Ping did not allow the Little Skeleton to chase the escaping beasts. It could be dangerous, especially since he wasn’t familiar with that place.

The battle ended and the door was closed; the undead creatures returned to the world on the other side of the door. Su Ping told the Little Skeleton to return.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The legendary battle pet warriors flew to meet with Su Ping.

“Ha, ha, we have such a young and handsome friend here.”

“Brother, what’s your name? Your battle pet is awesome!”

“Thank god you got here on time or else we would have been in serious trouble.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The legendary battle pet warriors flashed brilliant smiles as they gabbled and relished their victory.

Su Ping looked at them. It surprised him to see that those people were completely unlike the legendary battle pet warriors he had met at the Tower. They were actually nice.

“You can just call me Su Ping. Are you all here under the Tower’s orders?” Su Ping asked.

“Su Ping? Is that your name? Why don’t you tell us your title? Ha, ha, well, I see that you’re an easygoing and friendly boy.” A bulky man covered in blood laughed. He wiped the blood off his mustache and face, then cleaned his hand on his clothes.

“Brother Su, are you a new guy from the Tower?” said a young man with black hair, a rigid looking face which contrasted with his soft voice.

Su Ping answered honestly, “I’m here to find my sister. This is her picture, have you seen her?”

He showed them a picture he had on his phone.

The legendary battle pet warriors were surprised to find that the young man was not from the Tower. They closed in to look at that picture.

“No.”

“She looks like you.”

“Your sister is such a young girl. She’s here? Didn’t you ask the people at the first pass?”

Su Ping shook his head. “There’s no one there. You’re the first group of legendary battle pet warriors we’ve met.”

Everyone was frozen on the spot.
