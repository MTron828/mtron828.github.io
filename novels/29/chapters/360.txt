Chapter 363 Exterminate

The peak of the sixth rank was still the sixth rank.

This girl was eligible for the Elite League.

The worker raised the device above his head to show the audience that the test was impartial.

Afterward, the worker stepped off the stage. Soon, the only ones remaining on the stage were Yan Bingyue, the Cyborg Pet, and a title-ranked judge. Quickly, the seal was raised, closing off the stage. The test was about to begin.

“She’s not going to die because of this, is she?”

“This test is outrageous. She should be fine if she were allowed to use her battle pets. I don’t think she can do it with her own strength!”

“This is far too dangerous!”

Some people in the audience felt worried; they could sympathize with her. Fei Yanbo, Mr. Lin, and Mrs. Luo wore concerned expressions as well. It was hard that she had to battle an eighth-rank Cyborg, to begin with, not to mention that she couldn’t summon her pets. A battle pet warrior without pets was akin to lacking an arm. The three believed that by forbidding her pets, she wouldn’t even have the confidence to fight a beast of her same rank, let alone with a beast at a higher rank.

The students from the Berserking Blade Academy were discussing in a low voice how excessive the test was.

Su Ping, on the other hand, was very much interested. It was the first time he had seen a Cyborg Pet like this, kind of like a Gundam, quite cool.

He wondered if the Cyborg Pet could be as good as other eighth-rank battle pets.

The judge told the commentators to announce that the test had started. The people in the audience held their breaths and listened quietly.

“Energy export, initiate!” “Consciousness, initiate!”

“Battle state, initiate!”

The working staff began to transmit back-end signals.

The cables and wires around the eighth-rank Lava Devil fell off and they retracted back into a device, like many moving vipers. As if freed from its shackles, the Lava Devil’s eyes turned scarlet. It made a step forward and produced a soul-shattering yell.

Roar!!

The roar even made the air tremble.

Immediately after, heavy flames leaped up from the Lava Devil, which was bathing in a sea of lava. This was a monster that was constantly burning.

The people watching became even more nervous as the Lava Devil unveiled its appalling look.

No one would want to stay within the same space as this monster.

However, Yan Bingyue remained as composed as ever. When the Lava Devil bellowed, she showed her resolve and clenched tightly to her sword.

Roar!

The Lava Devil kept on roaring. The surrounding lava and burning flames suddenly converged and formed a wall of fire behind it, and many lava spheres suddenly flew out from the wall of fire.

That was an eighth-rank skill, Molten Meteorite!

An AOE skill.

The moment the Molten Meteorites were discharged, people gasped. Even Xu Kuang and the rest of the Top 5 were taken aback.

At that very moment, Yan Bingyue suddenly dashed forward while bending down!

Secret skill, Thunder Eyes!

Secret skill, Sonic Sprint! Whoosh!

Yan Bingyue vanished on the spot. A Molten Meteorite with a diameter of two meters landed where she was. A huge pit appeared on the shaking ground.

But Yan Bingyue was more than ten meters away from where she originally was. Then the second Molten Meteorite came and landed on the place where she was standing, but she had evaded it at the same time.

Bang!

The Molten Meteorite missed its target.

Bang, bang, bang!

The ensuing Molten Meteorites kept on aiming at Yan Bingyue, but she was always able to dash away. The Lava Devil used data to calculate where to launch the Molten Meteorites and still, it was unable to hit her.

There was a heavy rain of Molten Meteorites. Yan Bingyue dashed around in a blur among the Molten Meteorites and every time she moved, she would be that much closer to the Lava Devil. In an instant, she had covered two hundred meters.

A glint of coldness rose in her eyes. Whoosh!

Yan Bingyue suddenly ran over at a speed much faster than before. She crossed thirty meters in the blink of an eye and she reached the Lava Devil, to stand right in front of its chest.

A cold glare bounced off from the sharp sword. Whoosh and kill!

Bang!

The lava armor worn by the Lava Devil fell into pieces. The lava that spilled onto Yan Bingyue bounced off from a transparent shield covering her. She pushed the sharp sword further into the broken lava armor, cutting it aside. At the same time, she kicked backward on the ground; she jumped to the Lava Devil, and leveraging that strength, she landed in a place twenty meters away from the Lava Devil. She shook the sword, turned around, and stepped away.

Bang!!

There came a loud noise. A huge cut appeared on the Lava Devil’s body. It burst open!

Fire soared to the sky after the explosion. Everyone was as mute as a fish. She had slain the Lava Devil!

She killed an eighth-rank Cyborg Pet with her own strength!

Everyone was stunned speechless by this shocking scene and by the girl’s almost heroic deed.

Qin Shaotian and the other four looked sullen. Her speed and physical quality were overwhelming. She was a monster Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The skill used by the Cyborg Pet just then was of the eighth-rank, one that would travel incredibly fast. Not even beasts at the sixth rank would have been able to dodged it. This girl surely used some unique secret skills.

Some secret skills could only come into effect after a person’s physical quality had been improved.

Terrifying!

Qin Shaotian’s desire to fight was burning high. Interesting. Very interesting!

Both Xu Kuang and Su Lingyue were struck dumb with astonishment. This Elite League had been an eye-opener for them. First, they witnessed how Qin Shaotian used one seventh-rank pet to defeat all of his opponents before he entered the Top 10. This day, they saw this girl battling a battle pet two ranks higher than her, by herself.

What kind of person was she?!

“That was marvelous!” Fei Yanbo, Mr. Lin, and Ms. Luo were just as stupefied as anyone else.

The students sitting behind them, including Luo Fengtian and Yu Weihan, were paralyzed with shock.

She was so young and at a rank similar to theirs. But she was much more intimidating. Why was she so different from them?

Su Ping, too, was dumbfounded.

What...

They were making it too easy for her! They said the Cyborg Pet would use full strength.

Su Ping was speechless. The Cyborg Pet was fighting one person but used an AOE skill. Was it the Lava Devil that was stupid or the working staff?

Or, did they think that the people in the audience were fools?

If the Lava Devil were to use another eighth-rank skill, the Lava Cut, the girl wouldn’t have won that easily.

Lava Cut was fast and it took almost no time to prepare. That skill could exert great damage and that was the most powerful skill the Lava Devil should use.

Su Ping heaved a sigh and shook his head. Never mind.

She passed the test, so be it.

Besides, the girl did demonstrate enough strength to qualify being among the Top 5.

The test ended and without a doubt, Yan Bingyue was successful.

The impact of the explosion quieted down, leaving behind a ground full of remains.

The working staff was at a loss for words.

An eighth-rank Cyborg Pet was expensive, almost as pricey as an adult eighth-rank battle pet. It was destroyed just like that. No one dared to say anything, of course. They just produced some bitter smiles.

Soon, a man from the government ordered the working staff to clean up the scene and had some pets of the stone family repair what had been damaged on the stage during the fight. Liu Tianzong was excited as he looked at Yan Bingyue returning to her seat. She indeed was formidable; she turned out to be more outstanding than the Liu Family’s young master, although they had already devoted many resources to train him.

The family heads of the Qin, Mu, and Ye Families were unhappy but they still kept the casual and natural smiles on their faces.

“Interesting.”

Yin Fengxiao wore a grin as he saw the reactions from the people around him. Testing Lady Yan’s abilities? What a bunch of ignorant

guys!

Soon, the official match began.

Yan Bingyue would be participating as the sixth player and her name would be put together with the other five.

This time, no one said anything in protest. Some who studied battle pets carefully found it strange that the Lava Devil wouldn’t use Lava Cut. Anyways, the girl had proven to be intimidating enough to be able to withstand the Molten Meteorite by herself.

Many people turned their focus to the big screen.

Soon, the three pairs were determined.

Qin Shaotian against Yan Bingyue.

Su Lingyue against Ye Longtian.

And Mu Yuanshou against Xu Kuang.

They all looked at their respective opponents and soon, everyone turned to Qin Shaotian.

He was the first to go and he had to fight the horrifying Yan Bingyue.

Qin Shaotian smiled and gently patted the sword in his arms.

“Qin Shaotian?”

Yan Bingyue stared at her opponent.

When she found out that she had to fight a Qin guy, she threw a look at Qin Duhuang.

But Qin Duhuang was still wearing that harmless smile; she couldn’t tell what he was thinking

“What a surprise. We have heard that Qin Shaotian is talented. Now we’ll find out first hand.” Yin Fengxiao smiled.

Qin Duhuang replied smilingly, “He is not nearly as good as Lady Yan yet.” Yin Fengxiao was surprised, since Qin Duhuang had already found himself a way out for the outcome.

was

“I heard that there are several secret skills related to swords mastered by the Qin Family and those skills have never been leaked,” Yan Bingyue said. She took the sword from Xiao Yu’s arms. This time, she didn’t draw her blade. She took the sheath as well as she stood up. “I hope I won’t be disappointed.”

Qin Duhuang was offended by her words but then he chuckled without saying anything. With this, he had made it clear to Yan Bingyue that she wasn’t qualified to talk about disappointment yet. Yan Bingyue paid no heed to his reaction and went onto the stage.

Qin Shaotian stood up and slowly walked to the stage as well.

The seal was closed as soon as they arrived, leaving them and the judge inside.

The loud cheers gradually came to a stop. Everyone was looking forward to the upcoming match.

“I can tell that you use swords well. I would like to find out more.” Wearing a smile, Qin Shaotian said to Yan Bingyue who was on the opposite side of the stage.

Yan Bingyue cast a glance at the sword he held. “I heard that you lost once. You’re not as good as people say, then. Don’t let me down this time.”
