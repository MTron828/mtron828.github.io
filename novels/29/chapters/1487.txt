Chapter 1488 Slashing the Tribulation (1)

With a boom, the entire godly world seemed to be shaking

The freshly healed crack in the clouds was slashed open, revealing greater damage. Su Ping tirelessly detonated his newly-condensed undying universe. He transferred the explosive power on his arm and unleashed it with the God’s Arrival secret technique.

99% of his power was fully released with a momentary beam of sword light, which was even more dazzling than before.

!!

The tribulation clouds were torn apart, revealing a gap tens of thousands of kilometers wide. The bloody sword light entered deep into the clouds, dying the world red.

Su Ping roared and slashed relentlessly.

He forcefully slashed the dark tribulation to pieces with his sword.

That unbelievable scene dumbfounded the emperors who were watching in the distance. Even the Ancestral Gods who showed up after receiving reports were shocked, as they felt the sharpness of that new Ancestral God!

“Another stubborn kid. Looks like the world won’t be peaceful anymore.”

“I heard that the Rain Ancestor is his enemy… Looks like the Rain Clan’s life won’t be easy in the next hundred thousand years.”

“I hope his actions stay within the rules of us

gods.”

The Ancestral Gods had mixed feelings. They had once been dazzling geniuses who suppressed their peers, they weren’t as domineering as Su Ping was during his tribulation. However, despite his momentum, they knew how powerful the test was; it wouldn’t fall with a few slashes.

Just as the Ancestral Gods pondered, the opening on the clouds got bigger and bigger. A rumbling sound originated from the depths of the clouds.

The sound echoed in the void and was transmitted through time and space. It was simply bloodcurdling.

It sounded like some ancient existence snorting furiously in the depths of the clouds!

The bloody crack caused by the sword aura was swiftly mended. All of Su Ping’s sword auras were consumed by the clouds and the clouds recovered in full. All the work didn’t cause a thing

Whoosh!

Su Ping didn’t stop, though. Instead, he swung his sword faster and faster. His universe of fire exploded and was condensed again and again, unleashing its destructive power. His terrifying sword auras were released at a faster pace.

Exactly at that moment-a bloody light appeared in the depths of the dark clouds all of a sudden, with crimson lightning darting down aggressively.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He sensed that a scorching aura from the lightning had the same origin as his sword technique.

The Heavenly Tribulation had melded his attack unto itself and was sending it back to him!

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. Was it a provocation? Or mockery?

His sword spun and a sharp aura slashed out, only to be shattered by the bloody lightning. The clouds’ attack was slightly weakened, but it kept on pressuring him.

There was no time for Su Ping to slash again. He could only condense his universe and resist.

Bam. The undying fire universe was penetrated. Su Ping trembled and nearly fell, as if hit by a mountain.

He raised his head, and saw a second bolt of lightning rushing down. Detonating his universe with a roar, he slashed again.

His sword aura was shattered. He quickly condensed his universe and resisted the second strike.

Then came a third lightning bolt, a fourth, and so son…

Su Ping had attacked the tribulation with sixteen sword auras. In the blink of an eye he was hit back by sixteen bloody lightning bolts. He felt as if all his cells were escaping from his body.

He stared at the sky and raised his head again, detonating the universe he had just condensed and gathering everything in his hand as a bloody sword aura.

This time, he activated the Contract Dao Heart and immediately linked himself to the power of the world within a radius of 300,000 kilometers. The violent power surged into his body.

His arm was about to burst because of the terrifying power being gathered. It was emitting an unprecedented aura, like a scorching sun.

“This is… the original power of our world?”

“He can actually invoke the power of the world?”

“Or maybe, is the world’s original consciousness helping him?”

The Ancestral Gods in the distance showed different expressions, revealing shock when they saw the change in Su Ping’s aura. He was as frightening as the Ancestral Gods who had transcended the tribulation a long time before.

“Break!!” Su Ping roared and slashed again.

There was an explosion, and a horrifying aura tore the world apart. All the species on the continents nearby sensed the uncanny vibrations in the air. It seemed that there was an earthquake thousands of kilometers away.

In fact, Su Ping was billions of kilometers away from them.

The terrifying sword aura rose to the skies and ripped everything apart, including the tribulation clouds!

The latter-which were indestructible at the beginning-instantly fell apart. The crack extended for hundreds of thousands of kilometers. A brilliant golden light illuminated the world. The shape of a sword could be clearly seen at ground level!

The tribulation clouds surged and rumbled, as if roaring in pain and fury, quickly swallowing the sword-shaped gap.

Su Ping roared and detonated his universe again. He connected himself to the power of the world again, this time encompassing a radius of 400,000 kilometers!

The energy turbulence was even more intense than before. Su Ping’s body became taller, too, reaching 100,000 kilometers, arms like mountains. The bloody sword in his hand looked like a rough mountain ridge. He slashed furiously as his energy erupted, prepared to raze everything to the ground. An indescribable energy was shot forth instantly, faster than the black hole swallowing rays of

light.
