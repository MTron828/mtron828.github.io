Chapter 1383: Beyond the Universe (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The formerly furious Celestials who had been complaining felt embarrassed and lost for words.

Su Ping was similarly stunned as he watched the fearless soldiers who charged at the universe dominators and perished.

They actually showed more courage than many Celestials would as they faced those mighty beings.

Something seemed to be shaking and sprouting in Su Ping’s head.

The three unparalleled Dao Hearts that the Golden Crow ancestor showed him were flashing across his mind. All the experiences from the hundred years he had spent in cultivation sites rushed back to him.

What was it that he had been pursuing?

Survival, enjoyment, eternal life, no restriction…

There were too many selfish desires and thoughts, which represented what everybody wanted.

However… None of them were real Dao Hearts.

As seen on the projection, the blood of soldiers who sacrificed themselves seemed to almost fill up the universe.

Su Ping knew it was an unresolvable blood feud!

It was then when he finally realized why the ancient corpses would act and attack again so many years after their deaths.

So, when hatred reached the maximum… it wouldn’t be erased even after the soul perished! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

......

This is… a bloody hatred between species!

Su Ping’s eyes were popping up. He had the strong urge of slaughtering the Heavens; coldly, in the exact same way they were slaughtering human beings.

You forced the Golden Crows to hide, destroyed the Archean Divinity, reduced my universe to a desolate situation…?Su Ping clenched his fists hard. The immense hatred twisted his face.

He wanted to fly and send his store back into the battlefield to kill all of those members of the Heavens!

Thankfully, the last bit of his rationality pulled through. Even if he had the strength to kill them all, no one knew for certain if stronger people of the Heavens race would show up.

All of a sudden, Chi Huo asked, “Brother Su, please teach me how to cultivate and become a universe dominator!”

Everybody was shocked by the request; they couldn’t help but look at Su Ping.?Does Su Ping have secret techniques to develop into a universe dominator?

Su Ping looked at Chi Huo. The man’s expression revealed his true intent.

There was pain, hatred, disgust, despair, guilt and many other emotions on his face. He felt anger because of his own incompetence as he watched his compatriots sacrificing themselves for him.

“No problem.” Su Ping accepted the request in a low voice. He had already decided to strike an alliance with the Archean Divinity and the Golden Crows. If he could enter the Archean Divinity, he would introduce Chi Huo and the others to the Heaven Path Institute.

Su Ping never considered defeating the Heavens’ race on his own. In order to become stronger, humans would need allies.

Even the Golden Crow ancestor—an existence born in the age of chaos—had to hide from the Heavens. Su Ping knew that he had to gather as many forces as possible to fight them.

The answer left the other Celestials in shock. They quickly said, “Brother Su, we’d like to ask for the same. We hope you’ll enlighten us.”

All of them were willing to act humble at that moment.

Su Ping gave them a slight nod in silence. He controlled the glittering rock that his store had turned into, redirecting it to fly away from that galaxy and head somewhere far away.

Once he could no longer sense the Heavens, Su Ping took a deep breath and said to the group, “I’m ready to tear the universe open.”

Everybody looked solemn.

They knew that, for the first time in history, they would be embarking on a journey beyond the universe.

Beyond the universe… was the great unknown.

Except for the Primordial Empyrean Master, nobody had wandered outside the universe. What they knew about what lied beyond was too little.

They were going to look for hope and preserve the bit of hope they still had with that trip.

They were Fire Seeds too, the biggest ones.

“One day, we’ll return to the world where we belong,” said Shen Huang solemnly.

The other Celestials stayed silent. They looked at the universe outside the store as if saying goodbye. No one knew what was in store for them, or when they would return.

But, if they ever returned alive, it would undoubtedly be for revenge!

Su Ping unleashed his strength and tore the universe open as fast as possible, holding nothing back.

The power of chaos surged in his body; everybody was intimidated by his terrifying aura. It wasn’t until then that they realized how much stronger that young man was compared to them.

He was already very close to that alien!

However, they sensed that Su Ping was still in the Celestial State!

For a moment, many of them had hope in their eyes.?Perhaps the future of humanity lies in the hands of this young man.

The universe was soon torn open, and Su Ping immediately flew into the gap with the pet store.

Strange laws were moving outside of the store, which seemed to be passing through a long and dark tunnel. The aura of the old universe was gradually left behind.

At the same time, the battle projection blurred and also disappeared.

The signal had been cut off.

That was an indicator that they had truly escaped from their universe.

Everyone felt uneasy; they held their breath nervously, as none of them knew what they would find, or what was awaiting them.

The aliens came from somewhere beyond the universe. Maybe they would encounter them right after exiting their home cosmos. Maybe they were going right into their nest!

Everything was unknown and unpredictable.

After a long, long time—

There was a beam of light in front of their eyes.

The darkness gradually faded away, and the beam of light seemed to be dispersing, forming feeble lights that surrounded the store. Everybody was immediately able to detect the terrifying laws in the world outside.

“Is this a place beyond the universe?”

Everybody examined carefully, but all they could see was a desolate and boundless world with scant light. There were no stars; light simply wandered about as some sort of sprayed particles.

Behind them was a barrier that was gradually healing.

They noticed how the barrier disappeared completely once it healed. They could no longer see the oval barrier of the universe, and their senses were blocked when their senses reached it.

Su Ping was also staring at the surroundings. He discovered that their universe seemed to have disappeared, but it was actually there; he just couldn’t detect it without using stronger senses. It couldn’t be felt at all from a long distance.

Other than that, they were now in a world of nothingness.

There were no planets or any other matter. The only things present were the chaotic paths filling up the surrounding space.

The paths were extremely strong, moving as if they were intelligent. A regular Celestial could be heavily wounded by one.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. Not expecting the place beyond the universe to be so desolate, he asked the system in his heart, “We’re now beyond the universe. What should we call it?”

“You may call it the Realm of Heavens.”

“The Realm of… Heavens?”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. “Is this where the Heavens live?”

“That’s right; so, in a way, you’ve entered their territory. However, this place is extremely vast. I don’t think you’ll encounter any if you’re careful,” said the system solemnly.

Su Ping changed his expression. He thought there was hope after leaving the old universe, but they ended up in an even more dangerous place.

“Can I find other universes in this place?” Su Ping asked again.

After a moment of silence, the system said, “You can try.”

“?”

Su Ping was stunned.?What kind of answer is that?

He asked again, but the system ignored him. Su Ping knew it would be pointless to insist. Since the system had answered that way, there was at least a slim chance.
