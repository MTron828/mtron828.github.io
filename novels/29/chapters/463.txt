Chapter 465 Holy Spirit

“Brother Su, let’s make it easy for the girl. How about we go up there and have some fun?” Xu Yang asked Su Ping.

The others were intrigued by this proposal.

They all knew Xu Yang very well but were unfamiliar with Su Ping. The Vice Chairman had complimented Su Ping many times and yet they still had some doubts before they could see Su Ping demonstrating his abilities with their own eyes.

“Works for me.” Su Ping nodded. A simple approach like this felt nice.

Xu Yang smiled. He went up to the stage immediately.

“Brother Su, good luck!” Hu Jiutong cheered Su Ping.

The others were sizing up Su Ping curiously. The Vice Chairman understood that Xu Yang was trying to take advantage of this chance to feel Su Ping out. Having witnessed how Su Ping passed the tests, the Vice Chairman could not help but feel sorry for Xu Yang. If Su Ping could make the beast evolve, he would surely win by a landslide!

As Xu Yang and Su Ping stepped on the stage, the audience burst into another round of cheering.

The fact that Su Ping was presented as a top trainer was surprising.

Lin Feng and his friends, Ji Zhantang and his granddaughter, all of them were immediately shocked by this. Su Ping was not sitting there because of connections. He was a top trainer!

Was he?

How confusing.

Wasn’t he a master trainer? When did he become a top trainer?

Lin Feng and his friends already had a hard time believing that Su Ping was a master trainer, not to mention a top trainer. How surreal...

“Top trainer...”

Ji Qiuyu wondered if there was something wrong with her. Ji Zhantang was just as puzzled as his granddaughter. He thought Su Ping was a titled battle pet warrior since he could kill one with his fist. It turned out that Su Ping was a top trainer!

Was there any trainer as violent as he was?

On the stage.

Su Ping and Xu Yang began to pick their beasts.

Xu Yang was the first to make a decision and Su Ping didn’t take long to decide, either. The beast that Su Ping picked was the one that Zhong Lingtong chose, seventh-rank Ice Scythe.

The Ice Scythe was a beast of the water family, one of the most powerful beasts with a seventh-rank bloodline. The Ice Scythe was good at defense and offense at the same time.

Zhong Lingtong was surprised to see that Su Ping would choose the same beast. She could not wait to find out more.

The one that Xu Yang picked was a dragon.

A seventh-rank Flaming Spirit Dragon. It was a dragon with the ability to manipulate fire as a weapon. It was said that the Flaming Spirit Dragon was born from fire and could overpower other pets of the fire family at the same rank. The Flaming Spirit Dragon was highly immune to fire.

The Flaming Fire Dragon was also a natural enemy for beasts of the water family. Only a few beasts of the thunder or the demon family could be well-matched against the Flaming Spirit Dragon in strength.

“He... he is going to train a beast of the water family. He is basically giving up.”

“Doesn’t he know what Xu Yang’s field of study is? Xu Yang is known as the King of Fire. No one knows more about training beasts of the fire family than he does. Anyways, there’s nothing to expect of this battle...” “You don’t know that. I heard that Su Ping was able to make a beast of the seventh-rank evolve within one stroke. There’s still a chance for Su Ping to win if he can inspire the Ice Scythe to evolve!”

They turned to the Vice Chairman.

The Vice Chairman didn’t foresee that Su Ping would go with that beast. He shook his head; Su Ping was new and knew next to nothing about Xu Yang. None of the other top trainers would have picked a beast of the water family to fight against a beast of the fire family. They would have chosen a beast of either the demon, thunder, or the rock family.

He felt sorry that he didn’t warn Su Ping about this.

“The only way for Su Ping to win is to make the beast evolve. But I don’t think the methods of training beasts of the thunder family are effective when used with beasts of the water family...” the Vice Chairman said to himself. He worried about Su Ping.

No one felt optimistic about the Ice Scythe that Su Ping had selected. They thought that Su Ping was making this choice because he was eager to take Zhong Lingtong as his student and wanted to make a demonstration. However, Su Ping’s decision was destined to be counterproductive. He might be scaring Zhong Lingtong away instead of surprising her.

.

The battle had yet to begin, but everyone believed they could already see the outcome.

The only thing that could turn the situation around was for Su Ping to be able to make the beast evolve as the Vice Chairman mentioned.

On the stage.

Soon, the beasts were delivered.

Su Ping and Xu Yang each had a sealed area for them to train the beasts.

“Get down!” Xu Yang lifted his hand. A wisp of crimson astral power poured out from his palm and seeped into the Flame Spirit Dragon’s head. The rage and cruelty disappeared from the dragon’s eyes. The dragon quietly crouched down as Xu Yang whispered something in its ear.

The fact that Xu Yang was able to tame such a barbaric seventh-rank dragon in an instant excited the audience. People had seen other top trainers’ demonstrations, and yet, they would still be just as thrilled each time.

Xu Yang began to train the dragon. He focused his mind on the Flaming Spirit Dragon and nothing else could distract him.

In the meantime, Su Ping didn’t stay idle. He revealed a slight part of his Solar Bulwark, instantly making the roar that the Ice Scythe was about to let out stick in its throat. The Ice Scythe’s two white eyes trembled as it stared at Su Ping in fear.

Su Ping instructed the Ice Scythe to sit down with his mind.

Like a marionette, the Ice Scythe voluntarily sat down as instructed by Su Ping.

Su Ping went over. Without using any astral shields or armors, he directly approached the Ice Scythe and began to fumble around.

After witnessing how Su Ping tamed the Ice Scythe with ease, people finally were convinced that the young man was indeed a top trainer!

Another top trainer had made an appearance in the Holy Light Base City!

That was a piece of sensational news!

The Ice Scythe had changed from a vicious beast to a tamed lamb as Su Ping touched and stroked its paws.

This time, Su Ping didn’t use the rules of thunder on the Ice Scythe. He decided to try the newly-obtained Enlightening Guide and Strength Enhancement on the Ice Scythe.

The Elementary Agility Guide, which was part of the Enlightening Guide, could help the beast pick up an inferior skill.

First of all, Su Ping used Strength Enhancement to strengthen the Ice Scythe’s two scythe-like limbs before he used the Enlightening Guide.

He moved closer to the Ice Scythe’s head and stood in the air several meters above ground. Even though the Ice Scythe was sitting on the stage, given its sheer size, its head was still too high above.

Seeing that Su Ping was standing in the air, the audience cried in shock and excitement. Flying was a skill exclusive to titled battle pet warriors and beyond.

Everyone began to take this young-looking trainer seriously. Some senior top trainers could build their astral powers to the titled rank by relying on heavy resources, but new top trainers would usually only have eighth-rank astral powers. As such, Su Ping had to be one of the senior top trainers.

“What is he doing?” “Strengthening some skills?” No one was able to understand Su Ping’s actions.

Like the Vice Chairman had said, Su Ping’s methods were unconventional and never before seen.

ncon

Su Ping closed his eyes and said in his mind, Enlightening!

The Enlightening Guide turned into a beam of light that seeped into the Ice Scythe’s head from his palm. The next second, the Ice Scythe trembled as if it were undergoing tremendous pressure.

Soon, a layer of silvery hue appeared over the Ice Scythe.

The glow that adhered to the Ice Scythe had a sacred feeling and was unlike that of astral powers. “Is that...”

The Vice Chairman was surprised. He was getting a déjà vu feeling, but he couldn’t remember where he had seen it before.

He searched his memory with a frown. All of a sudden, two words jumped out of his mind.

Holy Spirit!

Holy Spirit Trainer? He could not believe it.

Dozens of years back, he once visited other continents on behalf of the Trainers Association. He had the fortune to meet Holy Spirit Trainers from other continents. He saw how the Holy Spirit Trainers enlightened the beasts.

What Su Ping was doing was similar to that but...

Is Su Ping a Holy Spirit Trainer?

The Vice Chairman shook his head. There had to be something wrong with his mind.

No way.

There were merely two Holy Spirit Trainers in the entire world. There were even more legendary battle pet warriors than Holy Spirit Trainers!

Why so few?

The Vice Chairman only knew the answer after he became a top trainer. To become a Holy Spirit Trainer, the trainer had to be equipped with legendary-rank astral powers! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

That was one of the thresholds!

To have legendary-rank astral powers was immensely hard. One would have to study training skills while cultivating astral powers. What an impossible mission!

As such, many top trainers had given up on such an unrealistic dream. They just wanted to take some students, hoping that their students could realize that dream one day.

Time had left a mark on them. They no longer had such drive and passion.

As for Su Ping, the Vice Chairman was sure that he wasn’t a legendary battle pet warrior because he had met both legendary battle pet warriors of the Subcontinent District. He had met the ones in the Tower as well and he had heard about some legendary battle pet warriors who were hiding from the public eye. Su Ping didn’t belong to any group.

“I wonder what unconventional way that is,” the Vice Chairman said to himself.

Soon, the glow over the Ice Scythe receded and transformed into a white pattern that was engraved on the Ice Scythe’s skin. The lines gradually disappeared into the Ice Scythe’s flesh.

Su Ping removed his hand and looked at the Ice Scythe.

He felt the process had been successful.

The Ice Scythe opened its eyes and established eye contact with Su Ping who was still standing in the air. There was a crystal-clear glow in the Ice Scythe’s eyes as if it had intelligence.

The master of ceremonies reminded them that the time was up.

Su Ping came back to his senses and darted a look at Xu Yang

Xu Yang had just finished his training as well. He smiled at Su Ping as a reply.
