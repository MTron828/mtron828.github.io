Chapter 1164: Public Execution

The unexpected scene left everyone in shock.

What happened?

Many people didn’t see it clearly. That was not what they had foreseen!

Still, even the gods below the Ascendant State figured out the reason soon after.

Three glamorous illusions gradually popped up behind Su Ping, turning out to be triple small worlds!

Like a blossoming lotus flower, the brilliant world of stars, the gray world of illusions, and the mysterious world which contained countless secrets were revealed layer after layer.

All the gods were shocked; they looked at the young human with disbelief.

He is only a Celestial God; he actually grasped triple small worlds?

Most Celestial Gods weren’t even capable of establishing a single small world; only the best geniuses could achieve this. However, Su Ping had achieved this three times!

“He was too weak. What that the extent of his power? Indeed, he was just a regular member.”

Su Ping withdrew his fists, waving off the sticky golden blood splashed on his hand. He peacefully looked at the slightly surprised Rain Clan master and Emperor Ye duo. “Can’t you send someone less ordinary? Don’t you have other princes? Are you afraid that I’ll kill them again?”

Arrogant! Outrageous!

Everybody was shocked by Su Ping’s words.

Does this human know what he just said?

It was like stinging their nerves with a needle.?Why is he so arrogant? Does he really think he can leave this place alive?

“Ahhhhhhh…!”

A furious roar burst out; the scattered golden blood in the void was quickly gathered by a pulling force, reconstructing the young god.

He was so infuriated that he looked like an enraged God of Fire; scary veins were protruding all over his face. To be so heavily wounded while everybody was watching. It was utterly humiliating!

“I will cut you into a million pieces!” roared the young man. Golden flames burned all over his body, which changed while his bones cracked. He became taller, revealing himself as a majestic golden giant almost ten meters tall.

He clenched his fist, and a divine spear was materialized in the void; a golden cape also unfurled, covering his back and giving him an impressive image.

“Do all gods prefer talking over fighting?” Su Ping looked at him peacefully, his expression unchanging.

“Rot in hell!” the young man roared and charged with his spear. Dazzling brilliance burst out of the weapon as it aimed for the top of Su Ping’s head like a sun ray, making the void collapse.

Su Ping clenched his fist, and a divine sword appeared in his hand. It was one of the treasures obtained from Ye Chen’s residence, of Ascendant quality. Even though he couldn’t fully harness the sword’s Ascendant power just yet, it was still hard and sharp enough as a handy weapon.

Slay!

Su Ping waved his sword and slashed, injecting the power of his triple small worlds. Silver light flashed in his eyes; it was an unparalleled sword aura.

The Sky Executing Move!

Sword aura glittered like a rainbow, colliding with the enemy’s attack like a comet. The clash was so breathtaking that the Rain Clan juniors below the Ascendant State were dumbfounded, almost unable to believe their eyes.

Su Ping sliced the aftershock apart, then swung his sword again, ancient deity aura bursting out. It was the most original deity aura, which was even more powerful than divine power.

Su Ping’s sword aura was currently traverson thousands of meters and cutting the void apart.

A man was forced out of the void, vomiting blood; he was none other than the young god with the spear.

The onlookers were too shocked for words by such a scene.

The young clan member was probably careless in the beginning, when his body blew up, but he was undoubtedly being suppressed at the moment!

“How is it possible? He’s one of the prince candidates!”

“The genius most likely to rise in the future has failed just like this?”

“No way; I cannot accept this. How can this human be this strong? Both of them have triple small worlds. How did Alos lose?”

Many of the young clan members were wrought with shock and conflicting feelings.

The genius of their clan, one that everybody looked up to, had been publicly defeated by a human. The feeling was awful.

Although many of them had been secretly jealous of the guy, they were currently standing before a common foe. The situation concerned the honor of their clan!

Both of them have triple small worlds, but his small worlds are… too powerful!

The purple-haired old was also surprised when he found out the reason.

Small worlds weren’t equally powerful!

It all depended on how powerful the laws used in their making were!

Very few laws could exceed the four supreme laws.

There were three tiers of laws below the supreme laws, namely the orderly, the rare, and the fundamental.

Laws such as light, darkness, fire and lightning were of the fundamental kind, which were the building blocks of a world; even ordinary people could see the phenomena caused by those laws.

Rare laws were unobservable by ordinary people, only existing in the hidden side of the world. One had to be extremely perceptive to grasp them.

As for orderly laws—they were the top laws, which were very close to supreme laws. They were part of a world’s core.

The purple-haired elder had keen enough senses to realize he had never seen the aura given off by the laws in Su Ping’s triple small worlds; they were esoteric and arcane. He even thought he had seen supreme laws.

Did he construct the other two small worlds with orderly laws?

The elder’s heart shook upon thinking about it; he felt really excited, almost as if he were young again.

Others might not know what this implied. However, given his work in the Heaven Path Institute over myriads of years, he couldn’t have been more familiar with the structure of multiple small worlds.

It was as difficult to grasp an orderly law as to rise to the next level!

Many of the laws that the Major God had created couldn’t reach the orderly tier; most of them were fundamental. Only a few geniuses could grasp rare laws, and only the ones who made it to the Chaos Talents Rank could possibly understand orderly laws!

“This brat…”

The Rain Clan master became grim.

They had all realized how terrifying Su Ping’s small worlds were; not because of their quantity but because of their quality!

“Did someone help him? Or did he grasp them on his own? He’s a terrifying genius if he did it unaided. He cannot remain alive!”

Many of the Rain Clan’s elders were determined to kill Su Ping, even if they had to spare the other humans.

Su Ping would surely cause great trouble to their clan in the future if he survived!

Furthermore, they might have to ask for the Ancestral God’s help to take care of him!

“Ancestral God’s Shadow!”

Exactly at this moment—the young man regained his balance, eyes almost popping out because of fury. A majestic illusion emulating an ancient Ancestral God appeared behind his back.

The illusion seemed vague and vulnerable.

However, everybody felt pressure, including experts like the Rain Emperor.

That was the power of the ultimate Ancestral God!

Even a vague projection of his could produce tremendous pressure, making everybody give in!

“Heavenly Fire Constitution!” the young man roared to activate his bodily power. It was a powerful constitution of their clan, which he had awakened when he was still a fetus. He was at the moment covered in white flames, becoming even more dazzling than the sun; not even ordinary laws were able to restrict the heat.

He charged in the middle of the flames while holding his spear. His moves made it seem he was commanding a troop to attack Su Ping.

Coldness glittered in Su Ping’s eyes; he waved his sword and slashed again!

Yet again, it was the Sky Executing Move.

There was a boom—the sword aura swept over and extinguished the scorching heat!

He then swung the sword again, removing the golden light in the sky.

The sword aura appeared for a third time, cutting the young man like a wild dragon, darkening the divine spear.

The fourth sword aura struck in the exact same spot, flinging the young man back and making him bleed.

The fifth and sixth auras came in succession at that moment, one of them cutting the young man apart, while the other tore the void apart. He was about to be sucked into the hole—

It all happened in the blink of an eye. Su Ping had swung his sword six times, still making it look as if he would have only attacked once; his outburst was truly terrifying!

“You’re asking to be killed!”

The Rain Clan’s golden-robed old man suddenly took action with coldness in his eyes, given that Su Ping was about to kill the youngster. He was going to block the void power, or the young man would truly die!

“Humph. Be prepared to lose if you’re willing to gamble. Are you sore losers?” said the feather-crowned man with a snorth, while standing next to Su Ping. Another young man had been silent all this time; he suddenly took action and blocked the golden-robed elder.

Emperor Ye was cold. Brutality flashed in his eyes, but he took no action.

He had noticed that many seniors of other clans were watching at the moment.

It would truly be a disgrace if he were to intervene.

A scream burst out—the young man’s body was caught in the void and completely obliterated, along with his soul.

Su Ping was extremely ruthless, cutting time and space apart so that the guy couldn’t even resurrect. He had erased this part of the timeline with the void path.

It would be impossible for the guy to return, unless he possessed superior knowledge. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Rain Clan gods were shocked and infuriated after seeing their genius be killed. They were high-ranked gods; were they really going to end up being humiliated by a mere human being?

None of them were roaring at the moment; being killed in a duel was truly frustrating.

“Your prince was killed by me in exactly the same way. It was fair and square!”

Su Ping sneered and added, “Even though human beings don’t have an Ancestral God, we’re always open and frank. You slandered me, saying I stole your ultimate treasure; you didn’t deserve it if you didn’t take good care of it, anyway. Just come again if you’re not happy; I will kill anyone who is on my level. Who’s next?”

All the gods in the clan were infuriated, eyes bloodshot. They were eager to tear Su Ping into shreds.

He’s too arrogant!

The purple-haired senior covered his forehead. Even though Su Ping was a shockingly talented student, he did have a sharp tongue!

He truly didn’t consider retreat as an option!

If he had pissed someone off, he would continue with such a treatment!

“Let me!”

A furious young man stepped up, unleashing a dazzling golden light; he was determined to kill Su Ping.

The latter glanced back at him and sneered. “Don’t embarrass yourself if you’re just as weak as him; let your princes come, or I won’t have fun killing you!”

The young man almost vomited blood. Alos had just claimed to be an ordinary member only to make a greater case and present the Rain Clan as a powerful faction after killing Su Ping.

Who didn’t know that he was a top genius of the clan?

However, Su Ping had referred to him as a weak, ordinary member time and again, regardless of what the truth was. If he were just an ordinary member, what should geniuses be like?

The young man gnashed his teeth and said angrily, “If you’re scared, just cut off your arm, drop on your knees and die! Otherwise, let’s fight!”

“Hilarious!” Su Ping laughed and said, “Come here if you’re not scared of death.”

The young man couldn’t hold back any longer. He was about to step up—but the golden-robed elder stopped him.

The latter was grim-faced, knowing it was another of the top geniuses in his clan, and was even slightly stronger than Alos.

However, he wasn’t strong enough to defeat Su Ping.

Being in the Celestial State, he had seen how Su Ping wasn’t trying his best, even though he had indeed killed Alos!

“Maybe we’ll have to ask Hemuck to come,” whispered some of the clan’s experts, all frowns.

Other juniors below the Major God State could hardly beat Su Ping at the moment.

Reaching a tie would still be a humiliating sight.

The other members of the Rain Clan thought of the same person: Hemuck!

That was the most talented genius among the clan’s younger generation!

He wasn’t picked as a prince because of his weird temper. He was so devoted to cultivation that he would kill anyone who affected his training, even including family members.

The clan had him tested; he didn’t consider his clan a big deal, though. He was absolutely obsessed with cultivation—a cultivation lunatic even.

He wasn’t elected as prince due to lack of supporters.

“Hemuck isn’t here; he must be cultivating again.”

“Hemuck would surely die if he comes!”

The Rain Clan gods whispered amongst themselves.

Su Ping felt bored, seeing that the young man had stopped challenging him. He sneered upon hearing the whispers, then suddenly looked at Emperor Ye and the Rain Emperor. “I’ll fight you if there’s no one else capable, as long as you suppress your level. Do you dare to fight me?”

His announcement stunned all the people present.

The formerly whispering clan members looked at Su Ping in shock, as if they had just suffered a lightning strike.

Did he just challenge two God Emperors?

Not just them, even the purple-haired senior, the feather-crowned middle-aged man, and his shocked partners, who went to rescue the humans too. They gazed at Su Ping.

Is this man out of his mind?

He was but a mere Celestial God, and yet he was bold enough to challenge God Emperors!
