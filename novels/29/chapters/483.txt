Chapter 486 Future Tang Family Head

“Good.”

Su Ping nodded. He told the Swamp War Crocodile to quietly wait for him in the lake. The Swamp War Crocodile replied with a groan and then dived into the water. When looking from the distance, one would see a huge shadow in the lake, as if a Kraken were lurking below the surface. After having found a place for the Swamp War Crocodile, Su Ping followed one of the titled battle pet warriors and flew to the other side of the lake across the bridge. The streets were bustling with noises. Most of the people gathered were battle pet warriors; there were also some peddlers crying their wares.

Su Ping saw many billboards by the streets, all of them were related to the Supremacy League. “Sir, I have work to do, so I’ll be seeing you around. If you have any questions, you can turn to one of the staff members here.” That titled battle pet warrior didn’t linger after he dropped Su Ping off. He flew back to the city wall to resume his duties.

After he left, Su Ping landed on the street.

The battle pet warriors who were walking around on the street darted a look at the person who had just descended from the sky, but none of them was alarmed.

Titled battle pet warriors were rare in other base cities, but not in the Aurora Base City. Besides, the streets would always be packed with titled battle pet warriors during the Supremacy League, and with even more master and advanced battle pet warriors. “Anything can be put on sale here.” “Blood Nematodes? I’ve heard of such things. They are parasitic on other pets and would feed off the latter’s blood. When hungry, they would even crawl into their masters for food.”

Su Ping wandered around the street. He saw many products on sale that were banned items in other base cities. He saw some beasts that could spread contagious diseases, some weapons that were designed to weaken battle pet warriors, even one that could expel all astral powers from a certain area, and another that could generate electricity and shock the battle pet warrior when he or she wanted to mobilize astral powers. Those dirty weapons could not be put on the public market in other base cities.

Some assassination groups or adventurers would buy them on the black market so that they could hunt battle pet warriors as well when they encountered peers in the wildness. After all, hunting unprepared fellow battle pet warriors would be much easier than hunting wild, dangerous beasts. Nothing was more venomous than a human heart!

Beep, beep! While Su Ping was looking around, he heard his phone ringing. It was Qin Shuhai. “Yello?” “...Mr. Su, have you arrived yet?” Qin Shuhai sounded excited.

Su Ping noticed that trace of excitement. He had a theory. Qin Duhuang must have told Qin Shuhai when he left.

“I have just arrived. Where are you?” Su Ping asked. It would be nice to meet Qin Shuhai there, since Su Ping was completely unfamiliar with the place and the people. Qin Shuhai could show him around and tell him which stage the Supremacy League was at. “I’m standing by the stadium. Where are you? I can go and pick you up,” Qin Shuhai answered.

“I...”

Su Ping looked around at the buildings and noticed a billboard that stood out. “I have just arrived in the area and am standing on the street. I can see a pet store called ‘Shangri’ and a large billboard with a very curvy lady on it.” “Very curvy?” “Yes. Do you recognize this place?” “Well... I think so. Wait for me.”

Su Ping hung up the call and stayed in that area.

Soon, he heard someone approaching from behind. It was Qin Shuhai as he flew over.

“Ah, finally. Glad I didn’t miss you.” Qin Shuhai was relieved. For a moment he thought he had gone to the wrong place. Qin Shuhai looked at the billboard hung outside the bell tower. Was that the “very curvy” lady Su Ping talked about?

Yep, indeed, very curvy. The lady weighs more than one hundred kilos. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Shuhai hid his complaints inside him.

Su Ping was not who he was before. Qin Duhuang called Qin Shuhai and told him what happened in the Longjiang Base City. Qin Shuhai was dumbstruck when he heard that Su Ping was coming, riding on a beast king. Beast king! Those two words alone had made his heart race.

The fact that Su Ping could control a beast king was proof that he was one of the best at the titled rank!

Buttering someone up was a mission to be carried out as early as possible. Before the Elite League, Qin Shuhai would have watched the matches with Su Ping and refer to him as a brother. But at the moment, calling Su Ping ‘brother’ was no longer possible for Qin Shuhai.

He was aware of Su Ping’s many deeds. He was sure that if everything went well, Su Ping could very likely become a legendary battle pet warrior!

The friendship between Qin Shuhai and Su Ping... As a matter of fact, there wasn’t much of a friendship to talk about. The two had never been on a hunting trip together before, and Qin Shuhai had never done Su Ping a great favor. As such, Qin Shuhai was afraid to address Su Ping as a brother. After all, even his family head would address him with respect. If Qin Shuhai insisted on calling him Brother Su, the distinction between generations would be in a mess.

“You don’t have to call me Mr. Su. It sounds like I’m old.” Su Ping wanted to correct Qin Shuhai’s word choice and attitude. He was already too handsome to have peers or rivals. He didn’t want to be too strong to be left without friends.

How lonely would it be! Qin Shuhai laughed a hollow laugh. “I heard that you rode a beast king here. Mr. Su, you must be hell-bent on winning the championship!” Su Ping heaved a sigh. “I told you that you don’t have to call me Mr. Su. I am 19. You’re making me feel weird. Brother Qin, you don’t have to be so uptight with me.” The words “Brother Qin” filled Qin Shuhai with strong emotions. “Okay, then I won’t stand on ceremony with you, Mr. Su.” “Anyway, how is the competition going?” Su Ping asked. Qin Shuhai smiled. “Mr. Su, don’t worry. We’re still at the preliminary stage. It’s not the titled battle pet warriors’ turn yet, but I suppose you will get your turn tomorrow. The preliminary selection will end today.

“The selection is for the children from the major families or forces to have some fun and gain some experiences. The eliminatory rounds will end tomorrow. After that, participants at the titled rank can directly participate and fight for a good place.” Su Ping nodded. He had arrived at a proper time, as it was already afternoon time; he just had to wait one night and he would be able to participate. “Mr. Su, you must be here for the championship, right?” Qin Shuhai asked and he lowered his voice to continue, “I think you’ll very likely win first place. But I heard that many senior battle pet warriors are coming to take part in the competition.

Rumor has it that something is happening at the Deep Caves. Those guys want to come and get something to gain more strength. “I suppose this year’s Supremacy League will be very intense!” Su Ping nodded. He wasn’t worried.

With the Inferno Dragon-which had a combat strength of over 10 points—he would be able to defeat many battle pet warriors at the peak of the titled rank already. With the addition of the Dark Dragon Hound, he could even defeat a legendary battle pet warrior at the Ocean State. Of course, unless there would be someone incredible among those senior battle pet warriors, someone at the peak of the titled rank but with strength equal to the Void State. But no one had ever heard of that and it was very unlikely.

Of all the peak titled warriors that Su Ping knew, Leng Yingjun, aka, Venerable the Blade, was among the most famous. However, Su Ping was sure that the Inferno Dragon could be enough to overwhelm Venerable the Blade.

“What are the Deep Caves?”

Su Ping was curious. Qin Shuhai had become used to Su Ping’s ignorance. Su Ping was like a man living in the woods, detached from the world; many things that were seen as common knowledge for any titled battle pet warrior were new for him.

Qin Shuhai explained, “The Deep Caves are beast lairs. The cruelest and most violent beasts live there; I hear that beast kings are common and they come in great numbers. In the early days of the Blue Planet when beasts were running wild, the powerful battle pet warriors worked together and drove all the beasts to one place which later evolved into the Deep Caves.”

He went on, “Legendary battle pet warriors are guarding outside the Deep Caves all year round. Do you know why there are only two legendary battle pet warriors in our Subcontinent District? “There are other legendary battle pet warriors, but they have all gone off to the Deep Caves. It is said that the two legendary battle pet warriors will have to go as well when it is time for them to serve!” That explained it. Qin Shuhai suddenly brought up something else, “I’ve heard that the four ancient families and the Star Organization are sending participants to the Supremacy League as well.”

He was aware of what happened between Su Ping, the Tang family and the Star Organization, and there were quite a few battle pet warriors at the peak participating in the Supremacy League. Su Ping didn’t seem to be concerned. In his opinion, what happened between him those two factions was water under the bridge; they would only meet again as strangers. Of course, if they still thought otherwise, he could persuade them. “This way,” Qin Shuhai said. They arrived at a huge venue where a dense crowd was gathered in front of the gates. Some people were carrying their cute pets on their shoulders or walking alongside them.

Some pets were for battles and some pets were cute companions.

The second kind was quite popular with girls. That was the main reason why the number of battle pet warriors that majored in using pets of the undead family was small... It would be hard for those battle pet warriors to find a girlfriend, or a boyfriend for that matter.

Whoosh!

Qin Shuhai took to the skies. Su Ping did, too. They flew their way to the gates. Some grains of sand fell onto some of the people standing on the ground as the two flew across the crowd. They were angry but afraid to shout at them. After all, they were at the titled rank, a kind of people that could slap a common man to death and not have to shoulder any responsibility.

Titled battle pet warriors had their privileges! Soon, the two entered the stadium. Qin Shuhai unleashed some astral powers and moved an item across space. The guards allowed them in without having to see any tickets or invitations.

People were cheering loudly in the stadium.

A young man and a young lady were on stage; both seemed to be in their mid-twenties. Although young, both were master battle pet warriors!

The Supremacy League was indeed of a higher level than the Elite League. Warriors could be qualified to be seen as talent if they reached the master level at about the age of 25! Su Ping remembered that Leng Yingjun became a master battle pet warrior when he wasn’t even 20 years old. So, Leng Yingjun had been one of the outstanding young men in his youth.

Of course, Su Ping could also realize how difficult it had to be to reach the legendary rank.

Even after reaching the master rank before 20, Leng Yingjun was still stuck at the peak of the titled rank till this day; he had yet to take that final step!

Qin Shuhai took Su Ping to the areas closer to the stage. The other areas were quite packed, but there were a lot of empty seats there and the view was excellent.

Su Ping noticed that everyone who was sitting there was a titled battle pet warrior!

There were over a hundred of them!

That many titled battle pet warriors were enough to make a clean sweep of a Class B base city like the Longjiang Base City! “The young man on stage is a grandson of Senior Lv from the Lv family. The Lv family is not one of the four ancient families but they once had a legendary battle pet warrior!” Once they took their seats, Qin Shuhai continued with the introduction, “Many families that once had a legendary battle pet warrior failed to become part of the top-tier families due to various reasons, such as a shortage of talents or poor management. Even so, those families are not to be ignored or offended! “The families that have legendary battle pet warriors serving at the Deep Caves are taken care of by the Tower and they enjoy a higher status than the four ancient families.

Not even the legendary battle pet warriors out here would dare to displease those families! “After all, if the young in their families are bullied, who would want to go and serve at the Deep Caves in the future?” Su Ping asked, “Does the Star Organization have a legendary battle pet warrior?” “They did. But that legendary battle pet warrior went to the Deep Caves many years ago, and I heard he passed away in the Deep Caves.”

Qin Shuhai thought of something. Scared, he added in a hurry, “The Star Organization has no legendary battle pet warrior but the Tower has been taking care of them. What happened between you and the Star Organization is not a big deal and what you asked of them would not hurt their foundation. Still, the Tower would have stepped in if things had gone too bad.” Su Ping nodded. He understood that Qin Shuhai was just providing a piece of honest advice. Of course, he didn’t plan on doing anything to the Star Organization, to begin with.

He was not a maniac.

The past was long gone, water under the bridge. While Su Ping and Qin Shuhai were chatting, someone interrupted them, “Is that... Mr. Su?” The two of them saw several people standing next to them with some elderly people in the group; Su Ping recognized Tang Mingqing amongst them. It was Tang Mingqing who asked the question. Qin Shuhai was a bit agitated. He was there on behalf of the Qin family. He was afraid that the Qin family would get involved in the dispute between Su Ping and the Tang family. “The Tang family?” Su Ping glanced over at Tang Mingqing and another elder of the Tang family that he once kept captive. The other old man in the group was also at the peak of the titled rank, just like Tang Mingqing. There were also a couple of middle-aged men that seemed to be at the upper position of the titled rank.

The one who caught Su Ping’s attention was the girl with bright eyes and graceful eyebrows standing in the middle. She seemed to be in her twenties.

However, there was coldness on her face and indifference in her eyes. She seemed to be a girl completely void of emotions. Su Ping noticed that she looked familiar. He thought of Tang Ruyan. “And this is?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows. Tang Mingqing and the others were startled, seeing that Su Ping was gazing at the girl. They discreetly stood around the girl to protect her. “She is our future family head.” Tang Mingqing smiled a hollow smile. He looked at Qin Shuhai, realizing he was the one titled King of Swords, a famous young titled battle pet warrior. But Tang Mingqing had never cared about people who couldn’t grow further.

Tang Mingqing was happy to see that the golden haired girl was not present. Su Ping was also powerful, but Tang Mingqing was sure that with so many elders on their side, they would not lose to Su Ping if a fight were to break out. “Future family head?” That was within Su Ping’s expectation. After remembering what they did to Tang Ruyan, Su Ping fixed his eyes on the girl. Tang Ruyan used to be the front. This girl was the real deal. “What? Aren’t you afraid that your actual future family head could fall victim to assassination now?” Su Ping asked. Tang Mingqing forced a smile. “Ruyan has lost her value as a front and our future family head has been exposed. Hiding her is useless at this point. So, we brought her to have a try at the Supremacy League. So, Mr. Su, are you planning to participate as well?” Su Ping replied with a grin, “Are you implying that I have accidentally messed up your front?”

“No, no,” Tang Mingqing answered at once. The other family elders glared at Su Ping coldly. They knew that the actions of the legendary battle pet warrior from this young man’s store had cost a Feather Army and a Tactic Army of the Tang family! They had lost two thousand master battle pet warriors! That was a force large enough to cripple a Class C base city!

Or, even some Class B base cities!

That was such a deep wound that the Tang family was grieved to the extent of wishing to die! That being said, they dared not to take revenge.

The fact that two thousand master battle pet warriors perished within one move was a shocking enough piece of news. Not even a legendary battle pet warrior could have done that!

Su Ping looked at them for a while and inwardly heaved a sigh. It was rare that they would meet each other. However, none in the group asked anything about Tang Ruyan. It seemed that they didn’t care for her at all.

Is that how the family bonds worked in a big family?

Su Ping could see the point but could not accept it.

“You view that gal as the front. But, do you know what I think? This real future family head of yours is not all that good,” Su Ping commented on the aloof girl.

The girl was at the master rank. One rank higher than Tang Ruyan’s! The girl was almost as talented as Venerable the Blade, but so what? After all, Venerable the Blade has been stuck at the peak of the titled rank for some time. Give the girl 10 years and provided that everything could go well, she would just be another Venerable the Blade. She would have to be extremely lucky to reach the legendary rank! Tang Mingqing, as well as the other elders, were furious to hear this ill-willed comment. “My sister is with you?” the girl asked. Cold as her voice was, it did sound sweet. Su Ping didn’t answer her. “If you think she’s too much of a bother, kill her,” the girl added, and her face was just as indifferent as before. It seemed as if she weren’t talking about a living and breathing person, but an object that could be replaced. Su Ping was not happy about that. “She cannot even be a double. She has no value and has nothing to do with the Tang family. If she displeases you, kill her. None of us in the Tang family will mind,” the girl calmly went on. All of a sudden, Su Ping felt a surge of anger inside him. He didn’t know where that anger came from. After all, Tang Ruyan was just his prisoner. “Why are all the younger sisters I meet so intractable?” Su Ping asked. The girl frowned. It seemed that Su Ping was talking to himself. He looked into her eyes. “The Tang family has made a grave mistake by choosing you as the future family head. At the very least, I think your big sister is much better than you are.” “If you say so.” The girl didn’t argue with him. Tang Mingqing frowned. “Mr. Su, please enjoy the matches. We will excuse ourselves, hopefully we’ll see you around.” Then, they left without further ado. The other Tang family elders cast one final unkind look at Su Ping but they didn’t show their killing intent. They were smarter than that.

To make an enemy of someone like Su Ping over some argument was pointless.

The Tang family needed to save some dignity and they would have broken into a fight with anyone else who dared to utter those words, but the legendary battle pet warrior behind Su Ping was just that threatening. After they were farther away, the elders set up a seal and whispered.

“Is he that store owner Su? I don’t see what the big deal is about him.”

“He’s just a big show-off just because of his connection with a legendary battle pet warrior. Ptss!”

“Young lady, don’t mind him. He’s just a crazy man.”

The girl stayed composed. “I don’t mind. All those people will be under my feet when I become a legendary battle pet warrior. I will lead the Tang family to a height never before reached!” “Indeed. That is your target, to become a legendary battle pet warrior!” The others nodded with smiles. It was a good thing that she was unaffected. Their Tang family would climb to greater heights when their young mistress became a legendary battle pet warrior!

Qin Shuhai fearfully watched the Tang family members leave and said, “She’s impressive!”

The girl remained calm even while standing in front of two titled battle pet warriors. Qin Shuhai believed that, given time, the girl would surpass him!

“Impressive?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows and snorted in contempt. What was impressive about her? A poker-face girl. Dead meat. Qin Shuhai didn’t have the courage to utter a single word. Soon, they heard another one calling Su Ping. “Mr. Su?”

Su Ping found that voice familiar. It was Venerable the Blade.

“Are you here to participate as well?” Venerable the Blade asked with a forced smile.
