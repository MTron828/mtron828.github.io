Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping returned to the ancient universe and looked at the vast world. He was no longer as shocked as when he first paid a visit. Only mixed feelings remained.

I wonder if the Chief Elder has prepared for the thing I told him last time, thought Su Ping.

He took Joanna to the continent where the Heaven Path Institute was located with a single thought.

He looked at the neighboring continent, then remembered the Ancestral God of the Bright Moon Clan. Coldness glinted in his eyes.

However, he didn’t look for him right away; he went to the institute first.

!!

Yan Qing and the other elders sensed his arrival and rushed to greet him.

He looked at them and said, “There’s no need to make such a fuss.”

“Ancestor Su, you are now an Ancestral God, and you deserve such a privilege,” said the Chief Elder with a smile.

Su Ping didn’t linger on that topic. He said, “Chief Elder, regarding the Heavens, what’s the opinion of the other clans?”

The elder’s smile disappeared; he said solemnly, “Ancestor Su, we’ve already informed all the clans. Ancestral God Wen Tian is aware of the matter too, and confirmed it not long ago. However…”

“However, what?” Su Ping narrowed his eyes.

“However, this is a big matter that will influence all clans. The Seven Greatest Clans have the final say. So far, they haven’t planned to meet to consider the situation…” The Chief Elder lowered his head. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All the other elders were silent.

In fact, the situation was even more humiliating than what the Chief Elder had let on.

The Heaven Path Institute told all the clans about Su Ping’s warning. However, none of them paid much attention to it; they thought it was a move for the Heaven Path Institute to rule over the world of gods leveraging the help of the new Ancestral God.

In any case, the institute was a school, not a clan. It did have three more Ancestral Gods, but their academic position was sensitive, and was supervised by the Seven Greatest Clans.

Even after issuing a warning about the impending threat of the Heavens, not only did the clans dislike it, even the main seven clans accused them of fretting and minding other people’s business. They were told not to forget their identity.

The Council of Gods—formed by the Seven Greatest Clans—was in charge of all the important matters. Their rejection had turned the warning into a joke.

“There’s no meeting?” Su Ping’s eyes turned cold. “They’re only going to move until the Heavens arrive? They thought I was bullsh***ing when I was an emperor. They still think the same now that I’m an Ancestral God?”

Noticing Su Ping’s fury, the Chief Elder quickly said, “Ancestor Su, don’t be angry. The Seven Greatest Clans have controlled the world of gods for ages. This takes time; we’ve been sending elders to communicate with them. The situation will be much better when Ancestral God Wen Tian comes out of seclusion; at least they’ll be willing to listen to us. It is my belief that they’ll understand.”

“So, they were even unwilling to listen in the past?” Coldness flashed in Su Ping’s eyes as an intense killing intent burst out.

He remembered the Original Dragons, and his fury was reignited.

How could they be so arrogant?

Why are they so arrogant?

The Chief Elder quickly said, “Ancestor Su, please don’t be angry. You are indeed an honorable Ancestral God, but there are too many Ancestral Gods in the Seven Greatest Clans. If any of them is provoked, the other six families will move to help. I believe they will listen to us when the first president wakes up.”

Su Ping knew that by first president he was referring to the very first Ancestral God of the institute.

After talking with Ancestral God Wen Tian, Su Ping learned that the first two Ancestral Gods were away for their own reasons. One of them was asleep, while the other was caught in a dangerous land. That place was so dangerous that even Ancestral God Wen Tian could get caught in it too if he tried to save the fellow. If that came to pass, the Heaven Path Institute would be in danger without an Ancestral God to guard the fort.

“If they’re unwilling to listen on their feet, they will listen on their knees!”

Su Ping suddenly turned around and said, “Lead the way!”
