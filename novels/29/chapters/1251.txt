Chapter 1252 Oblivion (1)

Su Ping couldn’t help but ask, “Master, are you going to sacrifice your original self?”

“It’s hard for me to return in one piece today.” Shen Huang was solemn as he replied; no lies were said.

Although he had foreseen it, Su Ping’s heart shivered when he heard his master. He was overwhelmed by grief.

He had been but a nominal disciple to Shen Huang; the man had only sent his battle pet, Elder Yan, to teach him some skills.

However, the man was now willing to make such a great sacrifice for a disciple he barely knew. That exceeded Su Ping’s expectation.

Su Ping remained silent.

The favor was too great for him to express his gratitude with words.

“Get ready.”

Shen Huang became stern all of a sudden. Su Ping was then able to sense how the energy in the universe was quickly being extracted; it gathered around Shen Huang’s body.

“Watch out! He might be trying to escape!”

Outside—the three Celestial attackers noticed that Shen Huang was being surrounded by burning sunlight, as if preparing to release an ultimate skill. However, their ample battle experience allowed them to discern that it was probably not an attack. It might just be a ruse to make his getaway.

Ye Chen would never stand idle and let Su Ping return to the store.

Sleeping in peace was rare since he fled from the store back then. He had heard tales about that demonic store; every store caretaker would rise to become stronger than Deity Emperors and would dominate their eras. Waiting for death would be the only option if Su Ping only stayed in the store and cultivated.

Su Ping had fallen to temptation and ventured outside; Ye Chen would surely make use of the rare opportunity and kill Su Ping no matter the cost!

“Deity Realm, Godly Mark!”

Ye Chen waved his hands, unleashing an ancient deity technique. The previous Hellish Realm was transformed; a small universe surfaced behind him and melted into the realm. A stream of intimidating power was then spread out, freezing time and space. Space was temporarily sealed, even though they were in the ninth space.

“Huh?”

Shen Huang sensed the changes around him and his expression became stern. He transformed his power and furiously slashed with his saber. He was planning to break the barriers of the universe, but he had to keep on fighting. He didn’t think that Ye Chen was able to block that space for an extended period of time. After all, that was the chaotic ninth space; being able to seal it was already quite shocking.

The Saint King and Mo Ri—the Celestial from the Doom Star Zone—were just as shocked, not expecting Ye Chen to have such a terrifying method. Neither of them thought they could escape if they were eventually trapped.

Celestials could hardly be killed because they were good at escaping. However, Ye Chen’s technique had actually stopped Shen Huang from running away.

As expected of the devil from ancient times. He indeed has something to rely on and be reborn in this age. The Saint King’s eyes glittered, doing a good job in hiding his killing intent. They were still partners at the moment.

“I cannot hold for too long. Hurry up!” Ye Chen stood in the void, enduring the powerful tearing force of the ninth space and the other lingering forces. He wore a painful yet determined expression.

The Saint King whispered and suddenly raised his hands, gathering white threads in his hands. An angel-like pet with four white wings appeared behind him at the same time and then merged with his master. The man instantly unfolded two pairs of wings and became taller. His old self then turned into a middle-aged man.

A hollow and sacred aura was revealed on his forehead, and a third eye was opened. He gouged the eye with his bare hand; white blood flowed out of the wound.

“Dusk of Gods!” the Saint King said unhurriedly; his hand glowed and illuminated the void, raising terrifying and bloodcurdling

auras.

Shen Huang narrowed his eyes and couldn’t remain calm any longer. He roared, “Are you truly going to do this?”

He was truly angry now.

He could understand the man’s actions because of Su Ping’s ominous potential. Furthermore, the Planet of Origin would be invincible if the Saint Heir had the legacy; they would no longer need to keep a low profile. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The loss of a 100,000 year-old friendship was not a big deal; however, it was surprising to see the Saint King try so hard.

That technique would damage the Saint King’s own body; no one had tried as hard to kill Su Ping!

“Where are you looking?” a cold voice was suddenly heard. Mo Ri appeared behind Shen Huang like a ghost, slashing once again with the Nether Saber.

Shen Huang’s expression changed a bit and fought back.

The two ancient and worn out weapons clashed. Space instantly started to tremble and hum. A stream of a strange power was spread out, as if something had been activated.

Mo Ri was forced to retreat. The Nether Saber was shivering; he could sense an unyielding consciousness inside!

“It’s the saber soul!”

Mo Ri was dazed and delighted, never thinking that his saber’s soul was still there, and that it would be roused at that very moment!

That trip had already been rewarding enough for him.

It didn’t react when I fought the Sword God, but it woke up just now. Shen Huang’s weapon must be very famous; you felt the desire to fight it! Mo Ri laughed with excitement, feeling the Nether Saber’s consciousness. At the moment he thought he had all the advantages, and that Shen Huang would surely die!
