Chapter 1473 The Planet of Origin (2)

“Mr. Chi Ying, would you like to come with us? We could use some extra help,” said Crowe.

Chi Ying felt dazed for a moment, then glanced at Su Ping as he realized what was going on. He instantly nodded and said, “No problem. This is our home too; I’m responsible for protecting it!”

“Okay.”

The three cyborg leaders were all smiles, seeing that both Su Ping and Chi Ying were so easily convinced. “Let’s go now,” said Su Ping. “Now?”

!!

The humanoid trio was rather surprised, not expecting Su Ping to be that fast.

“Do you have to make preparations?” asked Su Ping.

“Not really. This is actually better; we’ll be sooner at ease once we figure out the reason,” said Basha.

“In that case, let’s go. We have a map of the green glass. We’ll exit the glass from somewhere else and take a detour to avoid the point of impact; that way we won’t meet anyone head-on,” said Crowe.

Su Ping nodded.

“Master, you’ll have to take care of the human clan for now,” said Su Ping to Shen Huang.

Slightly concerned, the latter said, “Be careful, and come back if it’s truly dangerous.”

“Okay.”

The other Celestial State experts were slightly worried, too. Su Ping was their backbone at the moment; if anything happened to him, they didn’t know how they could preserve the human bloodline.

The group of five left the temple; Su Ping and Chi Ying followed the three cyborgs to a place right underneath the green glass.

There were no cities within a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers. It was absolutely desolate, and only a few animals roamed about. The excessive radiation in that place made it difficult for beasts to get close.

“This was the first gate we planned in the

past.”

Basha stared at the green glass above her and said, “We had imagined that a war would eventually take place somewhere beyond the sky, and this was to be the first stop of our march.”

Su Ping gave her a slight nod. The pressure imposed on a race always surrounded by monsters was enormous; this would motivate them to pursue extreme power.

“This was the mark left when we tried to tear the green glass open, but we were only testing; we never really broke it.” Crowe pointed at a part of the green glass where there was a shallow mark, invisible to the naked eye. Only Ascendants who had mastered a perfect Great Dao could sense it.

“Let’s sneak out from here,” said Basha.

“We’ll have to work together. The three of us are barely capable of breaking through,” said Crowe.

“Let me do it.”

Su Ping didn’t hide his strength. He wasn’t trying to show off; it was because the matter was of critical importance. He wanted to make as little disturbance as possible, preventing anyone outside from finding out.

“Huh?”

The others looked at him in surprise.

Su Ping didn’t say anything. He simply raised a hand with a slow gesture, manifesting a scorching power in his palm. Once the arm was fully raised, the power had been fully accumulated, as if he were holding a sun. The energy emitted was terrifying to the others.

“Well…”

They were appalled, as they could sense the Great Dao’s pure power. However, such power was too unimaginably strong for someone in the Dao Heart State.

Boss, he’s truly… Chi Ying looked at Su Ping in shock, instantly confirming that Su Ping had surpassed the universe dominator realm and reached the Undying State that he looked up to.

Above that level was the end of all cultivation, the chaos ancestor realm that stood above all races! The scorching Fire Dao was condensed into a ray that looked like a golden sword. It slowly drew a line underneath the sky, causing a tiny crack.

Su Ping covered everyone with the aura of illusion and said, “Let’s go!”

After that, he made a move and was the first to dash out.

The other four reacted despite their shock. They followed and exited the green glass planet.

Su Ping then saw the dim and dark universe. The green glass behind them was like a glimmering grain of dust, utterly inconspicuous.

“There’s some aura left…”

He noticed a feeble aura in space. Although most of it was erased, there were still some marks. It seemed that they had left in too much of a hurry to wipe it clean.

Su Ping’s eyes turned into the eyes of chaos, and noticed that space was twisted and time was reversed. He saw that the aura was increasingly obvious, but he didn’t see any figure, even though he went back to review time up to a month.

The mark was left two days prior.

“Have they erased their traces in history?”

Su Ping never expected to find too many things from history anyway. He considered for a moment and asked his teammates, “Should we follow up?”

Basha and the others were still looking around. That was their first time ever stepping out of the green glass and observing the universe their ancestors described. Although they had seen it in their ancestors’ memories, it was the first time seeing it in person. It was slightly different from what they were told.

Furthermore, there were no monsters lurking around the green glass. They felt both lucky and delighted. Have the monsters already left the universe after such a long time?

The cyborgs finally took note of the vague marks in the void. They looked at each other, then Basha asked, “Would we alarm them if we recklessly followed them?”

“They didn’t even wipe their marks clean. They might not be able to detect us,” said Su Ping.

The humanoid trio was rendered speechless. The other possibility was that the marks were left for the purpose of luring them.

“You can’t be overly cautious all the time if you want to get rid of danger completely,” said Su Ping after realizing what they were thinking.

The three of them hesitated and talked amongst themselves for a long time, eventually agreeing.

Su Ping didn’t waste any more time. He quickly led them forward.

Half a day later, Su Ping saw a glimmering planet in the dark space. Right when he saw the planet-a furious wind emerged from it and a voice was directly sent to the heads of all living creatures.

What shocked Su Ping and Chi Ying was that the voice seemed to be cursing in the language of the Federation.

“That voice. It seems to belong to…”

Chi Ying’s eyes widened, somehow finding the voice familiar. After listening to it carefully, he looked at Su Ping with a crazy thought in his head.

Su Ping noticed Chi Ying’s odd behavior and instantly asked via telepathy, “What’s wrong?”

“I think it’s the Primordial Empyrean Master…” Chi Ying replied with disbelief on his face.

Su Ping was shocked. He remembered that the Planet of Origin was the first to flee. According to Kayafollet, they had coordinates in a place beyond the universe. He didn’t expect to meet them there. “It’s them.”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and quietly spread his senses. He soon discovered a lot of auras on that planet; most of them belonged to Ascendants, and five were in the Celestial State.

In addition, there was a universe dominator openly releasing his aura.

Su Ping saw that it was a white-robed old man. However, the guy was blushing while he yelled and cursed crazily.

“They are indeed from the Federation.” Su Ping recognized the buildings and clothes of those people; they matched with what he had seen in Kayafollet’s memories. It truly was the Planet of Origin, and the old man was the Primordial Empyrean Master, the strongest man in the old Federation. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He had already reached the Dao Heart State.

No wonder the twelve Celestial State experts obeyed him. Even someone as strong as the Saint King had to run errands for him.

“Why are they here? Why are they making such a racket? Do they want to get killed?” Su Ping was gloomy. He didn’t like them at all. Since the man continued with his roaring, Su Ping flashed to float somewhere above the Planet of Origin. An abundant power was spread out, enveloping the entire planet.

That way it was impossible for the man’s roar to spread out.

Su Ping moved closer to where the white-robed old man was and yelled at him.

“Shut up!”
