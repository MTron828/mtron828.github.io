Chapter 1482 Annihilation With One Sword Attack (1)

Once back in the Archean Divinity, Su Ping found the divine power in the air familiar. It had been a hundred years since his last visit. It was a mere blink for the other Celestials, but it was long enough for him to reminisce.

The divine power he pursued in the past was like thin water in Su Ping’s eyes. When compared with the aura of chaos, divine power was like exploited refugees that had nothing but bones left.

He spread his consciousness and entered the Original Dao World, soon realizing where he was. He wasn’t planning on returning to the Heaven Path Institute. Going through a tribulation was crucial for any God King, but it didn’t give him any pressure.

He was just a God King at the moment, but his current power was enough to shatter the test, even if he faced the most terrifying black tribulation.

His main concern was the Ancestral God tribulation.

He was planning to go through the process alone in a desolate area.

Whoosh!

He disappeared soon after and arrived at the border of a mid-ranked clan’s territory. The place was extremely desolate; even the strongest creature was merely in the Celestial State.

Su Ping released his aura and scared off all the beasts.

Once the area within hundreds of thousands of kilometers was cleared, he summoned all his pets, hoping that his Ancestral God tribulation could inspire them.

“Come on.”

Su Ping released his aura.

The aura had to be on full display while passing the tribulation. Some people had to seek the protection of experts to hide from enemies. Most people were protected by their seniors and their enemies wouldn’t have a chance.

Su Ping thought of the Rain Clan, but didn’t consider it a big deal. If they truly pestered him, he would have them pay a bloody price. Even if the Rain Ancestor showed up in person, he wouldn’t get anything good; after all, he was basically an immortal when he entered the cultivation sites.

Certain changes happened quietly in the world as he revealed his aura.

The originally thin air began to solidify. Then, something seemed to be injected into it, making it as sticky and heavy as seawater; even the wind became oppressive and violent.

The next moment, light gradually went away and the world became dark.

Thick clouds appeared and gathered from all over, filling up the sky. They were like a spider’s web about to catch prey.

Su Ping raised his head and stared in silence.

The breeze rustled his hair. His eyebrows were like sharp blades and his eyes were like stars. There was calmness and a hint of loneliness on his face. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The thunderclouds gradually covered the skies above Su Ping. Thunder rumbled and the world became grim.

The roaring lightning seemed to be yelling at him.

Su Ping watched the thunderclouds change. They soon turned red, and a deep dark followed. All the lightning bolts inside were black.

Boom!

The first lightning strike arrived without any warning

However, Su Ping didn’t move in the slightest; he didn’t even bother to bat an eye. The lightning passed through his body as if he were a phantom, not even moving his hair.

“If this is your best… might as well get lost!”

Su Ping spoke softly, as if talking to himself. However, his last two words were so loud that the thunderclouds shook, as if unable to handle it.

The ocean of heavy clouds seemed to be dissipating, but they recovered and surged again moments after.

However, the buildup time was much longer.

At the same time-inconspicuous auras appeared in the void nearby.

“It truly is him. Damn it, he’s still alive!”

“That beast’s son, he’s causing trouble again. Unforgivable!”

“Damn it, the other clans haven’t realized it yet. We should work together and kill him!”

“He’s actually going through a tribulation? Is it a God Emperor’s tribulation? He killed so many God Emperors while still not being one himself…”

Angry voices whispered, while many eyes were staring at Su Ping with hate. They hoped that he would be completely destroyed by the terrifying black tribulation.

That kind of tribulation was very dangerous, even for renowned geniuses. Too many of them had been killed in the process.

Someone said that if all the geniuses killed by the black tribulation were brought back to life, there would be fifty percent more top experts in the world.

It wasn’t a lie. After all, the geniuses who could invoke a black tribulation were the very best of their generation. Some were unsurpassable, even in the span of a million years.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Many figures stepped out. They were the elders from the Heaven Path Institute.

Yan Qing had sensed Su Ping’s aura and informed the other elders as soon as possible to go there. They knew that the Rain Clan would also detect Su Ping’s aura. He would be in danger if they shamelessly hunted him like in the past, and if the Rain Ancestor participated.

Su Ping had survived back then, but he couldn’t be as lucky every time.

“It’s true that all geniuses are young.”

An old man stroked his white beard with a smile and delight in his eyes. Elder Yan Qing had told him a lot about Su Ping, but he had never seen him in person. The Rain Clan had erased the battle from history and nobody could reverse time to watch it. Nobody could see their humiliating moments, ever.
