Chapter 345 All-out Sprint!

“Do you mean like a freeloader, only with the Heaven’s Test?”

Her proposal took Su Ping by surprise.

Joanna was making it sound as if she weren’t talking about the Heaven’s Test, but of getting a free meal or free wifi.

“Yes, like scourging off someone’s Heaven’s Test.” Joanna gave an affirmative answer. “Find a creature that is about to reach the legendary rank and when their Heaven’s Test begins, let your pets join in. You can bring your pets back to life even when they are killed by the Heaven’s Test, right? So, your pets can take the Heaven’s Test many times.”

Su Ping stared dumbfounded at Joanna.

That... might actually work!

In the cultivation site, his pets would not die for real and they could have their energy refined by the Heaven’s Test! That should be the quickest and most efficient method!

This method could work well!

“How smart of you, to come up with this method. Indeed, the ones living long years are usually wily old foxes!” Su Ping could not help but exclaim.

Joanna pulled a long face. “It’s not about my wit, but your foolishness! Besides, my true self has indeed been living a long time, but I don’t share memories with my true self. It was just that when I was born, my true self passed me some inherent abilities. Theoretically speaking, I’m only 17 this year!”

Su Ping was shocked.

Seventeen?

“How can you be so scheming if you are just seventeen?”

“You!”

Joanna bit her teeth in fury.

Su Ping laughed but stopped joking after that. Anyways, Joanna’s proposal had settled his crying needs. Otherwise, he would still be at a loss as to what to do.

“Let’s go. But I don’t think it’s going to be easy to find someone or something nearing the legendary rank.” Su Ping was still worried.

The method was a good one but he supposed that finding the right creature was far from being a piece of cake.

“Hmm. That I can help you with.”

Joanna snorted. Since Su Ping was going to leave for the Divinity, she would not stay in the nursing pen alone. She stepped out and grew to a human size. She had to adjust her size because her original self would be too huge for that place.

Su Ping nodded. Joanna could ask her subordinates to find such creatures. It would be much easier than him trying to find the right creature all by himself. “Thanks. When we are done with this, I am going to give you an excellent rating in the evaluation,” Su Ping said.

He could evaluate his employees every month.

A rating of excellence could give 10 points to the employee.

Better than excellent was outstanding, which could add 50 points.

Since Joanna had been helping him with pet training and had just solved a big problem for him, she deserved to have the highest rating but Su Ping thought he’d better pace himself. If he were to give her the best rating at every evaluation, she wouldn’t learn to cherish it. Besides, she would be more motivated with the prospect of a better rating.

Huh, what an evil mind!

Joanna became dazed for a second after hearing his words.

She was surprised to hear him mention the evaluation. She had been working for Su Ping without complaining because training pets for him was easy. She would always delegate the work to her subordinates.

In the meantime, she could go back to her residence to have a good time or deal with something of her own.

Therefore, to her, working for him was a fair deal.

She would trade for opportunities to go back to the Divinity while working for him.

It was a surprise that Su Ping, whom she had never buttered up intentionally, was going to give her a good result at the evaluation.

She had learned that she could get 10 points for each rating of excellence.

The previous time, for that weird mission, she got 20 missions. If she could get the 10 points this time, she would have 30 points.

She had 100 points at the beginning. In total, she would have 130 points, one step closer to getting the 200 points, and to become an excellent employee.

Su Ping was merely giving her a good score at the rating but when she became an excellent employee, that would mean an actual step-up in her status and she could have a chance to visit any world she liked.

That was her goal.

She thought of the outstanding level in the rating, which was better than excellence. A trace of excitement flashed past her eyes.

“Time to go.”

Su Ping searched for the Demigod Burial and went in.

“To find wild beasts that are about to reach the legendary rank is a bit hard. They won’t wait for us, either.”

They had arrived. Joanna was analyzing the situation for Su Ping, “We have to turn to our people. I will put up posters and send the message across the city. I will ask those who are about to reach the legendary rank to come here and I will offer them a generous reward and give them artifacts that can help them better cope with the Heaven’s Test.”

Su Ping could tell that Joanna was taking the matter seriously. “That is good. But will we hinder their progress if we want to mooch off their Heaven’s Test?”

Joanna’s first reaction was to say yes, of course. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But she noticed that might sound like she was despising Su Ping for asking a silly question. She paused to re-organize her answer and make it softer. “There can be some influence. Usually, when one is about to reach the legendary rank, a safe place is sought, somewhere no other living creatures can get close to. Once other living creatures appear during the Heaven’s Test, it’ll become much harder!”

Su Ping was surprised. “Do pets also count as those living creatures?”

“No. Pets and masters have contracts. Nature recognizes pets and masters as one,” Joanna explained.

Su Ping nodded. “But when my pets go and join in the Heaven’s Test, will the person undergoing the test be killed?” Su Ping had more questions. Joanna replied, “The test will be harder but I will give them some artifacts to help them pull it off even with your pets’ presence. Of course, if that person is just too weak, there is nothing else I can do. But such a person’s death is not to be regretted.”

Soon, he thought of something else. “You must have many treasures and artifacts. Can you... give me some?”

Joanna was speechless. She regretted saying more than she should.

What a greedy little businessman!

“Well... I suppose...” The prospect of getting a good score at the evaluation helped her make up her mind. She agreed readily.

Su Ping was overjoyed. He was aware that he was coming off as greedy but he was tempted. This was the Divinity. Joanna’s artifacts had to be quite powerful!

He would only acquire a couple of treasured artifacts after going through hardships in the Mysterious Realm. If he could get something here, he would be invincible!

He blamed himself for not thinking about this earlier.

While Su Ping was blaming himself, he suddenly heard the system’s voice. “The host is not advised to get those things. The host will not be able to use them in the real world even if the host can take them away from the cultivation site.”

What?

That was a wet blanket over his head. Cannot use them? Why the hell not?

“The items from the cultivation site contain the rules of their original world and those rules can be mutually exclusive to the rules of the host’s world!” the system explained, “A case in point would be if you ask Joanna to take one of her people to your world, that person would have to stay in the store. That is because of the rules of the world!”

Su Ping still found it hard to understand. “Then why can I take pets out from the cultivation sites, as well as pet food?”

The system replied, “It is because this store is a pet store. The pets are captured with beast-catching rings that can help eliminate some of the conflicts of rules of different worlds. Also, pets that are taken from the cultivation sites are sold legitimately. The store will completely erase the incompatible rules!

“That applies to both the pets and the items sold in the store. Both can be taken away from the store.

“However, the store doesn’t offer sales of treasured artifacts. Therefore, the artifacts the host takes out from the cultivation sites can only stay within the store and will be utterly useless once they are away from the bounds of the store.”

Su Ping was speechless.

The glint of hope that had just been kindled died away instantly.

He tried to weep but failed to shed a tear.

Then, he remembered the Little Skeleton’s bone blade.

“First, that bone blade is not a treasure. Of course, there was some effect of the rules from that world on the blade. However, that bone blade has become part of your skeleton pet. The rules of the other world have been assimilated,” the system stated.

Su Ping curled his lips.

Su Ping took a deep breath and told Joanna, “Never mind. I don’t want your artifacts.”

Joanna was puzzled.

He didn’t want them?

She became alerted. He didn’t want the artifacts. Was he trying to ask her for something more serious?!

“Those are all your belongings. You must have worked hard to collect them. I am your boss and I shouldn’t take stuff from my employee.” Su Ping kept a straight face, sounding sincere.

Joanna blinked in disbelief.

Since when did this guy become so kind? But you’ve already taken enough from me! You drained almost half of my spring!

You took Divine Crystals!

At the thought of the spring, Joanna felt vexed. She, too, took a deep breath to calm herself down. She eyed Su Ping with doubt. “What do you want then?”

The look in her eyes embarrassed him. He blurted out in anger, “Put away that look on your face! Do you think I’m one of those unethical bosses that would covet their employees’ things?”

Yes! Joanna said to herself.

But not to him.

Su Ping snorted and put on a proud face. “I told you that I no longer want your artifacts and that is a promise. I won’t take that back. I won’t take the artifacts even if you try to force them on me!”

Joanna found his actions strange. She took a closer look at him. At the same time, she didn’t think he was lying, which was to her relief. She thought for a moment. “Actually, I do have something that may suit you well. I’m going to have someone get them for you later.”

She wouldn’t mind if Su Ping only wanted a couple of artifacts. What she was scared of was that Su Ping could demand an exorbitant price and clean out her collections. After all, humans were greedy creatures and always would be. Su Ping raised his chin. “I told you that I don’t want them. Can’t you understand my words? I always keep my words. You can give me an artifact that can destroy the world but I won’t take it. I swear!”

Joanna was speechless. What is wrong with him?

“I will take your word for it, then.” Joanna tried to sound him out.

Su Ping snorted. “Go ahead. I stand by my words!”

“Interesting.”

“All right. Go and find me people who are going to reach the legendary rank.” Su Ping changed the subject, wearing a serious expression.

Since Su Ping had shifted the subject away from her artifacts, Joanna would certainly not bring it up again for sure. She summoned her subordinates and told them what to do.

The news was quickly spread out!

First, the people in the city became aware of the news. The population in the city was over one hundred million, including some humans and other races that were not gods.

The news stirred up a sensation in the city. Those at the peak of the ninth rank got excited and worked even harder in their cultivation.

Soon, Joanna’s subordinates sent the news to other places outside the city.

Back to Joanna’s castle.

Su Ping sat there, waiting for good news to reach him. Of course, he didn’t waste time while he waited. He told Joanna to find him some pets of the thunder family to act as his training partners. He wanted to try his best to learn all the skills of the thunder family below the legendary rank.

Since that was a small favor, Joana readily agreed.

The ones that who went to train with Su Ping were at the True God Realm, equivalent to the legendary rank.

They had pets that were also at the legendary rank. Some of their secondary pets were at the peak of the ninth-rank.

Su Ping had to admit that his vision kept on expanding when he went there.

He had seen the gods fight. No wonder he would not fancy the battles at the Elite League. “Thunder Protection!” “Thunder Shadow Illusion!”

“Thunder Slash!”

Various skills were unleashed in front of Su Ping. He sat on the ground, watching carefully and studying all the skills. Whenever he learned one, he would tell the True Gods to let their pets change to another skill.

One after one.

Su Ping was mastering more and more skills of the thunder family.

It is too bad that the federal government regards Thunder Flash’ as one of the 10 secret skills below the legendary rank. That skill is actually of the legendary rank. For the time being, I won’t be able to learn that.

Su Ping told the True Gods to let their battle pets demonstrate Thunder Flash so that he could copy it. However, to his dismay, he realized that the skill was complicated. The action was seemingly simple but the working mechanism escaped his understanding.

“I can tell that the elementary rules of thunder can only allow me to learn skills below the legendary rank. If I can increase my understanding of the rules of thunder, maybe I will be able to learn the skills at the legendary rank,” Su Ping said to himself.

The elementary rules of thunder were simply pushing the door open for Su Ping.

Maybe he would be able to get the middle-level rules of thunder from the system sometime in the future, but he would have to be extremely lucky to do that.

Su Ping believed that he would rather count on his study than his luck. He would think about the rules of thunder and perhaps, he could reach the middle-level by himself.

Several days later.

“We’ve heard some answers.” Joanna came to the field outside her castle to find Su Ping. “I just heard that a god has sensed the calling of the Heaven’s Test. He will begin shortly.”

Su Ping stopped his learning. “Sensed the calling of the Heaven’s Test?” He sounded surprised.

“That’s right. When you are at the peak of the ninth rank and are qualified to move to the legendary rank, you will feel the calling of the Heaven’s Test. That is a feeling that is sought after by many at the peak of the ninth-rank. Once you get that feeling, it means that you will reach the legendary rank. The Heaven’s Test will come whenever you’re ready,” Joanna stated.

Su Ping had no idea about the details related to the legendary rank breakthrough. Joanna’s explanation had helped him understand.

“Has that man come to the city? Does he know he’s going to take the Heaven’s Test?” Su Ping asked.

Joanna smiled. “He’s on his way. But he has just felt the calling and needs some time before it begins, at least half a month. When he’s ready, he can initiate the process at any time. The timing can be controlled.”

“That is good. Half a month, right... A bit long but I can deal with that...” Su Ping did some time calculations. Half a month there would only be a day and a half in the real world.

He could return for the Heaven’s Test after the next day’s match.

“I will leave the matter to you, then,” Su Ping said.

“Don’t worry about it,” Joanna replied with a smile.

Soon, the one about to take the Heaven’s Test had arrived in the city.

Joanna set up a meeting between him and Su Ping. This god was middle-aged, strong, and the same as other gods, about four to five meters tall. The middle-aged god didn’t anticipate seeing a humble human being in that noble place.

Besides, the other gods seemed to be in awe of that human being.

The middle-aged god could see there were True Gods, Celestial Gods, and even God Warriors.

To be among them terrified the middle-aged god.

“Nice to meet you...” The middle-aged god greeted Su Ping nervously, not daring to belittle the human being.

Gods were born to hold contempt against humans but they did admit that there were powerful ones among them. Although the level of that human being’s power could not be ascertained, the fact that he was there in the company of other gods made it all the more strange! Su Ping was also baffled, wondering why the middle-aged god would appear to be so stressed out.

It was one who had sensed the calling of the Heaven’s Test and was about to become a legend.

On the Blue Planet, he would be more revered than Venerable the Blade. Once he reached the legendary rank officially, he could become an overlord of an entire continent.

But why would he be so obsequious?

Soon, Su Ping understood the reason. It was because of all the gods around him. In this city, Celestial Gods were everywhere and those at the legendary rank were all over the place. This middle-aged person who had not reached the legendary rank had to be one of the average gods in the Divinity.

“Do you know that I was thinking about using the power of your Heaven’s Test?” Su Ping asked.

The middle-aged answered at once. “Yes, I’m aware of that. Her highness has given me an artifact to help me pass the test. You can come all you want and you don’t have to mind me.” Eh... Su Ping was at a loss for words. “Well then, good luck to you.” That was the only response Su Ping could come up with. Out of habit, he wanted to pat that god on the shoulder but since the shoulder was too high, he resorted to giving a pat of encouragement on the god’s thick thigh.

The god smiled in embarrassment.

The other gods showed him out of the castle. Before he left, the middle-aged god turned around to have one more look at Su Ping, only to see that the human being had started discussing something about battles with the True Gods. “That human being...” A glint of troubled feelings rose in the middle-aged god’s eyes. He looked away and left.

Soon, the time had come for Su Ping to leave the Demigod Burial.

He had been here for 10 days.

The middle-aged god had yet to initiate the Heaven’s Test. Su Ping did some calculations. It should be morning time back at his place in the Blue Planet. He had to go back to have breakfast and send Su Lingyue to the venue.

Su Ping couldn’t stay there any longer. He had to leave.

One day outside was roughly ten days. Su Ping asked Joanna who said that based on the current situation, the middle-aged god would need two more weeks to be ready.

Su Ping would make it to Heaven’s Test by the evening of the next day or the morning after.

“Time to go,” Su Ping said to Joanna.

Joanna knew about that. She was ready.

The swirl appeared and pulled Su Ping and Joanna in.

Back at the store.

Su Ping looked at the time. His calculation was right.

Dawn had broken.

Su Ping got Tang Ruyan out from the scroll and told her to go freshen up.

When he opened the door, there were already over a dozen people waiting.

Su Ping had already gotten used to this. Also, he noticed that there were fewer customers compared to the day prior. It was probably because people were waiting for the upcoming match of the day.

The day’s match was going to be intense, especially since it would be the turn for the losing parties of the group match finals to challenge the current Top 10 winners.

Not all the losing parties would go through the challenge but few were unwilling to admit their defeat. The audience was looking forward to those challenges, eager to see if the Top 10 candidates would change.

Making it to the Top 10 was an honor but to be replaced would be a shame.

Su Ping thought of Xu Kuang. He had yet to show up. Su Ping told Tang Ruyan to go and receive the customers waiting outside first.

He soon began seeing to all the customers’ needs. Half of them had shown up to pick up their pets. Those who would go at this hour were usually repeated customers. Some picked up their pets and left right away without testing for the effects. They used this approach to express that they trusted Su Ping.

All the repeated customers were aware of the stunning effects. Their pets would either pick up a new skill or display an increase in combat strength.

They would be able to test the results when they went to a battle venue to challenge someone.

Su Ping didn’t invite the customers to stay. He had learned a new way: he would write the training results for each pet on a post-it.

He would write down the names of the new skills if the pet had learned any.

He would write down briefly what combat techniques the pets had picked up if the pets had an increased combat strength.

Customers could find out about the details in any battle stadium, so they didn’t have to waste their time waiting for their turns in the test room.

Su Ping could tell that some of the repeated customers would prefer not to stay in the test room to check for the effects. Therefore, this new way would make it easier for those repeated customers as well.

Soon, all of the customers left.

Su Ping stretched out and told Tang Ruyan to watch the store; he also told Joanna to watch Tang Ruyan while he went back home for breakfast.
