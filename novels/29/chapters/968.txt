Chapter 969: Accumulation

A spaceship suddenly descended and stopped above the street, blocking the sunlight.

“Who dared to bring a spaceship to the inland?” asked someone in astonishment.

The spaceship was opened and two people flew out. They were Su Ping and Yun Mu.

Su Ping wore an affectionate smile upon looking at the familiar street and the familiar girl.

“This is just an ordinary planet. Why are we here?” Yun Mu looked around in confusion.

“This is where I do business,” replied Su Ping with a smile.

“This is where you do business?” Yun Mu was stunned.

One of Lord Supreme’s disciples is a businessman?

A man as talented as Su Ping is short on money?

Su Ping didn’t elaborate. He stored the spaceship and flew towards the girl whose eyes were already drenched.

More and more people saw his face as he descended. The noisy street became weirdly quiet all of a sudden, but the silence didn’t last long. It was broken by an outburst of cheers and roars. The people who had seen Su Ping before were flushed due to excitement.

“It’s Boss Su!”

“He’s the strongest genius of the Silvy Galaxy!”

“Wrong. He’s the strongest genius of the Golden Star Zone. Boss Su fought on behalf of our galaxy and became the champion!”

“You’re so ignorant. Haven’t you heard that the overall champion of the Universe Geniuses’ Contest is Boss Su?”

“Damn, champion of the universe? Seriously?”

“I learned of this through a secret channel. It can’t be wrong!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

All the people waiting in line whispered excitedly.

Some were saying that Su Ping was the champion of the universe. Nobody was able to confirm the fact, but that was irrelevant; the fact that he was the best in Silvy and the Golden Star Zone was exciting enough.

“He is Su Ping? Is he the strongest genius of our star zone’s rounds from the Universe Geniuses’ Contest?”

“I heard that he’s been admitted by Lord Supreme as a disciple. Is it true?”

Everybody was discussing Su Ping while their eyes were focused on him.

Even though three years had passed and Su Ping might not be known on other planets, Rhea was definitely an exception!

Su Ping was running a store before participating in the contest!

The news that he was a store owner on that planet was spread out as he made his way to the store. It made all the locals feel proud.

The best in both the galaxy and their star zone had a store on their planet!

The people on other planets were probably disinterested when it came to such an honor, but all of Rhea’s inhabitants felt proud of him.

“What’s all the noise about?”

Across the street, in a pet assessment store—Cleo was awakened by the noise. She had been napping on a couch found on the second floor. She frowned and then went to the window. She soon saw the man as he slowly made his descent.

“It’s him?”

Cleo narrowed her eyes and almost forgot how to talk.

Su Ping then landed in front of his store.

“Sorry I’m late.”

He suddenly felt guilty as he looked at the girl; she was teary eyed, biting her lips.

Tang Ruyan gnashed her teeth as she said, “I thought you forgot the way back.”

“I’m the boss. Of course I have to come back,” Su Ping joked. He didn’t want their reunion to be that sad.

Tang Ruyan bit her lips again, ever so slightly. There had been countless things she wanted to say to him when he wasn’t around; she even blurted a lot of words that had been rolling in her head when she ate or slept. However, she didn’t know what to say when she finally saw him in the flesh.

“You’re back.”

Two women slowly walked out of the store.

One of them was Joanna. She had blond hair, a young girl’s body figure, and a cold, mature lady’s face. She looked calm at the moment, but her twitching eyes indicated that her heart wasn’t as tranquil as she let on.

Green Lady, however, was delighted. It had been three years since she last saw Su Ping. She would have thought that something could have happened to him if Su Ping hadn’t said goodbye to her earlier.

Joanna and Green Lady’s appearance left all the queuing people dumbfounded and wide-eyed.

The young man in white clothes who was still on his knees was similarly shocked. He never thought that he would get the chance to see two gorgeous and stunning women at the same time!

Su Ping nodded at them with a smile, then said with mixed feelings, “You’ve had it hard.”

It was obvious that business had been thriving while he was away. Joanna had been taking care of it all the time.

“It’s good to have you back,” said Joanna casually. She then glanced at Yun Mu who was next to Su Ping and returned to the store.

Green Lady also noticed Yun Mu and asked in surprise, “Who is she?”

Su Ping made the introduction. “She is Yun Mu. My master sent her to protect me.”

Yun Mu was also shocked as she observed Green Lady; she could easily tell that the latter was an Ascendant too, and they were evenly matched. However, she didn’t detect a human being’s aura from her, which meant that she was from a different species.

“It seems that your master has been taking good care of you,” said Green Lady with glittering eyes.

“Yes, he has.” Su Ping nodded, and invited Yun Mu to enter the store. After all, the store entrance wasn’t suitable for a proper conversation.

Once Su Ping entered the store, the young man in white mumbled while watching the former’s back, “I-Is he the best genius of the Golden Star Zone?”

Uncle Wei, who was by his side, trembled and said in a low voice, “Young master, let’s get out of here…”

Even though Su Ping had not even bothered to look at him when he arrived, he was somehow terrified.

The young lord snapped out of his shock and nodded.

In a jewelry store nearby—

A young man who was picking jewelry suddenly wore the item in his hand and left in a leisurely manner. He sent a message via his watch as he left. “He’s back.”

In a clothing store—a woman was trying on a dress. She suddenly took it off and left the store straight away.

Several people who had been waiting in line had quietly left the crowd.

It wasn’t a secret that Su Ping was running a store on that planet; there were a lot of traces anyway. Besides, he had arrived on that planet three years prior. All his genius peers knew him.

Only three years had passed since the Universe Geniuses’ Contest was held, but most people had already forgotten about it. After all, most of them were too busy with their own lives; they didn’t have time for things that were too far beyond their reach.

…

Inside the store—

Su Ping felt conflicted as he looked around; his store was absolutely the same as three years prior. There wasn’t a speck of dust or any sign of disrepair.

“You’ve worked hard in the last three years,” said Su Ping.

Joanna said casually, “It’s my responsibility as your employee.”

“Humph!” Tang Ruyan raised her head.

Green Lady was quiet however, as if she had something on her mind.

Yun Mu looked at the three women and found Su Ping’s conversation strange and absurd.?Did he ask an Ascendant State expert to run his business for him?

As for the other two women, while Tang Ruyan could easily be seen through, the last one felt somewhat familiar to her. If her eyes didn’t deceive her, there was a high chance she was the reincarnation of an Ascendant.

If that was the case, there were two Ascendants minding the store!

“…”

Yun Mu was lost for words.

As far as she knew, a business run by two Ascendants should at least be an interstellar corporation; its daily revenue would be enough to buy out a tier-5 planet!

“Let’s call it a day today. Close the door. We need to adjust the store a little bit,” said Su Ping.

Joanna nodded and then sent out the notice.

Many customers moaned and complained outside, but they weren’t too regretful. Rather, they were excited about Su Ping’s return. The best genius of their star zone had not forgotten his store; he made a special trip to supervise it. Once the news were spread, people would show up in droves just to see.

Many of them thought that the days of waiting had already been worth it after they saw Su Ping up close.

Once they closed the store, Su Ping said to the three women with a smile, “All of you achieved the Outstanding Employee recognition for your work in the past three years.”

Joanna glanced at him. “I’ve been one since a long time ago. When are you taking me there?”

She didn’t urge him earlier, because she had already waited for tens of thousands of years. However, Su Ping had been away for three years; she was worried that he might be gone again.

“I’m taking you there soon,” said Su Ping, “I also want to explore it.”

“I’ll be holding you to your promise,” said Joanna immediately with glittering eyes.

Su Ping smiled and replied, “I’ve owed you that for a long time.”

He looked at Green Lady and Tang Ruyan and said, “You’re also free to choose a place to visit. I’ll take you there.”

“Any place?” asked Green Lady right away.

Su Ping nodded.

“I want to visit the Realm of Deities then,” she quickly said. It was the world where she and the Twilight Deity King used to live; she wanted to see it again. Back then, the Twilight Deity King locked her in the palace and fought until he died; she didn’t know whether or not the world she knew still existed.

But even if it was broken and desolate, she wanted to see it for the last time.

“Okay.” Su Ping nodded.

Tang Ruyan looked at Su Ping and lowered her head. “I haven’t decided yet, but I want to become strong…”

Su Ping nodded. “I’ll make arrangements.”

After that, he looked at Yun Mu and said, “Senior Yun, sorry, but I need to enter secluded training in my store for a couple of days. Could you watch over from outside?”

Yun Mu was slightly surprised. She gave Su Ping and the three women weird looks. She had never heard about the Realm of Deities that Green Lady had just mentioned; she guessed it was a world from ancient myths. Still, Su Ping promised her that he would take her there. There was no way the promise could be delivered.

I didn’t know that Lord Supreme’s young disciple was such a trash guy,?Yun Mu thought.

Only a worthless piece of trash would have made a promise he could never deliver.

Furthermore, the man had to be disloyal and dishonest, since she fooled three women into working for him.

I didn’t know that even Ascendant women would fall for him. I need to be extra careful.?Yun Mu became vigilant, but she did accept Su Ping’s request.

She only needed to protect Su Ping for a hundred years, and she didn’t want anything else to happen between them.

Yun Mu left, and Su Ping no longer had to hold back. He didn’t want to tell Yun Mu too many things, because she would later leave after a hundred years passed. He said to Tang Ruyan, “You’ll come to the Archean Divinity with us. Even if you don’t find any treasures, you’ll still be strengthened by merely being there.”

“I can grow strong just by being there?” Tang Ruyan was stunned. “How?”

He merely said, “Just breathe.”

Tang Ruyan: “…”

Joanna glanced at Su Ping and said, “Don’t underestimate the difficulty. The war from years back shattered the Archean Divinity. Their environment is not as wonderful as you think, unless you’ve already been there.”

“Well, that’s true.” Su Ping remembered that his master mentioned that the Archean Divinity had been broken, and a battlefield during the contest was one of its pieces. He thought for a moment and asked, “Should I go there and explore it first?”

“You’ve never been there?” asked Joanna.

“No,” Su Ping shook his head and added, “But don’t worry. You can certainly go there.”

“Okay.” Joanna glanced at him, not saying anything else.

Green Lady stood in silence.

Once he finished talking to them, Su Ping went to check the revenues of his store, and found that the numbers were more shocking than expected.

The income had been accumulated for three years without any expenses incurred. It almost suffocated him.

Is this the fun of automation??Su Ping thought.

He had so much money that he could do anything he wanted. The ticket to the Archean Divinity was nine thousand points per visit, which used to be a high price for Su Ping in the past. But now, it was just like a dime to him. He wasn’t at all reluctant to spend it.
