Chapter 1425 Training (1)

Su Ping smiled bitterly. It was true, the dragon only helped because of the young Chaos Beast. He said helplessly, “Senior, I’m also a member of the chaos clan. Don’t you think it would be a shame if I die?”

“If you die, it’s your own fault. You pissed off an Ancestral God while not being strong enough. I wouldn’t have helped you if it weren’t for its sake,” said the Chaos Perception Dragon with a snort. “Besides, the Chaos Clan has many branches. You’re not from our branch; however, I feel that the little one’s bloodline is of the same origin as mine.”

“

!!

Su Ping was speechless. In any case, he had been saved. He said, “Senior, I’ll be eternally in your debt, and I’ll return the favor if there’s ever a chance. As for the little beast, however… I don’t think I can keep it here.”

“Huh?”

The Chaos Perception Dragon instantly narrowed its eyes, releasing an intimidating aura. “Do you think I’ll help you again if it’s still by your side?”

Su Ping shook his head. “Senior, you misunderstood. I’m simply not used to parting with it.”

“Funny reason.” The Chaos Perception Dragon was rather angry. “What can you do to ensure your safety? Hide here forever?”

Su Ping shook his head and replied, “I know what I’m doing. I’ll be safe.”

“You would have been killed if I hadn’t intervened!” said the Chaos Perception Dragon coldly.

Su Ping raised his head and looked at the latter. “Would you like to see if you can kill

me?”

“You think I don’t dare?”

The Chaos Perception Dragon was seething. At first it thought that Su Ping would accept that small request because of both the favor and its intimidation. Su Ping’s stubbornness was unexpected.

“I know that you dare. It’s just that I have my own trump card. I can’t tell you the details, but all in all, I’ll be fine,” said Su Ping.

The dragon gazed at him, remembering the terrifying existence hiding behind Su Ping’s back in their first encounter. Was that what the human is relying on?

After a moment of silence, it said, “Give it to me, and I will certainly teach it everything I know and give it the most suitable and rarest medicines; all to activate its bloodline sooner and reach my level. It will be a good thing for the both of you.”

The massive senior stopped acting tough, choosing a gentler persuasion.

Su Ping didn’t expect that such a ferocious beast would give in. He slightly shook his head and said, “I appreciate your kindness, but I’m the first person it saw after hatching. We’ve never separated since then. I don’t think it would get used to it… I know I wouldn’t.”

“What kind of reason is that?” The Chaos Perception Dragon was angry. Su Ping heaved a sigh and said, “It’s not an excuse. I hope you can forgive me.”

The Chaos Perception Dragon stared at Su Ping and imposed an extraordinary amount of pressure on him, only to discover that the young human didn’t change his expression at all, seemingly oblivious to death.

Such confidence made the beast be slightly convinced. How could this man be so calm without a trump card?

His calmness was already rare in the world.

“That’s just your opinion. Why don’t you ask the little one about what it thinks?” said the Chaos Perception Dragon. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Su Ping’s eyebrows rose a little, but he wasn’t in a rush to disapprove. He simply canceled the merger. He also wanted to find out what the young Chaos Beast was thinking. After all, it had to do with its future.

“I don’t need to think about it. I would rather stay with my master than go anywhere else. I don’t want to become the strongest. Besides, even if I stay with my master, I can also become the strongest!” said the young creature right after the fusion was dispelled. It then clung to Su Ping’s leg and glared at the Chaos Perception Dragon disdainfully.

Its words and attitude almost made the great dragon pass out due to anger.

It was the ultimate beast with the chaos bloodline born from nature itself. It was supposed to be above all living creatures, and yet it was forced to compromise.

“How useless!” the Chaos Perception Dragon roared.

The smaller Chaos Beast’s face was contorted, devoid of any fear. “You’re the useless one. I’ll surpass you sooner or later!”

Still furious, the Chaos Perception Dragon sneered. “And you’ll do that while following him? Keep dreaming! You’re just wasting your bloodline!”

“Don’t you have anyone you wish to follow?” asked the young Chaos Beast without flying into a fit of rage.

The former was stunned for a moment. The traces of countless years flashed in its eyes; mottled, almost forgotten memories crawled back.

Someone… to follow?

The beast remembered seeing a graceful woman standing in the world. Her fluttering clothes brushed it like a gentle hand.

At that time, it was but a drakeling the size of a bear.

The Chaos Perception Dragon fell silent. After a long time, it finally said, “That’s so stupid. If you follow me, I can make you grow strong at the fastest speed possible. Since you’re following him, don’t you want to protect him? How can you fight without strength?”

The young Chaos Beast was stunned. It looked at Su Ping and hesitated.

Su Ping chuckled and petted it. “I don’t need your protection. I can protect you.”

The young Chaos Beast enjoying the touch of Su Ping’s hand. It even narrowed its eyes in comfort. However, there was thoughtful light in the little one’s eyes while enjoying the petting “If you want to teach me, you can do so right now. Why would you need me to stay?” asked the young Chaos Beast in a hurry.

The senior beast said angrily, “You think cultivation is that simple? You’re already a God King. To go further you must find your Dao Heart and then cultivate the Undying Universe to become an Ancestral God. Both levels are extremely difficult to cross; how can you do that without giving it your full concentration?”
