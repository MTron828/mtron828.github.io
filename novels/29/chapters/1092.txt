Chapter 1093: Su Ping’s Action

“So, you were the champion of the last Universe Geniuses’ Contest; the Fate State warrior who condensed a small world… That’s quite rare.”

“Yes.”

“He’s already able to fend off Kepaf’s attack easily, even though he’s merely in the Star State. He can probably catch up with us in a thousand years.”

Everybody glanced at Su Ping with great interest.

Not all of them had been training in seclusion all year round; some of them had been active, and had recognized Su Ping.

The rest of Shen Huang’s disciples had been injured by the previous blast, while Su Ping and the members of the Loulan family he protected emerged unscathed. It was certainly unusual.

Loulan Lin and the others became nervous as they heard their discussion.

Shuai Qianhou, their stronger ally, was not present at the moment. There were a dozen enemies who were even stronger.

In particular, the red-robed young man and his companions seemed to be as strong as the brawny man Kepaf.

Everybody had fixed their eyes upon Su Ping; their sole hope at the moment was that Shen Huang’s ultimate treasure could rescue them from their plight.

That guy is truly shrewd…

Su Ping glanced at the void for a moment, then looked away.

He heaved a sigh. Shuai Qianhou was a terrible actor; the man could have finished off his opponents easily, but he preferred to get rid of the liabilities through them.

The liabilities were, naturally, Diaz and the rest of them.

Even if they were all Shen Huang’s disciples, they were only there to fill up the openings.

Shuai Qianhou had just joined them, and was determined to get the legacy; he didn’t care about their lives, at all. He probably would have killed them himself; he refrained from doing so out of respect for his master.

Su Ping looked at the red-robed young man and said helplessly, “I have a proposal.”

The red-robed young man raised his eyebrows. “I’m all ears.”

“There aren’t many people left here. We’re all elites; there’s no need for us to fight each other. We can all go to the central continent together… What do you think?” asked Su Ping.

Yu Jingze and the others were stunned. Then, they looked at their opponents nervously.

That was indeed a reasonable proposal.

Only thirty people in total remained.

There were only ten tokens, but the other twenty people could be transported in small worlds.

In fact, even if none of the candidates was eliminated, they could have been accommodated in one small world by someone who had a token. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After all, every small world was vast; even the small world of a normal Star Lord could easily accommodate hundreds of thousands of people.

They had been eliminating each other because they didn’t want to catch the attention of other candidates when they entered the central continent. Furthermore, if they split up by then, all would become competitors, so it was better to just eliminate them in advance.

It would be hilarious if any of the weaklings picked up the legacy due to luck.

“You think we should go together?”

The red-robed young man raised his eyebrows and chuckled. “Indeed, those who remain are elites, but some of you aren’t even capable of resisting the aftershock of Kepaf’s attack; you’re too weak for Shen Huang’s disciples…”

Yu Jingze, Diaz and the others wore contorted expressions after that statement.

They felt depressed and frustrated.

Indeed.

They were injured because of the law’s aftershock. They probably would have exploded like the rest of the victims if they were selected as targets.

They had been hoping to pass the first test with the items their master had given them.

Passing the second test with their willpower was possible willpower and their treasures.

As for the third test… Its content was still unknown, but it seemed to be the last test where one had to rely on oneself.

Unfortunately, the very first test of the trial had proved to be considerably difficult.

All of them were geniuses who could dominate dozens of galaxies in the outside world. And yet, they were simply vulnerable.

Diaz looked miserable. It was but until that moment when he finally realized how wide the gap between him and Su Ping was.

He was injured, while Su Ping was absolutely fine; the guy had even protected three representatives of the Loulan family.

“Junior Brother Su…” Yu Jingze looked at Su Ping, with an ever-changing expression. Su Ping was undoubtedly qualified to compete for the key in the central continent.

As for them…

They would probably hold Su Ping back if they chose to continue—

But they were unwilling to quit; not when the legacy awaited them!

They had to fight for it, even if the chances were slim!

“Junior Brother Su, can the ultimate treasure finish them off?” Elena asked Su Ping; she wore a troubled expression while gritting her teeth, unwilling to quit just yet.

Su Ping glanced at Elena and slightly shook his head.

The ultimate treasure was for the tougher guys. How could it be used that soon?

Elena’s face became grave after seeing his headshake.

She didn’t know whether or not the ultimate treasure could save them, but Su Ping’s gesture was a clear no.

Maybe his junior brother saw them as a liability too.

After all, they were also his competitors for the legacy!

Elena was gloomy. She didn’t really blame Su Ping, as his decision was understandable; it was her feeling out of sorts.

“Please, for my sake, or for my master’s sake, let’s postpone the discussion until Junior Brother Qianhou finishes the battle, shall we?” asked Su Ping again.

Hope surfaced in the eyes of Yu Jingze and the others. Their eyes were locked on their opponents.

“For your sake?”

The red-robed young man wore a weird expression; someone even chuckled.

“Sorry. Even Shen Huang is nothing compared to the true god’s legacy,” said the red-robed young man, without any room for ambiguity.

“I’ll give you a chance to reveal the intelligence related to the ultimate treasure. If you do that, I’ll allow you to join us; if not, all of you will be buried here forever.”

Su Ping frowned. “So, no negotiation?”

“On the count of three,” said the red-robed young man curtly.

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll take you down with me using the ultimate treasure?” asked Su Ping curiously.

The red-robed leader narrowed his eyes; the expressions of his companions became solemn.

In fact, they were clearly worried.

The ultimate treasure left by Shen Huang was unknown.

Most importantly, Su Ping was behaving all too casually.

How could he be that daring without a trump card?

“We’ll have to find out how powerful it is,” said the red-robed young man casually as he stared at Su Ping, “We have to get the ultimate treasure. We would be at a disadvantage against those who have one.”

His reasoning changed the minds of the people with second thoughts.

Indeed.

Some of them considered compromising and going to the central continent with Su Ping.

Still, just as their leader had said, they would be at a disadvantage on the central continent if they didn’t have the ultimate treasure!

The circumstances could be even more unfavorable!

Someone stood out and said coldly, “Surrender the treasure and your lives shall be spared; you don’t want to get yourself killed!”

Yu Jingze and the others, however, gathered around Su Ping; what the latter had said gave them some hope. Jiang Si whispered, “Junior Brother Su, just fight them with the ultimate treasure!”

“They won’t let us go. Let’s march out!” said Yu Jingze.

Diaz wore a troubled, yet silent expression.

While ignoring those two seniors who had spoken, Su Ping said to Wanyan Shuang, “Can you take care of those three friends for me?”

“Huh?”

Wanyan Shuang was stunned, not expecting Su Ping to interact with her.

She had a strange feeling when she saw Su Ping’s eyes, which were absolutely tranquil. The man wasn’t just confident; he was casual, as if nothing dangerous happened.

“I’ll try,” replied Wanyan Shuang, not making any promises.

She was still considering whether to stab them in the back and join the other side or not.

Su Ping nodded, and then patted Diaz’ shoulder. “Take care of yourself.”

Diaz felt surprised; he looked at Su Ping.

Then, he saw the latter step forward, towards the red-robed young man and his companions.

One step after the other.

Su Ping walked very casually; his every step was exactly of the same length.

“Huh?”

The red-robed young man and all the others became gloomy after seeing Su Ping’s advance. It had become clear that he was determined to fight them!

The young leader gave an instruction with a cold voice, “Finish him off!”

He didn’t attack in person, as Su Ping’s boldness suggested that he was very likely carrying the ultimate treasure.

The others thought of that too; none of them was willing to be the first to test how powerful the treasure was.

The red-robed leader frowned, then pointed at two men who had resisted Shuai Qianhou’s Void Flames earlier. “You two, finish him off; he’s barely in the Star State. What are you afraid of?”

The two of them instantly wore conflicting expressions.

He’s a mere Star State warrior? Then, why aren’t you not fighting for him?

His cultivation is low; and yet, he was too bold. So, he’s definitely carrying the ultimate treasure!

“I’ll kill you first if you don’t go,” The red-robed young man stared at him with intimidating eyes, as if he were going to fulfill his threat immediately.

The two companions wore extremely awful expressions; they had witnessed the young man’s combat ability, and knew they couldn’t possibly fight him.

They were caught in a dilemma. They gritted their teeth and charged at Su Ping in the end.

Boom!

They unleashed their strength; their pets emerged, riding behind their backs, quickly fusing with them, making them significantly stronger than before.

They looked at each other, then marched towards Su Ping from two directions.

They had each released the secret skills they knew, before they approached.

A strange lightning bolt darted forth. It was a mixture from the laws of lightning and chaos. It was the Chaotic Lightning!

That was an ancient technique seemingly forgotten for a long time, until it was used again.

On the other side—a dark crescent blade was sweeping enemies from the other place. Even though it wasn’t perfect, it was a combination of multiple laws, upon which the complex features and shocking damage were manifested.

Neither of them had grasped a perfect path, but they were so familiar with their laws that they were able to resist attacks derived from perfect paths!.
