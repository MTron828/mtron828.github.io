Chapter 1333 Celestial State Meeting (2)

“Did some people choose not to come?” asked Su Ping.

“Huh?”

Many people frowned because of Su Ping’s tone, as it was not his place to ask such a question.

“Chi Huo, what did you just call Shen Huang’s disciple? When did you get a brother?” said a hunched Celestial expert sitting in the chair as if he were a shadow cast over it.

Chi Huo glanced at him and said, “No need to be so indirect; I regard Brother Su as a peer. Brother Su is capable of slaying Celestials. Don’t look down on him just because he’s an Ascendant. The Saint King was defeated by him.”

Many expressions changed upon hearing that. Even though they had their own sources of intel, they were never certain. However, Chi Huo had just endorsed that piece of news.

Everybody looked at Kayafollet; the Saint King was her master. If Su Ping had killed the man, why would Kayafollet come with him?

“It’s true.” Kayafollet was grim. Although she hated to admit it, she knew she had to back Su Ping at the moment.

Her admission came as a shock to those present. They suspected that Su Ping had kidnapped her. Still, kidnapping her after getting the legacy was also an evidence of his strength.

“The Celestial from the Flying Cloud Star Zone died, and so did the one from the Doom Star Zone. The leader of the Grand Star Zone is heavily wounded, and their stance is neutral. It doesn’t matter even if they don’t show up. The rest are all here,” Shen Huang said to Su Ping.

Su Ping nodded and looked at everyone. “Now that everybody is here, I won’t be taking much of your time. Today, I have but one request: We must unite all the forces of the universe with the Golden Star Zone as the core. Everyone must obey!”

He said two “musts” in a row, not at all minding about being courteous.

The expressions of those present changed yet again. Many opened their eyes with sharpness. It was clear that Su Ping’s declaration didn’t sit well with them.

Shen Huang and the others were slightly dazed too. Even though that was their purpose, they didn’t expect Su Ping to take such a tough approach.

“Why?” said a purple-robed senior with a cold tone. He looked around aggressively and sat in the void like a majestic emperor.

Su Ping looked at him and said, “If you had said that while physically in front of me, you would have been crippled, if not killed!”

“Huh?”

There was another round of expressions changing after such a claim. The purple-robed senior said with coldness in his eyes, “Brat, you’re only an Ascendant. Even if you killed the Saint King, so what? Your master’s original body was killed. The Saint King must have paid an enormous price and you took the chance to sneak up on him. Do you really think all Celestials are made of

mud?”

“Just come to the Golden Star Zone if you don’t believe me. I’ll use only one hand to deal with you; you can do whatever you want if I can’t convince you with a single attack,” said Su Ping coldly.

The man who looked like a shadow on his chair spoke gloomily. “How arrogant!”

The others didn’t look friendly either. Although they didn’t talk, they were thinking along the same lines; Su Ping was too arrogant. Beating a Celestial expert with one attack? How can he say that?

“Shen Huang, your disciple seems to have a misunderstanding about the Celestial State,” said another old man slowly with rising anger. He was the leader of the Dragon Sun Star Zone.

Shen Huang frowned. Even though Su Ping was arrogant, he believed that the boy knew what he was doing. After all, Su Ping suppressed Ye Chen, Kayafollet, the Saint King and even killed Mo Ri. He was currently even more terrifying. “Guys, I suggest that you believe what my disciple said.”

Naturally, Shen Huang took Su Ping’s side. He said coldly, “Don’t forget that both Mo Ri and the Saint King were killed by him. Ye Chen is being imprisoned in his universe, and this Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin is his prisoner too. I don’t think any of you can beat my disciple in a duel!”

He spoke with absolute certainty. He was extremely confident in Su Ping.

Chi Huo added, “That’s right. Why not use your brains? Would I regard Brother Su as a peer if he weren’t capable of crushing normal Celestials?”

He had seen how Su Ping squeezed the Saint King and fed him to his pet. It was an unforgettable scene. He didn’t have the slightest doubt about the boy’s strength.

Xu Kong frowned a bit; she didn’t see Su Ping fight in the Mayhem Star Zone. She knew that the young fellow was strong, but Shen Huang and Chi Huo seemed to place nigh blind confidence in him.

“Hilarious!”

Some people were angry after hearing that, but some of the others were deep in thought. “Why not find a better actor if you want to bluff? Shen Huang, you could have pretended that your clone made a breakthrough and became as strong as your main body; that might have scared us. However, it’s hilarious to see you make your disciple do this!” said the shadow-like old man grimly.

“Feel free to believe what you will. I can guess what the Black Desolation Star Zone wants. However, the universe is faced with disaster, and you must help!” said Shen Huang coldly.

Everybody wore different expressions. Some looked at Kayafollet, who didn’t argue with Shen Huang despite the humiliation showing on her face.

Furthermore, since they had appeared at the same time, it might be truly possible that she was Shen Huang’s prisoner.

“There are people dying outside as we speak. I don’t want to waste time on a boring meeting with you,” Su Ping looked around at them and said, “If you disobey, you may come to the Celestial Court together. We’ll even leave the gate open for you. I will challenge all of you by myself, and I will make you obey!”

All the Celestials showed slightly different expressions. Is Su Ping declaring war against all the Celestials?

He’s a lunatic!

Does he really think he’s invincible?

Shen Huang and the others were shocked by Su Ping’s statement. You’d challenge them

all?

They didn’t know whether Su Ping meant it, or if it was just a strategy.

“Shen Huang, is that also your intention?” asked someone coldly.

The neutral Celestials didn’t look well either, as Su Ping showed contempt for them at the same time.

Shen Huang had to grit his teeth and speak. “That’s right. My disciple’s intention is also mine.”

Su Ping had already made that declaration; he couldn’t undermine him.

“We planned to remain neutral, but considering your attitude, don’t blame us for not being courteous,” said a female Celestial who had an alluring body figure.

Su Ping looked at her and said, “You’re talking about neutrality at a time like this? There’s a disaster affecting the entire universe. How can you stay neutral? You think we’re still fighting against the Heavenly Devil Alliance? All of you have lived more than 100,000 years, and yet your eyes are blind and your brains are muddled in front of this catastrophe. I would have cracked your heads to check what’s inside if you were in front of me!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You!” Someone burst into a rage and slapped the table.

“He’s too arrogant. Guys, let’s just grant his wish and suppress the Celestial Court together,” said the shadow-like old man, who was the leader of the Black Desolation Star Zone.

“Although his attitude is terrible, I think he has a point; we must take care of the worm tide first. Even the Primordial Empyrean Master died, and the people from the Planet of Origin fled too. We’re also disorganized; aren’t we gradually dying as it is?” said someone.

“If you want to go, just go. The Sword Skull Star Zone won’t be joining,” said another Celestial.

“Just look at his attitude. If we truly enter an alliance, wouldn’t he boss us around? He’s already this arrogant. Who would make the decisions if we do unite?” said the Celestial of the Red Shadow Star Zone with a sneer, clearly fanning the flames. They all knew that they would benefit from the alliance, but the allotment of interests was the main problem.

It was impossible for them to unite without solving that problem.
