Chapter 561 The New Family Head

“The remaining people cannot pose any threat to you. I will leave them to you.”

Tang Ruyan glanced over to the distance, where the battle pet warriors of the Situ family and the Wang family were gathered. Some of them were fighting against each other. Some of them were trying to run away. No one had any desire to attack the Tang family; it would only be a matter of time before all of them were routed.

Tang Linzhan asked in a hurry, “What about you...?”

“I will go and deal with the Situ family and Wang family. I’ll cut off the loose ends!”

“Now?”

Tang Linzhan tried to talk her out of it, “That’s too soon. I understand that you’re powerful but the two families still have a lot of remaining forces. They will be on guard against you on their home bases. We’ll take care of this mess here and then discuss it. I’ll send someone over with you, okay?”

“No. I don’t have time. I myself will suffice.”

“No time?”

Tang Linzhan was surprised. “What do you have to do?”

Tang Ruyan didn’t answer. “Miss, please listen to him. It is too dangerous for you!” “I agree. Please, let us talk about it. Those two families aren’t easy...” The elders were trying to stop her.

Before they could finish talking, they heard a loud noise and felt the ground shake.

A swirl appeared in front of Tang Ruyan and from it emerged a leg with fur as sharp as needles. The behemoth showed itself. It was a bloodthirsty, primitive beast with a pair of golden eyes. Tang Linzhan and the elders were struck dumb.

A beast king?

There was no doubt that it was a beast king!

Those men stood stiff on the ground. The beast king was even more terrifying than the two that attacked them in the beginning!

The terrifying aura of the beast king left them cold. They felt their lives could be drained at any minute.

Whoosh!

Tang Ruyan suddenly disappeared; a second later, they saw her on the beast king’s shoulder.

“I’ll be back soon,” Tang Ruyan declared as she looked down at Tang Linzhan and the elders from a height.

She saw Tang Ruyu from the corner of her eye.

She felt she caught a glimpse of a girl who had once been her small tail.

She caught a glimpse of a girl that would brush against her indifferently.

Time went by gradually. Time would change many things beyond all recognition. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She said nothing. Even with her outstanding powers, she could not change the past and she couldn’t dial back time. She could never go back to the time when that girl would always be awfully clingy when she was around. “Farewell...” she said to herself.

Was she bidding farewell to those people? Was she saying goodbye to her childhood? Tang Ruyan was the only one who knew.

Sister...

Tang Ruyu gazed at Tang Ruyan in a daze. The beast king stirred up a gust of wind, blowing Tang Ruyu’s hair back.

She would never forget what she was seeing right then.

All of a sudden, Tang Ruyu felt she had traveled back to her childhood.

She would always be with her big sister...

It was such a distant feeling that she had forgotten all about it. But she had just remembered it.

It was... a feeling of security.

Her big sister would always be there to protect her.

She remembered how her big sister would smile and how tender she was.

Tang Ruyu clenched her fingers with so much force that she didn’t even know her palms were bleeding.

“Let’s go,” Tang Ruyan looked away and told the beast king. Coldness had returned to her eyes. She pointed to a direction, the base city where the Wang family was located.

Bang!

That beast king bent its limbs and dashed away. The ground shook, alerting people in the distance.

With a leap, the beast king ran across the battlefield.

The countless battle pet warriors were startled by the massive shadow moving across the sky.

Whoosh!

A figure neared Tang Ruyan. It was the Little Skeleton.

Tang Ruyan was not surprised to see that the Little Skeleton would be able to catch up with her so soon. The coldness thawed on her face. “Thank you.”

The Little Skeleton looked at her. The empty eye sockets gave the Little Skeleton quite a cute feeling.

Tang Ruyan patted its skull and sat down. While the beast king carried her forward, she took the chance to let her astral powers be restored.

“What...?!

As the behemoth left, the Tang family elders were too stunned for words.

Tang Ruyan has a beast king?

She has a beast king as her own pet!

If it weren’t for the fact that they had watched her grow up, they would have never believed that the girl was Tang Ruyan!

As that beast king went away, somehow, Tang Linzhan felt as if a burden had been taken off his shoulders. He was a dejected man.

He had prided himself of never having made a mistake, ever since he became the family head.

The Tang family’s prosperity was a case in point.

But Tang Ruyan had proved him wrong.

Maybe the biggest mistake of his life was to underestimate his daughter.

He turned around and looked at Tang Ruyu.

Tang Ruyu happened to be gazing at Tang Linzhan as well. She smiled at him, but it was a forced smile.

Tang Linzhan said nothing to her. “Sir, we need to clean this up,” an elder reminded Tang Linzhan.

Tang Linzhan came back to his senses. He gave one final look to the girl who was disappearing into the twilight and nodded.

On the roof of a high building in the Tang family compound.

Some people were standing there. They lowered their telescopes.

The last thing they saw was when the beast king ran toward the base city where the Wang family was located.

All of them saw the same kind of astonishment in each other’s eyes.

They could not believe the outcome of that night’s fierce battle!

They had thought that the Tang family would fall. The Tang family had still lost its edge after trying all sorts of means. And yet, the change of events at the break of the day had gone beyond anyone’s imagination.

“Have you notified our family?”

“Yes.”

“Damn the Tang family! Look at that girl!”

“Is that really the future family head of the Tang family?”

“No. I heard otherwise from what I could pick up from part of their conversation.” “The Tang family sure is mysterious. That Tang Linzhan is the most despicable man in the world!”

“The Wang family is most likely doomed and so is the Situ family. Our Yugong family must be ready.”

“Yes, both of them are doomed. And here I thought we would be the biggest benefactor...”

“Let’s go now.”

Dejected and disappointed, they left at once.

After that fight, the Tang family would become famous.

Tang Ruyan in particular would be the focus of many forces.

Wufeng Base City.

Five peaks in the city had been in existence since the beginning of time and had been well-known in the world.

The Wang family was located in the Wufeng Base City.

That was a Class A base city with the devices and strengths to fend off beast kings.

A loud noise was rising outside the base city. Tang Ruyan was sitting on the beast king. They had arrived.

The gates were closed and weapons were readied on the city wall.

“They knew I was coming.” Tang Ruyan squinted her eyes. That family head couldn’t have arrived yet. She was riding on a beast king, so she had to be faster than him.

But he could call his family first.

“Are you from the Tang family?”

A titled battle pet warrior was speaking to her.

Tang Ruyan stood up. “I am Tang Ruyan. I’m here to wipe out the Wang family. I hope the government will stand aside. Don’t blame me if you get yourselves hurt!”

“Listen, better make friends than make enemies. We don’t want to be on your bad side. Please leave!”

“Hmm, you should have told that to the Wang family. Now, are you getting out of the way or not!” Tang Ruyan warned the man again.

The man didn’t say anything. The next second, all the weapons were fired. Laser beams were locked onto Tang Ruyan.

Tang Ruyan didn’t have time to react.

Bang!

The laser beams were dispelled. A figure was standing in front of her. It was the Little Skeleton.

A puff of smoke emerged from the skeleton but it remained unhurt. The Little Skeleton slowly raised its head, with two red dots in its eye sockets.

Bang!

The Little Skeleton was still standing in front of Tang Ruyan, but the weapons and cannons in the distance were either falling or being pushed away, leaving behind much dust over the city wall.

The Little Skeleton began to vanish in front of Tang Ruyan. It had been an afterimage all along
