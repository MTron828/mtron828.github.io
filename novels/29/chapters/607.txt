Chapter 609: Misfortune

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Murder!”

“I cannot believe that just happened.”

“I think they are titled battle pet warriors!”

The other people behind the counter freaked out. Some battle pet warriors passing by were attracted; they stopped to get a better look at the incident.

They were eager for such dramatic displays to spice up their boring lives.

“What is going on?”

A gray haired old man stepped into the building with a girl that looked like his secretary walking next to him. He took a glance at the crowd and noticed the strangers; then, he saw the middle-aged man lying over a pool of blood.

“Senior Feng!”

“Senior Feng is at the peak of the titled rank. This will be fun to watch!”

The onlookers removed their glee-filled grins and lowered their heads to show their respects.

Senior Feng was a cornerstone for the Han family, a well known character in the titled battle pet warrior community.

“Who are you? How dare you break into the Han’s Group!” The young and pretty girl took a step forward with a long face. Whoever committed murder there would have to pay the price. The man who had died was not just an advanced battle pet warrior, he was the face of the Han family.

That girl was an eighth-rank battle pet warrior.

“Miss Yuqian.”

“She graduated from the Valiant Academy, being ranked among the top three of her class from what I heard. She can even defeat the average titled battle pet warriors, not to mention other master battle pet warriors.”

“Talents don’t have to be reasonable, right? Those who could be considered trouble for us are nothing for her.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The onlookers expressed their admiration for the aloof girl.

“Titled battle pet warrior?”

Li Yuanfeng turned over to the gray-haired old man and directly ignored the girl who was expressing her anger at the moment. So, the old guy is at the peak of the titled rank. He should be a person in charge.

Whoosh!

Li Yuanfeng lifted his hand; the old man with gray hair suddenly appeared right in front of him.

That sudden movement dazzled the onlookers. They could not help but exclaim when they were able to see again.

That was fast! That’s what Senior Feng is capable of.

But Senior Feng was baffled.

What is going on?

He was just standing there. What was he doing so close to that person!?

Also, he felt something unspeakable was trapping him. He could not move and he could not mobilize his astral powers. All the astral powers were kept inside.

It was complete domination!

“You...”

Senior Feng was losing a little color on his face.

“Do you know about the Li family that used to be here?” Li Yuanfeng clasped his hands behind his back and glared at the old man coldly.

Li Yuanfeng looked like a young man but he was actually old enough to be that man’s great-grandfather; the old man was just a kid to him, both in age and in strength.

“The Li family...?”

Senior Feng thought of something. “Do you mean the Li family that once had a legendary battle pet warrior?”

“If there were no other legendary battle pet warrior surnamed Li, that would be the one. Where did they go?”

Senior Feng tried to secretly break free from the containment as they talked but to his surprise, he could not. He had never met anyone able to do that to him.

Is this some secret skill?

Or...

Even thinking that word made his heart skip a beat.

Legendary battle pet warrior?

Is this young man a legendary battle pet warrior?!

Senior Feng was scared by his own guess. “Who are you?”

“That’s not something you should know. Just answer my question,” Li Yuanfeng said. His patience was wearing thin; he began to feel that something must have happened to the Li family. They wouldn’t have given up their ancestral ground here... That was why he had hurt that middle-aged man. He was irritated.

Senior Feng turned even paler. “The Li family you mentioned was already gone five hundred years ago. I just only heard them from someone else. There were some legendary battle pet warriors in the base city, and one of them was a member of the Li family. Unfortunately, that legendary battle pet warrior died a long time ago. Misfortune befell the family and they disappeared.”

“Five hundred years ago?”

Li Yuanfeng could not believe that.

“What do you mean died? What is the name of that legendary battle pet warrior you mentioned?” Li Yuanfeng shouted his question.

Senior Feng felt the stress over him become greater, and that his bones were about to break. He wanted to unleash his astral powers but he could not; he was confined. His own astral powers were afraid of something and they just wouldn’t leave his body.

He stared at Li Yuanfeng. He pushed down that ominous thought flashing past his mind. “That legendary battle pet warrior was named Li Yuanfeng and he was known as the Sun Chaser!”

Li Yuanfeng was stunned still. So were Su Lingyue and Su Ping.

Su Ping thought faster. He guessed the overall situation, which made him angry.

Li Yuanfeng came back to his senses.

He had fought in the Deep Caves for eight hundred years. He didn’t do that because he was foolish. He did that because he wanted to!

He wasn’t any less sophisticated than the other legendary battle pet warriors; he didn’t have to think hard to understand what had happened back then.

“I stayed in the Deep Caves for eight hundred years. I was away for eight hundred years and now you say that I died...”

Li Yuanfeng wore a mocking grin but the coldness in his eyes was scary.

“Do you really think that those who stay in the Deep Caves are stupid?

“I was willing to go to the Deep Caves and the Tower promised to protect the Li family forever. Not even that promise was kept!”

He clenched his fist and the look in his eyes grew sharper.

The Li family disappeared five hundred years in the past; he had already been staying in the Deep Caves for three hundred years by then!

He had even stayed for another five hundred years after the Li family disappeared!

He was protecting humankind and he was protecting the Li family!

But there was no longer a Li family for him to protect.

After retiring, maybe he couldn’t have made that great a contribution to humankind, but at the very least he could protect the Li family for generations to come!

He and his partners were willing to guard the Deep Caves. Why the hell could the Tower not safeguard their families!

Li Yuanfeng was furious. He was beyond furious.

Senior Feng was dumbstruck by Li Yuanfeng’s words.

The Deep Caves?

Eight hundred years?

Senior Feng narrowed his eyes.

Only legendary battle pet warriors could guard the Deep Caves!

Is this young man that legendary battle pet warrior of the Li family?

“Sir, sir, you are?” Senior Feng asked. He was speaking with respect. He felt that it wouldn’t be a hard thing for the young man to kill him.

If the young man wasn’t using some secret skill, then he had to be at the legendary rank!

“I am Li Yuanfeng, the legendary battle pet warrior of the Li family whom you said was long gone!” Li Yuanfeng cast a cold glance at Senior Feng and the onlookers.
