Chapter 1492: Ancestral God Wen Tian (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Su Ping asked Emperor Xin and the others to head back to the old human territory for the time being. He then went to the depths of the Heaven Path Institute under the Chief Elder’s invitation.

It was a secret land exclusive for elders. Even Dao Children had to receive approval to enter. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Human Ancestor, here are the three Ancestral Gods of our institute,” said the Chief Elder as he pointed.

Facing the secret land, there were three majestic statues, more than ten thousand meters tall and in different postures. One was holding a sword with both hands, another was holding a spear, and the last one was half-lying on the ground.

Right above the three statues—a spring of divine power was flowing down like a waterfall.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and noticed that the springs were connected to a familiar aura in the depths of the void.

“Is that?”

The Chief Elder had mixed feelings in his heart as he said, “That’s the Divine Eye occupied by Ancestral God Qing Feng. It’s one of the foundations of this world, too.”

“A Divine Eye…”

It never occurred to him that the institute would have laid claim to a Divine Eye. No wonder the divine power was so abundant on the mountains used by disciples to cultivate.?So, they were actually supported by a Divine Eye.

“Since you’re willing to lend a hand to protect the institute, Human Ancestor, please leave your statue here,” said the Chief Elder to Su Ping in a respectful tone.

Su Ping noticed the immense Dao aura on the three statues, probably left by the Ancestral Gods themselves. So, he simply waved a hand and created a red statue surrounded by many smaller-sized heads. Those who knew him well would recognize the heads of the Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon and his other pets.

A white skeleton was created in his hand.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered and he slowly clenched his fist.

He had already become an Ancestral God. Once the store was upgraded to level 9, he find out how to resurrect his skeleton pet.

Su Ping would do anything to make it happen, even if he had to rise to the sky or dash into hell!

“They are…” The Chief Elder looked confused as he saw the beast heads around Su Ping’s statue.

Su Ping smiled and said, “They’re all my partners.”

“Partners…”

The Chief Elder was dazed for a moment, but didn’t ask further. After all, Su Ping could very well do whatever he wanted after becoming an Ancestral God. Ancestral God Wen Tian, the third ancestor, had simply built a statue of him lying down, claiming it was too tiresome for his statue to be standing all the time. It was hard to imagine an Ancestral God ever feeling tired, not after only taking a hundred thousand years to reach their level.

“Human Ancestor, are you going to the Mysterious Realm of the Ancestral Gods?” the Chief Elder asked Su Ping, “Ancestral God Wen Tian is sleeping there. He’ll definitely be very happy to greet you.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping nodded. He was a new Ancestral God, and there were still a lot of things he needed to learn.

“Human Ancestor, please follow me.”

The Chief Elder waved a hand and opened a vortex. The Mysterious Realm of the Ancestral Gods was in front of Wen Tian’s statue. The statue shined, projecting a vortex which led to an unknown land.

Su Ping entered the Mysterious Realm with a normal expression.

Light and shadow changed. Once everything was stabilized, Su Ping found himself in a vast blue world, devoid of all vegetation. There was no soil, either; he was standing on the surface of an absolutely peaceful sea.

Su Ping looked around but no one but himself was there.

It was only him and his reflection below his feet.

“Senior Wen Tian.”

Su Ping sensed the exuberant aura of an Ancestral God present. That Mysterious Realm seemed to be the second spatial layer inside Wen Tian’s undying universe.

“Huh?”

A ripple appeared in the void, and then a tall young man in white clothes walked out. He looked identical to the lying statue outside. He looked at Su Ping in surprise and asked, “Who are you?”

Su Ping briefly introduced himself, “Su Ping. I just became an Ancestral God. I was a Dao Child in the institute.”

“Dao Child…”

The young man in white gave him a slight nod.?The guy must’ve entered with the Chief Elder’s help. Only elders from the institute have the privilege. He would have sensed any break in. He had already guessed something when he saw Su Ping, but simply didn’t expect that a new Ancestral God would rise so soon in the institute.

“How many days has it been? It’s been only several dozen thousand years or so.” The young man in white did the math but still had mixed feelings. “Is the world of gods going to enter a glorious age? For an Ancestral God to appear so soon, and in our institute, no less. Which clan are you from? You carry the aura of chaos. There are only a hundred clans that carry this bloodline.”

“I’m a human being,” said Su Ping.

“A human being?”

The young man in white was stunned. He thought for a moment and asked in confusion, “I don’t think that’s a clan, is it?”

“It’s a middle-ranked clan.” Su Ping felt somewhat helpless. It was clear that Ancestral Gods would only pay attention to high-ranked clans.

“Well…”

The young man in white was obviously stunned. He sized Su Ping up in astonishment. “An Ancestral God from a middle-ranked clan? In other words, you’ve turned your clan into a high-ranked clan, all on your own? Impressive!”

Su Ping said helplessly, “Senior Wen Tian, I made my breakthrough just recently. I’m here to ask for more information about Ancestral Gods.”

“All right, just as I thought.”

Wen Tian chuckled and waved a hand. Two comfortable chairs appeared in the void. He claimed one and said, “There must be a lot of things you’re curious about now that you advanced. There are also rules among Ancestral Gods that I must make you aware of. Although we are at the top in this world, it doesn’t mean that we can be completely lawless.”
