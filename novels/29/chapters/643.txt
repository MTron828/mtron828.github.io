Chapter 645 Reinforcement

“Do they need us to go there? But, we have to stay here. After all, entrance No. 7 is here. And Brother Su just told us that...”

The old legendary battle pet warrior was hesitating

The caller wanted them to go over and help because they needed more people. Still, the three of them had yet to recover from the sensational news Su Ping had just shared with them.

“I remember that Brother Guo is at the Holy Light Base City. He should be able to manage if the beast kings are below the Void State,” the young legendary battle pet warrior said.

“Legendary battle pet warriors are usually enough to deal with super-large strikes. But things are different...” Yun Wanli was worried. “The wild beasts from the Deep Caves are hiding in unknown places. We may need to rethink the beast strikes’ categories.”

The other two turned pale, but neither disagreed.

That was true.

In the past, two beast kings were able enough to deal a super large strike, or “Level S”!

But with the many beast kings that had escaped, their numbers were unprecedented. If the beast kings were organized, it wouldn’t be surprising that dozens of beast kings would coordinate and strike a base city. That attack would go far beyond what they knew as “super-large”!

“Either way, I think we should go and check it out,” Yun Wanli said, “The Holy Light Base City is not far away from ours. We of course would have declined right away if the base city was too far away. It would only take us an hour to make a round trip. I’m thinking that we should send reinforcements.”

“But what if something happens during that time...?!

“We can make it back if that were the case.” Yun Wanli was determined. “Longyang can survive an hour without us in a strike. If the base city cannot even do that, no matter how many of us stay, it would be pointless.”

“I think, just to be safe, we should send someone over to gather more info. If things are bad, I’ll personally go there to help,” the old legendary battle pet warrior proposed.

Yun Wanli nodded. “That’ll do.” “Stay here. I will go there,” Su Ping jumped in, “You said that it wasn’t far from here. Also, it just so happens that I know someone there. I’ll take care of the reinforcing.”

“You?”

The three gazed at him. Yun Wanli was delighted by the proposal. “Brother Su, thank you so much for helping up. You’re better than the three of us combined. I won’t have to worry while you’re there.”

Yun Wanli had deepened his understanding of Su Ping when he accompanied him to the Deep Caves, also based on what the legendary battle pet warrior in the golden armor had disclosed.

Su Ping was a person who was able to kill Void State Warriors with a single punch while in the Tower!

It was hardly believable, but Yun Wanli still believed that Su Ping’s combat strength should be close to the peak of the Void State, or even the Fate State!

Su Ping had entered the Dragon Tower... As far as Yun Wanli could tell, the young man was a rare talent, even compared to all the other talents in the Federation!

“We can also set our minds at ease, Brother Su,” said the old legendary battle pet warrior.

He still doubted Yun Wanli’s words, but the fact that Su Ping had indeed entered the Corridor had left a deep impression in the old warrior.

“Don’t mention it. See you.”

Su Ping waved his hand. He didn’t waste any more time.

Time was pressing and he wasn’t one for small talk. After all, he didn’t like interacting with those legendary battle pet warriors from the Tower, to begin with.

He took his leave without delay.

Su Ping summoned his Inferno Dragon and stood on one of its shoulders. The Inferno Dragon flapped its wings; the scorching airwave swept across the sky, then the dragon turned and soared in the sky.

Yun Wanli wore a smile as he watched Su Ping leave. The Holy Light Base City still had hope.

If Su Ping wasn’t enough to save the Holy Light Base City, that might be a sign of true disaster!

After all, a common super-large strike was nothing for a freak like Su Ping.

“That person didn’t join the Tower, but I don’t think he’s a bad guy.” The old legendary battle pet warrior narrowed his eyes. He was able to tell right from wrong. From the stories he had heard in the Tower, he knew that Su Ping challenged authority, was prone to violence and merciless. However, since he had finally met him in person...

He felt Su Ping was only a bit arrogant, and he openly disliked them; but, he wasn’t a vile person.

“Hmm, you cannot say that. Maybe he’s just trying to save his friends,” the young legendary battle pet warrior countered.

Yun Wanli frowned and cast a cold glance at the young legendary battle pet warrior.

That was a time when cooperation was sorely needed. He would hate to see internal conflicts rise.

The Inferno Dragon was fast. No one showed up to stop it when it dashed out from the base city’s wall.

Soon enough, Su Ping was able to see the outline of the Holy Light Base City.

The wild beasts...

He saw many groups of beasts in the wilderness as he got closer. The beasts were of various species, but they were all moving in the same direction.

Many of the ninth-rank beasts stood out because of their sheer size.

Besides, Su Ping saw several beasts that were hundreds of meters tall. The aerial view was shocking.

One, two, three, four...

Six beast kings!

Su Ping was worried. He had already seen six beast kings in the crowd. The other wild beasts were afraid to stand too close to them.

All of them are at the Ocean State, which is good news.

Su Ping summoned the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound at once; he then told them to go ahead and fight the wild beasts.

“Bark!”

The Dark Dragon Hound could not wait to let out its energy. The hound jumped right into the herd of beasts from the sky, alerting them. The pet’s terrifying presence made the wild beasts run away. Soon, the beast kings noticed the unfamiliar presence. They stopped, turned around, and bellowed at the Dark Dragon Hound.

Roar!

While afraid, the wild beasts’ violent nature was inspired by the beast kings’ roars. The wild beasts turned around and charged at the Dark Dragon Hound.

Bzzing~!

The Dark Dragon Hound covered itself with defensive layers, making itself as strong as iron. Then it walked around in the cluster of wild beasts, while the latter bumped into the defensive layers one after the other. The Dark Dragon Hound found amusement in watching those wild beast kings getting hurt.

The Dark Dragon Hound was playing around while the Little Skeleton was working hard. It took out its bone blade and soon approached a beast king

The Little Skeleton was unstoppable. It wielded its bone blade and a ray of black sword light cut open the armor that the beast king had just raised, leaving a wound so deep that the bones could be seen. As a matter of fact, the Little Skeleton had almost halved the beast king!

After struggling to survive in the Deep Caves, the Little Skeleton’s swordplay had improved considerably.

Roar!

The Inferno Dragon flew over. Its wings were casting a large shadow over the group of beasts. Su Ping rolled his eyes when he saw how the dog was playing around.

The Dark Dragon Hound raised its head and stole a glance at Su Ping. Although unhappy, it no longer had the courage to fool around. It began to unleash many ninth-rank skills. The ground was shaking and thunder clapped. The hound created a vacuum in the midst of those beasts.

In the meantime, on the city walls of the Holy Light Base City.

The entire base city was under a state of emergency!

A warrior was reporting to a titled battle pet warrior, “Report. The wild beasts are three hundred kilometers away from the base city, approaching at a speed of 60 km/h.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The titled battle pet warrior wore armor with the insignia of the Holy Light Base City’s army. He worked for the government.

“So, at this rate, they will arrive in five hours. I think this isn’t surprising for such a large crowd of beasts. They will start to charge once they get a bit closer. So, we have less than four hours to get ready...” the titled battle pet warrior murmured to himself.

With that said, he turned around. Standing next to him was a middle-aged man who looked slim, with dark hair combed in a bun. His attire made him look like a man from the past.

He carried a long spear on his back wrapped in cloth, merely revealing the head of the spear.

“Legend Riverside, what can we do?” the titled battle pet warrior asked with respect.

The middle-aged warrior gazed into the distance. He could see some battle pet warriors and their battle pets working hard there.

“Have you prepared the mines and the missiles?” the middle-aged man asked.

“Yes.”

“Have you collected enough information? How many beast kings have you found?”.

“Well, we don’t have the details yet but I think the report will arrive shortly.” “Good. How about logistics? Tell them not to be so tense. The battle will last a few days. Don’t allow them to stress out.” “Okay.”

The titled battle pet warrior went away. He urged the intelligence unit to collect information in time so that they could make due preparations.

If it weren’t for Legend Riverside, the Holy Light Base City would have been in a complete mess right then.

They were able to continue their work in an orderly fashion thanks to him. That was the sense of security that Legend Riverside had given them.

“Have you lent the battle pets that have been kept in the Trainers Association?” Legend Riverside asked.

The titled battle pet warrior answered at once, “Yes, we have. We’re in a state of emergency. The Association contacted us three hours ago.”

“Good.” Legend Riverside nodded but said nothing else.

Holy Light Base City. Trainers Association.

“Go to the shelter!” a middle-aged man said to two girls in the distance as he walked past a lawn.

“No. We have to help distribute the pets.”

“She’s right. We can’t participate in the battle but the Holy Light Base City is under attack. We are part of this base city. We don’t want to be cowards,” the two girls said.

Standing in front of them were many battle pet warriors wearing government armor.

They were queuing to pick up battle pets from the Trainers Association. According to their experience and military ranks, each of them could get a different battle

pet.

The Trainers Association had categorized the battle pets into Levels S, A, B, C, and D according to their combat strengths and aptitudes. Level S represented the rarest battle pets. They were strong and well-trained.

“Nonsense. Anyone else can help with the registration. Go to the shelter!” the middle-aged man shouted at the two girls. None of the battle pet warriors dared to interfere when they saw that the middle-aged man was a master trainer.

“Dad, we’re serious!” one of the girls said.

“There’s a legendary battle pet warrior in the base city, right? We can safeguard it while he’s here.” The seemingly less-stubborn girl was also determined at this time.

“You don’t even know what you’re talking about. What if the wild beasts happen to breach the wall and invade the base city? You’re just as vulnerable as the general public. Go!” The middle-aged was both anxious and afraid. Compared to the two girls, he was the one who wasn’t calm enough. “Old Shi.”

A man arrived from a distance.

The middle-aged man turned to meet an old man with thick hair.

“The Chairman has called us for a meeting. What are you doing here? Come with me. We’re talking about a grave matter; we cannot afford to be careless,” the elderly man urged his junior.

The middle-aged frowned. Of course, he knew that.

He shouted at the two girls again, “I don’t have time to argue with you. Leave.” “I won’t...”

Before she could finish, the other girl stopped her and nodded. “Of course, sure, we’ll leave right now.”

“You-hmph!

The middle-aged man could see through the second girl right away. “Old Shi.”

The old man was getting impatient.

The middle-aged man bit his teeth. “I won’t be lenient if I see you two here when I get out!”

“Sure.”

After the middle-aged man left, the two girls breathed in relief and went back to work. “I wonder if we can succeed this time.” One of the girls looked worried.

“Don’t worry. We have a legendary battle pet warrior here. We will succeed.” The other girl was more optimistic.

“Right, and you can count on us as well.”

“We will try our best and fight till the last second!”

The warriors added.

The rest nodded in agreement.

The two girls smiled at those battle pet warriors who had shown their resolve.

In a tent on the outer wall.

The Holy Light Base City was one of the top-level base cities and the walls were wide enough to have fighter planes land there. There were even missiles lined up on the wall and cars could drive around freely.

In one of the tents

Several people were standing there, including Legend Riverside.

Standing next to him was an old man in silver armor; he was the commander in chief of the Holy Light Base City.

The mayor was busy with other work. When a battle was about to break out, the place that was the least stable of all the base city’s interior. After all, the population, rich or poor, were afraid of death; once fear took over, a mess would ensue.
