Chapter 1168: Reinforcements

Emperor Ye couldn’t have looked more awful as he watched his clone be executed.

He knew that his clone couldn’t be any more dead.

The battle had ended with him being on the losing end.

“Emperor Ye has lost.”

“How is it possible…”

“It can’t be true. Am I hallucinating?”

The Rain Clan gods were confused, as the result was too surprising; Su Ping was the one who survived in the end. He fought an emperor’s clone while being a Celestial God himself, and won…

“Emperor Ye lost…”

The clan’s experts sighed, overwhelmed by conflicting feelings. They knew that Emperor Ye had lost when he chose to kill Su Ping by blowing up his small worlds.

After all, it was just a clone; it wouldn’t matter even if the clone died, let alone the explosion of his small worlds.

He couldn’t have done that if he would have been fighting for real. Besides, his enemy could still run away. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If Su Ping were determined to run away, considering how capable he was, the emperor’s clone wouldn’t have caught him in two hours.

The clan’s gods were silent after seeing the final result of the battle. They all seemed to have been hammered; some were even hoping to see Emperor Ye’s clone walk out of the void again.

But this time, the clone was truly dead.

The mysterious forest in the void had also vanished after the clone was executed.

“What happened today will be remembered by all gods even a million years from now…” The feather-crowned senior and the others snapped out of their daze, now feeling excited. Who would have thought that a high-ranked god would be defeated by a young Celestial God?

One person overpowered an entire clan?

Even the emperor had been defeated by Su Ping when they were on the same level. Who else in the Rain Clan could fight him?

“Get ready,” said the feather-crowned human to his colleagues while trying to hold back his excitement.

He gazed at the gloomy Rain Emperor. “The Rain Clan is a high-ranked and trustworthy clan. You wouldn’t go back on your word, would you?”

The latter looked at Su Ping thoughtfully, then glanced at the human leader. “Don’t worry. We won’t go back on our word.”

The feather-crowned man was greatly relieved.

The Rain Emperor said indifferently, “Let’s call it a day. Goodbye.”

“Thank you,” the feather-crowned human quickly replied.

Emperor Ye wore a troubled expression; his failure in battle made him realize that the human brat was even stronger than him when he was young!

He had been incapable of such feats back then, and was too inexperienced. He would have been long defeated by Su Ping had they met in the past.

Unfortunately, the result is all that matters!

Emperor Ye refocused his attention; coldness flashed in his eyes as he said to the crowned middle-aged man, “You’ve all come from afar; we will see you out. Let’s go!”

He waved his sleeve once he said that, and the entire sky changed. Su Ping, the crowned senior and the million humans were dragged into a dark space.

The feather-crowned human changed his expression and asked, “Emperor Ye, what are you doing?”

“Seeing you off, of course!” Emperor Ye sneered and said, “My clan is not a place for barbarians such as you to trespass. None of the human scumbags are getting away today!”

“How shameless!”

The feather-crowned human was infuriated, not expecting him to break the pact that easily. Furthermore, they had been separated from the other gods of the Rain Clan; their juniors would imply that Emperor Ye had indeed taken them away.

“You’re acting shamelessly, and yet you don’t want your fellow clansmen to see. What a hypocrite!” shouted a human expert.

“Just keep yelling. You’re going to die anyway; go ahead and talk while you still can,” said Emperor Ye with a sneer. Golden light was radiated by his whole body, the intimidating emperor aura filling up the void. Some amongst the million humans instantly started to scream; there were even those who wet themselves in fear. Others screamed as if they had seen something horrible.

“Shelter them!” quickly said the feather-crowned man.

A human expert instantly took action and released his world, absorbing the million humans. The feather-crowned senior then flashed toward Su Ping and said, “Come with me.”

Su Ping was infuriated too, not expecting the guy to truly go back on his word, or that he would try to shamelessly kill everyone in secret.

There wouldn’t be any evidence, even if someone were to find out later—

All the filth and dirt would be buried in the darkness.

“Just run away if you can. Don’t bother me,” was Su Ping’s quick response to the nearby feather-crowned human.

He knew it was pointless for him to stay alone. Resistance? Distraction? All of it would be pointless. Emperor Ye could kill him with a glance without the feather-crowned human protecting him. He couldn’t turn into a distraction.

Even though he could resurrect an infinite amount of times, it would only be a waste of energy.

“You are mankind’s hope; we will get you out of here even if the rest of us must die,” said the crowned senior. Meanwhile, he unleashed his strength and fought to tear the void apart along with everybody else, as they tried to break free.

Another person showed up at that moment. He was one of the Rain Clan’s experts wearing a golden armor; he was apparently also an emperor. He also gave support in blocking all the humans.

“The Rain Emperor is here too?” roared the feather-crowned human with widened eyes.

“The Rain Emperor doesn’t need to kill losers like you in person,” said the golden-armored expert with indifference.

“Just go! We’ll cover the rear!” a human expert said.

He ignited his constitution right after to charge at the golden-armored expert like a furnace.

The golden-armored expert laughed in disdain, apparently still passive; still, the human expert came to a sudden halt and then exploded. A hazy, chaotic void appeared in the explosion, destroying his body completely, making it impossible for him to resurrect.

“None of you is leaving today,” Emperor Ye said with a hideous grin.

“Is that so?” said someone all of a sudden, “Isn’t the Rain Clan embarrassing all high-ranked clans by doing this? You should acknowledge your failures if you lose. You were actually defeated by a young human. How can you still shout left and right?”

A white-robed young man with golden hair revealed himself. He was holding a sword and carrying a saber on his back.

“Emperor Wushuang of the Dragon Tamers!”

Once he saw him, Emperor Ye narrowed his eyes and turned cold. “Are the Dragon Tamers going to join this mess too?”

“That’s an interesting way of putting it.”

The white-robed young man smiled casually and continued, “You’re giving the Dragon Tamers’ vassals a hard time; isn’t it natural for me to support them? Besides, this mess was caused by the Rain Clan. Are you really such sore losers?”

“Enough with the crap!”

Emperor Ye wore an awful expression because of the mockery. He roared, “I’ve long heard that your saber and sword are invincible; let me see how powerful they are.”

“I don’t mind giving you a lesson,” replied the white-robed young man casually.

Emperor Ye was momentarily lost for words. He then said angrily, “Your tongue is just as sharp as those of the inferior humans. You must have taught those little bastards, they have no respect!”

“Only the strong deserve respect. You just lost to a young man; why should they respect you?” The white-robed young man chuckled.

Emperor Ye blushed, knowing he would only be humiliated further if they kept on talking, as the newcomer would not hesitate to slight him. He roared, “Take the rest of them. He’s mine!”

That was said to his fellow clansman, the golden-armored expert. Once he did, he ruthlessly charged at the white-robed young man.

The latter smiled casually, suddenly looking at Su Ping who was next to the feather-crowned human. “Young man, your sword technique wasn’t bad. It seems that you haven’t fully cultivated it yet, but it’s already shocking enough. Watch my demonstration carefully; how much you learn will be completely up to you.”

“You’re asking to be killed!”

Emperor Ye was enraged.?Is the guy trying to use me as a teaching tool?

How utterly disrespectful!

“Heavenly Sound!”

The white-robed young man suddenly slashed, instantly illuminating the enclosed, dark world. Everybody felt that their eyes had just been cut, eyeballs stinging.

That was an indescribable sword aura, which moved in an instant and seemed able to linger eternally.

The sound of someone crying began to spread out in the void.

“The Heavenly Sound Sword. More like the Heavenly Crying Sword.” The middle-aged crowned human heaved a sigh after witnessing the attack; that sword technique had once slain the heavens!

The void was torn apart, and both the white-robed young man and Emperor Ye vanished from Su Ping’s view. The energy spread due to their attacks shattered the void and pushed them into deeper, more stable spaces.

Even though they were gone, Su Ping could still see the attack that the young man had just performed.

“What a powerful and proud sword aura!” Su Ping mumbled to himself.

Just then, the feather-crowned human reduced Su Ping’s size and placed him in one of his ears. While protecting Su Ping with his energy, he charged at the golden-armored god along with other human experts.

The crowned senior was the only emperor among them; all the rest had a Celestial State cultivation. They were actually top experts in their level.

Nevertheless, the gap between them and an emperor was too wide.

“The Rain Clan is just as furtive as they used to be,” said a cute and pleasant voice all of a sudden; it came from the void while the feather-crowned senior was going all out. The sound of it was so charming that anyone who heard it would feel as if their bones were softening.

A woman wearing a purple-gold robe emerged from the void along with a plain looking middle-aged man who had a numbed expression, as if he were made of stone.

“The Divine Wind Clan!”

The golden-armored expert changed his expression in shock and fury. “What are you doing here? Humankind is not your vassal race!”

“So what? Can’t I like them?” The woman chuckled. Her face was so breathtaking no one who laid eyes on her could look away. She seemed to be no older than thirty, pretty and mature, but she was also a famous emperor!

The golden-armored expert wore an awful expression. They had had their encounters with the Rain Clan in the past, so their visit could only spell trouble!

“Come here.” The woman waved at the feather-crowned senior.

“Thank you for your help,” the crowned human quickly offered thanks as he approached her. He knew of the grievances between the Rain Clan and the Divine Wind Clan; they had probably made the trip to help all because of Su Ping.

Even though Su Ping was only a Celestial God, they had good reasons to help him.

The young man had shown great potential, and the Divine Wind Clan wanted to rescue him because he was at loggerheads with the Rain Clan; helping their enemy’s enemy was actually helping themselves.

“Young man, I’ll get you out of here safely. Don’t worry.” said the woman in a cute voice as she winked at the currently miniaturized Su Ping, who was sitting on the feather-crowned man’s ear.

Su Ping was rather flattered, not expecting an emperor to act that politely toward him. He quickly said, “Thank you for your help, senior.”

“Do I look that old to you? ‘Senior’ sounds awful. I’m your sister, and my name is Mo Yanlan. Remember that,” said the woman jokingly.

Su Ping recited the name and nodded. “I will.”

Mo Yanlan smiled and looked at the golden-armored expert. “Do you want to continue? However, it’s impossible for you to keep them here. If we fight, I’ll just tear his space apart and let all the races see what kind of people form the Rain Clan.”

The golden-armored expert stopped coldly, knowing she was right. He could hardly kill Su Ping now without causing alarm, since the Divine Wind Clan was there.

Although the Rain Clan had an Ancestral God, he was always asleep. He would be absent minded for ten thousand years every time he woke up, and wouldn’t pay attention to such trivia.

Besides, the Divine Wind Clan was a high-ranked clan that had an Ancestral God too.

Exactly at that moment, the Rain Emperor revealed himself in the void. “Say no more. This man cannot live another day; he has to die!”

He had noticed the situation and made his way over.

Three more people showed up next to him, also emperors!

Mo Yanlan’s expression changed somewhat upon seeing their arrival; she didn’t expect the Rain Clan to be wary of Su Ping to a point that they no longer bothered about shame. She narrowed her eyes. “Rain Emperor, aren’t you afraid of being the laughingstock of the world?”

“Everyone in the world is mocked, whether strong or weak,” said the Rain Emperor indifferently, “The only difference is that the weak are taunted right before their very faces, unlike what happens with the strong!”

Mo Yanlan showed an awful expression. Once she saw their determination, she immediately said to the feather-crowned human, “Go; we’ll hold them back. Return to the Dragon Tamers’ territory as soon as possible.”

Only dazed for a moment, the crowned human said solemnly, “Humankind is eternally in your debt!”

Mo Yanlan waved her hand in silence.

Without further ado, the feather-crowned senior quickly led his group to another direction.

“Where do you think you’re going?” The golden-armored expert dashed towards them.

Mo Yanlan quickly took action, flashing a streak of purple light which drove away the darkness in the void. They were back in the outside world; however, they were no longer on the Rain Clan’s mountain. It was in the middle of nowhere.

Still, they were on the continent where the Rain Clan was based.
