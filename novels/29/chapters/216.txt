Chapter 219 Pursuit

“Where did you hear that?”

It came as a surprise to the girl that Su Ping would know this. She gazed at him fixedly. All of a sudden, she felt she couldn’t read this human being. As for the ancient secret of the name “Demigod Burial,” not even some of the advanced members of the god race knew about it. That secret of critical importance was related to the origin of this Divinity; it involved the most supreme gods. For all this time, this name had been viewed as classified information.

Naturally, it was shocking that a low human being like Su Ping could utter those words.

She wondered if Su Ping had obtained a few isolated words and phrases from some ancient heritage sites. Maybe Su Ping had gone there to take advantage of this information and blackmail her.

Su Ping noticed that something was off in the way she was looking at him. He realized that the information he received from the system with such ease could be regarded as desperately serious by the indigenous residents.

He didn’t dive deep into this topic and tried to steer the conversation toward another direction. “I heard it from someone else. Well, if it’s OK with you, could you please give me an introduction to this place and send me away? If not, I can leave by myself...”

The girl fixed her eyes on Su Ping. “You heard it from someone? What is your agenda? Don’t make me throw you into the Sin Prison. Even gods would have to beg for mercy and wail there. You won’t be able to get out even if you want to!”

Su Ping was interested in this. “Is that like prison cells or something? Can people train there?”

The girl was startled to see the glow of interest in Su Ping’s eyes. She wasn’t sure if she should feel glad or vexed.

Even gods and some extremely violent and wicked beasts would shudder to hear the words “Sin Prison.” That was the most horrific place for the god race, where the criminals would receive the most tragic torture!

Some gods would rather die than stepping into the Sin Prison. They would turn pale as soon as they heard the name.

However, threats were of no use to this human being.

She could tell from Su Ping’s eyes that he had asked a question from his heart and he wasn’t faking his interest. This human was honestly unaware of the Sin Prisons’ atrocities!

Or, was he looking forward to such a terrifying place? The girl was grinding her teeth in fury. But she had enough sense to calm herself down. Even though she had failed to threaten Su Ping, she did collect a piece of useful information from Su Ping’s reaction. That was, Su Ping was most likely telling the truth.

Only people who had teleported to that place from other worlds would be unaware about the Sin Prison and its horrors.

Also, this “other world” had to be far, far away.

The girl reviewed Su Ping’s behavior. This human being had appeared at this place and that fact was odd and unbelievable. He could bring that degrading dragon slave back to life and that was something even the most supreme gods would find difficult to replicate.

She could bring herself to believe that there was a supreme god supporting this human being.

Why would a supreme being care about a puny human being?

A noble princess would not cast a second glance at the less fancy clothes, let alone picking up a rotten fruit pit from the ground.

That being said, if there was no supreme being in the picture, the girl was unable to find another explanation for the dragon coming back to life on the spot.

Su Ping, as a human being, surely didn’t master the skill to revive the dead all by himself.

The girl was struggling inside. She wanted to capture Su Ping immediately and interrogate him about his secrets. At the same time, she was worried about the mysterious being hidden behind this human. She even wondered if some rebellious forces were trying to achieve something and interfere with the current situation of the Divinity by using Su Ping.

Her eyebrows tightened even more as she thought of the current situation in the Divinity.

Su Ping became a bit scared since the girl had gone silent and had been blinking. He could not tell what she was thinking about. She was part of the god race after all and could execute him at any time.

“Never mind. I don’t think I can find any answers. I think I should kill myself and get away,” Su Ping said to himself.

He then took another look at the girl. Her mind was drifting away. Taking advantage of this moment, he mobilized his astral powers and shouted.

The girl was alerted by his voice. She came back to her senses, only to see Su Ping smiling at her, waving as if saying goodbye and then spat out blood...

What?

Then, Su Ping collapsed to the ground.

He turned colder and life slipped away from him.

The girl was stupefied.

What was that...?

Did he kill himself?!

The girl couldn’t understand what was going on. She had been through many possible scenarios and the only thing she had never imagined was that the human would have sacrificed his life before she did anything to capture him.

A moment later, the girl sensed that the life energy was completely gone from Su Ping, and she made sure that the human being was not faking his death. She placed her hand on Su Ping’s dead body to feel it.

His internal organs had ruptured, including his heart.

It was suicide.

How cruel Su Ping was to himself...

The girl kept silent for a long time. She was confused.

What is the meaning of this human coming here?

Was he a man of sacrifice?

But he had said nothing and neither had he obtained information from her before he killed himself. How unprofessional for a sacrificial pawn...

While she was still trying to figure this out, she felt something was moving under her hand. The next moment, she felt something was disturbing her heart. It was because of the tremor in space and time. When she lowered her head, to her astonishment, she found that Su Ping’s dead body had been transformed into flakes of starlight, later vanishing into the void.

While the dead body disappeared, the ever constant space and time fluctuated a bit.

A moment later, everything quieted down in the garden.

There was no corpse. Not even a trace of blood remained.

Only the deep pit on the ground told her that the battle had indeed happened.

The girl gazed into the pit and slowly gathered her thoughts. Everything that happened was like a dream. If it weren’t for that pit, she would have thought she was hallucinating “The turbulence in space and time, the dragon, the sudden suicide...” the girl mumbled.

She reviewed all the pieces in her mind. All of a sudden, she found a string that could piece all those clues together. She had an epiphany. She understood why he killed himself.

“He is alive. He just left here via suicide!

“He can come back to life!!”

The girl turned around all of a sudden and gazed into the horizon. Under the sky, the city was vast and unbounded. A large population resided there.

“His revival spot is not far away from here! I must catch up with him. He knows the origin of the Divinity and there’s the mysterious being helping him... I must get to the bottom of this. I must find out his real purpose for coming here!”

The girl bit her teeth. She vanished from her garden and then dashed toward a certain direction.
