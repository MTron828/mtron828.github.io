Chapter 840: Beating a Star Lord

“A Star Lord?”

Su Ping slightly narrowed his eyes when he saw the young man. His experience from the cultivation sites and his visit to the divine residence with the Alliance of Stars was enough to easily tell that the young man was not a Star State warrior! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Su Ping didn’t expect that the ancient tree on the Blue Planet would attract a Star Lord.

Every Star Lord was a dominator of an entire planetary system!

However, the Blue Planet’s former system had no other planets with life; being a lord of such a region wouldn’t not count as remarkable. However, other systems in the Federation would have planets with thriving life.

Even the planets unsuitable for survival could be modified and made inhabitable within the scope of the Federation.

To put it simply, a Star Lord commanded many Star State warriors. They were very powerful!

“Are you the Lord of the Blue Planet?”

The young man in weird clothes turned around and looked at Su Ping. Then he suddenly narrowed his eyes. “Void State? Your concealing technique is remarkable; even I can’t see through you.”

“Sorry, but I really am in the Void State,” said Su Ping gloomily.

The young man chuckled and said, “You’re still pretending in front of me? You must be the reason why those Star State people fled just now, right?”

“They blatantly invaded my planet. They deserved it,” said Su Ping, holding his temper.

He could kill those in the Star State with ease, but the gap between him and a Star Lord was still too vast!

Any Star Lord could easily kill peak Star State experts!

“The strong preying on the weak is a universal law. They couldn’t beat you, yet they came to invade; they deserved what happened to them,” said the young man with a casual smile, “I think you’re a talent. You’re as good as some of the best Star State warriors I know. Are you interested in working for me?”

Su Ping’s eyes flashed. He asked, “What will you do if I refuse?”

The young man smiled and said, “A proud man, just as I expected. If you refuse... It’s simple. I’ll destroy what I can’t have. This divine tree is strange and I want to have it. You would definitely hold a grudge against me if I spare your life. You may bring trouble to me when you become a Star Lord.”

He spoke casually and sounded quite reasonable.

Su Ping, however, fell silent.

He knew that the guy was right. He had only two options: to surrender, or die.

Su Ping looked up at the sky, wondering if Green Lady on Rhea could unleash her power from the store and defeat that young man.

The young man looked at the place where Su Ping was looking and remarked as casually as before, “That planet doesn’t belong here, yet it flew all the way here. I feel like it’s covered by a mysterious power. Do you know why?”

Su Ping didn’t say anything. He made an attempt to communicate with Green Lady via telepathy.

Exactly at that moment—a vortex appeared between the Blue Planet’s atmosphere and Rhea’s, and a triangle-shaped spaceship flew out.

The spaceship hovered between the two planets and then changed its course, breaking into the Blue Planet’s atmosphere and flying straight toward the divine tree.

“Huh?”

Both Su Ping and the young man noticed the unexpected spaceship. Su Ping’s expression changed slightly. Is that another force coming? But he was soon stunned by what he saw, since he was able to make out the spaceship’s insignia.

It was the emblem of the Alliance of Stars!

Whoosh!

The spaceship circumvented the enormous crown, then flew to the place where Su Ping and the young man were before coming to a halt.

The door of the spaceship was opened, and a lot of Star State men flew out!

Once they left the vessel and respectfully positioned themselves in two lines, two people floated out of the spaceship. They were none other than the leader girl and her deputy.

Su Ping had seen it coming when he recognized the spaceship, but he wasn’t fully relaxed until he saw all the familiar faces. That childish woman was able to survive, so he still had a chance to get the Tree of Laws!

“What a huge tree!” remarked the girl who had just floated out of the spaceship and looked up. She turned around and then saw Su Ping and the young man next to him.

“Who might you be?”

She didn’t look happy, as Su Ping had ragged, bloodstained clothes. She was thinking that the Star Lord was the one to blame!

The young man dropped his casual smile when he saw the girl and the deputy. He frowned upon hearing her unfriendly voice, then asked, “Who are you?”

Silvy was a large galaxy with plenty of solar systems. There were hundreds of Star Lords, not counting those from other galaxies who made the trip for fun or adventures. It would be normal for them not to be acquainted.

“Humph. I am Xingyue Shen’er from the Alliance of Stars!” declared the girl proudly.

It was the first time for Su Ping and most of the Alliance of Stars’ members to hear the girl’s real name. Su Ping was quite surprised to find that the girl’s name was just as vain as herself.

“The Alliance of Stars?” The young man frowned as he searched his memories. Then he changed his expression and snorted, “Aren’t you from Zeruprun? What are you planning to do here?”

“What are we planning to do, you ask?”

Xingyue Shen’er chuckled and said, “You hurt someone from my alliance, yet you ask me what I intend to do? Let me see... Are you trying to rob this strange tree from one of my men? I’ll give you three seconds to get the hell out of here before I rain hell on you!”

The members of the Alliance of Stars were speechless.

They had been observing the situation and could already guess what had happened. But they didn’t expect their leader to be that arrogant, straight off asking a Star Lord to get lost!

That man was a dominator!

Su Ping raised his eyebrows too after hearing what the girl said, but he was slightly relieved; in any case, the girl was on his side.

“What did you say?”

The young man became grim and cold. “Do you think I can be bullied because I’m outnumbered?”

“I don’t need to deal with you. Two!” said Xingyue Shen’er indifferently, as she reported the countdown.

The deputy leader next to him had already unleashed his profound power. He had previously acted like a statue or a puppet, but he quickly became the center of attention; his aura was already inflicting tremendous pressure on the alliance members.

Tides were also rising in the sea below them, as if attracted to his aura.

The scene was suffocating to most people on the two planets.

Su Ping had just gone on a rampage and defeated a bunch of Star State experts, but then several men who were even more horrifying had appeared!

The man’s aura had already changed the weather and raised tides in the sea. His power was unimaginable!

The young man grimly unleashed a powerful aura too, which twisted the space around him. A special power was spreading out of his body, which was the power of faith. A tiny bit of it was enough to crush mountains and pierce through planets!

The faces of the alliance members changed and quickly chose to retreat. They were no different from ants when Star Lords fought, and they would be killed indiscriminately!

“One!”

The girl slowly raised her tiny finger.

The next moment—the deputy suddenly burst out with eyes widened furiously. A horrifying shadow thousands of meters tall appeared next to his back. The shadow seemed to be in another space; it quickly disappeared into the deputy’s body, making him grow into a hairy, muscular giant.

Bang!

He dashed out like a rumbling train. The sea underneath him was split up when he moved forward, with a massive tide rising!

The young man also took action and a horrifying shadow also surfaced behind him. He merged with it and fought the deputy.

The two of them collided at the edge of the tree crown. Then, both of them disappeared.

Su Ping and the members of the alliance realized that the two men had entered a deeper space!

They didn’t even need to tear the space open; they were able to enter the deeper spaces with nothing but a thought.

Nobody dared to watch the battle; Xingyue Shen’er was the only one qualified to do so.

However, she seemed to be quite confident of the outcome; she casually stood there and waited.

All the people on both planets were stunned, not knowing what was going on.

Time ticked slowly. Given his attainments in the law of space, Su Ping could vaguely sense how dark waves were rising and ebbing in the void, as if a horrifying being were on a rampage!

Half a minute passed.

Those thirty seconds felt like three months.

All of a sudden—

There was a boom, then the void fell apart ten thousand meters away; a man who had scales all over his body was flung out. He was exactly the young Star Lord.

He flew back with what seemed to be a thick ape’s foot on his chest. Then he fell straight into the sea.

Bang!

The surface of the sea exploded; waves were raised within a radius spanning thousands of meters. A hole seemed to have appeared at the bottom of the sea after the explosion; seawater was flowing back into it.

Following that, the deputy leader and the young man fought their way out of a deeper space in another place. This time, the young man had lost one of his arms, and the deputy leader was chasing after him with a glittering axe in his hand.

The young man roared furiously and escaped into the void again.

“You should have known better!”

Xingyue Shen’er chuckled right after, as if she would have seen it coming.

Star Lords weren’t of equal strength.

She happened to be one of the stronger Star Lords!

Therefore, she had easily noticed that the young man was much weaker than her butler!

The alliance members were deeply shocked, not expecting their taciturn deputy leader to be so horrifying, able to crush a Star Lord!

No wonder the leader was confident when she asked the man to get lost.

So... a Star Lord could be much, much stronger than another peer!

Soon after, an explosive sound came from the edge of the atmosphere and faded before anyone could notice the origin. Two minutes later, a man stepped out of the void next to Xingyue Shen’er—he was exactly the deputy leader who had just fought.

He currently resembled a mix between an ape and a bear; he was holding the axe in one hand and a severed arm in the other. He said while the fur on his body began to retract, “He escaped.”

“Okay. All Star Lords are good at escaping.” Xingyue Shen’er nodded. She didn’t attack partly because of her pride, and partly because she knew she couldn’t stop the guy from running away even if she did attack.

A Star Lord could be much stronger than any of the same level, but it was impossible to prevent the weaker one from fleeing, unless there was an unimaginable difference in power!

Su Ping felt relieved after hearing their conversation. “Thank you for rescuing me, leader.”

“I should be the one saying that.” Xingyue Shen’er looked at Su Ping. The arrogance on her face was gone, and she said with a sweet smile, “We would have been annihilated if you hadn’t warned me.”

“Great.”

Su Ping smiled and thought, I only warned you because I didn’t want to lose the Tree of Laws.

“Thank you for your warning, Brother Heaven Destroyer!”

“We all owe you our lives, Brother Heaven Destroyer. You’ve done us a great favor!”

“Just come to me if you need anything, Brother Heaven Destroyer!”

All the members of the Alliance of Stars took turns in offering thanks in a warm and courteous manner.

Su Ping had already won their respect with his combat abilities. Besides, their leader had told them that they couldn’t have survived without Su Ping’s timely warning, indirectly saving them all.

“How did you track me down?” asked Su Ping curiously.

“Cough!” O’Neil was in the crowd; he coughed and then said awkwardly, “Our leader wanted to thank you in person after we escaped from the divine residence, so she asked me to lead the way. But then I found that my planet was gone when we got there...”

He wore an extremely weird expression as he talked.

All the others were doing their best to hold back their laughter, as it was also the first time they had heard of a similar incident!

“I instantly contacted the Laiyefa family and finally learned that my planet was somehow pushed away, so we tracked it down. Fortunately, our leader has a great spacecraft, which allowed us to arrive in time.” O’Neil scratched his head, feeling like a clown.

Su Ping coughed and then changed the topic. “Well, what happened when you left the divine residence?”

The mention of the divine residence made all those present show solemn and grave faces as they looked at each other.
