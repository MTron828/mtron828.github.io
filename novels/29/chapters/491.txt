Su Ping’s words pulled Senior Yan back to reality. He darted a look at the private room. North King was standing there, nodding to him.

North King had given his permission. They weren’t going to hold Su Ping accountable?

Though surprised, Senior Yan did approach Su Ping. Senior Yan was full of mixed feelings as he stared at the young man that had stunned all. At first he had thought that Su Ping was just a kid being mischievous. Still, at this point, Su Ping had proven himself. A Fate Challenger!

It had been such a long time since they had a Fate Challenger.

Not even some of the other famous titled battle pet warriors, such as Venerable the Blade, had earned that honor.

It was several hundred years in the past when the world welcomed its last Fate Challenger!

Back then, that Fate Challenger had been the most prominent titled battle pet warrior. Soon after, he reached the legendary rank. However, he died an unfortunate death when he was serving at the Deep Caves. That had been a sad day for humankind.

I am announcing the winner of this year’s Supremacy League. That is you, Fate Challenger Su!”

Senior Yan was very respectful when he talked to Su Ping. He also looked around as he announced the results; the titled battle pet warriors didn’t seem very pleased with that result but no one opposed it.

No one dared to confront the Fate Challenger.

There was no objection. Senior Yan said to Su Ping, “Fate Challenger Su, I am sorry about before. Please forgive me! “You are the champion. The Free Trade Organization will present you with the prizes,

beast king and the legendary skill book are still being delivered and it will be a couple of days before they can arrive. Please understand, sir, that we usually don’t proclaim the champion on the first day. So...” Senior Yan looked at Su Ping gingerly. The way he spoke to Su Ping was completely different from before.

For always, Fate Challengers were more perspicuous than the other titled battle pet warriors. The former was viewed as a group

warriors but stood out from those at the titled rank!

Even some legendary battle pet warriors would treat Fate Challengers with respect. After all, once Fate Challengers grew to be legendary battle pet warriors themselves, they would be the most formidable.

“It’s okay,” Su Ping answered. For starters, he wasn’t that interested in the beast king and the

Stone now. You can have the other two items delivered to my residence. I don’t have time to come back here again.” Senior Yan was glad that Su Ping didn’t have a problem with that. All of a sudden, Senior Yan realized this heartless Fate Challenger Su was not a difficult person to interact with as they were having a normal conversation. “Yes, of course. We will give you the Talent Stone right away. Please have a seat and wait for a moment,” Senior Yan said with a smile.

Su Ping nodded. He remembered that North King told him to go and find him. He had to go given the fact that the North King was a legendary battle pet warrior. Su Ping kept his Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon, then he flew over.

The titled battle pet warriors gazed as Su Ping left for North King’s private room.

Inside the private room.

Whoosh!

The North King shook his head and heaved a sigh when Su Ping came in. After Su Ping landed, the North King cast a seal so that no one could see or hear them.

“Fate Challenger Su, do you know why the prizes are different this year?” The North King heaved another sigh. Su Ping raised his eyebrows. From the previous conversation and the appearance of that legendary battle pet warrior from the Qin family, Su Ping had already thought up a

legendary battle pet warriors in hiding, right?” The North King produced a forced smile. “Do you know why we are doing that?” “Is it about the Deep Caves?”

“Indeed!”

The North King sighed again. “Recently, the beasts in the Deep Caves are getting agitated. Some legendary battle pet warriors serving there have passed away. We are in dire need of more people on board. I placed a bait and finally we lured one out, yet he ended up being killed by you. I am really pissed right now!” Su Ping didn’t seem to be bothered. But the North King was being a bit narrow-minded, to be still obsessed about that. “Since you have already lost several legendary battle pet warriors at the Deep Caves, what is one less to the tally? Besides, that one wasn’t so strong, to begin with. He wouldn’t be of much use to you,” Su Ping pointed out. The North King smiled a bitter smile. “Indeed, that old man of the Qin family was not outstanding among legendary battle pet warriors and he merely had one beast king. But that was because he had been trying to hide himself, not daring to come out and search for beast kings. He couldn’t communicate with other legendary battle pet warriors, either. He just worked behind closed doors.

legendary battle pet warrior, we would have given him more beast kings and provided him with some skill books for free after he joined the Tower. Soon, he would have been even better than he was today, at least progress by two times. By then, he would have contributed to the Deep Caves.” “Oh.”

North King: “...What do you mean by Oh?” “Oh’ means I heard you,” Su Ping said, “But what does it have to do with me? Whether he could serve at the Deep Caves and the fact that

things. So you’re saying I should have forgiven him just because he could guard the Deep Caves? I’ve already told you that I’ll kill twice as many beasts as he could have when I become a legendary battle pet warrior so I can compensate for your loss!” The North King’s face turned ashen. “I fully understand that you have such abilities. I can even say that you’re just as good as an average legendary battle pet warrior already, and you are qualified to serve at the Deep Caves given your strength. We would have recruited you already if it weren’t for the rules. But rules are rules. You’re a promising young man but you

“Also, I suspect there are more hidden legendary battle pet warriors here. “However, because of you, the old man from the Qin family simply could not sit still. You

other legendary battle pet warriors must have lost their courage to come out. My trip here

a wild goose chase. Do you have any idea what kind of emergency we are in right now? You are sabotaging our mission!” Su Ping didn’t comment on it because he didn’t think he had done anything wrong. “Your plan is your plan. I didn’t know anything about it. It’s not like I was doing anything on purpose. The Supremacy League was established to pick out the champion below the legendary rank. For one thing, my rank is not over the limit, and for another, my fight was not against any rules. I killed a legendary battle pet warrior, sure, but his participation was against the rules. My fight with him shouldn’t be counted as part of the Supremacy League.” “No matter how you look at it, you cannot accuse me of any wrongdoing. The only fault you can find with me is the bad coincidence. I might have worked with you if you had told me

hometown is currently under attack by a beast wave. If you’re willing to have the Tower dispatch a legendary battle pet warrior to help us out, I’m willing to sit here quietly and go through the entire process of the competition,” Su Ping added.

The North King was so furious he had been rendered speechless.

He was aware that his luck wasn’t in on that day. He couldn’t have anticipated the appearance of someone like Su Ping.

Theoretically speaking, a titled battle pet warrior like Su Ping should have become famous worldwide and yet he had never heard of such a man. That had been the first time he had heard of the name and met the person.

“The Tower doesn’t have many legendary battle pet warriors. We don’t have a spare hand to support your hometown.” The North King shook his head. “Guarding the Deep Caves is the most important thing or else all of human society will be doomed together.” Su Ping pulled a long face. “I’m not a great man and I don’t care about human society.

will go back and save my hometown. Since the people in my hometown cannot count on any legendary battle pet warriors, I will protect them!”

The North King gazed at Su Ping for a moment. Eventually, he shook his head. “You’re still at the titled rank, so I don’t want to reveal too many things to you. Good luck. You will have to shoulder the responsibility of protecting the entire human society when you reach the legendary rank one day. I won’t waste any more of your time now that your hometown is

the average beast kings. I won’t alert the Tower for that.”

Su Ping sneered with disdain. “I don’t know if there is anything that I’ll have to do. For me, what I must do is protect my close ones and take care of my parents. I am grateful to them. That is what I must, have to, and will do! As for anything else... there’s nothing else I’m obliged to do!”

The North King eyed Su Ping coldly, but eventually gave up. He waved his hand, opened the seal, and told Su Ping to go. Su Ping was the wrong audience. They could not understand each other; talking to him was a pure waste of time.

Also, he was aware that few people would be concerned about the fate of the whole world. Take that old man of the Qin family as an example. He had already reached the legendary battle pet warrior rank; he could have joined the Tower where he would have better treatment, and he would join a team where people could support each other. He could have progressed. Still, just because he was afraid of serving at the Deep Caves, he chose to prolong his sorry life!

He had felt better off staying as a vulnerable, insignificant legendary battle pet warrior! As far as the North King could tell, Su Ping was just like that.

However, he couldn’t have forced Su Ping to do anything since he had not reached the legendary rank yet.

It was true that Su Ping was no weaker than a legendary battle pet warrior, but the fact remained that he was not one. It would be against the rules if he were to shoulder responsibilities meant for legendary battle pet warriors.

Otherwise, even the titled battle pet warriors would hide their strengths in the future.

It was a silly move to destroy future potential

Besides, they had not reached a point where people under the legendary rank should go and help guard the Deep Caves. Of course, at that

end.

“He’s too young after all.”

North King frowned. But that was the only comment he could come up with. He knew what it felt like when one had to take care of both parents and relatives.

Albeit that feeling had become so faint he had almost forgotten about it. His parents had passed away. In this world, he no longer had a “family.” For the old legendary battle pet warriors, mankind was their only family!

Back to the stage.

Senior Yan darted a glance at the private room, only to see that the North King was frowning, which was a scary sight for him. He didn’t know what the conversation entailed but it had clearly not been a pleasant one.

The titled battle pet warriors gazed at Su Ping curiously, wondering what he had talked about

“Fate Challenger Su, this is the Talent Stone.”

Senior Yan went over and handed a black wooden box to Su Ping.

Su Ping opened it. There was a greyish rock inside, as big as an infant’s fist with a faint hue surrounding it.

Talent Stone.

Su Ping closed the box. He told himself that Senior Yan wouldn’t have tricked him at this point. After all, the Talent Stone was a prize for every year. He could ask any past champion and he would know if the one he got was real.

“Okay.”

Since he finally had the Talent Stone, he could not postpone his return any longer. What Qin Shuhai had said filled him with anxiety.

“Come over here!”

Crocodile through the Slave Contract.

A dozen blocks away, in the lake, the huge shadow hiding under the water suddenly opened its eyes. That was a pair of eyes that could instill pure dread. The next second, the tranquil waters suddenly arched its surface as a beast broke free. The Swamp War Crocodile had sensed the calling of its master; it turned in that direction. The beast got out of the water, forming a massive stone bridge underneath its feet. The bridge lifted the crocodile into the air, carrying it across the lake and the streets.

The arched bridge in the sky was casting a large shadow onto the ground.

The battle pet warriors that were wandering on the streets saw the shadow. Out of curiosity,

speechless.

Inside the stadium.

Su Ping held the Talent Stone and stood on the stage quietly. Senior Yan stood next to him, reverent and respectful. He was just wondering why Su Ping had not left yet.

He remembered Su Ping said he was in a hurry. Why would he merely stand there, absent-minded?

The onlookers were wondering that as well. It seemed that Su Ping was waiting for something

All of a sudden, people heard a loud noise and something horrifying was approaching. That thing was not hiding its energy at all. In the private room, the North King was still upset about his plan having been sabotaged. Suddenly, he felt something. He looked up to the sky through the shattered glass ceiling of

A behemoth was approaching, riding on a stone bridge! “Fate Challenger Su...” Senior Yan worked up the courage and tried to ask Su Ping.

Right then, Senior Yan heard a noise that was like an airplane taking off right next to his ears.

Surprised, Senior Yan turned over.

The titled battle pet warriors next to the stage turned to look as well.

The ceiling of the stadium had already been broken. A huge shadow was cast inside. The overwhelming energy crashed what had remained of the ceiling.

Amid everyone’s gazes, that behemoth landed on the stage at the center of the stadium.

The stadium shook as if an earthquake had hit.

Those seated in the chairs were thrown upward.

The cracked walls of the stadium could no longer stand another strike. They broke like eggshells and tons of rubble were falling. Luckily, most people at the stadium were battle pet warriors. They built up astral shields so that the falling stones would not hurt them.

Dust stirred up and blurred people’s vision.

By the stage, the titled battle pet warriors had also built up astral shields. Some with quicker reactions had unleashed astral powers to blow away the dust.

As the dust settled, the behemoth showed itself, which astounded everyone speechless. There was a beast that took up half of the stage crawling on the ground. It was as if the beast had been cast of molten iron, full of domineering power, and exuding a reckless breath.

Beast king!

That was a beast king!

For a moment, people were unsure if their eyes were playing tricks on them because Su Ping, who had been standing on the stage for a while without moving, was at the moment standing on the head of the beast king.

The beast king was Su Ping’s ride?

How inconceivable.

Some titled battle pet warriors were lucky enough to have a beast king for themselves, but their beast kings were nothing like this one. If Su Ping’s beast king was a wild one, then their beast kings were domesticated. The ones with beast king pets could more directly sense the violence of the creature standing on the stage.

Inside the private room, the North King was also taken aback.

This beast king...

His heart skipped a beat. Being a legendary battle pet warrior, he also had beast king pets and he had encountered many beast kings. As such, he understood beast kings better than Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

not the usual kind, and it seemed that... this beast king was not from the Blue Planet!

Even he felt a bit suffocated.

“That guy... He didn’t use the beast king in the battle. If he had, that old man of the Qin family would have probably been eaten up...” North King exclaimed to himself. He was surprised to find that Su Ping had not demonstrated his full strength yet.

He had a beast king waiting outside!

The North King didn’t know if Su Ping had tamed the beast king himself or if someone had helped him capture it. Either way, it made

“I cannot believe we have ignored such a horrifying guy. There must be a legendary

the intelligence guys at the Tower should review their recent work!” the North King said to himself.

On the stage.

The stage had caved in as the Swamp War Crocodile came down from the sky. The walls collapsed. People could even see the streets and buildings outside. Su Ping didn’t care how stunned people were. He shouted to where the titled battle pet warriors were gathered. “Brother Qin, aren’t you coming back with me?”

Qin Shuhai was in a complete daze.

He knew that Su Ping had ridden a beast king to get there, but he could have never foreseen that his beast king would make such a stunning debut, falling from the sky! He had thought that Su Ping was riding on the dragon hound which was as good as a beast

beast king. Su Ping’s words startled Qin Shuhai. He was choked up with emotions as he felt the gazes landing on him. How thrilling this was.

“Coming!” he shouted at once.

He immediately flew up to the stage. He was hovering in the air above the beast king’s head. While looking into that fierce pair of eyes, Qin Shuhai was afraid to land. “Come here,” Su Ping said. Qin Shuhai took a deep breath and summoned up the courage to approach Su Ping.

The Swamp War Crocodile moaned and shook its head unhappily when Qin Shuhai’s feet landed.

“Move it,” Su Ping said.

Rumble~!

The ground shook as a stone pillar emerged, raising the Swamp War Crocodile into the sky. The stone pillar extended horizontally above people’s heads as it protruded outside the venue.

In an instant, the Swamp War Crocodile, as well as Su Ping and Qin Shuhai, had vanished into the horizon.

Left behind them was the stone pillar inside the stadium.

The stadium was in a complete mess. The onlookers eyed each other in speechless astonishment. The Supremacy League had ended in such a dramatic way.

The championship was taken away.

Who would be in the mood to... fight for second place?

Whoosh!

The stone bridge built by the Swamp War Crocodile went past half of the Aurora Base City to the outer wall of the base city. The titled battle pet warriors guarding the place were frightened by the stone bridge, as well as the Swamp War Crocodile on it. Two of them flew up to find out what was going on.

Su Ping noticed that they were the ones who had guided him when he arrived. “Guys, please step away. I’m in a hurry!”

“This is still inside the Aurora Base City. It is not quite proper...” one of the two quickly said. Riding a beast king meant that Su Ping was not one to be messed with. However, the Aurora Base City was under the management of the Free Trade Organization and the organization’s supporter was the Tower. A titled battle pet warrior could not be allowed to behave atrociously inside the base city.

“Piss off!” Su Ping shouted angrily.

When he first arrived in the base city, he didn’t want the Swamp War Crocodile to stomp the streets and affect the residents, so he had let

trying to leave by staying high in the air. How could they stop him at this moment? He was no longer in the mood to care about city rules.

“You...” That titled battle pet warrior was about to say something when the Swamp War Beast roared at him!

They were all standing in the air. That roar was like a sudden clap of thunder. Both titled battle pet warriors trembled. The one who was standing right in front of the Swamp War Crocodile’s face began to bleed from the nose.

The stone bridge extended further out.

Frightened, the two knew better than to stop Su Ping by then. They allowed him to leave, riding on the beast king.

The two looked at the place where the stone bridge started. That was the location of the stadium. Wasn’t North King there? Why would he allow this?

With a bang, the Swamp War Crocodile landed on the ground outside the city wall. The Swamp War Crocodile made off at once. Building a stone wall that went across half a base city had used up much of the Swamp War Crocodile’s energy.

The ground was making a loud noise. Frightened, scared, and happy all at once, Qin Shuhai used astral powers so that he wouldn’t fall from the beast king. With Su Ping, he

to ask for help. Su Ping alone could take care of the beast king that invaded the Longjiang Base City. When that happened, the other beasts would flee helter-skelter.

Longjiang Base City. The highway outside the base city was already in ruins, and the footprints of some beasts could be seen everywhere.

The fortresses built outside the base city were also empty at the moment; there were some human corpses and blood inside. Right then, there were some beasts gathered at the

become their rally points. Standing on top of the outer wall of the base city was an unprecedented number of warriors. All the warriors in the barracks had already been mobilized to the wall.

Some spare watch towers and long-range sniper turrets that were covered in dust were charged with energy and officially activated. The entire Longjiang base city had entered a level-one emergency state.

“Those damned beasts are retreating again!”

On the outer wall, a general was using binoculars to monitor the situation outside, only to see that there were a lot of beast corpses remaining on the wasteland outside the wall, while the rest of the beasts had retreated, as if planned.

“The situation in the north is fine, how’s the east?” the general reported and asked about the situation.

There was a rustle of noise in the intercom, and a moment later an anxious voice said, “The east needs reinforcements, and we need titled battle pet warriors, you... argh!!!”

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly screamed. The general heard a sudden high-pitched scream; his face changed, and he couldn’t help turning his head and looking east. His troops and manpower there were limited, and he could only request reinforcements from the rear. He couldn’t have moved manpower to support the east. On the off chance that the beasts that had just retreated returned, they would also be doomed!

On the east.

Boom! Boom! The flames of war raged across the land! A series of long-range sniper cannons quickly received energy, and then bullets were launched, one by one; low-altitude missiles were discharged as well, flying toward the base city’s exterior. Flames soared, lifting many beasts to the sky.

Outside the base city was a huge crowd of beasts of various kinds. Most of the beasts were of the middle or advanced ranks with few low-rank beasts mixed in.

Among them, there were also some beasts with huge tank-like physiques, and the missiles that were shot at them were blocked by a series of skills the beasts unleashed, detonating in the air.

“Damn, not enough firepower.” Standing on the outer wall were also some powerful humans, including Xie Jinshui who was also a titled battle pet warrior. Standing next to him was Qin Duhuang who was wearing a grave expression. Zhou Tianlin was also standing side by side with Qin Duhuang, gazing at the wild beasts with complicated feelings. “Let me go and deal with some of the tough

Duhuang gazed far into the distance; a behemoth was faintly seen in the horizon. That was a beast king that they had detected, the leader of the beast strike.

The fortunate thing was that the beast king had not involved itself. At the moment, it was only commanding the beasts to gather. If the

Duhuang wasn’t even sure what they could do to stop it.

“Qin, have your battle pet go. I have reason to suspect that the beast king is very intelligent and is observing us. I’m afraid it will sneak up on you if it sees you go down there,” Xie Jinshui cautioned Qin Duhuang.

While that sounded outrageous, Xie Jinshui did make a valid point. Many beast kings were very intelligent, almost as smart as humans, and could speak various languages. Beast kings were not only capable of brutal behavior. They were scheming creatures that could use tricks. A beast king sneaking up on titled battle pet warriors was something that humans despised, but that was the best tactic used by beast kings.

Sneak attacks were among the easiest methods that could lead to success.

That was the most effective way from a beast king perspective! “Okay.”

Qin Duhuang nodded. Indeed, he could not afford to make irresponsible acts. The Qin family needed him.

Soon, several swirls appeared. His battle pets crawled out, including the Fierce Fire Ape that he had just purchased from Su Ping’s store. Roar!

As soon as the ape came out, Qin Duhuang instructed it to charge into the hordes of beasts.

The other battle pets at the peak of the ninth rank also shouted and charged forth. They bulldozed away a bunch of beasts at once.

Zhou Tianlin didn’t just stand around and watch. He summoned his battle pets as well.

The wild beasts’ advance was impeded as their battle pets joined in the fight; several paths were cleared up. While the battle pets participated, the battle pet warriors present could focus on other areas.

“Man, that ape is brutal.” Even Qin Duhuang was a bit surprised to see how the ape fought. That was the first time he had used that battle

familiarize himself with the battle pet after he bought it from Su Ping’s store. He didn’t know the battle pet was so barbaric; it also seemed that its energy would never exhaust. Carrying burning flames, the Fierce Fire Ape dashed around madly, smashing away everything in its way!

I wonder if Mr. Su would regret selling the battle pet to me if he knew how horrifying the ape is, Qin Duhuang asked himself.

He was gloating He had bought that battle pet at the peak of the ninth rank for sixty million astral coins. That was a godsend.

Zhou Tianlin was a bit scared by the ferocious Fierce Fire Ape. He wished he had moved across the street from Su Ping earlier.

Although feeling sorry, Zhou Tianlin didn’t get distracted for long. He focused his mind on his battle pet in case they would fall into a siege. His battle pets would be at a disadvantage if they fell under a group attack.

Most of the wild beasts present were of the middle and advanced ranks. The beasts’ skills could yield stronger effects if they had similar properties, which could even hurt beasts of the ninth rank.

Roar! Roar!

The Fierce Fire Ape and Qin Duhuang’s other battle pets had advanced a long distance.

Xie Jinshui, who was amazed by the Fierce Fire Ape, suddenly noticed that the beasts were splitting up. He realized something terrifying was afoot. “Qin, get your battle pets back right now!” he shouted in alarm.

Qin Duhuang was still gloating about the Fierce Fire Ape when he heard Xie Jinshui’s words. He took a look. Immediately after, he ordered his pets to stop and retreat.

That beast king in the distance had disappeared!

All of a sudden, under the feet of a ninth-rank dragon, the group split up and from a crack reached out a bloody mouth.

Bang!

That mouth bit the dragon which was screaming in misery. Qin Duhuang’s eyes reddened. He immediately shared his astral powers with the dragon. Qin Duhuang heard a noise before the sharing started. The dragon was crying; half of its body was gone! Qin Duhuang turned pale from fright. He ordered the Fierce Fire Ape to come back with the upper half of the dragon right away.

The Fierce Fire Ape reacted quickly; it glared at the strange mouth on the ground. Even though the mouth belonged to a beast king, the ape was not intimidated. The ape made a jump to fetch the dragon; it grabbed its wings, and then hurled it toward the city. Qin Duhuang jumped up. With the help of his other battle pets, he managed to catch the dragon which was barely breathing. “Hang in there. I will get you fixed right away.” Qin Duhuang almost burst into tears. The dragon had been with him for half of his life!

He used astral powers to stop the bleeding and

before he brought the dragon back inside the walls’ protection. As soon as they landed on the wall, Qin Duhuang remembered that the Fierce Fire Ape was still out there. He quickly looked over, only to see that the Fierce Fire Ape was running wildly.

Behind him, that mouth had snuck up from the ground. With several strange appendages, the mouth was chasing the ape. “Run, run!” Qin Duhuang ordered at once while he shared his astral powers with the Fierce Fire Ape.

Roar!!

The Fierce Fire Ape bellowed and the flames were burning even more brightly. The ape was running quickly, like a meteorite falling from the sky.

The beasts that made moves to stop the Fierce Fire Ape were burnt to ashes by the flames.

Whoosh!

All of a sudden, some vine-like limbs grew from the beast king, which entangled the Fierce Fire Ape. The limbs were completely unafraid of the scorching flames surrounding the ape. The ape was finally restrained.

The Fierce Fire Ape shouted and tried to tear off the vines but it wasn’t strong enough.

Qin Duhuang was quaking. He wanted to run out there but Xie Jinshui stopped him. “Qin, calm down. It’s just a pet!” Qin Duhuang’s eyes turned red. A pet? No, not just a pet!

Right then, the ground began to shake.

A noise came from behind the wild beasts and it was getting louder and louder. At the same time, Xie Jinshui’s phone rang. He recognized the number; it was from the

Another beast king was coming to the base city from the east side!

Bang! Bang!

The noise was getting louder and louder! Xie Jinshui and Zhou Tianlin gazed into the distance. Their sight only allowed them to see a blur coming from afar. That blur was getting clearer and clearer.

Веер!

Qin Duhuang’s phone rang. Qin Duhuang convinced himself of moving his eyes away from the Fierce Fire Ape to look at his phone. The call was from Qin Shuhai.

Qin Duhuang poured in more astral powers to further aid the Fierce Fire Ape break free and answered the call at the same time.

“We’re almost there. Where are you?” Qin Shuhai shouted.

Qin Duhuang moved his lips. He tried to talk

Suddenly, Zhou Tianlin shouted, “Look!”

He pointed at the blur that was approaching. The blur was close enough for him to see. He recognized the beast king... It was the one that Su Ping was riding when he left!

It’s Su Ping!

Su Ping is back!!

Zhou Tianlin almost wanted to hop around with joy!

That guy is back! They no longer had to fear the beast kings! No!! Startled by Zhou Tianlin, Qin Duhuang looked at that thing. He could not believe that the man he knew was back.

That behemoth pushed the wild beasts away. The ones that didn’t step to the sides in time were all stomped! Two people were standing on the behemoth. Qin Duhuang was able to see their faces as they got closer and closer! It was Su Ping! And Qin Shuhai! They... came together! Qin Duhuang felt a lump in his throat.

Roar!!!

The sonorous roar echoed in the wild!
