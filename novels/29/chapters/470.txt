Chapter 471 Beast King

The system, “Fierce Fire Ape detected. Calculating selling price...” “The Fierce Fire Ape will be sold at 0.59 million energy points.”

Su Ping: “??!”

Did the system just say 0.59 million energy points?

I spent one million and the ape would be sold at 0.59 million?

That is to say, I practically lost 0.31 million!

What the...

“Hey, are you sure about that? This is a beast at the peak of the titled rank. How can its price be at 0.59 million energy points? That means the price is less than one hundred million astral coins! That is outrageous!”

Su Ping couldn’t help but protest.

A customer could spend 59 million astral coins and get a beast at the peak of the titled rank from his store!

He was practically giving the beast away!

“The figure is calculated according to the beast’s combat strength, aptitude, bloodline, etc. That is the price of the beast in this store. The host shall not swear inwardly. First warning...” The system sounded quite inhumane.

Su Ping moved his lips.

“The host shall not swear. Second warning!” The system sounded more serious.

Su Ping stopped venting his anger. “System, you are doing charity work, do you know that? Any other store would have sold the beast for at least several hundred million. Your price is so much lower than the market value!”

“The host shall not compare this store to the other puny stores out there. Those store owners always consider private gains, they are only running stores to make money as the middle-man! But the system’s price is fair and based on a reasonable evaluation of the beasts. The prices of all the beasts are up to the system’s standard!”

“Lousy excuses. Keep going.” “The host is advised to listen to reason. Do not cross the line.”

“...To hell with thou!”

“No more warning. Punishment executed!”

There was a sudden, weird cry in the room.

A few minutes later, the system asked again, “Does the host have any other questions about the pricing?” “...No.”

“Is the price reasonable?” “Yes...”

“Good. The system is glad that the host can look at the big picture now.” “Sure I do.”

There was this saying. If life f*cked, you, f*ck back. If you couldn’t f*ck life, enjoy it.

Feeling low, Su Ping darted a glance at the Fierce Fire Ape and sent it to the storage space. A swirl came out from nowhere and sucked the Fierce Fire Ape in, then the swirl gradually shrank and disappeared. In the meantime, Su Ping saw a cute profile photo of the Fierce Fire Ape showing up in the system’s shop.

What an adorable little thing. It was so adorable that Su Ping wanted to pinch it to death.

Su Ping shook his head and re-focused his mind on the pool. When he gazed at the pool, the pool was gazing back at him... for his energy points.

Without hesitation, Su Ping did another try.

One setback would not crush him.

It would take two setbacks to crush him.

“Confirm?” “Yes!”

Minus one million energy points.

The strange glow over the Incubation Pool appeared again. The glow was orange in color. It first appeared over the edge and the ancient grains began to move about once more. Many beams of light gathered at the bottom of the pool; a figure appeared as the light became brighter and brighter.

After that, all the beams of light vanished completely. Following that, a surge of powerful energy was spilled out. Su Ping saw that a big and fierce guy was in the pool.

Upon a closer look, Su Ping pulled a long face.

Again, not a beast king.

Again, a beast at the ninth rank and an adult one at that. It was also at the peak of the ninth rank, but it was evidently not going to help Su Ping make money. “Congratulations. Abyss Spirit Feeder from the End Era.”

“Good for me.”

Su Ping asked, “What is the price?” “The Abyss Spirit Feeder is detected to be below average. The price is... 0.65 million!”

Why was he not surprised?

He was losing money again.

Su Ping did some calculations. Two tries and he lost over seven hundred thousand energy points!

What the heck?

“One more time...” Su Ping bit his teeth. He initiated the process without hesitation.

Accuracy and speed! Bad luck would never be able to catch up with him as long as he was fast enough!

Minus one million energy points!

Whoosh!

The pool once again shined brightly; mysterious and complicated patterns flew, and the energy was quickly gathered. After a while, a huge creeping figure appeared; a wild and powerful aura oozed out from its body, deep and terrible. Su Ping’s eyes glowed.

This is it!

As the light dispersed, Su Ping had a clear view of the beast.

The monster was like a giant crocodile, but its shell was like cyan dragon scales. Its pointed crocodile mouth, full of protruding teeth, looked extremely hideous and terrifying. It wasn’t difficult to imagine how painful it would be if one were bitten by this mouth. There was a sharp blade at the tip of its tail, with sharp scales on both sides.

“Congratulations for getting a Swamp War Crocodile from the End Era!”

This time, the system’s voice didn’t sound as obnoxious.

Beast king!

This one must be a beast king!

The disappointing thing was that judging by its looks, it was one that had reached adulthood.

Su Ping had no authorization to take a beast king to the cultivation world yet; if he did, the beast king’s possible death in the cultivation site would be irreversible.

“Let’s look at its price,” Su Ping said. He wasn’t planning on selling it, but he still was interested in the price. He assumed that no store in the entire Subcontinent District could afford to sell a beast king.

“Detecting...”

“The price is 2.13 million energy points.”

II

Su Ping was not sure whether to cry or smile.

The happy thing was that selling the beast king could make up for his previous losses.

The sad thing was that a beast king would only be sold at two hundred million astral coins!

Su Ping was speechless.

“How unlucky do I have to be to not even have one infant beast?” Su Ping shook his head. He no longer wanted to try his luck.

He would save the rest of the energy points in case the system’s shop could come up with something good. He would use energy points then. The Incubation Pool was like a demon that would swallow up all of his energy points.

“Show me the information of the beast king,” Su Ping said in his mind.

Since the beast king came from the store, he had access to the most comprehensive range of information.

Swamp War Crocodile (Beast King) Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Property: Demon Family

Rank: Later stage of the Ocean State

Combat strength: 19.5

Aptitude: poor

Abilities Mastered: Swamp Realm, Brutal Impact, Tearing Bite, Crocodile Strike, Demon Soul Suppression...

Talent: None

“Just an average beast king, huh?”

Su Ping shook his head. He wasn’t surprised that the beast king’s aptitude was rated as poor.

The combat strength of 19.5 was a little bit higher than that of the Little Skeleton. Su Ping could enlighten the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound with the Enlightening Guide. By then, he believed that their combat strengths would see another increase.

“This guy is not of much use to me. Should I sell it?” Su Ping wondered. The Swamp War Crocodile was a beast king that had reached adulthood but the strongest pets he could establish a contract with were those of the ninth rank.

He could have made the Swamp War Crocodile his pet if it were an infant.

But an adult one would crush his spirit.

As for making the beast guard the store for him... He didn’t need it since the friendly girl Joanna was around.

Besides, no one had the courage to create trouble there.

“It’s indeed useless. The Little Skeleton and my other pets will be much better than this Swamp War Crocodile by the time I can sign a contract with a beast king.” Su Ping felt he was in a pickle.

The third time trying the pool didn’t make him lose money, but at the same time, he didn’t think he had gotten anything out of it.

“If I have to sell it, I have to find someone familiar so that he or she will owe me one,” Su Ping said to himself.

Those who could have a beast king as a pet would have to be at least of the titled rank.

He knew a lot of titled battle pet warriors and he had killed a lot of them.

He could barely find any titled battle pet warriors that he was close with.

Not even barely. He couldn’t find one...

At that thought, Su Ping realized that he wasn’t a popular guy. “Never mind. Put it away.”

Su Ping shook his head. He put the Swamp War Crocodile in the storage space and left the room.

He closed the door, feeling that he was keeping a demon at bay. If he couldn’t control himself, he would have used up all the energy points he had saved. That pool was too enticing. Heaven and hell were only within a flash of thought.

He went back to the storefront. Zhong Lingtong and Tang Ruyan were chatting. He didn’t interrupt the girls; Su Ping went to the test room to browse through the system’s shop.

A couple of new products were provided. Products that he didn’t know, did not need, or that were completely useless.

Su Ping began to refresh the page.

“Come come, skill book...” Su Ping prayed. He refreshed the page three times, bought two advanced beast-catching rings, and a material that could help pets of the fire family have a better understanding of their power. Many things could help a pet increase its power of understanding power. For instance, the nursing pen. However, there was no upper limit to one’s understanding of power. The higher the understanding power was, the more skills the pets would learn. The pets with high understanding power could even pick up a talent skill by themselves. “Slave Contract?”

He still saw no skill book, either for pet training or for battle pet warriors, the last time he refreshed the store only a dark purple scroll got his attention.
