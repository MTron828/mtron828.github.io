Chapter 1179: Ancient Palace

One day passed after the other.

“Why are you so obsessed with that little rat?

“I’ve already investigated it. It’s just an inferior pet with a horrible bloodline. It’s not worth training at all; It’ll only occupy your pet spot.

“This rat is too ungrateful. It has eaten so much food of yours, and it’s still too reluctant to go!”

Her friend could not help but try and persuade her into giving up on the little rodent every time she went to care for it.

Days passed.

Su Ping chose to train in seclusion again after taking a two-day rest at the store.

He didn’t close the store this time, though; he simply found a training room he rarely used and stayed there. That way he would appear inside the store and avoid scaring the customers when he returned.

However, even if he were to return to the lobby, nobody would really be shocked. After all, all experts were capable of teleporting…

Su Ping selected the Chaotic Realm of the Undead this time.

Hardly had he arrived when he felt a bone-piercing cold. He opened his eyes, and saw a grim and ominous gray sky, as if rotten flesh were hanging up above; the red moons looked bloody and evil in the dim sky.

“It’s been so long…”

Su Ping heaved a sigh. He smelled the stench of rotten flesh and blood with every breath taken.

He was in the middle of a vast forest. However, the trees were rather creepy, blackened as if subject to lightning strikes. Their branches stretched out, making them look like twisted demons.

“It’s true that every world looks distinctly different…” Su Ping mumbled, then flew across the sky above the forest.

He went to the Chaotic Realm of the Undead for the source of undead power; answers would only be found by encountering some tough undead creatures.

However, unlike the Realm of Deities and the Realm of Gods, the Chaotic Realm of the Undead was home to all sorts of monsters he could barely communicate with.

Su Ping feared that he wouldn’t find any information even if he ran into any powerful beings.

Roar!

While Su Ping pondered—a hoarse and scary roar burst out from the woods down below. It turned out to originate from a black and muddy Corpse Drake.

There were dark red circles all over the drake’s body which looked like eyes. They actually revealed sharp teeth when they opened.

“Even the local monsters are cute…”

Su Ping clicked his tongue and easily dodged the attack. Then, he used his saber aura with abundant divine power, cutting off half of the drake’s head with the attack; black blood and smoke came out, giving off a pungent smell.

Divine power arose inside Su Ping’s body, and the golden light blocked the black smoke like a shield. The clash of black smoke and golden light produced a sizzle and a lethal venom.

Su Ping pointed a finger, darting a beam of golden light into the demon beast. A dazzling golden light burst out of the demon beast in an instant, shattering the creature.

A Star Lord undead creature? Too weak.

Su Ping glanced at the remains and casually took out a black core which contained abundant undead energy.

Without him realizing it, hunting beasts a level higher than his were already as simple and easy as eating and drinking; he couldn’t even have any fun.

After picking up the core, Su Ping moved onward and spread out his senses.

He instantly detected the auras hiding in the forest. They were of different sizes and levels; the weakest were only in the Ocean State and the strongest were Star Lords. That undead Corpse Dragon surely had been a small lord in that forest.

Roar!

All the beasts in the forest were excited since Su Ping had blatantly spread out his senses, plus the undisguised divine power inside his body.

Roars were coming from all directions; the ground was also shaking. Many undead creatures lurking in the dark ran to the open.

A dozen beasts were already charging at Su Ping in the blink of an eye.

There were even pure ghosts and half ghosts among them.

“Looks like my divine power is very popular…” Su Ping instantly realized why those creatures were excited. Many of them were of lower levels, and yet they were going after him, very unlike their usual battle style; most of them preferred ambushing others instead of fighting head-on battles like other beasts.

Su Ping raised a hand. Golden light glittered on his fingertips, releasing thousands of dazzling blades that executed all the undead creatures.

Their bodies rained down from the sky. The pure ghosts simply dissipated after being cut by divine power; no bodies were left behind.

I won’t be able to get any information until I find at least Celestial State creatures…

Su Ping dashed forward right after killing those creatures; it would be pointless to waste time on such lackeys in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead.

A sharp roar came from the woods after he flew across hundreds of kilometers. It was obviously some sort of sound technique able to affect the soul.

Su Ping felt that his eardrums ring, and the effect on his soul was even greater, feeling like a heavy hammer. He was dizzy for a moment.

Exactly at that moment—countless trees in the forest were pushed up from the soil, and a black centipede hundreds of meters long dashed out. The beast’s legs were like sharp scythes. The most ghastly thing was that it had countless pale, scary human faces on its back, all of them looked as if they were facing their mortal enemy.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. “An Ascendant undead beast…”

He didn’t run away. He stopped instead.

“I haven’t really enjoyed a fight yet ever since I established the Small Divinity World. I’ll practice with you for starters.”

The hideous centipede roared, and the countless human faces on its back opened their mouths at the same time. Screams came from all those faces, which entered deep into the soul.

Su Ping trembled and felt dizzy again.

The scary centipede had already dashed forward. The two sharp blades on its forehead slashed at him, ready to cut him apart and turn him into minced meat.

There was a boom; Su Ping felt an excruciating pain after being knocked away. He snapped out of it and saw a wound on the left side of his abdomen, bleeding golden blood.

The wound disappeared in the blink of an eye, just as he watched.

Su Ping couldn’t help but remark, “It heals too fast. I wouldn’t have felt a thing if I hadn’t seen it…”

He gained a clearer understanding of his own body. It was really sturdy!

“Bring it on!”

Su Ping charged at the scary centipede.

He didn’t use his small worlds, simply using physical strength.

A shocking battle burst out. Trees trembled violently, and lots of beasts were scared off.

Su Ping fought the centipede with the most crude boxing techniques, dealing as much as he received. The fight helped him gauge how sturdy his body was.

It was definitely on par with a top-tier artifact!

His body was definitely above average in the Ascendant tier.

In terms of offense, it was below average.

Speed was average, and still he was as fast as the scary centipede.

Above-average defense and below-average offense. Only Heavenly Lords in the Ascendant State can beat me now!?Su Ping thought.

Su Ping heaved a sigh upon remembering the rare materials he had received from the human clan in the world of gods; he owed them a great favor, and could only return it by liberating them.

Su Ping’s body was kept in peak status thanks to the perfect path of vitality, healing soon after being wounded.

The centipede, on the other hand, was already covered in wounds. It didn’t look as ferocious as before.

Su Ping discovered that divine power suppressed the power of the undead. They were like natural enemies!

The wounds caused by his fists took time to heal. Su Ping’s body already contained Ascendant State power at the moment, destructive enough to obliterate any laws. Such oppressive power made it increasingly difficult for the centipede to resist.

The centipede seemed to have realized something after fighting for half an hour straight, right when Su Ping was about to test his five small worlds. It roared and then escaped.

Su Ping was lost for words as he watched the reddened centipede dig into the soil and escape. He gave up the pursuit.

The centipede had been greatly strengthened when its skin turned from black to red. However, it was still unable to beat Su Ping.

“I wonder how strong I’ll be when I truly rise to the Ascendant State…” Su Ping looked forward to that.

Exactly at that moment—a deep pressure was felt.

Su Ping raised his head and looked, noticing a shadow in the horizon. The shadow continued to grow in size as he watched, until it revealed itself as a gargantuan bird.

The creature’s chest had a protrusion with weird faces on it. Smoke was spreading out of some of the faces, as if holding ghosts in their mouths.

“This creature… is a Celestial!”

Su Ping was quite solemn; as expected of a top cultivation site. To think he would encounter a Celestial creature just after entering the site. Most people would never meet the outside world’s twelve Celestials in their entire lives.

Su Ping wasn’t planning on hiding. He released his aura.

The black bird soon noticed him. It turned its head and flew towards him.

“Do you know…” Su Ping opened his mouth and spoke telepathically, right when a terrifying force rushed over and disrupted him. He suddenly felt that there were arms and legs inside his body, which was then torn apart by countless strange hands stretching out of the inside.

“What the…”

Su Ping felt like cursing, but his soul was also torn apart by some sort of power. He was instantly killed.

He resurrected in the same spot.

The black bird approached, as if surprised by Su Ping’s return to life.

“Let me finish…”

Bang!

Su Ping’s body exploded again.

“F*ck you…” Su Ping resurrected again and cursed loudly. This time, the black bird realized something and chose not to kill him right away.

“An immortal god? There doesn’t seem to be such a clan among gods…”

The black bird hovered in front of Su Ping and observed him. Moments later, it suddenly opened its beak and picked him up.

“Can’t we just talk nicely?” Su Ping was infuriated and speechless; the black bird was truly reckless. All Celestials were wise; even though it wasn’t a human being, there should still have ways to communicate. However, it killed him twice without a word.

After cursing the black bird with the Common Tongue of the universe, Su Ping tried asking politely via telepathy, “Senior, do you know where the source of undead power is?”

“Senior?

“Senior, can you hear me?

“Senior, there’s poop on your feather.”

Su Ping kept trying for a long time, but the black bird didn’t respond, at all. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Is it going to take me back to feed its children? Fine! I’ll kill them all and roast them for food!?Su Ping thought angrily.

He didn’t talk again.

The black bird flew really fast; mountains and rivers on the ground seemed to pass in a flowing light. Su Ping didn’t know how long they had been flying; they had surely traversed dozens of galaxies, judging by the angle of the bloody moons.

He soon saw a magnificent black mountain before him.

There were bones scattered about, stretching for thousands of kilometers in front of the mountain, and there were lakes of blood in the lower parts.

There was a splendid palace on the top of the mountain of bones.

The black bird then landed outside of the ancient palace.

There were two stone statues depicting two alluring women outside the palace. Their black wings suggested that they were fallen angels; their faces were soul-stirring.

The statues turned back to normal upon seeing the black bird. Their skins were fair and their plump bodies appealing, able to rouse the most primitive desires of any man.

Su Ping was dazed for a moment, finding the ancient palace rather familiar.

“Have you accomplished the task ordered by the king?” asked one of the alluring fallen angels.

The black bird folded its wings and squatted in front of the palace. One of the ugly faces on its chest suddenly replied with a respectful tone, “It’s done; I’ve fetched the item. On the other hand, I encountered this god on my way back. He’s rather strange; I killed him twice, but he survived somehow.”

Su Ping was almost infuriated to death as he looked at the talking face.

He had been trying to speak to the black bird’s head via telepathy as they traveled, but the creature’s brain was on its chest?

What the…

“A god that does not die?”

Both fallen angels stared at Su Ping, soon realizing that something was off. His level was low, but his body contained an extraordinary power. Still, that couldn’t be the reason why the black bird had failed to kill him.

“It’s been years since I last saw a god in this place.” One of the fallen angels’ eyes turned bloodshot. She put her fingers on her lips and licked them with greed and desire.
