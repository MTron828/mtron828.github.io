Chapter 1299 Dao Child Qing Mu (2)

Time and space collapsed within the blast radius; it would be impossible to revive him just by reserving time and space.

The unexpected scene shocked a lot of people. The conclusion of a battle that was considered evenly matched came with the abrupt death of one participant. It was surprising.

“Did the kid purposefully clash with that guy’s sword?”

An elder smiled in approval.

The big-headed child said helplessly, “He’s indeed smart, but he’s too brutal. How did he pass the admission test anyway?”

“Him being brutal doesn’t mean he’s a bad person; he would be a saint if he kills all the villains in the world. It would be stupid for him to treat the good and the bad in the same way.” The young man chuckled, clearly liking Su Ping’s personality. Obviously, his bias towards human beings also played a part; he favored any of their actions.

Boom!

On the battlefield-gloomy and silent, the genius of the Divine Elephant Clan gazed at the remains of the handsome young man. He finally snorted and said, “Good. There’s nobody in the way anymore. We can have a fair fight…”

Before he could finish-a sword aura went slashing toward him

The elephant-faced genius had a slight change of expression as he countered with a furious punch to break the sword aura. He ended up with a deep wound on his fist.

A second, then a third sword aura went after him before he could even respond with a roar.

The burly genius was infuriated, opting for punching continuously. His fists were bleeding after countering the sword auras; his recovery rate was unable to catch up with the increasing wounds.

Phew!

Su Ping followed right behind the sword auras, with the chaos universe illusion surfacing. He punched furiously, his fist being as massive as a planet, brilliantly enveloping the genius of the Divine Elephant Clan. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Boom. The latter narrowed his eyes and swung his fists as he roared. The next moment, his body was sent flying thousands of kilometers away, leaving a wide space between them.

Su Ping retracted his fist and looked at him indifferently. “You’re no match for me. Don’t waste my time, go back!”

“You!”

The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan flew into a rage, eyes bloodshot; he had never been insulted like that before. His blood was burning, and his strength increased yet again. The enormous ‘Ying’ illusion almost looked real. He punched with an appalling red light in his eyes.

Chaos vortices flashed in Su Ping’s eyes, and killing intent was rising. While looking at the enormous fist heading toward him, he suddenly condensed the intense power of chaos in his blade.

There was an explosion—the fist exploded, and a scream seemed to originate from the void. The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan fell apart; the illusion behind him also turned blurry.

Su Ping dashed forward and kicked him in the head, making his enormous body collapse.

He then sat between the enormous opponent’s eyebrows, pointing his sword downwards; the edge of the weapon was only ten centimeters from one of his huge eyeballs.

Their movements came to a stop; everybody was shocked. Undoubtedly, Su Ping won. Three against one. Excluding the person who was defeated in the beginning, the other two had attacked him simultaneously. However, they were still defeated by Su Ping.

“This guy…”

There was shock in Tan Xiangyun’s eyes, never expecting the young human to be as strong. No wonder he’s stirred up the world recently and everybody knows him. He’s strong, terrifyingly so.

“How embarrassing!”

There was another beautiful woman, who was clad in a red dress. Her look was quite grim; it was a disgrace to all the candidates.

Cheers were heard after a moment of silence. Many people even stood given their excitement, including some of their mentors.

It was splendid and legendary. The man fought against three and won the Dao Child challenge!

Whether or not he became a Dao Child, that battle would be remembered in the Heaven Path Institute for years to come!

“So this is what the geniuses of this world are like!”

“He’s so terrifying!”

“They’re all monsters on the Chaos Talents Rank, but the difference between them was too great!”

“Is he really that strong? Wouldn’t it be like chopping vegetables if they ever fought against normal people at their level?”

While everybody talked excitedly—the genius of the Divine Elephant Clan disappeared from underneath Su Ping’s feet, to reappear thousands of meters away.

There was only shock, humiliation and suppressed fury on this face at the moment.

“You won,” said the big-headed child with a smile. “I never thought you would carve a legend today. Interesting. I’m thinking even more highly of you.”

He turned around and looked at the elephant-faced genius. “You lost. Step back.”

The latter had an awful expression on his face; he left the battlefield in silence. Right before exiting, he said to Su Ping, “Don’t slack off when you become a Dao Child. I will challenge you!”

“Don’t look for me. I won’t be free,” said Su Ping indifferently.

The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan nearly tripped over. Su Ping’s attitude was truly unnerving

In the void

The other four candidates wore grim expressions. Should we really go together? It wouldn’t be gratifying even if they won, while it would be downright embarrassing if they lost. They would only become his stepping stones. Years from that day, people would only remember Su Ping defeating four candidates at the same time. They wouldn’t even know their names, because nobody was interested in losers.

“Everyone.”

Suddenly, one of them said, “If you trust me, I will fight him alone. If I lose, we will make way for him and have him challenge the Dao Child; it won’t be our business whether or not he wins. We’ve done our best as both candidates and Dao Child’s protectors.”

The other three were dazed for a moment, but then realized what he was thinking. Tan Xiangyun said with glittering eyes, “All right then. In any case, it would be humiliating to fight him together, win or lose. Senior Brother Qing Mu can be our representative; you’re the strongest among us. If you can’t beat him, he would truly be qualified to challenge the Dao Child!” “That works. Senior Brother Qing Mu is our last line of defense. I trust him,” said another.

“He’s all yours, Senior Brother Qing Mu. Teach him a good lesson to wipe the arrogance of his inferior clan!”

Although humanity was considered a middle-rank clan, some only had eyes for their own people while the rest were like ants. There was no such thing as a middle-rank clan as far as they knew.

Even the less remarkable among high-ranked clans were also seen as ants by some of the oldest high-ranked clans.

Since they all agreed, the black-haired young man nodded and left for the battlefield.

He told the elder about the arrangement.

The big-headed child understood their reasoning and nodded in approval.

Su Ping frowned, seeing that the other three people were standing farther in the void. “Why is it just you?”

“I am Qing Mu, a prince of the Immortality Clan, one of the seven greatest clans.” The black-haired young man was calm, unfazed by the question. “I used to be a Dao Child, but I failed to defend my position and was demoted. They will forfeit if you can beat me, and then you can challenge the Dao Child.”

Dazed, Su Ping nodded. “I understand. That’s for the best.”

“It’s Dao Child Qing Mu!”

“Dao Child Qing Mu is taking action already! Isn’t he always the last one to be challenged?”

“Looks like he’s planning to end this competition in advance. He must have been angered by that human.”

Qing Mu was known by many of the students and mentors who had been in the institute for a long time; he was a shocking and unparalleled genius. Despite him losing his Dao Child position, everybody respected him, and addressed him with his old title.

“The match is yours if you survive three of my attacks,” said Qing Mu calmly.

“Okay.”

Su Ping accepted; that kind of quick bout was exactly what he was hoping for.
