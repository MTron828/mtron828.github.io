Chapter 1287 Explosion of the Universe (2)

Also… What kind of universe was that?

Although living creatures had yet to populate it, he could tell that Su Ping’s universe was terrifying; its density was greater than that of any universe he had ever seen.

Not even his own universe could compare. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It looks like the combination of many universes. His universe… is made of multiple small worlds, but it’s more powerful than the normal multiple small worlds!”

The middle-aged man had once cultivated five small worlds, while his universe was their fusion, which made him far stronger than creatures of his level; after all, those beasts didn’t know how to cultivate multiple small worlds.

That was the reason why gods could easily suppress their peers and enslave other races.

However, the universe of chaos displayed by Su Ping was much more terrifying.

Could it be that he attained seven small worlds? That’s impossible! Only Ancestral Gods have achieved such a thing! The middle-aged man was too shocked to act.

Su Ping withdrew his universe of chaos and repaired it with the power inside his body. He then looked at his enemy and said, “That was your third attack!”

The senior god sobered up with that taunt, appalling light flashing in his eyes. “That’s right. But you won’t survive a fourth. I will not let someone like you return to the human clan alive. I will use your body to make a puppet. It will affect your potential, but I look forward to what you might become!”

He laughed aloud and charged at Su Ping with his spear.

The latter spoke coldly to the cauldron woman and the old man, “Let’s attack together!”

“Huh?”

Both of them were quite shocked, never expecting that their boss could withstand three attacks from an emperor-level existence, or that he would ask them to die with him.

Yes, they took his request as a deathwish.

Su Ping was indeed an unbelievable fellow, but they could tell that the enemy had yet to become serious. After all, the young man was barely an Ascendant, a major level apart from his enemy!

It was already unbelievable that he could deal with Celestials, but it would be impossible for him to resist an emperor level being!

They soon snapped back after the initial hesitation, hoping to retreat.

Retreat?

There was no retreat now. With everything coming to that point, their only chance to survive was to fight alongside Su Ping.

They cried in their hearts, but they still followed their boss and charged. “Heaven Melting Technique!”

The cauldron woman transformed into an enormous cauldron spitting out flames. It also was producing a traction force as it tried to absorb the God Emperor.

The old man transformed too, becoming an ancient and ragged book laden with old deity scripts. It floated in the sky and tried to envelop the enemy.

“Humph!”

The middle-aged man sneered and suddenly stabbed forth with his spear, aiming to tear the sutra apart to then smash the cauldron.

Boom. The cauldron was smashed into the ground, causing a massive pit. Cracks were formed on the artifact’s surface.

The unstoppable God Emperor roared and charged at Su Ping with his spear.

Su Ping felt the enormous power condensed on the spear. Aside from Dao Glyphs, there was another power similar to a Celestial small universe’s power. Still, there were slight differences; it seemed to be more concentrated!

Is that the power of God Emperors? Su Ping’s eyes were shining. He unleashed the universe of chaos and rose to the sky.

After a boom, his universe of chaos turned into a giant sword and slashed out.

The universe was humming, and Su Ping was also shaking. A dark space that could swallow everything was caused by the friction.

How sturdy! The God Emperor was also shocked. His eyes were glittering; it was horrifying to find that Su Ping’s universe could withstand one of his attacks!

He swung his spear in rapid succession, launching countless shadows that fell like a meteor shower in the sky.

The universe-made sword slashed at a fast speed. Su Ping shook every time it clashed with the spear shadow, as the impact was directly imposed on his body and soul. His body would have already collapsed under the pressure if it weren’t hard enough.

The cracks in his small universe grew in number.

“Is this your real power?” Su Ping roared furiously, knowing he was reaching his limits.

He didn’t expect to defeat that God Emperor. He only wanted to gauge his real power.

The two of them moved to put some distance between each other. The God Emperor stood proudly in the sky while holding his spear. There was no more disdain in his eyes, only solemnity; Su Ping’s universe was beyond his imagination. The horror of that human’s existence became increasingly clear to him during those clashes. If the young man ever reached his level… He knew he would be no match for him.

That was unacceptable and intolerable for a high-ranked god such as himself.

“You are indeed a rare genius with the potential of an Ancestral God!” said the God Emperor with cold and indifferent eyes, “Unfortunately, you stand out too much, completely ignoring the importance of keeping a low profile. Since you yearn to witness my power, I shall grant your wish. It is but a small gift for your passing!”

Although he hated to admit it, the man found Su Ping a little bit admirable.

That’s right. Even though he looked down on other races, a genius such as Su Ping would never be restricted by any race. He would truly become the hope of humankind’s rise if he grew up.

After such a claim, Su Ping also concealed his aura and concentrated all his strength. He then stared at his enemy and said, “Bring it on!”

“Let me show you the real power of an emperor!

“This is my universe…”

Once he said that, a purple universe rose gradually behind his back, like a strange purple moon; it was elegant, mysterious, and extremely powerful, which caused continuous energy tides in the void.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and stared at the purple universe; he could see a lot of embedded Dao Glyphs. Furthermore, there seemed to be tracks inside the universe; they seemed to be carrying power and sending it to the core.

Is that a God Emperor’s universe? It is indeed a bit different from mine…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He could tell that something was somehow hidden in that universe. Aside from that, the power inside that universe was extremely condensed; it wasn’t as dispersed as in his universe of chaos.

The God Emperor raised his spear while Su Ping examined his purple universe, which instantly flew towards the tip of the spear. His face was illuminated by purple light, making him look dignified and powerful.

“Spiritual bird, a hundred chirps!”

A wave of sharp bird calls resounded. A purple divine bird flew out of the universe and shrieked, wings unfolding. The entire purple universe fell as he swung the spear; the bird swooped down along with the purple universe, carrying an unparalleled pressure.

Su Ping instantly felt that his body was frozen. The pressure he was experiencing was almost suffocating.

His blood flowed in reverse and he roared, unleashing all his power with God’s Arrival. He pushed the universe of chaos forward.

The cracked universe of chaos turned into a streak of light and moved to smash the bird.

However, the creature was agile enough to dodge right before they came close. The purple universe following right behind split open and swallowed Su Ping’s universe of chaos like a huge mouth.

Then, the bird approached and simply drowned Su Ping with its power.

Su Ping then had the sensation that something had invaded his head. Narrowing his eyes, he knew the guy was trying to capture him alive. He hurriedly detonated the universe of chaos.

Bang.

A dull explosion was spread out of the purple universe. The impact was so massive that even the shrieks inside Su Ping’s head were gone.

The God Warrior in the sky was dazed, not expecting Su Ping’s ruthless move: to destroy the universe he had arduously cultivated.

“So stupid…” he couldn’t help but whisper. Fury appeared in his cold eyes. He suddenly stabbed toward the place in the void where Su Ping was, blowing the area into smithereens.

The Inferno Dragon and the others that had been observing the battle in the void were shattered to pieces by the spear attack. They were utterly unable to escape.
