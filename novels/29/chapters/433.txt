Chapter 435 One Punch to Cancel all Disputes

Wu Tianming pulled a long face.

It was just one person. Why the need for an argument?

He could tell that the middle-aged man was not targeting Su Ping, but deliberately making things awkward for him.

He and the middle-aged man were on bad terms. The latter was just trying to embarrass him in public.

“If the average man you found dared to stand up in front of a ninth-rank beast, I would admire that man for his courage, even if he did nothing else!” Wu Tianming retorted.

He wasn’t there when Su Ping took action.

However, Su Ping had the courage to stand with Ji Zhantang. For that reason alone, Wu Tianming held Su Ping in high regard. Ji Zhantang felt embarrassed.

He knew exactly what happened. It was him who didn’t help.

“My lords, you have misunderstood. That ninth-rank beast...”

“This is not your place to talk!”

Ji Zhantang swallowed down his words and his face became clouded.

The skinny middle-aged man looked at Ji Zhantang from the corner of his eye. The former said to Wu Tianming, “Courage, right? I don’t want to argue with you. Okay, you say he has courage. So, later, when the Lion Eagle arrives, don’t help. I will let him travel with us if he has the courage and guts to climb onto the back of the Lion Eagle by himself!”

Wu Tianming couldn’t believe that.

Roar!!

Right then, a roar was heard from the far off horizon.

The roar was a mix of a lion and a beast, a loud call that was awfully penetrating.

Startled, everyone looked up, only to see many massive figures approaching.

As the figures came close, people were able to see that those figures were mountain-like lions that had fierce eyes and long fangs. Those lions were quite hideous-looking.

The lions had two dark purple wings with a span of over a dozen meters long; all of them had been saddled.

Bang! Bang! Bang! As the Lion Eagles landed, the ground shook and the airstream blew people’s hair back. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The Purple Cloud Lion Eagles!”

Ji Qiuyu felt his heart was racing.

There were many types of Lion Eagles and the weakest of them all was of the fifth rank. But the Purple Cloud Lion Eagles were quite formidable. They were of the eighth-rank, and rather aggressive.

Remembering the skinny middle-aged man’s words, Ji Qiuyu looked at Su Ping with worry.

“Let the VIPs get on first.” The skinny middle-aged man waved his hand.

Someone immediately made a move to contain the Lion Eagles and invite those who had dressed up nicely, or the ones who appeared to be powerful, to get onto the Lion Eagles.

Each Lion Eagle carried five fixed seats.

On the back of the Lion Eagle’s neck was another seat for the master, aka, the “pilot.”

The VIPs from the private cabins stepped onto the Lion Eagles one after the other. Once the seats were taken, a Purple Cloud Lion Eagle would fly up to the sky under its master’s command.

“You who have acted heroically can go now,’ The skinny middle-aged man said.

Those who had been standing close by climbed up to the Lion Eagles’ backs. Ji Zhantang, his granddaughter, as well as the other ones’ who helped in the other cabins got onto one Purple Cloud Lion Eagle. Most who had offered to help were advanced battle pet warriors or master battle pet warriors like Ji Zhantang. They weren’t afraid of the Purple Cloud Lion Eagles, but they trod lightly at the same time, afraid to provoke the short-tempered pet.

“Grandpa.”

Su Ping was standing on the ground all by himself. Ji Qiuyu was unable to stand that. She yanked her grandpa’s sleeve.

Ji Zhantang heaved a sigh. He did try to defend Su Ping just then, but the middle-aged man didn’t even care about that. True, the old warrior had helped, but as far as the middle-aged titled battle pet warrior was concerned, Ji Zhantang was nothing. And yet, the old man was not that worried about Su Ping. He had witnessed how Su Ping had punched that old man in the suit to death. Ji Zhantang was not sure if it had been a sneak attack but he knew that the young man was not a weak one. The Purple Cloud Lion Eagles could scare the average advanced battle pet warriors but not Su Ping “Don’t worry, he’ll be fine. He’s much more powerful than you think,” Ji Zhantang whispered to comfort his granddaughter. Ji Qiuyu tried to say something else when she felt a strong shake. The Purple Cloud Lion Eagle that they were sitting on had flapped its wings and soared to great heights.

In an instant, she couldn’t even see the people standing on the ground at all.

“The last one.”

The skinny middle-aged man looked at Wu Tianming and cast a glance at Su Ping. “Don’t say that I never gave you a chance. Go. Tianming said you dared to face a ninth-rank beast. Show that to me.”

Wu Tianming glared at the middle-aged man and whispered to Su Ping, “Just go and don’t worry about anything. I will protect you if the Lion Eagle attacks you!”

He said that to Su Ping to help him feel secure.

After all, fear often came from the worry of danger. Su Ping didn’t do anything. He asked the skinny middle-aged man, “Who the hell are you? Why do I have to show anything to you?”

The skinny middle-aged couldn’t believe what he had just heard. Wu Tianming was also surprised. He never imagined that Su Ping could be that bold. “Punk, what did you just say!”

The skinny middle-aged came back to his senses. In a fit of rage, he mobilized his astral powers, trying to threaten Su Ping.

Wu Tianming rose to the occasion. He set up a layer of astral power shield over Su Ping to protect him from the overwhelming stress. “Enough! Do you want to beat him up?!”

The skinny middle-aged man glared at him. “I a titled battle pet warrior, shall not be humiliated like this. He won’t leave this place alive today!”

Wu Tianming didn’t step away. He knew that Su Ping had acted rudely, and he had offended a titled battle pet warrior.

At the same time, he was more than glad to hear those words!

“You won’t hurt him as long as I’m still here!” Wu Tianming was not going to give the slightest concession.

“Wu Tianming, what do you mean? He has insulted me and yet you’re defending him. Are you trying to make yourself my enemy?!” The skinny middle-aged man stared at Wu Tianming.

Wu Tianming sneered. Hmm, it was not like this was the first day we’ve had a disagreement and everyone knew it. So what?

“Why do you have to be so competitive with such a young man when you’re a titled battle pet warrior? Even I feel ashamed for you!”

“Did you not hear his insult?”

“No!”

That answer pissed the skinny middle-aged man off. He darted a look at Su Ping who was standing behind Wu Tianming, then he bit his teeth and took a deep breath. “Fine. I will stop. Let him climb up to the Lion Eagle. But we have to make a deal. You cannot blame me if he cannot!”

Wu Tianming sneered at him. “Good luck. Don’t worry. I’ve got you!” He turned around and encouraged Su Ping.

‘OV

Su Ping squinted his eyes.

The skinny middle-aged man had said nicer words but he could tell that the latter was even more determined to end his life.

Still, he was not in the mood to waste time on a contention of mouth and tongue. He turned around and looked at the huge Lion Eagle.

Su Ping kicked to propel himself off the ground and hopped onto the Lion Eagle’s back.

The Lion Eagle snorted unhappily as Su Ping jumped up. The others would always climb up its wings carefully, and this man had jumped up so rudely. While the Lion Eagle was processing its anger, a sharp pain came through from the end of its tail.

The tail was its weakest part and such a pain was the easiest way to provoke the Lion Eagle!

Roar!!

The Purple Cloud Lion Eagle’s eyes reddened. The Lion Eagle was even more pissed at the human being and wanted to destroy him!

While the Lion Eagle was about to resort to action, all of a sudden, it looked into his eyes, a pair of freezing eyes. There seemed to be demons lurking in that pair of eyes.

The demons were wicked and ferocious. That look had poured cold water over the fury in the Lion Eagle’s heart. The pet’s eyes cleared up. The Lion Eagle trembled as it stared at the young man, and could not help but collapse on the ground. The beast placed its wings over its head, curled up, and quivered.

That reaction came as a surprise to everyone.

A second before, the Lion Eagle was angry; but the next second, it had become frightened, trembling like a quail.

Su Ping had sat down. Of the five seats on the back of the Lion Eagle, four had been taken.

The four people who were already there were astounded by what had just gone down.

Su Ping darted a look at the empty seat. Instead of sitting down, he turned around, furiously. “What?”

The skinny middle-aged man was stunned after seeing how the Purple Cloud Lion Eagle was shuddering in fear. Just then, he had secretly provoked the Lion Eagle which should have been full of wrath instead of fear.

Besides, the Lion Eagle was angry in the beginning. Why did it suddenly feel scared?

Lion Eagles were supposed to be aggressive beasts.

He felt a sense of fatal danger while he was trying to figure that out. He looked up and saw the young man standing on the back of the Lion Eagle.

He was surprised by the young man who was directing killing intent at him.

That kid wants to... kill me?

How strange. The middle-aged man couldn’t even decide whether he should scold him or laugh at him.

Who does this punk think he is? He’s just a nobody!

“You and I didn’t have any past disagreements, but you still have deliberately placed obstacles in my way. I won’t make things too difficult for you... If you can survive one of my punches, all that happened will be water under the bridge and I won’t make a big fuss about the past!” Su Ping crossed his hands behind his back as he stared down at the middle-aged man coldly. He spoke with a calm tone and his voice was clear to everyone.

The skinny middle-aged man was not the only one shocked. Wu Tianming—who was still processing his joy after Su Ping climbed to the back of the Lion Eagle-was also dumbstruck. The other four on the Lion Eagle looked at Su Ping as if he were an idiot.

Was this man out of his mind?

Who gave him the courage to challenge a titled battle pet warrior?!
