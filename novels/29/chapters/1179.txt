Chapter 1180: The Skeleton King

Su Ping stared at her sexy lips for a while, suddenly wishing he could be her finger.

“Stop horsing around. He must be delivered to the king,” said the other fallen angel in a scolding tone. She then glanced at Su Ping alluringly, before she threw out a black energy chain to tie him up.

“This is how you like it?”

Su Ping was restricted by the chain; he could not break free. He tried for a bit but then gave up.

“Follow me.”

The two fallen angels turned around and flew into the palace.

The black bird respectfully reduced its body size to several meters tall and followed them.

Inside the palace—

The place was gloomy and spacious, with bones of all sorts of creatures around the pillars. There were obvious claw and teeth marks on some of the remains.

There were also piles of sticky fur and pools of smelly, rotten flesh.

Su Ping instantly found the palace familiar. It wasn’t until he saw the enormous throne at the end of the palace that he realized it was one of the palaces he had entered through random resurrections on his first trip to the Chaotic Realm of the Undead.

He had obtained the Little Skeleton’s bloodline from the treasures underneath the throne.

A skeleton wearing a ragged, ancient armor was sleeping soundly on the throne at the moment, hand holding up its chin.

“I didn’t know it was this dude…” Su Ping mumbled to himself, having mixed feelings after he felt the pressure.

Back then, he only knew that the skeleton king was extremely terrifying, but he didn’t know how high its level was. After all, the Ascendant and the Celestial realms were the same in his eyes.

It wouldn’t matter how strong you were when I was too weak.

However, Su Ping instantly felt how terrifying the skeleton king was. Even though it was sleeping, it pressured him as if he were confronting the emperors of the Rain Clan.

It was definitely an emperor-level creature!

The two fallen angels respectfully flew down and knelt before the throne.

The black bird, on the other hand, shivered and knelt behind Su Ping.

Su Ping, however, simply stood there in chains, looking around.

The fallen angels’ expressions showed fear when they noticed this. They transmitted dark power through the chain and Su Ping felt pressure on his shoulders. His back bent, and the chain caused excruciating pain that made it hard for him to concentrate.

“Bi*ches, what are you doing?” roared Su Ping in agony while holding his head.

His roar echoed inside the quiet palace. The two fallen angels and the black bird trembled, scared stiff.

They had no idea that such a low level creature would be bold enough to talk despite the king’s overpowering pressure!

They raised their fearful heads and looked at the throne, only to see two spots of red light in the empty sockets of the king’s skull.

The pressure inside the palace became even heavier and squeezed the visitors, rendering the fallen angels and the black bird too scared to breathe.

The fallen angel who had enchained Su Ping was shivering; she lowered her head to her chest, until it was impossible to go any further. She said in a shivering voice, “My king, forgive me for letting this wretched god disturb you. I’ll get rid of him immediately…”

The skeleton king didn’t change his posture, but the red light in his eye sockets became brighter and brighter. The light dwindled soon after, his red eyes returning to a normal size.

“Gods…” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He gazed at Su Ping, with a young yet intimidating voice. “It’s been so many years since a god appeared in this world. Weren’t all the arrogant and ignorant gods not annihilated in the war?”

Su Ping held back the pain caused by the chains. He asked, “You’re aware of the godly war? Were you their enemy during the war?”

The fallen angels and the black bird were frightened yet again by his questioning.

This guy is too bold. How could he speak to our king like that?

“How audacious!”

One of the fallen angels, still scared, glared at Su Ping viciously. “Shut up and kneel! You’re not qualified to speak to the king while standing!”

Su Ping clicked his tongue and said, “Your attitude is no different from that of the gods. You’re his subordinate, so it’s fine for you to kneel. Have you never heard of the saying that ‘your son’s son isn’t your son’? Of course, there’s also the possibility that your son is not actually yours.”

“What nonsense are you talking about?”

The fallen angels were so infuriated they wanted to tear Su Ping’s mouth apart to prevent him from uttering another syllable.

“I’m not his employee anyway; you cannot threaten me,” said Su Ping casually.

“You!”

The fallen angels were angry and scared, fearing that their king would blame them, obliterating them all along with Su Ping.

The black bird, still submissively placed behind Su Ping, couldn’t have felt more regretful.?I should have eaten this god on the way over if I knew he would behave like this.

The thought of eating him crossed the bird’s mind, but it feared that the king would notice the lingering smell.

The skeleton king gazed at Su Ping, impassive. He slowly raised one of his fingers, pointed it at Su Ping, and then pressed down.

Crack!

Su Ping instantly detected an unusual force inside his body. All his bones were squeezed; his shoulders were pushed down and his back was bent.

Su Ping’s expression changed.?Is this the power of an emperor??He tried his best to control his body, but failed. His body was being bent bit by bit by an unimaginable might. He was as vulnerable as grass.

Su Ping roared in his heart. He would rather resurrect on the spot than be humiliated and made to kneel.

He unleashed the power of his small worlds; their illusions manifesting behind him. The Golden Crow shrieked to the sky at the same time. The materials used to refine his body also produced unusual phenomena too, including elephants, dragons, lions, and many others.

The five small worlds, which blossomed like lotus flowers, illuminated the dim palace and made it more brilliant than ever.

“This…”

The fallen angels and the black bird were shocked. They looked at Su Ping in disbelief.

Even though Su Ping was still absolutely vulnerable in their eyes and they could easily deal with him, it was unbelievable to see he had established five small worlds!

They couldn’t have achieved that at his level!

The red light in the skeleton king’s eye sockets shook. He was also surprised by such display.

He suddenly stopped pressing his finger.

But the next moment—he pressed down brutally.

After a boom, the five small worlds behind Su Ping exploded like brilliant glass.

Su Ping trembled and vomited blood. He fell on the ground. All his ribs were shattered; his internal organs were dislocated and fissured too.

“An unparalleled genius god… and an enjoyable toy.” The skeleton king put his hand down indifferently and looked down at Su Ping. “You can’t be alone. Tell me where the rest of your clansmen are, and maybe I’ll spare your life and let you serve me!”

The fallen angels and the black bird shivered, not daring to make a move. All of them kept their heads lowered, touching their chests.

Su Ping struggled to raise his head, feeling that he was falling apart. His path of vitality had been suppressed, making it impossible to heal his body. That was the first time he had experienced the power of an emperor in a head-on clash. He was still too vulnerable for such an encounter!

“If I may ask, do you have a mom?” Su Ping asked feebly.

“?”

The skeleton king was clearly puzzled, but he replied casually, “I was born by absorbing the soul power in the world. The sky and earth count as my mother.”

Su Ping put on a smile and said, “Then, am I lying right on your mother’s body and penetrating her?”

The skeleton king was stunned, but he soon realized what Su Ping meant. The red light in its eyes dazzled. The next moment, a stormy force was swept out, blowing away the dry bones and the sticky fur. After a boom, the force was imposed upon Su Ping, and he was instantly shattered.

His limbs, chest and head were separated and his guts spilled out.

However, he was still alive thanks to his remarkable vitality.

Furthermore, he would have recovered instantly were it not for the restriction of that unknown power.

“Are you letting me do your mother in more positions?” asked Su Ping feebly while still smiling.

Bang!

Su Ping’s head instantly exploded.

The skeleton king was as cold and scary as the abyss. The palace was almost frozen.

“Little dummy…” Some of the flesh wriggled and gradually condensed into a tiny mouth, which spoke with obvious mockery.

Bang!

That bundle of flesh exploded too.

“Little dummy…”

“Little dummy…”

All the bits of flesh scattered all over the ground grew mouths and spoke.

That was the ability of the Eight Nine Astral Painting of the Chaos Star Chart, which could disintegrate and reorganize any of his cells.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

All the flesh exploded.

The two fallen angels and the black bird trembled in fear with each explosion. They found it absurd.?Is this brat a lunatic? Why is he so tough while on the verge of death?

Some of the blood splashed on the black bird and turned into a mouth. This unnerved the black bird, making it shake its feathers in an attempt to shake off the blood.

Alas, the skeleton king moved even faster. Before the shaking did anything, a force had squeezed the bird, making the blood blow up along with half of the black bird’s wing.

The excruciating pain made the black bird want to scream, but it managed to hold back. It was shivering in agony while doing its utmost to be still.

“Why are you provoking me? Do you want to die?”

The skeleton king raised a hand, sucking five balls of golden flesh toward him from the floor. Those bits of flesh were still calling him ‘little dummy’ with their little mouths.

The skeleton king sneered, “I won’t kill you so easily; I will read your memories, locate your clan, and let you watch how your clan is destroyed. Then, I’ll hand you to the Soul Refining Insects; they will nibble you for a billion years and make you wish you were dead!”

“Little dummy!”

The skeleton king was exasperated, but still managed to hold back. Some sort of power enshrouded Su Ping’s flesh; his soul was still intact, even though his body was almost destroyed. At the moment he sensed that a cold wind had entered his mind.

The skeleton king emerged in his mind.

“Brat, show me all your secrets. You’ve cultivated five small worlds and shown the potential of an emperor. The gods must have a perfect shelter where they trained you; you shouldn’t have exposed them…” The skeleton king sneered and ignored Su Ping’s clone in his consciousness. It simply dived down.

Countless memories flashed around.

Soon after, the skeleton king saw how Su Ping visited their world, noticing the unusual store as well as Su Ping’s past, including how he cultivated the five small worlds.

The memories were displayed, from Su Ping’s Star State to the Ocean State, and from the federation to the Blue Planet.

Ninth-rank, eighth-rank, seventh-rank… The memories about his every level surfaced.

It dated back all the way to the day when Su Ping entered the store.

Clang!

There was a boom—the skeleton king trembled, feeling it would soon explode!

The whispers that Su Ping heard when he entered the store were like a hammer in his consciousness at the moment, which were about to collapse the skeleton king’s body!

While in a trance, there seemed to be a magnificent shadow surfacing in Su Ping’s consciousness.

The shadow was gradually taking the shape of a splendid building…

Boom~!

The skeleton king’s consciousness fell apart. Right before collapsing, it seemed to have noticed something, which made it shriek in fear!

Back on the throne, the skeleton king seemed to have just woken up from a nightmare. It shouted hysterically! “No!”

It didn’t even sound like before. The fallen angels and the black bird were dumbfounded.

Phew! Phew!

The skeleton king breathed heavily. All of its bones shook.

Even though it didn’t have any flesh and was nothing but bones, the skeletal being felt it had cold sweat all over.

The shivering made the skeleton king’s bones rub against each other, causing noises. It wasn’t until a long time passed that the creature finally stopped shaking. It looked at Su Ping’s flesh and said hoarsely with fear, “You… You’re the chosen one…”

“What?”

Su Ping was confused.

He was quite taken aback by the skeleton king’s unexpected response. The guy was all proud and intimidating moments earlier, but he now seemed to have gone through a nightmare. Right after waking up, it was almost falling apart, legs shaking.?Is the guy suffering from kidney energy deficiency?

Su Ping unconsciously glanced at the guy’s empty abdominal area.
