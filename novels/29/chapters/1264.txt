Chapter 1266 The Skeleton Demon (1)

“How’s it possible…”

Mo Ri was sent flying tens of thousands of kilometers away. He quickly returned with unconcealed shock.

A mere Ascendant creature is able to compete with my small universe?

This time he was serious, and yet he was unable to suppress the creature. None of the Heavenly Lords in the universe were capable of such a feat!

A figure quickly dashed towards Su Ping in the midst of the explosion. He was none other than Ye Chen.

Die!

Ye Chen was determined to kill Su Ping; he attacked furiously and shattered the void. Black dragons seemed to be etched around his ax-like arm. They represented the power of ancient Dao Glyphs.

Laws were withering and rotting in the void; the dark ax swallowed everything. However, a dazzling light rushed out of the explosive chaotic energy before it approached Su Ping. It was the Little Skeleton.

It wasn’t trapped by Mo Ri’s universe. The little one held the bone saber, looking like a domineering tyrant of the abyss as it roared and charged at Ye Chen.

The latter was shocked and infuriated. Did Mo Ri fail to take care of this pet? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He turned his ax and slashed forth. Another terrifying impact burst out in the void, causing the City of Sins to quake; countless buildings were cracking.

The Dao Glyphs were making the laws in those buildings collapse.

Ye Chen detected the blast and found it impossible to resist; he had to retreat. He looked at Mo Ri who was at the moment flying over, then shouted with shock and fury, “What are you doing?”

Mo Ri was rather embarrassed too. He offered an awkward sounding reply, “That thing is quite peculiar with its seven small worlds. I was careless!”

“Don’t be careless again; let’s get this over with. We’ll be screwed later in the future if the magic store protects him” Ye Chen flew into a rage.

Mo Ri stayed silent; it wasn’t the right time for arguments. Dark light was gathered all over his body and eclipsed the stars above. An enormous dark universe appeared, studded with countless stars.

“Ancient Devil Imprisonment!”

Mo Ri performed the secret skill. He was going to completely seal the Little Skeleton with his universe as a medium.

A power on par with Dao Glyphs was stretched in the void and ensnared the Little Skeleton. The pet’s laws lost effect, and its power was suppressed.

The Little Skeleton backed away, but was quick to stop; Su Ping was merely several dozen meters away.

The little pet couldn’t retreat any longer!

Roar!!

Flames surged out of the Little Skeleton’s eye sockets, like bloodshot. It roared and condensed the seven Ascendant worlds inside its body; all of its bones were set ablaze with the aura of chaos.

The skeleton’s power grew significantly, then swiftly swung its saber while facing the invisible shackles.

Thousands of undead troops charged out, evening out the void and breaking the entrapment!

“This thing has also mastered Dao Glyphs. Such a desperate way of using them can be its undoing!” Mo Ri was shocked by the incredible development. Not only did the Ascendant pet know Dao Glyphs, it was also using them to fight a Celestial. He could tell that the skeleton was burning its potential.

“Damn it, let’s take care of this thing together!”

Ye Chen realized that something was off, as Mo Ri was having a hard time finishing off that creature. This surprised and angered him; not only was Su Ping tricky to deal with, even his pet was troublesome. What if this pet reached the Celestial State? Wouldn’t the boy have the power to crush all Celestials with just the pet?

A hazy universe appeared behind his back; dark and silver colors were intertwined like the ancient power of Yin and Yang. The sun, the moon, the stars, and countless people could be seen within.

“The Power of Worship!”

Ye Chen invoked the power of the domesticated lives within his inner domain and strengthened his universe. His universe then crushed all laws like a comet and moved to crush the Little Skeleton.

The latter raised his head, flames hopping in its eye sockets. The only thing it could see was the massive incoming universe.

How could it resist the impact of an entire universe?

The pet’s previous battle experiences made things clear; it was impossible to resist such an attack.

The best option was to dodge!

Still, the skeleton didn’t dodge; it clenched the bone saber instead. A complex energy surged out, which was a mixture of undead power, divine power, and chaos power.

There was a boom: the pet detonated the first Ascendant world!

Then, the second!

The two detonations covered its body with white flames, which were like the infinite resentment in the world. Hoarse cries coming from hell could be heard!

The overwhelming power made the pet expand to almost thirty meters in height. Having become a skeleton giant, it raised its saber and slashed out.

The saber attack mustered all its power, and countless undead creatures flew away, just as if hell itself would have been hurled in its entirety at the universe.

Boom!

There was a magnificent clash, and everybody saw the most unbelievable scene.

The Ascendant from the other star zones were able to witness such a portent from a distance.

An Ascendant State pet had confronted a Celestial expert’s pressure and resisted his attack head-on!

Many felt their blood curl as they watched the roaring and unyielding figure under the falling universe!
