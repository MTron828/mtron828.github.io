Chapter 396 Wanna Learn? Learn from the Skeleton!

That was a crushing defeat. To count how many seconds had passed was meaningless at this point. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The Little Skeleton had merely waved its saber once but none of the six battle pets at the peak of the ninth-rank was able to withstand the strike, even when all of them had taken precautions. The Little Skeleton must have legendary-rank power!

A battle pet like that. What would that entail?

It implied that no titled battle pet warrior, no matter how powerful they were, could beat the Little Skeleton. The only ones that could overpower the Little Skeleton would be the legendary battle pet warriors!

In other words, the young man was the most powerful of all entities below the legendary rank!

To talk about the three-second was pointless. He finally understood why the young man would walk over and show him the stopwatch as if nothing had happened.

Xie Gange was filled with complex feelings. He could not put his thoughts into words. Outside.

The elders of the major families, Venerable the Blade and Tang Ruyan were all rooted to the spot.

Their astonishment continued even when Su Ping went to show Xie Gange the time. That was a horrifying move!

Xie Gange, the King of Arms, a warrior at the peak of the titled rank, lost after one move?

It was merely one move!

And he had been defeated!

For a time, even Venerable the Blade, who wore a transfixed expression, could not quite understand what had happened.

Xie Gange and Venerable the Blade were well-matched in strength. Venerable the Blade had never had the chance to fight against Xie Gange, so he could hardly tell which one of them would emerge victorious. However, it was a fact that Xie Gange was at the peak of the titled rank, having earned fame for years!

It was hard to believe that he would be put to rout directly, not to mention the fact that he had been fully prepared!

Legendary!

That skeleton had to be a battle pet at the legendary rank!

For Venerable the Blade, it sounded beyond logic and reason. The skeleton was just learning from him not long before!

Standing behind him was Tang Ruyan who was also frozen on the spot.

Legendary battle pet?

If that were the truth, then her Tang Family...

At this thought, her heart skipped a beat. She could not help but tremble. She had given up hope.

“Face the music now. Do you yield?”

Su Ping put away his phone and stared at Xie Gange.

Xie Gange cleared his mind. His mouth twitched. For all those years, this was the first time he had heard this question.

Yield? He would have challenged the Little Skeleton several more times if he were still in his youth when he had a short fuse.

That hot-temper had gotten him into many troubles. He had amended his personality with the passage of time.

“Can I go with the first option?”

Xie Gange produced a forced smile and he no longer sounded indifferent. The skeleton’s marvelous skill had stunned him. Besides, he was well aware that he had just seen the tip of the iceberg!

But the tip was already more horrifying than how they had previously anticipated!

He could not help but wonder how terrifying the part of the iceberg that was underwater would be.

He couldn’t afford to anger the young man!

He couldn’t anger him!

The girl was just a kid trained by the organization. She had to be sacrificed. So be it. Because there were many other promising kids in the organization!

It would be stupid to jeopardize the entire organization over a single kid! Xie Gange felt lucky that Su Ping had stopped the skeleton in time. Otherwise, if the skeleton had killed him there, then the nature of this event would change.

Xie Gange was one of the “flags” of the Star Organization! If he were to die there, the Star Organization would go all out and retaliate against Su Ping!

By then, if it turned out that a legendary battle pet warrior was supporting this store, then the Star Organization could lose heavily or end up in a catastrophe!

Based on the intel he had collected, he believed that there was a great chance that a legendary battle pet warrior was backing the store!

Xie Gange remembered what the President told him. He would have to concede if he found evidence of a legendary battle pet warrior’s presence!

It wasn’t disgraceful to lose to a legend!

“The first option?”

It seemed that Su Ping was not surprised that Xie Gange would mention this. “I have shamed the Star Organization in public during the Elite League and you still had the confidence to come here alone. Now, do you have the answer you so eagerly wanted to know?” Su Ping said, teasingly. Xie Gange turned pale. He had not realized that the young man had already seen through him.

Was this indeed a young man in his twenties?

“I have been reckless. Please forgive me.” Xie Gange put on a smile and apologized without delay. His respectful attitude was his answer to Su Ping’s question. Were it not for the blade that was still pointed at his forehead, Xie Gange would have moved and shaken Su Ping’s hands.

Su Ping was glad that Xie Gange was able to read the room, so he told the Little Skeleton to put down its blade. “Let’s revisit the first option then.”

Su Ping and the Little Skeleton turned around and walked out of the test room.

As Su Ping stepped over, Venerable the Blade felt stressed out. The only other person that had given him this feeling was Yuan Tianchen.

“Your battle pet...”

Venerable the Blade hesitated but eventually decided to ask Su Ping. But the former was evidently more careful than before. “Is it at the legendary rank?”

Su Ping had sat down on the couch. He took out two ice creams and gave an ice-cream cone to Venerable the Blade. “No.” Su Ping shook his head.

Su Ping didn’t say that the Little Skeleton was merely at the seventh rank. After running the store for a while, he had gained a fundamental understanding of people’s psychological enduring capacity. If he said the facts as they were to Venerable the Blade, the latter would merely take that as a joke. So, he decided against it.

As he had expected, Venerable the Blade smiled an awkward but polite smile.

It wasn’t the legendary rank?

Are you kidding me? He had only felt that overwhelming sense from legendary battle pet warriors. Besides, this wasn’t the first time he had found evidence of a legendary battle pet warrior in the store. The mysterious girl with the golden hair was more of a freak. Even Yuan Tianchen had lost within one move!

Venerable the Blade grabbed the ice-cream cone. He had already had one but he didn’t mind having another one. As a matter of fact, he appeared to be enjoying himself.

“Last time I came to teach your skeleton, its skill wasn’t so...”

Venerable the Blade licked his ice cream and asked Su Ping. What he had just witnessed had left a mark on his heart. He couldn’t forget it even if he wanted to.

Venerable the Blade was obsessed with sabers and swords and even more so with the skills. He was itchy to have a deeper understanding of the Little Skeleton’s move. Su Ping darted him a look. “Do you want to learn it? I can let the Little Skeleton teach you.” In the old days, when the Little Skeleton had yet to master any saber skill, there were many things that Venerable the Blade could have taught it. However, ever since the Little Skeleton went to the Demigod Burial where the True Gods and Celestial Gods would train it, the Little Skeleton had been progressing by leaps and bounds. It had even picked up a legendary-rank saber skill but had only scratched the surface thus far.

Otherwise, just then, the Little Skeleton would have inflicted greater harm, not merely having cut off Xie Gange’s arm. The Little Skeleton would have wiped him away!

“Eh...”

Venerable the Blade was seized with a troubling feeling

His former student would become his teacher?

The marvelous move once again popped into his mind. After a moment of hesitation, Venerable the Blade nodded. “Sure!”

Su Ping was surprised that Venerable the Blade would agree. After all, it wouldn’t reflect well on him, to learn skills from a battle pet.

Not everyone had such courage.

On the other hand, Su Ping would have done the same thing

Strength was everything! That was the truth he had learned after experiencing death time after time. A person would only enjoy fame after having the necessary strength to live!

“Fine. I will find the time.”

Su Ping nodded. He thought highly of this Brother Leng. Not every battle pet warrior at the peak of the titled rank could be this humble. Brother Leng sure had a promising future.

Venerable the Blade was glad that Su Ping had agreed.

At the same time, the other elders and Xie Gange had returned.

Looking at the two sitting on the couch, the elders couldn’t help but feel nervous and awed.

What a rewarding trip!

They had seen a legendary-ranked battle pet!

Of the entire Subcontinent District, few people would have the courage to displease someone like Su Ping!

After all, the ones more powerful than him would only be the legendary battle pet warriors!

The two elders of the Liu Family turned ghastly pale and they couldn’t stop their legs from shaking.

They shouldn’t have such weak legs, given their cultivation levels, but they couldn’t help but shake uncontrollably.
