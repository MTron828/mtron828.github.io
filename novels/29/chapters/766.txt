Chapter 768: Arrival

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

One of the TV channels was broadcasting the news. A young anchorman said casually, “Coming next, a shocking piece of news just in...

“According to our channel’s reporters, there were altogether ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons with such aptitude. Yes, ten of them!

“...All of them were sold by a shop named Pixie Pet Store. I believe you’re as curious as me, dear viewers. Has there ever been a shop this lavish?

“This man here is the store owner...

“As for business hours, it sometimes opens in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon...”

The entire Kamp Continent became chaotic after the news was reported!

Finding one pet with Class A aptitude was already rare enough, not to mention the popular Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons, Rhea’s ideal pets!

Selling ten of them at once for no more than one billion each almost sounded like fake news!

Nobody would have believed this story if it hadn’t been presented by an authoritative news source. Everyone would have laughed, thinking it was something concocted by some troll.

“Pixie Pet Store? Never heard of it!”

“When did such a super pet shop appear? Has another corporation entered the market?”

“Don’t bother with that. Oh my god... Ten Class A Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were sold on the cheap! No wonder the boss was so arrogant, declaring to open at random business hours!”

“This shop is definitely peculiar among all the pet shops!”

“Are you fools or what? This must be a marketing strategy of the shop. How could anyone sell Class A Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons for only four hundred million?”

“You’re the fool here. If it really is a marketing strategy, why didn’t he sell them for slightly lower than the market price, so that people like you wouldn’t suspect? Even if he sold the dragons to the actors he hired, he did have ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons that were publicly assessed to have Class A aptitude. Can you do that?”

“Where’s the shop? I think it’s somewhere close!”

“The trolls are here! This is obviously a scam. Are you kidding? Ten Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons with Class A aptitudes were sold for only several hundred million? Why does the shop even exist? This marketing strategy will surely backfire, unless they sell all the other pets at the same cheap price!”

“I already have two Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons. Just wanted you to know...”

...

People of the Kamp Continent discussed heatedly on the Internet. Some believed the news, and some thought it was an obvious scam. Many people chose to be cautious and wait some more.

However, the reckless ones among them had already left for Woffett that evening.

Some of the rational guys pondered over the available information, then decided to go and find out the truth with their own eyes.

The night fell.

The glowing neon lights on the buildings and the streets revived the whole city, making it even livelier than in daytime!

Above their heads was a clear starry sky, and on the streets was the splendid nightlife. The beautiful girls that could hardly be seen during the day were all roaming at night.

There was an already long queue outside of Su Ping’s shop.

That mediocre business street had instantly become the most famous in Woffett City, with several times more traffic than before.

Customers were everywhere. The revenues of every shop on that street had doubled.

Since it was currently under the spotlight, Su Ping’s shop had attracted the most customers.

“Why are they waiting in line?”

“Hey, didn’t you read the news? The rules of this shop have been listed on the Internet.”

“If you want to buy pets, you bond with the pets on the spot and buy them in person. You can’t give them away easily. And, no matter who you are, you have to wait in line. I heard that the boss even declined an offer in the tens of billions.”

“Really? That’s so unbelievable. Why would any businessman refuse money?”

“Who knows? We’ll find out by tomorrow if it’s true. So many people are waiting in line here. They can’t be all wrong.”

“You’re right.”

Cleo—who was at the front of the line—heard the discussions and became gloomy. She was exactly the person who had offered tens of billions.

Little did she expect that she would act as foil to make Su Ping’s shop stand out.

She became even angrier.

“Damn it, what’s going on here?”

Outside the shop—a brawny man arrived with a few lackeys, only to be shocked when he saw what was going on outside of Su Ping’s shop.

He was none other than the man whom Joanna had thrown out of the shop on their first day of business. He was scared of Joanna’s strength back then so he went looking for his friends. He didn’t not expect to see such pomp and hubbub after he returned.

All the people who were waiting in line outside of Su Ping’s shop was an already sobering sight.

“Is this the shop?”

A purple-haired young man’s expression showed a slight change; he was feeling some pressure because of the shop’s popularity.

Most of the customers in line were Ocean State warriors, but there were also some Void State experts. Those people were already enough to drown them.

“Nobody was here earlier in the day. What happened?” The brawny man was rather stunned.

“Who cares! This shop has to be closed tonight!”

“Damn right! He doesn’t know who’s in charge of this street!”

The few men who went there to make trouble were shouting arrogant remarks.

Even if there are many customers, so what? Would they stand up for the shop owner if he’s asked to close down?

The purple-haired young man stood at the center of the group and frowned in silence. He noticed that something was off.

Some of the customers in the line were quite strong; a few of them had even reached the Fate State.

There was also a familiar face at the front of the line; that woman was from the Ryan family. She wasn’t from the main branch, but she was talented and respected. She would have been given much more resources if she were from the main branch, and she could have made greater achievements!

“Let’s go.”

The purple-haired young man thought for a moment and decided to take action. In any case, he couldn’t easily let go of someone who had offended his lackey.

When the purple-haired young man and his lackeys went straight to the shop’s door, many people in the line shouted.

“Hey, hey. Who are you? Line cutting isn’t allowed, ok?”

“Yes! Go to the end of the line!”

The purple-haired young man ignored them and spoke to the brawny man, “Go knock the door.”

The brawny man then tried to smash the door, but the door wouldn’t budge, although his fist was strong enough to bend iron.

His expression changed as he tried again, while exerting even more strength.

Still, the second attempt was still unsuccessful. The door remained intact and solid, as if it were made of the hardest stone.

His expression changed once again; he knew the shop was protected, but he didn’t know that the protection would be that good. He immediately shouted aloud, “Open the door! Open the door!”

There was no response.

The people waiting in line watched them coldly; they wanted to see if the boss would come out because of the shouting. If he did, they could immediately enter the shop.

As for the people who were yelling, they had to go back to the line again. Nobody wanted to lose their spot.

The brawny man was quite angry. He shouted several times, but still, no response. His face was hot when he felt like a thousand eyes were fixed upon him. He cursed while feeling embarrassment and furious.

Still, nobody reacted even after he cursed for a long time.

Many people started to wonder if the shop was empty.

Was the boss somewhere else at that moment?

However, someone saw that the boss had returned to the shop; he had not gone out since then.

The brawny man walked back to where the purple-haired young man was and said with a contorted expression, “Damn it, the guy is pretending to be deaf.”

The young lord frowned with flashing eyes and considered the situation. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was exactly at that moment when the whole street became silent all of a sudden; there was a bloodcurdling aura, one that felt like a flood or a horde of beasts coming from afar, enshrouding the street.

Everybody looked up, only to see that the source of the horrifying aura was not one person but three!

Three strangers were flying over from a certain point in the horizon; their silhouettes grew as they were getting closer!
