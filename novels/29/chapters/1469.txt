Chapter 1470 Consolidation (1)

More than half of the 108 Dao Glyphs had been fused thus far.

The remaining half were still drawn to each other.

Su Ping looked at them, but didn’t make use of those glyphs. He would ruin their synergy if he removed any.

He wanted to find out what power he would obtain when all 108 Dao Glyphs were combined.

His intuition told him he could become an Ancestral God!

However, that was not the shortcut he was expecting

I need pieces of the Great Dao…

Su Ping opened his eyes. That was the Chief Elder’s universe, and the Great Dao had already been consolidated. There were no pieces of Great Dao; he had to look elsewhere.

Su Ping concealed the Dao of Fire in his body and said goodbye to the Chief Elder.

“Have you found the answer you were looking for?” asked the Chief Elder.

Su Ping nodded. “I have a theory. I need to run some tests.” “Oh?”

The Chief Elder was rather curious. “What’s your method?”

“To train the Great Dao,” said Su Ping. “Train… the Great Dao?”

The Chief Elder was stunned. Even though he was knowledgeable, he did not understand what the young man said.

Su Ping didn’t know yet whether or not his theory was right, so he didn’t explain. He wouldn’t mind teaching the method to others who had helped him, but only after his theory was fully confirmed.

After all, the great thing about knowledge was that you wouldn’t lose it if you shared it with someone else.

However, there were countless cases where disciples betrayed their masters after learning all the knowledge.

Su Ping didn’t care about such things. There was only one thought in his heart, maybe because he was young and arrogant: he could always create more trump cards.

Su Ping met Diqiong after leaving the Golden Crow elders.

Diqiong had already reached the peak of the Celestial State and was halfway into the Dao Heart State. She was emanating an exuberant and scorching aura. The ancestral bloodline had given her the great power of the Golden Crows, which came from the ultimate Great Dao. She could easily become an Ancestral God by activating the power in her blood.

It was the same for Su Ping, who had the bloodline of the Primitive Chaos Clan. He could become a half-Ancestral God, too, if he activated the power in his blood and combined the 108 Dao Glyphs.

“I heard that you practiced with the Chief Elder, did you?”

Diqiong suspiciously looked at Su Ping, who had just left the Chief Elder’s residence. It’s only been a short while… This guy is already strong enough to fight the Chief Elder?

She didn’t quite believe it. However, Su Ping had been growing so fast she had to go there and take a look for herself.

“Why are you so informed?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He looked at the Golden Crow guards around the Chief Elder, wondering which of them had snitched.

“Humph. I’m the princess; I have subordinates everywhere. Nothing is a secret to me,” she said with a snort.

“Impressive.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Cut the crap. Judging by your aura, you obviously haven’t broken through yet. You’re no match for the Chief Elder, at all. Why did you spar with him?” asked Diqiong with a frown.

“Can’t I just witness the Chief Elder’s power?” Su Ping smiled and waved a hand. “There’s something I have to do. Talk to you later.”

“You’re so rude. You’re even unwilling to call me Your Highness before you leave!” said Diqiong angrily. Su Ping rolled his eyes and said, “Have you watched ‘The Godfather’ recently?”

“Yes, so what? Speaking of which, are there sequels?” asked Diqiong.

“I’ll bring them to you next time,” said Su Ping.

“That’s more like it.” Diqiong didn’t pester him any longer.

Su Ping felt helpless when dealing with her. He then left the Golden Crow settlement and entered the wilderness. There was basically no scent of other beasts within a ten thousand kilometer radius.

Su Ping went further and finally found some unusual beasts.

Those animals carried the bloodlines of ancient mythical creatures and boasted the power of chaos. They could crush both divine and demonic beasts at their level. They were very strong. Even the geniuses among gods had to lower their heads in front of such beasts.

That was the formidable nature of ancient mythical bloodlines.

Su Ping soon encountered a mythical creature in the Celestial State lurking in the desert. The simplest hunter often appeared as prey. The beast attacked when Su Ping passed by, only to be killed the next moment.

Su Ping tore the mythical creature apart and threw it to his pets, as the meat contained a lot of nutrition.

He also used the opportunity to take the Great Dao inside the beast’s body and have his universe absorb it. Then, exactly as he did in the Chief Elder’s universe, he established a contract with the Dao of Fire and transmitted the power of the broken Dao pieces through the contract.

The temperature around Su Ping rose to an unbearable extent as the power of the broken pieces was transmitted. The place began to twist and even melt, even though it was highly resistant to heat.

“It’s truly effective!”

Su Ping was pleasantly surprised. He found that the power of the broken Dao pieces could be absorbed by the Dao of Fire. The features of the Great Dao were removed and only the purest Dao power would remain. The Dao of Fire absorbed it and became stronger, reaching a whole new level, beyond the formerly attained perfection.

An idea occurred to him. If the Dao of Fire reaches the maximum, I wonder if it’ll be more powerful than the Golden Crows’ fire…

He soon thought of another possibility. The Golden Crows had possibly cultivated the Dao of Fire to the maximum.

Only the Golden Crow ancestor could answer that question.

Su Ping dismissed those irrelevant thoughts and focused on controlling the Dao of Fire to absorb it.
