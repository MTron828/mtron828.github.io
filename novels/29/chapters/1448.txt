Chapter 1449 Sneak In (1)

Su Ping picked that advanced cultivation site and intended to visit their Ancestral Gods.

He paid the ticket fee and experienced the familiar transfer to the site. When he opened his eyes again—he found himself underneath a green sky.

The sky was like a piece of glass or a green lake. The clouds were thin and the sun was

bright.

Below was a prosperous city.

The city was full of metal structures and seemed to be highly futuristic, with a wild, splendid architectural style. Some buildings were like enormous wine cups, while some of the others resembled airships.

Su Ping spread his senses and soon noticed how the sky was extremely vast; even he was unable to sense its borders. It was clear that the world underneath such a green dome was no smaller than the Archean Divinity.

“One, two, three…”

Su Ping could vaguely sense that many auras were hiding in the buildings, all of God Emperor level but extremely feeble. It was as if they were cautiously holding back.

God Emperors usually weren’t that cautious, unless they were battling.

However, there was only prosperity, based on what everyone could see. There were no signs of war.

This must be a place in the new universe. I should go ask someone.

Su Ping concealed his aura and reached a square where gray-blue skinned people were walking around. He morphed into one of them to blend in.

It was very easy for him to change his body

structure.

Aside from the core bloodline inside his body, any other part was just like that of a real native, including the blood that circulated underneath his skin.

At the square-a slender, gray-blue woman was walking about. Unlike human beings, the natives didn’t have any hair. Even though they looked bald in comparison, their heads akin to water drops carried a strange sense of beauty.

All of a sudden, that gray-blue woman disappeared.

In another layer of time and space, still in the square, Su Ping laid a hand on the woman’s forehead. Her skin was cold, metallic and smooth; there was a scorching soul underneath her skin.

Su Ping sank into her consciousness and searched for information.

He quickly figured out where he was.

The city where he landed was named Azi, which was a middle-sized machine city in the world underneath the green sky.

The planet was called Green Glass World. According to the woman’s memories, the planet was as boundless as a universe, with countless machine cities.

Hundreds of duchies had been established, and above said duchies were the

Hyper-energy Gods.

The Hyper-energy Gods had a superior status; they could even decide the fate of a duchy.

Su Ping delved into the woman’s memories and saw her entire life, starting from birth. To his surprise, she had already lived for three hundred years, and she had just reached adulthood according to her civilization’s standards.

Fetus… Glass Pool… Knowledge Irrigation… Her civilization was entirely different from that of humankind, being evidently more advanced.

All the gray-blue natives were born in an enormous, machine-like womb. Once the babies were born from what appeared to be a

huge pool of amniotic fluid, they would be delivered to a place called the Glass Pool; there they would live for three years until their bodies were capable of walking, running and eating. After that, their parents would fetch them and go home.

Knowledge collection would come next.

They didn’t go to school to acquire knowledge. Instead, they would pay some money to create a connecting port on their bodies, which they would use when going to the Hall of Knowledge, plugging a data cable to said port.

Knowledge would be transferred directly. They went there every ten days, while having

to pay each time. The first five years were free and mandatory; they would acquire the basic knowledge of their people. Anything after that point there was knowledge that had to be paid. The woman that Su Ping kidnapped was from a rich family, one that supported their members with fifty years’ worth of studies. She was a senior engineer among her people and had a well paid job. She also knew some ancient combat techniques, which were something that only nobles had access to. Still, it was in fact no different from arranging flowers or making coffee.

The gray-blue people usually fought with hot weapons; that woman carried three of them. She was strong enough to hunt Ocean State

beasts.

The elites of this society are generally in the Ocean State. Back in the Federation, even the elite members of some big families would be hard pressed to reach this standard… Su Ping’s eyes glittered. As expected of an advanced cultivation site supervised by Ancestral Gods. They were strong in general; they even had expensive weapons able to fold time and space.

Weapons of such functionality would give their users Star State combat ability when 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

equipped.

Aside from technology, the Source Energy they cultivate depends on their talent. Is that the real method for them to rise to the ultimate level of cultivation? Su Ping thought. The gray-blue people were not short of knowledge, but they lacked inspiration and creativity. Knowledge was easily accessible by paying money; however, creative minds were

rare.

Su Ping perceived something right then, so he decided to send the gray-blue woman back to the square. She didn’t feel a thing while being in that solidified time and space; her only

perception was of falling into a trance while

in the square. She had no idea she had been kidnapped by an “alien”.

“Come out. I didn’t mean to offend you,” Su

Ping said toward the void.

A moment of silence passed, then a figure walked out. He was a brawny gray-blue man who stared at Su Ping coldly. “You’re not a local. Where are you from?”

“I come from another universe.” Su Ping’s aura had been exposed since the teleportation.

It came as no surprise that someone had tracked him down. He said with candor, “It’s a place beyond your sky. My hometown was attacked, so we came here to seek help.” Their communication was conducted via telepathy; it facilitated the understanding of what Su Ping meant by universe. “Beyond the sky?”

The gray-blue native changed his expression and became even colder. “Everything beyond

the green glass is a monster. How bold of you to invade!”

“I’m afraid there’s a misunderstanding,”

Su

Ping quickly reacted and said, “There’s a vast world beyond your green glass, where all kinds of races and civilizations exist. The

monsters you mentioned may well be enemies we have in common. We too see them as monsters… They destroyed our home, and

that’s why we’re here.”

The local expert gazed at Su Ping; his deep-blue eyes seemed to be scanning Su Ping’s body. After a long while the man said, “Better not do anything rash. I will report the matter to the Selvegas; it’ll be up to them to decide.”

While dazed, Su Ping asked, “Are you a

Hyper-energy God?”

“Looks like you stole some intelligence about my people.” The gray-blue man was colder still, but he didn’t attack; Su Ping’s aura was too powerful. Besides, he was unwilling to recklessly go ballistic against an unknown civilization.

Su Ping then noticed that a few others were approaching, traversing the void. Their auras were well-hidden; all of them were God Emperors.

He wasn’t worried. He was calm as he simply said, “Why don’t all of you come out? I’m not here to fight. I hope that there’s a chance for us to communicate peacefully.”

“We’re not crazy about war either,” said the cold expert keeping watch on him, but he was secretly alarmed. The foreigner wasn’t a simple fellow, since he was able to discover his partners who were approaching in secret. “Is the Selvega you mentioned your highest leader?” asked Su Ping.

“Goddess Selvega is our mother. She is omnipotent and omniscient!” declared the gray-blue man proudly. That was also a warning.

While his expression remained casual, Su Ping nodded and said, “How long will it take for her to come here?”

Exactly at that moment—an indifferent and distant female voice was heard. “Foreigner, show us your original appearance.”
