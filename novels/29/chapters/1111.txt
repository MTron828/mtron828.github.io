Chapter 1113 Kill!

Qing Hongyue gritted her teeth and demanded, “Lin Xiu, have you cultivated 100,000 years just to become the saints’ puppet?”

Although a girl, she didn’t seem at all weak; her eyes were filled with fury at that moment.

“Indeed. You’ll be a pathetic puppet, even if you get the Celestial legacy. It’s better to be a top Heavenly Lord to traverse the universe than to be a puppet!” shouted one of them, a Heavenly Lord who had grasped a perfect path. Apart from the Star Lords who were still determined to fight, someone else was already moving at the edge.

“Run!”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A few Star Lords sprinted, trying to break free and quit the competition right then and there.

Claiming the key would only improve their odds of getting the legacy; obtaining wasn’t certain. They would be better off taking the trial’s second test than to take their chances there.

Lin Xiu ignored Qing Hongyue. He sneered as he looked at the fleeing Star Lords, then rolled the sword plate in his hand. Screams instantly burst out.

Countless sword auras were darting in space; they were perfect laws’ auras, sharp and indestructible.

Each of the sword auras were like full-strength strikes with a perfect path.

Some of the Star Lords wanted to leap to another point in time; some wanted to escape to a deeper space, while others took different routes; still, all were forced to come out.

The sword auras could cut all laws apart, completely blocking the area.

“As I said, all of you must die!” Lin Xiu glanced at the injured people, then simply looked down at Su Ping again. “I’m going to get rid of them after I kill you. You go first.”

The latter was solemn and grave as he stared at the purple saber the former was holding.

Both Qing Hongyue and Calivey approached Su Ping. Claudia, wounded at the moment, was carried and then place near to Su Ping too. She glanced at Qing Hongyue, as if too ashamed to talk to her.

Qing Hongyue noticed her embarrassment, then said, “I would’ve done the same if I were in your shoes. No need to feel guilty.”

Claudia’s lips twitched; she was naturally conscious of that. Qing Hongyue should have reacted angrily after being abandoned, but she was actually comforting her at the moment. After taking a deep breath, she said in a low voice, “He has my two ultimate treasures. Adding the purple saber, he has at least three ultimate treasures.”

“What are the traits of your ultimate treasures?” asked Su Ping in a low voice.

Claudia spoke truthfully in a low voice, “One of them is an offensive ultimate treasure able to confine all laws and paths in a fixed range, all to temporarily lower your opponents’ cultivation, until it regressed to that of an average Star Lord. “The other aspects are both ambush and attack. It can hide your aura and create a clone of you; it would be just as strong as you.”

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

If Lin Xiu could use the purple saber, he could probably use Claudia’s two ultimate treasures too.

In that case…

The Lin Xiu before him could be a clone made by the ultimate treasure!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and looked around.

Claudia and Qing Hongyue realized the same thing, and felt even gloomier; they thought that their survival odds were even slimmer. Lin Xiu was like a lurking viper, and they were right in his nest; they would have to beat the former to escape.

“Is there anything we can do?” asked Qing Hongyue telepathically.

Brian also moved closer.

Those who had grasped perfect paths began to gather around Su Ping; they knew that their only chance to escape was to work together. “I need you to keep his allies busy and find his real self; he may be lurking right now,” said Su Ping telepathically.

“That’s easy. The others can take care of it; you won’t have any advantages if you fight him alone. Let’s all fight him together!” declared Qing Hongyue aggressively, unwilling to let Su Ping take the most dangerous responsibility alone.

It wasn’t because she considered Su Ping a friend, but because she thought it was for the best.

The situation was so unfavorable she didn’t want to lose more allies.

Both Calivey and Brian looked at each other, then nodded. “Indeed. Even if he has ultimate treasures, we still may have a chance of winning if we stick together.” “Count me in,” said Claudia and gnashed her teeth. She was badly wounded, on the verge of dying, but she had great healing medicines in her storage that were rare even in the scope of the entire universe. Her condition was already stable, and she was capable of fighting.

That showcased the abundance of a top Star Lord.

“Lin Xiu is yours then; the rest of us will deal with his allies and search for his real self. We’ll also try our best to cover you!” said a middle-aged subordinate.

All the top Star Lords who had grasped perfect laws nodded decisively.

They were still fighting one another a while before, but they had to team up now if they wanted to survive.

After all, even the saints were involved in the plot. There was no way Lin Xiu would let any of them live. It was nonnegotiable!

“Are you done conspiring?”

Lin Xiu remained calm, not caring about their discussion the least bit.

Once he heard that, Su Ping raised his head and said, “Not yet, please wait a moment. Don’t be hasty.”

A veing pulsed on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Qing Hongyue and the others couldn’t help but glance at Su Ping, who had dead set on getting a rise out of Lin Xiu, an expert that had cultivated for 100,000 years; he truly was a genius in that regard.

They knew that Su Ping was trying to enrage his opponent.

Once a person got angry, they would be prone to making mistakes.

Even though people as experienced wouldn’t let anger get the better of them, but they could still be affected.

Lin Xiu had at least declared that he would kill Su Ping first, which wasn’t the most rational decision.

Given the current circumstances, it would be more sensible to start by eliminating the unimportant people first and then turn to the stronger ones.

“Die now!”

Lin Xiu was quite gloomy. His suppressed fury surged once he saw that Su Ping was still talking without care in the world; he launched a deadly attack.

An unparalleled aura was instantly manifested by his body, and his purple blade was set ablaze. However, there was a ripple on the surface of the flames that was cutting the void apart with a strange property. He held his blade as he charged at Su Ping.

Su Ping, Qing Hongyue and the others were prepared for it; they quickly dispersed. Qing Hongyue roared as flames enshrouded her body. Her phoenix feather arose; a golden small world appeared behind her.

There seemed to be a magnificent tree inside the small world.

Qing Hongyue spouted fierce flames and activated her constitution again. A loud phoenix cry echoed throughout the sky; the flames seemed about to drown everything.

“Get lost!”

Lin Xiu snorted and waved his saber. The edge of his saber instantly sliced the void open, rendering the restraints of Claudia and Brian useless. All of Qing Hongyue’s laws and paths collapsed like iron threads under axe attacks.

Qing Hongyue was heavily wounded after her laws and paths collapsed. Once the saber made contact, she noticed that her own saber was blocked and she felt like suffocating.

Intimidating!

He was more intimidating than she had expected!

“Dodge!”

Exactly at that moment—someone pulled her away and helped her dodge the saber.

Qing Hongyue saw that Su Ping was the one who went to help her. Still, Lin Xiu attacked again at a high speed, before she had the chance to thank her savior. The enemy was aiming for Su Ping’s back.

Exactly at that moment-a furious scream burst out. “Turn!!”

Claudia took action. Wounds receded and started to disappear from her fair body, as she had overdrafted her constitution; she had just wiped off the blood when it surged once again from her nose, mouth and eyes. She had broken free from Lin Xiu exactly with the technique of time.

This time, she used it again to rescue Su Ping and Qing Hongyue.

Space and time seemed to have been reversed. Everything was paused when the saber’s edge touched Su Ping. The next moment, both Su Ping and Qing Hongyue disappeared from the place the saber had reached; they were relocated dozens of meters away.

Claudia vomited blood and staggered, falling to her knees.

“His ultimate treasure is too powerful!”

Brian was trying to help too, but his perfect path of time had been cut apart by the aura radiated by the blade’s edge, even before it reached Su Ping. On the other hand, Claudia’s help had been effective.

“As expected of the Queen of Time. She’s truly good.” Lin Xiu glanced at Claudia who was exhausted and vomiting blood, knowing she couldn’t possibly perform the secret technique again, unless she wanted to get herself killed.

He sneered and continued his charge to attack Su Ping with his saber.

“You have a sharp tongue, but can you possibly resist my saber attack, honed for 100,000 years?” Brutality was emitted from Lin Xiu’s eyes. Su Ping had angered him immensely. “Just run!”

Qing Hongyue tried to push Su Ping away as he saw Lin Xiu move closer. She looked awful, but she was stubborn and unyielding.

She despised Lin Xiu’s behavior; a top Star Lord willing to bend before others. The saints had offered him a formidable treasure that would ensure success in his search for the legacy; they must have made rigorous demands

–

After all, nobody was better at scheming than the saints of the Federation.

Qing Hongyue pushed Su Ping away, while letting out a high-pitched shriek that belonged to an extinct ancient phoenix.

Furious flames covered her body. It wasn’t a normal fire, as it was being fueled by the vitality and energy inside her. She suddenly flapped her wings and flew out like a ball of flames.

“Stupid!”

Lin Xiu snorted and turned his saber, where purple flames began to rise. The Ascendant State power and laws instantly sliced the void and the phoenix image! Just like a fallen tree, Qing Hongyue was flung back and she coughed out a lot of blood; the flames covering her quickly faded away. “Rot in hell!”

Lin Xiu charged at Su Ping again, ignoring Qing Hongyue who was already dying. Little Skeleton…

Su Ping rose. A tiny skeleton appeared next to his feet, then leaned against his leg. They quickly melded a moment after.

Su Ping was instantly covered in bones. The Little Skeleton never flinched, no matter what kind of danger it was facing.
