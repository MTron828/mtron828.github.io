Chapter 1371 Slaying the Heavens (1)

Something unexpected happened in the fortress, as seen in the projection.

The void fell apart, and countless arms began to spread out like algae in the deep sea. They were large in number and looked ghastly. They were coming out from deeper spaces, reaching out for the worms as if being controlled.

“Huh?”

The other people noticed the change on the battlefield too. Such a turn of events was rather surprising.

“What the hell is that?”

“It seems to be helping us, though!” “It seems to be… a body!”

The Celestials spread out their senses toward the battlefield. Although their vision wasn’t as clear as Su Ping’s, they could see something, more or less. It was a terrifying aura, like a storm from the abyss. They felt like leaves on the ocean in front of such an aura, which could be overturned at any minute.

“Ancient corpses…”

Su Ping had already realized the nature of those arms. They were actually an amalgamation of ancient corpses. There were no signs of vitality, only a strong obsession driving them, even after death!

Roar!

All of a sudden-a deafening roar sounded throughout the entire universe.

The roar was extremely abrupt. It wasn’t part of the projection; it traveled throughout the planet like a super light.

......

All the streets and buildings were trembling. The roar echoed in everybody’s heads, making their blood flow faster.

A few seconds later, screams were heard, bursting out all over the place. On the streets

-people were holding their heads on the ground. Some even had blood in their ears and eyes; they couldn’t stand the terrifying willpower carried by the roar.

Some even fell to their knees, sticking their heads to the ground as if wanting to bury them in the soil.

“Damn it!”

Everybody sensed the collective misery on the planet and their faces contorted. The roar originated from somewhere several defense lines away, and had been weakened by the divine arrays protecting the planet. Even so, it was still tremendously powerful. Is this the power of a universe dominator?

“It’s here.”

Su Ping gazed at the projection. By means of the Original Dao World, he had already sensed the source of the roar; the alien hiding among the worms couldn’t hold back anymore and revealed its aura.

Then, the worms became a mess and collapsed at the center. A figure with a strange body structure slowly stood up. Its skin was dark blue, but it was more like a combination of skin and shell, unlike a simple shell would be. There was a deep Dao Pattern mark on that skin structure.

When Su Ping saw the arm, he instantly realized that the alien was the entity that fought the War Emperor’s body outside the crack in the universe.

Is it… one of the Heavens?

Su Ping looked in a daze.

In terms of appearance, the guy looked very similar to a human being.

However, unlike humans, there seemed to be a lot of insect-like tissues making its body. The skin on its neck was tough, like the abdomen of an insect. Its arms were pointed, and the chest seemed to be made of some sort of organs, but already hardened like armor.

The appearance alone could have frightened a lot of people.

Su Ping had seen many kinds of ferocious creatures in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, but never one as creepy as that one. His back was cold and sweat began to drip.

It had been years since he was that fearful. It was like some genetic response activated in his body, making him tremble instinctively.

“W-What’s that?” a Celestial asked, but his voice was hoarse.

Su Ping looked at them, only to find they were pale as sheets, as if they had just seen a ghost.

“Maybe it’s one of the legendary Heavens…” Su Ping wore a complicated expression. The Heavens were supreme. Even some of them were villains, like the ones found among gods, yet they were a rare and noble species in general.

To think the guy would look like that…

On the battlefield-all the arms seemed to have found the target after the alien showed up, and quickly reached for it. Meanwhile, more and more torn bodies were crawling out of deeper spaces. “You’re already dead. Do not reveal yourselves again.” The alien stood among the worms, cold and aggressive. “I buried you back then; I can do that again right now!”

As it talked, it suddenly waved its arms and invoked a wheel of light in the void.

What shocked Su Ping was that, although the wheel seemed to be a weapon, it was actually a series of interconnected small universes. It was a terrifying sight.

Multiple universes? No, wait…

Su Ping could tell that those universes were similar, with only minor differences. If they were multiple universes, they would have been condensed from different Dao Hearts.

However, there is just one universe that contains everything. Even if you’re capable of creating two universes, it’s unnecessary. It’s better to just melt the two universes to make them more powerful… Su Ping looked at the strange wheel of light, sensing some sort of terrifying aura that chilled him to the bone, even though he was multiple defense lines away.

He’s just a God Emperor. But he’s much stronger than the gods who reached the God Emperor realm!”

If he hadn’t seen his fair share of God Emperors and even Ancestral Gods, he would have thought that the alien was an Ancestral God.

However, even though the guy’s aura was terrifying, it was still within the limits of God Emperors. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“System, is that one of the Heavens that the Golden Crow ancestor has been hiding from?” Su Ping asked in his heart, trying to confirm.

However, he wasn’t really hopeful. The system would always prefer for him to search for answers on his own. It rarely answered, except when he asked about pets.

“Yes.”

Su Ping received an answer after a long silence.

“Seriously?”

Su Ping was stunned, eyes slightly narrowed. Although he had already made his own speculations, he was still shocked when it was confirmed. That is one of the Heavens?

“That’s the ancestral skill of the Heavens, the Wheel of Judgment!”

The system’s voice was calm and cold. “It’s made of a power unique to the Heavens. That is also the reason why the Heavens are able to crush other lives on the same cultivation realm.”

Su Ping was surprised, since the system had given him such a detailed explanation. He immediately asked, “What about the corpses? They seem to have been God Emperors when they were alive. Are they being controlled? By the wisdom of our universe?”

After another long silence, the system said, “The wisdom of the universe wouldn’t control them. It’s just a lingering obsession in their bodies.”

“What obsession?”

“Slay the heavens!”

Su Ping felt dazed.

Slay the heavens?

He immediately remembered what the Golden Crow ancestor said, and the war that once broke out in the Archean Divinity; the Heavens were behind all of that. Those who had died never forgot their mission, even after their vitality and consciousness had perished; however, their remains were still stimulated by the aura of the Heavens and became crazy.

What exactly happened? Why are the Heavens so hated? Su Ping thought.

A great battle burst out at the defense line. The alien and the corpses from deeper spaces were fighting in a different time and space, disappearing from everyone’s sight. However, they could tell that a tide was rising in the deep spaces nearby, and it might surge out at any moment.
