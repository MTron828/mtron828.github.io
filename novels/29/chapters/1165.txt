Chapter 1167: Slaying Emperor Ye

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Su Ping collided with Emperor Ye intensely while in the void, their bodies shattering and reforming again and again. Neither was able to kill the other easily.

Damn it, this kid is learning from me!

Emperor Ye’s expression soured even more. Although Su Ping’s energy had been mostly worn out in such a war of attrition, he was becoming increasingly skillful, learning about his opponent’s usage of laws, thus making fiercer attacks.

I won’t be able to kill him in two hours if things go on like this!

Emperor Ye was infuriated.?When have I ever been pushed to such an extent by a Celestial God?

“No more tricks?”

Su Ping forced Emperor Ye to retreat with one strike, to then fuse the power of the Fist of Exorcist into his arm, then slashing with his sword. It was an extremely powerful move.

That was one of the combination skills he had figured out over those days.

Fighting against Emperor Ye had been a rewarding experience. He knew he had been strengthened after cultivating four small worlds, but he didn’t know his limits. That battle had allowed him to exceed his limits and learn many more things.

“Shut up!”

Emperor Ye was grim, unwilling to waste time talking to that human. He kept attacking, thinking about how to finish Su Ping off.

However, even a knowledgeable God Emperor like himself was clueless at the moment.

He had seen many more things than Su Ping had, but he didn’t have many cards. Besides, Su Ping wasn’t a fool; he had abundant battle experience as a Star Lord.

The Rain Emperor watched in silence, not expecting Emperor Ye to be caught in such an impasse, which was embarrassing.

However, the situation wouldn’t have been that different had he fought Su Ping instead. After all, Emperor Ye’s performance was already remarkable when dealing with the Celestial God brat.

Still, he was unable to kill Su Ping easily.

The brat’s four small worlds were unbelievably powerful.

“Emperor Ye, there’s no time to waste,” said the Rain Emperor to Emperor Ye via telepathy.

Emperor Ye was angry and frustrated; however, he also knew that even beings on par with Celestials could tell that the battle would last longer than two hours. Both parties were very strong; neither of them could kill the other.

He could have dealt with Su Ping with a single strike if the latter only had three small worlds; however, the revelation of a fourth small world balanced them again. Su Ping even seemed to be slightly stronger. Emperor Ye would have lost if he wasn’t as seasoned in battle.

I will vent this fury by killing all those bloody humans today!

Emperor Ye angrily swore to himself. His clone paused, then glowed like a scorching sun the next moment.

The five small worlds behind him also became brilliant and dazzling.

“Oh no. He’s going to detonate his small worlds!”

“Damn it, is Emperor Ye really that shameless? Trying to die together with his opponent for the sake of victory?”

“…This human has pushed Emperor Ye to such an extent?”

The experts on the human’s side were shocked and infuriated. The Rain Clan gods were just as astonished, not expecting that Emperor Ye would be unable to kill that human within the two-hour limit.

The man was just a Celestial God, and yet he was able to fight against a God Emperor’s clone on equal terms…

Many members of the Rain Clan had conflicting feelings.

Nobody underestimated that annoying human from that point onwards. His talent and power left them in awe, even though he was their enemy.

Never did they think that high-ranked gods would be intimidated by a lesser being from one of their vassal races.

“You want to die with me?”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes as he noticed what Emperor Ye was up to. He didn’t panic, even though both parties would die if one of them blew themselves up.

Death would be certain. That is, unless one of them was significantly stronger than the other!

If Emperor Ye chose to blow himself up, Su Ping would probably be unable to resist.

Luckily, I’ve been prepared for this. At first I thought I would have a hard time fighting a God Emperor’s clone for two hours, but I overestimated him. It won’t be humiliating to die by self explosion!?Su Ping thought.

The four small worlds behind his back dazzled as brilliantly as Emperor Ye’s.

Everyone witnessing the fight was dumbfounded by his resolution.

“Has he completely lost his mind? He’s going to die together with Emperor Ye’s clone?”

“Even though he’s a human being, I have to admit that his talent is unparalleled. Unfortunately, his arrogance is just as unparalleled. He was bound to die young!”

“It will be his honor to die together with Emperor Y’s clone. After all, only one God Emperor is born in a million years!”

Everybody had mixed feelings. Some of the Rain Clan gods still loathed Su Ping, while others felt sorry for his demise.

They simply grieved over the loss of such a talent, even though he was from a different race.”Search our n?wn0?el.?rg” The sentiment was similar to them appreciating a brilliant shooting star or a beautiful flower that would be gone in a moment.

In the midst of the violent and abundant energy—Emperor Ye calmed down and gazed at Su Ping. “Brat, you have my admiration; unfortunately, you’ll be completely obliterated, without a chance of being reborn. You’ll never come back to this world again.”

All his killing intent and fury had left his eyes because the outcome had already been settled. He only felt a slight regret that such a genius hadn’t been born in the Rain Clan; otherwise, if properly groomed, he could someday become another Ancestral God!

“Nothing is certain. It’s still hard to say who will die!” replied Su Ping.

His eyes were cold; his sword aura more dazzling than ever. At that moment he suddenly attained a deeper understanding of the Sky Execution Technique.

“When I slay the sky, the earth and the gods, I’m just slaying the weakness and fear in my heart. I’ll be unstoppable and fearless if I’m determined and focused!

“I won’t turn back even if I’m about to be shattered to pieces!” Su Ping mumbled, then took a deep breath. The sword he was holding glowed brilliantly; his four small worlds fell apart in an instant. Just like glass eggshells, turning into an indescribable and terrifying power that caused a storm in the world.

Eventually—the storm was concentrated on the sword he held.

The last strike!

“Bring it on!”

Ruthlessness appeared in Emperor Ye’s eyes too. He felt excited; it had been a long time since he had enjoyed a battle after becoming an emperor.

The two terrifying storms collided in the void like a thousand exploding suns ready to destroy the world.

Nuclear explosions were as gentle as candles in the presence of such power.

The destructive power was swept across the void. The golden-robed elder raised a hand, and a streak of golden light arose from outside of the void to cover the place and protect his juniors.

Such a terrifying power was as vulnerable as a baby before a Celestial, and was resisted with ease.

“It’s over…”

The scorching energy made it impossible for many to keep their eyes open. However, experts such as the Rain Emperor were staring at the center of that destructive blast, where the result had already been decided.

Emperor Ye had won. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Su Ping’s body had been completely destroyed.

The time and space around him had fallen into pieces like glass; it was impossible for him to resurrect in a different time and space.

On the other side—a forest with divine trees was shaking due to the blast, seemingly about to fade away, but still existed.

That was the strange phenomena caused when Emperor Ye’s constitution was fully activated.

Such an effect was still visible, which meant that Emperor Ye was still alive!

Once they saw that, the human contingent was aggrieved, their faces looking awful, not expecting that such an exceptional genius would be killed, just like that!

“Damn it!”

The feather-crowned senior clenched his fist. He had even had the urge of breaching the pact and taking Su Ping away; however, the Rain Emperor seemed to have noticed his intentions and had focused his attention on him, ready to suppress him if he were to do anything.

Once the energy settled and faded, the illusory woods were revealed to everybody. The Rain Clan gods were dazed for a moment, and then all exclaimed in joy!

“Emperor Ye’s clone is still alive!”

“Emperor Ye won! He blew up five small worlds and survived! Heavens!”

“Unbelievable! No wonder Emperor Ye chose to blow up his small worlds. He wasn’t trying to die together with that brat. It was just his battle strategy!”

“Just like I said, how could Emperor Ye blow himself up just to die together with a mere human? The outcome would have been questionable.”

The clan’s gods were thrilled and greatly relieved.

They had forgotten their initial nonplussed attitude, when they thought that it would be easy for Emperor Ye to kill Su Ping.

Exactly at that moment—one of the trees of that mysterious forest fell apart. Then, Emperor Ye’s clone was revealed, coming out of the collapsed tree.

His clone looked pale and enfeebled; however, he turned from illusory to real as he staggered out of the woods.

It was like him walking out from a dream state, back to reality.

“That’s the Rain Clan’s Chaos Divine Rain Constitution. What a great life saving method!”

“It’s said that our ancestors once lived in that mysterious forest. What kind of place was that, to endow them with such bloodline and power?”

“Amazing place! Amazing constitution!”

The feather-crowned human and the others were shocked, thinking that the emperor would only survive as a soul remnant. However, the guy came back to life thanks to the unusual phenomena caused by his constitution, exceeding their understanding of constitutions.

“Prepare to catch those humans who trespassed our territory. Kill whoever resists!”

The Rain Emperor’s voice, cold and intimidating, resounded and dragged everybody back to reality. The clan’s gods looked at the feather-crowned human with anger.

The human leader had a slight change of expression. He said, “I’ve just contacted the Dragon Tamers. They’re on their way; try to hold up.”

The Dragon Tamers were also high-ranked gods in the Archean Divinity, and were counted as allies to humanity. They were quite close.

Emperor Ye sneered and waved a hand. “Kill them all!”

A solemn and brutal vibe was instantly swept out.

“Wait!” interjected a lone shout all of a sudden. The world with surging undercurrents seemed to have been paused.

Everyone immediately fixed their eyes upon a certain part in the void.

There, a man was standing proudly; none other than Su Ping!

Everybody fell into a daze after a quick glance.

The Rain Emperor, Emperor Ye and the feather-crowned human were wide-eyed, unable to process this.

Being emperors, they wouldn’t have lost their cool even if an earthquake were to happen. However, they couldn’t control their expressions at that moment; they stared at Su Ping as if he were a ghost.

Alive?

He is still alive?

How is that possible?

Emperor Ye’s eyes widened like bronze balls. He was stunned for a long time, before he finally asked, “Why didn’t you die?”

“Because your attack wasn’t powerful, of course,” replied Su Ping matter of factly.

His voice, attitude and all other signals were informing everyone that he was very much alive; he wasn’t just an illusion.

Emperor Ye was dazed; the Rain Emperor also lost his cool, but he soon turned grim-faced.

“We’re close to the two-hour mark. I’m still alive. So, I believe that your defeat is certain,” said Su Ping with a casual tone, “Also, you blew up your five small worlds, which cannot be restored by any laws. However, I’m different…”

Small worlds blossomed behind him like lotus flowers while he spoke; one after the other, just as brilliant as before. They were the four small worlds!

There wasn’t the slightest crack on them; they were just as perfect as before!

Emperor Ye was astounded by what he saw. Everyone’s jaws almost reached the ground. They were overwhelmed with disbelief.

The whole thing was beyond their understanding.

Could small worlds be restored after being blown up?

Did Su Ping merely blow up their projections, not the small worlds themselves?

However, many people had been watching. It was clear that his small worlds had exploded!

Projections wouldn’t have been as powerful, and they would have been crushed by Emperor Ye.

“Rot in hell!”

With his four small worlds in full force, Su Ping charged at Emperor Ye almost as fast as a flash movement.

His sword aura was launched again, just as brilliant and scorching as before. However, Emperor Ye’s clone was much weaker than before, having lost its five small worlds, and was killed instantly.

Emperor Ye’s clone was completely obliterated by the attack, which was enhanced by all the laws and the small worlds combined.

“It is you who failed to endure for two hours.” The sword in Su Ping’s hand was gone, disappearing into the void. He indifferently looked at Emperor Ye’s original self. “Will you still honor your promise?”
