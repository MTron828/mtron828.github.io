Chapter 153 Renowned

Right behind Zhang Baoxing was another famous student who had recently made a name on the academy’s battle power ranking list, Lu Pengfei. He was able to garner all that glory mostly thanks to the training sessions he regularly bought in Su Ping’s shop.

As for the rest of the customers... Su Ping did know them, but he couldn’t remember every name. There were just too many students from the academy who kept coming.

“You look wonderful today, professor!”

“Sir, are you truly a titled battle warrior??”

Apparently, all those students had watched him defeat a veteran teacher from the Berserking Blade Academy earlier that day, and they all looked thrilled.

Being such a young advanced teacher was impressive enough. Nobody thought that Su Ping was that strong.

His exploits had made clear why Su Ping was so highly regarded by the academy. As a titled battle pet warrior, he could be elected as the next vice principal if he wished to!

“Ahem. I’m not there yet, I just used a small trick back there. By the way, which pet are you getting trained today?”

Although people were clearly more concerned with the first part of his response.

“You’re not titled??” Zhang Baoxing yelled. “But how come? You can fly!” “Yeah, we all saw it!”

“What kind of small trick, professor?”

“Teach us! Come on!”

Su Ping waved a hand impatiently. “That’s not something you can learn. This is a pet shop. Get on with it if you want me to train your pets.” “You’re not joking, right?? Then which rank are you at, sir?”

“I’ve never heard of any tricks that could make you fly for real!”

Su Ping showed a stern look. “Keep wasting time and I’ll have to increase my prices. Is that what you want?”

That got people under control easily. Within seconds, they quieted down and made an orderly line in front of the counter.

Heh. The wonders of money. Su Ping took out his account book and began his work.

“Erm, sir, do you have to write my name every time?” Zhang Baoxing showed a timid smile. “I basically come everyday.”

“Well, I don’t want to miss your payment, do

I?!

“Oh, heh heh...” Zhang Baoxing quickly took out his phone and paid.

The price was fine as long as the quality of the training service was fulfilled. However, having gone there so many times had emptied Zhang Baoxing’s wallet. That day would be his last visit before he was able to get more money.

Damn it. I need to be quick. They say you can earn cash and train in barren areas, so I should try that out...

Zhang Baoxing had always been an average and insignificant student at the academy, until he received Su Ping’s service and climbed all the way to the top 20 on the academy’s ranking list.

The only problem was that he only had his Pyro Canine as his main pet, which could be easily countered if his opponents knew how. Otherwise, he was confident that he’d reach the top 10.

The Pyro Canine saw Su Ping and its bright eyes darkened in despair. It obediently moved to the back of the shop, head lowered.

Su Ping ignored the dog and addressed the next customer, Lu Pengfei.

“Hey, hey, professor. Are you going to teach us about something other than Undead pets?” Lu Pengfei asked passionately.

“Hm. Perhaps.”

Lu Pengfei suddenly grew sad as he remembered that graduation was near. By that point, graduates like him would either have a safe and boring life inside the base city, or they could gamble for wealth and fortune in the barren areas.

Settlers in barren areas would not have the chance to visit the city often. In other words, he would be unable to visit Su Ping’s shop like he used to.

After registering the last customer, Su Ping took all the pets into the pet room and threw them inside the Nursing Space. When he returned to the counter, he saw that a part of the customers remained behind, probably because they wanted to chat with him.

He had defeated an Abyss Snake when everyone was watching. Even if he said that he wasn’t a titled battle pet warrior, people weren’t going to take his words seriously.

However, nobody could find the time for small talk as more people soon came rushing into the shop.

“It’s really him! It’s Professor Su!”

“This is his shop??”

Many of them were visiting for the first time, after finding out the address through friends who had also watched the match.

“Sir!”

“Good day, sir!”

Men and women of various sizes and colors blocked the shop’s door. Seeing that surge of new customers, Lu Pengfei and some of the others still loitering decided to leave, to avoid affecting his business.

Su Ping sighed when he saw the crowd slowly getting out of control.

“Get in line, get in line! I only provide pet training for the moment. If you didn’t come for that, give your place to someone else.” The students did as told, though this wouldn’t prevent them from asking several good old questions out loud. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Are you really a titled battle pet warrior, sir?”

“What is that skeleton?? What is its exact species?”

“Do you have a gf yet?” Su Ping simply ignored the first two questions. The third one was worth considering, since it was asked by someone with a rather sweet voice. But he gave up after looking among all the people without finding the speaker. He didn’t want to accidentally encourage several eager women who looked too big to his liking. “Training a middle-rank pet is... 100,000??” the man at the front of the queue called out in disbelief after hearing Su Ping’s price.

He went there to “join in the fun.” Spending some money was fine, but not such an amount.

Not all students of the Phoenix Peak Academy were rich. To an average family, such a number was an important matter they had to discuss first.

When Su Ping confirmed the price for a second time, the man dropped his friendly smile as he felt humiliated. In his view, not even a titled battle pet warrior would swindle customers like this.

This guy’s exploiting his name to make dirty money, isn’t he??

“Get a move on!” a waiting customer protested, “The price’s fine to me. Or do you think Mister Su needs to trick you?”

“Yeah! Move it already if you ain’t paying.”

The man apologized with an irritated look and stepped aside. He did respect Su Ping after watching that fight, but he was in no condition to cough out 100,000 without talking to his family first.

Several regular customers in the queue sneered at him.

That guy’s gonna regret it really hard, after learning the true value of Mister Su’s training

To them, seeing Su Ping become so famous was bad news, because they would have to compete against more and more people for a spot at the shop at this rate. That was why they didn’t mind clearing up the misunderstanding about the true worth of Su Ping’s services to any new customers. Instead, they would gladly see them be scared away.

Without knowing what his clients were thinking about, Su Ping registered their names at a steady pace. However, the line was not getting shorter in the least. More and more students from the academy were joining it and making it uncomfortably longer.

“My goodness...” Lan Lele and Su Yanying shook their heads as they saw how many more people were behind them.

Just like most people, they went to visit Su Ping as soon as they saw what he did to their rival, only to get stuck in this large group unfit for such a small shop. At this rate, they would soon block the entrances of the other shops along the street.
