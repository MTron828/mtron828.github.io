Chapter 1506: Sorcerer Ancestor’s Universe (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Break a hundred universes?”

Su Ping’s expression changed a bit. Such a task would equate to increasing his strength a hundred fold!

Considering Undying State experts, even the tiniest improvement would require ten thousand years of consolidation. Epiphanies were insignificant from that point onwards.

Furthermore, time was no longer relevant.

Ten thousand years was just a measuring unit. Making progress in ten thousand years was worth celebrating.

No wonder the guy who sent the telepathic message sounded crazy. He probably was beyond desperate.

“Let me try again!”

Su Ping gathered his strength again. This time, he was going to use a contract with the power of that world.

He was soon able to perceive a vague consciousness of the land as the Contract Dao Heart began to spread. It wasn’t a weak entity, but they seemed to be infinitely far apart.

However, if he could feel it, he could link to it.

The next moment, he made contact with that consciousness. The vague and weak feeling instantly became clear. However, it responded by flooding towards him with fury.

Boom! Su Ping’s mind trembled and collapsed, almost falling apart completely. However, the mental shards managed to gather once more in the end.

It refused me?!

Su Ping was shocked and infuriated. His contract was rejected; the sentience of that world was unwilling to help.

It dawned on him.?Damn it, this is the Dragon Prison. That consciousness probably belongs to Sorcerer Ancestor Yuan Long!?He was regretful and angry. That was the first time making contact with the Sorcerer Ancestor; he could have died if not for his willpower having long exceeded the normal Undying State.

He knows I’m from the Primitive Chaos Clan and yet he still tried to kill me; this Sorcerer Ancestor is not easy to deal with. He doesn’t show any respect for the people of the Primitive Chaos Clan. But then again, the Primitive Chaos Clan’s Sorcerer Ancestor is already dead. He doesn’t have to give us any face anymore…

Su Ping gritted his teeth. It was impossible to break free with the power of his fire universe alone.

Could it be that he could only return to his store? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Or maybe, should he kill himself and leave by resurrecting in a random place?

But that was the Sorcerer Ancestor’s universe. Could he leave this place through random resurrection?

Su Ping silently asked the system in his heart.

“Nope,” the system quickly replied, “The range of random resurrection is limited. Ancestor Yuan Long’s Dragon Prison contains thousands of universes; it’s more than ten times larger than the Archean Divinity. You cannot possibly reach its boundary however many times you resurrect. The center and the border of this world change places all the time. It’s impossible for you to escape.”

“Ten times bigger than the Archean Divinity?”

Su Ping was dumbfounded.

This is just a universe that Sorcerer Ancestor Yuan Long established, and it’s more than ten times bigger than the Archean Divinity?

It had to be noted that Su Ping would need a whole day to traverse the whole Archean Divinity. There were many dangerous places that even he wouldn’t dare enter recklessly.

This is the power of a Sorcerer Ancestor? No wonder it’s an inborn power that can’t be cultivated. The combination of thousands of universes…?For the first time, Su Ping realized the gap between Sorcerer Ancestors and Undying State experts.

That explained the existence of only twelve Sorcerer Ancestors in history.

There had been countless geniuses since the beginning of time. Ancestral Gods were at the top, but there were a hundred of them in the Archean Divinity, and more than ten thousand in all of the system’s cultivation sites!

However, only twelve Sorcerer Ancestors had ever existed!

“So, in other words, I can only return to the store and come back again?” asked Su Ping.

The system said, “That’s the only way, unless you can instantly break a hundred universes on your own.”

Su Ping took a deep breath and said, “Let me give it a try then!”

“?” The system slowly popped a question mark in Su Ping’s head.

“I’ve already paid a hundred million energy points to visit this site; I can’t just go back like this. I came to this cultivation site to train. I was never desperate when I entered the Chaotic Realm of the Undead as a mere mortal, and I certainly won’t act desperate now!” Su Ping then started cultivating in earnest.

However, there was no Great Dao or energy on the Dragon Prison’s floor. It was impossible to cultivate.

“Hahaha. How did it go? Given up already? Like I said, it’s impossible. You’re from the Primitive Chaos Clan, right? Pray that your ancestor comes to save you. Hahaha…” The loud voice laughed hysterically.

Su Ping calmed down and asked, “Which clan are you from?”

“Me? I’m from the Haotian Clan, the strongest of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors’ clans!” declared the loud voice proudly.

Su Ping asked, “Is Haotian one of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors too? Why didn’t your Ancestor save you? And why were you imprisoned in the first place?”

“My ancestor loves sleeping; he’ll come to my rescue once he wakes up. We will surely kill the Original Dragons’ ancestor when the time comes!” The loud voice sneered. “I just hooked up with a few Original Dragons. Speaking of which, they seduced me first; I should be the one demanding an explanation from them!”

“…” Su Ping didn’t expect such a reason. He asked with a weird expression, “Do they also have strict rules for that?”

The loud voice suddenly chuckled and said, “Why, do you want to try it out as well? You should if you have a chance when we get out. I’m sure you won’t forget the taste. Dragon liver, in particular, is the most delicious of all; you’ll never forget the taste!”

Dazed, Su Ping asked, “Oh, you mean you eat them?”

“Of course. Isn’t it normal to eat them after having enough fun with them?” said the loud voice.

“…”

Su Ping was lost for words. He suddenly realized he was judging the guy according to a human lifestyle. Morals didn’t matter to those mythical creatures; they had their own code of conduct.

For instance, Original Dragons sentenced his pets to death just because they didn’t kneel. That was their own code of conduct.

It was ridiculous for humans. However, human morals were probably just as ridiculous to them.

“What about you? Why were you imprisoned here?” asked the Haotian expert.

“Maybe because I’m too handsome,” said Su Ping.

He had no patience to explain because he thought it was ridiculous, so he offered an equally hilarious reply.

“I think you’re quite ugly,” said the Haotian fellow.

Su Ping rolled his eyes and replied, “Just because of that I won’t take you away after I break out from this place!”

“Hahaha, you want to escape? Come on. Show me how it’s done!” The Undying State guy started laughing.

Su Ping preferred not to waste time on the fellow. He simply sat cross-legged and cultivated.

Another voice was heard; it was gentle and soothing, “Brother from the Primitive Chaos Clan, ignore that lunatic. Not only did he eat Original Dragons, he also committed felonies in his own clan; that’s why his Sorcerer Ancestor will never bail him out. He will be eternally caged here… He will never age or die, and he’ll be tortured forever.”

Su Ping raised his brows and asked, “Who are you?”

“I am Yan Tai from the Heixiang Clan. Have you heard about us before?” asked the voice.

“Nope.”

“Our clans once fought side by side. Come here, stay away from that lunatic. Sometimes he snaps and wrecks havoc; you don’t want to get injured by him,” said Yan Tai.

Su Ping frowned a bit. He wanted to cultivate, and would rather not be disturbed.

“Okay.”

Su Ping instantly flew toward the source of the voice.

The Haotian Clan fellow noticed Su Ping’s movement and quickly said, “Hey, why are you going that way? That’s a guy from the Heixiang Clan. They love eating people of their level.”

“Huh?”

Su Ping paused.

“Don’t listen to his nonsense. He lost his mind a long time ago,” said Yan Tai gently.

The former stayed where he was, then stared at the gentle guy, who was also blurry; he obviously was fixated to the spot like the guy from the Haotian Clan. Su Ping shook his head and said, “Thank you for your kindness. I’ll just stay here. It’s good to keep some distance from both of you.”

“If you believe his crap, don’t blame me for not having warned you when you suffer,” said Yan Tai with a sigh.

Su Ping stayed silent.

The gentle guy didn’t send more telepathic messages.

“Didn’t you say you were going to break out from this place? Show me!” The Haotian fellow shouted earnestly, seeing that Su Ping had sat down.

Su Ping frowned and set up a barrier around him, blocking the guy’s noises. Then, he focused his consciousness upon himself.

At first he wasn’t planning on walking the Primitive Chaos Clan’s path. However, his current cultivation method wouldn’t be bound by the Great Dao of the Primitive Chaos Clan. His plan was to completely fuse the 108 Dao Glyphs in his body.

That was the advantage of the bloodline heritage left by the Sorcerer Ancestor.

Just by fusing and combining Dao Glyphs would enable him to enter the Undying State and become only second to Sorcerer Ancestors!

However, no matter how strong the Undying State experts were, they were absolutely vulnerable when facing the ultimate experts!
