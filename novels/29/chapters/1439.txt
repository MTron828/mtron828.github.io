Chapter 1440 Merging of All Pets (2)

There were dragon horns on his forehead. The Dark Dragon Hound’s wolf head was attached to his shoulder. On his back were the wings of the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon.

The different features of his pets had grown on his body, fusing with him.

That indescribable, magnificent power filled Su Ping’s body and made him shiver. He felt as if he could tear apart the world with one hand and control that universe!

“We did it!”

Su Ping was rather surprised and excited. He was also touched in a way; it was their very first attempt and he didn’t even go into the details. And yet, they succeeded!

At first he thought he would need a few more attempts to achieve it. Even if an accident happened and his body exploded, he had to make it work; that was the only chance for him to join the battle.

However, it worked with his first attempt. The process was really fast and smooth!

Echo of minds!

Su Ping could feel the minds of his pets. All their thoughts were in his heart, none of it could be concealed. They had completely given themselves to him!

It was an unreserved trust!

“Thank you…” Su Ping said to himself in silence.

The pets felt Su Ping’s thoughts. The Dark Dragon Hound grinned and said, “Boss, what are you talking about? We always belong together!”

“That’s right.” The Inferno Dragon’s voice rumbled like thunder.

Su Ping smiled. No other words were uttered, as they would fall short when trying to describe what he felt. He clenched his fists and sensed the power flowing inside his body. A moment later, he said, “We’re ready to go!”

“Let’s go!”

“Our enemy is outnumbered. They should fear

US!”

“So what if they’re Ancestral Gods? Boss will surely surpass them when he becomes an Ancestral God!”

All the pets were excited and ready to fight, as a result of their minds echoing. Their feelings influenced each other; their fighting will was soaring Su Ping stepped up, sweeping his violent aura. He used the contract to connect to the surrounding universe, only to discover that it contained the Chaos Perception Dragon’s will. Besides, the power of that universe was constantly being sent by the Chaos Perception Dragon into the battle. If he drew from it, he would only be competing with his ally over that power.

Su Ping didn’t compete with the dragon senior, as it would only weaken the latter. He extended his power beyond that universe.

He discovered that he could break out of the Chaos Perception Dragon’s universe on his own while in that state.

That could also be because all the dragon’s power was concentrated on the battle, and it didn’t try to stop him.

Su Ping instantly contracted the outer world when his senses stretched beyond the dragon’s universe. The power of the world surged into his body nonstop through the contract.

30,000 kilometers! 50,000 kilometers!

Su Ping approached his previous limit in the blink of an eye. However, he then felt that it was as easy as lifting an arm. He was far from reaching his limits!

I can control more now!

Su Ping’s eyes were glittering. He extended his power influence, soon absorbing the power within a 100,000 kilometer radius. A furious fire was burning inside Su Ping’s body.

He didn’t stop.

120,000 kilometers, 150,000 kilometers, 200,000 kilometers!

He didn’t hit the limit until he reached all the way to a 230,000 kilometer range. By then his body was already like a golden ocean, emitting an unparalleled divine power.

The power was emitting such massive waves that both parties on the battlefield noticed it and turned to look at him.

“What’s that brat doing?”

The five Ancestral Gods were rather astonished. Su Ping’s aura was definitely not something that a God King could have. It even exceeded that of the God Emperors they knew.

The Chaos Perception Dragon’s could sense it better; after all, everything was happening in the creature’s universe. Astonishment surfaced in his eyes. For the first time, he stared at that junior solemnly. He carried the same ancient bloodline of the chaos clan, but his talent was beyond extraordinary.

He suddenly felt at ease with the thought of letting the boy care for the young Chaos Beast.

Boom!

The void was trembling and Su Ping walked to the battlefield in flames.

In the space battlefield where two giant beasts were fighting, Su Ping approached like an ancient giant. The auras from his movement caused ripples in the universe.

“Come on!!”

Su Ping fiercely drew his sword and slashed at the enemy.

The sword aura swept across half of the universe and illuminated the silent darkness, hitting the behemoth made by the godly array powered by the five Ancestral Gods. The power was so great that all five of them shivered!

“What?!”

They were appalled; all of them looked at the young man as if he were a ghost.

A mere God King is making us shake? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

That’s a power close to the Ancestral God level!

“It’s effective!” Su Ping was delighted by the result. This meant that he had the qualifications to intervene; even if he couldn’t hurt them, he could at least distract them.

If his attacks could be directly ignored, that would only mean that he would end up crushed like an ant even if he attacked using his full strength.

Roar!

Noticing their weakness, the Chaos Perception Dragon quickly pushed forward with its only horn, wounding the five-god behemoth. Many Dao Patterns were destroyed.

The five Ancestral Gods were shaking in their boots. They quickly fixed the array.

“Damn it. Let’s get this over with so that this brat doesn’t ruin our business!” said one of the Ancestral Gods. He was shocked and furious, feeling that the strange God King could be an unknown factor.

“Reverberation of the universe. Stop holding back and show your true skills!” said the charming Ancestral Goddess.

None of them hesitated as they quickly summoned their power. Five Undying Universes appeared and connected to form a giant blade, which slashed at the Chaos Perception Dragon.

“I’ll block it!” Su Ping roared.

He realized how terrifying the strike was. The Chaos Perception Dragon could survive it, but the damage would be considerable. He, on the other hand, was different. He could resurrect.

Su Ping stomped and charged forth like a fiery meteor, taking the attack on behalf of the dragon.

Su Ping instantly felt that an insurmountable power had bashed him, just like being hit by a train. His body fell like a kite without a string; all his bones and power fell apart.

All kinds of traits and power disrupted his body and eliminated his consciousness. Many kinds of illusions surfaced before his death. He lingered for decades in some illusions, while briefly staying in some others. However, it was but an instant in reality. The aftershock of the attack was swept out. The Chaos Perception Dragon roared and made it collapse. After Su Ping’s body weakened the blow, the remaining power was no longer a threat. He was prepared to get hurt with that strike, not expecting Su Ping to step in and block it for him.

“Roar!!”

The dragon’s eyes were bloodshot. A brutality hidden for countless years surged out; he gave a deafening roar as he charged at the five Ancestral Gods.

“Damn it!”

The gods looked awful and angry; Su Ping’s daring move was not in their calculations.

They condensed their strength once again to face the dragon rushing toward them. Soon, they were clashing fiercely, causing dents and tremors everywhere in the universe.

While the two parties clashed, Su Ping’s body was condensed in the void. He resurrected yet again.

Right after coming back to life, he saw the ongoing fight and immediately summoned his pets to fuse with them again.

The second attempt was just as successful. There were no accidents.

Su Ping contracted the power of the outer world again and soon became a giant of flames like before. He was enveloped in overflowing power that could no longer be contained in his body.

“Damn it!”

“He truly doesn’t die?!”

The five Ancestral Gods noticed the powerful aura in the distance. The three Ancestral Gods who saw this happen for the first time finally lost their cool. Both the Rain Ancestor and the Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God looked awful; the thing they dreaded most had indeed happened.

If Su Ping could keep resurrecting with such a terrifying power, he would definitely be a huge distraction in their battle.
