Chapter 1296 Go Together (1)

“Okay, who’s next?”

The big-headed child looked at the seven remaining candidates and asked, “Who’s willing to fight next?”

They exchanged looks. One of them-a tall fellow with an elephant-head-stepped out. He was the prince of the Divine Elephant Clan, one of the high-ranked.

It was said that the Divine Elephant Clan carried part of the ‘Ying’, an ancient mythical creature. Any adult member of the clan was able to uproot a mountain with ease.

No one else competed for the turn as he stepped up; none of them bore personal grudges against Su Ping, and neither had an urge to fight him right away. They wouldn’t have to fight if Su Ping lost; there would still be a chance for them to take action if he did win.

“Okay, go.”

The big-headed child nodded.

The barrier covering the battlefield opened, and the genius of the Divine Elephant Clan landed gracefully.

Su Ping remained expressionless as he looked at his opponent, feeling the concealed, vast aura in him. Right when the battle was about to begin-he suddenly raised his head and looked at the five elders.

“Can I make a request?”

The big-head child raised his eyebrows, given how Su Ping always had something to say every time a battle was about to begin. While holding back his anger, he asked, “What is it? Rests are not allowed; challenges are continuous. I actually had you return to your prime state, which makes things fair; they’re not fighting you in turns.”

“I know.”

Su Ping nodded. “I wanted to ask whether or not I could challenge a few of them at the same time.”

The audience became as silent as the dead.

All eyes were looking at Su Ping in shock; they couldn’t believe their ears.

What the heck?

Challenge a few of them at the same time?

We’ve seen arrogant people, but none as arrogant at this one…

Is he truly one of the ever docile and obedient humans?

The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan became gloomy. He had no grudges against Su Ping, and merely volunteered because he was interested in that human. Such a request was like a slap in the face for him. Is this man looking down on me?

“What’s the meaning of this?”

The genius of the Divine Elephant Clan was gold.

The big-headed child asked with a strange expression, “You want to challenge many of them at the same time? Tell me, how many are we talking about?”

Su Ping’s request was surprising, which also piqued their curiosity. A dedicated genius like Su Ping was definitely not a brainless moron; he surely knew what he was doing.

“There are seven left. Let’s split them into a group of four and a group of three.” Su Ping looked at them and decided to be safe; challenging seven in one go could be risky.

“You…”

The candidates’ faces changed. They were infuriated by the proposal.

Tan Xiangyun’s expression also changed a bit. She was exasperated. In all the years since had been in the Heaven Path Institute, a place where geniuses gathered, she had never seen anyone be that arrogant!

You’re free to act smug however you wish, but does it have to be here too?

Even the princes had to keep a low profile in the Heaven Path Institute, even though they were veritable geniuses in the outside world.

“Are you challenging the dignity of the Divine Elephant Clan?” The Elephant Clan genius was thoroughly enraged. He was surrounded by terrifying flames, ready to teach Su Ping a lesson.

Su Ping looked at him and said, “Sorry, nothing personal. I’m just pressed for time and hope I can get this over with as soon as possible. This challenge is taking too long; I’d rather spend my time cultivating.”

“You…”

The elephant-headed opponent was confused by Su Ping’s sincere attitude. The attitude was indeed arrogant, but his tone was extremely genuine. Why does it feel so weird?

“Are you sure?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The big-headed child looked at Su Ping while his face showed great interest, as if eager for drama. It’s the young human who proposed the challenge anyway. Even an ordinary adult had to back his words, not to mention that he was a talent. If he failed to overcome the challenge, he would have to wait for the next opportunity.

The waiting could take a long time.

“I am sure.”

Su Ping nodded.

“This little fella…”

The rest of the elders were shocked by Su Ping’s boldness, not sure if he was brave, arrogant, or just confident.

But displaying confidence had to go hand in hand with carrying out what the challenger declared. Anything else would be pure arrogance.

“None of the humans we know talk like that, do they?”

“He has Ancestral God’s potential. He’ll surely become a Dao Child someday; I can understand where his pride comes from.”

“Still, challenging a couple of candidates is too much; they may not be Dao Children, but the gap between them isn’t that wide!”

The elders chatted amongst themselves nonstop, while keeping outward silence as they watched. The decision was made by Su Ping, and he had to be responsible for what he said.

It seemed that they weren’t teaching adult, independent geniuses, but toddlers that constantly required their guidance and reminders.

The youngish looking elder felt rather helpless. Su Ping’s arrogance exceeded his expectations too. The human who once saved him-as well as the other humans he had met over the years—were nothing like that.

“If that is your wish, so be it. Let’s gather a group of three for now. Which two of you are willing to join in the challenge?” asked the big-headed child.

Everybody looked at each other in bewilderment, not expecting this to happen.
