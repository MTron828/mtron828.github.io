“What’s going on?”

The Primordial Empyrean Master was stunned and anxious. The Fortune Bell was never wrong. That could only mean that some sort of danger had indeed approached him, but it somehow disappeared.

Was the danger… from this continent?

Did someone plan a sneak attack?

The old expert thought of Chi Ying, Xu Kong and the other dominators. He could truly be in danger if they joined hands to attack him.

!!

He solemnly gazed at the Fortune Bell. While pondering, the bell glittered and rang again, indicating a bad omen.

“Again?”

The Empyrean Master was slightly nervous. He stepped out of his temple and observed the situation.

There was no sign of Chi Ying or anyone else outside the barrier, but the bell’s ring was becoming increasingly louder, which meant that danger was approaching.

“Damn it!”

The old man looked awful. He found nothing, but the Fortune Bell was never wrong.

“The danger isn’t close by? Or are they escaping detection in some way? Or maybe…”

The Primordial Empyrean Master narrowed his eyes and looked up at the green sky.

He quickly changed his expression and rushed to the temple in the center of the continent.

He quickly arrived, finding Shen Huang as well as two more Celestials.

He knew that Shen Huang was the acting commander; even Chi Ying and the other dominators had to listen to him.

Just as he saw them, he shouted, “Hurry up and inform Boss Su and the cyborgs. Some danger is approaching the green glass planet!”

He found that the Fortune Bell kept ringing, even though he had moved to a different location. This meant that the danger wasn’t near his temple. It wasn’t something directly targeting him, but the entire planet!

“Empyrean Master… Huh?” Shen Huang was surprised; his expression changed quickly. “Are you serious?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“My Fortune Bell is ringing!” said the old expert. He was working alongside the human settlers, and he didn’t want anything to happen to their place.

Shen Huang’s heart raced when he heard the Fortune Bell. He asked Song Yuan, his first disciple, to inform Su Ping as soon as possible. He then contacted the cyborg leaders to gather for a meeting.

Hardly had he sent the telepathic message when someone else appeared in the temple. It was Su Ping.

Having become an Ancestral God, he could easily cover the entire green glass planet with his thoughts. Although not on purpose, some of his attention had been fixed on the Primordial Empyrean Master. However, it was an inconspicuous, non-malicious monitoring, so the Fortune Bell didn’t consider him an enemy; he saw everything that the Primordial Empyrean Master did.

Therefore, Su Ping realized that something was off when the old expert rushed over to the main temple.

“There’s danger outside of the green glass planet?” Su Ping looked at the Primordial Empyrean Master.

The latter and Shen Huang were stunned, not expecting Su Ping to be as unpredictable.

“Y-Yes,” said the Primordial Empyrean Master in a hurry. His heart was trembling, as he found that the young man was even more terrifying than before. Besides, all his cells were screaming, reminding him to stay clear from that youngster. It was just like being instinctively afraid of a monster.

Su Ping’s eyes looked solemn. The Fortune Bell had even detected the danger sooner than him. It was a rare treasure that couldn’t be neglected.

He instantly waved his hands. Vortices appeared before his eyes, which led to every part of the green glass planet.

“Gather!” Su Ping said softly.

Figures instantly stepped out of the vortices, all of them astonished after seeing him. They were the three cyborg leaders, as well as the other human dominators, including Chi Ying.

A channel had been directly established to the places they were at the time. Some of them were cultivating inside the barriers they had set up, but the channel appeared out of nowhere, completely disregarding those barriers.

“Boss Su!”

The cyborg leaders narrowed their eyes after assessing the situation. They had been in their respective temples until Su Ping pulled them to the temple. Such power was beyond their imagination.

“There might be danger outside the green glass planet. I need to investigate. Leaders, are you coming with me, or do you want to wait here?” Su Ping asked the cyborg leaders.

It was their world anyway. Su Ping was respectfully taking the stance of a guest.

“Danger?”

The hearts of the cyborg trio began to race, but they didn’t question the news. Su Ping’s serious demeanor was an indicator of how critical the situation was. Basha said, “I’ll go with Boss Su. You can wait here.”

“Okay.”

Su Ping said to the other human experts, “Wait for updates here, and get ready for war!”

Everyone’s hearts shook at the mention of war, as the word was often followed by gore and bloodshed.

Su Ping covered Basha with his aura and stepped out, escaping from everyone’s perception and approaching the green glass sky.

Basha sensed that her body was covered by an immense power, clearly beyond her ability. She was helpless against it, which shocked her even more. This human leader is far stronger than me. He could easily destroy all cyborgs and claim our territory.

However, Su Ping’s attitude made her feel much more at ease.

The next moment, to Basha’s shock, Su Ping drew on the green glass with a finger. He easily made a hole, like a burning iron melting snow.
