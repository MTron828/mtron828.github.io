“How did you get in?”

Su Ping was surprised. They were still in the lesser Dao Heart State; how had they managed to reach the prison’s deepest floor?

“Boss, if you’re in danger, how can we not be by your side?” The Dark Dragon Hound grinned.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes as he inspected the fellow. All his pets were riddled in wounds; without a doubt, they had been through unimaginable battles to get there.

“Did you… get here on your own?”

The Purple Python wriggled and said, “We broke through the dragon pit and came here.” The cracked scales on its mountainous body had fallen off; there was also a corrosive power eating away its flesh.

Su Ping waved a hand to drive away the remaining Dao power afflicting them to heal their wounds.

He clenched his fist tightly as he noticed how delighted they were despite their grievous wounds.

“Boss, let’s break out of this Dragon Prison together!” said the Dark Dragon Hound. Its eyes were glittering with fighting will.

Our hero glanced at the Inferno Dragon. It had already resorted to burning its soul, and its vitality was still burning irreversibly. Fortunately, resurrecting was an option.

“It’s easy to get all the way down from the top, but it’s hard to leave once you’re here,” said Su Ping.

“No matter how difficult it is, we’ll be by your side,” said the Dark Dragon Hound.

“All right!”

Su Ping took a deep breath and walked to the Undying State fellow from the Haotian Clan. “Help me kill them; I will absorb their power. Let’s break out of the Dragon Prison… I will make the Original Dragons learn that a real dragon doesn’t have to bend to anyone!!”

Roar!!

The Inferno Dragon bellowed. Its furious and scorching eyes were like suns that pierced through everything, while its power surged and its dragon soul burned brighter. The scalding light of life was affecting the other prisoners, making all the mythical creatures feel the burn.

Roar!!

The Inferno Dragon roared again with an even louder sound, which echoed throughout the Dragon Prison. It became even bigger, along with an expanding aura.

Su Ping couldn’t help but stop and look back in surprise.

Their mutual bond allowed him to feel his pet’s determination and unparalleled pride!

After a boom, something seemed to have broken free.

The violent power erupted from the Inferno Dragon’s body; a black and red universe appeared behind its back. It seemed to have absorbed an infinite amount of power, which made it shake. Then, under everyone’s gazes, it suddenly exploded!

The exploding universe produced an endless amount of power that filled the pet dragon’s body. The dragon flew up and roared once more.

All its broken scales were quickly regenerated, and its necrotized flesh was healing at a fast pace. Even the irreversibly burning soul died out at the moment.

However, even though the dragon soul had died out, the aura emitted was even more terrifying than before.

It was like a vicious abyssal dragon awakening and looking at the human world.

The broken black-and-red universe was reconstituted and condensed in its mouth, before it was thrown toward the prison walls like a wave of light.

When the light flashed, the dark Dragon Prison seemed to be illuminated for a brief moment.

From somewhere in the invisible depths came the sound of the pet’s universe exploding. However, the power didn’t spread out; it was still absorbed by the Dragon Prison.

Su Ping looked at the Inferno Dragon in a daze, never thinking it would break the shackles and enter the Undying State in that place!

The Inferno Dragon gradually calmed down as it released the power. Its enormous body wriggled in the void, having already grown as massive as a planet, in no way inferior to the pair of chaos dragons. Its mouth seemed large enough to swallow half a planet.

Its red ironlike body emitted an infinite sense of power. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Su Ping looked up at his pet. After overcoming the initial shock, he only felt proud and happy for the Inferno Dragon.

“Seriously? This dragon carries so many bloodlines, and is still able to unify all the Great Dao?”

“There are so many different types of power. How exactly was the guy able to combine them?”

“This dragon seems to be his companion. Damn it, he’s even harder to stop now…”

All the prisoners felt puzzled and frightened. Su Ping was already tricky enough to deal with as it was, and now he had an Undying State dragon as a partner. They were all immobilized by the Dragon Prison, and were incapable of hiding. They would surely be swallowed by Su Ping, one by one.

“This guy is faster than us again,” mumbled the Dark Dragon Hound as he looked at the Inferno Dragon, but there was delight in its eyes. They had been stuck in the Dao Heart State for too long, and knew how difficult it was to break the last shackle; it was something that they could probably never achieve in the rest of their lives. Since their dragon partner had made a breakthrough, all of the pets felt happy about it.

“We must hurry to catch up,” said the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon, unwilling to give in.

“I will also unify all the Great Dao someday!” The Purple Python felt confident, as it was no longer the tiny python it used to be. Having fought many creatures with Su Ping, it had transformed completely, and had an unparalleled resolve.

After calming down, Su Ping said to the Inferno Dragon, “Try to fight by yourself. Get familiar with your current power.”

He pointed at the guy from the Haotian Clan.

The Inferno Dragon understood what he meant. It roared and charged at the fellow.

Seeing that, the Haotian guy quickly said, “Hey, hey, don’t come over. We admit defeat…”

However, the dragon didn’t care, simply releasing dragon aura and attacking.

The fight began soon after.

Su Ping was then able to see what the guy looked like. It was an enormous, oval-shaped creature with countless pairs of arms, which turned out to be sharp blades.

His body was pinned to a spot and couldn’t move freely. His only option was to fight.

He swung his arms and sent the Inferno Dragon flying. Su Ping was definitely shocked. The Haotian fellow was shockingly strong; he could probably punch a hole in the grand universe with a finger, and pierce through a couple of small universes with a single strike!

After forcing the dragon to retreat, the Haotian guy roared, “I don’t want to kill you. Stay back!”

The Inferno Dragon, however, ignored him and simply attacked in various ways.

The Haotian guy was furious. Having no time to worry about Su Ping, he quickly gathered all his arms and formed two enormous hands, which grabbed the Inferno Dragon’s wings and ripped them apart. The arms acted like sharp blades and slashed the dragon into countless pieces.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, as the fellow was indeed tough, one of the best among the Undying State experts from the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors’ clans. There was still a major gap between the Inferno Dragon and him.

However, the dragon’s body was soon reconstituted; it wouldn’t die so easily. The beast continued attacking the Haotian fellow.

“Damn it, you’re clearly not one of the Original Dragons. Why are you so tricky to deal with?” The Haotian Clan guy was angry; his body was restrained, making it hard to kill that dragon.

Once he noticed that the dragon was done testing, Su Ping immediately stepped forward.

“Let’s attack him together!”

“Hoooooooooooo!”

The Haotian fellow became anxious the moment he saw that Su Ping would also take action. He quickly said, “I admit defeat! I’ll give you the Great Dao pieces you wanted! I’ll cooperate!”

“Too late!”

Su Ping didn’t stop. He released his universe of original chaos and attacked.

The fellow was soon defeated under the coordinated attacks, then they dug out the Great Dao power from his body.

Su Ping absorbed the power as he fought. The third universe he planned to condense was the Dao of Origin, which he had perceived while being in the Federation.

The Dao of Origin grew as it absorbed the power, even though it had already been perfected.

Su Ping simply fused with the Inferno Dragon, which was the first time ever merging with an Undying State creature. A violent power instantly surged in his body; Su Ping felt as if there were another universe inside his body. The two powers fused; it wasn’t a simple multiplication, but an improvement in different aspects.

Su Ping’s body became magnificent. Tiny scales grew all over, giving him a terrifying look; he had the power to shatter the universe by simply waving a hand.

The prisoners couldn’t be more shocked. One of them shouted, “What kind of power is this? It’s impossible for Undying State beings to improve their powers like this. Impossible!”

“Fusion! That dragon sacrificed itself. It abandoned its own fate!”

“That’s so stupid. It had just advanced to the Undying State and achieved immortality!”

All those prisoners were deeply shocked, unable to conceive how an Undying State creature would be willing to abandon everything and fuse into someone else’s body.

Bang!

Su Ping threw a punch with a force of hundreds of millions of tons imbued with Dao power. The Haotian Clan fellow tried to resist with its enormous arms, but they gave out and shattered.

The fusion increased Su Ping’s power and exceeded that of the Haotian Clan fellow.

The former was quick to attack with a bloody sword he condensed. Each attack was many times more powerful than before.

The guy from the Haotian Clan had to reconstruct his body again and again. He cried miserably.

Su Ping sensed the Inferno Dragon’s universe and took a deep breath to draw power from it. Both the black-and-red universe and the chaos universe appeared behind his back, but the former was apparently much smaller, like the moon next to the earth. Su Ping could feel how his chaos universe was suppressing the others.

It would have been impossible to harness that power if not for the fusion, and the dragon controlling its own black-and-red universe.

“Break!”

Su Ping detonated the two universes at the same time. The violent powers gathered like twin stars, mutually illuminating the other, which then surged into Su Ping’s body like storms. Once the terrifying power was swept, the guy from the Haotian Clan cried in panic, “Let me go! I know I was wrong! I’m willing to give all my power to you! Stop!”

“I will spare your soul!” said Su Ping.

Then, he furiously slashed with his sword.

The Haotian fellow’s enormous body, akin to that of an ancient god, was instantly cut in two. It exploded and fell apart, and then it was turned into countless pieces by a certain power.

Su Ping instantly pulled those pieces toward him and quickly absorbed them.

His merging power allowed him to absorb faster than before.

The Undying State soul of the Haotian fellow was floating amongst the pieces. It looked at Su Ping in shock and fury, but didn’t have the courage to make a move.

Su Ping ignored the guy; he kept absorbing the Great Dao and assimilating the flesh.

Very soon, the Dao of Origin thrived, and a universe took shape.

Two weeks later, a new undying universe was born.

A superior aura emerged once the universe of origin was condensed; the fire and illusion universes, which had been pushed aside, quickly gathered around it as if having found an ally.

The three universes connected their powers under the pressure of the chaos universe.
