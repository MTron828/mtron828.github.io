Chapter 855: Making Friends

“No need to thank me. It’s no biggie.” Xingyue Shen’er smiled proudly. Then she asked curiously, “Are you going to use those materials for training?”

She was quite curious. In her eyes, Su Ping was already at the upper limit of the Fate State; it would be impossible for him to make further improvements without advancing to a higher level.

“Yes, to polish my body.”

Su Ping nodded, not being secretive about it; after all, she had just done him a big favor.

“That explains a lot...” Xingyue Shen’er was even more surprised. Did Su Ping want to reach the limits in every aspect? She sensed that he already had an ocean of astral power inside his body. It was immensely larger and purer than that of many in the Star State.

Su Ping also wants to achieve the best condition in body tempering?

Her eyes glittered; she secretly remembered the materials Su Ping asked her to find; she could later try to figure out what technique required them.

She wasn’t maliciously trying to figure this out; she was merely curious about the body-tempering technique that Su Ping practiced.

“So, it seems that your combat ability can further improve...” Xingyue Shen’er didn’t know what to say, as Su Ping was already a genius among geniuses. He truly had a chance of winning the finals.

Su Ping gave her a slight nod. He was thinking about the Illusionary God Monument Mysterious Realm; he was currently only missing one material for the third level of the Solar Bulwark.

Should I start looking for the fourth level materials?

He could already turn into a little Golden Crow while in the second level of the Solar Bulwark!

He would be a young Golden Crow in the third level, and his body would be as hard as a Star State demon.

Demons were definitely the sturdiest of all creatures in their rank; nobody in the Star State would be able to hurt him, according to the cultivation system that humankind had established.

That is, unless a Star Lord stepped in and attacked him with the power of faith, which was on another level.

On the other hand, the fourth level of the Solar Bulwark would be as good as that of a Star Lord!

He would have the ability to suppress many Star Lords with his physical strength once a minor universe of the Golden Crows was born in his body!

The more he thought about it, the more tempted he became. He then told Xingyue Shen’er about the materials he needed for the fourth level of the Solar Bulwark after some deliberation.

He wanted more of her help.

He wasn’t worried that she might steal the technique from him after learning the list of materials; the materials themselves only worked as support for his training. Only he had the method for the Solar Bulwark. Even taking the materials hundreds of times would be in vain without the method.

Was it possible that she could infer his technique based on the materials?

Su Ping wasn’t at all anxious; he had learned from the system that it was a long lost technique that probably wasn’t recorded in the federal database.

Even if it was, it was probably among the most classified documents!

After all, the seventh level of the Solar Bulwark was beyond the Celestial State!

“You need more materials?” Xingyue Shen’er was stunned to receive another bunch of names from Su Ping, but she soon relaxed. She then said with glittering eyes, “Don’t worry. I’m on it. I’m eager to find out how far you can reach in this Universe Geniuses’ Contest. Years ago, I made it to the top hundred in my star zone and was quickly eliminated in the finals. You’re ‘slightly’ stronger than me and may become one of the top ten in the finals!”

The members of the Alliance of Star currently in her small world were completely shocked. They didn’t know that Xingyue Shen’er had entered the finals years before!

They were too devoted to their own cultivation to pay attention to the contest.

No wonder Xingyue Shen’er had become a Star Lord; it was true that every Star Lord had been awesome in the past.

“I’ll help Brother Heaven Destroyer look for it too.”

“I’ll tell my herb suppliers and ask them to pay attention.”

“Won’t Brother Heaven Destroyer become even stronger if he acquires those materials? He may indeed reach a top ten spot in the finals!”

All the alliance members made similar comments.

Su Ping felt quite happy, seeing that they were glad to help, but he secretly disapproved of what they said. He wouldn’t just be among the top ten if he did get the materials for the fourth level; he was confident of easily becoming the champion!

After all, he didn’t think that there would be any other Fate State contestant able to kill a Star Lord.

That would be completely unreasonable!

But of course, Su Ping himself was already unreasonable and unbelievable in the eyes of ordinary people!

...

Time flew.

Xingyue Shen’er took Su Ping and the members of the Alliance of Stars to the Paratian Continent where they could watch the screening matches; a lot of arenas had been set up in every city. However, not all contestants were strong; some were just normal in the Fate State, and some had grasped rules, setting themselves apart from regular geniuses.

In Alan’s manor—

Everybody was gathered again. The other nine people had arrived; everyone was ready to go.

Su Ping entered with Xingyue Shen’er; his arrival caught a lot of attention as he had left a deep impression on them. Everyone looked at him solemnly.

Even though Su Ping had just launched one punch, no one of those present was confident of resisting it, even considering that they were surely concealing other trump cards.

Alan gave everybody a glance, not stopping to focus on anyone in particular. He waved his hand and said, “It seems that everyone is ready. Let’s go.”

An instructor swiftly stepped out to lead Su Ping and the others to the sky; they reached a place ten thousand of meters high where a comb-shaped spaceship with a huge silver sword emblem was docked.

“This is President Alan’s personal spaceship. You can ask the flight crew about the regions on the spaceship. Do not fight on the spaceship, nor cause any damage,” the instructor reminded the group.

Everyone nodded.

Who would dare to mess up with a spaceship that belonged to an Ascendant?

Standing outside of the spaceship, Xingyue Shen’er waved her hand and smiled. “Just go without worries. I’ll help you look for the materials. I’ll pay you a visit in the mysterious realm if I have a chance; I think I have a way to go there.”

Su Ping nodded.

In the small world—the members of the Alliance of Star were also waving affectionately at him... or at least they seemed to.

“Materials?”

The other nine candidates overheard their conversation and couldn’t help but glance at Su Ping.

The guy hasn’t reached his limits yet?

Materials? To what end?

They obviously weren’t intended for a breakthrough; after all, Su Ping was bound to distinguish himself in the contest after receiving the recommendation. Why on earth would he seek a breakthrough at such a moment?

He would lose his right to participate if he made a breakthrough.

Some contestants in previous contests had broken through the bottleneck and advanced into the Star State during battle because they were too eager to win.

They had won those battles, but then lost the following matches.

They would automatically lose the qualifications for the following matches once they reached the Star State!

Soon after, everybody made a line and got into the spaceship.

The spaceship didn’t seem to be large, but its internal space was as vast as a continent!

That was the power of the Ascendant State; they could influence a small part of the real world with their laws!

The spaceship took off right after, tearing through the void and leaped into space.

Su Ping and the other passengers in the spaceship didn’t sense any bumps; they simply saw that planet Michelle outside of the window had been replaced by a starry darkness. They knew they had left the planet far behind.

None considered this a big deal. They then toured the spaceship while led by the instructors, eager to find out what an Ascendant State expert’s spaceship was like.

How luxurious.

Su Ping wandered around with mixed feelings. That spaceship was massive. The resting areas had forests, lakes, entertainment facilities and a lot of servicemen.

It was possible to live like an emperor in such a place!

Su Ping wandered around for a moment and then asked a crew member the estimated time of arrival.

He was surprised to hear that the trip would take two days. Even an advanced spaceship such as this has to fly for two days?

Su Ping suddenly remembered Green Lady back on Rhea and cried. If she found that he was gone from Michelle, would she push Rhea to chase after him, all the way to that mysterious realm?

It was an S-rated Mysterious Realm, owned by an Ascendant State cultivator; would she be exposed if she went there?

Su Ping instantly contacted Xingyue Shen’er via the Lord Badge and asked her to inform Green Lady about the situation on Rhea; he wanted Green Lady to keep the planet next to Michelle.

Xingyue Shen’er accepted the task and hung up.

Ten minutes later—Xingyue Shen’er called back in confusion. “Rhea is gone. The guys at the space station said that it had just disappeared.”

“...”

Su Ping almost vomited blood. Just as expected, Green Lady had pushed the planet towards him again.

He didn’t know what to say about a girl pursuing him with such persistence; he was more or less touched.

“Never mind.”

Su Ping heaved a sigh; he could only give up. Green Lady would probably not cower before normal Ascendants. Everything would be fine as long as no Celestials showed up.

Besides, she could only stay in the store; any challenger would first have to face the system.

...

“Hello? I hope I’m not disturbing you.”

A woman with a sexy body figure flew towards the place where Su Ping was resting. She was actually the one from the knight king family who had distinguished herself earlier on.

“Hello.”

Su Ping was slightly surprised, but he politely greeted her back.

“My name is Ibetaluna.” The girl had glittering eyes, which seemed to contain countless stars; they were dazzling and beautiful. She smiled and said, “I’m from the knight king family. I hope we can get to know each other.”

Su Ping quickly noticed her friendly intentions.

Indeed, they were both geniuses who could help each other if they could set aside their competitive drive.

After all, they were bound to rise as experts in the future if they were able to survive!

Su Ping didn’t mind making a new friend. He introduced himself with a smile, “My name is Su Ping.”

“...”

The girl unconsciously lowered her head, but then raised it again and said with a confident smile, “Where are you from, Brother Su? I’ll visit you when I get a chance.”

“I’m from the Blue Planet, or as you call it, the Planet of Origin,” said Su Ping with a smile. “Feel free to drop by; it has great views.”

“The Blue Planet?”

Ibetaluna was stunned for a moment. She obviously didn’t expect that he would be from the Planet of Origin, a place known to have been desolate for a long time.

Is it possible for such a genius to be born there?

She thought that the matter was quite suspicious; not about what Su Ping said, but about whether or not the news she had read had just been made up by questionable media outlets.

Whoosh!

Another person flew close at that moment. It was a young man with white hair, the one who defended the honor of his academy after Ibetaluna defeated the student on the Royal Rank.

He was currently ranked third on the Royal Rank!

“Huh?”

The white-haired young man noticed Ibetaluna. Sparks seemed to be bursting when they looked at each other, but they both remained calm.

The white-haired young man looked at Su Ping and smiled. “I am Claesabe. People prefer to call me Silver Lord at the academy. I hope we can be friends.”

All geniuses seemed to be straightforward.

Clueless about what to say about that, Su Ping simply smiled and replied, “I am Su Ping.”

“Brother Su, you have a special name. Your punch was so awesome... I thought I was strong enough after having grasped six laws, but I still have a lot to do in order to catch up to Brother Su!” sighed Claesabe.

Ibetaluna narrowed her eyes after hearing that. Six laws? How deeply have you grasped them? This one seems to be a genius too!

“I agree.” Su Ping nodded with an honest attitude.

Claesabe: “...” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ibetaluna was equally stunned and amused. People always said that geniuses were quite peculiar. Wasn’t this a classic example?

Claesabe was lost for words. I was just being modest. You’re making me look awkward by replying so solemnly!

He made up his mind, committing himself to grasping another law that evening no matter what!

He had some time anyway; he believed he could catch up to Su Ping in the Illusionary God Monument Mysterious Realm.

After all, the higher one went, the slower the progress; he had a massive room for improvement when compared to Su Ping!

Another person joined them right then.

Both Claesabe and Ibetaluna were surprised to see the newcomer; their pupils contracted.
