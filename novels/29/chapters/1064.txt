“I know I’m not, but that doesn’t mean I’ll give up!”

Joanna had made her decision; there was no more hesitation in her eyes. She stood in front of Su Ping like a glowing war goddess.

“Anna, do you realize you’re betraying all of us by doing this?”

The ice-cold Avril slowly rose too. The aura she had been concealing began to spread out, lowering the temperature of the entire temple as if it were winter time. Even space and time seemed to freeze.

“You know me; I never betray my friends or partners. That’s also the reason why I’ve defeated so many enemies all this time!

“It’s all because I trust the warriors who fight by my side; I’m willing to give my back to them. At the same time, they also trust my every order, even if it means death!”

Joanna’s eyes were cold, and her spear was dazzling. “Su Ping has come here for the sole purpose of seeking knowledge; he would have helped us even if you didn’t say anything. The fastest way for us to return to the Archean Divinity is that you do your best helping him. And yet, you chose to give him the most stupid treatment.

“The real traitor isn’t me here, but all of you. It’s your pride and prejudice!”

All three Superior Gods had gloomy expressions after her claims. Shivalello looked at Joanna thoughtfully, and then glanced at Su Ping.

“Mr. Su, to be honest, we’re unwilling to become your enemies. I hope you can forgive us if you’re uncomfortable with our attitude today. We’re sincerely hoping to discuss the matter with you. Whatever you need, just tell us; we’ll try our best to satisfy you.”

Su Ping was silent for a moment.

Joanna also looked at Su Ping; she actually hoped that Su Ping would choose to stay, but her rationality stopped her from forcing him to make any decision.

Su Ping’s expression made her realize his attitude; she could not help but heave a deep sigh.

“There’s nothing to discuss,” said Su Ping unhurriedly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Shivalello squinted grimly, like a lion holding back its fury. Both Eborr and Avril looked awful too; they didn’t expect the human to be as adamant, not wanting to grant any leeway.?How can a mere human being be this bold?

Su Ping withdrew his gaze and said in a low voice, “Let’s go.”

Joanna heaved a sigh in her heart, and then nodded.

She gave a disappointed look at the three gods in the temple. How could they not understand that the situation had never been about making a deal? Su Ping was not there to haggle for benefits with them; he had gone there seeking knowledge as a friend.

The latter had considered it his responsibility to help them return to the Archean Divinity. She and Su Ping were friends, and he was offering a helping hand as a friend, without asking for anything in return!

That was friendship!

It wasn’t a deal!

The three gods had contorted faces as they saw how Su Ping and Joanna were truly trying to leave. Shivalello took a deep breath and slowly rose. “Neither of you is leaving this place without our permission!”

Joanna’s expression changed. She exclaimed furiously, “Have you really considered the consequences?”

“He might never return if we let him go today; we’ve been trapped here for too many years. This is our territory; he’s not going anywhere, unless his bigshot backer shows up!”

Eborr’s eyes were cold. His body, as noble as the sun, emanated an exuberant power; it was as if he were a burning furnace.

Shivalello and Avril didn’t say anything, but both of them gazed at Su Ping. They only feared the ominous presence protecting Su Ping, not Su Ping himself; otherwise, they would have killed him long before.

Su Ping turned around and glanced at them; his eyes were calm and fearless, even while the Superior God trio was releasing a daunting aura.

He only spared the gods a quick glance and then looked away; there was pity, regret, and scorn in his eyes.

While ignoring them, Su Ping looked at Joanna and said softly, “Are you really going to take my side?”

Joanna was stunned for a moment. He saw Su Ping’s casual and familiar expression, and soon calmed down to say, “Of course, you’re my boss!”

“Your boss…” Su Ping chuckled and then said, “I’ve finally met you in person. Are you willing to have your original self sign a contract with me?”

Joanna was surprised.

She had been as vigilant and distrustful as the three Superior Gods when she signed the contract with Su Ping in the beginning.

However, she decided to take her chances in order to return to the Archean Divinity.

The time they had spent together was just the blink of an eye in her long life; still, it had never been as easy and comfortable in the past. She was getting to know Su Ping better and better.

He had fulfilled his promise and took her to the Archean Divinity. Adding the things they experienced there, she had full understanding of the man.

Her life would be restrained by Su Ping and the store once she signed the contract.

Would Su Ping harm her?

Joanna put on a smile. She said, almost spontaneously, “Yes, of course!”

“Have you lost your mind?”

The three Superior Gods were wide-eyed after hearing Joanna’s bold answer.

Their current contract had merely been signed with her reincarnation. Her original self couldn’t enter Su Ping’s mysterious store, which was the bigshot’s territory.

They thought that Joanna’s past decision had been a shrewd one. And yet, she was at the moment willing to sign the contract with her original self. If the contract was exactly what as she had described, wouldn’t her life be under the human’s control?

“Have you been brainwashed by this human? Or did his protector tell you something? Didn’t you say you’ve never met?” asked Eborr in shock and fury.

“This is absurd!”

Avril was similarly infuriated. She realized that the smile on Joanna’s face was sincere, as if Su Ping had asked for her hand in marriage, not the so-called contract. Also, to think that Joanna would answer so readily, as if she didn’t even need to think about it!

Would the iron goddess of war ever fall in love?

Avril didn’t think so. Even if she could, she would never fall in love with a lowly human!

Indeed. Other than gods, all the other races were inferior species in their eyes. It was just as humans made no difference between the smartest gorilla, a bull or a horse.

“Joanna, take a good look. He’s a human being!”

Coldness was emitted from Shivalello’s eyes. He had frozen time and space; only Su Ping was absolutely still at the moment inside the temple. The latter had already grasped the path of space and time, but he was oblivious to the fact that he was frozen.

“You’re willing to give your life to a human being? To serve him and work as his subordinate?” Shivalello found Joanna’s actions ludicrous, a disgrace to all gods.

They understood Joanna when she allowed her reincarnation to work for Su Ping as a way to enter the Archean Divinity… But her original self was different!

“It’s true that not all races are equal.”

Joanna stared at the three Superior Gods with brilliance in her eyes. “But it’s different if they are your partners!”

That was what Su Ping would often say to her when he trained pets.

She repeated what he said to them.

The three Superior Gods were stunned.

Things are different when they’re your partners?

The silent Heather was startled for a moment because of that answer. Her eyes glittered as she looked at the currently frozen Su Ping.

This human… To have changed the proud goddess of war to such a degree…

Of the four Superior Gods, Heather knew Joanna the best as they were the closest; she knew full well that Joanna wouldn’t have said anything like that in the past.

They were pure-blood gods, birthed by nature. They were so noble that even the powerful and ancient dragons were just mounts in their eyes.

All their partners and friends were from their own race; all the other races were beasts to be enslaved.

“You’re acting more and more unlike a god!” Eborr couldn’t help but yell in disdain and disappointment, “As expected of a mid-ranked god. Your bloodline is inferior and corrupted!”

The four Superior Gods were high-ranked gods. They had been able to reach that state in such a barren land because of their noble bloodline.

Even though Joanna had a shocking talent, it was extremely difficult for her to become a Superior God, given the restrictions of her mid-ranked god bloodline.

Some mid-ranked gods did become Superior Gods or even go beyond. However, none of them were as strong as the Ancestral Gods, who were true giants.

Therefore, they couldn’t pass down their powers via their bloodline.

Even if an expert rose in their families, the bloodline would only be slightly optimized; it wouldn’t be a great improvement. If no more unusual geniuses were born in the family, their bloodlines would eventually decline until they became low-ranked gods. In the end, they couldn’t even guarantee their blood’s purity!

By then, they would no longer be called gods. They would be known as subgods, who were seen as a disgrace to all gods.

It would be different if someone became a high-ranked god. Their high rank would always remain, as long as their Ancestral God didn’t perish. That was why the high-ranked gods were always powerful and condescending..
