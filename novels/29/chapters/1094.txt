Chapter 1095: Meltdown

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

They had expected a fierce collision, but the battle had quickly reached an end.

Yu Jingze, Wanyan Shuang, Loulan Lin and the others were still shocked because of the perfect path that Su Ping had mastered; all of them received a second shock with the last clash, feeling that their heads had exploded.

On the other hand, the red-robed young man and his companions changed their expressions.

“How was that possible?” someone exclaimed in shock.

‘That young man was as strong as Kepaf, who was fighting Shuai Qianhou at the moment. Both had once been famous Star Lords tens of thousands of years in the past. Still, he had been executed the moment he met Su Ping!

The gap between them shouldn’t have been as vast!

Besides, Su Ping was just in the Star State!

“The perfect supreme law of chaos…” The red-robed leader’s mood became awful and gloomy. The others had not seen the whole thing, but he did.

Su Ping had mastered not one, but two perfect paths!

One of them was even a supreme law. It was unbelievable!

Supreme laws were usually a hundred times more difficult to attain than normal laws!

That was not an exaggeration. Most normal Star Lords of the universe would grasp plenty of common laws, such as wind, fire, lightning, and the like, but it was very difficult to master the supreme laws, such as time, chaos and vitality!

No more than one Star Lord in a hundred could understand a supreme law!

Full comprehension would be enough to rise all the way to the Divine Lord Ranks top three, if not the very top!

Perfect understanding was challenging on a different level.

“Master said that it’s possible to grasp a perfect path in the Star State. I didn’t know it could really happen…”

“Aside from Junior Brother Shuai Qianhou, Junior Brother Su has…”

“Even Master was unaware of this, right?”

Yu Jingze, Jiang Si and the others were absolutely shocked. They had thought that their master was purposefully giving them a hard time, and that only geniuses like Shuai Qianhou could accomplish his assignments.

They didn’t realize that Su Ping would also be capable of such feats.

Furthermore, he had accomplished it in an even shorter time!

They all knew that it had been only a few years since Su Ping participated in the contest, and that he could have only cultivated for a couple of decades at most.

Diaz was too shocked for words. He remembered participating in the contest along with Su Ping, and being left in the dust by him. The gap between them was getting wider and wider!

He had one of the best constitutions of the universe, which meant that he would be able to easily grasp the path of reincarnation as soon as he reached his full potential, all the way to a perfect attainment!

His elite constitution had given him a perfect path since birth; all he needed to do was activate it!

However, he had only been able to fully master the law of reincarnation; he was still far from perfection at the moment.

He had thought that he would reach perfection sooner and surpass Su Ping.

As it turned out, Su Ping had completely left him behind!

“Two paths…”

‘Wanyan Shuang had finally realized why Su Ping was so calm.

That Star State guy was the other monster that had been hiding in the team!

He was even more talented than Shuai Qianhou!

Shuai Qianhou had grasped a perfect path within a span of three thousand years; he also reached the top of the Divine Lord Rank, even though he had only been a Star State warrior back then, shocking the universe.

Su Ping had just achieved the same thing, and was even more remarkable!

It’s likely that nothing is worth taking the risk for him, except for the true god’s legacy; he only needs to cultivate and reach the Ascendant State. He will surely become a top Heavenly Lord by then. It’s very likely that he’ll rise to the Celestial State on his own! Wanyan Shuang thought.

Up in the sky—

Su Ping didn’t pause after dealing with the lightning young man; he immediately marched forth to clash with the red-robed young man.

Whoosh!

He moved very fast, and appeared next to a young man at the edge of the group.

The young man was frightened to see Su Ping’s face. He quickly released plenty of laws and said in panic, “Don’t kill me! I’m out!”

Bang!

Su Ping gathered the flames to form a sword and slash out.

You’re out?

It’s too late.

Besides, even if he said that, it might be a ruse.

He could return if the chance arose.

The fire straight off burned and cut off the laws around the young man. The young man’s body was set ablaze in the next moment.

Su Ping didn’t stop there; he moved towards another guy.

The dozen survivors left were looking at Su Ping with fright. The young man that Su Ping had just killed was the actual first place of the Divine Lord Rank!

However, he had been utterly helpless in front of Su Ping, who had only stood out in recent years!

Whoosh!

Su Ping dashed onward to attack a woman.

“Don’t kill me. I’m willing to stay here until the end of the trial…” The woman fled in panic. She had thought that Shuai Qianhou—the only tricky opponent in her eyes—was already being held back. Little did she know that an even more horrifying monster was hiding there!

Su Ping raised his eyebrows upon seeing her face and stopped attacking. He turned around and looked for another target.

Su Ping had seen the woman on the Divine Lord Rank; she was the tenth place holder. She had practiced with Su Ping a lot of times during the challenges, and he benefited a lot from sparring with her.

He spared her life and returned the favor.

The woman was stunned to see Su Ping disappear. She then shivered after hearing screams, then watched Su Ping hunting others, wondering why he had spared her.

The others had begged for mercy too, but they were all killed without exception.

She could not figure it out. She even thought that it had been all thanks to her excessive beauty. In any case, she no longer dared to stay; the best geniuses of the universe had gathered in a slaughterhouse. Even the first place of the Divine Lord Rank had been killed. That was just one of the twelve

continents!

The dozen people around the red-robed young man started to flee in panic as Su Ping went on hunting.

Their alliance was already a joke at that moment.

The intimidating three-hundred-strong alliance had been reduced to just the red-robed leader and his companions.

Su Ping watched the others flee after killing five people in a row, not bothering to give chase. He looked at the red-robed young man and the two men next to him.

The red-robed leader was visibly angry, quite unlike his former serene attitude. His eyes twitched every time Su Ping killed someone; their screams were like slaps on his face.

This time, he really wanted to stop Su Ping, but he didn’t dare to.

Su Ping had the ultimate treasure he had to stay wary of. If Su Ping used it while drawing his full strength, the strike would be too powerful!

His companions looked awful. The young man harnessing lighting who had fought earlier was as strong as them, but Su Ping had killed him instantly. Their ending wouldn’t be very good even if they were prepared.

“Only the three of you are left now.”

Su Ping stopped and looked down at them.

The red-robed young man discarded his frustration and said calmly, “You’ve mastered the perfect laws of chaos and fire. Given your Star State cultivaton, you will certainly be remembered by history.”

Su Ping stared at him quietly.

“L retract what I said. We’re willing to join your team.” The red-robed young man raised his head and stared at Su Ping.

Yu Jingze and the others behind Su Ping felt relieved after hearing the offer.

It was great that those people were giving in.

Su Ping smiled and said, “I retract what I said too.”

The red-robed young man also felt relieved. He said, “In that case, we only want three tokens instead of the ultimate treasure…”

Before he could finish—Su Ping had already started shaking his head.

“You’re mistaken. I meant that I’m taking back my invitation,” said Su Ping.

The red-robed leader’s face stiffened.

Yu Jingze and the others also changed their expressions, not expecting him to be that tough. Was he that confident of killing them? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But their leader had yet to make a move; no one knew what trump cards he could have. However, he was undoubtedly stronger than the others who mastered perfect paths!

“Instead of a win-win, you want a lose-lose?” The red-robed young man stared at Su Ping coldly.

He knew that pleading wouldn’t help. People like them rarely changed their minds once decisions were made.

Su Ping shook his head. “Only one of us will lose. Don’t overestimate yourself.”

The red-robed young man laughed out of anger. “You think you’re the only one who has mastered ultimate perfect laws. I would have gladly tried your other trump cards if it weren’t for the ultimate treasure!”

“There’s nothing. I don’t have any more trump cards,” said Su Ping.

The red-robed young man was stunned for a moment; he then glared at Su Ping. Do you honestly expect me to believe what you’re saying?

Su Ping, however, ignored him. As far as he was concerned, the guy was already a dead man that he shouldn’t waste his time on.

He looked in a certain direction within the deeper spaces, then said, “Aren’t you tired of watching? Time to clean up the mess. He’s yours; the other two are mine.”

Both Yu Jingze and Loulan Lin were stunned by what he said.

Then, they heard a noise coming from the void. In the next moment, a person stepped out with a muscular man in tow; it was none other than Kepaf who had been fighting against Shuai Qianhou.

Kepaf was at the moment being handled like a dead dog.

They had been fighting evenly in the deeper spaces. But then, Kepaf realized that Shuai Qianhou changed after Su Ping called out to his junior.

Then, he was reduced to such a miserable state.

“Run… for your life…” Kepaf struggled to say.

Shuai Qianhou smiled and unleashed laws in his hand. Then, Kepaf’s head exploded.

He casually threw the body away toward Yu Jingze and the others, making them unconsciously step back.

“Senior Brother Su, you’ve been hiding yourself really well, haven’t you?” Shuai Qianhou narrowed his eyes and smiled, with a strange light in his eyes.

If he hadn’t observed the battle, he would have never expected that the “senior brother” he had never truly respected was actually a really gifted individual!

Did their master know that?

Ifhe had, he probably wouldn’t have sent Su Ping to that trial..
