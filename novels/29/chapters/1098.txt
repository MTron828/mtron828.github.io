Chapter 1099: Departure

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

The three of them looked at each other in bewilderment.

Both Loulan Hai and Loulan Jue hesitated. To be honest, they knew what they were capable of, but their chances of winning the legacy would be significantly boosted if they somehow got the key.

They knew they were too weak to keep it, but they were also reluctant to give up just like that.

After a moment of silence, Loulan Lin said first, “Let’s just wait here.”

Both Loulan Hai and Loulan Jue looked at her with stunned faces. They deflated like poked balloons; their greed was extinguished, just like that.

Still, they felt relieved when they discarded their ambitions.

“Mr. Su, thank you for your help on the way over. We’ll just stay here,” said Loulan Jue courteously.

Loulan Hai also said, “Mr. Su, we will report what happened to the master of the Loulan family. We owe you a favor.”

“Sure.”

Su Ping also nodded seeing that they were willing to stay. It was the rational choice.

He glanced at Loulan Lin. Although she didn’t say anything, Su Ping somehow knew that she didn’t want to be a burden.

“Junior brother, give them three tokens,” Su Ping turned around and said to Shuai Qianhou.

Shuai Qianhou raised his eyebrows and said, “We only have seven tokens in total. Are you sure you want to give three to them?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Loulan trio were just a joke in his eyes; they would have been eliminated in the first test without external help. And yet, they were going to receive tokens for the second test.

It had to be noted that the thousands of candidates on that continent were top performing geniuses of the Golden Star Zone, while there were only ten tokens in total!

Did the three of them really deserve the tokens?

“Lam sure,” Su Ping replied solemnly.

After looking into Su Ping’s eyes, Shuai Qianhou frowned and glanced at the people of the Loulan family. He didn’t say anything in the end. He didn’t want to offend them, since Su Ping was determined to help them. They belonged to one of the most powerful families of the universe anyway; he would

have to socialize with them, even if he reached the Celestial State.

Once he thought of that, he tossed three tokens.

Loulan Lin and the others felt relieved; they readily accepted the tokens.

“Go and hide yourselves. A lot of people escaped earlier; don’t let them find you,” said Su Ping.

The three of them were alarmed. They looked around with guilty eyes, as if they were thieves.

“In that case, we’re leaving, Mr. Su,” said Loulan Jue hurriedly.

Loulan Lin glanced at Su Ping; silent, glittery-eyed. She only whispered, “Be very careful. I believe that you’ll rise to the Celestial State even if you don’t get the legacy!”

“Tm not sure whether you’re confident in me or not.” Su Ping chuckled.

Loulan Lin didn’t say anything else. She turned around and quickly walked away.

‘The three of them soon disappeared into the void.

Su Ping had examined the environment before giving away the tokens. He didn’t see any lurkers, so nobody knew they had tokens. They should be safe as long as they hid themselves well.

“You’re a great nanny.”

Shuai Qianhou chuckled in amusement.

Su Ping said casually, “There are always times when you have to rely on others. You were once under someone else’s protection too, weren’t you?”

Shuai Qianhou raised his brows and snorted. He didn’t say anything else.

The central continent was opened. It happened in the blink of an eye.

“Come into my small world. I’ve just detected the channel that leads to the central continent,” said Shuai Qianhou.

A token was glittering in his hand; it was possible to connect to the central continent through the token.

Su Ping had also noticed that those who had escaped earlier were returning. They seemed to be trying their luck again, now that the continent was open.

He ignored them as he stepped into Shuai Qianhou’s small world.

The latter wasn’t daring enough to let Su Ping and the others enter his small world directly. Although he would be significantly stronger while weakening Su Ping in the small world, it was still a risky move given that the latter had mastered a perfect supreme law. It was possible that Su Ping could destroy

his small world from the inside, heavily wounding him in the process.

‘Wanyan Shuang, Yu Jingze and the others followed closely after Su Ping.

“Guys, please wait a moment…”

Some of the people who had returned could not wait any longer, seeing that they were about to leave.

Ayoung man approached them and was going to say something, but then Shuai Qianhou coldly said, “Get the hell out of here!”

‘The young man had to stop.

The token in Shuai Qianhou’s hand glittered shortly after, illuminating a channel in front of him.

Shuai Qianhou stepped into the channel; he stayed near the entrance for a moment before he disappeared into it.

All the warriors covertly watching swarmed to reach the channel, but it closed long before they could approach it.

“sh*t!”

“Thate it!”

“Goddamned Shen Huang’s disciples!”

“Tl remember that pretty boy. I will surely stomp on his face if I ever have the chance to!”

All those who approached the closed channel were screaming and cursing, loathed Shuai Qianhou’s guts.

It would be pointless for them to fight each other if there were no more tokens. They started to disperse and leave, but some remained as if they were waiting for a miracle.

They slid across the channel for a brief moment, then found themselves in the middle of a green forest, where mountains rose here and there. It was geologically impossible; someone seemed to have planted the mountains haphazardly in the midst of that vegetation.

Su Ping and the others walked out of Shuai Qianhou’s small world and examined the environment.

They remembered what Shen Huang had said. The central continent was constantly changing, and there was no map.

Not even their master had detailed information about the key. The thing didn’t have any guard either, because if it did, it would be possible to trace the key by looking for the guard.

The guard would expose the key’s location.

However, there was absolutely no lead at the moment.

“We can only search on a large scale for now. Good thing we know what the key looks like.” Shuai Qianhou looked around, and saw that a fog was rising in the forest. Still, the fog wasn’t neither made of vapor nor steam, but a type of special energy or law that blocked their senses.

They couldn’t detect a thing, not remotely.

Those Celestials really tried their best to stop each other from cheating! Su Ping could not help but shake his head as he looked at the blocked scenery. Needless to say, the central continent would be a gory battlefield.

Fortunately they knew the area, even though they didn’t know the detailed layout.

The central continent was eight times as big as any of the branching continents.

It was tantamount to an expanse as big as more than two thousand Blue Planets combined.

That information was very important. Otherwise, aimless searching would have been a hopeless task.

Furthermore, the strange fog had disrupted their senses; their sight had been significantly limited. They were no better than the Ocean State cultivators.

Given such circumstances, the central continent was almost endless to them.

“If we want to find the key sooner, I suggest we split up to make a search array to maximize our perception,” said Shuai Qianhou.

Su Ping had no problem with that.

Yu Jingze and the others acted prudently and kept their mouths shut, seeing that Su Ping was silent.

Although there were a lot of people on the team, Su Ping and Shuai Qianhou were the only two decision-makers.

They couldn’t seek out others for help during the trial, and none dared to be arrogant. There would be hundreds of ways for them to get killed with no blood on the two men’s hands if provoked.

Having no objections, Shuai Qianhou took out a metal object that looked like a bamboo cylinder and said, “I’m sure you’re no stranger to this thing, Each of us will grab one. It’s time we resort to technology.”

“Junior Brother Qianhou, you truly came fully prepared!” complimented Jiang Si. In fact, he also had a similar item. It was really easy for people to fall into a bewildered state when exploring some special areas of the universe. On such occasions, the seemingly simple technological items would be best

replacements for one’s eyes.

“How do I use this??” asked Su Ping curiously.

Shuai Qianhou could not help but glance at Su Ping, He then recalled that the latter was only in the Star State, and had only cultivated for a few years. He didn’t say a thing; someone else explained on his behalf.

Su Ping heard Yu Jingze’s explanation, then realized it was a communication whistle they could use to form a network. The rest of the group would be alerted if any of them encountered any danger.

It was like a walkie-talkie, except it was super enhanced and could be used in some places where magnetic fields were special.

Soon after, each of them picked up a whistle and established a network. Su Ping instantly saw holographs of his teammates on the network.

“All right, let’s split up. We’ll move in a straight line and go forward,” said Shuai Qianhou in a hurried manner.

The others solemnly took action.

It would depend on luck whether or not they could find the key; the only thing they could do was to increase their odds of success by trying harder.

Su Ping and Shuai Qianhou were in the long search party’s third and seventh position; this way they could reinforce their teammates as soon as possible if anyone was in danger.

Su Ping tried to spread his senses as he searched, only to find that the central continent was truly perilous. There were some places that looked normal, but there were actually hollows, broken areas which couldn’t be detected without knowing the law of space.. If anyone accidentally fell into the hollows,

they would very likely fall directly into deeper spaces!
