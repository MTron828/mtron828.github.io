Chapter 462 Results

“I’m fine with that,” Su Ping said.

He wasn’t sure about winning the bet but this was just a game. Besides, giving others a training skill book would not cost him anything. Knowledge was the only thing that one would not lose even after giving it to others.

Since Su Ping agreed, Hu Jiutong forced a smile but didn’t say anything else.

“I will be the judge then.” The Vice Chairman didn’t stop them since everyone was getting interested, but he didn’t place a bet because he didn’t want to encourage that behavior.

“Sure.”

They all agreed. Then, one of them summoned a person to get some pens and paper.

Soon, they were all ready.

“Listen, think about your answers. No peeking,” Lv Renwei said grumpily to Hu Jiutong who was trying to steal a look at his answer.

Hu Jiutong blushed in embarrassment. “I’ve already come up with a list. Don’t think I’m interested in your answer.”

At the same time, Su Ping was thinking carefully.

He had already watched the videos of the Top 10 players on his way over. He tried to recall their performances.

Su Ping was also optimistic about Muliu Tusu whom they had mentioned. He was a very promising candidate for the championship. His performance was excellent and he could easily defeat his opponents.

Upon much deliberation, Su Ping came up with three names.

He folded his paper and looked at the others.

Soon enough, everyone finished their lists and handed them to the Vice Chairman.

“I will keep the answers for you,” The Vice Chairman said with a smile.

“I’m going to win this bet!” Hu Jiutong claimed. He had a flushing complexion at the moment.

Lv Renwei darted him a glance of contempt. “When did you ever win?” “Don’t dwell on the past. I am gonna win!” “You don’t say.”

As they conversed, the judges approached the stage and the competitions began.

The Top 5 winners were revealed after the last round. Four of the five would be competing one-on-one first and the fifth one would have the bye.

First up was a girl and a boy. They were around their mid twenties. The boy was Muliu Tushu, the one who had the highest likelihood of winning the championship. The girl was also an outstanding participant who did well in all her previous matches. The judges read the rules and the games were officially started.

Each of the two participants picked out a beast that they were going to train. The beasts were provided by the organizer, i.e. the head office of the Trainers Association. All the beast options were textbook cases, raised especially for the competition.

Textbook beasts meant that their abilities, natural traits, and characters were all according to standard, just as they had been introduced in official textbooks. The trainers were required to strengthen the beasts’ abilities and then have the trained beasts fight, to find out which beast would win.

Muliu Tushu picked out a dragon.

The girl picked out a beast of the demon family!

A pin against an awl. Both beasts were formidable.

The time limit for the match was two hours.

Next to the stage, Su Ping, the Vice Chairman, and the other top trainers were observing the proceedings quietly.

The beasts that the boy and the girl had picked out entered the stage. The two quickly unleashed skills they each were good at. First, they used taming skills to get the beasts they chose under control and make them docile enough so that they could do anything they wanted to them.

The girl and the boy were equally proficient in the taming skill. They tamed the dragon and the beast of the demon family almost at the same time. Both achieved this in less than five minutes!

That was highly efficient!

Both the dragon and the beast of the demon family were at the seventh-rank!

That was to say, to tame them so quickly, the taming skill had to be also at the seventh-rank.

There were many branches and styles of taming skills. The taming skill that Muliu Tusu used, as pointed out by other top trainers, was one that was specially designed to tame dragons. It was an exclusive skill of the Muliu Family, and quite outstanding at that.

Then the two began to train the beasts.

They had a limited time of two hours. As such, they could not train the beasts comprehensively, so they had to compromise. Which aspect would their opponent focus on? Which skill should they strengthen so that their beast could beat their opponent in the upcoming fight?

Trainers should be equipped with not only training abilities, but also strategic thinking.

Only in this way could trainers help a battle pet’s combat strength grow!

Without hesitation, the two players had decided what to do and started to train their beasts.

The audience kept quiet during the entire process. Everyone was watching with rapt attention.

Su Ping and the other top trainers also remained silent.

The process seemed boring but the fact was that dangers were lurking.

“Look at Muliu Tusu, he’s smarter than he looks. He pretends that he is trying to refine the Frostwing Dragon’s energy when he is in fact secretly using his astral powers to strengthen the dragon’s claws. Is he thinking about making his dragon tear apart its opponent directly?” Lv Renwei squinted his eyes. He highly appreciated Muliu Tusu’s talent.

“That’s a good choice. The Frostwing Dragon and the Corpse Puppet are well-matched in strength. Both beasts are good at close-range combat. I cannot wait to see a brilliant fight where the two beasts’ strength and defense are tested,” Another top trainer commented. “But I don’t think the girl is going in that direction. She’s enhancing the Corpse Puppet’s skill. Is she aiming at improving a certain skill within two hours? I think the best she can do is to raise a middle or even low-rank skill and even that will be hard for her.”

“Interesting.”

The top trainers were intrigued. None of them were able to predict the results before the training ended.

Su Ping listened to their conversation. His last two days in the library had paid off. At the very least, he could understand what the top trainers were saying. Trainers should have insights into the beasts in addition to mastering training skills.

Only then could trainers decide what to focus on in their training.

When battle pet warriors seeked a trainer for help, it would usually mean that the former had met an enemy that was a hard nut to crack. If the trainer was unable to provide accurate and targeted help, then the battle pet warrior would have to purchase a new battle pet which would cost more. Besides, a new battle pet would mean another spot in the battle pet warrior’s spirit. Each battle pet warrior could only establish a contract with a limited number of pets.

It was true that battle pet warriors were able to cancel contracts; however, that would make them vulnerable. For battle pet warriors who were engaged in fights all year long, enduring a vulnerable period like that could cost their lives.

Soon, two hours passed.

“That one is gonna win.”

“Sure think so.”

As the training ended, Hu Jiutong and the others were able to determine the players’ intentions. With the rich experience and solid knowledge foundation, the top trainers already had an idea which player was going to win. On the stage, the two players breathed in relief. They had started to sweat.

The next part was the beasts’ fight which was the audience’s favorite.

There was a sealed-off area in the middle of the stage.

The judges placed the two beasts in that area. The fight started and the chains on the beasts were removed. In the next second, the Corpse Puppet roared and dashed toward the dragon forcefully.

The Frostwing Dragon, on the other hand, seemed less barbaric. First, it let out a roar.

The strange thing was... The dragon’s roar failed to stop the Corpse Puppet!

The Corpse Puppet kept on rushing toward the Frostwing Dragon.

“That’s a very violent character. Nice.”

“When did she do that? I didn’t even notice.”

After the initial surprise, the top trainers began to smile.

Soon, a fierce battle broke out. The two beasts unleashed their skills and threw themselves at each other.

The two beasts were well-matched in strength to begin with, and the battle’s intensity rose to white-hot levels gradually. The Frostwing Dragon began to gain the upper hand with its strengthened claws; they appeared to be the same as before, but upon a closer look, one could see faint silver glows over the dragon claws. The Frostwing Dragon could leave a deep mark on the Corpse Puppet with each attack.

The two beasts kept on unleashing more skills and soon, the battle came to an end.

The Frostwing Dragon won.

The judges stopped the fight when the Corpse Puppet was about to be beaten to death, then they sent the two beasts away.

“She has good abilities but she made a poor decision.”

“If she would have chosen to train the Corpse Puppet’s Malefic Deterrence skill, it would have been able to inflict more harm on the Frostwing Dragon.”

“That’s not an easy skill to improve, especially when the time is so short. If she hadn’t been able to finish that training, her pet would have lost even sooner.”

“I think it’s just that the Muliu Tusu lad is scheming. She didn’t foresee that he would also strengthen the Frostwing Dragon’s limbs. She could have just strengthened the Corpse Puppet’s Corpse Armor... Then the two beasts would have ended in a tie, and with the violence that she had secretly stimulated, there was a good chance that the Corpse Puppet could win.”

“That Muliu Tusu sure played a convincing show. He used so much astral power just to make it look real. That wasn’t an easy task.” The top trainers were exchanging ideas.

All in all, the results were clear.

The girl had lost.

There could be a ton of reasons but nothing would change the fact.

The judges announced the results and the two players got off the stage. The second pair got on the stage.

“Both of them are outstanding. I cannot tell who is going to win.”

Everyone watched with great interest.

Still, the two participants picked their beasts, tamed them, trained them, and had them fight.

The trainers were forbidden from interfering in the fight. Otherwise, this would have been a battle pet warriors’ competition, not a trainer’s. The trainers could only leave their trained beasts in the seal and witness the fight.

The beasts’ potential, their abilities, and reactions to a desperate situation were all variables that the trainers had to know and consider in their training process.

Soon, the result came out. The winner of the second group was a girl named Yu Yundan.

The two losing parties from the two groups competed against each other.

The winner of the two challenged the one who was in the bye.

This winner and the two previous winners of the first two groups competed against each other for the Top 3 places!

Soon, the afternoon came. After rounds of fierce competition, the Top 3 winners were decided.

The last game ended and the champion was decided. The audience burst into a cheer that was loud enough to wake the dead! The champion was Muliu Tusu! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The silver medal winner was Yu Yundan! The bronze medal winner was a girl named Zhong Lingtong, the one who was in the bye.

The moment Muliu Tusu won the championship, Hu Jiutong turned to the Vice Chairman with astonishment in his eyes. He had some serious doubts about himself.
