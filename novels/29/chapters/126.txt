Chapter 129 Doubts

Soon, Su Ping found the Rock Mite in the training space and took it out.

Nie Zhan fixed his eyes on the Rock Mite. From the power of their mutual contract, he was sure this was his pet. It was just... no matter how he looked at it, he failed to see any change.

That was understandable.

What change could come out from a day’s training?!

Nie Zhan couldn’t help but voice his doubts, “Isn’t the training here too short?”.

He quit addressing him as sir because he was filled with resentment. However, he dared not to display his resentment too obviously for fear of Su Ping’s background and strength.

Nie Zhan believed that Su Ping was there to cheat them out of their money by taking advantage of his identity as a teacher!

As Nie Zhan uttered those words, students behind him nodded. They agreed. Someone even said something similar in a low voice. He wasn’t happy about this sloppy training.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He could tell that those people weren’t here to make trouble. They were just worried about the effects of this short training.

He had been on the receiving end of such doubts several times before.

He was unwilling to waste time explaining. He simply sent out an order to the Rock Mite that was curled up by its master’s feet to demonstrate the new skill.

Having received Su Ping’s order, the Rock Mite’s grey body suddenly trembled. Out of instinct, the Rock Mite followed the order.

Whoosh, whoosh!

Two flying knives, sharp as willow leaves, flew out of the Rock Mite’s back, and cut into the boards on the walls of the store.

Rock Leaf Fly-cutter!

This sudden move shocked the students behind them. They thought this pet had lost control.

Nie Zhan opened his eyes wide in disbelief.

He knew his Rock Mite better than anyone. It had never used the Rock Leaf Fly-cutter before, which was embarrassing because this was the strongest attack skill a Rock Mite should know. Most of the outstanding Rock Mites would use this skill.

However, his Rock Mite had been born lazy. He had trained it many times but his efforts came up empty. This had made him once want to give up on the Rock Mite.

How did the Rock Mite release this skill without his order at this moment?

“Your pet’s training is done. Step aside if you have no other needs.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Su Ping’s voice pulled Nie Zhan back to reality. He was shocked by Su Ping’s words and he kept staring at the latter.

This was the effect of the training?

Su Ping had done in one day something he couldn’t accomplish after years?!

“Hey bro, step aside. Mr. Su’s training is always a one-day training. You will find this out after you come here a few times more.” Zhang Baoxing, who was standing behind Nie Zhan, rushed at him. He arrived at five, just as usual, but he wasn’t the first one to get there. Because of that, he was holding some grudge toward this student.

“Right. Not only is the training fast in Mr. Su’s store, it is of very high quality as well. Bro, hurry up. There is a long line here!” Lu Pengfei, who was third in place, began to push Nie Zhan as well. He wasn’t happy about this dawdling.

Those further behind were surprised and less worried once this famous student had made his comment.

Nie Zhan naturally knew Lu Pengfei. The former came back to his senses and his face blushed. He wished he could cover up his face and run away as he thought about how he offended Su Ping. Lowering his head, Nie Zhan mumbled, “Mr, Mr.Su, I am sorry. Something got into me...”

Su Ping wasn’t bothered by his doubts at all. After all, Su Ping had become used to such questions and he was aware that training in his store was much faster than in other pet stores. It was understandable that people would have questions.

“It’s okay. Come back when you have more money,” Su Ping said casually. Nie Zhan smiled an embarrassing smile, bowed, said thanks many times and then ran out of this pet store with his Rock Mite.

After he was gone, Zhang Baoxing stepped forward at once and said rather quickly, “Sir, I come for the Pyro Canine.”

He could tell that Su Ping wasn’t a fan of wordy dialogue so he went straight to the point without the slightest hesitation.

Su Ping had become familiar with this person. He remembered the name and the pet. Then, Su Ping told several students behind Zhang Baoxing to come forward together and say their names and pets so that he could take out the pets at the same time.

Apart from Zhang Baoxing and Lu Pengfei, two other students were there the first time. While those two waited, they were filled with tension. They would be much more anxious if Lu Pengfei, this famous student in the academy, were not present.

Soon, Su Ping took out their pets. For the pets with less destructive skills, he had them tested in the store. For pets that could inflict widespread damage, or with AOE skills, he asked the pet masters to take them to a battle venue and test them out there.

Zhang Baoxing and Lu Pengfei were familiar with the effects of the training and they trusted Su Ping. The other student tested his pet’s new skills in the store. He was overly glad and thanked Su Ping profusely.

As to the other student, the new skill the pet had learned could only be tested in a battle venue.

That student had to bury the worries he had in his heart for the moment, given how the other three reacted. He took his pet away, still dubious of the training.

After Su Ping had sent away some students that came to pick up their pets, Su Lingyue gradually stepped over from where she had parked the scooter.

She had been watching from a distance without approaching the store. She was the center of attention in the academy and had been used to being the center of attention. That being said, she was still nervous by the thought of standing in the store and attending to the business of so many students present along with Su Ping. Therefore, she stayed on the side.

She watched as the pets were collected. She noticed that she had seen some of the faces the day before. Why did they come back for their pets after merely one day?

Were they here for pets they had left here before?

A young man approached Su Ping, saying his name and the pet’s. Su Ping went back inside. He came out with a huge pet that was almost as high as the ceiling.

It was the Wing Beast.

Many students’ expressions changed as they saw this Wing Beast. The pressure was massive.

Su Lingyue was stunned. She still remembered the Wing Beast vividly.

At this moment, the Wing Beast was following behind Su Ping with no overwhelming presence at all. The Wing Beast was acting more like a submissive kid. Even if Su Ping turned his back to the Wing Beast, it was afraid to attack.

The young man was astonished to see this Wing Beast being so well-behaved. He found it understandable given how the Wing Beast had been defeated by Su Ping the day before. However, the Wing Beast didn’t look fierce at all. It was as if the Wing Beast were weaker, not stronger than before!

The young man found it hard to accept that Su Ping had scammed him and broken his pet even though he knew Su Ping was powerful and most likely had strong connections.

“Sir, what?”

Su Ping didn’t say a word. He stepped to the side.

Having received permission from Su Ping, the Wing Beast broke free from its previous listless state. Its spirit was lifted. All of a sudden, the Wing Beast moved and threw itself to its master.

The strong wind that sprang up because of the Wing Beast’s action lifted the hair of many students outside the store, even some hats.

Before the young man had realized it, the Wing Beast was standing in front of him. This was too fast.

“It did not learn new skills. It only moved up by one position,” Su Ping said calmly.

The young man was still stunned. Soon, he came back to his senses. It was till then that he realized the broken claw had been healed.

The wound healed completely after one day?

This came as another shock to the young man. He looked up at Su Ping. Healing the Wing Beast’s broken claw within a day was unbelievable already.

As for the pet’s progress Su Ping had mentioned, the young man had not tested yet. He did, however, feel that the Wing Beast had become stronger given the speed the Wing Beast had demonstrated. He had to go to a battle venue to find out if it was one position up indeed.

He remembered the words he heard from the other students.

So.

This was the reason why students of the Phoenix Peak Academy were there.

If this store were near the academy he was in, wouldn’t his academy win the championship during the Inter-academy Tournament?

“Sir, thank you,” Tang Lang said. Once again, he threw a look at the inside of the store. Still, he was unable to see anything. Without further ado, he left.

He wanted to test and find out the actual change of the Wing Beast. If Su Ping were telling the truth, then the Phoenix Peak Academy could not be the only academy able to enjoy this store’s benefits!
