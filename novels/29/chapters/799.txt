Chapter 801: Collapsing

The power of laws!

The middle-aged man changed his expression, not expecting Su Ping to really be at the Star State.

Performing the power of laws wasn’t necessarily an indicator of having reached the Star State. Having been a teacher in the Hugh Mia Academy for years, he had seen his fair share of geniuses who had perceived the power of laws while still being Fate State warriors!

Those geniuses weren’t at the Star State, but they were even more horrifying than those who were!

At the front, the white-robed young man was shocked by such development. He had sensed the explosion of laws near him. The energy leakage alone was enough to give him a fright, making him want to flee.

When Star State experts fought, mortals would suffer!

“Since you’re indeed at the Star State, let’s just drop the matter!”

The middle-aged man canceled his power and dispelled the attack. He had already seen that Su Ping was extraordinary and wasn’t eager to continue; nothing would be gained from all the fuss.

Any Star State expert would have been infuriated if they knew that they had tried to arrest one of them after killing a student who tried to rob him.

After all...

However honorable the students of the Huge Mia Academy were, they weren’t Star State experts in the end.

“You’ve come to my place to swagger around, and now you want to get away?” Su Ping narrowed his eyes and chuckled. “Like I said, since you’re here as a teacher, apologize to me on behalf of your student.”

The middle-aged man showed a gloomy face to Su Ping. “Are you really going to make trouble out of this? Our student did make a mistake, but you’ve already killed her. She answered for her mistake with her life. Even so, you still want us to apologize?”

“A bad student is a teacher’s mistake. Shouldn’t you apologize for not teaching your students well?”

Su Ping gradually abandoned his smile and said, “If she would have robbed someone else who didn’t have my cultivation, would she have been justified to keep it? Is it something that your academy does?”

All the customers in the queue nodded hard.

Nobody would dare express their support aloud, since they held the Hugh Mia Academy’s name in awe, but they were undoubtedly on Su Ping’s side.

They would have been arrested if any of them would have counterattacked after being robbed, considering how unreasonable the Hugh Mia Academy was. Wasn’t it unfair?

The middle-aged man looked at Su Ping in the eye and said, “What if I don’t apologize?”

Su Ping looked back at him and said calmly. “That’s also fine. Since you’ve already tested me, I’ll also test you and see if you’re truly from the Hugh Mia Academy. I’ll let you go if you can survive one of my attacks.”

The middle-aged man’s eyes were contracted with fury.

This man has been crossing the line further and further without any respect for my academy.

“Okay, I’ll gladly oblige to find out how strong you are!” He took a deep breath and stared at Su Ping. Not only was he going to survive Su Ping’s attack, he would also launch a brutal counterattack!

He would teach the man the price of arrogance!

“Come on.”

Su Ping stepped out and took to the sky.

He appeared two thousand meters above Woffett City in the blink of an eye; all the city buildings were underneath him.

Soon after, the middle-aged man also jumped and flashed to reach him.

Countless people on the street were looking up, hoping to watch the Star State battle.

“Let’s enter the tertiary space. I don’t want my customers to be affected.”

While Su Ping talked, a stream of darkness surged from his back and corrupted the space before him, before it stretched out toward the middle-aged man.

The latter narrowed his eyes but didn’t resist. He had noticed that Su Ping was using the power of space in his previous attack. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

That was a remarkable power. He wasn’t surprised by the delicate usage of space power since space was his opponents’ forte.

They were soon enshrouded in the secondary space.

Then, a dark web appeared in the secondary space again and carried them into the tertiary space.

The tertiary space was a battlefield for Star State experts. Lethal, sharp torrents were surging everywhere.

“Little Skeleton.”

A vortex appeared next to Su Ping; the Little Skeleton stepped out and covered Su Ping’s body as pure bone energy.

On his opposite side, the middle-aged man also became grave, not daring to underestimate Su Ping whose power was rising. He summoned his own pet, which was a peak Star State dragon that was unleashing a horrifying pressure.

A thought triggered his fusion with the dragon.

“Have you noticed that I have peak Star State power?” The middle-aged man—who had transformed into half a dragon—gazed at Su Ping coldly with golden pupils.

His eyes were as intimidating as those of an emperor.

Even though he was merely at the beginning of the Star State, merging with his pet allowed him to fight against peak Star State beasts, and even defeat them!

Su Ping’s eyes were still dark and profound. A bone stretched from his palm, and he grabbed it. It was exactly the bone saber hanging from the Little Skeleton’s waist.

“Are you ready?”

Su Ping turned to him.

“Humph!”

The middle-aged man snorted even more furiously. Golden light surfaced on his body and covered him, constructing multiple defense skills that had complicated energy circuits; one of them contained power of the law the dragon had mastered.

He had prepared an offensive skill underneath all the defensive skills.

When those defensive skills were used, the offensive skill would be triggered and used for counterattacks. He was determined to teach Su Ping a good lesson!

“Sword Technique: Hell of Four Dimensions!”

Su Ping was holding a saber, and yet he chose to perform a sword technique. His eyes were cold, and four laws gathered on his arm. Following his control, they were infused and compressed inside the bone saber.

The gray bone saber released a magnificent and sacred aura because of the laws.

They were three streams of faith power that Su Ping had acquired from the Void Debris!

The power of faith was then spread out, making the space around the bone saber shake. It felt as if the tertiary space was falling apart.

Four laws?

The middle-aged man narrowed his eyes in shock after noticing the power of laws on Su Ping’s bone saber.

He had only seen the law of space before, but then he also noticed two laws of lightning and one law of darkness!

This young man has mastered four laws. He’s undoubtedly a Star State expert!

He must also be at the mid phase of the Star State!

Apart from the four laws, the middle-aged man was also astonished to find the power of faith being exuded by the ordinary bone saber!

He was a teacher of the Hugh Mia Academy anyway; he was certain of his findings.

This guy does have a Star Lord supporter!

“I, I admit defeat...” the middle-aged quickly said.

...

...

On the street outside Su Ping’s shop.

Everybody looked up at the sky; both Su Ping and the Star Stage expert from the Hugh Mia Academy had entered the inner space.

Nobody had moved to watch the battle in the secondary space, knowing that they would probably go further and fight in the tertiary space.

Even if they did fight in the secondary space, they might still get accidentally killed.

“Will the boss lose?”

“Probably not. After all, I heard that the three representatives of the Ryan family were defeated by the boss.”

“But this is a Star State warrior from the Hugh Mia Academy. I heard that their people often defeat opponents above their level. All the Star State members are outstanding.”

“Seriously? Does this man really have a peak Star State combat ability?”

Everybody whispered.

Exactly at that moment—a thunder echoed in the void and a black vortex appeared from a crack. Following that phenomena, a man fell right from the sky.

Bang!

The man went and directly crashed into the street below, vomiting blood.

“Master Grange!”

“Well...”

On the street—

Both the white-robed young man and the woman were so shocked that their eyeballs had almost popped up, as the man who was falling turned out to be their senior.

The woman quickly took action and invoked a wind current, attempting to stop his fall. However, the wind was shattered the next moment and he smashed into the ground, leaving a pit.

Fortunately, the wind had lowered his speed, or he would have pierced into the ground a dozen meters more.

There were loud gasps after seeing the man inside the pit.

He was a Star State bigshot from the Hugh Mia Academy!

He had been defeated, and knocked out of the inner space while vomiting blood!

That was truly shocking!

Dead silence reigned on the street. Everybody was stunned.

Exactly at this moment... Su Ping stepped out of the void right next to the pit’s edge. The bones covering his body were retracted, and the Little Skeleton resumed its original shape next to him.

All eyes were wide open after seeing the familiar Little Skeleton.

It was THE skeleton!
