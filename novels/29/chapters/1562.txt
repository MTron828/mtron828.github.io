Chapter 1563: The Ultimate Heavenly Dao
"All right," said the Mother of Chaos while nodding.         

    

Su Ping had already handed over Xuan Qi's Chaos Qualification to the Little Skeleton while the pair spoke.     

The little one's attacks were powerful, and was the most fitting to receive the item.     

"Let's go!"     

Su Ping was also hearing their conversation, and knew that such an easy victory could be a trap. It would be impossible for the Heavenly Dao's leader to be unaware that the system was strong enough to quickly finish off the forces sent.     

That quick victory wasn't something to be happy about. Rather, it was worrisome!     

The Mother of Chaos slightly narrowed her eyes and communicated telepathically, "He has his plans, and I have my countermeasures. Does he really think that I don't know anything?"     

Out of nowhere, a channel appeared in the void.     

"It's the channel to enter Kun Peng's inner universe!" said Shi Mang, feeling relieved, "It seems that he didn't betray us."     

Kun Peng—the one who swallowed Ti Tuo—was actually the Mother of Chaos's spy.     

This scheme had been set up ever since the beginning of the first war!     

"I may be fast, but I can't establish a speed channel inside the Ancestral Land of Chaos. Only Kun Peng can send us straight into the depths of chaos using his innards as a bridge!" said Yin Que.     

The channel to the inner universe they saw was exactly made with Kun Peng's organs.     

"Let's go!" said the Mother of Chaos.     

She was the first to step out and enter the channel.     

Yin Que was the hasty sort; he followed closely behind.     

Su Ping gathered the experts of all species and the revived generals from the cultivation sites before following the two.     

Su Ping had grabbed a hold of one of the Chaos Qualifications and was now equal to the other ancestors. The world he saw had some sort of strange changes. The mountains, the fog, the aura of chaos and the Great Dao were akin to illusions about to disperse at any moment. However, they held on like wriggling worms.     

That was the original look of the world.     

Su Ping had once seen such a world when he took the Golden Crow ancestor's blood, but that was the first time seeing it with his own power. Furthermore, he would never be able to dwell on the illusion once he saw reality.     

So, the world before his eyes would remain that way, unless he deliberately ignored it and fooled himself.     

"This is what the chaos world is really like. Just get used to it," said the Golden Crow ancestor in a soft voice, who seemed to have noticed the astonishment in Su Ping's eyes. "It was exactly the ugliness of this chaos world that made Mother give birth to us. We created billions of mythical creatures that perished after fighting the Heavenly Dao, their bloodlines transforming into all the worlds. Your human race is the extension of one of the bloodlines, just like how gods came to be.     

"Different species may have different definitions of beauty. However, every living creature has the instinct to change the environment until it is fit for them. Worms and beasts have nests that other creatures despise, but they live comfortably there. Even ants are the same…"     

Su Ping looked at the system moving further ahead in the channel, eyes glittering. "Are all the prosperous eternal worlds what she wished for?"     

"The eternity that you know is but a fleeting moment in the world of chaos. You never saw how prosperous it was when billions of mythical creatures emerged. It was much more brilliant than the world you know; that was what she truly wished for…" said the crow softly.     

Su Ping fell silent. His long time following the system made him aware of her proud nature; even the best pets weren't worth mentioning. Her standards were also monstrously high.         

    

Getting to the bottom of all, it was because the world she had established was too brilliant.     ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The moon wouldn't be deemed as dazzling after witnessing the brilliance of the sun.     

"I see…"     

They reached the end of the channel just then.     

Everybody reached the core zone of the chaos land through the internal organs of Sorcerer Ancestor Kun Peng.     

Hardly had they arrived when they saw countless Heavenly Dao humanoids standing densely in the distance. It was terrifying to see their numbers, like grains of dust.     

Those humanoids stared with ruthless eyes at those who had just walked out of the channel.     

The Mother of Chaos slightly changed her expression as she peered further ahead. She saw Kun Peng standing among the Heavenly Dao beings with four Chaos Heavens next to him. In addition, there was a purely white figure, with thousands of eyes and ears and countless organs hanging from his body. The hideous figure evoked chills, and yet he carried a gentle light.     

He clearly had the resemblance of a terrifying monster, and yet his presence was surprisingly reassuring.     

"You were in such a hurry to meet me. Now, we finally meet."     

The terrifying monster sent out peaceful thoughts; they could almost soothe everyone's killing intent and stubbornness.     

The Mother of Chaos showed a slightly different expression as she stared at him. "Don't fool me with a fake product. Let your real self come out!"     

"As expected of the previous custodian of chaos. Even though you've been wounded a few times in a row, you still have your eyesight," said the peaceful will softly, "Unfortunately, you've long become rotten too, and should be reforged."     

"Kun Peng, how dare you betray us!" said Yin Que furiously, while glaring at Kun Peng, "Where's Ti Tuo?"     

"He's not dead. You wouldn't have come if he were," said Kun Peng calmly, "Mother asked me to sneak in, so I did. Mother asked me to return to his side, and I did as told. Mother asked me to create an inner universe to bring you here, and I complied. What did I do wrong?"     

"Shut up!" The Golden Crows' ancestor's eyes were surging with flames. "We thought you were spying for us, but you're just a traitor. You, a Sorcerer Ancestor, have been subdued. How shameful!"     

Kun Peng said indifferently, "He's not wrong. Mother is already infected, and so are you. Don't forget how the Heavenly Dao was born. Given the world that Mother created, it was only a matter of time for the Heavenly Dao to be born. The Heavenly Dao is determined to overthrow Mother; she's like a glutton enjoying herself for a moment, but she's sick inside and the gorging will kill her. So, Mother is sick and the world she built is sick, too!"     

"Do you honestly believe that they will build an eternal world?"     

Sorcerer Ancestor Shi Mang narrowed his eyes. "Don't forget that life and death are codependent; the world is eternal if they are considered together! 'Living' is just the prelude of a creature. Why do you have to separate the two?     

"This kind of change is the source of all evil!"     

Kun Peng said coldly, "Life to death, and death to life. The cycle seems to be spinning all the time, but it actually produces a lot of hatred, resentment and grief! Those things are like the barely noticeable dust; however, once it accumulates, it'll give birth to the Heavenly Dao!     

"The Heavenly Dao was born because of everyone's wishes. It is everyone's wish to build an eternal world!     

"It's hilarious to see you attack the Heavenly Dao with billions of creatures. Little do you know that this is what everybody wants the most. It is only because they're too stupid and act based on their urges that there's infinite hate in the world!"     

Yin Que yelled, "Do you think that the world of ice you want to build would be beautiful? That kind of beauty is eternal, but dead!"     

"The most splendid beauty in this world is liveliness. The liveliness of sadness, and the liveliness of delight, unlike the numbness of peace, indifference and despair. Even if they're burned, they may jump in billions of shapes like flames!" said the Golden Crow ancestor, keeping fury in check.         

    

Kun Peng slightly shook his head and said, "You're all wrong. The eternity we want to build is not frozen. All resources will be concentrated and distributed evenly. Lives will no longer decline; they will receive the same treatment. Hate is not caused by loss, it is the unfairness of it all!     

"If you lose an arm, you will feel pain; but it would stop being painful if everyone loses an arm. Just like when everyone loses an extraordinary power, nobody will feel pain or anger because of the lack of this power."     

The Golden Crow ancestor stared at the demonic figure and asked, "What about them? Won't they still be controlling chaos? Does your fairness include them?"     

The monstrous Heavenly Dao smiled and replied peacefully, "We'll be gone once that kind of world is built. You may not believe us, but we know what we'll do."
