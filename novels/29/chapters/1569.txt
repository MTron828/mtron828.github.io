Chapter 1570: Approaching the Limits (1)
The Golden Crow ancestor…         

    

Su Ping sensed the other party's scorching will and understood his thoughts. He took a deep breath. There was no hesitation as he used his Contract Dao and established a bond to absorb the crow ancestor's strength.     

"The Golden Crow…"     

Shi Mang and Yin Que showed slight changes in their expressions. Once of the Sorcerer Ancestors, the Golden Crow was willing to become Su Ping's contracted beast and sacrifice his life for a fight they would surely lose.     

The Mother of Chaos looked at the scene in a daze; no one knew what she was thinking.     

"He's crazy," Yin Que mumbled.     

They did want to fight for her mother's sake, but that wasn't the way they wanted to act.     

They were Sorcerer Ancestors, the proud ancestors of all living creatures; they created billions of mythical beings. The long history of countless species was but a short moment in their eyes.     

They couldn't conceive that a grain of dust born in that 'moment' would become their master.     

It was impossible for them to lower their heads and become some creature's pets.     

Once their ancestor joined the battlefield, all the Golden Crows flew over, their fires powered by the sacred fires of vitality. Their eyes were determined as they followed Diqiong's lead.     

I'm coming. Diqiong called out to him in her heart.     

They were insignificant in front of the figure who was as magnificent as a universe, even though they carried the Golden Crows' mythical bloodline. They were like dust behind that being.     

The tiny human they had met in the past had grown into the strongest being in existence!     

You brought so many movies and stories for me to see. We will become part of them… Our story will definitely be sung if we can live through this.     

I hope our story describes us as comrades, fighting side by side!     

All kinds of thoughts popped up in Diqiong's heart. She was steadfast as she moved closer to the warships. The flames covering her body were swept towards the ships; not as an attack, but as a transmission of power.     

If she were to attack on her own, her move would be directly annihilated by the Ultimate Heavenly Dao's power. She couldn't even touch it!     Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Su Ping sensed that a lot of people had voluntarily broken into the domain of his contract and became his pets. Many of them had familiar auras.     

He didn't turn to look; the battle was too intense and he couldn't afford to be distracted. However, he knew what was happening back there, and felt pained by it.     

All the acquaintances and friends he knew were burning their lives away for his sake, leaving forever.     

How could he retreat from this battle?     

Bang!     

Su Ping slashed with all his fury, with a significantly improved power, all thanks to the Golden Crows' immolation to assist him. His previous support wasn't as influential, even while being supported by all species. There was now a tiny qualitative change enhancing him further.     

The soaring sword light shoved the Heavenly Dao backwards, sending him flying. However the ultimate being returned instantly, like a blurry shadow.     

"People are so stupid."         

    

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao's eyes were filled with indifference and disdain. His body was suddenly wreathed in 33 circles of light!     

"This is the Heavenly Palace Technique. How many circles can you break?" shrieked the latter as he charged at Su Ping.     

The light around his body transformed into blades and spears; they were condensations of the Great Dao, containing the purest power of chaos and the concentration of billions of creatures' prayers.     

Su Ping's sword aura was instantly blocked by the outermost circle; he could barely cut through.     

Su Ping was shocked, almost shedding blood tears. He had already paid such a gory price, but it was still not enough; he was utterly weak, not even close to being a match to the Ultimate Heavenly Dao!     

Was that how strong the existence who once suppressed the Mother of Chaos was?     

The feeling of despair was proliferating, but it was smothered just as quickly. Su Ping severed all his rationality and judgment, only knowing that there was no turning back. He wouldn't retreat even after shedding the last drop of his blood!     

Bang!     

Thousands of dazzling sword auras were instantly manifested; each of them was a universe. Even a grand universe would be pierced through and annihilated when they pressed forth.     

The sword auras shook the Heavenly Palaces and broke the outermost circle.     

The ultimate nemesis charged ruthlessly while protected by the Heavenly Palace Technique. He swung his hand as if waving a hammer, raising an ocean of lighting bolts that bit Su Ping's body in a frenzy, just like snakes would. They wanted to break in, but they were all destroyed by the sword auras released from Su Ping's pores!     

"The power gap is too wide…"     

Yin Que was pale-faced. The Mother of Chaos had fought the Ultimate Heavenly Dao in the previous wars; they had only been responsible for distracting the other Heavenly Dao minions.     

Even when they occasionally stole glances, they were too weak to see the battle clearly.     

Su Ping was stronger than them by far at the moment. Even so, he was still so helpless when facing the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

"In that case, I'll give you a hand, too!" Shi Mang heaved a sigh as a gray shadow was detached from his body, quickly disappearing in the sky. That was part of his body; he could still live on if he died in battle with that fragment.     

Once the gray shadow disappeared, he quickly dashed forth and joined the battle, flames all over his body.     

"Shi Mang." The Golden Crow ancestor turned around and grinned at his brother who had just flown over.
