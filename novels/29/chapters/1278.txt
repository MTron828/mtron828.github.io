Chapter 1279 Primordial Empyrean Master (2)

Chi Huo continued with a solemn expression, “Behind those sages is a big shot who was born before the Federation was founded. We call him Empyrean Master!

“This Empyrean Master established the Federation and led it from the incipient Planet of Origin to the interstellar age. He vanquished many primitive planets during his conquest, pacified a lot of dangerous regions, and subdued countless beasts with his army.

“The age of the grand universe began from then on. Countless human talents emerged and humankind rose to prominence. So, the Empyrean Master made the curtain call, establishing the Federation’s current system. Sages control everything and while the saints suppress everything.

“Celestial experts like us are essentially kings placed at the borders of the Federation, appointed and sent out by the Planet of Origin. We seem to hold power in our respective star zones, but we are restrained by the sages in many ways. For instance, we cannot declare war amongst ourselves. We have to enter the deeper spaces whenever we duel, or go to the uninhabited regions in the universe.

“This measure is to prevent our battles from wreaking havoc and hurting the innocent.” “Empyrean Master…”

Dazed, Su Ping asked, “Is this Empyrean Master alive? Is he a universe dominator?”

“I’m not sure. But even if he isn’t, he’s probably close,” said Shen Huang, “A while back, some Celestial challenged the Planet of Origin’s authority; that was when the first-generation Saint King was active. That Celestial attacked the planet in the hopes of overtaking the current regime and becoming king of the universe, but he was suppressed by the Empyrean Master.”

“That’s right. I heard that the Celestial expert is still imprisoned in the Planet of Origin, tortured day and night. I heard him screaming all the way from the nucleus of the planet when I went for a visit,” said Chi Huo.

Su Ping was slightly stunned. The Celestial expert was imprisoned and tortured for that long?

“What about the Heavenly Devil Alliance then…?”

“I paid a visit to the Planet of Origin to speak about that matter,” said Shen Huang, “I hoped to meet the Empyrean Master and ask his opinion, but the sages told me that he was in secluded meditation and everything was still within his expectations. They said that the Empyrean Master would take care of everything when the time came, then asked me to go back home and wait.”

Shen Huang frowned. “Back then I suspected that something had happened to the Empyrean Master. Their inactivity in the face of universal turmoil was strange.

“Later, I met with the previous Saint Kings. I didn’t find much, but the Empyrean Master was probably alive, based on their attitude; they wouldn’t have been so obedient otherwise. They would have definitely been among the first batch of rebels.”

Chi Huo chimed in, “No one knows what was wrong with the guy from the Doom Star Zone. He conspired with the ancient fellow and established an alliance. Both of them will die when the Empyrean Master returns!”

Su Ping felt intrigued after hearing that. Mo Ri was still in his universe of chaos; he could interrogate him later.

“A lot has happened in the universe as of late. Let’s try to stay in the Celestial Court; we’ll be safe for a while even if the Empyrean Master comes, thanks to the artifacts I have set up,” Shen Huang said to Su Ping, “You killed the third-generation Saint King; no one knows what the Empyrean Master will do. We also have to figure out whether the third-generation Saint King was following orders or if he was acting on his own.”

“I know.”

Su Ping nodded.

Once getting to the bottom of things, he just had to be strong enough to stop caring about any punishment or retaliation.

Besides, no matter what this Empyrean Master’s realm was, he was not in the mood to mess with him just yet. The catastrophe mentioned by the system made him feel anxious, and the matters related to the crack in the universe were unclear. He had just broken through and became much stronger, he still considered himself too weak to control everything!

I have to become stronger as quickly as possible. The Chaos Star Chart helped me rise to the Ascendant State; it’s the technique that the system gave me at the very beginning, my foundation. I will surely gain the power to control life and death if I’m able to cultivate to the top!

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Chaos Star Chart was divided into three basic levels, namely the Star Vortex State, the Astral Body State and the Astral Painting State.

He had already perfected the Astral Painting State. The Astral Paintings in his body had constituted a universe of chaos.

“System, what’s the next level of this technique?” Su Ping asked the system.

“Do you wish to exchange for the fourth level of the Chaos Star Chart?” asked the latter, its voice turning mechanic again.

“Just tell me the price.”

“Ten million energy points.” The system was quite straightforward.

Su Ping recited the number and displayed the store panel. Considering his current balance amounting to more than thirty million energy points, he immediately chose to exchange.

“The Dao Heart State, the fourth level of the Chaos Star Chart, has been purchased. Detailed information will be transferred immediately, or at any other time of the host’s choosing,” reminded the system.

His savings were concurrently reduced by ten million.

“The Dao Heart State?”

Su Ping chose to accept.

A stream of information quickly flooded into his head. It wasn’t until a couple of seconds passed that Su Ping finally recovered. There was a mysterious and powerful cultivation technique inside his mind.

“Cultivate the Dao Heart? The soul of the universe?”

Su Ping was slightly dazed; the training technique was rather difficult to understand.

Seeing that Su Ping was distracted, Chi Huo called out to him. “Brother Su?”

Su Ping snapped out of his inner workings and looked at those present. He immediately said, “You should live near my store for the time being. If anything happens, just hide in my store and you’ll be safe. There’s not much time left; a universal catastrophe is bound to hit in the near future. I need to make the most of the time available and cultivate so I can be strong enough to protect myself.”

“A catastrophe?” Both Shen Huang and Chi Huo were stunned.

Chi Huo asked in surprise, “Is it the shrinking of the universe?”

“It could be something even worse,” said Su Ping.

The seniors couldn’t help but look at each other in shock.

By then they knew better, and wouldn’t easily dismiss whatever Su Ping said, not just because he was stronger, but also because of the mysterious store helping him. Su Ping’s words could be direct messages from the magic store. They were paying close attention.

“What kind of catastrophe?” Chi Huo asked, hoping to know more.

Su Ping shook his head. “We’ll know when it happens. It is still unpredictable.”

Chi Huo was dazed for a moment and could only put on a bitter smile. He wasn’t thinking that Su Ping was being purposefully mysterious, not after he warned them of the upcoming catastrophe.

“Let’s prepare, since it’s bound to happen sooner or later,” said Shen Huang.

They exchanged a few glances, then bid farewell.

Before they left, Su Ping told his master via telepathy that he wanted to know as soon as possible if any report came from the Mayhem Star Zone.

Shen Huang naturally accepted; he would have informed his disciple even if he didn’t ask. After all, Su Ping was the strongest man in the Celestial Court at the moment; he too had to rely on that young man.

Su Ping then returned to his store and kept mumbling the system’s technique.

“The Dao Heart State…”

If condensing a universe was a sign of the Celestial State, was the Dao Heart State a sign of a God Emperor?”

“System, how many levels does the Chaos Star Chart have?” Su Ping asked inwardly.

“The standard version has five levels,” replied the system.

Su Ping was dazed. “What about the nonstandard version?”

“There isn’t a nonstandard version, only the perfect version,” said the system, “The perfect version has a sixth level, but is only theoretically possible. Nobody has ever been able to cultivate it, not even your predecessors.”

“Is it possible that the theory isn’t all that reliable?” asked Su Ping in suspicion. He found the system to be acting strangely, as it would never mention its previous hosts voluntarily.

“It’s because you’re too stupid,” said the system angrily. Su Ping could picture a pair of rolling eyes in his head.

Su Ping was in no mood to argue with the system. The standard version had five levels; if the Dao Heart State corresponded with the universe dominator realm-or that of the God Emperor—then the fifth level should probably match with the Ancestral God state.

There was also a theoretically possible sixth level. So to speak, there should be levels above the Ancestral God State in the system’s eyes.
