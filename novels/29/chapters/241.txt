“All right, I need a bite.” Su Ping felt his rumbling belly and stood up.

It suddenly dawned on him: he could enjoy more of his mother’s home cooking from then on, instead of going to cheap diners while working.

He went to the door and spoke to Joanna, who was still sitting there like a statue, “What are you waiting for? Come with me.”

Su Lingyue heard his words and clenched her fists in anger. He’s-he’s asking a girl to dine with us already? Just as I suspected!

Irritated, she pushed Su Ping aside and slammed the door to walk ahead. Unfortunately for her, the new wooden door was too heavy for her to slam around. She almost hurt her hand.

“What’s the deal with her?” Su Ping glanced outside before looking back at Joanna. “Come on. Are you somehow glued to your chair?” “Wait, are you asking me to join you?” “What do you think?” Su Ping rolled his eyes impatiently. “How can you work for me with an empty stomach? I’m not planning to starve you like a slave. I’m not that bad.”

Joanna suddenly remembered her most recent afternoon tea during which she had some fried dragon steak cooked by the best chef in her realm. She couldn’t stop her mouth from watering

“Fine. Lead the way.”

Inside another small shop nearby, there were enough tools for them to set a living space after Su Ping placed everything he used during his usual work days there. “Mom, this is Joanna, a new helper I found for the shop,” Su Ping said while watching her mother preparing some materials in the kitchen.

Li Qingru was shocked for good when she looked at Joanna. Then she quickly realized something. “A helper, you say?”

“Yeah. I hired her.” Su Ping went to a basin to get washed. Li Qingru gave her son an “I totally know what’s going on” look, before she took Joanna’s hand in hers with a big smile.

“Quick, take a seat, dear. Joanna, a beautiful name it is! Do you have any trouble understanding us? I mean, you don’t look like a local.”

Out of instinct, Joanna wanted to push off the human who laid a hand on her, but decided against it when she saw the great kindness shown in Li Qingru’s eyes.

A bit bewildered, she was pressed against a chair by Li Qingru, while Su Lingyue watched everything with a knowing grin. “Son, can she not speak our language?” Li Qingru asked Su Ping when all of her questions were met with silence. Su Ping looked up from his food. “Say something, will you? Manners. I told you.”

Joanna slowly nodded. “I can hear you, sure. Studying your language took me only a few minutes.”

Li Qingru glared at her son. “Don’t be so rude to a lady!”

Su Ping flinched, while Joanna almost laughed when she saw Su Ping being scolded by a powerless mortal.

A pure-blooded god like her didn’t have actual parents; she had been directly created out of purified divine energy. She had seen all kinds of companionship among humans but could never understand what that meant.

Meanwhile, Li Qingru seemed really fond of Joanna, mostly because of her flawless appearance. Like most places in this world, being pretty was always a gift no one could resist. Even a beautiful criminal would have admirers supporting her actions. On the other hand, those who looked too plain rarely earned attention and respect, even if they did something commendable. As their meal continued, Su Ping gradually realized what was happening when his mother began asking too many irrelevant questions regarding Joanna’s privacy. “Stop it, mom. She’s my worker, nothing else. Keep going like that and you’re going to ask about her ancestors and their distant relatives next.”

Li Qingru glared at him again. “Don’t be childish when an adult is speaking! Just look at you. You will need my help if you want to find a girl to marry!” “Nonsense, mom. If I set my mind to it, I’d find way more girls than you think throwing themselves at my door.” “Ladies these days don’t only judge your looks! They prefer someone easy-going, kind, and most importantly, faithful. That’s what you must show to the others!”

“Welp, then I’m staying single for the rest of my life. Too bad I only inherited your good looks, mom.”

“Stop joking, I’m serious!”

Su Ping made a sour face. “Let her eat, will you? She can’t do anything when you keep stuffing questions to her face.”

Li Qingru let Joanna off with an embarrassed look. “Oh, sorry, dear. Please, see if anything suits your appetite.”

Joanna appeared relieved to escape from Li Qingru’s enthusiasm. Talking to such an earnest mother made her feel strange, yet she couldn’t tell why.

She sniffed at all the prepared meals and frowned when she noticed that everything was “junk food” without any special properties.

Su Ping saw her unhappy look and asked, “What do you usually eat? I mean, back at your... place.” “Well, dragon meat for normal occasions. I love the muscles on their necks. Those taste good. As for additions, I would like phoenix liver and blood.”

Su Ping almost spewed out the soup he had just drank, while Su Lingyue and Li Qingru stared at Joanna in disbelief.

“Dragon meat??”

Su Ping quickly intervened. “Ehh, must be the names of some dishes served in a big restaurant! Yeah, that’s it. They always use such flashy menus to make cheap food appear better. Like, they can make smashed potatoes with some red peppers and call it ‘dragon in a bath,’ then triple its price. Am I right? Heh

heh...”

Li Qingru chuckled. “I see! That makes sense.”

“Ahem. Joanna? If you don’t feel like eating, you can head back to the shop first,” Su Ping tried.

“Let her decide for herself!” Li Qingru handed Joanna a pair of chopsticks. “Come on, try some, dear. You won’t be disappointed.”

Joanna silently took the strange tools in her hand; she had already learned how to use them by looking at Su Ping.

She tried a slice of spiced meat she didn’t recognize and felt the strong yet appetizing flavor hitting her tongue, which was... acceptable. “Well?” Li Qingru gave her an eager look.

“It’s... not bad.”

“Good! Help yourself if you like it!” Li Qingru joyfully pushed several plates her way.

Li Qingru watched Joanna’s graceful table manners, then checked her daughter, who was digging into her food like mad. She slapped Su Lingyue’s leg from under the table and told her to study from Joanna using eye contact.

Su Lingyue glared at Su Ping and began to decimate her food even faster.

“If you don’t like the food here, I can take you to a cultivation plane to hunt for something that’s more to your liking,” Su Ping said as they made their way back to the shop, after finishing their “family meal.” “Actually, it was fine,” said Joanna, “Everything tasted oddly at first, but then the dishes became, well, inviting.”

Su Ping glanced at her and failed to understand how a god grew to like the peppery cooking style of his mother.

Since it was back to more waiting, he started up his computer to randomly look for inspiration that would help him endorse the shop.

Only reaching out to students won’t do. I wonder how other pet shops do it? I have the money, maybe I can ask movie producers and TV shows to place my ads in them? Hmm...

He decided to search for a pet shop to hopefully learn something. Soon, the search took him to one of the best-known pet shops in Longjiang City called “The Primo.” The owner of this shop had already opened up a dozen chain stores in the upper town while also having a store established in one of the best parts of the shantytown area.

Su Ping found their main website and clicked it open.

What do we have here... Oh? A new promotion event?
