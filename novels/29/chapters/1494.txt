The human and cyborg pair passed through the hole and went beyond the green glass protection.

There was nothing different under the naked eye. It was the same silent universe.

However, Su Ping’s senses quickly rushed forward like a torrent faster than light. He quickly sensed a deep green object moving at an astonishing speed, and its goal seemed to be their location.

That’s… another green glass planet? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Su Ping narrowed his eyes, but he was secretly relieved. It was fine as long as the Heavens weren’t involved; otherwise, he would be forced to flee again.

After all, there was no way of knowing if the Heavens would send terrifying existences, including the unknown Heavenly Dao that even the Golden Crow ancestor was afraid of.

Su Ping detected Ancestral Gods’ auras outside of the incoming planet. There was more than one.

A high-level green glass world? It’s probably where the bigshots of cyborgs are hiding.?Su Ping’s eyes glittered, as he was a bit delighted by the prospect. The bad omen sensed by the Primordial Empyrean Master was probably that green glass planet. After all, he was also considered a bad omen when probing the old expert.

He had been planning to look for Ancestral Gods in that universe; it was a surprise to see them looking for him instead.

He was an Ancestral God now, which enabled communication among equals to establish an alliance.

“Danger? I don’t see any monsters here…” Basha looked around but didn’t find anything. She couldn’t help but look at Su Ping in confusion.

Su Ping said, “Just wait. The Selvegas of your cyborg clan are coming.”

“The Selvegas?”

Basha’s eyes widened with excitement. She said, “Boss Su, by danger, did you mean the Selvega?”

“Maybe,” said Su Ping.

Basha looked around hopefully. The lifelong dream of her people was to find the Selvega and join the bigger community; otherwise, they would always feel like stray dogs.

The deep green glass moved close enough to be noticed by Basha.

She was so thrilled she was on the verge of tears. She would have cried if she weren’t afraid of alarming nearby monsters.

“Who are you?” said a solemn and intimidating voice that came from the newly arrived planet.

They had obviously noticed Su Ping’s presence.

“I’m Su Ping, a human being. I’m an ally of your clan,” replied Su Ping with a smile.

The green glass planet decelerated and stopped a million kilometers away. The auras of three Ancestral Gods appeared. One of them said telepathically, “Human? I’ve never heard of your kind. You’re an intruder from another universe, aren’t you?”

“Same as you, my hometown was attacked by the Heavens. We’ve been wandering beyond our universe until we accidentally ran into yours,” said Su Ping calmly, “We have no ill intentions. I hope you won’t misunderstand.”

The Ancestral cyborg gods paused for a moment. Then, they all flashed and appeared dozens of meters away from Su Ping.

Basha felt dazed for a moment, overwhelmed by the Selvega who appeared out of nowhere. She was excited as she greeted her superiors with the most respectful cyborg etiquette.

The Ancestral God in the middle looked like a slim and tall man. He asked Basha, “Is it true that he’s an ally of our clan?”

Basha was a bit stunned. Su Ping had handed over the Selvega’s token to win her trust.?Was the token not from these Selvega?

However, as she remembered the behavior of Su Ping’s people, she nodded and said, “Boss Su has the Selvega’s token. His people have been living with us. They are indeed peaceful, and have no ill intentions toward us.”

“Humph. We have to see with our own eyes,” said a young man on the left. He then waved at Basha.

She instantly understood, and obediently flew over.

The young man placed a finger on Basha’s forehead. Soon after, he withdrew it and exchanged a glance with his two companions. He nodded and said, “Indeed, they’ve done nothing inappropriate. He’s strong enough to suppress all of you. Fine. Now that we’ve met you, we’ll take you away with us.”

“What do you mean?” Su Ping asked.

“The Origin of the Universe warned us that the Heavens are approaching. We must leave. We can’t hide here any longer, not even with the Dao Crystal,” said the beautiful woman on the right, who had the perfect body curve.

Su Ping’s expression changed somewhat, not expecting that they would need to escape again after such a short peaceful period.

“Elaine, drive the Dao Crystal along with him. We can’t waste any more time. Let’s talk on the way,” said the slim and tall man in the middle.

The beautiful woman gave a slight nod and said to Su Ping, “Your cultivation method is interesting. I hope you can teach us someday.”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. The young man on the left had obviously read Basha’s memories and shared them with his companions. He didn’t refuse her. “No problem. We’re allies, and we should help each other.”

Elaine smiled. She could tell that Su Ping’s people were friendly, based on Basha’s memories. She didn’t see Su Ping conquer the place with strength. Rather, he treated the locals respectfully.

It was rare to see an Ancestral God behave in such a way. Had Su Ping been willing to, all the cyborgs could have become slaves for humanity. Their heritage and knowledge would have also been taken.

“Let’s go!” said the tall cyborg in the middle.

Elaine said to Su Ping, “You don’t know the coordinates. How about I control it?”

Su Ping thought quickly and said, “No problem.”

If anything happened, he could hide all humans inside his universe and then he could take shelter inside the pet store. The system would protect him in the event of a grave crisis.

Elaine instantly covered the green glass planet with her power and pushed it forward. She also said to Basha, “You can go back. Tell your people that we’re going to a new world where we’ll be free.”

Basha felt dazed. She nodded obediently; she was bursting with questions, but she didn’t dare ask while the three Selvega were present. She merely returned through the hole made by Su Ping.

“Boss Su, let’s go inside, too.” Elaine also went to the planet inside the Dao Crystal.

Su Ping followed her. As he watched Elaine push the green glass planet with her power while standing inside, he asked curiously, “You seem to know where you’re going. Do you have another place to live besides here?”

“Yes,” Elaine said, “The Heavens live in the world beyond the universes. However, that place was not their territory in the past. That is where the mythical creatures lived in the age of chaos. It’s the most ancient realm of chaos!

“Unfortunately, the realm of chaos and the Great Dao collapsed. Infinite time and space turned into nothingness. You can only find an ocean of nothingness outside.

“However, there’s one place that survived. It’s also going to be our last shelter.”

Su Ping was slightly dazed by the revelation, not expecting mythical creatures to live beyond the universes in the past.

“Wait, you’re saying that the realm of chaos collapsed? The twelve Sorcerer Ancestors must still exist, right? Is that place where they live?” asked Su Ping.

“You know of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors?” Elaine looked at Su Ping in surprise. “I didn’t expect to find that there was another race with a long history besides our clan. You should know that even direct descendants of the mythical creatures have forgotten that humiliating period.

“They’ve forgotten how great and prosperous their ancestors are!”

Su Ping could sense her disdain for gods in her tone. As he remembered the arrogance of the gods in the Archean Divinity, he shook his head and said, “If we can find the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors, at least we’ll have a place where we can settle for a long time.”
