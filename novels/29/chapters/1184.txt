Chapter 1185: Relentless Battle

“Emperor Yi!” the Nether Dragon roared furiously, “Do you really want to turn me into your enemy?”

“My enemy?” Emperor Yi smiled in disdain. “So what if all the other species are my enemies? Gods are the lords of all species. You would have been nothing but my servant in the age when we reigned supreme!”

“You’re asking to be killed!” The Nether Dragon was deeply enraged; it could not tolerate the guy’s arrogance.

Su Ping was momentarily stunned by Emperor Yi’s words, while putting on a bitter, silent smile. Those were the typical gods, except that they showed loyalty to their kind and arrogance to their enemies.

What a proud species. They succeed because of pride, and fall because of it…?Su Ping thought.

Roar!

The Nether Dragon bellowed, and the ocean surged with a tornado. The violent force was compressed, blowing at the gods’ souls; they had to hide behind Emperor Yi. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Dark smoke was rising on Emperor Yi’s body which looked like a devil. He gradually expanded, then suddenly took action, sending out a beam of light that sliced through the ocean like a shooting star.

The Nether Dragon slithered upwards, instantly engaging with Emperor Yi in another time and space, which was constantly being distorted. The resulting auras was scaring all the gods’ souls.

“Let’s go! While Emperor Yi keeps the Nether Dragon occupied. Let’s head down there!” said the giant toad immediately.

“Stop!”

The merman stepped up and stood in their way. Other ferocious beasts emerged from the abyss at the same time. Five of them seemed to be Celestials; adding the merman, there were six Celestial experts in total!

“You think that you, the remnants of gods, can trespass the Nether Dragon’s territory? You’re asking to be killed!”

“Kill them all!”

“It’s been a long time since I’ve had my fill. I’m hungry.”

Those undead creatures came in various shapes, but all of them emitted a terrifying aura.

“Three against six. You don’t stand any chance of winning, do you? You think those lackeys of yours will help?” said a chuckling creature whose upper half was a sexy woman, while the lower half body was a dark scorpion; there was bloodthirst in her eyes.

The Night Sky Clan’s prince and the others were sullen. Indeed, they didn’t have any advantage.

“Guys, are you scared?” asked the Night Sky Clan’s prince all of a sudden.

The giant toad grinned and said, “Scared? Have we ever been scared? It was my clan that led the charge during the war. Who’s qualified to charge if not us?”

They were proud gods even during the war. They acted arrogantly when dealing with other species, both in peace and in war. They were always the vanguard!

“I’m afraid that you’re mistaken. We’re not here to fight; we’re here to devote our lives!” said one of the Celestial State souls with a sneer.

The Ascendant gods’ souls were no longer timid. They stared at the six Celestials with determination. Even though they would be nothing more than fireflies in the upcoming battle, they could still glow once if they worked together!

“You’re truly stubborn. We’re all souls. The gods you knew were just shells some were reborn in. We’ve always been the cores of all species; it’s hilarious to see you consider yourselves gods!” said the merman angrily.

“You’re wrong. Even though souls are the cores of all species, they are distinguished from each other because of their appearances. That’s what makes us different!”

“Why bother talking to them? They’ll never understand the spirit of the gods!”

“Let us the deceased gods help our clan one last time!”

“Follow me! Kill them all!” roared the Night Sky Clan’s prince charged forth. His body was like a snake emitting an evil aura. He didn’t carry any godly gravitas; however there seemed to be some sort of power that made it special as it attacked.

The giant toad also roared and charged forward.

While it did so, he quietly released a power which concealed Su Ping.

Die!

All the other gods’ souls roared and charged, like thousands of soldiers.

They were fighting their last battle as former gods!

The six Celestials under the Nether Dragon’s command changed their expressions upon seeing them approach. Naturally, they could annihilate the enemies with ease. However, those lunatics weren’t just fighting; they were determined to sacrifice themselves. Even though they had twice as many subordinates, they didn’t really have an advantage.

They didn’t want to die along with the lunatics!

One’s life would be at risk once there was an injury, while dwelling in the Naihe Soul Ocean.

Heavy injuries were tantamount to eventually being swallowed by someone else!

They might even be swallowed by the Nether Dragon as additional nutrition!

Only those valuable enough could survive in that place.

“Hurry up and stop them!”

“They cannot pass; we won’t be able to endure the Nether Dragon’s fury otherwise!”

The merman roared and charged towards the giant toad. He had seen that Su Ping was hidden behind the toad’s back. Those creatures were obviously trying to take him to the Abyssal Hole.

Die!

A fierce battle instantly broke out. The vortex caused by the Heavenly Tribulation continued to expand, soon reaching the battlefield. One of the Ascendant souls was thrown into the vortex. Immediately after, a golden lightning bolt struck from the sky and burnt it to smithereens.

The triibulation’s range was still growing.

The Night Sky Clan’s prince and the half-woman, half-scorpion approached the vortex as they thought. The Night Sky Clan’s prince immediately noticed the vortex’s change, and his expression reflected it somewhat. Never did he think that the Heavenly Tribulation caused by a kid like Su Ping would be that powerful. Also, he vaguely sensed that some sort of aura was reviving behind the Heavenly Tribulation.

The aura made his heart shiver. He was too scared to face it.

“If you want to fight, let’s die together!” roared the Night Sky Clan’s prince and grabbed the woman-scorpion and dragged her into the vortex.

The tribulation acted as though enraged when the two Celestials entered the vortex, sending several golden lightning bolts over them.

However, they were Celestials, and the lightning bolts didn’t really hurt them.

Such a result caused the Heavenly Tribulation to change again, further expanding; thunder was rumbling, as if ready to turn the ocean upside down.

The thunderclouds—which were originally the size of a planet—expanded multiple times over. The terrifying pressure reached the undead creatures on the surface of the ocean, scaring them out of their wits; they tried their best to escape from the clouds’ range.

Boom! Boom!

Areas full of golden lightning smashed down and struck the two Celestials battling inside the vortex. The attacks were clearly more powerful than before, eliminating a huge amount of dark energy every time. The woman-scorpion in particular, she was hit in the already injured abdomen and could not heal.

That sort of lightning seemed able to suppress them. The woman-scorpion shrieked in pain with a contorted face.

Meanwhile, the other gods’ souls were still charging.

The giant toad was fighting three Celestials at the same time. He had expanded significantly by means of a secret technique. He was so strong that none of his enemies dared to get too close.

A soul beast covered in fungi shouted in shock, “They are out of their minds!”

Another Celestial god was fighting while risking his life. He suppressed two Celestials, making it impossible for them to block other gods.

“What’s wrong with their heads? They were only gods once. Have they been brainwashed?” asked a furious undead creature.

Someone realized that something was wrong as the battle escalated.

“Look! The focus of the vortex is not here!”

“The target of the Heavenly Tribulation is not behind this guy! It’s down below!”

“Damn it, was the kid the one who invoked the Heavenly Tribulation?”

All of them noticed that the tribulation wasn’t invoked by the giant toad. Rather, it bypassed them and went deep into the ocean. A lot of gods’ souls were already rushing in that direction.

The anomaly made them realize that the Su Ping they had seen behind the giant toad’s back was just an illusion, whereas the real Su Ping had already passed their defense line and entered the abyss by blending amongst the gods’ souls!

The six Celestials under the Nether Dragon were terrified as they watched the vortex descend. They couldn’t imagine how their superior would unleash its fury after learning that they had failed to block Su Ping!

Also, what scared them more was that Su Ping didn’t just sneak down; he had even attracted the Heavenly Tribulation down with him…

That being was still asleep in the deepest part of the Naihe Soul Ocean!

Once it woke up, the entire soul ocean would be turned upside down!

The merman was so frightened that his face was twisted as he roared, “Hurry up! Someone stop them!”

The giant toad, however, rushed forward and stood in their way; his body was already cracking because of the expansion. He looked at his shocked enemies and laughed. “We’re determined to escort him on the last part of his journey. We were too weak to fight when we were alive, but we can still be heroes as ghosts. If you want to pass, do so by stepping over my dead body!”

“Just ignore him! He’s crazy for having used that secret technique. He’ll soon be swallowed by himself!”

“He sacrificed his own self, and will never be born again. What a lunatic!”

Another chaotic battle burst out.

The Night Sky Clan’s prince and another Celestial roared and joined the battlefield. All of them activated their greatest potential. Even if they could survive the battle, they would be greatly weakened and then eaten by other undead creatures. So, they no longer held back; they used all their strength!

The ocean seemed to be a void, but the water moved to an extreme.

The rumbling thunder couldn’t be heard through the water. All the undead creatures in the ocean were gathered there to witness the shocking battle.

After that day, in the years to come, they would all remember that a young god once arrived and turned the entire Naihe Soul Ocean upside down!

Deep at the bottom of the ocean—

Su Ping descended straight down, in pure darkness. There were hundreds of souls around him in the beginning, but only a dozen of them were left. All of them looked hideous, and yet Su Ping felt warm and safe among them.

He looked back, and saw that the battlefield was getting further and further behind. He was gradually unable to see the Celestial gods clearly, but he knew that they must have tried their best to hold back twice as many enemies.

“Gods…”

Su Ping was nursing conflicting feelings. His prejudice and hostility caused by the Rain Clan had vanished at that point.

Even though the Rain Clan was still his mortal enemy, there were other clans in the world of gods, and some of them could be friendly.

Maybe some of the other clans would become his enemies in the future. But even if he had to fight them in the future, he would respect their spirit and their pride after that day.

They were truly proud to their very bones!

“The Abyssal Hole is right up ahead. Even the Nether Dragon doesn’t dare to step in.

“The Nether Dragon only watches over the Abyssal Hole. If you go inside, he won’t dare to chase you down,” said the Ascendant souls escorting Su Ping.

They looked weird, and their voices were nasty; completely unlike the honorable gods. However, Su Ping could see the glittering godly souls in their bodies through their creepy appearances!

“Many thanks!” Su Ping said.

“Go now.”

“We can only take you up to this point. You must rely on yourself for the rest of the journey.”

“If there’s ever a chance, tell others that we’ve made contributions to our god kind!”

All the gods’ souls stopped; they could not move any closer. There was a terrifying power in front of the Abyssal Hole which was lethal to them, since they weren’t protected by physical shells.

Su Ping nodded hard. “You are not unknown souls. I will remember you.”

The dozen souls were all smiles, even though it made them seem weird; creepy even.

Without further ado, Su Ping quickly charged further down.

The Abyssal Hole was at the bottom of the ocean. That was the first time for Su Ping to touch the bottom of an ocean after such a long time swimming. He could feel rocks and sand, but it was too dark for him to see anything clearly. There were also unknown floating tentacles.

The place looked like the crater of an inactive undersea volcano; the edge of the crater was cracked, making it look like a huge mouth.

Su Ping could feel the soul power flowing out of the crater. It was so pure that he even had the illusion that it was different from the soul power he had sensed in the outside world.

Is this pure soul power??Su Ping gradually approached the area, astonished by what he could feel. As far as he knew, the power of the undead was evil, but the soul power he was sensing at the moment was as pure as glass. It wasn’t evil in the slightest.

“It’s even cleaner than divine power…” Su Ping said to himself without even thinking.

He gradually approached the crater and gazed inside for a moment, feeling that something inside was gazing back at him.

He heard thunder when he was about to enter, then suddenly remembered that he was still in the middle of a tribulation.

The vortex caused by the Heavenly Tribulation had persistently chased him down to his current spot.
