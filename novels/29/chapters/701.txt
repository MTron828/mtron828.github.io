Chapter 702: One Man Against Them All!

Su Ping exited the store.

He gazed at the end of the street, eventually choosing not to go and say goodbye to his parents.

For one thing, he didn’t want to worry them. For another, he had very little time. Also... he trusted that he would come back!

He was not the weak young man he was before. If he had to fight against several Fate State beast kings... Even if he could not defeat them, he could at least get out safely!

“Let’s go.”

Su Ping had the Inferno Dragon and the Purple Python return to the contract space first.

He rode on the Dark Dragon Hound with the Little Skeleton and flew toward the north.

Su Ping was further and further away from the Longjiang Base City.

“Brother Su, do come back. I’m waiting to have drinks with you!”

“Mr. Su, I still owe you. You must come back safely!”

Li Yuanfeng, Qin Duhuang and the others sent their goodbye messages to Su Ping in the group chat. If it weren’t for the fact that people were needed everywhere, they would have rallied to the north along with Su Ping.

Su Ping saw the messages. He smiled and hung up.

He then gazed into the distance. He took a deep breath and told the Dark Dragon Hound to hurry.

...

Ten minutes later, he arrived at the location that Gu Siping had sent to him.

He could see the myriad beasts in the distance. The beasts were breathing heavily.

There were some amongst them that stood out, having the size of mountains.

Some beasts hid themselves in the crowd so as not to attract any attention.

Just with that one glance, Su Ping had seen dozens of beast kings, including several at the Void State!

He could not even... It was impossible to see the end of them.

There had to be millions of beasts!

Anyone else who saw that swarm would have been scared silly! Those beasts could cause a catastrophe!

Su Ping took a deep breath. He lowered his head and placed his hand on the Little Skeleton’s head.

The Little Skeleton raised its head; flames were burning violently in its eye sockets.

One look and the Little Skeleton understood what Su Ping intended!

The next second, the skeleton turned into a red blur and merged into Su Ping.

Raging and boiling energy was increasing in Su Ping! A wisp of energy managed to seep out!

That single wisp had been enough to alert some of the beasts. Su Ping immediately felt cold glares trained on him; he felt he was a rat facing a snake and there was nowhere he could run to.

However, instead of becoming afraid, Su Ping was burning with battle rage.

White bones emerged over his skin. His face was covered in white bones as well; he looked terrifying.

“Come on out!” Su Ping said.

Roar!!

The dragon roared. The Inferno Dragon came out, stepping on fire and lighting bolts; it was flapping its wings which had a reddish-purple hue.

The dragon bellowed in response to Su Ping’s call!

The dragon’s roar swept across the field and affected the many beasts in the swarm. Many beasts below the king rank were so afraid that they dropped to the ground and trembled!

“Come with me—Charge!!” Su Ping shouted. Like a god of death, he hopped off from the Dark Dragon Hound and dived toward the beast army.

He would deal with the beasts head-on!

One man against a million beasts!

Roar!!

Roar!!!

Some beasts roared back; they were angered by Su Ping’s challenge. The next second, many sharp spines grew out from the ground, heading toward Su Ping.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Su Ping dashed around at the speed of lightning.

Bang, bang, bang, bang...

Three Ocean State beast kings were at the front. However, since Su Ping understood spatial skills, the three were unable to stop him. Su Ping ran past them and dove into the crowd. He didn’t unleash any skills; he was just running!

He was like a bolt of purple lighting!

Bolts of lightning were flickering under his feet. He was using the Thunder Sprint; the strength of such a skill was at least at the Void State.

The beasts that Su Ping ran into were instantly bursting to pieces!

When seen from a distance, it was like a bolt of purple lightning shot into the crowd which blasted open a path!

Roar!!

The beasts cried. Space caved in front of Su Ping. That section of space formed a hand that came crashing down to finish Su Ping. At the same time, space was trembling around Su Ping; claws and tentacles reached from spatial cracks to attack him.

Simultaneously!

Su Ping felt that the space around him was shaking violently. He could no longer teleport, but he was prepared. He punched at the limbs that were reaching him across space!

The golden fist’s virtual image was enlarged, landing on a sharp claw.

Boom!!

Su Ping pressed forward. Nothing could stop him!

The sharp claw cracked under the punch; the crushed pieces fell over the beast swarm; one of the ninth-rank beasts was pinned onto the ground by the remains!

That strike cleared out a large area around Su Ping. Many beasts were rendered into pieces of flesh and pools of blood!

Su Ping was unstoppable. Once he dealt that punch, Su Ping turned around and drew his sword. He slashed and cut the limbs that were reaching for him through the spatial cracks..

Bang, bang, bang. He cut off all the limbs!

All of those were at the Void State, and yet Su Ping killed them as if it were child’s play!

Behind him, the Inferno Dragon had also dashed into the crowd of beasts. The Inferno Dragon had grown to nearly a hundred meters long after consuming the Purple-blood Dragon Crystal. Spheres of lightning bolts and fire came out from under its wings.

The dragon flapped its wings, which would produce those spheres of lightning and fire; they would bump into each other and merge!

The merged energy ball carried a feeling of destruction.

Boom!!!

The ball of mixed energy fell onto the crowd behind Su Ping. The earth instantly began to quake all over. It was a shock wave strong enough to topple buildings.

A mushroom cloud rose; a massive pit appeared after the explosion. An Ocean State beast king was unable to get away in time; only a piece of its tail was left in the pit!

The swarm of beasts fell into panic.

The Inferno Dragon’s presence had affected the lower-ranked beast’s morale. Some beasts of the seventh and the eighth rank weren’t even able to summon the courage needed for running. They were shaking on the spot.

A hand-sized black eagle appeared while Su Ping and the Inferno Dragon were fighting.

Upon closer inspection, it would be evident that the eagle’s feathers had been made of steel.

The eagle’s eyes were flickering; they were actually cameras.

The flying eagle was a monitoring device controlled by the Sentinel Station.

At the command center.

Gu Siping and the military advisers stared at the screen in a daze.

They froze on the spot due to pure astonishment.

They were looking at the video feed coming from the north.

Gu Siping could not believe it. He had never expected that Su Ping would resort to such a wild method. He threw himself into the swarm of beasts... What a lunatic!

He had to admit he was amazed by Su Ping’s strength. He... indeed had the combat strength of the Fate State!

He was crushing the Void State beasts!

“Is... Is he at the legendary rank?”

“No, he’s a god!”

“That’s terrifying!”

The military advisers could barely keep their mouths shut. They would rarely see legendary battle pet warriors fight; the current fight they were watching had changed their views of battle pet warriors!

They had previously seen how titled battle pet warriors would fight. But the current display they were witnessing was like from another world!

...

In the north.

Su Ping was dashing around madly with sword in hand.

He threw himself into the crowd because he wanted to make the beasts turn on each other. Once the beast kings retaliated, they would inevitably hurt the surrounding beasts! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Bang, bang!

Su Ping quickly got close to an Ocean State beast king; the beast was covered in a thick layer of black armor. However, the beast king was halved with a single cut. Blood gushed out.

His sword had once been the weapon of someone at the Star Rank. Even though the power had been lost, the sword itself was still sharp.

Roar!

The Inferno Dragon was following him closely. The dragon flew over the swarm of beasts and breathed fire at them. The dragon was using many legendary rank skills to blast at all its enemies.

The swarm of beasts had been thrown into chaos; average beasts were still, not daring to fight. Those that were further away were less affected by the Inferno Dragon’s presence. However, they couldn’t have struck the Inferno Dragon across such a distance.

The beast kings were heading over in a group.

“A legend of the puny things!”

“Damn it. Is he at the Fate State like they call them? He’s scary!”

“I don’t think I can survive his slashes!”

Over a dozen beast kings gathered together and discussed with grave looks in their eyes. The Ocean State beasts were becoming more and more afraid as time passed.

“Go and alert Lord Blood Wings!”

“We’ll never be able to stop him!”

The beast kings were increasingly on edge as Su Ping moved closer and closer. They spread out and prepared many long-range strikes.

Boom!

Su Ping burst out from the inside of a beast that could not be seen clearly. He was covered in blood and remains. He saw that the beast kings were together, while three of them were at the Void State. One of the three had a broken claw; it was the one responsible for the claw attack in the beginning of the fight.

So, these beast kings can’t share their energy, and neither can they build formations.

They’re in a state of disunion.

Su Ping was relieved to see that. He first charged toward the Ocean State beast king.

The beast—which resembled a mountain, with hair like seaweed—roared at Su Ping and created an area covered with ice; the ice was radiating from the beast. The latter was using the ice to build icy walls and throw out ice spikes.

Su Ping tried to teleport over; however, there were simply too many ice spikes. There was no room for him to teleport. The Little Skeleton’s white bones helped protect Su Ping from the strikes.

“Rot in hell!”

The bolts of lightning helped Su Ping speed up. He reached the beast king instantly and slashed it open.

Flames were burning on the beast king’s wound, which could not heal.

Su Ping added a punch to his series of attacks at the beast king. In the meantime, strikes of the stone, darkness, flame and wind families were on their way over. The area where Su Ping was standing turned into a place of death.

“Break!”

Su Ping swung his sword. He waved the strikes away and made a path for himself.

The strikes were diverted, landing on the Ocean State beast king he had been attacking. The beast king was reduced to shreds.

The surrounding beasts were flattened to the ground as well!

Die! Die!

Su Ping turned around and tirelessly went to face another beast king.

In an instant, that beast king fell, dead.

The other beast kings continued attacking him. The Void State beast kings were working together to disturb the space around Su Ping, all to prevent him from teleporting.

Boom!

Su Ping had just cut open a beast king when he was thrown to the ground by the strikes. He was feeling coldness and heat; he was hearing ghost-like wails and wolf-like howls. The latter were spiritual strikes from beasts of the demon family.

Roar!!

Go away!!

Su Ping shouted and dashed out from the pit. His hair was a mess, but he still had a sword in hand. He looked terrifying.

Finish it!

His eyes were turning red due to rage. He stared at the beast kings, then roared and charged at them.

His wounds were healing while he did that. The Little Skeleton was absorbing blood from the surroundings, turning that into healing energy so that Su Ping was able to heal.

While merged with the Little Skeleton, Su Ping had not only gained more energy but was also enjoying an endless supply.

That was what made the Little Skeleton scary!

“Damn it. Is he even a member of the puny things?”

“Why do I feel that this guy is a beast?!”

“We cannot stop it. Where is Lord Blood Wings?”

Many beast kings were terrified, given that Su Ping had yet to show any signs of fatigue.

Even a Fate State legend would have lost a considerable amount of energy in such a strike. However, it was different in Su Ping’s case. The beast kings were completely unable to hurt him. He would always stand up after falling!

Some beast kings started to step further away from Su Ping; they wanted to retreat.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Su Ping pressed forward at full speed. Everywhere he went, he would either smash or cut the beasts into pieces. The beasts wanted to get away whenever he showed up!

One man against them all and the beasts were panicking!

The people in the command center were able to see this thanks to the metal eagle. Everyone was dumbstruck.

...

Five minutes. Ten minutes... Fifteen minutes!

Fifteen minutes had passed after Su Ping’s arrival; the huge swarm of beasts was rattled. Regardless of orders received from the beast king leaders, some beasts started to run when facing the pressure of death.

Following Su Ping close, the Inferno Dragon was reaping the lives of the average beasts.

The Dark Dragon Hound was following right next to the Inferno Dragon. Even though the former had mostly learned defensive skills, Su Ping had forced it to learn a few of the offensive kind. No beast could hurt the Dark Dragon Hound, but the hound could hurt them.

Su Ping stopped. He realized that he had flattened half of the beast hordes!

He looked back. Behind him, blood was flowing into a stream and corpses were piling like a mountain!

In front of him, the beasts were running away.

In fifteen minutes, Su Ping had killed more than sixty beast kings, and nine of them had been at the Void State!

Phew!

Phew!

Su Ping stabbed his sword in the snow. The snow was tainted red with blood.

He panted as he placed his hands over the handle.

The Little Skeleton was able to absorb blood and convert into energy to support him, but he was mentally tired.

The Inferno Dragon had also stopped. It was sitting next to Su Ping, seemingly still good for another round.

The Dark Dragon Hound crouched by Su Ping, wiggling its tail and gazing into the distance.

...

“He, he defeated them!”

Those in the command center stared at the fleeing wild beasts, dumbstruck.

That was the first time that they had seen the wild beasts become scared enough to run for their lives!

It was unbelievable!

They saw the pile of corpses and the river of blood. Everyone started to feel that the young man alone was stronger than the two walls combined!

Gu Siping looked away eventually. “I think we don’t have to worry about the north side. The west side is not good. I don’t know why, but the beasts are moving slowly in that direction. Even so, the first group has arrived. We cannot allow more to come and we cannot allow those two groups to merge.”

“You’re right.” An adviser nodded.

Gu Siping turned off the screen. The adviser looked at the map in his hands and said, “I think the beasts on the west are in disorder. Several beasts broke off the team and some were grounded on the spot. What is going on?”

“Anyway, this is good for us. The total strength of the beasts has been weakened. It will make it easier for us to kill them all!”

“That is correct.”

But Gu Siping still looked worried. With a frown, he said, “The south side is not good. We don’t have enough legendary battle pet warriors. Alert the titled battle pet warriors... Tell them to be ready to work with legendary battle pet warriors!”

“Yes.”

...

In the north.

Su Ping remained on the spot; he didn’t go after the beasts. He was worried that other groups of wild beasts could get around him and sneak over.

Su Ping called Gu Siping. “Where’s the first group of beast kings from the north?”

“I was about to call you. They are right in front of you; you must have alerted them. The merging is happening, while the third and fourth groups are coming. We are detecting signs of Fate State beast kings. Be careful,” Gu Siping said quickly.

Su Ping hung up.

He gazed into the distance and took a deep breath. “Let’s go. We will do this together!” He said to the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound.

The Inferno Dragon said in a low and muffled voice, “I, I will stay with my master all the time.”

The Dark Dragon Hound expressed its thoughts with a bark.

Su Ping smiled at them, although the smile vanished quickly; a glint of coldness rose in his eyes. He hopped on the back of the Dark Dragon Hound and rode on.

Soon after, he saw the place where the beasts were gathering.

Without hesitation, he told the Dark Dragon Hound to fly over. He would fight the beasts head-on!

He was there alone. No strategy would help him; he only had to fight!

He could approach the beasts from the side, but anything he did would alert the entire group. He opted for saving time and confronting the beasts directly.
