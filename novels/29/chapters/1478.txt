Chapter 1479 Limit (2)

Even if he were there, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to those higher beings.

He could instantly kill universe dominators, but he couldn’t compare to experts in the Undying State. The gap between levels was enormous. That cultivation realm was legendary; it was impossible for him to defeat someone who would be incredibly stronger.

Su Ping summoned the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon, and set about collecting more pieces of the Great Dao in cultivation sites.

The Nine States became more lively after the Primordial Empyrean Master arrived. Many Ascendants knew about the Planet of Origin and its betrayal. However, nobody dared to speak up because the Celestials and Su Ping had accepted the old fellow, even though they still despised the escapees from that planet in their hearts.

!!

The people from the Planet of Origin knew their past actions were unforgivable. They were smart enough to stay put on their planet, rarely coming out.

As for the Primordial Empyrean Master, he regularly traveled around the green glass planet with the Fortune Bell, while accompanied by Xu Kong and Chi Ying.

The three cyborg leaders knew of the Fortune Bell and accepted the old man’s actions.

Decades passed in the blink of an eye. Everybody got used to the Planet of Origin, and the second interracial friendly contest began.

This time, it was a contest of battle pets. The cyborgs who participated also had battle pets. Conversely, humans learned a lot of the cyborgs’ secret techniques. Their combat abilities grew after combining with their own techniques.

“Damn it, why are humans still so strong?”

“It must be because they learned our battle techniques.”

“Damn it, their pets are clearly stronger than ours. We don’t have a good trainer.”

“You think there are no good trainers in our clan? Isn’t Master Ruo Lan a great trainer?”

“Didn’t Master Ruo Lan learn from humans? I heard that his master is the human leader’s disciple, right?”

Humans achieved a crushing score. Humans showed no mercy this time, and the elites they picked overpowered the cyborgs.

Cyborgs were new in the contract techniques and they didn’t know how to make the best use of their pets yet. They were still in the emulation phase.

“Humph. The Planet of Origin’s training methods are the absolute best.”

Also from the human race, someone from the Planet of Origin went to participate. They scorned the cyborgs for what they said. When they escaped, they had taken the Federation’s central computer and database, as well as more than ten sages with them. All of it was the essential knowledge reservoir of all humankind; they could use them to reestablish the Federation anywhere!

Their return to prosperity would only depend on their reproductive speed.

The other Celestials demanded access to those secret techniques when they reunited with the people of the Planet of Origin, and the Primordial Empyrean Master had to obey. The three new universe dominators had imposed great pressure on him, making him even more wary of Su Ping.

Only one of the three cyborg leaders was here; the other two were in their respective temples. They felt at a loss, since they had too become battle pet warriors after learning the contract method; however, there weren’t many unusual beasts available. The strongest had been locked in harsh environments by them.

They had worked together and even requested Chi Ying’s help over the years to tame the beasts.

Once the first beast was tamed, it was quite easy to deal with the others.

Every new pet acquired would increase their combat abilities.

The three universe dominator beasts were split up amongst the three. Crowe only got one, but that was the strongest and toughest one.

However, it was far from their upper limit.

They could bond with ten beasts, at least, considering their level.

If they acquired the maximum pet amount possible, it would mean that they could fight eleven universe dominators on their own; that would be enough for them to conquer most of the universe.

Although the green glass world was huge, it wasn’t infinite. Learning the contract method had only spurred their desire to go outside, beyond the green glass. Their momentum was curbed when they recalled the monsters lurking outside.

Luckily, training pets in Su Ping’s store yielded astonishing results; some Ascendant pets could even resist a Celestial strike after the training

Celestial State pets could reach the peak of their level, too.

Such an astounding effect was enough for the store to always have customers waiting in line.

Even the three cyborg leaders had paid a visit to the store. Alas, their pets had already hit the upper limit and could no longer be trained.

“I heard that the human leader can help others awaken their Dao Hearts. I wonder if he can help three more people in our clan awaken them.” The three cyborg leaders found out the inside information about Xu Kong and the others’ promotion. After all, Su Ping didn’t keep it a secret and they soon found out.

“There are countless amazing geniuses in our clan, but many of them are stuck at that level. Our clan will become even stronger if they awaken their Dao Hearts.”

“But we’re just allies anyway; we’re foreigners to them. I wonder if he’s willing, and how much we have to pay him for it!”

The cyborg trio intended to ask Su Ping to help their prized disciples awaken their Dao Hearts. They were ready to pay a high price, as long as he was willing to accomodate.

At the same time

Su Ping was hunting in a dark cultivation site.

The world was pitch black, not a single ray of light existed. The local creatures either had shocking hearing or smelling abilities, or were able to see in the dark. Even the weakest worm could easily kill an adult.

The place was extremely dangerous. Many terrifying assassin-type creatures roamed the land.

There were traps everywhere. Extra care was needed.

Su Ping trained a few batches of good pets there, all with a certain assassin trait. Their stealth abilities were significantly improved and their senses became keener.

Su Ping quickly traveled that world with the Dark Dragon Hound, the Inferno Dragon and his other pets tagging along. The dark world was extremely clear in Su Ping’s eyes; the environment didn’t affect him much after experiencing the Great Dao.

Besides the darkness, there was a special substance that would suppress your senses. Even the Ascendant State creatures would have their senses impaired; they eventually developed other organs to perceive their surroundings.

Roar!

A beast appeared out of nowhere and opened its bloody maw in the darkness down below.

Still, Su Ping seemed to have seen it coming. He dodged the smelly mouth and leaped to the sky.

He raised a finger, and a spot of light that felt like the sun was gathered on his fingertip.

“Light is the most cruel thing in this world of darkness…” With a smile on his face, Su Ping threw the tiny condensed sun into the beast’s mouth.

The next moment, thousands of scorching rays burst out of the beast’s mouth and illuminated the dark world.

The creatures within a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers were instantly blinded by the light. They were all shrinking and hiding; some plants were also closing their scary trunks and branches.

Such powerful light caused them to quickly wither, twist and die.

The local creatures would rather live in the dark than die in the light.

Su Ping saw the distorted figures. However, he had already seen them through the Original Dao World and he wasn’t surprised at all by their moves. He didn’t feel regretful either; he was a natural disaster in those creature’s lives. Casualties were seen as normal and inevitable during natural disasters.

“It’s better to die than to live in boredom.”

Su Ping waved a hand and pulled the universe behind a beast’s back. His hand turned red as he squeezed the universe and broke it. Countless Great Dao began to spread out.

However, all of them were caught and he absorbed them before they could get away.

Those Dao shards quickly flowed into the Dao of Fire inside his universe like some sort of shadow.

“Have I reached the limit…?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Some of the pieces were absorbed and the others were left out. Su Ping knew that he had reached the limit, as he recently discovered that his Fire Dao’s absorption was becoming slower.
