Chapter 1569: Lives as Flickering Lights
Su Ping—fighting desperately at the moment—had a sudden feeling. An eyeball, just like a scorching sun, grew on the back of his head. With the power to pierce through all matter, he instantly saw the burning figures from the Demigod Burial.         

    

Among them, he noticed the eyes that had been deeply imprinted in his memories.     

He had once seen those eyes in the Mysterious Realm, back in the Universe Geniuses' Contest held by all Celestials, including his master. Those eyes were now overlapping with what he had seen earlier.     

It was just like the way she raised her head while standing behind the counter, countless times.     

The gaze he knew was overlapping with the one before his eyes, becoming eternal.     

The familiar smile, affection, gentleness, admiration, encouragement, reluctance and so many other feelings were imbued in those eyes. Su Ping felt as if his body were torn to pieces upon seeing her body, burning swiftly.     

He knew that nobody was exempt in that battle.     

However, such an enormous grief couldn't be erased.     

He roared furiously and swung his sword again, cutting through eternity and chaos. The strike was extremely skillful, containing the splendor of origin itself.     

Time, memory, mentality and all the powers from other dimensions were gathered in one point.     

That was the height that Su Ping had attained after merging with the system. His battle technique reached a higher level.     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was astonished. It was obvious that he wasn't expecting that a being other than the Mother of Chaos could have such expertise. Even the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors were as innocent as children in his eyes; he could easily subdue them.     

Except for the lives born in the Chaos Core, that one had probably reached the supreme level.     

"Even if you use all the people and the Great Dao as fuel, you're only fireflies in my eyes!" The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was aggressive and indifferent. The tribulation power in his hand soared and was split into billions of streams, darting like an infinite number of sharp blades and vines, surrounding Su Ping's body with a terrifying binding force.     

The power was influencing Su Ping's will directly.     

The invasion of his willpower allowed the billions of species bonded with Su Ping to feel the pressure of the heavens!     

Just a fraction of the pressure was enough to make a lot of people feel desperate and faint.     

"F*ck off!!" Su Ping roared and slashed furiously. The sword aura was swept in all directions, illuminating the surrounding chaos.     

The people in the vessel behind him stepped up, one after the other. They were bathing in the fires of life as they constantly transmitted their power to Su Ping.     

A monarch of the undead stepped out. "On behalf of the Moon Clan, I'll go first. You must not retreat; it is better to die in front of millions of people than to hide behind billions of people just to survive!"     

His body held up the sky like a pillar; he was ready to fight.     

Behind him were countless undead creatures that saw him off in tears.     

"We are dead already, but the fire in our hearts will always exist!" said another undead monarch, as he walked out from the crowd and burned his life, all to support his clan.     

The top clans from the Chaotic Realm of the Undead sent out all their forces as the undead monarchs stepped out.     

All of them had perished once, turning into undead creatures permanently living in that somber realm. They were willing to die again, even in the face of doom.     

"We will not retreat."         

    

"The Moon Wolves are willing to fight along with the kings!"     

"The Purple Dragons are willing to die with our heads held high!"     

Some clans from the cultivation sites were formed by demon beasts, some by dragons, and others by wolves. All of them were ready to fight in earnest.     

They usually regarded other species as prey, and were considered monsters. However, all prejudice was discarded as they faced the Ultimate Heavenly Dao, who intended to destroy all lives.     

Billions of species gathered, and all of them were just comrades!     

Even worms, who were usually afraid of death, joined the battle to face the Ultimate Heavenly Dao along with Su Ping. Gods and Asuras also chose to become fireflies; the undead threw themselves to the battlefield.     

They willingly followed the magnificent, seemingly eternal figure, turning into a stream of light. The sword became even more brilliant as thousands of streams of light were gathered.     

Countless figures were burning and perishing. Thousands of lives were reaped with each passing moment.     

The Celestials and even the Undying State experts were heavily wounded and even killed with every clash!     

The battle involved all species and all lives.     

"Brother…"     

"I believe in you. You're always the winner in my eyes. You've never lost!"     

Among the humans—Su Lingyue stood next to Shen Huang, who had been looking after her. However, just like the other human experts next to Shen Huang, she was burning with the fire of life.     

"Son, we believe in you!"     

Su Ping's parents held each other. There was only glory and comfort left in their eyes as they looked at the figure battling furiously.     

"I believe in you too…" said Shen Huang in a muted voice.     

Just like Su Ping's sister, he had always seen his disciple winning, never losing!     

Beside him were the other human Celestials who had reached the Dao Heart State with Su Ping's help. They used to be independent in the Federation, but they all chose to ignite their life force at that moment.     

"Boss Su, it's a pity that I won't be able to visit your store again."     

"Xiao Meng, he was the one who trained you."     

Also in flames, the other humans were witnessing the battle from the warship.     

Every collision caused the world to tremble.     

They could feel the magnificent power surge, even though they were protected by the vessels.     

Humans, fighting the Heavenly Dao!     

Many pets that had been trained in Su Ping's store were also looking up to him.         

    

Billions of gazes were gathered, transmitting an infinite power. Su Ping's strength was inexhaustible. He could feel their thoughts and affection through the power being transferred.     

Su Ping felt torn because he could sense the willpower of his naughty sister, his parents, and his old customers.     

They were all sacrificing themselves for the sake of victory!     

Bang!     

Su Ping's sword pressed forward and severed one of his ultimate nemesis' arms.     

However, the latter quickly condensed a new arm the next moment, which carried even more tribulation power to continue the fight.     

Our hero kept on swinging his sword with a raging momentum to contend with the humanoid leader.     

"This won't do. He's harnessing the power of the people, but that's not enough to be as strong as the Ultimate Heavenly Dao!"     

Sorcerer Ancestor Yin Que and the others noticed Su Ping's shortcomings.     

Even if the latter had displayed a power superior to what Sorcerer Ancestors could muster, he was still no match for the Ultimate Heavenly Dao. After all, even the Mother of Chaos was unable to defeat the fellow in her peak state.     

Besides, just like the enemy said, he had also gathered the power of the people, who were much more in number than those backing Su Ping.     

"His strength is infinite for now, having the support of the people, but the quality of his strength can't be raised to be on par with the Ultimate Heavenly Dao. A qualitative change needs to occur."     

The Golden Crow ancestor looked awful, also realizing Su Ping's situation and his inevitable doom.     

Even if the battle continued, they would only be turned into ashes, incapable of turning things around.     

"He has surely realized the problem, too. That's why he's so sad," said Shi Mang. His eyes were solemn; for the first time, he seemed to be observing the champion trained by the Mother of Chaos.     

"He's still not retreating, though. He can still escape if he leaves right now…"     

Yin Que wore a troubled face; he didn't know why Su Ping was so persistent. He seemed to have been able to win everyone's trust, so he had surely entrusted his life to them as well. The bond was mutual; however, people were dying and failure was inevitable. Why is Su Ping still fighting when he could escape?     

"He's never thought of escaping. Perhaps… This is the significance of life that he believes in," whispered the Golden Crow ancestor.     

"If your life is eternal, is there really any meaning to it?" Yin Que mumbled.     

"If he believes there is, it might really be so," said Shi Mang.     

Exactly at that moment—a dazzling light surfaced on the Golden Crow ancestor's back. Many Golden Crows were flying out.     ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"Grandfather, I want to fight!"     

Their leader was a graceful golden figure who spoke in a crisp and powerful voice. It was none other than Diqiong.     

Her ancestral bloodline had awakened just then. She was the new Golden Crow leader.     

Next to her were the Golden Crow elders with top Undying State cultivation, which was only second to that of Sorcerer Ancestors.         

    

"Go."     

The Golden Crow ancestor didn't stop them, as he understood what his descendant was thinking. There was no need for any communication, as he knew they were determined.     

Furthermore…     

"I'm going too!"     

The Golden Crow ancestor turned into a scorching sun and also rushed into the battlefield with burning power. He roared at Su Ping, "Please take my strength, too!"     

Su Ping was still alert, even while going all out in the fight, and immediately noticed the Golden Crow ancestor's arrival.
