Chapter 1270 Eat the Saint (1)

“The relics of a universe dominator, all my belongings, and the Doom Star Zone will be yours. I can join the Celestial Court too, as long as you spare me,” said Mo Ri in a hurry. He didn’t want to die just like that, after cultivating for hundreds of thousands of years.

He had spent just as long with his scheming. He had hunted Celestials once, and still dreamed of becoming a universe dominator. His dream had yet to be fulfilled… He didn’t want to die!

“You won’t die this easily…” said Su Ping grimly. He then squeezed one of his hands and sent the man into his universe of chaos.

Blazing shackles were gathered from all directions, ensnaring both Ye Chen and Mo Ri and suppressing them completely.

Flames powerful enough to burn the soul raged on. It didn’t take long for devastating screams to burst out.

Not even the Celestials had the mettle to tolerate the noises.

Su Ping ignored them and looked around. Those who happened to meet his eyes retreated out of reflex, not daring to look back.

This was so especially when it happened to Hai Mei and the others mixed in the crowd; they were quick to lower their heads in desperation, hearts racing. They had previously stood on the Heavenly Devil Alliance’s side and tried to kill Su Ping. The tables turned; the latter suppressed two Celestials, and the Heavenly Devil Alliance would undoubtedly collapse. The last Celestial on their side wasn’t enough to lead the whole faction.

They would surely die if Su Ping were to seek retaliation!

They considered running, but reason stopped them from taking action. Even Celestials had failed to escape from Su Ping, what could they do? They would only die faster if they did anything reckless.

Surrendering was their last chance to survive.

Su Ping only spared them a glance and ignored them afterwards. The surging killing intent and grief in his heart prompted him to take Ye Chen and Mo Ri into a zone with disordered time and space to torture them infinitely.

However, he knew there were more important things to do.

Checking on his master and his senior brothers.

There were also his other enemies!

Whoosh!

Su Ping flashed across space and instantly appeared somewhere in the distance. Many bodies were sprawled randomly. There were also torn corpses of gigantic beasts.

Once he got there, he saw that Chunyu-his second senior brother-was supporting Song Yuan, their eldest brother. Both seemed to be exhausted, but they were still alive.

Su Ping’s anger receded somewhat. He extended his perception and quickly examined the others.

He quickly discovered that Ji Xueqing had lost all her vitality. Her body was rotting, corrupted by the power of Dao Patterns. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Senior Brother You Long was dying too, about to draw his last breath. There was a mysterious power on his chest that seemed to have miraculously kept him alive.

In addition, his third senior brother was extremely weakened, but in much better condition when compared to You Long.

As for the rest, they had died, meeting the same fate as his fourth senior sister.

Su Ping gritted his teeth and approached You Long after a flash. He pressed his hands against You Long’s chest, releasing the power of chaos and transforming it into vitality. The latter soon struggled to open his eyes, feeling at a loss, as though he were dreaming.

Without saying a word, Su Ping moved to treat his third senior brother, also rescuing him from death’s grasp.

Ji Xueqing was next. Su Ping couldn’t help but clench his fists as he looked at her beautiful yet pale face. A crazy killing intent was sprouting inside his heart, just like the root of a tree. He then remembered the first time they met; she was with Elder Yan.

In the blink of an eye, the sunny and delightful girl had turned into a cold body riddled with wounds lying before him.

Could there be a graver pain?

Su Ping wanted to reverse time to restore her health. However, she too had been thoroughly bashed by the power of Dao Patterns to be resurrected by reversing time, just as it happened to the Little Skeleton.

He silently released a gentle power of chaos to erase the Dao Patterns’ relentless corruptive power affecting her body. Once he saw that her body was no longer decaying, he covered it with chaos power and sent it into his small universe.

After that he took care of his deceased seniors, also sending them to his chaos universe after removing their battle wounds.

“Junior brother…”

You Long led Chunyu, Song Yuan and the others to meet him, then asked in a hurry, “Where are the two Celestial sons of bi*ches? How is it that you’re still here?”

“They were suppressed by me,” said Su Ping, astounding his seniors.

“Have some rest. I’ll go find Master.”

Su Ping glanced at them, although feeling too ashamed to face them. He flashed and disappeared right after his reply.

You Long couldn’t help but ask, “What did he just say?”

Han Ye said in a daze, “Did he say that he suppressed two Celestials?”

Chunyu and Song Yuan shared bewildered looks. Although hard to believe, Su Ping actually surviving was quite convincing, despite their failed attempt to block their enemies.

But…

Whoosh!

Su Ping’s consciousness was spread out, and soon located his master, somewhere in the ninth space.

He arrived to witness a huge battle taking place.
