Chapter 1578: Epilogue: Welcome Back (1)
"You're back?"         

    

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao looked at Su Ping with a smile. There was an earnestness of sorts in his eyes, and the cold, furious intent was no more. Instead, he had the warmth a person showed when seeing an old friend.     

Su Ping had passed through countless reincarnations while experiencing the prayer of the people. It was a devastatingly long time, even for immortals.     

However, that experience had been but a short moment for existences like the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

He couldn't be restrained by time. He wouldn't feel anxious due to the passage of time, either.     

Time would deform many things, including objects and minds.     

Therefore, eternal things wouldn't be worn out by time, and would always remain the same. The long span of time was just a scroll in his eyes; he could see what would happen billions of years into the future, or the things that happened in someone's past life.     

Everything had been predestined since the beginning.     

The process in between was the life of a creature, the moment it blossomed, the changes of the sun and the moon, and the surging of rivers.     

Su Ping slowly opened his eyes. Billions of stars seemed to be glittering within, but they were gone in a flash; only the black pupils remained.     

Unlike his past self, his eyes were no longer furious or suffused with pain. Only a gentle, calm indifference remained.     

There were no fluctuations, even when he stared at the hateful Ultimate Heavenly Dao he wanted to destroy; the gentleness in his eyes were the same. There was neither fury nor killing intent.     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao showed a brighter smile as he looked at Su Ping. "Looks like you've understood. Like I said, once you go through the things I've experienced, your head will become as clear as mine. So many people in the world are angry and hate each other due to conflicts and misunderstandings. It's all because they can't understand each other's circumstances.     

"This is because they live in different environments and different clans. The family and friends they grow up with are not the same, either. Even family and the loved ones most cherished by the weak can't fully understand their difficulties and pains.     Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"You tend to feel utterly alone, even if you live under the same roof with other people, or when standing in the middle of a crowd.     

"This kind of loneliness is not unique; any living creature can feel it. They hope that others can understand them, but they can't understand each other. That's the sadness of life."     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao looked at Su Ping with a smile. "Come on. Let's create an eternal world together, so that chaos is not a sad place again."     

While looking at his arm for a long time, Su Ping eventually shook his head. With a smile on his face, he said, "You're right. However, this loneliness is what makes chaos so wonderful and enjoyable. Eternity is beautiful and everlasting, but it's too boring.     

"I prefer loneliness to boredom."     

He slowly raised his hand and offered it to the Ultimate Heavenly Dao. "Come on. Melt into this world with me, and see the light in this world, instead of the darkness!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was stunned.     

The smile on his face froze and soon disappeared. He stared at Su Ping with a gloomy face and said, "It seems that your understanding isn't profound enough."     

Su Ping shook his head. "I've understood completely. Had I not met her, or them, I would have probably ended up just like you. Unfortunately for you, I did meet them. No matter how many experiences of the horrors in the world I've gone through, one thing doesn't change…     

"This is the world she created. How can I hate something she created?"     

Instantly, the Ultimate Heavenly Dao had somehow realized who "them" were ones Su Ping was talking about. He became gloomier and cold. "Looks like you've been too deeply poisoned. Being completely erased is the only alternative!"     

Just then, the Chaos Core intervened. "Is this really your choice?"         

    

He gazed at Su Ping. His apparently unchanging eyes were able to see through everything.     

Su Ping stared back at him confidently. "You're right. This is my choice!"     

"This is impossible!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao was seething. He understood what the Chaos Core was thinking. As agreed upon, the lad would go back to the Mother of Chaos if Su Ping didn't change his mind after experiencing the prayer of the people.     

"You must have played some sort of trick. You wouldn't have said that if you truly experienced it!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao continued, said furiously. "You've only lived for ten thousand years. Even if you're a top chaos entity, you can't possibly do it. It's not bad if you don't get lost in the infinite reincarnations, which are billions of times longer than the life you've led. But how can you say that!"     

"People will change after experiencing new things. Their thoughts and personalities won't be the same. Their former selves technically die because of those experiences, and they are replaced with new personalities."     

Su Ping stared at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao and said, "However, did you know that my thoughts remain the same as they were during the first twenty years of my cultivation? Cultivation has only allowed me to see things from a higher, deeper perspective; but my heart has never changed.     

"Friends, partners and family are still of paramount importance in my heart. Some things are universally known, just like how even the weakest people knew that the sun was too bright to be directly looked at. It has nothing to do with experiences. Even the most heinous criminals know they're doing bad things; it's just that they don't care!"
