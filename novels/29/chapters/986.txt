Chapter 987: Cultivation Beyond the Limits

“Every level has a corresponding power core.

“The core for a Celestial God is the power of laws they have mastered, as well as the number of such laws.

“God Warriors differ from each other when it comes to the power of faith and their small worlds.

“Today, we will talk about the difference between small worlds.”

With a smile, the young mentor asked, “If your opponent is at the same level as you are, how can your small world completely surpass theirs? Anyone?”

Su Ping and the others considered carefully, not rushing to answer the question.

The young god, however, frowned and said indifferently, “That is an easy question. The number and power of laws used to construct a small world would decide its power. That’s the reason why we pursue the four supreme laws; our small world would become more solid than anything if we add them. That way we can easily crush opponents on our level.”

“Exactly,” replied the young mentor with a smile, “Then, do you think this would set the limits?”

The young prince said thoughtfully, “I’ve heard of an ancient cultivation technique that can strengthen our small world, until it surpasses the limits of the four supreme laws.”

The young mentor smiled and continued, “There’s indeed such an ancient technique, but it can only strengthen your small world in a limited way. That’s not the correct path.”

“Oh?” The young prince was surprised by the response, becoming much humbler. He seemed eager to learn the real answer.

“This is exactly what I’m going to teach you today.”

The young mentor added with a smile, “The Ancestral Gods of the Heaven Path Institute created a set of secret cultivation techniques years ago, which redefined the limits God Warriors can reach. This set of secret cultivation techniques allows you to own multiple small worlds!”

“Multiple small worlds?” Everybody was stunned.

“Exactly. You can create another small world within your small world. Combined worlds would be much more powerful than any single world!”

The young mentor continued with a smile, “However, such cultivation technique requires great talent and diligence. Succeeding would make you far stronger than your peers, but if you fail, it would be a huge waste of time.”

Build another world within the original small world…

Everybody was dumbfounded by the concept, feeling that a new gate was being opened before them, revealing infinite, unimaginable splendors behind it. It was a path they had never thought of.

“Is it really possible? If we do that, won’t our original small world be torn apart?” asked the now excited young prince.

“Your cultivation is what matters. Nothing will happen if you cultivate appropriately, but making mistakes in your cultivation may lead to horrible results, like self-destruction,” said the young mentor solemnly, “This is the cultivation technique that the Heaven Path Institute teaches you. Look carefully… These are multiple small worlds.”

He pointed with one of his fingers, and a spherical space appeared in midair. There seemed to be an ocean of stars in it.

Within that world—another small world showed up, filled with infinite flames.

A third small world collapsed and appeared in the middle of the infinite flames; inside there was nothing but lightning and desolation.

“There are three difficulties regarding the multiplication of small worlds. Firstly, you must establish a small world within your small world, which means that you must break the laws in the original small world. You have to fully understand one of the laws you mastered, in order to create a unique world with it! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“The second difficulty is to make the two small worlds compatible, so that their force fields will enhance each other, instead of offsetting and weakening each other.

“The third difficulty is to master the force fields and various laws of different small worlds. You won’t experience this until you start to condense your second small world.”

Seeing how shocked and solemn everybody was, the young mentor said, “This cultivation technique is meant to break your limits. It’s very difficult; however, you will benefit greatly if you master it. Even if you only create a second small world, you will still be far stronger than your peers. You’ll be able to crush them easily! If you establish three small worlds… you can defeat the strongest of your level with one casual attack. The princes and princesses of your clans are the best in their level and very close to the limit, but they are as vulnerable as babies to those who own triple small worlds.”

The expressions of two young nobles changed once he said that. Given their status as descendants of major clans, they had always been the leaders in their generation, and had almost reached the limits of the God Warrior State. They had been trying to condense the four supreme laws to build the strongest small world, all to be able to defeat anyone at their level.

However, that was just the first limit in the Heaven Path Institute!

“Well… If I may ask, how many small worlds can a person create in total?” asked the young prince with a humble tone, dropping all of his arrogance.

The young mentor smiled and replied, “Your high ambition is worth complimenting, but don’t aim too high. A lot of descendants like you are very talented. Some are even geniuses listed on the Chaos Rank. However, very few have condensed three small worlds. Still, in the long history of our institute, a lot of unparalleled geniuses have been able to rise further. One of them condensed seven small worlds while being a God Warrior!”

“Seven?”

Everyone’s faces changed due to shock.

Three small worlds were enough to beat the limits of the God Warrior level. Seven small worlds were already unimaginable. It wasn’t hard to tell how vulnerable other God Warriors would be to them!

“The unusual genius who condensed seven small worlds is now one of the Ancestral Gods of this institute. A lot of grandmasters will notice you if any of you condenses five small worlds. You’ll be able to learn a lot more things from them, including cultivation techniques that are more mysterious and powerful,” said the young mentor with an encouraging and provoking smile.

Everybody became excited, but they soon calmed down. They realized that the young teacher, who had only condensed three small worlds, was already a mentor in the Heaven Path Institute. It wasn’t hard to imagine how hard it would be to condense five small worlds.

I didn’t know that there was such a cultivation technique for Star Lords…

Su Ping, on the other hand, was thrilled, feeling that the trip had been absolutely worth it.

He had never heard of such a cultivation theory in the Federation.

His master, Shen Huang, had never mentioned anything of the sort. He would have taught him if he knew of it, as it was unnecessary to keep it a secret. After all, the cultivation technique was extremely difficult; normal people might not even grasp the basics.

It seems that this cultivation theory doesn’t exist in the Federation. I should be able to crush any Star Lord in the Federation if I can condense a second small world…?Su Ping thought.

He had challenged the top warrior on the Divine Lord Rank. Although he failed, he had detected that the person had only released a small world.

The four supreme laws are just the first limit, but it’s already extremely rare for anyone to grasp all four of them. The path of cultivation is indeed long. There are still limits beyond limits…?Su Ping’s eyes glittered with hope. He looked forward to what he might grow into. He even wondered about the Ancestral God who condensed seven small worlds; what kind of extraordinary person he must have been when he was young.
