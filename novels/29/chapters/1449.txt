Chapter 1450 Refusal (1)

Su Ping turned around and saw a blue-skinned woman with a streamlined body. Unlike other humanoids, she had a curly-looking crown on her head; it was deeply attached to her body, as if it were part of her flesh.

An Ancestral God…

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. The woman was emitting such a powerful pressure that all the blue humanoids were eclipsed, just like a queen rising to her throne.

“Goddess Selvega!”

The God Emperors of their race quickly bowed, their bodies emitting a dim blue light from their chest to their heads. Showing their machine core was their way of showing the greatest respect.

Su Ping removed his disguise, as he had already been seen through. His body began to crack; instead of turning into a human being, he turned into an almost ten-meter giant emitting the ancient aura of chaos. That was the real look of his Primitive Chaos Clan bloodline.

The humanoid God Emperors had shock on their faces, not expecting Su Ping’s original self to be as intimidating. Although his power was beneath Goddess Selvega, he still brought forth a sense of threat.

“The Chaos clan…”

The woman changed her expression a bit. Blue circles of light flashed in her eyes, as if examining his body through a secret technique. Su Ping exposed himself openly, simply letting her observe as a show of sincerity and willingness to establish an alliance. Oftentimes alliances could never see the light because the two parties couldn’t agree on mutual interests.

“Why are you here? Are you going to involve us in a war?” The woman stared at Su Ping, shedding all hostility as she didn’t sense any ill will from Su Ping. However, his visit was an extremely terrible sign.

“Senior, why do you think that?”

Her answer surprised him. Does she have divination powers? Why would she know the reason I came here?

However, divinations were just calculations based on the operation of the Great Dao. Considering Su Ping’s ability, he could predict everybody’s fate in his universe, since he could look at the end of time.

However, such predictions were probably not applicable in other universes, due to the blockage of the different universe barriers. At the very least, he would need some time to observe.

There was no such thing as divination in the world. All results were fixed and could be observed.

“The chaos clan was arrogant in the past, nearly going extinct in the ancient war. You must be one of the survivors… You didn’t sneak into our territory just to find shelter, did you?” said the woman coldly.

Su Ping asked, “Senior, you seem to know the chaos clan very well, don’t you?”

“Of course. After the chaos clan was destroyed and the age of chaos ended, we were the second batch of lives born right after the gods who inherited your legacy of arrogance. However, we attach more importance to history and know you better than the gods do,” said the woman coldly.

Su Ping was rather surprised, not expecting her to know about the gods as well.

He asked in a hurry, “Senior, if you know of the gods, do you know how far from here is the Archean Divinity?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If he could find the Archean Divinity and the Heaven Path Institute, he could at least entrust the lives kept in his universe to the Heaven Path Institute for protection; that way he would again be able to cultivate in peace.

“I don’t know,” said the woman coldly, “The Empyrean is vast and boundless. Who knows where the Archean Divinity is? They should be hiding if they’re smart enough. However, those arrogant fellows probably don’t know the importance of keeping a low profile and met their doom already.”

Su Ping instantly asked, “The Empyrean? Do you mean the Realm of Heavens beyond the universes? Then, you should know who ended the age of chaos, right?”.

“Other than the Heavens, who else?” The woman stared at Su Ping. “You don’t seem to know your history well, considering that you’re a descendant of the chaos clan. Have you forgotten how your ancestors died?”

“It’s been such a long time ago. Many things were lost,” said Su Ping, “I’d really appreciate it if you could tell me, senior.”

“Ha. The world has truly changed. To think that a member of the chaos clan would be so humble… I’m even starting to wonder if the history I saw is real.” The woman chuckled with mockery in her eyes. “Better give up trying to get us involved in your war. We’re living in seclusion; we didn’t seek anyone’s protection when the war took place, and we will not participate in anyone else’s war.”

Su Ping felt rather speechless. She had turned him down before he could even broach the subject of the alliance.

Seeing that her guess was right, the woman sneered and said, “For the sake of you being part of the chaos clan, the origin of everything, I won’t give you a hard time. Go back where you came from, and I’ll consider that this never happened.”

“Senior, according to what I’ve heard, were you attacked by the Heavens too?” Su Ping didn’t give a direct answer. He tried to change the subject.

“That’s right. It’s a good thing that the Supreme Heavenly Dao wasn’t alarmed, or we would have been annihilated,” said the woman, “We’re living a great life right now; we won’t fight another war.”

“Senior, Indeed I came here with the intention of establishing an alliance with you.” Su Ping stared at her. He thought for a moment and decided to face the problem with the most sincere attitude. “My hometown was invaded by the Heavens and nearly got destroyed. However, I know that there are many more universes and powerful species that have also been ravaged by the Heavens.”
