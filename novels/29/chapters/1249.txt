Chapter 1251 The Heaven Suppressing Tower (2)

“You’re forcing me to use the Heaven Suppressing Tower!”

The Saint King flipped a hand; a gray stone tower appeared and expanded. It was plain-looking at the beginning, but it soon unleashed the pressure of a ferocious beast. Su Ping could feel how terrifying the tower was, even though he was inside Shen Huang’s small universe. His mind and soul were in

awe.

“What a great treasure!” Ye Chen’s eyes glittered. He was rather astonished, not expecting that the old man would have such a great treasure.

Shen Huang slightly changed his expression and swung his saber again.

Waves of auras emerged in the void, caused by laws and grand paths. However, the waves were covered by the stone tower and were being swallowed.

The tower flew like a shuttle; its dark bottom pressed close to Shen Huang.

The latter swung his saber consecutively and launched terrifying auras, which were swallowed by a black hole located underneath the tower; they only slowed the tower down a

bit.

“It’s useless; my ultimate treasure can suppress Celestials. It is said that it even suppressed the mysterious ‘Heavens’ back in the ancient times, and they must have been as strong as universe dominators,” said the Saint King. It was one of his ultimate treasures; it was rare for him to use it.

Having such a treasure had earned him the name Saint King, who was superior to the twelve Celestials. He oversaw the Planet of Origin and nobody disobeyed him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Shen Huang was still swinging his saber in a gloomy yet unhurried manner, further slowing down the Heaven Suppressing Tower. It was still approaching him at a high speed, but he managed to buy himself a couple of seconds.

Right when the tower was about to hit himShen Huang flipped a hand and darted out a shadow.

The Saint King saw this; it was a black bone.

A bone?

Exactly at that moment—the tower swallowed the object, then it suddenly slowed down and came to a stop.

The Saint King was slightly dazed, feeling that the tower couldn’t move any further.

He had owned the tower for hundreds of thousands of years and nurtured it with his blood and essence. It was a shame that the tower’s level was too high; he had never been able to cultivate a new tower spirit after the old man had perished.

What’s going on? Is it full? The Saint King was familiar with the tower’s operations. Even though it was powerful, it would always take some time to rest after having consumed enough food.

Such rests could last from ten to a thousand years.

“That bone…” The Saint King realized what was wrong

Shen Huang was slightly relieved to see that the tower had been stopped. He was regretful, but at the same time he felt somewhat lucky. That bone belonged to a certain corpse he had found. The being had very likely reached the universe dominator level or higher when they were alive. He was paralyzed by the lingering aura when he first saw the corpse, and even had to kneel before the corpse for three hundred years before he finally overcame the fear.

He was already a Celestial on top of the pyramid back then.

No one knew that a lofty Celestial everyone looked up to had once been on his knees for three hundred years in front of a corpse. Once ready to leave that corpse, he summoned all his courage to pick up that bone, which had been lying to one side; he had studied it for a long time and learned a lot, but he was forced to give it up to survive just then.

“Why is your treasure not moving?” Ye Chen asked curiously when he passed by the Saint King.

The latter said with a gloomy tone, “It’s full.”

He retrieved the tower after replying.

Ye Chen also realized that something seemed to be wrong with the tower; his temporary ally didn’t seem to be playing tricks. No more words were said; he took out three runes, ignited them and then swung them out; three black chains instantly darted forward.

Shen Huang slightly changed his expression and swung his saber to parry.

However, the chains seemed to be illusory; they avoided the saber’s edge and tied Shen Huang up. “These are the Chains of Feelings; they can’t be cut apart!” Ye Chen smiled after seeing that Shen Huang was trapped; those chains were some of the best ultimate treasures in his arsenal. Even Celestials could be ensnared if they weren’t met with weapons that countered them.

“Holy Realm, Heavenly Wolf Spear!”

A magnificent universe appeared behind the Saint King. Light and Dao Patterns were condensed to spiral and form a spear at the center, which then darted out.

The long spear crossed the void; its aura alone would have made a planet collapse.

Shen Huang’s face changed. He waved a hand and formed a golden shield.

The golden shield had the vivid face of a pretty girl; she then opened her eyes and her expression was hideous as she bared sharp fangs to bite the long spear.

But the next moment—the long spear went through her mouth and she let out a scream.

The shield was broken, and Shen Huang’s chest was hit.

Ye Chen dashed forward and stabbed with a long spear while unleashing his small universe. His move summoned the illusion of a universe that appeared right at the tip of the spear. Su Ping suddenly shouted, “Watch out!” He drew his sword at the same time and slashed with the burning power of chaos.

Shen Huang was going to resist the attack when he heard Su Ping’s cry. He was dazed for a moment, but then the scorching sunlight around him burst out like a nuclear explosion.

A shadow was revealed behind Shen Huang’s back when the blast was spread out, and was flung back by the blast. Meanwhile, Su Ping’s sword aura hit him and cut him apart.

“Damn it!”

The shadow retreated several thousand meters. Dark organs were still moving energetically inside his torn chest. His body was gradually healing.

“Dao Patterns? He has mastered Dao Patterns while still being a mere Star Lord? He must not be kept alive!” It was a slim man in strange armor holding a dagger; his lips were black and his face cold. He too was a Celestial expert.

Ye Chen was greatly relieved to see him. “You’re here too. Great.”

“He’s been hit by my Nether Blade. He’s doomed; just stall him,” said the man coldly.

Ye Chen looked at Shen Huang, noticing that there was an unhealable wound on the latter’s abdomen. The edge of the wound was of an eye-catching black color, contrasting with Shen Huang’s golden brilliance.

“Master!”

Inside the small universe-Su Ping was shocked and infuriated to see Shen Huang’s wound.

“I’m fine.” Shen Huang covered his wound and glanced at it. He then looked up at the man who had ambushed him. “Are all the people of the Doom Star Zone as unscrupulous as you?”

“The Doom Star Zone has a tough environment; we endure cosmic radiation all the time and resources are always scarce. It’s only natural that we make the best use of our

powers.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Indeed, the man was a Celestial from the Doom Star Zone. He looked at Shen Huang indifferently and said, “You should know how my Nether Saber works; it used to be a universe dominator’s weapon. Unfortunately, it lost the soul hunting function; no Celestial would have been safe otherwise!”

Shen Huang took a deep breath and said, “Let me be the first one to try it then.”

“Ha. The Sword God who was killed by his saber said the same thing. Alas, his sword wasn’t as sharp as my saber!” said the man with a sneer.

“What a great weapon,” remarked the Saint King after assessing the Nether Saber.

Shen Huang suddenly said to Su Ping, “Little

Su.”

While dazed, Su Ping said, “Master, you should just run. You can’t unleash your full power now that I’m in your small universe. You should be capable of running away.”

“I won’t die,” Shen Huang said calmly, “My clone is in the Celestial Court. It’s just a Heavenly Lord though, but he’ll be safe while protected by my Celestial artifacts. I can rise to the Celestial State again!

“I will break the barriers of this universe with all the power in my body and teleport you to the Celestial Court.

“However, the distance is too far for me to navigate with precision. There might be errors.”

Shen Huang added calmly, “Rush to your store once you get to the Celestial Court. Your planet is not protected by my artifacts; I can’t use them to stop the enemy. You’ll have to rely on yourself.”
