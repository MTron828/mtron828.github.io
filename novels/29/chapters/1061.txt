Chapter 1062: Heather

“I’ll try my best. But we don’t have connections in the Archean Divinity. It should be simple if we seek the help of an Ancestral God; someone of that caliber can find the Archean Divinity’s stray fragment and take it to its original place with ease.”

Su Ping knew it was difficult to accomplish the task soon. His only hope was to win the favor of someone important in the Heaven Path Institute to later find a chance to talk. He was going to take the Little Skeleton and the other pets to the Demigod Burial, which was the safest cultivation site for him. While he trained, his pets could look for their own opportunities.

“Time to go.”

Su Ping instantly set off after everything was settled.

The familiar feeling of teleportation was felt again. Su Ping opened his eyes again; the familiar aura and assorted enemies made him realize he had indeed reached the Demigod Burial.

They had landed on a green meadow in the wild. Joanna said, “Wait for a moment. My original self and Heather, one of the Superior Gods, are on their way.”

Su Ping was rather flattered by the treatment. “A Superior God is on her way to welcome us?”

“To welcome you, mainly.”

Joanna said solemnly, “You’re of critical importance for us right now, so you’ll receive the best treatment. You’ll meet the other three Superior Gods soon.”

Su Ping felt slightly nervous despite his usual boldness; he had never met four Celestial State experts at the same time!

Before Su Ping could open his mouth again—ripples surfaced in the air, and then two women quietly arrived in the sky above the meadow.

Su Ping immediately felt that the environment had become warm and peaceful. Even the wind seemed to have been silenced at the moment.

All the energy and laws in the air were also frozen, no longer wandering in disarray.

Su Ping felt surprised by all the changes; he raised his head and became utterly fascinated; so much that his heart was pounding.

Two tall, slim and beautiful goddesses were floating in midair. They were covered in sacred light, preventing all eyes from seeing them directly; the only things that could be seen were their eyes, which were deep and clear, as if able to see through anything. Their eyes alone were stunningly beautiful.

Su Ping felt that their eyes were talking; the two goddesses were gorgeous in different ways. One of them was serene and gentle, while the other was proud and intimidating.

Time seemed to have frozen at the moment, and the pair of goddesses had remained silent. Su Ping didn’t realize until a moment later that he was absent-minded because of them.

Damn it, they’re even more attractive than me.?Su Ping felt rather awful, but then he found an excuse.?Good thing they’re females.

“This is Heather, a Superior God.”

The proud and intimidating goddess introduced her partner to Su Ping.

He was surprised. Judging from her tone, she was none other than Joanna.

She didn’t look identical to the Joanna standing next to him, but their voices were rather similar. He was only surprised because Joanna’s original self seemed even more intimidating than the Superior God next to her.

The Superior God, on the other hand, seemed rather serene and gentle. She was not intimidating at all; instead, she exuded a benevolent air.

“You must be the human genius Anna mentioned. You do look extraordinary.” Heather had been wearing a smile the whole time. Her voice was as gentle and clear as a spring bird too, making everybody feel warm and cozy.

“Senior, as expected of a Superior God, you do have the best aesthetics,” said Su Ping to return the compliment.

Joanna—the one standing next to Su Ping—twitched her lips.?What are you talking about?

Heather was also stunned for a moment. Then, she chuckled. “Anna mentioned that you can access the Archean Divinity. Is that right?”

“That is correct.” Su Ping nodded.

“Little Anna has told me everything.”

“We’re now studying in the Heaven Path Institute located in the Archean Divinity. We may be able to ask an Ancestral God to take this place back to the Archean Divinity if we win the favor of someone important in the Heaven Path Institute. This way we could help you return to your hometown.”

Joanna’s original self gave a slight nod at Heather to validate Su Ping’s statement.

Joanna, who was next to Su Ping, gloomily asked, “What do you mean by Little Anna?” She unconsciously held her head high, making her breasts appear even more prominent.

Su Ping’s heart raced. He quickly explained, “You’re the reincarnation. Aren’t you Little Anna? Your original self is Big Anna.”

Su Ping withdrew his gaze from her breasts as he talked, unconsciously glancing at her original self. He secretly gasped, thinking he wasn’t wrong at all to distinguish them by sizes.

“Hey, you!”

Joanna’s original self noticed Su Ping’s covert glance. The man was apparently even bolder than she had expected.

She glared at Su Ping, as she wanted him to be more serious.

“You two seem quite close.” Heather chuckled as she observed the situation unfold. She seemed to be quite gentle; there was no telling what she was thinking.

Joanna blushed for a moment, realizing her implication; then she glared at the other woman. “Let’s talk about business. He’s here because he needs your help. I’ve informed you of the situation. Try to help him, so that we can return to the Archean Divinity sooner.”

Su Ping was surprised to see Joanna daring to glare at a Superior God. Then, he realized that Joanna’s original self was the strongest goddess in the Demigod Burial, except for the Superior Gods!

She would have been considered as one of the best Heavenly Lords, back in the Federation.

In conclusion, the Superior Gods might not even be able to defeat her.

I didn’t know she was this strong,?Su Ping thought, clearly impressed. All the top Heavenly Lords were geniuses; their kind was even rarer than those in the Celestial State.

“I understand.”

Heather pursed her lips and smiled, as if she found the situation interesting.

She had been somewhat skeptical after hearing Joanna’s briefing, even though Joanna had sworn on her Divine Seal; she didn’t think there could be such a human being.

However, she gradually accepted that the human was indeed extraordinary, considering how quickly he had snapped out of his stupor after meeting her.

“Let’s go to the central temple; they’re all waiting for us,” said Heather with a smile.

Joanna nodded.

Su Ping didn’t object; he was curious about the other Superior Gods too.

Heather took action soon after. Su Ping instantly saw strange waves in space. Joanna’s original self moved him and her reincarnation to her side, then stepped into the strange waves. Su Ping quickly saw that the deeper spaces around him had turned into a sharp spike, and something seemed to have been rolled from the second layer to the eight.

They were still standing in the original spot once the rolling started, as if stabilized by some sort of force. Then, the space around them moved quickly, taking them somewhere.

I didn’t know it was possible to teleport like this.?Su Ping was indeed astonished; it was an eye-opener. He had rarely seen such a move in battle.

He would often die too quickly for him to see how Ascendants and Celestials killed him.

“Can you teach me this teleportation technique?” asked the curious Su Ping straight away.

The purpose of his trip was to learn and become stronger. So, he didn’t care about his pride. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Heather smiled. “It’s a simple technique, but you must fully master the law of space first.”

“I’ve already mastered it.”

“I’ll teach you later, then.”

“Thank you.”

Su Ping was surprised, given that the Superior God was unexpectedly nice.

He remembered something, and asked Joanna’s original self. “You said that your original self was stranded somewhere. Was the problem solved?”

Joanna’s original self was even prettier. Her long blond hair gave her quite the mature image; she wore an exquisite adornment that looked like a drop of water on her forehead. Adding her eyes and aura, she could easily impress anyone as a seasoned warrior.

Su Ping was able to also get a closer look at Heather. She was as gorgeous as a painting. However, her aura was different from Joanna’s; she was like a caring mother who was gentle and serene. Still, Su Ping keenly detected her hidden intimidation when she rolled her eyes sometimes.

“Yes. A few Superior Gods helped me. Speaking of which, it’s partly thanks to you.” Joanna looked at Su Ping peacefully.

Su Ping knew what she meant; she probably would have had to work on the problem on her own if it weren’t for the Archean Divinity.

Heather smiled and said, “We tried very hard to address the problem. After all, we have to take care of our entire world all the time. The space species have become more aggressive as of late. We won’t have to worry about them if we can return to the Archean Divinity.”

“Space species?” Su Ping immediately remembered the Void Bug he had subdued, which was an invader to the Demigod Burial; it could eat gods and generate divine power. That was indeed unusual..
