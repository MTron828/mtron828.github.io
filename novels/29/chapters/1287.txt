Chapter 1288 Return to the Heavenly Path Institute (1)

“He blew up his universe and destroyed his potential. What a shame. There’s no research value left…” mumbled the senior god as he looked at the shattered space and examined the surroundings. He didn’t find any aura of vitality, thus confirming that the boy had been obliterated, without a chance to resurrect.

“Let this time and space be your grave. You were an unparalleled genius, and deserve a proper burial!” The God Warrior waved a hand, and the dozens of square kilometers where Su Ping was caged collapsed, turning into a land of darkness and silence. The place would become a forbidden area in the years to come; all incoming substances would be destroyed.

That would continue until another God Warrior decided to take action and cleaned up the place.

Once the deed was done, the God Emperor turned around and disappeared into the void.

Back in the Rain Clan territory

On the highest peak.

“You’re back,” said the Rain Emperor as he looked at the middle-aged man returning.

The middle-aged man said calmly, “He was indeed an unparalleled genius; it’s a shame he wasn’t one of us. He blew up his small universe. I already killed him. I wanted to capture him alive but couldn’t.”

“His small universe?”

Dazed, the Rain Emperor asked, “Has he reached the God King level?”

Although God Kings were nothing in his eyes, they were actually powerhouses in the vast Archean Divinity!

That human was cultivating in the Heaven Path Institute a while back. How long did it take for him to become a God King?

“Nope.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The middle-aged man shook his head with regret in his eyes; even though he had been determined to go for the kill, he actually felt sorry after the fact. He said, “He wasn’t a God King, but he was stronger than normal God Kings. If he were, I probably would have had to use my real strength to finish him off.”

“He condensed a small universe before he became a God King?” The Rain Emperor couldn’t understand, but he knew his cousin wasn’t a liar. He fell silent.

At that moment-a golden-armored figure dashed over and knelt in the void. “Report!” “What is it?” asked the Rain Emperor, frowning because of the interruption.

The golden-armored soldier quickly replied, “Elder Yuan asked me to report that the young human that Emperor Que just killed was revived on the east continent!”

“What?”

The Rain Emperor was stunned.

The middle-aged man’s eyes widened. “Are you sure?”

He couldn’t believe the news. Then, he wondered if Elder Yuan was going senile and made a mistake.

He had already confirmed the guy’s death. How could the guy reappear on the east continent?

It was a really distant place. Unless he was a God Emperor who could break the walls of space in the Archean Divinity, it would be impossible for him to teleport to another continent, let alone if he truly were a God King!

The overlord recovered from the shock and looked at the middle-aged man.

The latter furrowed his eyebrows and said, “I’m sure I killed him. This situation is uncanny; did I only kill his clone? Impossible. Did Elder Yuan really find him? I need to speak to him in person.”

The Rain Emperor didn’t think he was lying; no God Emperor would lie about such a trivial matter. He nodded and said, “There might be other reasons. I’ll go with you.”

The middle-aged man couldn’t help but look at the other, not expecting him to pay so much attention to a human junior. It was crazy enough to deploy an emperor.

“Okay.”

While they went to talk to Elder Yuan-in a forest on the east continent…

Su Ping’s figure was reconstituted in that place. He looked around and was glad not to see the middle-aged man. So, he went about resurrecting the young Chaos Beast, the Inferno Dragon and his other pets.

The cauldron woman and the sutra old manboth shattered—were recreated by Su Ping

too.

Having acknowledged him as master, they belonged to him and were protected by the rules of resurrection. That was why he had dared to take them there.

“Weren’t we dead?”

The cauldron woman touched herself and was shocked to find herself complete.

The sutra old man was also shocked, as he had clearly sensed how he was ripped apart. But somehow, he had been fixed?

Is my memory just an illusion?

Su Ping didn’t explain; he simply threw them into the storage space and also retrieved his pets. Then he took out the badge, only to find that it wasn’t glittering; he could only unleash the universe of chaos and detonate it again to blow himself up.

Let’s see what the deep spaces of the Archean Divinity look like, thought Su Ping, since he became curious while in the process of exploding. He unleashed the power of his self-explosion toward the deep spaces of the Archean Divinity.

The deep spaces were torn open. He somehow felt that he reached the limit when the explosion reached the seventh layer.

The deep spaces of the Archean Divinity are clearly harder than those in my world. Also, there doesn’t seem to be any danger here, only greater pressure.

After his consciousness disappeared, Su Ping went for a random resurrection again.

This time, he reappeared in the high sky. He looked around but didn’t see any signs of life. He immediately took out the badge and found that it had a hazy silver light.

“Have I finally arrived?” Su Ping felt delighted. He injected divine power into the badge to activate it.

A space portal appeared soon after and Su Ping simply stepped in.
