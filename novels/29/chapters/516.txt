Chapter 517 Legend the Drunken

Su Ping had no problem with Qin Duhuang going with them. He told Xie Jinshui to lead the way and summoned the Dark Dragon Hound which he told to take the dragon form.

The radiant dragon body was covered with golden scales, full of majestic and heavenly might.

Su Ping hopped onto the Dark Dragon Hound and invited Xie Jinshui and Qin Duhuang to take a seat next to him.

Both were aware that this battle pet was as vicious as a beast king. They hesitated, clearly fearful of the battle pet

But considering they could not lose any time, they immediately flew up to land on the battle.

Su Ping told the Dark Dragon Hound to fly as quickly as it could.

The pet didn’t fool around with Su Ping this time; it flew like a dragon, quickly leaving the shantytown area and then the base city.

“Sir, please show us the way,” Su Ping said to Xie Jinshui.

Xie Jinshui was still amazed by the battle pet’s fast speed. “Of course.” He nodded.

Once they were outside the base city, Su Ping stood on the back of the Dark Dragon Hound and looked down. There was still a large pile of dead wild beasts that had begun to rot due to the hot weather. There wasn’t enough time to clear up all the corpses.

The ground was covered with dried blood which had turned into a dark brown color, leaving a burnt mark on the ground.

The area was so saturated with blood that not even a drop could seep into the dirt anymore.

Su Ping squinted. A glint of sharpness flashed past his eyes.

“Sir, please clear up the corpses and burn off the ones that you cannot clean up. The festering bodies can produce contagious diseases,” Su Ping warned.

Xie Jinshui and Qin Duhuang were pondering about the same thing as they gazed at the gruesome view outside the base city. Xie Jinshui nodded. “I understand. We’re still clearing up the area, but I do believe that the rest of the corpses must be burned; moving them takes too much time. I know that there are advanced wild beasts that have quite a good amount of valuable parts we can harvest, and it would be a shame to give them up. On the other hand, if some viruses emerged from the corpses and the wind took them to the base city, we would have to deal with another disaster altogether.”

Qin Duhuang agreed.

The clean-up operation was taking a long time because they were harvesting the valuable parts from the wild beasts.

Too many advanced beasts had died in the war. Two days were not enough for them to go through all of the corpses, which was why the wilderness was still filled with them.

The Dark Dragon Hound whooshed away in the sky. They gradually became unable to see corpses as they traveled. Xie Jinshui would point the direction and Su Ping would instruct the Dark Dragon Hound.

The Tower. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It was a sacred place where all the legendary battle pet warriors of the world gathered.

The Tower had no branch offices and the location of this mysterious place was only known by a few. It was located on a plain and snow-capped mountain near the Subcontinent District’s Nordic region. The snow would never melt. Just a few wild beasts could be spotted on the snowy plain; there rarely was any other sign of life. It was basically an uncultivated land.

After crossing half of the Subcontinent District, Su Ping and his party had finally arrived at the snow-capped mountain.

“That is where the Tower is.” Xie Jinshui gazed at the towering, snow-capped mountain. The sharp peak of the snow-capped mountain reached the sky, surrounded by large black clouds at the top. It was snowing at the moment.

Qin Duhuang seemed to be marveling at the view. “I didn’t know that the Tower was right in our Subcontinent District. I had only heard that our Subcontinent District was the closest to the Tower.”

“It is said that the founder of the Tower was a legendary battle pet warrior of our Subcontinent District. So, this location was chosen because of it,” Xie Jinshui explained.

“Let’s go.” Su Ping was losing his patience. He urged the Dark Dragon Hound to go ahead.

The Dark Dragon Hound flew away. The snow-capped mountain grew larger and larger in their perspective.

Soon, they were inside the mountain. Large snowflakes fell from the gray sky, like feathers.

“That is the gate,” Xie Jinshui pointed.

Su Ping and Qin Duhuang looked toward the peak of the snow-capped mountain. There stood a massive gate that carried some mysterious feeling.

There was a meandering path that went from the gate to the base of the mountain. The strange thing was that the path was clear of all snow while the snow was falling heavily.

Suddenly, a seemingly drunk man said, “Who are you, ignorant fools? This isn’t a place for you.” While he sounded drunk, he did not fail to convey a cold demeanor.

It seemed that the voice could have originated from any direction and it was echoing around the mountain.

“A legendary battle pet warrior!” Qin Duhuang could tell that the man was of the same rank. He didn’t expect to meet a legendary battle pet warrior so soon upon their arrival.

Xie Jinshui, on the other hand, was better prepared. “Legend the Drunken, nice to meet you. I am Xie Jinshui, mayor of the Longjiang Base City.”

“Longjiang?” The man sounded unhappy. “I think you were here a couple of days ago.”

“Yes. I was here to ask for help last time and this trip is to inquire about an herb.” Xie Jinshui nodded. The mention of the previous visit clouded his face.

All of a sudden, wind and snow began to dance and formed a ball. After the snowflakes were dispersed, an old man sitting on a huge gourd was revealed.

That old man wore rags which left his chest exposed. He looked at the three from the corner of his eye. Suddenly, he noticed the Heaven Expansion Dragon that they were standing on. He recognized that it wasn’t an ordinary battle pet.

“Interesting.”

Soon, the old man realized that Qin Duhuang was at the legendary rank.

“Are you a new one?” the drunk old man asked.

Qin Duhuang nodded. “My name is Qin Duhuang. I’ve just broken through.”

The drunk old man nodded. He could tell that Qin Duhuang was still immature at this rank.

The drunk old man looked less tense since a legendary battle pet warrior was in the mix. “Are you here to report? Good. You are daring enough to shoulder the great responsibility of protecting humanity.”

Qin Duhuang said some humble words in reply.

“All right now, come in,” the drunk old man said to Xie Jinshui, “I won’t accuse you of anything now that you’re here with a legendary battle pet warrior. You walked up the mountains according to the rules on your previous visit. You’re not behaving this time.”

Xie Jinshui smiled an embarrassed smile but didn’t attempt to talk back.

He understood that walking up the mountain was the rule.

And yet, he knew that Su Ping was in a hurry and flying over on a pet would be pardoned since Qin was a legendary battle pet warrior.

The drunk old man vanished into thin air again, without leaving a trace.

Qin Duhuang could not figure out how the old man disappeared, which startled him. The confidence he had just built up after reaching the legendary rank had been crushed somewhat. Even a guard at the gate of the Tower was that terrifying. Indeed, the legendary battle pet warriors’ abilities varied.

“Let’s go,” Xie Jinshui said.

A glow burst out from the door and a swirl appeared inside the door. The Tower was just beyond that swirl.
