Chapter 1072: One Finger

Su Ping extended part of his consciousness to touch the source of lightning.

His head immediately rumbled, and plenty of laws of lightning were transmitted to him, directly taught by the source of lightning. Technically, it wasn’t teaching; it was more like stealing.

All sorts of laws of lightning appeared one after the other.

Su Ping instantly realized why it was easy to grasp laws in the Source World; he could easily master everything he touched!

Furthermore, it didn’t even seem difficult to achieve perfection.

Perfection was a barrier.

Like Heather said, it was merely a key.

He would quickly soar if he found the key and entered the Source World!

If he was strong in one aspect, he would be as strong in others!

This place is indeed slightly different from the Federation’s domains…

Why are all the path sources gathered here? Is this the deepest part of the world?

Su Ping was deep in thought while learning the path of lightning.

Very soon, the lightning source seemed to have realized that Su Ping was stealing. It struggled and flew away.

Su Ping was slightly surprised to find that the path sources were dodging him.

He didn’t give up, and quickly extended his consciousness. He felt that his path of lightning would be perfected if he completely absorbed the lightning source.

All the path sources around him seemed to have detected an intruder when Su Ping’s consciousness was spread out; they dispersed and flew to deeper places.

Su Ping was caught unprepared. He thought unbelievable that path sources would act like living entities!

Are paths a type of lifeform too?

Su Ping didn’t give up; he persisted and moved onward. He soon found that the aura of paths around him became abundant and sticky. He somehow was entering an invisible river, and was slowed down by the current; but his senses were also being sharpened.

Path source…

Su Ping was in a trance. The abundant path aura made the surroundings look like a river bed where paths were being born!

He suddenly realized why the place was called Source World.

It was not just the source where paths gathered, but also the spot where paths were born.

If the great paths were born there, did it mean that the place was the center of all worlds?

Su Ping came to a realization while in the middle of the abundant path aura. It was exactly at that moment when he suddenly heard a voice in the distance, as if someone were calling out to him.

The voice gradually approached as he listened carefully. It was a strange language, but Su Ping thought he had heard it somewhere before; he was sure that it wasn’t from the Federation, but from one of the cultivation sites.

He had been to many cultivation sites when he trained pets. Some of the smaller cultivation sites were fragments of bigger cultivation sites, just like the Demigod Burial was part of the Archean Divinity.

He had heard the language in one of the small cultivation sites before.

By then Su Ping recalled that it was the tongue of Asura Kings.

They were an ancient race that had fought for ages against gods in the primordial times.

Su Ping was not that familiar with the Asura Kings’ language. He listened carefully for a moment and finally realized what they meant. But he was puzzled; how could there be Asura Kings in the Source World?

“Hurry up and go…”

They somehow seemed to know him. Why were they telling him to run away?

While he was puzzling things out, he suddenly had goosebumps all over his body. He didn’t feel anything, but his blood was curdling and his body was cold, as if something invisible was approaching him at a quick speed!

What is that?

Su Ping’s heart was racing. Such an uncanny sensation felt as dangerous and terrifying as the pressure given off by Ancestral Gods!

Still, it was different from that godly pressure, irresistible like a falling mountain or a sun.

The pressure he felt at the moment was creepy and scary, as if he had fallen into the hands of a giant that could squeeze him to death at any moment.

What’s in this Source World? Damn it! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Su Ping had an awful look. He didn’t know why the Asura Kings had warned him, or what was approaching him, but he didn’t want to leave just like that. He had accomplished perfection exactly to find a way to establish a third small world in the Source World.

Accomplishing perfection was not his target; establishing a third small world was.

An enormous force pushed him exactly at that moment; he felt that his body was beyond his control. The dispersing laws and paths quickly moved away; the aura around him faded away too. Shortly after, he was seeing things in reality again.

Su Ping was stunned for a moment; he had been ousted from the Source World.

It seemed that the Asura Kings had done something as an attempt to help him.

I can probably go there again. I’m visiting a cultivation site; I can resurrect even if I’m caught in a dangerous situation. I should find out what’s out there exactly,?thought Su Ping.

But he didn’t immediately head back; he looked at the two goddesses instead.

“How about it? Did you see the Source World?”

Joanna knew Su Ping had woken up, seeing that the fire in Su Ping’s eyes had faded away.

Su Ping nodded and immediately asked them, “Have you been to the Source World before? What kind of place is it? I think I encountered a threat back there.”

“You encountered a threat?”

Both Joanna and Heather were rather surprised. Joanna asked in confusion, “Are there dangers in the Source World? Did you enter the deepest parts? I heard that the root of all paths lies in the depths of the Source World; it contains a mysterious power and is being guarded by an unknown entity.”

She glanced at Su Ping and continued, “But you only grasped the path of fire, which should have been too basic for you, to eventually see the end of all paths.”

Heather nodded and asked, “Did you see the guardian of the Source World?”

“The guardian?”

Su Ping was confused.

“I heard this from my grandmother when I was little. It’s said that a very powerful being had attempted to cut the source of paths apart and destroy all universes. Luckily, others noticed it. Many strong experts fought back and secured the Source World.

“People have been watching over the Source World in turns ever since, so that it won’t happen again.”

Heather added, “Once the Source World is cut apart, any person with cultivation below Gods of Rules will lose all power. Gods of Rules would also lose half of their powers. Superior Gods and even Emperor Gods might be influenced too.”

Su Ping was speechless.

Cut the Source World apart? What kind of lunatic would’ve done that?

Also, that kind of power was truly unbelievable!

“I didn’t see clearly, but I think I met two people. One of them helped me, and the other was very dangerous.” Su Ping recounted his experience, hoping to find an answer.

“One of them helped you, and the other tried to kill you?”

Both of them were stunned by his retelling. Only the guardians existed in the Source World; if Su Ping had met them, they should’ve agreed on whether to banish him or to kill him.

“Weird. Did something change in the Source World?” Heather was puzzled. She rolled her eyes and glanced at Joanna. “You’re under the protection of that bigshot. Do you want to take a look?”

Joanna nodded; she was thinking the same thing. A dazzling brilliance emanated from her eyes. Everything in her view faded away, and she entered the Source World.

She opened her eyes a moment later, clearly baffled. “I didn’t feel anything. Are you sure you were in danger?”

Su Ping was stunned. He couldn’t help but ask, “Did you enter a different place?”

Joanna was lost for words. She said, “We’re not much distant from each other; the places we entered should be close.”

Su Ping didn’t think Joanna would lie to him. He didn’t understand; was it an illusion?

He immediately gathered the path of fire in his eyes. Very soon, the world before his eyes zoomed in again and he reentered the Source World; he didn’t see any paths or laws there. All had escaped.

He looked around, planning to go deeper, when he suddenly had a feeling of terror, as if something had locked onto him.

The next moment—an enormous shadow appeared in front of his eyes. It looked like a collapsing mountain!

There were helical patterns and a sharp shell on the mountain, which made it look like a finger!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. He had detected unparalleled strength, and a familiar aura, from the finger.

Bang!

He felt an excruciating pain, which quickly disappeared.

Su Ping returned to the darkness. He had died.

Resurrect!

Su Ping decided to resurrect on the spot.

He saw shock on both Joanna and Heather’s faces when his body was gathered again.

Joanna was shocked because she didn’t expect him to die abruptly. He had obviously been assaulted in the Source World.

Heather was shocked because she witnessed the amazing resurrection again. This time, she found that Su Ping had not been revived with the laws of space and time either; it was a power she couldn’t understand!

“This resurrection costs 100,000 energy points!” The system’s reminder echoed in Su Ping’s head.

He was stunned. A hundred thousand energy points? That was enough for ten trips to the Archean Divinity!

Resurrection had always been charged for one tenth of the ticket fee. He would usually pay two hundred energy points for resurrections in the Demigod Burial.

“Why is it so costly?” Su Ping couldn’t help but ask.

“You died in the Source World, not the Demigod Burial, and that’s why the resurrection cost is different,” replied the system calmly.

Su Ping was taken aback by that..
