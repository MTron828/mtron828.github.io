Chapter 708: Slaying a Fate State Enemy

What a magnificent vibe!

Ji Yuanfeng realized that he still couldn’t tell Su Ping’s level. To be more exact, he had never sensed the unique vibe of a Fate State creature from Su Ping!

But weirdly enough, the astral power that Su Ping released was intimidating even to him; it was so abundant that it felt like a boundless ocean!

Coming back to his senses, Ji Yuanfeng quickly said, “Brother Su, don’t be too proud. Since you’re so capable when it comes to fighting, each of us will take care of one of the top three Fate State enemies!”

“That won’t be necessary. You must kill the other Fate State enemies as soon as possible. Speed is what matters! Don’t forget that the beast tides on the other flanks are awaiting us...” said Su Ping coldly and assertively like a king would.

His eyes, as dark as a bottomless abyss, were filled with the cold air of destruction, which made Ji Yuanfeng feel somewhat awed, so he stopped persuading him.

Yes, he felt awed by Su Ping.

It wasn’t the surging energy from Su Ping that awed him; it was the strange air mixed in that energy. It seemed to be from an ancient life on a more advanced level, which frightened on a cellular level.

While he was in a trance, Su Ping had already roared and taken to the sky.

He stomped on the air, and a terrifying thunder echoed throughout the void!

“Huh?”

“What’s going on? He’s so strong!”

“He’s not at the Fate State, is he?”

All the Fate State Beast Kings that emerged from the beast tide were shocked. Even though Su Ping was small, they couldn’t neglect him.

His energy was so scorching, and yet his vibe wasn’t on the same level as theirs, which was rather weird! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“This snack is interesting. He’s mine!”

One of the peak Fate State wild beasts walked forward, making the ground rumble under his feet.

The wild beast looked like a rhino, only dozens of times bigger. It had pointed fangs in its mouth and white, short horns all over its body. Its overall image made it look sturdy.

It peered down at Su Ping as if it were looking at a piece of delicious cake. Then, it raised its forelegs and stomped.

After several explosions, dragons made of rocks darted from the ground up and went after Su Ping in midair.

The space around Su Ping was completely locked, making it impossible for him to run.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The raging wind that came at Su Ping’s face made his hair dance.

The blowing sand and stones were hitting Su Ping’s face. He suddenly opened his eyes, with brilliant spots of light beaming out. In the next moment, the sword in his hands unleashed a dazzling black light that swallowed all the rays on the battleground!

“Go to hell!!”

The demonic power and the laws of annihilation were triggered as the countless star vortices in Su Ping’s cells exploded. They were all compressed in his sword.

All of a sudden, the ultimate air of destruction was spread out.

The Void Sword slashed forward!

“Oh no!”

“Huh?”

The brutal rhino that had just launched an attack suddenly felt a horrifying aura. Its relaxed expression was quickly replaced by shock and fury.

The other two peak Fate State beast kings behind it were also stunned; they looked at Su Ping in shock.

Bang, bang, bang, bang!

Walls rose one after another in front of the rhino! The rocks which made the walls were quickly crystallized, increasing their defense. The beast opened its mouth and spewed a black, spinning shield during the crystallization process. The shield was only about three meters in diameter and protected the center of its eyebrows, which was where its soul lay.

Su Ping slashed with his sword the moment the black shield appeared.

The clouds in the sky were split up, as if instructed to do so!

His sword cut the air, the ground and space apart!

A terrifying black crack appeared. The space—which could have only been ripped apart by Void State beings with their understanding of space—was brutally torn!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The dozen crystallized walls in front of the rhino were destroyed as if they were paper, even though each of them could have resisted the bombardments of a Void State expert for hours!

Squeak!!

After an ear splitting explosion, something seemed to have been torn apart; the high-pitched soundwaves were spread throughout the battlefield. Many mediocre wild beasts near the rhino bled and died!

The enormous battlefield was caught in a weird moment of silence When the aftershock died down.

Even the unbridled beasts had stopped roaring and grunting.

Boom!

As if a century had passed—even though it was actually only several seconds of silence—another loud noise resounded. Then, to everybody’s shock, the magnificent rhino collapsed!

It was also falling while split into two halves, right from the middle!

Its blood and guts were flowing everywhere. Undigested remains of wild beasts could be seen inside some of the organs.

“Well...”

Ji Yuanfeng, Gu Siping and the others were so astounded by what they were seeing that their eyes were on the verge of bursting.

The man had killed a peak Fate State enemy with one attack!

They felt that everything had been an illusion, or maybe a dream.

The people at the base were just as stupefied; Su Ping’s attack had been too powerful. It silenced the entire battlefield and executed one of the wild beast’s leaders at the same time. Incredible!

The black shield had already cracked; it fell next to the rhino’s body. The formation it had inscribed had also been broken. The ear splitting noise earlier had been caused when it tried to resist Su Ping’s attack, until it failed and was eventually crushed!

All the beast kings were dazed while they stood behind the body.

The Fate State beast kings—which had roamed casually to the front line—were getting chills; they looked at the small young man as if he were a monster!

That had been a Bloodthirsty Giant Rhino, an overlord at the peak of the Fate State. And yet, it had been slain by him with one attack?

Only one attack!

An instant kill!

Has this young man transcended his level?

In a place nearby, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil and the other peak Fate State wild beasts were too shocked to believe it.

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil was the most shocked. It knew that Ji Yuanfeng was the strongest human and quite tricky to deal with in fact. Little did it expect to see someone who was even more horrifying than Ji Yuanfeng!

That guy could easily be compared with the Ocean Emperor! No, he was even more horrifying than the Ocean Emperor!

Hu... Hu...

Su Ping breathed heavily and soon caught his breath. He looked at the Heavenly King of Good and Evil with appalling coldness beaming out of his eyes; that was the strongest of the three peak Fate State enemies.

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil was a dragon covered in black and white scales. It had two heads; its scales weren’t mixed together, since they were used on two different sides of its body, as if having been combined from two dragons. It looked quite uncoordinated, if not hideous.

Su Ping had heard a lot about the Heavenly King of Good and Evil.

He did feel a horrifying vibe after he finally saw it.

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil was a peak Fate State dragon, with the vibe of the undead.

Considering the Asura blood in his body, Su Ping had developed keen senses for all things from the undead. He was able to tell that the Heavenly King was a mixture of a dragon and a demon, both of which were very strong races. No wonder it could be the leader of the four kings!

“You’re next!”

Su Ping approached the Heavenly King of Good and Evil in the air while holding his sword.

He seemed to be challenging all the Fate State wild beasts on the battlefield with nothing but his sword!

The scene was so shocking that too many people in the base cities were at a loss for words.

His straight and lonely back looked like an indestructible wall!

In a certain civilian house in the Longjiang Base City—a woman suddenly covered her mouth and couldn’t stop crying.

She was Li Qingru, Su Ping’s mother.

Recently, Su Ping hadn’t been home much, but the news of what he had done outside and the change in attitude of the five families, including the Qin family, made her realize that her son was no longer what he used to be.

Still... His son was fighting on a battlefield completely on his own!

Which mother could bear watching her son fight that hard?

Su Yuanshan held her in his arms and comforted her, while he watched the TV with a complicated expression.

...

In another base, inside a lofty manor, many Titled warriors and young elites of the Tang family were gathered.

“To think we once tried to make trouble for him!”

They were completely stunned as they saw the video feed on the screen.

Tang Linzhan, who stood in the middle, slightly opened his mouth but didn’t know how to reply to Tang Yuanqing’s remark.

Standing nearby, Tang Ruyu was greatly shocked. She remembered that she had first met Su Ping during the Supremacy League. Back then, she never expected that the young man could grow to such a horrifying degree!

At the same time—

Everybody at the Trainers Association—which had relocated behind the defense lines—was too shocked to talk.

Su Ping had visited the Trainers Association earlier and was eventually certified as a top trainer. However, nobody knew that he was also a legendary warrior, and a top one at that!

...

On the battlefield.

Su Ping quickly approached the Heavenly King of Good and Evil; he was releasing such a strong killing intent that the latter’s eyelids twitched. It couldn’t help but lean back and feel the urge to run. However, it knew the consequences of defection, which made it hold back the urge.

“Let’s attack him together!” the Heavenly King of Good and Evil roared furiously. He had no time to care about his dignity anymore. Duel? Only an idiot would duel with him! Yes, the guy who challenged him first and got killed was an idiot!

They outnumbered him. Why on earth would they fight a one-on-one battle?

When the Heavenly King of Good and Evil roared, the other Fate State wild beasts realized that the man was their greatest foe and they had to take him down as a team.

Nearby, a peak Fate State beast king—which looked like a sea dragon—bellowed,”Finish him!”

It was a gargantuan beast with the body of a whale, the head of a crocodile, and the limbs of a lizard. It opened its mouth and spouted a mouthful of black water.

The black water was smelly and covered up Su Ping like a web the moment it appeared, corrupting and twisting the space around him.

The other Fate State beast kings also released their skills in haste. The horrifying killing techniques of the Fate State level reduced the energy in the area into a chaotic surge.

Close to eight dreadful skills appeared in the sky at the same time, making it look like the arrival of the apocalypse.

Any of those skills would have caused a huge opening on the defense line if it happened to land a hit!

Seeing that the Fate State beast kings had joined forces to attack Su Ping, Ji Yuanfeng was refreshed by the violent energy and changed his expression. If anything happened to Su Ping... it would be impossible for them to stop the beast kings on their own.

“Let’s help!” Ji Yuanfeng roared and charged while in a merged state. He unleashed several tornadoes towards those skills in the sky, hoping to detonate them in advance.

Those skills were all made of energy; their energy structures could be destroyed if they suffered huge impacts; that would cause an early detonation.

“Freeze!”

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil roared when Ji Yuanfeng took action; the tornadoes that the latter released were frozen on the spot, unable to move forward anymore!

It was quite a shocking and unimaginable scene, witnessing how those tornadoes came to a complete stop!

Both Gu Siping and the Deputy Chief were in bad shape. They quickly took action and merged with their battle pets, releasing a powerful vibe.

The Deputy Chief turned his hands upside down and took out a sword before he launched the God Devourer, which he had used in the battle against Su Ping in the Tower!

Golden dragon scales appeared on his body; he was then filled with the gravitas of a dragon.

Shadows were moving in his Force Field right behind him, as if splendid gods were arriving to cover his back.

He used his maximum strength in the first strike. Golden and brilliant sword auras instantly burst out of the sword and ripped the void apart, cutting the many skills horizontally.

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil roared in shock and fury, “Block them!”

The sword aura was powerful and sharp. The pressure that the Heavenly King of Good and Evil released was cut apart; it was completely unable to stop it!

The nearby beast king that looked like a sea dragon bellowed and generated a huge billowing vapor cluster out of nowhere, which surged to counter the sword aura. Water was the softest and most flexible of all things.

The sword aura soon disappeared in the billowing vapor and failed to pass through.

On the other side, Gu Siping roared and unleashed a dazzling spear aura which tore apart the void like lightning, which then appeared in front of all the skills. It immediately stabbed through an ocean of fire and reduced it to a rain of flames.

As he looked at the scene—raining flames, the other skills that filled his eyes, and the Heavenly King of Good and Evil which was staring at him angrily and aggressively—Su Ping stopped walking.

He put away his sword and clenched his fist!

Dazzling golden light radiated from his fist, making it look like a blossoming lotus. Sacred and vast divine energy burst out. In an instant, it seemed as if gods were chanting!

A Force Field appeared behind Su Ping. There were dim shadows of demons inside it and those of gods on the rise. He looked like a god of all gods and a king of kings!

Then, a long-stifled roar echoed throughout the battlefield. “Break!!”

Su Ping punched. His fist aura expanded quickly into a shocking size before it encountered the Fate State skills in the sky!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The world was in chaos. Violent and turbulent energy was spread out. No sounds could be heard because their frequencies were beyond the human sensory threshold.

It wasn’t until a dozen seconds later that the sounds were weakened to the point where humans could hear. Deafening explosions echoed, and all the base cities behind the defense lines suffered such a strong hit that an earthquake seemed to have started.

The several skills were detonated by the Fist of Exorcist in advance. Su Ping was pushed back by the blast, but not very far, as his body was as hard as the fist attack and was able to handle the impact.

Whoosh!

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and dashed forth to exit the energy turbulence.

Space was trembling and he couldn’t move with his usual flash steps. He had to approach the enemy by dashing!

“Damn it!”

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil was on the other side of the turbulence, infuriated by the failure of the attacks. It was also left aghast by Su Ping’s horrifying fist skill.

It was ready to initiate another wave of attacks, when it suddenly detected a feeble, yet sharp killing aura.

It quickly changed its expression, as Su Ping’s powerful sword attack had left a deep impression.

“Field of Darkness!”

It quickly activated its bloodline skill. The world around was enshrouded in darkness. Those trapped in that field would be deprived of all senses, while their energy would be corrupted and absorbed without realizing it.

“He’s here!”

Hardly had the field been unfolded when the Heavenly King of Good and Evil detected an intruder.

Brutality emanated from its eyes. Su Ping was blind inside that field, but it wasn’t an impediment.

It was very easy to defeat someone who was blind when the other could see!

Its white scale-covered head suddenly opened its mouth, where a highly-condensed, pure white holy sword was being condensed; it was sharp enough to cut apart a peak Fate State wild beast.

Whoosh!

The light radiated by the holy sword didn’t illuminate the dark field. Instead, it simply made the sword brighter. Oddly enough, nothing could be seen in the Field of Darkness which seemed to be covering everyone’s eyeballs with mucus. Not even the brightest light could be seen unless it was right next to the eyes.

It was a kind of darkness that couldn’t be dispelled by light!

The holy light was about to hit the target, when Su Ping suddenly leaned down and sprinted!

The man instantly dashed forward with an awfully weird movement technique!

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil was stunned and wide eyed. However, in the next moment, it was too afraid to consider why Su Ping was able to see things in the Field of Darkness. It simply remembered his previous attack.

No, I don’t want to die!

Appalled and enraged, it spouted Dragon Air Essence from both heads!

Two breaths of dragon air, one black and the other white, spurted out. One contained the holy and scorching vibe, and the other was cold and corruptive.

However, Su Ping drew his sword in the next moment. The horrifying attack that the Heavenly King of Good and Evil couldn’t forget was launched again, from close up!

Bang!!

When the sword slashed out, the invisible aura of annihilation tore apart the Field of Darkness as if it were a black curtain!

Then, the sword aura reached the Heavenly King of Good and Evil in the blink of an eye and cut its heads. The one with white scales exploded. Its neck and body underneath the head was cut apart too!

No blood spilled from the fractures. Instead, white steam popped up. The blood that was about to gush out under the squeezing of the veins was instantly evaporated.

“Su...”

“...”

Ji Yuanfeng, Gu Siping and the Deputy Chief, who had anxiously arrived to help, were all astonished when the Field of Darkness faded away.

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil had been beheaded?

Everybody in the base was startled. That wasn’t just any Beast King! it was the Heavenly King of Good and Evil, the strongest of the four infamous kings on the Blue Planet!

Yet, it had been defeated and beheaded by Su Ping!

Ji Yuanfeng’s eyeballs were almost popping out. He couldn’t believe that the Heavenly King of Good and Evil, whom he had fought for hundreds of years, died just like that!

He had fought the Heavenly King of Good and Evil times, and neither of them could beat each other. So, he trained himself in seclusion and attempted to reach the Star State. However, he knew that the Heavenly King of Good and Evil was a talented wild beast that was growing too!

Little did he expect that hundreds of years later, it would be executed by Su Ping before he had a chance to defeat it!

The guy had executed two peak Fate State wild beasts in a row. Was he really a human being?

Nearby, the other Fate State Beast Kings were petrified too.

They all knew the horror of the Heavenly King of Good and Evil. Some of the Fate State Beast Kings from the Deep Caves had conflicts with the four kings on the surface after they came from the underground world. However, they were all subdued or killed by the Heavenly King of Good and Evil.

“The Heavenly King of Good and Evil is dead, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil is dead...”

The head of Seven Sins’ which loved repeating mumbled in shock and frustration.

Another head which always declared that it would blow up the enemy fell silent too and simply opened its mouth.

It probably knew the Heavenly King of Good and Evil better than anybody else. After all, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil’s ranking was always higher than its, and it was always reluctant to admit its inferiority.

But admit it or not, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil was simply stronger.

“Huh?”

Su Ping was about to to deal with the last peak Fate State enemy, when he found that the Heavenly King of Good and Evil was still breathing!

He turned his head, only to discover that its black-scaled head was pretending to be dead.

Noticing Su Ping’s eyes, the head suddenly opened its mouth and spouted out black flames. At the same time, several rock tentacles grabbed its body and escaped through the underground!

It escaped!

Su Ping’s expression changed somewhat. He had cut apart half of the Heavenly King of Good and Evil’s body, and it hadn’t died. Did two heads mean two lives?

But it had already lost its torso and heart. How could it live without them?

Su Ping looked ahead where the soil was moving and the Heavenly King of Good and Evil emerged.

Next to the Heavenly King of Good and Evil was the peak Fate State beast king that looked like a sea dragon. It was shocked, and then angry once it saw that the Heavenly King had run to him.

Damn it, why did you come to me?

Why do you think I can hold them off if you can’t beat him?

That being said, it couldn’t turn a blind eye to an ally. It spouted a mouthful of golden fluid that covered the Heavenly King of Good and Evil’s body, before it said, “This is the Spring of Life that the Ocean Emperor gave me. Remember my favor!”

“Many thanks,” said the Heavenly King of Good and Evil’s head with black scales, in a sincere and grateful tone.

The sea dragon snorted regretfully, as the Spring of Life was very precious; it would have possibly been useful to its recovery later.

“Just call the Ocean Emperor. We can’t beat this guy by ourselves,” said the beast king leader while enjoying the treatment.

The sea dragon said angrily, “Why should I know where the Ocean Emperor is? Just heal yourself. I think the human being has lost a lot of his energy; he can’t launch powerful attacks endlessly. The Ocean Emperor will probably arrive soon if we persist a while longer.”

The Heavenly King of Good and Evil was stunned, not expecting that the sea dragon—being a peak Fate State beast from the ocean and one of the Ocean Emperor’s three best generals—would be unable to reach out to the Ocean Emperor.

Was there another pair of master and servant like them?

No longer counting on reinforcements anymore, the Heavenly King of Good and Evil focused on healing himself.

Su Ping looked at the golden fluid on the Heavenly King and sensed the vibe of plants and divine energy from it. His brow frowned ever so slightly. Was there divine energy on the Blue Planet? Or was it acquired from certain relics?

He had no time to think. He was under a lot of pressure since he failed to kill the enemy in the last attack. He could launch one last attack; plus, it was hard to execute both of enemies.

“Try to stop the Heavenly King from healing. I’ll take care of this one,” said Su Ping quickly to Ji Yuanfeng and the others.

The latter mentioned saw that the Heavenly King was treating itself; their expressions changed quickly and nodded.

Su Ping strode towards the sea dragon.

The aquatic beast secretly cried when Su Ping moved closer, but it certainly didn’t show it on its face. It demanded brutally, “Boy, you’ll be dead for sure if you dare to hurt me!”

Su Ping’s lips twitched a bit. Was the guy scared even before the battle started?

That beast king was slightly weird, and even cute in a way.

“It’s a shame that I don’t have additional beast-catching rings, or I would catch you as a pet,” remarked Su Ping.

The sea dragon was instantly outraged. “You want to have me as a pet? Do you really think you can?”

Then, it raised a huge tide towards Su Ping.

Ice daggers with freezing air were darting out from the tide; they were sharp enough to cut through space apart or destroy Void State secret treasures.

“If you use water, I will counter with lightning!”

Upon seeing the tide, Su Ping simply condensed a lightning arrow in his head and threw it to the tide. Then, it was deviated by the tide and continued towards the sea dragon.

The sea beast became numb and angry after being hit by the arrow. It was vulnerable to lightning, and the bolt that Su Ping had released was so powerful that it felt as strong as one released by a Fate State wild beast of the lightning family.

Su Ping stepped forward and crushed the tide. He stood on top of the remains of the tide and raised his sword again, determined to finish off the beast king once and for all.

The sea dragon shivered when Su Ping raised his sword. It had zero confidence in resisting his attack.

Right when Su Ping was about to launch the Void Sword, the air temperature suddenly dropped, and snowflakes began to fall out of nowhere.
