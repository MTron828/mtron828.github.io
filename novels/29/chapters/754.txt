Chapter 756: Competition

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The money for the two Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons was transferred.

Su Ping felt slightly satisfied when he looked at the energy points he had obtained. He would make forty to fifty thousand if he could sell the ten dragons!

It happened to be the last day of the week; the Thunder Ocean Fruit would be replaced by another product once the day was over.

He would have enough energy even if only five dragons were sold.

“Go sign the contracts,” said Su Ping.

The purple-haired girl nodded and walked to where Joanna and the two dragons were, ready to bond them as pets.

Someone broke into the shop right then.

It was exactly the brown-haired young man who had returned, breathing heavily due to the running. He was surprised to see that the store was empty, but then he felt delighted.

He had feared being too late to get the other dragons.

However, the others didn’t seem to have realized how precious Su Ping’s Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons were; all of them had been lured away by the assessment across the street!

Nobody was in his way. It was almost the best opportunity!

The young man was excited. He then recognized the purple-haired girl who was in the process of bonding pets and his expression changed.

The girl heard the noise when the young man broke into the shop. She turned around and recognized that he was the one who bought the first Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon.

Why did he run back so quickly? Is there something wrong with the dragon he bought?

The girl became uneasy as she thought about that.

“Huh?”

Su Ping was slightly curious to see the young man return, but the latter’s eyes made him realize that the guy must have found that the dragon he had bought was well worth it.

Su Ping knew that the pets he sold were definitely the best among the pets in the same price range. His conclusion was based on his knowledge of the system and his confidence in his training.

That was the reason why he didn’t have to please customers; he only needed to sell the pets in order.

“Boss, I’d like to buy those two dragons!” the young man said, seeing that the girl hadn’t completed a contract yet. He thought again and added quickly, “I’d like all the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons in your shop!”

“What?”

The purple-haired girl was wondering whether to ask for a refund, but was then shocked by what the young man said.

You’re not here to return the dragon?

And... You’re planning to buy all the pets in Su Ping’s shop?

While the girl was racking her brain about it, many more customers broke into the shop. The door of the shop would’ve been busted open if it were normal, but it withstood the effort as if made of iron. Some Void State battle pet warriors tried to push the edge of the door, only to find that it was impossible to shake!

Some of the customers who actually intended to break the door were greatly shocked—they eventually had to squeeze through the crowd.

Once the customers were lined up, Su Ping would usually ask them to stay in order. He had already kicked a line cutter out!

No wonder that shop didn’t sell anything when it was opened, even kicking honorable guests out.

They’d be happy even if Su Ping yelled at them right to their faces, as long as he sold the Class A pets to them!

“Don’t push! Don’t push! Damn it!”

“Stop trying to squeeze through!”

“Boss, do you have any more Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons? I’d like to take them all!”

“Get lost! I want them too!”

“Boss, I only need one. Just name your price. I’ll pay you ten billion immediately, as long as it has Class A aptitude!”

“Get the hell out of here! You want to buy a pet with Class A aptitude for only ten billion? It’s a Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon, not a f*cking big gray cat!”

Big gray cat: ???

All the customers were pushing and shoving each other. Those who failed to reach the front could only yell to make their offers.

The fierce competition dumbfounded the purple-haired girl, who was even more shocked by the customers’ exclamations.

She wasn’t a fool. The fierce competition she saw, plus the noises outside... Was the pet that was assessed to have a Class A aptitude the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon from Su Ping’s shop?

The purple-haired girl was stunned.

But that dragon was only sold for four hundred million!

How could it possibly have a Class A aptitude?

Su Ping thought along those lines upon seeing their reaction. He asked the brown-haired young man, “Is the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon I sold you just now the Class A aptitude pet they’re all raving about?”

The young man became quite anxious when he saw the customers behind him, especially those who were bidding high figures.

He was shocked to hear Su Ping’s curious question, knowing he was truly lucky. The boss doesn’t seem to know how terrifying his pets are!

He suddenly lost interest in buying more pets; turning around and fleeing the place suddenly felt like a more sensible choice.

Why would he flee?

Based on Su Ping’s reaction, he became certain that the shop had never tested the pet’s aptitude. It was just selling the pets at random!

Maybe he had been unbelievably lucky to have purchased the only Class A pet in the shop!

If the boss learned of that, he might vomit blood in fury and demand the customer to return the pet!

There was no way that he would return such a precious pet he had gotten with only four hundred million.

“Well...” Faced with Su Ping’s question, the brown-haired young man thought for a moment and then clasped his hands in salute. “Thank you, boss. I’ll be on my way!”

Su Ping: “???”

I only asked you a random question. Why are you so panicked?

Also, didn’t you want to buy all the remaining pets? You don’t want them anymore?

Su Ping always abided by the first-come first-served policy. He might sell all the pets if the guy was willing to buy them and had enough open spots.

“That son of a bi*ch is leaving!”

“Why doesn’t he want the other Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons?”

“Is this whole thing just a marketing strategy? Does he work for this shop?”

Some of the customers were shocked and suspicious to see that the young man was leaving.

The young man then saw that the shop was crammed with people. He could not leave! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There were also many guys who wanted to go in!

He uneasily squeezed through the crowd, not caring about anything else.

He didn’t want to be stopped by Su Ping or forced to return the pet.

Su Ping didn’t stop the young man who was determined to go. He looked at the crowd and said, “Quiet!”

He exerted strength on his throat, making his human voice sound like a dragon roar.

His intimidating aura instantly silenced the noisy shop.

Many people looked at Su Ping and found him as threatening as a dragon that had assumed a human shape.

“Line up! Leave this shop if you don’t want to!” declared Su Ping coldly, “Don’t yell or cut in line while in my shop. First come, first served. Visit us another day if you don’t get what you want.”

A lot of people widened their eyes after hearing that.

How could there be such a businessman?

Visit us another day if you don’t get what you want? Do you think yours is the only shop in the world?

Many people were infuriated, but held back when remembering the young man’s top dragon. Whether or not it was a marketing strategy, they decided to check out Su Ping’s remaining pets first.

Su Ping gave Joanna a hint, asking her to help line up the customers.

Most of them calmed down after they saw Joanna and obediently stood next to one another.

The brown-haired young man finally found a gap when the customers were lined up and quickly left the shop.

“Lily?”

A purple-haired woman drew close at that moment and saw the girl with the same hair color. “Why are you here? Did you also buy a pet?”

The purple-haired girl was rather surprised to see her. She exclaimed, “Sister Cleo!”

“Don’t cut in line, okay?” someone said to Cleo unhappily.

Cleo looked at him and ignored him. She said to Su Ping behind the counter, “She’s a cousin of mine. Can I say something to her?”

Su Ping shrugged. “You have to wait in line if you want to buy something, but you’re free to do anything else.”

The others calmed down once they saw that Cleo was not another competitor.

Cleo quickly approached the purple-haired girl and asked, “Did the young man who just left buy a Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon in this store?”

“Sister Cleo, why are you here? Did he test the pet in your place? Does it really have Class A aptitude?” asked Lily in disbelief.

“Answer my question first,” said Cleo solemnly.

“Yes. That guy bought a pet here, a lot of people witnessed it. He only paid a bit over four hundred million,” said Lily.

The customers who hadn’t been to Su Ping’s shop earlier gasped when they overheard that. Four hundred million for a Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon was a true bargain!

The dragon had also been tested and it had a Class A aptitude. That guy was truly lucky!

Cleo was taken aback when she heard Lily’s answer, but she soon came to her senses and glanced at the girl’s newly bought dragons. “Did you buy these two?”

“Yes. I’ve already paid for them and was about to establish contracts with them.” Lily nodded and asked, “Sister Cleo, did the guy test his dragon at your place?”

Cleo didn’t reply. She simply asked telepathically, “How much did you pay for these two pets?”

“About four hundred million each; no more than one billion in total.”

“Hurry up and establish the contracts. I’ll test them in my place,” Cleo instantly urged her.

She was thinking exactly as the brown-haired young man did. She believed that the shop had never tested the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragons, and one of the seemingly inferior beasts acquired through certain channels turned out to have great potential!

“Oh, okay.” Lily accepted the proposal, slightly shocked.

She quickly finished the contract establishment.
