Chapter 1329 Demise of the Primordial Empyrean Master (2)

“They can only block normal Celestials?”

Shen Huang was rendered speechless by Su Ping’s answer. He was just a clone at the moment, not even his old Celestial self. However, it seemed that the Celestial State was nothing remarkable for Su Ping.

Still, he didn’t question Su Ping’s claim. He knew the barriers better than anyone. Su Ping’s actions and words proved that he had become even more terrifying.

“Your employees said that you went missing. Did something happen?” asked Shen Huang. Su Ping shook his head. “I met an opportunity and gained something good.”

Shen Huang was enlightened; It was nothing unusual to cultivate in seclusion for a month, or even decades when an opportunity was found.

“The situation doesn’t look good.”

Without further ado, Shen Huang sighed and continued, “The worms are all over the universe. They are at the moment attacking thirty-six of our Golden Star Zone’s defense lines at the same time. Nine of them have been conquered; we have to pull our defense lines further in and only defend the ten areas outside the Celestial Court.”

Su Ping slightly changed his expression. The distance was so short that an Ascendant could cross it in three days. The enemy was already at their doorstep.

“Is the situation already this bad? Aren’t Chi Huo and Xu Kong here? They didn’t take action?” asked Su Ping.

Shen Huang shook his head and said, “We cannot let them do anything. As I said, some sort of strange power is mixed in the worm tide. We don’t know who they are yet, but the speculation was confirmed after a month of fighting. If Chi Huo takes action, he’ll probably be in danger.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“A strange power?”

Su Ping was stunned.

......

“That’s right. There are aliens lurking in the tide and trying to hunt down experts,” said Shen Huang, “Even your senior brother was almost killed earlier on; he only survived with a secret treasure of mine, but he won’t be as lucky again.”

Su Ping’s expression changed somewhat, not expecting the situation to be as dangerous. He asked, “Are the lurking existences in the Celestial State?”

“From the looks of it, yes, but they’re stronger than the Celestial cultivators we have here,” said Shen Huang, “Half a month ago, Fei Tian of the Flying Skull Star Zone died. He was clutched by a big hand and squeezed to death when he fought against a worm tide. The picture is still etched in the deep spaces; I can play it for you.”

Shen Huang waved his hand as he talked.

The void was strengthened, and the narrow building became vast.

Illusions appeared in the vast void. They were countless worms fighting human beings who rode all sorts of pets; it was bloody and brutal.

In the middle of the battle-a man suddenly rushed out and tore the worm tide apart, causing terrifying damage.

However, even more worms were pressing forward. Right when the man was about to unleash some sort of unparalleled power at the center of the worm cluster-a gigantic hand suddenly stretched out and clenched him.

The man simply exploded like a detonated nuclear bomb. A terrifying blast was spread out, wiping out a lot of the worms nearby.

The gigantic hand then disappeared and retreated to the worm tide.

“Well…”

Su Ping was quite shocked to see that scene. Most shockingly of all, that black hand was identical to the one he had seen coming from the universe’s crack!

It’s the creature that fought the God Emperor’s ancient corpse. It has truly snuck into our universe… Su Ping was definitely scared; that thing was able to fight the ancient corpse. Even though the latter had lost most of its power, it was still a terrifying God Emperor. Undoubtedly, the master of that hand was likely a God Emperor too.

A God Emperor lurking in their universe was like an enormous shark hiding among a shoal of sardines.

“It’s an alien creature,” said Su Ping with a contorted face. If the worms were commanded by a God Emperor, such a universal war would be one-sided.

The human Celestials would only be exterminated if they did anything.

Noticing Su Ping’s eyes, Shen Huang realized something and asked, “Recognize the hands?”

Su Ping nodded and told him what he knew. Then, some questions popped up in his mind. “If this creature is of a high tier, it should be able to dominate our universe. Why is it hiding?” “It’s indeed an alien creature.” Shen Huang had already gathered a lot of information and guessed something. What Su Ping said confirmed it. He said, “That thing squeezed Fei Tian to death with a single move. According to our evaluation, it is a peak Celestial State expert, or a universe dominator.

“He’s probably sneaking around and doesn’t dare to act in the open because he’s scared of something present in our universe.”

“He’s scared of something?” Su Ping felt slightly dazed. That was the only explanation.

What could possibly scare a God Emperor in that universe?

“Could it be the Primordial Empyrean Master living in the Planet of Origin?” Su Ping ventured.

Shen Huang shook his head and heaved a sigh. “I haven’t told you yet, but the Planet of Origin is gone. The Primordial Empyrean Master tried gathering all the forces in the universe twenty days ago. He voluntarily fought against the worm tide and challenged the alien hiding in the tide, only to be killed in the end.”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. The Primordial Empyrean Master, whom he had never met, and who was considered the strongest man in the universe, actually died in the war?

“Are there any recordings of that fight?” asked Su Ping in a hurry.

Shen Huang shook his head with a sigh. “Unlike Fei Tian, their battle destroyed parts of the universe too badly to leave any images behind. There’s only some footage of the Primordial Empyrean Master’s participation in the battle. One of your senior brothers I sent to the Planet of Origin sent a message back after the expert died, saying that he witnessed when it happened.

“All the sages and saints left with the Planet of Origin after the demise of the Primordial Empyrean Master, banishing all the other inhabitants when they left. No one knows where they are now.”

“Well…”

Su Ping didn’t expect that the core of the Federation would escape at such a moment.

The universe was only so big. Where could they run to?

Su Ping instantly remembered Kayafollet, the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin, who acquired the legacy of the ancient corpse. He thought of something and then released her from his universe of chaos.

“Huh?”

Kayafollet was surprised to be freed. Her expression changed when she saw where she was, then looked at Su Ping with fear. “What do you want?”

“The Primordial Empyrean Master has died. Aliens have invaded our universe through the crack; it’s a total war right now. The rest of the people from the Planet of Origin have run away. Where do you think they would run to?” Su Ping looked at her coldly.

Kayafollet was shocked; her eyes were like saucers.

There was too much information for her to digest in one go.

The Primordial Empyrean Master had died… That was shocking enough. He was an existence that even her master worshiped and obeyed!

“That’s impossible! Impossible!” Kayafollet couldn’t help but roar.

Su Ping slapped her in the face and interrupted her rambling. “I asked you a question. You’re not supposed to yell.”

Kayafollet was stupefied, while Shen Huang slightly raised his eyebrows. He didn’t expect to see that Su Ping would so easily subdue the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin. In any case, she was a Celestial expert who had obtained a legacy. “You…”

Kayafollet sobered up and almost flew into a fit of rage. However, Su Ping’s cold eyes stopped her dead in her tracks; her rationality told her not to mess with him. The image of Su Ping squeezing her master and feeding it to his pet was still fresh and vivid in her memory.

Furthermore, she did have a chance to witness the scenes beyond the crack in the universe before she was imprisoned by Su Ping, including the battle between the ancient corpse and the alien.

If that alien could fight head to head with the corpse, it would then be logical that it was strong enough to defeat her master’s master.

While dazed for a moment, she looked at Su Ping’s hand, which was getting ready to strike again. She then said quickly, “Don’t hit me; I’ll talk. However, you won’t be able to find them even if I do tell you.”
