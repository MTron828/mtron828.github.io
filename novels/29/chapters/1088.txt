Chapter 1089: Slaughter

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Ye Ling was stunned.

He and Wanyan Shuang were very close to begin with, and the forces behind them were on friendly terms too. They had been allies since they entered the trial; however, she abandoned him for a simple invitation that someone on Su Ping’s team had presented.

‘Was the bond between them that frail?

Ye Ling snapped out of it, and the shock tumed to fury, but he didn’t show any of it. He chuckled and said, “Count me in, if Miss Wanyan wants to join you.”

It didn’t seem right to slap a smiling face.

Loulan Lin and her companions’ expressions changed after hearing such a response; they seemed angry, but none of them was vocal about it.

They knew fully well that they wouldn’t possibly have a place there without Su Ping’s protection. If Su Ping weren’t there, the rest of Shen Huang’s disciples would have gotten rid of them already.

After all, everyone was competing; who would spare a bunch of strangers?

“You?”

After Ye Ling’s decision, Shuai Qianhou raised his eyebrows and casually said, “I don’t think you’re qualified.”

Ye Ling’s smile instantly froze.

Diaz said, “He’s still qualified to be cannon fodder. He’s third place on the Divine Lord Rank anyway.”

Ye Ling: “…”

Who the heck are you?

He remembered Diaz. He had read the Divine Lord Rank from recent years as he prepared for the trial, and Diaz was one of the new members on the listing.

He was on the 46ths spot.

Considering Diaz’s achievements, it was quite commendable that he had risen to such a height in only a couple of years, ever since the Universe Geniuses’ Contest.

Still, he was merely a 46th-ranked weakling, and he thought that Ye Ling was only worthy as cannon fodder?

Ye Ling was infuriated. He would have attacked if it weren’t that Shuai Qianhou was present.

He didn’t care one bit about the 46th-ranked youngster, the Star State guy, or the other losers he had never heard of. Even if they were Shen Huang’s disciples, the really talented senior brothers and sisters had already risen to the Ascendant State and become famous.

The guys present were definitely the worst among Shen Huang’s disciples!

“Third on the Divine Lord Rank…” Shuai Qianhou considered for a moment and looked at Su Ping. “What do you think?”

Wanyan Shuang was dazed for a moment.

She also looked at Su Ping, with confusion in her eyes.

The young man seemed to truly be in the Star State.

Shuai Qianhou was clearly the leader of the team in her eyes. He might be the newest junior disciple, but that was a place where only strength mattered. Seniority didn’t matter at all in that place!

Loulan Lin and the others were also surprised. Loulan Hai in particular; he was shocked, since he had recognized Shuai Qianhou the moment he arrived.

The man had been a famous genius since fifty thousand years prior!

He rose to the top of the Divine Lord Rank more than forty thousand years before!

The guy was an old monster who was one of the most likely to get the legacy. Ye Ling wasn definitely below the former’s level.

It was just surprising that such a genius should ask for Su Ping’s opinion.

Su Ping was indeed talented, but did his potential really matter at the moment?

“He’s indeed worthy as cannon fodder, but we’re not short of cannon fodder at the moment. He offended my friends; just kill him,” said Su Ping casually, after feeling dazed for a moment.

Ye Ling was stunned.

Wanyan Shuang was surprised too.

The three members of the Loulan family were shocked; they immediately understood why Shuai Qianhou asked Su Ping. They were under Su Ping’s protection, and they had a conflict with Ye Ling. Su Ping would surely be uncomfortable if the other man were to be taken in.

Wanyan Shuang could not help but observe Su Ping carefully. The guy seemed to be in the Star State from every perspective. She had been training in seclusion for thirty thousand years and had never paid close attention to the Divine Lord Rank.

She was pretty sure that Su Ping was one of the new stars.

Ye Ling became furious after such a verdict. “Just kill me?”

He had a history with Su Ping, back in the Loulan territory. The guy was seizing the opportunity for revenge!

After taking a deep breath, Ye Ling asked solemnly, “Miss Wanyan, are you really going to become their ally?”

Wanyan Shuang glanced at him indifferently, and heaved a sigh. “For old time’s sake, I suggest you run immediately.”

Ye Ling was shocked; he could tell that Wanyan Shuang meant it. He was furious; he wanted to tear Su Ping and the others into pieces, but he was afraid of Shuai Qianhou, who had convinced Wanyan Shuang to switch over to his side with a simple invitation.

He had never met the guy before.

“Su Ping, I’ll remember you!”

Ye Ling threw that ruthless declaration and was about to flee—

Shuai Qianhou looked at Wanyan Shuang and asked, “Do you want to prove your loyalty to us?”

‘Wanyan Shuang raised her eyebrows and stared at him casually.

Shuai Qianhou stared back at her for a while and chuckled. “Fine. I’ll just do it myself.”

He remembered something as he talked, then asked Su Ping, “Senior Su, would you like to take care of him?”

“Sure.”

Su Ping nodded.

He knew that Shuai Qianhou wanted to gauge his combat ability, but he didn’t care. After all, he didn’t have to use his full strength to deal with Ye Ling.

Loulan Lin suddenly raised her previously lowered head. She said with worry, biting her lip, “You… Be careful.”

Su Ping looked at her and smiled. “I’ll be fine. I have to be alive for you to surpass me, right?”

She was stunned for a moment, and then quickly looked away.

“Noisy.” Shuai Qianhou was looking in another direction, where the two men who had fought against Loulan Jue were seen approaching. They were making eye contact and plotting something, but Shuai Qianhou heard them.

They were shocked by Shuai Qianhou’s sudden remark; they abruptly stopped their advance, and then turned around to make a quick getaway.

But the next moment—both of them bumped into Shuai Qianhou’s arms.

The surrounding space had been transformed. It was the sixth space; dangerous for normal Star Lords to explore. Only the tougher Star Lords could stay for a long enough time.

The constant whispers in the void were truly maddening and bloodcurdling.

There were scenes and sounds of ancient experts from eons before that had been recorded by the universe. Only illusions remained, but their pressure was too much for normal Star Lords to handle.

Bang! Bang!

Two sharp pillars of flames emerged in the void and penetrated both of those men!

Their armor and battle tattoos had been pierced and melted!

Meanwhile, Su Ping disappeared.

That person

While escaping, Ye Ling noticed Shuai Qianhou’s performance too, and was rather shocked that the guy who had killed the two men, who had boosted their bodies with drugs; both of them had displayed a combat ability on par with the top twenty rankers, if not the top ten, of the Divine Lord Rank!

Even he was incapable of instantly killing them.

Still, Shuai Qianhou had done it. His control over space was truly monstrous!

Acasual laugh echoed just then.

“What are you looking at?”

Ye Ling’s blood froze. He suddenly turned back, only to see a person in front of him. It was none other than Su Ping.

When did he…?

Bang!

Su Ping punched as quickly as lightning. Space was shortened. It was as if Ye Ling’s body would have voluntarily attached itself to his fist.

The noise of a skull explosion burst out, and Ye Ling was flung away.

He didn’t stop until he was hundreds of meters away. His twisted body gradually stood straight again, while the flesh and blood on his neck wriggled and gathered to form another head.

“You’re not dead?” Su Ping was a bit surprised. He then chuckled. “Did you say that you wanted to practice with me if you had the chance?”

“You…”

Ye Ling looked at Su Ping with a mix of shock and fury. He suddenly grew an eye on the back of his head, which gazed at Shuai Qianhou. He was more afraid of Shuai Qianhou and the rest of them than he was of Su Ping.

“Get the hell out of here!”

Seeing that Shuai Qianhou and the others were merely standing there, Ye Ling roared and charged at Su Ping, hoping to tear him apart and escape.

“Come again!”

Su Ping stood with a smile; he threw another punch when Ye Ling moved closer.

The law of destruction and the aura of death were gathered on his fist.

Ye Ling, however, quickly turned and moved in a different direction. He didn’t endure a head-on clash with Su Ping; his top priority was to escape. Still, he was holding back even though he was furious.

Su Ping, however, seemed to have foreseen his trajectory; he flashed and punched him again.

Ye Ling narrowed his eyes. He instantly performed the law of time, to infinitely stretch the moment; then he unleashed the violent power of his constitution. An intense coldness was spread out; even space seemed to be freezing.

With the law of space and the path of ice, he could freeze his enemy’s mind.

But the next moment, the fist still smashed forth, without being restrained by time.

Ye Ling quickly raised his arms. A strange face appeared between them, and then was broken.

Boom. He was flung back. This time, his arms were broken and his blood was splashing. The blood gushing out was churned and pulverized by the pervading power of space in the void.

Su Ping followed him and punched again; this time aiming at the head.

His attack was simple and straightforward. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Ling’s pupils widened. He forgot the excruciating pain on his arms, and even the grief of losing his pet, since it died protecting him. He could only see Su Ping’s fist, which seemed able to penetrate anything; it carried a terrifying, destructive power.

“No…”

Ye Ling was scared; he let out a miserable scream.

But the next moment, his scream ended abruptly. His head was destroyed and it couldn’t be healed.

His laws of vitality and time, both fully mastered, had been destroyed by Su Ping. In terms of the path of destruction, even though Su Ping had yet to perfect it, he had been to the Source World and attained a much deeper understanding.

Law suppression was utterly simple and destructive!

“Little Skeleton.”

Su Ping summoned his pet companion and asked it to absorb the guy’s vitality. According to the system, everything was pet food; Ye Ling’s essence was like rare pet food, and it couldn’t be wasted.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Ling’s body was obliterated by dark energy, leaving nothing behind. His bones were made of infinite energy; they could have been compared to an ultimate treasure.

Su Ping sent the Little Skeleton back to the contract space and rejoined the group..
