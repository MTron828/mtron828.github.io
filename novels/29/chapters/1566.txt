Chapter 1567: A Contract With Eternity
"Leave? That's impossible."         

    

Su Ping drifted away from her body and gazed at her. "Have you given up so easily?"     

The Mother of Chaos looked back at him and said, "You don't understand. With everything coming to this point, there's no chance of winning, at all. It's useless even if we kill him; he's already fused with chaos."     

"So what?" Su Ping said, "If he fused with it, we'll just have him part with it. If he's unwilling, we'll beat him until he changes his mind! Why give up so easily? Did I ever give up when I was a nobody and I encountered lots of formidable monsters in the cultivation sites?"     

He then pointed at the corpses that had tagged along with the experts of all species; some were stuck to the warships and partook in the battle. Once the fight ended, Su Ping took them with him.     

"They have been waiting for this moment for so long. Have they ever given up?"     

"There's also them…"     

Su Ping pointed at the people from the cultivation sites and the countless universes. "Compared to you and me, they're more than weak. However, they've never had a real glimpse of hope, exactly because of their puny strength, have they? Do they know the specific arrangements of this war? No! They are simply sailing on a dark ocean and might fall into an abyss at any moment!     

"But have they ever given up?     

"You said that I don't understand. Indeed, I don't. So what if it's hopeless? So what if we're at a dead end? Should we just give up and surrender? If you'll die whether you fight or not, why not die fighting?"     

Su Ping said, giving weight to each word, "You've prepared for such a long time and fought many times over. Was it all for this moment of relaxation right now? Are you tired from fighting?!"     

The Mother of Chaos was stunned, at a loss for words as she looked at Su Ping's red eyes.     

Nobody knew how much suffering he had gone through better than her.     

However, it was true; this seemingly casual and humorous man had never given up in front of a real test!     

Even though he could resurrect, no matter how dangerous the monsters encountered were in the cultivation sites, some despair and fright couldn't be dismissed just like that.     

"If you're tired from fighting, I'll fight for you!"     

Su Ping looked deeply at the system. He then turned around and faced the Ultimate Heavenly Dao, with a burning fight intent rising in his body.     

"Humph. Stupid lives deserve to be destroyed," said the ultimate nemesis with a chuckle.     

The Mother of Chaos looked at Su Ping with flickering eyes. She said softly, "Don't be reckless. You can still survive with the power you have now, even if chaos is restarted. There are no borders inside the great chaos. Even if he dominates this place, he won't be able to find you, just like he can't find Hao Tian and Hei Xiang.     

"You don't have to die for nothing."     

"This isn't dying for nothing. Our deaths are significant!" declared Su Ping, word for word.     

"I just want you to live…" she whispered. Her voice was somewhat dejected. That was why she had chosen to end things.     

Continuing the fight was hopeless. It was better to let the ones capable of surviving to live on.     

Su Ping's heart shook upon sensing the system's emotions. He knew it was her truest desire.     

But…     

"Don't you enjoy prying into my heart?" Su Ping's tone softened.         

    

Slightly dazed, she shook her head and said, "I've no longer peeped into your heart, ever since you reached the Undying State. I promised."     

Su Ping lowered his head and smiled. "Everything I've been doing is because I hope you can survive…"     

The Mother of Chaos was stunned.     

"You know my personality; I will never become a stupid savior. However, I only want to help those who have helped me, and save those who have saved me."     

Su Ping raised his eyes and said, one word after the other, "As I said, I will never let my partners die before my eyes, unless I die first!"     

"System… I prefer calling you that way. Speaking of partners, you have been the one who has kept me company the longest and helped me the most. Don't forget I'm still your host and master!"     

The Mother of Chaos stared at Su Ping, unable to utter a word.     

She was familiar with Su Ping's personality, so she knew he was telling the truth.     

He had been fighting all this time to get there, risking his own life just because he wanted her to survive…     

The Little Skeleton looked at the Mother of Chaos and said briefly, "Don't give up so easily!"     

Inferno Dragon chimed in, with a heavy and deafening tone, imbued with dragon might, "Come on, let's fight together. Boss said that the meaning of life is that you get to enjoy it, not what others may say!"     

"We will fight for you until the last moment!" said the Dark Dragon Hound with a slight grin.     

"Mother, please don't give up so easily!" said Yuan Shi in a hurry.     Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Golden Crow ancestor moved closer and said in a loud voice, "That's right. Mother, let's fight together!"     

Yin Que and Shi Mang had also arrived. They looked intently; troubled, yet in silence. They knew that the Heavenly Dao had fused with chaos, making their fight a lost cause. Continuing the struggle was just asking for death.     

But…     

The third leader of all species—the host that their mother had painstakingly trained—was willing to stay and die with her, even though he had obtained a Chaos Qualification and became an everlasting Sorcerer Ancestor.     

Could they simply turn around and leave?     

Su Ping didn't turn around. He simply said in a low voice, "Everybody, please finish the last part of this journey with me!"     

The experts of all species on the three thousand warships discarded all their despair and grief. They knew that Su Ping could escape while they couldn't; they weren't Sorcerer Ancestors. If chaos collapsed, all of them would cease to exist.     

Su Ping was willing to stay and fight by their side. How could they retreat?     

"Fight!"     

"We're willing to fight by your side, Dao Ancestor!"     

"Dao Ancestor, feel free to take whatever strength I have. I'm willing to serve!"     

"I'm willing to serve you!!"         

    

The experts of all species roared in approval.     

"Ancestor Su, we swore to follow you until death. Don't worry."     

"Brother Su, feel free to go all out. Whether we live or die, we won't complain!"     

All those great figures from the cultivation sites expressed their readiness to fight.     

"All right!"     

Su Ping took a deep breath and said, "Thank you, everybody. Let's fight until he willingly separates from chaos!"     

"Fight!!"     

Battle roars echoed throughout the world.     

Billions of species cheered at the same time.     

Su Ping immediately merged with the Inferno Dragon, the Little Skeleton and his other pets. Then, he activated his Contract Dao, which spread to connect with all species and the people from the cultivation sites. The number of contracts he could establish would completely depend on the capacity of his body. Having become a Sorcerer Ancestor, he could make thousands of universes with a single thought. It wasn't a problem for him to accommodate all the people present.     

"I will establish a contract with all of you!"     

Su Ping's power was spread further out. His Contract Dao was extended to billions of species. From the strongest Undying State expert to the weakest mortals, including the old, the weak, the women and children, all of them were able to feel Su Ping's great and strong willpower.
