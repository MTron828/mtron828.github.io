Chapter 1224: Crushing the Forbidden Area

“Is it really strong?”

Milaluo and the others were stunned by Su Ping’s answer, not knowing what to say at the moment.

Isn’t it strong?

The pet was much stronger than average Ascendant cultivators, and could almost compare to a Heavenly Lord!

Is such a pet not powerful?

There were countless things that Milaluo wanted to say, but chose not to in the end.

There was only one reason why Su Ping would sell such a pet: his own pets were even stronger!

So… nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Was this pet discarded?

But even so, it shouldn’t have been treated like garbage. It was almost sold for peanuts!

Everyone was silent, maybe because Su Ping’s answer was too crazy; it was impossible to tell whether or not he was joking.

Su Ping didn’t consider it a big deal. He patted Milaluo’s shoulder and said, “I’m glad the pet is to your liking. Train it well and it may rise to the Celestial State someday. Don’t forget to hire me to train it for you; the odds of success will be higher that way.”

Su Ping smiled and turned around.

Milaluo had recovered from the shock, but was sent to the clouds by what Su Ping said.

It might rise to the Celestial State?

The Celestial State!

Why did the Celestial State sound so easy in his mouth? He was talking as if rising to the Celestial State was just a short sprint!

Milaluo was lost for words again. He simply thought that it was Su Ping’s well wishing for himself and the pet. Of course, the man could be kidding.

Nevertheless, it seemed that the man didn’t have enough respect for the Celestial State.

He often talked about the Celestial State without showing enough respect… But, nevermind. His master was a Celestial State, and there might be another Celestial backer. Nobody else could tell him off about how to treat those lofty individuals.

Besides, there was a good chance that Su Ping would also become a Celestial later; his lack of respect didn’t seem surprising.

A level that they would look up to their entire lives was very likely reachable for that man.

There was a brief moment of silence after Su Ping left. Then, Loulan Ruoyun was the first to approach Milaluo and say, “Hello good friend. Would you like to join the Loulan family? I sincerely extend an invitation on my family’s behalf. Feel free to tell us what you need if you’re willing to join. Or maybe I can take you to meet our clan master so you can talk.”

The other three Ascendants realized what was going on, and could only think about how shrewd she was. It was obvious that she hoped to grab the man along with the pet, since it was impossible to only take the pet!

“Brother, I’m Liu Xiangfei. We’ll be friends in the future!”

“Mister…”

The Ascendant cultivators went and introduced themselves. Milaluo had been a not-too-famous rogue Ascendant. None of the peers present had heard of him before, but they were still warm and enthusiastic.

Nevertheless, their hearts bled when they remembered that the guy had claimed such a great pet for a true bargain, even though they were speaking warmly.

Making friends with Milaluo would more or less make up for the loss.

The latter felt dazed for a moment, and then realized what was going on. He wasn’t a famous Ascendant but he wasn’t dumb; he simply preferred an unrestrained lifestyle. As a result, he didn’t have enough resources, and his combat ability was mediocre.

However, provided that he could turn his newly bought pet into a true ally, he would surely become one of the strongest Ascendants, only bested by Heavenly Lords.

He was going to turn down Loulan Ruoyun’s offer, but then he remembered that Su Ping was close to their family. If he were to turn down the offer, would Su Ping… be affronted?

He changed his mind and said to Loulan Ruoyun, “All right, I’ll gladly accept the offer since the Loulan family is being so sincere. For Boss Su’s sake, I’m willing to join the Loulan family.”

Loulan Ruoyun was delighted. She quickly said, “I’ll take you to meet our clan master immediately. Let’s talk about your privileges and benefits later.”

“I don’t really need much,” said Milaluo modestly. He followed her and left the store.

Right when she was about to leave, Loulan Ruoyun mumbled, “Boss Su is a friend of my family, but he didn’t sell the pet to me. Good thing I convinced the buyer to come with me. Boss Su shouldn’t have any complaints about our family. Was it really because of the ‘first come, first served’ rule?”

She instantly put on a warm smile when she saw him behind the counter, then said goodbye.

Su Ping also said goodbye to her with a normal expression.

Once the Ascendant cultivators left, the other customers who stayed to watch the show left too, although not entirely satisfied.

Joanna asked Tang Ruyan to close the door when the maximum number of customers were received. She then said to Su Ping, “That was surely an ancient divine pet. Why did you sell it so easily? I would have bought it if you had told me about it.”

“Are you short of pets?” Su Ping glanced at her.

Joanna said angrily, “Of course not. But I’m short of top divine pets. I could easily tell that the pet deserved more than that, yet you practically gave it away!”

“That’s fine; I’ll just catch more in the future.”

Su Ping smiled, as he really didn’t feel regretful. Money had become meaningless to him for quite some time; it was only good to exchange it for system energy.

The things he could do with two hundred million energy points was much more valuable than the Black Emperor Red Feather Phoenix.

“If you’re truly short on pets, I can take you to your world and catch some,” said Su Ping.

Joanna’s eyes glittered. “Really?”

“Of course. Why not go there right now?” Su Ping chuckled. “We’ll train the pets at the same time. That’s killing two birds with one stone.”

“All right, I’ll get ready.” Joanna was rather excited. She didn’t really have much to prepare; she simply organized the pets the customers had registered and picked a batch of Star Lord pets that required professional training with Su Ping. Then, the latter entrusted the store to Green Lady for the moment.

Tang Ruyan was a more seasoned employee, but she was only a Star Lord at the moment; she was also too weak to handle their two temporary employees.

Su Ping soon led Joanna to the Demigod Burial again.

“Inform them of our arrival. Ask them to accompany us during the hunt,” Su Ping said to Joanna.

“Sure.”

Joanna put on a smile. A few people revealed themselves in the void soon after. Heather was the first to arrive; she clearly flinched a little when she saw Su Ping, but the next second she put on a warm smile and approached him.

She noticed that Su Ping’s aura was slightly different from last time as she moved closer.

He feels different every time he comes. I even find him slightly scary at the moment…?Heather was rather shocked by Su Ping’s growth.?How long has it been?

Wouldn’t Su Ping be truly capable of fighting them soon?

Shivalello and the others arrived. They felt pained and helpless as they saw the human, but they had no choice except to greet him.

“Now that we’re all here, let’s go hunting. We’re going to capture a few pets for Anna. Surely there are ferocious beasts in your territory, right? The stronger, the better,” said Su Ping straight off, not wanting to waste any time.

The four Superior Gods felt relieved; anything was fine as long as he wasn’t there to rob them a second time.

However, not everyone had the privilege of asking all the four Superior Gods to accompany them hunting…

It was fine… The four of them weren’t really angry. They wouldn’t have a chance to return home unless Su Ping was satisfied.

“Anna, what beast do you want? Just tell me,” said Shivalello generously, waving a hand.

Joanna pursed her lips and smiled. She wouldn’t have been able to ask the four Superior Gods to run an errand for her in the past, even though she was the best Goddess of War. It wouldn’t be bad if she could invite one of them, and she would owe them a big favor. And yet, they were at the moment working for her for free. She delightedly said, “Nothing special really. Let’s just catch the Four Ferocious Gods; I happen to have four openings for pets.”

Of course, she could replace some of her older pets, but they had accompanied her for so long that they were like family to her; she couldn’t part with them.

Her parents had given her the first life, and the pets she fought alongside with had granted her a second life. Pets were all she could count on in the most dangerous moments.

Of course, pets and battle pet warriors had to help and rely on each other. That was why the connection between them could never be cut.

“The Four Ferocious Gods!”

Shivalello was so shocked that he almost swallowed his own tongue. He gazed at Joanna, wondering how she could be that bold.

Heather and the other gods looked at Joanna with disbelief too.?When did she become so greedy?

They soon thought about Su Ping and realized the reason; her greediness was clearly due to that man’s bad influence!

The Four Ferocious Gods!

They were four infamous beasts in the Demigod Burial that even the Superior Gods couldn’t keep in check. They wandered in the barbaric, forbidden lands, and were as strong as Superior Gods. Fortunately, they weren’t really united, and the four Superior Gods were sometimes on the same side.

So, they would suppress the Four Ferocious Gods together if the beasts caused trouble to the cities.

Beasts usually wandered in the wilderness instead of attacking cities as a result.

“Anna, it’s not that we’re unwilling to help you, but you’d be incapable of keeping the Four Ferocious Gods in check if you did catch them. They’ll swallow you!” said Shivalello earnestly, as if he were truly concerned for her.

Joanna said with a smile, “That’s fine. I’ll summon them when I can beat them. I believe it won’t take long…”

“Anna…”

Avril was going to persuade her too.

“Do I sense a bit of unwillingness here?” Su Ping interrupted her and asked suspiciously.

The four of them looked at each other, lost for words; they had no choice but to accept the request. They feared that Su Ping would propose even more outrageous requests.

Su Ping’s growth speed was scary enough. Who knew whether or not the guy would be capable of fighting them or even exceeding them next time went to visit?

Once receiving the four Superior Gods’ consent, Su Ping didn’t waste any time talking and simply asked them to lead the way.

The four Superior Gods had to comply and lead the way. It was a good thing they gathered together, which rarely happened. Really finishing off the Four Ferocious Gods, it would be a good thing for the locals, who wouldn’t have to worry about disasters.

They soon reached a forbidden land and entered it.

They soon found one of the Four Ferocious Gods. The beast was soon caught alive after being surrounded by the four Superior Gods and attacked by Joanna and Su Ping.

The beast was given to Joanna and subdued after being beaten up.

Shivalello and the others looked at Su Ping with even more fear after the battle. The latter had weathered through the beast’s two full-strength attacks without falling.?Is he truly a Major God (Star Lord)?

Everybody then left for another forbidden land.

There were ten forbidden lands in the Demigod Burial. Some were dangerous, some were home to bloodthirsty beasts, and others were nests of the Four Ferocious Gods. They were all conquered, one by one.

All the forbidden lands were turned upside down, which shocked the gods who were adventuring at the time. The Gods of Rules—who were as strong as Joanna—observed from a distance and realized what was going on when they saw the Superior Gods and Joanna.

News was quickly spread throughout the Demigod Burial.

The four Superior Gods and Joanna were going to cleanse the forbidden lands!

The entire Demigod Burial was shocked by the news. Countless people were too dumbfounded for words. Then came a landslide of cheers.

The gods’ territory would be expanded once the ten forbidden lands were conquered, and the safe area would become larger too.

While the entire Demigod Burial was thrilled—Su Ping was leading the four Superior Gods and Joanna to conquer six forbidden areas and kill countless wild beasts.

It was a shame that Su Ping didn’t have any beast-catching rings. Even though he saw some beasts that were as talented as the Black Emperor Red Feather Phoenix, he could only beat them up and ask his pets to absorb them.

The young Chaos Beast had a great appetite, eating everything that was offered as if it housed a bottomless hole; however, there was no sign of it reaching the Ascendant State.

Other pets would have changed significantly, but the young Chaos Beast’s aura was only empowered a little bit.

Time flew.

Half a month later—

Su Ping, the four Superior Gods and Joanna tracked down the last of the Four Ferocious Gods in a desolate place, thus ending the hunting trip.

The last beast looked like a gigantic cat, but there were spots all over its body that looked like strange eyes. It also had two horns and a snake tail. The creature was extremely cunning; it had run off while Su Ping and the others were cleansing other forbidden lands.

Fortunately, the latter Ping had inferred the breed of that beast from the smell and other traces left in its nest. Then, he tracked it down based on its preferences and abilities; otherwise, it might have slipped away.

“We’ve conquered eight of the ten forbidden lands. The last two are extremely dangerous; one of them is even full of cracks, from which void power keeps seeping in. We might die there.” Shivalello had mixed feelings. They had almost crushed all the ‘villains’ in the Demigod Burial in just half a month.
