Chapter 837: Slaughtering the Planet

“I can’t believe this!”

The old man was astounded. He had been studying sword techniques his entire life, yet Su Ping crushed him?

He was able to detect multiple laws contained in Su Ping’s saber aura, but all of them were shallow; they had limited power even when they were combined. What was really horrifying was the profound energy inside Su Ping’s body!

The young man was like a human-shaped monster; his internal system was like a burning furnace!

Bang!

He quickly invoked his constitution and blocked when the fist came at him.

Crystal scales appeared on his arm; it was the not-too-rare rock class constitution. He had reached the peak of the Star State only because he had worked hard for tens of thousands of years.

The void trembled, and the old man’s arm glittered dazzlingly. His body fell straight down like a cannonball and he vomited blood!

The other Star State warriors around him were shocked, since the old man was rather famous—he was known as Ancient Moon Saber God. Even so, he was defeated by the Lord of Blue Planet?

“This guy is at the peak of the Star State too! He’s hiding his real cultivation!”

“This ragged, primitive planet is headed by a lord at the peak of the Star State? That’s unbelievable. He should be running a tier-2 planet!”

“Everybody, let’s kill him together! No matter how strong he is, he is outnumbered. Can’t we beat him together?” someone in the crowd instigated, but the others were all in the Star State and wouldn’t be convinced easily. However, they did need to collaborate.

It was impossible for them to obtain that wondrous tree without finishing off the planet’s lord.

Besides, that lord was extremely fast; it was hard to compete with him for the divine fruit.

“Die!”

“Kill him!”

Many Star State warriors took action, but nobody dared to engage Su Ping in a melee battle. They released powerful law-based attacks combined with astral skills they had practiced.

“Dark Dragon Hound!”

Su Ping widened his eyes furiously and summoned the Dark Dragon Hound, merging with it directly.

Boom!

The power in Su Ping’s body was further increased by the dual fusion. His astral power was overflowing; he charged at the Star State opponents with bones surrounding his body.

His attacks contained astral power and the power of laws; they were as powerful as a hundred nuclear explosions, which could raze a continent.

After a boom, Su Ping broke through the attacks with divine lines and hot flames all over his body; he was as dazzling as a god.

“Go to hell!!!”

Su Ping waved his saber and attacked the nearest opponent. His saber seemed to be cutting the sky apart.

The Star State young man was greatly shocked; he felt that it was impossible to dodge the attack. Even the oxygen around him seemed to have been pumped away, making it impossible to catch his breath.

He quickly invoked his constitution and used all his defensive methods.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A lot of secret treasures were activated, but they were torn apart and knocked away the moment they flew out.

There was a bam—the saber aura tore apart an ancient defense technique that the Star State young man performed, cutting off his arms in the process.

Just like an infuriated God of War, Su Ping waved his saber again.

Saber auras burst out one after another; all of them contained the laws he possessed. His astral power surged as if it were costless. Other people would’ve been exhausted if they performed that many powerful attacks, yet Su Ping was becoming fiercer!

“Oh damn!”

“This guy walks the path of multiple laws!”

“Oh no...!”

An early Star State guy roared in fright and burned his essence and body, adding laws to a river-like secret technique, but the river was instantly ripped apart along with his body!

Laws invaded his body through the fractures, instantly destroying his internal organs. Even his consciousness was pulverized!

More and more Star State warriors fell, some killed on the spot. Su Ping strode onward, forcing his opponents to retreat!

Everybody across the globe was lost for words as they saw those horrifying scenes.

Countless people found it hard to believe; they had seen Su Ping’s terrifying performance in the Battle of the Deep Caves, but they didn’t expect such a drastic growth in such a short time!

It had to be noted that any of those Star State invaders could have easily dealt with the Lord of the Deep Caves!

And yet, they couldn’t even resist a single attack from Su Ping!

The saber-wielding old man at the peak of the Star State was recovering at the moment, as if he was waiting for the best opportunity.

“Is he invincible in the Star State?”

In the special hospital—Nie Huofeng looked at the scene in shock. He couldn’t even imagine such insane battles, nor did he expect Su Ping to change so greatly. If Su Ping were to encounter the Lord of the Deep Caves again, he would probably finish it off with a casual attack.

“Boss Su is actually...”

Liu Tianzong, Qin Duhuang and the others from the five major families were completely astounded; they had been considering how to relay a message and advise Su Ping to retreat for the moment, but what happened next made their eyeballs pop out. Is that man the Boss Su we know?

It was apparently something that could have only been done by Boss Su.

They looked at each other in bewilderment, too shocked for words.

The travelers from other planets were also shocked by the ongoing battle too; none of them had the guts to keep underestimating the Blue Planet.

“Go to hell!!!”

Su Ping’s body was covered by Golden Crow Fire, which could burn and weaken the lesser astral power and laws; this would reduce their effect, making it easier to resist with just his strengthened body.

His body was extremely hard to begin with, and he had attained the second level of the Solar Bulwark. Besides, there was the effect of the body polishing pills that Green Lady had offered him; his body quality was among the best even in the Star State!

His resistance to elements of all classes had also weakened the hostile astral power. The compounded defenses of the Little Skeleton and the Dark Dragon Hound allowed him to ignore early and mid Star State attacks!

He was fighting against a sky full of Star State opponents when he was only in the Void State!

Su Ping was doing the unimaginable, yet he was too infuriated to realize it. After a boom, Su Ping stepped forward with lightning flickering underneath his feet. He instantly approached an opponent and stomped on his head!

The man was quite frightened, not expecting Su Ping to target him. He quickly blocked Su Ping’s feet, but then his arms broke and his cheeks were hit. Just like a mountain falling on his face, his head was ringing as he quickly fell down.

Roar!

Two dragons suddenly flew close. They were holding a golden chain in their mouths; it was unclear what the chain was made of, but it was evidently a remarkable treasure.

Both of the dragons were at the peak of the Star State; both performed their bloodline skills and surrounded Su Ping at a crazy speed. Then, the chain quickly slithered and tied Su Ping’s arms.

In the crowd—a woman wearing black armor said with a cold smile, “You won’t get away even if you’re a deity. You’ve been shackled by my God Binding Chain!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

There was disdain in her eyes. No matter how strong Su Ping was, there was nothing he could do against that ancient treasure.

It was impossible for a Star State expert to break free from it, unless a Star Lord offered to help him!

All the others were delighted to see the black-armored woman take action.

“The Black Tortoise Clan is indeed extraordinary. I didn’t know they had such a treasure!”

“I’ve long heard that the Black Tortoise Clan of the Divine Beast Planet is formidable. They truly can’t be messed with!”

“Everybody, let’s join hands and kill this barbarian!”

“Kill him!”

The other Star State guys immediately took action. They had only been able to struggle and defend themselves earlier on; finally, there was a chance to counterattack.

Roar!!

The two dragons roared and hovered around Su Ping; not only had they tied up his arms, they were also going to restrain him completely!

Su Ping’s eyes were wide open with fury; veins were bulging on his arms. The divine power inside his body burst out, and the energy of countless cells started to revolve.

Boom~!

A fearsome power was emitted from his body as he roared, “Ahhhhhhhh!”

The two hovering dragons came to a pause, before they were hauled towards Su Ping.

Both of the creatures were shocked; they quickly flapped their wings and tried to stabilize themselves.

Su Ping shook his arms and extended his hands, grabbing onto the chain.

“Come here!”

Roar!!

Su Ping let out a roar, and the two dragons trembled hard. They were unable to avoid being pulled toward Su Ping!

Everybody across the globe was too stupefied to say a word as they saw that happen with widened eyes.

After seeing that, the black-armored woman dropped the disdain on her face and exclaimed in shock, “That’s impossible!”

The man is only a human being, and yet he’s hauling two dragons?

Even if Su Ping was at the peak of the Star State, so were the two dragons!

“Hoooooooooooo!”

The dragons roared angrily and flew in the opposite direction as they were being pulled... But no matter how hard they flapped their wings, they were still being pulled toward him.

“Come over here!” Su Ping roared.

He suddenly waved his arms, and the struggling dragons at the ends of the chain lost control of their bodies; they swung forward and then hit each other!

The pulling force was gone the moment they hit, and Su Ping suddenly flew towards them.

Bang!!

A dazzling light burst out after a punch, and one of the dragons’ head was blown up.

Su Ping then stepped on the back of the other dragon, breaking its spine. The dragon cried and vomited blood, before it loosened the chain and fell into the sea down below.

Having the two dragons out of the way, Su Ping grabbed the golden chain and coldly stared at the people in front of him like an unparalleled devil.

All of his opponents were astounded. Two dragons at the peak of the Star State, plus a super treasure, were unable to restrain Su Ping.

One of them had been killed and the other wounded. Is the Lord of Blue Planet really invincible in the Star State?

“You!!”

The black-armored woman was both shocked and infuriated upon seeing her dragons be brutalized by Su Ping. She breathed heavily while she gazed at Su Ping with overwhelming hatred.

Su Ping sensed her gaze and looked back at her; there was nothing but the coldest killing intent in his unemotional eyes.

It seemed that he didn’t care about anything, and he loathed everything!

The black-armored woman withdrew her gaze unconsciously, as if having been bitten by a viper. She no longer dared to make eye contact with Su Ping.

Bringing this fact to conscious thought was even more shocking to her. She was at the peak of the Star State too, and had been through countless battles. And yet, she didn’t dare to look Su Ping in the eye?

Is the guy in the Star State, or is he actually a Star Lord?

“Ms. Zixuan, join hands with the Baroque family! Since we’ve come to this, we really won’t be able to finish off this barbarian if we don’t take him seriously!” said a brawny bearded man.

The black-armored woman looked at him and nodded a second later. “Okay!”

She wanted revenge; the two dragons were her treasures. She was determined to fight Su Ping, not just for the tree!

Nearby, a purple-eyed young man stepped forward and coldly suggested, “He’s the Lord of Blue Planet. This is his planet and his weakness. Considering what has happened so far, I don’t think it’s a problem to slaughter everyone on this planet!”

Everyone’s expressions changed when he mentioned “slaughter everyone on this planet.”

That was typified as a major crime in the Federation. All the perpetrators would be sentenced to death unless someone influential protected them!

“There are so many of us here. It won’t be a big deal even if we slaughter everyone, as long as the planet itself is kept intact. After all, this is the cradle of humanity. As for the primitives that live on it, we can just kill them!”

“That is correct.”

“It’ll be even better if we capture some natives and force the lord to surrender. He’ll be distracted by this!”

“Does this barbarian have any relatives on this Blue Planet? Capturing his children would be the best!”

More and more people in the Star State agreed with the slaughtering plan. To defend the tree or to protect the people on the Blue Planet, what would the lord’s decision be?

“Seniors, keep him occupied. We’ll catch some natives!” said someone in the beginning phase of the Star State.

Everybody else frowned at them but didn’t say anything.

Two of the proponents were at the beginning phase of the Star State; it was pointless for them to stay there.

The other early-phase Star State warriors regretted not stepping forward. They would have also taken up the task, but they were beaten to the punch and it wasn’t advisable to make trouble and provoke divisions in their temporary alliance.

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

The two Star State men instantly flew away.

“You...”

Su Ping looked at the pair of men who were about to leave with bloodshot eyes. Those Star State guys had been talking directly, thinking that telepathically was unnecessary. It was unclear whether they wanted him to hear, or they didn’t care at all!
