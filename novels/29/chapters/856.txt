Chapter 858: First

The battle on the island ended while everybody was discussing.

It only lasted a quarter, but every second of it was spectacular.

Apocalypse performed a secret technique that combined four laws, which then turned into a storm of elements. It seemed as if she were about to tear the universe apart; her destructive aura made the audience gasp.

Even those on the hilltop became solemn.

Holy King, however, seemed to be in possession of some sort of ancient skills; a magnificent shadow that looked like the projection of a god had blocked Apocalypse’s attacks for him.

A blast resounded after a noisy collision; Apocalypse and her pets were pushed to the periphery of the island. All of them were heavily wounded.

On the other side—Holy King stepped out and charged at his opponent; he didn’t seem affected at all except for his damaged robe.

Apocalypse was shocked to see that; her only choice was to resign herself and admit defeat.

The previous attack was already one of her ultimate skills; she had been saving it for the real battles later on. Little did she expect that she would have to use it there, or that she would fail even after using it!

“Humph!”

Holy King stopped with coldness glittering in his eyes upon hearing what Apocalypse had said.

A man flew over to the island when he stopped. It was actually the instructor representing the Amir Royal Academy.

He was afraid that Holy King would continue until he killed Apocalypse. That could be a nasty outcome!

Killing wasn’t forbidden in the Illusionary God Monument Mysterious Realm, but it could not violate the owner’s rules!

“Oh damn!”

“Is he one of the two top experts from Hugh Mia? He’s horrifying!”

“Apocalypse is a genius too; no wonder she ranks second on the Royal Rank. I wonder how strong the person who ranks first can be.”

“Damn it, I have to admit they’re good. We’re all geniuses, but they are real ones, unlike us!”

“All I want to say is that everyone other than me is a genius!”

The audience on the hill sighed in shock.

All of them had been acknowledged as geniuses, each having won a recommendation. But then they realized the massive gap between them once they got there.

Whoosh!

Holy King then flew out of the island and reached the circle where Apocalypse had been seated. He stepped over and sat down disdainfully while everybody else watched.

There were a few other men on the hilltop who didn’t have a seat yet. Their eyes flashed, but none of them did a thing.

They had a good chance of taking Holy King’s seat if they were to challenge him immediately, but they were too proud to take advantage of his weakness.

Even if they defeated the guy, such a victory wouldn’t be glorifying.

A girl inside another circle—holding a blue scepter, wearing a dress and an emerald crown—tilted her head and chuckled. “I knew you could make it.”

She was dressed like a majestic queen, even though she was just a student.

Her looks were sacred and gorgeous; no one was able to harbor any inappropriate thoughts when they laid eyes on her.

“Of course,” Holy King replied casually.

They didn’t communicate telepathically. All the candidates from the Amir Royal Academy heard that and their expressions changed, clearly becoming angry.

“How arrogant!”

Claesabe, who was at the middle of the hill, gritted her teeth in fury. Apocalypse ranked second on the Royal Rank, while he ranked third. If the guy was disrespecting Apocalypse, he would have only thought even less of him.

Oasis Dragon King, who was on a seat on the hilltop, said with cold eyes, “It was just a minor victory. Don’t get ahead of yourself!”

“Huh?”

Holy King stared at Oasis Dragon King and chuckled. “What’s the matter? Reluctant to admit defeat? Talk to me with your fists if you dare!”

Coldness flashed in Oasis Dragon King’s eyes. “I don’t want to take advantage of your wounds, or else you would be talking to me on your knees by now!”

“Ha. These mild injuries are only due to my carelessness. I can easily deal with you as I am!” said Holy King with a sneer.

“Is that so? Do you want to try?” Oasis Dragon King narrowed his eyes aggressively.

“Why not?” Holy King only smiled in disdain.

The girl who was dressed like a queen covered her mouth and laughed. “Do people from the Amir Royal Academy love fighting the same person in turns? Let’s have a fight if we have a chance.”

She was also from the Hugh Mia Academy, the second top warrior!

“I’m a man; I don’t fight women,” said Oasis Dragon King and snorted.

Recognizing his mockery, Holy King chuckled and said, “Then you’ll die in a woman’s arms sooner or later.”

Oasis Dragon King glanced at him coldly but kept silent.

The instructor had already taken Apocalypse back and given her medications; her face was no longer pale, but she still looked grim. She glimpsed at Holy King in silence, then she nodded at Oasis Dragon King as a gesture of gratitude for defending her.

After that, she flew down to the middle of the hill.

She wasn’t in her best shape, and it was hard for her to compete for the seats on the hilltop.

Su Ping was watching everything unfold, then a tall, muscular man with dark skin flew towards him and said condescendingly, “I don’t want to fight those women. Kid, it’ll be you then. Your spot is mine!”

Su Ping looked around, only to find that there were indeed two women flanking him; both of them were very beautiful.

“You’d better find someone else,” Su Ping tried persuading him.

He was getting too lazy to rise from his seat.

“Cut the crap. You’re from the Amir Royal Academy, right? Never heard of you before. You can join the woman from your academy back on the middle of the hill!” snapped the muscular man impatiently.

A young man who was on another seat said casually, “I’ve told you a million times, be respectful to women!”

The young man seemed to be ensconced on a throne, like an emperor.

“Dragon Emperor!”

Many people were stunned after noticing the young man; it was a famous genius from the Dragon Tomb Academy; all the young men in Silvy had heard about him.

The muscular man frowned after hearing what the Dragon Emperor said and obviously disapproved of it. However, he didn’t argue with the man; he simply said to Su Ping, “Hurry up! Are you a mediocre woman too?”

Su Ping could obviously feel the temperature on his sides dropping while the other spoke; several women seemed to be looking at the burly man with cold stares.

Su Ping turned his head and asked a girl to his right, “Aren’t you going to do anything?” He could sense the magnificent energy hidden inside her. Although it was well hidden, he could still tell that she was stronger than the one on the left.

The woman’s face was cold. There was a green leaf adornment on her forehead, which revealed to many that she was the famous Thousand Leaves Holy Lady from the Holy Oriole Academy.

It was said that she was a living treasure in her academy; a super genius like none had seen in hundreds of years!

Obviously, the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady didn’t expect Su Ping to talk to her instead of accepting the challenge. Her face was cold; although she hated the brutish man, she also despised cowards like Su Ping who planned to hide behind a woman’s back.

“You want me to help you?” asked the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady with a cold tone.

Before Su Ping could reply, Oasis Dragon King was unable to bear watching any longer. Even though Su Ping wasn’t a student of the Amir Royal Academy, he had gotten a recommendation through them and represented its honor. Not only did he dodge my previous challenge, he’s dodging again now?

“The president didn’t give you a recommendation so that you would desert at the first chance!” said Oasis Dragon King coldly.

“...”

Su Ping was lost for words. Fine. It was impossible for him to explain himself. He had planned to give the girl a chance to get back at the challenger for his disrespect toward females, but since she refused it, so be it.

“Let’s do it then.”

Su Ping rose from the circle and flew straight towards the island without delay.

At the middle of the hill—the woman next to Yuan Linglu shook her head and said, “He’s rather strong, but too much of a coward. How embarrassing!”

Earlier on, Su Ping had been faster than most people and claimed a seat, which was a clear sign of his capabilities. However, personality was just as important as talent when walking on the path of cultivation, and there was obviously too much cowardice in Su Ping’s personality. Nobody else here would have dodged a challenge.

Even if they couldn’t win, they would still stand to the end!

Yuan Linglu frowned in confusion; she didn’t think that the Su Ping she knew was a coward.

The man had made a scene at the Tower before he even became a Legendary warrior!

It wouldn’t be outrageous to call Su Ping lawless on the Blue Planet!

She was quite pissed when Su Ping competed with her over the mysterious realm back on Longtai Mountain. How could such a man chicken out?

Has the vast world in the Federation left him in awe and changed his attitude?

“Is he Dragon Devil from the Dragon Tomb Academy?”

“I wonder if Brother Su can handle him. It’ll be embarrassing if he’s defeated.”

“We can’t afford two consecutive failures. Although these failures wouldn’t alter any ranking...”

At the middle of the hill, a few candidates from the Amir Royal Academy frowned in worries. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Su Ping had shown enormous strength when he had bested Koro with one punch, but his current opponent was a monster that couldn’t be underestimated, just like any other contender seated on the hilltop.

Whoosh!

The tall and dark Dragon Devil followed after Su Ping and entered the island.

Very soon, glittering chains rose from the edge of the island and locked it up.

The people at the hilltop watched in a quiet and relaxed manner, except for Oasis Dragon King who was staring at Su Ping with grim eyes.

The moment they came to the island, the Dragon Devil said to Su Ping proudly, “I’ll give you a chance to admit defeat, that way you won’t get hurt!”

His blatant arrogance was present in every expression and every look.

Su Ping: “You just stole my line.”

“Ha, you’re asking to be killed!”

The Dragon Devil laughed, and soon turned cold. He was indeed arrogant, but he was never careless when it came to battles.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

He summoned his battle pets. Many dragons and demon pets appeared; all of them had a Star State cultivation and were releasing daunting auras.

His pets were of a very high quality; they had surely been trained extensively.

Su Ping glanced at them and nodded.

He found that the geniuses’ pets were evidently much stronger than those of normal battle pet warriors he usually received in his store.

“You seem to love dragons.” Su Ping saw that his opponent had summoned six dragons. Although dragons were the best pets, their inclusion could alter the balance in a lineup if there were too many of them.

“Of course. The Dragon Tomb Academy respects dragons more than anything else; Dragons are the strongest pets. You may get to see a full lineup of dragons if you’re lucky!”

Dragon Devil sneered.

Training dragons was much more costly than training regular pets. Even a genius such as himself didn’t have enough resources to establish an exclusive lineup of dragons, unless he filled some spots with inferior breeds. Still, that would be a pointless choice.

Su Ping nodded. A vortex appeared next to him, and the Inferno Dragon stepped out.

“Come on and warm up.” Su Ping chuckled. “I’ve found some sparring partners for you.”

Intense fire arose in the Inferno Dragon’s eyes; its bones cracked, and auras ascended from its claws, making it increasingly stronger. Then, it opened its mouth and roared!

Roar!!

The roar was utterly majestic!

It echoed throughout the island and the hill. All the students who were seated on the hill felt that their hearts had skipped a beat and their muscles were contracting.

What a menacing dragon!

Many people were shocked by the horrific beast!

Dragon Devil changed his expression as he stood right in front of the Inferno Dragon. The six dragons next to him trembled as if in awe; hierarchy was very important for dragons, and they were more strongly intimidated than other pets.

“This dragon... is good!”

Dragon Devil’s eyes suddenly glittered. He gazed at Su Ping’s Inferno Dragon and roared with madness rising in his eyes before he merged with one of his dragons.

“Go!”

Su Ping gave a command.

The Inferno Dragon roared excitedly and flew out, raising an ocean of flames. The power of laws was surfacing on its body.
