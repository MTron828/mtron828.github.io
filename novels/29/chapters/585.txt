Chapter 588 The Strategic Pass

Roar!

A wounded beast felt the pressure coming off from the Inferno Dragon. The wild creature felt imperative to roar as if defending its territory.

The Inferno Dragon heard that protesting roar. Angered, the Inferno Dragon turned its head toward that wild beast and looked down at it from a height. Then, the dragon bellowed a roar that resonated in the entire cave!

Roar!!

The walls were shaking and the ground was going to split!

The stirred up wind blew back the beast’s fur. Being the main target of that roar, it panicked and stepped back while trembling.

The Inferno Dragon had strengthened the roar with the old dragon king’s heritage and the purple-blood dragons’ skills. The Cracking Rock Dragon was much more nervous while standing behind the Inferno Dragon, even though it knew they weren’t enemies. The fear stemmed from its primal instincts.

Kill them!

That was the order received by the Inferno Dragon and the inconspicuous Little Skeleton standing right beside it. A crimson glow rose in the skeleton’s eye sockets; it took action before anyone knew what was going on.

Bang!!

A wild beast was beheaded and the cut on its neck was neat.

Another wild beast fell to the ground. Blood was gushing out. That bloody scene scared Yun Wanli and the beasts.

Instant Ko.

But those wild beasts here were beast kings! The wounded beast that tried to contend with the Inferno Dragon was dumbstruck. But the wounded beast’s attention was more on the Little Skeleton. The beast shifted its several eyes to give its full focus.

Compared to the Inferno Dragon, the skeleton was more like Death itself!

A white-boned demon!

“Those are...”

Yun Wanli looked at Su Ping, astounded. That was the person who had been able to break into the Tower and make it out alive.

Those were his battle pets.

Yun Wanli was certain he could not have survived if the Little Skeleton had struck him.

He didn’t even see what happened when that beast king died!

Whoosh!

Su Ping didn’t waste any time while everyone was in shock. His target was another beast present.

The targeted beast felt the killing intent and the sense of danger made it come back to its senses. It snuck underground, trying to escape.

However, Su Ping was faster; he stopped the beast before it got away. He poked the beast’s spine with his sword, leaving a deep and wide cut on the beast’s back. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Blood spilled out. That beast king cried in pain.

Since Su Ping had mastered teleportation, the usual Ocean State beast kings didn’t stand a chance.

That was how much more powerful the Void State was when compared to the Ocean State!

Those wild beast kings were at the Ocean State. Their astral powers were abundant and they had the power to kill beings at the peak of the titled rank with astral powers alone. However, the Void State was a realm at which the creature was able to master abilities to manipulate space. As such, the beast kings at the Ocean State were like vulnerable babies, never standing a chance to win. Whoosh!

Whoosh!

The remaining beast kings knew that things weren’t going to end well for them. They quickly tried to escape.

The Little Skeleton was on pursuit.

In the meantime, the Inferno Dragon was targeting the wounded beast king. The moment the latter turned around to run, the Inferno Dragon stepped forward and grabbed the other with its paws. The Inferno Dragon dug its nails into the beast king’s back and exerted great strength.

Roar!

That beast king was yanked back!

The Inferno Dragon breathed out purple flames that traveled all across the beast king starting from its tail. The heat scorched the beast king’s scales and some of them dried to an extent that they would curl up.

With a bang, the Inferno Dragon stomped on the beast king’s hind legs, then pushed downward and the force was so strong that the walls trembled.

Blood was oozing out from the beast king’s head. The Inferno Dragon pinned the beast king’s neck on the ground, disabling the creature. Su Ping had told the Inferno Dragon to keep the beast king alive.

While the Inferno Dragon had the beast king under control, other beast kings were crying miserably. Su Ping and the Little Skeleton killed all the beast king escapees; all of them were currently lying in a pool of blood, with no exceptions.

The battle ended. Barely two minutes had passed.

Yun Wanli gulped as he stared at the dead beast kings and the pool of blood; he didn’t do a thing and the battle had already ended.

He had merged with his battle pet but he didn’t even have a chance to fight!

This is... What Su Ping can do.

Yun Wanli remembered when Su Ping was standing above the Graveyard Forest and he looked at those dead beast kings. He suddenly felt lucky since he had decided not to fight against Su Ping over Nan Fengtian’s issue. Otherwise, he would be the one dying; the Tower wouldn’t even have the means to avenge him.

I cannot believe we have such a person on the Blue Planet...

Is he even originally from the Blue Planet? Yun Wanli asked himself.

Su Ping was not in the mood to ponder over what Yun Wanli might be thinking. Having taken care of the fleeing beast kings, Su Ping flew to approach the beast king that was being subdued by the Inferno Dragon.

The beast king was pinned on the ground.

Su Ping stood on the beast king’s head; he was minuscule in comparison. As a matter of fact, he was merely a little bit bigger than one of the beast king’s fangs.

“Listen. Have you met a human girl, a young girl?” Su Ping asked the beast king that looked at him oddly. “Damn you, humans. We’ll soon be free from the caves and kill you all sooner or later!” The beast king felt humiliated over having Su Ping on its head; it roared to express its anger.

The Inferno Dragon tightened its grip. The scales on the beast king’s neck broke and the bones were also making cracking noises.

Su Ping kept a straight face as he looked at the suffering beast king. He took out his phone and found a picture of Su Lingyue. He squatted down and placed the picture right in front of the beast king’s half-meter large eyes. “Have you seen this girl?” The beast king’s pupils contracted as if trying to focus on the smiling girl in the picture.

S

Soon, the beast king squeezed out some words, “You puny humans. You all look alike to me and you’re all worthless. I’ll eat every one of you I see...”

Bang!

Before the beat king could finish, Su Ping directly crushed its head. Su Ping stood up. He shook the blood off his hand, put away his phone, and looked at the Inferno Dragon.

The Inferno Dragon understood what Su Ping wanted. The Inferno Dragon let go of the beast king’s neck, then cut the beast king open with one finger; the internal organs and blood fell to the ground.

The dragon then went ahead and slit open all the internal organs; the scene was too cruel to the eyes.

Yun Wanli turned pale but Su Ping was unaffected. All of a sudden, Yun Wanli began to understand why the young man had been able to scare away the evil energy at the Graveyard Forest; he certainly had become used to that hellish scene.

Is this young man even from the human world?

The Inferno Dragon finished the search moments later. There was some acid in the beast king’s stomach but nothing else, nothing else being digested.

Su Ping saw that; he flew toward the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder and went away.

The Inferno Dragon generated a ball of purple flames to burn off the blood on its paws and moved ahead.

The Little Skeleton was sitting properly on the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder as well. Yun Wanli needed a few seconds before he could come back to his senses. He called the Cracking Rock Dragon and the Ghost Eye to go after Su Ping.

The Cracking Rock Dragon and the Ghost Eye looked at each other; both could see their shared astonishment as they saw each other’s eyes.

“Fate Challenger Su, wait for me!”

Yun Wanli had soon caught up; he stopped the merging with his beast, so the Winged Wind Listener re-emerged behind him.

The Cracking Rock Dragon and the Ghost Eye followed Yun Wanli gingerly. Now and then, they would dart a fearful look at the young man sitting on the Inferno Dragon’s shoulder.

The Cracking Rock Dragon was afraid of the Inferno Dragon, and even more afraid of the Inferno Dragon’s master, Su Ping. The Cracking Rock Dragon decided never to talk as casually as before.

“Sir, is this the strategic pass you mentioned?”

A moment later, Su Ping saw a horizontal cave right in front of them, forming a “T” shaped pass. He then saw some remains and swords that were half-buried in the ground.
