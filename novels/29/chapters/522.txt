Chapter 523 Mountains Split!

All senses were cut off in that Space of Slaughter, a place constituted by nothing but darkness. Not even pain could be felt; you wouldn’t even know if you were being attacked.

As Legend Pluto’s Force Field spun, blood, and a foul smell continued to assault Su Ping who was inside; he felt like he was submerged in blood.

Well, I... missed that feeling.

Su Ping felt his eyes were turning red as he took in the smell of blood.

He moved his eyeballs in the darkness as if looking around.

What?

Legend Pluto stopped in his tracks when he was just about to strike.

He felt chills, deep in his heart. That Space of Slaughter-one he was so familiar with-was hiding a monster he could not see.

Legend Pluto immediately looked into the Space of Slaughter; he had a clear view, since it was his domain. Soon after, he found that Su Ping was looking right at him, with his blood-red eyes.

He’s able to see me?

Legend Pluto was filled with trepidation.

Right then, bolts of lightning flashed around Su Ping. A loud noise resounded in that quiet, dark space. Su Ping turned into a bolt of lightning that charged toward the Legendary warrior.

Legend Pluto was no longer wondering about it; Su Ping was able to feel him!

Of course, he didn’t have the luxury of time to prolong this contemplation...

Because Su Ping was moving simply too fast!

“Ghost Blood Corpses!” Legend Pluto resorted to a legendary skill that was able to produce horrors. Ghosts wailed in the Space of Slaughter. Behind this senior rose a huge shadow. In the meantime, his colorless skin began to take on a red color.

His completely black eyes, including the sclera, glimmered with a red glow. Some strange grains covered him, accentuating his gloomy and cold aura.

Boom!

Legend Pluto turned into a blood corpse; he growled and got ready for Su Ping’s strike. The entire Space of Slaughter shook violently. Once a muffled sound was heard, the space of darkness was torn apart.

The glaring virtual fist was about to topple the entire Nightfall Mountain!

Boom!!

The air was rippling and the mountain was shaking. Legend Pluto violently smashed into the ground, creating a cave due to the sheer force.

All the legendary battle pet warriors on the mountain were panic-stricken.

They saw how Legend Pluto took action out of anger; he had merged with his most powerful pet and built up the Space of Slaughter which had made him famous. The Space of Slaughter could not only isolate Su Ping’s senses but also from those outside, except for the caster, Legend Pluto. The legendary battle pet warriors saw space being torn apart and Legend Pluto flying out from it, even before they could get an idea of the situation inside.

Space was cracked?!

So quickly? It couldn’t have happened.

Legend Pluto was at the Void State. Not even an enemy of the same rank could have defeated him so.

The other legendary battle pet warriors, including Legend North King, stared with utter disbelief. Su Ping was standing in the air, like the god of all that was evil, and that pair of blood-red eyes could swallow every living being in the world. He was able to make their blood curdle! How many killings did he go through to become like this?

Legend North King was the most stunned of all. Su Ping wasn’t like that at the Supremacy League. How could he have become such a fiend in a couple of days?

No one was able to progress that fast!

The Ocean State battle pet warriors were too astonished to speak. They could no longer belittle that young man here. He was simply much more powerful than they were. No wonder the previous two legendary battle pet warriors had died within a single move. That young man was a demon in human skin. He had to be at the Void State!

Even at the peak of the Void State!

How scary!

They had never heard of such a man before. He had risen to prominence, seemingly getting out from nowhere!

Slap!

Legend Pluto crawled out from the rubble and got out from the pit on the ground. His chest had caved in; blood of a dark purple color was coming out from his mouth and nose. He wasn’t entirely a human right then. The bodily structures have changed. He should be regarded as a new kind of existence.

Again, his embarrassed state had yet again transfixed others.

“You-hmph!”

Legend Pluto felt he had become numb after experiencing that much pain; the bones in his chest broke. He glared at Su Ping who was in the sky in disbelief and rage.

The senior thought death was knocking on his door. The guy was a monster.

Su Ping looked down on Legend Pluto coldly. He summoned the Dark Dragon Hound back in case other legendary battle pet warriors would sneak up on his pet while he fought them.

While the Dark Dragon Hound was unusually strong, it was merely at the Ocean State, but there were five legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State!

“Of all the legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State, you are the weakest one,” Su Ping said with contempt, “Give me what I am asking for and I will spare you a life.”

Legend Pluto became red in the face from anger and quaked with rage.

I’m the weakest of all the legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Seriously?

Of all the legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State present, he was one of the three most powerful ones!

The other legendary battle pet warriors at the Void State weren’t any more pleased to hear that. Two of them were weaker than him; Su Ping was shaming Legend Pluto, so he was shaming them as well!

Arrogant!

Su Ping’s words echoed in the air. All the legendary battle pet warriors and the titled-rank servants were able to feel how proud and arrogant the young man was.

Upset as they were—ever since the horrifying strength of the young man-no one argued with him.

He had defeated Legend Pluto; he would enjoy such a high status.

Unfortunately, Su Ping had chosen to be on the bad side of the Tower.

The legendary and titled battle pet warriors would not willingly decipher that young man.

Why was he doing that, just for people of one base city?

Was it all worthwhile?

That was the Tower, for crying out loud. The most powerful organization of the Blue Planet!

He had not only ruined his future; he had also found himself an intimidating enemy by offending the Tower, just for the sake of some puny and pitiful lives.

So stupid. Everyone was thinking different things but no one expressed it outright. “You want my stuff? Keep dreaming!” Legend Pluto bit his teeth. If he were to hand over whatever Su Ping was asking for after this beating, he would be so disgraced that he would never be able to stand up straight in front of his peers.

Su Ping sneered. “So, you will cry only when death is staring you in the face!”

“Why don’t you find out?” Legend Pluto was not backing down. “Humph!”

From a red lotus stood up a bold, old man. He was glaring, like the sun and magnificent, like the ocean. When people looked at him, they would feel that their minds and hearts had been purified. They would have a momentary peace and quietness. “The Tower is not a place for your wild actions!” The old man glared at Su Ping.

Behind him appeared his Force Field inside which was a fairyland. With picturesque flowers and birds inside and the gurgling springs, the Force Field was extremely beautiful and peaceful. “Legend Buddhist Sound!” The titled battle pet warriors trembled as they laid eyes on the old man. He was at the Void State and he was from the continent named the Southern Ocean, where the temperature was hot and the environment humid. People there worshiped many gods and deities. Each base city on that continent was named after a god or a deity.

Su Ping gazed at the old man. He shared his view about that fairyland Force Field. “People say that Force Fields are reflections of the mind. Your Force Field is peaceful and pure but is reduced to nothing but a form. If you do have a kind heart, you wouldn’t have just sat here, raising your wine cup and chatting merrily. You must know that more than one base city out there is under attack!” Su Ping forcefully articulated.

When the Longjiang Base City was under attack, many from other base cities offered to help.

Su Ping was reading the news at that time. He later learned that there were other base cities under attack at the same time, other than Longjiang Base City. But those base cities didn’t get much attention because no beast kings like the Otherworld Heavenly King were there.

“Kindness is a smart man’s virtue. Willfully risking our lives is not kindness, but foolishness,” the bald, old man refuted. “The Deep Caves need to be guarded at all times. Who can tell when someone over there will be sacrificed? We must keep our powers at all times. We do not have spare hands to help out those base cities.

“There are over fifty base cities in your Subcontinent District. What is one less?

“Do you know what the big picture means? Do you want us to turn our back on all of mankind for the sake of one or two base cities?”

“Haha!”

Su Ping burst out plasma laughter out of pure anger. “Nicely put, turning back on all of mankind. You’re comparing the lives of the world and that of one or two base cities, huh? The Deep Caves need people. Does that justify your sorry effort to cling to your life here? I seriously wonder about the real number of legendary battle pet warriors that are actually stationed at the Deep Caves!”

“Hmm, you are a legendary battle pet warrior but you withheld that information and didn’t come here to report for duty. What gives you the courage to talk about justice?” the old man argued. “You must have become a legendary battle pet warrior for four to five hundred years to reach this stage. However, you’ve hidden this fact for hundreds of years to avoid your duty. Now your hometown is in danger and you decide to step out?”

Su Ping laughed at the sky. “Who told you that I’m at the legendary rank? if I were, I would have slapped each one of you already!”

“You-hmph!

“Nonsense!”

The old man flew into a rage.

Su Ping’s words had riled up the other legendary battle pet warriors again. Su Ping indeed had every right to be aggressive and arrogant but this was over the line!

Slapping each one?

The legendary battle pet warriors?

Legend North King fulminated. “Su Ping, mind your attitude. This is the Tower. Do not, for a second think you can do whatever you want just because of your strength. You’re at the Void State. But do you know that there’s the Fate State? You’ll be doomed when the Fate State chief of the Tower comes here!”

Su Ping grinned sarcastically. “Of course I know there are people at the Fate State in the Tower. But no one can stop me when I want to leave. Why else do you think I am staying here, wasting time with you? Now, give me the herb I want and I will leave right away. I don’t want to waste another second with the lot of you. From now on, the Tower will no longer be part of my business!”

“I have no use for the Soul Nurturer but I will never give that to you!” Legend North King laughed grimly. “Wait for the chief to cut your head off.”

Su Ping was boiling with rage.

“Go to hell!!”

Boom!

A beam of glaring red light shone around Su Ping and blood seeped out from the cracks of the white bones. He had already overexerted himself back when he was fighting the Otherworld Heavenly King, passing out from exhaustion later.

He had already slept for two days but had not fully recovered. And yet, Su Ping didn’t mind his tiredness. He burned his blood and turned that into energy.

Roar!

Suddenly, a dragon’s roar sounded.

The claps of thunder were the answer to the dragon’s roar.

Su Ping roared and turned into a bolt of lightning, exuding a shocking coercion, like a meteorite that was pressing against the Blue Planet. With Divine Energy erupting from his fist, he slammed down on Legend Pluto into the ground.

That punch was like a meteorite, like a comet falling, invincible! The sneer froze on Legend Pluto’s face. Having reached the Void State, he had already started to learn how to manipulate space. He was able to see how the void was collapsing under Su Ping’s punch.

Space would cave in wherever his fist passed, leaving behind some dark traces.

“No, this cannot be!”

Legend Pluto was panic-stricken. He could barely bat his eyes.

He shouted, wildly, and summoned his beast kings to protect him. He unleashed many legendary defensive skills, one after another.

However, that invincible fist had crushed all of the barriers and armor formed with legendary skills!

It was just as if Legend Pluto would have painted an exquisite painting and yet Su Ping had torn it into pieces!

“I cannot die!!” Legend Pluto cried.

The punch landed on him the next second.

With a boom, the Nightfall Mountain trembled, from the peak to the foot of the mountain.

The formerly hovering mountain was falling, falling down!

Boom!!

The landing of the mountain had caused a violent shake and a loud noise once again. The mountain was split due to the impact caused by the landing; those who were previously standing on the mountain rebounded as it hit the ground. But, apart from a few titled battle pet warriors, the others remained unhurt.

Some reacted fast enough and took to the sky before the mountain fell. Fright was frozen on their faces as they stared at the fallen mountain.

The ancient mountain that had been in the Mysterious Realm for countless ages was crushed!

The mountain was split into many hills with the impact. The buildings and pavilions on the mountain were shattered.

No one was able to utter a single word. No one could have imagined any of that.

“Where is Legend Pluto?”

“Look, his pets.”

Soon, someone remembered to ask about Legend Pluto, but it seemed that he had been buried under the ruins. Someone noticed his battle pets instead.

Those beast kings were massive; they would be easily spotted. However, equally easy to spot was the dull look on their faces.
