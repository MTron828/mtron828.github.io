Chapter 1342 The Red Dome Realm (1)

In front of the convoy—the bandits took away the treasures they demanded. Then they looked at each other and chose to leave.

Right when they boarded the spaceship, an enormous shadow surfaced outside the channel near the spaceship. It was a behemoth-like creature that had risen from the deep void. Its scary appearance shocked all those present.

Bang!

The behemoth struck the channel fiercely, producing a crack.

The crack had already been there for a while. It was the hole used by the spaceship to break in. That was why the aura was leaking to the exterior and the Void Beasts noticed it.

“Damn it, run!”

The people on the spaceship slightly changed their expressions. They quickly took off with their spaceship and ignored the Void Beasts.

“Those assholes!” cursed the people of the trade group upon seeing them flee, then summoned their guards, ready to resist the enemy.

Exactly at that moment-a magnificent figure thousands of meters tall emerged in the region of space outside the channel. It looked like a floating island. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The spaceship had just broken out of the channel, when it was suddenly frozen in the void. After that, the spacecraft exploded in a dazzling manner.

No one could tell what kind of power had attacked the spaceship, but all the people on board panicked and fled to the void. However, they were ensnared by some sort of power before they could run off. It seemed that there was an attraction force from a certain point, pulling them over. Screams burst out when they reached the final point.

Screams were let out by every single one of the people caught. Bloody scenes occurred; everybody on the spaceship was minced by some sort of power.

......

Bang.

While everybody was watching—the channel trembled and cracks appeared.

The enormous figure waved its claws and smashed at all the people inside the channel. “It’s a beast king!”

“How can there possibly be a beast king in this place?”

“Contact the God Emperors immediately…”

Exclamations came from the convoy; all the guards were panicking. That Void Beast was too frightening for them to resist. They had to flee.

Whoosh!

The siblings who had just left their carriage flew back fast. Once they passed by the carriage, the girl named Val paused and lifted the window curtain. “Don’t stay here anymore. Run…!”

She was stunned when she realized the situation inside the carriage.

It was empty. Not only was Su Ping nowhere to be seen, but the kids traveling with him had also disappeared.

“How about that? They’ve already fled.” The burly man quickly pulled his sister. “Let’s run; just ignore them. We’re truly unlucky this time… Let’s try to survive first.”

The girl was really quick to react, immediately running off with her brother.

Exactly at that moment-a devastating scream was heard coming from somewhere behind them.

The scream was so loud it seemed to sound right next to their ears; both of them were quite taken aback. They turned around and saw the most shocking scene: That Void Beast King—which was thousands of meters tallhad been beheaded!

There was a terrifying, glowing sword aura on its body, leaving a trace hundreds of meters long, which had pierced through.

“Well…”

Both of them were dazed.

Aside from the pair of siblings, the others who were fleeing in panic stopped, also shocked by the scene.

Did one of the God Emperors show up?

Very soon, they saw a slim and tall man in front of the beast king. His black hair fluttered in the wind; there were also a few youngsters around him, who looked like his servants.

“This is…”

Val widened her eyes in disbelief.

Her brother’s eyeballs were almost popping out as he looked at the man in disbelief. They couldn’t be mistaken: the guy was none other than the lazy man sharing their carriage.

This looks like a beast from the Illusory World…

In midair-Su Ping slew the Void Beast, that was as strong as a God King. He had the special feeling again and was astonished by it.

It was his first time fighting a Void Beast. It reminded him of when he first grasped the law of illusion.

Once he thought about the law of illusion, Su Ping remembered the figures he had encountered when he studied said law. The nine layers of space making up the universe didn’t include the Illusory World nor the Path Source World; they seemed to be in a place that was beyond that universe.

Su Ping dismissed those random thoughts and looked back at all the people behind him. He chose to leave once he noticed that the brother and sister duo were fine. He snapped out with a few more sword auras, killing the other Void Beasts gathering nearby; then he took out the Red Dome Realm’s badge and teleported away.

For him, that had been just a trivial incident during his journey.

But after Su Ping left… Everybody was still replaying that scene in their minds.

“I didn’t know he was that strong…”

Val looked at the last place where Su Ping floated before leaving, still in a daze. She finally understood why he had told them he was leaving. The guy had no need to cross continents through that channel; he could use a personal teleportation at any moment.

“He’s so strong. He finished off the beast king so quickly; he must be one of the strongest God Kings, if not a…” her brother mumbled in astonishment, regretting not having been more enthusiastic when they were in the carriage with Su Ping. He could have received some pointers had he made a good impression.

In the Fire God Palace of the Red Dome Realm.

That place was at the realm’s core. The Fire God Palace was also the strongest force, which dominated the entire Red Dome Realm.

The place was scorching hot. The soil was blackened and cracked; there was nothing green within a range of tens of thousands of kilometers. Few plants grew in that place, and all of them were extremely precious. Some of them were ever-burning blades of grass, while some were blackened trees, with burning red fruits hanging from their branches. They were all defended by divine beasts.
