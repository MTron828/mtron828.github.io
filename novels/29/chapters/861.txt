Chapter 864: Domination

Ripples were spread on the sword-class monument, and the young man who carried a wooden sword stepped out.

The wooden sword remained on his back; he seemed quite relaxed and harmless. He instantly received the attention of the seven Star Lords the moment he got out.

He remained casual, as if being the center of attention was a matter of course wherever he went, as it had been since birth.

He had already gotten used to it.

Whoosh!

Another man stepped out of a monument right then. He was tall and majestic, none other than Dragon Emperor.

There had been tiredness in his eyes, but he quickly hid this before he stepped out of the monument, for an emperor would never show weakness. He indifferently glanced around and saw the young man who carried a wooden sword in front of the sword-class monument. Then, he became relaxed.

The guy came out at the same time as I did?

So, we probably climbed a similar number of floors.

However, the dragon-class monument was more difficult, and had a higher point coefficient!

It meant that he had accumulated more points than that guy!

So much for the Sword God’s heir.

The young man with a wooden sword frowned when he saw Dragon Emperor. His thoughts moved along the exact same lines as the latter’s did, and began to question himself. Am I really weaker than that guy?

He had tried his best while going through the monument’s challenges.

After all, he wouldn’t be exposed even if he used his trump cards there.

He was unwilling to believe he had gotten that result.

Several other people stepped out of their monuments while that pair were still gazing and measuring each other; they were Holy King, the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady, Queen of the Seas and the rest.

A cold and indifferent voice was heard coming from Dragon Emperor’s back. “Move away.”

The surface of the dragon-class monument rippled and Oasis Dragon King stepped out. His hair dangled casually; he looked down at everybody else as majestically as Dragon Emperor had.

Everybody gazed at him as he stepped out; nobody underestimated the best student of the Amir Royal Academy.

Dragon Emperor narrowed his eyes and looked at him dangerously after hearing that cold demand.

The people in front of the score monument immediately took notice of them when they left the monument. However, they didn’t seem excited; there was disappointment instead.

The young man carrying a wooden sword, Dragon Emperor and the others sensed their crestfallen attitude; it was somewhat puzzling. Not bothering to ask, they simply flew towards the score monument.

All of them were eager to find out who was the one who had won first place.

None of the best geniuses of the five academies would be willing to give in to someone else. Still, it was obvious that they wouldn’t try their very best in that place. Their final stage would be the upcoming Universe Geniuses’ Contest.

Nevertheless, they could gauge their gaps in strength from that monument testing.

“I’m going to be at the top!”

Holy King chuckled and flew away proudly.

The young man with a wooden sword also flew over with a calm mood.

Dragon Emperor laughed when he heard Holy King’s claim. He didn’t say anything, but despise and disdain were obvious on his face.

“They’re all out.”

“What a shame. It’s truly hopeless now.”

“We can’t compare to that monster, but we’ll definitely get second place!”

“Humph, weren’t the top two geniuses of the Huge Mia College arrogant? Have you seen your ranking?”

The geniuses in front of the ranking display wore complicated expressions; although they were regretting having lost the chance of rising to the top, they were still arguing amongst themselves about their rankings.

“Huh?”

The young man with a wooden sword was shocked by the whispers he heard.

He then gazed at the top of the magnificent score monument, only to see that he wasn’t there; Dragon Emperor wasn’t there, either, nor Oasis Dragon King. Instead, it was a surprising person.

Him?

The young master was stunned, just like being struck by lightning; disbelief and fright appeared in his eyes.

95 floors?

He was stupefied. His head went blank when he saw the horrifying point coefficient and the type of monument the man had challenged.

95 floors in the all-class monument!

Did something go wrong?

Dragon Emperor, Oasis Dragon King, the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady and the others saw the point monument right then. All of them looked at the top of the rank.

Each of them had thought there was hope of securing the top, but then they were similarly shocked to see the person who was really at the top.

The number of floors and the points achieved by Su Ping were mind boggling.

Those numbers exceeded their imagination!

They might have had a chance to reach a similar result if they were to train in the Illusionary God Monument Mysterious Realm for months. And yet, someone had reached the 95th floor on the first try?

To top it off, he had challenged the most difficult all-class monument!

“H—Him...?”

Oasis Dragon King was left in a daze when he saw who it was. He lost control of his face and openly displayed the shock he was feeling.

The person who had claimed the top was Su Ping, the man who had traveled on the same spaceship as he had.

Is the guy that strong?

He suddenly remembered the time when he had challenged Su Ping to a duel and the latter declined...

His lips twitched. He had originally taken Su Ping as a coward, but the results made it obvious; the man thought of him as Koro, who was too weak to compete with him.

But, could Koro compare to him?

He could easily defeat Koro with a single hand!

However, it seemed that they were the same in Su Ping’s eyes. That was so humiliating!

Koro: ??? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Suddenly, a furious exclamation burst out. “I can’t believe this!”

Dragon Emperor widened his eyes with coldness and fury. He searched the names in the monument and found that he was in third place, right under the Sword God’s heir. His heart was aching when he turned to address the seven Star Lords. He asked, “Is there something wrong with this monument?”

The seven Star Lords remained calm. Only the one from the Dragon Tomb Academy had an awkward look, as Dragon Emperor had lost his cool, unlike his usual pride and calmness.

“The score monument never fails,” said the instructor from Amir with a cold, yet amused tone. By questioning the point monument, the man was essentially questioning Su Ping, who was representing his academy. How could he not defend him?

“That’s right. We went and confirmed this with the master of this place; the score monument is in perfect working order,” the Star Lord of the Dragon Tomb Academy quickly added, hoping that Dragon Emperor would stop embarrassing them. He knew that everything was real and even the master of that place had become interested in the top ranker!

“!!”

Dragon Emperor was about to say more, but instantly paused when his instructor stopped him and mentioned the Ascendant State expert. But then his shock intensified.

He had climbed more than seventy floors, and he knew how difficult it was.

Reaching the 80th floor was beyond his abilities, and yet someone had gone all the way to the 95th?

Didn’t that mean that the man could easily crush him?

They were both in the Fate State; how could their gap be that wide?

Dragon Emperor found it hard to accept. He felt that he had touched the ceiling of the Fate State, that only the super extraordinary geniuses could compare to him. However, his pride was deflated before the start of his journey in the Universe Geniuses’ Contest.

His questioning and the Star Lord’s response were heard by a lot of people. The young man carrying a wooden sword, the Thousand Leaves Holy Lady and the others were silent; their faces showed troubled expressions.

It was true.

The man who had defeated Dragon Devil with his pet was actually so strong it was horrifying.

They had thought that he was a pure controller whose power mainly depended on his pet.

However, he was obviously much stronger; a pure controller couldn’t have climbed to the 95th level!

“He hid himself really well!” The Thousand Leaves Holy Lady wore a complicated expression; she remembered how reluctant Su Ping was to answer Dragon Devil’s challenge. She had considered his decision as cowardly, but now it seemed that he must have regarded Dragon Devil as nothing more than a mere bug.

No one would be willing to answer the challenge of a bug.

Therefore, he had been reluctant to attack when challenged in public. Although he seemed to be flinching, he wasn’t scared of fighting.

After all, Dragon Devil was an ant that he could easily suppress!

They were both in the Fate State, yet their gap was tremendous.

The Thousand Leaves Holy Lady was losing confidence; she was the strongest student of the Holy Oriole Academy. There were high hopes that she could show everybody how powerful their academy was.

But then she started to doubt herself after such a development.

Am I really as unparalleled and distinguished as my instructors say?

If she was a rare genius that emerged once in several hundred years, what would that guy be?

Not far from her, the young man who carried a wooden sword fell silent as he gazed at the top of the rank.

He gradually clenched his fists inside his sleeves, dropping the harmless smile on his face; he became as cold and hard as a rock.

On the other side, Holy King and Queen of the Seas—two top geniuses from the Hugh Mia Academy—looked at each other in silence. Their arrogance faded away.

Who would have thought that such a horrifying monster would come along?

Are all the contestants in the Universe Geniuses’ Contest like him? Goddess of Light seemed confused. Her instructors had told her that she had a good chance of securing a good ranking in the star zone matches, based on the data from previous Universe Geniuses’ Contests. She had felt uncomfortable and underestimated earlier on—

But at the moment... She truly had a glimpse of the boundless universe.

So, there are truly unreasonable geniuses in the vast territory of the Federation!

There was a silent person in the crowd.

It was none other than Yuan Linglu.

She had exited the monument a long time before, having only reached the 35th floor, which was among the lowest rankings. It was slightly frustrating for her, even though her instructors had told her to consider this as a chance to gain experience.

She actually agreed with that advice; after all, she had seen how horrifying the two top geniuses were, back in her academy. She was also in the Fate State, but they had left a deep impression on her, making her realize there were much stronger geniuses out there.

For example, the guys who had one of the top ten divine constitutions were able to become real geniuses.

However, she didn’t expect that the man born on the same home planet would keep on shining brightly after stealing her legacy and challenging the Tower on the Blue Planet!

He seemed to be even more horrifying than when seen him on the Blue Planet.

Even the two top geniuses had been suppressed by him!

Was it really possible for her to train hard and later seek revenge?

Yuan Linglu felt how the goal in her heart collapsed, as it had become something forever unattainable.

While everyone remained silent, the time for the score monument to be updated had arrived, and the golden light appeared again.

The geniuses, who had been brooding over their failure, couldn’t help themselves—they looked at the new rankings, only to be even more devastated. The guy at the very top had gained even more points, and was currently on the 96th floor!

Is he going to climb all the way to the 99th floor without stopping?

Someone held their head with both hands, feeling that the world had gone crazy.

Dragon Emperor and the others were silent; their faces looked awful too.

The surface of the all-class monument rippled at that moment, and then a person stepped out. He was none other than Su Ping.

Everybody fixed their eyes upon him just then.

He’s out!

They felt relief for some reason at the moment.

Dragon Emperor and the young man who carried a wooden sword were obviously more relaxed, but their eyes were filled with solemnity; the new arrival was all they could see at the moment.

“Huh?”

Su Ping was surprised to receive that much attention. He looked around and saw that all the students who were on the hill were all there. Does this mean that I was the last to come out?

He realized what had happened, so he flew to check the score monument. He then found that his projection was at the very top.

Su Ping slightly raised his eyebrows, wondering if he had shown off a tad too much...

He wasn’t too surprised by the result.

However, Su Ping was quite surprised upon seeing the rankings of the young man who carried a wooden sword, Dragon Emperor and the other geniuses who had claimed a seat on the hilltop.

Those guys seemed to be weaker than he had thought at first.
