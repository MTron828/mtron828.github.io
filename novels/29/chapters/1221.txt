Chapter 1222: Sales

At the counter—Joanna was receiving customers and Tang Ruyan was helping maintain order. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Green Lady stood in the lobby; she was in charge of receiving pets and taking them to the pet room for training. There was no work in the store; most customers were quite obedient, so they weren’t busy.

“The professional training for the last batch of pets is done. Ask their masters to claim them,” said Su Ping to Joanna.

Joanna was the temporary manager while he was away, and even when he was back, she still acted as the head of employees. She instantly asked the sutra old man to inform the owners.

The old fellow had already registered in the virtual universe. He didn’t like being bossed around by Joanna, but he didn’t object since Su Ping was around. He went into the virtual universe with a smile and informed them.

Su Ping went to the other room where pets were sold.

He hadn’t restocked the shelves in a long time. The pets he had caught back in the Blue Planet had already been sold out; the room was absolutely empty at the moment.

Su Ping instantly summoned his last catch, the Black Emperor Red Feather Phoenix and placed it on the shelf.

The system quickly examined the pet and decided its price—

Black Emperor Red Feather Phoenix

Property: Ancient Phoenix

Rank: Ascendant State

Combat Strength: 72,283

Aptitude: Mid Level

Bloodline Potential: Celestial State

Talent Abilities: Ancient Phoenix’s True Flames, Reversed Fire…

Ascendant State Mark: Red Phoenix Mark

Laws: Perfect time and space… Perfect chaos… Perfect destruction… Perfect fire…

Dao Glyphs: Fire (56%) Darkness (12%)

…

After the evaluation, the final price was set at 230 million energy points.

“So expensive? Wait… So cheap?”

Su Ping was rather shocked and excited by the price set. The cost of a single beast-catching ring was only two million energy points, six of them would amount to twelve million. He had made a huge profit!

In terms of astral coins, the price would be 23 billion.

It sounded like a lot, but it was unbelievably cheap for an Ascendant pet. It was almost being given away for free!

One had to consider how most Star Lords had trillions in savings.

Still, Su Ping didn’t plan to sell at the market price. After all, very few Ascendant pets were available on the market as things were. He had already become used to the system’s sales methodology. The income was a significant amount of energy for him, enough for him to enter the mysterious Remains of High Heavens twice!

I’ll be able to upgrade the store if I catch four more of these pets.

Adding my old savings, I only need to catch three of them.

Su Ping glanced at the Black Emperor Red Feather Phoenix currently on sale. The pet had an extraordinary appearance and had a combat strength of more than seventy thousand points. It was as strong as a Heavenly Lord.

Most Ascendant’s combat strength was at about 10,000 on average.

The upper limit was 100,000.

Those with a combat strength of 70,000 points were mostly Heavenly Lords. Those close to the 100,000 mark were top Heavenly Lords; even the old Heavenly Lords such as Song Yuan would have a hard time achieving that.

“The beast’s aptitude is only at the mid level. What a shame; I wouldn’t mind keeping it as my own if it were in the upper level. That way I would meet the second requirement for the store upgrade, which is an Ascendant pet with a high-level aptitude.”

Su Ping shook his head. That pet was indeed strong, but it wasn’t good enough for him anymore; he could easily beat it to tears.

He opened the system store and checked, then bought a few rare materials. They were necessary for some pets, but their prices were really low; at least for Su Ping. He would rather give them to the Little Skeleton and his other pets. The food might not be suitable for them, but at least it could keep their bellies full.

Once back behind the counter, Su Ping saw that a few men entered the store. They were the customers who were there to claim their pets.

Those who wanted to train their pets had to wait in line, but the ones picking up their pets had a shortcut.

“Tang.”

Su Ping called for Tang Ruyan. Seeing how curious she was, he said, “Let the customers know that an Ascendant pet is available for sale in this store and that they’re free to buy it as long as they’re in the Ascendant State. Star Lords can’t keep it in check.”

Even though Star Lords could contract Ascendant pets, it rarely happened in that universe, because the gap between the Ascendant State and the Star Lord State was too wide. Whenever in danger, the Ascendant pet could always abandon their master without suffering any restraint.

It was like tying a ferocious tiger to a baby. Not even the members of major families would dare to do that, fearing that the tiger would go crazy again.

After all, whoever was protected by an Ascendant pet was oftentimes a core member of such families; it would be hilarious if they got killed by their own pet.

“An Ascendant State pet is available?”

Tang Ruyan felt disappointed, expecting him to tell her something else, until she realized what she had heard. She looked at Su Ping in shock.

She was no longer the idiot she used to be when she arrived in the Federation; she already knew how extraordinary Ascendants were in that territory.

Ascendant cultivators were the kings when the Celestials were away!

“Yes. First come, first serve; if interested, they can come and take a look,” said Su Ping.

“Well… Fine.”

Tang Ruyan didn’t know what else to say, and could only accept the request.

Both Joanna and Green Lady heard what he said; they looked at Su Ping with troubled expressions.?Su Ping grew to such an extent in the blink of an eye??An Ascendant pet was just as strong as them; it would be sold that casually…

“This guy…” the cauldron woman couldn’t help but mumble

She had spent a lot of time surfing the virtual universe in recent days and learned a lot about the new age. Little did she expect that the brat she could easily crush would sell a pet at her level. She experienced a feeling of crisis. Su Ping would probably abandon her casually if she didn’t work hard to improve herself.

The rest of the customers also learned the news and were shocked, just as Su Ping’s word began to spread.

Still, those customers were all between the Star State and the Star Lord State; some were even weaker. But all customers under the Star State had sold their positions in the waiting line to others for high prices, so all the customers who entered Su Ping’s store were between the Star State and the Star Lord State.

An Ascendant State pet is available!

The crowded street outside Su Ping’s store started to boil upon hearing the shocking news.

All the people waiting in line were dumbfounded by Tang Ruyan’s words. Many of them quickly sent word to the major forces backing them through their watches.

A lot of people immediately tore the void apart and arrived in the sky above Su Ping’s store.

All of them were the Ascendants that were set to guard the Celestial Court. They went there as soon as they received the news.

Su Ping was Shen Huang’s disciple anyway; an announcement from his store was very likely trustworthy.

“Mr. Su, I’m here!”

A man broke into Su Ping’s store. It was none other than Milaluo, who had left his pets to train in Su Ping’s store. He had already moved to that planet, so he was the first to arrive.

“Sure.”

Su Ping saw him, then nodded.

“Boss Su, is there really an Ascendant pet available? Can I buy it? What’s the price that you want?” Milaluo asked in a hurry.
