Chapter 1428 Imparting (2)

The system said casually, “Normal Ancestral God pets wouldn’t do. It requires the Undying State with at least two opened Dao Gates. Don’t ask me what Dao Gates are; you’ll know when you reach the Undying State.”

Again, Su Ping felt helpless. The system’s request was indeed outrageous. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ancestral God pets… Very few people had one throughout history, right?

He could only heave a sigh. Fortunately, he had the young Chaos Beast, the Dark Dragon Hound and the others; all of them were in the Celestial State. They would become God emperors once they grasped their own Dao Hearts.

“They can become God Emperors immediately if I help them to grasp the three unparalleled Dao Hearts. However, I haven’t gathered enough energy to improve the store; it would be useless, even if they do advance. They can only increase my overall strength by a small margin, and that increase wouldn’t be worth mentioning when facing the Heavens.

“I’ll give them a chance to condense their own Dao Hearts in three to five years, which are three to five hundred years in the cultivation sites…” Su Ping mumbled.

He had grasped his own Dao Heart and was walking on a path of his own. He hoped that his battle pets could do the same.

He felt confident, and believed in their potential.

Even though all his pets had the humblest bloodlines except for the young Chaos Beast, their bloodlines had evolved and improved on their own after cultivating for such a long time. The limits of their bloodlines were broken time and time again; Su Ping believed that they would surpass their limits again in the future.

I’ll find time to give them the Dao Hearts. I wonder if it’ll cause a tribulation in this place… Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

He had promised them that he would give them Dao Hearts, hoping that their cultivation could advance. That way it would be safer for them to fly the ship while he was cultivating. After all, the low-tiered members of the Heavens were already God Emperors. They could probably avoid the weaker ones if they accidentally ran into them.

While resting in the store and fetching his pets, Su Ping sent a telepathic message to his master, asking him to accept a gift.

All the Celestials, including Shen Huang, were excited by the news: Su Ping was finally going to give them the Dao Hearts.

They weren’t confident of cultivating to higher levels on their own. Although Su Ping reminded them that the way was to find their Dao Hearts, it was easier said than done.

Danger could befall them at any moment; everybody wanted to be stronger.

They quickly gathered in Shen Huang’s palace.

“Guys, as informed, Xiao Su is planning to give us Dao Hearts, one at a time. For the sake of fairness, I’ve decided to draw lots,” said Shen Huang

Everybody’s eyes glittered. A Celestial expert smiled modestly and said, “Shen Huang, you’re too courteous. You should be the first to try.”

Shen Huang had the same idea, but Su Ping never mentioned anything and he, being Su Ping’s master, was too proud to ask. Besides, Su Ping had told him to find his own Dao Heart. He did want to tell his disciple that he was overestimating him, yet he struggled to hold back, all for dignity’s sake.

“Although Xiao Su is my disciple, his achievements are already greater than mine; now I must seek his advice on a lot of matters,” said Shen Huang as he looked at the others, “We’re the only embers left from our universe. We’ve weathered disasters by fighting together. I don’t think it’s necessary to divide us. I hope we can truly be united.”

Everybody was dazed. They fell silent, as they recalled the things that happened before they left the universe.

Indeed, they had gone through many dangerous situations. They did prepare fire seeds, but they had probably died out. Only refugees remained; if they were killed, humanity would disappear from the map.

“Shen Huang, I do admire you for what you said,” said one of the Celestials, conveying respect in his eyes. He had run into conflict with Shen Huang and Su Ping in the conference, he had completely let all of that go and felt embarrassed for his actions back then.

Maybe all the Celestials would have perished

– destroyed by the Heavens one by one without putting up any resistance-if Su Ping hadn’t united them.

“Prepare to draw lots.”

Shen Huang didn’t say anything else. He knew that Su Ping never stayed in the store for long, and wanted to avoid wasting the young man’s time.

“Here are eight divine weapons, including seven swords and a spear. I’ll project them to a disrupted timeline. Whoever finds the spear will go first,” said Shen Huang.

Everybody exchanged looks; none of them objected.

Shen Huang could have cheated. He could leave markers on the weapons to make them easier to find; however, he didn’t.

He could have simply told Su Ping that he wanted to be first. They believed that the latter would have accepted, considering their master-disciple relationship.

Su Ping was even willing to give the Dao Hearts away to the people who were at odds with him in the past, not to mention his

master.

Lots were drawn soon after.

Everyone was fully prepared. They took action right after Shen Huang threw the weapons. It wasn’t only luck; strength was also a determining factor.

Soon after, someone found a sword and, feeling frustrated.

Then, a joyful voice was heard. “Found it.”

The fortunate Celestial fetched the spear thrown into a chaotic time.

Shen Huang was also searching, but quickly lost the chance; he was both disappointed and relieved. The others could have thought he had cheated if he did find it first. It wasn’t a bad outcome. It was fair and square. His turn would eventually come anyway.

“Congratulations, Chi Ying. Xiao Su is waiting for you. Go now,” Shen Huang said.

Chi Huo snorted but didn’t show his dissatisfaction, seeing that his old rival had gotten the chance.

The times called for unity. If he jumped out and stir trouble again, it would be against Shen Huang’s will.

Behind Shen Huang’s wish was Su Ping’s thought.

“Okay!”

Sensing the eyes of admiration around him, Chi Ying flashed a smile and glanced at Chi Huo, only to discover that his old opponent wasn’t sneering like he did in the past. He was surprised. “Congratulations, go now,” said Chi Huo peacefully.

Chi Ying smiled and said, “I hope you’ll be lucky next time.”

“Whatever. It will be my turn sooner or later,” the other replied in a casual manner.

Chi Ying offered back a smile. He returned the spear to Shen Huang and left the palace.

The next moment, Chi Ying appeared outside of Su Ping’s store.

The place was already crowded, mostly by Ascendant cultivators. There were some Star Lords were waiting in line, but other Ascendants had paid them to switch places.

Their deals were voluntary and Su Ping had no time to care about that. He simply allowed

it.

All the Ascendants became solemn upon the Celestial’s arrival, and stopped whispering amongst themselves. It became quiet all of a sudden.

Chi Ying was in a great mood. He smiled at the people in line and said, “Behave and don’t disrespect Boss Su. Don’t cause trouble here, alright?”

Everybody nodded. They were speechless. Who would dare cause trouble?

Su Ping was already the well-known commander. The only Celestials left listened to his orders. It wouldn’t be outrageous to call him an autocratic emperor. That tiny pet store had become a holy land for all of humankind.

“Is there anything I can help you with?” asked Tang Ruyan who was at the door.

The guy was a Celestial State cultivator, but she had long grown accustomed and wasn’t nervous at all.

“I’m here to visit Boss Su.” Chi Ying didn’t underestimate that Star Lord girl. He was quite courteous. “Please report my visit.”

“Oh, I’ll go and ask.” Tang Ruyan turned around and entered the store. Before she could say a word, Su Ping-who was examining the customers’ pets—said to her, “Let him in.”

Su Ping was more or less relieved to see that his master wasn’t the first to show up.

Tang Ruyan went outside again and said, “Go inside.”

Chi Ying was greatly relieved. He thanked her and then sorted out his clothes, before he solemnly stepped into the store as if he were about to enter some sort of sacred palace.
