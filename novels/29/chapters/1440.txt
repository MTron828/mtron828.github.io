Chapter 1441 Forced Retreat (1)

Bang!

The joint attack of the five Ancestral Gods was again blocked by Su Ping again with his body and strength. Torn by countless Great Daos, Su Ping exploded after enduring for less than half a second.

But soon after, his body was reconstituted again.

He was very excited, as battling Ancestral Gods was actually useful. It would be unimaginable for other God Kings.

“Damn it!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Bastard! This will never be over!”

“We must seal him first!”

The five Ancestral Gods were so furious they almost vomited blood. Su Ping was like the Chaos Perception Dragon’s shield. Most importantly, the shield could fix itself and never be destroyed. The dragon only needed to attack, which imposed a huge pressure on them.

Roar!

The dragon’s attack became fiercer, after realizing that Su Ping truly wouldn’t die.

The five Ancestral Gods were trying to seal the human, but their power was dispelled by the dragon before it did any harm. It was really difficult to imprison Su Ping while that beast was there. Furthermore, the young man wasn’t weak. The power he could harness was enough to influence them somewhat.

“This isn’t going to work out.”

The five gods were having a headache as they carried on with the fierce battle. Their attacks had proven to be useless dozens of times because of the human’s resistance. Even though they did kill him a dozen times over, the Chaos Perception Dragon counterattacked paid in kind just as often. They were finding it difficult to defend themselves.

“Is there really something that can resurrect infinitely? Is he a Dao Ancestor? No way! A Dao Ancestor wouldn’t trick us like this. Damn it. What exactly is he?”

The five Ancestral Gods were exasperated, but there was nothing they could do.

Unification of the Great Dao…

Su Ping resurrected again and again. The consecutive bombardments helped him in sensing the elements behind the power that tore his body apart. The power belonged to the five gods, but it was highly unified. Such unification also contained the features of the infinite Great Dao. It seemed that each of those independent forces was part of a whole.

However, they were extremely complicated and unpredictable as they worked together.

Su Ping had a great epiphany during his movement between life and death.

Is this the Great Dao? Everything is the same at the end of the Great Dao…

That kind of experience couldn’t be copied by anyone. After all, they would be completely annihilated after the first experience.

Boom!

Su Ping stepped up again after facing the five Ancestral Gods’ attack.

All his power was easily torn apart soon after. An utterly violent power invaded his body, destroying all his cells and Astral Oceans.

Su Ping sensed that the violent Great Dao was tearing his body to pieces. He tried stopping it, but it was like an infant compared to a muscular man. He was crushed.

Maybe, if I can sign a contract…

The idea occurred to him. But his consciousness was invaded and destroyed before he could do anything.

The next moment, Su Ping woke up again.

His previous idea remained. Su Ping looked at the five gods with glittering eyes. They were definitely qualified as sparring partners.

Or rather, he was qualified to practice with the Ancestral Gods.

All in all, he was benefiting immensely as he learned from that battle.

It would have been pointless to practice with them in the past, as there would be no chance to learn a thing, being killed instantly.

It was different now.

Su Ping made a decision in his heart. I should give it a try later.

The five gods felt a strong headache as they looked at Su Ping.

“Have you noticed that he’s lasting longer each time?” said an Ancestral God in a gloomy

tone.

“Compared to before, he’s endured one second longer when we strike!” The charming Ancestral Goddess gnashed her teeth. “He seems to be using us to grow at a crazy rate!”

They all looked awful, and couldn’t be more shocked. Su Ping was actually growing at an astonishing speed as they fought. “His vitality aura is less than a thousand years old, and yet he has such terrifying strength. Is his growth being potentialized by his quick brushes between life and death?” asked the Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God.

“Very likely. This guy is too strange. My guess is that there’s a terrifying existence backing him, and is using us as mere targets for his training,” said one of the shocked gods with an awful expression. If that were the case, his backer could only be one kind of existence, the legendary Dao Ancestor!

The end of cultivation, and the original point of all power!

“This can’t go on. We should have brought one more Ancestral God had we known this.” The charming Ancestral Goddess’ pretty face was utterly solemn. She was thinking of retreating

The other Ancestral Gods silently exchanged looks.

The Rain Ancestor’s face was darker than ever. He had paid a great price to invite them over; such a turn of events was completely out of all expectations. What angered him to no end is that they might not win even if he asked them to keep on fighting. If they couldn’t deal with Su Ping, they would never inflict real damage to the Chaos Perception Dragon.

The only way for them to kill the ancient beast and Su Ping was if they were truly united and determined to accomplish the task, even at the cost of laying their own lives.

However… They were Ancestral Gods, with huge clans and descendants to protect. Who among them would truly risk their lives?
