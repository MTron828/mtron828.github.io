Su Ping sat in the front passenger seat of the taxi, letting the two girls sit in the back. Then, he told the driver to go to Phoenix Peak Academy.

By looking at the three and the direction they were headed, the driver guessed that they were all students of the Phoenix Peak Academy. They were easy to chat with and he got to learn more about battle pet warriors; being an ordinary person, he was even more curious about it. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Su Ping spoke less, fearing that it would affect the driver’s navigation.

Half an hour later, they arrived at the entrance of the academy. The streets in the area were already wide enough, and yet, they were filled with all sorts of famous cars. A few handsome young men and girls walked out of the cars. They were all students of Phoenix Peak Academy.

In order to get into this well-known Astral Pet school, one had to have good grades and a rich family background. At the very least, one had to be from a well-off family, since the tuition fees were more than ten times more expensive when compared to ordinary universities. Just the cost of buying pets and nurturing them was a weight that ordinary families could not afford.

The car stopped by the side. Su Ping pushed the door open and got out of the car. Lan Lele paid the fare behind him. Su Ping took a glance at the academy entrance, which was still rather imposing. He was satisfied and took the lead to enter.

Su Yanying and Lan Lele hurried to follow Su Ping. Su Yanying was surprised to see that Su Ping was familiar with the way. “You’ve been to our school?”

“No,” Su Ping replied without looking back.

Su Yanying was stunned. Why does it feel like you’re in your home when you’ve never been here before?

It had to be known that most people who had just arrived at Phoenix Peak Academy would be shocked by the massive sculpture of a phoenix at the entrance of the academy, spreading its wings and soaring. That lifelike statue had been created by a famous craftsman to depict the king of beasts, the ‘Purple-tailed Divine Phoenix’. It had the imposing aura of a Beast King.

Back when she had just entered Phoenix Peak Academy, she was just like the other freshmen. She had been stunned by the sculptured phoenix at the entrance for a long time. She got used to it after a long time passed. This was one of the famous sights of her school, and also the pride of the students.

“This guy...” Su Yanying mumbled and caught up with Su Ping.

The exhibition match would be held that day. Many of the students who entered the academy were accompanied by elegant and graceful figures. They were their parents, and some even brought their siblings.

“Hey, isn’t that Su Yanying?”

All of a sudden, a girl saw Su Yanying behind Su Ping and covered her mouth in shock. She was pleasantly surprised.

Hearing the words “Su Yanying,” the surrounding students immediately turned their heads over. When they saw Su Yanying’s face, exclamations were heard and the crowd quickly surrounded her.

Even in the past, Su Yanying was considered a famous person in the school. After all, she was one of the most beautiful students, and she was in the top ten of the girl’s battle power ranking. She had both beauty and strength. Which guy didn’t want to conquer her?

Or perhaps... be conquered by her?

Ever since the end of the annual competition, Su Yanying had relied on the Lightning Rat to pass the test and enter the finals. Her reputation had reached its peak. Even Ye Hao, who had won the championship, was not as popular as Su Yanying.

After all, coming in second wasn’t the main point. The main point was that she had won using the Lightning Rat.

The super Lightning Rat that could fight with a sixth-rank pet left a deep impression on everyone.

“Is that Su Yanying?”

“I heard she’s the first runner-up amongst the third-years.”

“She looks really good.”

In the distance, some of the parents who were attending the exhibition were jealous and envious of Su Yanying, who was surrounded by students. How glorious would it be if this happened to their children?

Lan Lele had already become a bodyguard. She stopped everyone who came to ask for autographs and questions about the reason for the Lightning Rat’s strength. She turned around and called out to Su Yanying, “You guys go ahead. Don’t bother about me. We’ll meet up at the same old place.” Her tone sounded like a warrior who was ready to die.

Su Ping grabbed Su Yanying’s hand and rushed into the academy as he saw the fanatical faces rushing toward him. He ran along a path of greenery. Behind him, a few boys were chasing after him, but they gave up after a short while. After all, it wouldn’t be nice to force things.

Su Ping stopped halfway and slapped his head. “Aren’t we here for publicity?”

Su Yanying said, “Yes.”

“Then why are we running?”

“Uh, yes?”

Su Yanying and Su Ping stared at each other. However, it was a little strange to turn around and go back.

Su Ping pondered for a moment. “Forget it. Let’s meet up with the second promoter first; I don’t care if you don’t want the trash at the door. You should know your college better, go find those rich ones first.”

Su Yanying was stunned for a moment. She felt sorry for Lan Lele in her heart. After all, she was the school belle and the daughter of a rich family. Now, Su Ping was treating her as a second promoter... Wait, if she was number two, then who was number one?

Su Yanying was startled. By the time she came back to her senses, Su Ping was already far away.

She opened her mouth, smiled bitterly, and chased after him.

Not long after, the three of them met up at a pavilion in a meadow. Phoenix Peak Academy was extremely large and it was covered in greenery—from meadows to woods. Not only were there resting pavilions, but there were also some fish ponds for viewing.

“Hey, isn’t that Han Xiangcheng and the rest?” Lan Lele suddenly saw a few people walking on a stone path.

Su Yanying’s eyes lit up. She said to Su Ping, “All of them are on the battle power rankings.”

“Battle power rankings?” Su Ping was surprised. “So they’re rich? Hurry, don’t let them go.”

Su Yanying blushed a little when she heard Su Ping’s urging. She had never taken the initiative to strike up a conversation with anyone. It was always others who took the first step. It was too embarrassing to pass out flyers at the academy.

Su Ping could tell that she was shy. He snapped, “Handing out flyers is also a job, okay? Are you looking down on this job?”

Su Yanying quickly replied, “No.”

“Then why aren’t you going?”

Su Yanying bit her lip. She had no choice but to brace herself and follow Lan Lele.

“Su Yanying?” The leader of the group, Han Xiangcheng, was a little surprised to see Su Yanying and Lan Lele jumping out of the room. Looking at their flushed faces, his heart skipped a beat. Could it be that... they have taken a fancy to my handsome self?

“Well, please take a look at this.” Su Yanying blushed and handed a flyer to Han Xiangcheng.

Han Xiangcheng was a little puzzled. He took the flyer and looked at it. He couldn’t help but be shocked. “What... what is this?”

“This is my Lightning Rat’s cultivation shop.” Su Yanying blushed. “My Lightning Rat was trained there. You can go there if you’re interested.”

“Ah?” Han Xiang Cheng was shocked, doubting his ears.

This is not how the story should unfold!

Wasn’t the beauty’s face red? Wasn’t it filled with love?

My heart was stirred, but you’re just showing me this?!

Su Yanying quickly passed each of them a flyer and said that they could visit if they liked it. Then, she turned around and ran away.

Seeing that she had settled everything before she could even speak, Lan Lele ran back with Su Yanying.

“Done.” Su Yanying panted as she ran. Her heart was pounding.

Su Ping saw that the other party had accepted the flyer from afar and was very satisfied. “Not bad, not bad. Let’s go find your rich classmates.”

Su Yanying and Lan Lele looked at each other. They knew that Su Ping’s cultivation service was not bad, but why did they feel like they were scamming their classmates?

The three of them wandered around the academy and soon found a new target. Su Yanying suddenly had an idea. She followed Lan Lele and returned shortly after. The thick flyers in their hands were gone.

Su Ping was surprised. “Where are the flyers?”

“They have them. They will hand them out for us.” Su Yanying giggled, her eyes filled with cunningness.

Su Ping was speechless.

They learned how to create downlines this fast?

“Then, did you tell them that they should prioritize the rich?” Su Ping asked.

“I did,” Su Yanying promised with all her might, but she didn’t dare to look Su Ping in the eye. She felt a bit guilty. Su Ping was expecting that as a matter of course, but how could she confess? Of course she didn’t.

However, she felt that even if she didn’t say it, as long as those flyers were distributed, Su Ping’s store would become more famous and the news would spread like wildfire. Everyone would know about it. They would have to line up to enter.

Su Ping took a glance at her and knew that she didn’t say anything. However, he couldn’t pursue the matter. As long as the promotion was done, dozens of people going to the store would be enough to keep him busy.

“Boss, let’s go watch the matches first. Although it’s not our turn yet, all the exhibition matches are very exciting. You have to see them.” Su Yanying immediately changed the topic.

Su Ping nodded. At this time, Su Lingyue’s exhibition match was about to begin.

“Are all the exhibition matches for the first to the third years at the same venue?” Su Ping asked.

“Of course.” Su Yanying grinned. “They’re all at the largest stadium.”

“Let’s go then,” Su Ping said.

With the two girls accompanying him, Su Ping walked towards the competition stadium.
