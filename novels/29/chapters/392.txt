Chapter 393 The Tang Family Arrives

In the meantime, outside the base city.

A dark cloud was moving fast.

The battle pet warriors who were standing on guard on the watchtowers used their telescopes to look into the cloud.

Surprisingly, it was a flock of birds!

All the birds were advanced beasts, eighth-rank Thunder Sparrows!

There had to be over a thousand of them, which could count as a beast uprising! Flying in front of the flock of Thunder Sparrows were three larger birds that had towering figures. The three were all at the ninth-rank but were of different families. The scariest of them all was a Dark Feather Phoenix!

A beast with a bloodline at the peak of the ninth-rank!

The wingspan of the Dark Feather Phoenix was over a hundred meters. This Dark Feather Phoenix had reached its prime state!

The soldiers guarding the base city were frightened.

It was horrifying!

A beast at the peak of the ninth-rank could severely maul a base city and Class A alarms would be sounded all across the city!

Besides, birds were the trickiest when it came to beast uprisings.

There were many aerial hot weapons, like sonic wave weapons. That being said, it was still hard for a base city to guard against air raids!

Soon, someone noticed that there were minuscule figures standing on top of the birds. Those tiny dots were solemn and magnificent, especially the three people that were standing on the backs of the three ninth-rank beasts. It was as if the three could withstand the sky falling over them.

Overlooking the earth. That had to be what those people were feeling!

The soldiers were ready to pull the alarms at any minute; they had immediately reported the information to their leaders.

With people standing on the beasts, a beast uprising was ruled out.

Thus far, no force would attack a base city randomly. That would be against the federal law and such attacks would be loathed by all base cities and the entire human society!

Soon, several people flew up from the rear area. Someone was riding on a bird with a wingspan of over a hundred meters as a display of their strength.

The soldiers threw their heads back and discussed as the titled battle pet warriors did the talking

The force of such a contingent was extraordinary.

Some of the well-informed soldiers had worked up some theory.

“This is the Longjiang Base City. And you are...?!

The titled battle pets guarding the Longjiang Base City were standing in front of the Dark Feather Phoenix. The titled battle pet warrior riding on the huge bird could tell that his bird was slowing down as it was approaching the Dark Feather Phoenix, which belied its fear. The titled battle pet warrior pulled a long face.

The Dark Feather Phoenix’s amber eyes were half the size of a human. There was an ominous glint in them as it stared at the titled battle pet warriors moving closer.

It was as if those people were mere insects to the phoenix.

The phoenix could eat them up in one bite!

The titled battle pet warriors could vividly sense that tension.

“We’re from the Tang Family and we come for our future family head. Stay back!”

An old man standing on the Dark Feather Phoenix hunched his back. However, he was like a king overlooking the world. His face wore no emotions and his voice was indifferent.

Behind him, heavy-armored warriors were standing on the one thousand Thunder Sparrows, creating a ruthless feeling. Their overwhelming energy almost suffocated the titled battle pet warriors.

Weak and vulnerable! The titled battle pet warriors suddenly felt small and insignificant.

The aura from the hunchbacked old man lingered above their heads like a piece of the dark cloud!

The Tang Family?

Why would they come here?!

The titled battle pet warriors were concerned. They had thought that those people were from the Star Organization. The recent events at the Elite League had provoked much discussion. They all knew that someone in the base city had offended the famous Star Organization.

But, it was the Tang Family, instead of the Star Organization, the ones who came!

The Tang Family had sent over so many people, which was an impressive display of their power and influence! They came to find their future family head?

Why would she be in Longjiang Base City?

One of the titled battle pet warriors worked up the courage to speak, “Ah, the Tang Family. I have heard so much about you. Is there any misunderstanding? We’d like to help in any way we can if you’re looking for your future family head.”

A toothless old lady standing on a ninth-rank Storm Eagle shouted all of a sudden, “Go away!”

Her shout made the air ripple and the shock waves were surging toward the titled battle pet warriors!

The titled battle pet warriors stepped back out of instinct.

In an instant, they were forced back dozens of meters!

The Dark Feather Phoenix took orders from the old man standing on its back. The phoenix cried, flapped its wings, and darted forth.

The titled battle pet warriors turned pale. They stepped aside, afraid to stand in their way. While they were making way, the three ninth-rank beasts flew over their heads, followed by the thousand Thunder Sparrows which carried the heavy-armored warriors.

The titled battle pet warriors looked sickly as the birds flapped their wings and chirped. The Tang Family was bossier than expected! “Hurry, gather everyone. We have to find out what their intentions are!” a titled battle pet warrior shouted.

Someone went to send the message at once.

The others calmed themselves down and went after the Tang Family. They would not follow them too closely, but they had to make sure that they could always have them on sight.

Still, the Tang Family’s army was great in strength and impetus. It would be hard to lose track of them with the one thousand Thunder Sparrows.

Inside the Pixie Pet Store.

The elders—as well as Venerable the Blade sitting next to him and Tang Ruyan who was standing behind him—were struck dumb with astonishment.

Venerable the Blade knew Su Ping well. But Su Ping was talking about his battle pet!

Venerable the Blade knew that if the mysterious girl with the golden hair in the store were to battle Xie Gange, the latter would lose within one second, not to mention last for three seconds! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, Su Ping was talking about his battle pet. The battle pets would always be influenced by their masters. After all, a battle pet was unlikely to be too far apart in strength in relation to its master. Otherwise, the battle pet could easily hurt the master’s spirit! Therefore, while Su Ping’s battle pets could be stronger than he was, that would be to a certain limit.

Defeating one at the peak of the titled rank? The pet would have to possess legendary rank powers!

If that would happen, it would imply that Su Ping had legendary rank abilities! Venerable the Blade stared at Su Ping in a daze. The former was speechless. He had the understanding that Su Ping was being supported by a legendary battle pet warrior, but that did not mean Su Ping was a legendary battle pet warrior.

Tang Ruyan stood aghast and open-mouthed. She wondered if Su Ping was losing his mind or whether he had become too arrogant after the local titled battle pet warriors had praised him to high heaven. He might not even know who he was dealing with. “Three seconds?”

It never occurred to Xie Gange that this was the second option Su Ping would propose.

He darted a glance at Venerable the Blade. If he and Venerable the Blade were to battle, it would be hours before they could determine which of them would be the winner. After all, both of them were at the peak of the titled rank and the gap in their strength was minimal. They would have to battle several rounds to learn more about each other’s moves.

Many a little makes a mickle. Only after they understood each others’ abilities completely could one side eventually win.

The battle pet would have to overpower Xie Gange by a large margin to defeat him within three seconds!

“Are you sure?”

A glint of coldness rose in Xie Gange’s eyes.

The ones that dared to provoke the Star Organization would either have to be exceptionally powerful or just wildly arrogant!

Clearly, the young man belonged to the second category. “This punk!”

“How audacious!”

The two titled battle pet warriors standing behind Xie Gange were quaking with rage. They could only clench their fists. If this weren’t a grave matter, they would have stepped in for Xie Gange’s sake, to show the young man that titled battle pet warriors were not to be insulted!

“You’re thinking about choosing the second option, right?”

Su Ping smiled but the coldness in his eyes grew.

Xie Gange squinted his eyes. “I do want to try that.”

The others present were eyeing Su Ping as if he were a lunatic. How crazy this was.

Su Ping said nothing. A swirl appeared, and the Little Skeleton stepped out.

The elders were scared by the skeleton.

Back at the Elite League, it was this strange skeleton that killed three titled battle pet warriors in a row!

Of course... Xie Gange said to himself. He had seen the videos and the most frightening thing about the young man was the skeleton.

The members of the Star Organization had concluded that the skeleton had titled rank abilities!

“Inside the store?”

Xie Gange took a deep breath. He was ready to summon his battle pets as well. He wasn’t sure whether he could make it for three seconds if he were all by himself.

Su Ping stood up. “Follow me.”

Then he walked to the test room.

Venerable the Blade was surprised to see that the battle pet Su Ping was going to use was the skeleton that he had been teaching.

Venerable the Blade was well aware that the skeleton was much more powerful than the other common skeletons. Still, there was no way that the skeleton would be able to defeat Xie Gange within three seconds!
