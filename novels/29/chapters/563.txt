Chapter 564 Triumph

After ten minutes, the battle had reached an end.

It seemed as if it never even began.

All the Wang family battle pet warriors who had prepared that ambush were turned into corpses sprawled across the blood-soaked mountain. The peak that had been in existence for hundreds and even thousands of years was broken!

The family was gone and the peak was destroyed!

The undead creatures retreated to that mysterious door.

The Little Skeleton, Tang Ruyan, and her beast king stayed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A titled old warrior crawled out from the ruins. He cursed Tang Ruyan viciously, “You and the Tang family... will die a miserable death!!”

Tang Ruyan was nonplussed by that curse. She lifted her finger.

Bang!

A streak of energy penetrated that old man’s skull.

She was at a stage where she could turn air into swords. Killing people of the same rank was a child’s play to her, not to mention that the titled battle pet warrior was seriously wounded at the time.

“We are fighting. You either shed tears or blood. “You should have been prepared for this when you attacked the Tang family. You’re destined to shed tears!” Tang Ruyan said. The many corpses and the blood didn’t soften her heart at all. She had been aware since young that the Wang family, the Tang family, the Yugong family and the Situ family had a complicated relationship.

It had always been like that between them.

The four families had constantly fought each other for generations.

No one was innocent in such battles.

Even a kid of the rivaling families would learn to use a blade to hurt the Tang family.

“Let’s go.”

Tang Ruyan didn’t linger. She flew back to her beast king.

The Little Skeleton took the seat next to Tang Ruyan.

The beast king didn’t welcome the bony pet but it didn’t show resistance. The demonic sense of the Little Skeleton was enough to even scare the beast king.

Tang Ruyan ordered the beast king to go ahead and run in another direction.

She was heading to the Situ family territory.

She didn’t want to leave any more time for them to prepare. She also wanted to hurry everything up so that she could go back as early as possible.

In the distance, some onlookers were quite relieved to find that Tang Ruyan had left with her beast king. They had been quite worried, thinking that she would wipe out the base city in a fit of rage. The Wufeng Base City would cease to exist if it were the case, because no one would be able to stop her.

“The Wang family... is over.”

“They used all the treasures they had and they lasted for less than 10 minutes...”

“Since no legendary battle pet warriors came to stop this mess, I think that the most powerful family of the Subcontinent District will be the Tang family from now on.”

The onlookers were in an uproar.

The Wang family had operated in the Wufeng Base City for hundreds of years, controlling the truth and flow of information, and yet they were no more.

The skyscrapers that had been in existence for hundreds of years collapsed in less than 10 minutes!

The mountain was also broken as well. There was no coming back for that mountain.

The Tang family, of course, would not leave any chance of recovery for the Wang family. There were some remaining members scattered outside, lingering on in a steadily worsening condition outside. The Tangs would gradually hunt them down.

That was how the fight between the big families would be!

The outcome for those defeated would be their annihilation!

The guards didn’t stop Tang Ruyan when she crossed the city wall as she left.

The Wufeng Base City’s rank would be lowered to a Class B base city after the disappearance of the Wang family.

The fact that the Wang family was gone was soon learned by all forces. Even the Holy Light Base City—a seemingly unrelated city of trainers-had learned about this appalling news.

Some of the Wang family battle pet warriors had once entrusted their pets to trainers in the Holy Light Base City; those pets had forever lost their masters. More breaking news arrived before people could have digested that piece of information. The Situ family was also gone!

Merely two hours had passed in between!

The two families—which both had once had legendary battle pet warriors-had fallen one after the other!

All the forces of the Subcontinent District had a feeling that things were about to change and the change would be a scary one. There wasn’t even a hint of what was going to happen.

The Star Organization.

“That girl from the Tang family destroyed the Wang family and the Situ family.” “One girl and both families are gone. It’s barbaric!”

“Have you seen the video? I believe that girl is young.”

“And that skeleton...”

Nine titled battle pet warriors of the Star Organization were gathered in a conference room. Each one of them was a cornerstone of the Star Organization.

Xie Gange, one of the nine, was stunned still when he saw the video.

He would never... forget about that skeleton.

It’s that man’s skeleton!

Well, the color of the skeleton changed but the size and the cruelty were still the same!

Is that guy behind all this?

Xie Gange remembered having met that girl in Su Ping’s store as well seen how people from the Tang family were trying to take her back.

However, they had been unable to get the girl back. As a matter of fact, the Tang family had lost their armies and they ended up apologizing to Su Ping.

Unexpectedly, Su Ping had been behind that strike!

As far as Xie Gange was concerned, that skeleton represented Su Ping. He believed that the Tang family was most likely in Su Ping’s control. Once the Tangs grabbed the Situ family and the Wang family’s assets, Su Ping would be in control of the most powerful forces of the Subcontinent District!

Not even the Star Organization would be able to compete against him!

He would forever be No.1 if no legendary battle pet warriors came to stop him!

Su Ping was in charge of such a formidable force!

Xie Gange was full of mixed feelings.

The Tang family.

Tang Linzhan was organizing people to clean up the mess in their family compound.

All battle the pet warriors of the Situs and the Wangs had either perished or escaped. At the moment, the only people standing there were members of the Tang family, as well as some captives.

The Tang family compound, formerly famed for its landscapes, was at the moment in ruins and drenched in blood.

While Tang Linzhan was busy at work, he heard about the death of the Wang family.

Tang Linzhan took a minute to process that information. Tang Ruyan had reached the Wang family faster than expected and had actually destroyed them!

Tang Linzhan remembered how indifferent Tang Ruyan was when she left them. He was lost in complicated emotions. Soon, he was informed of the destruction of the Situ family!

While Tang Linzhan kind of expected that, he was still shocked when he heard it.

Both the Wang family and the Situ family were gone. The Tang family would be the ruler from then on!

Tang Linzhan immediately shared the information with the Tang family. People were still grieving after that tragic battle, but they were stunned speechless when they heard the news.

Some titled battle pet warriors gradually convinced themselves about the validity of such astounding news as they recalled Tang Ruyan’s performance.

She was beyond comprehension.

People went back to work. A beast was running in the wild, leaving the Wang family and the Situ family in ruins.

Standing on the shoulder of the behemoth was a girl whose hair was dancing in the wind. It was Tang Ruyan.
