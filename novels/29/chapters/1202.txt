Chapter 1203: Fierce Battle

“Senior brother, let’s go!”

Su Ping didn’t give them time to think, simply charging forth with the brilliant sword in his hand. He had an estimation of the Heavenly Lord’s combat ability after observing the contest, so his actions weren’t reckless.

Besides, he would have been forced to take action anyway, even without intel.

He couldn’t let a senior he didn’t even know die just so he could escape!

Whoosh!

Su Ping charged ruthlessly.

His sword aura was so dark it was about to swallow everything. Both Dark Fire King and the one manning the other giant realized what was going on and felt amused; they had sensed that Su Ping was an authentic Star Lord.

Besides, they had been briefed about the brat’s life as a cultivator, who wasn’t even a hundred years of age.

How could he possibly reach the Ascendant State?

Even if he miraculously reached that level, how could he compare to a Heavenly Lord?

“You could have lived a while longer if you had remained hidden. However, since you’re asking to be killed…” Blue and black flames surged all over Dark Fire King’s body. The giant’s severed arms were quickly healed, even though they were much less powerful than before, without the Ascendants powering them.

Nevertheless, the giant was still as strong as a normal Heavenly Lord!

The giant made a pushing motion with both arms and a wave of flames was swept out, quickly surrounding Su Ping; it looked almost as if he would have thrown himself into the fire.

The Fire God Domain!

“Divine Realm of Flames, freeze!” Dark Fire King simply activated his world. Since the target had revealed himself, he decided to end things as quickly as possible.

Besides, he was a bit uneasy after Su Ping unexpectedly severed the giant’s arms.

The giant charged and slashed at Su Ping with countless blades made of laws as the world unfolded and flames burned.

Boom!!

An explosive collision burst out. Everyone was shocked to find that the giant controlled by the Dark Fire King was flung back by the force.

Another figure was also flung back. It was none other than Su Ping.

However, he quickly stabilized himself after flying for several hundred meters, and then charged back even faster, like a swallow returning to its nest. The closer he was to the Dark Fire King, the bigger the flames on his body grew. They weren’t real flames, but special fire laws!

Fire could burn everything in the world, except for the things that also contained divine power!

Dark Fire King was completely shocked by Su Ping.

The burning flames couldn’t hurt Su Ping in the slightest. Rather, they seemed to have become his background, making him more formidable!

“I’ll show you what real divine fire is like!”

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. All of a sudden—a long shriek sounded behind his back. The entire void seemed to have been immediately torn apart; the shriek was loud and clear, carrying an everlasting pride.

The sound of a mythical creature that hadn’t been heard for eons was resounding in the world once again!

Roar!!

Su Ping roared furiously, then slashed at the giant with overwhelming flames covering his body.

The dazzling sword aura contained an unprecedented power. The use of God’s Arrival nearly exhausted Su Ping’s reserves!

The power surged like a nuclear explosion, causing so much damage that even the void was twisted!

Dark Fire King was so shocked he couldn’t help but roar, “This is impossible!”

The other Ascendants inside the giant narrowed their eyes in shock.

They quickly unleashed their worlds and overlapped them, making illusions of multiple worlds appear behind the giant’s back.

Bang!

The sword aura swept over and tore the worlds to pieces. The Golden Crow shrieked and covered Su Ping’s body; the sword in his hand turned into one of the Golden Crow’s claws and dazzled brilliantly. He moved back at blinding speed.

The next second—the arms defending the giant’s chest exploded yet again, and a hole appeared where the Dark Fire King was. The latter was pale and shivering, which was a sign of exhaustion after resisting the attack.

He had felt a brush of death a moment earlier!

He has an Ascendant State body! A top Ascendant State body!

What kind of monster is this??Dark Fire King exclaimed frantically in his heart, as if he would have run into a ghost.

The man finally understood why their Celestial boss had requested for the two of them to block a mere Star Lord!

Their leader had already recognized the brat’s terrifying potential!

Such attainment was inconceivable for a Star Lord.?He hasn’t even cultivated for more than a hundred years, right?

Once he reaches the Ascendant State, won’t he be able to crush all the Heavenly Lords and become the strongest below the Celestial State?

Fang Shiliu—who was getting ready to protect Su Ping—was also astounded to see that Dark Fire King had actually been wounded; he could not believe his eyes. Su Ping, the one he had been protecting, had the power to wound the Dark Fire King in his prime condition?

An Ascendant State body?

Was it also because of a generous gift from their master?

Fang Shiliu even felt a little bit jealous. But he also knew it was impossible to acquire an Ascendant body with gifts; strict requirements would have to be met.

He could only conclude that his junior brother was talented beyond anyone’s imagination!

No wonder my master asked me to take him away. Given enough time, he will amaze the entire universe when he reaches the Ascendant State; he’ll crush all the Ascendant cultivators!?Fang Shiliu thought.

Such thoughts passed quickly in his mind. He noticed that the other giant appeared behind Su Ping’s back; his expression changed as he roared.

The dragon closest to Su Ping instantly responded with a roar of its own and moved to block the attack for him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The dazzling golden blade carried a terrifying killing aura, which was about to destroy Su Ping completely!

The nine Ascendants powering the giant felt cold when they realized how threatening Su Ping was. They were determined to slay him!

Su Ping heard the roaring and sensed the incoming giant. Given the influence of all the negative laws, his own laws weren’t enhancing him as significantly as before.

Su Ping suddenly roared, “Battle constitution!”

The power used to unleash God’s Arrival had been replenished by power he was borrowing from another space and time; he was back in peak status.

As long as he wasn’t killed instantly, he could endure a war of attrition for ten thousand years.

Woo!

The invincible Golden Crow emerged, attracting the attention of many bird pets owned by those Ascendant foes.

The battle aura manifested had alarmed many other Ascendants fighting fiercely in other places.

The proud Golden Crow melted with Su Ping the next moment, unleashing a resplendent golden light. His body changed into the ancient and pure divine body!

The purity of his body had completely activated Su Ping’s Golden Crow bloodline, who then transformed into a growing Golden Crow!

Bang!

Hardly had he transformed into the Golden Crow when the blade struck him. Fang Shiliu’s dragon had little time to react and was unable to stop it. The blade wounded Su Ping’s back.

The blade was originally aimed for the head but missed the target. He had nimbly changed his posture once he turned into a Golden Crow.

One of his golden wings was cut off; dazzling blood gushed out.

The wounded bird seemed about to die. The scene was striking, extremely eye-catching.

The next moment, many of the phoenix-type pets present felt grieved and angry.

Su Ping fell straight down, as if struck dead after his wing was severed. The severed wing grew back halfway on his descent though, and became brilliant again!

He quickly stabilized himself and turned around, then stretched his wings and unleashed scorching flames to the entire void with himself as the center.

Everyone thought they were in the presence of the sovereign of fire and the king of birds combined!

“Caw!”

Su Ping shrieked and swooped at the giant. He became ten times stronger after transforming into a pure divine body!

He was at the moment as immaculate as golden glass; each of his feathers released enough heat to melt the world!

The nine Ascendants inside the giant wore awful expressions as they saw Su Ping’s dominating presence. They were shocked, speechless, and somewhat scared.

That Star Lord was such a shocking eye-opener they didn’t know what to say.

While doing swooping maneuvers, Su Ping realized his shortcomings.?It’s a shame that I can’t activate the soul entity and the ancient deity constitution at the same time. I can only use one constitution at a time. I can’t make them compatible yet…

It wasn’t until that urgent moment that he finally figured out how he should continue cultivating.

One goal was to establish new small worlds; another thing he had to work on was to balance out the power of the many constitutions inside him—

Otherwise, he would only be able to use one of them at a time. The rest would seem a waste.

“Die!”

Su Ping was again fighting fiercely against the giant.

Dark Fire King had already caught his breath. Shocked and infuriated, he charged at Su Ping from another side.

“I’m your opponent!” Fang Shiliu dashed over and blocked the heavily wounded Dark Fire King; he summoned his pets and kept the latter occupied.

By then he had realized that Su Ping could hold his own against the giant!

The guy was almost as strong as him, if not stronger!

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The fierce battle made the void shake. Many Ascendants who were on the run noticed the battle, and so did the other giants.

All the giants soon moved towards Su Ping and Fang Shiliu.

Back in the formation controlled by Song Yuan—many senior brothers and sisters were working together to block the surrounding giants. Some of them heard the roars and saw Su Ping’s battle. “That’s… Junior Brother Su!”

“Master mentioned that Junior Brother Su carries the ancient Golden Crow bloodline!”

“That Golden Crow is our junior brother?”

“Seriously? He’s fighting the giant on even terms?”

All the dozens of senior brothers and sisters were shocked, their eyeballs almost popping out. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing. It was crazy!

“Hurry up! Let’s go there!”

Song Yuan noticed the situation and immediately remembered how Fang Shiliu was summoned by their master, who had probably tasked him with taking Su Ping away in secret.

Furthermore, it was highly unusual for two giants controlled by Heavenly Lords to be there; it seemed that they considered Su Ping as the most important target!

Su Ping’s performance had also made him realize that there was a reason why Old Monster Ye was so wary of Su Ping.

All the senior brothers and sisters inside the formation mobilized their magnificent golden giant in Su Ping’s direction with the help of other Ascendants.

The giants attacking them had also noticed the distant battle and were astonished. However, they didn’t receive any new orders; their mission was to destroy Song Yuan and his team. They began to attack even more fiercely upon seeing their intentions to reinforce others.

Bang!

Su Ping’s sharp claw was filled with a strong aura as he continued slashing with the Sky Execution Technique, which almost became perfect as he wielded more and more power.

It’s indeed as strong as a top Heavenly Lord. The pressure of its world is also imposing. Unfortunately, it’s still flawed, compared to that of a real top Heavenly Lord; it’s not agile enough. However, it carries much more strength; those flaws are unimportant in a head-on clash.

Su Ping fought the giant fiercely; neither had the upper hand.

Su Ping became increasingly familiar with his sword technique as he fought, and his attacks gradually became more powerful. He fused the path of ultimate darkness he just comprehended and the immortal Golden Crow flames into his sword auras, which would never die out once they struck the giant. The giant would have to give up that portion of energy and replace it.

While Su Ping was fighting fiercely—he suddenly heard Senior Brother Fang’s exclamation, “Junior brother, careful!”

He quickly turned around and dodged, but he was still slapped by a terrifying whip. His golden wings almost fell apart; chain-shaped wounds of a dark red color remained.

Su Ping instantly sensed that an invisible force was pulling his body by the wings.

“Hurry!” roared another giant who had attacked him, holding Su Ping with the chain.

Those manning the original giant fighting against Su Ping realized what was going on. The giant was instantly shrouded in flames; the nine Ascendants unleashed all the power of their worlds.

A brilliant saber was suddenly condensed in the void, which gave off a breathtaking aura.

Such a weapon made the top Heavenly Lords change their expressions, feeling as if they were about to be destroyed.

Su Ping’s face also changed as he flapped his wings. However, the binding force seemed to have pinned him to the bone. He even attempted to cut off his wings, but the force remained.

Mutated soul power!?He instantly realized what was going on. With cold eyes, he quickly turned into a soul entity.

He immediately transformed from a brilliant Golden Crow to a dark one. The shape remained, but he was now releasing an infinite aura of the undead!

If he was a divine bird totem moments before, he was now a bringer of disaster and destruction!

Bang!

The mutated soul power was then made visible over the Golden Crow’s wings; it looked like bloody intestines. Su Ping swung abruptly and tore it apart.
