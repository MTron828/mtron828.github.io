Chapter 1549: Protracted Battle

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Come and fight me!”

Killing intent surged from Su Ping’s eyes. He said, “You’re the dragons’ ancestor and carry the Chaos Qualification. Let’s find out whether or not you deserve to be called the strongest dragon in all of existence!”

“As you wish!”

Yuan Long instantly turned around and charged, simply unleashing an overpowering aura. His enormous claws tore the void open and instantly reached the spot where Su Ping was.

The latter didn’t dodge; he instantly drew his sword. All his blood was burning. The illusion of the Golden Crow was vaguely manifesting in his back. He sacrificed his Golden Crow bloodline for more power.

“Three thousand universes, slash!!”

The thousands of universes behind Su Ping’s back exploded instantly, transforming into a terrifying power that was unleashed by his sword.

After a massive bang!

Yuan Long’s sharp claws—enhanced by the power of hundreds of universes—managed to block Su Ping’s attack. The edge of the sword produced dazzling sparks as it made contact with the scales.

Infuriated, Yuan Long roared. His aura turned into a concrete golden blast that pressed down on his enemy.

Su Ping’s hair was dangling under the pressure. All his muscles were trembling. He found it hard to endure the pressure, as if bearing the weight of millions of planets.

However, his three thousand universes recovered in a moment. He detonated them again, letting the violent power surge to slash furiously once again.

The golden dragon aura was torn apart after the opening was made, which was like the puncture of a sharp needle in a golden ocean.

Bang!

A stream of power surged from within and struck back, sending Su Ping flying.

The latter jumped. Dozens of universes exploded in his palm, then he swung a fist.

The fist tore the dragon aura to pieces and struck Yuan Long in the head.

Yuan Long burst into fury. Su Ping was just an ant in his eyes; however, the lad would somehow survive again and again.

The massive beast rotated and golden light was suddenly gathered in the void into, which then turned into Undying State-level Original Dragons. There were at least ten thousand of them!

Su Ping slightly changed his expression. They weren’t real Original Dragons, but mere condensations produced with his universes.

“Dragon Enchantment!” Yuan Long roared. The ten thousand Undying State dragons also roared. Their bellowing was condensed into an ancient array, but that was more of an aggressive force field than an array. Normal lives would be obliterated once entering, even if they were in the Undying State.

Su Ping could sense that his flesh was being torn apart. Even the power of contract in his body was falling apart.

He gritted his teeth with bloodshot eyes, then detonated the three thousand universes and charged in one direction.

Whoosh!

He instantly approached the edge like a Golden Crow, instantly cutting apart dozens of Undying State Original Dragons as he slashed on furiously, creating an opening on the array for him to escape.

Hardly had he escaped the lethal array when a sharp claw descended from the sky and pressed Su Ping heavily, pushing him away.

He felt as if hit by a rushing universe, and found it impossible to control himself. Many things on his path broke, and then he was swallowed by excruciating pain.

Su Ping turned around and then saw Yuan Long’s sharp claw pushing him all the way to the depths of the Ancestral Land of Chaos.

He wanted to resist it and stabilize himself. However, his opponent had infinite strength and he couldn’t stop himself.

It felt like being pushed a light year away. He only stopped until something fiercely struck his chest, which made him vomit a mouthful of blood. He felt that something tough was on his chest.

He instantly noticed that it was an extremely thick and solid plate; made of rock, except it was unbelievably hard.

Phew!

Yuan Long’s sharp claw kept on suppressing him, then the great dragon spurted a mouthful of flames all of a sudden. Su Ping was incapable of breaking free, as the claws contained infinite Dao power that restrained all his transformation methods. If not for this, he would have turned into particles to gather once again later.

There were a lot of flame-based Great Daos. Rotting, burning, imprisonment, sealing, destruction, and so on. The traits of thousands of overlapping Great Daos were able to destroy any Undying State expert; even their souls would be gone. They would be completely annihilated from time and from memory.

However, golden ripples appeared and surrounded Su Ping.

Those ripples kept spreading—

They somehow blocked the flames.

Those ripples were in fact the power of exploding universes.

Su Ping was detonating the three thousand universes, one by one. Each second, dozens of universes were exploding and regenerating in cycles. The result was their power to flow nonstop like ripples, blocking the dragon flames.

The dragon flames contained too many Great Daos; they seemed to be sweeping as a whole, but they actually consisted of many frequencies. In simpler terms, it wasn’t a simple, fierce attack, but one of a continuous nature.

The ripples made by Su Ping’s exploding universes happened to suppress the ongoing attacks. He seemed to be affected by the flames, but the golden ripples protected him like water; he wasn’t hurt in the slightest.

“Asshole!”

Yuan Long was infuriated. He was almost using his full strength, and Su Ping was still alive?

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. Although suppressed by the claws and incapable of breaking free, he hoped that this would continue, all to buy himself more time.

However… He wasn’t sure if the other species would be able to take care of the Heavenly Dao forces without his command.

Su Ping’s heart was heavy, but the only thing he could do was hold Yuan Long back. It was impossible for him to kill it as he was.

The Dark Dragon Hound’s voice sounded in Su Ping’s head, “Boss, if the guy is condensing thousands of Great Daos to attack simultaneously, I have another method!”

That golden ripple defensive technique was developed by the former. The pet had been informed of the war in advance, so the fellow designed the technique based on Su Ping’s condition, spending thousands of years perfecting it.

“Okay,” Su Ping responded in his heart.

Yuan Long stopped his flame attacks at the moment, then suddenly opened its mouth to manifest a vortex that looked like a black hole, which darted towards Su Ping.

The latter’s expression changed, as he could feel the infinite destructive power of that move. The golden ripples covering his body instantly turned into a golden cloak!

The garment was as soft as the fabric of a dress, seemingly gentle and soft, but using the power of three thousand universes.

The cloak floated to meet the enormous black vortex.

The latter was like a basketball scoring, except it was caught in the net. The cloak didn’t rip open; it wrapped and blocked the black vortex.

However, the terrifying momentum of the black vortex struck Su Ping in the back, along with the golden cloak. He felt that his spine was broken, as if a planet made of lead had smashed into him. Such momentum could have killed lots of people in the Undying State.

Su Ping gritted his teeth after his back blocked the vortex’s momentum, then summoned his strength, transforming the golden cloak into a giant hand that grabbed the black phenomenon and threw it back at Yuan Long..

Yuan Long slightly changed his expression, as he was shocked and infuriated. Su Ping’s defense was too powerful; those two attacks should have been enough to kill him, yet he survived both of them.

Whoosh!

He moved his head a bit to dodge the black vortex. He kept pressing Su Ping down while saying, “Did Mother teach you all this?”

“Did your mother teach you all this?” Su Ping sneered and said, “Oh, a bastard like you probably doesn’t have a mother. Not even animals would betray their mothers!”

“You’re asking to be killed!”

Exasperated, Yuan Long suddenly clenched Su Ping and picked him up from the particularly hard rock. He rose higher and said, “I will rip you apart in front of those ants and show them your humble face!”

Su Ping’s expression changed, quickly turning around to slash with his sword. However, his sharp weapon only left shallow marks on the scales, unable to cut them apart.
