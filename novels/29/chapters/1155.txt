Chapter 1156: Entrance

“Damn it!”

Tang Jingyu, who had fallen off the arena, was already back on his feet thanks to the support of other disciples. His expression was unsightly after hearing what He Buyu and the others said; he didn’t expect that he would lose, bringing humiliation to his school for it.

He clenched his fists as he looked at the Fang-surnamed young man in the arena.

“Why? Are there no disciples capable of fighting on the Light Snow Mountain?” asked the Fang-surnamed fellow with a casual tone, still in the arena.

All the Light Snow Mountain disciples were furiously glaring at him, clearly provoked.

Even the senior disciples were more or less enraged because the guy had purposefully left out the “new” term from his claim, seemingly stressing out that disciples of all generations were no good!

A woman roared and stepped up. “This is outrageous. Senior brother, allow me!”

She was a new disciple with deity constitution. She was outraged; there was nothing but coldness on her pretty face.

Zhuang Bizhe’s face was cold too, silently hearing what his junior sister said.

He knew that the others would only be crushed if Tang Jingyu lost.

But…

“Senior brother, let me!”

Another young man stepped up. Without a deity constitution, he was but one of the new disciples with regular physiques who had built a foundation. He said solemnly, “Let me try him out; even if we lose, we must go all out and fight the good fight!”

“That’s right! Count me in! This is humiliating!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The other disciples were indignant too.

Zhuang Bizhe heaved a sigh, then glanced at the young man. He nodded and said, “You may go. Just be careful.”

The young man nodded and leaped into the deep ravine. Moments later, he jumped back to the arena and said coldly, “I don’t have a deity constitution, but we’re going to duke it out today!”

“Be my guest,” said the Fang-surnamed young man indifferently.

The young man roared and dashed forward, showing remarkable strength and expertise; but very soon—he was punched away the moment he approached the Fang-surnamed young man.

The young man was pushed back to the edge of the arena. He gritted his teeth and charged again; alas, he was then knocked out of the arena without being able to see how his opponent had done it.

“Anyone else?” The aloof young man looked down at the other disciples, hands behind his back.

“Let me!”

The woman who had roared earlier leaped onto the arena without waiting for Zhuang Bizhe’s approval. Her face was cold, but she seemed rather short-tempered. She charged straight at the Fang-surnamed young man the moment she got on stage.

“Just a worthless woman. Humph!” Disdain flashed across the young man’s eyes. He dodged her attack with ease, then punched three times at the same time with two clones.

The woman dodged two punches at first, to then be hit by the last one; she coughed blood and was blown back.

“If you’re all as weak as them, I don’t think it’s necessary to continue,” remarked the ever casual Fang-surnamed young man.

Zhuang Bizhe coldly narrowed his eyes. “Junior brother, you’re a new disciple. It’s understandable that you’re still young and proud. However, I suggest you keep your head down once in a while, or it might hit something and break!”

The Fang-surnamed young man slightly changed his expression and looked at him, not daring to reply.

His heart shook due to Zhuang Bizhe’s pressure; his heart was quaking and he couldn’t resist, at all.

“Senior Brother Zhuang, is it really appropriate to be so mean to a junior brother?” Coldness glittered in He Buyu’s eyes.

Zhuang Bizhe said indifferently, “Being his senior brother, I’m only teaching my junior how the world runs.”

“The Moon Watching Mountain will teach him that. Senior Brother Zhuang, might as well spend the time teaching your own junior brothers and sisters on the Light Snow Mountain. This practice is boring if none of them is capable of fighting,” said He Buyu.

Zhuang Bizhe was rather grave.

The other people with deity constitutions were infuriated; they had never been humiliated like that since they entered the school.

“Alas.”

Su Ping heaved a sigh and said, “Let me.”

He walked forward as he talked, and pointed at the tip of his foot; he then landed on the arena, as softly as a cloud.

“Huh?”

Zhuang Bizhe narrowed his eyes upon seeing the newcomer; although Su Ping didn’t leap from the deep ravine, he had still shown remarkable expertise by moving to the stage.

“Did this junior brother make a mistake? You have to go down there before you go up the stage!”

“Is he incapable of jumping up from down below?”

“He hasn’t even built a foundation yet? Why be bold enough to go there? Senior Brother Fang will surely crush him!”

All the new disciples of the Moon Watching Mountain mocked him.

All the senior disciples along with He Buyu were silent, as they recognized Su Ping’s expertise when he made his entrance.

“Interesting.”

Up on the stage—the Fang-surnamed young man raised his eyebrows, unbothered by Su Ping not jumping up from the deep ravine. He said casually, “I hope you’re not as disappointing as them…”

“Well…”

Su Ping interrupted him and looked around, “Why don’t you all come together? Otherwise, it would seem that I’m being awfully mean to you.”

What?

Everybody fell silent; even the falling of a needle would be heard.

Everybody’s eyes widened. Not just the disciples of the Moon Watching Mountain were shocked; the visitors from Light Snow Mountain were similarly affected.

All of them wondered if their ears had deceived them.

Together?

Are you trying to get killed?

After a few seconds of silence—angry exclamations burst out from the disciples of Moon Watching Mountain.

“Who’s this guy? Damn it!”

“So pretentious. He probably can’t even jump to the arena, yet he’s pretending to be a badass!”

“Where’s this idiot from? Didn’t he see Senior Brother Fang’s performance? Or maybe he simply didn’t understand what he saw?”

“Senior Brother Fang, just beat him up!”

All the Moon Watching Mountain’s disciples were infuriated by Su Ping.

The ones from Light Snow Mountain were also about to complain, but the angry uproar delighted them. Whether Su Ping could win or not, it was exhilarating to see their opponents angry.

“This guy…” Tang Jingyu couldn’t help but shake his head. Even though he was also enjoying the situation, a verbal victory didn’t mean anything; he didn’t think Su Ping could exceed him, or beat his junior on stage.

“You’re asking to be killed, idiot!” Ma Bo cursed angrily. He was still holding a grudge because of the previous slap.

“Don’t you know that anything you say will make your failure even more humiliating afterward?”

The Fang-surnamed young man coldly stared at Su Ping and gradually approached him; he intended to beat him in a thunderous manner and teach him the price of bragging.

“I’m not bragging; I’m telling the truth,” said Su Ping.

He glanced at Mu Xuefeng outside the arena; he only chose to join the competition until he saw the anger in her eyes. Otherwise, he would have felt ashamed to beat those kids.

“Why don’t you come here too?” Su Ping asked He Buyu.

The latter was astounded, and so were the other disciples mocking him; none of them knew how to respond.

Has the guy truly gone crazy?

The disciples of Light Snow Mountain also fell silent. They looked at each other in bewilderment, thinking that Su Ping was unimaginably wild.

“Junior brother, do you have any idea what you’re talking about?” said He Buyu, narrowing his eyes. Whether or not Su Ping was a retard, he wouldn’t stand for such an insult.

“I do. You won’t regret it when I beat the whole lot of you,” said Su Ping.

Veins protruded on He Buyu’s forehead. He ignored Su Ping and said to his fellow junior on stage. “Send him off the arena!”

The latter nodded. He was already ten meters from Su Ping; he sprinted forward as quickly as lightning, crossing the remaining distance in only half a second. He launched a storm of fists towards Su Ping, showing an even greater strength, speed, and brutality!

But the next moment—he was flung back even faster when he was three meters away from Su Ping.

Bang!

He flew out of the arena, and fell to the bottom.

The scene was so surprising that it went beyond anyone’s expectations, the thought sinking in until the young man hit the ground, so nobody reacted in time to catch him.

All the Light Snow Mountain’s disciples were dumbfounded; they were staring at Su Ping with strange expressions.
