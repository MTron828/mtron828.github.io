Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“You’ve just become an Ancestral God, and you’re already acting this arrogant. Did Wen Tian not teach you the rules?” Ancestor Han’s face turned cold.

“Let me ask you again. What are your plans?” Su Ping stared at him.

Ancestor Han’s face turned gloomy. “This matter involves all clans; you don’t get to decide. Don’t forget your identity… Do you think the Heaven Path Institute can decide everything for the gods because you have four Ancestor Gods now?”

There was a swooshing sound, and a figure appeared out of nowhere.

Ancestral God Wen Tian had just arrived, and Elder Yan Qing who went to inform him.

“Ancestor Han, sorry. Ancestor Su just became an Ancestral God and is a little bit reckless. He only lost his composure because he was concerned about the safety of all gods. I hope you can forgive him,” said Wen Tian in a hurry.

Ancestor Han was even colder upon seeing the latter arrive. “You’d better teach him well, since he’s related to the Heaven Path Institute. I can forget what happened today if he apologizes and the institute gives away ten spots for the Mysterious Realm. Don’t let this happen again!”

Wen Tian slightly changed his expression. However, he curbed his anger and managed to give the other a smile. “Ancestor Su was indeed a bit reckless, but he did so considering the welfare of all gods. The Heavens are indeed a problem; you should really think about it.”

“How dare you!” Ancestor Han bellowed, “Since when is the Heaven Path Institute qualified to decide on big matters? Do you honestly think you’re above all other clans because you have four Ancestral Gods? All of us know how your other two ancestors are faring at the moment. Even if they break free, you have to bow before the Feitian Clan. What gave you the gall to boss around?!”

Ancestral God Wen Tian’s face was gloomy, but he knew it was true. Besides, if the Feitian Clan was provoked, the other six clans wouldn’t just stand idle.

They surely could compete amongst themselves for resources, but they always stood together when another force provoked them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

They would never allow an eighth force to appear and compete with them over the cake.

“Ancestor Su, let’s go.” Wen Tian didn’t want to say another word. It was obvious that those people didn’t care for them; staying there would only be insulting.

“Apologize and compensate. Do you think you can leave just like this?” Ancestor Han’s face was cold. He had given them a bit of face, since they represented the Heaven Path Institute. Besides, Su Ping was an Ancestral God. Under different conditions, he would have made sure that the offending clan would pay the price.

Su Ping gradually looked away after staring at Ancestor Han, they looked at the sky in the distance.

After that—

He heaved a sigh.

“The Heaven Path Institute will surely…” Ancestral God Wen Tian was going to reply to Ancestor Han, when Su Ping interrupted him—

“Time for this to come to an end.”

His words stunned all the onlookers.

Once again, he looked at Ancestor Han. “I’m already terrified of faces like yours. Very tired. So, this should be over!”

“What are you talking about?” Ancestor Han frowned.

Su Ping smiled and then said to Ancestral God Wen Tian, “Brother Wen Tian, watch over the elders. I don’t want to hurt them by accident.”

Wen Tian narrowed his eyes. “You…”

There was a loud bang!

Su Ping stepped forward, causing an earthquake affecting a radius of tens of thousands of kilometers. He waved his arm, gathering the chaos universe in his hand; the manifestation grew as massive as a meteorite, and imposed a terrifying pressure on everyone.

Bang!

Su Ping waved his hand, and the chaos universe pressed down!

Ancestor Han changed his expression, now showing shock and anger. “How dare you!”

He never thought that the new Ancestral God would be that crazy. There had been other Ancestral Gods over the years who dared to attack the Seven Great Clans, but all of them were killed. That was why nobody else had tried to intrude.

However, after countless years, another reckless fellow had shown up.
