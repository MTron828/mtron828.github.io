Chapter 1254 Predestination (1)

“You’re just a remnant from old times. Are you even qualified to talk to me?”

Shen Huang sneered proudly. “You were reborn in quite the stupid way; you couldn’t even protect your own treasures. Do you really think you can conquer the universe? You’re just a chess piece. Do you really know our world?”

Having his embarrassing story brought up again made Ye Chen flare up, but he managed to hold it in. Shen Huang’s words surprised him and made him suspicious. He could tell that the former was not just threatening him; the guy genuinely despised him.

“What do you mean?” Ye Chen frowned, thinking that the guy could probably reveal something before he died. After all, he had no friends at the moment; he had the sutra old man as his advisor in the past, even if the old fellow wasn’t entirely trustworthy. He had no one at the moment.

He was cooperating with other Celestials and established the Heavenly Devil Alliance only to conquer the universe.

Infighting would ensue once they crushed the Celestials of the other faction. So, they were just partners with common interests.

“Are you scared?”

Shen Huang seemed to have looked right into his heart, seeing Ye Chen’s reaction. He sneered and continued, “It’s no use. You survived once, but you will be obliterated this time. Do you honestly think that nobody in this universe can stop you?”

“Shen Huang, you’re talking too much,” said the Saint King solemnly and then opened his hands. The silver light gathered and formed a cross that sliced through the void and flew towards Shen Huang.

“You don’t need to interrupt me. I won’t tell him; I will let him die in regret!” Shen Huang snorted and drew his saber, slicing the approaching cross.

“Die!”

Mo Ri was also quick to take action, but his target was Su Ping.

Shen Huang turned cold. “Ambushing a junior? Do you even deserve to be a Celestial?”

“Seniority doesn’t matter when you’re killing someone. Stupid!” Mo Ri said. He unleashed several Dao Glyphs that surrounded Su Ping like chains.

The latter sobered up once he felt the freezing sharpness.

He luckily caught the inspiration for the Ascendant State breakthrough he had tapped into earlier on, during that temporary lapse. Adding the chance he had to witness how his master had torn the barriers of the universe, he was on the verge to find the key to his breakthrough. Alas, he was interrupted before he found the answer.

Damn it, maybe I’ll be strong enough to fight them if I break through!” Su Ping was angry, but he didn’t lose his rationality. He would only die miserably if he were to fight them at the moment. He had to find a way to win, and his only shot was to rise to the Ascendant State.

He didn’t know how strong he would be after advancing, but at least he was certain that he would no longer hold his master back.

It’s pointless for me to understand new laws. Normal roads to the Ascendant State aren’t open to me. I cannot enter the Ascendant State even if I grasp all the Dao Glyphs in existence. This is my bottleneck…

The eight small worlds have made any advancement all the more difficult. How exactly did the Ancestral Gods rise to the Ascendant State?

“System, can you give me a hint? Just a little bit. Tell me how much energy you need. Can I pay it later?”

Su Ping thought quickly as he tried grasping for an opportunity to break through, now that his master blocked Mo Ri’s last attack.

“All answers are predestined. You should know about the chain of causality since you’ve harnessed time and space. Maybe you’ve known the answer all along.” The system sounded rather calm, as if unaware that Su Ping was undergoing a crisis. It said slowly, “This is an inevitable disaster for you. You should endure it or avoid it. That’s your fate!”

Su Ping put on an awful expression, knowing that the system wasn’t planning to help.

He didn’t blame the system for its heartlessness, though. It was very likely that he wasn’t a proper host for the system.

Considering the system’s omnipotence, it would easily find another host and nurture another expert.

I can’t be sad or angry. I cannot complain. I cannot be anxious… Su Ping quickly dispelled all irrelevant thoughts from his head. He knew that the only way to survive was to concentrate and figure out how to break through!

Su Ping had gone through lots of life-and-death moments in the decades spent roaming the cultivation sites. However, he had never felt true despair thanks to the system’s resurrections.

However, the premonition of death he hadn’t sensed in a long time was there now.

The experience gained in the cultivation sites proved to be helpful at the moment. His mind became absolutely rational as he considered what the system had told him.

The system wasn’t really standing by. Otherwise, it could have just remained quiet as usual.

The answer is already predestined…

That’s right. The system is definitely capable of seeing through the river of time. It has probably even seen the end of the era. The future yet to happen is already fixed in the system’s eyes. Therefore…

The answer has already been decided?

Su Ping thought quickly. Exactly at that moment-several killing intents were trained on him.

Su Ping woke up again, then saw his master fighting Mo Ri, the Saint King and the others. Regardless of their fierce attacks, Shen Huang seemed to be unleashing the last bit of his vitality to block them.
