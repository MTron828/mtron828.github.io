Chapter 1197: Extreme Strengthening

The red eye floated in the eternal night sky like a bloody moon.

The world enshrouded by the darkness slowed down, as if frozen. The movements of the rival Heavenly Lord also stretched and slowed down, leaving afterimages as he passed.

However, those afterimages were brought to life. They chased and attacked the Heavenly Lord in different postures.

The man was soon caught up by his afterimages, and had to fight many opponents at the same time. He left even more afterimages as he fought; resulting in him being surrounded and left injured in the end.

“This is…”

Su Ping was quite surprised by the weird scene.

What kind of law was that?

Copying? Mirroring?

“Wait a minute…”

Su Ping suddenly realized that he couldn’t see the structures making the bloody eye. The other Heavenly Lords had attacked with either weapons or creatures; however, the Night Reaper had used a bizarre eyeball that used unknown laws.

He was suddenly reminded of souls, as he had seen equally confusing methods when he fought against souls in the Naihe Soul Ocean.

Abundant golden light quickly surfaced in his eyes, bursting out like rays, until both became completely golden.

The purest god aura was emanated by Su Ping’s eyes, although he didn’t realize his master had looked down at him in shock when sensing the transformation.

On the other two corners of the triangle—both Chi Huo and Xu Kong looked at Su Ping in astonishment.

The structure of the world was being constantly analyzed by the godly pupils. Light, dust and laws were all being magnified into more primitive elements, like lines and particles.

The eyeball in the night sky finally revealed its original appearance—

It turned out to be a bloody vortex.

The vortex was revolving, sending out a bloody light. The eternal night was no longer dark, but deep red!

The contender had one of the top divine constitutions; instead of fighting his afterimages, he was absolutely still.

There were no afterimages around him, either.

However, his immortal body seemed to be decaying on the surface.

Such decomposition was slowly and gradually expanding at a visible speed. Not even the healing ability of his constitution could slow it down!

That is a perfect law…

Su Ping saw the lines of a law in the bloody vortex. It was indeed a perfect law he had never seen before; most surely the Ascendant law created by the Night Reaper.

There was actually just that single law.

The truly terrifying thing was that there were countless laws in the dark night, right where the bloody vortex was embedded!

There were dozens of perfect laws among them!

She has fused her laws in the domain. She launches attacks to anyone within the dark range once unfolded. It’s a delicate spider web! Very well hidden at that. Normal Ascendants would fall into it without realizing a thing!

Su Ping took a deep breath. The Night Reaper’s understanding of laws and battles had broadened his horizons yet again.

I didn’t see anything unusual earlier, and my own body is at the Ascendant level. It is also made of countless rare materials, and is more sensitive than those of most people. Even Heavenly Lords could be tricked in her domain…?Su Ping thought.

Still, he soon realized that his master had surely warned his senior brothers and sisters in secret about this.

Nevertheless, it’s difficult to come up with countermeasures even if they did know…?Su Ping kept analyzing the matter, imagining himself as her opponent.

The battle ended quickly. The Heavenly Lord attacked under the dark domain stood still until his body was just bones. The three Celestials rescued him and teleported him out of the battlefield, which signaled his elimination.

He recovered as soon as he was removed from the battlefield; his body healed and new flesh was generated, ultimately regaining his original appearance.

He was breathing heavily, cold sweat covering him as if having just had a nightmare. He looked fearfully at the void battlefield.

He was one of the top warriors in his level. It was extremely easy for him to slay a normal Ascendant cultivator. However, the recent events made him realize what the strongest Heavenly Lords were capable of!

He originally didn’t think much about the power gap, but then realized in battle how different they were: just like a muscular man fighting against a baby.

The golden light in Su Ping’s eyes was gone. He raised his head and asked his master with his normal eyes, “He was standing still just now. Was it because of the law in the bloody vortex?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Shen Huang’s expression changed a little. “You can see the eyeball’s true appearance?”

“More or less,” said Su Ping. He couldn’t really dispel the eyeball’s illusion with the naked eye.

Shen Huang looked at him thoughtfully, but didn’t ask about his disciple’s golden eyes. He had already made a guess; the smarter the person, the fewer questions asked.

“That’s right. It’s Liu Xia’s Ascendant State law, which was constructed with her domain. She can put anyone to sleep forever under that eternal night. She also has the Reincarnation Divine Constitution, one of the top ten constitutions!”

“Reincarnation?”

Su Ping felt dazed as he remembered Diaz, his junior who also had such physique.

“That’s right, she has the same constitution as Diaz; however, she has already developed hers to the fullest. She even fused it with elements from other constitutions, so it’s no longer a pure Reincarnation Divine Constitution. She has named it the Eternal Sleep Constitution!

“The constitution was made due to a fortuitous incident; it can’t be copied or passed on. That is why it’s not listed among the top ten divine constitutions in the Federation.”

“Got it.”

Su Ping nodded and then asked, “Master, do you know what the fortuitous incident was?”

Dazed for a moment, Shen Huang looked at the battlefield and said, “I don’t know the details, but I heard it’s related to her receiving a drop of blood from an ancient corpse.”

“A drop of blood from a corpse?”

Su Ping was stunned. Why would a drop from a corpse’s blood cause such mutations to one of the best constitutions in the universe?

He asked the question only because he had detected an aura similar to his own coming from the Night Reaper. He had never felt the same from Diaz.

Is it because of that drop of blood?

“You seem to be very interested in her.” Shen Huang saw through what Su Ping was thinking.

The latter didn’t keep it a secret. He nodded and said, “I think she could inspire me. I would love to talk to her if there was a chance.”

Talk to her…?If another Star Lord, no, an Ascendant cultivator would have said that, others would have rolled eyes at them. However, Shen Huang merely thought it was odd when Su Ping said it, but didn’t despise him for it.

He could tell that Su Ping was an independent and persistent man, oblivious to the different classes where people were typified in.

However, he didn’t have to care about classes when talking with his master, because they were already on the top tier!

“That’s not a problem. Her battle is over; I’ll ask her to come here and talk to you,” said Shen Huang immediately.

Su Ping was astonished. “Right now? Doesn’t she have more matches?”

“The second round has just begun. She just finished her match; it’s still early.”

“But won’t it distract her if she talks to me? It would also expose her secrets…”

“You’re overthinking. I don’t think she’ll mind, but it’s hard to say; all women tend to be petty. I can only try to invite her for you.” Shen Huang quickly sounded uncertain in the end.

“…”

Su Ping had the sudden feeling that his master wasn’t all that reliable.

Still, he worked fast, as Su Ping noticed Chi Huo’s strange expression soon after. At the same time, the Night Reaper raised her head and looked at him in surprise; there was also a casual indifference mixed in.

Su Ping had made glorious achievements and was totally worth investing in; it would be rewarding if he could become a top Heavenly Lord, and a major surprise if he rose to the Celestial State.

Therefore, potential investors would be able to make a profit as soon as Su Ping became a Heavenly Lord.

Night Reaper had the capital to act disdainfully towards Su Ping, since she was already successful among the top Heavenly Lords.

“She’s on board,” said Shen Huang with a smile. “She seems to be interested in you too. It wasn’t difficult to ask her to come here; after all, your multiple small worlds’ technique is too important. I hope you won’t give it away easily while talking to her.”

“I’ll try.” Su Ping didn’t give a definite answer.

Shen Huang was amused. He could glean from the clever answer that his disciple wouldn’t suffer a loss.

Elsewhere—Liu Xia flew out of the void battlefield upon receiving Chi Huo’s permission.

“Why is she out?”

“Didn’t she win?”

Everybody was shocked, thinking they had somehow misunderstood the rules.

The Night Reaper was obviously not going to explain herself, and neither would the three Celestials. She flew straight towards Su Ping, catching endless attention. Su Ping suddenly thought that he had kept too high a profile as of late.

Still, it was all to make progress. He simply ignored the curious eyes. After all, eyes couldn’t hurt people; only fists could.

However, many people in the world would often give up because of those meaningless eyes. It was hilarious.

“You asked for me?” Liu Xia had concealed her aura; she didn’t want to hurt that junior favored by the three Celestials.

She replaced her armor with a simple black dress, which made her look like the regular girl-next-door.

However, her face was too beautiful for an ordinary neighbor. At least the ones Su Ping had met couldn’t compare with her.

“Hi, I’m Su Ping.”

“Call me Liu Xia. Let’s save the self-introductions and cut to the chase,” said Liu Xia casually as she combed her hair with her smooth hand, clearly not thinking much about their encounter.

She probably wouldn’t have gone to meet him if it weren’t for his groundbreaking technique for small worlds.

Even if he had Celestial State potential, so what?

She was one of the unparalleled geniuses mostly likely to rise to the Celestial State too.

Besides, she had already grown up, and Su Ping was more of a toddler at the moment.

“My master mentioned that you had the Reincarnation Divine Constitution until it mutated due to a drop of blood from an ancient corpse you found…” Su Ping said, leaving small talk aside, “So, can you tell me what the ancient corpse looked like?”

Liu Xia realized that Su Ping didn’t address her with any respectful titles. Even though she didn’t care much for etiquette, she still disliked his lack of manners.

Still, she didn’t say anything about it, considering that Su Ping was a favored disciple and deserved to be proud of the achievements made at such a young age. She replied, “That’s the last thing I expected you to ask. The ancient corpse… To be honest, I don’t know what it looked like exactly, because I only saw one of its arms.

“Judging by structure, well, it was 80% similar to that of a human being. Of course, I’m only talking about appearances. In terms of size, it was thirty thousand kilometers long.”

“Thirty thousand kilometers…”

Su Ping was rendered speechless after that.

Thirty thousand kilometers long?

What did the creature feed on when it was alive?

“So to speak, was the mutation really caused by the ancient corpse’s blood?” asked Su Ping.

“More or less,” said Liu Xia casually.

“Then, could you let me experience your constitution for real right now?” asked Su Ping.

Liu Xia looked at him with a weird expression. “Are you asking to be killed?”

She raised her head and looked at Shen Huang. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude, but your disciple’s request is simply too…”

Shen Huang understood. He said to Su Ping, “You would be heavily injured if you were to confront her constitution’s aura.”

“You’d wish it were only that. Technically speaking, you’d die,” Liu Xia added.

Su Ping wanted to say he could endure it. But then he wasn’t sure, considering how serious they were. He asked his master, “Master, can’t you protect me?”

“If I did, you wouldn’t be able to experience the real thing. It would be no different from what you felt a moment earlier,” said Shen Huang.

Su Ping understood. He thought for a moment and said, “I still want to experience it; I hope you can accept my request.”

Liu Xia looked at Su Ping as if he were an idiot. “You do know that you’re essentially asking me to kill you?”

“…I know, but I still want to try,” said Su Ping stubbornly.

Perhaps he felt confident due to his experiences in the cultivation sites.

Seeing his determination, Liu Xia looked at Shen Huang. The latter thought for a moment and said, “In that case, just accept his request. I’ll remember this favor.”
