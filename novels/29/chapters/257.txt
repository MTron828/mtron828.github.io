Chapter 258 Eight Hell Beast

The clan master came to a realization. With an amiable expression, he said, “Sure, which one do you want to borrow? Is it the Sword Horn Frost Dragon or the Seven-Tailed Starfire Fox?”

Hearing this, Liu Yuan revealed a troubled expression as he carefully said, “Clan Master... I want to borrow your Eight Hell Beast.”

“Eight Hell Beast?”

The clan master was slightly startled.

He frowned and said with a serious expression, “Are you sure?” Liu Yuan smiled bitterly. He had no choice but to say, “Clan Master, to be honest, a pet store is competing with us. They want to monopolize the industry. They’ve already declared that they can guarantee entry into the top ten of the league. They’re extremely arrogant. They’ve also hired the Mu family’s girl to be their spokesperson and hype themselves up.

“Although we’re working with the Mu family, the Mu family has a complicated relationship, and we don’t have much contact with that girl’s branch.

“Now, everyone in Longjiang knows about this store. If this continues, most of the business of Primo will be snatched away. I have no choice but to request your divine beast to help preside over the store.”

The clan master frowned.

He never expected anyone in Longjiang Base City to dare compete with the Liu family in the pet store industry. They were too ignorant. “If that’s the case, you can just use my Sword Horn Frost Dragon. Why do you need the Eight Hell Beast?” the clan master said with a displeased expression. The Eight Hell Beast was his strongest battle pet.

He usually didn’t show it to others, much less have it taken to a shop and used as an exhibition.

Liu Yuan smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t know where that shop managed to get an Inferno Dragon. They have placed it at the entrance of the shop, shocking many people. If it wasn’t for that, I would be able to make them suffer by using my own methods and the connections I have built up over the years...” “An Inferno Dragon?” “Eh?”

Not only was the clan master shocked, even the purple-shirted elder beside him also turned his gaze over from the chessboard. His long and narrow eyes revealed hints of shock as he looked at Liu Yuan seriously.

The stares of the two Titled experts burdened Liu Yuan. He felt cold sweat flowing down his back. It was as though all the secrets in his heart were completely exposed. He hurriedly lowered his head to prevent himself from exposing his thoughts. He also feared facing their eyes.

“Are you sure?”

The clan master’s gaze turned sharp as he stared at Liu Yuan.

Liu Yuan said with a trembling voice, “Absolutely. I have a video as proof...” “Give it to me.”

The clan master stretched out his hand.

Liu Yuan hurriedly took out his phone and played the video on the net. Then, he handed it to the clan master with both hands.

The clan master took it and saw his old friend, Purple Dragon, looking over. He lowered the device so that both of them could see it.

Soon, a scene appeared on the screen.

When they saw the creature on the screen, their expressions changed slightly.

It was really an Inferno Dragon! Such a rare top-grade dragon had actually appeared in Longjiang Base City!

The clan master’s face turned dark. He hadn’t heard any news of such a pet appearing in Longjiang Base City. By right, even if other families wanted to lock down the news, the spies he planted in the various families should be able to send back the information.

“Who’s running this shop?”

“Well, according to the current investigation, it’s a young man with the surname Su. As for who’s behind him, we haven’t found out yet. However, I’ve contacted the people in the city government to help me investigate. However, they seem to be wary of this young man. They won’t say a word.”

“Is that so?”

The clan master was slightly startled and frowned.

Su?

If it was the Qin family or the Mu family, the people he planted in the city government wouldn’t help to cover for them. After all, his Liu family was also in Longjiang Base City.

“Could it be that an external force wants to interfere with our Longjiang Base City?” The clan master’s eyes flashed with a cold light. The situation in Longjiang Base City was already fixed. Normally, no external force would interfere. Even if they did, they would be chased away.

But this time, the other party seemed to be targeting their Liu family. This pet store that appeared out of nowhere had snatched the Liu family’s pet store business. This was a business that paid a blood price in their fight against other families.

How dare someone snatch food from a tiger?!

“If he wants to open a pet store in Longjiang, he has to ask me, Liu Tianzong, first!”

The clan master snorted and opened his eyes, emitting a powerful aura.

Crack, crack!

He raised his hand, and his fingers pierced through the void like a sword.

A dark vortex slowly appeared and grew larger. A terrifying and deep aura spread out from it.

Liu Yuan felt the surrounding temperature drop drastically, as though it was about to freeze. His heart trembled uncontrollably as he knew what monster the clan master had summoned.

Eight Hell Beast!

This was a pet of a ninth-rank demon-type pet!

It was said that this Eight Hell Beast had the bloodline of Beast Kings. If they were raised to their peak, there was a small chance that they would evolve into Beast Kings!

In terms of value, this Eight Hell Beast was almost on par with the Inferno Dragon.

However, this Eight Hell Beast was already at its peak!

The Inferno Dragon at the entrance of the store was just a recently-matured adult. If both pets were placed together, the Inferno Dragon would be like a baby in front of the Eight Hell Beast which was at its peak.

A cold and sinister aura was released from the summoning space. A huge, ferocious beast slowly descended and floated in the air outside the pavilion. Its movements were extremely gentle and slow, as if it was afraid of destroying the villa with the slightest exertion of its strength.

Liu Yuan looked at the pair of cold and brutal eyes and felt his heart beating wildly. Although he knew that his clan master was by his side and that there was someone controlling it, the killing aura of this peak demon-type pet was still too strong. He felt that he could be killed at any moment!

The Blue Dragon Guard below the pavilion knelt on the ground and were extremely respectful towards the Eight Hell Beast. This Eight Hell Beast was not just a mere pet, but it was also highly intelligent. It enjoyed a very high status in the family. Even the upper echelons of the family had to greet it respectfully.

“I’ll lend you Blacknether. Don’t disappoint me.”

Liu Tianzong said coldly. ‘Blacknether’ was the name he gave the Eight Hell Beast.

Liu Yuan’s body trembled as he quickly said, “I will not disappoint your expectations.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The purple-shirted elder at the side glanced at the Eight Hell Beast and said with a smile, “It’s been a few years since we last met. The aura of Brother Liu’s Blacknether has increased by quite a bit. It should have reached the peak, right?”

“It’s still early,” Liu Tianzong replied indifferently.

The old man in purple smiled and did not say anything else.

“I will ask the city government. I want to see what kind of guts they have. How much money did they spend to cover up the eyes of our Liu family’s spies. Are they blind despite so many years of cooperation?”

Liu Tianzong sneered with a hint of anger in his eyes.

Liu Yuan was trembling and did not dare to speak.

“You may leave.”

“Yes, Clan Master. Thank you, Clan Master.” Liu Yuan turned around and said to the purple-shirted elder, “Senior Purple Dragon, I’ll be taking my leave first.” “Sure.”

The purple-shirted elder smiled.

Liu Yuan lowered his head and retreated. When he reached the bottom of the pavilion, he raised his head and looked at the ferocious beast in midair. His heart trembled as he respectfully chanted, “Senior Blacknether...”

“There’s no need to say anything else. Lead the way.”

A cold and deep thought entered his mind.

Liu Yuan did not dare to say another word. He was even more afraid of this Eight Hell Beast than facing the clan master. After all, it was a beast, and a most ferocious demon-type pet. Cases of them devouring their masters were common, let alone others.

After boarding his luxury car, he instructed the chauffeur to return to the store.

The beast rose into the sky and followed behind the luxury car...

After watching the Eight Hell Beast leave, the purple-shirted elder retracted his gaze and said to Liu Tianzong, “The reason behind how this shop obtained the Inferno Dragon is probably not simple. In the recent Investiture of the Gods Trading Pavilion, there hasn’t been any news of a dragon transaction. You should be careful and investigate it thoroughly.”

Liu Tianzong glanced at him and nodded slightly. “Of course. If they dare to invade Longjiang Base City, the city government will not do anything if it’s a local faction. If they are outsiders, I want to see where they are from. They haven’t sought trouble with the Zhou family and the Ye family; instead, they targeted my Liu family. Do they think that the Liu family is the easiest to bully?”

The purple-shirted elder’s eyes flickered as he said, “Do you want me to take a look for you tomorrow?”

Liu Tianzong glanced at him. He didn’t have anything to hide or put on a strong front in front this old friend. Although he was furious in his heart, he still had some reservations when he saw the Inferno Dragon.

Being rash because of his fury made it impossible for a family clan to last for a hundred years.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you. I’ll treat you to drinks when you’re back.” “Then let’s drink that bottle of Dragon Marrow Liquid.” “Old man, you must have been eyeing it for a long time ago.” “Haha...”

Outside the shop.

As time passed, more and more people gathered.

Three hours after the advertisement, at 9 p.m., Su Ping discovered that all the nursing pens and upgraded storage spaces in the store were full...

According to the system’s request, the pets in the store could only be stored in nursing pens and storage spaces.

He could no longer receive any more guests.

Only then did Su Ping come to his senses. He flipped through the records and saw a dense list of records.

There were so many people in no time at all?

Su Ping took another look at the energy revenue.

840,000 energy.

1111

Su Ping remembered that after upgrading the store, there was only 400,000 energy left. In other words, he had doubled the energy in one day?

400,000 energy a day?

If he had 400,000 energy points, it was equivalent to 40 million astral coins.

And this was only because he had hit his store’s storage limit. Otherwise, he could still continue to collect more revenue. Su Ping flipped through the records and found that most people chose ordinary training. There were only about eight who requested professional training. Five of them had selected the top 100 combo. In the top 100 combo, apart from professional training, they also had to buy some pet food. The cost was two times that of normal professional training. It was about two million. However, the pet food was gradually being sold later and was only recorded under the combo’s bill for the time being. The transaction hadn’t happened.

Moreover, nine million of Liu Ping’s deposit of ten million that he received previously wasn’t converted into energy because he had not used the store’s services. Only one million points of energy was converted because of the professional training.

The remaining nine million was still in the form of astral coins in his accounts. It was equivalent to Su Ping holding it in escrow for Liu Ping.

After the subsequent feeding and training would the coins be deducted and converted into energy.

With the quota in the store, if all of them receive professional training, the amount received in one day would be astronomical... Su Ping didn’t expect to see such quick effects. It had only been a day and he had already received 400,000 energy points, which was a result of a large number of normal training

If the number of people who chose professional training increased, he would earn more energy.

400,000 a day. If it’s ten days, it’ll be 4,000,000. With just 1,000,000 energy, the Spirit Pool will be upgraded. At that time, I’ll have a high chance of raising a Beast King... Su Ping’s eyes lit up. He was excited.

“Boss, I choose normal training.”

A young customer in front of the counter said in a refined manner.

Su Ping came back to his senses. He glanced at him and said apologetically, “Sorry, we’ve reached maximum capacity today. Please come again tomorrow. I’m really sorry.”
