Chapter 1198: Awakening of Ultimate Darkness

“All right. In any case, you can reverse time and bring him back to life.”

Liu Xia no longer insisted. She would only need to show her constitution to have a Celestial expert owe her a favor; it was definitely a fair deal.

Shen Huang raised his enormous hand and imposed a stream of power on the pair; they were caught in what appeared to be a solidified water ball.

Once inside, Su Ping and Liu Xia immediately felt that the space around them was infinitely stretched. They were still standing on the throne’s armrest, but the area had grown to a degree that it made them feel they had entered an independent world.

This is a Celestial expert’s world…

Su Ping examined the environment carefully; the world was similar to those of Celestials from the cultivation sites, but still vastly different from those of Star Lords, as it was bigger and with fewer flaws. No flowing laws could be seen; they seemed to be standing in the old universe.

Its overall making was clearly different from those of Ascendants too, where the aura of flowing perfect laws and the Ascendant State power could still be detected.

If Star Lords have small worlds, Ascendants have big worlds and Celestials have… small universes!

Su Ping had an epiphany while recalling things he had read in some secret books.

Perhaps the entities above the Celestial State had created real universes.

Then, what did Ancestral Gods grasp?

“Ready?” Liu Xia’s question sobered him up.

He focused his attention and nodded. “Yes.”

Liu Xia didn’t hold back once she received confirmation. A dark and abundant Ascendant power burst out of her body. It seemed as if there were a destructive black hole in her chest, which was about to consume her body.

Dark stripes were surfacing on her fair skin, and golden divine power was flowing in those circuits.

Su Ping gradually felt excited as her aura began to spread, as if some ferocious beast were being awakened inside him. However, such a stimulus didn’t frighten him; rather, his blood was flowing faster, beyond his control. His heart was beating fast too, and his pores were opening.

His body was gradually entering battle mode due to the energy surge!

“Huh?”

Liu Xia’s keen senses noticed that something was off. She narrowed her eyes and looked at Su Ping, only to find that his eyes were calm, with a dab of hidden excitement.

She suddenly wondered if she was too alluring.

She had already adjusted her body to her satisfaction. Countless Ascendants cultivators had pursued her; had she manipulated them, she would have already gathered as much wealth as the top seven families in the universe.

“Humph. Pull yourself together!” Liu Xia snorted but ignored Su Ping’s rude expression, as the favor was already owed. Besides, Su Ping was merely a Star Lord; it was understandable that he would fall to her charms. It wasn’t his fault.

The abundant dark aura completely covered her body soon after. Her body then transformed and revealed what it actually was.

There were scary and sharp stings on her head, which spread out like horns. Her whole body was covered in purple and black stripes; bones protruded on her collarbone like scythes, and her fingers became long and sharp. Her energy armor was gone, substituted by a softer black covering that accentuated her breasts and made her look sexy and alluring.

Su Ping stared at her, feeling quite excited.

The Sorcerer’s Divine Constitution—formerly suppressed by the ancient deity constitution and the soul entity—was almost breaking the genetic restraints.

This aura… is of the same kind!

According to the Golden Crow elders, this is an ancient constitution. The creatures that were first born in the universe, long before the gods, were known as sorcerers!

There were all sorts of mythical creatures in the age of sorcerers. The mutation of her constitution has to do with sorcerers. Did the arm she saw belong to one of them?

All kinds of thoughts rolled around in Su Ping’s head. There was an extremely long history when it came to the evolution of life. As far as Su Ping knew, there was the era of mythical creatures, the era of gods, the era of deities, and the modern era, when all kinds of techniques were created.

Maybe I’ll be able to fully activate my Sorcerer’s Divine Constitution if I find the arm she mentioned!?Su Ping’s eyes glittered with excitement.

Once his constitution was working in full, he would be able to grasp the underlying path. Maybe it would be another path that would allow him to establish a small world!

“You…”

Liu Xia stared at Su Ping and somehow felt uneasy, even though she had lived countless years. She even felt a bit shy.

As a result, she nearly ignored the fact that Su Ping was able to endure the effects of her constitution!

“Huh?”

Shen Huang was still focused on them, and also noticed Su Ping’s peculiar status. He gazed at him for a moment, and was shocked.

An Ascendant State body?

He was greatly shocked. He knew that Su Ping was amongst the top geniuses, and still, he had underestimated his disciple.

A Star Lord with an Ascendant State body was a first for him!

Even though the Ascendant power was faint, Shen Huang was sure that Su Ping did have such a body.

No wonder he could endure the current pressure without being crushed.

Is there anything else about this disciple that I’m not aware of??Shen Huang was shocked and speechless, thinking he was an embarrassment as a master. He never taught Su Ping much, and the latter kept on slapping him in the face. Was the youngster self-taught?

He grew vigilant upon remembering the store backing the boy, and his eyes glittered.

Fortunately, he was Su Ping’s master after all. Given such a connection, getting in touch with Su Ping’s backer was possible.

Liu Xia also noticed Su Ping’s bizarre condition at the moment, then narrowed her eyes in shock.

“Ascendant State power… Your body is…”

Su Ping’s body also responded to the stimulus of her constitution, becoming completely dark. His eyes also turned black, emitting a wicked aura. He felt like a bottomless abyss.

Her eyes widened. She had never been as shocked in the 100,000 years prior.

“He has already grown up. Is this why he’s confident?” Liu Xia knew that Su Ping would be capable of using Ascendant treasures with his current body, and would only get killed unless he was too reckless!

Only the top Heavenly Lords or Celestials could present danger to his life!

Besides… His body is giving off an aura. It’s really familiar…?Liu Xia gradually felt that something was awfully wrong, and her blood seemed to be boiling. There was an unconscious drive to approach Su Ping. The similar aura coming from Su Ping’s body seemed to be much purer!

She couldn’t help but walk towards Su Ping; they were drawing closer, and closer.

Her aura was even more stimulating to Su Ping as the distance shortened. Su Ping woke up from a dazed state, then realized that his Sorcerer’s Divine Constitution had been activated. He no longer tried to hide it, using it in full force since it had already been exposed.

The surrounding rays of light seemed to be swallowed. Not just that, all substances and energy were gone too.

The Sorcerer’s Divine Constitution was transforming all energy into pure dark energy.

“I didn’t expect you to be such a big surprise…” Liu Xia looked at Su Ping with a face showing conflicting emotions. She remembered all the miracles the kid had worked; she had never anticipated to find that he would attain an Ascendant body while still being a Star Lord!

“Do you know where the arm you mentioned is right now?” asked Su Ping.

Liu Xia’s eyes glittered. “Your constitution has the same aura as mine, but that’s not the Reincarnation Divine Constitution. Is your constitution related to the ancient corpse too? That’s the only explanation possible. It’s been frozen in my master’s treasury; if you want it, you must ask your master to help.”

“Okay.” Su Ping nodded, believing that his master would indeed help.

“Your body…”

Liu Xia’s eyes glittered. She couldn’t help but touch Su Ping’s chest, feeling even closer to him. There was an itching feeling across her body; a certain voice was shouting inside her heart, asking her to meld with Su Ping’s body and his aura!

Su Ping shivered when Liu Xia’s finger touched him. He suddenly felt the strong urge to tear that woman apart and assimilate her into his body.

Fortunately, the extraordinary willpower he had developed after his visits to the cultivation sites had aided in curbing his rising desire. He took a deep breath and gritted his teeth. “Better keep some distance from me.”

Liu Xia also controlled her thoughts. She looked at Su Ping with a troubled expression. “Your master owes me a favor. Now I’ll be giving you another gift.”

Her hand left Su Ping’s body as she spoke. The special link between them was cut off, but the excitement was even greater than before.

The next moment—dark power arose in her palm, turning into a ball that quickly smashed into Su Ping’s body.

After a boom, Su Ping felt that his head went blank, then felt a thrill akin to having seen the most delicious food; his head was out of control for a moment.

Roar!

Su Ping roared like an animal, but Lu Xia had already controlled her body and moved away by then. She feared that she would do something embarrassing if she stayed too close.

Some sort of balance seemed to have been broken in his body. He was surrounded by a dark power, which turned into a giant ball.

His roar weakened while being inside that energy sphere, seemingly having regained his self control.

Liu Xia glanced at him, then canceled her constitution’s aira. She moved out of Shen Huang’s universe like a wisp of smoke.

Shen Huang stared at her as she reappeared outside the sphere. Her actions confirmed the expectations for a top Heavenly Lord, having easily broken free from a Celestial’s universe.

Although he wasn’t completely serious, it was still fairly easy for her to get out.

“What did you give him?” asked Shen Huang.

“What he wanted.” The redness on Liu Xia’s face faded away, gradually returning to her former cold demeanor. She said to Shen Huang, “If that is all, I’ll be on my way.”

Shen Huang looked at her and nodded. “Thank you.”

Liu Xia nodded in silence, then flew back to the void battlefield.

Once Liu Xia returned, everybody realized that she had just left the battlefield because of Shen Huang’s invitation.

“Shen Huang invited the Night Reaper in the middle of this important contest, all for his disciple’s sake, and Chi Luo gave her permission. It seems that all three Celestials think highly of the kid!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You don’t say! He’s only a Star Lord right now. He’ll surely become a Heavenly Lord to look up to when he enters the Ascendant State.”

“Becoming an Ascendant isn’t that easy. Many geniuses remain stuck in the bottleneck their entire lives; it’s hard to tell.

“That being said, there’s still a great chance for him to break through. Those who are really persistent are rare; let’s not piss him off.”

Everybody was discussing, none underestimating Su Ping, the rising Star Lord.

The juniors taken there to watch the contest were mostly Star Lords. They looked at the dark sphere on top of the throne’s armrest with conflicted expressions.

They were all unparalleled geniuses in the outside world, but Su Ping had eclipsed them all.

The gap between us will only get bigger and bigger…?Diaz heaved a helpless sigh, as he had long given up on the idea of catching up to Su Ping. Still, he was jealous to see the latter’s privileges.

Shuai Qianhou shook his head while nursing complex feelings.

Su Ping continued his contemplation in a pure, dark world atop the Celestial’s armrest, while Heavenly Lords were fighting in the distance.

He seemed to be in another time and space.

It feels as if I were in the Divine Eye or the deity rivers in the cultivation sites again. Is there a door to another world deep inside this constitution?

Su Ping wondered, then felt the intense power of darkness. He was absolutely awake at that moment; all kinds of understandings regarding the Sorcerer’s Divine Constitution surged inside his head.

Su Ping had an epiphany.?Perhaps this is what the universe looked like at the beginning…

At the same time, in the void battlefield—

A brilliant sword aura sliced a red domain open. Heavenly Lord Jian Lan and a peer from the Yuantian family were fighting fiercely, both equally strong. Neither of them could split their attention and cover their domains anymore, and merely focused all their strength on attacking.

“Grandmother…”

Loulan Lin felt concerned. A Heavenly Lord of her family offered to aid her viewing, so she could see the battle.

Elsewhere—Chi Huo was communicating telepathically with the Night Reaper, who had just returned to the battlefield.

“What did Shen Huang ask you to do for his young disciple?”

“Master, his disciple requested to meet with me. He wanted to see my constitution.” Liu Xia was forthcoming about the matter. She paused for a moment, then continued, “Shen Huang owes me a favor now; I also gave his disciple a gift. In addition, his disciple is already capable of fighting on his own right now.”

“Capable of fighting on his own?”

“That’s right. He has already attained an Ascendant State body!”
