Chapter 1500: Sorcerer Ancestor Hun Yu (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Also, that universe… was too brilliant.

The light’s power filled up every corner. Su Ping had never seen such a brilliant cosmos, which seemed to harbor billions of stars.

This is not an undying universe… He raised his head and looked towards the source of a horrifying pressure. He then saw a gigantic creature emitting an imposing aura, its size as big as a star. Just one quick look inspired such reverence that made Su Ping want to kneel.

Ancestor!

Su Ping knew it was definitely as strong as the Golden Crow ancestor.

!!

However, the appearance was different. It was a fat creature with the likeness of a huge toad, only much more formidable. It was radiating an abundant aura of chaos, and its pores released infinite light. It was surrounded by brilliant stars as it breathed.

The pressure felt by all the travelers was considerably reduced as the ancestor took action and blocked the Wheel of Judgment. Su Ping stopped hesitating; he turned around to charge at the high wall of the Heavens along with the dragons.

The high wall was no longer intact after the attack of the massive golden dragon; cracks began to appear.

The Heavens seemed to have given up on their previous plan, now splitting their forces into squads and marching towards the dragon formation.

Su Ping controlled the dragon head and fought five Heavenly Dao warriors. To his surprise, all of them were as strong as Ancestral Gods. Furthermore, their coordinated attacks rendered him incapable of defending, despite the help of the dragons.

The longer he fought, the more brutal he became. Although forced to retreat, he stopped trying to block them and attacked with full strength.

Bang!

His sword was soon able to rip one of the Heavenly Dao warriors apart, but the remaining four returned the favor and ripped him to pieces. Even his undying universe was pulverized.

Su Ping’s body was soon reborn and he established a new contract, which reconstituted the weakening golden dragon. He charged at the remaining four Heavenly Dao warriors. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The aliens were rather surprised, but they were still expressionless as they surrounded him. Their teamwork was seamless; Su Ping was unable to fight back.

The latter burned all his power and slashed at one of the enemies, but they were ready for it this time. The other three took action and blocked Su Ping’s attack, which failed to destroy the target’s Wheel of Judgment.

Su Ping’s power was burnt up. He could only wait until it was regenerated.

As he fought on, he discovered that the giant dragon formation was quickly declining. He turned around, only to see the dragons being slaughtered by the Heavenly Dao.

Despite the dragon array’s protection, the Heavenly Dao warrior squads were on a killing spree, causing several wound-like cracks on the golden dragon figure.

Deprived of the protective side of the array, the dragons within were easily hunted by the Heavenly Dao squads, incapable of offering resistance.

Su Ping noticed the dragons’ relentless attitude, fighting without a single thought of running.

He even saw the Inferno Dragon and the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon fighting alongside them with bloodshot eyes.

Su Ping’s expression looked troubled. All his allies would be annihilated if they continued like that.

He raised his head and looked around, only to see battles everywhere. The other Ancestral Gods were also surrounded by Heavenly Dao warriors.

As for the ancestor, it was fighting a blurry shadow in another dimension, high above. It had no time to lend a hand.

All of us will die if this goes on…

Su Ping’s heart was turning cold as he watched. He wasn’t afraid of death; besides, he wouldn’t truly die here. He only felt sorry for those who were fighting hard; they would die for good under such conditions.

He was determined to fight alongside them, but he had the option of leaving by resorting to resurrect in a random place if he was the only one standing.

As for the others, only their bodies would be left there.

Bang!

Su Ping forced the four Heavenly Dao warriors to retreat. The golden dragon’s strength had declined, even more as dragons were injured and killed. Su Ping could barely resist against the four Heavenly Dao warriors, and he was no longer able to fight back. Even if he risked his life, the enemy was prepared to counter that tactic.

Should we just run?

Su Ping swallowed. Being an Ancestral God, he could spread his thoughts to the entire battlefield. Who knew if those fighters would listen to him, but at least they would hear him.

However, Su Ping found it difficult to spit out what he had in mind.

While looking at the furious faces of the blood-soaked fighters, he knew they had already ruled out the option of “escape.”

They would fight until their last drop of blood was shed!

“Heavens… You’ve gone too far!!” Su Ping gritted his teeth. If all those beings died, it wouldn’t just be the demise of a single universe.

There were already countless dragons behind him.

Boom!

The battle continued. Su Ping’s didn’t last for long after his combat ability was negated, so he chose to burn his vitality and resurrect through the system, all to rejoin the fight right after.

The lack of strength became increasingly evident as the battle continued. The undying universe of fire was too weak to tackle four Heavenly Dao Ancestral Gods.

As for an epiphany in battle… It didn’t matter anymore.

Su Ping had already seen his path. What he needed was not an epiphany, but the time to cultivate.

When his level was low and the gap in strength was small, a momentary enlightenment could represent a lot of cultivation time spared and a surge in combat ability. However, it was very difficult for an Ancestral God like him to become stronger.

For his strength to grow, he could only work on condensing a second undying universe. However, this would take time.

Boom!

Su Ping fought and shed blood again and again. He couldn’t remember how many times he had resurrected, and he couldn’t see the dragons anymore. They were all dead.

He saw that some Ancestral Gods had died in other battlefields; they were clearly on the losing side.

Still, even though failure was so clearly inevitable, those who were still alive seemed oblivious to the fact. They were still fighting in a crazy and tireless manner, as if the war had just begun.

Su Ping didn’t roar anymore; he simply drained his strength over and over to attack. He knew they were losing the war, but he chose to fight with them until the last moment.

Bang!!

The entire battlefield shook after an intense impact. Su Ping stopped his crazy hacking and slashing to see the enormous ancestor landing. The brilliant universe behind its back had already dimmed; it looked like a black ball, as all its light was completely gone.

Su Ping’s heart couldn’t help but race.

The ancestor rolled its enormous eyes and looked down at the entire battlefield with sadness and impotence. It suddenly opened its mouth and released a power.

Su Ping and the Heavenly Dao Ancestral Gods he was fighting were instantly knocked away.

At the same time, our hero sensed how he was being enshrouded by a warm and magnificent power; still there was a sense of exhaustion coming from it.

The previously chaotic battlefield was split apart at that moment.

The Heavenly Dao was separated from the others.

“Leave this place. Try your best to survive. Your sacrifice is meaningless…” said a distant thought. Although the message was constructed in a different language, Su Ping could clearly and precisely feel the emotion conveyed.

He was in shock.

At the same time—the others who were saved also recovered from their battle-frenzied status. They looked at the ancestor’s majestic back with bloodshot eyes. Some even fell on their knees and cried.

A gentle yet exhausted voice sounded in Su Ping’s head, “Little guy from the primitive clan, thank you for your help. The Hun Yu Clan will remember your favor. I’m sorry for not helping when your clan was destroyed. I hope your bloodline is able to carry on…”

Su Ping was instantly dazed. His pupils widened a little bit, as the ancestor was talking to him alone.

So, he had been considered as a member of the Primitive Chaos Clan.

“Senior, you should run with us!” said Su Ping in a hurry.
