Chapter 1380: Running (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Everybody was stunned to hear what Su Ping said.

Run…

Where to?

The light of hope soon appeared in everybody’s eyes. They gazed at Su Ping; behind this young man was the ancient and mysterious magic store… Maybe there was a way out?

“Mr. Su, do you have a solution?” asked someone.

!!

Shen Huang, Chi Huo and the others also looked at Su Ping with hopeful eyes. Su Ping, whom they had never gotten to know fully, would very well surprise them again.

The latter realized what they were thinking, making his heart heavy; he didn’t answer. Instead, he asked the system in his heart, “If those aliens invade the store, can you slay them?”

Su Ping wasn’t fully convinced when the system said it wasn’t a battle system.

“Those are just the basic forms of the Heavenly Dao. They can be killed.” Then, the system added, “However, if the Original Heavenly Dao is there, I suggest you avoid encountering it.”

Su Ping was dazed; indeed, the system knew the Heavens very well. He instantly asked, “What are the basic forms of Heavenly Dao? What level is the Original Heavenly Dao at?”

“The weakest members among the Heavens are basic forms of the Heavenly Dao,” said the system, “As for the Original Heavenly Dao, it’s as strong as the Golden Crow ancestor you’ve seen before. Of course, I’m not scared of those existences; I only suggest that you avoid wasting your energy like that; it’s pointless to fight them.”

Su Ping changed his expression. The Heavenly Dao beings who were strong as God Emperors were only the basic form.

No wonder even the Golden Crow ancestor chose to hide.

Even the mysterious and proud system had advised avoiding them!

The system was a super cheat able to crush all the other existences in a novel. However, it somehow seemed to be approaching its limits at the moment.

That being said, Su Ping believed that everything existed for a reason. The system was created in that universe; perhaps it was the manifestation of some sort of ancient power.

If that was the case, it would naturally be restricted by the rules of the universe.

He didn’t have time to dig deeper on the subject; he had no choice in the matter.

Even if he did kill the basic forms of the Heavenly Dao with the store’s self-defense mechanism, who knew if more and stronger members of the Heavens would be drawn by his actions?

He also didn’t think that killing those entities with the store’s self-defense mechanisms was realistic—

Not because the system was incapable of doing so, but because those creatures weren’t dumb.

Su Ping failed when he tried to lure Ye Chen into the store to kill him. Those Heavenly Dao creatures would think twice once they noticed the store’s unusual nature. After realizing its might, even if they couldn’t break in, they could still destroy everything outside of the store’s protection!

The place was incapable of launching attacks voluntarily. Maybe it would be supervised and even taken to the Heavens’ territory…

Su Ping acted right after thinking of the possibilities. He quickly said, “The only solution right now is to escape. Bring with you as many people as possible. You’ll hide in my store, and we’ll leave this universe to look for allies!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Everybody looked at each other in bewilderment. There was probably not a second choice, considering how he phrased it.

Even the powerful and mysterious magic store wasn’t enough to do something?

They didn’t think that Su Ping was holding back; his devotion in the previous battle suggested that he was willing to sacrifice himself, and that he was determined to beat the invaders.

However, the number of aliens left them in despair. No matter how powerful Su Ping’s magic store was, it was impossible for him to resist that many aliens; escaping was a natural choice.

“Just go. Don’t go too far. Don’t overestimate yourselves,” said Su Ping. Time equated to lives at the moment. Although cruel, the decision was realistic, and he didn’t have another choice. Given such a disaster, he could only save as many as he possibly could. He would save all of them if he could.

Nobody said a thing. They all left in a hurry.

Naturally, their primary targets to save were their own subordinates.

Those who abandoned their close ones and chose to save strangers would be called “good people” and “heroes,” but that was against human nature; a cruel act in itself.

The strangers left behind would be unable to blame them, even if they were angry. After all, they didn’t turn a blind eye to strangers; they only lacked the time. In terms of fairness, even if they saved people randomly, it was still unfair for those who weren’t picked.

Once the Celestials set off, Su Ping summoned his pets and sent them to nearby planets, so they could accommodate the residents in their universes.

After that, Su Ping also set off; his first choice was the Blue Planet.

There were a lot of familiar faces there, including his comrades who had gone through disasters with him.

Su Ping reached the planet soon after.

The place had already turned into a very prosperous node. The ruins and Mysterious Realms found there were treasure troves that attracted many explorers.

Su Ping was the planet’s legal owner. Even if those experts went to check the place, none of them dared to act over the top.

He covered the whole planet with his perception, noticing a lot of familiar faces and regular customers.

They had limited potential and couldn’t keep up with him. Instead of making a living in the universe, they stayed there and developed their hometowns.
