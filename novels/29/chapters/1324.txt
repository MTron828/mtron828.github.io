Chapter 1326 Great Paths Like Worms (1)

Can Dao Hearts be given away?

Su Ping was truly shocked. The Dao Heart was a symbol of God Emperors, which were extremely rare, even in the world of gods. It wasn’t hard to imagine that even the high-ranked clans with Ancestral Gods would have difficulty raising God Emperors.

The fact that he received that many offers when he became a Dao Child further proved that point.

However, the Golden Crows’ ancestor was directly giving him a Dao Heart!

Without a doubt, that method was definitely beyond an Ancestral God’s capabilities.

I never thought that Ancestral Gods themselves weren’t the apex of cultivation. Even the Golden Crows’ ancestor has been living in seclusion to avoid enemies… The more Su Ping thought, the more shocked he became.

Just as the ancestor’s voice died down, he immediately saw three balls of light floating in front him, carrying different auras; they were like three mini universes.

The light surrounded him, and he immediately felt they were three real universes with different attributes.

Su Ping’s mind touched the universe on the left side. The world seemed to be falling apart before his eyes and he was falling into an abyss. The illusion was produced because his mind was sinking into that universe.

It was brilliant and splendid.

Once the darkness receded, Su Ping was instantly shocked by the universe.

It was more beautiful than any universe he had ever seen.

......

Countless stars were scattered like brilliant crystals, flowing like rivers. It seemed that all the stars in the universe had been gathered in one constellation, making it unusually prosperous and splendid.

The void of the universe surrounded his body. Su Ping could feel the universe’s reigning attributes; it seemed to be absorbing him.

However, upon careful examination, he discovered that his body was uncontrollably being attracted to said universe. His body was voluntarily melting into it!

“What kind of universe is this?” Su Ping was rather shocked.

The universe before him changed all of a sudden, the brilliant starry view becoming an ancient path. The Dao Heart hidden in the universe was revealed as a purple-golden ball of light.

Once his mind touched the light, he seemed to be struck by an infinite rush of information that went into his head. He suddenly realized what the Dao Heart of that universe was.

“Harmony of the universe!”

That was the Dao Heart awakened by that many great paths.

It could transform invaders or other universes. Even the attacks of other God Emperors could be partly transformed when they clashed, to halve and weaken their effect.

“Fusing billions of mythical creatures and absorbing stars of the universe to achieve harmony…” Su Ping mumbled. His consciousness sank in the vastness of the Dao Heart.

After a long, long time

It was like the passage of ten thousand years.

Once Su Ping had comprehended the information fully, he realized how terrifyingly powerful that Dao Heart was. He also understood what a Dao Heart was. Compared to a universe with a Dao Heart, his universe was downright vulnerable!

Su Ping felt that, if he wanted to, he could directly absorb that Dao Heart and recreate it in his universe of chaos, all to become as strong as a God Emperor!

However, Su Ping wasn’t hasty. The Golden Crows’ ancestor had prepared three Dao Hearts for him; he wanted to compare them.

Time moved on.

In the blink of an eye-Su Ping experienced all three Dao Hearts.

They were Harmony, Desolation and Hundred Phenomena.

The Desolation Dao Heart could significantly weaken the enemy’s universe and paths. It was a highly aggressive and destructive Dao Heart.

As for the Hundred Phenomena Dao Heart, to Su Ping’s surprise, it could summon clones of many ancient mythical creatures and have them fight for him.

The projections of those creatures were as strong as Golden Crow elders, or the Ancestral Gods. Their power depended on the person who summoned them. Undoubtedly, those clones would be no less powerful than their summoner; so, he could summon a dozen mythical creatures as strong as himself!

They are truly unparalleled Dao Hearts…

Su Ping looked at the three Dao Hearts with glittering eyes. Anyone would become a famous and strong God Emperor if they inherited a Dao Heart there!

“Which one do you want to pick?” asked the Golden Crow ancestor indifferently.

Su Ping knew that the ancestor was dissatisfied with him because of the previous misunderstanding. After thinking for a moment, he asked, “Senior Ancestor, if I grasp the three Dao Hearts, can I become as strong as you?” “No.” The ancestor’s voice became even colder.

Su Ping wasn’t too surprised. He wouldn’t have offered three of them at once if it was possible to train an ancestor-level expert with the three hearts. He could have offered them to the geniuses of his clan, such as Diqiong, to raise more ancestors-level experts and their race wouldn’t have to live in seclusion anymore.

“In that case, I appreciate your kindness but I won’t pick any. I’d rather rely on myself and walk my own path. I will condense my own Dao Heart!” Su Ping cupped his hands and declined the offer.

“Are you sure?”

The ancestor sounded surprised, obviously not expecting the human to resist the temptation of grabbing three unparalleled Dao Hearts.

“I have to create my own path. Even if my Dao Heart can’t compare to any of those three Dao Hearts, it will belong to me,” said Su Ping solemnly.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
