Chapter 408 Yuan Family Girl

So, this was the beginning, huh? Su Ping said to himself. A golden mark appeared between his eyebrows. Some force was waking up inside him, trying to drag him away.

But soon, hindered by something, the golden mark lost strength.

Su Ping: ??

Just then, he sensed he was about to be teleported away but that strength disappeared.

Did the teleportation fail?

He could not believe this. He thought he could go there with a mere thought no matter where he was.

All of a sudden, he realized something. He was still in the store’s territory. That had to be something the Dragon King had failed to anticipate.

He quickly walked out of the door.

“Where are you going?” asked Tang Ruyan in surprise, as she was commanding the two Liu Family elders.

Out of instinct, Su Ping darted a look at her bottom. He cleared his throat. “I have some errands to run. Take care of the store with Joanna. Do not leave the store.”

Tang Ruyan had no home to return to and the three Tang Family elders were still there. Su Ping was not worried that she would run away so he didn’t send her into the scroll this time.

Tang Ruyan raised her eyebrows but said nothing else other than, “Take care and hurry back.”

Su Ping said yes and then stepped out of the store. He flew up to the sky across the street, an area not included in the store’s domain.

Teleport!

The golden mark emerged between Su Ping’s eyebrows again. The next second, a beam of golden light covered him up. With a whooshing sound, he vanished on the spot.

His disappearance stunned Tang Ruyan speechless.

The two Liu family elders and the rest of the Liu family members who had gone there to clean up the street were gazing with wide-open eyes as well. What was that about?!

Su Ping opened his eyes. He found himself standing in an ancient and desolate land. In front of him was a huge dragon’s skeleton. It had once been the old Dragon King. No flesh remained over the bones. There seemed to be something inside the eye sockets that were gazing at him.

This is...

The area above the ninth dragon bone.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He was not afraid of the dragon skeleton. But he was interested in the girl who was climbing up the dragon bones.

While he was thinking, a bubble-like item jumped out in front of him. There was a projection on the item, showing the view of the tower.

Some battle pet warriors were wearing black armor standing in front of the tower.

Those were all advanced battle pet warriors; all of them exuded an intimidating aura. Standing in front of them were several titled battle pet warriors.

By the door was someone Su Ping was familiar with. It was the old man who had been defeated by Joanna.

Su Ping’s expression became grave as he looked at the old man. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Joanna could defeat this old man within one move but he couldn’t.

The Little Skeleton had a combat strength of 16. Theoretically speaking, the Little Skeleton was able to kill those who had just reached the legendary rank. However, Su Ping had yet to gain a clear idea about the old man’s actual strength.

Joanna was at the legendary rank but his combat strength was at 29.6 and should have progressed to 30 by then.

The legendary rank covered a wide range. Su Ping suspected that the most powerful legendary battle pet warriors could have a combat strength of over 100!

He based his speculation on the scoring system of legendary skills. If that were the case, then those at the peak of the legendary rank could be more than ten times stronger than those at the entry-level. The gap was even wider than that between battle pet warriors at the peak and the lower position of the titled rank!

Battle pet warriors at the peak could kill those at the lower position, which also applied to the legendary rank. Su Ping couldn’t afford to underestimate the old man whom he had not fought against yet. In reality, he had but one life. He would not take the risk to fight the old man unless it was absolutely necessary.

After all, on the off chance that the old man’s combat strength was at 20, the Little Skeleton might not be able to stop him!

Of course, there was another possibility, which was that the old man merely had a combat strength just a bit over 10. In that case, the Little Skeleton would easily subdue him.

A fifty-fifty chance.

“The fifth bone already...”.

Su Ping squinted his eyes and gazed at the glow on the dragon bone tower. The fifth bone had lit up. Merely one to two minutes had passed since he sensed someone entering the dragon bone tower. The girl was surely climbing up without stopping for a moment. The fifth dragon bone was formidable enough to stop many talents.

Reaching the fifth bone was hard even for Tang Ruyan.

As for the sixth bone, Tang Ruyan would not pass it no matter how hard she tried.

As Su Ping was pondering, the sixth dragon bone was lit up.

That was fast.

The one at the first place on the Pioneer’s Ranking could only reach the sixth dragon bone and that record had just been broken.

There had been no new names added to the Pioneer’s Ranking recently. Therefore, that girl had not been included in the ranking since it was unrelated to the Dragon King; the listing was administered by the financial group that was secretly controlling the Mysterious Realm. They used the dragon bone tower as a place to test one’s strength; it was also a tool for them to attract talents from various places.

Of course, the attracted talents at Tang Ruyan’s level would merely function as scapegoats.

The Tang Family had only sent over Tang Ruyan, not their actual future family head. That was probably because the Tang Family was aware of the secrets.

Soon, the seventh dragon bone was lit up.

Su Ping looked at the time. Only two minutes had passed. The girl was as fast as he was back then.

Surprised by the shocking speed, the people standing outside were conversing in a low voice.

“It is a pity that I can’t see the inside clearly.”

How vexing He tried it several times but the strange bubble didn’t change the view to the inside of the dragon bone tower. He couldn’t manipulate it. This might be a mechanism to protect the girl who was climbing the tower. After all, once this girl succeeded, she would become Su Ping’s competitor. Indeed, it wouldn’t be fair if Su Ping could see this girl fighting and climbing.

Su Ping had to be patient and at the same time, ready himself for the upcoming fight. He believed that after the girl climbed to the final bone, the remaining two dragon scale lands would be opened up.

The old man’s subordinates might have been already waiting at the seal of the remaining two dragon scale lands.

When the challenge succeeded, the seals would be undone and the girl would gain the upper hand. Yuan Tianchen surely had the belief that this sudden move would catch Su Ping off guard.

So, the old man wasn’t aware of the legacy mark’s effect.

Maybe the tower had already been heavily guarded to stop him from entering; that way the girl would be able to pocket the legacy to herself.

The eighth dragon bone was lit up some time later.

Su Ping looked at the time. Still, two minutes.

He was worried. The girl surely had saved up some strength! As the eighth dragon bone was lit up, the many people guarding outside the tower were becoming excited. Su Ping squinted his eyes. The girl had made it to the ninth dragon bone. He could tell that she would finish at any time and stand in front of him.

Time moved on, bit by bit.

Soon, five minutes passed.

All of a sudden, from the image projected on the bubble, he could see a beam of glaring golden light burst out from the ninth dragon bone.

The ninth dragon bone had been lit up!

She passed the test!

Su Ping looked to the left where the air was trembling. A slim figure walked out. She was wearing an azure armor for women and holding a sharp sword in her hand. She was panting and staggering. It seemed to be a girl of about 17 or 18 years of age.

Su Ping wasn’t all that surprised. After all, the higher one’s rank was, the more difficult the challenge would be. The dragon bone tower had been established to test one’s aptitude after all.

He could faintly tell that the girl was also at the sixth rank, similar to his strength!

As such, the girl could easily defeat battle pet warriors when she was at the sixth rank, and she could compare to a battle pet warrior at the upper position of the titled rank!

If she were to participate in the Elite League, she could have had a chance at the global championship!

Su Ping sized up the girl. As the girl was trying to catch her breath, she suddenly realized something was off. She looked up and saw Su Ping who was standing not far from her.

The surprised look froze on her face.

Seeing her standing there in a daze, Su Ping put on a solemn look and said in a low but awe-inspiring voice, “Art thou the human seeking my legacy?”
