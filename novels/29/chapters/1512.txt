Chapter 1513: The Last Upgrade (1)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

The guy from the Haotian Clan and the rest of the prisoners shivered and collapsed on the ground.

“On your knees” was the Original Dragons’ ancestor’s thought translated in a way Su Ping could understand. It meant to surrender in the most humble manner.

The prisoners had different body structures and didn’t understand what “on your knees” meant. However, they instinctively assumed the humblest postures they could think of. Some spread out like liquid, while others shrank their heads into their bodies, which were the most humiliating acts as they begged for mercy.

“Howl!”

The Dark Dragon Hound, the Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon and the other pets screamed and shivered as they fell as they tried to withstanding the pressure of a Sorcerer Ancestor, a being two realms higher in cultivation. The latter’s willpower suppressed them like concrete hands. They had to surrender.

Su Ping sent them back to the summoning space the moment they fell on their knees. Only he and the Inferno Dragon were staring at the Sorcerer Ancestor.

Although shaking, Su Ping didn’t give in just like that, but he couldn’t last for long. The ultimate dragon expert was more horrifying than he thought.

He had met the Golden Crow ancestor and Sorcerer Ancestor Hun Yu before, but neither of them took him as an enemy; he only felt an indirect pressure from them. Now that he was facing the dragon expert, Su Ping knew that the latter could easily wipe him out with a mere thought!

The gap between Undying State experts and Sorcerer Ancestors was even bigger than that between an adult and a baby. They were like dragons against ants.

The Inferno Dragon gritted his teeth and tried to roar. However, an irresistible might was imposed onto it, making it hard for the beast to open its mouth; its body also began to fall down beyond control.

“You can’t control all the dragons in the world. Never!” Su Ping gritted his teeth. His eight universes exploded, turning into a storm that swept towards the Sorcerer Ancestor.

The Original Dragon snorted.

It was nothing more than some air being exhaled, but it was enough to snuff out the violent and scorching power.

Both Su Ping and the Inferno Dragon also vanished along with that power.

“Huh?”

The dragon ancestor narrowed its eyes as it looked at the slowly healing vortex. All its fury and coldness were gone; it became silent.

The entire Dragon Prison became completely solid at that moment. All the creatures on the thousands of floors of the universe stopped moving as if frozen; even their torturing was paused.

Everything was soundless.

…

Inside the store.

Su Ping and the Inferno Dragon stepped out of the vortex.

The power of a supreme law suppressed them and reduced their bodies to normal as they got back inside the store. Su Ping and the Inferno Dragon quickly adjusted their bodies, from planet-sized to a normal scale; the former also recovered his human appearance.

“Phew!”

Su Ping heaved a sigh of relief. Indeed, the system didn’t lie to him; they were easily teleported back, right in the Sorcerer Ancestor’s face.

He felt amused by imagining the frustration on the dragon ancestor’s face, but he was soon disappointed and regretful; all this time, he had been wandering the universe while looking for allies victimized by the Heavens.

The Original Dragons would undoubtedly be extremely powerful allies. It was a pity he couldn’t ally with them anymore. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Even under the threat of the Heavens, they’re still fighting against each other. How pathetic…

Maybe, it’s not the Heavens brutalizing all the other clans; they’re actually brutalizing each other…

Su Ping took a deep breath, feeling somewhat desperate.

There was plenty of misery in the world caused by one’s own kind.

Like civilians capable of persecuting officials, while also persecuting their neighbors who were also civilians.

“System, why do you think living creatures in the world must fight each other? We should fight against the Heavens and nature. However, the experts who have managed to cultivate enormous strength often prefer to show off in front of weaklings and even suppress their own people with that same strength. Why is that?”

After a long time of silence, the system replied, “It’s an instinct related to life.”

“An instinct? Is it something that not even mythical creatures could get rid of?”

“All living creatures have it,” replied the system, “Just take a flower for example. It’ll become bigger and stronger after absorbing enough sunlight. However, it will also conquer the territory of its own kind and claim even more energy at the same time.

“One flower blooms, and a hundred blades of grass wither.”

Su Ping remained silent.

Yes, even flowers and grass had that instinct.

That was the raw wild nature of all living creatures.

“System, do you think the Heavens behave like this, too?” asked Su Ping all of a sudden.

Silence.

The system was silent for a long time, as if not knowing how to answer.

It finally said, “If I say that they don’t, would you think they’re better?”

Su Ping frowned and pondered for a moment, before he shook his head. “No. They’re my nemeses; they destroyed my home. No matter how unified and harmonious they are amongst themselves, it’s pointless to me.”

The system only made a nasal sound in response.

Su Ping didn’t ask further. The stronger he was and the more things he saw, the more helpless he felt.

Perhaps, the loneliness of a real strong guy was partly caused by not having anyone to talk to, and partly because they were unwilling to talk to anyone.

Su Ping pushed the door open and walked out.

The noises in the store instantly made him feel he was back in the mortal world; it was a sense of familiarity. While his eyes wandered to look at Joanna, Green Lady, and Tang Ruyan who was greeting customers at the door, he was reminded of his parents and his naughty sister.
