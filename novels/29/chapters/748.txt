Chapter 750: Combat Ability Beyond a Hundred Points

Soon—

The Dark Dragon Hound’s Heavenly Tribulation was over.

The Dark Dragon Hound weathered through the whole process without Su Ping’s help. Its combat ability was then further increased to 39 points!

The hound’s appearance was a mixture between a dragon and a dog; it had exuberant fur and seemed powerful enough to break a mountain with its claws.

Su Ping was quite satisfied to see that his pet had managed to pass the tribulation on its own. It was quite dangerous, and not every beast could have passed it that easily.

The more talented a beast was, the more powerful and dangerous a Heavenly Tribulation would be!

There seemed to be laws of judgment during the Heavenly Tribulation... Su Ping looked at the dispersing clouds, deep in thought. He had understood something while observing the trial happen.

He would keep the memory of what he had understood; there could be a chance to somehow apply it in the future.

At the same time—

The Green Alligator and the white-scaled Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon—the one that Su Ping had brought back from the Rumbling Thunder Continent—were staring at the Dark Dragon Hound.

The Heavenly Tribulation had truly left them stupefied.

Their own tribulations weren’t worth mentioning at all when compared to what they had just seen.

“It’s time I passed knowledge to them.”

Su Ping summoned the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound to get closer.

As for the Green Alligator, it was merely his customer’s pet. Being the selfish guy he was, Su Ping only intended to give it the regular training menu; he wouldn’t pass knowledge to it.

No knowledge should be given easily; Su Ping was going to pass his own understanding to the pets.

“You’re really going to do that?”

Joanna was quite surprised to hear that. She said, “They’re just your battle pets. They would later be total strangers if you someday terminate the contract because they can’t keep up with you, or for some other reason!”

“I won’t terminate their contracts as long as I’m alive. As to keeping up with me, I’ll make sure they can by training them. I also hope they can all surpass me and become stronger than me!” said Su Ping.

There was the affection of an old father in his eyes.

The Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound had been through life-and-death battles with him. How could he not repay their loyalty?

Joanna stared at him but didn’t say anything.

Those pets could keep him company for a long time, considering their bloodlines and aptitudes. It wouldn’t be considered a loss to pass knowledge to them.

However, it was just Joanna’s perspective. Su Ping had never considered if there was any loss. Like he said, he simply wanted his pets to grow in strength and even surpass him!

He had never been afraid of being attacked by his pets. He considered the Inferno Dragon and the Dark Dragon Hound as partners, both children and comrades!

He trusted them more than anybody else!

Su Ping asked the Inferno Dragon to be the first.

The Inferno Dragon obediently walked and stood in front of Su Ping, making the earth rumble as it walked. The pet looked intimidating, but was in fact quite docile.

Su Ping smiled and laid his hand on the dragon’s leg.

The next moment, he closed his eyes and transferred the sets of comprehension in his head.

The knowledge of annihilation... The knowledge of lightning... The Middle-rank Acceleration Guide...

They were the top abilities in Su Ping’s possession. Two of them even involved laws; he shared them with the Inferno Dragon without hesitation.

Su Ping let go of his hand half an hour later. A clear and sharp golden light flashed in his eyes; he looked at the Inferno Dragon and checked its specs.

Property: Dragon Family (one fourth of demon bloodline)

Rank: Intermediate phase of the ninth rank

Combat Strength: 106

Aptitude: High-high

Talent Skills: Elementary Agility Talent, Elementary Strength Talent, Mid-Level Acceleration Talent

Bloodline Abilities: Inferno Flames, Thunder Dragon’s Body, Void Impact

Laws Mastered: Lightning Class (Boom), Darkness Class (Annihilation)

Skills: Lightning Prison, Hellfire, Lava Ocean, Dragon Smash, Lightning Strike, Dragon Clone, Thunderous Tornado...

A combat ability of 106 points?!

Su Ping widened his eyes and rubbed them hard after seeing the numbers, only to find that they weren’t deceiving him!

Its combat ability was truly higher than a hundred, and by six points!

How is it possible?

The combat ability threshold for the Star State was a hundred points, according to the system’s metrics!

Anyone with a combat ability of a hundred points would be as strong as a Star State being.

The Inferno Dragon only had thirty points of combat ability before the knowledge transfer. The number had surpassed the hundred mark after the session!

The power of the two laws improved its combat ability by almost seventy points!

That improvement was completely unbelievable!

Su Ping was so shocked he only realized what was happening a few minutes later.

The power of laws was a Star State power. Even some Star State experts had barely mastered one law! The power of laws was the reason why Star State warriors could easily kill those at the Fate State.

All the fancy skills meant nothing in front of the power of laws, unless the skills were extremely rare bloodline abilities.

The Inferno Dragon had just mastered the power of two laws. Logic alone could make one see that it would be much stronger than those at the regular Star State!

Adding the Mid-Level Acceleration Talent Su Ping had just acquired, it was even possible that the Inferno Dragon could instantly kill a Star State being!

However...

The Inferno Dragon’s level was too low.

It had been fighting hard under Su Ping’s training, enduring hundreds of Heavenly Tribulations, which purified and compressed its energy; its astral power was even purer than that of Ocean State beasts!

The purer the astral power was, the more energy it would contain. The Inferno Dragon’s energy capacity had also been increasing because of all the exhausting battles.

That was the reason the Inferno Dragon, the Dark Dragon Hound, the Little Skeleton and Su Ping had much more energy than other people at their level.

Still... the Inferno Dragon’s level was too low!

The body and cultivation in the mid phase of the ninth rank presented a massive constraint. The Inferno Dragon didn’t have enough energy when compared to the real Star State; it could only struggle to carry out the power of laws as Su Ping did before entering the Star State!

Fighting with the power of two laws would leave it exhausted!

Nevertheless, the Inferno Dragon had a combat ability over a hundred points!

That was the official Star State combat ability!

If they ever met the Lord of the Deep Caves again, even the Little Skeleton could deal with it!

After all, even though the Lord of the Deep Caves was a Star State beast, it was limited to the Blue Planet and only had beast kings’ methods. It only knew the power of laws; it had not perceived other Star State skills.

The mid phase of the ninth rank, versus the Star State!

That was exactly the Inferno Dragon’s unbelievable combat ability and aptitude!

Su Ping was quite excited to see the “high-high” aptitude displayed on the profile stats. It was the best aptitude rating that he had ever seen!

One step further, and it would become the ultra level!

Above the ultra level was the Chaos Multiverse Ranking. The names on that list were from all the unparalleled geniuses at the top of the world!

While feeling a rush of excitement, Su Ping couldn’t help but ask the system, “The Inferno Dragon is only at the mid phase of the ninth rank and as strong as the Star State, and yet its aptitude is only high-high. Then, what’s the ultra level? Can they fight the Star Lords when they’re in the advanced phase of the ninth rank?”

He was also shocked as he formulated the question.

Could there really be such a horrifying being?

That was beyond the description of a genius. It was more like a monster!

It never occurred to Su Ping that the Inferno Dragon’s aptitude would have already shocked a lot of people if it went out.

“Aptitude depends on bloodline, species, level and many other factors. Level isn’t the only criterion,” the system said casually, “If it’s not a dragon but a lowborn rat, then it will have ultra aptitude for its Star State combat ability in the middle phase of the ninth rank.

“However, it’s a dragon. Even though it’s not a dragon with a noble bloodline, some dragons that have the same bloodline have been born with greater talent in countless eons and worlds. If it’s able to fight against a Star Lord, its aptitude will surpass the ultra level and it’ll appear on the Chaos Multiverse Ranking!

“However, it will be only at the end of the rank, with a million beasts ahead of it.”

What the system added almost made Su Ping vomit blood.

A beast as strong as a Star Lord when it was merely in the mid phase of the ninth rank could only be behind the millionth place in the Chaos Multiverse Ranking?

How many horrifying monsters were out there in the world?

Su Ping didn’t think it was possible. If the news were to spread out, all the Federation’s denizens would probably be dumbfounded.

“So, only those who can compare to the Ascendant State can be considered to be at the top?” asked Su Ping, not entirely convinced.

He thought that it was too hard, if possible at all!

He couldn’t even think about it!

No matter how talented a beast was, how strong could they be when their level was so low?

“Nothing is impossible,” the system said indifferently, “During the passage of countless worlds and eons, some extraordinary beings had been born with rare opportunities. I’m telling you this because I want you to know that you’re still poor at training and there’s a long road ahead. I hope you can develop a pet that’s listed on the Chaos Multiverse Ranking. I’ll give you a huge reward when that happens!”

Su Ping felt like vomiting blood.

Am I really poor at training?

It was true that nothing was remarkable in the eyes of the system!

His rising pride was instantly shattered. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The pets sold on the streets of the Federation were probably all garbage according to the system’s standards!

However, once you considered how the system rated them, they really did seem like garbage!

All of them were lowly and inferior.

Damn it!

Su Ping was at a loss for words; the system’s standards were too high.

He heaved a sigh and shook his head. Anyway, there’s still a long road up ahead...

Even though the energy boost won’t be no different from before, my real combat ability will probably soar if I merge with the Inferno Dragon right now, all thanks to releasing the power of laws. The Vast Sky Thunderous Dragon King would never have a chance to escape if I ever encountered it! Su Ping thought to himself.

The Inferno Dragon had mastered the power of two laws. The old dragon would definitely end up crushed if the former and Su Ping combined their powers!

Su Ping was excited by the prospect.

He summoned the Dark Dragon Hound and transferred knowledge to it.

The process was soon over, and the Dark Dragon Hound’s combat ability was also above the hundred point mark!
