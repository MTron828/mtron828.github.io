Chapter 1375 Faith (2)

Everybody had a powerful faith. Orders were instantly sent out, one after the other. The entire defense line and the command center were revived. The command center was like the brain; once the brain became excited, the soldiers in other defensive positions were quickly mobilized to the second defense line.

Shala! Shala!

The worms passed by the alien and swarmed towards the second defense line, and soon occupied the whole section. However, once the worms arrived, the bombs that had been planted in advance were detonated. Countless worms were killed and destroyed in a flash.

An arc-shaped, bloody fire illuminated the starry sky.

However, more worms swarmed over like dark clouds after the fire burnt out. They crushed the second defense line and moved towards the third defense line.

The alien also flew towards the third defense line.

The void opened a second time; arms came out and attacked him.

However, the alien was fast to react. He threw out his Wheel of Judgment and slashed off the arms.

Then, the creature moved onward, ignoring the remains from an old age.

“The more you try to stop me, the more likely it was hidden here…” The alien’s eyes were all coldness. Although he could sense the target, he believed in his own judgment.

Once the target was found, he would be able to send the word out.

“It’s coming!”

......

In the third defense line-everyone narrowed their eyes and looked ahead. The universe was quiet, and so were they. They could almost hear the crawling sounds of worms from a distance.

The worms quickly reached the third defense line, breaking the silence. Countless soldiers were roaring. The alien approached in an unhurried manner while others fought. He looked at the soldiers in the third defense line and uttered another strange syllable. The void trembled abruptly, and so did everyone fighting there. Then, they became solid and were then broken to pieces.

The scene was exactly the same as it happened in the second defense line. Everybody was desperate. There had been lots of soldiers in the massive defense line, and yet they couldn’t resist that alien’s one syllable!

The power gap made them feel desperate.

“Is that thing a Celestial?”

“Where are our Celestial experts?”

“Why? Why is this happening? Is humankind really going to perish?”

On every planet-countless people were filled with despair as they watched. Civilians and billionaires alike were pale as they watched.

At the fourth defense line-a group of people stood in front of the fortresses with awful expressions.

“The third defense line… is gone too.”

“It’s too fast.”

“I wonder if we can resist the attack.”

“It would be so not worth it if we just die like this.”

Those people’s auras were concealed and powerful. All of them were Ascendants. Some of them were even famous Heavenly Lords.

There were many faces that Su Ping was familiar with, including Song Yuan, Chunyu, Liu Xia, and others.

They were ready to sacrifice themselves in battle. However, the onslaught that took place on the third defense line made them feel desperate. It would be fine if they died after fighting to exhaustion. Considering their combat abilities, at least they would have killed countless worms by then.

They were only afraid of not even resisting the alien’s yell.

Such a way to die was too frustrating.

However, nobody backed off at that moment.

There was nowhere to go.

Behind them was the last line of defense.

Song Yuan broke the silence, “Let’s go forward and fight them; we’ll be able to hold them back for a moment. Even if the alien shows up and kills us all, he will have to attack again when he comes here.”

His words shocked them all.

Leave the defense line and resist the enemy halfway?

Is it any different from suicide?

However, everyone was silent after hearing the proposal.

Indeed. The entire defense line would be erased if they couldn’t resist the alien yell.

They were Heavenly Lords, but they were still in the Ascendant realm. The alien was a universe dominator, which was two levels stronger. Who was confident of stopping him?

The ever taciturn Chunyu said, “I agree.”

His eyes were cold. “This way, we will be the 3.5th defense line, creating another obstacle for the enemy. Master and the others are practicing the divine array; we must buy time for them.”

“You are downright crazy,” said someone with a bitter smile.

“Have we truly reached the end…?” Liu Xia whispered. The famous Heavenly Lord seemed lost and regretful too; however, there wasn’t the slightest trace of fear on her face.

“Everybody dies. Let’s make sure that our deaths are glorious!” Someone stood out casually and determined, with the pride of a Heavenly Lord. “That’s right. There’s nowhere to go. Putting our lives on the line is the only choice!” declared Song Yuan.

Then, without hesitation, he simply charged towards the void.

He didn’t force the others to follow; after all, it was a suicide mission.

“How I hate this…” One of the Ascendants heaved a sigh. Then, he unsheathed his sword and followed Song Yuan as they headed to the distance.

Liu Xia summoned her pets; her eyes were gentle and pitiful. “Sorry. I should remove the contract and let you go, but I still need your power…”

“It’s an honor to die with you, master,” said all her pets, obedient and respectful.

The next moment, Liu Xia also embarked on the journey with her pets.

“My descendants, your ancestor will block the enemy for you, until the very last moment.” Some Heavenly Lord looked back, peering toward a certain planet in space.

The next moment, he moved forward; no hesitation marred his stance, either.

One Heavenly Lord after the other followed Song Yuan to the darkness ahead, knowing they would never return.

Their determined and harrowing voices were captured and transmitted to everyone watching. Countless people shed tears

S.

In space

Song Yuan and the others had already met the worms halfway.

“Is that the alien?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Song Yuan saw the alien moving at the rear of the swarm coming from the distance. He could only perceive the creature; it was some sort of strange yet twisted coldness. It was high and lofty, as well as unpredictable, like the darkness in the abyss.

The mere aura had made Song Yuan feel a chill. He knew that he couldn’t even beat one of the alien’s fingers.

That was a universe dominator!

He took a deep breath, and scorching battle intent started to burst out of his eyes. He summoned his pets and charged at the swarming worms.

Song Yuan and the other Heavenly Lords were like tiny fireflies before the swarm, and were soon drowned.

However, right after they were overrun, they unleashed flames that burned the worms.

“Die!”

Liu Xia and the others followed him and roared ferociously.

Soon, a tremendous number of worms were killed. Several openings were made as worms died.

A purple light was flashing among the invaders. They were a few Purple-Armored Worm Kings. One of them jumped out, trying to execute Song Yuan and the others who were surrounded at the moment.

“It’s the worm king!”

Song Yuan and the others slightly changed expressions, instantly feeling they had been locked onto.

Exactly at that moment-a dazzling, golden light shot through space from a distance. It turned out to be a gigantic golden sword!

The sword cut through time and space. It came from a place within the defense lines, and slashed to exterminate the worms.

The Purple-Armored Worm King, which was about to exert its full strength, was hit by the sword. Despite its gargantuan body, it was like an ant under the finger of a giant, and was easily killed off!

The unexpected scene left everyone in shock.

The next moment, everybody turned to look back, only to see a dazzling giant striding towards the worms, as if emerging from times of yore.

One step of that giant crossed billions of kilometers!

“Master…”

Song Yuan and the others saw the golden giant, and their blood almost flowed backwards. Even though they couldn’t see their master’s face, they knew it was the Titan that all the Celestials had built up together.
