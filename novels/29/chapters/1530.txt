The shape of the store had turned from a cube into a sphere.

Joanna was still in one of the rooms; she seemed to be asleep.

Green Lady, Tang Ruyan and the others were cultivating in another room.

“Is that…?”

The lobby in the store became extremely vast. All the items were gone; there wasn’t even a counter. There was only emptiness.

!!

There was a hazy glowing figure in the emptiness. It was a beautiful girl with her back against him.

Su Ping looked at her in a daze. He had an extremely familiar feeling from the girl’s back, but he found it hard to believe.

“You’re back.”

The girl turned around and looked at Su Ping calmly.

Her eyes were like lakes reflecting the brilliance of all stars. Her face was the image of unparalleled beauty and tranquility. She was breathtaking.

She gazed at Su Ping.

This familiar voice…

Su Ping’s head was ringing. He was dumbfounded.

The voice belonged to the system!

This girl was the system!!

The aura was so familiar that Su Ping thought he was dreaming; however, he was already an Ancestral God, and would easily know if he were hallucinating. Everything was real.

Was that the real appearance of the system?

“You…”

Su Ping took a deep breath, then said with a heavy and bitter tone, “Why are you a girl?”

“…”

The girl was silent for a long time, before she said softly, “Can’t you be serious?”

“I’m very serious,” Su Ping said, “This is a very serious question. Please erase everything you’ve read from my head.”

The girl asked back, “Aren’t you curious why I look like this?”

“Why?” asked Su Ping.

“Because this is my original appearance,” replied the girl.

Su Ping took another deep breath and said, “This answer is truly… surprising.”

The girl said softly, “I know you have a lot of questions, and I will answer them for you. Now is the time for you to know.”

“How can I resurrect Little Skeleton?” asked Su Ping immediately, while staring at her.

The girl pursed her lips, as if expecting he would ask this first. She said, “You searched for the Little Skeleton’s soul in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. Not being able to find it was the only natural outcome, because you didn’t go to the real Chaotic Realm of the Undead.”

“I didn’t go to the real Chaotic Realm of the Undead?”

Su Ping felt dazed.

“The real Chaotic Realm of the Undead was already destroyed. The souls of the living creatures in this world will float for a while and then disappear without a chance to reincarnate, unless they possess other bodies,” explained the girl.

“Then…”

“Don’t worry,” said the girl. “There’s a Sorcerer Ancestor who can easily resurrect anyone, except for another Sorcerer Ancestor.”

Su Ping asked immediately, “Who?”

“Sorcerer Ancestor Shi Mang,” said the girl. “If you find him, he will help you resurrect the Little Skeleton.”

Su Ping silently made note of the name. He then asked, “Would he be willing?”

He was afraid that the guy would be as short-tempered as the Original Dragons’ ancestor. If that were the case, it would be useless even if he begged. After all, he wasn’t qualified to negotiate or trade with a Sorcerer Ancestor!

“He would,” The girl put on a smile and said, “He’s always been obedient.”

“Obedient?”

Dazed, Su Ping stared at her and said, “Who are you exactly? Can you talk now?”

“Don’t you already know?”

“The system? Stop joking. No species can develop such an AI, unless you tell me that there are other worlds beyond this Empyrean space that’s already beyond all other universes. But that would be impossible. This is the end of everything,” said Su Ping.

Once he became an Ancestral God, it became increasingly clear to him that the system was not simple.

The girl chuckled and said, “It’s time to tell you everything. This is indeed where the original point of everything is, and I was the first creature born from the original point. You may call me… Mother of Chaos.”

“Mother of Chaos?” Su Ping was stunned.

The girl revealed a piece of shocking information. “All twelve Sorcerer Ancestors are my children.”

Su Ping was shocked. He looked at her in disbelief, but he soon remembered all the powers that the system possessed and everything clicked. No wonder the system could go to all worlds, including the Golden Crows’ ancestor’s hideout without being noticed. So, she was the Golden Crow ancestor’s mother.

“Then who’s your husband?” asked Su Ping.

“…”

The girl was slightly surprised by the question. She was the all powerful Mother of Chaos, and she had spent a long time with Su Ping, yet she couldn’t really keep up with his train of thought.

“You wouldn’t think it’s the Heavenly Dao, right?” The girl looked at Su Ping suspiciously.

“Is it not?”

Su Ping was slightly surprised. He had truly made that wild guess just then. After all, the Heavenly Dao had slapped the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors in the face. It wasn’t hard to believe that it was the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors’ father. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The girl shook her head and replied, “I didn’t create the world of chaos until after I gave birth to the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors; nobody kept track of time until they were born. I had already fallen asleep by then, so nobody knew about my existence. Even the cyborgs merely kept records of some of the Sorcerer Ancestors’ deeds.”

Su Ping listened carefully and said, “What’s the Heavenly Dao, then? If you gave birth to the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors, you must be stronger than them, right? Can’t you deal with the Heavenly Dao?”
