Chapter 1351 The Breeze (2)

The master of the Red Dome Realm hesitated for a moment, but didn’t say anything in the end. Master Tian Dan was ready to pay such a dear price, just for some fire; it was obvious that the medicine he was planning to refine was extraordinary. He would not tell her the truth even if she asked, as it probably involved Ancestral Gods’ secrets.

Su Ping cupped his hands and bade them farewell. Then, he left the ninth floor along with the realm master and returned to the hall.

“Dao Child, the depths of the Heavenly Fire are extremely dangerous. You must be fully prepared before you do anything. Although the pills are great, they’re not worth the risk,” said the realm master to Su Ping.

“I won’t overdo things,” said Su Ping.

Then, he left the Fire God Palace and entered the void to teleport back to his store.

Once back in his store, he extended his perception beyond the pet room, only to discover that the streets were much more crowded. Also, most of them were high-level battle pet warriors, generally above the Star State; many were even Ascendants.

He also detected some familiar auras near the street. All his senior brothers were resting in a building on that same street.

This place seems to have become the center of the Celestial Court... Su Ping’s eyes glittered as he took in the scene. It had to be one of Shen Huang’s arrangements. If anything happened, hiding in his store was the only choice. There was an ancient divine array in the Celestial Court, but they still weren’t sure if it was strong enough to resist the attacks of a universe dominator.

Rhea was already inside the Celestial Court’s divine array. If the array gave out, Su Ping’s store would be their last line of defense.

“One, two...”

...

Su Ping’s senses were spread throughout the planet, only to discover that the only Celestial auras belonged to Chi Huo and Xu Kong. His face turned cold; his warning back at the conference seemed to have been uttered in vain.

Su Ping opened the pet room’s door and entered the store’s main space.

The store was crowded at the moment, but in an orderly fashion; nobody dared to cut in line.

The store owner was Shen Huang’s disciple and a top Heavenly Lord. Who would dare cause trouble?

There were all kinds of rumors about Su Ping’s identity, but the one thing that everybody had confirmed was that Shen Huang’s disciple—who had risen to prominence since a few prior—was as strong as a top Heavenly Lord.

Aside from Su Ping, what really kept everyone in check was the presence of the “clerks” in Su Ping’s store.

The goddess never concealed anything purposefully. All the Ascendants could easily tell that the blond behind the counter, other than being stunningly beautiful, was also a Celestial! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Her pressure was so overwhelming that every Ascendant who had once met a Celestial could tell. That was also the reason why no one dared to talk loudly. They glanced at the girl every now and then, fearing that they could piss her off.

“You’re back.”

Noticing his arrival, Joanna raised her head and stared at him with glittering eyes. As expected, Su Ping’s aura had clearly changed again.

He grows significantly every time he goes there. Does he really not have any bottlenecks to tackle? Joanna’s eyes glittered; Su Ping’s cultivation speed amazed her. The kid who at one time needed her protection had already surpassed her and was flying further away at a speed she couldn’t understand.

She finally understood Tang Ruyan, who felt frustrated and complained all day for a while.

“Thank you for your hard work.”

Su Ping looked around and saw that Tang Ruyan, the most excited of all, was about to jump at him. He said to her telepathically, “There’s something I need to do. I’ll be back.”

Tang Ruyan’s rushing figure stopped abruptly, and then Su Ping disappeared.

The next moment, reappeared inside a building on the same street.

“Master.”

“You’re back.”

Shen Huang, who was watching a virtual battlefield, was quite taken aback by Su Ping appearing out of nowhere, but he managed to hold back since it was the second time happening. He said with great relief, “It’s great to have you back. The Celestial god in your store said that you go to dangerous places every time to leave. I was truly worried that you wouldn’t be able to return.”

“You went to my store?” asked Su Ping.

Shen Huang nodded. “Back in that meeting, you asked everyone to come and join the alliance. We’ve been in negotiations with them ever since. Chi Huo and I talked to some Celestials separately, but none of them seemed to be willing; I think the master of the Black Desolation Star Zone had already reached an agreement with them.”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes. “What’s their attitude right now?”

“Just like before; they only backed off a little bit. Their main concern is that they won’t get any say in major decisions.” Shen Huang heaved a sigh. “They worry that their troops will be sent to the front lines as cannon fodder. Those Celestials have lived unrestrained for far too long. The Primordial Empyrean Master never set any rules for us; we were like emperors of our respective dynasties, seeing to our star zones. The only rule set by the Planet of Origin was that we mustn’t fight each other and destroy the universe.

“Other than that, there are only a few restraints. So, they’re very uncomfortable with joining the alliance.”

Su Ping realized what was going on and said indifferently, “These are special times. They have to adapt, even if it’s uncomfortable. Are the soldiers in the front lines comfortable with fighting the worms? Are the refugees who have been forced to migrate from their destroyed planets comfortable with living among people who speak another accent on another planet?

“Nobody’s comfortable during the war. They think they’re different from ordinary people and feel that they can negotiate. But that’s just them overthinking!”

Shen Huang slightly changed his expression. Although Su Ping was quite blunt, he knew it was the truth.

Su Ping snorted and said, “They’re just frogs at the bottom of a well; so arrogant while they are merely Celestials. They don’t know what those creatures are capable of! Inform them and convene a meeting. I need them to obey. Just erase them if they don’t know any better. It’ll be easier to subdue and unite all the star zones without having them as obstacles.”

Shen Huang was greatly surprised. Is Su Ping getting ready for a killing spree?

In any case, those guys were Celestials. If Su Ping enraged them all, even if he could kill them, it would be a difficult task.

Besides, the alien lurking among the worms could be anywhere in the universe. Su Ping could be caught in a dangerous situation if he decided to leave the protection of the Celestial Court.

“If we hold a virtual conference, it’ll be like last time at best. We can threaten them, but they won’t be intimidated,” said Shen Huang.

Su Ping had managed to hurt one man in the conference, but that was just a threat. Even if he could override his permissions thanks to his Dao expertise, the man could exit the Astral Nexus at any moment.

“They won’t get away as easily as before. Who says you can’t kill someone who is connected in a distant place?”

Su Ping’s eyes were cold. “I will have them know that I can wipe them out, even if they’re billions of stars away. Those frogs in the well will know that there’s still a long way to go in their cultivation journey, and that there are a lot of battle methods that they cannot imagine!”

Shen Huang was rather appalled.

He knew that Su Ping would never brag. Could it be that Su Ping is really able to kill a Celestial located on the other side of the universe?

That was just a fantasy for him, completely beyond his understanding.

“Are you as strong as a universe dominator right now?” Shen Huang couldn’t help but ask. His heart was pounding. It would be shocking if that was true.

Universe dominator!

In the entire history of the universe, they stood out and were deemed legends without giving detailed descriptions. Even the Primordial Empyrean Master was only suspected to be a universe dominator.

That was the ultimate level that Celestials pursued; Su Ping was already there?

How long has Su Ping cultivated?

“I haven’t tried yet, but it’s likely that I’m not. Still, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to kill them.” Su Ping shook his head. He felt much more confident after the Heavenly Fire polished his body. However, he didn’t think he could beat a God Emperor head-on just yet.

Shen Huang was shocked and speechless. Su Ping talked about killing a Celestial with ease, and the target would be far away, somewhere in the universe. If he could kill a target from such a remote distance without even seeing them, wasn’t he a universe dominator?
