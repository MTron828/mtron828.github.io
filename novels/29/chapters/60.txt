Chapter 63: Undead Enslavement

The few of them quickly ran to the place where the distress signal had been sent. Very soon, they arrived at the forest outskirts near the slope. They heard the roars of beasts and strange, ear-piercing shrieks coming from inside. Occasional tremors were telltales of an intense battle being waged.

“Quick!” Fan Ganglie was the first to charge into the forest.

The forest was filled with strange trees, surrounded by a thick death aura; skeletons were scattered all over the place.

Lin Mokong was trying to run slower so that he could fall behind the group; that way he would be able to catch Su Ping unaware to take his revenge. However, he realized that Su Ping was running the slowest, on the verge to be left out of the protection of the group. He cursed the b*tch in his heart and could only accelerate.

Fan Yujing noticed that Su Ping was the slowest. He was puzzled. He didn’t know what he was thinking, so he lowered his speed to prevent Su Ping from being too far from the team. As a result, the team formation looked like a long line.

After Su Ping and Fan Yujing entered the forest, they saw a large patch of fallen trees. It was a clear sign of battle.

They followed the wake of destruction and ran deep into the forest. Soon, they saw Fan Ganglie, Lin Mokong, and the others. They were supporting two figures. A man and a woman from what they could see. There were a few pets guarding them, while other pets were fighting in front of them.

“Is that... an eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast?!”

Fan Yujing’s pupils were constricted when he saw the huge figure that the Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf had pounced at. He wore a look of horror.

The Magical Corpse Beast was around seven to eight meters tall. It was like a pile of bones and mountains of flesh lying on the ground. Its entire body was covered in nasty-looking bones. Sharp bone spears or huge arms were constantly emerging from the pile. The way the beast attacked was strange and unpredictable.

“Magical Corpse Beast?”

Su Ping was surprised to see the monster. He took a closer look at the skeleton’s body. A strange expression appeared in his eyes. It was as if... a chef were selecting the ingredients he liked.

At the same time, Little Skeleton’s consciousness was connected to his mind; the thoughts and emotions conveyed were filled with excitement and eagerness. It was extremely active.

Su Ping came back to his senses and comforted it. He followed Fan Yujing and moved closer to where Fan Ganglie and the others were.

“It’s an adult eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast!” Fan Ganglie’s expression was ugly. He even felt a tinge of regret for having rushed over. He turned to the two people beside him and said, “You two, if you have any pet that can fight, summon it. My Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf alone is no match for it.”

The man and woman were covered in wounds. It was obvious that they had gone through a fierce battle. The man smiled bitterly and said, “This is the only earth-shield pet I have left.”

“My Holy Flame Bird can still fight.” The woman bit her lip, her eyes full of unwillingness. A bird with golden feathers stood beside her. It was an eighth rank Holy Flame Bird. However, its feathers were in a mess; the flames were dim, and there was a ghastly wound close to the ribs on its chest that occasionally spilled golden blood.

Fan Ganglie couldn’t help but take another look at the bird. Even among the pets of the eighth rank, the bird was considered an extremely powerful existence. How could it end up in such a state?

As if he could see the confusion in Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong’s eyes, the man hesitated for a moment before revealing his true feelings. “This Magical Corpse Beast is not ordinary. It should be close to the advanced eighth-rank.”

“Close to the advanced eighth-rank?!” Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong’s pupils constricted due to the shock.

Li Ying and Fan Yujing were listening at the side; their faces paled in fright when they heard this. The two of them had already experienced a difficult situation in front of a seventh-rank Astral Pet demon beast, not to mention a monster of the eighth-rank. What a wicked gift!

Fan Ganglie came back to his senses and asked, “Only the two of you remain from the original team?”

The man said with a bitter smile, “We encountered another eighth-rank Bone Dragon on the way here. The group was separated. We might have had a chance to kill this thing if the entire team were here. It wouldn’t be as complicated, since we can’t even escape at the moment.”

“...”

Fan Ganglie and the others were speechless. What kind of luck was this?

Moreover, they had actually encountered two eighth-rank Astral Pets?

“Everyone, you...” The man hesitated for a moment, but he still took a deep breath and looked at the few present seriously. “Why not let your pets stay behind first? If we continue to fight with this thing, all of us will be left behind.”

Seeing Fan Ganglie and the others’ expressions change, the man quickly said, “After we leave, we will compensate you for your losses. We will also reward you. Ye Chenshan won’t go back on his word!”

“Ye Chenshan?” Fan Ganglie was about to fly into a rage when he heard the name. He was shocked. “You are Ye Chenshan?!”

Li Ying and Fan Yujing looked at him in shock. They were extremely familiar with this name.

“The Settler of the Golden Dragon Medal, Ye Chenshan?” Lin Mokong was stunned for a moment. His expression changed slightly.

“That’s right.” Ye Chenshan took out a Golden Dragon Medal from his bosom and took it back after giving them a glance. He said, “I hope that you can consider it. Time waits for no one. If we don’t leave now, I’m afraid that none of us will be able to leave.”

Fan Ganglie’s expression changed. He looked at the Bloodthirsty Demonic Wolves that were fighting with the Devil Bones in the distance. The wounds on the latter’s body gradually increased. Although the Vampiric Werewolf was a seventh-rank agile pet, it was helpless in front of the Devil Bones Beast. It was like a hedgehog that had nowhere to go. It could only rely on its agility to dodge to the left and right to barely stall the beast.

“All right!” He gritted his teeth and eventually agreed.

If he could get another Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf as compensation, it would make up for his loss. Most importantly, he could also obtain Ye Chenshan’s favor.

Ye Chenshan heaved a sigh of relief, but his expression soon changed before he continued speaking. A large number of skeletons suddenly crawled out from the surrounding ground, blocking their escape route.

“It’s the Undead Summoning!” Everyone had ugly expressions.

Just as they were about to command their pets to break out of the encirclement, the summoned skeletons suddenly moved to circle around them and rush toward the Magical Corpse Beast.

This scene stunned everyone.

“Captain, your pet has accompanied you for such a long time. It’s such a pity to abandon it like this,” Su Ping said.

Fan Ganglie was stunned. He could not help but look at Su Ping. Then, he thought of something and his eyes fell on Little Skeleton that stood beside him. Little Skeleton was emitting a rich dark energy that enveloped its body. At first glance, it looked like a mysterious existence shrouded in black mist.

“This Undead Summoning is yours?” Fan Ganglie was shocked. This was a high-level Undead Pet Skill. Judging from the size of the surroundings, it was obvious that it was extremely familiar with it. It was even more terrifying than an ordinary Undead Summoning!

Su Ping didn’t answer him. He was giving instructions to Little Skeleton to control the skeletons around him.

This was Little Skeleton’s ability. It was the Undead Enslavement. As long as there were skeletons around it, they could be directly enslaved. The strength of its ability depended on the number of skeletons around it. Of course, most of the skeletons were around the Magical Corpse Beast. If Little Skeleton’s spiritual power was strong enough, it could directly enslave it! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

That was because the Magical Corpse Beast was also an undead creature.

However, it was obvious that the Little Skeleton was only at the third rank. Although its spiritual power was far stronger than that of a third-rank creature, it was still too difficult to enslave an eighth-rank creature. It could only enslave a sixth-rank creature.
