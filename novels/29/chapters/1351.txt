Chapter 1353 Returning to the Celestial State (2)

Is that Brother Su’s universe?

Both Chi Huo and Xu Kong looked at the phenomenon happening above Su Ping’s head with shock in their eyes.

Although they too had universes, they deeply felt the vast difference between universes at that moment.

Compared to the young man’s universe… theirs were like balloons in front of a diamond.

Dense, magnificent, profound, ancient… All kinds of feelings made the two of them be in awe.

The next moment, a tremendous amount of power poured out of Su Ping’s universe and entered Shen Huang’s body through Su Ping’s hands.

The latter laid his hand on his master’s shoulder, and the pure power of chaos was transmitted continuously. It was the most ancient and pure power from the beginning of the universe.

Shen Huang had gotten in touch with the power of chaos before, but only a little bit from the Mysterious Realms of the universe; he stored it in his body and considered it a treasure. However, so much of that power was flowing into him that he felt as if he were in an ocean. He was shocked while feeling extremely comfortable.

“Hold your breath, focus your attention, relax your body, and feel the formation of the universe, especially the Great Dao inside it. This is a rare opportunity; it will be helpful for later, when you condense your Dao Heart.” Su Ping’s voice entered his master’s head.

.

Their roles seemed to have swapped at the moment. It was Su Ping teaching his master.

...

Shen Huang wasn’t bothered by it. He had already experienced a lot of things he had never experienced as a master with Su Ping as his disciple.

Shen Huang focused his attention as instructed. He felt that the power of chaos inside his body was concentrated by a great attraction force. The aura of Great Dao was instantly spreading out; it flew out of Su Ping’s universe of chaos and surrounded the man’s body.

Very soon, the interwoven Great Dao gradually compressed into the prototype of a universe. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Shen Huang devoted himself to the task and examined everything. He felt inexplicably shocked.

It was the first time for him to see how simple and beautiful it was to condense a universe.

All the Great Dao was founded, and, like a piece of artwork, the shape of the universe appeared.

Outside—Chi Huo and Xu Kong looked at Shen Huang and Su Ping who were enshrouded in breathtaking auras; they couldn’t help but step back, in case they were caught in it. The two of them felt more shocked as time passed; it was as if they were witnessing the birth of a star. The terrifying power was already taking shape inside Shen Huang’s body.

He really did it. The two of them were shocked. Su Ping was merely in the Ascendant State, let alone a Celestial; and yet, he had helped his master return to the Celestial State!

Genius wasn’t nearly enough to describe him. He was absolutely unpredictable and unimaginable!

“Condense!”

Su Ping’s voice echoed in Shen Huang’s head like the whisper of an ancient god coming from the void.

Instantly, all the powers in his body were quickly condensed as if heeding a command The core of a universe was gradually born. Then, as the power stretched out, the universe became bigger and bigger until it was fully constructed!

All the changes were visible to the naked eye. A powerful aura was constantly spreading out of the core of the new universe and filling Shen Huang’s body.

Power was surging with his body as the center. The extraordinary aura of the Celestial State was then revealed, coming from Shen Huang

His clone had finally advanced to the Celestial State!

Boom!

Thunder was rumbling in the sky above the building

At that moment-everybody milling about on the street couldn’t help but look up at the cloud-filled sky.

“It’s a Heavenly Tribulation!”

“He did it…”

Both Chi Huo and Xu Kong were shocked. Shen Huang had returned to the Celestial State. There were essentially three Celestial cultivators on their side. Adding Kayafollet and Ye Chen who was imprisoned by Su Ping, there would be five Celestial State cultivators. It was almost half of all the Celestial cultivators of the universe.

.

“Is anyone undergoing a Heavenly Tribulation?”

“Who is it? I can’t even see the boundary. Is someone rising to the Ascendant State?”

Everybody on the street was whispering.

The dark clouds filled the sky above the street and covered the whole city.

However, upon seeing it from a higher perspective, one would discover that the Heavenly Tribulation didn’t just cover the city, but also the entire continent, and even the whole planet!

Lightning bolts were also surging in the void outside the planet, which gradually turned red from their original purple.

“A Bloody Tribulation!”

“It’s a Bloody Tribulation. Shen Huang didn’t invoke a Bloody Tribulation back then!”

Chi Huo was rather shocked. Not only is Shen Huang returning to the Celestial State, but he will be even stronger?

Xu Kong was also shocked and speechless. Their senses spread beyond the universe, allowing them to look down on that planet like a god would. Then, they saw that the planet was surrounded by lightning bolts where redness surged and hopped now and then.

Su Ping opened his eyes and removed his hand from his master’s shoulder. Magnificent auras were surging out of the latter’s body. The work was done; his master had to pass the Heavenly Tribulation on his own.

Shen Huang also opened his eyes, which were glittering, as if they could pierce through stones. Shen Huang found the Celestial State power he had been missing as he felt the unparalleled aura inside his body.

What excited him was that this power was even greater than before. He thought he was imagining things.

“A Bloody Tribulation?”

Shen Huang sensed the Heavenly Tribulation enshrouding him, and felt that something majestic was staring at him. He then took a deep breath and examined the new universe in his body, knowing it wasn’t a dream. He had truly embarked on another road, which was even more terrifying!

Such a road was established by Su Ping, just for him!

“Su Ping, can I resist this Heavenly Tribulation?” Shen Huang looked at Su Ping who stood by his side.

Su Ping looked at him encouragingly. “No problem. I got you.”

“Okay.”

Shen Huang felt reassured. He laughed and proudly rose to the sky, enduring the lightning strikes coming from the void.

While standing inside the building, Su Ping watched quietly and gradually started to frown. He discovered that there seemed to be a crack deep inside the lightning bolt cluster; all the power of the Heavenly Tribulation came from that point.

He had never seen such crack before. However, he was now able to see a lot of things that he couldn’t after entering the Original Dao World.

Is that a crack in the universe? Is the Heavenly Tribulation coming from a place beyond the universe?

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

Lightning struck at that moment. Shen Huang performed his Celestial State skills and fought the Heavenly Tribulation, roaring.

The lightning bolts struck one after the other, until a series of terrifying, bloody lightning bolts—that seemed to be slashing the planet apart-reached down. However, Shen Huang blocked them with his weapons and secret treasures.

Since he recovered his cultivation, Shen Huang was able to use his former weapons.

All the dispersing power of the Heavenly Tribulation was erased by Su Ping. None of it caused damage to the planet.

Both Chi Huo and Xu Kong looked at Shen Huang nervously. After all, it was a dangerous Bloody Tribulation and there was nothing they could do to help. The tribulation would only grow stronger if they intervened.

A long while later

The lighting bolts gradually disappeared. In midair-Shen Huang was clad in ragged clothes, painting a miserable sight. There were bloody wounds on his body, making him look like a beggar, and he also seemed to be exhausted.

However, an exuberant aura rose from his body after the tribulation started to fade away, like mushrooms after the rain. A dazzling light was emanated by his body, and his ragged clothes were gone. His skin formed a layer of golden armor that made him look like a glowing god.

“He did it!”

The two friendly Celestials were greatly relieved, and quite envious too.

Both of them sensed that Shen Huang was clearly stronger than before. In particular, his newly formed universe was floating above his head like the sun, imposing pressure from a long distance away. They even suspected that they wouldn’t be able to defeat him in a head-on clash, even though he had just returned to the Celestial State.

The crack is gone.

Su Ping gazed at the depths of the Heavenly Tribulation. The crack transmitting the power was gone after the clouds dispersed. Nothing seemed to have appeared in the void; there were no signs left over.
