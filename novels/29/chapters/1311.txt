“Chen Xi lost? To someone from a mere middle-ranked clan?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“The prince from one of the seven greatest families was defeated by a young human named Su Ping and took his Dao Child title.”

“A human? Who is it? Never heard of the fellow.”

“Young Master, you’ve never left the continent; it’s only natural that you wouldn’t know anything about him. Humans aren’t active on this continent; their clan is barely middle-ranked.”

News of the Dao Child was spread across the world, receiving the attention of many forces and clans.

“I really want to find out what the guy who defeated Chen Xi looks like,” whispered a prince from one of the seven greatest clans.

“Su Ping? The person wanted by the Rain Clan a while back?”

“Humans are on a roll!”

As word was spread out, Su Ping and humans as a whole gained popularity throughout the world.

There were a billion races in the Archean Divinity, and hundreds of thousands of middle-ranked clans. Humans didn’t stand out much among them; they were just one of the many vassal clans to a high-ranked clan. Many gods had yet to know about them.

Toad Fish Palace—Heaven Path Institute.

A person emerged from the side palace and slowly opened his eyes. He was none other than Su Ping, who had just been woken up in the middle of his cultivation.

......

Time flew. In the proverbial blink of an eye, he cultivated for more than a year in Chan Gong’s universe and deciphered another one and half natural Dao Glyphs. His combat ability had significantly increased yet again.

Once seeing Chan Gong nearby, Su Ping instantly realized why he was summoned.

“It’s been ten days; the succession ritual will be held today. Aside from the students, several important figures from many organizations will also attend.”

Chan Gong added with a smile, “They’re partly here to take a look at you, and partly to present you with some offers. The institute allows for students to join other organizations, as long as they don’t embarrass their alma mater.”

He glanced at Su Ping and said, “Considering your potential, I personally suggest that you don’t bind yourself to those forces. You may want to consider if any of them grants you privileges without restricting you too much; after all, you’ll have more training resources and your progress will be faster.”

Su Ping had seen it coming, and was slightly intrigued. He couldn’t stay in the Archean Divinity forever; he probably could ask one of those forces to look out for humanity if he joined any.

“I’ll consider it,” said Su Ping.

Chan Gong nodded and led Su Ping out of the side palace. They went to the institute’s main hall.

The place was on the peak of the Three Gods Mountain, which looked like three fingers. They were, in fact, three fingers. Legend had it that they were the severed fingers of an Ancestral God. The mighty expert never healed the injury, all for some sort of promise; he left his fingers there.

With time, they eventually became the Three Gods Mountain from the Heaven Path Institute.

The mountain was extremely high and majestic, large enough to accommodate all the students in the academy. The building had overlapping and chaotic spaces; anyone sneaking in without any direction would end up getting lost; even God Kings would be helpless.

Many figures were gathered in the main hall; they were the students of many races in the Heaven Path Institute.

Besides them, there were also a lot of powerful auras moving along with the elders of the institute. They were important figures from various forces.

Chan Gong and Su Ping attracted a lot of attention once they arrived. Everyone fixed their gazes upon Su Ping right then.

The young human seemed unfazed by the myriad of eyes on him, including the intimidating sight of some God Emperors. He quietly landed on the ceremonial platform with Elder Chan.

It was a lofty ceremonial platform which carried an ancient vibe. There were even Dao Glyphs engraved on the stone.

“He’s indeed young and extraordinary!”

“Quite poised. His vitality… And he’s only lived a hundred years?”

Someone probed in secret; they were shocked by Su Ping’s vitality.

The man became a Dao Child in a hundred years?

Such talent was rare, even within the whole scope of the godly world.

Many were quick to conclude that the trip was well worth it, and they hoped to talk about cooperating, since he would definitely be a future star.

It was easier and more valuable to impress geniuses early in the game.

After all, some favors were considered priceless.

On the ceremonial platform-Su Ping found Chen Xi in a certain direction.

The man was at the moment wearing a black robe adorned with rare materials mixed with Dao Glyphs and divine arrays. It wasn’t just beautiful, but also a powerful weapon.

He was also wearing a crown. Based on the style, both items appeared to be a set.

The two of them looked at each other. Chen Xi gave Su Ping a slight nod, keeping a peaceful expression.

He thought it was fair to have been defeated by Su Ping

He had been reflecting during the past ten days. There would always be a hint of instinctual fear in his heart every time he thought of Su Ping.

He didn’t know the reason. He searched through his memories and couldn’t find the answer; he had to ask a God Emperor of his clan to help him get rid of the trauma.

He was again able to keep a cool and emotionless demeanor when he met Su Ping again.

Su Ping had no personal grudges against Chen Xi. Once they exchanged greetings he looked at the other two people who were also wearing divine robes. One of them was tall; half of his hair was black while the other was white. Likewise, his eyes were black and white respectively. He was emitting a hazy and mysterious aura.
