Chapter 1090: Hostile Alliance

Translator: Henyee TranslationsEditor: Henyee Translations

Wanyan Shuang’s expression changed a bit as she saw Su Ping return peacefully; now her eyes showed solemnity.

Shuai Qianhou raised his eyebrows ever so slightly, and cursed ‘garbage’ in his heart, shaking his head.

‘There was no telling whether he was cursing Su Ping, or the recently departed Ye Ling.

“Let’s go,” said Su Ping. He chuckled, as if having just thrown a piece of trash in the dumpster.

Loulan Lin and the others were stunned, not expecting Ye Ling—the former third place of the Divine Lord Rank—to be killed that easily, without being able to put up any resistance. It was almost a slaughter.

One had to remember that Su Ping was only in the Star State!

Is this what the special guest of our family is capable of? Loulan Jue was shocked. He had originally felt affronted when the best cultivation seat was given away to Su Ping, but he was completely awed at the moment.

‘The three of them had definitely been unable to escape from Ye Ling; it was evident that the gap between them and Su Ping was countless Ye Lings.

Loulan Lin bit her lip while staying silent.

Everybody came out of the deep space after he spoke.

‘They stayed on the top of a mountain. Shuai Qianhou asked, “Senior Brother Su, are you going to continue traveling?”

“Let’s just wait here,” said Su Ping.

‘Wanyan Shuang was puzzled. “Aren’t you going to look for tokens?”

“Tokens…” Shuai Qianhou smiled and opened his hands, showing seven tokens that looked like purple crystals. He tossed them and said, “The lake will be peaceful if all the bait is gone.”

Wanyan Shuang and Loulan Lin could hardly take their eyes away.

Seven tokens!

They soon realized that the Celestial expert had probably given them some information!

‘Taking sides with the Celestials was truly rewarding; no wonder a genius as Shuai Qianhou had also bowed down.

After a moment of silence, Wanyan Shuang said, “I heard that the Celestial expert left some treasures here. You must have…”

Yu Jingze chuckled and replied, “That’s right.”

Su Ping, however, didn’t show the stone shield. He and Shuai Qianhou were keeping the treasure and the tokens separately.

‘The treasure was more important than the tokens. After all, there were 170 tokens, and only twelve ultimate treasures.

“We’re just going to wait here and do nothing?” asked Wanyan Shuang. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Diaz chuckled and said in a low voice, “If you’re bored, have some water.”

‘Wanyan Shuang glanced at him. You think you’re funny?

Everybody was silent for a moment.

Su Ping looked at Loulan Lin and the others, then asked curiously, “Why did your family send you here? This place is too dangerous. You could have been easily killed, don’t you think?”

They were speechless.

But, there were only 170 tokens in total; the truly difficult part of the test hadn’t yet begun. Even she wasn’t confident of passing it, let alone carrying a few burdens.

However, she simply kept quiet since Shuai Qianhou didn’t say anything.

It only struck her as curious, that Shuai Qianhou was exceptionally tolerant when it came to dealing with Su Ping.

“Mr. Su, we are eternally in your debt,” Loulan Jue and Loulan Hai quickly said. Both were deeply touched. Even though Su Ping was only returning a favor, it was indeed remarkable that he would generously do so during that competition.

It was obvious that the more people participated in the following tests, the less likely he would win the legacy!

Loulan Lin bit her lip and kept silent. She even thought that she would give the legacy to Su Ping if she won!

It was an outlandish thought, but it did roll in her heart for a while. She knew that she was still far away from seeing the legacy, and the chances for it to happen were very slim.

Time flew.

In other places—fights and battles were happening everywhere.

Diaz and the others checked their watches now and then, eager to find out when the central continent would open.

The central continent would only be accessible until the third day of the trial.

‘That was the second day.

Considering their combat abilities, they could have circled the continent ten times in two days!

Some people passed by during those days, but they fled and kept their distance the moment they detected Su Ping and his team.

Even though they were certain that Shen Huang’s disciples carried tokens, nobody had dared to rob them. After all, Su Ping’s team had the advantage of numbers.

While basking in sunlight, Shuai Qianhou remarked while staring at the distance, “It’s getting close.”

He rose and put on a vague smile.

Diaz and the others became vigilant too. All of them sat up and gathered.

“A lot of people have passed by and escaped in the past couple of days. Some of them keep staring at us from a distance. All the survivors will probably show up soon.” Yu Jingze was quite solemn.

‘That was the moment of truth; the final chance to choose from among the things they had picked.

‘They never concealed their auras or hid themselves, because they were waiting for other survivors.

It was much better than actively looking for them. Still, it could also be dangerous!

Su Ping looked around with blinking eyes.

“Now that you’re here, stop hiding yourselves. Just come on out!” Shuai Qianhou chuckled, but his voice echoed throughout the sky. The next moment… The void shook, as if someone were drumming in the void.

Soon after, a lot of people were pushed out of the void. Some were injured, but some stepped out rather elegantly.

Many of them emerged from deeper spaces and proudly stood in the sky. There were almost three hundred of them!

Diaz and the others wore solemn expressions.

Too many!

They had expected an alliance, but not such a big one!
