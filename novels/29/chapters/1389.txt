Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I think I know one of the Sorcerer Ancestors.”

Su Ping remembered the Golden Crow ancestor, who was one of the strongest existences in the world.

“Bloodlines of mythical creatures, a body of chaos… You must be from one of the remnant tribes…” mumbled the corpse in frustration, “Your universe was destroyed by the Heavens despite being protected by a Sorcerer Ancestor?”

Su Ping immediately realized the misunderstanding; the guy thought that there was actually a Sorcerer Ancestor in his universe. He shook his head and said, “I met the Sorcerer Ancestor in another universe. The Heavens never found them and they’re now living in seclusion…”

He suddenly got to think about how the Golden Crows chose to hide from the Heavens despite having their ancestor protecting them. If he did find the Golden Crows on his trip, would they join forces with him?

They had been hiding for far too long. Would they reveal themselves if he invited them?

His heart became heavy at the thought.

The corpse was silent for a moment, then said, “The Sorcerer Ancestor hides, and the Heavens are rampant. The unfinished battle will be resumed; however, we won’t live to see that moment. Young friend, if you’re still alive by then, we hope that our power will be of help to you.”

“Senior, this is the first time we’ve met. You’ve survived the burning of the Heavenly Fire for so long. Why not carry on?” Su Ping wasn’t yearning for the expert’s power. Rather, he hoped the guy would fight alongside him.

The corpse chuckled in a low voice and said, “We’ve failed already, and were imprisoned by the Heavenly Fire. They want to wear out our willpower and have us bend. It’s just wishful thinking; we can carry on, but it’s pointless. Our power will be exhausted for nothing.”

After a pause, he continued, “Although it’s the first time we’ve met and you’re not from my clan, we are newly met comrades facing the Heavens race. Don’t decline my offer.”

Su Ping was stunned.

Newly met comrades?

That short phrase struck a nerve deep inside his mind.

Su Ping was silent for a moment. He then said, “I appreciate your kindness, senior, but I’ve found my own Dao Heart and I hope to walk my own path. Senior, you’ll probably see the dawn in 100,000 years’ time if you carry on.”

“Young friend, you are a proud man.” The corpse chuckled with admiration in his tone.?This guy was not tempted by our power’s legacy, showing resolve and confidence that none of the juniors we knew ever had.

“Young friend, don’t worry; we won’t let you repeat our path. We’re only giving whatever power is left to you. As a matter of fact, only one tenth remains… Our only hope is that it’ll be of some help to you. We’ll be more than gratified if you fight and kill some of the Heavens,” said the corpse.

Su Ping stopped declining the offer, given the latter’s persistence. He could feel the faith conveyed by the expert, hoping he would continue the battle on his behalf.

“Young friend, be ready!”

The corpse wasted no time in handing out the legacy. Hardly had he finished the thought when the Heavenly Fire on the body burned with increased ferocity. The temperature in the void soared; however, there was nothing left to be burnt or destroyed.

An abundant and overwhelming power was slowly emitted by the body, as if a silent universe were quickly recovering. Su Ping felt that the corpse before him was suddenly coming back to life. Its aura was so terrifying that it gave him a shock.?Is this an Ancestral God? Even if he’s dead, his remaining thoughts and power still carries this much momentum?

Although he had already seen Ancestral Gods in cultivation sites, like the Chaos Perception Dragon, his feelings were different each time.

“What happened?”

The Celestials noticed the changes in the body and felt shocked.

“That corpse seems to be coming back to life!” shouted someone fearfully. The body alone was extremely terrifying; it was like a god in their eyes.

The Heavenly Fire remaining on the body started to ebb; the white flames seemed to be absorbed. However, the fire had a persistent nature, so it didn’t disappear completely; it was attached to the surface of the body like a layer of white hairs. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The enormous corpse started to move slowly, as if getting back to its feet. The next moment, deep red light appeared in the body’s eyes as it gazed at the world through the darkness.

Su Ping was like an ant before an elephant, extremely small.

A magnificent burst of thought and power was suddenly emitted; the corpse showed the might of an Ancestral God. Even though it was already dead and there were only thought remnants, its horrific presence was still obvious at the dusk of its life.

“Young friend, since you’ve found your Dao Heart, I’ll help you condense it. That way you’ll approach our level sooner,” said the corpse’s thought.

Right after the telepathic message, an abundant power surged and enveloped Su Ping.

The latter felt that he was in the middle of pouring rain. The tremendous power surging into his body shocked him.?Was it only one tenth of the corpse’s total power??He felt he was drowning in a terrifying ocean of energy, which was dozens of times more than his body contained!

Su Ping felt that his body was mutating quickly as the power was transferred.

“Young friend, you have a very special body structure. Is it because of your cultivation technique? It’s truly amazing…” whispered the corpse. While giving away his power, he also sensed the structure in Su Ping’s body and the star-made Astral Paintings, as well as the power contained in those stars. He realized why Su Ping’s aura was so powerful, even though his level was low.
