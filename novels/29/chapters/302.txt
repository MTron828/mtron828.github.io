Chapter 303 Overpowering an Entire Family!

This shock was akin to a magnitude 12 earthquake. Buildings shook and walls cracked within a few miles of the place where the pet fell. Some houses that were closer to the battle site collapsed as the ground caved in. Dust was flying everywhere. On the ground, the body of the pet of the wind family was motionless. The cut had lopped off its head, which rolled away. The head was still ferocious, but the eyes had become dull and dark.

A ninth-rank pet had died!

The others who were looking at ground level had been silenced by fear.

In the air.

No one saw this, but when the pet of the wind family was falling, a tiny black figure was running upward along the pet’s body!

After the black figure reached the tail, it flashed and disappeared once more! The entrance closed behind him.

Zhou Feng’s wind pet had just slammed against the ground; he was still out of sorts when he suddenly felt a coldness spreading across his body.

In front of him, out of nowhere, came out a skeleton that was surrounded by a surging evil aura.

This Little Skeleton held a bloody bone blade in its hand. This bone blade was like a fragment of a fang with an ugly structure, but an unusually creepy aura.

No—!

In a fit of terror and fright, Zhou Feng wanted to open his mouth and shout and yet the sound only remained in his mind.

With a puff sound, once again, blood was spilled in the sky. Zhou Feng was cut in two. But the strange thing was, the bone blade that slashed him apart seemed to have some strong pull that made the body stick to the blade.

There seemed to be a strange force field around the dead body. Because of the force field, the dead body was shaking constantly. Then, it suddenly turned into a pile of ashes, which then transformed into some red energy that seeped back into the bone blade.

Some blood dried up and was absorbed by the seemingly mundane bone blade!

All that happened within one breath. At the moment, only one skeleton was standing in the air.

A titled battle pet warrior that was well-known across the region had perished! “No...!”

The aged man who was hurrying over came to a stop. He witnessed everything. He could not believe what had just happened in front of his eyes. How could he process the fact that Zhou Feng could have died within such a short time? His pet was also killed!

Zhou Feng was a titled battle pet warrior!

How could he have died so soon?!

Staring at the skeleton with the evil energy floating around it, the aged man felt even his heart was pounding in fear. He was a bit stronger than Zhou Feng but he couldn’t confidently say he could have killed Zhou Feng that easily.

Staring at the evil aura that was still spreading out from the Little Skeleton, the aged man shouted in haste, “Please stop. Please. Let’s talk.” His eyes were on the Little Skeleton while his words were for the young man because he was the Little Skeleton’s master.

Su Ping raised his head slightly. “Are you the family head? The Zhou family sent someone to destroy the reputation of my store and try to stir up a fight between me and the Liu family. Now, who among you should be held accountable for this?”

The aged man finally understood why the young man was there. Inwardly, the aged man was smiling bitterly. You came to our door and killed Zhou Feng. Now you’re asking who should be held accountable...

Frustrated as he was, the aged man answered at once, “No rush. I’m not the family head but I will give you a satisfactory reply regarding what you have just mentioned.”

At the moment, the aged man knew that no amount of denial or stalling would do him any good. He couldn’t find any excuses. The young man was right there, insisting on getting an answer. He wouldn’t be easily fooled and sent off with some bureaucratic words.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. “If so, then tell your family head to come here, or get me the one responsible for that plan. Otherwise, I will kill all your titled battle pet warriors who come at me, one by one!”

The aged man’s expressions shifted.

The same thing happened to all the warriors of the Zhou Army who were gathered in the area. All of them were elite disciples of the Zhou family. They could never stand this arrogant tone!

You would kill those titled battle pet warriors one by one?!

What? Do you think that titled battle pet warriors are easy targets, like rabbits?

Of course, given the fact that the wind pet’s corpse was still there and that Zhou Feng had just passed away... Furious as they were, none of them dared to stand up and refute Su Ping’s claim.

This young man was insufferably arrogant!

The elderly man finally calmed himself down and asked, “How do I address you, sir?”

“However you like.”

“...Sir, how about you wait here. I will go and bring that man here to you. This has been just a big misunderstanding...” the elderly man said hurriedly.

“Sure.” Su Ping gave his approval.

The elderly man was relieved that Su Ping did not continue with this killing spree. At the same time, the old man’s hatred toward Su Ping deepened. He darted one final look to that dangerous skeleton before he turned away and hurried off.

After the elderly man left, more and more people went to this area. The Zhou Army had the entire area surrounded. There were at least hundreds of them. They were accompanied by their pets, some of which were huge beasts and some were flying. At the moment, they were standing around Su Ping, keeping an eye out for any sudden moves he might make.

Other than those warriors, other members of the Zhou family had made an appearance. Some hopped onto the roofs and watched from the distance, and there were a few young people that were using telescopes to check out the situation.

This battle had alerted the entire Zhou family!

People that had been resting, chatting, or cultivating at home went there to see, following the previous loud noises. Everyone seemed to be stunned because they never thought anyone would have the courage to create trouble in the Zhou family territory.

This was the Zhou family. They were in a place where countless powerful warriors of the Zhou family lived. This person who broke in was courting death!

Some young people were mixed in the crowd of onlookers.

When they saw the young person standing on the head of the Purple Python, one of the young people cried out in alarm, “Isn’t that... Mr. Su of the Pixie Pet Store?”

“Mr. Su?” Someone who heard asked in confusion.

The first young person didn’t answer this question because he had yet to recover from his shock. He was Zhou Chuan, who had once visited Su Ping’s store and even thought of buying the Top 10 service. He could, not for the life of him, imagine that Mr. Su-whom he deemed as ordinary, and who would sit behind the counter all day long-could break into the Zhou family territory and alert so many people!

Su Ping was surrounded by the warriors of the Zhou family. This scene had astounded Zhou Chuan. How horrifying must Su Ping be, to be able to shock the entire Zhou family all by himself!

He would find it more understandable if it were some titled battle pet warrior that had established his fame a long time ago. But this was not Su Ping’s case. Zhou Chuan had talked with Su Ping in person and he always thought the latter was a kind man, without any traits that a powerful warrior should display. Zhou Chuan had never been aware that Su Ping would be capable of such horrors!

If Su Ping were to participate in the Elite League, he would have the ability to win the international championship!

Then again, with such abilities, Su Ping probably didn’t care about that kind of victory... Zhou Chuan told himself.

Su Ping would look at the warriors that came swarming toward him and the onlookers from the corners of his eye. Frowning, he kept on counting the seconds.

Several minutes had passed and his patience was running out. All of a sudden, four people came flying over. They traveled across space and arrived next to Su Ping with a stunning presence. The four lowered themselves down a bit till they were forty to fifty meters above ground so that they could look down on Su Ping. The middle-aged man standing in the middle didn’t demonstrate his full strength but the sharpness in his eyes could not be hidden. Coldly, he gazed at Su Ping. “Sir, you have broken into our territory for no reason at all. How rude!”

Su Ping raised his eyebrows and squinted his eyes. “What are you saying? It is the Zhou family that offended me first. Now, are you saying that you’re unwilling to turn that person over to me?”.

“Hmm, stop fussing around. You have hurt our people and you shall pay with your life!” The middle-aged man snorted. He didn’t do anything, but three giant swirls had appeared around him.

Sharp claws or tentacles reached out from the massive, pitch dark swirls. Soon, three large and violent figures crawled out.

Those were three battle pets at the ninth rank. Two were at the upper position and one was at the peak! The owner was the current family head of the Zhou family, Zhou Tianlin!

As the three battle pets presented themselves in front of the crowd, the overwhelming sense slowly seeped across the area. Even warriors of the Zhou Army had the urge to withdraw, unable to stand this pressure.

Coldness flickered in Su Ping’s eyes.

Before he came here, he had anticipated that the Zhou family would probably be unwilling to give up that person. Therefore, he decided to go there himself so that he would catch the Zhou family off guard, in case they would initiate any follow-up plans after they found out that Sun Qiu had failed his mission. This was why Su Ping insisted on going there on this very day!

Su Ping wanted to test the old man’s reaction when he had Zhou Feng killed. Su Ping had thought that he would find his target without having to start a killing spree.

He didn’t know that the old man just went to get more help.

Now that they had the chance, four titled battle pet warriors arrived and they were enough to defeat and end Su Ping’s life.

Yet again, as it turned out, people would need to learn about the truth when the pain was felt to the very depths of their souls! “Life?”

Su Ping grinned. “Give me your life first, then!”

Killing intent and violence slowly emerged in his pitch-dark eyes. Su Ping didn’t go through so many deaths in the cultivation sites so that he would grow a merciful heart!

Kill!

That was his instruction to the Little Skeleton.

The Little Skeleton was standing quietly in the sky. Suddenly, the scarlet glow in its eye sockets shone brightly!

This scarlet color was turning into two red lights that shot through the sky! The ancient and strong demon energy oozed out little by little, from the Little Skeleton’s blood, from its soul, from its bones, and at that moment, the entire sky changed color!

An aura that was close to that of a god and a demon slowly floated out.

The three huge pets that Zhou Tianlin had just summoned were encircling him. At this very moment, the violence was receding from their eyes; fear took over. With their acute perception, they had picked up something extremely dangerous from that insignificant tiny skeleton. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

That was the murderous intent that was directed at every living being!

How terrifying that was!

The three pets trembled as they stepped backward slowly. None of them was courageous enough to confront their opponent!

Their panic was also transmitted to their master’s consciousness in an instant through the contracts. When he sensed the panic from his pets, Zhou Tianlin, whose eyes were full of killing intent, was taken aback. In his eyes, the killing intent died down. He could not believe that his pets would be frightened.

At the same time, he also felt an unusual chill, which grew stronger and stronger, and soon he figured out where the sense of danger came from.
