Chapter 1416 Emperor Among Kings (1)

A beautiful head flew up, but a hand grabbed it before it flew away.

“You…” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The beautiful Godly Empress had been beheaded, but she was still alive; her soul lingered nearby. She looked at Su Ping in fear. What just happened?

“God Emperors are just so so.”

Su Ping, on the other hand, remained casual. “Our power is supposed to be on the same level, yet your performance is downright disappointing.”

Illusions were able to construct a world. The path of illusion grasped by Su Ping was very powerful to begin with. Even before he attained his Dao Heart, the path of illusion could have been easily broken by other God Emperors, because their attacks contained many other traits. They could easily obliterate, burn or corrupt the path of illusion.

But ever since he grasped his Contract Dao Heart, besides harnessing the ultimate Great Dao, he could make use of powers from all different kinds of Great Daos. He could disintegrate his enemy’s Great Dao. That was where the path of illusion played a major part.

The beautiful Empress would have only been able to resist it if she had a good grasp of the path of illusions too, which was clearly not the case.

“You deserve to die. Do you think I can be so easily…”

The beautiful senior was furious. She could obviously sense how strange and troublesome the young man’s Great Dao was. But she had seen it in action; she could eventually crack it, given enough time.

Power surged on her neck, and her headless body charged with the sword again. Still, before she could finish, she was surrounded by an overwhelming power, and then her head disappeared from Su Ping’s hand.

“These eyes of yours are quite useful. I’ll see if I can transplant them to my pet later.” Su Ping casually sealed her head deep inside his universe of chaos. He then shook his head ever so slightly as he saw the headless body charging toward him, then summoned a ball of Heavenly Fire in his hand, to send it her way.

The fire was cut apart by the sword aura. However, it seemed to be intelligent, as it continued moving toward her.

Very soon, the beautiful powerhouse’s body was set ablaze along with her dress, which produced strange screams. It seemed that the garment’s soul was crying.

Her neck slowly grew a new head, but it was bloody and hideous because of the fire.

Su Ping sent another slash. Suddenly-a spear appeared out of nowhere and was rushing to stab Su Ping’s throat. The ferocious spear was like a sharp meteor, making the young man feel that his throat was already in pain, even though it was endless time and space away.

He slashed backwards. There was a boom, and the time within a hundred years shattered, making chaotic currents; people would see the cracks there in the hundred years to come.

“So, you’re the cause of the unexpected change I saw eight thousand years ago!” An old emperor of the Rain Clan became cold. He wandered in time, alternating his cultivation between the past and the future. Eight thousand years before, he caught sight of the turbulence caused by a power outside of the Rain Clan. He knew it was the result of a battle, and inferred that it was at the emperor level.

He had then forewarned the Rain Emperor, asking him to look for potential opponents.

However, he knew it was a difficult task, since it involved emperors.

Such powerhouses had access to the Original Dao World and could hide themselves from the world. They could erase their traces in time and space, making it impossible to be tracked down.

Even so, the Rain Clan had been keeping a close eye on all the hostile clans over the years.

However, no one would have ever guessed that the scene would be caused by a God King. Furthermore, the time of the battle was not eight thousand years later, but slightly ahead of schedule, all due to the aftermath destroying the time that followed.

The Rain Emperor looked awful. Su Ping suddenly rose to prominence, growing at a blinding speed. None of them would have thought that the foretold catastrophe would be caused by that human.

He had asked the Witch Mountain for support, thinking it was enough to end things, but Su Ping was still alive. Lin Tianzhan realized what the Rain Emperor was thinking. He coldly said, “The future has many variations. It’s useless to look ahead, unless you’re looking at mortals whose entire lives are predictable. The future of the great and the talented are never certain; you mustn’t delve too deep and seriously. However, all changes in nature are fixed, unless someone purposefully tampers with them! It’s not your fault that you failed to finish him off. However, he must die today!”

The Rain Emperor nodded slightly, but he was secretly alarmed. To think that the old chief would be able to read him like a book after so many years.

“Rot in hell!”

A God Emperor who was holding the spear charged at Su Ping furiously. After seeing that he had defeated two God Emperors in a row, they knew he wouldn’t be easily suppressed. And so, all of them attacked together.

Aside from that expert, Emperor Gui and the ones who activated the Four Emperors’ Blood Array were too charging at full speed.

The world instantly became turbulent, and Su Ping was caught in an energy storm. Unusual phenomena of the Great Dao could be seen, while small universes were being manifested. It was like the beginning of chaos.

Yan Qing and the other elders changed their expressions; they immediately ran to offer aid. However, the Rain Emperor had been paying attention to them. He rushed to stop them the moment they acted, unfolding his small universe, then he said with a freezing tone, “You indulged your Dao Child to commit murder. Are you going to continue endorsing him? It is true that the Heaven Path Institute has a special status and all clans respect you, that doesn’t mean that you can act wilfully to step on others!”
