Chapter 933: Dual Merging

The second battle was between Diaz and Lilian.

This fight also received a lot of attention. Diaz used his strength at the very beginning of the battle, intending to win it as quickly as possible.

However, something weird happened after he performed Reincarnation Deprivation on Lilian. She remained in a half-beast mode, not separating from her pet.

In addition, Lilian’s power wasn’t weakened or diminished.

Lilian quickly counterattacked while resisting the God Killing Spear, eventually defeating Diaz.

Everybody had expected a fierce battle, but it surprisingly ended in merely three minutes.

Many people looked at the girl in shock.

“She’s immune to Reincarnation Deprivation. What kind of ability is that?”

“She doesn’t seem to have a divine constitution. Could it be another unknown top constitution?”

Someone had realized the reason in shock. “Wait, her constitution isn’t unknown, it’s just that hers is a top demon constitution, except that…”

She didn’t separate from her pet, which meant that the change of her body hadn’t been caused by merging; after all, nobody had seen her summon her pet. Everyone had thought she had already merged with it before the battle started.

However, it was quite obvious that her beastly appearance had been caused by her ability.

This meant that she defeated Diaz without using pets, grabbing one of the top three spots!

She was another monster!

Lilian received everyone’s attention.

Her immunity to Reincarnation Deprivation also gave food for thought.

“I…”

Diaz was dumbfounded due to his failure, feeling that he would almost choke with blood.

His original estimation was that he would become the resplendent champion. However, he was defeated back in his star zone, and then suffered consecutive setbacks at the finals.

Sure enough, it was one of the four supreme laws…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. Another person besides Six Lives Buddha had grasped one of the four supreme laws, and it was domineering.

The girl had actually grasped the law of destruction.

Reincarnation Deprivation was destroyed by her law. As far as Su Ping knew, the law of destruction could destroy all the other laws and bring forth new lives, which was similar to the renewal ability that Diaz was capable of; her own astral power could be destroyed and regenerated all the time!

Destruction and vitality, being two supreme laws, had a lot in common.

The destruction of something meant the birth of something else—

Just like the result of burning a house wasn’t “nothingness”, but “a dilapidated house.”

By burning a tree, one would gain “ash.”

The same applied to vitality.

The birth of something meant the destruction of something else.

“Mastering a supreme law is as extraordinary as to have one of the nine divine constitutions!

“Divine constitutions are something you’re born with!

“However, it takes your own power of understanding to grasp laws.”

Without a doubt, although the girl’s constitution wasn’t as good as Diaz’s, it was still easy for her to crush him with the supreme law she knew.

Lilian looked at Six Lives Buddha after leaving the void battlefield.

Both of them had grasped a supreme law among all the top ten players, while neither of the two had a divine constitution. Lilian considered Six Lives Buddha as her major enemy in the coming phase.

Six Lives Buddha also had a grim look. He had obviously not expected to find that someone else had grasped a supreme law.

If they were to fight, the one with the deepest understanding of the law would win.

It would be impossible for him to make use of the path of time and space if his opponent could destroy the time he grasped and transform space into something beyond his control.

There are more and more interesting guys.

Luo Ying narrowed his eyes and put on an eager smile.

The third battle began while people whispered amongst themselves.

The observers fell silent upon hearing the Ascendant announcer. The third battle was a clash between two experts!

Su Ping, who had defeated Diaz, was not to be underestimated.

Six Lives Buddha, on the other hand, was able to summon his future self; he had a clear shot to become the champion, and was the strongest contestant thus far!

The monk withdrew his gaze from Lilian and looked at Su Ping, becoming gentle and casual again, just like when he fought Dragon Shepard earlier on.

On the battlefield—

“I’m indeed curious about your divine constitution, sir,” said the monk with a smile, “Could you tell me what it’s called? I only want to know the name.”

“I’ll tell you after you lose,” Su Ping replied, smiling back.

The monk was stunned for a moment; he then offered a more friendly smile and said, “You’re very confident, sir; however, I’m going to win. I hope you won’t try too hard, or hurt your pets like Dragon Shepard did. This is not me preaching from a higher moral ground; it’s just a friendly reminder.”

“I know,” Su Ping smiled and replied, “You’re very concerned about pets, which is better than most people in my books.”

The monk said, “Pets are our partners. We should take care of them.”

“That is correct.”

Su Ping nodded too.

All the onlookers were dazed, seeing them chat so casually, just like friends enjoying themselves in a bar instead of a battlefield.

“They seem to be running out of patience.” Six Lives Buddha looked to the areas beyond the battlefield and chuckled.

Su Ping nodded. “Let’s begin then.”

“I’ll win this fight as quickly as possible,” said Six Lives Buddha, as if he were kindly reminding Su Ping.

The latter nodded; he was thinking along the same lines.

He had already used some of his trump cards, and some of the others had already been exposed. A prolonged battle would only exhaust him; he would have more time to cultivate if he finished it quickly.

“Be careful!” Six Lives Buddha suddenly bellowed.

Hum!

Time and space seemed to freeze for a moment. Su Ping then saw a purple dagger going straight for his throat.

A fatal attack at the very beginning!

Su Ping reacted quickly. Two vortices appeared next to him—the astral power gathered around his body turned into a few invisible swords that pushed the dagger off course.

Roar!!

A dragon roar burst out from one of the vortices. It came from the Inferno Dragon.

Its roar echoed throughout the battlefield, its lamp-like eyes gazing at Six Lives Buddha with fury.

On the other hand, the Little Skeleton crouched next to Su Ping like a ghost, its bones releasing a dark aura.

Merge!

Su Ping simply performed a dual merge with his pets.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Both the Little Skeleton and the Inferno Dragon turned into streaks of light which gathered on Su Ping, covering him with bones and scales; a pair of pointy horns grew from Su Ping’s temples and curled.

“Are those the pets he’s planning to merge with?”

“They don’t seem very strong. That was not a dragon with a rare bloodline.”

“They were merely Fate State pets?”

Everyone was shocked to see the Inferno Dragon that Su Ping had summoned.

Even though the dragon seemed to be strong, they could easily tell that it hadn’t even reached the Star State yet!

A battle pet warrior was able to establish contracts with pets one realm higher than theirs. So, was that pet not Su Ping’s strongest?

However, even if he doesn’t want to use the strongest one, why use the weakest?

The combat ability of such top geniuses was right before the last bottleneck, hardly able to be improved. All the pets they had were the strongest they could find in the Star State.

However, Su Ping ended up using Fate State pets, like the Skeleton King.

Six Lives Buddha noticed this too, and frowned; he started thinking that Su Ping was being too disrespectful and deliberately arrogant.

“Let’s get this over with! Future self!”

The monk’s eyes glimmered. His body became fuzzy, and then clear again. However, his face was slightly different after his reappearance, and he was significantly stronger.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
