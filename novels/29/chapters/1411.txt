Chapter 1413 If I’m a King, There Are No Emperors (2)

“You can’t!”

Su Ping’s cold words were like a judgment that fell from the top of his head along with his fist.

Boom. Emperor Yen’s head was blown up again; his body fell through the void into the bloody mist at the bottom of the restricted space. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Emperor Gui and the others showed ghastly expressions when they saw this. They found it hard to believe.

Emperor Yen was defeated this quickly? Not even Emperor Yen is a match for this brat?

It wasn’t just them; Yan Qing and the other elders of the Heaven Path Institute were stupefied. They even forgot about calling for reinforcements and stood dumbfounded.

“If I’m a king, there are no emperors!”

Su Ping turned around, then gazed at Emperor Gui and the others with an abyssal aura. “If I’m an emperor, you’re all kings!”

His voice struck everyone’s hearts like a heavy hammer. Not just Emperor Gui and his group, Yan Huang and the elders felt their hearts race too, having the impression that the young man’s words were as inviolable as the Heavenly Dao decree!

All the people present were greatly shocked by Su Ping’s aggressive stance and invincibility. They were somehow seeing the slow yet unstoppable rise of a domineering emperor.

Yan Huang watched in a daze. At that moment she was no longer an emperor; she seemed to be just a weak girl in the presence of the glowing Su Ping. The sensation was akin to the time she looked up to see an Ancestral God in the Mysterious Realms.

Back then she didn’t have the dignity of an emperor, and was just like a mortal girl.

Su Ping’s back, and the magnificent figure of the Ancestral God overlapped in front of her eyes.

She was more certain than ever that the young man would become an Ancestral God, one that would shock the entire world of

gods!

A furious roar interrupted everybody’s thoughts. “How audacious!”

The Rain Emperor’s eyes were cold, radiating intense killing intent. “Deploy the Four Emperors Blood Array and kill him right now!”

Emperor Gui and the others were alarmed, not expecting to be pushed that far. Such an array was a powerful resource of the Rain Clan, one that wouldn’t be activated unless there was a great enemy, or when they clashed against other high-ranked clans. As the name implied, four emperors were required to deploy the array. Whether they succeeded or not, all of them would suffer a great backlash later!

But…

Seeing how Emperor Yen was defeated-and seeing how arrogant Su Ping was—they knew it was probably truly impossible to suppress that brat without the array!

“Deploy the array! We will spill our blood to hunt down all criminals!”

“Die!”

The four of them set up the array and spoke at the same time, somehow fusing their auras and universes in an instant. A bloody link appeared among them, connecting their souls and power, making them seem as one. They even shouted “die” at the same time. It was as deafening as military drums!

Su Ping raised his head and roared, “You’re just a lousy and disorganized lot!”

The universe of chaos surfaced behind him; the power of mythical creatures was brewing within. There were many different times and spaces in his universe; he kept all the refugees in the deepest space of his universe to avoid implicating them.

The power of tribulation and illusion was being manifested on the superficial layers.

His universe, which was condensed from multiple small worlds, was fundamentally different from other emperors’ universes; it was heavy and more solid. It looked like one universe, while it was actually a set of multiple universes.

The multiple Great Dao in his universe was unified with the use of his contract Dao Heart, unleashing unimaginable power.

“Come on!!”

Su Ping condensed a sword made of infinite Great Dao. It was impossible to lay eyes on it, like the singularity in the universe. It was the place where all the power was condensed.

A black ravine appeared in that bloody world as Su Ping swung the sword, cutting across the sky. That universe, which was constructed by a special treasure, was actually broken by his sword!

Outside—the Rain Emperor showed a dramatic change of expression. The Netherworld Scroll, which was connected to his mind, had a tear!

Su Ping was within the scroll, and yet he had inflicted damage on the treasure. It was definitely not something an emperor could

do!

“Rain Ancestor’s Sword!!”

Emperor Gui and the others also unleashed their full strength aggressively. They used the ultimate secret technique of their clan. The power deep in their bloodlines was activated, projecting a glowing, magnificent figure: the Rain Clan’s Ancestral God.

It was an illusion; however, it was very close to reality.

When it raised a hand, the divine sword condensed in its hand was no different from a real object.

The four emperors pushed the giant sword to slash down.

Su Ping was like an ant underneath a planet when facing that sword; he wasn’t even one millionth the thickness of the edge.

That sword seemed about to cut apart the universe and destroy everything!

Su Ping’s sword, however, rose unstoppably like a dragon fish leaping from the ocean.

Infinite light burst out of Su Ping’s eyes. His sword was going to obliterate the universe!

After a boom, the enormous sword from the Ancestral God clashed with Su Ping’s sword aura. Chaotic currents brushed everyone’s bodies for a moment. Any God King other than Su Ping would have been suppressed, even by the wake of the attack.

Yan Qing and the others gazed at the dazzling light, knowing that the sword had cut apart everything, putting an end to the fight.

They saw the most unbelievable scene in the midst of that dazzling light.

There was actually a crack on the enormous Ancestral God’s sword.

After that, the crack grew larger and quickly extended to fill the sword with several other cracks, until it fell apart, turning into powder.

At the same time—the four emperors manning the array vomited blood at the same time, pale-faced. They were at a loss for a moment.

The strongest attack of four emperors failed?

The giant sword crumbled and the magnificent figure of the Ancestral God was also dispersing

Su Ping dashed out of the chaotic currents, gray long hair fluttering in the wind; his eyes were as deep as the starry universe. While still carrying an aggressive sharpness and killing intent, he located the four enemies and slashed at them.

“Stop!”

The Rain Emperor was infuriated by that action. He waved a hand and raised a fog of blood in the red world; wreathing Su Ping in an attempt to stop and swallow him.

“Get lost!” roared Su Ping, with eyes like lightning. He approached Emperor Lie, who was the closest one to him. While the latter looked at him in horror, he slashed down.

The sword contained the power of many kinds of Great Dao, including corruption, disintegration and death, which completely destroyed the emperor’s body and soul!

The Rain Emperor couldn’t remain calm anymore as he saw that another emperor had died. The surging fury almost twisted his face.

The Rain Emperor gritted his teeth and spoke telepathically, “Elders, please come out and kill this bastard!”

There were many other emperors in the Rain Clan who were training in seclusion; some were even Emperor Yen’s seniors. There were even previous clan leaders, as well as emperors from the Rain Ancestor’s age.

They were all terrifying old monsters, always living in seclusion as they pursued the highest Ancestral God realm.

They wouldn’t have been summoned unless a catastrophe was upon them. The Rain Emperor had been forced to call out to them, or he would be unable to end the situation. The problem wasn’t yet. He was certainly incapable of letting Su Ping go.

The place somehow became quiet as his telepathic voice was spread to all the Mysterious Realms of the Rain Clan.

The whole world seemed to be enveloped in a strange power.

After that, powerful auras arose from all the mountains of the Rain Clan’s territory.

Some of the Mysterious Realms were opened. Gray and ancient auras flowed out, tantamount to an old coffin being reopened.

“Clan master? What is it that you need our help for?”

“Lin’er, what’s the matter?”

“There’s the smell of blood…”

All the figures stepped out of the depths of the Rain Clan. In the blink of an eye-the whole world seemed to have been relocated to another universe. Time was frozen; none of the Rain Clan’s onlookers were able to see what was beyond the barrier. They became as solid as statues.

“You…”

Yan Qing quickly changed her expression. Never did they expect the Rain Clan to be so insane, deploying all forces against Su Ping who was working alone!

All of the Rain Clan’s strongest experts were present, except for the Ancestral God!

“The last leader of the Rain Clan!”

“Lin Tianzhan!”

Yan Qing was almost terrified.
