Chapter 273 Returning Customer

“Come on, little guy.”

Su Ping swiped the contract space open. A heatwave was felt as the Inferno Dragon leaped out.

Same as before, Su Ping told the Inferno Dragon to crouch by the door.

The Inferno Dragon was unhappy about this new assignment. Still, it didn’t complain to Su Ping considering the past few days had been comfortable. Compared to the days when it had to fight day and night... The Inferno Dragon sure thought lying around was easy.

As the door opened, gradually, customers began to show up.

As per usual, soon, the street outside was jammed. People hurried over upon hearing that the store was in business. Many customers had rented a place on the street so that they could arrive as soon as the store opened.

Those people were extra proactive since they knew that this store had the “quirk” of closing at irregular hours and they hoped they had arrived in time to get their pets trained.

Su Ping had just finished writing down the information of a customer when someone shouted in pleasant surprise, “Mr. Su, it is you!”

Startled, Su Ping looked up, only to see a familiar girl standing in front of him: Su Yanying

Su Yanying was overjoyed. When she first stepped into the street, she thought she had gone to the wrong location. Following the crowd, she went to a familiar location. However, that old, shabby store was gone and in its place was a huge building.

Like a five-star hotel or a mansion, this store had an air of luxury.

Su Yanying lacked the courage to go into the store. Later on, when many people began to queue outside, she decided to go in and have a look. To her surprise, this indeed was Su Ping’s store.

“Sir, the place has changed completely!” Su Yanying sounded excited.

Su Ping answered with a smile, “Of course. I have to renovate now that I’ve made money.”

Su Yanying found it hard to say anything in reply. She remembered the high prices in Su Ping’s store. She could tell that Su Ping’s store had become well-known to the public. She saw many luxury cars parked outside, from which she could tell that many rich people from the upper town area had made the long trip to go there, attracted by his fame.

“Sir, have you... increased the prices here?” Su Yanying posed her question, nervous to hear the answer.

Su Ping said to himself that he would very much want to increase them, but the heartless system would not allow him to do that.

“Don’t worry. The prices will never be increased.”

“Really? Great! How kind of you, sir!” Su Yanying breathed in relief. How delightful. “Have you just come back from the barren area?” Su Ping asked.

To that question, Su Yanying nodded. “Yes, I have just come back recently. The Elite League is about to begin and I want to try my luck there. I will be happy enough if I can make it to the top 1000 and see my name on the Victor’s List.”

The Top 1000 would have their names printed on the Victor’s List, which was a tradition of the Elite League’s qualification trials in the Longjiang Base City. At the end of the Elite League, the list would be posted on all the platforms of the Longjiang Base City’s intranet for everyone to see. That was part of the extensive promotion of the Elite League. Su Ping thought of something. He still had some Top 10 package spots available. “Do you have enough money? We have the package to guarantee making it to the Top 10. Do you want it?”

Su Yanying didn’t understand. “The Top 10? Are you talking about the qualification trials of the Elite League in the base city?” “Yes, I am.”

“How... much do you need?”

“Not much. Two to three million will be enough.” Su Ping sounded casual.

But that took Su Yanying by surprise.

For the average well-off, two to three million would be a drop in the bucket. But for her, that was a huge sum of money.

She was struggling. “Yingying, if you need money, I can lend you some,” Someone said from behind her.

Su Ping looked up. It was Lan Lele who was standing behind Su Yanying

Lan Lele’s family lived in the shantytown part of the base city, but her father was a famous and rich entrepreneur in the area; her family was well-endowed. Compared to those vastly rich people in the upper town area, her family was nothing. But a family asset of over a billion, no one could compare to them in that sector. As Lan Lele offered to lend Su Yanying some money, for the first time, Su Ping didn’t dislike her offer.

“Do you also want this? You have the money,” Su Ping asked at once.

Lan Lele shook her head. She no longer held a grudge against Su Ping. They did argue at the very beginning of their interactions. But she had witnessed the quality of Su Ping’s service in person. She would think Su Ping’s service worthwhile no matter how much money he was charging

She didn’t have to think much to understand that buying the Top 10 package with a couple of millions was a good bargain.

As for whether Su Ping could make that happen, she never doubted it. Su Ping could train a Lightning Rat to a level where it could defeat an advanced-rank pet instantly. Making someone reach the Top 10 sounded like an exaggeration but she no longer had suspicions when it was Su Ping who said those words.

“Thank you, but not for me. I’m not interested in becoming a battle pet warrior. I’ll have to inherit my family assets in the future.” Lan Lele turned him down.

She had no big ambitions. She would consider her life as a good one by simply taking over the family business. As for striving for a promising future, to hell with that.

Su Ping felt sorry that he had to give up. She wasn’t easy to manipulate.

He actually thought the girl had great potential. The reason being: she had money.

He could make a pig fly as long as he could receive money.

While Su Ping and Lan Lele’s communication went on, Su Yanying had made her decision. She shook her head to Lan Lele. “I made some money during my trip this time. The merit credits can be converted into astral coins. I can afford the two to three million.”

Lan Lele had heard about her experience in the barren area and understood that Su Yanying’s trip had been rewarding. Therefore, Lan Lele nodded and didn’t insist on lending her money. “Sir, about the Top 10, at the moment, I am merely at the fourth-rank. I wonder if that is going to be a problem...”

Su Yanying blushed and her voice faded away gradually. When she talked to other people, they would often praise her for being at the fourth rank. However, in front of Su Ping, she was embarrassed to mention her cultivation and rank.

Su Ping chuckled. “It’s okay. You just have to stand on the stage. Your pet will do the rest for you.”

Su Yanying was relieved but her cheeks burned up even more.

The same thing happened when she was in the academy. She did nothing other than relying on the Lightning Rat that Su Ping had trained for her. She had won second place before she figured out what had happened, and that she had slowed the Lightning Rat down with wrongful commands. Otherwise... she would have won the championship.

“Well, thank you, then.”

Su Yanying buried her face in her chest. She was aware that relying on her pet other than herself was a shame for a battle pet warrior. However... this was the Top 10 they were talking about! That was an appealing

prospect!

That was an achievement that she had not dared to imagine or hope for. She could enjoy a loftier glory, more than what she could attain by winning a championship at the academy!

After all, people across the Longjiang Base City would be in for the Elite League and her opponents would be those star students that had long graduated, as well as seasoned explorers.

If she could make it to the Top 10, she would definitely make a name for herself.

“No problem. You just have to pay.” Su Ping smiled brilliantly.

Su Yanying nodded and made the transfer.

Su Ping registered her information, which was the process he was more than familiar with, and asked, “Still the Lightning Rat?”

“Yes.” Su Yanying nodded. She had other pets that were more advanced than the Lightning Rat, such as the Fallen Phoenix. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Still, at the moment, the Lightning Rat was her major pet. She understood fully how much it meant to her. After her trip to the barren area, she had learned that it was not the number of pets that mattered, but the quality of the pets!

One pet would be enough to best anyone as long as it was powerful enough! Su Ping nodded. The Lightning Rat could easily carry Su Yanying to the Top 100. Strengthening the Lightning Rat so that she could reach the Top 10 was also easy. If he were the one to master the Lightning Rat, he would reach the Top 10 without having to train the Lightning Rat again. But, since it was Su Yanying who was the master... the Lightning Rat’s strength would be diminished a bit.

He had to train the Lightning Rat again and take the chance to teach it to fight alone without relying on its master.

Whoosh!

When Su Yanying summoned the Lighting Rat, Su Ping’s image fell into its dark eyes immediately.

This man again!

The Lightning Rat showed its teeth.

Its soft fur stood on its roots.

Su Ping grinned. What a “nostalgic” little dude. It remembered him.
