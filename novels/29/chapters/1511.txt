Chapter 1512: Break the Dragon Prison (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“Are you ready?”

Su Ping looked at his pets, all set to give it a try. He knew his escape from the prison could alarm the Original Dragons’ ancestor, who would then suppress him again; it would be no different from directly returning to the store.

However, he still wanted to do it.

Sensing their master’s determination, both the Dark Dragon Hound and the Inferno Dragon both moved next to him.

They exchanged looks; Su Ping could feel what they were thinking.

He then took a deep breath and released his contract power.

All his pets were instantly assimilated as raw power in his body.

Such a multiple fusion would be really difficult to other battle pet warriors, but it was already possible to merge with five pets in the Celestial State.

It was fairly easy to fuse with ten pets at the same time while in the Dao Heart State.

As for Ancestral Gods, they had already seen through the Great Dao; they could merge with as many pets as their bodies could tolerate.

Su Ping’s body changed significantly as he completely fused their power. He became much bigger, with scales and claws growing. A soft tentacle emerged from his brow and turned into the Purple Python’s enormous head; one shoulder had the Dark Dragon Hound’s scary head, while the other had the Inferno Dragon’s.

All the prisoners were truly shocked by the transformation. The bodily structure and its sense of power reminded them of the term “perfection.”

It was a feeling only caused by the Sorcerer Ancestors.

The twelve Sorcerer Ancestors looked different; however, no matter which of them they saw, they would feel that their bodies were natural and perfect.

Such perfection was beyond the understanding of normal beings; it couldn’t be seen, understood or described.

The power from the merging alone made Su Ping feel that he could easily kill Yan Tai without having to use up a couple of his lives.

He then took a deep breath, and a rotating vortex appeared behind his back, which produced many illusory universes. They overlapped and gradually became real.

The chaos universe was no longer dominant when he condensed the fifth universe. Once the sixth universe came to be, the chaos universe chose to join the rest.

The seventh universe he had just condensed had been fused into the ring of universes. Everything was natural; the chaos universe gave no signs of rejection.

Adding the latter’s might, Su Ping now had the power of eight universes at his disposal.

Considering the Inferno Dragon’s undying universe, there were nine universes in total.

He stared at the void inside the Dragon Prison, then summoned both his essence and blood and quickly burned his vitality, all to transform it into a crimson sword.

His own arms and legs were already the most powerful weapons in the world. The sword made of his essence and blood was the sharpest; each drop of blood contained dozens of perfect Great Daos.

Bang!

Su Ping suddenly detonated his chaos universe.

A violent power spread out. The other eight universes exploded one after the other; such a tremendous blast pushed out the power of the entire universe.

That was an attack that Dao Heart experts could only use once in their entire lives.

However, it was the most common method used by Undying State experts. Their universes could gather again and again, even if they were shattered a thousand times.

Nine streams of chaotic power gushed out simultaneously after the explosions; Su Ping glared and focused all his strength to contain them. It didn’t take long for the power to surge and collide. He felt as if he were holding a quickly expanding hot balloon about to explode!

Slash!!

With a roar, Su Ping infused the power into the bloody sword and slashed forth.

Countless Great Daos lit up the entire Dragon Prison, just like the light from the explosion caused by a black hole.

This sword was like the dawn ended the momentary darkness.

Boom!

The Dragon Prison trembled, and a loud sound was heard.

It was a first for Su Ping to receive a response after swinging his sword hundreds of times.

He noticed an extremely small crack on the Dragon Prison. Su Ping had sliced the Dragon Prison open with a single attack!

The Haotian guy widened his eyes and looked at the scene in fright. Billions of years had passed without him feeling this shocked.

The other prisoners were also dumbfounded, unable to believe that such a miracle would truly happen.

An Undying State fellow cracked the Sorcerer Ancestor’s universe!

The sight of the resulting fissure inspired a delighted smile Su Ping saw the result of his work, while unable to see her smile of delight. He burst into laughter.

“Hurry up, the crack is about to heal!” shouted one of the prisoners, seeing that the crack was narrowing.

The Haotian fellow said, “Let’s make a run for it, or it’ll be too late!”

They certainly had been exploited, and yet they almost cried tears of joy once they found a chance of escape. The cage that had imprisoned them for countless years had been cut open. Even if Su Ping was the one who did it, they were excited nonetheless.

Su Ping, however, didn’t do anything. He watched the crack heal with a smile on his face.

If he could cut it open once, he could do it again.

He did this not because he wanted to escape, but because he wanted to tell the Original Dragons’ ancestor that he wasn’t in the wrong!

“It’s healed…”

The prisoners were at a loss as they saw the crack heal; just like poked balloons. However, they snapped back to reality when they heard Su Ping’s laughter, and their eyes were hopeful.

If Su Ping was able to cut it once, there was a high chance he could cut it open again.

“Why didn’t you run?” asked the guy from the Haotian Clan.

Su Ping smiled casually and said, “I can leave anytime I want.”

The prisoners were at a loss, but they were fully convinced.

“You’re the first person in history capable of breaking the Sorcerer Ancestor’s universe,” said one of the prisoners.

“The Original Dragons’ ancestor surely caught wind of the situation; you should go right now, or it’ll surely confine you through other means,” said another prisoner. He didn’t say that because they cared about Su Ping, but because they feared the chance of being killed inside the prison like Su Ping.

“He’s already here.”

Su Ping raised his head with a smile. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The space above the Dragon Prison became turbulent, slowly forming an eye.

The orb was enormous, as dazzling as the sun, which lit up the entire prison. Su Ping and the others were already large enough, but they seemed to be as small as grains of dust when compared to the eye.

“You actually thought of this method. Yes. This is indeed the only way for you people to get close to our level,” said the ancestor with a snort. His voice was utterly oppressive, but Su Ping was in the Undying State anyway. He didn’t feel intimidated.

Su Ping gazed at him and said, “I will surely surpass you if you give me your Chaos Qualification.”

The enormous eye narrowed, then said with a cold smile, “How arrogant! You could have taken this chance to escape; do you still think you can get out of this place alive?”

“I will get out of this place, and I’ll come back,” said Su Ping with a stare. “Next time, I’ll make you see that the Original Dragons can’t represent all the dragons in the world. One day, my partner will surpass you and become the strongest dragon in all of history!”

“Hilarious!”

The ancestor snorted. “You can indeed get closer to our level by using that cultivating method, but that’s a mere approximation. There were people like you in the past, but they’re all dead now.”

“It didn’t work in the past, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work in the future. There’s always hope in the future!” declared Su Ping.

“All dragons are under my command, including your so-called partner. On your knees!”

The Original Dragon ancestor turned cold; he then manifested an ancient and magnificent willpower, instantly descending over Su Ping.

Su Ping, the other prisoners and all his pets were all terrified. They were shivering.

Such a scene was basically a confrontation against a Sorcerer Ancestor!
