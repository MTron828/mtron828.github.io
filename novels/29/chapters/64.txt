Chapter 66: Skillful Block

“It’s not dead? But how?”

Everybody saw how powerful that direct spike attack was. It basically grounded Little Skeleton to particles. It was commonly believed that a skeleton still needed most of its bones intact to be resurrected.

Little Skeleton did not give them any more time to wonder. After unleashing another ferocious howl, it lunged at the Magical Corpse Beast, blade raised, while red sigils like blood veins coursed through its bones.

This was the bloodline power of a Skeleton King.

The Magical Corpse Beast felt threatened by Little Skeleton’s display. It roared back and hastily shot out more bone spikes to stop Little Skeleton from approaching. But Little Skeleton was just too agile at the moment. It skillfully evaded all the attacks by either jumping or using its blade to parry.

Rarrrw!!

Once again, the Magical Corpse Beast began drawing dark pulses of energy to channel another Spirit Shock.

“This is bad. It’s doing it again!” Fan Ganglie and Ye Chenshan wanted to warn Su Ping to back off.

While maintaining his cold look, Su Ping sent another order to Little Skeleton.

Huraaaa!

It was Little Skeleton’s Deadly Roar skill this time. At soon as the skill went off, the effect of Spirit Shock arrived, trying to disrupt Little Skeleton’s consciousness again. However, Little Skeleton seemed completely unaffected this time. It kept running toward the Magical Corpse Beast at full speed.

“It resisted the Spirit Shock??” Fan Ganglie pointed out, “Don’t tell me that skeleton has higher spiritual potential than that eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast?”

“That can’t be,” said Ye Chenshan, “If so, it should have stayed behind to attack the enemy using spiritual attacks instead of charging ahead. Maybe it used some kind of special move to block off the skill.”

Deadly Roar was a pretty common skill that was easily found in tutorial books. Just like other similar skills, it was mainly used for intimidation. No one had noticed any defensive effects.

Ye Chenshan glanced at Su Ping again; he kept a neutral attitude.

“He knew this would work? Who is he, really?”

“Kill it!” Su Ping remotely ordered again.

He discovered this extra effect of Deadly Roar when traveling inside the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. Of course Deadly Roar was not intended for defense. However, using the skill would somehow fill Little Skeleton up with uncontrollable violence and rage, which could in turn neutralize the invasive effect of the Spirit Shock.

Even so, Su Ping still had to tell Little Skeleton to use Deadly Roar at the exact moment, down to a single millisecond, for this to work out. To practice, he spent a long time facing off a ghost monster that only knew how to use spiritual attacks. And even so, he could only succeed about 7 times out of 10.

The Magical Corpse Beast was halfway through another Black Annihilation. Before it could finish the skill, Little Skeleton was already upon its face. A simple slash was enough to destroy the incomplete vortex in the making.

Next, Little Skeleton jumped onto the Magical Corpse Beast and began randomly chopping it at lightning speed. Its sharp bone blade cut through the beast’s outer shell like a knife meeting butter. Within seconds, large pieces of bones and chips were blown off.

The Magical Corpse Beast shrieked in pain and created a giant bone claw from its body to capture Little Skeleton, which was completely useless against Little Skeleton’s rapid moves.

The beast suddenly huddled into a ball and began rolling, hoping to crush Little Skeleton. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The ground quaked as the giant bone ball madly twirled and bumped around, during which Little Skeleton was nowhere to be found.

Fan Ganglie and Ye Chenshan feared that they would become the next target if Little Skeleton was killed. They would have escaped already, if they had not seen Su Ping still watching the battle with a plain look.

“Hey—hey, should we help out? We can’t just stand here...” the woman accompanying Ye Chenshan anxiously spoke to Su Ping.

Lin Mokong and Ye Chenshan followed suit and all gave Su Ping a questioning look. They had to admit that Su Ping was their most dependable helper at the moment.

Su Ping didn’t answer. He was too busy keeping an eye on the Magical Corpse Beast.

Rarrrw!!

The rolling beast bellowed in great pain.

It slowly came to a halt as black fog seeped out through its shell and slowly covered it up.

The others stared at Su Ping again, not sure what exactly was happening.

Su Ping breathed a sigh of relief and finally looked away from the battlefield. He gave the woman a friendly smile to thank her for her willingness to assist, before talking to Fan Ganglie, “It’s done. Almost. You should pick up your Azure Quetzalcoatl. Maybe it can still be saved.”

Fan Ganglie gave the Magical Corpse Beast an uncertain look. He couldn’t see anything because it had been completely engulfed by the fog.

He saw his Azure Quetzalcoatl still struggling on the floor. With clenched teeth, he moved closer so he could drag the creature back into his pet space. Meanwhile, his Mountain Mover acted as his cover.
