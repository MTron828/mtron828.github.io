Chapter 1041: Unbent Dragon Soul

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A divine spear was gathered in Mo Feng’s hand; he looked like an unparalleled God of War. He revealed all the techniques he knew since Su Ping had pushed him to a corner. He roared and waved his spear, launching enough divine power to drown the earth like a tide!

Boom!

Su Ping staggered while drenched in blood, seemingly about to fall at any time. However, he stubbornly propped himself to stand tall every time his body shivered, as if some sort of power were preventing him from falling. Once he reached his opponent, he waved his sword and slashed furiously. Both of them were trying their hardest!

Their worlds were condensed on their blades, and collided like two stars. The most dazzling divine light burst out, making the arena glow. All the gods watching felt that their eyes were stinging. The resulting divine light from broken laws was unbearable even for them! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

What an astounding battle it was!

“Ah!!!!”

Mo Feng’s eyes were almost popping out. He roared furiously while his hair fluttered. His unparalleled divine constitution was falling apart, but he didn’t retreat. The God Scaring Curse seemed to have enhanced him with an ancient power, protecting him from Su Ping’s double small world suppression!

On the other hand, Su Ping’s bones were quaking. It wasn’t hard for him to resist Mo Feng’s attack. However, the horrifying pressure given by the Ancestral God was still being imposed upon him like a mountain. He was fighting as though carrying the Realm of Gods on his back at the same time.

“I will kill you, even if you’re under the Ancestral God’s protection!”

Su Ping raised his head. Blood splashed out of his eyes and his bones twisted. However, they were regenerated at a crazy rate. The Golden Crow blood burned inside his body, and the illusion of a massive Golden Crow emerged behind his back. It flapped its wings and shrieked at the magnificent Ancestral God’s shadow up in the sky!

Boom!

The deity aura inside Su Ping’s body was focused on his arms like sea water being boiled and evaporated. His willpower was condensed like a saber. His second small world revolved slowly, unleashing a power even more horrifying than the law of destruction, causing even more cracks in Mo Feng’s small world.

Su Ping stepped forward with a scorching sword, determined to kill Mo Feng!

“You! You!”

Mo Feng was exasperated, frightened even. He had tried his best, yet he was unable to withstand Su Ping’s strength. He could not believe he would die there, at the hands of a mere human!

“No way. No way!!

“I’m a supreme prince. I will rise to the ultimate peak and become an unparalleled emperor someday!” Mo Feng roared in grief. There was a glorious path ahead of him. How could he fall there?

The patterns of the God Scaring Curse all over his body were enlivened. They penetrated his flesh and absorbed the essence inside his body. In turn, the power they absorbed allowed the curse to emit an ancient aura, which was even older than the Realm of Gods. The old man outside the arena narrowed his eyes with a shivering face, fearing that something ominous might happen!

“Go to hell!!!” Su Ping roared abruptly, with his hair rising to the sky.

He saw that a horrifying aura was rising from Mo Feng. The one tiny bit of the aura that had been revealed already frightened him. He burnt all of his divine power, and boiled the Golden Crow’s blood, summoning an unimaginable power. He rose to an unprecedented height!

“God’s Arrival!”

Su Ping roared and slashed furiously with his sword!

His sword aura seemed ready to cut the world apart. His two small worlds exploded and turned into dazzling blades, which struck Mo Feng’s small world and tore it apart. Even the arm holding the spear was cut apart too!

Golden blood splashed out. Mo Feng staggered back with a pale face. He looked at Su Ping, who had once again attacked him, wondering why he still had strength left.

He detonated his own small worlds to fight me. He’s crazy!?Mo Feng’s heart was shivering. He had never met such an insane opponent before. He had made use of a forbidden technique and asked for the Ancestral God’s protection, yet he was still unable to win.?This human being is unbelievably strong!

However, he hadn’t failed yet!

“Beast slave, rip him apart!”

The space in front of Mo Feng fell apart, and a scary tiger-like creature leaped out. It had the body of a tiger and the tail of a dragon; black fire was burning over its fur and carried the pressure of dragons. It was a Tiger Grief, a rare beast in the Realm of Gods!

Its bloodline was no less noble or rare than that of many dragons!

Roar!!

The creature roared at Su Ping furiously the moment it leaped out. That was Mo Feng’s battle pet and mount. It then stood in front of Mo Feng and gazed at the tiny and frail human with brutality in its eyes.

Many gods were shocked by such development, not expecting that Mo Feng would still have more trump cards. The Tiger Grief was on the same level as Mo Feng. It couldn’t have posed a problem to Su Ping had it been summoned earlier on; however, he was already approaching his limits, and he had also detonated his small worlds. The pet would be the last straw on Su Ping’s back, signaling his downfall!

Was it possible for Mo Feng to turn the tables and win the battle?

If he could do that, his name would be sung for eons in the Realm of Gods, for defeating someone who boasted double small worlds!

“Your pet?” Su Ping raised his head with passion in his eyes. There was a fire in his body still burning crazily. After hearing the hysterical calls in his heart, Su Ping smiled and said to himself, “Do you really want to come out? Can you really endure it?”

His smile was even brighter after receiving a positive reply.

“All right, come out then. I said I would have you become the strongest dragon! Today, you will swallow this god!”

Roar!!!

As the summoning space appeared, a roar that seemed to have been held back for a long time was finally unleashed, shocking the entire arena!

The roar seemed to have originated from an ancient dragon. Even the gods watching the battle changed their expressions. All of them gazed at the gigantic dragon that had just crawled out; they had never seen the like.

The Realm of Gods was vast, and dragons were extremely fertile. They had mutants every year; it was nothing worthy of surprise.

However, what astonished them was that the draconic aura wasn’t as powerful as they had imagined!

Still, the roar and appearance of the dragon had made their hearts shiver!

A dragon ablaze with inferno fire stepped out of the contract space. Its massive eyes were bloodshot, filled with fury and madness.

“So, a dragon slave. A perfect match for an ant master. On your knees!” Mo Feng thought that Su Ping had other methods. He felt both relief and scorn after seeing the human had only summoned a dragon.

Once he said that, the pressure from the magnificent Ancestral God’s shadow was also imposed on the Inferno Dragon.

There was a booming sound, and the Inferno Dragon’s legs lost strength; the pet immediately fell on one of its knees!

Every life seemed ant-like under the pressure of the Ancestral God. Even dragons would be insignificant.

The contempt in Mo Feng’s eyes was even greater. It was a miracle for Su Ping to resist the Ancestral God’s pressure; he didn’t think his pet could do the same. However, the next moment, a maddening dragon roar almost split his ears apart!

Roar, roar, roar!!

The roars echoed throughout the world and changed the color of the sky!

The Inferno Dragon raised its head and let out a bestial cry that came from thousands of years in the past. It had seen and fought countless beasts along with Su Ping, even against beings stronger than Major Gods. The pet had been killed with ease, but it was able to remember their auras and pressure.

The dragon’s courage grew after continuous deaths. Not even beasts two levels stronger could intimidate it anymore.

Even though the Ancestral God’s shadow was horrifying, giving it an inevitable fright, it knew that Su Ping was right behind it!

Its master was right there. How could it fall!

“Roar!!!”

The deafening roar swept across the arena like a tornado. The next moment, the Inferno Dragon slowly stood straight again, raising its fierce head to gaze at its enemy exasperated and bloodshot eyes.

The Tiger Grief, whose level was higher, was scared before that pet. It uncontrollably took a step back!

“What are you doing??”

Mo Feng changed his expression and roared, “Bastard, go forward and kill them!”

The Tiger Grief shivered after being yelled back by its master; it was too scared of him to retreat. It then roared and charged at the Inferno Dragon!

The flames covering the Inferno Dragon’s body burned even more exuberantly; they were also mixed with lightning and a dazzling divine power. It stood there like an indestructible wall; a loyal guard in front of Su Ping. However, it suddenly raised its claws when the Tiger Grief roared and approached.

After a boom, harnessing the law of time, it moved faster than expected and flashed to reach the Tiger Grief’s nape, before it shredded its opponent brutally!

The earth trembled, and the Tiger Grief was smashed, making a deep pit.

The Inferno Dragon looked down at it with bloodshot eyes. It raised its feet, and there was a small world underneath them.

Thanks to the Energy Transmission Technique, Su Ping had taught the four supreme laws as well as the other laws he had grasped to the Little Skeleton and the Inferno Dragon. Adding their own experience, the Inferno Dragon had established its small world too, almost perfecting it!

The Tiger Grief shivered and wanted to flee once it noticed the huge world underneath the dragon’s feet. However, it was so intimidated by the Inferno Dragon’s aura that it didn’t even have the courage to run off.

“Spare this one,” Su Ping suddenly said.

The Inferno Dragon’s feet paused in midair. They were only half a meter away from the Tiger Grief’s head.

Su Ping supported himself with the sword of laws. He then looked at Mo Feng who stood beyond the Tiger Grief. “You treat your pet as a slave. You don’t deserve its protection!”

Su Ping had already realized that, although the Tiger Grief’s bloodline was much rarer and more powerful than the Inferno Dragon’s, it seemed to have been tortured a lot; it didn’t have the courage to fight stronger enemies.

“Damn it, I knew that beast slaves weren’t trustworthy. You lowly beings!” Mo Feng retreated with an awful expression. The God Scaring Curse on his back was still there, slowly twisting and absorbing his strength.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He coldly dashed forward in the next moment, appearing almost instantly before Mo Feng.

Then, he punched the latter!

There was a boom, as Mo Feng was hit in the abdomen. He vomited saliva and blood; his eyeballs popped out too.

Then, Su Ping struck the man’s back with his elbow, brutally smashing the god into the ground.

Su Ping had already stepped on his handsome face before the latter could stand up.

Unstoppable!

He looked down at the prince. His body was drenched in blood, but he seemed taller and stronger than ever. “Proud high-ranked prince, your head is below my foot today. Is there anything you want to say?”
