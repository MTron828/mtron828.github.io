Chapter 1161: Severed Arm

Shirley changed her expression and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? I didn’t say anything. You must have misheard.”

“I misheard? Do you want me to replay what you said with the God Speaking Technique?” said the maid coldly.

Shirley looked crestfallen. She was just a maid; she wasn’t really talented, even though she was from a mid-ranked clan. That was why she wasn’t a student; she could only hold a spot as a maid.

Her family would suffer if the Rain Clan were to punish her. She would suffer for sure!

“Who are you?” Su Ping raised his eyebrows and asked the maid, “You just walked out of my palace; you must be one of the maids appointed to me by the institute, right?”

“I am, but not for long.” The maid stared at Su Ping calmly and indifferently. “You, a mere human being, offended the Rain Clan and killed their prince in public. Maybe you’ll still be able to rescue humankind if you go to the Rain Clan and kowtow to apologize.”

“Huh?”

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and asked, “What do you mean?”

“What do I mean? The Rain Clan has captured all the human beings on the Sea Moon Continent, and demanded that you show up within three days. They accused you of stealing their ultimate treasures, but their real purpose is for you to go to their territory, admit to your unscrupulous behavior in public and apologize. Maybe the clan will spare the humans if you behave,” said the maid coldly.

At first dazed, Su Ping then wore a grim expression; there seemed to be fire in his eyes.

“I remember having warned the Rain Clan, telling them to come to me if they had a problem. To think that a high-ranked clan would threaten me with hostages instead of confronting me. Is this not disgusting?” said Su Ping to the maid, like a sharp blade that would slash at any moment.

The maid’s expression changed somewhat, feeling a chill under Su Ping’s gaze. She then remembered that the guy was a genius junior who had killed a prince of the Rain Clan.

He was definitely one of the strongest in his level, and could be included in the Chaos List.

“It is pointless to say that to me; the Rain Clan simply asked me to relay the message, and so I did.”

The maid turned around and quickly left, fearing that Su Ping would vent his fury on her. He wouldn’t be punished, even if he wounded or killed her.

Furthermore, Su Ping would soon be dead. She would die for nothing if he killed her in the meantime.

Once the other maid left, Shirley quickly said to Su Ping, “Mr. Su, don’t go there. It’s a trap!”

“A trap?” Su Ping’s eyes were peaceful. “Are you saying that the human beings living on the Sea Moon Continent weren’t arrested?”

“Well…” Shirley hesitated for a moment, then said, “That’s not what I meant. I’m saying that the Rain Clan set up such a scheme because they’re wary about you becoming too strong in the future. They wanted to kill you in the institute, but the elders in the institute stopped them, since you killed their prince in a fair duel, and both of you had voluntarily participated. Besides, you’ve shown enough potential to earn the elder’s respect; they intend to train you as a star student.

“As long as you cultivate hard, you will surely rise and attain an unparalleled level in the future; very few people would be a threat to you unless the Ancestral Gods step in.”

Su Ping shook his head. “They did arrest all human beings. I must go there.”

Shirley felt dazed. She said anxiously, “But you’ll die for nothing. Besides, even if you go there, they might not spare the humans; after all, publicly killing their prince was too humiliating for their clan!”

“That’s why I’m going to rescue them,” said Su Ping with indifferent eyes.

Shirley opened her mouth, but befuddlement prevented her from finding words.

Rescue them?

But you can hardly protect yourself!

Su Ping stopped talking about the subject; he, too, knew it was difficult to rescue them from the formidable Rain Clan. Even so, he was dead set on going there.

He would never be able to do it if he didn’t have the determination for it.

“The Rain Clan…”

Su Ping clenched his fists, repressing the fury in his heart.

He didn’t stay. He bid Shirley goodbye and simply left the palace, then headed to the training grounds at the foot of the mountain.

Two princes of the Rain Clan were there, cultivating their divine quality!

They would be admitted by the Heaven Path Institute as official students when their divine quality met the standard.

In terms of strength, the two princes and many others would qualify to enter, but their divine quality wasn’t good enough.

Su Ping hovered above the training grounds and roared, “Rain Clan, come out!”

Everybody was instantly shocked, surprised to hear such exclamation and wondering who would be bold enough to speak so disrespectfully.

“Who’s causing trouble?” roared someone furiously. Then, a figure rushed out of the training grounds and stopped in midair with unmasked fury and killing intent.

But then he saw Su Ping’s face—the fury on his face was replaced by bewilderment and even fright.

The lunatic before him was none other than the guy who had killed Mo Feng!

He was the human being who had been admitted by the Heaven Path Institute!

“It’s you! Why are you here?” said the young prince with both shock and fury, as he could guess that Su Ping was looking for trouble. He didn’t think he could beat the guy, not after knowing that Mo Feng lost. That is, unless they weren’t in an arena; anywhere else he would be able to crush the brat using the ultimate treasures his family had given him.

He didn’t think that the human could have as many treasures as he did!

“Isn’t the Rain Clan trying to seek justice for your dead prince? Lead the way!” said Su Ping coldly.

The young prince’s expression changed; he had heard about his clan wanting to avenge Mo Feng, that was why he was scared to see Su Ping. He was afraid that the man would challenge him to a duel, and kill one more member of the Rain Clan before he went down.

“You stole an ultimate treasure of the Rain Clan; of course we’re looking for you! You’d better return it right now. Don’t presume you’ll be safe and sound while sheltered by the elders of the institute!” said the prince angrily.

Su Ping sneered. “Are you that angry because I stole the ancestral item of the Rain Clan? If you want me to go there, fine. Lead the way!”

“You!!”

The young prince burst into fury, then gave Su Ping a gloomy stare.

Ancestral item?

It was fine to say that to an ordinary person, but their clan’s ancestor was an Ancestral God who was still alive!

The way the human referred to their Ancestral God was an intolerable insult!

Another roar burst out, “You’re asking to be killed!”

A figure dashed over, precisely the other prince of the Rain Clan training in the premises. He was glaring at Su Ping with bloodshot eyes, as if he were about to skin Su Ping and eat him alive.

The Ancestral God was almighty and sacred in the eyes of the whole Rain Clan!

He had planned to hide in the dark and let his cousin take care of everything. He would have had the chance to take advantage of them if Su Ping fought his fellow clan member and both got wounded. However, he couldn’t stand to hear Su Ping insult their Ancestral God; his fury got the better of him!

There was only one thought in his heart, which was to have Su Ping pay the price with blood!

Furthermore, all human beings would have to answer for what he said!

Everybody must be taught a lesson. The Ancestral God is not to be insulted!

“Is he crazy?”

“Oh my god. He just said that he stole the Rain Clan’s ancestral item. That’s insane!”

“I heard that too. The Rain Clan is probably just doing this to avenge their prince. But this guy… he’s truly insane to say such a thing!”

“Humankind is doomed, and so is this guy…”

The gods and their vassals present were so shocked they were all gasps after hearing what Su Ping said. They could not believe how crazy he was.

Boom!

All of a sudden—a dull thunder rumbled in the sky. A vortex appeared, and a cold and intimidating face emerged.

“You will die for insulting the Rain Clan’s Ancestral God!”

A green hand came out from the void after those words were spoken, ready to catch Su Ping.

Exactly at that moment—a frowning man dashed over and appeared in front of the giant hand, his own hands clasped behind his back.

“Emperor Ye, this is the Heaven Path Institute. Don’t you think you’re being impetuous?”

It was an old man with long, golden hair; his voice was aged but powerful.

“You heard what he said. He’s a mere human being, and yet he speaks about the Ancestral God with such contempt, thus violating the order of gods. Don’t say that I’m disrespecting the Heaven Path Institute. I’ve shown you enough face by not dealing punishment for your student’s crass mistake!” The intimidating face became even somberer.

There was a slight change in the golden-haired elder’s expression, as he also knew that Su Ping was in the wrong. Disdaining Ancestral Gods was the greatest crime in the Archean Divinity; their dignity was above everything.

“He’s just a junior; don’t be too hard on him, Emperor Ye. I think it was just a slip of the tongue; he didn’t mean it. I’m willing to apologize on his behalf,” said the golden-haired elder.

The intimidating face snorted. “Apologize? How are you going to apologize?”

“How about I sever my own arm? I won’t fix it for as long as I live!” said the old man calmly.

Such a proposal left Su Ping in a daze. That old man, whom he had never met before, was willing to take the blame for him?

A permanently severed arm was too great a price for him to deserve.

“Senior, you…”

Su Ping quickly tried to intervene and stop him; he didn’t want any of his benefactors to get hurt.

He didn’t want good people to suffer any losses.

As for the bad people—he would be ten times more obnoxious than them.

That was just who Su Ping was.

Even if he died, he would still be able to resurrect. He could always try to sneak in later if he ended up being hunted in the Archean Divinity and couldn’t stay there longer.

Besides, he didn’t expect that his mockery would attract the ultimate expert of the Rain Clan. The guy was unimaginably strong, and could probably kill Celestials with ease!

Even so, he wasn’t regretful; his only concern was that the humans in the Archean Divinity would be punished for his actions.

The golden-haired elder shook his head and interrupted Su Ping, “Kid, say no more. You are a disciple of the Heaven Path Institute; I will surely try my best to keep you safe.”

Su Ping’s ears were ringing, and his heart was burning.

Just because I’m a disciple of the Heaven Path Institute?

The whole world fell silent at that moment.

The intimidating face was quiet, as if considering.

At ground level—the people who had gone there for true knowledge were all shocked.

Is this the Heaven Path Institute?

A bigshot of the institute was willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of a student!

‘You are a disciple of the Heaven Path Institute; I will surely try my best to keep you safe!’

Such simple words carried a lot of weight!

Su Ping couldn’t even compare to one of the elder’s fingers in the eyes of some. Such an elder was surely an unparalleled expert, as he was able to confront the intruder.

Su Ping was then reminded of Joanna’s recounting. Back when the catastrophe burst out in the Archean Divinity, all the teachers and students of the Heaven Path Institute marched out and died in battle.

They had such unity because of people like that elder?

Their spirit had been passed on, and was never lost!

There was a long silence before the ominous face said, “This is none of your business. Why are you doing this? Is he worth it? This human brat will only cause more disasters. How many arms do you have?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Count mine, if his arms are not enough.”

Another old man with long purple-gold hair stepped out of the void. His back was hunched, but it seemed that he was standing at the center of the world!

“What do you mean by ‘not worth it’? He’s a student of the Heaven Path Institute, so we’ll guide him!” said the old man coldly.

The face in the sky became colder and said, “Fine! In that case, don’t blame me for not showing enough respect!”

“Say no more,” the first old man said calmly, then raised his arm, and lopped it off. There was a boom; golden blood, brilliant as starlight was bursting out.

Then, the wound stopped bleeding and turned into a scar.

He threw the severed arm toward the intimidating face. “Emperor Ye, it’s time to go back.”

Emperor Ye narrowed his eyes and gazed at the severed arm. He picked it up, and said after a moment of silence, “You have my admiration! However, this isn’t over; he must return the ultimate treasure that he took from the Rain Clan. I will also take him to be judged in our territory!”

“Do you have any evidence of such theft?” demanded the second old man coldly.

“Of course.”

Emperor Ye seemed to be prepared. He sneered and waved a hand, displaying images in the void. They were the scenes when Su Ping visited the Rain Clan earlier.

“These were extracted from the past. He visited the Rain Clan, and our ultimate treasure disappeared after he left. Does that count as evidence?” Emperor Ye snorted.

Both of the old men confronting him changed their expression, as they could tell that the scenes weren’t fake.

“Kid, have you really visited the Rain Clan?” asked the one-armed elder.

Su Ping clenched his fists, infuriated to see the missing arm. His chest was almost bursting, but he was still holding back. He nodded. “That’s right, I was there. But I didn’t steal any of their ultimate treasures.”
