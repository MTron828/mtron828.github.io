Chapter 1335 Impact on the Astral Nexus (2)

“I don’t like repeating myself, and I don’t like hearing others repeating themselves.”

Su Ping glanced at them coldly. “This is a threat; you may understand it that way. You might be angry, but you should know the rules of the universe: Strength is all that matters. Those of you who don’t obey… I will make you obey!”

“How can you have the same permissions as us?” The leader of the Black Desolation Star Zone regrew his arm. He looked at Kayafollet in shock and suspicion. “Did you change his clearances? Impossible. You didn’t have the chance nor the time.”

Kayafollet looked at Su Ping, equally shocked. The aura and power displayed by him was unbelievable.

It wasn’t because Su Ping was too powerful, but because he only had a level-7 permission on the Astral Nexus; he could only show Ascendant State power in a duel. All Celestials had a level-8 permission. They could wipe Su Ping out just with their higher permission and not be hurt in the slightest.

“Everything in this world has its own path; the Astral Nexus is just one of them. Nothing is impossible; if I understand enough paths, I can even suppress and kill you through the Astral Nexus!” said Su Ping coldly.

Su Ping had a newfound understanding about the universe after having experienced the Golden Crow ancestor’s world; everything in the world was a gathering of Dao. The signals and waves of the Astral Nexus had their own set of rules; if Su Ping had enough time to study them, he would be able to find their source and spread his consciousness anywhere in the universe through the Astral Nexus.

Also, he could transmit his power everywhere.

When Mu Shen declared the opening of the Universe Geniuses’ Contest, his voice echoed throughout the universe.

Su Ping would be able to manipulate all paths once he advanced to become a God Emperor and controlled a Dao Heart. That was how the alien moved in the worm tide; it could appear anywhere in the universe.

It was also the reason why Su Ping no longer dared to leave the store as easily.

Maybe the guy would detect him immediately after he left and then move to kill him.

......

Su Ping didn’t know whether or not he would one day become the guy’s target, but he preferred not to find out the answer by putting his life at risk.

“He affected the Astral Nexus with his strength and his understanding of Dao?” The other Celestials were quite shocked. They wouldn’t have believed it if they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes.

It almost seemed ridiculous.

However, the scene was real.

Shen Huang also looked at Su Ping in shock. He, of all people, knew that Su Ping had level-7 permission and it wasn’t fake. The attack really happened.

With a mere level-7 permission, Su Ping was able to injure the leader of the Black Desolation Star Zone who had Celestial-level permissions, which was impossible when logged to the Astral Nexus.

That wasn’t the real universe; it was impossible to beat someone of a higher level. Computational limitations couldn’t be escaped. Besides, all entities present were mere projections. In other words, not even the greatest power could be displayed there. The only reflection was the permission level set on the Astral Nexus.

“His Dao is affecting the Astral Nexus? Can this be real? If that is the case, my understanding of Dao is too shallow…” some Celestial mumbled.

“If Dao can influence matters of the universe, it makes sense that it can also influence the Astral Nexus… However, this has never happened before and nobody dares to think this way.”

If you mastered the path of fire, you would be able to go to the sun without being burnt; if you mastered the path of water, you would be able to create a river in space. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Dao could influence matter and create matter; it was the source of everything.

The thing was that nobody had ever thought of influencing the Astral Nexus.

“I hope to see a satisfactory situation in half a month.” Su Ping was curt, then he gave a cold glance at the attendees. He didn’t want to waste any more of his time on those Celestials.

His figure became blurry.

Su Ping left the meeting room.

Shen Huang and the others followed suit and left.

Everybody returned to the building. Chi Huo and Xu Kong looked at Su Ping in shock; they could sense that the latter was stronger than the average of the Celestial, but his power was beyond their understanding.

Is he truly an Ascendant??

“Right now, you’re far stronger than me,” said Shen Huang as he turned off his watch and looked at Su Ping in delight, “Although I didn’t teach you, we made the right decision. As long as you stay alive, we can work on buying you enough time. You will surely lead us to victory.”

“Master, don’t talk like that; you will always be my master.” Su Ping would never forget that his master’s original body had died for him; that was the ultimate favor, more than words could ever describe.

“Are you still in the Ascendant State? Or have you already risen to the Celestial State?” asked Chi Huo in a low voice.

“Still in the Ascendant State.”

Su Ping looked at them and suddenly thought of something. “You’ve been in the Celestial State for many years. Don’t you want to rise any higher?”

Stunned for a moment, Chi Huo said with a bitter smile, “Of course; we all dream to become universe dominators like the Primordial Empyrean Master. However, there’s not much information explaining that realm in the classics. We don’t have a clue about how to cultivate to that level.”

“We never knew for certain whether the Primordial Empyrean Master was a universe dominator. Maybe he was just stronger than us in the Celestial State,” added Xu Kong, “So, the universe dominator realm is just a legend. Maybe it’s achievable, and maybe it’s just a dream. It’s like how a mortal wants to ascend to the sky.”

Su Ping shook his head and said, “It’s neither a dream nor a legend. Universe dominators are not really something; there are even higher levels.”

“The universe dominator realm is not the end?” All of them were stunned.

Even Kayafollet—who had just logged off from the Astral Nexus—was equally stunned. She couldn’t help but glance at Su Ping; she knew that there was a mysterious store supporting him, so he probably acquired privileged information there.

“Universe dominators are still too far away from the real destination,” said Su Ping. Compared to the Golden Crows’ ancestor, universe dominators were basically babies.

“So… We’re still too far away from the final destination,” Chi Huo mumbled, not questioning what Su Ping said.

“Once you rise to the Celestial State and establish a universe, the goal is to cultivate your Dao Heart,” said Su Ping, “Once you find your Dao Heart, you’ll be able to rise to higher realms.”

“Dao Heart?”

All four of them were stunned.

“What’s a Dao Heart?” Xu Kong couldn’t help but ask. She stared at Su Ping with her beautiful eyes.

Su Ping glanced at her and said, “The Great Dao has wisdom; you may consider the Dao Heart as the Dao’s soul. Only after you grasp a Dao Heart can your universe be integrated and enhanced.”

“Well…”

They looked at each other in bewilderment. They didn’t fully understand, but they started to get a tiny fraction.

“I can’t teach you too much, since I’m also in the exploring phase. You should consider this on your own,” said Su Ping.

Having seen the Golden Crow ancestor’s worlds and the three unparalleled Dao Hearts, Su Ping knew of the Dao Heart as well as God Emperors did. However, it was still hard to teach others.

If he was willing, he could establish a Dao Heart and rise beyond the Celestial State right then and there,

After all, he had carefully examined the three Dao Hearts presented by the ancestor. He refused to choose any of them only because he wanted to establish his own Dao Heart.

“I thought that becoming a Celestial would get us close to the end of our cultivation journey; I didn’t know we were so shortsighted,” Shen Huang remarked.

Su Ping glanced at his master and said, “I’ll be going back to the store. Next time I come out, I’ll help you recreate your universe and recover the power of your original body.”

Shen Huang felt dazed. “So quickly?”.

“I can do it right now, but it’ll be better when I return,” said Su Ping. Given his understanding of Dao and his current power, he was already able to help his master recover. However, he wanted to seize the opportunity to condense a more powerful universe for his master.
