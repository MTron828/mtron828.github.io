Chapter 945: Chaos Egg

Su Ping instantly imprinted the Prime Sky Mirror with his mind the moment he got it, all to secure his claim over it.

A vague connection was soon established between him and the mirror. It was a strange feeling, as if he had an additional organ outside his body.

Such a feeling was heightened when he concentrated.

Su Ping stored the mirror in his mind. It was an ancient treasure built with something that wasn’t a basic substance. Therefore, it could be kept inside Su Ping’s mind.

Then, Su Ping looked for the second treasure.

Suddenly, he saw a bubble with an egg inside.

“Unknown Egg!”

That was the name displayed in the description. The rest of the information was simple too; it had been found in an ancient relic, but neither the equipment nor the top trainers of the Federation had been able to tell what creature the egg belonged to. No relevant genetic information could be found.

Not even extinct creatures had a similar aura.

More than seventy thousand years had passed ever since the egg entered the Heavenly Star Pavilion. Many master trainers had tried to hatch it, but none had managed to succeed.

Due to its special conditions, it was listed as a heaven-level treasure.

After all, a treasure whose background was completely unknown in the universe deserved to be known as a heaven-level treasure.

However, the egg had never been picked because it could be neither identified nor hatched, and the other treasures had mostly been picked and replaced by new ones as soon as they were presented to the Heavenly Star Pavilion.

Su Ping was truly surprised once he saw the egg.

Su Ping found the egg’s information through the Illustrated Book for All Pets that the system had given him. There was a path beast inside!

What were path beasts?

They had rarely appeared, even considering the long history of the entire universe, mainly because it was hard to procreate!

That was the most ancient beast!

It was a life born at the beginning of the universe, with thousands of paths inside its body. It was the evolution and manifestation of paths!

The creature was known as the Chaos Beast during ancient times!

It was born in the age of chaos, right when the universe was established at first!

Some said that the beast was immeasurably strong, able to master thousands of paths. To top it off, it was beyond rare to find one!

It’s the egg of a path beast. Am I mistaken, or are my eyes deceiving me??Su Ping was greatly shocked. He knew that the ancient Chaos Beast was a hundred times more rare and terrifying than the Golden Crows.

Even the grandmasters during primordial times had actually craved to tame giants such as the Chaos Beast!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the beast ranked in the top five among all pets in existence!

It might not be the very best, but it was still remarkable to be among the top five. Any path beast and above would be enough to shock the Federation if it emerged. Even Celestials would be stupefied.

Only Su Ping—who had been shocked by the system again and again—was able to take in the information in stride.

“This is unbelievable. Oh my god…” Su Ping exclaimed with a pounding heart.

The egg of a path beast, which ranked in the top five of all creatures since the beginning of the universe, was right before his eyes.

More importantly, he knew how to hatch it!

It had to be noted that he was a trainer taught by the all-reaching system!

He knew why nobody had been able to hatch the egg. None of them had been able to find Chaos aura!

The beast had been brought forth by chaos; it could not grow without absorbing Chaos aura, which was the very thing Su Ping used to hatch pets in his store!

This meant that the beast would be hatched the moment it was thrown into the Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation!

The authorities of the Federation would have never placed the egg in the Heavenly Star Pavilion if they knew what it was. Not even the whole bunch of treasures held here would amount to what this egg is worth!

Su Ping was really excited. He felt fortunate to have seen the egg before having chosen his three treasures, or he wouldn’t have been able to take it away, even if he saw it later on. It would be practically impossible to get another chance to visit the pavilion to take it.

He was about to take the egg away, but then he suddenly remembered that Mo Tianhua had talked to a spirit in the building. This meant that the spirit was certainly keeping an eye on him.

It would be seen as abnormal for him to act passionately before the egg.

Su Ping instantly suppressed his enthusiasm. It was fortunate that he had already become more sophisticated after years of fighting. His emotions weren’t too evident, despite his shocked heart.

He currently wandered around the egg, observing it as if intrigued.

A long time of hesitating passed before he finally placed a badge on the egg.

The hibernation bubble cracked soon after, and the egg floated in front of Su Ping.

The Federation’s equipment had detected signs of life. It had not perished, even after seventy thousand years had passed. Su Ping also knew that it was barely possible for such an egg to be broken. Even an Ascendant would have to work hard to break the shell!

Su Ping held the egg in his hand and observed it for a moment, then placed it in his storage.

He was caught in a dilemma at the moment.

He would have to abandon one of the other two treasures he had laid eyes on.

Su Ping decided after pondering for a moment.

He didn’t go to see the treasures he had pre-selected; instead he kept on wandering in the pavilion’s space.

The egg wasn’t included on the list with 89 treasures Shen Huang had given him, so he didn’t know about it earlier. He then thought that there might be more interesting treasures to see.

However, his luck seemed to have run out, as he spent a whole day examining the place. He didn’t find anything surprising.

He did find some rare treasures that had not been included in his master’s list, but none could compare to the egg.

In the end, he chose one of the treasures that he had picked in advance.

He had to admit that the 89 treasures Shen Huang had listed were indeed the most rare and suitable for him.

Some of the other treasures he found were also very powerful, but most had harsh requirements; they wouldn’t be too useful for him.

“Blood Cloud Sword!”

Unlike the Prime Sky Mirror which was for supportive purposes, the sword was an ultimate weapon!

The mirror could be used to keep himself safe, so he still thought that he could use a good sword.

As for the rest of the stuff, the system could later provide it.

The Blood Cloud Sword was the weapon of a devil who had lived in the age of the Twilight Deity King. It was entirely red, with dark, bloody stripes on its surface. Those stripes were actually part of the wood grain!

The sword was made of wood!

However, that was perhaps the hardest wooden sword in the world!

The weapon had been made of wood taken from the world tree. It was said that the bloody stripes had been caused by an unknown type of blood from ancient times. It had kept such an appearance ever since the devil obtained it.

The sword was able to store an extraordinary amount of faith and divine powers. It could rip apart many fields and destroy many materials.

It could be used to neutralize spells, as well as to kill or suppress enemies!

The only shortcoming was that the wielder would be constantly affected by the unholy power within the sword, who could eventually end up becoming mentally deranged. It was said that the devil who acquired the sword used to be a deity.

The tale was recorded in a journal, right where the sword was found.

I’ve been using the Little Skeleton’s bone saber. It’s indeed sturdy, but it’s not destructive enough. This sword can increase my damage output, and I’ll be able to resist Ascendant-level attacks if it can store divine power. Of course, I would only resist one strike,?Su Ping thought.

The heaven-level treasures were truly powerful.

Su Ping was done, as he could not select more than the three treasures he already had. However, right before leaving he openly sighed in regret as he looked at one of the floating treasures. He took out the egg as if wavering, but then he sighed again and left the Heavenly Star Pavilion while carrying the egg.

Whether or not the spirit was observing him, he decided to act it out as an attempt to fool it.

…

He saw that the others were waiting for him as soon as he got out.

All of them had jealous eyes when they saw him.

It wasn’t until after they saw the treasures inside the pavilion that they realized how precious Su Ping’s privilege was!

However, they didn’t lose control because of jealousy, nor did they think of robbing him; they weren’t idiots. Considering how strong he was at the moment, considering the treasures he had just picked and Shen Huang’s protection, he would be technically unkillable once he became a Star Lord!

Of course, there were destructive weapons in the Federation that could even annihilate Star Lords. However, such weapons were highly restricted, and their sources could be tracked down.

I feel that the gap between us is even greater.?It was the thought of many, who sighed and moaned.

Su Ping was already the champion of the universe.

He had surely become even stronger than them after getting more treasures.

They would need a fair deal of luck if they were to catch up with him.

“Have you picked your treasures? We’ll be heading back soon,” said Mo Tianhua, glancing at Su Ping.

Su Ping nodded. “I have.”

“Let’s go.”

Mo Tianhua instantly took them away.

“Young brother, keep in touch!” cried out the white-haired old man.

Su Ping looked back at the latter and smiled.

The spaceship sailed away right after.

The vessel passed through the spatial blockade through the long bridge, finally entering the area where it could fly freely.

“We’ll be taking you to the Gamma Space Station. You can head home from there,” Mo Tianhua said to the whole group.

The Gamma Space Station was a super massive, interstellar teleportation station that could enable anyone to jump to any galaxy within a billion light years.

No one disagreed. It was indeed time for them to say goodbye.

Luo Ying turned around and said to Su Ping solemnly, “I’ll catch up and be on par with you next time we meet!”

“Me too,” said Six Lives Buddha with a smile, eagerness showing in his eyes.

“I hope we’ll have a chance to fight,” Lilian also chimed in.

Su Ping smiled after hearing them. “I’m also looking forward to our next encounter.”

The others wore complicated expressions, while being all sighs; they were too weak to issue a challenge like the others.

Inside the spaceship—Su Ping entered the virtual world via his phone.

He soon found Tang Ruyan among his contacts and reached out to her.

“Gamma Space Station.” Su Ping reported the name of the place and asked them to wait there.

Several days later… Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Gamma Space Station—

Rushing spaceships were everywhere, moving to and fro in the galaxy nearby. Most were cruises for travelers, while some were business spaceships.

Right at the center of that swarm of spaceships was a splendid and beautiful space station.

The Gamma Space Station had quite the luxurious appearance. Most new visitors would be amazed by its grandeur; after all, not many were as large.

Su Ping noticed a planet relatively close to the space station when they arrived.

Obviously, the planet was much bigger and conspicuous when compared to any of the spaceships.

Su Ping’s lips curved up. He somehow remembered O’Neil’s frustrated face.

“Why is a planet here?”

“Weird. I’ve been to the Gamma Space Station before. There shouldn’t be a planet here.”

Aboard the spaceship—many people noticed the planet.

A genius’s protector looked at the planet and remarked, frowning, “An Ascendant brought the planet over.”

Even though Ascendants had many privileges in the universe, it was still rare for them to do something like this.

“The planet is not hindering any teleportation; the local garrison would have taken action by now if it were the case,” said someone amongst the group.

Su Ping looked at Mo Tianhua and coughed. “Senior, can I go to that planet? My friend is waiting for me there.”

Mo Tianhua: “?”

The latter was speechless as his eyes shifted from the planet to Su Ping. He could not believe that the planet was there because of him.

The others were also surprised by Su Ping’s request. Then, they found it understandable.

Mo Tianhua remained silent. He waved his hand, and the spaceship approached the planet.

The rest of the geniuses could only look at each other in silence after seeing how accommodating Mo Tianhua was towards Su Ping. Even a Heavenly Lord was being extra friendly as he interacted with the genius who had condensed a small world in the Fate State.

None of them would have gotten such a treatment had they tried.
