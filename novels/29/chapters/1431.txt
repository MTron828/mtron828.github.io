Chapter 1432 Leader (2)

The revelation gave the man a shock. Su Ping, who was barely a Celestial, actually helped him become a universe dominator… That was like an elementary school student teaching a college student!

All of Su Ping’s information and history popped up in Chi Ying’s head, suddenly realizing that the boy had always been fighting and killing enemies stronger than him. He was an unparalleled genius he couldn’t understand with common sense.

What will happen when he becomes a universe dominator? Chi Ying thought. He looked at Su Ping and said, “That immortal body was in the Undying State, and still, such a great figure was reduced to that miserable condition. There must be higher levels above the Undying State, right?”

“Yes. That should be the end of our cultivation path,” said Su Ping, “It’s also the ultimate goal of all cultivators.”

!!

“The end of cultivation…” Chi Ying mumbled. He suddenly had an uncanny urge. Only a level separated him from that state. Who wouldn’t want to see the view at the end of all cultivation?

Although he knew he probably didn’t have the necessary potential, he felt a strong desire, craving to cultivate and get stronger.

“Off you go. I need to enter secluded training now; I’ll ask for someone else next time I come out,” said Su Ping.

Chi Ying snapped out of his reverie and quickly said, “Boss Su, I’ll always remember your favor. It was stupid of me to have offended you in the past. Please forgive me!”

“That’s all in the past,” said Su Ping, waving a hand in dismissal.

Chi Ying was greatly relieved. He said with a smile, “Thank you, Boss Su. I won’t bother you anymore then. Goodbye.”

“All right.”

Su Ping nodded.

He received a message from Shen Huang right after leaving the store; the latter asked him to go to the palace.

He vaguely guessed something and simply flashed over.

Chi Ying reached the palace soon after. Lots of barriers had been set up outside the palace; strong enough to fend off Celestial attacks. However Chi Ying found them as vulnerable as paper at the moment; he could tear them apart with the slightest effort.

He heaved a sigh, knowing he was no longer who he used to be. Still, he didn’t let this go to his head; after all, the other Celestials in the palace would reach his level sooner or later.

Chi Ying entered the palace, then saw that all the other Celestials were there. They never left.

“Were you all waiting for me?” Chi Ying couldn’t help but smile.

He could imagine how curious and apprehensive were the others about the

matter.

“You…”

Shen Huang sized him up with astonishment on his face.

The other Celestials were just as shocked. The palace was caught in a brief silence. Moments later, one of them finally made a prudent question, “Have you… succeeded?”

Chi Ying was emitting such an oppressive aura that none of them dared to speak as freely as before.

“Yes. I’ve received Boss Su’s Dao Heart and became a universe dominator,” said Chi Ying with a smile. He used to be taciturn, but he himself felt he had become much more approachable. Even Chi Huo, his old nemesis, was no longer as disagreeable as in the past.

“Just as I expected…”

“Universe dominator… He really did it!”

“I feel like I’m facing that member of the Heavens again…”

All the Celestials were mumbling in shock. Chi Ying’s transformation was too great. It left a deep impact on them.

“B-Boss Su was able to make one of us turn into a universe dominator so quickly. What kind of terrifying being is he exactly?” asked one of the Celestials all of a sudden.

The others narrowed their eyes. They discovered, to their surprise, that the answer was beyond the limits of their imagination.

Chi Ying chuckled upon noticing their reactions; he was just as shocked as them earlier on. He said, “I asked Boss Su. The universe dominator realm is not that impressive. There’s still the Undying State above it, and after that is the true final destination of us cultivators. It means that I’m still an apprentice working my way up. I’m still far from the top!”

Everyone exchanged bewildered looks. Shen Huang had mentioned that state earlier, but they only believed it until that very moment.

“If you’re just an apprentice while being a universe dominator, then what are we? Worms?” said a Celestial with a bitter tone.

“I think it’s better to call ourselves trash,” said Chi Huo.

Everybody flashed helpless smiles, mulling over the matter with mixed feelings. They had previously taken themselves to be the top life forms, while the universe dominator realm was just a legend. They finally realized that they were no different from the mortals they looked down upon when in the presence of real experts.

“Chi Ying, how many of us do you think you can defeat at once?” asked Xu Kong, curious about Chi Ying’s improved combat ability. They all sensed that the latter’s transformation was great and terrifying, but they wanted to know the specifics.

“You?”

Dazed, Chi Ying noticed the curiosity in their eyes. He felt amused by it, and answered with a smile, “One hand.”

“You mean five?” Everybody was stunned.

“No.” Chi Ying shook his head. “I can beat you all with just one hand.”

They answered with dumbfoundment and silence.

None of them thought that Chi Ying was bragging, since the guy was indeed emitting an ominous, abyssal aura. Even though he was just standing there, they felt they had been put in a cage with a ferocious beast, and were unconsciously suppressing a bone-deep fear.

Besides, the universe dominator realm was the Heavens’ level. They had seen those creature’s combat ability, which was too high for them to withstand as they were.

“The cultivation path is long and hard. We haven’t even embarked on it yet,” said one of the Celestials, feeling disappointed.

“I hope I’m next. I can’t wait to experience this kind of power,” said Chi Huo, clenching his fist.

His whole body was itchy, seeing his old nemesis relishing in the spotlight.

Chi Ying smiled, still silent. He merely said to Shen Huang later, “You should all get ready. I can take care of moving the planet for now; you can replace me next time one of you advances. I can figure out a way to avoid the Heavens if we encounter them.”

Shen Huang nodded. “You can take the wheel then.”

“Right, didn’t you have to transcend the Heavenly Tribulation to break through?” asked one of the men present.

Chi Ying put on a mysterious smile and said, “I did, but it’s not a Heavenly Tribulation.”

“You did?”

Everybody was dumbfounded. None of them saw any signs of a tribulation.

“You’ll know when the time comes.” Chi Ying didn’t elaborate. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

All of them huffed and snorted, seeing that the fellow was acting all mysterious, but they didn’t ask. They were Celestial cultivators; none of them were stupid. They could guess that it probably had something to do with Su

Ping.

Back in the pet store, Su Ping picked Ascendant State pets that required professional training and entered the Archean Divinity.

After randomly appearing in the void, Su Ping hid himself in the Original Dao World where he wouldn’t be detected, then spread out his senses and soon found a city, hundreds of thousands of kilometers away.

He entered the city and figured out its name. Based on a map he obtained from the Heaven Path Institute, he then looked for the most prosperous metropolis nearby.

He then snuck into the metropolis and investigated.

Very soon, in an intelligence agency found in that metropolis-Su Ping learned some news about the Rain Clan, but there weren’t any updates about the Ancestral Gods.

Obviously, the news about the Ancestral Gods wasn’t something to be publicly discussed.

However, the Rain Clan doesn’t seem to be on full alert because of me…

Based on the intelligence he bought, Su Ping learned that many deployed experts of the Rain Clan had been contacted to return home. It was said that something huge had happened.

It seemed to be a normal action, but he still sensed that something was unusual.

He had already escaped from the Rain Clan’s grasp; they would have sent out people to search for him. Why were they recalled? Were they afraid he would return? They couldn’t be defending against the Heaven Path Institute either.

The Ancestral God has already woken up; he probably won’t go back to sleep so soon. After all, such a huge thing happened and he even returned defeated. If I were him, I’d be furious for a while…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He thought of an explanation: The Rain Clan recalled its members probably because the clan’s Ancestral God was away at the moment!
