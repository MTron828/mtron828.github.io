Chapter 1417 Emperor Among Kings (2)

Yan Qing and the others were furious. “You’re fighting unfairly. Do you really deserve to be called a high-ranked clan?”

That being said, they knew that-although they were having a conflict with the Rain Clan

– it could escalate into a conflict between the Heaven Path Institute and all the clans if they didn’t handle it well.

All in all, the Heaven Path Institute was just a school with students of many clans.

!!

However, the Rain Clan somehow represented the other high-ranked clans. Many gods were unsatisfied with the Heaven Path Institute having such a special status; they could even try to start a war of Ancestral Gods with this excuse, which would be terrible. That was the main reason why the elders had been giving in.

“Rain Emperor, I’ll say this one more time: The Dao Child cannot die!” Yan Qing glared at the Rain Emperor coldly.

“I’ll say this one time too: He must die!” The latter stared back at her, not stepping back in the slightest.

Yan Qing knew there was no room for negotiation, so she suddenly decided to act. Divine light surged from her body like a tide; she gathered her small universe and hurled it at the Rain Emperor.

None of the other elders backed off. How could they let such a Dao Child die? He had the potential to become an Ancestral God. The institute would be humiliated if the boy were to perish.

While they fought-Su Ping was surrounded and fighting bitterly at the moment. It was the first time for him to be attacked by so many emperors and suppressed by the power of so many universes; he felt the pressure of being completely outnumbered. All those emperors were extremely seasoned warriors. Their teamwork was neat, mutually augmenting each other’s power and the improvement was significant.

Su Ping swung his sword furiously. He was instantly covered in blood; however, some emperors were also hurt by him.

Swoosh.

Lin Tianzhan-who had been observing the battle thus far-suddenly took action.

Su Ping was already losing like a cornered beast, but he didn’t wait for the others to finish him off. Rather, the expert suddenly launched an attack.

His spear was like a star from a place beyond the sky. The move was abrupt and instantaneous.

Su Ping was hit in the back. He had always kept an eye on the emperor who had merely been observing the battle; however, he was momentarily distracted during the chaotic battle and the guy seized the opportunity.

The feeling of being shattered surged on Su Ping’s back. He gritted his teeth with bloodshot eyes, suddenly clenching the spear from his chest and pulling forward.

Lin Tianzhan slightly changed his expression, not expecting that he would fail to shatter the human with that surprise attack; the guy’s body was harder than expected. Still, it was even more surprising that Su Ping’s first reaction was to take away his weapon.

He snorted and unleashed his power. Even more violent energy darted out of the spear, ready to tear that human’s body apart.

Su Ping, however, didn’t let go. He endured the tearing pain and looked even scarier.

“Ahhhhhhh…!”

Su Ping was wreathed in flames. The Golden Crow flames and the Heavenly Fire appeared at the same time and were almost melting his surroundings. The scorching heat made all the other emperors feel hot, as if their universes were on fire. Surprise made them stop.

Dao Patterns appeared on Su Ping’s arms at the same time. The brutal strength of a Primitive Chaos Clan member erupted. The power received from the ancient corpse was completely shattered by the spear and filled Su Ping’s body.

The Great Dao surrounding Su Ping became lethally violent. It actually tore Lin Tianzhan’s hands open and revealed the bones inside!

Considering the Dao Patterns etched on the bones, Lin Tianzhan’s body was very close to attaining a Dao Body.

“Drop it!!” Su Ping roared furiously. With his body on the line, he fought a tug-of-war and pulled the long spear out of his chest, gaining control over it.

Lin Tianzhan changed his expression in shock and fury. It was degrading for an emperor to lose his weapon to someone else.

But at the last moment—the flesh on his arms evaporated and only the bones remained. He was unable to persist any longer. He lost the strength competition!

“F*ck off!!”

Su Ping seized the spear and then brutally sent it back to his attacker.

The spear let out a noise that was reminiscent of a nuclear explosion. It knocked Lin Tianzhan away with a terrifying light. The scorching flames were like Su Ping’s boiling fury. He was covered in blood, and there was a huge hole on his chest. While soaking in the intertwining flames of the Heavenly’s and the Golden Crow’s fires, he looked around with infinite ferocity in his eyes.

He quickly locked onto the emperors who had set up the Four Emperors Blood Array, and charged towards them.

To flush out all enemies, he had to finish off from the weakest.

Emperor Gui was so frightened to see Su Ping move towards him that his first reaction was to run back to the mountains and hide behind the barrier.

After all, the barrier had been personally set up by their Ancestral God, just in case someone would destroy the clan while he was asleep.

If the barrier was broken, the Ancestral God would sense it and wake up. The other emperors from the Rain Clan didn’t pass judgment. They hurriedly approached him, fearing that another emperor would perish. Su Ping robbed Lin Tianzhan of his weapon, which was an eye-opener. They knew that Emperor Gui couldn’t resist Su Ping, at all. That junior was only a God King back then, but he was as strong as a God Emperor!

Like a serpent, a long whip darted over from a place in the high sky, like a serpent. It stretched infinitely and was about to tie him

up.

Holding Lin Tianzhan’s weapon, Su Ping suddenly slashed at the whip. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When the weapons collided, The latter immediately sensed a swallowing power that was resisting his blast at the moment. The next moment, he was slapped away by the whip, missing the opportunity to chase Emperor Gui.

“Huh?”

Su Ping detected the will in the blade; its soul was resisting him.

“Don’t try to restrain me!”

A stubborn thought was originated, originating from the blade like a ferocious beast. An extremely ferocious soul had been sealed within. It was Lin Tianzhan’s weapon, which had fought by Lin Tianzhan’s side for years and developed its own pride.

Besides, Lin Tianzhan would be in a life-and-death partner. It was very hostile to the enemy who hurt its master.

“You are but a mere soul, and you think you can resist?”

Su Ping widened his eyes and blackness emerged from within; it showed the original aura from the ancient soul race. He clenched the spear and imposed a strong burst of power with it.

The soul inside the spear was instantly screaming in pain. Feeling Su Ping’s aura, it cried in fear. “What are you?”

Hardly did I say that when Su Ping imposed even more strength. It screamed even more miserably.

However… no matter how Su Ping tortured it, it simply screamed and continued to struggle with stubborness.

Su Ping slightly narrowed his eyes. That ancient emperor’s weapon was indeed not to be underestimated. He loosened his hand and snorted, “For your grit, I will use you as my temporary blade for now!”

“Don’t even think about it…”

The soul was still resisting, but the next moment-Su Ping’s universe power covered it and his Dao Heart branded it. The contract power erased the blood link between the soul and Lin Tianzhan.

The weapon’s resistance against Lin Tianzhan had weakened.
