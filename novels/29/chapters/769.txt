Chapter 771: Void Assassination

Boom!

Five vortices appeared and opened behind the red-haired young man; horrifying creatures stepped out of it.

Five battle pets, all in the Star State, emerged with the most daunting auras!

There was a dragon, a demon, an elemental pet... The dragon had deep red scales with multiple and sharp horns. It was magnificent and looked like a true T-Rex.

The demon was enshrouded in a black fog that seemed even darker than the tertiary space; it reeked of the stench of death.

The elemental pet was a golden tortoise that had sharp blades on its turtle. The blades looked like the fins on the backs of sharks and were very sharp.

Once the pets were summoned, the red-haired young man also activated his constitution. Red stripes appeared on his skin as if his body were ablaze. He turned into a burning man, and his eyes were filled with golden flames. The fire by his elbows looked like roaring wings.

“Merge!” the red-haired young man roared. The red-scaled dragon —which had unleashed her explosive aura—let out a roar.

Although sounds couldn’t be transmitted, the roar echoed in Su Ping’s head loud and clear, indicating that it wasn’t just a sound but also a mental attack.

After merging, the red-haired young man became even stronger; he became twice as tall, with dragon horns above his head. The flames on his skin were consolidated and covered him like lava, almost dripping.

Seeing that the red-haired young man got serious, the old man and the woman didn’t hesitate to summon their respective battle pets.

The white-robed old man had six Star State pets, and so did the woman. The space was instantly filled up by Star State auras. When a dozen Star State creatures gazed at someone, they were enough to paralyze battle pet warriors below the Star State.

The Star State creatures brutally looked down at Su Ping.

Su Ping instantly became as insignificant as a grain of dust.

“Thirteen...”

Su Ping looked at the pets, three of which had merged with his enemies. So, ten were left.

Every Star State pet was hundreds of meters tall, some even reaching a thousand meters. There were smaller ones only dozens of meters tall, but they were just as strong.

This is exactly why battle pet warriors are horrifying. The more advanced they are, the stronger they will be... Su Ping thought.

A battle pet warrior could hardly be defeated by a beast of their level. After all, they could summon multiple pets of the same level to outnumber their enemies.

“There’s still time if you’re willing to surrender and come with us.”

The old man—who had just merged with a pet that looked like a giant toad—had become fat, with green spots on his skin; it made him even uglier than before. He was so creepy that many people would be horrified after seeing him.

“Die!”

The black-haired woman was cold.

Her hair turned into sharp sabers and her fingers were like hooks. There were spikes all over her body; the pet she had merged with seemed to be a plant.

The black-haired woman charged at him as she talked, suddenly disappearing like a ghost would.

Flashing in the tertiary space would require you to tear into the deeper fourth space. However, the fourth space was so dangerous that even Star State experts were hardly able to break into or survive it.

The attempt could be very risky.

Su Ping slightly raised his eyebrows after she vanished, but he wasn’t nervous.

She didn’t tear the fourth space open.

Bang!

He didn’t look back; he simply turned around and punched at a certain place.

A blast was heard close to Su Ping’s back, where the black-haired woman suddenly appeared. Her sharp claws were bounced back by Su Ping’s fist; there was shock on her cold face.

She didn’t expect that her secret technique would be seen through.

The law she understood was part of the water class, which was called Mirror!

By using the Law of Mirror, she could project herself into any water drop that could reflect light and travel using reflections. It was almost like a flash movement.

Such a flash depended on water elements. However, Mirror was quite useful when moving in the tertiary space, where the normal flash was not optional.

Even though there was no water there, the spatial torrents were everywhere. She had combined the Law of Mirror with the mysteries of space and created a technique named Void Stealth; it was a powerful assassination skill that she was really proud of.

She could hide in space fragments, or travel among them!

Such a secret technique even allowed her to kill peak Star State experts if they were caught unaware!

Moments earlier, she had pretended to attack in front, but Su Ping saw it through and precisely predicted the place where she would appear. That was impossible!

They had never met before, and they didn’t know each other’s methods. The odds of a successful assassination were quite high under such circumstances!

Su Ping remarked casually as he looked at the shock on the woman’s face, “Why do you want to kill me so badly? Do you want to die?”

He didn’t stop acting while he talked. His sword appeared in his hand, and then he bent down and unleashed a strength boost and a super acceleration!

Slash!

He used several boosting skills related to the wind and lightning classes; they were the king-level skills able to accelerate them. His weight was almost reduced to zero when used at the same time, and all the objects in his eyes were slowed down. Then, he pointed his sword upwards!

A sword aura was drawn and accelerated halfway, cutting the target apart.

Pff!

Blood gushed out, and a piece of chin fell.

The black-haired woman retreated at the critical moment, disappearing into the torrents of space and leaving nothing but the splashing blood.

Su Ping turned around and looked. He saw the woman staggering out of a space fragment hundreds of meters away. Her chin had been cut off and her blood was flowing. Her tongue was slipping out due to lack of the chin’s support, which was quite horrifying.

Her previously pretty face had instantly become hideous.

Su Ping was quite calm. He was slightly regretful for not managing to kill her with his attack, but he hadn’t really tried his best anyway. After all, he hadn’t merged with his pet yet.

Is this the performance of the Star State level in the Federation? They are indeed much stronger than Nie Huofeng, and can probably kill him with ease... Su Ping thought.

Su Ping had developed a deeper understanding of the Star State through all the battles against Star State beasts in the Demigod Burial and the communication with the Star State God Warriors under Joanna’s command as he made his way over to the battlefields.

The Star State could be divided into three phases, namely the early, the middle and the advanced phases.

The top of the advanced phase would be the peak, which was only one step away from the Star Lord State.

To reach the mid phase of the Star State you had to master at least three laws, or have a deep understanding of one specific law.

As for the black-haired woman, Su Ping felt that she was as strong as beasts in the mid phase of the Star State. As for Nie Huofeng... He was probably in the early Star State phase. He was the weakest person in the Star State that Su Ping had ever seen.

Any of the Star State beasts in the Demigod Burial could have brutalized him.

After all, the Star State beasts had absorbed natural divine power in the Demigod Burial and were much stronger than the Star State beasts outside. Even if that black-haired woman merged with her pet, she could hardly defeat early Star State beasts in the Demigod Burial.

It seems that the battle techniques in the Federation aren’t as powerful as I thought...

Su Ping made a simple conclusion based on the woman’s attacks.

The woman then began to move crazily; green fluids appeared and quickly covered her body, forming a sort of spiky armor which resembled a sea urchin.

Su Ping remembered the pet equipment once he saw the armor; he was quite surprised that the pet equipment could be used while in a fused status.

The woman’s eyes became dark after putting on the pet equipment; then she emitted a dense, dark energy. She looked even more mysterious and unpredictable. Body tissue grew and quickly formed a new chin.

“Rot in hell!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The black-haired woman dashed and disappeared again. Then, she reappeared right on Su Ping’s left side. However, she also appeared on his right side before he even attacked.

Following that, she was also behind, below, above, and ahead of him at the same time; she was everywhere.

Each of the women was attacking using different techniques from different perspectives, making it impossible for Su Ping to either counterattack or dodge.

This is a remarkable battle technique.

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

They weren’t just normal clones, as they had been purely created by a battle technique.
