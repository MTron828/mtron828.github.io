Chapter 418 Above Average!

Su Ping was curious about the skills the dragon king’s soul mentioned that were a part of its legacy. As he sat on the back of the Golden Dragon Hound, Su Ping cast an identification skill on the pet.

Heaven Expansion Dragon Hound Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Property: Pet of the Dragon Family

Rank: Upper Position of the Sixth Rank

Combat strength: 14.2

Aptitude: Above Average Abilities mastered: Dragon Growl (legendary skill), Shadow Slaughter (legendary skill), Dragon Soul Elegy (legendary skill), Dragon Shape (legendary skill), Dragon Shield (legendary)...

Su Ping was stunned. He read the information a few more times and made sure he was seeing the same thing. What...? A combat strength of 14.2?! Above average?! Su Ping found it hard to believe. The Dark Dragon Hound’s combat strength was formerly at 9.9 but upon receiving the legacy, its combat strength had markedly increased by 4.3, rising above the ten point threshold!

It was close to the Little Skeleton on combat strength! Besides, the Golden Dragon Hound’s aptitude was at the moment rated as above average!

Something he had been earnestly longing for!

Not even the Little Skeleton had reached the above average rating. He didn’t anticipate that the Dark Dragon Hound would be the first to get this rating. While the Dark Dragon Hound was at the sixth rank, it already had strength equal to the legendary rank!

It was beyond logic and reason. How awesome this was! No one would believe this. If he had not been there to witness it with his own eyes, Su Ping would have never bought it!

The battle pet warriors who had just reached the legendary rank wouldn’t even be worthy opponents for the Golden Dragon Hound.

Those battle pet warriors would find that ridiculous. They–who had worked so hard to reach the legendary rank-would be helpless before a pet at the sixth rank. That was unfair.

Su Ping browsed through the pet’s newly added skills. The twelve of them were legendary rank skills, which was why the Dark Dragon Hound was rated as above average!

The scores of those legendary skills varied. The one with the highest score was a skill named “Sky Swallower” which had a score of 65. Three other skills had a score above 50.

“Those are all good skills. No wonder the Dark Dragon Hound’s combat strength has increased so dramatically,” Su Ping said to himself. But he had other questions. The dragon king was a creature above the legendary rank. There should be more powerful skills available.

Could it be that some skills were temporarily sealed and the pet had yet to assimilate them?

The more Su Ping thought about it, the more convinced he was of this explanation. After all, those high-level skills couldn’t be comprehended immediately. Even if the Golden Dragon Hound could comprehend them, it would be incapable of using them. They would be of no use for a while. This had to be the reason. Either way, Su Ping was more than glad to see the great change in his pet. Also, the fact that the Dark Dragon Hound had an aptitude of above average had solved a major problem for him.

Finally, training advanced battle pets could be made available in the store.

That was to say... he could make money ten times faster than before!

All in all, this was a rewarding trip that even legendary battle pet warriors would be jealous of. Glad with this outcome, Su Ping patted the Golden Dragon Hound’s horns. “Since your bloodline has changed to that of the Heaven Expansion Dragon and you’re not categorized as a battle pet of the dragon family, I have to come up with another name for you. How about... Doggie?”

The Golden Dragon Hound growled to show its dissatisfaction. Su Ping received that feedback. He thought about it and understood that he should be more open to suggestions. “You have the bloodline of a dragon but you’re not quite a dragon yet. I can add another word in your name in light of that fact. You will be Doggie Junior!”

“Woof, woof, woof...”

The Golden Dragon Hound barked out some sharp words but then quieted down after a share of Su Ping’s fists.

...

The Golden Dragon Hound ran along the highway. Soon, Su Ping had returned to the explorers’ base outside the Longjiang Base City and from there, he went back to the base city.

He was stopped by the guards at the border. Su Ping logged onto the official website of the explorers and used the user information to show his identity. The guards were stunned still to see that he was a gold-medal explorer because they had never seen one so young Regardless of the fact that Su Ping was a gold-medal explorer, the guards cautioned Su Ping that he couldn’t ride on such a large battle pet in the base city. Since the Golden Dragon Hound had grown to be over a dozen meters long, it was qualified to be counted as a large battle pet. Su Ping had to let the Golden Dragon Hound use the Dragon Form skill so that it could fly. The Dragon Form skill was a legendary skill. By using the skill, the Golden Dragon Hound’s body shape changed. Its limbs shortened while its body lengthened. It changed into a dragon that was about thirty meters long, a Heaven Expansion Dragon without wings. The Golden Dragon Hound still looked different from a real Heaven Expansion Dragon but it was similar. While in dragon form, it could use many basic skills of the Heaven Expansion Dragon, such as riding on a cloud.

Whoosh!

Doggie Junior growled and flew up to the sky in an instant, disappearing amid the stares of the astonished guards. Su Ping looked down at the base city and exclaimed, “In some way, Doggie Junior, you are a flying ride that is already at the legendary rank.” For him, the legendary rank creatures were something out of his reach. But at the moment, they were well within his reach. As a matter of fact, there was one under him. How things had changed. The Golden Dragon Hound barked as a reply. It sounded like a perfunctory reply as if still obsessing over the name.

Soon enough, Su Ping had arrived at the shantytown area. He could see the Taohuaxi Street. Su Ping retrieved the Golden Dragon Hound which was too large to fit in the store.

Having done that, Su Ping landed outside the store. When he was about to reach the ground, he mobilized some astral powers under his feet and a puff of air softened his landing. There were only a few people outside on the street. Su Ping was surprised. There had been many reporters out there before. He noticed that the blood stains on the ground had been cleaned up. The buildings that had collapsed during the previous battle had already been repaired. The materials of the building were specially made stones that were quite firm. It was clear that some advanced battle pets of the stone family were used for the rebuilding process. Su Ping gazed at the closed door. He could see into the store by using mental power. Tang Ruyan and Su Lingyue were sitting on the couch, having some snacks and chatting. The two seemed to be getting along. Su Ping walked up the stairs and opened the door.

“Su Ping?”

The two of them turned around.

Right away, Su Lingyue happily ran to meet him. “Where have you been? You were gone for five days. I would have thought that something had happened to you if Yuyan hadn’t told me that you were out for some business.”

“Five days?”

How unexpected. Su Ping didn’t quite feel the passage of time in that world. Five days had passed in reality?

“That is so long. Is mom worried?” Su Ping asked in a hurry.

Su Lingyue shook her head. “I told her that you were out on business.”

Su Ping breathed in relief and patted her head. “Nicely done.”

Tang Ruyan sized up Su Ping with a curious eye. She could feel that Su Ping seemed to be more powerful than before after only five days had passed. There was something unspeakable about him as well. If she had to find a word, she would say that he was noble, like a person of high standing. “Are the treasures from the Tang family here?” Su Ping asked Tang Ruyan. Tang Ruyan nodded. “Yes. They delivered the treasures here the second day after you left. They left the things here since you were away. They have found a place to live in the base city for now. The government helped them find accommodation. I can tell them to come here if you want.”

Su Ping nodded. “How about the Star Organization?”

“Same, they came the day after you left,” Tang Ruyan said. She darted a look at Su Ping. In this world, no one but the legendary battle pet warriors would have the Star Organization and the Tang family waiting respectfully by the door to deliver treasures.

Although Su Ping wasn’t at the legendary rank yet, he could compare with one! Su Ping nodded. The two parties were sensible. If he were forced to go to their doors and ask for the treasures, a fight would definitely ensue, and he would have to kill and bring about bloodshed again. “Did anything happen to the big families of the city? Why isn’t there anyone outside the store? Did something happen?” Su Ping sat down on the couch and asked. “The families came the day after you left as well. Their family heads came in person and left behind many gifts for you.

“Besides, the mayor also came to visit you.

“That battle created quite a disturbance. The entire Longjiang Base City knows that there is someone powerful in your store. Many people speculated that there is some legendary battle pet warrior here but no one can confirm that.

“The mayor left you a message. Would you want him to seal the information?

“The street now is a restricted area and no one can come here casually. The mayor has done that for fear that people might offend you.” Tang Ruyan gave a detailed account of the events that had happened.

Su Ping was speechless. If no one is allowed to come here, how could I conduct business?

The mayor was doing more harm than good with his excessive measures.

“The thing between you and the Star Organization is still a secret but your battle against our Tang family has become known by some of the families.” With a complicated feeling, Tang Ruyan said, “That is, the other three ancient families that are like our Tang family. All of them have issued you an invitation, hoping that you could visit them and befriend you.”

Su Ping shook his head. “No need. I just want to do my business quietly.”

Tang Ruyan curled her lips. Doing your business quietly? The forces you have upset are enough to turn the world upside down in the Longjiang Base City! But inwardly, Tang Ruyan was relieved. She had been in low spirits because of what happened with the Tang family. After all, that was where she had been living for over twenty years, her family, her root in the world.

That root was not ideal but she would miss it every now and then.

Deep in her heart, she still saw herself as a member of the Tang family. Therefore, if Su Ping were to befriend other families, the Tang family would be at a disadvantage. The other families would make use of Su Ping’s leverage to cannibalize the Tang family. More so, those families would secretly sow discord between Su Ping and her family. For the Tang family, that would be quite dangerous.

“Right, one more thing.”

Tang Ruyan suddenly remembered something. She took out a letter. “This is an invitation from the Trainers Association. The pet training service of your store has been widely promoted in the Longjiang intranet. The Trainer Association has noticed that. They hope that they can invite the trainer in your store to visit their headquarters and teach a lesson. They are meaning to invite your store’s trainer to join the Trainers Association.”

Trainers Association?

Su Ping took over the letter. The sealing wax was still on the envelope. The envelope was golden in color and looked quite elegant. The title was ‘Trainers Association of the Subcontinent District’.

Su Ping opened the letter and browsed through the content. Tang Ruyan was basically accurate. The letter was an invitation for him to participate in a trainers’ seminar.
