Chapter 1359 Food Crisis (2)

After a moment of silence, Shen Huang said, “I’ve already done some calculations. Considering the fertile planets and food storage we have in the Celestial Court, it would only be possible to sustain all the star zones’ population for 120 years.

“But, if we transform the worm bodies, or the meteors, or the desolate planets, we won’t be short of food in the next three hundred years, considering our efficiency.”

Everyone became thoughtful upon hearing what Shen Huang said.

300 years was a long time for ordinary people, but it was just a blink for them.

“Will the war end in 300 years?” whispered someone, looking at Su Ping.

Su Ping didn’t know the answer. After all, the alien race behind the worms seemed to carry a lot of secrets and was never willing to take action. No one was sure what they were afraid of.

“Birth rates will definitely plummet during the catastrophe. The population will probably shrink by half in 300 years. The 300 years’ worth of food might actually last for 500 years,” said Xu Kong.

Shen Huang looked at her and slightly shook his head. “I’ve already taken that into account. The 300 year span is taking the birthing drop into consideration.”

Xu Kong slightly changed her expression, not expecting the situation to be as dire.

Nobody was confident of finishing off the worms in 300 years.

After all, none of the Celestials dared to openly take action. Judging by the reconnaissance, the worms came from a place beyond the universe; they had no way of knowing how many more would appear.

“Just hang in there. I’ll think of a solution for the food problem,” said Su Ping.

Everybody immediately turned to look at Su Ping. They all knew that this young man, who had appeared out of nowhere, was the bearer of great secrets.

“What are you going to do?” probed one of the Celestials. He didn’t sound as angry as before, as he feared he would infuriate the young man. Su Ping said indifferently, “All in all, I’ll think of a way. I’m not joking; just carry out your duties. If you have more problems, let’s discuss them; if not, the meeting is over. Hurry with your preparations to join forces with us.”

Nobody else dared to ask further, seeing that Su Ping wasn’t willing to spend more time there. Based on his attitude, they didn’t think he was lying. Yes, his arrogant attitude chafed them, but also made them think that Su Ping was too proud to lie to them. They were rather reassured by Su Ping’s answers.

Some people were vipers, and others were tigers; Su Ping was clearly one of the latter. He was ferocious, but he never played dirty. They found that quite relieving.

Now that Su Ping wanted to leave, Shen Huang instantly said, “It’s settled then. The Celestial Court welcomes you; all of you will be seen as brothers, now that we’ll fight together. Although we had some grudges, I hope that we’ll stick together and take care of the worms, so that we may regain our freedom!”

Everybody was silent, choosing not to reply after his nice speech.

“We’ll talk about the other matter later and invite specialists to join us. Although we are Celestials, we might not be the most knowledgeable in every aspect,” said Shen Huang

Everybody nodded. What happened that day had a major impact on them and they needed time to digest everything.

Han Ji felt stunned after noticing their reaction; his heart was filled with sorrow. His master died. However, the whole thing seemed to have been settled after only a few simple words.

Indeed, he became an example to the others. But he was dead.

Han Ji found it absurd and hilarious that his master had died that easily.

“You can go too. You may get a copy of the meeting’s footage; we’ll figure out a way to help you with the evacuation,” Shen Huang said to Han Ji.

Han Ji’s heart was bitter; he lowered his head in frustration.

Very soon, the meeting was over. Everybody logged off.

Su Ping, Shen Huang and the others left the Astral Nexus; they woke up in Shen Huang’s room. Chi Huo saw that Su Ping opened his eyes and heaved a sigh. “Brother Su, you are truly awesome; I had already seen that when you killed the Saint King… But how did you kill Hei Huang remotely? Are you truly not a universe dominator?”

Xu Kong also gazed at Su Ping with her beautiful eyes, filled with curiosity.

.

“I really am not, but I’m halfway there. If your understanding of the Great Dao is deep enough, you’ll be able to do the same; it’s nothing surprising,” said Su Ping, “Time and space in this universe can be folded and even overlapped. What seems to be distances away might be in arm’s reach.”

“I don’t understand.” Chi Huo scratched his head.

Shen Huang had many conflicting feelings; what Su Ping said terrified him. How long has it been? Su Ping is already halfway to the universe dominator stage?

Given enough time, wouldn’t Su Ping surely become a universe dominator?

Xu Kong noticed it too. She looked at Su Ping with even more curiosity in her eyes. The guy had mysteriously distinguished himself out of the blue. Even though she was a Celestial herself, she was still quite interested in him.

However, she knew she wasn’t qualified to touch upon those secrets.

“I heard that one of the clerks in your store is a Celestial. Is that right?” asked Xu Kong all of a sudden.

Su Ping felt dazed for a moment, then nodded. “Yes. But she doesn’t like showing up in public.”

Is being a clerk not showing up in public? Xu Kong thought to herself. She could only take his words at face value, since the woman didn’t like arguing with others.

“We can let her take care of the Black Desolation Star Zone.”

Su Ping released Kayafollet from the universe of chaos. What Shen Huang said caught his attention. “Master, you don’t have to go there in person. It’ll be bad if you run into the alien on your way.”

Kayafollet had just gotten out of confinement and didn’t quite realize what was going on. However, she knew what Su Ping meant based on what she managed to hear. She was quite angry; would it be good if she ran into that alien?

However, being a prisoner, there was nothing she could do except glare at her captor silently.

“That’ll be for the best.” Shen Huang glanced at the Saint Heir from the Planet of Origin and said to Su Ping, “She inherited the ancient corpse’s legacy. Can you control her? Isn’t there a chance that she’ll suddenly absorb all the legacy after an epiphany, and reach the top cultivation height the ancient expert had when he was alive?”

Kayafollet almost rolled her eyes in fury after hearing that conjecture. Both the master and disciple pair were truly cunning, to even take that into consideration. They really weren’t giving her any chance to make a comeback!

“No. It’s not that easy to digest the legacy of a universe dominator. Besides, her talent is mediocre at best; I will reach that height before she does. I would still be able to suppress her, even if she becomes a universe dominator,” said Su Ping.

Kayafollet almost vomited blood. My talent is mediocre? It was the first time anyone had said that about her in her entire life. It was almost ridiculous.

However-just as she was about to refuteshe fell silent again after looking at Su Ping.

She was indeed nothing remarkable when compared to him.

The latter didn’t say that to humiliate her; he was only using the godly princes and princesses and the Dao Children of the Heaven Path Institute as a benchmark. Compared to them, she was truly mediocre; even the Dao Child candidates could have taken turns to beat her silly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Shen Huang and the others were amused and somehow sympathetic when they saw how frustrated Kayafollet was, even though she was an enemy.

“I’m returning to my store. Master, please let me know if anything happens,” said Su Ping.

“Okay.”

After saying goodbye, Su Ping took Kayafollet back to his store. Business was done for the day at that moment, so the door was closed.

Su Ping greeted Tang Ruyan, Joanna and the others, then led Kayafollet to the pet room.

“What are you going to do?”

Kayafollet gave Su Ping a wary look. She knew that the guy didn’t know the first thing about gentleness; whatever he was planning was not something good.

“Enslave you,” said Su Ping.

Kayafollet was rather stunned. Do you have to be so blunt about it?

Very soon, she saw a dark light appearing on Su Ping’s fingertips. He drew a strange rune in midair, right before her eyes.

A strange power was spread out as the rune gradually took shape. Kayafollet felt rather dizzy, as if her consciousness was about to be sucked into the rune.
