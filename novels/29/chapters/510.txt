Chapter 511 Possessed by Bones, Embroiled in Sins

Blood rained down. Time slowed down. All the voices in the world faded until they were no longer audible. The only thing that remained in the world was the blood and the dragon.

The dragon that was still been squeezed.

Plop, plop.

A heart was pumping.

The pumping was so violent that the sound of that heartbeat was enough to wake the dead.

“Ah!!!!”

A howl arose that would rend almost any heart. Divine Energy surged out from him. Behind him appeared the dark Field of Darkness in which many fiends and demons could be seen. There was a faint and yet majestic figure inside as well.

That hysterical and wild call resounded through the sky!

The Otherworld Heavenly King was stunned speechless. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

How come its Space Confinement failed?

No way!

This human being is merely at the seventh rank. No matter how outstanding he is, he could not have broken out from the Space Confinement!

Also, what are those things in this human’s Force Field?

The Heavenly King was able to tell that those figures and images were terrifying. There had to be some existence that it could hardly picture.

“I am going to kill you!!”

Su Ping glared at the Heavenly King with wild eyes. His Divine Energy was burning up. The frozen space around him began to thaw.

Su Ping could feel a stream of turbulent energy gushing out from him.

His strength and momentum were rising rapidly.

Break!!

Boom!

Su Ping moved his arms; he exerted his full strength. With a muffled sound, the confinement was gone!

In the meantime, a familiar consciousness appeared in Su Ping’s mind, which startled him. The killing intent on his face became even more evident.

“You’re awake. Perfect timing. Come and join me for the last battle of my life!” Su Ping bellowed.

That consciousness understood Su Ping’s intention from the bond of their contract and happily obliged.

Come on!!

From behind Su Ping, a swirl appeared and a figure stepped out!

It was the Little Skeleton that had just woken up from the blood cocoon. Every piece of the Little Skeleton’s bones was spotlessly white.

The biggest change of the Little Skeleton was the color of its bones which was originally black.

Two balls of crimson fire were burning in its eye sockets.

The Heavenly King was surprised to see the Little Skeleton. Instead of mocking the battle pet, the Heavenly King was trembling. Something was terrifying about the skeleton.

It seemed that the skeleton was a creature above the Fate State!

I have to finish it!

The Heavenly King came back to its senses. The Little Skeleton had to be destroyed!

Space was closing in on Su Ping again

Roar!!

Su Ping howled. He punched at the Heavenly King with all of his strength. However, as soon as he threw that punch, something invisible had stopped him!

It was the force contained in space!

Su Ping punched out wildly but he just could not break that invisible wall! He did not have enough strength! “Stupid!”

The Otherworld Heavenly King snorted.

Right then, the Little Skeleton suddenly shifted into a beam of white light that pierced into Su Ping.

Su Ping felt something entering him. Following that, a chilly feeling had spread all across his body.

The next second, he felt something was going to burst out of him. At the same time, he felt there was an endless pool of strength he could tap into.

With pain and anger, Su Ping punched again! Boom!!

The invisible hindrance in space cracked open. A virtual image of the Fist of Exorcist smashed onto the face of the Heavenly King.

The Heavenly King was forced back for a dozen meters. There was a wound on that charming face and blood was oozing out from its mouth as well.

Still, that was not the time to tend to the pain. The Heavenly King eyed Su Ping in disbelief.

What happened just now?!

How could a seventh-rank human crack that space barrier?

How could he merge with his pet?!

Su Ping looked quite terrifying right then. Outside his skin were white bones but different from a skeleton; skin and flesh were still underneath those bones. His eyes were still his human eyes but his eyebrows and nose were replaced with bones.

He had merged with his pet!

That was a skill that could only be mastered by creatures at the legendary rank and above! But Su Ping was only at the seventh-rank. That was certain.

Soon, the Heavenly King thought of a reason.

It must be because of the skeleton!

This was the skeleton’s skill!

What confused the Heavenly King was the pet’s skill. How could it be so intimidating?!

In the meantime, Su Ping was also in a daze after he had injured the Otherworld Heavenly King with this punch. Did I do it? From the astonishment on the Heavenly King’s face, Su Ping was able to tell that indeed, he had been the reason. Also, Su Ping had sensed the change in himself and soon came back to his senses. The Little Skeleton had merged with him. Was this a new skill the Little Skeleton had learned?

As he stared at the Heavenly King, Su Ping no longer had to contain his killing intent.

Charge!!

Something flipped in his mind. With one step, he had reached the Heavenly King!

That should be a skill mastered by creatures of the Void State and Su Ping had used it as if it had come naturally to him. He was just thinking about how to move faster and then he did it!

The Heavenly King was stunned yet again.

This was unexpected. However, Su Ping’s usage of the skill was not proficient, which had given time for the Heavenly King to react!

Whoosh!

The Heavenly King appeared behind Su Ping. Such being the case, this human being cannot be left alive. He must go! Many air blades were manifested.

Die!

The Heavenly King generated a sword out of thin air, aiming to cut Su Ping’s back.

Right then, Su Ping turned around and threw a punch.

Su Ping wasn’t any less experienced than the Heavenly King when it came to battles. The Heavenly King had lived a long time but it didn’t have the need to spend most of its time fighting. It cultivated most of the time. But Su Ping was different. When he was in the store, ninety percent of the time he would head to a cultivation site, battling with his life on the line!

The Heavenly King was surprised to see him react so quickly.

It felt as if Su Ping had calculated when and where it would strike.

Although surprised, the Heavenly King didn’t stop. It could not stop.

Finish him!

Boom!!

The bone-covered fist was as hard as steel. The void sword in the hand of the Heavenly King was completely cracked. The fist pushed on and landed on the Heavenly King’s palm. Bones cracked.

Stunned by this outcome, the Heavenly King dashed away.

There was a hole in its palm. A blade was retracting, back into the white bones covering Su Ping’s knuckles. The Heavenly King was unable to figure this out; that was not the usual merging that it knew of.

The usual merging would make one consciousness was the lead and the other one would lie dormant. However, there and then, it was evident that the two consciousnesses were battling together!

How could it lose to the human being in strength?

How?

It was a beast king of the Fate State!

On the other hand, the human being was just at the seventh-rank, not even the titled rank!

The Heavenly King believed that even a single sneeze would have killed many. But this human had injured it!

“Go to hell!!” Su Ping shouted again.

The wrath rose higher as Su Ping remembered the Inferno Dragon. Bang! Bang! Bang! He punched out continuously. With the help of that surge of power, Su Ping seemed to have deciphered the principles of the Fist of Exorcist’s second level. His punch was even more powerful!

The Heavenly King hurriedly called forth a Space Confinement again but failed.

“Courting death!”

The Heavenly King was forced back several times and distress appeared on its face.

Suddenly, a mist of blood burst out from the Heavenly King; that mist was able to isolate all senses. Inside that area, the blood mist would seep into the target’s body, turning the target into a puddle of blood before the victim was able to tell.

Force Field!

Su Ping’s eyes glowed. His Force Field suddenly began to tumble around. The virtual figures inside the Force Field suddenly turned to face the Heavenly King at the same time. A fierce figure crawled out from the Force Field, then grabbed Su Ping and wrapped him up.

That massive figure was smaller after it crawled out from the Force Field. The thing wrapped around Su Ping was a dark mist.

Su Ping felt that his strength had increased yet again!

“Go to hell!” he shouted and punched again.

He was getting close to the second level of the Fist of Exorcist.

The virtual figure of the fist was large; it seemed to carry a beast’s roar.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

The Heavenly King’s hair was extended toward the virtual fist. However, in the next second, the blade-like hair was all destroyed!

The fist landed on the Heavenly King. It hurried to strike back but then it started to fall, until it hit the battleground.

With a bang, a huge pit was made on the ground.

All the wild beasts were scared away, wary of the Heavenly King.

On the outer wall, many battle pet warriorsincluding Mu Beihai and Liu Tianzong and the titled battle pet warriors from other base cities

-were stunned speechless. Did Su Ping just smack down the Otherworld Heavenly King?!
