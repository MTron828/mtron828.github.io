Chapter 1452 The First Ally (1)

“What is my mother going to do to him?” asked the girl telepathically. “The Selvega asked me to bring him here and watch over him.”

Watch over him? Maybe my mother is planning to find his backer. He passed through the green glass. If the invaders like him are malicious, they might lure the monsters in. The girl was deep in thought, her eyes glittering.

She stopped speaking telepathically. She looked down at Su Ping and asked, “Member of the chaos clan, do you care to spar with me?”

“Huh?”

Su Ping was rather surprised. A sparring invitation on their first encounter? This girl is rather competitive.

“Sorry. I’m not interested.” Su Ping shook his head and declined.

“Is the chaos clan so cowardly?” The girl frowned, not expecting Su Ping to turn her down. Such an attitude was inconceivable in her clan.

“Not cowardly, just uninterested,” said Su Ping helplessly, “I’m here to establish an alliance with you, not to cause trouble.”

“Humph. Weaklings don’t get to be our allies,” said the girl after a snort.

Well… Su Ping was downright speechless. He couldn’t argue back. He said, “I heard that you’re hiding here from the monsters beyond the sky. Since I was able to sneak in, I can certainly break through your skies. That’s not enough to prove my strength?”

The onlookers showed slight changes in their expressions. Su Ping had spoken of their greatest fear.

The girl snorted and said, “Who knows how you snuck in? You can only tell how strong a person is after you fight them. Besides, I’m interested in the battle techniques of the chaos clan.”

“Fine.” Su Ping relented. Since he wanted an alliance, displaying his strength was on the list.

She smiled with glittering lips after seeing that Su Ping was on board. “Come to our holy arena. Don’t worry. I won’t kill you.”

“I won’t kill you either,” said Su Ping.

The girl raised her eyebrows but didn’t reply. She tore an opening in the void and took Su Ping to a special time and space found in a terrain behind the palace. There were special devices and gems which made it look like a unique small world.

“Please follow me.”

“All right.”

Led by the girl, everybody stepped into the holy arena.

It was more of a small universe than an “arena.” It was so vast that everybody could fight freely.

“Come on.”

The girl looked at Su Ping with anticipation in her eyes. Her body was emitting a flickering blue light.

“Ladies first,” said Su Ping.

“Is that a thing?”

“Yes. It’s considered as part of the etiquette in our civilization.”

“Males are generally stronger than females in your civilization. It’s more like weaklings first, right? You think I’m weak?” The girl raised her eyebrows. Her tongue was really quick; Su Ping didn’t really know what to say.

Communicating across civilizations is indeed difficult… Su Ping heaved a sigh in his heart, then said, “I didn’t mean to offend you. I’ll start then.”

“Bring it on.” The girl slightly raised her head.

Su Ping flashed and disappeared from the spot. All the times and spaces were trembling when Su Ping’s figure passed by. He was absolutely unpredictable, moving faster than time, as if he were etched in memories. Unavoidably, a sharp sword aura darted forth, emerging from Su Ping’s finger.

The girl’s enormous pupils shrank somewhat, obviously surprised by the visitor’s sudden attack. She was quick to react, though, unleashing blue light that looked like some sort of shield. She then rubbed her hands, summoning a lightning blade. She moved to brutally pierce Su Ping’s face.

Never hit a man in the face… Su Ping tilted his head, moving his sword to meet his opponent’s lightning blade, instantly colliding. Su Ping instantly sensed that a high-frequency power had been radiated; however, all the cells in his body were like engines that worked quickly to offset that power.

The girl, on the other hand, had to quickly move back when the sword struck her lightning blade. She had to move dozens of years into the future to avoid the strike’s effect.

But the next moment—she dashed back to her original spot.

“What a sharp attack. Was that the chaos clan’s method?” The girl had a solemn expression. Su Ping’s strike had won her approval.

The other God Emperors tagging along were astonished too. They had never seen the girl lose to any peer, and Su Ping even seemed to be a level below them.

Su Ping didn’t follow up on his attack. He stood on the spot and asked, “Shall we continue?”

“Of course!” There was fury on the girl’s face. “You think I’ve tried my best? Be careful!”

Her eyes turned entirely blue, and her skin was wreathed in abundant blue light. Electricity arcs were appearing in the void; however, it was not real electricity, but the Great Dao in that specific form, emitting a terrifying light.

She suddenly attacked. The lightning blade she held turned from the size of a dagger to a saber almost five meters long, before it slashed at Su Ping fiercely.

Her body figure was slim, but her battle moves were wild.

Su Ping was stunned by the girl’s fury. He didn’t know the reason why, but he became serious. He released the universe of chaos and summoned its power, then threw a punch.
