Chapter 210 Return

Su Ping took out a bottle of water from his backpack and used the water’s reflection to check what his forehead looked like.

The mark was a winding dragon.

The power of the remaining dragon soul is hidden inside this mark. Thanks to it I can directly teleport back and forth to visit the Mysterious Realm at any time...

Su Ping gently caressed this mark, hoping that he could hide it. Otherwise, it would make him stand out too much; he would be like a fantasy version of Justice Bao who had a crescent moon on his forehead.

He felt how the surge of astral powers inside him was building a close connection with the mark. An idea came to mind: he tried to pull the astral powers back.

el

A miraculous thing happened. As his astral powers were being pulled back, the mark on his forehead began to wiggle, and then the dragon mark sank along with the astral powers. The mark disappeared into his skin and his forehead was as clean as before.

Su Ping knew that the dragon mark was still there but it was concealed under his skin.

That will do...

Su Ping breathed in relief. Finally, the eye-catching mark would not be a problem. His only regret was that he was still too handsome for comfort...

Anyways, now that I passed the ninth dragon bone, I must have caught the attention of this backstage manipulator... he knows about the existence of the legacy and has been deliberately withholding information about how many lands have been explored.

Su Ping dragged his mind back to this dragon king’s heritage ground. His eyebrows were knitted together. He thought for a bit and decided to hurry back to the base city as soon as possible. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He would be safe back in the store.

With the protection of the system, he wouldn’t even be afraid of legendary battle pet warriors. The system had boasted that not even gods or demons could hurt him as long as he was within the store’s range!

Compared to gods and demons, legendary battle pet warriors were nothing.

Su Ping didn’t linger after having made a decision. He activated the mark and teleported out of the Mysterious Realm right

away.

...

At the dragon stand, in front of the towering dragon bones...

More and more people were gathering there. When people heard that someone had reached the ninth dragon bone, those that were resting at a distance hurried back and joined the massive crowd around the dragon stand.

All of them raised their heads to gaze at the highest dragon bone.

“Who was the guy that made it all the way there? How was he able to charge tight to the ninth dragon bone?”

“Wait, are you guys telling the truth? Someone has climbed to the ninth dragon bone? I heard that the highest someone had ever climbed was the sixth one. Are you sure about what you saw?”

“How stupid can you be! There are so many of us here. It’s impossible for all of us to be wrong. Besides, didn’t you see it? Even Venerable the Blade is up there. Why do you think those big potatoes are on high alert if no one reached the ninth dragon bone?” “...You’re probably right. Anyways, who was that guy? Which family is he from?” “Who knows. But he is definitely awesome. He is better than anyone else who has ever tried to beat this challenge!”

“Right. Even Ye Tianming, who is No.1 on the Pioneering’s Rank, has only reached the sixth dragon bone. The record was from several years ago, sol guess Ye Tianming may be able to get to the seventh or eighth dragon bone now, but there’s no way he can climb up to the ninth.

“For him, even the seventh dragon bone is difficult, let alone the ninth one. I heard that the difficulty increases drastically from the seventh dragon bone and up. Even Venerable the Blade would have to shrink back at the sight of the eighth dragon bone!”

“Hiss. This guy will be out in a moment. We are about to lay our eyes on a legendary talent!”

The onlookers were discussing heatedly. They were all looking forward to finding out who this challenger was.

Up in the air, Venerable the Blade and the other titled warriors remained silent. All of them had solemn expressions.

All of a sudden, Venerable the Blade frowned as they stared at the dragon bones. He turned over to the entrance of the Mysterious Realm. Something got his attention.

Space twisted in that direction and someone emerged in front of them, out of thin air.

Venerable the Bade lowered his head and greeted this man with respect. “Master Yuan.”

The others were taken aback. None of them noticed when Master Yuan arrived. “Master Yuan.” They hurried to bow to him.

The man who showed up was elderly, whose gray hair and beard were dancing in the air. He was wearing a simple cyan robe and he appeared to be learned and refined. “The challenger is still inside the dragon bones?”

Venerable the Blade answered, “Yes.”

The old man they called Yuan batted his eyelids. There was a trace of frigid killing intent in his eyes but he sounded extremely calm, “When did he go in? How long has he been in the ninth dragon bone?”

“I notified you as soon as he entered the ninth dragon bone. It should be half an hour now.” Venerable the Blade kept his head low.

The others could feel the killing intent radiated by the old man named Yuan. They were shivering, fearing that Yuan would take it out on them.

“He is still in there. Have you found out which family he belongs to?” the old man Yuan asked.

Venerable the Blade replied, “I just went down there and asked around. I heard that the challenger is a young man in his early twenties from the Longjiang Base City and his surname is Su. He runs a pet store. I will ask the mayor of the Longjiang Base City to provide us information about this man from their civil affairs bureau. Then we will find out which family he is from.”

The old man named Yuan squinted and crossed his hands behind his back. He simply stared at the ninth dragon bone without uttering another word.

Time moved on. Soon, two more hours had passed.

The onlookers gathered in front of the dragon bones were losing their patience. Some people’s necks had gone stiff after looking up for so long.

“Was this all a joke? Were you guys serious?”

“Yes, we were. It’s just this challenger... did he die in there?”

“That is possible. After all, the ninth dragon bone is dangerous. This man was probably killed instantly when he encountered something like a beast king.”

“The dragon bones are not something to be messed around with. Deaths are unusual but those who come out with wounds are many. I think this man was trying to force his way in but ended up dying since he wasn’t capable enough.”

Since the challenger had been in there for a long time, more and more people were thinking that this guy, most likely, had failed and died.

Some onlookers gradually stepped away while feeling sorry for this man, and resumed their own businesses.

The remaining onlookers stayed there for another thirty minutes before they began to also step away. Their time in the Mysterious Realm was precious. They couldn’t stay there for too long.

“I think he’s probably gone,” said an old man with white hair and ruddy complexion standing next to Venerable the Blade, with a gingerly approach.

The others nodded in agreement. They were thinking about the same thing. All of them were relieved at this prospect. Master Yuan would not blame them severely if this man failed the challenge. Otherwise, they would spend some days in hardship.

Venerable the Blade frowned. He stared at the ninth dragon bone and said nothing. As a matter of fact, deep down, a part of him hoped the young man would pass.

Venerable the Blade could not tell why he would have such thoughts. However, he did feel sorry to think that this guy would fail the challenge.

The killing intent in Master Yuan’s eyes began to dissipate. Entering the ninth dragon bone did not mean that this person could actually pass it. It seemed that this man had most likely failed the challenge.

Master Yuan felt better. He looked away from the ninth dragon bone and said to Venerable the Blade, “This man has most likely failed. Even so, contact the Longjiang Base City. All the information about this man has to be forwarded to me before sunset. Also, tell the explorers of the Seal Legion to slow down and leave three lands sealed.” Venerable the Blade immediately understood what Master Yuan was intending. “Yes.” Venerable the Blade nodded.

The Seal Legion was a team organized by several forces. The Seal Legion was in charge of undoing the seals of all the lands. Otherwise, it would take years and years before all the lands could be unsealed, if they relied on explorers alone.

“Also, the Mysterious Realm will be available for another three days and will close off ahead of schedule,” Master Yuan added.

Venerable the Blade was surprised. He cast a glance at Master Yuan. It came as a surprise that Master Yuan would go to such lengths. He was clearly determined to leave the legacy to his granddaughter, making the chance inaccessible for anyone else. Venerable the Blade said nothing other than yes.

The others looked at each other, smiling bitterly. Their desire to become legendary battle pet warriors grew even more intense.

The difference between titled battle pet warriors and legendary battle pet warriors was not just in the ranks themselves. They were worlds apart.

The most valuable resources on the blue planet were in the hands of the legendary battle pet warriors who were like gods overlooking the entire blue planet. A heritage ground like the Longtai Mountain was of immense value. Whoever could receive the legacy would become a legendary battle pet warrior. However, that was a chance that was not available for the masses.

The powerful ruled.

The powerful would grow even more powerful and the weak would become even weaker.

Outside the Longtai Mountain.

At an open area in the distance, the space wiggled as a man suddenly appeared.

Su Ping landed on the ground. He looked around and saw that he was on the highway outside the Mysterious Realm. Looking back, he could still see the towering mountain that led to the Mysterious Realm.

Many cars were parked there.

Su Ping only realized at the moment that he had reached this place on Ye Chenshan’s car. He would have to rely on himself to make the trip back.

He thought about stealing one of the parked cars but then gave up on the idea.

There was satellite surveillance in the area. People would pull up the surveillance video if they found their cars missing. They probably would see how he appeared out of nowhere, which would seem strange.

Su Ping traveled along the road and found the way back to the Longjiang Base City. He walked for a while before he summoned the Dark Dragon Hound.

“You will be my means of transportation for now.” Su Ping hopped onto the Dark Dragon Hounds’ back, pulled its hair, and yelled “Giddy up.”

The Dark Dragon Hound understood Su Ping’s words. It was reluctant because of its pride as a battle pet. It wasn’t a saddle horse.

However, Su Ping slapped it and the Dark Dragon Hound galloped forward, faster and faster.
