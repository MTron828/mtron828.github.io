Chapter 1234 Assault

Song Yuan turned around and looked, only to see a lot of iron fragments on the ground, all engraved with laws. That was a technology that the Federation had acquired from ancient relics-laws could then be etched onto weapons. All the best blacksmiths had to grasp such a technology.

Even Heavenly Lords had to show enough respect to such blacksmiths.

Song Yuan asked out of habit, “Was there any video sent back?”

“No. They were immediately destroyed,” said Liu Xia telepathically.

Song Yuan’s heart was heavy. A high-performing Abyss Pioneer would require the strike of a top Heavenly Lord to be destroyed instantly. It was no surprise to find that nobody was willing to go first, even though the channel was right there. Song Yuan relayed the information to all his group via telepathy and their faces changed, not expecting the dark cave to be as dangerous.

“Is there a Celestial beast hiding over there?” Ji Xueqing asked suspiciously. The others shared the same concern. Celestials would have their power limited to the Ascendant State once they entered the Mayhem Star Zone, but the situation was different once inside the ancient corpse.

“The corpse used to belong to a universe dominator. There’s an independent world inside his body that blocks all laws from the Mayhem Star Zone. That is why it’s possible for them to come here.”

“Do we just wait here?” You Long raised his eyebrows. Always short-tempered, he didn’t like waiting Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Song Yuan said solemnly, “Let’s not be reckless; just wait and see what happens. A bloody battle is probably awaiting us. You must have seen lots of people fighting before getting a treasure.”

Everyone was solemn-faced after hearing that.

According to the layout of some relics, the ultimate treasure would simply be right up ahead, but the people who fought for it died and shed their blood. It was quite ironic.

The unknown and surely dangerous dark cave was estimated to be inside the ancient corpse’s chest, based on the map reading. That place was a strong candidate for storing a legacy.

All of a sudden-Song Yuan heard a telepathic voice, “Old Song, watch out for the Heavenly Devil Alliance.”

Song Yuan instantly recognized the source of the voice, but he did all he could to control his body reactions and avoid looking in that direction.

As a matter of fact, he had noticed the man the moment he arrived. It was an old friend of his, who met by accident and later saved each other’s lives.

Not many knew of their friendship. Even his master was out of the loop.

Both of them had benefited a lot from that secret friendship.

“Why?” Song Yuan asked immediately.

“Qian Mei from the Blood Charm Star Zone went to see me just now. She wanted to work with the Black Desolation Star Zone and finish off both the Golden and the Red Fire Star Zones first. My first senior brother is negotiating with her right now. Her reward is quite lavish; you must be careful…” The man’s voice came to an abrupt end, as he clearly feared being exposed.

Song Yuan’s eyes turned cold.

He looked at the people from the Blood Charm Star Zone, particularly at the alluring woman standing right at the center of their group. She was looking at him with a vague smile, as if she would have already seen through all his plans.

Song Yuan shot her a cold look and then looked away; he would have never expected that the woman would be secretly conspiring with other star zones to annihilate them.

He took a deep breath, and quickly informed the Red Fire and the Void Star Zones’ teams about the current situation. His message was simple: the Blood Charm Star Zone was dealing with their alliance, instead of the Golden Star Zone.

The three star zones had been on the same boat ever since they formed an alliance. They were indeed competing for the treasure and had to be wary of each other, but they had to stick together whenever a common enemy was encountered.

“They are truly out of their minds. How exactly did Old Monster Ye brainwash them? Why are they working so hard for him?” Liu Xia flew into an outrage; she also stopped herself from looking in that direction.

“He probably offered them rewards they cannot refuse or fathom; otherwise, she wouldn’t have tried so hard. The one at fault is actually…” Song Yuan glanced at Su Ping and put on a bitter smile. It was actually his junior brother’s fault, all for being such a genius.

“Senior brother, who are you talking to?” Su Ping joined the telepathic conversation. He noticed a distant telepathic message, but it was soon gone.

“Liu Xia,” said Song Yuan.

Su Ping glanced at Liu Xia, who looked back at him and nodded. It was her way of greeting.

Liu Xia’s direction isn’t right. The voice came from somewhere else… Su Ping was dazed for a moment after seeing Liu Xia’s position. It was clear that his senior brother was speaking to someone else. Unfortunately, the telepathic voice had already dispersed and was hardly traceable.

Why is my senior brother being so secretive?

Su Ping was slightly curious, but his senior’s telepathic message arrived before he could consider any further. “Be ready for battle. The Blood Charm Star Zone might attack us along with other star zones. Getting the treasures is not our primary concern right now; let’s finish them off before we figure out how to explore this cave.”

“With other star zones?” Ji Xueqing was stunned.

You Long was shocked. “Are they really this shameless? Aren’t the other star zones neutral? They want to participate in this universal war too?”

“The battle about to break out is possibly being caused by a matter unrelated to the universal war. However, we are the representatives of our respective star zones. This will turn into a signal heralding the beginning of the war,” said Song Yuan solemnly.

“Senior brother, if the intelligence is reliable, I think we should attack them before they attack us,” Su Ping proposed telepathically.

Song Yuan felt dazed, and couldn’t help but glance at his junior brother.

What a ferocious mindset!

Attack instead of being attacked?

If the dozen top Heavenly Lords were to fight it out, they could reduce half the universe into a desolate place.

It would be a disaster, even inside the ancient corpse!

But

Song Yuan agreed on Su Ping’s proposal after considering for a moment. The intelligence was reliable; it was better to strike first instead of waiting for them to attack!

“Prepare to fight!” the former announced telepathically. He also dropped a hint at the people from the Red Fire and the Void Star Zones.

His enemy couldn’t have foreseen that he had a good friend from the Black Desolation Star Zone; he currently held the advantage.

“Die!”

They dispersed, and seemed to be casually talking with others while making their way toward the representatives of the Blood Charm Star Zone. Once they were close enough—and the alluring woman, named Hai Mei, noticed that something was off-Song Yuan roared and expanded, performing triple merging again. He transformed into a terrifying giant, and his energy was almost overflowing

Su Ping was right behind him; he simply summoned the Purple Python for that battle.

“Huh?”

Hai Mei changed her expression abruptly and roared, “You’re sneaking up on me? How shameless!”

She quickly took action and summoned multiple pets while she spoke. Still-before her pets launched any attack-a giant creature descended from above and pressed them to the ground.
