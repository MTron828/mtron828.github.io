Chapter 459 Yearning

“Student?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He was about to say no when he thought of something.

The Holy Light Base City was a sacred place for trainers, and one of the most important base cities of the Subcontinent District. The economy there was more developed and had a less restrained flow of information. He would spend most of his time at the store in the Longjiang Base City where he wouldn’t receive information timely. The Longjiang Base City was far from the Holy Light Base City. When something sensational happened there, the people from his Base City wouldn’t even know. This inconvenience went both ways.

Also, in this day and age, trainers had the most honorable position.

Trainers were more glamorous than battle pet warriors of the same rank.

To build up a connection in the circle of trainers should be beneficial for him.

“Sure. I can take a look.”

Su Ping nodded.

The relationship between a teacher and a student would be firm. Su Ping was talking to the Vice Chairman and he and Shi Haochi were acquaintances. However, he had just met the two and had not built up a close relationship, yet. At the same time, since he had to take care of the store, he had little time to get to know the two.

But a student would be different. The student would have to stay with him and would somewhat count as a member of his family.

The Vice Chairman smiled. “We’re going to choose the first place and second place winners in the next couple of days. The other top trainers and master trainers will go and pick students as well. You can offer an invitation to anyone you like. Those participants are eager to learn from top trainers.”

“Good.”

Su Ping nodded.

“You come from a distant place. I suppose you haven’t found accommodations yet. How about I arrange that for you?”

“Okay. Thanks.”

Shi Haochi had two daughters and Su Ping was a young man. It could be inconvenient for him to continue living there.

At the same time, the conference was resumed.

It was held in another venue.

As for the previous fights, upon receiving the Vice Chairman’s approval, Master Bai told the public that it had been an internal conflict and covered up the facts.

Su Ping had passed the tests and had been identified as a top trainer. It wasn’t a lie to say that he was one member of the Trainers Association.

To classify the nature of the fights as an internal conflict would in a way save the dignity of the headquarters. At least for the public in general, they wouldn’t be able to tell that it had been an outsider who had shown up and bullied the Trainers Association. As for internal conflict, it was nothing strange; all families had internal conflicts.

Internal conflicts were trivial matters... Although, in this “internal conflict”, a titled battle pet warrior and a young master of the Xiao Family had died. A building that had gone through the tests of time, full of master trainers’ portraits, had collapsed... that was still acceptable. After all, what could be done even if they didn’t accept it? Life had to go on. Cutting losses in time was the right way to go.

The two deceased had died an unworthy death, though. After all that happened, the conference didn’t go smoothly. No one could focus their minds on the conference. They would think about Su Ping every now and then. The young man who had emerged from nowhere had left such a deep impression that no one could erase the previous conflict from their thoughts.

Su Ping didn’t participate in the conference. The Vice Chairman took the chance to introduce him to other top trainers. Su Ping was then officially seen as one of the top trainers.

The top trainers Su Ping met were quite friendly and they spoke nicely to him. The top trainers were familiar with each other. Even though their fields of study were different, everyone was on good terms.

After all, they were all men with some standing. They knew better than to incur hatred and knew full well what to say. Master Bai was also a kind top trainer. Of course, his kindness was limited to people of the same circle.

The Vice Chairman introduced and praised Su Ping. As such, the top trainers made note of him. They had to remember him, a top trainer who was quite young.

They even saw him with more astonishment and kindness when they heard that Su Ping had inspired a Bloodmist Spirit within one move.

The Vice Chairman also told them about the Moonfrost Dragon. The praise they offered to Su Ping was sincere; he could tell that the Vice Chairman was indeed fond of him.

Someone was unable to fight back the urge to ask Su Ping’s age. Su Ping answered honestly. A man would not mind telling others his age.

When they heard that Su Ping was nineteen... Everyone, including the Vice Chairman, first gasped and then burst into laughter. They found Su Ping very humorous and narcissistic.

A 19-year-old top trainer?

Who are you trying to kid?

Anyways, a humorous man would always be liked.

After this “joke,” the top trainers were even more willing to befriend Su Ping, someone who was approachable.

Because of their reaction, Su Ping also felt that apart from being able to say nice words, those top trainers were quite funny as well

In half a day, Su Ping’s name was known all across the headquarters of the Trainers Association.

The first ones to hear about the name were the top trainers. They knew that they were welcoming a new member. But they had yet to find out what was that new member’s field of study.

Afterward, the master trainers learned about Su Ping as well. Apart from the master trainers who had met Su Ping, the others had heard about the new top trainer as well and that he was from another base city. The new one was able to wield both the pen and the gun: the top trainer was also a powerful titled battle pet warrior.

That was a fact. However, as more people heard it, they started to treat the fact as a piece of rumor.

But Su Ping’s fame was still spread.

As for the other regular trainers, they heard about a new top trainer. They didn’t even know the name, but that didn’t stop them from discussing the new one heatedly.

After all, the birth of a top trainer would stir up a great sensation, even in the Holy Light Base City!

Every year, the base city would witness the birth of one or two master trainers but the top trainers were still few and far between.

In the evening

Shi Haochi went back home.

“Dad, are you alone?”

Zhenxiang ran to the door when she heard her dad arrive. She couldn’t help but look behind Shi Haochi. However, she didn’t see Su Ping.

“What?”

Shi Haochi said grumpily, “Of course. What? Do you think I’m coming home with a stepmom for you?”

His wife passed away early. Throughout the years, he had been toiling and moiling to raise his two daughters.

“Humph!”

Zhenxiang rolled her eyes. She knew that her dad was just making fun of her. She and Tongtong didn’t mind their dad finding a better half but he was never up for it.

“What I meant to ask is, where is that guy?” Zhenxiang rephrased her question. Shi Haochi realized she was talking about Su Ping. What happened in the day came rushing back to his mind. So many things had happened that he couldn’t even digest all the information. Exhausted, Shi Haochi answered, “The Vice Chairman has arranged accommodation for him. He no longer needs to come here. Besides, he is a top trainer; living here is beneath him.”

Zhenxiang was disappointed. Spiritless, she went back to the living room.

Tongtong heard the conversation as well and the disappointment in her eyes couldn’t be concealed. “That’s for the best. No one wants him here.”

Shi Haochi smiled. His two girls were bad liars. “He has shown you that beyond an able man is always another able man. You were always proud about your talents. Now you know what a talent is like. Work hard. If you want to see him, you can. He lives in the Longjiang Base City. I know his address.

“When you’re free, you can go there for a trip and visit him. To befriend someone like him will never be a mistake.”

“Longjiang?” The two girls committed that name to their memories. That was the first time that they had developed an interest in a base city outside the Holy Light Base City.

Su Ping came from that base city. What was it like?
