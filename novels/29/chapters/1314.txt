Chapter 1315 One Man’s Race (1)

Su Ping looked at the master of the Red Dome Realm. Instead of replying in a hurry, he remained deep in thought.

Before too long, other God Emperors stepped up, trying to rope Su Ping in with abundant privileges.

“Are these the privileges of a Dao Child?”

“He’s so brilliant. If I could have a moment like this in my life, I would die without regrets!”

“The Divine Barbarian Clan is really trying to impress the Dao Child!”

The mentors in the hall were all excited as they saw the God Emperors offer their terms. Some of the conditions were so attractive that even they, mere onlookers at the moment, felt greatly jealous. They were deeply amazed by Dao Child’s glamor; unfortunately, they knew it was impossible for them to ever become Dao Children.

Su Ping silently remembered those God Emperors’ terms. Some even offered treasures that were comparable to the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire.

Some clans were willing to marry off their princesses to him. They also promised that if Su Ping wanted to, they could alter his bloodline to make him part of the clan.

In addition, not only did some clans promise that humankind would become their core vassal race, but they also promised they would protect humankind three times against high-ranked clans.

All the terms expressed their sincerity.

However, there were also some God Emperors who were relatively arrogant and didn’t offer a lot. They made subtle threats, seeing that Su Ping was uninterested, but he calmly ignored them.

He didn’t think they would find trouble with humans for such a matter. Even if they did, thanks to the protection of the Heaven Path Institute and his fame, he could help humankind seek the protection of other high-ranked clans.

Besides, humans were already a vassal race of a high-ranked clan. Thanks to his new identity, the high-ranked clan would certainly take action if humankind was humiliated.

After receiving all the offers, Su Ping considered for a moment and narrowed them down to three.

He told Elder Chan his thoughts. He first wished to speak to the master of the Red Dome Realm.

Soon after, the two of them entered another time and space in the hall with Elder Chan’s help. w∪xiaworld dot site

“Are you willing to join the Red Dome Realm? I promise you won’t be disappointed.” The master of the Red Dome Realm was quite delighted. Su Ping had received lots of offers, but decided to speak to her alone, which meant that he was intrigued.

He remained calm; not much excitement was shown on his face. He said in an inscrutable manner, “Senior, you heard the offers made by the other seniors. I appreciate them very much; they’re all very attractive and I find them hard to refuse. After much deliberation, I’ve picked three, and yours is one of them.”

“Three?”

The master of the Red Dome Realm raised her eyebrows. She simply ignored Su Ping’s formalities, which could be skipped over; what mattered was the content of the offer.

“I’m interested in your Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire. But by comparison, the other two seniors’ offers are just as interesting. If you can accept three more requests, I’ll simply pick you,” said Su Ping.

“Just tell me.” The woman went straight to the chase, knowing that Su Ping was only negotiating.

“First, I want humans to be treated equally, like your own folk,” said Su Ping, “They should also be allowed to cultivate in the Red Dome Realm.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She raised her eyebrows and said, “The people in my clan are stratified in three tiers. The people of a core vassal race can compare to the tier-3 folk. I can only promise you that the talented humans who pass a simple test of my clan will be given the tier-3 identity and be allowed to cultivate there.”

Su Ping gave her a slight frown, but then he remembered the Liluo Clan’s offer, and knew it was already a high-ranked clan’s greatest concession.

“Second, I hope you can protect humankind three times.”

“That’s too many. Twice, at most,” the master of the Red Dome Realm calmed down and said, “But I promise that if a high-ranked clan were to wage war on humankind, we would surely help and prevent them from being annihilated.”

Su Ping nodded and said, “Lastly, I want frequent trade and communication between humankind and the Red Dome Realm. Hopefully, my race will become a true ally of the Red Dome Realm.”

“Huh?” She was slightly puzzled, and could not help but ask, “All three requests are for humankind. None is for yourself; are you

sure?”

“I am sure. If you accept them, I won’t have to meet the other two seniors,” said Su Ping.

The master of the Red Dome Realm pondered for a moment and said, “All right, no problem. You want humankind to be truly seen and respected by high-ranked clans, and you want it to develop in every way; that’s a good thought. However, humankind is just a middle-rank clan as it is… For it to be truly respected, an Ancestral God must be born.”

She stared at Su Ping and continued, “You’re too attached to your clan. Maybe you will never detach from it. I hope you can understand that when you’re strong enough, you will be your own race!”

“I will be my own race?”

Su Ping’s eyes trembled. He could understand the confidence in her words, but he didn’t explain. He was helping humans only because he owed them a favor. He had cultivated his Ascendant body in the Ember Palace, and countless humans were killed by the Rain Clan because of him.

He always considered it righteous to return favors.

“From now on, you’ll be a member of the Red Dome Realm; this is the deputy master’s badge. You’re a new Dao Child though, and you’ll probably cultivate in the Heaven Path Institute for the time being. I’ll wait for you in the Red Dome Realm.”

The master of the Red Dome Realm threw a crimson badge to Su Ping. There was a fire totem inscribed.

“You even prepared the badge in advance…” Su Ping accepted it and felt her sincerity. He asked, “What about the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire…”

“It’s unique in the Red Dome Realm. You’ll have it when you go to the Red Dome Realm. Here’s part of the fire I’ve harvested.” She waved a hand again, and the temperature began to rise quickly. Even the void seemed to be melting

There was a purple flame burning on her palm; every element that formed it seemed to be depicting some sort of meaning.

Su Ping was dazed.

It wasn’t a flame in his eyes, but a rich, Great Dao that was interweaving and circulating!

The fire was formed by a myriad of Dao Glyphs. Su Ping wasn’t able to determine their exact number, but there were plenty.

The master of the Red Dome Realm pushed a book onto Su Ping. “This describes the most usages of the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire, including battle usages, refining usages, array usages, etc. I will teach you all of them; you can make use of it however you wish, but I suggest that you use it to refine your body. You’ve never been polished by the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire; there’s still room for your body to improve.

Su Ping accepted the book, and the latter instantly transformed into a burst of infinite information that went into his head.

He waited for a moment and finally digested all the information, instantly realizing how extraordinary the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire was.

“Store it carefully. If the flame explodes, it would be as powerful as a God Emperor’s strike!” said the master of the Red Dome Realm solemnly.

Su Ping was still too weak to survive a God Warrior’s strike; she was worried that he would accidentally kill himself. The odds for that to happen were quite low, but that mystic fire was extremely dangerous.

The warning surprised him. While feeling that his body was about to melt, he understood that she wasn’t lying. He released his universe of chaos and absorbed the flame.

What an intense aura of chaos…

She could not help but glance at Su Ping. That brief revelation had already made her realize how unusual his universe was.

Hardly had he absorbed the fire when he felt that waves of scorching heat were spreading inside his universe, which seemed to have turned into a furnace.

Su Ping immediately used the fire-taming method she had just taught him to control and compress the fire in a part of the universe.

Even so, the power that the fire was releasing constantly was still polishing his universe of chaos nonstop
