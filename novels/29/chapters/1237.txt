Chapter 1239 Sword Will

Su Ping noticed that a tremendous amount of blood flowed into the heart as it compressed, and the dim Dao Glyphs floating inside glowed when they touched the blood, as if having absorbed new power.

“Oh no!”

Su Ping foresaw grave danger and reacted. “Greeny!”

Roar!

Greeny too sensed the danger and moved even before Su Ping shouted, wrapping him once again.

He also moved Song Yuan, Ji Xueqing and the others closer to him. He even used the power of his seventh small world, not giving them a chance to resist.

“Danger!”

“It looks like…”

Others noticed the crisis by then; they had been through so many battles that their bodies reacted faster than their heads. Some simply moved to another time and space to defend themselves.

Everything happened all too fast. The heart expanded again while Su Ping moved his team closer.

After a boom, everybody felt that their hearts had just been hammered. The beating heart was indetectable to their ears; it seemed to be some sort of law. Everybody felt their own hearts tremble violently at the same time.

The next moment, a stream of sharp and powerful energy was spread out, which contained complex Dao Patterns.

The Greeny’s scales shrank and its seven small worlds emerged; all were of Ascendant realm. The snake then unleashed its true power.

The seven dazzling small worlds revealed themselves in full; they were so beautiful that everybody was dumbfounded.

Song Yuan and the others were also dazed by the seven blooming worlds.

None of them expected that Su Ping’s pet would also have seven small worlds!

Su Ping’s pet was extremely intimidating; it almost made them shiver.

Boom!

A blast swept over and shattered all the laws in the area. Even if they hid in another point in time, they would still be hit by the brutal force as long as they were present.

Greeny’s seven small worlds blocked the terrifying blast like a lotus flower. The outer small world was dented by the impact, seemingly about to collapse.

However, all seven worlds were connected. The first small world received the brunt of the impact, but the blast effect was endured by gathering the power of the other six worlds.

Once the power of the explosion was too much to bear, Greeny focused the small world’s power on its skin.

The blast immediately reached its body; scales shook and many cracks appeared. Those fractures were extremely sharp, and looked like countless sword auras.

The scales gradually gave out and broke; however, the blast had already been diffused enough to avoid greater damage.

Su Ping was relieved. Greeny’s combat ability was 99,999, which was the maximum stat of the Ascendant State; it was even stronger than Song Yuan. If the pet snake was unable to resist, the blast probably would have destroyed all lives below the Celestial State, and maybe even injure Celestials.

Was the attack from the black hole caused by this beating heart? Su Ping looked at the black heart as he pondered.

It was very likely that the black hole led to the other end of the heart.

But

The ancient corpse’s heart was still beating. Could it still be alive?

Next to Su Ping-Song Yuan and the others recovered from their stupor, only to be shocked once more.

The source of the blast and Su Ping’s terrifying pet were formidable. They looked at Su Ping, thinking that their junior brother was mysterious and unpredictable.

Once the blast effect faded, the people of other star zones fell out of other times and spaces. Even top Heavenly Lords such as Liu Xia were in a mess; their armor was damaged, and some of their ultimate treasures became dim.

A dozen unowned pets appeared on the ground, as three Ascendants—including a Heavenly Lord—had died.

Some of the pets they summoned as a protective measure had died alongside them. The surviving pets were left in a daze after the contracts were dissolved.

Some were quick and snatched the unowned pets, placing them in their Ascendant worlds.

“Thank you very much, junior brother.”

Lian Qi, Mo Ye and the others were still scared; they had no time to prepare for the blast. They would have been greatly injured, if not killed without the protection of Su Ping’s

pet.

At the moment, being wounded meant being out of the game. “A single heartbeat was already this destructive…”

Song Yuan stared at the black heart with shock and amazement. There was also infinite eagerness in his eyes; that kind of power was beyond his imagination. Without a doubt, the ancient corpse belonged to an unbelievably powerful creature when it was alive. Even Celestials would have been seen as ants, who could easily be killed!

The prospect of such power gave him a rush!

“Besides the beating heart, the sword also contributed to the destructive blast,” said Chunyu, narrowing his eyes, “The heartbeat activated the sword and their powers were combined. This heart… is still alive.”

“Is it possible that this ancient body is still alive? But there are already strange insects living inside; I heard that there are other beasts too…” Ji Xueqing seemed unconvinced. Han Ye said in a low voice, “Just because there are other creatures inside doesn’t mean that it’s dead. At least, the body we see is complete. Maybe… It was sealed.”

“Sealed? By that sword?”

“Aside from the owner of this ancient body, there was someone just as strong, if not stronger…” You Long’s voice carried a lot of mixed feelings. Beings with attainments beyond the Celestial State were extraordinary in their eyes, and they were seeing manifestations of two of them at the same time.

Whoosh!

Someone from another star zone suddenly took action at that moment; he rushed towards the sword piercing the heart.

The onlookers changed their expressions, fearing that the guy’s reckless actions would cause unpredictable danger. They also feared that the guy would take the sword away.

“Stop him!” someone shouted. The people of the Red Fire Star Zone were closer to the heart and instantly took action. Liu Xia roared furiously; several people attacked her the moment she made a move. They were the Heavenly Lord’s partners.

Liu Xia released a dark domain that swallowed all the incoming attacks. However, the momentary delay was enough for the rushing Heavenly Lord to reach the sword. His hands turned enormous as he made a grasping motion for the blade. He roared as he tried to pluck it.

The heart shook, perhaps triggered by the guy’s move, as if about to beat again.

The Heavenly Lord pulling the sword was shocked and infuriated; he pulled even harder. At that moment, however, the sword seemed to have been roused; it hummed and launched a fierce sword aura.

There was a boom, and the Heavenly Lord’s hands crumbled. His body was also cut apart by the sword aura.

The ominous aura pressed on. It completely shattered the Heavenly Lord and continued until it struck the wall of flesh, immediately causing a deep wound.

The Dao Patterns found in the wall were cut apart; they took a long time to heal.

The unfortunate Heavenly Lord gradually reappeared somewhere else, looking extremely weak and exhausted.

That was one of the last resorts he had prepared. His body was shattered by the sword and couldn’t be regenerated with laws; good thing that he had a last resort. Even so, his face was extremely pale at the moment, as he could tell that ninety percent of his soul had been shattered, and was even below the weakest Ascendant.

He was just like an above-average Star Lord

now.

“That attack…”

The sword aura lingered in his head; he would not forget the attack for as long as he lived. Furthermore, the lingering sword aura inside his head seemed to contain some sort of power that made him feel as if his body were being constantly ripped apart. The pain was rea; such a method was beyond his understanding.

“You should have known better!”

The others gave him unfriendly looks after noticing how weak he was.

Su Ping also noticed that the Heavenly Lord’s soul power was extremely weak; however, the guy was hiding his power really well. The former wouldn’t have discovered it without using the soul entity bloodline.

He’s not as strong as he seems. He’s turned from a Heavenly Lord into the weakest Ascendant… Su Ping’s eyes glittered as he planned to rob the guy, but decided to hold back and wait to do that later.

“That was close!”

Ji Xueqing was not entirely relieved with the guy’s failure. “Would the ancient being resurrect if the sword was pulled out? This sword must be of a realm beyond the Celestial State. It’s a weapon that was made for universe dominators!”

“But there doesn’t seem to be any legacy here,” said Chunyu calmly.

“The heart’s still beating, so the ancient body is still alive. The lack of a legacy is normal.” Song Yuan was slightly regretful. He had every reason to be; he would have fought tooth and nail if the universe dominator would have left something.

Su Ping glanced at them in silence.

There was something he wasn’t sure whether or not he should say.

Perhaps the legacy was right in front of them, although in a different form.

The Dao Glyphs found in the heart were enough for Su Ping to ponder over for a long time.

If only I could take this heart away, Su Ping thought. That way he would have enough time and a calm mind to analyze the glyphs.

Once his bloodline advanced, Su Ping learned from the Golden Crows’ Chief Elder that Dao Glyphs were the greatest treasures in the universe.

The Dao Glyphs found in the heart were the best legacy to be had.

Unfortunately, it would be too dangerous to stay and analyze them.

Deciphering a Dao Glyph would potentially require a tremendous amount of time.

“Do you think we can take out the sword if we destroy this heart?” Han Ye suddenly proposed.

Song Yuan looked at him and the others. He found that the people in other groups were also considering their options. He slightly shook his head and said, “I don’t think we’re strong enough to destroy this heart, and it may beat with even more power due to external stimulus.”

“If only we could bring our master here. Unfortunately, this is the Mayhem Star Zone; he would be suppressed by the laws of this place even if he comes.” Ji Xueqing heaved a sigh. A Celestial would surely have the power to fetch the sword piercing the heart, which was undoubtedly an unparalleled weapon; they could conquer the universe with the sword.

Su Ping understood Ji Xueqing’s implication and gave a slight head shake. It wouldn’t be a big deal even if the sword was fetched; the best weapons could only be wielded with a corresponding power. Celestials wouldn’t be strong enough to use all of the sword’s potential. He would have borrowed some weapons from Emperor Xin in the Archean Divinity if weapons alone were enough to conquer the universe.

The ancient corpse belonged to a being on par with Emperor Xin. The sword was probably a God Emperor’s weapon too. It wouldn’t be difficult for Emperor Xin to offer him one.

However, those weapons couldn’t be wielded if you didn’t have enough strength.

Star Lords couldn’t use the Ascendant weapons, either; it was the same principle.

“Since there aren’t any treasures here, why not go and take a look elsewhere? Maybe we’ll find something,” said Su Ping. He wasn’t planning on staying there any longer. The Dao Glyphs weren’t bad, but he didn’t have the time to study them right there.

Such a proposal left Song Yuan and the others in shock.

Even though they had yet to figure out how to take the heart and the sword away, they were undoubtedly unimaginable treasures. Isn’t Su Ping a bit too decisive, to simply abandon those treasures?

“Junior brother, why don’t we wait for a moment? Maybe another chance will pop up,” said Song Yuan while frowning.

Su Ping looked at them, realizing that they were reluctant to leave; he didn’t insist. “I’d like to take a look at other places. Why don’t we split up? No need to worry about me, senior brothers and sisters. I have Greeny to protect me; I’ll be able to escape even if there’s danger.” He spoke directly, without the use of telepathy.

People from other star zones turned to look; they were surprised to see that Su Ping was leaving

Song Yuan saw that Su Ping had made up his mind, but didn’t persuade him. Su Ping would be another competitor if he were to stay and other opportunities appeared.

They did have the same master, but such treasures outweighed their friendship.

“All right. Just come back if you run into any danger. We’ll be here,” said Song Yuan.

The strength displayed by Su Ping and his terrifying snake pet were reassuring. Song Yuan didn’t think he needed their protection.

“Junior brother, be safe.” Ji Xueqing heaved a sigh, seeing that Su Ping was so determined. She speculated that Su Ping had chosen to leave because he didn’t want to compete with them.

The people from the other star zones had glittering eyes when they saw Song Yuan and the others say their goodbyes. None of them regarded him as a mere Star Lord anymore.

Hai Mei glanced at him and frowned, but didn’t chase him in the end.

A bounty wasn’t worth it when they were that close to getting treasures.

Furthermore, she wasn’t confident of being strong enough to kill Su Ping, especially after noticing how the snake had resisted the blast. She also heard from her companions that Su Ping had instantly killed a Heavenly Lord in the past battle.

Unbelievable as it might sound, she knew that her companions weren’t lying; there had been a lot of witnesses. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

If only this genius could die here, Hai Mei thought.

Su Ping said goodbye to his seniors and left.

Su Ping thought for a moment and went to the stomach after exiting the chest area.

Maybe the legacy is not in the heart. Even if I don’t find any legacy, I can still capture the strange insects and study them.

Su Ping released the Void Bug, which had already grown and become a Star Lord. It had a silver shell and an extremely scary look.
