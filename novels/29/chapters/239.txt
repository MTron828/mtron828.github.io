Chapter 240 Off Limits!

“I am the one who has troubled you this time. I didn’t know there could be someone so powerful there. I will compensate you for your loss,” Yuan Tianchen said but his look was cold.

Venerable the Blade and the others stood up in fear.

“Master Yuan, your words bring shame to us. We failed to help you this time, and to make it worse, we hindered you. You have already shown us mercy by not punishing us!”

“Ziqing is right. That girl would have never beaten you if we weren’t there looking which surely distracted you, Master Yuan.”

“Master Yuan, I’m the one to blame. I didn’t investigate fully. That is why you underestimated your enemy. I am sorry!”

They were all in a mad rush to be the first to confess, show their regret, and claim that they should take the blame.

Venerable the Blade stared at them. They had taken away what he wanted to say before he had the chance to open his mouth.

How shameless of them!

Yuan Tianchen felt better to hear those words. He shook his head. “I don’t blame you. It is I who has been too careless. Besides, I don’t think there is only one legendary battle pet warrior in that shabby store. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been distracted and she wouldn’t have won!”

“Sure, of course.”

“There must be someone behind them. That young man did boss that girl around.” “I think we have been set up and it is not our fault. The young man certainly knew that we would be alerted after he became qualified to receive the legacy. He must have prepared the ambush at the store beforehand. Luckily, you realized that in time, Master Yuan. Or we could be in bigger trouble!”

Everyone was acting all “Master Yuan you are wise and responsible.” They did their best to save Yuan Tianchen’s dignity.

As for what had happened in reality, they all knew. But none of them were be dumb enough to show it.

Yuan Tianchen regained his serenity. Naturally, he was aware that those old foxes were just trying to give him some face. Deep down, both sides understood the reality of the situation but chose not to say so openly. This way, at the very least, it wouldn’t reflect so poorly on him.

He felt humiliated because of this matter. He was vexed but to conceal the fact was not possible, given the number of witnesses. The fact that others wouldn’t mention this even over and over in his presence would be more than good enough for him.

“Do not step in that store from now on. That store is off-limits. I will settle the scores with them after we have taken care of the Mysterious Realm matter!” Yuan Tianchen claimed.

The others felt a chill. There weren’t many places that could be tagged as “off-limits” by Yuan Tianchen.

Of course, given how dangerous the store was, it indeed should be off-limit. Even a legendary battle pet warrior had almost lost his life there!

“Master Yuan, is there anything else we can do for you about the Mysterious Realm?” Wu Guansheng asked with the utmost respect. He was almost fawning.

The others nodded and looked as if they were happy to take on more responsibilities. But inside, they wished they could stay as far away from this trouble as possible. After all was said and done, they weren’t the ones who would receive a legacy.

“Take some rest for the time being. I will notify you when the time is right.”

Yuan Tianchen went on with a glow in his eyes, “The day when the Mysterious Realm is open again is when all the lands have been explored. The young man has been marked as qualified for the legacy but he shall never obtain it, as long as there are lands still unexplored. In a short time, my granddaughter will be strong enough to pass the ninth dragon bone. She will also become qualified!”

The others looked at each other in surprise.

They all knew about Yuan Tianchen’s granddaughter. She was a true talent, a blessed girl!

She was far from being an average battle pet warrior. She had other rare skills!

Very few people around the entire world had her talent!

Since she was a kid, Yuan Tianchen had been devoting all his attention to her training. Three years back, when she was sixteen, she graduated from the best academy in the continent while being the overall No.1 ranker. She broke many records in the academy. She had attracted tremendous attention back then!

Two years prior, this girl had climbed to the seventh dragon bone, and back then, she was almost as capable as a titled battle pet warrior!

One year before, she grew stronger and reached the eight dragon bone!

Another year had passed. It was very likely that she could succeed once she challenged the ninth dragon bone.

“Master Yuan, you’re right. Given Lady Yuan’s talent, to come this time and obtain the qualification to receive legacy will be as easy as winking.”

“When the time comes, the dragon soul will choose between her and the young man. I believe that beating the young man will be child’s play for her.”

Everyone said flattering words.

But this time, they were not saying those words just to butter Yuan Tianchen up. They had met Yuan Tianchen’s granddaughter and they knew how amazing this girl was. They had all met many people in their lives but they had never seen anyone else among her peers that could match her abilities.

Of course, excluding the lady with the golden hair they had met in that worn-out store.

That lady with golden hair had almost taken away Yuan Tianchen’s life. She was a legendary battle pet warrior and a powerful one at that. They didn’t believe for a minute that she was as young as she appeared to be.

Yuan Tianchen was proud of his granddaughter. The biggest pride in his life was not his combat strength, but her.

He was confident that he could train his granddaughter well and she would surpass him!

“Tell the boards of those financial groups about the re-opening of the Mysterious Realm. Let them get more people ready. This time, the Mysterious Realm won’t be open to the public,” Yuan Tianchen said.

The others nodded. Inside, they felt sorry for the explorers. The original plan was that the Longtai Mountain would be open to society for three to five times more. However, because of Su Ping, Longtai Mountain had officially been closed from the public.

After the legacy was passed on, the Mysterious Realm would become useless.

24 hours had passed.

Ding!

Su Ping, who was sleeping in a nursing pen, woke up after the system’s “ding.”

He got up and heard the system saying, “Upgrade successful. The store is now at LV3! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Loading virtual map of the store...

“New functions of the store—”

Su Ping heard the system finishing all the messages. Then, he pulled up the interface of the store.

The displayed information included the record of income, information of the pets in the nursing pens and the ones to be picked up, etc. and on top was the profile picture of Su Ping and clicking the profile picture would allow him to see his personal information.

This information included his combat strength, rank, skills, and other aspects. It was quite comprehensive.

Su Ping browsed through his information and went to check the new functions of the store. He already knew what functions were going to be added, such as pet sales, test space, and professional training.

All of a sudden, Su Ping saw an employee form.

He clicked on the page. Currently, Joanna was the only one listed in the form.

Her identity and information were kept in a detailed record. As the store owner, it was within his right to check her information.
