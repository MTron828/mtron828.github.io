Chapter 444 The Conference

“It’s you!!”

The girl in the white dress had a startled look on her face.

Su Ping’s reaction was similar. “Yes, it is me.”

Shi Haochi, for some reason, was just as surprised. “You two?”

The two girls and Su Ping could not help but look at Shi Haochi. Why are you so surprised?

Shi Haochi came back to his senses. “Do you know each other?” he asked.

“No.”

“Yes.”

“Hmm!”

The three different replies came out at the exact same time. What a coincidence.

The hmm was said by the brunette. She crossed her arms in front of her chest. She was still upset since Su Ping had left so resolutely before.

Shi Haochi stood in a daze for two seconds. He put on his slippers and went inside while he introduced them to Su Ping, “They are my daughters, Zhenxiang and Tongtong.”

The girl in the white dress was Zhenxiang.

The brunette was Tongtong.

Su Ping darted a look at the girl in the white dress. So, her name was Shi Zhenxiang.

Shi Haochi introduced Su Ping, “This is Mr. Su, our honored guest. You can tell that Brother Su is our age but he is already a master trainer. How incredible!”

His two daughters stared at Su Ping in mute amazement.

Master trainer?

He?

This dude?

“Dad, have you been drinking today?” asked Tongtong, the short-haired brunette.

Shi Haochi refuted grumpily, “I didn’t drink. Be serious, I’m not joking. Be sure to learn from Brother Su. Don’t always think you are so talented; remember there is always someone better. Brother Su should be your example.”

Tongtong, being a short-tempered girl, retorted, “Dad, how old is he? Master trainer? Fat chance. Why haven’t I heard of him?”

Zhenxiang was sizing up Su Ping curiously.

Shi Haochi kept a straight face. “Do you know that our dog Big Yellow went to your bedroom and peed on your carpet last night?”

Tongtong stamped her feet. “When was that? How come I didn’t know?”

“So, there are things that you don’t know.” Shi Haochi snorted. He said to Su Ping as he stepped to the living room, “I have spoiled my daughters... They lack manners. Do not mind them.”

“Sure.”

Su Ping nodded.

The two girls rolled their eyes at Su Ping at the same time.

Shi Haochi told Su Ping to sit down and feel at home while he had to go upstairs to take care of something. Su Ping and the two girls were the only ones staying in the living room, of course, as well as some servants and maids that were like the proverbial third-wheel in the room.

The servants and maids: ???

Su Ping sat down on the couch and took the liberty to take a look around. That manor was in the Holy Light District and its value was at least in the hundreds of millions. The master trainers can sure make money! he exclaimed inwardly.

“Listen. How did you fool my dad?”

Tongtong raised her eyebrows as Su Ping sat down, really making himself at home. “Fool him? I don’t know. I just said a few words and your dad believed me,” Su Ping answered.

Tongtong knitted her eyebrows. Somehow, she felt Su Ping was pulling a prank and it sounded like her dad was not that smart.

“My dad is a master trainer. You’d better show me everything.” Tongtong sneered. “Everything... Do you mean in my soul or my body?”

“You!”

Tongtong blushed in anger.

This guy is a dog!

Zhenxiang blushed shyly as well. She pulled Tongtong’s hand. “Maybe there is something we’re not aware of. Let’s ask dad later.”

There was nothing that Tongtong could do to Su Ping. The only response she came up with was a snort.

Since the two girls were at a loss for words, Su Ping was enjoying the momentary happiness. Soon, Shi Haochi was done with his business. He came downstairs and saw the three in the living room. “So, how is it going? You’re all young people. I bet you’re getting along.” “We are getting along just fine.” Su Ping opened his eyes.

Lying through his teeth!

Enraged by his reply, Tongtong snorted again.

Feeling awkward, Zhenxiang kept silent.

“You must be hungry. I will tell them to get dinner ready,” Shi Haochi said with a smile. He told the maid to get the butler and to have dinner ready.

Shi Haochi sat down in the living room and told his daughters, “You two must learn from Brother Su. He will attend the master trainer conference tomorrow.”

“He’s attending the master trainer conference?!”

The two girls almost jumped up in shock.

No kidding.

It was enough that Su Ping fooled our dad. Now he’s going to attend the conference?

“Dad, you cannot be serious,” Tongtong shouted.

“I am serious.”

Shi Haochi added, “Brother Su was invited by the head office. Do you think I’m the one who invited him? What on earth are you thinking?”

“The head office?”

The two girls could not believe it.

They thought Su Ping had fooled their dad into taking him to the conference.

It turned out that Su Ping received the invitation from the head office. So...

The head office was also fooled by Su Ping?

Pah!

He truly is a master trainer?!

The two girls looked at each other. Both could see their shared astonishment in each other’s eyes.

They turned around to look at Su Ping who was still as composed as before. They became even more curious about him. A master trainer at such a young age? How was that even possible?

They had never heard of that before!

There was no one like him in the Holy Light Base City!

If everything was true, then he had broken the record of the youngest master trainer to date! “I’m not,” Su Ping answered. “You’re not?”

“I am.”

Tongtong was losing her mind. He was taunting her!

She shouldn’t have asked any questions.

Damn my mouth! Tongtong was mad at herself and Su Ping. She sat there, sulking. Shi Haochi smiled at his angry daughter. Finally, someone caught you off guard!

Soon, dinner was served. It was a fancy set up.

There were seafood and other meats but every dish was cooked with the most delicious parts of the edible beasts. In the afternoon, Shi Haochi had called home and told the maids to get ready.

It was the first time for Su Ping to enjoy such a grand meal. All of a sudden, he felt the benefit of money.

Money could still help even when a person had no combat strength!

At least, one could be well fed!

“Have you prepared the formal dresses for tomorrow’s conference?” Shi Haochi asked his daughters over dinner.

Zhenxiang nodded. “Yes.” Shi Haochi looked at the casual clothes Su Ping had on. “Brother Su, do you need me to prepare you a suit?” “Mm sunths.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Su Ping swallowed the food down. “No, thanks. That would be too much.”

He and Shi Haochi were neither relatives nor friends. He already felt bad enough by staying there... Although, he didn’t seem to be embarrassed when he gobbled down the food.

Of course, he wouldn’t go as far as to have Shi Haochi get him a suit.

Besides, he didn’t think there was anything wrong with his clothes. He had spent hundreds of coins on them.

“Sure.” Shi Haochi didn’t insist.

The two girls sized up Su Ping with weird looks on their faces. Was this guy really going to the conference? As a master trainer?

Both girls felt a surge of oddly-mixed feelings.

Envy, jealousy, hatred, sadness...

Ah, what a complicated mixture of emotions.

“I’m done!” Tongtong ran upstairs immediately after dinner. She could not wait to find out if Su Ping did have the skills of a master trainer at the next day’s conference.

Exchange ideas with other master trainers?

Su Ping would be so embarrassed if he were so utterly ignorant that he couldn’t answer any questions that the other master trainers asked!

Tongtong still didn’t trust her unreliable dad.

“Daddy, I’m full. Excuse me.” Zhenxiang put down her chopsticks and went upstairs as well.

The two girls were certainly sharing their secret thoughts upstairs right then. Shi Haochi shook his head. “Brother Su, don’t mind them. Enjoy yourself,” he said to Su Ping. “Sure thing.” Su Ping made a clean sweep of the dishes.
