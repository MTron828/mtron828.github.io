Chapter 1530: The Most Difficult Thing In the World (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Only those existences could easily detect their thoughts.

“We’re here hoping to strike an alliance with them. Their attitude doesn’t seem right,” said Su Ping.

He was only being polite. So far it felt like the treatment used when dealing with prisoners.

Elaine’s face was green. Su Ping was truly bold to freely speak his mind while being on the territory of the Ti Tuo Clan.

Her only concern was that the cyborgs could be implicated. With a bitter smile, she said, “Ancestor Su, we should be grateful that they’re willing to take us in. Don’t overthink.”

!!

She then winked at him.

Su Ping understood what she meant, so he dropped the subject.

He remembered how arrogant the Original Dragons were back then. The Ti Tuo Clan was indeed not bad in comparison.

He heaved a sigh in his heart, and set about transferring the humans stationed in the green glass planet.

The cyborg Ancestral Gods approached Su Ping. Their leader said, “Ancestor Su, the available space is limited. We might live here for 100,000 years or even longer… The human population is limited. How do you think we should divide the territory…?”

“We’ll split it,” replied Su Ping, before the other could finish.

Then, he thought for a moment and said, “However, to thank you for leading the way, I’ll give you twenty percent more.”

“Ancestor Su, all the human population is but a tenth of ours…” said another cyborg Ancestral God with a gloomy face. It was obvious that they wanted to divide it according to the current proportions, 9:1. That was reasonable for them.

After all, they had guided Su Ping to that place.

Su Ping narrowed his eyes and looked at them. “We’ve traveled together for a long time. Do you really want to fight over territory?”

“We don’t know anything about companionship. We only know that resources should be alloted in the most reasonable way,” said another cyborg expert, emitting pressuring waves. He was cold and impolite to Su Ping.

Su Ping gazed at him and said, “Then, what’s the reasonable distribution according to you?”

“The law of the universe dictates that the strong take all. Ancestor Su, I hope that you won’t make things difficult for us!” said another cyborg Ancestral God.

Su Ping took a deep breath, once he saw that they had already cornered him with words.

He wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t.

The deep breath he took eventually became a heavy sigh. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even his travel companions were fighting him over territory. No wonder Ancestral God Ti Tuo said that there would be conflicts.

Shouldn’t their enemy be the Heavens?

Su Ping only felt bored after such a response. He simply said, “If you’re talking about the law of the universe, let’s just split it up. As thanks for leading the way, I’ll give half of the territory.”

“What are you talking…”

The cyborg Ancestral Gods were stunned and turned cold. However—before anyone could take action—a wind was already sweeping about, destroying the Great Dao. None of the Ancestral Gods were able to see any rays of light. Their world was consumed by darkness!

Once they regained their senses, they discovered that the wind had stopped blowing.

Behind them was a bottomless ravine that ran to the edge of that zone.

“This will be the border.”

Only Su Ping’s voice was heard in the end. He had turned around and left.

The cyborg Ancestral Gods narrowed their eyes and looked at the figure who was moving away. They then looked at the terrifying ravine.

They could have done a similar destructive feat. However, the lingering aura in the ravine terrified them. The pure and abundant Dao power was enough to wipe them out!

“He’s not a human being… He’s a true member of the Primitive Chaos Clan!” said one of the cyborg experts with a shaky voice.

“We shouldn’t have suspected the senses of that Ti Tuo expert…” Another cyborg had a contorted expression, awfully regretful. Having the bloodline from the Primitive Chaos Clan, Su Ping could grow and become a top Undying State existence, one that only those who carried the heritage of the twelve Sorcerer Ancestors could defeat.

“We misjudged him.” The cyborg leader was also somber. He didn’t expect such terrifying power to be hidden under Su Ping’s human guise.

Elaine was stunned; she looked at Su Ping’s back as he left. For some reason, she didn’t feel any fury or killing intent exuding from that back, only loneliness.

…

After setting the border, Su Ping summoned his master and the others living in the Nine States.

He informed them of the situation and asked them to settle down. It would be another temporary settlement after a long trip.

However, nobody knew how long they would stay there.

After everyone was properly settled, Su Ping flew to the high sky and called out, “Ti Tuo…”

There was a swooshing sound. Ripples gathered before his eyes as Ancestral God Ti Tuo appeared. He gazed at Su Ping and asked, “Descendant of the Primitive Chaos Clan, what do you want?”

Su Ping gazed at him and said, “I want to know how long we’ll have to wait here. Is the Sorcerer Ancestor waiting for other Sorcerer Ancestors, or for enough races to gather? What’s the plan and strategy to cope with the Heavens?”

“You’re asking too many questions,” said the ancestor host unhappily, “You don’t need to know the Sorcerer Ancestor’s arrangements. You’ll be informed when it’s time for you to know!

“Fighting the Heavens is an important matter. All you need is to follow orders; there’s no need to think about anything else!”

As he stared at the latter, Su Ping said, “So, we can only wait indefinitely in this place?”

“If you don’t want to wait, you may choose to leave,” said the tentacled ancestor coldly, “The Sorcerer Ancestor was merciful enough to give you a place to stay. You should be grateful.”

Su Ping nodded and said, “Indeed, we are grateful for being given a place to live. It is a great favor. I only want to know how we’re going to deal with the Heavens. I hope that we can make the best use of our power. If there are any plans, we can prepare in advance.”

“As I said, you only need to follow orders. Don’t think too much,” said Ancestral God Ti Tuo impatiently.

Su Ping looked at him but didn’t say anything else. He turned around and returned to the human zone.

…

Led by Shen Huang, Chi Ying and the others, the desolate continent was divided into different territories. Buildings and cities were built; it was easy for them to construct anything.

Once the cities were finished, the Ascendant cultivators came out from the universes of experts Shen Huang and the others. They in turn released the Star Lords and the residents in their small worlds and assigned them to different cities.

The new cities became lively soon after.

It only took a few days to transform the desolate land into prosperous settlements.

Su Ping didn’t travel to other places. He returned to his store and continued training in cultivation sites with the Dark Dragon Hound and his other pets.

Already mentalized for an indefinite waiting time, Su Ping planned to seize the time and improve himself to the maximum while he also waited for the system to wake up.

Time moved on.

Su Ping traveled on the cultivation sites. He traversed many high-ranked sites and saw all kinds of species, which had assorted battle skills. Even though their skills were fundamentally based on the Great Dao, he could still learn a lot from them.

The Chaotic Realm of the Undead. It is said that all the living creatures are bound to reincarnate there after they die…

Su Ping had checked every corner of the Chaotic Realm of the Undead and killed dozens of Ancestral Gods. However, there was no sign of the Little Skeleton in that place.

He had tried searching the place earlier on. He wasn’t an Ancestral God back then, and there were dangerous places he couldn’t enter.

At the moment, he had almost turned the whole place upside down.

The system has never lied to me. Never. So, there’s gotta be another way… Su Ping was standing atop a mountainous beast’s body; he looked into the distance for a moment, then chose to return to the store with his pets.

He quickly noticed that his store had changed greatly the moment he got back.
