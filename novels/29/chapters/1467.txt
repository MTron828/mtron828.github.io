Chapter 1468 New Road (1)

“How audacious!”

A Golden Crow who had a universe dominator level scolded him.

“It’s fine.” The Chief Elder wasn’t bothered. Instead, he looked at Su Ping in surprise and asked, “You want to observe my universe? There’s actually a road applicable to everyone if you want to cultivate an undying universe. This is unnecessary.”

“Even so, I’d like to try a different road,” said Su Ping.

!!

The system had also told him about the existence of cultivation methods for the Undying State. Although a step higher than the Dao Heart State, it involved the use of a tricky method, while the Dao Heart was based on talent.

There were billions of Dao Hearts, but only one method to cultivate the undying universe.

The crux of it was to combine the infinite Great Dao in the universe! Once achieved, the universe would be the Great Dao and the Great Dao would become the universe.

The Great Dao was indestructible.

It was difficult for many universe dominators to become Ancestral Gods because the Great Dao they had comprehended was too complicated. They were unable to find the order or the core to combine all the Great Dao.

Such a task would cost an infinite amount of time for them to reorganize their combat abilities. Some universe dominators would disrupt their own selves during the combination. After all, such reorganization was different from cultivating from scratch using a clone. It would entail overthrowing everything they had and building the one and only Great Dao using the broken pieces.

“You want to try another path?”

The Chief Elder was slightly amused by the idea. “Kid, this is different from the Dao Heart State, which is not teachable and has to be comprehended on your own. The Undying State is the same for everyone; there’s no shortcut, other than combining the Great Dao.”

“I’m not planning to take shortcuts. I’m simply hoping to find a more powerful road…” said Su Ping, “Maybe there isn’t one, but I’d like to give it a try.”

The Chief Elder dropped his smile and gazed at Su Ping. “Why do you think there’s a more powerful road?”

“Because I think there are always many options to reach the end. Just like life; the destination is the same, but anything can happen on the way,” said Su Ping.

“But that’s just for superficial lives,” said the Chief Elder, “The combination of the Great Dao is the only way. None of the ancestors of the other clans have ever thought of a better way.”

“This doesn’t mean that there’s no better way,” said Su Ping.

The Chief Elder fell silent.

He looked at the determined yet passionate young man and thought of many things all of a sudden. He realized why that young man grew so strong so quickly and how he could surpass Diqiong, their princess, who carried the ancestral bloodline of his clan.

The two of them were on par in the past. Diqiong was actually the stronger one.

However, she had been left far behind by Su

Ping.

“Should I say that you’re ignorant, or arrogant?” The Chief Elder chuckled. “But I like it. Maybe you’ll truly find another way. Although the chances are close to zero, I’d like to be part of it. Not just me, I’ll ask the other old fellows to show you their universes, too.”

Dazed for a moment, Su Ping said quickly, “Thank you very much, Chief Elder!”

“That’s all right. If you truly make a breakthrough, we’ll be witnessing a new miracle. You’ll probably become an ancestor-level existence that wasn’t naturally created…” said the Chief Elder with a smile.

The nearby Golden Crows narrowed their eyes and looked at the tiny human in shock, not expecting the Chief Elder to think so highly of the young man.

The ancestors had been spawned by nature; it was impossible to reach that level through cultivation. And yet, this tiny human being has a slim chance of becoming an ancestor?

Even though the chance was slim, it was still terrifying!

“Chief Elder, you flatter me. Let’s begin,” said Su Ping with a calm smile.

The Chief Elder nodded slightly.

He had witnessed Su Ping’s growth in that period of time. Once upon a time, the guy was an ant that he could kill a million times just by blowing air at him. However, the guy had already caught up to him.

The Chief Elder then released his universe and pulled Su Ping inside.

“Chief Elder, please perform freely. No need to worry,” said Su Ping.

The elder crow nodded. He knew that Su Ping’s mysterious backer could ensure his safety.

The power inside that universe surged like a tsunami. Su Ping instantly felt that the entire universe was squeezing him; that limitless cosmos was solid, completely different from a Dao Heart universe.

When in the Dao Heart State, although the power of the Great Dao was unified through the Dao Heart, the power was still disorganized and the weaker Dao would be neutralized, like someone being slapped by a thousand hands. When reaching the Undying State, the power of the thousand hands would concentrate on one hand

Increasing power dozens of times.

S

Therefore, there was an insurmountable barrier between Ancestral Gods and God Emperors. Su Ping focused on sensing all the details of the great crow’s universe. Once the Great Dao was combined, those characteristics were gradually revealed. It was the Great Dao of annihilation that burned the Great Dao around Su Ping into ashes, including his vitality.

Is this the combined Great Dao? It’s absolutely unstoppable, thousands of times more powerful than a single perfect Great Dao… Su Ping examined the power. He was like a worm under a heavy machine. He was crushed by it, completely unable to resist.
