Chapter 678 Hunting and Moving!

“Seriously?”

The system sneered.

Su Ping raised his eyebrows. Yes, seriously!

He was trying to nurture his relationship with his employee!

Beep, beep! Joanna was thinking about where to capture the beast kings when she heard a beep in her mind. Next, a transparent virtual window emerged in front of her eyes.

“The store owner has given you a mission. Read or not?”

“A mission.”

Joanna looked at Su Ping and read the mission.

Soon, the description appeared. Helping Su Ping capture 40 beast kings of the Void State could earn her... 35 merit points!

35?

Joanna could not believe that.

She knew how many merit points she had and she was paying close attention to her progress. She was willing to work in Su Ping’s store just because the employee’s benefits were enticing!

She could visit the Archean Divinity with another 35 merit points!

“Accept the mission,” Su Ping said to her, kindly.

Joanna took a deep and long look at him, then accepted the mission. “Let’s go. We should try to get this done while this place is still in peace,” Su Ping said.

A swirl appeared next to them.

Joanna nodded. Together, they stepped into the swirl.

Demigod Burial.

Two people appeared on a hill in the wilderness.

Joanna looked around; she didn’t perceive any danger, much to her relief. She said to Su Ping, “I’ve sent a message to my original self; the servant will be here soon. We can wait here.”

“Sure.”

Su Ping nodded. Joanna went to the side and sat down to think.

Su Ping didn’t distract her. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The air in front of them began to tremble a moment later. A strong bodied giant that was close to five meters tall appeared. It had a rugged look, deep eyes and a high nose. It seemed that the passage of time had left a mark in his gaze. “Your highness.”

The middle-aged giant crossed one arm in front of his chest and lowered his head.

“Good.” Joanna reacted like a lady of noble birth. “You know why I called you here, right? Take us to the Abyss.”

“The Abyss? That place is run by Tina Crane, the Superior God. Would we...” The middle-aged giant was hesitant.

“So?”

Joanna gazed at the giant. The giant apologized in a hurry. “I am sorry, your Highness. Please forgive me.”

“Do not worry about that. Time is pressing. Let’s go,” Joanna commanded.

Su Ping looked at her. She looked nothing like when she was in the store. She was the queen of that place.

“Yes.”

The middle-aged giant lowered his head. He was curious about Su Ping but didn’t ask about that human. The giant swung his fingers across the air and made a welcoming gesture.

Joanna said to Su Ping, “Let’s go.”

Su Ping nodded. He stepped into the portal without asking any questions.

The middle-aged giant was even more curious after seeing that Su Ping was walking in front of Joanna. Even so, the giant held back the urge to ask any questions.

There was a transparent corridor inside that spatial swirl. Su Ping felt like he was walking inside a white misty glass tube, but the texture under his feet was very soft, as if he were stepping on a cloud.

Behind him was a powerful presence.

The middle-aged giant was the servant waiting on Joanna’s original self.

He felt that this being was way more powerful than the Star Rank dragon he had seen in the World of Purple-blood Dragons.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man said, “We’re here.”

Another swirl opened up at the end of the tunnel, revealing the view outside. It was a desolate, dark world outside; it had countless dark patches in the sky, reddish brown, dark purple, khaki... It was like a cluster of different colored clouds mixed together.

Su Ping stepped out of the tunnel. The chilly wind made him tremble.

He was quite resistant to the cold, and yet he was trembling. One could imagine how harsh the environment was.

“That’s the Abyss,” Joanna said to Su Ping.

She pointed to a certain direction. Su Ping saw a gate; it was more like the railings inside a jail than a gate. Pillars several meters thick were standing there, and the frame of the gate was very high; the place exuded a wild and ancient atmosphere, as well as bursts of a bloody stench.

“The Abyss is the largest prison in the Demigod Burial,” Joanna explained, “Not only do we keep gods here, but also extremely violent and wicked beasts. We’re going to pick beasts here because they’re going to be better than those of the same rank found outside. You wouldn’t have to train them.”

Su Ping was surprised. He finally knew why Joanna chose to go there.

“Thank you,” he said.

Joanna smiled gently. “Don’t mention it. I’m just trying to get the mission done.”

The middle-aged giant narrowed his eyes. Mission? Who is qualified enough to give her missions?

The giant found Su Ping more and more mysterious.

“Go ahead. I will let you take care of the rest,” Joanna said to the middle-aged giant.

The latter lowered his head and said yes. He flew over and soon reached the gate of the Abyss prison.

Soon after, a swirl appeared in the air and a man approached them.

That man was dressed up like a prison guard, although his uniform had been exquisitely done.

The two exchanged some words, then the man darted a glance at Joanna and Su Ping. Soon, the middle-aged giant returned. “Your highness, he said yes. We can enter now.”

“Okay.” Joanna nodded.

Again, Su Ping didn’t ask any questions. The middle-aged giant unleashed Divine Energy over Su Ping and Joanna; he took them to the largest prison in the Demigod Burial.

The world within the prison gate was not what Su Ping had imagined. It was a chaotic place. There were many islands floating in the air, and there was a large piece of land at the center.

Joanna puckered her lips toward the land and explained, “The most important prisoners are kept there. We will only go to the islands. After all, we’re only looking for Void State beast kings; we don’t have to get to that land.” “Okay.”

Su Ping nodded.

He knew nothing about that place. He merely had to follow Joanna’s lead.

The three of them reached a spacious island. Su Ping even had a feeling that the island was as large as half a continent!

As soon as they arrived, Su Ping felt that something was hidden in the forest on that island.

The middle-aged giant suddenly said, “Get over here!”

The next second, the air in front of Su Ping seemed to be boiling. Five beasts emerged.

The five beasts were massive; some were even hundreds of meters tall. Their common trait was their violent and wicked nature. They floated and curled up in the lair. It seemed that something had imprisoned them and stopped them from moving.

“Those five are evil beasts at the Void State,” The middle-aged giant said.

Su Ping was shocked. That was the power of a god’s servant!

He had merely said two words and then five Void State beasts were imprisoned and dragged over. Su Ping could not even understand that power.

“Do you want them?” Joanna asked Su Ping.

Su Ping came back to his senses and nodded. “Yes, yes.”

The five Void State beasts were unable to move, but Su Ping was happy to perceive their violent presence. Those beasts were much more intimidating when compared to similar ranked beasts on the Blue Planet.

“Put them away,” Joanna said to the middle-aged giant.

The middle-aged giant nodded. He didn’t do anything but a swirl appeared and the five beasts were sucked in before it closed. “They’re all in my worldlet,” the middle-aged giant said. Worldlet?

Su Ping found it interesting.

“Keep going,” Joanna said.

The middle-aged giant nodded and closed his eyes. He later yanked Void beasts over. “Do you want them?” “Yes!”

“How about those?”

“Affirmative.”

“And this insect?”

“Sure, will do.”

He was there to find beasts, but somehow, Su Ping felt he had found a sugar mommy who was taking him to see some luxury stores with her bodyguards.

“I want that, too.”

“This is nice.”

“Yes, definitely yes.”

The three of them flew past one island after the other. The middle-aged giant would capture the Void State beasts so that Su Ping could choose from them. He was pleased by what the giant brought them in most cases.

Several hours later,

The middle-aged giant put the last three beasts into his worldlet and informed Joanna, “Your highness, we have captured enough.”

Joanna asked Su Ping, “Do you want more?”

Su Ping was intrigued but he could tell that the middle-aged giant was frowning. He remembered what the giant had said before they went there. That place clearly belonged to a Superior God; Joanna couldn’t just do whatever she wanted there.

“No. Those will do.” Su Ping shook his head.

Joanna raised her eyebrows. “Are you sure? This isn’t like you.”

What am I like?

Su Ping rolled his eyes and said, “It’s getting late and I have to take them back. I don’t know how many trips I’ll have to take.”

“If you say so.” Joanna knew that Su Ping was worried about the situation outside. She turned to the middle-aged giant and said, “We can go back.”

“Good.” The middle-aged giant was relieved. He used Divine Energy and took the two visitors away from the prison.

“That prison was quiet.”

Su Ping gazed at the floating islands. That place seemed quite peaceful. Joanna corrected him, “Actually, many crimes and murders are committed here. The noisy guys are killed first. Quiet people are those who can live on in a hunting game.”

Su Ping didn’t offer a reply.

Soon, the middle-aged giant teleported them back to the mountain where Joanna lived on.

As the three of them emerged, the many Celestial Gods and two God Warriors approached them. The God Warriors were at the Star Rank. All of the gods were surprised when they recognized the giant.

“Your highness!”

“Your highness!”

The gods greeted Joanna.

Joanna waved back at them.

The middle-aged giant bowed to Joanna. “Your highness, I’ll take out those beasts and let two God Warriors guard them for you. I’ll have to go back to your care for your original self.”

“Okay.” Joanna nodded.

The two God Warriors were capable enough to contain those Void State beasts.

The middle-aged giant was relieved. He lifted his finger; a swirl with a golden glow appeared on the ground; many violent beasts came out from the swirl. They rolled out from it, as a matter of fact, because something had wrapped them up in a ball.

Dong, dong, dong! Those beasts fell to the ground, making the mountain shake.

“Shrink!” The middle-aged giant shouted. The next second, something miraculous happened: those beasts shrank from hundreds of meters tall to only a few meters tall.

Although shrunk, those beasts were still emitting a vicious energy. It was just that they looked less intimidating.

Soon, a set of forty smaller versions of the Void State beasts contained in spheres were placed on the ground.

The middle-aged giant said with great respect, “Your highness, I will excuse myself.”

Joanna nodded.

Su Ping found it strange, to see a giant showing such respect to Joanna.

Once the middle-aged giant left, Joanna told the God Warriors to contain those tiny beasts.

“How are you going to take the beasts back? Do you have any storage space?” Joanna asked Su Ping.

Su Ping forced a bitter smile and shook his head. “I will have to sign a contract with them and take them to the store one group at a time.”

Joanna could not believe that. “Contract? You already have some battle pets. I don’t think you have many spots left. Also, canceling the contract would mean that you would get hurt. If you don’t have such storage items... I can lend you one.” “Why don’t you just give me one?”

“Don’t be so cheeky.”

“I’m okay with that...” Su Ping shrugged his shoulders. “Don’t worry. I won’t take your item. I’ve asked many things from you and I’m quite mortified.’

“When did you grow a conscience?” Joanna asked.

Su Ping rolled his eyes. “We don’t have enough time. I will start taking them back; you can have your people stay here and watch them.”

Of course, he wanted to use something to take the beasts back in one go but the damn rules from the system forbade him to do that.

Otherwise, he would have become rich. The entire universe would be his supplier. He could take the most violent beast back to his store thanks to his ability to revive.

However, the system rules stipulated that he could only carry beasts he had signed contracts with Only the power of a contract could avoid the force of repulsion between different worlds; it was impossible to do that with artifacts.
