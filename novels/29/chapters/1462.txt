Chapter 1464 Upper Limit of the Cultivation Method (1)

After witnessing those actions, the cyborgs gradually changed their minds.

Soon, the matches ended. The final score was 39:61.

The humans, with sixty-one points, had won by a landslide.

However, the cyborgs found the scores completely acceptable. They weren’t sad or ashamed at all. They were proud, even.

It wasn’t easy for them to score thirty-nine points from the humans, who were essentially cheating!

After the crushing defeats at the beginning, they felt proud when their compatriots won, despite being outnumbered.

See? That’s what us cyborgs do! We cultivate ourselves! We beat the enemy even if we’re outnumbered!

Once the Star State matches were done, the Star Lords’ contest would take place a couple of days after.

All the cyborgs discussed human beings and their cultivation method during that waiting period.

Some mocked and despised the cultivation method, while others thought it was incredible. If all humans had the strongest beasts as pets, they would be invincible at their level!

That was the upper limit!

Even the dissenting cyborgs also had to admit that.

Shen Huang had sent someone to mingle with the cyborgs, all to collect intel and learn of the public opinion during the few days of rest.

Based on the cyborgs’ thoughts, Shen Huang realized that the purpose of the friendly contest had been fulfilled halfway.

Many cyborgs were angry and scornful because of how the battles turned out; however, they both loved and hated the cultivation method.

Why did they hate it?

In most cases, people would only hate something when they couldn’t get it.

The Star Lords’ battles soon began.

This time, it was twenty against twenty.

Shen Huang thought that it was necessary to pressure the cyborgs some more. To make it less eye-catching, he set the overall objective to thirty-one points.

Thanks to Shen Huang’s arrangement, all the candidates were picked. The first three battles showed the humans’ extraordinary combat ability with crushing victories. The cyborgs fell silent again.

A subsequent match was deliberately lost to save the cyborgs’ face.

Shen Huang was calmly sitting at the auditorium. He was like a bartender seated behind the counter, although it wasn’t wine he was mixing, but the cyborg’s moods.

When having absolute control over the battlefield, he could decide when to win or lose. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

As the matches finished one after the other, the final score was undoubtedly fixed at thirty-one.

They won eleven matches, while the cyborgs only won nine of them.

The latter could accept those results, but they felt a greater pressure about the upcoming battles. They realized that the higher the level, the more terrifying the human’s cultivation method was!

The higher someone’s level was, the more difficult it was for them to defeat opponents at higher levels. It was usually difficult for an Ascendant to kill another Ascendant, not to mention dealing with a couple of peers.

There was a lot that the cyborgs didn’t know about the human’s cultivation method. For example, how many beasts could be contracted?

If the number was unlimited…

Wouldn’t they be invincible?

Basha and the others looked grim. The ten against ten battles would begin soon. If humans were as domineering as in the other matches, they would probably only win in two or three, which would be humiliating.

Shen Huang smiled inwardly when he saw their expressions. That was the result he was going for. The friendly contest had only been a prelude in his plans; he was about to achieve his final purpose.

Soon after, the Ascendant State battles began.

The experts sent to represent humanity were Heavenly Lords from the various star zones, including Song Yuan, Shen Huang’s first disciple.

“Master, do I have to use my pets?”

Song Yuan went to see his master before the match. He said, “I’ve been observing the cyborgs’ battles for days, and I’ve learned something about how they utilize their energy. Although their fighting method is special, it’s not that powerful; I want to see if I can fight them on my own.”

He was confident in himself.

He believed that he could win without summoning pets.

Although pets represented the most important strength of a battle pet warrior, how could they go far if they weren’t strong enough to suppress their own pets?

Seeing the fighting will in his disciple’s eyes, Shen Huang shook his head and said, “This is not about battling, but politics. We’re demonstrating the relationship between us and our pets. Also, there’s no need to reveal too many of our secrets in a friendly contest. We are allies now, but we can’t show them everything just yet.”

Song Yuan felt dazed for a moment. He then understood.

He was once the leader of a small galaxy; its management made him aware of the importance of power.

“I understand.”

“Go.”

Soon after, the Ascendant State battles began.

The Heavenly Lords went up one after another. Their battle pets were all in the Ascendant State, too; after all, Star Lord pets would have only been toys in the eyes of Ascendant cultivators, and would be instantly killed in battle.

In one of the matches, an Ascendant cultivator summoned eight Ascendant State pets; the cyborg contender desperately wanted to forfeit.

It was impossible for him to beat nine opponents.

The humanoid tried to fight, but was soon defeated. He had displayed a terrifying power, but he was completely unable to resist the attacks of the eight pets.

After such a crushing victory, the cyborgs increasingly felt the horror that humans posed. The stronger the human, the more terrifying they were!
