Chapter 1456 Information (1)

The group of Celestials felt a chill when they saw how obedient Kayafollet was.

Su Ping read through Kayafollet’s memories; it was as if he would have personally explored the cyborgs universe. There were indeed many green glass planets, well hidden in the deep spaces.

However, she didn’t encounter the monsters mentioned by Iris.

The only creature found was a regular beast.

Is it possible that the universe is so vast that Kayafollet never reached the place where Iris lives? Su Ping’s eyes glittered. He felt that something was amiss.

After some pondering, he decided to explore the place in person.

Even if he encountered an Ancestral God cyborg, he could hide in the store.

“System, if I die here, can I resurrect by paying energy?” Su Ping asked in his heart.

The system replied, “No, it’s only possible in cultivation sites.”

“Isn’t this place a cultivation site?”

The system stayed silent.

Su Ping felt helpless. The system could be quite rigid sometimes, but there was nothing he could do about it.

He would be invincible if he could resurrect in the outside world with energy. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After all, the energy required to resurrect was only one tenth the ticket cost.

“Guys, I’m planning to go exploring. You should be prepared. We’ll settle down for now if the place is safe,” said Su Ping to the others, sharing his plan.

Shen Huang instantly asked, “Wouldn’t it be too dangerous?”

“It’s risky, but it’s worth a shot,” said Su Ping, “We’ll retreat if we happen to run into a hostile Undying State being.”

Stunned, Shen Huang asked, “Will we be able to retreat?”

“No problem.”

One of the Celestials asked prudently, “Wouldn’t there be a chance that we run across those ultimate lives above the Undying State that Boss Su described before?”

Su Ping shook his head. “Those kinds of existences don’t live here; otherwise, they would have detected us, despite the barrier protecting the universe.”

There was a collective tongue-clicking at the thought, as it was impossible for them to understand such existences.

“Since retreating is possible, we can give it a try,” said Xu Kong.

Chi Huo nodded and chimed in, “Us floating around is not enough; it would be much better if we have a place to settle down. Maybe we can even set up an alliance with the locals.”

Su Ping nodded.

Once everyone was onboard, Shen Huang told the others to gather the people under their command.

All the survivors were excited and nervous when they learned that a new universe had been found.

Everything was prepared. Su Ping then placed his store, all the Celestial cultivators, and the planets with residents into his universe. Later he approached the barrier of the new universe and made a hole to sneak in.

He concealed his aura using the top secret technique he learned from the Heaven Path Institute. Before him was a dark and quiet universe, just as he had seen earlier. However, this time he could personally feel everything about it; he discovered a thin Great Dao pervading that space.

There are some signs of war. What an intense aura of death…

Su Ping’s eyes glittered. A great war had indeed taken place in that universe, which destroyed laws and Dao. They had yet to recover.

He spread out his senses, sending them throughout space. He discovered a lot of decaying auras which belonged to floating corpses in the deeper layers.

Most corpses were from Celestials or God Emperors. The former only had bones left, while the latter were relatively intact. Their faces were still visible; they were all bluish cyborgs.

Su Ping’s heart felt heavy. That universe had definitely been powerful and advanced. Nonetheless, they were almost annihilated by the Heavens.

This made him act more cautiously. He roamed the area, occasionally seeing monsters wandering in deep spaces. They seemed to have evolved by absorbing the energy from the floating bodies.

Soon enough, Su Ping found a green glass planet.

It was hidden in the eighth space, and was as tiny as a grain of dust, floating randomly. Su Ping would have easily overlooked it if he hadn’t been carefully searching.

Su Ping flashed and approached the tiny planet. He carefully tore an opening and snuck in.

A world as insignificant as an atom actually had a vast territory.

Hardly had he entered when he saw an extremely prosperous land, where countless futuristic cities were standing. A lot of bluish cyborgs were living there.

Su Ping had left a gap in his inner universe; that way his master and the other Celestials could see the outside world.

After that, Su Ping made sure his aura was concealed and quietly entered a city.

He quickly transformed into a bluish cyborg to mix into the crowd.

Su Ping had learned the cyborgs’ language from Iris. Still a ways before he became proficient, but daily communication wasn’t a problem. The young cyborg he transformed into walked on the streets and passed by other cyborgs.

He was careful as he stretched out his senses. After covering the entire city, he discovered that the strongest cyborg was only in the Ascendant State. He immediately captured a random passerby and took him to a deep space to browse through his memories.

The captured cyborg didn’t feel a thing as he was restrained. Both time and space was entirely paused.
