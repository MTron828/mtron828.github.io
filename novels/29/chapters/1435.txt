Chapter 1437 Dao Ancestor (1)

“Rain Ancestor, what are you doing?”

The other four gods were shocked and angry to see the Rain Ancestor’s look. Although his attacks were aimed at the ferocious beast, it actually disrupted their pace in the battle.

They also realized that the man didn’t seem to be in his right mind.

“Go finish off the brat already. You’re not needed here. What’s taking you so long?” roared an Ancestral God.

The others were also anxious, and wanted to lend a hand to deal with Su Ping on his behalf; all to not have that annoying little flying around. However, they didn’t want to get involved with the Heaven Path Institute. The grudge with the Rain Clan had taken root. If they recklessly killed their Dao Child, the institute’s three Ancestral Gods could later look for an explanation.

“I can’t kill him…”

The Rain Clan looked at him gloomily. “Can any of you kill him for me? The Rain Clan will take the blame if the Heaven Path Institute wants to avenge him!”

“Are you kidding?”

The man’s request left all the gods in shock. An Ancestral God had just said that he couldn’t kill a God King.

No matter what a genius he is, can he really face an Ancestral God with his cultivation?

“Rain Ancestor, do you realize what you’re saying?” roared an Ancestral God who had scales all over his body, making him look like a dragon king.

The Rain Ancestor was rather frustrated too. He wanted to find out if others could kill Su Ping. Did something really happen to me?

“Cut the crap. Which of you can do this for me? I will thank you properly when we’re done, and I won’t let the Heaven Path Institute come to you for trouble!” The Rain Ancestor gnashed his teeth.

Roar!

The Chaos Perception Dragon’s roar was suddenly heard. It dragged them all into its universe of chaos. Demonic sounds surged from all directions; all the Ancestral Gods felt awful, as if in a drunken state.

“Hilarious!”

While resisting the beast’s attack, the Ancestral Gods were angered because of their fellow god’s request.

“This is a problem between you and the Heaven Path Institute. Are you scared of them? If so, we’ll head back right now!” said the charming Ancestral Goddess, not as relaxed as before.

“Rain Ancestor, you’re the only one who can take care of this problem. If you’re truly scared, just tell us. Don’t waste our time,” said another Ancestral God.

The Rain Clan ancestor bellowed, “I said it before, the Rain Clan is utterly incompatible with the Heaven Path Institute. If they want to avenge the Dao Child, they have to first deal with the Rain Clan. I will take the blame if any of you kills him for me!”

“You can’t kill a Dao Child? Who’d believe that?” said an Ancestral God, disdain in his eyes.

The Rain Ancestor felt frustrated. He couldn’t describe Su Ping’s weirdness. It was too unbelievable.

Exactly at this moment, a tall Ancestral God who was glowing like the sun said coldly, “Let me do it. Rain Ancestor, don’t forget your promise. This brat killed a God Emperor of the Chentian Clan. My actions would be seen as outrageous. However, you must take the blame if I kill him!”

“No problem!” said the Rain Ancestor, feeling greatly relieved.

The situation was truly uncomfortable. Su Ping was the Rain Clan’s enemy, and yet he had to ask someone else to do the killing. He just couldn’t kill him on his own.

Furthermore, he even thought that surrounding and killing the Chaos Perception Dragon was easier than killing Su Ping.

How could this brat be so capable?

“Take over my spot,” said the Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God. He then activated his small universe and knocked a hole under someone else’s cover, escaping from the Chaos Perception Dragon’s universe.

The great dragon roared and wanted to give chase, only to be blocked by the other four gods.

“Rain Ancestor, don’t mess with us. I’ll immediately take my leave if I see that you’re slacking!” said an Ancestral God with a cold tone.

The latter was angry, but he would not dare to talk back at the moment. After all, the others had the same mindset. The temporary truce would truly fall out if he counterattacked.

He had paid a great price to ask for their help. He had to kill the Chaos Perception Dragon, or the Rain Clan would never be at peace.

“I’ll lead the charge!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Rain Ancestor didn’t say anything else, simply speaking with actions.

While their battle was resumed-outside of the Chaos Perception Dragon’s universe—the Chentian Clan’s Ancestral God arrived, glowing like the sun. His magnificent aura was spread out and he soon caught sight of Su Ping, who was hovering in the void.

“Rot in hell!”

Without further ado, he simply raised his head and attacked as if the human were an ant. The god thought that their difference in power was so vast that he didn’t see talking as necessary.

Once he sensed the Dao power sweeping over, Su Ping solemnly contracted the power within a radius of 50,000 kilometers and condensed it on his arm as a giant sword.

Bang!

The sword aura collided with the guy’s Dao power. The world instantly started shaking.

“Huh?” The Ancestral God, who was ready to return to the battlefield, was dazed, not expecting his attack to fail in erasing the boy. Such an ant had unleashed a dazzling power, one that no God Emperors were able to control.

Is he truly a God King?

“Is this the reason why the Rain Clan ancestor failed to kill you? He’s so dumb!” The Chentian expert could not help but despise the Rain Clan Ancestor. He had previously seen the man as a strong opponent, but reality appeared to be different.
