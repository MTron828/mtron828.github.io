Chapter 627: No. 2

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

A six hundred-eye boulder!

That boulder is heavier than the one the Golden Crow from the He family was carrying!!

How could that human... lift that boulder?

Diqiong stared blankly at Su Ping. Looking from a distance, the crow was only able to see that boulder; the human under the boulder was so tiny he could barely be seen.

Still, that tiny creature was lifting a boulder much larger in size, not to mention that the environment at the venue was especially harsh!

For the Golden Crows outside, lifting a boulder of that size might not be a great deal, but still, they would be impressed.

Whoosh!

At the venue, amid all the gazes, the tiny human who had lifted the boulder was flying across the cloud bridge; he reached the edge and then threw the boulder.

The boulder fell into the bottomless pit; the tiny human was panting heavily as he continued hovering.

He was like a speck of dust floating in the air.

But no Golden Crow would forget about that speck of dust.

“He has roughly mastered three types of Nature’s rules when his rank is so low...”

The three Golden Crow elders commented. Compared with the other Golden Crows, the three elders were calmer; they had already concluded which boulder Su Ping would lift according to his first attempt at borrowing his battle pets’ strength. The fact that Su Ping had managed to move the six hundred-eye boulder was within their expectations.

The only thing which perplexed those elders was Su Ping’s revivals.

They could not understand that, at all!

“In the List of Saviors of Earth and Heaven, this descendant of the Heaven Master can earn a place on the Earth List!” the Chief Elder said. No one could tell whether the Chief Elder was happy or not.

The elder on the right nodded in agreement. “You’re right. But just barely making the cut. Having a place among the first million is good enough for him.”

“It’s so sad that only one can make that list, of all the young Golden Crows of this generation...” The elder on the left heaved a sigh of disappointment. The young Golden Crows’ performances were subpar in its eyes.

“The He family kids are doing well. They can become our imperial guards,” the elder on the right said.

“It’s not even close to its big sister.”

...

While the three elders chatted, Su Ping was gazing at the boulder as it fell into the pit. He breathed in relief. He turned around and shouted into the air, “Have I passed this round?”

“Yes!”

The voice could be heard all around him. It was the Chief Elder.

Su Ping was glad. Good. I passed it.

He didn’t want much. He only aspired to get through the test and get the materials for the Solar Bulwark’s second level.

Whoosh!

Su Ping suddenly felt how a wisp of energy enveloped him. Following that, his view changed; he was outside the trial venue.

The Inferno Dragon and the other two battle pets were standing next to him; he felt them before he saw them.

“Thank you so much,” Su Ping said. The three battle pets were exhausted. Su Ping felt a surge of complicated feelings.

The Dark Dragon Hound barked as if to say “don’t mention it.”

The Inferno Dragon snorted casually as if it had forgotten about the pain of burning its soul countless times.

The Purple Python wiggled its tail to show that it was relaxed.

Su Ping took a deep breath and placed them back in the contract space so they could rest for a bit.

Su Ping turned around and looked into the larger venue. Many young Golden Crows in there were still moving the boulders to pass their trials.

“Come here.” It was Diqiong’s crisp voice.

Su Ping felt a swift move, and the next thing he saw was Diqiong standing right in front of him!

Diqiong said nothing to Su Ping. It was gazing at the other young Golden Crows.

Su Ping said nothing, either. He waited for the young Golden Crows to finish their trials.

Su Ping noticed that many of the participants were moving boulders that were much smaller than the one he had carried. Some of the boulders were just one hundredth of the boulder he picked!

“They’re choosing such small boulders. Can they pass the trial?” Su Ping was compelled to ask.

Diqiong lowered its head. “Of course. I’ll have you know, those boulders are not small. They can pass the test as long as the boulder is above ten eyes in size. Of course, that is the lowest standard.”

Su Ping was dumbstruck.

A ten-eye boulder was much, much smaller than the one he had chosen.

So, I wasted all that strength for nothing?

Su Ping was speechless. He decided to ask and make sure about the testing standards from then onwards.

...

Soon enough, the young Golden Crows finished their trials.

There were several Golden Crows able to carry four or five hundred-eye boulders and they caused a storm of cheering.

The results were posted at the end of the trial. Ranking No. 1 was the Golden Crow from the Jue family, which was considered to be one of the powerful branches of the Golden Crow race. The young Golden Crow, surprisingly, had outperformed the young Golden Crows from the He family and the Qiong family; it had successfully carried an eight hundred-eye boulder!

Ranking No. 2 was Su Ping!

A six hundred-eye boulder!

In third place was the young Golden Crow from the He family and the one from the Qiong family. Both carried five hundred-eye boulders!

The other Golden Crows carried four or three hundred-eye boulders, and smaller ones in some cases.

The young crows participating in the trial were stunned speechless. Ranking No. 2 was a foreign creature that they couldn’t even recognize!

Such an unknown creature was supposed to be awfully weak!

And he had carried a six hundred-eye boulder!

The young Golden Crows found it hard to believe, so they didn’t trust the results. Still, they were afraid to protest during such a grand occasion, where their parents and elders were present.

The first round ended. The second round came right after.

The second round would gauge the spirit and soul!

This time, the Chief Elder didn’t create an individual venue for Su Ping; the Chief Elder would act as personal examiner. As the second round kicked off, a dark black dragon tore through the void and appeared above the branches.

That dark dragon was larger than anyone could see and the scales were cast with iron. Each scale was as large as ten aircraft carriers. The dragon was hovering in the sky and that roar seemed to originate from ancient times. It was more shocking than any other dragon’s roar Su Ping had ever heard.

“A dragon?”

Su Ping stared at the dark dragon blankly.

Roar!! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The dark dragon roamed about in the sky and gradually curled up together. That pair of gigantic dragon eyes were fixed on all the young Golden Crows and Su Ping. The dragon’s mouth could eat up over a thousand young Golden Crows in a single bite!

When the dark dragon’s look reached him, Su Ping felt his brain receive a shock, and then his soul left his body.

He couldn’t even begin to describe that terror!

“Woo!”

“Squeak!”

Many Golden Crows began to cry in fear behind Su Ping, trying yet failing to brave the dark dragon’s stares. Some Golden Crows covered their heads with their wings, shaking in fright!

The young Golden Crows were terrified!

“That’s the Dark Star Dragon that is born in chaos and feeds on stars!” Diqiong explained with a grave mind.

The explanation was for Su Ping.

Su Ping looked at Diqiong.

“The second round is about to begin. I hope you won’t wet yourself.” Diqiong sounded indifferent.

Su Ping focused his mind. A creature born in chaos?So, an ancient creature that was just like the Golden Crows.

“Squeak... you bald bird, you’re making me scare your kids again. Aren’t you afraid one day I’ll get impatient and eat them up?”

The Dark Star Dragon grinned a cold grin at the young Golden Crows.

Since the beginning of chaos, the Dark Star Dragons and the Golden Crows had been fighting against each other.

The three Golden Crow elders glared at the Dark Star Dragon in silence.

But because of that threat, the young Golden Crows began to feel even more horrified.

The Dark Star Dragons and the Golden Crows were sworn enemies; the weak ones would become the food of another.

It was evident that the Dark Star Dragon was over a thousand times stronger than the young Golden Crows and the deep-rooted fear against Dark Star Dragons made some of the young Golden Crows want to drop out from the trial.
