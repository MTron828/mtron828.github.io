Chapter 1377: Executing the Heavens (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

While looking at the golden Titan, all the onlookers were compelled to clench their fists and pray in silence.

Praying was such a foreign concept for them. They were the masters of their own fate; the strong never prayed. However, they were praying to fate or gods they thought of on the spot to mimic what mortals did, hoping that Su Ping would win.

The people at the defense line and the residents on the protected planets were also watching this battle while holding their breath.

They knew that the fate of humankind depended on the outcome of that battle!

That magnificent giant had blocked all the worms, as well as the alien leader, all on its own. However… Could it really win?

The Wheel of Judgment in the alien’s hands had become even more ragged after several clashes; only half of it remained. The previously flawless power had an opening, causing it to gradually decline. However, everybody had to gather all their power to destroy the wheel. After so many exchanges, all the Celestials powering the Titan, including Su Ping, became exhausted.

Some of the Celestial pets already had blood on their eyes, mouth and nose. They looked awful.

Some were shivering. Their power seemed to have been siphoned away, and they were merely trying to sustain themselves.

Being at the array’s core, Su Ping could feel their individual statuses. Some Celestial pets seemed to have reached their maximum and their power was running out.

“Guys, can you still hold up?” Su Ping asked everyone telepathically.

“I can!” Chi Huo gnashed his teeth.

“No problem!”

“He’s getting exhausted too!”

......

Some Celestials stared at the alien. At first they were too weak to fight the creature. However, pooling their power had allowed them to fight the universe dominator. It was also the first time for them to experience the horror of such a powerhouse. Su Ping had been controlling the entire fight. They were in awe of him just as they were of the alien.

They probably would have failed if any of them would have assumed the central position.

At the moment they were only providing their power. The Titan had the power comparable to that of a universe dominator, but such power would be quickly consumed if it wasn’t used with the corresponding secret techniques and good control over the Great Dao. However, the skills performed by Su Ping while harnessing their power were beyond their understanding. They were definitely on the universe dominator’s level!

As a matter of fact, Su Ping was already able to fight as a universe dominator when he approached the Original Dao World and mastered the Great Dao.

His only limitation was his individual reserve, which fell short of what a universe dominator would have.

The divine array was bridging that shortcoming by providing enough power for him. That was why he could fight against the alien.

Right at that moment, flames suddenly began to burn in space.

Su Ping immediately narrowed his eyes. A voice echoed in his head. The moment he saw the flames, he had the final confirmation: the alien was one of the Heavens that even the Golden Crow ancestor was scared of!

The flames were exactly part of the Nine-Flavored Heavenly Fire!

They even covered the alien, including the incomplete Wheel of Judgment. The universe began to fall apart where the alien was standing; it seemed that the fire had burnt a hole in the universe.

“Heavens… It’s truly one of the Heavens, born from the age of chaos. They’re not extinct yet…” Su Ping was shocked and frightened.

He had been fighting the Heavens, the beings that even the Golden Crows were hiding from?

Su Ping regained his calmness soon after. Maybe that was the only surviving member of the Heavens, left from the age of chaos. That was nothing; all he needed to do was to kill that alien.

“What’s that fire? It’s so scorching!” one of the Celestials shouted. They felt that they were being burnt, even though they were inside the Titan Divine Array. It was beyond their understanding of fire.

“It’s not fire, but Heavenly Dao!” said Su Ping.

“Heavenly Dao?”

Everybody was stunned.

It seemed that those words couldn’t be spoken easily.

Su Ping didn’t explain. His eyes turned sharp, and he said to them, “A sword skill just came to mind; it may require a great amount of power. I hope that you can hang in there!”

“Feel free to use it! We’ll be fine!”

“Exactly!”

Everybody responded. Some of them already had bleeding faces, and they couldn’t even talk.

Once he saw that, Su Ping took a deep breath and gazed at the being from the Heavens race. Since ancient times, the Heavens had been superior, even loftier than gods!

Gods were indeed a noble race, but they stood second before the Heavens!

Su Ping couldn’t help but remember the arrogant faces of the gods he had met in the past as he watched that being. Why were those noble existences always so condescending?

Su Ping condensed his divine sword again and narrowed his eyes. An ancient sword aura surged inside his head; it was an ancient picture.

Su Ping didn’t understand it in the past, but now he understood why the technique had been named Heaven Execution!

If one of the Heavens wants to destroy you, why not just execute it?

Su Ping somehow resonated with the creator of that sword technique. He could always hear the delighted sigh from the sword aura through the river of time.

Some power would remain, even though it had faded away in time.

Some spirit would forever glow, no matter how long it had been.

Su Ping smiled. The next moment—like the ancient figure who had created the sword technique—he gave a deafening roar. All his hairs stood up. While burning his blood and unleashing an infinite killing intent, he charged with a crazy and unstoppable momentum.

The sword slashed upwards, seemingly cutting into the sky with the power of the earth!

The Titan let out a furious roar at the moment. The sword aura was so intense that it touched every Celestial expert in the divine array. Although they couldn’t feel it as vividly as Su Ping did, that sad and inexplicable feeling made them all roar. Their spirits resonated as one.

The roars of the thirty-six figures were somehow synced, turning into a single roar as the divine sword slashed with infinite brilliance!

“The rebellious skill!”

The alien narrowed his eyes. The anger and fear etched deep in his memories made him pause his attack briefly. But then, he was overwhelmed with embarrassment!

That rebellious skill, which should have disappeared, had been used yet again!

His trip was definitely worth it.?There were indeed some rebels hiding here. They should all be killed!

The Wheel of Judgment glowed with the scorching Heavenly Fire and the shadows of the Great Dao. Shaped like a dazzling crescent moon, it slashed forward.

—With a loud bang!

The universe seemed to be falling apart!

Two terrifying powers emerged in space. When they clashed, they sliced the universe as if it were a painting scroll. The immense tearing force crushed the roar. The worms behind the alien were cleared by tens of thousands of square kilometers as they endured the blast!

The number of dead worms was inestimable. There were even Celestial worm kings among them.

Even the wake of such a terrifying strike was unbearable for the Celestial experts!

Similarly, the area behind Su Ping had also been shattered. Song Yuan and the others, who had already retreated, moved towards the third defense line when they realized that things were taking a downturn. The energy array protecting the third defense line was broken; there were lots of casualties.

Boom!

The Titan stepped out and charged at the Heavens again.

Both parties had been wounded heavily in the previous clash. The alien’s Wheel of Judgment was completely shattered; a lot of Heavenly Fire on his body had died out, and there was a gruesome wound on his chest.

Many Celestials had passed out inside the Titan. The divine array was on the verge of collapse; Su Ping’s face was covered in blood, his look hideous.

He was going to kill that alien before the divine array collapsed!

“Give me strength!!” Su Ping roared.

The remaining Celestials in the array were all in a battle frenzy, craziness in their eyes. They knew that Su Ping’s decision was right; that was the most crucial moment.

Roar!

The Inferno Dragon stepped up and roared, burning its life essence and turning it into abundant power.

Then, the Dark Dragon Hound also roared, burning its essence and blood.

At the same time—Shen Huang, Chi Huo, Xu Kong and the other Celestials also set themselves ablaze, squeezing out their last bit of power.
