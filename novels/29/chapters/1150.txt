Chapter 1152 Training Finished

Su Ping had a strange feeling when the yin yang star was built, like a heavy weight hanging inside his abdomen.

An invisible line connected the weight to his forehead; all the power in his body was strung to it. It seemed that he wouldn’t fall no matter how much he shook.

The weight was like a damper on a high tower, only a hundred times more effective.

My power and my body are both balanced to the extreme!

Su Ping examined himself carefully, and enjoyed his current status. It seemed that he wouldn’t fall even if he stood on the edge of a cliff.

The feeling was not just about his body, it was also related to his cultivation. He discovered that he could easily break any obstacle with an unusual power of balance!

Is this the constitution that Old Monster Ye wanted? Also, I’ve detected the power of chaos…

Su Ping extended his hand, feeling that he could fetch something from the void; there was a chance he could do that if he was strong enough.

He wasn’t fetching an illusion from the void, but the power of illusion itself!

My constitution has changed a little bit. The Solar Bulwark seems to have been enhanced again…

Su Ping examined his body. The foundation he had built didn’t improve his level, as his body had reached the limits of the Star Lord State; he could cut laws apart with nothing but his body, and he could see laws in the void with his naked eye. There were even bright gold colors in Su Ping’s eyes at the moment!

The gold colors were not just pure divine power, but the transcendent divine power that had been purified by Heavenly Tribulations.

My body will probably be as sturdy as an Ascendant’s by the time I fully digest this!

Su Ping’s eyes glittered.

The essence and blood of the two ultimate beasts had brought him exceptional improvements. Even though he hadn’t been restored to the Star State yet, he still felt he was much stronger than before.

Phew!

Su Ping took a deep breath, then slowly exhaled; he feared that the training room would be razed to the ground if he exhaled too fast.

He didn’t stay much longer; he looked at the already barren training room, then simply rose and left.

Hardly had he exited the place when he saw the senior who had paid the spirit stones for him. The latter also noticed him, and felt that he was somehow different. Having no time to think, he asked, “Junior Brother Su, you’ve finished your training already?”

“How long have I been there?”

“Only two days.”

“Thank you very much for your spirit stones. I’ll be returning them to you later.” Su Ping nodded and quickly left after offering a cupped hands salute.

All the disciples currently training in other rooms opened their eyes in confusion after he left, as they felt that the spiritual energy around them had become abundant all of a sudden.

The spiritual energy had been as thin as that of the outside world for a while; someone had already reported the situation to their master.

“The cave’s spiritual arrays must’ve been in disorder and Master probably just fixed it. What a shame; the spirit stones I paid for the last two days were a waste!” A lot of people were regretful, wondering if their master would compensate them.

Su Ping didn’t return to his residence afterwards, heading instead to the rear mountain.

There was a vast jungle there; it was the cultivation place for the poor disciples.

There were some inferior beasts in the jungle, no stronger than level six. The enrolled disciples would be absolutely safe after building their foundation.

Most disciples with a set foundation would have the mountain as a place for traveling.

Su Ping entered deep into the jungle and found a cave.

There was a tiger and a few cubs in the cave. The tiger was alarmed the moment Su Ping entered the cave and jumped at him in a frenzy.

Su Ping realized that the tiger thought he was a predator and wanted to protect its children. He laid his hand on the tiger and suppressed it. Then, he discovered that the tiger was as strong as a level-7 battle pet warrior.

Su Ping petted the tiger and said gently, “Just relax. I’m only here to spend the night. I’ll give your kids a gift if you help me guard the door.”

His words seemed to contain a mysterious power that soothed the bad-tempered tiger. It widened its big eyes and looked at Su Ping with fear and confusion, as it didn’t sense the often found brutality of a hunter in Su Ping, but only a warm and cozy aura.

Su Ping touched its head and smiled. He then took out some herbs and pills to set up a spiritual array inside the cave.

Although he didn’t have spirit stones, he could use the spiritual energy inside the herbs as a substitute; it would be even more effective, since the herbs were of a higher level.

The tiger watched him in awe during the array setting process. It was crouched by the cave entrance, wanting to leave but fearing that Su Ping would notice.

Su Ping finished preparations soon after and then waved at the tiger.

The tiger hesitated for a moment, but eventually crawled to him slowly.

The three fat young tigers followed their mother and staggered towards Su Ping. One of them bared its fangs at Su Ping, as if it was trying to protect its mother.

Su Ping smiled and held the three young tigers in his arms. He then said to their mother, “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you. Guard the door and don’t let anyone come close. Don’t hurt them either; just scare them off.”

The tiger looked at its cubs held by Su Ping and hesitated, but then turned around and moved to the entrance of the cave.

It was able to understand him, and was scared of his formidable presence. Oddly enough, there was still a sort of intimate feeling.

However, its beastly nature called for caution and unwillingness to trust a human being.

“Kids, behave.” He looked at the fang-baring little tiger in his arms, then rubbed the fat on its nape and transmitted spiritual energy mixed with Golden Crow aura into its body. The youngling was unable to endure such powerful bestowal, thus soon passed out as if drunk.

Su Ping sat cross-legged and placed the cubs on his lap; then, he started a secluded training session.

Once the foundation was built, he had to form his cores as a next step.

The cores to be formed included three types: the illusory core, the real core, and the golden core.

After the golden core was formed, he would be as strong as ninth-ranked battle pet warriors and be able to fly in the sky like a bird.

The mountain was as peaceful as ever while Su Ping cultivated in the jungle.

The new disciples were all training diligently. The older disciples would meet with others for tea or drink during breaks; sometimes they would also leave the mountain for parties or cultivation seminars.

Cultivation was too boring; it wasn’t easy for new disciples to endure a couple of years. It wasn’t unusual for them to become sloppy after a long time of hard work. Some of them were only sloppy on occasion, but others simply couldn’t focus on cultivation again.

Many weren’t eliminated due to lack of potential.

“It’s been half a year. Have any of the new disciples shown promise?”

Mu Xuefeng, asked about her disciples just after finishing her training; as their master, she would certainly show concern for them. In particular, she had admitted six disciples with deity constitutions; they would surely become core disciples.

Her first disciple Zhuang Bizhe reported respectfully, “Reporting to Master, two of the six exceptional disciples you recruited are remarkable. They’ve built their foundation in only half a year! The disciple named Tang Jingyu has excellent potential; he’s from a renowned cultivation family. He’s now trying to form a core!”

Slightly surprised, Mu Xuefeng nodded and asked, “Not bad. How many foundation layers did he set? Did you warn them about the downsides of hastiness? They must be very cautious at this stage.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Seven,” replied Zhuang Bizhe respectfully, “I talked to him. He had already built seven layers. It didn’t seem likely that he would build another, so I allowed him to try and form a core. As for the other person, his name is Yan Yuanxiang; he’s built six foundation layers, and he wants to establish more.”

Mu Xuefeng put on a smile. “I didn’t expect that I would pick up such a pair of rare talents. It’s remarkable to find they’ve built foundations in only half a year. Summon them; as their master I will help them go higher!”

Zhuang Bizhe enviously nodded. “Yes, ma’am.”

“What about the other four disciples?” Mu Xuefeng asked again.

Zhuang Bizhe said, “I know that three of them have only just built one or two layers. As for the last disciple, named Su Ping, he’s been missing for half a year. It’s said that he’s been in secluded training on the rear mountain. I’m not aware of his progress.

“However, I heard that he successfully cleansed his marrow a long time ago, even faster than Tang Jingyu did. It only took him one day; I don’t know whether or not it’s true…”

“He cleansed his marrow in one day?”

Mu Xuefeng was dazed for a moment, then shook her head with a smile. “Impossible. The marrow cleansing method of our Heaven Asking Church is abstruse, more thorough and complete compared to methods from other sects.

“If he were in another sect, it might have been possible for him to cleanse his marrow in a day or two, but it takes three days at least in our sect. That’s the record of the Heaven Asking Church which hasn’t been surpassed in years.”
