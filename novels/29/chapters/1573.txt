Chapter 1575: Prayer of the People (4)
Just then, Su Ping shattered the system's imagination and worked up a miracle!         

    

"I used to create things you saw as miracles. Now, you're creating a miracle for me…" There was a rush of different emotions in the system's eyes, including delight and relief.     

At this moment, the Ultimate Heavenly Dao roared, "Judgment!" It was the first time he lost his cool since the beginning of the battle.     

The lightning-infested Spear of Judgment darted towards Su Ping with unstoppable momentum as if able to pierce through the very ends of chaos.     

Su Ping already felt he had been run through, even before the attack arrived. It was like falling into an abyss, or pinned down on a coffin. He couldn't move.     

Su Ping woke up after a momentary trance. He roared and summoned all his strength, slashing out with brutal force.     

The lives of countless people were extinguished, many humans amongst them.     

There were also disciples of the Heaven Path Institute mixed in. Their lives were burnt like matches, soon turning to ash and disappearing.     

One slash, and half of those lives perished!     

The ragged, summoned universes lost some of their luster.     

The two streams with the greatest power in the universe crossed paths.     

There were two sounds of collision, almost echoing at the same time!     

The system lost her clear-headed nature and shrieked, "What are you doing?!" That was the first time she had ever lost her composure.     

The terrifying spear went through Su Ping's body. On the other hand, the latter's sword didn't clash with the Spear of Judgment, but went straight to slash the part where the Ultimate Heavenly Dao and the Chaos Core had fused.     

"Ahhhhhhhh!!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao let out a furious roar, just like a wounded beast. He was separated from the Chaos Core, and no longer had the distinctive holiness aura.     

Su Ping's body was greatly affected by the spear. An enormous crack was spread from his wound, which kept eating away his body. He couldn't stop this from happening; he was like a piece of porcelain that would soon break into billions of pieces.     

Even so, Su Ping was smiling.     

He chuckled and said, "I'll never die along with an idiot such as yourself. I simply want you to go home!" He could barely speak, but the brilliance in his eyes couldn't be hidden.     

"You must die!!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao let out a furious roar. "You think you can sever the connection between me and the Chaos Core? It has already chosen me. Die!"     

Right after bellowing threats, his body moved to the Chaos Core like glue and covered the damage caused by Su Ping.     

"He's right. It has already chosen him. It's useless." There was sadness in the system's eyes as she sighed. She knew what Su Ping was thinking; being the most esteemed life in all of chaos, she actually longed for strength, just like mortals did.     

She had been born with strength. She never asked for it.     

"Even if the core has picked you, I will make it change its mind!"     

Su Ping stared at the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.         

    

"You…" The latter was furious. He wanted to say something, but the next moment, his expression froze. He then understood what Su Ping had just done and regained his rationality. With a ruthless tone, he said, "You had an opportunity to heavily wound me, but now it's gone."     

"What did you do?"     

The system sensed that Su Ping's consciousness had left his own body. While dazed, she couldn't help but feel scared. The feeling was extremely foreign to her, as she had never been scared, even when she lost the previous battles and saw the Ultimate Heavenly Dao fuse with the Chaos Core.     

She had always been invincible, given her status as the most ancient and strongest entity. Not once had she known what fear was.     

However, she was experiencing fear right then.     

She cried out loudly, but Su Ping's consciousness didn't respond. Suddenly realizing, she looked at the crack made to the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

"He is terribly ill. It's time to end this," said the Ultimate Heavenly Dao with a cold smile, "I will show him what I see and feel. I will let him know how horrible the world you've built is!"     

The system was too stunned for words, having figured out what Su Ping was trying to do.     CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In the meantime—     

Inside the Chaos Core space.     

The place was in a mud-like state, neither dark nor light. It was the origin of chaos, the source of all laws and the Great Daos; the place where all power and forms took shape.     

"Voluntarily coming to this place… You're trying to get yourself killed, huh?" said a contemptuous voice.     

A glowing figure emerged from the muddy substance. It was none other than the Ultimate Heavenly Dao.     

Next to him was a small child. It was the form projected into Su Ping's consciousness, conceived according to his understanding.     

The latter understood that the child was the Chaos Core.     

It was evident that the child resembled the system in a way.     

Su Ping released his contract power and unconditionally transmitted his willpower and emotions into the Chaos Core manifestation.     

His move to sever the link between the Heavenly Dao and the core was not done to separate them, but to project his own willpower.     

Su Ping gazed at the Chaos Core and said, "I know that all living creatures that have existed throughout the ages are merely dust particles falling off of you. But she didn't do anything wrong; you shouldn't have betrayed her.     

"I'm here to persuade you into changing your mind. All I want to say is in my thoughts. I believe you already understand."     

"Stupid!"     

The Ultimate Heavenly Dao sneered. "I know why you're here. But, do you know why it picked me?"
