The fire burning the massive body became less and less as Su Ping continued absorbing. Su Ping sensed the surging and exuberant power of fire inside him, like a sun about to explode. The scorching power was transmitted into his universe and absorbed, making him even stronger than before.

Inside the store—everybody was shocked after seeing what was happening with their extended senses.

“Shen Huang, is your disciple cultivating?” asked a Celestial in disbelief, feeling that he was acting crazy.

Shen Huang lost his cool too, not expecting Su Ping to absorb such terrifying flames. Heavenly Fire was unlike the law of fire; it was a flame that absorbed countless laws. Although manifested as fire, it could also turn into ice with exactly the same function.

“No wonder he’s unwilling to leave; this fire counts as great nourishment for him. I feel that his aura is becoming even more terrifying,” said a bitter Celestial after staring for a while, “What a crazy way to cultivate. No wonder such a lunatic was created.”

“Shen Huang, why don’t you talk some sense into your disciple? Let’s get out of here. I’ve been having this ominous feeling since we came to this universe,” said someone else.

Shen Huang glanced at the latter, knowing it was just an excuse. The guy simply didn’t want to encounter any Heavens there.

“Xiao Su knows what he’s doing; he can’t be just cultivating,” said Shen Huang solemnly. “Nothing changed when Xiao Su reversed time just now; it means that the battle with the Heavens’ race has long ended. Although a thousand years is not a long time, the Heavens are probably not here anymore.”

“Even if they’re still here, there can’t be too many of them; we can stay here and investigate.”

“This place is already in ruins. What’s there to investigate? There are no laws nor paths; they must have been destroyed. Only cultivators would survive under such circumstances,” said Chi Ying.

Shen Huang slightly shook his head and said, “The body hasn’t changed at all after being burned by the Heaven Master for a thousand years; he surely was a universe dominator, or something even more terrifying when he was alive. The Heavens who killed him were more horrifying than what we’ve met before. In other words, they would have noticed us the moment we arrived if they were still here.

“However, we haven’t encountered any of them, which means that those existences aren’t here. We should take a look around, now that we’ve come here.”

Everyone exchanged bewildered looks. A Celestial felt compelled to ask, “What do you mean by higher levels? Are there people stronger than universe dominators? Are they Creators?”

......

“Creators… That’s probably a fitting word,” Shen Huang shook his head and said, “However, since Xiao Su said that there are, there certainly are. After all, he’s seen worlds that we have yet to see.”

Nobody would argue with him. That was indeed true.

“I thought we were already about to reach the peak of cultivation, once we reach the universe dominator’s level. I didn’t know it was just the second to last stop. No wonder seven members of the Heavens invaded our universe; there has to be a stronger leader in every group that has more than three members…” said a Celestial cultivator bitterly.

Shen Huang shook his head and sighed. “Xiao Su mentioned that there are another two levels above the universe dominators. So, even if somebody is a Creator, there are even more terrifying beings. That’s the source of cultivation; those levels are beyond our imagination. Maybe they carry all kinds of abilities; they’re omniscient and omnipotent!”

Everybody was stunned. They felt that their world had been blasted heavily.

If that was the case, the Celestial State they prided themselves of having was nothing worth mentioning.

They were still far away from the end of cultivation!

Everybody finally understood why Su Ping was so indifferent and arrogant towards them, back in the conference room on the Astral Nexus. At first they thought it was just because he was strong enough to suppress them. However, they realized it was because he had seen higher skies.

Once seeing the view from the peak, one wouldn’t be interested in the sights by the mountainside.

“We can construct small universes. I thought that we’d be able to create a grand universe when we reached the end of cultivation, just like the one we used to live in. However, it seems that there are more terrifying powers,” said one of the Celestials with a sigh.

“We’re no different from Creators in the eyes of regular people. Those who live in our universes are ignorant of what’s beyond, just like us when living in the grand universe. I wonder how we can make our small universe evolve into a real grand universe. Do we have to become stronger than universe dominators?” another Celestial mumbled.

While they discussed—Su Ping, who had been absorbing the fire scorching the ancient body, suddenly opened his eyes.

An extremely feeble thought had just entered his mind.

“Who… are you?”

It wasn’t Su Ping’s own questioning, but the confusion and suspicion relayed from an external thought.

The thought was so feeble that Su Ping suspected that it was just his imagination. However, after the thought was sent a few times more, he confirmed that it was real. The Original Dao World appeared in his eyes, and he saw that the feeble thought floated out of the body and made a connection to him like a thread.

He’s not dead?

Su Ping was shocked. That corpse was terrifying; it had been burnt by Heavenly Fire and only bones were left. Somehow, some thoughts had also lingered.

“Were you killed by the Heavens?” asked Su Ping immediately. “When? Have they left?”

The feeble thought paused. A moment later, it continued, “You’re not a member of the Heavens, but you carry their aura and can absorb Heavenly Fire. Have you turned part of your body into that of the Heavens, or have you grasped their power? Or maybe, you’re a member of the Heavens in disguise?”

The voice paused for a moment, then added, “No, considering how arrogant they are, they would never disguise themselves as someone like you. The aura of chaos? Bloodline of mythical creatures? Interesting…”

Su Ping slightly changed his expression. The corpse could actually sense the bloodlines in his body?

“Senior, you haven’t answered my question,” said Su Ping in a low voice, not daring to be rude.

“You don’t seem to be from our universe,” said the voice all of a sudden.

Su Ping changed his expression. Instead of denying, he said, “That’s right. We came from another universe, which has also been destroyed by the Heavens. We escaped, hoping to find allies from other universes to fight against the Heavens!”

He said the truth, hoping to get closer to the corpse with their mutual experiences.

“It’s been so many years. Have the Heavens not stopped?” the voice mumbled and then chuckled. “Looking for allies… Hehe, if only you were here sooner… However, you’re too weak. Even if you did come earlier, you would have died along with us…”

Su Ping’s heart was heavy; indeed, they were too weak. He even wondered if the experts of the powerful cultivation sites would cooperate with them to go against such a dreadful enemy once they found where their worlds were located.

“However, despite your weakness, you have the courage that every living creature should be born with. Always be hopeful and never lower your head. Maybe I would have chosen to extinguish myself had you arrived 100,000 years later… Fortunately, my persistence was well worth it. I will give the rest of my power to you; I hope you’ll make the best use of it,” said the voice.

Su Ping was stunned. In other words, this corpse could endure another 100,000 years?

By choosing to extinguish himself, did he mean that he would kill himself?

Su Ping couldn’t help but ask, “Senior, were you an Ancestral God, or a Sorcerer Ancestor from the age of chaos?”

“Huh? You know of the Sorcerer Ancestor?” The corpse was obviously surprised, not expecting that Su Ping, a weakling, would actually know of such an ultimate existence.

“Considering the power in your body, you must be a rare genius. Not even the prodigies in my clan could have compared to you,” said the corpse, “Do you know any Sorcerer Ancestors? Or did you receive their legacies?”
