Chapter 1401: Swallowing the Heavens (2)

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

Seeing that neither of them was moving, the elders gradually approached them.

“Dao Child, did you just pass the God King’s tribulation, or the God Emperor’s?” asked an elder. He felt that things weren’t in line with what he knew.

They had clearly sensed that it was a God King’s tribulation, but Su Ping had shown strength that no other God King had.

Su Ping noticed their curiosity. He remembered how they had stepped up to help him earlier, so he dropped his coldness and said, “It was the God King’s tribulation. I’m not a God Emperor yet. Thank you for your help just now.”

Everyone exchanged looks, lost for words.

He’s only a God King, and he already possesses such power?

Although it had already been a great eye-opener that Su Ping became Dao Child while still being a Major God, they didn’t expect him to work another miracle. It was beyond their understanding. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Dao Child, you’ve shown more power than we can muster…” An elder heaved a long sigh. Su Ping’s vitality aura was only a few hundred years old. It was like the time needed for a sneeze in their eyes. It was already miraculous for anyone to become a God King in such a short amount of time; only the high-ranked clans with numerous resources could possibly raise one in that period.

However, Su Ping’s combat ability was even more unbelievable. Even the normal God Emperors were probably not a match for him.

All the Dao Children of the Heaven Path Institute had potential to become God Emperors. Some of them were expected to become Ancestral Gods; however, all of them eventually perished. Su Ping was definitely the most unusual one.

Even some of the Ancestral Gods couldn’t compare to him when they were God Kings!

“Dao Child, you postponed your God King breakthrough. Chan Gong mentioned that you were condensing your Dao Heart. So, have you already found it?” asked an elder.

Su Ping nodded slightly. Although he had grasped a Dao Heart of his own, there were still a lot of questions he wanted to ask those seniors.

Seeing Su Ping admit to it, everybody looked at him with more solemnity and respect. He was no longer a Dao Child, but a God Emperor peer.

Even though he had yet to go through the God Emperor’s tribulation, he could invoke it at any time with his Dao Heart.

One of the elders suddenly sighed and said, “Maybe the Dao Child will be the fourth Ancestral God of our institute. I don’t know how long it would take; perhaps 10,000 years should be enough…”

All those present showed slightly different expressions; it was exactly what they were thinking. Indeed. If someone as talented as Su Ping couldn’t become an Ancestral God, who could?

Su Ping did have a shot at achieving a breakthrough in 10,000 years.

They felt troubled as they realized that the young man before their eyes could become an Ancestral God in 10,000 years.

Su Ping noticed their gazes and frowned a bit, wishing they could focus more on the Heavens instead of him.?Shouldn’t they be shocked and panicked by the arrival of a member of the Heavens?

“Guys, the arrival of this man from the Heavens’ race means that they’ve found our world. It won’t be long before their army breaks in. It will be a catastrophe!” said Su Ping solemnly.

Everybody changed their expressions. They too were concerned about the invader; however, Su Ping’s performance had been too shocking and left them wondering.

“If the Heavens do come, we’ll just fight them,” declared an elder with the pride that was unique to gods.

Su Ping frowned as he listened. Although they were quite nice to him, he could feel their arrogance, etched deep in their bones.

“Elders, that was just the weakest of the Heavens. There are powerful Original Heavens amongst them. Even the Ancestral Gods may have trouble if they face them!”

Su Ping spoke solemnly, hoping they would take matters seriously. Those elders were being too careless, even though they had personally witnessed how formidable the Heavens were. Su Ping didn’t even dare to imagine how other gods would respond when the news was spread. Despise, or maybe discarded with a snort?

“The Heavens are indeed powerful. There must be a lot of Ancestral Gods among them,” said an elder solemnly, “That member of the Heavens attacked the Dao Child for no reason. What did you do to cross him?”

“He arrived in the middle of my tribulation; just like that. We had never met before,” said Su Ping. He also wanted to find out why a member of the Heavens was determined to kill him.

“He attacked you for no reason? But there has to be one. Was he jealous of the Dao Child’s potential?” speculated an elder.

“Whatever the reason, it is nonetheless unscrupulous to launch a sneak attack during a tribulation!” said an elder coldly, “That member of the Heavens was clearly a God Emperor, and yet he ambushed the Dao Child, a junior. This is proof enough that the Heavens aren’t anything good.”

“That is correct.”

“We need to report this matter to the Ancestral Gods and take necessary actions. Whatever the reason is, the Dao Child has killed a member of the Heavens. They’ll surely come for revenge.”

They didn’t blame him for slaying the mythical invader. It was pointless to even ask the reason since the guy was already dead; they only had to consider what to do next.

“Elders, you must inform the Ancestral Gods. This will definitely be a catastrophe for the world of gods. We must not let this slide,” said Su Ping solemnly.

“Don’t worry, Dao Child. We will bring up this matter with the Ancestral Gods,” said an elder.

“Although there’s no corpse leftover as proof, I’ve already etched the battle into my memories. I will replay the event to the Ancestral Gods,” said an elder.

The battlefield was so greatly shattered it was impossible to watch the replay by reversing time and space. They could only replay their own memories as proof of the Heavens’ existence.

Su Ping felt greatly relieved once he saw they were taking it seriously. He could not help but thank the alien’s intrusion. If not for that guy, he would have had a harder time convincing the elders or taking the matter to the Ancestral Gods.

I hope that they’ll attach enough importance to the problem and form an alliance sooner…?Su Ping thought.

The elders then said their goodbyes and went back to their activities. Su Ping looked at the still-digesting Chaos Beast, and took it back to his mountain.

He went about examining his own changes while waiting for the young Chaos Beast to finish.

He was already in the unquestionable Celestial State, or the God King realm. His body had been significantly improved in every aspect; the greatest improvement was related to his universe of chaos.

His universe was much better than normal universes to begin with. Altogether, eight universes had been combined, becoming the ninth universe of chaos. It contained unimaginable laws and the Great Dao. Still, the power had previously been lurking within the universe or wandering aimlessly, without being effectively utilized. It was just how humans could hear with their ears, but very few could make their ears fold.

However, once he grasped a Dao Heart, all the power in Su Ping’s universe was unified and became controllable, as if it were one of his arms.

His previous punches merely involved him waving an arm, but now he could focus all his strength, including that of his legs, heart and even blood flow, all on his fist. If all the strength was concentrated on a single point, it would be much more powerful than before.

Besides the cultivation of my universe’s power, my Dao Heart…

Every Dao Heart had its particular attributes. For instance, the Desolation Dao Heart could obliterate all power in the universe. Once he absorbed a target into his universe, he could erase it.

The Harmony Dao Heart could synchronize all powers, allowing you to unleash a power ten times greater than that of normal God Warriors.

Su Ping’s Dao Heart was given the name of “contract” when he grasped it, because he wanted to hold onto all the bonds around him.

The bonds were power that could be transmitted.

I can fully borrow the power of the young Chaos Beast, the Dark Dragon Hound and my other pets. I can also create bonds between me and the Great Dao around me to make use of it.?Su Ping realized as he explored the nature of his Dao Heart.
