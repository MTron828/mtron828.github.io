Chapter 1300 Dark Power (1)

Qing Mu said no more, considering how confident Su Ping was acting. The latter’s combat ability did qualify him to act that way.

He calmly and steadily walked towards Su Ping; the divine power he was emitting increased with each step.

After a few dozen steps-he was already ablaze with dazzling divine power, like an ancient god. There was a magnificent shadow vaguely forming near the void behind him.

The shadow was neither human nor beast. Rather, it looked like a huge tree.

The towering tree had lots of branches and leaves, and carried an overwhelming aura of life.

That was the totem worshipped by the Immortality Clan. It was also the divine bloodline in their bodies, which belonged to the world tree from the age of chaos!

“That’s the core power of the Immortal Clan. Only descendants with the purest bloodlines have a chance to awaken it!”

“The world tree! It’s said that the world tree yields fruits of the universe, and is home to ancient mythical creatures. You can directly become a God King if you ever eat one of them!”

“Look, that’s the power of Dao Child Qing Mu!”

As everybody held their breath and watchedthree glittering round fruits appeared on the world tree. Each of those fruits emitted a succulent aura from the universe itself.

Three universes!

Such a sight left everyone in awe; they were rendered speechless, as if they were seeing something from eons past.

That was the core power that made the Immortality Clan one of the seven greatest!

Su Ping was rather astonished by the scene. Three universes? He could tell that all three universes were real; all of them contained abundant laws.

The difference between a universe and an Ascendant world was the completeness of laws.

The world was flawed and incomplete, while the universe was full and independent.

However, the power of Dao Glyphs in the universe is not so great. Although their combination has been boosted, the power of each individual universe is not quite impressive. Su Ping soon realized this shortcoming. If the weakest universe was as powerful as one complete Dao Glyph-the more Dao Glyphs a universe contained, the more powerful it would be.

Each of the ex-Dao Child’s three universes contained the power of two Dao Glyphs.

The three of them combined was equal to a universe with six Dao Glyphs.

However-because of the special world tree’s enhancing power, they could compare to nine Dao Glyphs!

“Come on,” said Dao Child Qing Mu.

He was attacking openly, even warning Su Ping in advance. His power was so domineering that-if Su Ping could resist it head-on-it would attest to his terrifying strength.

Su Ping had a solemn expression. He concealed his godly aura in his body, and combined his bloodlines into that of the Primitive Chaos Clan. The amount of chaos aura he was emitting at the moment was such that many people’s eyes were glowing. The chaos creatures had always been a great nourishment.

“The Chaos clan…”

The elders narrowed their eyes. They had long detected the aura of chaos creatures in Su Ping’s body, but they thought it had to do with the Golden Crow. Just then it was revealed that it was because of Su Ping’s own bloodline.

“The multiple small worlds of the Heaven Path Institute were inspired by the chaos world tree, back when our Ancestral God studied it. Unfortunately, it’s only possible to condense multiple small worlds; multi universes require the bloodline of the Immortality Clan,” remarked an elder.

The big-headed child said, “That’s not what I heard. It’s not that the Ancestral God was unable to improve the cultivation technique to the God King’s level; he simply thought it was unnecessary. It’s not difficult to find a replacement for the chaos world tree to accommodate multiple universes, but that’s not the right approach; it would only waste your energy.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That is correct.”

The young-looking overlord said, “There used to be a Sun Wood Cultivation Technique in the institute which enabled the establishment of multiple universes. You can cultivate a Sun Divine Tree with the Sun Wood Cultivation Technique as a replacement for the chaos world tree. It’s not as effective, but it works. However, the universes tend to merge in the end. That is why Qing Mu was squeezed out from the Dao Child roster.”

“While the Immortality Clan has great talent, they spend too many resources and effort cultivating that others can eventually catch up. However, the Ancestral God of the Immortality Clan is in the top five rankers of our world; I wonder what direction the Ancestral God has…” said Yan Huang, the aloof girl.

The old-looking senior turned to look at her. “Is Senior Sister Yan Huang studying the way of the Ancestral Gods already?”.

Everybody was surprised; they couldn’t help but look at the girl.

Yan Huang said indifferently, “We’re ultimate emperors already. Isn’t it natural for us to pursue the eternal level?”

“Awesome, senior sister…” the big-headed child was compelled to remark. The others were lost for words too; none of them expected her to be already studying the secrets of the Ancestral God realm. Such a fact implied that she was way above them.

While they discussed—the pressure on the battlefield was accumulated to the maximum.

The chaos world tree was occupying half of the battlefield, and the three universes hanging on the tree were emitting a dazzling light.

Su Ping remained still under the tree shade while gazing at his opponent. “Fall of Chaos!”

Qing Mu raised a hand. The power around him was suddenly absorbed by the three universes. Then, all three shot enormous projections.

Those projections darted towards Su Ping with destructive power.

Su Ping condensed a sword of chaos in his hand and slashed to counter, eliminating all the projections with his sword auras.
