Chapter 1066: Fight Without Fear

Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations

“I am a mid-ranked god, but so what?”

Joanna wasn’t infuriated because of Eborr’s mockery. Instead, her face glowed with pride and confidence. “Someone proved to me that even the high-ranked gods are nothing worth mentioning. Even the high-ranked gods can be obliterated if you’re strong enough!

“It’s true that I was born to a mid-ranked god family, but I won’t complain!

“If my family cannot give me the most powerful bloodline, I’m going to create it with my own hands!”

Joanna raised her head; her voice echoed in the Supreme Temple. She looked around dauntingly. There wasn’t the slightest hint of fear on her face, even though she was facing three Superior Gods.

The goddess of war who had once fought everywhere in the Demigod Burial had fully revealed her aura; she didn’t cower before those powerhouses!

“This is outrageous!”

The three gods were infuriated by Joanna’s bravado; anger surfaced on their faces.

The pride and dignity of high-ranked gods was at stake; it couldn’t be stained by a mere mid-ranked god!

“Anna, you’ve changed!”

Avril’s eyes were cold. “You would have never said such an outrageous thing. This human has changed you. I will try rescuing you for old time’s sake. Your mind must have been affected by him without you realizing it!

“Maybe his protector did something to you in secret!” said Eborr with a gloomy expression. It became increasingly clear to him how cunning that human was.

They had coexisted with Joanna for such a long time that they knew her very well. She wouldn’t have said such unruly remarks. High-ranked gods were supreme in the eyes of every god. How could she have been that disrespectful?

“Say no more!”

Joanna stabbed her golden spear into the ground, making the temple shake. The frozen time and space was also rippling. She then declared, “I know whether or not I’m being controlled. I didn’t change; I was simply awakened! Gods were the strongest species in the primordial times, but why were we defeated? It wasn’t because we weren’t strong enough, but because we were too arrogant!”

“Shut up!”

Shivalello interjected from his central position. He spoke with disappointment and coldness, “The patience granted to you is limited. You should be imprisoned for 100,000 years for what you said today! Now, go to the prison with this human. We’ll see if the bigshot is bold enough to show up!”

Their attitude towards Su Ping was just a test.

They had figured out a lot of information from his attitude.

First of all, if Su Ping was asking them to become his employees, it was doubtless because the alleged bigshot backing Su Ping wouldn’t be able to deal with them easily!

Otherwise, he could have simply suppressed them with violence.

Secondly, they couldn’t find an explanation for Su Ping’s options. Why was the bigshot unwilling to take them to the Archean Divinity directly, instead asking them to work as employees? They didn’t want to be tricked like fools; never would they enter the protector’s territory easily.

The previously frozen Su Ping blinked and said softly, “As expected of Superior Gods. Is 100,000 years just a number to them?”

Joanna’s spear had disrupted the spacetime blockade; he had been prepared since the last imprisonment, successfully freeing himself with the waves.

Once he said that, Su Ping turned around and looked at Joanna, taking out an employee contract.

“Once again, you’re welcome to join my store.”

“Great!”

Without hesitation, Joanna laid her fingertip on the contract and laid a drop of blood, which left a golden fingerprint on the contract; the rest of the blood was spread throughout the document.

The contract instantly glowed after being signed, then emitted an indescribable, overpowering aura; but then, the contract quickly vanished. Meanwhile, Su Ping received the system notification that Joanna’s original self was added to the list of his employees.

All of her information was displayed on the employee panel.

Su Ping didn’t have time to read it, but it wasn’t like he needed to. Joanna’s original self received the employee privilege; she would be resurrected in the Demigod Burial no matter how many times she died.

“Do you feel like practicing with Superior Gods?” Su Ping asked Joanna with a smile of relief after the contract was signed. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A burning fighting spirit inflamed Joanna’s eyes. “I’ve always wanted that!”

“Fight without fear then!”

Su Ping smiled and said with an imposing tone, “I’d like to find the gap between a top Ascendant State expert and one in the Celestial State!”

“Anna, that was truly stupid!”

The godly trio’s expressions had a sudden change; the contract’s magnificent aura had shocked them. They also realized that Joanna had been completely leashed by Su Ping.

She was a mighty war goddess who was close to becoming a Superior God, yet she bound herself to a mere human being.?How stupid!

They were exasperated and completely disappointed in her. Eborr unleashed the exuberant power of the sun; he was so dazzling that his extravagant robe seemed to be burning. He looked down at the two people in the palace and said, “You’ve forgotten who you are because you’ve been rewarded beyond your station. Today, I will show you what supreme power really is!”

He raised his head. The temple seemed to have been infinitely expanded in an instant.

Space in the temple had been lifted; it seemed to have become an independent universe!

Eborr’s raised hand slowly descended like a scorching sun, eclipsing the entire dome of the temple and suppressing everything!

“Die!!”

A shocking fighting will emanated from Joanna’s eyes. She dashed forth with her spear, utterly unstoppable. Her divine power surged underneath her and pushed her body forward as if it were an ancient chariot!

Boom!

Dazzling light burst out of the spear, revealing a splendid small world. At the same time—a luminous slit appeared on Joanna’s forehead. It was her divine seal!

Time and space were completely disrupted the moment she struck the scorching hand. A lot of sharp laws were revealed, turning the place into a forbidden land.

The nearby Su Ping was about to be caught in the battle waves, when some kind of power shrouded him and melted the chaotic laws about to touch him.

The power didn’t belong to Joanna; it came from Heather.

Joanna knew that Su Ping wouldn’t die there, so she didn’t have to split her attention to protect him. She was fully devoted to the battle.

Once he sensed the power protecting him, Su Ping turned around and looked at Heather; he was surprised to see her smiling at him.

The three Superior Gods had declared war on him, but Heather didn’t seem concerned at all. What was on her mind?

Su Ping was slightly confused, but he didn’t ask.

The battle had already broken out at the moment. Joanna’s attack was as powerful as lightning. Her toughness and craziness shocked the three Superior Gods.

Eborr’s hand was injured. He withdrew it, and golden blood was flowing out of a wound.

A high-ranked god like him had been hurt by Joanna!

Is she really not afraid of dying?

Eborr was rather angry; his eyes emitted coldness. Both Shivalello and Avril had detected his killing intent before he attacked again. Shivalello said solemnly, “Attack together and suppress her!”

Joanna had reached the limits of the Ascendant State; she only needed an opportunity, one she had been seeking with her reincarnation to advance into the Celestial State. A bloody battle would be inevitable if Eborr were to fight her alone; they only wanted to imprison Joanna and Su Ping, and later check the bigshot’s reaction after incarcerating Su Ping.

They were still wary when they thought of that powerful character.

Avril also took action; a brilliant blue divine power circulated on her body, as if covered in blue flames. She pointed her finger, instantly manifesting the illusion of a crescent moon, which was the contour of her divine world.

An expert’s small world was bound to evolve and become a divine world when reaching the Celestial State.

Its power would also change; there would be additional mysterious abilities.

She resonated with the laws of the entire world the moment her divine world appeared; all the laws in nature were under her control at the moment.

“Restrict!”

Avril spoke in a low voice.
