618 Little Troublemaker

Hearing Ye Xuan say that, Ao Lei’s expression changed drastically.

“Could it be that the records of the Great Wilderness Divine sect in the ancient book aren’t lies?”

“It recorded that, in the distant past, the mystic world was divided. The sect master of the Great Wilderness sect was concerned about the survival of the legacy of the sect, so he split the sect’s inheritance.”

“The Great Desolation divine power also became incomplete because of this.”

!!

“After the Great Wilderness Divine sect was split, there was no news of the other party. It was only recorded in the ancient book, but few people know about this.”

Everyone was shocked to hear this.

“If that’s the case, then are there still people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect on another continent?”

Gao Shun’s voice was trembling with excitement.

Ye Xuan answered with certainty, “Yes, they are now in the Heaven continent. If we compare our two sects, their strength is higher than ours.”

Hearing that, Gao Shun and the rest became even happier.

“Senior Brother Ao, if the sects are made whole again, will we be able to complete the Great Desolation technique?”

Gao Shun was already so excited that he was about to dance with joy. It was not just the Great Desolation technique. A portion of the sect’s other powerful techniques had become incomplete because of that separation.

This had undoubtedly greatly weakened the overall combat power of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If these techniques regained their complete state, the strength of both their sects would definitely increase significantly.

They might even be able to vie for the title of the number one sect in the mystic world!

At this moment, Ao Lei was very shocked. The Great Desolation technique was originally an immortal-grade divine power, but because it was incomplete, it could currently only be considered a heaven-grade divine power.

Thinking this, Ao Lei excitedly asked, “Junior Brother Ye, can you communicate with the people of the Heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and said, “Unfortunately, this is not possible for the time being. If I want to communicate with them, my strength must reach the sealed immortal realm. Otherwise, I can’t bypass the worldly power.”

“I can’t communicate with them unless I come across an ancient tomb like the last time, or a secret realm that is connected to another continent.”

They all felt a little helpless after hearing this.

“Alright, let’s put this matter aside for now. After all, we haven’t reached a critical point yet, and we don’t know what the future will bring.”

“Perhaps the eight continents will have the opportunity to merge in the future.”

“There are many possibilities for the future, both good or bad. The only thing that is certain and wise is that we must seize the time to improve ourselves.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ao Lei let out a long sigh, before continuing, “The Divine Seal peak’s gathering is approaching. How are everyone’s preparations?”

The Divine Seal peak’s gathering was the biggest event in the East continent. If they could obtain a good ranking there, it would undoubtedly increase the reputation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, which in turn would attract more talented disciples to join their ranks.

Gao Shun smiled at this moment.

“You don’t have to worry about that, Senior Brother Ao. We have already made ample preparations. We’ll definitely get a good ranking this time around!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

While everyone was discussing this, Ye Xuan was in deep thought, thinking about what he should do first. With the threat of the strange power looming, he suddenly felt as if he did not have enough time.

At this moment, Elder Huang suddenly appeared. He looked very panicked, and his face was covered in wounds.

“Junior Brother Ye, your disciple…”

As soon as he arrived, Elder Huang immediately began to cry.

Seeing this scene, the chiefs who were present became nervous.

Was there an emergency??

Did someone attack the sect?

Because Elder Huang’s cultivation talent was not high, he was only responsible for teaching children to read and write in the sect.

Even if someone really came to attack the sect, he would not be drafted into the main fighting force.

As such, why had he been beaten up like this now? The chiefs were all very puzzled by this.

After seeing Elder Huang’s appearance, Ye Xuan was stunned. He had already realized what had happened and felt a little embarrassed.

Ao Lei”s brows furrowed, as he was unsure about what had happened.

Then, everyone looked at Ye Xuan in unison, because Elder Huang had clearly come to seek him out.

After noticing the gazes, Ye Xuan realized that this matter could not be concealed, so he simply said, “Elder Huang, tell me what happened.”

“Could it be that my disciple has caused you trouble?”

After hearing this, the chiefs present were momentarily stunned, before remembering that Ye Xuan had indeed recruited a new disciple recently.

However, that disciple of his looked to be at most six years old, so what kind of big trouble could she cause?

Elder Huang’s face was filled with helplessness as he cried, “Junior Brother Ye, you should hurry over and take a look. The disciple you took in really can’t be taught by ordinary people.”

“Why don’t you take her back to Cloud Sky peak and teach her yourself? I really can’t help you.”

“It’s only been a short while, and almost all the children in the study hall have been beaten up by her, especially Sword Spirit peak’s Martial Nephew Li, who was beaten beyond recognition…”

Upon hearing this, Li Dahai could not sit and watch.

“What?”

“Junior Brother Ye!”

Seeing Li Dahai’s furious appearance, Ye Xuan felt a little guilty at this time, but he was also helpless. This little girl was really good at causing trouble.

The other chiefs could not help but burst into laughter after hearing this.

“Pfft … Junior Brother Ye, this disciple you’ve taken in is comparable to Martial Uncle Tian Xuan when he was young.”

Gao Shun held his stomach and laughed.
