746 Important Meeting (Part 2)

Zhuge Yueyue was stunned when she was suddenly asked for her opinion.

She had participated in many meetings during her time in charge of Cloud Sky peak, but had remained silent in almost every meeting.

What was going on today? Why was she suddenly being asked for her opinion?

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Ao Lei in a daze. After looking around, she found that the other chiefs were also staring at her. She immediately stood up and said, “Um… I feel that the suggestions raised by all of the martial uncles and aunt are quite good. Cloud Sky peak is very supportive of this.”

Hearing this, the others nodded and smiled. Even though they were all hot-blooded just now, if a battle really broke out, they would have to rely on Ye Xuan to turn the tide in the end.

Only with his participation would the safety of the sect and its disciples be ensured.

“Alright…”

After gesturing for Zhuge Yueyue to sit down, Ao Lei said, “After this, dispatch disciples to help the forces of the various empires to build a strong line of defense.”

“Also, spread the word that our Great Wilderness Divine sect is willing to protect the common people with our lives!”

Hearing this, everyone stood up in unison and said, “Understood!”

They all knew very well what kind of commotion this news would cause.

At this critical moment, almost all of the forces and sects chose to close their doors to protect themselves, whereas the Great Wilderness Divine sect had done the opposite.

The sect’s reputation would reach an unprecedented level! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After the meeting ended, the chiefs all left and went back to make the necessary arrangements and preparations.

Gao Shun, on the other hand, made his way to the assessment venue, and Zhuge Yueyue did as well in order to meet up with Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun.

At this moment, she was happy and proud of the decision the sect had made. At the same time, she was also very worried that the disaster would be much worse than they anticipated, which might result in the situation going out of control.

At this moment, the assessment venue was full of people. Witnessing the emergence of one genius after another, the crowd was in constant discussion.

“I’m in full-panic mode right now. It’s only been a short while, yet so many geniuses have already appeared. Will I even be able to pass the first assessment?”

“Sigh… Don’t mention it. The recruitment this time has attracted too many geniuses.”

“Based on what I can see, there are close to six disciples with divine bones. Geniuses seem so abundant here. Perhaps we really won’t be able to pass.”

The people were all worried.

They really did not want to be eliminated just like that, especially given the fact that the Great Wilderness Divine sect was the most powerful sect in the East continent, and by extension, the safest.

Furthermore, if they were lucky enough to join the sect, they would bring glory and honor to their families and ancestors for generations.

Thus, almost everyone here regarded this assessment as a matter of life and death.

While they were whispering to each other, there was a flash of light, which soon dissipated to reveal the figure of a burly man with an elegant bearing on the high platform.

When he appeared, the people who were originally whispering to each other all became silent. They could sense his supreme realm aura permeate the venue.

“If I’m not wrong, this person is the chief of the Hidden Sword peak, Gao Shun?”

“F*ck! It’s him indeed! We’re so lucky to have met such a big shot.”

After a moment of silence, the crowd became excited again.

After all, Gao Shun was a highly-respected cultivator. No matter where he went, he was someone people looked up to.

The majority of the people who came to participate in the assessment were ordinary people. It was already an amazing thing to find themselves in the presence of a mystic lord realm expert, much less a supreme realm expert.

“Senior Brother Gao, why did you come here?”

After seeing Gao Shun suddenly appear, Elder Luo, who was in charge of this assessment, was stunned.

This was only the first round of the assessment, so there was no need to be here, nor would there be anything particularly noteworthy.

Most of the other chiefs only appeared during the later assessments, when the more talented potential disciples had made it through the ranks.

Could it be that he had connections among these people, and specially came over to show concern?

Just as he was about to ask, Gao Shun spoke.

“Everyone, I have good news to announce!”

Hearing this, everyone was taken aback.

“Huh… Good news?”

Everyone looked at Gao Shun in confusion.

After noticing that he had everyone’s attention, Gao Shun smiled proudly before saying, “Just now, the chiefs and grand elder of the Grand Wilderness Divine sect held a meeting, in which we made an important decision that concerns the East continent…”
