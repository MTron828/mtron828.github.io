318 Bye Bai Long

“Alright! You don’t need to pretend. Do you really think that I don’t know what you’ve done?”

Ye Xuan interrupted Bai Long.

Bai Long’s expression changed drastically.

When Jun Moyu and the others saw this, they looked at each other questioningly.

!!

They did not understand what Ye Xuan was getting at,

“Are you going to end your own life, or do you want me to do it?”

Ye Xuan asked.

As soon as he finished speaking, Jun Moyu and the others’ expressions changed.

Ye Xuan wanted to kill Bai Long?

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, have there been some misunderstandings between us?”

Although Bai Long was terrified, he still tried to remain calm.

“Do you really think I don’t know that you’re the one who sent that cultivator from the Hidden God Hall?”

Ye Xuan’s tone turned more and more sinister.

Hearing this, Bai Long staggered, but then he quickly made a decision.

In an instant, he released his shadow intent and tried to fuse with the darkness in the spatial turbulence to escape. However, he suddenly found that he could not move.

“I didn’t think that my Tower of Heaven would be so tempting. Even a King realm expert like yourself tried to take it for yourself.”

“What a pity! You’ve provoked someone you shouldn’t have!”

Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and made a tapping motion. A beam of light containing a terrifying destructive power suddenly burst out, instantly drowning out Bai Long’s shadowy figure.

Pfft!

The spatial turbulence suddenly trembled, and Bai Long’s figure appeared.

However, Bai Long’s face was extremely pale at this moment. Blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth. The meridians in his body had long been destroyed by Ye Xuan’s destruction intent.

At this moment, the power of his spatial intent descended and enveloped Bai Long. The scene from before repeated itself, and Bai Long’s body began to collapse on itself.

Bai Long’s heart was filled with fear. He now understood the terror that the sea race’s experts had felt.

“Ye Xuan! Don’t kill me! I’m one of the human race’s King realm experts! You can’t kill me!”

“We’re at war now, and the outcome of the battle depends on us King realm experts. Without me, the human race will face great dangers!”

“Hmph! It seems that you also know that we’re both humans, yet you still decided to covet my Tower of Heaven!”

“Had I not been strong enough, you would have taken it, and my life with it!”

Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“Fellow Daoists, we’ve known each other for decades. You can’t just leave me in the lurch!”

“I’ve sacrificed so much for the human race. You can’t let him do this to me!”

“Ye Xuan, if you really attack me, you’ll be making an enemy of the entire human race!”

“Jun Moyu, what are you still waiting for? Contact the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land!”

Bai Long desperately cried for help from Jun Moyu and the others.

“This…”

Jun Moyu and the others hesitated when they saw this.

Bai Long was indeed an indispensable combat asset in this war. However, Ye Xuan’s strength was too terrifying. They wanted to mediate, but lacked the strength. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Furthermore, it was all Bai Long’s fault for being too greedy. The ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land had clearly expressed his stance, yet this guy had still given in to his desires.

Still, no matter what, an additional King realm expert could easily end up determining the balance of the war between two races.

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, why don’t you…”

Jun Feitian bowed to Ye Xuan with respect and was about to plead for mercy for Bai Long.

Ye Xuan looked at him and interrupted Jun Feitian.

“For Jun Xuantian’s sake, I won’t hold this against you. But this should not happen again!”

Jun Feitian’s expression changed when he heard this, and he immediately gave up on persuading Ye Xuan.

There was no other reason other than the fact that the Jun Xuantian that Ye Xuan mentioned was Jun Lingtian’s ancestor, the Heavenly King realm expert who had stood up for Ye Xuan.

“No! Ye Xuan! You can’t kill me!”

“Without me, the humans will be at a disadvantage in the war!”

Bai Long was panicking. Even Jun Feitian could not persuade Ye Xuan!

“Be a good person in your next life! Greedy people never have good endings!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan clenched his fist, and Bai Long turned into dust with a face full of unwillingness and hatred.

Some distance away, Huo Bodong, who witnessed this scene, was thanking his lucky stars.

“My God, fortunately I didn’t act impulsively at that time, otherwise I would most likely be the next one on the chopping board!”

“Alright! Do what you need to do!”

“Soon, more sea race King realm experts will come to the Huangyu Zone.”

Ye Xuan issued a warning to Jun Moyu and the others.

Although there were many humans on the Tianyuan continent, they were still far inferior to the countless members of the sea race.

Of course, the sea race was just a general term. In fact, the sea race was made up of countless different tribes, and their degree of unity was far less than that of the human race.

Otherwise, with the sea race’s terrifying strength, they would have long conquered the human race’s territory.

The power of karma allowed Ye Xuan to predict that, in less than two years, countless experts from the sea race would enter the Tianyuan continent and attack the human race.

“Thank you for letting us know, Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan!”

“And thank you for saving us as well. We will never forget your life-saving grace, and will definitely repay you in the future!”

The three of them bowed to Ye Xuan with gratitude.
