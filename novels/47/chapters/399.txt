400 Coming Clean

“My precious disciple, what’s the matter with you?”

Seeing the change in Feng Xiyun’s expression, Ye Xuan asked.

“It’s nothing. I’m fine.”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she lowered her head as she could not help but recall the fate she had barely escaped. Her expression instantly turned slightly sullen.

In the eyes of outsiders, she was the princess of the divine empire, which was a status that everyone wished to have. However, in reality, she was just a tool to create a marriage alliance between the divine empires.

In addition, her mother had passed away early, her father was busy with political affairs, and her brothers only knew how to scheme against each other. No one treated her sincerely.

Before she acknowledged Ye Xuan as her master, her only true friend was Xin’er.

“Little girl, do you have something on your mind?” Ye Xuan could not help but ask.

There was a sense of worry on his disciple’s face. Could it be that something had happened in the palace?

Feng Xiyun noticed Ye Xuan’s concerned gaze and felt touched.

“Teacher, actually, I have a secret that I’ve been hiding from you.”

“I was worried that once I reveal this secret, I wouldn’t be able to become your disciple.”

“However, these past few days, I’ve seen Teacher’s good intentions. Not only did you teach me cultivation techniques, you even gave me the precious bone of a descendant of an ancient beast without any hesitation.”

“I am very ashamed. I should not have kept this secret from you, Teacher. I should not have involved you in the power struggle of the divine empire without your knowledge.”

“Teacher, I’m sorry. This is all my fault!”

As she spoke, Feng Xiyun started sobbing. Her expression was filled with guilt.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled faintly.

When he learned of Feng Xiyun’s identity as a Princess, he had already guessed that there was an ulterior motive behind her wanting to become his disciple.

However, it was just a power struggle in the royal family. He was not concerned about it at all.

Of course, Ye Xuan did not want to force Feng Xiyun. If this girl wanted to say it, she would naturally say it.

Feng Xiyun looked at Ye Xuan’s calm expression and became even more puzzled.

“Teacher, are you not angry?”

She had concealed a secret for him and had become his disciple for her own selfish reasons, so why did he seem unaffected?

“Why should I be angry?” Ye Xuan asked with a smile, and then said with a gentle look.

“This is your personal matter. I’ve already said that I don’t care about my disciple’s identity or talent.”

“As for the secrets you’ve been hiding, you can tell me about them when you’re comfortable doing so.”

“Besides, as my disciple, even if you’re publicly criticized, I’ll stand behind you.”

“Even if the sky falls, I will still be there to shelter you.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s calm and confident words, Feng Xiyun was shocked and touched at the same time.

Who would not love such an excellent and perfect teacher?

He gave her a sense of great security.

“Teacher, don’t worry. I won’t hide any secrets from you in the future,” Feng Xiyun said with a determined look. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Silly girl! You didn’t do anything wrong, so you don’t need to blame yourself,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“Teacher, my true identity is the princess of the Yangli divine empire. Because my mother passed away early, I had no one to rely on in the palace, and I was fated to become a tool to forge a marriage alliance between two divine empires.”

“Before I escaped from the palace, my father had already arranged for me to marry the prince of the Haihan divine empire. However, I didn’t want to give in to my fate and marry someone I don’t know at all.”

“As such, I brought Xin’er and sneaked out! I will forever remember Teacher’s kindness to me.”

“However, by now, people from the royal palace should have already noticed that I’m missing and should be searching for me now.”

“If they find us, I will not implicate you, Teacher.”

Feng Xiyun’s face was distraught.

She did not want to go back, she did not want to become a puppet of fate, and she did not want to be separated from her teacher.

Despite having met him only briefly, she had been given so much.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan gently wiped the tears from the corner of Feng Xiyun’s eyes and said in a gentle tone, “Silly girl, don’t worry. With me around, who would dare to take you away?”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun suddenly raised her head. Seeing Ye Xuan’s determined expression, she revealed a hopeful smile.

“Mm! I’ll believe in Teacher then. With Teacher by my side, no one will be able to bully me!”

“Teacher, don’t worry. I’ll definitely work hard in my cultivation in the future and won’t let you down!”
