309 The Arrival Of A Crisis

Before this, the rumor that Ye Xuan was Shangguan Wan ‘er’s teacher had spread throughout the Huangyu Zone.

However, Shangguan Wan’er had not acknowledged it. Coupled with the influence of the Luo Heaven Palace, no one put any stock in the rumors.

“That’s right! My teacher is Ye Xuan,” Shangguan Wan’er admitted.

“What? Ye Xuan is really the Palace Master’s teacher?!”

When the elders heard this, they were shocked beyond belief.

Somehow, the rumor was true!

What kind of person was Ye Xuan?

How did he manage to make their prideful Palace Master acknowledge him as her teacher?

Of course, even though the elders were puzzled, they tactfully chose not to ask too much.

“The reason why I summoned all of you is to select a new Palace Master.”

Shangguan Wan’er already had a plan in mind.

With her current strength, the Luo Heaven Palace could not help her much. Only by following Ye Xuan could she keep getting stronger.

When the elders heard this, their expressions changed.

It seemed that the Palace Master had made up her mind to leave the Luo Heaven Palace.

The Luo Heaven Palace was established by Shangguan Wan’er, and countless cultivators of the Luo Heaven Palace regarded her as their pillar. If Shangguan Wan’ er left, what would they do?

“Palace Master, no matter where you go, Zhang Li will always be by your side!”

At that moment, a pretty-looking lady in a sky-blue dress walked forward and knelt down solemnly before Shangguan Wan’er.

“We as well!”

Seeing this, the other elders also knelt down.

The reason why they had chosen to become elders of the Luo Heaven Palace was not because of the strength and cultivation resources of the Luo Heaven Palace, but because they were willing to follow Shangguan Wan’er.

They all admired her greatly.

Looking at the familiar faces in front of her, Shangguan Wan’er’s heart was moved.

However, moments later, she steeled herself.

“No!”

“Staying by my side is not the best choice. You should walk your own paths!”

Shangguan Wan’er waved her sleeve, and a gentle energy wave immediately lifted the elders, who were kneeling on the ground, back to their feet.

“Palace Master!”

All the elders’ gazes fell on Shangguan Wan’er. Their eyes were red and teary.

Although Shangguan Wan’er looked cold on the outside, they knew in their hearts that she was a kind and gentle person on the inside, especially to those she was close with. Which of the elders here had not received Shangguan Wan’er’s kindness before? None!

“Alright! You don’t need to persuade me anymore!”

“I have made up my mind. Either you choose a new palace master, or you disband the Luo Heaven Palace,” Shangguan Wan’er said.

However, deep down, she was still a little reluctant.

“Palace Master, no matter what your decision is, there will only be one Palace Master in the past and future of the Luo Heaven Palace, and that is you!”

Zhang Li looked at Shangguan Wan’er meaningfully.

“Don’t worry, Palace Master. We will take good care of the Luo Heaven Palace, but we will never choose a new palace master!”

“No matter where you go, the Luo Heaven Palace will always be your home. It will always be here waiting for you to come back!”

The other elders also nodded with firm gazes.

Since they could not influence Shangguan Wan’er’s decision, they would protect the Luo Heaven Palace for her.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er fell silent.

She looked at the sad elders and sighed deeply.

After thinking for a while, Shangguan Wan’er flicked her sleeves and passed on the high-level cultivation methods and martial techniques that she had awakened from her memories to the elders.

“If the Luo Heaven Palace encounters an irresolvable disaster, you can crush this jade token.”

Shangguan Wan’er stretched out her finger, and a jade token refined by her spiritual sense appeared in front of everyone.

No matter how far the distance was, as long as the jade token was crushed, Shangguan Wan’er would be able to sense it instantly.

“Oh right! This is a jade token given to me by my teacher. The jade token contains extremely powerful energy, so it should not be used unless it is a life-and-death situation for the Luo Heaven Palace.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a dazzling jade token suddenly appeared in front of everyone. Then, while everyone was recovering from the shock, she tore space apart and left.

Even though Liu Chengtian had fallen, the Lightning Divine Palace would definitely not let this matter go. They would definitely return for revenge.

Now, she could only return to the Qingyun sect to seek her teacher’s help.

Very quickly, Shangguan Wan’er returned to the Tower of Heaven using the jade token Ye Xuan had given her.

Yue, Li Qingyan, and the others were still cultivating.

“Wan’er, in a month, a Human King realm expert will attack the Luo Heaven Palace.”

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s voice rang out in Shangguan Wan’er’s ears.

Shangguan Wan’er expression changed.

“You don’t have to worry too much. I believe you have already left one of my jade tokens with them. That will be enough to deal with the problem.”

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s tense body finally relaxed.

As expected, everything was within her teacher’s calculations. She wondered what level his karmic intent had reached.

“Since the matter is pretty much resolved, it’s time for you to refine the heart of heavenly lightning.”

Ye Xuan did not care too much about Shangguan Wan’er leaving the jade token with the Luo Heaven Palace. After all, it was a gift to his disciple, so it was her right to use it however she wished.

Furthermore, he had given her more than one.

Now that the crisis of the Luo Heaven Palace had been resolved, Shangguan Wan’er’s refining of the heart of heavenly lightning would not be interrupted by any sudden changes.

“I will heed Teacher’s instructions!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes lit up.

Finally, it was time to refine the heart of heavenly lightning!

The heart of heavenly lightning that Ye Xuan had given her was a fifth-level one, which would allow her to comprehend fifth-level heavenly lightning intent.

At that time, her strength would be greatly improved.

Shangguan Wan’er suppressed the excitement in her heart and then found a space in the Tower of Heaven to refine the heart of heavenly lightning.

Time flew by, and a month passed by.

At this moment, a terrifying spiritual pressure suddenly descended on the Miaoling Region, covering every corner of the region in an instant.

It was the spiritual pressure of a King realm expert!

Once one’s cultivation broke through to the King realm, their power would be enough to destroy an entire region if they were to fight.
