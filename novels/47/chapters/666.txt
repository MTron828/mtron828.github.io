667 Identity Exposed (Part 1)

Fortunately, Ye Xuan had given her a lot of recovery pills, so she immediately took out a soul-returning pill and returned to her peak condition.

However, Li Hong did not let up, and pushed his advantage in an attempt to secure his victory.

“Go to hell!”

Before Li Hong could hit her while she was down, a huge hammer came whistling toward his face.

Boom!

Before he could dodge, the hammer smashed into his face, sending him flying hundreds of meters back.

“You actually dared to harm my second sister! You’re courting death!” Xiang Yun shouted angrily.

This was not the end. Purple lightning fell from the sky and instantly scattered the illusory phantom of the ferocious beast.

“Good heavens!”

“Is this for real?”

That little girl had actually sent Li Hong flying, and even took care of his beast gaze?

Li Hong spat out a few mouthfuls of blood in succession. When he looked up, he saw purple lightning bolts constantly flickering around this little girl, forming a lightning domain that looked extremely oppressive. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Wha…?”

Outside the ancient realm, Daoist Gu Hao stood up abruptly, and his expression was filled with disbelief.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could finally relax.

‘This little girl really does pull through in a crisis,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself. There was still an immense amount of energy in her body, but this energy could only be used in times of danger.

It was likely that the energy in her body had been activated because she believed that Feng Xiyun was in danger.

“Great! Awesome! Magnificent!” Gao Shun shouted loudly.

At this moment, Xiang Yun seemed to be deep in thought. Suddenly, she opened her eyes, which shone brightly, and erupted with terrifying strength.

An illusory figure as beautiful as a fairy appeared behind her, which made everyone unconsciously lower their heads.

“Huh…?”

“Could she be the reincarnation of a mighty figure?”

Although this illusory figure only appeared for an instant, almost everyone saw it.

Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were both shocked.

“Is this the reincarnation that only exists in ancient books?”

Daoist Canghai muttered to himself. He could not believe what he had just seen.

He turned to Ye Xuan beside him and saw that the latter was still calm. This meant that he must have known about all this long ago.

His heart was filled with envy. Ye Xuan was really lucky to have accepted a disciple like her.

“Haha, I guess it’s set in stone then. This little girl has the potential to reach the sealed immortal realm.”

Daoist Xu Yun sighed. His casual words from earlier had become a reality.

“Little Brother Ye Xuan, you’re too good at keeping secrets. Your youngest disciple is actually the reincarnation of a mighty figure.”

“Fortunately, I managed to leave a favorable impression on her.”

Daoist Canghai looked at Ye Xuan with envy.

Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “No, no! How is this related to me?”

“It was just fate that we met.”

After hearing these words, the people tacitly stopped talking.

In their hearts, they all understood what her status as a reincarnated being meant.

This little girl definitely had a bright future ahead of her, but in order for her to mature and unleash her full potential, many things would be needed.

Fortunately, she had become Ye Xuan’s disciple, which meant that she would not lack resources, treasures or even protection.

No one would dare to attack Ye Xuan’s disciple openly.

On the other hand, Daoist Gu Hao’s face instantly turned black after seeing this scene. His disciple was supposed to have taken care of both of those girls, but now this little girl had revealed such terrifying power.

He turned around to look at Ye Xuan. A thought suddenly came to his mind, and his eyes were filled with coldness.

Coincidentally, at this moment, Ye Xuan noticed his gaze.

“Daoist Gu Hao, do you have something to say?”

He had to be wary of these people with ill intentions.

“She is the reincarnation of a mighty figure. Your Great Wilderness Divine sect is really lucky. ”

“However, who knows if this little girl will be able to grow…”

Hearing Daoist Gu Hao’s words, Ye Xuan only smiled calmly and said, “Is that so? It seems that there will always be people who will become jealous when they see others doing well.”

“However, it’s best if such a situation does not appear…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out his Cloud Heaven Sword, releasing waves of extremely terrifying sword intent into the surroundings.

The entire area was engulfed in his sword intent, causing everyone to turn pale and tremble.

What was going on? Why was Ye Xuan doing this?

Everyone was starting to panic.
