Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Like the Heavenly Lightning Pool, this mystic realm was filled with endless power of heavenly lightning.

“It seems that I have to investigate the identity of that beautiful figure,” Ye Xuan said to himself.

Although he had failed to see her through the power of karma, Ye Xuan knew that she was here in this mystic realm.

Shangguan Wan’er had killed the master of the Blood Moon Temple, who was Ye Xuan’s mortal enemy. Hence, there was a weak karmic thread between the two.

Buzzzzzz!

Shangguan Wan’er, who was in the middle of comprehending heavenly lightning intent, frowned suddenly.

Someone was watching her!

“What?”

When Ye Xuan saw a woman in white sitting cross-legged on the top of a huge mountain, welcoming the baptism of thousands of bolts of heavenly lightning bolts, he was stunned to see her attributes.

[Comprehension value: 798]

[Innate bone value: 798]

[Undying Xuan Huang sword physique (Unawakened)]

[Awakening condition: Ninth-level sword intent]

[Warning: This lady is the reincarnation of an ancient great empress.]

What? The reincarnation of an ancient great empress?

Furthermore, her innate bone value and comprehension value were incredibly high. She also had an unawakened special constitution.

In that case, once she awakened the special constitution, how high would her attributes reach?

Ye Xuan’s eyes glowed with desire.

She would make a suitable disciple!

However, Ye Xuan could tell that this woman was extremely powerful and, as the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, this woman naturally had many powerful trump cards. She was not on the same level as the cultivators Ye Xuan had seen before.

That would not stop him from trying though. He wanted to help her awaken her special sword constitution, as this would awaken his own higher-level sword constitution.

Ye Xuan was eager to get a stronger special constitution.

How could he convince her to be his disciple?

If she had awakened the memories of her previous life, this would be an uphill task.

Of course, he was not in a hurry. If he were to try to convince her now, it was likely that she would reject him, and might even try to attack him.

A battle between him and her would probably cause this mystic realm to collapse.

A tenth-level unity realm cultivator wanted to take in a pattern condensation realm expert as a disciple?

Would this matter not make people laugh their heads off?

Ye Xuan glanced at Shangguan Wan’er a few times, then randomly picked a mountain peak and sat down.

Shangguan Wan’er sensed that Ye Xuan had no other intentions, and her slightly furrowed brows slowly relaxed. Then, she began to comprehend heavenly lightning intent again.

Shangguan Wan’er wanted to borrow the power of the endless heavenly lightning bolts to see if she could comprehend the complete form of heavenly lightning intent.

“It seems that this woman has not awakened much of her previous life’s memories,” Ye Xuan said to himself after observing her for a moment.

If the other party had really awakened all of her memories, would it not have been a piece of cake for her to comprehend heavenly lightning intent?

Furthermore, she would not have needed to rely on the endless heavenly lightning bolts, and would simply be able to do it from memories alone.

“I should take advantage of this and try to take her in as a disciple as soon as possible!”

Ye Xuan quickly made a decision.

If the woman in white completely awakened her memories, it was likely that Ye Xuan would no longer have the possibility of taking her in as a disciple.

Therefore, he had to take advantage of this situation and strike while the iron was hot. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Shangguan Wan’er had no idea that this young man who had just entered the mystic realm was thinking about how to take her in as a disciple.

Moreover, she also had no idea that the Tower of Heaven was in Ye Xuan’s hands.

At this moment, she was completely focused on comprehending heavenly lightning intent. the will of Heavenly Thunder.

Ye Xuan also did the same, but soon realized that there was something wrong with this situation.

According to the hint given by the power of karma, his opportunity was in this mystic realm, and it was either related to heavenly lightning intent or this woman in white.

Although taking her in as his disciple would bring him great benefits, it was not something that was achievable within a short period of time, and it was the same for the comprehension of heavenly lightning intent.
