721 Preparations Before Breakthrough

“Even though each of you performed outstandingly, you must not become arrogant or careless. You must continue to cultivate diligently.”

Thank you readers!

“The path of cultivation is boundless. During this process, you must remain steadfast and focused.”

“If you slack off during this period, then no matter how talented you are, you will end up being surpassed by other geniuses.”

“As your teacher, I’ve been teaching you everything I can. However, you should also think about your own cultivation direction and paths. Just be at ease and explore the possibilities.”

After hearing this, the three of them nodded their heads like chicks pecking at rice.

Zhuge Yueyue had reached the peak of the void realm for a long time, and only needed to enter secluded cultivation to break through to the heaven realm.

Feng Xiyun was still a middle-stage void realm cultivator, as she had been focused on alchemy recently and neglected her cultivation. Still, it was progressing at a steady pace.

Moreover, her mastery of alchemy had increased by leaps and bounds during that time.

Xiang Yun, on the other hand, would soon reach the middle-stage of the void realm in terms of body refining cultivation. Considering how young she was and how briefly she had been cultivating, this was indeed unprecedented. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Furthermore, she had broken through her limits during the gathering, which meant that her strength would only continue to increase.

Perhaps this was the main benefit of body refining cultivation. As long as one’s body could withstand it, their cultivation would progress extremely quickly.

Ye Xuan looked at his three disciples with relief. Before he entered secluded cultivation himself, he still had things to instruct them.

He turned his gaze to Zhuge Yueyue and said, “Yueyue, for the time being, you will be in charge of Cloud Sky peak.”

“As the head disciple of Cloud Sky Peak and the future chief, this is a very good opportunity for you to familiarize yourself with the things that you will need to manage in the future.”

“This way, you won’t feel flustered when you replace me in managing Cloud Sky peak in the future.”

Zhuge Yueyue was stunned to hear this and asked, “Teacher, are you going somewhere?”

She was caught off guard because she really did not expect to ever take over the management of Cloud Sky peak.

After all, her teacher was still young, and given how powerful he was, it was likely that he would outlive her. Thus, unless he abdicated his position to her, Zhuge Yueyue was resigned to the fact that she would never take over the leadership mantle of Cloud Sky peak.

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s panicked expression, Ye Xuan replied calmly, “Don’t worry. I can feel that I’m about to break through, so I’m just entering secluded cultivation.”

“Because I don’t know how long I’ll be in seclusion, you will need to manage Cloud Sky peak in the meantime.”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun instantly teared up.

“Teacher, are you going to fall into an eternal sleep and leave me?”

However, when they saw her pitiful appearance, they chose not to make a big fuss out of it.

Xiang Yun did not understand what secluded cultivation was. She only vaguely remembered being told that her grandmaster had gone into secluded cultivation at that time and had her teacher take over Cloud Sky peak. Then, her grandmaster never returned.

It was because of this that she felt that the same thing was about to happen to her teacher. Moreover, her teacher was even having her first sister take over Cloud Sky peak.

Her grandmaster did the same thing back then too!

Hearing these words, Ye Xuan’s ears stung. This little girl was very filial, but she also had a special way with words.

“Cough cough, don’t worry. I am in good health. How could I fall into eternal sleep so soon?”

Then, he looked at Xiang Yun with a serious expression and instructed, “Yun’er, you must be good. I will only be in secluded cultivation for a few days, then I’ll be back with you all.”

Xiang Yun was still very puzzled. She wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and asked, “Teacher, what is this secluded cultivation you’re talking about?”

Due to her sadness, the hidden power in her body was starting to go out of control.

When he noticed this, Ye Xuan immediately rubbed her little head and sent a stream of his spiritual power into her body to help her suppress the violent power.

Then, he smiled and said, “Secluded cultivation is when a person goes to a very quiet place to concentrate on their cultivation. Only after they break through will they come out again.”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun’s mood finally improved.

However, her grandmaster had also entered secluded cultivation, so why did everyone think that her grandmaster had passed away?

Xiang Yun was puzzled, but did not pursue the matter further.

Ye Xuan then reminded her, “Little girl, during this period, you have to be obedient. You have to listen to your first and second sisters, understand? You can’t go around causing trouble for me. ”

“When I return, I will teach you an even more powerful hammer technique, alright?”

“Really? Teacher, shall we pinky promise?”
