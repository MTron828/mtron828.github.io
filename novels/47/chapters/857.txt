858 Deception

Ye Xuan was extremely happy now. With the help of such a powerful sword technique, he believed that he would truly be able to strive for invincibility.

If he could really completely master it, then his combat strength would definitely experience a qualitative leap. He would even be able to fight true immortals without relying on the world’s laws restricting their power.

Especially the ninth sword move. If he really used it, he would be able to slash the stars down from space! How domineering would that be?

At this moment, another system notification rang out.

“Ding! Congratulations! The immortal-grade body refining technique has been completed. The host has obtained the immortal-grade Godfiend scripture!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ye Xuan trembled with glee. It really was his lucky day today!

After calming himself down, Ye Xuan checked out his new technique, and he was on the verge of jumping up and down in glee.

The Godfiend scripture was one of the most terrifying body-refining techniques since ancient times. If one could completely grasp it, they would be close to indestructible, even if subjected to the laws of the world. Heck, it would be nearly impossible for him to kill himself even if he tried!

Having obtained these two cultivation techniques, Ye Xuan felt much more confident. When he eventually departed to the Heavenly Dao World, he would be fully prepared for the dangers and enemies there.

Within the same realm, almost no one would be able to defeat him. This would also make his path to the eternal realm much smoother.

“Teacher… Teacher!”

While Ye Xuan was lost in his excitement, he suddenly heard someone call out to him. Snapping back to his senses, he realized that it was Feng Xiyun.

“Is something the matter?”

“Uh… Actually… Nothing.”

Feng Xiyun sighed and said, “Teacher, you didn’t respond to me no matter how much I called you, so I thought that something had happened to you.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan rubbed her head and said, “Little girl, were you hoping that something happened to me?”

“I’m innocent! I’ve never thought that way at all,” Feng Xiyun played with her hair and said with a wronged expression.

She had indeed been very concerned about her teacher just now.

Changing the topic, she asked with concern, “Teacher, is Elder Qian Yi alright now?”

Elder Qian Yi looked like he was in pain, so she was somewhat worried. If something happened to him while he was on Cloud Sky peak, it would likely sour the relationship between the two sects.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan used his spiritual sense to examine Elder Qian Yi’s condition.

After a moment, he said, “Don’t worry. It’s not a big deal. He’s just rebuilding his body now. When he succeeds, his cultivation will improve significantly.”

“Alright.”

Feng Xiyun heaved a sigh of relief.

“Hmm… Now that his cultivation technique has been dealt with, we have to deal with yours.”

After Ye Xuan said this, he sat down and took a sip of tea.

“Eh? Is there a problem with my cultivation technique?”

After Feng Xiyun heard this, she was a little confused.

“Teacher, tell me quickly. What’s wrong with my cultivation technique?”

“This situation is bad.”

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he pretended to look worried and serious.

After seeing Ye Xuan’s distressed expression, Feng Xiyun’s heart trembled.

What exactly happened?

If it was not a big deal, why was her teacher so worried?

Thinking this, she began to panic.

Ye Xuan smiled inwardly when he saw this. The stage was set!

Then, he called her over.

Ye Xuan gently smoothed her hair and said worriedly, “Xiyun, I’ve been thinking about your problem recently…”
