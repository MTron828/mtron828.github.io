950 Wukong Appears

The old man did not say anything, but the space around him seemed to be twisting violently, filled with killing intent.

At this moment, Ye Xuan noticed that there was a group of young disciples below this old man. If he guessed correctly, they were also from the Immortal Divine sect.

“Hehe, this is interesting. Things are going to become fun again.”

As he muttered to himself, another figure made their entrance. There were sparks and lightning trailing behind this figure, and there was even the sound of rhythmic drum beats, seemingly heralding this person’s arrival.

Thump, thump, thump, thump…

The originally tense atmosphere was immediately shattered with the arrival of this furry monkey.

“F*ck! Why did this little furry monkey come here?”

Everyone was taken aback and surprised, but the little monkey was unfazed by the attention. Wukong raised his staff aloft and then slammed it into the barrier in front of him.

Bang!

The barrier did not shatter. The little monkey was thrown back by the force of the recoil, and landed in a pile of mud while shouting, “F*ck! I’m so angry!”

After a moment of silence, the crowd burst into laughter when they saw the monkey’s dejected appearance.

“Hehe, where did this furry monkey come from? Does he not have any self-awareness? He actually wanted to break the ancient palace’s barrier?”

“Can he not see that so many sealed immortal realm experts are still observing and haven’t dared to make a move?”

Seeing the little furry monkey’s misfortune, everyone did not hesitate to mock him.

Ye Xuan was feeling second-hand embarrassment at this point. It was fortunate that people did not know that this little monkey was actually one of his disciples.

At this moment, a shout rang out from behind him. Ye Xuan and Yanran turned around and saw Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun rushing over.

Ye Xuan maintained his calm demeanor, but Yanran was overjoyed and said, “Girls, why did you both come here?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun flew over to the left and right sides of Yanran. They held her arms and said in unison, “Teacher’s wife, we actually chased this little monkey all the way here.”

Feng Xiyun became angry when she mentioned this little monkey and said fiercely, “This stinky monkey is really bad to the bone. He made me so angry. I have to catch him and beat him up ruthlessly.”

Seeing Xiyun’s furious expression, Yanran was puzzled and asked, “What did this little monkey do?”

Feng Xiyun did not know how to explain it, but Zhuge Yueyue smiled and said, “Teacher’s wife, not long ago, we found a Witch Hazel Flower. Xiyun spent a great deal of effort to defeat all of the competitors who wanted to take the heavenly treasure.”

“However, just as she was about to take it, this little monkey appeared out of nowhere and knocked her away before running away with the witch hazel flower.”

Zhuge Yueyue chuckled after she finished relaying what happened.

“First Sister!”

Hearing Zhuge Yueyue chuckle, Feng Xiyun became even more unhappy. After all, who could be happy after having a treasure stolen by an unscrupulous monkey?

It was fine if he had only snatched her witch hazel flower away, but this fellow had swallowed it in front of her! It was simply infuriating.

After hearing Yueyue’s words, Yanran finally understood what had happened. A smile briefly appeared on her face, but it was forcefully suppressed by her.

As comical as the matter was, it would be very unkind of him to laugh at Xiyun at the moment.

“Cough, cough, alright. I won’t laugh at you anymore.”

Seeing how unhappy Feng Xiyun was, Yueyue quickly suppressed her laughter. On the other hand, Yanran rubbed Feng Xiyun’s head and said, “Xiyun, don’t be angry. I’ll definitely back you up and help you teach this monkey a lesson.”

“He really doesn’t know what’s good for him. He actually dared to treat you like this.”

After saying these words, Yanran’s expression suddenly turned cold.

As for Ye Xuan, his expression had turned somewhat strange. Somehow, his disciples had actually ended up in conflict, so he was in a difficult position.

However, no matter what, the little monkey was in the wrong here, so he thought that he would have to teach this little monkey a lesson to curb the latter’s tendency for troublemaking.

However, it seemed that Yanran was going to step in, which made things dangerous. After all, Yanran did not know that this little monkey was actually his disciple.

If Yanran killed Wukong, what should he do?

“Ahem, wait a moment.”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan immediately pulled Yanran away before she could take action. Yanran was confused and asked, “Why should I wait?”

“Your disciple has already been bullied by others to this extent, but as a teacher, you’re actually stopping me from helping her? What’s going on?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s mind short-circuited and he did not know what to say. After some time, he gave up, and let Yanran go. He could only secretly pray for the little monkey in his heart.

‘Wukong, as your teacher, I’ve already tried my best to help you. The rest will depend on your own luck.’

He had almost let the cat out of the bag, but that would have created even more problems, so he refrained from doing so.

No matter what he said, this little furry monkey possessed a powerful karmic power, and was destined to cause trouble everywhere.

If others really found out that the little furry monkey was his disciple, it would be difficult to deal with.

Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!
