“This upgraded system is awesome!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes were filled with excitement.

What a big windfall!

…

In the days that passed after, Cloud Sky peak returned to its peaceful state.

Zhuge Yueyue continued to practice the Cloud Sky sword technique. With the support of the profound ice divine bone, she quickly became more and more familiar with the sword technique. She also broke through to the second level of the divine mystic realm.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was also quite surprised, but after thinking about it carefully, he understood.

The heavenly marrow pill’s medicinal power was extremely heaven-defying, and the profound ice divine bone that had been condensed in Zhuge Yueyue’s body was of a rather high grade. It could be said that this girl’s cultivation talent had been raised to the level of a genius.

In addition, she worked tirelessly at her cultivation, which compounded the effects of her newfound level of talent.

As for Ye Xuan, he had been studying the Flora sword technique this entire time. With the support of the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, he constantly comprehended the profundity of its essence and successfully cultivated it to the major mastery stage.

Now that he had the Flora sword technique as his trump card, Ye Xuan no longer needed to fear anyone or anything in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

On one fine day, in the early hours of the morning, Ye Xuan left Cloud Sky peak and headed for the meeting hall.

This was due to Gongsun Shouyue’s order to gather.

After this period of investigation, there was already some progress regarding the attack of the berserk beasts that had occurred some time ago.

To Ye Xuan’s surprise, berserk beast attacks had not only appeared in the area under the jurisdiction of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, but also all over the East continent.

Furthermore, the attacks of these berserk beasts had not ended yet. There were brutal berserk beast attacks happening everywhere in the East Continent, causing misery to the commonfolk.

In order to solve this problem, the Yangli divine empire, Huolie divine empire, and the Haihan divine empire in the East continent sent invitations to the holy lands of the East continent.

They hoped that the cultivators of the various holy lands would work together to solve this issue.

Since the Great Wilderness Divine sect was part of the Yangli divine empire’s territory and was one of the most powerful holy lands within it, they naturally received an invitation.

Therefore, Gongsun Shouyue called for a meeting to ask for their thoughts.

Everyone agreed that the Great Wilderness Divine sect should accept the invitation of the Yangli divine empire.

Ye Xuan naturally agreed. He had originally planned to bring Zhuge Yueyue to the outside world for training after the Seven Peaks competition.

However, it seemed that his plan had to be brought forward.

In the meeting hall.

Gongsun Shouyue looked at the group in front of him and said in a deep voice, “Since everyone has agreed, let’s go back and make preparations!”

“However, don’t forget that there are only two months left until the Seven Peaks competition.”

“Don’t worry, Senior Brother Gongsun! We’ll remember it!” Ye Xuan, Gao Shun, and the others said in unison.

After that, the chiefs left.

As soon as Ye Xuan returned to Cloud Sky peak, he found that Zhuge Yueyue was already waiting for him in the courtyard.

“Teacher, since Sect Master called for an emergency meeting with all of the chiefs, could it be that he has found out the truth behind the berserk beasts’ attack?” Zhuge Yueyue asked nervously.

Had it not been for that incident, her parents would not have died. She had to take revenge!

Ye Xuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue and shook his head.

“The sect master’s emergency meeting is indeed related to the berserk beast attacks. However, we still haven’t found out the truth behind it.”

“My precious disciple, don’t be anxious. Once I have any clues, I will inform you immediately.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but feel a little disappointed.

However, Zhuge Yueyue quickly regained her senses.

Although this matter was important, cultivating was more important. Only with strength would she be able to exact her revenge. In addition, the Seven Peaks competition would soon begin. The most important thing now was to seize the time to cultivate.

Ye Xuan naturally noticed the change in Zhuge Yueyue’s expression and said with a smile, “Alright, Yueyue, go back and pack up. I’ll take you to the outside world tomorrow to investigate this matter.”

“You’ve reached the second-level of the divine mystic realm, and your comprehension of the Cloud Sky sword technique should have reached an acceptable level. It’s time for you to hone your combat experience.”

“Moreover, the berserk beast attacks have spread throughout the entire East continent. All of the holy lands have sent their talented disciples to the outside world to train.”

“You can also take this opportunity to see the strength of the geniuses of the various holy lands and broaden your horizons.”

“What? You’re really going to take me to the outside world tomorrow to gain experience?” Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes lit up when she heard this.

“Teacher, are you sure you’re not joking?”

“Little girl, when have I ever joked about such things?” Ye Xuan rolled his eyes at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Teacher, can I go and pack up immediately?”

“Go!” Ye Xuan smiled.

After that, Zhuge Yueyue returned to her room in excitement.

She could finally go to the outside world with her teacher.

Although her days with her teacher in the Great Wilderness Divine sect were very fulfilling, there was a knot in Zhuge Yueyue’s heart that had not been resolved. It was revenge for her parents.

Also, she wondered how her home, which had been destroyed by the berserk beasts, was doing now.

She packed her luggage in no time at all.

The next day.

Zhuge Yueyue had been waiting in the courtyard since early in the morning. When she saw Ye Xuan coming out, she quickly went up to him.

“Yueyue greets Teacher!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“En!”

Ye Xuan nodded.

He was dressed in white and had an elegant demeanor. He had his hands behind his back and his eyes were proudly standing in front of him, just like an immortal.
