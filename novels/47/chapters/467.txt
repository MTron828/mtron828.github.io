468 Special Reward Mechanism

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned around and walked toward Zhuge Yueyue.

Gao Shun’s emotions were in turmoil.

He knew in his heart that Ye Xuan’s open-mindedness was far beyond his.

He… He had already lost!

!!

For a hundred years, he had always wanted to prove that Hidden Sword peak was stronger than Cloud Sky peak, and just three months ago, everything seemed to have been progressing smoothly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, all of that had changed now.

Ye Xuan could have taken the opportunity to take revenge for the humiliation he had suffered in the past hundred years, but in the end, he chose mercy.

“Hahaha!”

Once he thought of this, Gao Shun laughed out loud with great enlightenment.

Only today did he realize how ridiculous his actions were. The bad blood between the two peaks had become his obsession. However, Ye Xuan had been completely unfazed by the whole thing.

Hahaha! How laughable, a hundred years of obsession was all for nothing.

“Tianyu, consume this recovery pill and stabilize your injuries. Don’t let your cultivation foundation be damaged!”

After resolving the knot in his heart, Gao Shun quickly gave the pill to Gao Tianyu.

After taking the pill, Gao Tianyu’s pale face eased up a lot as his injuries stabilized.

On the other side of the arena, Zhuge Yueyue also floated down from the sky with a pale face. Although she did not pass out, she staggered and fell into Ye Xuan’s arms.

Although the power of the hell slash was extremely terrifying, Zhuge Yueyue had not had enough time to master it. Thus, when she forcefully unleashed its power, it drained all of her spiritual power.

Ye Xuan carefully helped her up and took out a recovery pill.

“Hurry up and take this pill. Circulate its medicinal power through your body to heal your injuries.”

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue raised her pale face and nodded obediently. She swallowed the pill and immediately sat down to recover.

The battle was truly worthy of being the finals of the Seven Peaks competition. That last exchange between the two of them could be said to be earth-shattering.

Thankfully, although both of them were injured, it did not affect their cultivation foundations.

Gongsun Shouyue also went over to check on Zhuge Yueyue and Gao Tianyu briefly, and then nodded to the judge.

Seeing this, the judge quickly walked out.

“I hereby announce that the winner of this century’s Seven Peaks competition is… Cloud Sky peak’s Zhuge Yueyue!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd went wild and started cheering in unison.

“Oh my God! Cloud Sky peak is so awesome!”

“This is really a case of an underdog rising up. My heart almost jumped out of my chest just now…”

Among the countless spectators, Su Changhe’s face was filled with a happy smile as he screamed loudly without caring about his image.

From last place to first…

In the past 100 years, Cloud Sky peak had suffered countless humiliations. Now, thanks to Zhuge Yueyue’s victory, they had finally regained their former glory.

“Hahaha! Sister Yueyue is so awesome! I told you she could defeat Gao Tianyu!”

“Who else has something to say now? I’d like to see who dares to look down on Cloud Sky peak in the future!”

Su Changhe’s face was full of pride. His exaggerated expressions were simply ridiculous.

The cultivators around them were dumbfounded.

“Uh… Are you also a disciple of Cloud Sky peak? Why do I feel like you’re even more excited than they are?”

The corner of Su Changhe’s mouth twitched when he heard that. He glared at the cultivator.

“Why do you care? In any case, Cloud Sky peak is the most awesome!”

“Tsk! Do you think you’re Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple?”

The crowd gave Su Changhe the middle finger in disdain.

At the same time, in the arena, Gongsun Shouyue’s aged face revealed a gratified smile. His gaze fell on Ye Xuan as he chuckled.

“Congratulations, Junior Brother Ye! Cloud Sky peak is the victor of the Seven Peaks competition.”

“Hahaha! We were just lucky!”

Ye Xuan smiled, not feeling too proud.

At this moment, Gongsun Shouyue waved his sleeve, and a streak of light landed in front of Ye Xuan, then revealed the appearance of a storage ring.

Needless to say, this was the reward for the competition.

Although Ye Xuan’s expression remained calm, he was inwardly ecstatic as he examined the storage ring.

Sure enough! There was a divine fruit of the Great Dao within it. In addition, there were also many high-grade magic artifacts and pills.

From the looks of it, Gongsun Shouyue had really invested a lot into this century’s Seven Peaks competition. Perhaps he thought that Bai Xuanyuan would definitely win the competition.

Of course, although Gongsun Shouyue felt a little regretful, he would not go back on his word because of this.

Just as Ye Xuan put away the storage ring, a system notification suddenly rang out in his mind.

“Ding! As the host has given special healing pills to his disciple and a disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the host has received a 10,000x randomized critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained an immortal-grade pill, yellow soul divine pill! (Quantity: 10)”

“Eh? Why are there ten of them?”

“Ding! As the host has successfully triggered two critical rewards at once, one of them included a special reward mechanism that rewarded the host with an additional number of rewards.”

“The upgraded system is really different. It’s so fancy!”

...

Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

He did not expect that there would be a certain chance of triggering a special reward mechanism if he gave a treasure to his disciple and the disciple of the sect at the same time.

This was a win-win scenario. He could gain brownie points and rewards at the same time.

Ye Xuan immediately checked out the yellow soul divine pills.

“Yellow soul divine pill: An immortal-grade pill. It’s the highest-grade pill known to date. It’s extremely effective in restoring a cultivator’s body and cultivation foundation. As long as the cultivator’s soul has not completely dissipated, it can bring the dead back to life.”
