582 Earth Treasure Flower

It had to be said that Feng Lu was indeed quite rich. He had bid 1.9 billion taels of profound silver without even blinking.

Ye Xuan could not restrain his curiosity. He turned around and asked Feng Xiyun, “Are all the princes of the Yangli divine empire so rich?”

He heard Feng Xiyun mutter to herself for a moment before she said, “Every prince has his own territory, and Prince Zhanglu’s territory is Qingyang City.”

“The annual tax income from such a large city must be a terrifying number, so it’s not surprising that he’s rich.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan started thinking.

Based on this information, these mortal empires were indeed quite rich.

In comparison, as the chief of Cloud Sky peak, he could not even afford to pay several taels of profound silver back then. That being said, given his current status, making money seemed very easy.

As long as he put one of his treasures up for auction, he would be able to earn a fortune, especially with a rich person like this prince propping up the bids.

Ye Xuan even felt that this person was quite cute.

The next moment, his expression changed again. He glared at the prince and said, “I’ll bid 3 billion taels!”

From Ye Xuan’s appearance, it almost looked like he was exasperated and desperate.

Feng Lu laughed when he saw this.

‘Hmph! Small fries are indeed small fries! They are all so impatient!’

He laughed contemptuously and continued to bid.

“3.9 billion taels!”

He wanted to suppress Ye Xuan and humiliate him.

After seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled proudly.

Feng Lu finally came to his senses when he saw the smile.

“I’m finished. Was this guy trying to trick me?”

His expression darkened instantly. Seeing Ye Xuan’s smug smile, his heart was filled with anger.

He now knew that Ye Xuan was not after the auction item at all. He was just deliberately raising the price to spite him. Furious, he flipped the table and almost vomited blood.

“Damn it! I must know everything there is to know about this person!”

“How dare you trick me! I will teach you the meaning of the word regret!”

The second auction item was unsurprisingly won by Feng Lu for an exorbitant price of 3.9 billion taels of profound silver.

However, Feng Lu was not the slightest bit happy about it.

If Ye Xuan had not been here, with his status, he could definitely have gotten it for a much lower price.

After the two incidents, he was traumatized. He would not be fooled so easily the next time.

Ye Xuan leaned back into the chair, feeling happy.

“3.9 billion taels of profound silver… Hahaha!”

“This guy is really gullible.”

He suddenly felt a little guilty. He was not going to make this guy bankrupt, was he?

Cough, cough. Definitely not.

After all, Xiyun had just said that all of the princes were extremely wealthy.

All Ye Xuan had to do now was wait. Once the auction ended, he would receive a huge sum of money. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At that time, as long as he gave the money to his disciples, he would be able to reap another multiplied reward from the system.

However, the multiplier for the master-disciple system seemed to be lacking in comparison to the couple system. Would it be better to get Yuelun to be his girlfriend and give her the money instead?

It did seem rather feasible…

There were still different auction items on display on stage, but none of them caught Ye Xuan’s eye.

Finally, when the eighth auction item was brought out, something finally piqued his interest..

This was a blood-colored enchanting flower that was sealed in a crystal box. The auction hostess said, “This flower is called the earth treasure flower. It’s a middle-grade spiritual herb. Consuming it will cleanse one’s meridians and improve one’s level of talent. It can even increase one’s strength.”

“Earth treasure flower?”

Ye Xuan’s eyes were fixed on the flower, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Teacher, this flower doesn’t seem to be anything special. Why do you want it?” Zhuge Yueyue asked in confusion when she saw that Ye Xuan was about to bid for the flower.

After all, this flower was only a mid-grade spiritual herb. It might be precious to ordinary cultivators, but it was pretty much worthless to Ye Xuan.

Everything Ye Xuan had given his disciples was better and more precious than this flower.

However, what Zhuge Yueyue did not understand was that what Ye Xuan was really after was not the effects of the herb itself.

Ye Xuan took a sip of tea and slowly said, “If it’s just for consumption, its effects are indeed very ordinary. However, I’m not looking to consume it, but to refine pills with it.”

“Eh?”

This stunned his two disciples. Seeing this, Ye Xuan followed up quickly, “I once read an ancient book that recorded the refining process of an extremely magical pill called the feather transformation pill.”

“If one can obtain one of these pills, it was said that even a mortal can become an immortal.”

“I don’t know how much of what was recorded in that book is true, but I’ll probably find out after refining it.”

“It so happens that the main ingredient required to refine this pill is the earth treasure flower. The only problem is that the grade of this earth treasure flower doesn’t meet the requirements.”

“However, it should still be enough for me to refine a first-grade feather transformation pill.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were very excited. They said in unison, “Teacher, let’s bid for it quickly then!”
