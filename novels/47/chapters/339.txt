Immediately after, Shangguan Wan’er looked in Ye Xuan’s direction.

The two just so happened to lock gazes!

When she saw the smile on Ye Xuan’s lips, she suddenly felt a little annoyed.

This guy was doing this on purpose! He had clearly seen her naked, yet he still refused to admit it.

!!

When she thought of this, Shangguan Wan’er gritted her teeth in anger and frustration.

“My precious disciple, don’t you trust me? I really didn’t see anything! Is my precious disciple angry?”

“No I’m not,” Shangguan Wan’er said indifferently.

“Oh, I didn’t expect my precious disciple to have such a good temper. If someone else saw my naked body, I would definitely cut them into pieces.”

“Didn’t you say you didn’t see it?” Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were filled with a dangerous light.

“Ahem, ahem, ahem, I was just giving an example.”

“Ye Xuan!”

“Hmph!”

Shangguan Wan’er turned around, not wanting to talk to Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan thought she looked adorable while pouting, but decided to stop there. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Alright, my precious disciple, now that you’ve awakened your Undying Xuan Huang sword physique in your body, let me see how much your strength has grown,” Ye Xuan said seriously, trying to ease the awkward atmosphere.

“My precious disciple, I want to see your sword qi and determine how long it will take you to reach the level where you can wield the laws of the sword.”

“I’m powerful, you know, so I’ll give you a little demonstration. Perhaps you’ll be able to reach the tenth level of the sword profound pattern.”

Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“The laws of the sword?”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes lit up, and she ignored the fact that Ye Xuan was teasing her.

Truly a tsundere!

“Use your full strength to attack me. I want to see what shortcomings need to be fixed,” Ye Xuan said.

“Alright!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded, and the terrifying power in her body suddenly erupted.

She clenched her fist, and a divine sword suddenly appeared as he activated the sword profound pattern in her body. Dark yellow sword qi surged forth, threatening to engulf and destroy the surroundings.

Then, she slashed toward Ye Xuan, causing the torrent of sword qi to surge toward him.

“Ooh, although I said to use your full strength, I didn’t think you actually would. Are you trying to kill your teacher?”

“I’m only following Teacher’s instructions!”

“You’re trying to take revenge, aren;t you?”

“No, I’m not!”

“Oh really? Your attacks are getting fiercer and fiercer, yet you can still deny it with a straight face?”

“What nonsense are you spouting, Teacher? Even if I use my full strength, I won’t be able to harm you. Could it be that you’re afraid?”

“Oh dear, my disciple is really too terrifying. Does she really think I saw her naked? Is there a need to be so angry? At most all I did was peek!”

“Ye Xuan!”

When she heard this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were filled with shame and anger, and the divine sword in her hand released a terrifying black and yellow sword qi.

Each strike contained Shangguan Wan’er’s full strength.

Any ordinary pattern condensation realm expert would have died countless times over.

However, Ye Xuan simply extended his fingers slightly and easily blocked Shangguan Wan’er’s attacks, dissolving her sword qi.

“Ye Xuan, you’re such a b*stard!”

Shangguan Wan’er was enraged. A terrifying light burst forth from her body, and the sword qi that filled the sky shot toward Ye Xuan.

Clang!

Ye Xuan flicked his finger, and a powerful surge of energy suddenly hit her longsword.

Shangguan Wan’er’s expression changed. Her hand felt numb and she almost lost her grip on her sword.

Immediately, she swung a longsword, infusing it with perfect-level sword intent, stabbing toward Ye Xuan’s chest.

Ye Xuan smiled, and his left hand flashed and then firmly held Shangguan Wan’er’s wrist.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression froze, and she circulated her heavenly lightning intent, trying to break free from Ye Xuan’s grasp.

However, in the face of absolute power, all struggles were in vain.

Besides, the levels of her martial intents were lower than Ye Xuan’s.

Ye Xuan tugged slightly, causing her to lose her balance and stop her attack.
