455 Disparity

Looking at the sorry appearance of his disciples, Gao Shun became even more furious, to the point that he clutched his chest, almost having a heart attack.

Why were Ye Xuan’s disciples superior to his?

Did this not imply that he was not as good as Ye Xuan?

He had been the second-in-command in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and its law enforcement elder, yet now his Hidden Sword peak could not even compare to Cloud Sky peak, which ranked at the bottom of the list.

Was that not a joke?

“Teacher, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault for not being strong enough. I’ve embarrassed you and Hidden Sword peak. Please punish me.”

Yu Wuyuan dragged his body and knelt down in front of Gao Shun.

Compared to the proud and confident appearance from before, Yu Wuyuan’s face was filled with apprehension and nervousness.

After all, he was the one who boasted in front of Gao Shun that he would humiliate Ye Xuan’s disciple in the arena. However, he had been taught a cruel lesson and humiliated by the other party instead.

“Do you think that your apology will change anything?” Gao Shun’s expression turned even uglier.

Among the many disciples of Hidden Sword peak, Xiao Feng was silent.

Looking at his teacher’s furious face, he felt an inexplicable sense of disappointment. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Could it be that in his teacher’s eyes, the safety of the cultivators of Hidden Sword peak was less important than the reputation of Hidden Sword peak? Or Gao Shun’s reputation?

Compared to Cloud Sky peak and Chief Ye Xuan, the difference between the two was too great.

At the thought of this, Xiao Feng’s heart was full of regret. Why did he acknowledge Gao Shun as his master?

Gao Shun was livid and he was just about to curse more when Gao Tianyu appeared in a hurry.

He had defeated his opponent soundly just now, and had wanted to show off in front of everyone, but then news of his father fainting from anger reached his ears.

Helplessly, Gao Tianyu put aside his plans to show off and hurriedly rushed over.

Looking at his father sitting there, Gao Tianyu felt relieved.

“Father, how’s your condition? Do you feel any discomfort?”

When Gao Shun saw Gao Tianyu appear, his fury abated somewhat, and he said with a bitter expression, “Tianyu, today my reputation and the reputation of Hidden Sword peak suffered.”

“You didn’t see Ye Xuan’s arrogant and proud appearance just now. It really made me angry!”

“From now on, I’m afraid that Hidden Sword peak will be the butt of jokes among the cultivators of the sect.”

Gao Tianyu quickly comforted him, “Father, don’t worry. The Seven Peaks competition is not over yet. Nothing is set in stone!”

“I’ll definitely take revenge for the humiliation you’ve suffered today!”

When Gao Shun heard this, he felt consoled.

As expected! The most reliable person was still his precious son! He should not have placed his hope on these trashy disciples.

“Your words put my heart at ease, Tianyu.”

“The dignity of Hidden Sword peak is now in your hands.”

“Don’t worry, Father. I won’t let you down,” Gao Tianyu said with a gloomy expression.

Ye Xuan humiliating Gao Shun like this was undoubtedly a humiliation for him as well.

How could he tolerate such hatred?

‘Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan… just you wait!’

Looking at his precious son’s firm and confident expression, Gao Shun nodded his head in satisfaction. He then looked at those disciples kneeling in front of him and immediately became angry.

“You pieces of trash! Go and reflect on your mistakes!”

“Think about it. As a disciple of Hidden Sword peak, why can’t you defeat a single Cloud Sky peak disciple?”

At this moment, Gao Shun was in a fit of fury, so everyone just scuttled away obediently.

Then, Gao Shun looked at Gao Tianyu and said with a serious expression, “Tianyu, although you are an eighth-level materialization realm cultivator, you can’t let your guard down!”

“Today, Cloud Sky peak’s Zhuge Yueyue was able to severely injure Yu Wuyuan with a single kick. That girl’s strength can not be underestimated!”

“I can vaguely sense that this girl has at least reached the sixth level of the materialization realm.”

Although Zhuge Yueyue did not reveal her cultivation level, the aura that she revealed when attacking still gave Gao Shun clues about her strength.

Gao Tianyu squinted his eyes.

“Father, do you think that a little girl who has only cultivated for three months can surpass me?”

“It’s hard to say. Although Cloud Sky peak is ranked at the bottom of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, no one can guarantee that Tian Xuan did not leave any precious treasures behind.”

“Furthermore, Ye Xuan won’t hesitate to give such treasures to his disciples. He was willing to give his second disciple the precious bone of a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast.”

Thinking this, Gao Shun felt some regret in his heart.

Why was he so impulsive back then? Why did he agree to the bet with Ye Xuan?

That guy was a wolf in sheep’s clothing. No one knew what surprises he had in store until the last moment.

He had thought that Ye Xuan was nothing more than a lucky piece of trash who had inherited Cloud Sky peak. However, the tables were turned on him now.

The other party had been secretly hiding his cultivation for a hundred years, and he had not noticed it at all.

Was he not the clown in this case?
