All in all, over the past 20 days, almost everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect had been cultivating and improving themselves.

“It’s almost time…”

Looking at the busy scene not far away, Ye Xuan turned around and said to his three disciples, “Today is the day of the gathering, and it is also a test for you. Whether you can get a good ranking will depend on whether or not you have worked hard during this time.”

“If you really want to be famous, you have to focus on the strongest people and fight them. That way, you can easily be known by the whole world.”

“Even if you can’t win, no one will say anything. Instead, they will praise you for your courage.”

After all, the gathering did not have any restrictions on who you could challenge.

Hearing this, the three girls said confidently, “Teacher, don’t worry. We’ll definitely get a good ranking and make Cloud Sky peak famous!

Xiang Yun was the happiest of the three, and started bouncing up and down and said, “Charge, charge, charge! I’m the invincible girl of my generation! No one can take my title away!”

Hearing these words, Feng Xiyun hurriedly grabbed her small hand tightly. Otherwise, she would have run to god-knows-where in the next moment.

“Alright, let’s go.”

As soon as his words fell, Ye Xuan turned to leave with them.

Just as Ye Xuan and the other three left Cloud Sky peak, they met the team from Hidden Sword peak, who were also departing for the gathering.

The one in the lead was Gao Shun. His face was full of smiles and he looked very happy.

Gao Tianyu was standing behind him, but so was another young man, Xieo Feng.

“Oh? He’s reached the materialization realm?”

Ye Xuan was quite surprised to see this.

Still, Xiao Feng was a cultivator with a divine bone, so it was normal for him to improve rapidly.

Taking a closer look, it was clear to Ye Xuan that Xiao Feng would not take long to break through to the void realm. Of course, Zhuge Yueyue was leagues ahead of him, but it was still an admirable achievement given the fact that he had nearly been abandoned and left to his own devices to cultivate.

It seemed that he had only made a certain breakthrough in these 20 days, which was probably the reason for Gao Shun’s happiness.

Looking at them, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Senior Brother Gao, you seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen?”

“Hehe, Junior Brother Ye, it’s no big deal.”

Gao Shun replied with a smile, but as he spoke, he revealed his supreme realm aura.

Obviously, he was deliberately revealing it to Ye Xuan and pretending to be ignorant.

After noticing this, Ye Xuan’s face twitched a few times.

“Haha! Congratulations, Senior Brother Gao! You’ve finally reached the supreme realm! Not bad!”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Gao Shun said very humbly, “Ahem, this is just an insignificant matter. There’s no need to make a fuss over it.”

Upon hearing this, everyone present revealed a surprised expression.

Breaking through to the supreme realm was considered an insignificant thing?

Those from Hidden Sword peak were all feeling proud and arrogant thanks to their chief’s achievement. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this time, Ye Xuan just smiled and did not say anything. He just briefly released his peak-level supreme realm aura, which caused them to retreat, and some of them even fell on their butts.

Ye Xuan said in embarrassment, “Oh dear, how could I be so careless? Quickly get up…”

“I’m really sorry. After all, I’ve only reached the peak of the supreme realm not long ago, so I’m not that proficient in controlling my power. It was an accident.”

When Gao Shun sensed Ye Xuan’s aura, he was shocked.

Holy f*ck!

How did this fellow do it?

He had not broken through long ago, yet had already reached the peak of the supreme realm?

Was he on drugs or steroids?

Gao Shun thought he had narrowed the gap between them, but it seemed that it had only gotten wider. Furthermore, his own achievement had been overshadowed by Ye Xuan’s.

F*ck!

Gao shun’s face was already like black charcoal. He should not have shown off in front of Ye Xuan.

In any case, there were many cultivators at the gathering. That would be a better place to show off without running the risk of being one-upped.

Ye Xuan was full of surprises, so there was no telling what secrets he would suddenly reveal to blow everyone away.
