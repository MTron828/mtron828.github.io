670 Activating Berserk Mode (Part 1)

Ye Xuan smiled stupidly to himself. At this time, Ao Lei arrived at his side. His eyes were glued to the screen in the sky, and there was nothing but shock in his eyes.

Even though he had long known that this little girl was the reincarnation of an expert, seeing it for himself was still quite shocking.

“Junior Brother Ye, the background of this disciple you accepted is really great…”

“We should take measures to ensure her safety, as she will definitely become a future pillar of the sect. She has the potential to become the Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

Ao Lei said this from the bottom of his heart. The Great Wilderness Divine sect was similar to the Jade Lake Divine sect as they usually appointed a saintess, like the Reincarnation Fairy.

However, they had not done so for many years as no one had been qualified for the position. Xiang Yun was definitely worthy though, so Ao Lei was very excited.

After hearing his words, Ye Xuan quickly interjected.

“Senior Brother Ao, actually, Xiang Yun is not the saintess of the Great Wilderness God Sect. There’s someone else.”

“Oh?”

After hearing this, Ao Lei, Gao Shun, and Yuelun were all stunned.

“Who?”

The saintess was considered one of the top figures of the sect. How could they not know if they had one?

Ye Xuan said calmly, “I’ve told you before that there’s another Great Wilderness Divine sect in the Heaven continent.”

“Someone there has already been appointed as the saintess.”

They revealed looks of shock and admiration.

To be able to become a goddess, just how monstrous was this person?

“Hehe, not bad. Even the heavens are looking after our Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

Inside the ancient realm, Xiang Yun was about to commence an intense battle.

When the energy in her body was stimulated, the entire sky was covered in dark clouds, giving everyone around her a great sense of oppression.

Even Feng Xiyun’s face turned pale when she saw the fairy-like figure emerging from Xiang Yun’s body.

“Third Sister…”

Then, she suddenly recalled what her teacher had said to her at that time.

Xiang Yun’s body contained an immense amount of energy. If it was released, then the power she could exhibit was unfathomable.

Her worries dissipated. Originally, she felt that he was destined to be eliminated today, but her third sister had suddenly revealed such great power.

Sigh, now even her junior sister was more powerful than she was. Was this not rather embarrassing?

‘Oh well… There’s no need to take it to heart,’ she thought to herself. Was it not good to be protected by others?

She did not like to fight anyway, and only stepped onto the path of cultivation only to change her fate. Rather than becoming the strongest expert, she would much rather refine pills.

Xiang Yun was floating in the air holding her hammer aloft. Bolts of lightning flashed around her, and she looked like a god of war, invincible and powerful.

Although Feng Xiyun had already recovered to her peak condition, she did not choose to stand up. Instead, she pretended to lay weakly on the ground.

Since her junior sister’s power had been incited by the fact that she had been injured, it was best to stay put. Feng Xiyun suddenly wondered if she pretended to be heavily injured, would her junior sister go berserk?

Thinking this, Feng Xiyun acted cunningly and forced herself to cough out a mouthful of blood.

“Puchi…”

After doing all this, Feng Xiyun immediately pretended to be weak.

When the others saw this scene, they immediately had a premonition that things were about to take a turn for the worse. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Second Sister!”

Xiang Yun’s eyes immediately turned bloodshot as she shouted in concern.

At this moment, the illusory figure condensed again as Xiang Yun flew into a rage and stared fiercely at the Supreme Divine sect’s cultivators.

“All of you will die!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she swung her hammer fiercely. It was as if a storm had descended from the sky!

“F*ck…”

At this moment, everyone finally knew they were in deep sh*t. They no longer had the chance to escape…
