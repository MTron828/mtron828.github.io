315 Deadlocked Battle

“Sea Flood Dragon, don’t be so arrogant!”

Seeing this, Huo Bodong’s eyes turned slightly cold. Heavenly fire that could burn everything surrounded his body as he once again transformed into a huge fire dragon. A terrifying pillar of fire spewed out of the huge dragon’s mouth.

The two sides once again engaged in a fierce battle, but neither could defeat the other.

The other King realm experts were in the same situation.

Among these four King realm experts, two were from the Divine Gate Holy Land. Other than Huo Bodong, the other one was from the Shadow Tower.

The Shadow Tower was a super faction on the same level as the Fire God Palace in the Huangyu Zone, and its leader was called Bai Long.

It was not a flood dragon that was fighting Bai Long, but a special tribe among the sea race, a member of the Yaksha tribe.

The Yaksha King realm expert took on a human form, but his appearance was extremely ghastly, like a ghost.

The trident in the Yaksha’s hand blossomed with a dazzling light. The Yaksha had engraved a profound pattern derived from wind intent. No matter how hard he tried, Bai Long could not touch the Yaksha.

Over the course of the past few years, Bai Long had been suppressed by Yaksha, which frustrated him to no end. In fact, he barely even wanted to fight anymore. Bai Long possessed a profound pattern that was derived from shadow intent. It allowed him to hide in the shadows, which should have given him an advantage in the darkness of the spatial turbulence.

Unfortunately, his opponent was too fast. Still, both sides were unable to harm each other.

“Damn it! I don’t believe that there’s no other hidden King realm experts in the Huangyu Zone!”

“They should step out and fight for the human race!”

Bai Long cursed out of irritation. Most of the stronger King realm experts had gone to the Tianze Zone to help out, leaving the Human King realm experts behind to guard the Huangyu Zone.

When the sea race split off some of their forces to attack the Huangyu Zone, these Human King realm experts were the ones tasked with holding the line.

That being said, they knew that there were other hidden King realm experts who were busy cultivating in seclusion in the Huangyu Zone.

These experts were all cultivation maniacs who only pursued cultivation and paid no attention to the outside world. They were definitely top-notch existences, perhaps even Heavenly King realm experts.

If even one of them emerged, this situation would have been resolved by now, but not a single one had shown up.

“A bunch of old geezers who only know how to cultivate! If the Huangyu Zone is occupied by the sea race, these useless guys would probably just go to another region to cultivate!”

Thinking this, Bai Long’s heart was filled with displeasure.

He originally did not want to participate in the war with the sea race, but the situation had forced him to do so, and he felt helpless.

Hu!

At this moment, a powerful gust of wind suddenly blew past the space where he was hiding.

Before the trident’s terrifying attack even reached Bai Long, he could sense the power it contained.

Penetration intent!

It was able to concentrate all of the power in the body into a single point and unleash incredibly strong attacks that not only harmed the target’s physical body, but their soul as well.

Fortunately, Bai Long’s shadow intent also had powerful defensive properties, so he was not afraid of the other party’s penetration intent.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The trident was swung continuously, furiously attacking Bai Long’s body, creating many holes in it. However, Bai Long quickly fused with the space around him, and his body instantly recovered.

This scene had repeated itself many times over the course of the battle between the two. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Detestable! When will this end?”

“If I had the Tower of Heaven, I would’ve killed this Yaksha a long time ago. Why did it have to end up in the hands of a pattern condensation realm cultivator? What a waste!”

Bai Long’s face was full of dissatisfaction.

He was one of the King realm experts who had sent subordinates to try and snatch Ye Xuan’s Tower of Heaven.

Although Ye Xuan’s powerful display of strength had worried them, as well as the possibility of there being an almighty expert behind him, they still secretly coveted the Tower of Heaven.

Now that close to seven years had passed, and no retribution had materialized, the apprehension in their hearts dissipated significantly.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The eight King realm experts were engaged in a frenzied battle.

Other than Huo Bodong from the Fire God Palace and Bai Long from the Shadow Tower, the other two King realm experts from the Divine Gate Holy Land were Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian, who were sword cultivators.

Incomparably dazzling sword qi soared into the sky, causing the entire world to lose its color. One of the sword strikes tore through space slashed toward the flood dragon, while the other slashed toward the Yaksha.

Seeing this, the flood dragon’s expression suddenly changed. He transformed into his huge flood dragon body, and his sharp dragon teeth immediately shattered the sword qi.

As for the Yaksha, the trident in his hand blossomed with a holy light, shattering the sword qi with a single strike.

“It seems that you humans can’t hold on any longer! Do you want to end the battle quickly?”

The Yaksha’s mouth curved into a cold smile as he looked at Jun Moyu and Jun Feitian with a mocking expression.

There were two Yakshas and two flood dragons among the sea race’s experts.
