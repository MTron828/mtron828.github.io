Chapter 91: Monster!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

Chen Xiaofeng took a step forward as his surging true essence power swept out.

Ninth level of the true essence realm!

“He has reached such a realm at such a young age. It’s no wonder he is a genius of the Qingyun sect!”

The first elder of the Huolie sect stroked his beard and commented with a smile.

“What a pity! His opponent is even stronger!”

Seeing this, the elder of the Shenshan sect responded with a smile.

Boom!

An even more powerful force swept out, and wisps of purple spiritual power soared into the sky!

What? Purple spirit realm?

When Chen Xiaofeng saw this, his expression changed.

He had not expected this fellow to reach the purple spirit realm one step ahead of him!

Other than the Shenshan sect cultivators, the eyes of the Huolie and Qingyun sect cultivators displayed their shock! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

First level of the purple spirit realm!

Although his cultivation level was not high, he was still a genuine purple spirit realm cultivator!

When was the last time a purple spirit realm cultivator appeared in the competition between the three great sects? It had been ages since that happened!

However, they now knew very well that Chen Xiaofeng would definitely lose this battle!

Their talents were evenly matched. However, the gap between the purple spirit realm and the true essence realm was like a natural chasm. How could he overcome it?

“You can’t win! Surrender!”

The eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect looked at Chen Xiaofeng indifferently. He did not regard Chen Xiaofeng as his opponent at all!

This guy was so arrogant!

However, when they thought about the strength of the other party, they felt that it was warranted.

Even if the other party had not reached the purple spirit realm, even if he was only at the tenth level of the true essence realm, Chen Xiaofeng would still be unable to defeat him.

“Let’s fight and find out!”

Seeing this, Chen Xiaofeng gritted his teeth. His pride would not allow him to admit defeat.

The next second, the longsword in his hand released dazzling sword qi as it slashed towards the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect.

As the eldest disciple of the Qingyun sect, how could he lose without a fight?

Even if he lost in the end, he had to protect the dignity of the Qingyun sect at all costs.

“How can an ant shake a tree?”

Seeing this, the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect shook his head with disdain. He slowly clenched his right hand, and wisps of purple spiritual power swept out.

Moments later, his five fingers formed a fist, and a purple fist suddenly appeared and flew toward Chen Xiaofeng.

A purple spirit realm expert was extremely terrifying. With just one punch, he heavily injured Chen Xiaofeng, smashing him into the defensive array.

Boom!

Pfft!

Chen Xiaofeng’s hand, which was holding the longsword, trembled involuntarily. Streams of blood flowed from his palm, and his face had turned extremely pale. He could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

With just one punch, he had been defeated!

Moreover, his opponent had not used his full strength. Otherwise, this punch could have killed him.

At the thought of this, Chen Xiaofeng revealed a desolate expression.

Half a month ago, when he was fighting against Li Qingyan, this had been the case too. He almost died from her Windstorm Slash. Now, he had also almost been killed by the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect!

What the f*ck is going on? Why are there so many monsters? Why can I not keep up with them?

“Although it’s cruel, this is reality!”

The eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect looked at Chen Xiaofeng indifferently.

Although there was no sarcasm in his words, his eyes were full of contempt.

“Hehe, your strength is indeed terrifying, but you may not be able to win the competition!” Chen Xiaofeng used the longsword in his hand to support himself as he got up off the ground with difficulty. He stood up and wiped the blood from his lower lip.

“Is it because of that Li Qingyan?”

Seeing this, the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect raised his eyebrows slightly and then revealed a smile.

“Even if Li Qingyan’s strength is as you said, even if she is able to unleash the strength of a purple spirit realm cultivator, she is still not an actual purple spirit realm cultivator. Do you think that she will actually be able to defeat me?”

“The strength of the purple spirit realm is not something you can imagine. Only after you have truly entered the purple spirit realm will you truly understand it!”

The eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect smiled faintly. He first looked at Chen Xiaofeng, then his gaze fell on the many cultivators of the Qingyun sect.

He naturally knew that the move that Li Qingyan used in the Qingyun sect competition already possessed the power of the purple spirit realm cultivator.

However, it was not her own power. In the end, it was only one attack. He was a true first level purple spirit realm cultivator. How could a true essence realm cultivator compare to him?

Even his casual attacks contained an extremely powerful purple spiritual power. No matter how powerful Li Qingyan’s martial technique was, it could not be used continuously, right?

Seeing this, Chen Xiaofeng turned silent.

The other party was indeed a true first-level purple spirit realm cultivator. Although Li Qingyan’s attack would probably injure him, it was too difficult for her to defeat this guy.

“I have an inexplicable desire to see Senior Sister Li Qingyan chop him up with her sword!”

“Exactly, this guy is asking for a beating. Look at his arrogant expression. I really want to slap him!”

“But what can we do? After all, the other party only stated a fact. Although senior sister Li Qingyan can temporarily unleash the strength of a purple spirit realm cultivator, she is only a true essence realm cultivator in the end!”

“That’s right. The gap between the purple spirit realm and the true essence realm is like a natural chasm. It’s too difficult to cross!”

“I just can’t stand this guy’s arrogance. What’s there to be proud of? Isn’t it just the first level of the purple spirit realm? Can his talent be compared to Elder Ye Xuan?”

“Hehe, throughout the entire Great Qian Dynasty, which genius can be compared to Elder Ye Xuan?”

“He has only reached the first level of the purple spirit realm at the age of 19. Isn’t that embarrassing? Elder Ye Xuan reached the core formation realm at the age of 20!”

“That’s right. Based on this guy’s achievements, he’s not even worthy of carrying Elder Ye Xuan’s shoes!”

“In terms of strength, perhaps this guy is currently the strongest, but in terms of talent and age, Elder Ye Xuan’s disciple definitely has you beaten, okay? Although they are only true essence realm cultivators, that’s because they are younger than you!”

“That’s right! If they were your age, Senior Sister Yue and Senior Sister Li Qingyan would definitely crush you!”

At this moment, many cultivators of the Qingyun sect were furiously arguing.

This guy was too arrogant. Although there was no mockery on the surface, the contempt contained in his words and expression was extremely clear.

Were it not for the fact that they could not beat him, they would have ran up to the stage to give him a slap.

When the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect heard their words, his face turned purple.

He had not expected the disciples of the Qingyun sect to be so vicious with their words!

At the age of 19, he had already reached the first level of the purple spirit realm. He was already a super genius in the Great Qian Dynasty!

As long as nothing unexpected happened, he would definitely be able to advance to the core formation realm in the future.

Even the current him, after revealing his identity and strength, would be able to command awe and respect, especially in those more ordinary cities and sects, where they would treat him like their ancestor and worship him.

However, in the eyes of this group of cultivators from the Qingyun sect, he was a worthless person. Furthermore, he could not refute their words!

Ye Xuan, this guy, was too monstrous! Ye Xuan was a monstrous existence that suppressed all of the genius cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty.

In addition, in the eyes of the Qingyun sect cultivators, it seemed that Ye Xuan’s disciples were even more monstrous than him.

One had reached the sixth level of the true essence realm before she was 15, and the other had reached the ninth level of the true essence realm before the age of 18!

In comparison, he had only been a qi transformation realm cultivator at the age of 14.

‘So it seems that I am not as monstrous as others!’
