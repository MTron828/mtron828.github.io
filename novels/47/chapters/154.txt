Chapter 155: The Jade Token Was Used

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Thank you, Teacher. Thank you so much!”

“My mother will be saved now!”

Zhao Yuyan took the pill excitedly. Her pink cheeks were full of tears of gratitude.

She was only a seven-year-old little girl, but to cure her mother’s illness, she entered the mystic realm alone. This was enough to show how important her mother was to her.

If she had not met Ye Xuan, she probably would not have found any spiritual herbs. In fact, she might not have even survived the mystic realm!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Spirit Burst flower, the host has received a randomized 30x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Worried Cloud grass!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Fire Cloud fruit, the host has received a randomized 36x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Blood Red fruit!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple increase her innate bone value by 6 points, the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations, the host has obtained 18 innate bone value points!”

…

At the same time, the sound of system notifications continuously rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

Ye Xuan had taken out many treasures that could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value and comprehension value. He then helped Zhao Yuyan refine them to gain a series of rewards from the system.

…

Zhao Yuyan

Comprehension value: 601

Innate bone value: 627

Ye Xuan

Comprehension value: 529

Innate bone value: 616

…

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s innate bone value also exceeded 600 points. However, Ye Xuan discovered a very crucial problem.

As long as the rewards were related to innate bone value and comprehension value, the multipliers were very low.

This became even more obvious after his innate bone value and comprehension value exceeded 500 points. Still, what did it matter? All he had to do was raise the innate bone values and comprehension values of his disciples more frequently.

‘Hmm, I still need to give this girl more trump cards to be safe,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple an offensive jade token (third level of the unity realm), the host has received a randomized 11x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained an offensive jade token (fourth level of the unity realm)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a speed-boosting jade token (second level of the unity realm), the host has received a randomized 10x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a speed-boosting jade token (third level of the unity realm)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a protective jade token (third level of the unity realm), the host has received a randomized 4x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a protective jade token (third level of the unity realm)!”

Ye Xuan received another round of rewards from the system.

The biggest surprise was undoubtedly the offensive jade token. He had actually obtained a jade token that possessed the power of a fourth-level unity realm expert.

“These three jade tokens are the biggest trump cards I’m giving you. If you encounter an enemy that even your demon beast mount cannot defeat, you can use these three trump cards. Got it, Yan’er?”

Ye Xuan said to Zhao Yuyan.

“Okay, Teacher, I will remember that!”

Zhao Yuyan nodded very seriously.

“Okay!”

Ye Xuan smiled.

Now that everything that should be given had been given, he hoped that this girl would be able to keep herself safe after leaving the mystic realm.

Ye Xuan thought for a moment, then waved his sleeve. Several marks suddenly appeared on Zhao Yuyan’s body. These marks would conceal the latter’s aura, disguising her cultivation level as someone who had only reached the second level of the refinement realm.

In this way, the girl’s senior sisters would not discover anything unusual about her too early, which would save her a lot of trouble.

At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly sensed a strange gaze.

Huang Ling, who was beside them, had watched all this with her mouth agape. Her eyes were filled with concealed bitterness.

There was nothing she could do!

Comparing people was really infuriating!

Elder Ye Xuan was too amazing. He was practically a human-shaped treasure vault!

He had given many treasures that even core formation realm experts would covet to Zhao Yuyan.

She felt that if she stayed by Elder Ye Xuan’s side for too long, she would really go crazy. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Huang Ling, come here!”

Ye Xuan saw the change in Huang Ling’s expression and chuckled. He then motioned for her to come over.

Seeing this, Huang Ling’s heart skipped a beat, and she immediately walked up to Ye Xuan somewhat expectantly.

Ye Xuan smiled, and then pointed his index finger at the latter’s forehead, imparting the windstorm slash and aura concealing techniques to her.

“You must practice well in the future,” Ye Xuan said.

“Thank you, Elder Ye Xuan!”

“Junior will definitely not disappoint Elder Ye Xuan’s expectations!”

Huang Ling’s body trembled.

She did not expect that she would gain something by staying by Elder Ye Xuan’s side. This was definitely a great opportunity!

However, Ye Xuan did not care too much about this. He had originally planned to choose some martial techniques and cultivation methods and give them to the Qingyun sect, especially the aura concealing technique.

“Everything is settled. Let’s go to the Heavenly Lightning Pool!”

However, just as he was about to leave with the two, a resplendent sword qi suddenly flashed not far away.

The resplendent sword qi bloomed with incomparably mysterious blood-red patterns and was suffused with a terrifying aura.

“A unity realm expert?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but narrow his eyes.

“Wait, this is…”

When his spiritual sense locked on to the aura of the sword qi, he was stunned.

He was very familiar with this aura for no other reason than that it was his own!

“Wait here for a while. Don’t move!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

The reason why his sword qi had suddenly appeared was very simple. Someone had used one of the jade tokens he had refined.

He had only refined three jade tokens, and all three were with Yue.

In other words, Ah Yue had been forced to use her trump card!

The speed-boosting jade token emitted a divine light, which then wrapped around Yue as she flew through the sky like a meteor. However, she looked extremely wretched as she fled frantically.

Xiu!

The divine light had transformed into a pair of wings that enhanced her speed.

“Damn it! Right now, there’s only the protective jade token left. If this fellow catches up to me, should I use the protective jade token or hand over the treasure?”

Sensing the terrifying aura behind her, Yue gritted her teeth. Her eyes were filled with unwillingness!
