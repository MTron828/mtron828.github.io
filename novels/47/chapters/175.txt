Chapter 176: Li Qingyan’s Ranking

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Time passed slowly and, soon enough, a full hour had passed…

That cultivator had barely reached the 37th level.

“It seems that his speed gradually decreased after the 30th level. Could it be that the level of difficulty suddenly increased there?”

“It’s very possible. It seems that the 30th level is a watershed!”

When everyone saw this scene, they were shocked.

Just as that cultivator broke through past the 37th level, he was also sent out by the Tower of Heaven.

He clutched his chest with a pale face, and the aura around his body flickered faintly.

“How is this possible? I actually didn’t even last 10 seconds on the 38th level…”

That cultivator stood motionless, his eyes filled with disbelief.

On the 38th level, he had faced an illusory phantom. However, the other party had only relied on a single move to severely injure him. If he had not crushed the jade token in time, perhaps…

“Hehe, now do you believe what I said?”

Gongsun Yao revealed a disdainful smile when she saw this.

The cultivator did not speak, but his eyes were filled with fear.

The trials in the Tower of Heaven were all illusory phantoms condensed from pure energy, and the way they attacked was extremely mysterious.

When he stepped into the 38th level, the illusory phantom he had faced was only at the eighth level of the purple spirit realm, yet a single move almost killed him, who was at the tenth level of the purple spirit realm.

That was simply terrifying!

“Alright! It’s time for me to go up and give it a go!”

At this moment, Jian Tiannan was filled with confidence.

This was not his first time entering the Tower of Heaven. It was just that he did not obtain any outstanding results previously.

However, this time was different. He had already made sufficient preparations. He had to get on the combat power rankings! Even if it was only at the bottom of the rankings!

“Jian Tiannan… Is this guy finally going to make a move?”

“It is said that he successfully reached the 51st level previously. I wonder if he will be able to reach the 60th level this time?”

“I think it is very likely. After all, four years have passed and his strength has undergone a huge change…”

…

When they heard that Jian Tiannan was going to enter the Tower of Heaven, everyone’s attention was piqued.

After all, this guy was ranked fifth on the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings, and he was a top-tier expert.

Not far away, Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan also revealed curious expressions.

They also wanted to see what kind of outstanding performance this person would display.

Jian Tiannan moved quickly, and soon reached the 30th level.

“Jian Tiannan, Actual Age: 35, Nanzhou Region, Myriad Swords Temple!”

At the same time, Jian Tiannan’s ranking on the huge screen rose quickly.

Moreover, after he reached the 30th level, his speed did not decrease but instead increased.

“This fellow is so strong!”

When the previous tenth-level purple spirit realm cultivator saw this, he shuddered. Was this the terrifying gap between them?

As someone who had just experienced the trials, he naturally knew very clearly how terrifying the difficulty level was after one reached the 30th level of the Tower of Heaven.

However, that fellow Jian Tiannan did not stop at all. Very quickly, he arrived at the 40th level.

Shortly after, Jian Tiannan broke through to the 50th level. He only paused for a moment before reaching the 51st level.

“This guy has already reached the 51st level!”

Among all the cultivators who had challenged the trials, Jian Tiannan was the first to reach the 50th level.

However, once he reached the 50th level, the difficulty of the Tower of Heaven’s trials increased again, Jian Tiannan gradually slowed down.

Finally, after Jian Tiannan stepped into the 57th level, the speck of light that belonged to him suddenly extinguished, and he was immediately sent out by the Tower of Heaven.

Although he had reached the 57th level, because he had not successfully cleared the trial, he could only be considered to have completed the 56th level.

Hu!

Jian Tiannan wiped off the blood dripping from the corners of his mouth, and raised his head to look at the Combat Power rankings.

However… the rankings on the Combat Power rankings did not change.

How could this be?

When Jian Tiannan saw this, his expression changed, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

He had already stepped into the 56th level, yet was still not qualified to be ranked on the Combat Power rankings?

The last-ranked person on the Combat Power rankings had also reached the 56th level. However, based on the judgment of the Tower of Heaven, that person was stronger than he was.

Jian Tiannan’s heart was filled with unwillingness.

He was already 35 years old, yet had failed to enter the Combat Power rankings. He did not have a chance to enter the qualifications rankings either, which had even more stringent requirements.

“Yaoyao, let’s go too!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Not far away, Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan were surprised.

They had not expected that Jian Tiannan would fail to enter the Combat Power rankings.

However, it only meant that Jian Tiannan was not strong enough. After all, anyone who could enter the Combat Power rankings was basically a true genius.

“Okay, Sister!”

Gongsun Yao said with a smile.

When the two of them were about to enter the Tower of Heaven when the screen suddenly rippled.

At the same time, there was a commotion.

“Oh my God! There’s been a change in the qualifications rankings!”

“Li Qingyan? Who Is Li Qingyan? She’s actually on the qualifications rankings!”

“What? Qualifications rankings?”

Gongsun Wan and Gongsun Yao’s expressions changed when they heard this.

The two rankings of the Tower of Heaven represented strength and talent respectively. Anyone who could make it onto the list was a peerless genius.

Just now, the War God Hall had tested the actual ages of all of the cultivators. Among the 20 million or so cultivators who had entered the Tower of Heaven earlier, not a single one managed to make it onto a list.

Even Jian Tiannan, who was ranked fifth on the South Sky list, did not have the qualifications to make it onto the Combat Power rankings.

However, at this moment, the qualifications rankings had suddenly changed.

The list suddenly lit up with dazzling golden light, after which, a row of small but conspicuous words appeared.

“25,462th place: Li Qingyan, Actual Age: 16, 40 levels, Nanzhou Region, Qingyun Sect!”
