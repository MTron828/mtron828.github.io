513 Gao Shun’s Stance

Facing Gao Shun’s provocation, Daoist Hei Tie could only forcefully suppress his anger and gnash his teeth as he spoke, “Alright! Today’s matter is our loss!”

“Gao Shun, let me give you a piece of advice. In the future, you will definitely regret what you have done today. Our Supreme Divine sect will not be humiliated like this!”

“What a joke! Then let me tell you today. I don’t know the meaning of the word regret!”

After a very contemptuous reply, Gao Shun continued, “Daoist Hei Tie, if you really cannot hold it in anymore, why don’t we spar?”

!!

“Your sect only knows how to bully juniors. Has the Supreme Divine sect always been like this? What a joke! Simply shameless! You’re an affront to the dignity of all cultivators!”

How could Daoist Hei Tie endure such an insult? He felt something sweet in his throat and immediately spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Damn it!”

Daoist Hei Tie knew that he was in the wrong this time. He wiped the blood from his mouth and looked at Han Tai and Xie Tianyu, “”Let’s go back!”

If he stayed here, he would simply be asking to be humiliated even more.

Originally, he did want to teach Gao shun a good lesson, but thinking about it carefully, even if he won, he would not gain much.

After all, his status and seniority were higher than Gao Shun. If he won, it was still fine, but if he lost or came out even, he would be the one on the losing end in terms of reputation.

It was because of this that, no matter how angry he was, he had to endure it.

Gao Shun’s words just now had already thoroughly ignited the fury in his heart, but there was nothing he could do about it.

Xie Tianyu had lost, then Han Tai had also lost. It really was too embarrassing. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“You’re really a coward!”

After seeing the Supreme Divine sect’s forces leave, Gao Shun spoke those words contemptuously.

This matter had come to an end, and the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had also escaped this crisis.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Gao Shun with a complicated expression. After a long while, she spoke.

“This matter was resolved all thanks to you, Martial Uncle Gao.”

Zhuge Yueyue thanked him very sincerely. Feng Xiyun also hurriedly came forward to express her gratitude.

However, his reply made everyone amused. They did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Gao Shun replied, somewhat pridefully, “Tsk, don’t think too much about. I just didn’t like those Supreme Divine sect cultivators. Especially that disgusting old man who tried to bully you. How shameless!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gao Shun turned around and left.

Seeing this scene, the group of people felt an inexplicable smile.

“I really didn’t expect that Martial Uncle Gao would actually be like that,” Feng Xiyun flicked her hair and continued to speak, “Wasn’t he here to help us? Why does he have to pretend like he wasn’t?”

As Gao Shun had saved many disciples from this predicament, his image underwent a certain change among them.

Most of the disciples were confused, and did not understand why he had chosen to help Zhuge Yueyue. In Gao Shun’s heart, he would gladly help, but would never admit to that.

It was for this reason that he had found a lame excuse.

With Gao Shun around, the nearby cultivators did not dare to mess with the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Li Hanyi was relieved by this, and walked over to Gao Shun and bowed.

“Hanyi greets Martial Uncle Gao.”

Gao Shun looked at her and asked, “Where did your master go? Shouldn’t she be with you?”

Gao Shun was rather confused. If Yuelun had been present, he would not have needed to interfere in the matter just now. It was not just Yuelun… Why was Ye Xuan not here either?

In any case, this was what he owed Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan had given his son that special healing pill back then, which allowed his son to recover from his injuries. Otherwise, it was likely that his son would have suffered from qi deviation.

Thinking this, Gao Shun said in his heart, “It’s just a small favor. It’s what I should do. That’s all. When we meet in the future, our debts will be cleared.”

After Li Hanyi heard Gao Shun’s question, she thought for a moment before answering, “Martial Uncle Gao, my master has already entered the ancient tomb. She hasn’t returned yet.”

After hearing this, Gao Shun was stunned. Why would Yuelun enter the ancient tomb?

“Could something have happened? Otherwise, why would Yuelun be in such a hurry to enter the ancient tomb?”

“Besides, the ancient tomb isn’t fully open yet. If she’s not careful, she’ll encounter danger. Why didn’t you try to persuade her?”

Gao Shun said unhappily.

Hearing this, Li Hanyi was also worried. She lowered her head and said in a soft voice, “That’s because Martial Uncle Ye has also already entered to pursue the heaven devouring divine sparrow.”

“After my master found out about this, she told us to wait here and went in to look for Martial Uncle Ye.”

“What?”

Gao Shun’s face turned black all of a sudden as he said unhappily, “Does that fellow not treasure his own life?”

“Before we left, Senior Brother Gongsun reminded us to call for assistance and join forces if we encountered the heaven devouring divine sparrow.”

“Yet he was audacious enough to go after it alone?”

Gao Shun’s expression darkened, and was hesitating over and over again whether or not to go in and help.

“Forget it. Since I’ve already helped him once, I might as well go the distance…”

“After helping him this time, I won’t owe Ye Xuan any more favors.”

Thinking this, Gao Shun instructed Li Hanyi.

“You guys stay here and wait for news. Don’t wander off. Chief Dahai should be here soon.”
