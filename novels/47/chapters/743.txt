744 Taking A Stand!

After everyone was seated, Ao Lei returned to his seat and said, “Everyone, today is the day our Great Wilderness Divine sects will recruit disciples. Moreover, the entrance assessment has already begun at the entrance.”

“In a moment, the arrangements will be explained to you and you will help the other elders to test the prospective disciples.”

“Also, the peaks should assign disciples to pay close attention to the situation and send people to patrol the surroundings to prevent possible problems.”

“After all, the East continent is full of dangers now. A disaster might strike at any next moment.”

“When we are recruiting disciples, we absolutely cannot allow any untoward situation to occur.”

!!

After hearing Ao Lei’s words, everyone responded in unison, “Understood!”

Everyone’s expressions turned unprecedentedly solemn. After all, they were very clear about the situation in the outside world.

It was precisely for this reason that they had to maintain 120% vigilance during the recruitment period to prevent any disaster from happening.

“Alright, go make your preparations.”

Then, he gestured for the elders to get going. Only the chiefs of the various peaks remained in the main hall.

After seeing that even the elders had left, Zhuge Yueyue quickly turned to Feng Xiyun and asked her to bring Xiang Yun out first.

She still had to stay here and listen to what other instructions there were.

Once they left, Ao Lei turned around and said to them, “Everyone, you should already know what happened a few days ago, right?”

“In the desert region, a terrifying skeleton has started to cause trouble everywhere.”

After saying this, his expression turned ugly, and he said, “I’ve already instructed our people to keep us abreast of the news in the outside world. The desert region has now become filled with that strange power.”

“I’m afraid that it won’t be long before we have to welcome a fierce battle.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hearing this, the atmosphere was tense and silent, and thoughts began to run wild.

If even the grand elder was worried, things were dire.

“The various empires have already asked us for help. They want us to help build a line of defense and cooperate with their soldiers to resist the attack of the beasts in order to . This way, we can better protect the people.”

“What do you think about this matter?”

Hearing this, everyone lowered their heads and fell into deep thought. They did not immediately answer.

With a disaster looming, if they did not pitch in to help, the ordinary folk would be doomed.

However, if they stepped forward to help, then the sect would probably face a huge crisis. If they were not careful, it might even be destroyed.

Up until now, the various other sects and forces did not display any intention of helping. Each and every one of them remained silent and hidden.

After all, they all knew that they were at risk of destruction in this situation as well. How could they help others?

Not long ago, the Supreme Divine sect had completely closed themselves off and announced that they would no longer recruit disciples at this time.

Perhaps it had something to do with their showing at the gathering, but to not even try to recruit disciples was unusual.

However, although the Supreme Divine sect’s method of handling the matter seemed to be rash, it was also the wisest way to deal with the impending disaster.

After learning of this incident, many small forces and sects chose to do the same. Only the other major sects were going ahead with their disciple recruitment efforts.

After hearing Ao Lei’s question, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but clench her fists.

She was also very hesitant at this moment. She really wanted to stand up and speak out, but she forcefully suppressed that desire.

She understood the feeling of being abandoned better than anyone else. It was because of the beast invasion that she had lost her home.

Now that this incident was about to repeat itself, if the major sects did not intervene, the ordinary people in the outside world would most certainly end up as food for these berserk beasts.

As much as she wanted the sect to step up, this was only considering her past experience. She could not jeopardize the fate of Cloud Sky peak and the Great Wilderness Divine sect just because of that.

However, at this moment, Gao Shun spoke up.

He stood up with a determined expression and said, “Senior Brother Ao, since the establishment of our Great Wilderness Divine sect, we have always been thinking for the common people and been responsible for guarding their safety.”

“It’s also because of this that our sect enjoys popularity with the common folk.”

“Now that the commoners are facing a catastrophe, if we decide to leave them alone, this will not be in line with the tenets our sect was established upon.”

“Therefore, our Great Wilderness Divine sect must stand up bravely this time!”

At this moment, everyone looked at Gao Sheng with admiration.
