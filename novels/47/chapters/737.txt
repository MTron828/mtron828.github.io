738 Inner Demon

When he sensed that Ye Xuan had actually broken through to the ancient realm, Daoist Yi Feng felt conflicted.

He fell into deep thought. After a long while, he said with a bitter smile, “Brother Tian Xuan, your disciple has already completed what you failed to do…”

After saying this, he looked in the direction of Cloud Sky peak in a daze.

“Your dream has already been completed, but I can’t…”

He recalled the series of events that had happened back then. He had been so proud and arrogant back then. Together with Tian Xuan, he had been able to travel freely in the outside world. No one had dared to stop him.

However, that time of past glory was long gone. Now, only he was left alone and lonely.

If it was not for the inner demon in his heart, he could have become the first expert in the Great Wilderness Divine sect to reach the ancient realm with his talent.

However, it was a pity that an accident had occurred in the desert region back then, causing his talent to wither.

Under the influence of the inner demon, he could only guard the main peak alone, allowing the years to pass, and his cultivation could not improve at all.

“Martial Uncle Yi Feng, should we go out and congratulate Ye Xuan?”

Just as Daoist Master Yi Feng was feeling sad, an elder came forward.

Usually, these elders and him would stay in the secret room to cultivate and would not show their faces. They were the trump cards of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

If the Great Wilderness Divine sect was not facing a crisis of extinction, they would never take action.

Daoist Master Yi Feng looked in the direction of Cloud Sky peak again. After seeing that the black clouds had dispersed, he said, “It’s not necessary. Now that the Great Wilderness Divine sect has found its pillar of support, we should remain behind the scenes.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Hearing this, the elders’ hearts trembled, and their expressions were complicated.

They usually stayed beside Daoist Yi Feng to cultivate, so they knew very well what Martial Uncle Yi Feng was hiding in his heart.

“Sigh…”

After seeing this scene, an elder could not help but sigh. He originally wanted to persuade Daoist Yi Feng, but after a moment, he fell silent.

Back then, even Chief Tian Xuan could not resolve Daoist Yi Feng’s inner demon. How could they do it with just a few words?

If they really wanted to blame someone, then they had to blame the heavens for cursing him.

If that incident had not happened in the desert region, then this once brilliant genius would not have wasted away his days like this.

On the other side, an even more powerful aura appeared in the sky. A mark appeared in the sky that instantly released a shocking amount of energy.

“What’s going on?”

However, when their bodies came into contact with the energy, they immediately sat cross-legged on the spot and began to absorb the energy.

This energy naturally came from Ye Xuan’s immortal heavenly treasure, the Chaos Immortal Peach. This was also something that Ye Xuan had unintentionally emitted.

“Hurry up and start cultivating! This is something that Martial Uncle Ye is bestowing upon us!”

At this moment, everyone was extremely excited. This was truly a shower of blessings! They had not expected to benefit directly from Ye Xuan’s breakthrough.

As time passed, all of the sect’s cultivators more or less experienced some improvement in the cultivation.

Ye Xuan slowly opened his eyes.

‘Haha, you guys can absorb this energy to your heart’s content. After that, it will be my turn to benefit.’

Although the energy leaking out had been unintentional at first, Ye Xuan was now deliberately emitting it in order to obtain the system’s rewards…

If this succeeded, the critical reward he would receive would probably be mind-blowing!

“F*ck! I wanna be a member of the Great Wilderness Divine sect too…”

“I wish I could absorb that energy…”

Watching this scene, those people outside the Great Wilderness Divine sect could only watch with jealousy and admiration.

Thanks to the sect’s defensive formation, the energy was confined inside the sect.

“I don’t know if you guys have noticed, but when I absorbed this energy, it seemed to give me a feeling of clarity, and stabilized my mental and emotional state,” a disciple said this with a shocked expression.

After hearing this, everyone turned pale with fright. Eh? Could this energy help them deal with inner demons? It sounded too good to be true.

“Hold on, if it can stabilize mental and emotional states, will it work on that strange power?”

At this moment, everyone became excited. After all, the crisis was all due to that strange power. If this energy could restrain it, then they would gain an advantage in battle.

“Enough chit-chat! Focus and take advantage of this opportunity to absorb more,” Gao Shun rebuked them. He too was seated cross-legged and absorbing this energy.

After receiving his admonishment, everyone settled down and focused on absorbing as much of the energy as they could.
