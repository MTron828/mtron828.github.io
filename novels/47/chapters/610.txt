611 Holy Land For Cultivation (Part 3)

Could it be that Ye Xuan had given her the chiliad gold vine sapling without hesitation back then because he had this tree?

Yuelun was suspicious, but Ye Xuan’s answer dispelled her concerns.

“I obtained this water cloud fruit tree from the true ancient tomb. I spent a lot of effort excavating it.”

“Oh, no wonder….” Yuelun said, as if she had suddenly realized something.

Ye Xuan had given her the chiliad gold vine sapling before he entered the gate to the true ancient tomb. It all made sense then.

After all, she could not enter the true ancient tomb due to her lacking cultivation level at the time.

Of course, Ye Xuan was just making up an excuse. If Yuelun were to find out that the water cloud fruit tree sapling was the system’s reward due to him having given her the chiliad gold vine sapling, she would probably be angry.

What happened to the sweet love she had believed in? Did he just want to use her for treasures?

She would probably be heartbroken.

Completely unaware of this, Yuelun was thinking, ‘No matter what, I’m still very important to Junior Brother Ye.’

“Congratulations, Junior Brother Ye. With the help of this tree, everyone on Cloud Sky peak will be able to advance very quickly.”

“Perhaps when the fruits are ready to be picked, you might even be able to break through and reach the sealed immortal realm,” Yuelun said with a face full of smiles.

However, she was feeling a little sad in her heart. Even though she had already reached the peak of the mystic lord realm, the gap between her and Ye Xuan was getting bigger and bigger.

At this rate, it would not take long before she was left in the dust.

Would she really have a chance then?

At this moment, Yuelun felt very bitter.

However, when she recalled the chiliad gold vine seedling, her heart was filled with hope again.

She would not be able to catch up to his cultivation level, but with the seedling, she would not remain too far behind.

“The sealed immortal realm is still a little far away for me,” Ye Xuan replied cordially.

Even though this water cloud fruit was amazing, it would take too long to ripen.

With the help of the system, Ye Xuan probably would not need that long to break through to the sealed immortal realm.

It was precisely for this reason that Ye Xuan had planted it for his disciples, as they would be the ones benefiting.

Furthermore, he had obtained plenty of resources from the destruction of the Immortal Divine sect, and would have no problem reaching the peak of the ancient realm after refining them.

Ye Xuan had originally planned to cultivate and break through to the ancient realm as soon as he returned to Cloud Sky peak.

However, for other reasons, and because the gathering was about to commence, this matter was put on hold.

Before going to the gathering, Ye Xuan’s main objective was to help Xiang Yun lay a solid cultivation foundation.

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at the water cloud fruit tree in the middle of the garden again, his heart filled with excitement.

With the help of this tree, from now on, Cloud Sky peak would be the best place to cultivate.

In addition, his disciples’ cultivation speed would also be much faster than the others.

Ye Xuan inadvertently touched the trunk of the water cloud fruit tree again, causing small green buds to instantly emerge.

When this happened, a wave of even denser spiritual energy swept out.

“F*ck!”

All of the cultivators present were once again shocked.

With a series of muffled sounds, some of the cultivators actually broke through!

“Woah! I’ve actually reached the materialization realm, hahaha!”

“I’ve gotten stronger?”

After hearing this, the people present were even more shocked. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, everyone instantly quieted down and sat cross-legged on the spot. They wanted to take advantage of this moment and improve their cultivation.

Xiang Yun was unhappy when she saw the cultivators sitting on the ground. She tugged at Zhuge Yueyue’s sleeve and said, “Big Sister, our water cloud fruit tree is being exploited by these people. Will it affect our tree?”

Zhuge Yueyue patted her head and consoled her, “It’s fine. This time is special. A spiritual energy wave like this will happen fairly often in the future, so you don’t need to worry.”

“That’s good,” Xiang Yun nodded and replied. Since Cold Sister said that it would not affect the tree, she would not chase these people away.

At this moment, Hua Rufeng hurriedly came to Ao Lei’s side and whispered something into the latter’s ears.

After hearing Hua Rufeng’s words, Ao Lei’s face instantly darkened. Seeing that the disciples were all focused on cultivation, he quietly left.

Gao Shun also noticed this, and his expression froze, wondering what exactly had happened to make Ao Lei’s expression become so ugly.

On the other side, Ye Xuan was still transferring spiritual power to the water cloud fruit tree to help it grow.

Because the fruit tree had just been transplanted, it still needed some time to recover, which was why Ye Xuan was so careful in taking care of it.

After helping the water cloud fruit tree grow new roots, Ye Xuan retracted his spiritual power, and he sighed with relief.

‘This water cloud fruit tree seems to have a lot of growth requirements in terms of geography and nutrients. It’s really not easy to take care of it.’

‘I’ll have to find some treasures in the future to improve the soil quality here,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan realized that Hua Rufeng was actually right behind him. He was almost startled and asked subconsciously, “Oh? Rufeng, do you have something to tell me?”

Hua Rufeng was also stunned at the moment. He had been completely distracted by the water cloud fruit tree.
