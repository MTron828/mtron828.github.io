829 Golden-Furred Growler (Part 4)

“Which b*stard taught this monkey? How could his teacher not have taught him such an important thing?”

“At such an important moment, this monkey actually spared the enemy?”

“Both the teacher and the disciple are fools!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s face trembled slightly.

It felt like Gao Shun was insulting him in a roundabout way.

Ye Xuan involuntarily glanced at Gao Shun coldly.

After sensing this gaze, Gao Shun felt somewhat panicked, but was also confused.

“Junior Brother Ye, did I say something wrong? Why are you staring at me like this?”

It was not as if he was talking about him, right?

Ye Xuan also felt very embarrassed at this moment, but he forcefully endured it. Saying anything stupid now would only reveal his relationship with Wu Kong.

Thus, he had to mentally disassociate himself from the identity of Daoist Ling.

When the monkey reappeared out of the mouth of the golden-furred growler, everyone already knew that he was going to be in trouble.

Wu Kong had just come out, and had not even said anything yet when he sensed cold killing intent wash over him.

He turned around and saw that the golden-furred growler was baring its teeth at him.

“You damned monkey, you’re really good!”

“Ever since I was born, you’re the first to force me into this state.”

“I’m going to repay you a hundredfold for this pain!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As soon as he finished speaking, the golden-furred growler released all of his power.

Whoa!

His aura reached the peak of the heaven realm!

At this moment, many people in the East continent felt bad for Wu Kong, who had also realized the mistake he had made. He had not expected the golden-furred growler that had been begging for mercy to immediately turn hostile immediately after being spared.

Sensing the towering spiritual pressure released by the golden-furred growler, the little monkey did the first thing that came to mind.

Wu Kong smiled, rolled his eyes, and then said, “My teacher told me that if I’m not confident in winning, it’s better to run away first.”

“As such, I won’t be accompanying you any longer. Goodbye!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the little monkey instantly slipped away with a swoosh and disappeared into the horizon.

People were still waiting for the climax, so when they realized what had just happened, they were all stunned.

Who taught this monkey? Why was this monkey both foolish and shameless?

He was very arrogant when he could fight, but when he realized that he was no match for the other party, he instantly ran away?

Gao Shun was also gnashing his teeth in hatred at this time.

“This stinky monkey, after stirring up trouble, he turned tail and ran away. Does he expect us to clean up for him?”

“Which expert taught this disciple? He should show himself right now!”

Even the golden-furred growler was dumbfounded.

“F*ck!”

He had endured the humiliation for so long just now because he wanted to properly deal with this monkey, but the moment he revealed his full power, the monkey actually ran away!

In that case, on whom should he vent his anger?

“You stinky monkey, come back here! Are all of you East continent people clowns?”

After hearing this, the East continent onlookers were incensed.

This ignorant golden-furred growler actually dared to say such presumptuous words?

“F*ck, that monkey might be scared, but I’m not! I’ll deal with you!”

Someone could no longer hold himself back and rushed toward the sky.

This attracted everyone’s attention.

“Who is it?”

“Who is so brave to take action while that golden-furred growler?”

When everyone finally figured out who it was, they were speechless.

“Isn’t this the same person who was beaten up by Xiang Yun?””

“Sigh… Forget it, forget it. Let’s go. There’s nothing to see here.”

Yun Hai originally thought that if he chose to take action bravely at this moment, he would definitely be able to charm thousands of girls.

However, all he received were looks of disdain, and people started to disperse.

“My god! Can’t you at least show me some respect and watch for a while?”

Was he really that bad?

Although he was indeed defeated by Xiang Yun not too long ago, countless other people had suffered the same fate, right?

As for Ye Xuan, while he was surprised by the fact that this person was also a middle-stage heaven realm cultivator, he also felt that the East continent’s situation was too bad. At the very least, there were some geniuses.

Among the newly risen juniors, there were very few who could reach this level, aside from those like Zhuge Yueyue, Mu Beichen, the Reincarnation Fairy, and some others.

For example, Xie Tianyu from the Supreme Divine sect was in a rather miserable state. Because of the many twists and turns he had experienced, he was still at the peak of the void realm.

“This is interesting. Let’s see how he will deal with it.”
