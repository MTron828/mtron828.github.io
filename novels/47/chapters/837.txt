Zhuge Yueyue’s face turned pale. At this moment, she felt as if she was being stared at by the Grim Reaper.

A moment later, a figure stepped in front of her, much to her relief.

She had never been afraid of death, but she did not want to die young. However, if she were to face death with her teacher, that would still be acceptable.

“Haha, this is interesting.”

After saying this coldly, Ye Xuan instantly performed several hand seals, releasing a majestic power that negated the attack released by the other party.

After dealing with this attack, Ye Xuan stretched his back and said calmly.

“Is that all you have? Pitifully weak.”

“Say that again if you have the guts!” The figure in the sky roared angrily.

He had never expected that he would be mocked by such a lowly creature after trying to teach him a lesson.

“Okay. I’ll say it again. You’re really pitifully weak!”

Ye Xuan had sufficient confidence in his own abilities after reaching the sealed immortal realm. Heavenly Dao World? So what?

Staring straight at the shadowy figure in the sky, Ye Xuan assumed a battle stance. Seeing this, the expert laughed. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Haha!”

“Not bad. Time flies. I don’t know how long it has been since I last saw someone as arrogant as you.”

“You’re really bold. When I was rampaging through the various worlds, you probably weren’t even born yet. How dare you insult me like this!”

“Sealed immortal realm? I can destroy you with just a wave of my hand! I’ll teach you the true meaning of strength!”

The shadowy figure was in a bad mood. This shadowy figure was not his main body, and only contained a part of his power. After all, this world could not accommodate his main body.

At this moment, he instantly released a powerful aura that pressed down on Ye Xuan. At first, it made Ye Xuan feel very uncomfortable. However, he adapted to it after some time.

He was pondering the matter, as the shadowy figure had not actually entered the East continent, so he could not really do anything to this person. He had to drag this person in somehow.

As he thought about it, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up.

Moments later, the Godsword appeared in his right hand, and he released his sword aura, dyeing the sky blood-red.

Ye Xuan slowly said, “I am invincible, so why should I fear others?”

“If you have the guts, then come here and fight!”

Ye Xuan quietly hovered in the sky, waiting for the enemy to enter. He knew that experts who had reached the Heavenly Dao World were all extremely proud, and would not stand for anyone looking down on them.

He was proven correct moments later. No sooner than he had finished speaking, a long saber came flying his way!

“Damn it! How dare a little ant shout at an elephant!”

This person seemed to believe that this attack would be enough to deal with Ye Xuan, but the long saber was easily grabbed in mid-air by Ye Xuan.

“Is that all?”

Everyone was shocked.

“Oh my god, he blocked such a terrifying killing move so easily?”

“Just how terrifying is Ye Xuan?”

“If he’s this strong, does it mean that he can challenge the top experts from the outside world?”

In everyone’s hearts, these unattainable peerless experts were god-like existences. However, Ye Xuan had shattered that belief today.

They all felt invigorated by Ye Xuan’s actions. If he could challenge those experts, then if they cultivated diligently, they would eventually be able to as well!

In the sky, the shadowy figure could also sense that the living beings below no longer held him in veneration, which filled his heart with monstrous anger.

If he did not kill Ye Xuan today, perhaps he would never be able to redeem himself.

In the blink of an eye, he flew in and unleashed his powerful aura. After noticing this, everyone looked up, flustered, but also with anticipation. Would Ye Xuan be able to defeat this shadowy figure and back up his words?
