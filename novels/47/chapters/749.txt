750 Internal Unrest

The decision to close the sect’s doors was made by his teacher, Daoist Gu Hao. However, this one wrong step would now make them the laughingstock of both the cultivation and the mortal world.

Even if they did survive this disaster, if everyone else did as well, the only thing awaiting them would be shame and disgust.

Who would even consider joining the Supreme Divine sect in the future? Not only were they suffering from the shame of their defeat at the gathering, but now whoever was part of their sect would be branded cowards.

Seeing Daoist Black Iron’s angry expression, the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect could only tread lightly.

Among this crowd of disciples, Han Tai was watching this whole situation unfold with an evil smile on his face. Could he somehow capitalize on this situation to enact revenge on Daoist Black Iron?

!!

Then, while Daoist Black Iron was throwing a tantrum, Daoist Gu Hao suddenly appeared.

Upon seeing his arrival, all the disciples hurriedly greeted him, as did Daoist Black Iron, “Teacher, why did you end your secluded cultivation so quickly?”

Although he hated Daoist Gu Hao, he had to greet him politely out of courtesy. However, Daoist Gu Hao did not reciprocate the greeting. After all, he had already heard Daoist Black Iron’s scolding just now.

“If I didn’t end my secluded-door cultivation, won’t you have torn the Supreme Divine sect apart?” Daoist Gu Hao replied moodily.

This made Daoist Black Iron’s expression darken even more.

Xie Tianyu, who was standing beside Daoist Black Iron, clenched his fists tightly when he saw his teacher being treated like this.

As a genius, how could he not understand that his grandmaster was dissatisfied with his teacher?

If it was not for the sake of their relationship, the grandmaster would have already given the position of sect master to his new disciple, Li Hong, despite the latter being weaker than Daoist Black Iron.

Originally, Xie Tianyu was unaware of the rift between the two, and even thought highly of his grandmaster. After all, the latter had actually taught him a heaven-grade divine power.

However, after he found out the truth, he despised his grandmaster, who he believed had only taught him this heaven-grade divine power in order to obtain a portion of fate energy if he became champion of the gathering.

Once he lost to Zhuge Yueyue though, he was completely disregarded by Daoist Gu Hao. As for Daoist Black Iron, he could only suppress his anger in his heart. After all, conflict with his teacher now would only worsen the Supreme Divine sect’s situation.

Compared to other sects and forces, the atmosphere in the Supreme Divine sect was almost suffocating.

It was as if a fight would break out at any moment.

Daoist Black Iron sometimes wondered what he had done wrong to deserve this treatment from Daoist Gu Hao. What he did not realize was that his other disciple, Han Tai, was also his enemy after being abandoned by the sect back then.

Daoist Gu Hao said to everyone coldly, “I also understand that some of you may be very dissatisfied with my actions.”

“However, I can tell you clearly now. As long as we are able to overcome this crisis, you will definitely be grateful to me.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“After all, even a supreme realm expert might find things dangerous in this crisis, much less you ants below the mystic lord realm.”

“If you really want to keep your lives, then listen to my orders and completely seal off the Supreme Divine sect. No one is allowed to enter or leave.”

“Not only that, we have to strengthen the patrols around the sect. We can’t allow the slightest error to slip past.”

After hearing this, everyone hurriedly nodded and did not dare to say another word.

At this moment, they didn’t know whether they should obey Daoist Black Iron or Daoist Gu Hao. Seeing this, Daoist Black Iron felt gratified that he still had the support of some of the sect members.

However, judging from the current situation, it was not appropriate to fall out with Daoist Gu Hao, so he said, “I’ll heed Teacher’s instructions.”

Hearing this, the others present also spoke up, “We will also heed Grandmaster Gu Hao’s instructions.”

After hearing these words, Daoist Gu Hao became a little unhappy. He looked at Daoist Black Iron with disdain.

He did not expect that his good-for-nothing disciple actually had so many loyal followers.

In that case, it would not be so easy for him to deal with his disciple as he had hoped.

“Ha…”

“Let’s put this matter behind us. You guys should behave yourselves and just stay put.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Gu Hao turned to leave.

After watching Daoist Gu Hao leave, Daoist Black Iron’s expression instantly turned cold. He glared fiercely at him and Li Hong.

“Teacher?” Xie Tianyu quickly came forward and asked.
