402 Additional Reward Function

At this moment, night was slowly approaching.

Ye Xuan thought for a moment and said, “It’s getting late, so we’ll set up camp here. I’ll come up with a new training plan for you tomorrow.”

“Xiyun, today I will teach you the Heaven Burning Flame technique. It’s a black-rank technique, and it was created by the first chief of Cloud Sky peak!”

“It just so happens that you have the power of fire in your body, so this technique is suitable for you.”

“Yes, Teacher!”

!!

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s face was all smiles.

She could finally learn a divine power!

Over the past few days, Feng Xiyun had been watching Zhuge Yueyue kill the beasts with her longsword in envy.

However, because Feng Xiyun had broken through too quickly, Ye Xuan had prioritized the stabilization of her cultivation foundation, and had held back on teaching her a divine power until now.

“Girl, come and sit down!”

Zhuge Yueyue and Xin’er walked away quietly, not bothering the two of them.

Within a short while, Ye Xuan had passed on the Heaven Burning Flame technique to Feng Xiyun.

Even though Feng Xiyun did not have eidetic memory like Zhuge Yueyue, her comprehension ability was still extremely high.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple a black-rank divine power, the Heaven Burning Flame technique, the host has received a randomized 100x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the heaven-rank divine power, Hellfire!”

‘Heaven-rank divine power, Hellfire?’

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

After the system notification ended, his mind was filled with insights about the technique. However, Ye Xuan was a little disappointed.

Although the divine power was extremely powerful, it was still inferior to the Flora Sword technique.

Moreover, he did not have fire attribute power in his body. Even if he comprehended it with the help of the system, its power would not be satisfactory.

However, if he were to impart the Hellfire technique to Feng Xiyun, its power would be extraordinary.

After all, Feng Xiyun had a fire-attribute divine bone, and a high-grade one at that, which would allow her to unleash its full power. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

That being said, if he taught it to her now, he would miss out on the system’s reward.

Ye Xuan pondered the matter for a moment, before turning to Feng Xiyun.

“Little girl! I’ve just remembered that there’s a more powerful divine power that might be suitable for you. I’ll teach it to you now.”

Feng Xiyun was momentarily stunned.

‘I wonder what divine power Teacher is going to teach me…’

In her opinion, the Heaven Burning Flame technique that Ye Xuan taught her was already extremely powerful. How powerful would a stronger divine power be?

Ye Xuan smiled.

“I’m going to teach you the Hellfire technique.”

“Eh? Hellfire?”

Feng Xiyun was shocked.

She had heard about this divine power before.

A general of the Yangli divine empire had once mentioned that the power of the Hellfire technique was extremely terrifying, and that it was at least a heaven-rank divine power.

Was she actually going to learn this legendary divine power?

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Feng Xiyun almost jumped up in excitement.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan couldn’t help but smile.

“Don’t get too excited, little girl. The Hellfire technique is powerful, but it’s also very difficult to cultivate.”

“However, if you can master this divine power, you will be able to unleash its incredible power.”

“Don’t worry, Teacher. I’ll definitely train hard in the future!”

Ye Xuan nodded. Then, he stretched out his hand and gently touched Feng Xiyun’s forehead.

The knowledge regarding the Hellfire technique instantly entered Feng Xiyun’s mind. It gradually condensed into a rune that was filled with the power of fire.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun’s face was filled with excitement.

The divine power that her teacher had imparted to her was truly a heaven-rank one. However, it was far too profound, and was not easy to master.

That being said, the Heaven Burning Flame technique would become a foundational technique. Once she successfully cultivated it, it would become easier for her to cultivate the Hellfire technique in the future.

She would also be aided by her fire-attribute divine bone.

Immediately after, Feng Xiyun closed her eyes and slowly comprehended the profundity of the Hellfire technique.

Moments later, her eyes suddenly opened, revealing resplendent flames in the depths of her eyes, while layers of flames covered her body. She seemed to look somewhat like a phoenix.

When Zhuge Yueyue and Xin’er saw this, they were shocked.

‘I didn’t think that Junior Sister would be able to release such a powerful aura despite only cultivating this for the first time.’

Even though she was a materialization realm cultivator, Zhuge Yueyue could sense a trace of danger from the flames.

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes briefly flashed with disappointment.

She was Ye Xuan’s first disciple, and it had taken her two months to break through to the materialization realm, yet her junior sister was rapidly catching up within the span of a few days, and would soon have the strength to match hers.

Ye Xuan naturally noticed the disappointment in Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes.

Sigh! Being a teacher was truly difficult. He had to be fair in imparting divine powers, but unfortunately, he did not have an ice-attribute divine power to give her.

What should he do?

However, at this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As this is the first time that the host has taught his disciple a heaven-rank divine power, the system’s reward function has been triggered! (Note: This reward is limited to a divine power of the same rank.)”

“What?” Seeing this, Ye Xuan was stunned.

There was a different kind of reward function aside from the usual critical rewards? Was this an additional hidden function after the system upgrade?

However, from the system’s explanation, it seemed that the reward for this function was limited to the same rank, and the probability of triggering it was not fixed. It was completely random.

Still, it was an unexpected surprise.
