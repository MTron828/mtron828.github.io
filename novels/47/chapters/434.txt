435 Roar!

“Alright, then I’ll take my leave first, Martial Uncle Ye.”

Hua Rufeng bowed to Ye Xuan with respect.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded.

After Hua Rufeng’s departure, Cloud Sky peak returned to its usual peaceful state.

!!

However, Ye Xuan knew very well that the news of his sudden breakthrough and cultivation of an immortal-grade divine power would definitely spread throughout the sect.

Of course, he was not bothered by this.

After everyone had left, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun walked over.

Feng Xiyun looked in the direction of Hidden Sword peak and said, “Teacher, why do I feel that Martial Uncle Gao is targeting our Cloud Sky peak? Are there grudges between our peaks?”

As a newcomer, Feng Xiyun was naturally unaware of this. Still, she could sense the malice in Gao Shun’s actions and words.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“A long time ago, the relationship between the chiefs of Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak was not very good. However, in every generation, the Hidden Sword peak would be crushed by our Cloud Sky peak!”

“That’s why Gao Shun sees us as his number one enemy.”

“When my teacher, Tian Xuan, was still alive, he did not dare to go too far. However, Cloud Sky peak declined after my teacher passed away, so for the past hundred years or so, he’s been suppressing Cloud Sky peak.”

“Actually, his goal is very simple. He just wants to break the ugly record of Hidden Sword peak being suppressed by Cloud Sky peak and prove that Hidden Sword peak is the strongest peak in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, realization dawned on her. It seemed that this was something important to take note of, especially for the Seven Peaks competition.

She felt slightly pressured.

From what Ye Xuan had said just now, the chiefs of Cloud Sky peak had never lost to the chiefs of Hidden Sword peak. Thus, she felt pressured to live up to the same expectations.

“Therefore, you two girls have to work hard. Even if you lose to others, you can’t be defeated by the disciples of Hidden Sword peak. Otherwise, Gao Shun will probably harp on it forever,” Ye Xuan said.

Of course, these were just words he said to scare the two girls.

With him and the awesome system, how could they lose to Hidden Sword peak?

“Don’t worry, Teacher. We’ll work hard in our cultivation and won’t bring shame to Cloud Sky peak!”

The two of them looked at each other and saw the determination in each other’s eyes.

They now had divine powers and divine bones. As long as they continued training and stabilizing their cultivation foundation, they would become stronger and more prepared for the competition.

By Ye Xuan’s estimation, Feng Xiyun would most likely break through to the ninth stage of the divine mystic realm before the Seven Peaks competition.

Furthermore, this was just a conservative estimate.

If she worked harder, she might even be able to reach the materialization realm.

After all, the precious bone that this little girl had absorbed was left behind by a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast. It contained vast amounts of spiritual energy.

As for Zhuge Yueyue, she had already stabilized her cultivation level at the second level of the materialization realm.

Now that she had a junior sister, she was working even harder at her cultivation, and was on the verge of breaking through to the third level of the materialization realm.

…

Hidden Sword peak.

The moment Gao Shun returned to his residence, he exploded with anger and smashed the white jade table in front of him with his fist.

“Detestable!”

The extremely hard white jade table was instantly turned into dust.

When the disciples guarding the residence heard the commotion, they were so frightened that their bodies began to tremble.

What had made Chief Gao Shun so angry?

Right at this time, two of Gao Shun’s disciples passed by and heard Gao Shun’s roar. They jumped up in shock.

“Senior Brother Chen, who provoked Teacher? Why is he so angry?”

When Xiao Feng heard the roars coming from within, he shuddered.

“As far as I know, in the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect, the only person who can make Teacher so angry is Martial Uncle Ye Xuan, who is the chief of Cloud Sky peak,” Chen Ruoxuan said.

“What? That useless chief from Cloud Sky peak?”

Xiao Feng was stunned.

“Shh! Don’t say such things in the future!”

Chen Ruoxuan quickly glared at Xiao Feng.

“Martial Uncle Ye Xuan is not trash. You’ve been cultivating in seclusion all this while, so you might not have heard of Martial Uncle Ye’s feats in the outside world.”

Oh? ” Xiao Feng’s interest was piqued, and he quickly asked about what had happened.

After hearing the whole story, he was dumbfounded.

“Oh my God, is Martial Uncle Ye so powerful? No wonder Teacher’s face has been so ugly since he came back…”

Just as the two of them were in a heated discussion, a cold voice rang out.

“What are you guys doing?”

The two of them were shocked and looked up. Gao Tianyu’s figure suddenly appeared in their field of vision.

“Senior… Senior brother…”

“We were just discussing cultivation issues…”

Gao Tianyu did not say much, but his gaze then fell on Gao Shun, who was roaring in the residence.

...

He had been in seclusion the entire time and was not clear about what had happened earlier. He was also very puzzled as to why his father was so angry. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“If that’s the case, then hurry and go cultivate!” Gao Tianyu looked at the two cultivators indifferently.

“Yes!”

The two of them quickly nodded and left.
