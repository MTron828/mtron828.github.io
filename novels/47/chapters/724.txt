725 Meeting (Part 1)

After sensing the arrival of this person, Zhuge Yueyue and the other two looked over and saw that it was Hua Rufeng.

Thank you readers!

Zhuge Yueyue frowned.

Normally, Hua Rufeng’s arrival meant that there was something particularly important going on.

After Hua Rufeng stepped into the Cloud Sky Palace and saw the pile of gifts on the floor, his face was filled with envy. He stared at it for something before asking, “Junior Sister Zhuge, where is Martial Uncle Ye now?”

“Teacher is in secluded cultivation. Senior Brother Hua, why are you looking for my teacher?”

Before Zhuge Yueyue could reply, Xiang Yun had already responded in her stead.

“Ah… Secluded cultivation?”

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng immediately frowned.

“Senior Brother Hua, is there something you need? You can just tell me, as Teacher instructed me to take care of Cloud Sky peak in the meantime.”

Zhuge Yueyue pretended to be calm as she said this, but she was already feeling nervous.

Hua Rufeng then smiled and said, “In that case, Junior Sister Zhuge, please come with me.”

“In a while, Martial Uncle Ao will be holding an important meeting at the main peak. Every peak needs to send a representative to attend. Since Martial Uncle Ye is not around, you will have to attend in his stead.”

This time, Hua Rufeng had only come personally to inform Ye Xuan to attend the meeting. There was no other important matter.

However, he had not expected that Ye Xuan would not be around. However, this was not a big problem. After all, Cloud Sky peak only needed to send a representative.

After hearing this, Feng Xiyun piped up, “Senior Brother Hua, is there something important being discussed in this meeting?”

The two of them wanted to know if anything unexpected had happened for all the chiefs of the peaks to be summoned.

Hua Rufeng waved his hand and replied, “I’m not sure either. You should hurry over first. Once the meeting starts, you’ll find out what’s going on.”

“I still have to contact the chiefs of the other peaks, so I’ll be leaving first.”

“Alright, Senior Brother Hua, you go on ahead. I’ll rush over immediately.”

Watching Hua Rufeng’s figure disappear over the horizon, Zhuge Yueyue began to ponder.

Feng Xiyun looked at Zhuge Yueyue and said, “First Sister, if I’m not wrong, something important must have happened. As such, you must be careful with your words and actions.”

“Before Teacher entered secluded cultivation, he specifically instructed us not to stir up trouble before he came out. Therefore, we should keep a low profile.”

Zhuge Yueyue kept her teacher’s words in mind and knew what needed to be done.

Turning around, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Xiang Yun and said, “Third Sister, I’ll head to the meeting first. When I’m not around, you have to listen to Second Sister’s instructions, understand?

“Alright, First Sister.”

Xiang Yun agreed without hesitation. This mischievous little girl seemed to have become much more obedient and did not cause trouble. This was probably because she really wanted that new hammer technique.

Zhuge Yue Yue did not stay for long after giving her instructions, and immediately headed to the main peak.

When she arrived, someone rushed over from behind her.

Eh? It was Li Hanyi?

Could it be that even Chief Yuelun was in secluded cultivation?

“Senior Sister Li, why are you here? Is your teacher in secluded cultivation as well?” Zhuge Yueyue asked in confusion.

Her initial uneasiness had dissipated somewhat after seeing another fellow disciple show up.

Li Hanyi was originally quite nervous, but when she saw that Zhuge Yueyue was here for the meeting as well, she suddenly became less nervous.

She replied, “My teacher sensed an opportunity to break through, so she went into seclusion to cultivate. She hasn’t come out yet, and asked me to manage Water Sky peak’s affairs in the meantime.”

A smile appeared on Zhuge Yueyue’s face.

What a coincidence!

“How about we go together?”

After saying these words with a smile, the two of them stepped into the main hall together.

In the main hall, Ao Lei had been waiting for some time, and was the only one here.

“Martial Niece Zhuge Yueyue…”

“Martial Niece Li Hanyi…”

“Greetings, Martial Uncle Ao.”

When they stepped into the main hall, the two of them greeted Ao Lei in unison.

Ao Lei could not help but frown when he saw the two of them.

“Why are the two of you here? Where did your teachers go?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhuge Yueyue said calmly, “Martial Uncle Ao, my teacher is currently at a critical juncture in his cultivation and is temporarily unable to leave. Therefore, I am currently in charge of Cloud Sky peak.”

After hearing this, Ao Lei’s heart was instantly filled with joy, as he knew that this meant that Ye Xuan was trying to break through to the ancient realm.
