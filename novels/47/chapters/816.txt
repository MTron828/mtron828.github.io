817 New Chief

When everyone looked closely and saw a jade pendant hanging on Zhuge Yueyue’s waist. This was an exclusive item that only the chief of Cloud Sky peak could have. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After seeing this, Ao Lei understood.

“Junior Brother Ye, could it be that you want to…”

Before Ao Lei could finish, Ye Xuan waved his hand to stop him.

“Everyone, I have been the chief of Cloud Sky peak for dozens of years. Now that I have reached the sealed immortal realm, my situation and responsibilities mean that I am no longer suitable to lead Cloud Sky peak.”

“It is precisely because of this that I announce today that I will pass the position of Cloud Sky Peak Sect Leader to my eldest disciple, Zhuge Yue Yue.”

“From today onwards, Zhuge Yueyue is the 19th chief of Cloud Sky peak!”

After hearing this, everyone was shocked. No one had expected that Ye Xuan, who was still so young, would actually step down and pass his position to Zhuge Yueyue.

Many geniuses present chose to join the Great Wilderness Divine sect because of Ye Xuan. However, he had already stepped down even before they officially joined.

Ye Xuan had expected this response, but in fact, he had no choice but to pass the position to Zhuge Yueyue. After all, he still had a lot of things to handle, and could not be tied down at Cloud Sky peak.

Moreover, the eight continents were about to be united, and there was no way to predict what would happen in the future. There was also the strange realm, which further compounded the danger surrounding them.

This was the reason that he made this decision.

He said calmly, “My eldest disciple has advanced to the middle stage of the heaven realm, so she is fully qualified for the position.”

“From today onward, she will be in charge of Cloud Sky peak. She can also take in disciples.”

“Everyone, if you have confidence in yourself, you can choose to become Yuetue’s disciple, and I may also become your grandmaster.”

After hearing this, the group of people present was extremely excited.

“I didn’t hear anything wrong just now, did I?”

Everyone was extremely happy at this moment. After all, Ye Xuan was a sealed immortal realm expert, and unmatched in the East Continent.

Many of them had come to join the sect to see if they had the chance to join the Cloud Sky peak. However, up till now, Cloud Sky peak had yet to accept a single disciple.

This current situation presented an opportunity.

After Zhuge Yueyue became the chief of Cloud Sky peak, she would be able to recruit disciples.

Although Zhuge Yueyue was not extremely powerful like Ye Xuan, the one standing behind her was Ye Xuan!

The sealed immortal realm was a level that people could only dream of but could not reach. If they could become Ye Xuan’s grand disciple, they would even be willing to become servants on Cloud Sky peak!

This was the truth!

“Junior Brother Ye, Yue Yue is still so young. Isn’t it a little too hasty for you to let her become chief now?”

Gao Shun frowned slightly, feeling that this was somewhat inappropriate.

Ao Lei did not mind. He knew that since Ye Xuan had already made up his mind, he could not change it. Thus, he agreed to Ye Xuan’s request.

He knew very well that since Ye Xuan had already become a sealed immortal realm expert, it would be difficult for balanced discussions and interactions to happen among the chiefs and peaks.

Therefore, It was best for Zhuge Yueyue to inherit his position.

“I’ve already made up my mind, so there’s no need for you to continue persuading me, Senior Brother Gao,” Ye Xuan said calmly. Finally, he looked at his eldest disciple with a gratified expression.

In Ye Xuan’s heart, Zhuge Yueyue also held an extremely important position.

Even when he was at his most destitute, Zhuge Yueyue did not disdain him and still treated him as her teacher. Now that she had become stronger, she could support Cloud Sky peak in his stead. This made Ye Xuan very happy.

“However, Yueyue is really too young, and might not understand many things. Do you really think she can become a good teacher and lead her disciples well?” Gao Shun asked with some uncertainty.

He did not think that Zhuge Yue Yue was incapable, but she was really too young. She was only 19 years old now, right? If she became chief at this age, would her ego become inflated?

Noticing Gao Shun’s suspicious gaze, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. He looked at Gao Shun indifferently and said, “Senior Brother Gao, have you forgotten how old I was when I became chief?”

Hearing this, Gao Shun was left speechless.

The people of the Cloud Sky peak were all very strange, and could not be viewed from ordinary perspectives.

Indeed, Ye Xuan had been about the same age as Zhuge Yueyue when he became the chief of Cloud Sky peak, but he still managed Cloud Sky peak in an orderly manner.

Even though his performance was not very dazzling at the beginning, it was only because he had been keeping a low profile.

“Haha!”

Seeing Gao Shun like that, Ao Lei could not help but smile and say, “Junior Brother Ye, don’t you have any intention of recruiting disciples?”

“Besides, you have to pass down your powerful techniques and divine powers.”
