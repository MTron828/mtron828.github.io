308 Ye Xuan?

“Detestable!”

Seeing Shangguan Wan’er continue to ignore him, Liu Chengtian’s expression turned ugly.

This particular trump card was extremely precious. He was originally reluctant to use it, but the situation was now critical.

Moments later, Liu Chengtian opened his right hand slightly, and a dazzling jade token appeared. Once it shattered, it turned into an illusory energy body that contained terrifying energy.

This was a Human King realm jade token!

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression did not change at all. She also took out a jade token and crushed it.

The very next second, an even more terrifying force swept out and crushed the energy body in an instant.

This was the power of the Heavenly King realm cultivator!

“Impossible!”

Liu Chengtian’s eyes were filled with fear.

Shangguan Wan’er actually had such a terrifying expert behind her, whose strength was even stronger than his master!

‘Damn that Baili Moyan. Didn’t he say that Shangguan Wan’er had always been alone?’

Boom!

As Liu Chengtian watched in horror, the energy body was destroyed by the energy body that Shangguan Wan’er’s jade token had summoned.

“Damn it! Who’s your teacher?”

“Why do you have such a terrifying trump card?”

“Don’t come over! You can’t attack me! I’m a supreme genius of the Lightning Divine Palace!”

“If you kill me, it will definitely cause a war between the two superpowers. I’m sure your teacher doesn’t want to see such a situation.”

“Shangguan Wan’er, you...”

Liu Chengtian kept babbling out of fear, his body trembling uncontrollably.

“Hehe! What right do you have to know who my teacher is?”

“You’re just a mere ant!”

Shangguan Wan’er finally said something in response.

She was not bothered by his threats. In her mind, Ye Xuan was unfathomable. How could some random King realm cultivator measure up to her teacher? She even speculated that Ye Xuan had surpassed the King realm.

What right did trash like Liu Chengtian have to know her teacher’s name?

As soon as she finished speaking, the Heavenly King realm energy body suddenly reached out and clenched his fist.

“No!”

Liu Chengtian let out a cry of despair.

However, no matter how he struggled, the outcome was already decided.

Bang!

Liu Chengtian’s body and soul were reduced to dust, never to reappear in this world again.

The Heavenly King realm energy body also disappeared at this point.

Then, Shangguan Wan’er stretched out her hand and tore space apart to open a passageway back to the Luo Heaven Palace.

Now that Liu Chengtian had been dealt with, Baili Moyan was the only one left.

…

When Baili Moyan noticed that Liu Chengtian’s aura had completely vanished, his body trembled.

He activated every trump card he had in a frantic attempt to flee.

A six-pattern condensation realm genius had fallen! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Just how strong was Shangguan Wan’er?

Buzzzzzz!

A streak of dazzling sword qi tore through the sky toward Baili Moyan.

“No!”

As the sword qi in his eyes gradually enlarged, Baili Moyan let out a cry of despair. Then, his body and soul turned into dust and completely disappeared from the world.

The Luo Heaven Palace regained its former peace.

However, this battle caused a stir in the Miaoling Region, as there had been a number of pattern condensation realm experts who had sensed the energy fluctuations from the battle and come over to observe.

Some even followed Liu Chengtian and Shangguan Wan’er into the spatial turbulence. When they saw the two King realm jade tokens appear, they were dumbfounded.

Was Shangguan Wan’er not a loner?

Why did she have such a terrifying trump card?

Could it be that she had a terrifying expert behind her?

There were rumors that Ye Xuan was Shangguan Wan’er’s teacher. Could it be that the energy body that Shangguan Wan’er summoned was Ye Xuan?

Everyone had questions, but were also fearful of Shangguan Wan’er and that terrifying expert behind her.

“Teacher was right! The Luo Heaven Palace really did encounter trouble!”

If she had not returned to the Luo Heaven Palace, no one would have been able to stop Liu Chengtian. Perhaps the Luo Heaven Palace that she had established would have been destroyed.

“Lightning Divine Palace! Hmm, it seems that this matter is far from over!”

“I might have to ask Teacher to deal with the Lightning Divine Palace if they have a King realm expert,” Shangguan Wan’er muttered to herself.

After that, Shangguan Wan’er called the elders of the Luo Heaven Palace over.

“Greetings, Palace Master!”

The elders of the Luo Heaven Palace bowed to Shangguan Wan’er respectfully.

These elders were the experts who had been with Shangguan Wan’er the longest.

Some had chosen to follow Shangguan Wan’er because they admired her achievements, and some of them had been personally trained by her.

“I’m leaving the Luo Heaven Palace,” Shangguan Wan’er said as she looked at the elders.

“What? Palace Master, are you going to abandon our Luo Heaven Palace?”

All of the elders ‘expressions changed drastically upon hearing this.

The reason why the Luo Heaven Palace was considered the strongest force in the Miaoling Region was largely due to Shangguan Wan’er’s terrifying combat prowess. If she left, what would happen to the Luo Heaven Palace?

“With my current strength, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for my strength to improve if I stay in the Luo Heaven Palace!”

“I want to follow by Teacher’s side and walk my own invincible path,” Shangguan Wan’er said indifferently.

“Teacher?”

When the elders heard this, they were stunned. A name appeared in their minds.

Ye Xuan!
