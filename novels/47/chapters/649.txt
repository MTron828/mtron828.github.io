650 Picking A Fight (Part 2)

“Which family does this barking dog belong to? Why didn’t you tie him up at home instead of bringing him to the gathering?”

Hearing Gao Shun’s words, Ao Lei nodded his head and replied, “Indeed. The dog seems to be from the Supreme Divine sect.”

As soon as he heard that, Gu Hao became so angry that his veins popped out. These two guys were actually mocking him so openly!

He was a peak-level Supreme realm expert, yet the two of them actually dared to speak about him like this?

!!

“Ah, no wonder. He’s from the Supreme Divine sect. It all makes sense then,” Gao Shun said with an evil smile. Every word hit Daoist Gu Hao hard, making him tremble with anger.

“Gao Shun, what do you mean by these words? Who gave you the guts to humiliate my master like this?”

Daoist Black Iron shouted in anger, but after Gao Shun heard these words, he immediately laughed out loud.

“Everyone heard that, right? I didn’t point out anyone, but Daoist Black Iron said that I was scolding his master. Those are his words, not mine now.”

“I really have to give it to him. He actually dared to insult his own master and call him a dog. In my opinion, he is a real dog.”

“I really despise you now…”

Hearing Gao Shun’s retort, Daoist Black Iron was infuriated and wanted to curse all nine generations of his family. Gao Shun was putting words in his mouth!

Daoist Black Iron hurriedly said to his master, “Master, you know I don’t think that way. Gao Shun is slandering me!”

“Just shut up!”

Daoist Gu Hao glared at him fiercely. He was about to die of anger at this point, and his disciple was not helping in this situation at all.

He calmed himself down for a moment before retracting his killing intent. His eyes stared straight at Gao Shun, and then he stood up directly.

“Haha, everyone, please calm down. Isn’t it good to maintain a harmonious relationship?”

Daoist Xu Yun hurriedly tried to mediate after sensing that the situation had escalated.

The gathering had not started yet. Were they in such a hurry to start a war?

“Damn it!”

Daoist Gu Hao completely ignored Daoist Xu Yun’s words and looked at Gao Shun with eyes filled with killing intent as he said coldly, “It seems that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is getting more and more presumptuous. How dare you insult me like this!”

“Fine! I’ll play along then…”

After that, the aura of a peak-level supreme realm expert was released in an instant, and the sky was instantly filled with dark clouds and strong winds.

At this moment, Gao Shun and the rest of the group felt like a huge mountain was pressing on their shoulders. However, moments later, Gao Shun adjusted himself and released his early-stage supreme realm aura.

After sensing this aura, everyone at the scene could not help but turn pale with fright.

“Gao shun actually broke through to the supreme realm too?”

“In that case, just how many supreme realm cultivators does the Great Wilderness Divine sect have?”

At this moment, even Daoist Gu Hao was shocked.

To his surprise, there were two supreme realm experts in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Furthermore, that Ye Xuan person had yet to arrive, but given Ao Lei’s boasting, the former had to be a supreme realm expert as well.

This all meant that the Great Wilderness Divine sect was going to become stronger!

After noticing this, Daoist Gu Hao could only retract his killing intent and shout, “Not bad! Another supreme realm cultivator!”

“Anyway, this is the venue of the gathering, which makes it perfect for a good exchange. Let’s see how strong you both are!”

Before launching his attack, Daoist Gu Hao even shamelessly found an excuse to attack Ao Lei and Gao Shun.

“The two of you shou;d go ahead and join forces. Don’t say that I’m bullying you.”

Ao Lei and Gao Shun first exchanged glances, before welcoming the fight.

“Hehe, seeing that you’ve already invited me so hospitably, it would be a shame to decline”

“Today, let’s have a good fight!”

Gao Shun said very arrogantly, not having any intention of retreating at all.

Even if he knew that the enemy he was about to face was a peak-level supreme realm cultivator, he was not afraid.

After all, he had yet to fully absorb the power of the pill that Ye Xuan had given him previously. If he were to activate the forbidden secret technique, he would definitely be able to fight against a peak-level supreme realm expert!

Besides, he knew very well that it would not be long before Ye Xuan arrived. What was there to be afraid of?

“Arrogant!”

Daoist Gu Hao shouted. He was ready to attack.

At this moment, a white-robed figure suddenly appeared in front of Daoist Gu Hao and instantly dispelled the aura released by him.

“He’s finally here!”

Not far away, the people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect became excited when they saw this figure.

Who else could it be other than Ye Xuan?

At this moment, Te Xuan and his three disciples appeared in the sky very calmly.

With a wave of his hand, the imposing aura that Daoist Gu Hai had released disappeared in an instant.

“Hehe, this old Daoist seems to be in a good mood. Since you’re up for a fight, how about letting me play with you? ”

As soon as he finished speaking, the aura of a peak-level supreme realm expert was released. It was even stronger than the aura released by Daoist Gu Hao.

At this moment, the entire place turned silent! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Even Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were so shocked that they did not even notice the teacups in their hands falling to the ground.

“Master,” Elder Tongtian said in a trembling voice, “This is the chief of Cloud Sky peak I told you about, Ye Xuan.”

Daoist Canghai’s expression changed drastically upon hearing this. He could not believe what he was hearing.

...

“That’s Ye Xuan?”

‘He’s actually a peak-level supreme realm expert. This was just too unbelievable. How had he managed to achieve this at such a young age?’

‘In the future, wouldn’t it be easy for him to break through to reach the ancient realm or even the sealed immortal realm?’

Daoist Xu Yun was also shocked.

“Daoist Canghai, have you noticed? The aura that this person is exuding is even stronger than ours. He’s definitely not an ordinary peak-level supreme realm cultivator!”
