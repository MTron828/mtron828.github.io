Just as everyone thought that it was going to die, its huge body suddenly erupted with dazzling fiery light.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically when they saw this. The heaven devouring divine sparrow was a supreme realm existence. Even if its physical body had been severely injured, as long as its soul still existed, it would be able to recover.

When Ye Xuan saw this, he raised his eyes slightly, also feeling a little surprised. However, it mattered not. If he could not kill it in one strike, then he would use another!

At this moment, the heaven devouring divine sparrow spat out a huge fireball toward Ye Xuan, forcing him back. As a supreme realm existence, in terms of strength, it naturally surpassed Ye Xuan.

It had been too careless just now, and had been distracted by the Pixiu, which was why he had been seriously injured by Ye Xuan’s attack!

After learning the hard way, it would not make the same mistake again.

After using the fireball to force Ye Xuan back, the heaven devouring divine sparrow did not choose to attack again. Instead, it glared at Ye Xuan fiercely, then turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

Even though its body had successfully recovered thanks to the surging life force of a supreme realm being, it had still been weakened.

Furthermore, it could not take too many of those sword strikes, otherwise, it might really end up being buried here.

“Trying to run? It won’t be that easy!”

Monstrous sword intent erupted from Ye Xuan’s body, and he turned into a dazzling streak of light and pursued the heaven devouring divine sparrow. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, it was an ancient beast descendant known for its speed. Even if Ye Xuan used the power of teleportation, he could not catch up.

“This beast runs pretty fast!”

Helplessly, Ye Xuan could only give up.

He had gone all out, but was unable to match its speed. He now understood why Chief Tian Xuan had been unable to kill the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

However, Ye Xuan didn’t want to give up such a rare opportunity. If he did not kill it while it was injured, things would be troublesome for him when it recovered.

“You’re not going anywhere!”

Ye Xuan let out an angry roar as his body turned into a divine sword that soared into the sky and slashed toward the archaic divine mountains.

“My god, isn’t this guy a little too brutal? Which one is the real beast here?”

When everyone saw this scene, they were completely dumbfounded.

They had heard of Ye Xuan’s battle achievements and knew that he was terrifyingly strong, but this display of strength was beyond their wildest imagination.

A peak-level mystic lord realm expert was chasing a supreme realm beast!

Was this some sort of dream or illusion?

What was going on? Had the world gone crazy?

How had Ye Xuan accomplished this? How had he become so strong?

Ye Xuan’s destructive sword qi shot up into the sky. In an instant, it cut through space and slashed toward the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

At that moment, the heaven devouring divine sparrow turned around and was almost scared to death. It had grown to fear this human’s sword strikes, and no longer dared to be careless.

It pushed its body to its limit as it moved even faster, dodging the dazzling sword qi. Then, it suddenly opened its huge mouth, as that unparalleled suction force suddenly emerged again, trying to devour the living beings around it.

Ye Xuan’s expression changed when he saw this. The power of his spiritual sense swept out, carefully observing the energy flow within the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s body.

Suddenly, he discovered that the precious bone within the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s body was emitting a dazzling divine light. It transformed into a mysterious rune.

As the heaven devouring divine sparrow devoured the living beings around it, its injuries were slowly recovering.

‘I see. I didn’t expect the heaven devouring divine sparrow to be able to use its devouring power to heal its injuries.’

Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

According to the ancient legends, the heaven devouring divine sparrow was a ferocious beast that had been born during the chaos era. It was born in the depths of the eastern sea in the mystic world and lived in the Fusang tree like the golden crow divine beast.

The only difference between the two was that the golden crow divine beast would appear during the day and shine light upon the earth with its brilliant divine power. This was why it was called a divine beast by humans.

In comparison, whenever night fell, the heaven devouring divine sparrow would appear silently and use its terrifying and strange devouring power to devour everything, treating everything and everyone as food.

After countless years, countless living beings had fallen at the hands of the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

As it constantly devoured living beings, its cultivation rose. However, the cost of that was that the heaven devouring divine sparrow was hated by the human race, and even hunted down.

In an ancient book of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, it was recorded that the human race had once encountered a world-ending catastrophe in ancient times. The true instigator of that catastrophe was the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

The heaven devouring divine sparrow had wanted to devour all of the living beings in the entire mystic world and completely control it. It was a crazy plan!

Fortunately, it failed in the end. Furthermore, thanks to that catastrophe, the human race gradually became stronger and gained the strength to compete with the other races.

At the same time, the ancient beasts that had been sleeping in the archaic divine mountains gradually awoke. After countless eras of war, the human race had designated these ancient beasts as the ten most powerful beasts!

The appearance of these ten powerful beasts completely shattered the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s dream of devouring the mystic world.
