Chapter 48: Vermillion Mountain Fruit

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You’re welcome!” Seeing this, Ye Xuan waved his hand indifferently.

To him, it was normal for a teacher to protect their disciples, so there was no need for such thanks?

Also, as his disciple, how could he bear to see her bullied?

“Thank you, Elder Ye! Thank you, Elder Ye!”

Hearing this, Li Zhengyang and the other elders trembled in excitement and bowed to Ye Xuan gratefully.

Now that Elder Ye Xuan was backing up the Li family, why should they be afraid of the leader of the Mad Saber sect?

Although the leader of the Mad Saber sect was also a top-tier core formation realm powerhouse, how could he compare to Ye Xuan?

Ye Xuan was both monstrously powerful and monstrously talented. In fact, just the mere mention of the Qingyun sect that he belonged to was enough to suppress theleader of the Made Saber sect.

One had to know that the elders of even the lowest ranked top-tier sects were at least in the virtual core realm.

The sect leaders were mostly true core realm cultivators to boot!

Compared to the Qingyun sect, the Mad Saber sect was insignificant!

The leader’s cultivation was only at the initial stage of the virtual core realm. Although his strength was enough to crush the Li family, he was an ant in the eyes of the Qingyun sect.

“This is a fruit that grows on Vermilion Mountain. It is very effective in treating injuries. As long as he completely absorbs its energy, your father’s injuries will naturally heal!”

......

At this moment, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve. A fruit the size of a fist suddenly appeared in front of Li Qingyan. The fruit exuded extremely mysterious red power. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“This can also be considered as my welcome gift to you!”

“Thank you, Teacher!”

Li Qingyan, who had just calmed herself down, felt moved once again. Her heart was filled with gratitude toward Ye Xuan.

Although the effect of the Vermillion Mountain fruit could not compare to the soul-returning pill, it could at least heal her father’s injuries. Such a treasure was very precious, but her teacher gave it to her without the slightest hesitation!

Moreover, the meaning of her teacher’s words was also very obvious. This treasure was specially prepared for her father.

Ye Xuan could have directly given the fruit to Li Zhengyang, but he was not stupid. Only by giving it to his disciple could he receive a reward from the system.

“Father, you can eat it later!”

Without the slightest hesitation, Li Qingyan accepted the Vermillion Mountain fruit and handed it to her father.

“Thank you for saving my life, Elder Ye! I will never forget your grace!”

Seeing this, Li Zhengyang could not help but tremble, and his eyes were full of gratitude.

Although he did not know what the Vermillion Mountain fruit was, he could tell that its effect was not much weaker than the soul-returning pill.

He had originally given up hope when his precious daughter failed to successfully bid for the soul-returning pill. He consigned himself to being crippled for the rest of his life. Ye Xuan’s appearance here had given him a new lease on life.

Moreover, not only did the other party take his precious daughter as his disciple, but he also gave away the extremely precious Vermilion Mountain fruit.

This was the strength of a core formation realm cultivator!

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the holy healing medicine, Vermilion Mountain fruit, the host has received a randomized 10x critical reward. Congratulations, the host has obtained the holy healing medicine, Spirit Fruit!”

At the same time, the sound of a system notification rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind, and he smiled.

Then, a fruit filled with white mysterious power suddenly appeared in his system inventory.

‘Mm-hmm, this is the benefit of taking in a new disciple.’

“You should leave with me first to go and pay your respects to your senior sister. After that, I will teach you the cultivation methods and martial techniques of the Qingyun sect!” Ye Xuan said.

“Yes, Master!” Li Qingyan quickly nodded.

Ye Xuan then waved his sleeve, and the true qi in his body gushed out. It then wrapped itself around Li Qingyan, and they both turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the distance.

After the two of them left, Li Zhengyang and the elders were still in shock. After some time, an elder spoke.

“Qingyun sect, Ye Xuan!”

“I didn’t expect that my Li family would receive the favor of the Qingyun sect. Qingyan even became a disciple of Elder Ye Xuan. Hahahaha!”

The elder’s face was full of excitement, and his body trembled with joy.

They had thought that there was only one way out for the Li family, which was to marry Li Qingyan to Chen Ping. From then on, although the Li family could survive, they would become a subsidiary family of the Chen family and eke out an ignoble life.

They had never imagined that this situation would be overturned in such spectacular fashion. A super powerhouse who had reached the core formation realm had come to their Li family’s residence, and even accepted Li Qingyan as a disciple.

The moment Li Qingyan truly became Ye Xuan’s disciple, the Li family knew that they no longer had to fear the Chen family. So what if Chen Ping had become the personal disciple of the leader of the Mad Saber sect? How could he compare to Li Qingyan becoming the disciple of Elder Ye Xuan?

The name Ye Xuan already represented the pinnacle position in the Great Qian Dynasty. He was a tragedy in the eyes of countless young cultivators, a terrifying monster that could never be surpassed.

Not only was Ye Xuan a super genius that the younger generation of cultivators could not surpass, even the older generation of cultivators could not surpass him.

Although Ye Xuan’s current strength could not be compared to the sect master of the Qingyun sect, given his monstrous talent, it would not be long before he surpassed the sect master of the Qingyun sect and became the strongest cultivator ever since the founding of the Qingyun sect.

All the cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty had heard of Ye Xuan’s deeds and viewed him as an existence who would be equal to the master of the Great Qian Dynasty in the future.

How could a mere Chen Ping be compared to Li Qingyan?

“Good, good!”

Li Zhengyang clenched his fists tightly and said good twice in succession. His originally pale and powerless face turned rosy.

Compared to everyone else, he was undoubtedly the most excited one here.

Ever since he was heavily injured, his strength had dropped drastically. The Li family had fallen into an unprecedented predicament. How could an injured tiger withstand the siege of a pack of wolves?

Although he felt helpless inwardly, as the head of the Li family, he could only choose to endure the pain and sacrifice his daughter’s happiness.

However, no matter what, his heart was extremely pained. He even regretted becoming the head of the Li family.

Even if he was the head of a family, he did not have absolute power. He could not even protect his own daughter. What a sad father he was. Was he even worthy of being a father?

Moreover, the Li family had been about to become someone else’s subordinate family in his hands. Was he really worthy of being the head of the family?

However, just as he was despairing, Ye Xuan appeared and brought renewed hope, like the dawning of a new day… He was like the sun, whose brilliance rescued the Li family from their dark and desperate plight.

In the eyes of Li Zhengyang and countless Li family members, Ye Xuan was their savior!
