864 Success!

An explosion erupted, and terrifying energy shockwaves swept out, causing the Cloud Sky Palace to tremble violently as if it was experiencing an earthquake.

Elder Qian Yi, who was meditating in the Cloud Sky Hall, who was reveling in the fact that his body had been reconstructed, was sent flying and crashed into a wall.

Puchi!

After spitting out a mouthful of blood, Elder Qian Yi looked around anxiously.

“Who is it? Who dared to attack me?”

However, after sensing the spiritual energy fluctuations, his expression changed drastically.

“This… This is an immortal-grade cultivation technique?”

“Is this for real? Does the East continent’s Cloud Sky peak actually possess such a heaven-defying cultivation technique?”

He could scarcely believe what he was seeing, and simply stood there foolishly. Before he had arrived, he was confident that the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent was the orthodox one. After all, they had more cultivation techniques and were more powerful.

However, what he saw today made his beliefs waver. Perhaps Cloud Sky peak was different?

He stared blankly at Ye Xuan as the Heaven Burning Flames technique continued to cause various phenomena to emerge in the sky. Ye Xuan himself was an anomaly, and perhaps only the Saintess could compete with him.

However, the position of Saintess meant that Yanran presided over both sects, and therefore the Great Wilderness Divine sect could not exactly claim that she solely belonged to them.

Thus, with Ye Xuan around, the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent was at a clear disadvantage.

“Sigh… This guy is truly terrifying. With such powerful flames, who can stand up to him? If his disciples also participate in the competition between the sect, then the outcome is pretty much set in stone…”

Elder Qian Yi no longer had any confidence in winning the competition. However, he did not want to be the bearer of bad news either, in which case he would be forced to tell Old Master Sun that the competition was a lost cause. Thus, he could only keep it to himself.

After all, Ye Xuan had just helped him so much, without which he would probably be stuck at the early stage of the supreme realm for the rest of his life.

It would nOt be an exaggeration to say that Ye Xuan was his savior. He did nOt know how to repay Ye Xuan’s kindness, but at the very least he would help him hide this matter first. What was worth mentioning was that Elder Qian Yi was a good person. At the very least, he knew how to repay kindness.

However, if Ye Xuan knew Elder Qian Yi’s thoughts, he would probably say that there was no need for the matter to be hidden. What was there to hide? He would end up showing off his power in the future anyway, so there was no difference in it being sooner or later.

Standing there blankly, Elder Yi was actually starting to get anxious, but he did not dare to leave Cloud Sky Palace. After all, Ye Xuan was currently protecting him from the Heaven Burning Flames. If he left, who knew what would happen.

Perhaps he would be incinerated to ashes. Thus, he could only stay put and watch helplessly.

After a while, a dull rumble echoed through the palace once more, and Feng Xiyun’s body trembled violently. She spat out a mouthful of blood, and her face turned pale and powerless. However, her body had already undergone a huge change. It was not an exaggeration to say that she had been reborn.

“Did you succeed?” Ye Xuan asked as he examined the condition of her body. When he finally took a look at her divine bone, he was shocked. The purple light that had covered it had now begun to turn red, and it looked like a ball of blazing fire. Moments later, the bone transmitted a stream of energy, which coursed through her body.

Thanks to this powerful energy, Feng Xiyun’s injuries recovered. After the immortal bone was successfully condensed, Feng Xiyun’s aura became completely different.

“Teacher!”

After sensing that the immortal bone had condensed in her body, Feng Xiyun was extremely happy and immediately looked at Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan waved his hand without hesitation and said with a straight face, “First, maintain your focus. This isn’t done yet. Continue practicing, maintain your calm, and break through!”

“Alright!”

Then, she entered the state of cultivation. As the immortal bone released waves of powerful energy, she did not hesitate to activate the Hunyuan Xuan technique to refine the energy.

Once Ye Xuan saw that things were developing according to his expectations, he relaxed, and slowly withdrew his spiritual power from her body. Now, Feng Xiyun would have to rely on herself for the rest. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

With the help of the immortal bone, she might be able to break through to the peak of the mystic lord realm, or perhaps even reach the supreme realm. It was all down to her own efforts.

Then, he finally checked on his own condition. As he had been focused on her transformation process, he had not had time to take stock of the changes that happened to his own body.

When he did, he smiled brightly.

His Dao Flowers all contained the aura of the Heaven Burning Flames!

“Very good, very good…”
