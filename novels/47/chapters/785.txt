786 Seven Monsters (Part 3)

At this moment, Ye Xuan looked at the strange monster in front of him with disdain.

“Another filthy creature has actually come. Why do all of you act so high and mighty?”

“I indeed killed the South Heavenly King you mentioned. Are you here for revenge?”

As soon as he finished speaking, his sword aura swept out into the surroundings, causing North Heavenly King’s heart to tremble. His sense of danger tingled.

This person was indeed very powerful. It seemed that they had indeed found the right person. Despite his senses warning him, North Heavenly King did not stand down.

He had already boasted in front of the other strange monsters earlier, and they were now watching him closely.

If he backed out at this moment, would it not be a big joke?

“Tsk, you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”

“How can a mere ant like you pretend to be equal to us! You actually dared to kill South Heavenly King. Today, we will make you pay with your life!”

After cursing, North Heavenly King immediately mobilized his power to condense a huge palm in the sky that came crashing toward Ye Xuan. Liek South Heavenly King’s attack, this palm strike also contained spatial power.

Despite facing this attack, Ye Xuan did not unleash an attack. Instead, he looked at the six monsters behind the strange monster with disdain.

“Haha, what a joke!”

“This guy is only an advanced-stage ancient realm, yet he’s showing off in front of me.”

“Don’t waste my time. The six of you should hurry up and attack as well,” Ye Xuan said presumptuously as his aura swept out.

“This…”

The expressions of the six strange monsters who were originally prepared to watch a good show changed drastically at this moment. This was because the aura Ye Xuan released was not aimed at North Heavenly King, but at the six monsters.

“What an ignorant fellow. He actually wants to challenge all seven of us alone?”

The other six strange monsters immediately burned with anger. They had originally wanted to North Heavenly King to test the waters first and see what Ye Xuan was capable of, but they could no longer suppress the anger in their hearts.

As ancient realm experts, they had never been looked down upon like this before. The six strange monsters were not the only ones infuriated.

North Heavenly King North, who was being ignored, was about to go berserk. Ye Xuan’s arrogance was insufferable!

F*ck!

“Damned fellow, if you know what’s good for you, surrender your life immediately,” North Heavenly King roared angrily. Without waiting for Ye Xuan to speak, he infused even more power into his attack.

Just as the palm strike was about to land, a keening sound filled the air, and a sword flashed through the sky, slicing the huge black palm into eight pieces.

Then, the Godsword returned and floated in front of Ye Xuan, emitting a terrifying aura.

“Impossible…”

“Is that a divine sword?”

The moment he saw the Godsword, fear bubbled forth from the depths of North Heavenly King’s heart. He looked at the remains of his right palm in disbelief.

Was he dreaming? How could his palm be chopped up so easily?

After seeing the other party’s terrified and incredulous expression, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly.

“That’s right, that South Heavenly King wore the same expression earlier too. He was arrogant, just like you, but once I made my move, he soon realized how powerless he was.”

“Seeing you like this reminds me of him. Hahaha!”

“Great!”

After seeing Ye Xuan’s domineering attack, Gao Shun jumped up in joy. At this moment, his confidence In Ye Xuan returned, and the rest of the people watching started cheering as well. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

They did not understand what was going on, but seeing Ye Xuan easily slice that huge palm into pieces meant that Ye Xuan had a definite advantage against that strange monster, so much so that if they fought, the outcome was clear.

The other six strange monsters were also shocked at this moment. As ancient realm experts themselves, they were capable of gauging the power contained within Ye Xuan’s earlier sword strike. It seemed that they really needed all seven of them to defeat him!

How domineering!
