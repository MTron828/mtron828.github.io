491 Elder Taiyin

“Hahaha! Isn’t it the same for Fellow Daoist Tongtian?”

Chu Tianba smiled and said indifferently.

Elder Tongtian knew very well that in the entire East continent, only the Reincarnation Fairy could make Chu Tianba take action.

After all, the Saintess was the future leader of the Jade Lake Divine sect, and she shouldered its fate.

As for the heavenly treasure, such a thing was not as important as the Reincarnation Fairy from Chu Tianba’s perspective.

The two of them exchanged pleasantries for a while before stepping into the archaic divine mountains.

At this moment, a few more bright streaks of light appeared in the sky.

When the two of them saw this, they were shocked. They looked at the old man who had appeared.

“Elder Taiyin?”

“This old man has also made an appearance?”

The two of them looked at each other and saw the doubt in each other’s eyes.

They were extremely familiar with the old man in the black and white robe.

This person was the grand elder of the Immortal Divine sect, Elder Taiyin, and he was a half-step supreme realm expert!

Seeing him here was really strange because he was supposed to be cultivating in seclusion in order to break through to the supreme realm.

Dozens of years ago, Elder Tongtian had heard that Elder Taiyin had sensed an opportunity to break through and had gone into seclusion in the Immortal Divine sect.

This was why it was such a surprise seeing him here.

Could it be that this old fellow had already reached the supreme realm?

Seeing Elder Taiyin appear, Su Changkong and the other cultivators of the Immortal Divine sect quickly greeted him respectfully. Elder Taiyin then turned to the earlier two.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect that you two Fellow Daoists would still be so healthy after so many years,” Elder Taiyin looked at the two of them indifferently and then said with a teasing smile.

They were all cultivators of the same era, and they all belonged to different holy lands, so they were naturally competitors.

However, they had been fighting for hundreds of years, and had yet to determine a winner.

Therefore, rather than fighting for real, they were mostly content to tease each other about who would live longer now.

Chu Tianba glared at Elder Taiyin in annoyance.

“You haven’t kicked the bucket yet, old geezer, so there’s no way I’d go before you.”

“Didn’t you go into seclusion? Why did you suddenly appear? Have you managed to take that step?” Elder Tongtian asked curiously.

Elder Taiyin did not give an answer, but just smiled.

His personality had always been like this; he liked to hide things.

Suddenly, Elder Tongtian looked at Elder Taiyin, and then smiled.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Teacher…” Mu Beichen, who was beside him, could not help but ask for more information.

Elder Tongtian kept smiling and said, “You may not know this, but the grand elder of the Immortal Divine sect in front of us was involved in a very well-known incident back then! And it’s definitely a dark matter!”

“What?”

Hearing this, Mu Beichen suddenly became interested.

Elder Tongtian did not choose to hide it, and he did not deliberately lower his voice.

“Back then, when Elder Taiyin reached the peak of the mystic lord realm, his confidence was off the charts. He thought that he was already invincible!”

“As such, after he left the Immortal Divine sect, the first top holy land he wanted to challenge was the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“The result of this was self-evident. He was beaten up by Chief Tian Xuan of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and was forced to flee with his tail between his legs.”

“Pfft!”

As soon as Elder Tongtian finished speaking, the people around him could not help but laugh.

“There are many top holy lands in the East continent, yet he chose the strongest one!:

“He sealed his own fate!”

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin’s face turned extremely ugly.

This part of his history had always been a sore spot in his heart, and it was still fresh in his memory.

He had thought that after hundreds of years, this matter would have been long forgotten by everyone, and had not expected Elder Tongtian to actually bring it up.

“Hmph!”

Elder Taiyin’s expression immediately turned cold. He furiously flicked his sleeves, turned around, and stomped away toward the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains.

Seeing this, even Chu Tianba, who had a steady personality, could not help but smile.

He then looked at Elder Tongtian.

“Fellow Daoist Tongtian, you have to be careful later. Elder Taiyin is vengeful and has not left the sect for many years. Now that you’ve brought up his dark history, he’ll definitely be looking to target you in the future!”

“It’s just the Immortal Divine sect. The Heavenly Mountain Divine sect doesn’t fear them,” Elder Tongtian said indifferently. He clearly was not too bothered by this.

Hearing this, Chu Tianba narrowed his eyes.

As an old friend, he was naturally familiar with Elder Tongtian’s character.

If the latter was not certain that he could deal with the aftermath, he would not have revealed Elder Taiyin’s dark history to the public.

Thinking this, Chu Tianba wondered if someone from the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect had reached the supreme realm, and if so, who it was.

To Chu Tianba’s knowledge, it was impossible for a cultivator from the same era as him to break through before he did, so it had to be a cultivator from the previous generation.

Every top holy land had an unfathomable foundation, and there were countless experts hidden in the dark.

Thus, to determine the combat power of a top holy land, one could not look at the strength they displayed on the surface.

Behind these top holy lands would usually be cultivators from the previous era.

These experts were often in seclusion, looking for an opportunity to break through to the next realm. Only when the sect was facing a life-and-death crisis would they choose to help.

It was not just the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect and the Immortal Divine sect. The Great Wilderness Divine sect was the same.

Of course, only the chiefs were qualified to know such a secret. Even Hua Rufeng, the future sect masters, was not qualified to know.

Chu Tianba laughed. Then, his body turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

As more and more cultivators entered the archaic divine mountains, the atmosphere became increasingly lively.
