324 Just Who Is Ye Xuan?

“Alright, Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan reluctantly agreed.

“Wan’er, you can travel alone. As for Yue, Qingyan and Yan’er, it’s best that you go together.”

“We will heed Teacher’s instructions,” Shangguan Wan ‘er and the others said in unison.

“Alright! Off we go then,” Ye Xuan said.

After that, they split up.

Across the entire Tianyuan continent, the endless ocean was much larger than the land, which was why it was named as such.

The stormy sea area was the area closest to the Tianze Zone, and naturally was the residence of countless members of the sea race as well as many hidden opportunities.

Although Shangguan Wan’er and the other disciples could quickly improve their strength by following Ye Xuan, and would not lack cultivation resources or artifacts, the gifts Ye Xuan gave them were not the most suitable for them.

After all, Ye Xuan’s purpose in gathering and giving them rewards was to obtain a system reward that was most suited for himself. For example, although he had helped Yue strengthen her sword jade body, that was only because he had a sword constitution himself.

As for Zhao Yuyan and Li Qingyan’s special constitutions, he had yet to find the appropriate heavenly treasures required to strengthen them.

These opportunities were present for them in this stormy sea area.

In addition to that, since he was aware that a calamity would befall him, it was best that he travel alone to avoid implicating his disciples.

…

Ye Xuan carefully scanned his surroundings, and then his figure suddenly disappeared. His aura and the surroundings were perfectly integrated.

Incidentally, back in the Nanzhou Region, there was a very angry sea race Heavenly King realm expert.

He had traveled all the way there, but could not even locate the Qingyun sect. It was like the whole sect had vanished into thin air.

Of course, Ye Xuan was nowhere to be found either. It was obvious that he had predicted his arrival.

In his anger, the Heavenly King realm expert decided to attack the King realm experts of the Huangyu Zone, killing two of them before the master of the Sky Feather Holy Land, a Saint King realm expert, made his move.

Helplessly, the sea race Heavenly King realm expert was forced to flee resentfully.

Compared to the number of sea race King realm experts Ye Xuan had killed, the loss of two human King realm experts was negligible.

This time, the sea race had really suffered a great loss.

“Ye Xuan, just what is your identity?”

In the pitch-black darkness of the spatial turbulence, the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land, the master of the Sky Feather Holy Land, the master of the Heavenly Sword Hall, and other powerful cultivators were communicating with each other using their spiritual sense.

“I’m not sure! This guy is full of secrets!”

“Brother Chu, do you know? Jun Xuantian is from your sect, and was the one who stood up on his behalf regarding the matter of the Tower of Heaven.”

They turned to look at the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land.

“I don’t know either. You are all aware that my sect admires peerless geniuses and will always try to rope them in. That was the reason why we helped Ye Xuan.”

The master of the Divine Gate Holy Land shook his head.

“Although Ye Xuan’s identity is mysterious, it’s very likely that he has an old monster who has been sleeping for tens of thousands of years. Perhaps the reason he’s staying with the Qingyun sect is because someone from that sect unsealed him and awoke him from his slumber.”

“Still, there’s something that doesn’t add up.”

“What is it?”

“If Ye Xuan really is a Heavenly King realm expert, and has been concealing his cultivation level this entire time, how did he enter the Tower of Heaven?”

As soon as this question was posed, everyone fell silent.

This was indeed the most critical loophole in their theory. The Tower of Heaven had extremely strict requirements for entry. Only cultivators under the age of 50 were allowed to enter.

Furthermore, the Tower of Heaven was refined by the master of the Moon Demon Holy Land, who was a Saint King realm expert. Furthermore, a great emperor expert had assisted in the process, infusing it with spatial and karmic intent.

It was precisely because of this that the Tower of Heaven was considered a holy-grade artifact.

Although the Tower of Heaven had been damaged during the destruction of the Moon Demon Holy Land, even Saint King realm experts were unable to enter it forcefully, much less a Heavenly King realm expert like Ye Xuan.

Perhaps only someone who had comprehended at least fifth-level spatial intent could do so. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That being said, these experts here did not know that the Tower of Heaven contained karmic intent. Otherwise, even they might have been tempted to try and snatch the Tower of Heaven from Ye Xuan.
