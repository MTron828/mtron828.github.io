933 Third Wheel

Through Yanran’s hair, Ye Xuan could clearly smell her mesmerizing fragrance, causing him to unknowingly become intoxicated.

“Hu…”

Ye Xuan was extremely happy at this moment. Yanran did not reject him just now. This also reflected that in Yanran’s heart, he already occupied an extremely important position.

He secretly rejoiced. Did he need to strike while the iron was hot?

“What do you want?”

After noticing that Ye Xuan was hugging her tighter and tighter, Yanran’s heart beat faster and faster. At this moment, she was very flustered.

After all, the two of them were in such close proximity, and in public too. She could not maintain her cold demeanor, and her face flushed red.

Ye Xuan gently rubbed her head and spoke with affection.

“Yanran, if it’s possible, I want to grow old with you. What do you think?”

Yanran’s mind was in a mess at this moment. She did not know what to say and could only nod her head subconsciously.

“Oh my god, I’ve learnt a new technique!”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast’s voice rang out again, making Ye Xuan a little angry.

‘I was busy striking while the iron was hot just now, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly good, but you suddenly interjected and almost ruined the atmosphere. What do you mean by this?’

He turned around and saw that the Thunder-Devouring Beast was drawing something seriously.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast muttered to himself, “One step at a time. After noticing that the lady has relaxed, I have to strike while the iron is hot to develop the relationship faster.”

After recording this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast came over to Ye Xuan and whispered into his ear.

“Big Brother, have I got it right?”

Ye Xuan was sweating profusely at this moment, but when he remembered that he had just told the beast that he would teach him how to flirt with girls, he could only endure it.

However, Yanran was a little unhappy at this moment. She struggled out of Ye Xuan’s arms and then looked at the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

“The two of you are quite like lovers, huh? It’s really a little troublesome for me to stay here then.”

After saying this, Yanran turned around and was about to leave.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan was quick to react and grabbed Yanran’s hand. He hurriedly said, “Hehe…I was wrong, I was wrong. Yanran, let’s not mess around, okay?”

Her expression was cold. She was eager to know what kind of wicked things the two of them were talking about. Were they using her as a case study? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Seeing that Yanran was already suspicious at this moment, Ye Xuan could only softly tell Yanran the ins and outs of the matter.

However, when Yanran found out about the deal between Ye Xuan and the Thunder-Devouring Beast, she rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan and spoke unhappily.

“According to what you said, what you just said to me wasn’t from the bottom of your heart? Did you just want to demonstrate it to the Thunder-Devouring Beast?”

Yanran was very unhappy at this moment. Originally, she was very happy to receive the gift Ye Xuan had gotten for her. He had even said so many sweet words to her.

However, when she realized that Ye Xuan only wanted to give the Thunder-Devouring Beast a lesson, the joy she felt disappeared.

‘This stinky fellow actually dared to use me as a case study? He’s looking for a beating then!’

After seeing her cold expression, Ye Xuan’s heart thumped with anxiety. He hugged Yanran tightly in his arms.

Yanran did not continue to struggle. She wanted to hear what Ye Xuan had to say for himself.

Ye Xuan looked at Yanran anxiously and said, “Yanran, my love for you is absolutely not fake at all. Moreover, what I said just now is all from the bottom of my heart.”

“I’m always preparing for our future and fighting hard to make our dreams come true. In my heart, you’re an irreplaceable existence.”

Looking at Ye Xuan’s affectionate gaze, Yanran’s heart trembled violently.

“Alright then… I’ll forgive you this time…”

Just as she was about to speak further, Ye Xuan continued, “Yanran, you mentioned to me before that you wanted to explore the world and make a name for yourself. You wanted to soar freely in the boundless starry universe.”

“But you don’t know that in my heart, you are the universe. I just want to protect you and don’t want to see you get hurt.”

These words made Yanran’s heart melt, and whatever anger she felt just now vanished into thin air.

She looked at Ye Xuan in a daze and felt sincerely happy. So it turned out that she actually occupied such an important position in his heart.

Sigh…

This man of hers really had a way with words. What was she going to do about him?

She looked at Ye Xuan affectionately and said, “Alright, there’s no need to say anything more. You’re also irreplaceable in my heart.”

When Yanran said this, it caused Ye Xuan to almost dance with joy.

From the time they had known each other until now, this was the first time that she had said such mushy words to him, so this was a major breakthrough.

Just as Ye Xuan was about to continue speaking, he felt a pair of warm lips touching his.

Ah! Damn it! This was amazing!

Ye Xuan’s entire body seemed to be frozen as he quietly enjoyed Yanran’s kiss…

“Oh my god!”

Seeing this scene, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was completely dumbfounded, and was even more impressed by Ye Xuan.

“My big brother is too awesome. He actually took down this lady so easily?”

“Haha! My choice to learn pick-up skills from Big Brother was the right one.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was getting more and more excited. It could not wait to see if there was anything else to learn from so that he could also get himself a beautiful partner.

It seemed that he had to learn how to sweet-talk others. All it would take was a few sentences, and victory would be his! Was this not too awesome?

“Big Brother, you’re really amazing!”

While Ye Xuan and Yanran were passionately kissing, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was ignorantly shouting and exclaiming from the side.

Ye Xuan could barely restrain himself. Was this fellow trying to cause trouble for him?

Ugh!
