925 A Great Battle Begins

“The two of them are actually searching for each other’s flaws to use as an opening!”

“However, since they are both so powerful. How could they reveal flaws so easily for the other party to exploit?”

“Sigh… It seems that I still have a long way to go…”

A sealed immortal realm expert sighed. If he were in Ye Xuan’s position, he would definitely not be able to persist for this long. He would have either launched a desperate attack, or fled.

When the experts present witnessed this, they realized that they were completely out of their depth. So it turned out that a fight could be fought like this! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even their worldviews seemed to have been refreshed. From this, it could be seen that a battle between experts required sufficient patience to discover the flaws of the other party and defeat one’s enemy.

Hearing these words, Yanran nodded in approval, feeling that they were being quite reasonable.

“So that’s how it is…”

She had noticed that Ye Xuan’s feet were trembling and had initially thought that he was afraid. It seemed that this was not the case.

On the other hand, Ye Xuan was completely focused, and could not even hear what the others were saying. His back was drenched in cold sweat.

Up until now, he had not been able to find his opponent’s weakness.

The one thing he did know was that this beast was as patient and persistent as he was. After staring at each other for such a long time, the beast’s breathing was not hurried at all, which showed how confident and assured the beast was.

This was the first time he had encountered such a powerful enemy. Not daring to be careless, he took out the Godsword to prepare himself for the battle.

The moment he did that, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was so frightened that it trembled.

Fortunately, it was isolated by the fog, so this was not seen by Ye Xuan.

‘Oh no, he actually took out a weapon.’

‘What should I do? Why haven’t I been able to scare him off yet?’

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was extremely flustered, as it could tell how powerful Ye Xuan’s sword was. This sword had the power to kill him!

It continued to stare unblinkingly at Ye Xuan, though at the back of its mind, it was already thinking about how to escape later.

After noticing that the Thunder-Devouring Beast had ignored the Godsword, Ye Xuan’s heart trembled as he thought to himself, ‘Could it be that this Thunder-Devouring Beast isn’t even afraid of the Godsword? Isn’t this beast too terrifying?’

Seeing that the Thunder-Devouring Beast was still so calm, Ye Xuan did not dare to make the first move.

At this moment, the atmosphere was frozen, and it seemed that they were fighting with their wills instead of bodies. No one chose to take the initiative to attack.

At this moment, both sides had the same thought, which was, “If he doesn’t make a move, then I won’t make a move.”

Seeing that the two of them still maintained their silence, everyone’s hearts were gripped by suspense.

“Damn… they’re still going at it…”

“His reputation of being a peerless expert is really not just for show. If it were me, I might have already finished fighting.”

At this moment, everyone was full of admiration. In a battle between two top-tier experts, the first step was to be cautious.

Unprecedented silence filled the air, and even the sound of breathing could be heard. The terrifying auras of the two experts continued to collide in the sky.

Then suddenly a loud explosion was heard, shattering the silence. After hearing this, Ye Xuan and the Thunder-Devouring Beast were both shocked and their bodies trembled.

“He finally made a move!”

“It finally moved!”

Both of them had noticed each other’s trembling and subconsciously thought that the party was about to attack. The stalemate was broken by the sudden explosion, and both of them launched attacks at the same time, wanting to take the initiative.

At this moment, the entire world trembled as a purple lightning tornado appeared. At the same time, Ye Xuan flung the Godsword into the sky, creating an equally terrifying tornado of sword qi.

“Oh my god! Are they using their killer moves right from the get-go?”

Seeing such a terrifying battle, the audience was dumbstruck.

In an instant, the world turned dark as endless bolts of lightning struck from above.

Since they had already started fighting, there was no turning back. When in doubt, go all out!

Their thoughts coincided, which made for a shocking scene.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast raised its head and roared, causing space to crack inch by inch. Bolts of purple divine lightning kept flashing toward Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan did not choose to meet its attacks head on, but instead used the Godsword to deflect the lightning to the side. Explosions rang out all over the ancient palace when the deflected lightning bolts hit the ground, causing the ground to tremble and quake.

Everyone present turned pale with fright.

“This is simply unbelievable. Just how powerful are they? At this rate, they are going to destroy the ancient palace!”

Even the sealed immortal realm experts were shocked. They had guessed that this battle would be very fierce, but it even exceeded their expectations.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Xuan and the Thunder-Devouring Beast had already exchanged hundreds of blows.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s confidence was rising. He was originally afraid that this beast would be very powerful, so he did not use his full strength and quietly waited for it to reveal its flaws.

So rather than attack and face it head on, he had been deflecting and dodging attacks. This made the Thunder-Devouring Beast become even more confident. It even thought to itself, ‘Oh my god! Have I actually become so powerful?’

After realizing that it had the upper hand, the Thunder-Devouring Beast became more and more aggressive.
