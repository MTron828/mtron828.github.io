438 A Hundred Thousand Years’ Worth Of Cultivation!

“My precious disciple, quickly sit down. Let’s get started.”

Ye Xuan gestured for Zhuge Yueyue to sit down cross-legged, then placed his palm on her back.

Moments later, his spiritual power surged out and turned into a warm current that entered Zhuge Yueyue’s body.

Every inch of Zhuge Yueyue’s meridians and pores were filled with Ye Xuan’s spiritual power. Her face displayed a pained expression.

!!

Fortunately, Ye Xuan was prepared and broke down his spiritual power into smaller, more digestible portions to help her absorb it faster.

Also, since this was not her first time, she knew what to expect and could refine the spiritual power more smoothly.

As time passed, and Zhuge Yue’s body trembled, her cultivation level rose rapidly.

Third level of the materialization realm! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Fourth level of the materialization realm!

Fifth level of the materialization realm!

Sixth level of the materialization realm!

Seventh level of the materialization realm!

Eighth level of the materialization realm!

Within just a short period of time she had reached the eight level of the materialization realm! She was shocked.

This would have normally taken her at least three years.

“Wait… It doesn’t seem to be over yet…”

After Zhuge Yueyue broke through to the eighth level of the materialization realm, there were still remnants of Ye Xuan’s spiritual power in her body.

Without any hesitation, Zhuge Yueyue activated the power of her profound ice divine bone and continued the absorption process.

With Ye Xuan’s help, she perfectly absorbed all the spiritual power that Ye Xuan had poured into her.

Then, a cracking sound came from within Zhuge Yueyue’s body. A bright light erupted, and then she reached the ninth level of the materialization realm!

She was now only a step away from the void realm.

Of course, this was already Zhuge Yue’s current limit. After this, she would only need to comprehend the power of the laws to reach the void realm.

It was a pity that Zhuge Yueyue did not have the opportunity like Hua Rufeng to enter a state of epiphany to comprehend the power of laws.

However, she was already quite satisfied with the progress of her breakthrough.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan also stopped pouring in spiritual power.

He could clearly sense that the meridians in Zhuge Yueyue’s body had already reached a point of saturation. If he continued to pour spiritual power into her, it was very likely that it would damage her cultivation foundation.

“Hold your breath and focus, do not move.”

“You’ve just made several breakthroughs, so you have to stabilize your cultivation foundation.”

Ye Xuan quickly instructed her, and then stood up and walked to the other side of the lake.

“Teacher…”

At this moment, Feng Xiyun also walked over. She was when she saw Zhuge Yueyue sitting cross-legged by the lake.

“Senior Sister, did something happen? Why did I sense a powerful aura just now?”

“Xiyun, good timing. I have to go out and take care of some matters. Your senior sister is currently stabilizing her cultivation foundation, so you should protect her.”

“After she awakens, you can continue with your own cultivation.”

“I will probably be in secluded cultivation for a few days.”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Feng Xiyun did not ask too many questions.

Ye Xuan turned around and left.

Feng Xiyun looked at her teacher’s back as he left. Then, she went over to Zhuge Yueyue’s side.

When Ye Xuan returned to his room, the system’s notification rang out.

“Ding! The host has infused 1,000 years’ worth of cultivation into his disciple and has received a randomized 100x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 100,000 years’ worth of cultivation!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan almost jumped up in excitement. This would likely help him to reach the advanced stage of the mystic lord realm, right?

As for breaking through to the next major realm, Ye Xuan did not even dare to think about it. His current cultivation foundation had yet to be solidified, so breaking through like that would be extremely dangerous.

Moments later, a surging warm current appeared out of nowhere and frantically poured into Ye Xuan’s body.

“Let’s go!”

Although he was already mentally prepared, Ye Xuan still could not help but grit his teeth and cry out in pain.

The density of spiritual power was simply unimaginable, and it filled all of Ye Xuan’s meridians and pores in an instant.

This powerful spiritual power was expanding his meridians. He felt like he had entered a furnace. His body glowed red, and his face was full of pain, as if he was being bitten by countless ants.
