686 Zhuge Yueyue’s Trump Card

Logically speaking, the Hell Slash should be stronger than the Beast Gaze, but the latter’s ability to devour the power of the Hell Slash had negated that advantage.

Seeing that he had forced Zhuge Yueyue to retreat, Xie Tianyu laughed heartily.

“Zhuge Yueyue, there is only one result today, and that is that you will definitely lose!”

“I’ll return the humiliation you made me suffer back then to you tenfold today!”

!!

As soon as he finished speaking, Xie Tianyu immediately directed the ferocious beast to try and bite Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue did not choose to take it head-on, and dodged it by a hair’s breadth.

However, if she could not defeat this ferocious beast, she would really lose today.

Left with no choice, she focused herself and held the Cloud Sky Sword in front of her chest.

Moments later, thunderclouds filled the sky, and angry rumblings could be heard overhead.

“What exactly is she trying to do?”

Then, they saw a door that exuded an ancient aura appear in the sky.

Eh?

Was this not the technique that Ye Xuan was famous for using?

“It’s actually this move?”

“Oh my god, is this for real?”

Everyone looked at Ye Xuan in unison, hoping to glean some information from his reaction.

However, Ye Xuan did not say a word. Instead, there was a faint smile on his face, as if he had already expected this to happen.

Daoist Gu Hao’s expression instantly darkened.

Although he had yet to personally witness Ye Xuan using this move, he had heard rumors about it, as it had ended the lives of Elder Taiyin and Mo Nan.

No one had expected Zhuge Yueyue to have learnt this move.

When the door in the sky appeared, the scene seemed to reach a climax.

Ye Xuan was smiling as he enjoyed the shocked expressions of the crowd. He had taught her the Flora Sword technique in preparation for the gathering several days ago.

However, due to the complexity of the technique, he chose to pick a single powerful move, and then simplified it to make it easier for her to comprehend.

Although it had been simplified, its strength still exceeded the level of power a heaven-grade divine power could display.

“If it’s really that move, then the outcome of this fight has been decided.”

“I can’t believe Ye Xuan taught it to her. That’s his signature move!”

Gao Shun was already jumping up and down with excitement.

“Junior Brother Ye, I really didn’t expect you to teach her this move. You really put in a lot of effort for this gathering.”

Yuelun smiled as she said this. She actually admired Ye Xuan for doing this. It was rare for a teacher to impart such a powerful technique to their disciple without conditions.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan turned around to look at Yuelun and said, “Senior Sister Yuelun, if you want to learn this move, I can actually teach it to you.”

Yuelun’s heart trembled unconsciously when she inadvertently met Ye Xuan’s gaze.

After a moment of shock, Yuelun replied, “I’d better not. After all, my talent does not lie in the Sword Dao.”

Some distance away, Daoist Gu Hao’s face was as black as night.

“How is this possible? How did she manage to learn such a powerful technique?”

He had thought of ten thousand possibilities, but he had not expected Zhuge Yueyue to suddenly display Ye Xuan’s signature move. Was that not being too generous?

Ye Xuan just glanced at him disdainfully and said, “Seeing is believing. Just because you can’t master something doesn’t mean that others can’t.”

“Therefore, while you are still alive, you should choose to pass these things on to the next generation and create a legacy for the future.”

Upon hearing this, Daoist Gu Hao’s heart trembled.

He turned around and looked at Daoist Black Iron with mixed feelings.

Back then, when he had taught the Supreme Divine sect’s cornerstone technique to Daoist Black Iron, he had withheld a portion of the technique.

He did not teach the Beast Gaze to Daoist Black Iron either. He only taught it to Li Hong and Xie Tianyu.

After all, these two disciples were far weaker than he was. It was a different case for Daoist Black Iron, who was a peak-level mystic lord realm cultivator. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

If Daoist Black Iron broke through and reached the supreme realm, his status and position in the sect would be threatened.

It was precisely for this reason that he held back when teaching Daoist Black Iron.

The relationship between Daoist Black Iron and Daoist Gu Hao was similar to that of Elder Taiyin and Mo Nan of the Immortal Divine sect.
