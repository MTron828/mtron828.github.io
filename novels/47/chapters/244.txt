Chapter 245: Qian Daoliu’s Main Body

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

Moments later, his spatial intent swept out, confining the blood-red droplets.

However, there were countless blood-red droplets, and some escaped.

As a single drop escaped, Qian Daoliu could use it to restore his body.

This was his final trump card. He would never use it unless it was a life and death situation.

After all, even if he managed to escape, his cultivation foundation would suffer damage. However, he was reluctant to abandon this clone and the memories within it.

Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!

In an extremely obscure place, three blood-red drops flew towards the depths of the chaotic space.

Buzzzzzz!

However, at this moment, two powerful forces suddenly descended and stopped them.

“Jun Lingtian!”

“Zhao Yuzhen!”

“You’re seeking death!”

At the same time, Qian Daoliu’s furious voice resounded from the three blood-red droplets.

Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen had jumped on the opportunity to help Ye Xuan.

After all, their goal this time was to make friends with Ye Xuan, and it would be best if he owed them a favor.

Now was the best time to act.

Although they knew that Ye Xuan had comprehended spatial intent, and had likely noticed the three blood-red droplets, in order to prevent any accidents, they still chose to take action.

“This is yours!”

Immediately, Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen threw the three blood-colored droplets to Ye Xuan.

Seeing this, the azure divine sword in Ye Xuan’s hand was swung again, instantly devouring the three blood-red droplets.

“Jun Lingtian!”

“Zhao Yuzhen!”

“Ye Xuan!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Very good, you actually dared to destroy my clone!”

“I’ll definitely repay this grudge in the future! You guys won’t be able to escape death!”

After the three drops of blood were destroyed, Qian Daoliu’s clone’s soul appeared in the void, and his rage-filled voice rang out.

Soon, Qian daoliu’s soul was also devoured by the destructive power of heavenly lightning.

The master of the Blood Moon Temple had fallen!

Although Qian Daoliu had fallen, the words he had uttered before his death were concerning.

“Just a clone?”

Jun Lingtian’s eyes narrowed.

Beside him, Zhao Yuzhen’s gaze was also flickering. He had known Jun Lingtian for hundreds of years, but he had never seen him look so serious.

Ye Xuan also frowned.

Qian Daoliu, who was a three-pattern condensation realm expert, was only a clone?

‘Wait a minute! This guy’s aura seemed to be quite similar to the blood-colored energy ball that Ming He possessed.’

‘Could it be that it was from the same person?’

‘Could it be that the owner of this aura also wanted to devour Ming He’s body with a wisp of its soul and cultivate another clone?’

Thinking this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

At this moment, he finally understood why he had sensed danger from Qian Daoliu!

The source of threat did not come from Qian Daoliu, but from his main body!

If a mere clone had such terrifying strength, then what level had the main body reached?

However, he was not too worried. Qian Daoliu’s main body might be very powerful, but he definitely would not reach the Great Qian dynasty anytime soon. After all, the main body had not appeared anytime during their month-long battle.

From Qian Daoliu’s earlier words, he probabl;y wanted to devour Ye Xuan and turn him into a clone.

Qian Daoliu’s body was either really far away, or was being restrained by some kind of restriction.

Ye Xuan had the system, so as long as he was given enough time, his strength would naturally grow rapidly. Furthermore, the battle had gone on for a month, so the cooldown period for the system’s rewards from his disciples had reset, which would boost his strength even more.

“Thank you for your help!”

Ye Xuan looked at Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen, and nodded politely.

Ye Xuan had already guessed their purpose. They obviously wanted to make friends with him and gain his favor.

It was not surprising that his talent had attracted the attention of these big shots.

However, they were now convinced by his strength as well.

Even Jun Lingtian was doubting his previous conjecture. He was unsure as to whether the reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert could be this monstrous.

It seemed that he had to find time to return to the Divine Gate Holy Land to do more research.

“Brother Ye, you’re too polite!”

Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen laughed.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

Brother Ye?

These two big shots had both lived for hundreds of years, yet they were calling him brother?

Truly shameless!

Still, Ye Xuan did not reject their goodwill.

After all, having more friends was naturally a good thing.
