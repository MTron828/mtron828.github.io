388 Handsome Kid, Are You All Bark And No Bite?

“So you’re saying that you want to be my big brother?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan chuckled.

In the past 100 years, although he had not left the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he had long heard that the descendants of the powerful families of the Yangli divine empire were extremely foppish. After seeing two of them in person, he totally agreed with the sentiment.

They were just a bunch of protected flowers that grew up in a greenhouse. They had never experienced the hardships of the world and thought that they could look down on everything by relying on the strength of their families.

It was truly lamentable!

“Do you think you have the right?” Ye Xuan smiled, but his eyes suddenly turned cold.

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense was observing the actions of the ape beast. Although it had gone berserk, it was still a descendant of an ancient beast and could not be underestimated. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Yuelun saw this, she took a step back.

Charlot’s words just now had indeed made her unhappy, but in comparison, she was more interested in seeing Ye Xuan’s cultivation level.

If Ye Xuan could not defeat them, she would step in.

“What’s wrong? You dare to refuse me?”

Charlot flew into a rage when he heard this.

At this moment, Yuelun’s lips curled into an arc as she directly added fuel to the fire.

“This little handsome guy is quite good-looking, but is he all bark and no bite?”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

This damn woman was stirring up trouble. She had ignited the fire of that good-for-nothing young master.

As expected, Charlot immediately jumped up in excitement when he heard Yuelun’s words.

“What kind of joke is that? There’s no way I wouldn’t dare to act!”

“I’d like to see what abilities you have. You might’ve fooled Su Changhe, but you won’t fool me!”

“Report your name. I don’t kill nameless people!”

“Oh?” Ye Xuan looked at Charlot indifferently and said with a faint smile.

“Great Wilderness Divine sect, Ye Xuan!”

“What?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Charlot’s expression changed. He drew in a deep breath of cold air. The surrounding cultivators were also shocked when they heard this.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect was a top-tier holy land.

Even when ranked within the entire East continent, it was a behemoth. Even the royal family of the Yangli divine empire, let alone the other major families within it.

What should he do now?

If a fight broke out, the Xia family would not be able to withstand the wrath of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

However, if he backed down now, he would lose his dignity. Furthermore, he would probably be laughed at by Su Changhe for years if that happened.

Charlot felt remorseful, but at the same time, he also felt a little hopeful.

If the other party was just an ordinary cultivator from the Great Wilderness Divine sect, it would not matter if he killed him. The Great Wilderness Divine sect would not hold the Xia family responsible for the death of an ordinary disciple.

“Hmph! Do you really think that you can scare me by using the name of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

“You’re just an ordinary disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Even if I kill you, no one will care.”

Charlot forced himself to remain calm as he sneered.

At this moment, Yuelun’s voice rang out once again.

“Handsome kid, you may not know this, but this guy is not an ordinary disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. He is one of the seven chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and the master of Cloud Sky peak.”

Charlot was dumbfounded when he heard this.

F*ck!

He was done for!

‘What? That guy is actually a chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?!’

When Su Changhe heard this, he sucked in a breath of cold air and rejoiced.

Fortunately, he was not the one who provoked Ye Xuan. Otherwise, not only would he be dead, but the Su family would be doomed as well.

‘Hahaha! Charlot, you’re dead for sure now, aren’t you?’

‘Daring to provoke such a person is equivalent to offending the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect! Your Xia family is worthless in comparison!’

Su Changhe was relieved, but also frustrated.

After all, he had just expressed in front of Ye Xuan that he was a filial son who respected his elders.

If the other party were to discover his lies one day, his entire family might be uprooted.

Su Changhe felt terrible at the thought of this.

“Young master!”

After learning of Ye Xuan’s identity, the two old men behind Charlot quickly walked over and pulled him back.

One of the old men had a serious expression on his face as he bowed to Ye Xuan apologetically.

“This old man greets Lord Ye Xuan. My young master has unintentionally offended you. I hope you can forgive his mistake on account of his youthful ignorance!”

“Oh?” Ye Xuan smiled and with a playful look in his eyes.

“You seem to have gotten the wrong person. I should be the one saying this!”

“I was just thinking about how I should beg for Young Master Xia’s forgiveness. Why did you put the cart before the horse?”

Hearing this, the old man’s expression changed.

He understood what Ye Xuan was implying.

As soon as he finished speaking, the other old man immediately became somewhat displeased.

“Elder Ye Xuan, don’t go too far. Although our young master is indeed in the wrong he has already apologized. The Great Wilderness Divine sect may be powerful, but our Xia family is not a pushover.”

“Hmph! If I want to use force, what can you do?”

Ye Xuan’s gaze suddenly turned cold. First, he signaled Zhuge Yueyue to take a step back, and then a powerful aura erupted from his body.

The terrifying power of his heaven realm cultivation swept across the surroundings.

When the two old men saw this, their expressions changed drastically. They quickly rushed over to protect Charlot behind them, and also released the power of their heaven cultivation realm.

Ye Xuan took a step forward. His eyes shone with bright divine light. His entire being seemed to be as sharp as a sword. With just a slight movement of his palm, the plants in the surroundings were sliced in half, and a strong gust of wind arose.
