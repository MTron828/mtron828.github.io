Shan Ling’s combat power had been greatly enhanced by close to a hundred-fold, and Yanran could sense that clearly. As such she was very worried.

She did not know exactly how strong Ye Xuan was, but she did not want him to fight it alone. As such, she raised her hands and began to perform various seals.

Suddenly, a lotus flower emitting seven-colored divine light appeared and floated in the sky.

“What is she doing?”

Yanran’s action attracted everyone’s attention. As the seven-colored divine light shone, the sky suddenly shook violently.

At this moment, Shan Ling raised his head calmly and looked at the door in the sky arrogantly.

“Hahaha! Did you call for help? Even if you really called those old monsters of the Great Wilderness Divine sect over, I’m not afraid.”

At this moment, Shan Ling was full of confidence in his own strength, believing that he could deal with anyone who came.

However, at this moment, when the door opened wide, three figures shuttled in from the Heavenly Dao World.

Taking a closer look, one could see that the figures slowly materialized into three extremely handsome young men in white robes.

The man standing at the front was expressionless, but his eyes were full of arrogance. He was the first to speak.

“Shan Ling? It’s actually you, old demon…”

The man beside him looked even more refined. He held a paper fan in his hand and said with a frown, “It’s actually the scent of the blood race. The elder’s words were indeed correct. This old monster is actually related to the blood race.”

“Haha, who cares about the blood race? They’re just trash who are not worthy of my attention at all,” the final one chimed in.

After arriving in the sky above the East Sea, Li Xuanzhen first turned to Yanran. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Sister Yanran, I’ve long heard about your existence. Seeing you myself today, I have to say that you really live up to your reputation.”

“Senior Brother, what are you talking about? It’s us who are grateful for your assistance today.”

“Haha, I’ve long heard the elders mention you to me. That our Great Wilderness Divine sect has a peerless genius on this continent who has obtained our the Saintess’ inheritance.”

“Junior Sister’s shocking talent is really amazing,” Li Xuanzhen praised her with a serious expression.

Hearing these praises, Yanran nodded slightly, but did not continue the conversation.

At this moment, Ou Tian also approached. He looked at Yanran with a complicated expression. After calming down for a moment, he said arrogantly, “Junior Sister Yanran, the elder ordered us to come here and help you kill an enemy. Is the enemy this old demon?”

Ou Tian looked at Shan Ling once again and said with disdain, “We came here just because of this old bag of bones? Could it be that you can’t even beat him?”

After hearing this, the atmosphere instantly became solemn, and Yanran’s expression turned cold.

She could clearly sense the arrogance in Ou Tian’s words. He was not only looking down on Shan Ling, but also on them.

Perhaps summoning them was a mistake. This fellow was really getting on her nerves. On the other hand, the other two, Li Xuanzhen and Nanfeng, were both regretting bringing Ou Tian along.

Originally, this matter was something that could be easily resolved. However, after Ou Tian’s arrival, it was very likely that the situation would develop into something else entirely.

“Ah, right, right. With your current combat strength, it’s indeed very difficult to kill this old demon.”

Seeing that Yanran had not spoken, Ou Tian mocked her again.

“Since things have already reached this stage, I will graciously help you resolve this mess.”

As soon as he finished his words, all the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were furious.

“Damn it! He’s simply too arrogant!”

“Aren’t you a little too bold? You actually dare to look down on us like this? What makes you think that you’re superior to us?”

Even Gao Shun could not hold it in anymore. He said in exasperation, “Hmph! This guy is too pretentious. Could it be that all the young geniuses of the Great Wilderness Divine sect from the Heavenly Dao World are like this?”

Hearing his words, Ao Lei, who had arrived with Ye Xuan earlier, rolled his eyes at Gao Shun, indicating for the latter not to take things too far.

After all, these people were indeed more powerful than they were.

Ao Lei eventually stopped the others from speaking and walked to the front.

“The three of you…”

Before Ao Lei could say anything, Li Xuanzhen and the others trembled when they saw him. They were extremely shocked, and even a little afraid, and one of them even muttered, “Big Chang…”

Before he could say the last word, he immediately covered his mouth.

Ao Lei was not sure what was going on, but could tell that something unusual was going on. Even Ou Tian, who had been arrogant just a moment ago, was no longer so impudent.
