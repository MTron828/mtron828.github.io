Ye Xuan was not worried about the safety of Zhao Yuyan and the others.

After all, Zhao Yuyan had the protection of the firewing! In addition, this little girl’s storage bracelet still had the jade tokens he had refined for her.

However, when Zhao Yuyan heard this, her eyes dimmed and her expression turned sad.

“Little girl, keep this Nihility pill well. In 30 days, you will have to consume it. It will once again suppress the Demon Devourer Body!”

“I cannot guarantee when I will arrive at the Radiant Sky Empire or the White Moon Tower. Of course, if I manage to find you within 30 days, there is no need to consume the Nihility pill.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out the Nihility pill and handed it to Zhao Yuyan.

However, Zhao Yuyan did not take it. Instead, she lowered her head. Her body trembled slightly, and her eyes stared at the ground beneath her feet.

Moments later, Zhao Yuyan pounced on Ye Xuan and hugged him tightly, unwilling to let go at all.

“Teacher…”

Zhao Yuyan said with a choked voice.

“Silly girl, after the mystic realm closes, I will definitely come to pick you up as soon as possible. Don’t worry, we won’t be separated for too long!”

Ye Xuan smiled and rubbed Zhao Yuyan’s tiny head.

Hearing this, Zhao Yuyan raised her head and looked at Ye Xuan with a face full of reluctance.

“You must remember what I said. The Demon Devourer Body will no longer affect the cultivators around you. If someone dares to cause trouble for you, you can’t allow them to bully you!”

“Don’t forget! You still have my demon beast companion by your side. He’s very powerful!”

Ye Xuan reached out to wipe away the tears from Zhao Yuyan’s eyes. Then, he took out a jade token from his storage ring and imprinted it with his spiritual sense.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan handed the jade token over to Zhao Yuyan.

Although this jade token did not have the power to kill, its deterrent effect was extremely strong.

“This jade token contains the power of my spiritual sense. If you encounter an enemy that even your demon beast companion is unable to handle, immediately crush it. I will definitely sense it!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze was gentle as he said this.

Once this jade token was crushed, the aura inside would instantly be released.

At that time, the enemy would face Ye Xuan’s aura, which would deter them from attacking Zhao Yuyan.

Other than her parents, Ye Xuan was the first person to display warmth toward her.

It was also because of this that Zhao Yuyan did not want to leave Ye Xuan’s side. She wished that Ye Xuan would be able to stay by her side forever, and return to the White Moon Tower with her to visit and take her mother away.

“Little girl, you must remember what I said. Do not expose your storage bracelet in front of others!”

“After you enter the War God Hall, if anyone dares to bully you, release your demon beast companion and teach them a lesson! However, you must not kill them, otherwise you will be punished by the War God Hall!”

“As for the Tower of Heaven, do not go there! Your current cultivation level is insufficient, and your control over your own strength is lacking. Even if you challenge the Tower of Heaven, it’s unlikely that you will obtain any generous rewards!”

“Just stay in the War God Hall and wait for the mystic realm to close,” Ye Xuan said.

“Okay, little girl, stop crying and remember my instructions.”

Ye Xuan wiped Zhao Yuyan’s tears away again.

“Yes! Yan’er will heed Teacher’s instructions!”

Zhao Yuyan nodded with a choked voice. Although she let go of Ye Xuan’s hand, she was still clutching his robe.

Seeing this, Yue hurried over and held Zhao Yuyan’s other hand with a gentle gaze.

Boom!

At the same time, the rippling mysterious fluctuations became even more intense.

Moments later, a terrifying suction force suddenly swept out, pulling everyone inside.

Even Ye Xuan was unable to resist!

“Little girl! You must remember what I said!”

Ye Xuan glanced at Zhao Yuyan and only had time to say those words. Then, his entire body was enveloped by blinding light, and disappeared.

This happened to every cultivator in the mystic realm at the same time.

Just like when he entered the mystic realm, when light subsided, Ye Xuan found himself in an unfamiliar space.

The world was white, and so was everything he could see.

Not far from Ye Xuan, countless cultivators appeared, bringing color to this vast white space.

Ye Xuan examined his surroundings for a moment. Yue and the others were not in this space, and neither were the cultivators of the Qingyun sect.

In another space, a mysterious wave slowly rippled out.

Zhao Yuyan suddenly landed in a space inside the War God Hall. At the same time, she suddenly felt that her palm was empty.

Teacher was gone!

Senior Sister Yue was gone, and so was Senior Sister Huang Ling!

At that moment, Zhao Yuyan was at a loss. The cultivators around her were all unfamiliar faces, and she was like a little girl lost in a mall without her parents.

“You jinx, how dare you come to the War God Hall!”

At this moment, an ear-piercing voice suddenly rang out!

Zhao Yuyan was startled when she heard this, and she quickly looked up at the source of the voice.

Less than 20 meters away, a female cultivator was looking at her coldly.

“Li… Senior Sister Li…”

Zhao Yuyan recognized the female cultivator, who was also a cultivator from the White Moon Tower. Moreover, she was one of the female cultivators who had surrounded her outside the forest earlier.

Her name was Li Xueyan, and she was a third-level true essence realm cultivator!

“I’m really unlucky to have run into a jinx like you in the War God Hall!”

Li Xueyan’s gaze landed on Zhao Yuyan. Her eyes were filled with disdain. Then, she quickly tiptoed and distanced herself from Zhao Yuyan.

“You guys have to be careful. Don’t get close to this jinx, or you’ll be in big trouble!”

“There were many people close to the jinx earlier. Just know that all kinds of disasters can and will befall you. I’ve already warned you guys, you can do what you want with that information.”

Li Xueyan retreated dozens of meters and then reminded the people around her in a sharp tone.

“What? You said that this little girl is a jinx?”

Hearing this, everyone had puzzled expressions.

However, when they noticed Li Xueyan’s expression, their eyes immediately narrowed.

They secretly guessed that this little girl might have a cursed item.
