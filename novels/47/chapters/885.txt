886 Success

With the Dao Flower’s help, Ao Lei would not have to go through the difficult process of Dao completion when he broke through to the sealed immortal realm.

All he needed to do was accumulate his cultivation foundation until it reached that level.

Actually, Ye Xuan had just thought of this method, and was just testing it out. He had not expected it to actually succeed, and was beside himself with excitement.

The method Ye Xuan used on Ao Lei was actually not much different from the method he chose when he stepped into the sealed immortal realm, just that he was using his own foundation to establish Ao Lei’s.

That being said, although Ao Lei would not have to complete his Dao, if he went in the wrong cultivation direction in the future, he might face a huge crisis if he was not careful.

Fortunately, this was the Dao Flower Ye Xuan condensed using the mysteries of the Eternal Light technique and the Chaos Immortal Peach, which were quite accommodating to most cultivation paths. This would make Ao Lei’s future path easier.

At this moment, Ye Xuan once again erupted with strength and shouted, “Suppress!”

Ao Lei’s face instantly turned pale and powerless. He felt as if countless needles were pricking his organs, and the pain was unbearable.

However, the Dao flower in his sea of consciousness suddenly released a burst of divine light, constantly purifying the power aura in his body. Once he realized what was happening, Ao Lei was ecstatic.

“It actually succeeded!”

“This…”

Yuelun was shocked. She did not understand what Ye Xuan had done, but she could tell that the demonic power in Ao Lei’s body was on the verge of being destroyed.

As such, a wave of relief washed over her, and the burden on her heart was lifted.

“Well done, Junior Brother Ye. You managed to resolve such a thorny problem!”

Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan with admiration and adoration as she spoke. The man she fell for was really quite awesome.

After some time passed, the demonic power in Ao Lei’s body was completely purified.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up as he said, “Senior Brother Ao, now is the time. Concentrate and absorb all of this power!”

Ao Lei was taken aback. Power? What power?

Moments later, Ao Lei felt a hand on his back, and then immediately felt an immense amount of spiritual power injected into his body, causing it to bulge and bloat.

“F*ck… So much!”

He snapped back to his senses and hurriedly began to absorb the power, which caused his cultivation level to start rising rapidly.

Within moments, he was on the verge of breaking through to the ancient realm. He had never expected to get stronger so quickly.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan retracted his palm and said, “Senior Brother Ao, I’ll leave this power to you to refine. It will depend on your own efforts as to how much you can improve.”

Ao Lei did not reply. Instead, he tried his best to refine the power, well aware that this power was the opportunity that Ye Xuan had given him in order to help him break through and reach the ancient realm.

He was extremely grateful, but due to the current situation, he had to focus his attention on refining the power. Therefore, he simply engraved this kindness into his heart.

After a while, Ao Lei fell into a mysterious state. The power the Ye Xuan had given him was constantly transforming the Dao Flower in his sea of consciousness.

Ye Xuan knew that once Ao Lei woke up, he would be an ancient realm cultivator. As for whether he reached the early stage or peak of the ancient realm, that would depend on himself.

“I’m so tired…”

After channeling so much power and circulating his cultivation technique for such a long time, he was already very tired.

When Yuelun saw this, she smiled and went over to him, massaging his shoulders.

“Junior Brother Ye, since you’ve worked so hard, I’ll let you enjoy my special massage service.”

The strength she used was just right, which caused Ye Xuan to involuntarily let out a comfortable moan.

“Mmm, this is great.”

He enjoyed the massage for some time, before suddenly pulling her into his arms. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Senior Sister Yuelun, you’ve been tired from standing watch, so let me massage you now.”

Yuelun’s face instantly turned red after hearing this. She then turned around and looked in Ao Lei’s direction. Thankfully, his eyes were tightly shut and he still seemed to be in that mysterious state.

However, his presence here still made the atmosphere feel awkward.

When she turned back around and met Ye Xuan’s gaze, her heart could not help but beat wildly. She could only resign herself to fate and wait for what was about to happen.

‘Could it be that Junior Brother Ye is going to make a move on me here? That’s not too good. Senior Brother Ao is still sitting beside us. If he suddenly wakes up, how embarrassing would that be?’

As her heart was beating wildly, she suddenly felt a pair of warm hands pressing on her shoulders.

“Huh… Ah!”

She suddenly felt a surge of power pouring into her body, shocking her. She immediately looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief. Was this the massage?

What was with the power flowing into her body?

While she was in a daze, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Don’t be silly. Hurry up and refine this power.”

“Uh, oh… Alright.”
