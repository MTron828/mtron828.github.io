677 Heart-Questioning (Part 1)

Shangguan Qing’s arrogance had long disappeared, and he was on the verge of tears.

After her battle with Xie Tianyu at the ancient tomb, Zhuge Yueyue was now a famous person. Not only was she strong, but she was also Chief Ye Xuan’s disciple. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

‘It’s over. Why am I so unlucky?’

‘What should I do?’

He stood there in a daze, which left Zhuge Yueyue puzzled.

“Hey! Are you going to fight or not?”

Hearing this, Shangguan Qing became even more nervous. After a while, he forced a smile onto his face.

“Uh, let’s not fight?”

Shangguan Qing also knew that there was no way he could defeat Zhuge Yueyue. Instead of suffering at her hands, it was better to end this on his own terms.

He said, “You don’t have to waste your energy. Let me do it myself.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shangguan Qing raised his hand and slapped himself on the head, instantly eliminating himself.

Zhuge Yueyue was left dumbfounded.

“…”

The battle had not even started yet. Could it be that he did not want to even give it a try? Could it be that these people were afraid of pain?

That was the only possibility, right?

Being slashed by her Cloud Sky Sword would indeed be quite painful. In any case, it saved her some effort, so she did not dwell on the matter.

Moments later, fate energy emerged from the spot where Shangguan Qing had disappeared, which then surged into her body.

At the same time, Zhuge Yueyue’s name appeared at the bottom of the ranking list.

“She finally showed up.”

The moment they saw Zhuge Yueyue’s name, many people shouted in surprise.

Gao Shun became excited.

“Do you see now? I did say that she would be able to climb the rankings. I really didn’t misjudge her.”

Looking at Gao Shun shouting happily, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.

Was Zhuge Yueyue his disciple or Gao Shun’s?

“Senior Brother Gao, did you make a mistake?”

“It isn’t Gao Tianyu on the rankings, but my disciple. Why are you so happy?” Ye Xuan asked, sweating profusely.

“Hahaha, I’m just happy for you! It doesn’t matter if Tianyu gets on the rankings or not. After all, I did not have expectations for him to become the champion,” Gao Shun said these words without a care.

Uh, was Gao Tianyu really his son?

Ye Xuan was very helpless at this moment and did not know what to say to him.

Just as everyone was discussing this matter animatedly, the potential ranking list was refreshed again.

“Oh my god! She’s risen to 56th place so quickly?”

Because Zhuge Yueyue could easily finish off her enemies every time, her ranking was rising rapidly.

If this situation continued, it would not be long before she reached the top ten. Based on the numbers, Zhuge Yueyue’s potential value was 49,000 points.

Mu Beichen had 85,000 points, and the Reincarnation Fairy had 80,000 points.

Seeing this, Daoist Gu Hao’s expression became even gloomier. He turned around and looked at Daoist Black Iron.

“The next stage is the heart-questioning stage. I think you know what to do next without me telling you, right?”

Daoist Black Iron hurriedly nodded and replied, “I understand. I’ll do it immediately. ”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took out a communication talisman and sent a message into the ancient realm.

Inside, Zhuge Yueyue had already arrived at a vast open space.

As she did not choose to climb up together with the first group of people at the beginning. Mu Beichen and the other frontrunners had already entered the stage after this.

She did not recognize any of the cultivators in this space with her.

However, when these cultivators saw Zhuge Yueyue, all of them were shocked.

At this moment, one of the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples, who had started climbing with Xie Tianyu, received the communication transmission. He glared fiercely at Zhuge Yue Yue.

“Let’s not act rashly and watch. Many people get stuck at this stage, so it’s best if we can stall for time.”

“If she really can pass through the heart-questioning stage, then we’ll attack immediately.”

This person from the Supreme Divine sect made a suggestion, and the other sect disciples hurriedly nodded.

Zhuge Yueyue had also noticed the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples thanks to their attire after entering the space. However, she only frowned slightly and ignored them.

Moments later, she walked up to a huge boulder without hesitation and transferred her spiritual power into it.

A beam of light appeared in front of the boulder. An old man with a sage-like appearance was now standing in front of the stone platform, looking at Zhuge Yueyue with a kind gaze.

The old man stroked his long white beard and asked, “May I ask, do you know what Dao is?”

Dao?

This question was neither difficult nor easy. After all, different people had different answers.

At this moment, the screen of light outside was projecting Zhuge Yueyue’s situation in real-time, allowing everyone to witness her answer.

“Hehe, if I’m not wrong, she won’t be able to answer this at all,” Daoist Gu Hao said with a cold expression.
