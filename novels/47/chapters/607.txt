608 I’ll Plant One At Random

Seeing Xiang Yun’s evil laugh, Ye Xuan trembled subconsciously, feeling that something was wrong.

This little girl was not afraid of anyone, and she liked to fight. With this hammer, she would be even more arrogant. Would she cause him any trouble?

There should not be any big problems, right?

Ye Xuan could only think this way to himself. After all, this little girl was still young, so she should not be able to cause any big problems.

!!

He was already considered a peerless expert now, and there were very few situations that could cause him trouble.

“Ding! As you have given a magic hammer to your disciple, you have received a 10,000x critical reward!”

After hearing this notification, Ye Xuan was stunned, but then he laughed.

He had obtained this hammer from Ouyang Feng. He had wanted to give it to his two disciples to get a better one.

However, his two disciples did not like this hammer, so he failed to give it away.

In the end, his third disciple loved the hammer so much that she would not let go of it.

Ye Xuan was also very happy at this time. From now on, those heavy magic weapons would no longer be abandoned in a corner of his storage space. If he gave them to Xiang Yun, she would definitely like them.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained a heaven-grade magical treasure, Thunderbolt Hammer!”

Ye Xuan did not know what to say when he saw the hammer that looked very much like a certain hammer from his previous world.

What was going on?

“Forget it, forget it. No matter what, it’s still a heaven-grade magic artifact,” Ye Xuan said to himself, not knowing how powerful the hammer was.

As long as he could use this thunder hammer to unleash bolts of lightning, he could even draw upon heavenly lightning to attack the enemy. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Its weight was terrifying too. Although the hammer did not look big, it weighed one million jin!

Ye Xuan did not plan on using the Thunderbolt Hammer himself, so he would leave it aside until Xiang Yun was strong enough to use it.

As for how and what she would use it for, he threw such concerns to the back of his mind.

Xiang Yun had boundless strength, and he was very optimistic about this disciple, even though this little disciple wanted him to sleep forever…

After swinging it for a while, Xiang Yun got used to the weight of the hammer. Even her strength seemed to have increased a little.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was very surprised. He looked at them and ordered, “Let’s stop here for now. All of you, go pack your things and move into your new houses.”

“Alright.”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun agreed. However, Xiang Yun had nothing to pack, so Ye Xuan brought her along with him.

After tidying up his belongings, Ye Xuan brought her to his teacher’s memorial tablet and offered incense to him. She was now officially a disciple of Cloud Sky peak.

After Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun tidied up their items, they moved into their new dwellings and then went over to Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan looked at his three disciples and nodded. “Since you’re all here, let’s begin.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan lit three more incense sticks on the memorial tablets of the past chiefs of Cloud Sky peak and said, “Ancestors, I’m the 18th chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan.”

“The new Cloud Sky Hall has been completed. Thus, I want to move this room to the new hall. Today, I have brought Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and Xiang Yun to offer incense to you and to let you know. If I have disturbed you, I hope you will not blame me.”

After the three incense sticks were lit, Ye Xuan looked up at the sky and said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan used his spiritual power to collect all of the memorial tablets. He also took the purple wind chime tree outside and flew to their new residence.

From this day on, Cloud Sky peak’s old courtyard, which had been around for a long time, would be relieved of its duty.

The new residence was built on higher ground with better feng shui, which bode well for Cloud Sky peak’s future. It was a good start.

After returning to the Cloud Sky Palace, ye Xuan placed the memorial tablets of all the previous grandmasters and once again lit incense for them.

After all this was done, Ye Xuan felt a lot more relaxed.

Then, he went to the garden and planted the purple wind chime in the most eye-catching position.

Ye Xuan turned around to look at his three disciples and said, “It’s done. This purple wind chime was planted by my teacher for me. It contains his expectations for me.”

“And today, I’m going to plant a tree for you three. I hope that you can grow up just like this tree, healthy and strong.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun nodded seriously. Even though Xiang Yun did not understand what this meant, she decided that it was wise to follow her senior sisters, so she quickly nodded.

When they learned that Ye Xuan was going to plant a tree for them, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were very curious, and started to discuss in soft voices.

“What kind of tree do you think our teacher will plant for us?”

“It should also be a purple wind chime, right?”

However, Zhuge Yueyue did not think so. She said, “That’s not possible. Our teacher doesn’t usually do things according to the rules. The purple wind chime was planted for him, so there’s no way he will copy Grandmaster Tian Xuan and use the same tree.”

“Could it be a spiritual plant?”

After the two of them discussed for a while, they could barely restrain their curiosity. Therefore, Feng Xiyun straightforwardly asked, “Teacher, what kind of tree do you want to plant for us?”

After Te Xuan had picked out a location to plant the tree, he replied with a smile, “It’s no big deal. I’m just planting them randomly. No matter what kind of tree it is, the most important thing is what it represents.”

After hearing this, the two of them nodded their heads.

No matter what kind of tree their teacher planted for them, they would definitely take good care of it and make it grow into a towering tree.

After all, this tree would contain his expectations for them.

Ye Xuan then took out the water cloud fruit sapling from his storage space.

“Oh my god…”

At first, the two of them had thought that it was just an ordinary tree. However, after seeing the sapling of the water cloud fruit tree, they were shocked…
