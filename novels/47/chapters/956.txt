957 The Strange Forest

“Every seal in this cave was prepared by the ancestor, and can only be removed with a specific method.”

After saying this, Huangfu Qi taught Ye Xuan each method. Ye Xuan only took a glance and grasped them all.

When he arrived in front of the cave, he immediately used what he had learned, and as expected, the seal on the cave’s door was removed.

However, Ye Xuan did not choose to trust Huangfu Qi completely, and thus kept him alive.

“Haha, old man, you’re not worthy of my trust. You guys spent so much effort to set up this trap, so there’s no way you’ll let me win so easily. There must be a secret that I don’t know about!”

“You don’t have to worry. I won’t let you die so quickly.”

“If I end up trapped inside, then you’ll have to suffer for all eternity.”

Huangfu Qi’s heart turned cold, and he knew that Ye Xuan was speaking the truth. Imagining reliving the torture he experienced earlier for all eternity made his soul shudder.

Thus, as he was brought along into the cave, any scheme he originally wanted to plot against Ye Xuan was extinguished. This fellow did not give him any chance at all!

Ye Xuan’s guess was not wrong at all. After removing one seal after another, he finally reached the last seal.

However, this seal was clearly different from the ones he had encountered before. This was also Gongsun Ming’s trump card.

Ye Xuan remained silent and stared at Huangfu Qi coldly. Before he could ask, Huangfu Qi could not hold it in anymore and immediately said, “Don’t do anything rash! I know how to remove this seal.”

Huangfu Qi knew that his next words would determine his fate, and an eternity of torture was not something he wanted to experience.

Moreover, if he did not remove this seal, Ye Xuan’s torture would definitely be even crueler.

Seeing him take the initiative to talk, Ye Xuan snorted coldly and said, “Don’t play any tricks on me. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

“You should already know that I have countless methods to make you wish you were dead!”

Huangfu Qi’s back broke out in a cold sweat when he heard Ye Xuan’s words. He believed Ye Xuan’s words without a doubt.

After all, Ye Xuan was that sort of person. After experiencing what he had before, he was already completely convinced of that.

At this moment, he only wanted to quickly settle this matter so that he could die with dignity. He had briefly thought of trapping Ye Xuan in this cave, but knew that the cave could only trap Ye Xuan, and would not pose any threat to him.

If he really did that, he would be the only one suffering.

Therefore, Huangfu Qi walked toward the seal, trembling. Then, he injected a strange power into the seal, and in moments, the seal was undone.

At that moment, Ye Xuan finally saw what was behind the seal.

It was a dense black forest that exuded a terrifying evil aura. If those with weak minds stayed in this forest for too long, they would gradually go insane and become bloodthirsty killing machines.

After discovering this situation, Ye Xuan’s expression instantly turned even colder, and his heart was already filled with monstrous anger.

“Gongsun Ming! Just you wait!”

Without hesitation, grabbed Huangfu Qi’s soul and rushed into the forest.

Huangfu Qi was not happy about this.

“I’ve already helped you remove the seal. Please, let me die.”

Ye Xuan ignored his words and said coldly, “Just stay here obediently. Until this matter is resolved, you will remain alive.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan barged into the forest and instantly sensed waves of cold energy assaulting his face. Immediately after, many ghosts appeared and surged toward him from every direction.

“Damn it… It was indeed a forbidden land. There are actually so many ghosts here.”

Ye Xuan sucked in a breath of cold air, and he was very nervous and worried about how Ao Lei and the others were faring in this place. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In a moment of impatience, Ye Xuan unleashed his spiritual sense, attempting to find traces of their presence. However, because of that, more and more ghosts in the forest pounced toward him, blocking his advance.

Among these ghosts, there was even a powerful leader, who was staring at Ye Xuan coldly. This ghost had already reached the ancient realm.

It said disdainfully, “Haha! Another reckless person has appeared. From the aura he’s exuding, he’s definitely very powerful!”

“Brothers. We can eat our fill again!”

After saying this, the ghost’s mouth seemed to be drooling. Ye Xuan looked like a delicious meal to them.

After hearing his words, the other ghosts also laughed eerily,

Hearing their laughter, Ye Xuan swept his gaze across them with a cold expression and said indifferently, “All of you, get lost!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his aura was fully unleashed, and waves of his spiritual power and immortal qi swept out, annihilating thousands of spirits.
