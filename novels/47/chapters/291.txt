292 Is That For Real?

As expected of the strongest person in the Miaoling Region. She was truly monstrous!

After the four-pattern condensation realm expert reformed his body, he looked at Shangguan Wan’er with lingering fear.

At the same time, the other cultivators also made their moves, using their strongest attacks on Shangguan Wan’er.

The sky was filled with all kinds of powerful attacks imbued with various martial intents.

However, at that moment, Shangguan Wan’er’s body suddenly disappeared.

She passed through their attacks and suddenly arrived behind the four-pattern condensation realm expert.

“You’re just a rat hiding behind others,” Shangguan Wan’er said coldly.

In her opinion, these people who coveted Ye Xuan’s Tower of Heaven were no different from rats and ants. They were all trash.

“Not good!”

“Everyone, save me!”

Seeing this, the expert’s expression changed drastically and he quickly cried for help.

However, Shangguan Wan’er’s actions were so fast that no one could react in time.

Buzzzzzz!

Bright sky-blue sword qi flashed, fusing sword, metal and ice intents. The man’s body was instantly destroyed.

Right at this moment, the soul of that expert suddenly floated out of the void, wanting to escape quietly.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes turned cold.

Her hand made a clenching motion, and an invisible force instantly crushed the terrified soul.

Poof! It was annihilated!

Terrifying! This woman’s strength was too terrifying!

Buzzzzzz!

At that moment, Shangguan Wan’er took a step forward and disappeared.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically upon seeing this.

Run! Hurry up and run!

Why the f*ck were they still here?

The difference in strength between the two sides was so huge that they stood no chance at all.

Staying here was akin to digging their own graves. They were not even from the same faction, just a temporary alliance.

There was no way they would truly band together in times of crisis.

“Such a motley crew. They dared to try to snatch Teacher’s things with such meager strength? ”

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were filled with disdain.

Her words made everyone wince with embarrassment. The problem was that they could not refute her at all. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Also, it seemed that Ye Xuan was really Shangguan Wan’er’s teacher.

At that moment, everyone began to doubt Ye Xuan’s identity.

Who was this guy?

How had he managed to convince this powerful expert to acknowledge him as her teacher?

Unfortunately, most of them were destined never to know the answer.

Every time Shangguan Wan’er’s sky blue sword qi swept out, a pattern condensation realm expert would die.

At this moment, they were truly like rats, running helter-skelter in an attempt to flee..

Although Shangguan Wan’er was powerful, she could not stop everyone at the same time. Unlike Ye Xuan, she lacked spatial intent, which could have restrained their moments.

Still, only three people had managed to escape.

Of course, with Shangguan Wan’er’s speed, if she wanted to catch up, she could at least kill one more. However, in order to prevent other powerful cultivators from invading the Qingyun sect during this time, Shangguan Wan’er dispelled this idea.

Before her teacher came out of secluded cultivation, she would guard the Qingyun sect!

Moments later, Shangguan Wan’er tore space apart and appeared above the Qingyun sect. She then set up a powerful defensive formation around them and modified the Qingyun sect’s mountain guardian formation.

After doing all this, Shangguan Wan’er set up a formation to conceal her aura and began to cultivate.

She planned to first cultivate the martial techniques and cultivation methods Ye Xuan taught her, before moving on to the spiritual sense tempering technique.

As time slowly passed, news of the battle at the Qingyun sect spread throughout the Nanzhou Region.

At the same time, the news that Shangguan Wan’er was Ye Xuan’s disciple also spread.

However, no one believed it, especially those who knew Shangguan Wan’er’s personality. They were certain that this was a baseless rumor.

This matter was simply too ridiculous!

As such, everyone scoffed at the idea that Shangguan Wan’er was Ye Xuan’s disciple.

However, some people suspected that Shangguan Wan’er and Ye Xuan’s relationship was not ordinary, and some bold people even thought that they were Dao partners!

Still, this was not particularly likely either. Shangguan Wan’er had turned down countless suitors, and had even killed a number of them.

As such, although many cultivators dreamed of pursuing her, they did not dare to actually get close to her.

Of course, the Luo Heaven Palace also suppressed the news.

After all, the Luo Heaven Palace was a super force in the Miaoling Region. They could not tolerate others slandering their Palace Master.

Now, Shangguan Wan’er only had one goal, and that was to become stronger.

She desperately wanted to know who she was in her previous life and everything about her past life.
