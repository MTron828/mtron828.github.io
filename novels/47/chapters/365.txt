366 It’s Time To Show Off

When Gongsun Shouyue heard this, he first looked at Gao Shun and then at Ye Xuan.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll bear witness to this.”

However, he was also rather puzzled. Where did Ye Xuan get his confidence from? Why would he compete with Gao Shun in this manner?

Throughout the entire Hidden Sword peak, the strongest cultivator was undoubtedly Gao Shun’s son, Gao Tianyu.

Although that kid was indeed a scumbag, thanks to Gao Shun supporting him with cultivation resources unreservedly, his strength had already reached the first level of the materialization realm.

!!

Among the younger generation of cultivators in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was the strongest after Hua Rufeng.

Hua Rufeng would not participate in this year’s Seven Peaks competition, so Gao Tianyu was basically a shoo-in to become the overall champion.

“Junior Brother Ye, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. The champion of this year’s Seven Peaks competition will be our Hidden Sword peak.”

After seeing Ye Xuan agree to the bet, Gao Shun’s mouth curved into a cold smile.

Ye Xuan looked at it indifferently, and then his eyes fell on Zhuge Yueyue.

“Yueyue, it seems like your Martial Uncle Gao is looking down on you. You have to work hard on your cultivation. Give Martial Uncle Gao a surprise.”

“Ah.”

Zhuge Yueyue knew that her teacher was placing all of his hopes on her.

She felt nervous and pressured, but also excited that her teacher trusted her.

“Teacher, don’t worry. I’ll definitely work hard in my cultivation and give Martial Uncle Gao a wonderful surprise,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a determined look.

“We’ll see about that! You only have three months left, so you should treasure that time!”

Gao Shun did not take Zhuge Yueyue’s words seriously at all.

“No worries! Three months is enough!”

Ye Xuan looked at the latter indifferently.

After that, Gongsun Shouyue gave a few more instructions and then brought Gao Shun to the other chiefs’ peaks.

After the two of them left, Zhuge Yueyue finally could not hold it in anymore and hurried over to Ye Xuan’s side.

Zhuge Yueyue felt a little regretful. If she had not offended Gao Shun just now, perhaps her teacher would not have been forced to such a point.

“Teacher, it’s all my fault. If it wasn’t for me, Teacher wouldn’t have to do this.”

“I swear that I’ll definitely work hard in cultivation in the future and win back the magic artifact if I lose.”

Ye Xuan looked at his disciple, who was on the verge of crying, and found it a little funny.

“Yueyue, you’re overthinking things. I didn’t do it for you.”

“Eh?” Zhuge Yueyue was dumbfounded. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, after a moment of confusion, Zhuge Yueyue had it figured out.

“Teacher definitely did it for me. He’s just saying that because he doesn’t want me to feel bad.”

“Teacher is such a kind person.”

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue felt her heart warm up.

Was this the feeling of being protected by others?

“Teacher, I know that you would never provoke Martial Uncle Gao for no reason.’

“I know that you’re doing all this for me, and I know that it’s my fault.”

“I will always remember your kindness and will work hard not to embarrass you in the Seven Peaks competition.”

“Even if I lose, I will lose with dignity!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

He had already placed his bets on her. She should not jinx things by saying that she might lose.

Still, his mouth spoke contrarian words.

“Remember this clearly. No matter what the result of the Seven Peaks competition, just do your best. Don’t be burdened by expectations.”

“Do you think I care about my reputation?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan got flashbacks to what he had experienced in the Great Wilderness Divine sect for the past hundred years, and the corners of his mouth twitched.

While the system was dormant, his mediocre talent had been ridiculed by everyone in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Everyone knew that Cloud Sky peak was home to a useless cultivator and chief.

However, since the system had already awakened, it was not impossible for him to help her win the Seven Peaks competition.

‘It’s time to show off!’

Ye Xuan stood on the peak of the mountain with a smile on his face.

Just then, Ye Xuan turned around to look at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Yueyue, I want to see how your cultivation has progressed over the past four days.”

Ye Xuan then headed over to the courtyard, and Zhuge Yueyue followed close behind.
