567 More Than One?

In the past, no disciple would choose to join Cloud Sky peak. However, things were different now. Now, they could not even join it even if they wanted to. Cloud Sky peak’s reputation was now sky-high, not just due to Ye Xuan, but also in part due to Zhuge Yueyue’s achievements.

Seeing Ye Xuan’s gradually receding, Gao Shun felt touched.

Although Ye Xuan had said that they were now even on this matter, it was still a tremendous life-saving favor. He had indeed saved Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun earlier, but if Ye Xuan had not appeared, they would likely have still perished anyway.

How could he repay such a life-saving grace?

!!

After letting out a long sigh, Gao Shun felt rather helpless.

Gao Tianyu asked, “Father, what’s going on? Why are you so emotional?”

“Tianyu, I’m afraid we won’t be able to pay back what we owe ye Xuan in this lifetime.”

“I’m just feeling a little emotional now. After all, we made things difficult for Ye Xuan in the past. I truly didn’t expect him to actually save me…”

After saying this, he came to a decision. If there was a chance in the future, he would find a way to at least try to repay Ye Xuan. He was well aware of how precious this pill was.

It had not only saved him, but granted him the future that he had dreamed of previously. Soon, he would reach the supreme realm.

…

“Junior Brother Ye, what are your plans in the coming days?”

Yuelun asked as they were on their way back.

Now that the trip to the ancient tomb had come to an end, and Ao Lei and the others were probably on their way to annihilate the Immortal Divine sect, there was nothing for them to do.

Ye Xuan had originally planned to go back and break through to the ancient realm. However, the speed of his improvement was simply too fast, and he was afraid that his cultivation foundation would be unstable if he rushed things.

As such, he instead decided to travel around and bring his two disciples to see the world.

“I’ll be traveling around for a while and seeing the world with my two disciples.”

“The Divine Seal peak’s gathering is about to begin. I should probably go and take a look, but I’m not sure about it yet.”

Ye Xuan also suddenly thought of the gathering. After all, it was a big event in the East continent, so there was no harm in participating.

As he looked at Yuelun, Ye Xuan’s thoughts started to run wild.

He had a girlfriend in the Heaven continent, but he could not help but compare Yanran and Yuelun.

At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly thought of his couple system and asked the system, ‘System, is the couple system only limited to one person?’

“Host, the couple system is the same as your disciple system. If you have the ability, you can have more than one.”

Hearing this, a smile appeared on Ye Xuan’s face, and he began to scheme.

It seemed that his relationship with Yuelun could progress, and that his previous efforts were not in vain.

Unfortunately, Yanran had already returned to the Heaven continent, so he would be unable to obtain any rewards from the system from her until they were reunited.

However, the system had now shown him an alternative.

Yuelun seemed to have noticed Ye Xuan’s ill-intentioned gaze, and her face instantly turned red.

“This kid… could it be that he’s up to no good again?”

Yuelun’s face turned even redder when she recalled what had happened between the two of them in the tomb.

Looking at the chiliad gold vine seedling that Ye Xuan had given her, Yuelun was still very touched.

Was he about to confess? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

What would she do if he did? How should she reply?

Should she reject his advances first? If she agreed too easily, would that not be unseemly?

At this moment, Yuelun’s mind was in complete chaos.

Then, Ye Xuan asked seriously, “Senior Sister Yuelun, what’s wrong? Why is your face as red as an apple?”

“Get lost!”

Yuelun’s face was originally filled with anticipation, but after hearing Ye Xuan’s words, she was furious that her expectations had been disappointed and simply turned her back on him.

Hmph!

This guy!

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt a little happy. He had really wanted to confess to Yuelun.

However, after seeing her expression, he decided to tease her instead.

He indeed got the result he was hoping for, but he also felt quite distressed. This was originally a great opportunity, but he had clearly chosen to play himself instead. This was his own fault.
