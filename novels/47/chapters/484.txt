485 Ye Xuan Appears

Situ Mo despaired, and was about to resign himself to fate.

However, at this moment, a bright white divine light suddenly flashed across the sky.

This terrifying white divine light contained an extremely sharp sword intent that instantly swept away the two attacks.

“Who is it?”

!!

The Reincarnation Fairy turned to look toward the source of the sword attack, and noticed a white figure hovering in the sky.

She instantly recognized him, as she still remembered his domineering appearance at Qingyang City.

“It’s him…”

“He actually saved me!”

She looked at him with a complicated expression.

“Saintess, are you alright?”

After blocking another lightning bolt with great difficulty, Situ Mo rushed over to the Saintess and found that she was safe and sound. He heaved a sigh of relief.

“Uncle Situ, I’m fine. I didn’t expect him to appear here though!”

Hearing this, Situ Mo also quickly looked over.

“Ye Xuan…”

His eyes were filled with disbelief. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He had never expected that at the moment of life and death, it was Ye Xuan who had saved the Reincarnation Fairy.

From now on, the Jade Lake Divine sect owed Ye Xuan a huge favor for rescuing their Saintess.

The outskirts of the archaic divine mountains were currently being rocked by shockwaves from the battle between the ancient beast descendants.

Situ Mo did not have time to think too much into the matter and quickly checked the injuries of the other disciples of the Jade Lake Divine sect.

“Damn it! We’ve already requested assistance, but I don’t know when the grand elder and the others will arrive!

“In order to avoid more casualties, all of you should stay put,” Situ Mo instructed them with a serious expression.

As a mystic lord realm expert, this was the first time that he had found himself not up to the task.

The white figure slowly descended from the sky.

At the same time, a handsome young man ran over.

Naturally, they recognized this person too. He was Su Changhe from the Su family of Qingyang City.

“Elder Situ, long time no see. How are you?”

Ye Xuan went over to Situ Mo and the others.

“We’re fine! Thank you for your help just now, Chief Ye Xuan. Were it not for your timely help, I’m afraid the Jade Lake Divine sect would have suffered heavy losses…”

Situ Mo was sincerely grateful.

Seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy quickly said, “I will definitely remember Chief Ye Xuan’s life-saving grace!”

Ye Xuan nodded, not overly concerned by this.

He had also sensed the aura of the heaven devouring divine sparrow and another powerful ancient beast descendant, so he had rushed over. When he arrived, he noticed their predicament and acted to save them.

Perhaps for Ye Xuan, it was just something he did in passing, but it was something that was deeply imprinted into the hearts of these Jade Lake Palace cultivators.

“It’s good that you’re safe. Fortunately, I came in time. Otherwise, things would have turned out pretty badly.”

Ye Xuan’s gaze turned toward the heaven devouring divine sparrow in the sky, and his eyes glistened with excitement.

“Su Changhe, stay with them and don’t run around!”

“I’m going to greet the heaven devouring divine sparrow!”

Ye Xuan’s face was calm as he spoke.

When everyone heard this, they were dumbfounded.

“What? Are you going alone?”

The heaven devouring divine sparrow was a supreme realm ancient beast descendant. It was terrifyingly strong.

Although Ye Xuan was also strong, would he be able to withstand the attacks of a supreme realm existence?

“Chief Ye Xuan, you must not be impulsive! The safest way now is to wait for the other experts to arrive, and then join forces to fight against the two beasts!”

“Besides these two supreme realm ancient beast descendants, there’s also that unfathomably strong tortoise. This isn’t something we can deal with ourselves!”

“They are fighting over the coffin anyway, so why don’t we just sit back and reap the benefits?”

Situ Mo had quickly analyzed the situation.

Ever since the haven devouring divine sparrow appeared, it had been hurling attack after attack at the black tortoise. The Pixiu, which was also attacking, was also caught up within the range of its attacks.

At this moment, the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains were trembling from the shockwaves that rippled out from the constant attacks. Even the spatial barrier in the area was starting to crack.

There was lightning, there was fire, and there was that unfathomable tortoise.

Right now, everyone in the area had sent out distress signals requesting reinforcements. If they waited long enough, the experts from the various holy lands would converge here and join forces to suppress the beasts.

Although Ye Xuan was powerful, it was still too dangerous to fight these beasts alone.
