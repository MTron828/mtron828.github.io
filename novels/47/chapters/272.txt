Chapter 273: Datura Flower

“Is my opportunity here related to slaughter intent?”

As he traversed the mystic realm, many thoughts flashed through Ye Xuan’s mind.

Slaughter intent was second only to supreme intents.

If he could comprehend slaughter intent, it would be quite beneficial to his cultivation and strength.

Perhaps it could serve as a contingency plan if he failed in comprehending all ten supreme intents and engraving them as profound patterns on his body.

After all, comprehending ten sixth-level and above supreme intents was a tall order. While not exactly on the same level, devouring and slaughter intents would suffice as passable replacements.

At the same time, Shangguan Wan’er was also searching for opportunities in this mystic realm.

However, she did not choose to go in the same direction as Ye Xuan.

In order to find the opportunities as soon as possible, and to avoid the interference of those irrational demonic beasts, Shangguan Wan’er concealed her aura.

As she journeyed through the mystic realm, she noticed that the weakest demonic beasts here were Tier Six ones, and all of them would fight the moment they encountered another demonic beasts.

As a result, there was fighting everywhere in the mystic realm.

She sighed. Demonic beasts were not known for their intelligence in the first place, which was proven by the fact that they had tried to comprehend this dangerous martial intent and failed.

Suddenly, Shangguan Wan’er discovered that there was a blood-red saber inside the corpse of a giant demonic beast.

This was no ordinary demonic beast, but a flood dragon that was several thousand feet long.

Looking at the corpse, it seemed to have been dead for tens of thousands of years. Despite that, it was intact, and was still exuding spiritual pressure.

it was obvious that although its physical body was intact, its soul had been destroyed.

“Is this the source?”

When Shangguan Wan’er saw this, she narrowed her eyes, a look of surprise flashing across them.

This blood-red saber contained extremely pure slaughter intent!

If her guess was correct, these mindless demonic beasts had all been affected by the slaughter intent contained within this blood-red saber.

“Hmph! It’s finally my turn to gain something!”

Shangguan Wan’er looked around and did spot Ye Xuan anywhere.

The corners of her mouth curled up into a beautiful arc.

Although slaughter intent was weaker than the supreme intents, it was still an amazing find that would enhance her strength greatly if she engraved it as a profound pattern on her body.

Furthermore, just by looking at the blood-red saber, Shangguan Wan’er felt as if she had fallen into a blood-red world, with mountains of corpses and seas of blood everywhere. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

However, as the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, her soul was extremely powerful and could resist the allure of the slaughter intent.

Even so, Shangguan Wan’er could not help but feel a desire to kill, as if something was egging her on. A voice kept echoing in the depths of her mind.

Kill! kill! Kill!

Roar!

Around the blood-red saber, many powerful demonic beasts were fighting madly.

Suddenly, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes flashed, and her figure suddenly appeared in front of the blood-red saber.

However, no matter how hard she tried, she could not pull it out of the corpse.

With Shangguan Wan’er’s current strength, she could easily tear space apart with a wave of her hand. Yet she could do nothing to this blood-red saber.

Shangguan Wan’er realized that the blood-red saber seemed to have fused with the flood dragon’s corpse, and the two could not be separated.

Left with no other choice, Shangguan Wan’er could only put the flood dragon’s corpse into her storage ring.

“This mystic land must have been sealed for a long time. I don’t know why it suddenly opened,” Shangguan Wan’er thought to herself.

The blood-red saber was so precious that it would have been taken away by other experts the moment it was discovered. The fact that it was here meant that the mystic realm was not accessible.

“Eh? I didn’t think that this blood-red saber would contain an inheritance. Divine Lord Frenzy Saber?”

“It even contains a battle formation. This saber is extraordinary!”

Shangguan Wan’er’s spiritual sense examined the blood-red saber, and a look of surprise flashed across her eyes.

Now, she finally understood why the demonic beasts that had attacked Ye Xuan earlier were capable of using a formation and working together. It had to do with this blood-red saber!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Just as Shangguan Wan’er was putting away the corpse and the blood-red saber, the entire mystic realm suddenly trembled.

Roar!

“Damned humans!”

A deafening roar was heard, followed by a shout that was filled with monstrous killing intent.

“What kind of existence did that guy provoke this time? Why is he fighting again?”

Seeing this, a strange light flashed across her eyes, and then her figure suddenly disappeared.

Clang!

A huge golden demonic ape swung its fist against the Tower of Heaven.

Ye Xuan frowned.

This golden demonic ape was much stronger than the black giant that he had subdued before. Moreover, it had retained some semblance of intelligence and sentience.

It had blocked Ye Xuan’s path, preventing him from reaching the opportunity he had sensed.

Originally, Ye Xuan’s objective was the same as Shangguan Wan’er’s, which was to find the source of the slaughter intent.

However, when he swept the surroundings with his spiritual sense, which was infused with his power of karma, he detected another opportunity.

It was the Datura flower, otherwise known as the Slaughter Paramita flower!

It took a thousand years for the Datura flower to bloom, and the same was true for the flower to wither.

Some people also called it the flower of the Netherworld shore.

In short, there were many legends about the flower.

In essence though, the Datura flower only had one use, which was to increase the comprehension value of the cultivator and provide a precious opportunity to experience an epiphany.

The Datura flower in front of Ye Xuan was delicate and alluring, and its petals were filled with strong killing intent.

The surrounding environment was filled with mountains of corpses and seas of blood. After absorbing the endless killing intent from the demonic beasts that fought in its vicinity, this Datura flower far exceeded other normal Datura flowers.
