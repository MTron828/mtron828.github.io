Chapter 24: Don’t Be Rash, You Can’t Fight Here

However, if he entered the core formation state, his position would be equivalent to that of the leader of the Evil Blood sect.

By then, even if the leader of the Evil Blood sect perished, as long as he was around, who could do anything to the Evil Blood sect? He could even enjoy a respected position within the Great Qian Dynasty.

Therefore, given all these factors, when he discovered that there was someone else competing with him, he was naturally furious.

“There’s going to be a good show. Feng Yitai seems to be really angry.”

“That guy is ruthless. It seems that the young man is going to suffer.”

“Although Feng Yitai doesn’t dare to make a move with that expert in the auction house, it’s hard to say if he won’t after he leaves the auction house’s territory!”

“That’s right. Did you see the killing intent in Feng Yitai’s eyes? It seems that regardless of whether that young man wins the bid for the starsword grass or not, he will suffer Feng Yitai’s revenge!”

“He’s still a young man after all. His thoughts are too simple. He actually dared to provoke such a fierce existence like Feng Yitai!”

The cultivators in the auction house immediately started discussing the matter, but no one believed that Ye Xuan would emerge from this unscathed.

After all, in everyone’s eyes, other than the expert behind the auction house, Feng Yitai and Lin You were the strongest cultivators present.

Of course, this did not include core formation state cultivators, as they were already considered invincible existences.

Most importantly, no one dared to offend the Evil Blood sect and the Shadow Tower in the Jiaohei city. It was due to this that everyone resisted the impulse to bid after being threatened by Feng Yitai.

......

Although treasures were indeed quite tempting, they had to be alive to enjoy those treasures.

As for Ye Xuan, because he had used the breath concealment technique, no one could sense his cultivation unless the other party’s cultivation level was much higher than his.

Everyone present thought, ‘How strong could a young man around the age of 20 be?’

Even some genius cultivators were only at the ninth level of the true essence realm. This guy wasn’t like that, right?

Ye Xuan was an elder of the Qingyun clan. No one would think that he would come to such a lousy place.

Therefore, in their eyes, the Ye Xuan in front of them was like a dead man.

“I bid 76 million. I will be the owner of the Xingjian grass!”

Feng Yitai suppressed the anger in his heart and said with a cold gaze.

If he had not considered the existence behind the auction house, he would have moved to kill Ye Xuan with one slap.

“76,010,000!” Ye Xuan looked at Feng Yitai and spoke slowly with a smile.

‘Are you angry? I’m going to anger you to death!’

“F*ck...” Feng Yitai immediately became furious.

This guy only added 10,000 gold coins to his bid. This was equivalent to blatant provocation, was it not?

“Who do you think you are?!”

Feng Yitai could not hold it in anymore. The surging pressure in his body swept out and enveloped Ye Xuan.

Although the auction house did not allow fighting, he was only using his spiritual pressure. This did not violate the rules, right?

“Ha! Who do you think you are? How dare you act so arrogantly in front of me?”

At this moment, a pressure that was dozens of times stronger than Feng Yitai’s swept out. It was as if the enormous Mount Tai had instantly emerged.

Comparing the two, Feng Yitai’s pressure was like a chicken, while Ye Xuan’s pressure was like a giant walking the mortal world. As long as the giant took a step forward, it would easily stomp the chicken to death.

“The pressure of a core formation state cultivator...”

“This young man has actually broken through to the core formation state!”

At this moment, the expressions of many cultivators in the auction hall changed drastically. In the face of this incomparably terrifying pressure, they were like swaying blades of grass that were on the verge of collapsing under the howling thunderstorm.

This terrifying pressure had definitely surpassed the purple spirit state. They never imagined that there would actually be a peerless expert whose strength had reached the core formation state in the auction hall.

Feng Yitai had kicked a huge rock this time. This fellow was about to suffer.

This thought popped up in everyone’s minds at the same time, but their hearts did not pity him.

Were you not incomparably arrogant earlier? Were you not threatening us openly? Were you not openly parading the Evil Blood sect’s status around?

You have now offended an existence that you cannot afford to and have kicked an iron plate.

Although tenth-level purple spirit state cultivators were indeed extremely powerful in the Great Qian dynasty, they were still not strong enough to be considered among the ranks of top-tier cultivators.

Only when one’s cultivation level reached the core formation state could one gain an unassailable status within the Great Qian dynasty!

The reason for that was simple. Once a core formation state cultivator made a move, they could easily crush a city and turn it into ruins. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This... This is impossible...”

Feng Yitai’s expression changed drastically when he saw this. His eyes were filled with shock.

The other party was clearly a young kid with no reputation. How could he turn out to be a super powerhouse whose cultivation had reached the core formation state? Why would such a terrifying existence appear in Jiaohei city’s auction?

Most importantly, he sensed an extremely obvious killing intent within this terrifying pressure.

“You... Don’t act recklessly. Cultivators are not allowed to make a move in the auction house!”

At that moment, Feng Yitai could not stop himself from shouting out in panic. His gaze went toward the depths of the auction hall.

The powerhouse behind the auction house was sitting there.

Even if this guy was a core formation state cultivator, he had to give face to the owner of the auction house, right?

However, the very next second, Feng Yitai’s body trembled.

He realized that the owner of the auction house seemed to be ignoring him, and did not display the slightest reaction!

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but faintly look in that direction, and then slowly said, “Are you going to make a move?”

“My Lord, please don’t misunderstand. I don’t have the right!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a respectful voice suddenly responded from the deepest corner of the auction house.

He was the owner of the auction house. After sensing Ye Xuan’s terrifying spiritual pressure, his forehead was already covered in sweat, and he cursed inwardly!

“Damn Feng Yitai! I was almost implicated by him!”

Although they were both at the core formation state, he sensed that Ye Xuan’s pressure was unfathomable. The other party’s cultivation was at least at the advanced stage of the empty core state! There was a high possibility that he had already stepped into the true core state!

Faced such a terrifying existence, who dared to provoke him?

If the other party was unhappy, he could just slap him and the auction house to death.
