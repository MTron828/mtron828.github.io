704 Champion!

When he noticed that Xiang Yun was about to break down, Hua Rufeng panicked and quickly ran to her side to comfort her.

“Junior Martial Sister, don’t worry. Your first sister is fine. She just had to go do something else, so she went outside first.”

“Don’t panic. I’ll accompany you outside to look for your first sister later, okay?”

Hearing this, Xiang Yun’s emotions simmered down.

“Are you sure you’re not lying to me?”

“Do I look like I’m lying to you? I promise you that your first sister is really fine.”

Xiang Yun stared at Hua Rufeng for a long time before saying, “Okay, let’s pink promise. If you lied, you’ll be struck by lightning.”

Xiang Yun finally relaxed.

Then, Hua Rufeng’s gaze turned to the golden throne at the end of the path. He suddenly turned around to look at Xiang Yun and said with a smile, “Little girl, didn’t you say that you wanted to be invincible among your peers?”

“Do you see that big shiny chair over there now? As long as you succeed in reaching it, you will definitely become invincible among your peers!”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun happily hopped and skipped toward it.

However, the disciple from Godwind Academy was unwilling to see this outcome, so he immediately moved to stop her.

Unfortunately, he was interrupted by a kick from Hua Rufeng that sent him flying.

Seeing her approach the throne happily like that somehow filled him with joy.

He did not understand the reason either. Actually, he could have taken the throne for himself, but he did not. Instead, he willingly gave up the champion position.

In any case, he felt she deserved it for making it this far, and even defeating five opponents single-handedly. This was also a good chance to repay Ye Xuan for his assistance and guidance in his cultivation.

The other members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect who were watching from outside all exchanged looks of admiration.

“Senior Brother Hua Rufeng is really selfless and considerate. I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to do something like this.”

Everyone was filled with emotion, as Hua Rufeng had basically given up the opportunity to become the champion, and with it, the fame, fortune and rewards.

Who would be able to do such a thing?

The eldest disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect was indeed different.

Xiang Yun soon arrived in front of the golden throne. After examining it for a moment, she scratched the back of her head and sat on it.

“Hehe, I am invincible among my peers!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The moment she sat on the golden throne, waves of golden light immediately descended from the sky and surrounded her. Furthermore, an immense amount of fate energy also surged into her body.

However, surprisingly, some of the fate energy flickered, and then appeared outside the ancient realm!

Then, it shot toward Ye Xuan!

Eh?

I have a share too?

Ye Xuan was taken aback, but Yuelun, who was standing beside him, quickly explained, “Junior Brother Ye, the Divine Seal peak’s gathering is actually an ancient formation that was created by gathering worldly power.”

“Every time the gathering is held, this golden throne takes a potion of the fate energy and distributes it.”

“The champion will obtain 60%, while the remaining 40% is awarded to the champion’s teacher.”

“To put it simply, without your hard work in teaching this girl, she would not have any hope of winning. She is where she is today because of you, so you also deserve a reward.”

After hearing Yuelun’s words, Ye Xuan finally understood what was going on. It was no wonder Daoist Canghai and the others came all the way here. In reality, they also wanted to obtain a portion of the fate energy.

“Oh… I see.”

Ye Xuan could not help but sigh.

Fate energy symbolized whether one was lucky or not. Of course, the more the better. In any case, this was something that Ye Xuan was currently lacking, and if could obtain more, it would be easier for him to reach the sealed immortal realm in the future. After all, the more fate energy one possessed, the greater the blessings of the heavens they would receive.

In this way, he would not have to suffer in the future, and his journey would be smooth sailing. That being said, this one a one-time award, so Ye Xuan began to ponder whether or not it would be able to multiply it.

Was it possible to give away fate energy? Would the system even give him a reward for doing so?

If it was really possible, then it would be awesome.

At this moment, Xiang Yun was currently bathed in fate energy upon the golden throne. She was in a trance-like state, and the seal on her forehead seemed to have become clearer, and even her aura was strengthened.

“Heavens! This little girl really became the champion! I can barely believe my eyes!”

“Who could have predicted this? I certainly didn’t!”
