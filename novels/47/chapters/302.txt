303 Group Secluded Cultivation Session

“Since you’ve apologized so sincerely, I’ll let it slide. After all, you’re my precious disciple,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“However, this period of secluded cultivation won’t last too long. You should return to the Luo Heaven Palace after three months.”

“The reason why I didn’t allow you to refine the heart of heavenly lightning previously was related to the Luo Heaven Palace.”

Through the power of karma, Ye Xuan had sensed that something would interfere with Shangguan Wan’er’s refinement. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At the time, Ye Xuan had not known when it was, but as time passed, the urging of the power of karma became clearer.

Now, he knew that in three months, a major event would happen in the Luo Heaven Palace that would involve Shangguan Wan’er.

Although Shangguan Wan’er was confused by Ye Xuan’s words, she still chose to believe him.

“It won’t be dangerous for you, but if you don’t go back, it’s very likely that the Luo Heaven Palace will be destroyed,” Ye Xuan explained.

Even though he did not know the details, some things could be inferred.

Those who wanted to deal with the Luo Heaven Palace were most likely Shangguan Wan’er’s enemies.

After all, cultivation resources were essential for cultivation. In the process of searching for and obtaining them, there was bound to be conflict.

Although Ye Xuan did not care about the Luo Heaven Palace, it was something his disciple had single-handedly established.

“Alright, I know what needs to be done.”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded. It was just as well anyway. She needed to appoint a new palace master as well.

Though the Luo Heaven Palace was no longer useful to her, she would not sit idly and watch it be destroyed by others.

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve and transferred Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan into the room.

“From today, I will help you cultivate martial intent.”

Of course, different disciples would comprehend different martial intents, so Ye Xuan had also come prepared for this. He would help them refine spiritual items that would allow them to experience epiphanies, which in turn would net him more of such spiritual items from the system.

Then, he would use them all in one go to attempt to comprehend the true form of karmic intent. If he wanted to reach the great circle of the pattern condensation realm with supreme intents, then comprehending the true form of karmic intent was the first, and most vital step.

Without karmic intent, he would not be able to seek out and trace the opportunities required to achieve such a feat.

“Yue, you will focus on sword intent.”

“Qingyan, you will focus on wood and fire intents!”

“Yuyan, you can also focus on sword intent. Given your current strength, comprehending devouring intent is out of your reach.”

“As for Wan’er, you can choose between the water, slaughter, metal, and ice intentions, but not sword intent.”

Ye Xuan naturally had his reasons for these arrangements.

Yue possessed the sword jade body, so sword intent was undoubtedly the most suitable for her.

Li Qingyan, on the other hand, had the dual-spirit body, which focused on wood and fire attributes.

After receiving spiritual power infusion, Zhao Yuyan had already reached the early stage of the Xudan realm, so she too could start comprehending martial intents.

However, given the fact that there was no reference for devouring intent at the moment, even experiencing an epiphany would be useless.

Thus, comprehending sword intent would have to do for now. After all, Ye Xuan’s sword intent had reached the perfect-level, and most of the martial techniques he taught his disciples were sword techniques.

As for Shangguan Wan’er, she had reached the seventh level in her water, ice, sword, and metal intents. Coupled with her extremely high comprehension value, no matter which intent she comprehended, she would be able to improve quickly.

Of course, Shangguan Wan’er could also choose to comprehend slaughter intent, which was a martial intent second only to supreme intents, and on the same level as devouring intent.

“Yes, Teacher,” his disciples said in unison.

“My precious disciple, I know you might be slightly confused, as you need perfect-level sword intent to awaken your Undying Xuan Huang sword physique. However, it’s not the time to awaken it now, so just be patient.”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded, indicating that she would follow Ye Xuan’s arrangements.

Ye Xuan knew that the phenomenon that would occur after she awakened her special constitution would attract a lot of unwanted attention, including from King realm experts. Furthermore, Ye Xuan would obtain a higher-level special constitution as well, further compounding the problem.

As such, they both had to bide their time until an opportunity to awaken it safely appeared.

“Alright! Now, take out all of the treasures that I gave you. I’ll help you refine them now.”
