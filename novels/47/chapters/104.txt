Chapter 105: Shy Disciples

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Eh… why is it so shiny? Is this specially designed for girls? If I put it on, I might be called a pervert by others!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched.

He did not expect the defensive spiritual artifact he had obtained from the system to be designed for women.

“Forget it! I’ll give them this one in the future too! I might get a different reward from the system then!”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan suddenly felt helpless.

The defensive power of the Gold Sparrow armor was indeed quite high, but it was not very useful to him!

Was it not better to crush the enemy with absolute strength?

Moreover, his defensive sword techniques were all extremely powerful. Although they were martial techniques, their defensive power was not inferior to the Gold Sparrow armor at all.

“Oh, I almost forgot about the Spirit Burst Flower!”

Immediately, Ye Xuan directed his spiritual sense into the storage space. However, after thinking for a moment, he still stopped.

“Yue, leave the Spirit Burst Flower with me for now. I’ll let you use it in the future!”

If he gave his disciple the same type of heavenly treasure in the same month, he would not receive a reward from the system.

He had already given Yue a heavenly treasure that could increase her comprehension value this month. If he wanted to make the most of the system, he would have to wait until next month to give her the Spirit Burst Flower. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, heavenly treasures that could increase a cultivator’s comprehension value or innate bone value were extremely rare. Naturally, he would save them for when he could receive a reward from the system.

“Okay!”

Yue nodded her head obediently.

In her heart, her teacher was number one. She would agree to anything her teacher said.

“Why are your faces so red?”

Suddenly, Ye Xuan looked at the two girls’ cheeks, looking puzzled.

Hearing this, the two girls’ faces turned even redder.

Yue was 14 years old, and Li Qingyan was 17 years old. Although the two girls’ cultivation levels far surpassed other cultivators of the same age range, thanks to Ye Xuan’s help, they were still young girls at heart. Emotionally, they were no different from those other young girls.

When Ye Xuan realized that Li Qingyan had shyly put the thousand-year-old golden silk armor back into her storage space, he finally reacted and revealed an embarrassed expression.

He had only been looking at the system’s rewards, and had not noticed the change in their expressions.

“During this period of time, you will stay in the Qingyun sect. But in order to prevent the cultivators from the Great Qian royal family from coming to the Qingyun sect to cause trouble, I’llll give you an offensive jade token and a protective jade token.”

“Hmm, that doesn’t seem to be enough. I’ll give you a speed-boosting jade token as well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and three jade tokens suddenly appeared in front of him.

These so-called jade tokens were forged from crystals that possessed special powers. In the eyes of ordinary people, they were extremely sturdy objects.

However, in the eyes of cultivators, they were extremely fragile. All it took was a few hundred jin of force to crush them. Even cultivators in the refinement realm could easily crush them.

However, because the crystal’s internal structure was very strange, it could temporarily seal a cultivator’s power inside. It was often given by high-level cultivators to their juniors as a trump card.

Whether it was the Ming He’s protective jade token or the Feng Yitai’s sword qi jade token, they all belonged to the category of jade tokens.

There were protective jade tokens, offensive jade tokens, and auxiliary jade tokens.

Then, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged. The surging power of the golden core in his body was slowly compressed by his spiritual sense. It condensed into a miniature rune!

Although the rune was small, it contained terrifying power!

Runes were also divided into three types: offensive, protective rune, and auxiliary rune.

He refined these runes one by one, and slowly fused them with the jade tokens. Soon, Ye Xuan had refined three jade tokens.

The first was the protective jade token. As long as it was crushed, it would transform into an extremely sturdy energy shield that enveloped the cultivator, cultivators below the unity realm would definitely be unable to penetrate the energy shield.

The second was the speed-boosting jade token, which was a kind of auxiliary jade token. As long as one crushed it, one’s speed would increase and reach the same speeds that Ye Xuan could move at for a short period of time.

The third was the offensive jade token, which contained one of Ye Xuan’s full-strength attacks. The power contained within this attack was comparable to that of a unity realm expert.

After refining these three jade tokens, Ye Xuan took a deep breath. The spiritual power in his dantian had almost been exhausted.

As such, Ye Xuan focused on meditating and absorbing the spiritual energy around him to recover.

After some time, Ye Xuan returned to his peak state. Then, he took out the jade tokens that he had refined and gave them to his disciple!

‘Each jade token contains my full power. The system should give me a reward for these, right?’

Ye Xuan thought to himself.

With these three jade tokens, his disciple might even be able to kill the peak core formation realm expert of the Great Qian royal family!

Ye Xuan gave these three jade tokens to Ah Yue.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple an offensive jade token (first-level of the unity realm), the host has received a randomized 11x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained an offensive jade token (second-level of the unity realm)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a speed-boosting jade token (first-level of the unity realm), the host has received a randomized 5x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a speed-boosting jade token (first-level of the unity realm)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a protective jade token (first-level of the unity realm), the host has received a randomized 13x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a protective jade token (second-level of the unity realm)!”

As the system’s notification rang out, three jade tokens appeared in the system’s storage space.

The unity realm was divided into a total of ten levels!

Once one reached the tenth level of the unity realm, the strength of one’s physical body would reach its peak. Just by relying on the strength of one’s physical body, one could shatter mountains and rivers and suppress Heaven and Earth!

In other words, this was the realm where cultivators tempered their physical bodies. However, the difficulty of breaking through each minor realm was extremely high. It was no less difficult than breaking through to the unity realm from the peak of the core formation realm.

However, every time a cultivator broke through a minor realm, the strength of their physical bodies would undergo a qualitative change.

Moreover, once a cultivator reached the unity realm, the source of their strength would not only flow from their dantian, but from the various cells and pores of their body!
