664 Besieged (Part 2)

Seeing this, Xiang Yun became even happier, and swung her hammer with all her might.

Moments later, the wind and clouds surged, and streaks of purple lightning struck the ground, shocking everyone.

With the help of her self-created move, Chain Hammer Strike, she would strike down her opponents. She had learned this move when Ye Xuan taught her the Endless Lightning technique.

She suddenly raised her hammer, and then directly smashed into the ground.

In an instant, the ground cracked, and a violent force was transmitted through the ground into the surroundings, sending over ten of the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect flying.

“This is definitely not happening…”

At this moment, Liu Yun’s face was pale and weak. He was truly afraid. Was this six-year-old girl a reincarnation of a god?

Rumble… Rumble…

Booming sounds rang out one after another, and with each subsequent swing of her hammer, more and more disciples of the Supreme Divine sect were eliminated.

Outside the entrance of the ancient realm, more than a dozen figures fell heavily to the ground.

These people were the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect who had been eliminated, and had been teleported out of the ancient realm.

Seeing this scene, Daoist Gu Hao was furious. He looked at the group of disciples and shouted.

“All of you are useless… Can’t you deal with a single little girl?”

Daoist Black Iron hurriedly came forward and said, “Master, there is no need to get angry over such a small matter…”

“Pfft… I’m dying of laughter.”

Before Daoist Black Iron could finish his sentence, Gao Shun walked over to rub salt into the wound, cackling evilly as he examined the fallen disciples.

“It looks like the start of the gathering is the end of the gathering for them. How pitiful…”

“Gao Shun! I advise you not to push your luck!”

“If I want to push my luck, so what? What can you do? If you have the ability, come and attack me.”

“You’ll probably end up like your disciples here.”

Seeing Gao Shun’s smug look, Ye Xuan could not resist chiming in, “Senior Brother Gao, you shouldn’t say that. After all, the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples’ fame is built on training and achievements. Each one of them are experts!”

“Sigh, I understand. It was my fault. Fortunately, Junior Martial Brother Ye warned me. Otherwise, I would have forgotten that they were experts after that performance.”

“I don’t understand. Oh wait… I get it now! These are fake disciples, right? Impostors! They are definitely not from the Supreme Divine sect” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Daoist Gu Hao turned his gaze to Ye Xuan and Gao Shun, who were still bantering along happily. He wanted nothing more than to beat them and shut them up.

Unfortunately, he did not have the strength to do so.

“Grandmaster!”

Daoist Gu Hao almost fell to the ground. Fortunately, the disciple beside him was quick to react and immediately held him steady.

Seeing this scene, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled even more, feeling very happy in his heart. Gao Shun also felt very refreshed. It seemed that following this junior brother around would give him many opportunities to poke fun at people like this.

“Junior Martial Brother Ye, Senior Brother Gao, you guys are really too ruthless, haha,” Yuelun laughed and said.

“Damn it!”

On the other side, Daoist Gu Hao struggled to steady himself. After venting his anger on no one in particular, he turned around and said to a young man behind him.

“Li Hong, it’s time for you to set off. Hurry up and go!”

After hearing this, the young man named Li Hong immediately patted his chest and smiled evilly.

“Master, leave this matter to me!”
