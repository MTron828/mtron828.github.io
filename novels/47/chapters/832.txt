833 Ye Xuan’s Disciple (Part 2)

However, when the two powers collided, there were no violent fluctuations. Instead, it was as if the powers vanished without a trace.

“Huh… What is going on?”

“What just happened?”

They had never seen such a strange phenomenon before. Even if the two powers canceled it out, there should have been some sort of impact or explosion, right?

How did it simply disappear?

“She actually managed to comprehend this move.”

At this moment, even Ye Xuan was surprised by Zhuge Yueyue’s potential in the Sword Dao.

‘Haha! She’s such a show-off too. Atta girl!’

After seeing the dumbfounded looks of the onlookers, Ye Xuan chuckled. She truly was worthy of being his disciple.

Zhuge Yueyue’s lips curled up slightly and she said, “Is that it? Is your ability limited to just this?”

After hearing this, the golden-furred growler instantly exploded with fury.

However, at this moment, his current situation was like that monkey from earlier, and he had been made a laughingstock.

“Hehe, if that’s all, then your Xuan continent isn’t a big deal.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue pointed her sword at the golden-furred growler and said, “Come at me properly. Oh, I know! Let me try to defeat you with a single strike. If I fail, then I’ll forget what you did earlier…”

“This…”

Everyone let out exclamations of shock in unison. The golden-furred growler was an ancient species with a noble bloodline. No matter how powerful she was, defeating it in one move was completely out of the question, right?

How audacious!

Zhuge Yueyue’s words shocked everyone present, but the golden-furred growler was the one who took it the hardest.

He felt that his pride was being trampled upon. Ever since he was born, this was the first time someone had belittled him like this.

“Damn it! How dare you look down on me like this!”

The golden-furred growler let out a ferocious roar and released his monstrous flames again. Divine runes appeared around his body, and powerful energy fluctuations swept out and caused the sky to tremble.

He could no longer suppress the anger in his heart.

Before this, she did not understand why her teacher would poke fun at his opponents, but now she did. Riling up opponents and showing off felt quite good.

Perhaps she had to do this more often.

The golden-furred growler unleashed a series of powerful attacks, but she dodged each one. Moments later, she decided that there was no reason to delay things anymore.

“Let’s end it here…”

She raised the Cloud Sky Sword, and her sword aura formed a domain around her, frightening the golden-furred growler.

“Her Sword Dao aura is shocking.”

Uncertain about what he was about to face, the golden-furred growler started to panic.

Then, when he looked up, he saw a huge door appear above Zhuge Yueyue’s head, which released waves of powerful sword aura.

“It’s actually this move…”

The Reincarnation Fairy exclaimed. Even now, she could still remember this sword move clearly, as it was the very same one Zhuge Yueyue had used against her during the gathering. Seeing it again made her feel emotional.

Mu Beichen, who was not far away, was very surprised when he saw this.

He could clearly sense that Zhuge Yueyue had completely mastered this sword move. It no longer felt like she was unfamiliar with this move like she was during the gathering.

Everyone from the East continent also recognized this famous move.

“It’s Sword Immortal Ye Xuan’s famous technique!”
