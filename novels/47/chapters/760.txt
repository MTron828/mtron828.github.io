761 Sealed Immortal Realm?

Ye Xuan had heard about the incident from his teacher, but not in detail. All he knew was that his teacher had suffered heavy injuries in that battle, which was why his teacher never managed to break through to the ancient realm.

Therefore, when he heard Gao Shun mention this incident, Ye Xuan replied solemnly, “Senior Brother Gao, tell me about it.”

When Gao Shun saw Ye Xuan’s solemn expression, he sighed and replied, “Back then, we mobilized the entire sect’s forces to kill that demoness, but now she’s back, and she’s looking for revenge.”

Eh?

Ye Xuan was stunned. That person was still alive despite the sect’s best efforts back then?

Was this a joke?

If he remembered correctly, during the great battle a hundred years ago, his teacher had told him that the Great Wilderness Divine Sect suffered heavy casualties. However, Daoist Yi Feng had self-destructed his divine bones and killed this demoness.

Had she returned from the dead? She should have been reduced to ashes from an attack like that!

“Senior Brother Gao, are you lying to me? Logically speaking, she should have died a long time ago. Why is she still alive and well?”

Gao Shun replied with a serious expression at this time, “I’m not lying to you. She is indeed not dead. In fact, she’s even become stronger. Although she appears to be an ancient realm expert, I suspect that she might be still hiding her strength. Perhaps she might have even reached the sealed immortal realm!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone let out gasps of shock at the same time.

“Sealed immortal realm?”

Everyone was shocked. After all, they had originally thought that Mengyu was at most at the peak-level ancient realm expert. They had not considered the possibility of her having reached the sealed immortal realm.

A hundred years ago, she was only at the peak of the ancient realm!

Back then, she relied on the strength of her Heaven Devouring technique to suppress all the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Even Chief Tian Xuan could not do anything to her. However, Daoist Yi Feng’s decisive blow should have injured her severely.

How did she become stronger instead of weaker? By their estimates, she should have at most recovered to her peak now.

No matter how powerful her Heaven Devouring technique was, she should not have been able to break through within such a short span of time.

“Could it be because of the divine bone?”

A thought suddenly flashed through Ye Xuan’s mind, and he unconsciously voiced it out.

“Divine bone?”

Everyone was also shocked, but Ao Lei quickly chimed in, “That shouldn’t be the case. After all, Daoist Yi Feng already self-destructed his divine bones.”

“That’s right, that’s right.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Xuan pondered for a moment before saying, “Divine bones can’t be destroyed so easily. After all, they have miraculous effects.”

“Back then, that demoness wanted to steal Daoist Yi Feng’s divine bones, but before she could succeed, she was destroyed by Daoist Yi Feng’s sacrificial attack.”

“Perhaps a new divine bone has been born in her body after Daoist Yi Feng self-destructed his.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone was shocked.

“Could this be true?”

They found it difficult to believe.

If divine bones were really that easy to steal, then why did she spend so much effort to deceive Daoist Yi Feng?

This seemed very unreasonable.

Seeing their incredulous expressions, he continued, “What I said is merely my personal opinion. As for what is hidden behind this, I’m afraid that we’ll have to wait for Martial Uncle Yi Feng to come over and clear our doubts. ”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan looked at Ao Lei and said, “Senior Brother Ao, the implications of this matter are too great. I have to seek out Daoist Yi Feng and ask him about it. Moreover, his situation might not be as bad as we think.”

Feeling pressured under the prospect of Mengyu’s impending attack, Ye Xuan was forced to look for Daoist Yi Feng. Perhaps only he would be able to shed light on the situation and reveal a path toward victory against Mengyu.

No matter what, the two of them had been together for such a long time, so they knew each other’s flaws better than others.

At such a critical juncture, Daoist Yi Feng had to step forth for the sake of the sect.

However, after hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Ao Lei waved his hand and said, “Sigh… There’s no need. I’ve already sent word, but he’s not willing to see me.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned. However, moments later, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly and he said, “Haha, Senior Brother Ao, you don’t have to worry. He will definitely meet me.”

Ye Xuan vaguely understood Daoist Yi Feng’s intentions. Then, he turned around without hesitation and walked toward Daoist Yi Feng’s secret chamber.

Seeing Ye Xuan’s confidence, everyone felt puzzled.

“Forget it, forget it. I really don’t understand. Let’s just wait for the answer patiently,” Li Dahai said helplessly. Then, he said, “Anyway, in the meantime, we should do our part. Senior Brother Gao, why don’t we have a competition on who can kill more berserk beasts?”

“Who’s afraid of who? Let’s go!”

The two of them made a prompt decision to go out and kill berserk beasts.

At this moment, Ye Xuan had already arrived in front of Daoist Yi Feng’s secret chamber, but he was stopped by the two disciples in charge of guarding the door.

“Who is so daring to invade the forbidden area without permission?!”
