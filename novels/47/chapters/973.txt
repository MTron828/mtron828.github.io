Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Gongsun Zhi raised his head slightly and looked up. At this very moment, he also took out an immortal- grade sword.

In an instant, the crowd erupted into an uproar again.

“Oh my god, Gongsun Zhi also has an immortal-grade sword?”

It was not only that. From the quality of this sword, one could tell that it seemed to have reached the limits of the immortal- grade,

“Could this sword be the sword that existed in the ancient books, the Flowing Cloud Sword?”

Sensing the aura released by this sword, some knowledgeable people immediately guessed the name of this sword.

After hearing what he said, everyone looked over at the same time and asked, “What exactly is the Flowing Cloud Sword?”

“Hurry up and say it. What are its origins?”

At this moment, everyone’s curiosity was aroused. They stared at the person who had just spoken, waiting for his answer.

“This sword was specially used to kill demons. There are detailed records of it in ancient books.’

“According to the ancient books, this sword first appeared on an ancient battlefield. Its owner was a powerful expert who could kill countless demons with just a casual swing of the sword. As such, he became someone whose mere name incited fear among the demons.”

“The last time it appeared was during the dark and chaotic period of the ancient era. At that time, its owner had already changed to a young human.”

“Although he was still young, he had lofty aspirations. He traveled across thousands of mountains and rivers, slaughtering all of the demons in the human world, and even killed his way into the strange realm, stabilizing the situation.”

“Every time the Flowing Cloud Sword appears, it would calm down the chaos and prevent all evil forces from taking over.”

“Precisely because of this reason, this sword is considered a legend. Every time before chaos descends, it will inevitably appear.”

After hearing this, the expressions of everyone present changed drastically. They looked at the Flowing Cloud Sword in Gongsun Zhi’s hand in a daze, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Could it be that this kid is the chosen Demon Slayer?”

Everyone was very surprised at this moment. Gongsun Zhi had appeared with the Flowing Cloud Sword in his hand. Did that not prove that he was the chosen one?

If not, how could he have been acknowledged by the Flowing Cloud Sword?

At this moment, no one was willing to admit it.

On the other hand, Gongsun Zhi’s expression was cold as he looked at the incoming sword beams in the sky. He quickly swung the Flowing Cloud Sword to meet the attack.

In an instant, there was a loud bang, as the two terrifying forces collided, unleashing powerful energy fluctuations into the surroundings.

A nearby cultivator had gotten too close in order to watch the fight, and failed to avoid the energy fluctuations. He was sent flying, and immediately spat out a mouthful of blood.

Everyone was already shocked by the two’s attacks, and the atmosphere at the scene turned even more serious.

After her killer move was blocked, Zhuge Yueyue was also pushed back hundreds of meters by the terrifying energy fluctuations before she finally stopped.

Her eyes were still filled with killing intent, but there was a hint of shock in them. This fellow’s sword was very powerful. From the aura it exuded, she could tell that it surpassed the Cloud Heaven Sword.

If Zhuge Yueyue’s Sword Dao was not powerful enough, she might have lost when their sword beams collided. That being said, Gongsun Zhi did not fare much better, and he also retreated a few hundred meters before stopping.

In an instant, he covered his slightly pale face, making him look extremely arrogant again.

“Hehe, it seems that the sword techniques of the Great Wilderness Divine sect are not worth much.’

Hearing his mockery, the expression on her face turned even colder, as if her face was frozen in ice.

However, she still did not choose to take action at this moment. Gongsun Zhi gradually approached hierand said lightly, “l originally thought that Sword Immortal Ye’s eldest disciple would definitely have astonishing attainments in the Sword Dao, but after experiencing it for myself, I realized that it’s nothing more than hot air.’

“If his disciple only has this much strength, then Sword Immortal Ye shouldn’t be all that strong. Hahaha!”

After hearing this, the crowd could not help but start discussing again.

“Oh my god, does this kid not want to live a long life? He actually dared to mock Sword Immortal Ye?”

Everyone was stunned by Gongsun Zhi’s words. Just how arrogant was he?

It was one thing to mock Sword Immortal Ye’s disciple, but he actually dared to mock Sword Immortal Ye directly?

However, some people could see the truth at this moment. Gongsun Zhi did not say this because he was arrogant. He just wanted to anger Zhuge Yueyue.

If a person’s emotions fluctuated violently, it was easy for that person to lose control and act recklessly.

Of course, this ignited Zhuge Yueyue’s anger.

However, she did not look angry. Instead, her face was filled with cold killing intent. In Zhuge Yueyue’s heart, Ye Xuan was her bottomline. If anyone dared to insult him, he would not hesitate to kill them.

“Hehe, Immortal Divine sect? We erased them once, and we can do it again.”

Unlike others, if Zhuge Yueyue was really angry, she would become even calmer. After all, she was an ice-type cultivator, which meant that she would be able to remain clear-headed at all times.

She raised the Cloud Heaven Sword unhurriedly. In the blink of an eye, an ice phoenix condensed in the sky and flew around.

A wave of piercingly cold aura was released, and even the air seemed to freeze.

“Oh no, hurry up and escape!’

After sensing that something was wrong, many of the cultivators fled the scene in order to reach a safe distance,

Gongsun Zhi’s expression changed drastically. He did not expect that Zhuge Yueyue would not only not lose her mind, but somehow even become stronger..
