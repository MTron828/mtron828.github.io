510 Gao Shun’s Arrival

“Senior, what do you mean by that?”

Seeing Han Tai’s imposing manner, Zhuge Yueyue knew that this matter would not be resolved easily. However, she did not panic at all.

“Don’t you understand what I mean? Why did you have to be so heavy-handed?”

“You’re so ruthless at such a young age.”

“Since no one in the Great Wilderness Divine sect didn’t teach you proper etiquette, I’ll teach you on their behalf today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the aura around his body surged. It was obvious that he wanted to attack Zhuge Yueyue.

“Hmph! Simply shameless!”

“When your genius can’t beat her, an old fart like you comes over to bully her instead. Is this how the Supreme Divine sect does things? If you can’t afford to lose, then don’t start a fight in the first place.”

Hearing this, everyone was shocked. Su Changhe had rushed to the front and pointed at Han Tai, cursing him.

Although this young man was not very good at fighting, he was extremely good at humiliating people. They were shocked to see Su Changhe’s boldness.

After all, Han Tai was an elder of a top holy land, while Su Changhe was a weak divine mystic cultivator. What gave him the courage to confront Han Tai?

“Hahaha, this little guy has guts. It’s worth making friends with him.”

Mu Beichen could not help but laugh out loud.

However, what these people did not know was that Su Changhe was inwardly trembling in fear.

However, he still did not regret it. Even though he knew that this elder was an existence he could not afford to offend, he did not back down.

“Old man, act your age. Don’t you know what shame is?”

“This was a battle between us young people. So what if one person loses and gets a little injured? Are you really going to blame someone else for his inadequacy?”

Hearing this, Han Tai’s face turned beet red.

Originally, he just wanted to take revenge for Xie Tianyu, so he found some random excuse.

However, who would have thought that Su Changhe would turn it around and place him into an embarrassing situation instead?

“You little rascal, do you think I need you to teach me how to behave? Are you seeking death?”

Han Tai waved at Su Changhe.

Su Changhe immediately spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying ten meters away as if he had been hit by a punch.

“Changhe!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Young master!”

After seeing Su Changhe being sent flying by Han Tai, Feng Xiyun rushed over.

The Su family members were also furious. They glared at Han Tai.

“Despicable! How can this old man be so shameless!”

Li Hanyi said indignantly, but she could only clench her fists tightly.

After all, Han Tai was an elder of the Supreme Divine sect. Even if they had the advantage in numbers, they would not be able to defeat him.

The more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she felt. If Yuelun had not gone into the ancient tomb, this old man would not have dared to be so arrogant.

His arrogance was only because there were no experts present from the Great Wilderness Divine sect present.

“Little girl, are you going to admit your mistake or not?”

After dealing with Su Changhe, Han Tai once again closed in on Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue replied calmly, “If you really are shameless enough to act, then just do it. As a disciple of Cloud Sky peak, I will never lower my head to someone as despicable as you.”

“You don’t know what’s good for you!”

Han Tai was furious. Zhuge Yueyue had humiliated him time and time again!

“Good, good, good! I’ll teach you a good lesson today!”

Han Tai moved to attack Zhuge Yueyue again.

After seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy decided to ask situ mo to help stop it.

No matter what, they had a good relationship with Ye Xuan.

Just as she was about to speak, a terrifying aura suddenly descended from the sky and locked onto Han Tai.

Moments later, a huge sword struck Han Tai hundreds of meters away.

A closer look revealed that there was actually a white-robed man standing on the sword.

“Martial Uncle!”

After seeing this figure, Li Hanyi laughed out loud and covered her mouth.

However, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression became extremely complicated.

Unexpectedly, it was actually Gao Shun who had helped out. She had once hated this person for a long time.

After seeing Gao Shun, Han Tai’s face instantly turned pale and he began to regret his actions just now.

Gao Shun was the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, and was extremely powerful.

Mu Beichen muttered to himself, “This is unexpected. Why is he here to help?”

Was he not at odds with Cloud Sky peak?

After thinking for a long time without an answer, Mu Beichen simply chose to continue watching.

“Haha, that’s great! As long as Martial Uncle Gao is here, who would dare to bully us?”

...

At this moment, Li Hanyi finally relaxed. She no longer had to be afraid.

Li Xue’er looked at Li Hanyi and asked in a soft voice, “Sister Hanyi, haven’t Martial Uncle Gao and Martial Uncle Ye always been at odds? Why is he here to help at this time?”

After hearing these words, Li Hanyi was stunned.

“This…”

“I’m not sure.”

Li Hanyi, Zhuge Yueyue, and Feng Xiyun were all very confused.
