447 Hellfire Technique

Wang Zuo descended in flames and made a dazzling entrance. A confident smile hung on his face.

“I’m Wang Zuo of Hidden Sword peak. Please enlighten me, Little Junior Sister!”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun also politely returned the bow, “Cloud Sky peak’s Feng Xiyun. Senior Brother, please enlighten me!”

The judge approached them and asked, “Are you both ready? ”

!!

“En!” The two of them replied in unison.

“Very good!”

“In that case, the match starts now!”

As soon as the judge gave the green light, the crowd erupted with excitement.

At this moment, the storage ring on Wang Zuo’s hand rippled, and a sharp sword suddenly appeared in his hand.

At the same time, his ninth-level divine mystic realm aura swept out, shocking the onlookers.

Wang Zuo was truly worthy of being a Hidden Sword peak cultivator. He had reached this level at such a young age!

However, Feng Xiyun remained calm and expressionless.

“Junior Sister, you have to be careful. I won’t show any mercy!”

Wang Zuo roared. The sword in his hand erupted with scorching flames as it slashed towards Feng Xiyun with earth-shattering force.

“Why isn’t she dodging?”

When everyone saw this, they were shocked.

What was she thinking?

Nearby, Gao Shun’s lips curled up when he saw this scene. He was already thinking about how to humiliate Ye Xuan.

However, at this moment, the situation suddenly changed.

Feng Xiyun took a step forward, and the power of the Hellfire technique emerged.

In that instant, a suction force suddenly swept out, instantly absorbing Wang Zuo’s flame attack.

“This… What’s happening?”

“How can Feng Xiyun’s strength be so terrifying?”

The surroundings immediately fell deathly silent, as everyone looked on in shock.

Gongsun Shouyue was also stunned by this.

“It’s actually the Hellfire technique…”

Elder Tongtian als recognized the Hellfire technique.

No one expected Feng Xiyun to be able to wield the Hellfire technique, especially a junior disciple who had barely been cultivating for over a month.

Elder Tongtian took a long look at Ye Xuan. When he saw the calm look on the latter’s face, he came to a realization.

It was no wonder this guy was not worried at all…

However, Gao Shun’s expression was extremely ugly.

“It’s actually the heaven-grade divine power, Hellfire!”

Mu Beichen suddenly pangs of jealousy.

Even though he was the Saint of the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect, he was still not qualified to cultivate heaven-grade divine powers, yet Chief Ye Xuan’s newest disciple was now showing one off.

Such treatment was truly enviable!

Right at this time, Gao Shun said with a dark expression, “Junior Brother Ye, you’ve really put in a lot of effort for the Seven Peaks competition. You actually imparted a heaven-grade divine power to a disciple who has just entered the sect.”

“Why can’t I?”

Ye Xuan smiled.

“I’ve never been stingy with my disciples. As long as it’s suitable for them, I’ll teach them anything and everything.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When everyone heard this, their faces were filled with envy.

This was unbelievable!

How could such a teacher exist?

Furthermore, from Ye Xuan’s current expression, everyone could tell that he did not assign much value to heaven-grade divine powers.

Of course, Gongsun Shouyue and the others were confused.

How and where did Ye Xuan get these divine powers? Could it be part of the legacy left behind by Tian Xuan?

Everyone knew that each peak had its own unique inheritance technique!

Other than the chiefs who were in charge of each peak, no one else had the right to come into contact with it. As such, each peak’s inheritance remained a mystery.

Ye Xuan’s words angered Gao Shun greatly.

Zhuge Yueyue, who was standing behind Ye Xuan, was tickled by this.

It served him right for messing with her teacher!

That being said, she was also very thankful that she had been chosen by Ye Xuan, whose kindness and generosity had allowed her to reach this point despite her humble beginnings.

Su Changhe, on the other hand, was very impressed by Ye Xuan’s posturing.

How domineering!

…

...

After realizing that his flame attack had been completely devoured by the other party, Wang Zuo’s expression turned unsightly. He became even more furious, especially when he noticed the disdainful looks everyone was giving him.

If he lost to Feng Xiyun today, how could he raise his head in front of his fellow disciples in the future?

“Detestable!”

Wang Zuo’s eyes were filled with monstrous anger. The sword in his hand erupted with sword qi, which slightly distorted the space around him.

Since the flame attack was useless, he would crush her with his superior cultivation level!

Wang Zuo’s sword qi swept out, even crushing the tough arena floor as it passed by, stabbing straight for Feng Xiyun’s abdomen.

When everyone saw this scene, they became worried.

Although Feng Xiyun’s Hellfire technique could suppress Wang Zuo’s flame attack, she had only been cultivating for a month. Wang Zuo’s cultivation most likely outstripped hers by a large margin.

“Junior Sister Feng, be careful!”

Many cultivators cried out.
