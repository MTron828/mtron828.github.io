Chapter 213: Too Slow

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He had offended the Blood Moon Temple as well as the Nether God sect.

Was this guy in a hurry to die?

Moreover, the Seventh Prince had said before dying that his master was already on the way to the White Moon Tower.

Could Ye Xuan escape in time?

This guy’s strength was indeed terrifying, but the Radiant Sky Empire was a subordinate force of the Nether God sect. The Seventh Prince’s master was an inner sect elder, and as such had the authority to mobilize the forces of the Radiant Sky Empire.

At this moment, Ye Xuan did not know what everyone was thinking, but even if he did, he would not be bothered by it at all.

There was no such word as escape in his dictionary!

He was more curious about the inner sect elder’s strength and whether he could fight to his heart’s content and get used to his new power.

Ye Xuan was a sixth-level unity realm expert who had comprehended two supreme intents, and also possessed sixth-level sword intent.

That alone was enough for him to have the confidence to face any other cultivator of the same realm.

Other than that, he also possessed two jade tokens containing the power of a pattern condensation realm expert.

“Alright! You guys can start packing up to return with me to the Qingyun sect,” Ye Xuan said to Lin Qingping and her daughter.

To them, although the memories they had of this place were sad, it was still the place they had called home for many years.

Ye Xuan did not take them away immediately, and wanted to let them say goodbye properly.

“That isn’t necessary. We can leave immediately,” Lin Qingping said through gritted teeth.

Now that she had gotten her revenge and her daughter had found an extremely powerful teacher, why should she stay in this sad place? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Moreover, the Seventh Prince’s teacher was about to arrive, so it was better to leave as soon as possible.

Ye Xuan could also sense Lin Qingping’s worry and said with a smile, “It’s just the Nether God sect. It’s nothing worth worrying about.”

When Lin Qingping heard this, she was stunned.

Was her precious daughter’s teacher overconfident? Was he really not afraid of the Nether God sect?

Seeing that Ye Xuan did not elaborate further, Lin Qingping sighed.

Truly, the thoughts of powerful experts were beyond her comprehension. Since he was confident, then he should be able to deal with the Nether God sect, right?

Even so, Lin Qingping’s heart was still filled with worry. She quickly brought Zhao Yuyan into the bamboo house to pack their belongings.

After that, Lin Qingping brought Zhao Yuyan to her father’s grave to pay her respects. Since her father had died after being surrounded by demonic beasts, not even his bones were left.

As such, Lin Qingping could only erect a memorial monument for him without even his ashes.

Ye Xuan just watched quietly and did not speak.

Yue and Li Qingyan also remained silent.

As time slowly passed by, the cultivators who had gathered around the bamboo courtyard all left.

It did not matter whether or not the cultivators of the Nether God sect came. In the end, this was not a fight that they could interfere in.

However, the Tower Master, Dai Weibo, frowned.

Although Ye Xuan did not attack the White Moon Tower, he still felt deeply uneasy.

Under normal circumstances, he should have felt lucky to survive.

But when he learned that ye Xuan didn’t choose to leave immediately, but quietly waited for the strong cultivators of the nether spirit cult, the uneasiness in his heart grew stronger.

If that inner sect elder ordered him to deal with Ye Xuan, what would he do? What would happen to the White Moon Tower?

Ye Xuan cast an indifferent glance at Dai Weibo. The latter’s body suddenly trembled, and a cold chill ran down his spine.

Dai Weibo immediately fled in fear!

Ye Xuan ignored him, and continued waiting quietly in the bamboo courtyard.

He was waiting for the inner sect elder to arrive. He wanted to see how strong he was.

However, after four hours, there was still no sign of this person.

Having waited so long, Ye Xuan was getting a little impatient. Besides, Lin Qingping and her daughter had already packed their luggage.

Since that was the case, then it was best to just leave.

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a cold gleam flashed across his eyes.

“He’s finally arrived!” Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a smile.

Although he did not know how strong this fellow was, he was quite slow!

“Ye Xuan!”

At this moment, a powerful aura swept out. At the same time, a thunderous voice rang out.

The sky was filled with dark clouds, and a strong gale started blowing.

“He has comprehended wind intent? Interesting!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan revealed a look of surprise.

How was someone who had comprehended wind intent slow?

This was something that should have greatly increased a cultivator’s speed, though it would also add a destructive force to the cultivator’s attacks.

It was also said that if a cultivator comprehended wind intent, then they would have a chance of comprehending speed intent, which was known to be stronger.

Furthermore, if they could master that, then it might lead to the comprehension of spatial intent!
