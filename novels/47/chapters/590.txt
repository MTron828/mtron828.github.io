591 Ye Xuan’s Arrival

In complete contrast to before, Ao Lei actually used a piece of Great Desolation jade stone to activate the seven-colored divine light.

Augmented by the Great Desolation jade stone, the power of his attacks were increased a hundred-fold!

Even Yi Feng felt his heart palpitate when he sensed this.

After seeing that the two supreme realm experts had already started fighting, the weaker cultivators began to back off to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

!!

Despite Mo Nan’s powerful attacks, Ao Lei showed no fear at all. After all, what had happened had already happened, so there was no room for regret.

The grudges between the two sects already could not be reconciled.

Boom!

Mo Nan mobilized all of the power in his body and poured it into the Qilin’s body, helping it to launch an even more powerful attack.

After the Qilin roared, it unleashed another extremely forceful attack.

At this moment, Ao Lei also shouted loudly, “Suppress!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he activated the Great Desolation at full power, dispelling the attack.

From the start of the battle until now, the two sides had yet to determine who was stronger. The fact that Ao Lei could resist Mo Nan, despite the latter being stronger than him, showed how powerful the Great Desolation technique was. Moreover, the Great Desolation technique was not in its complete state.

If he could piece together the complete Great Desolation technique, it would definitely be considered the strongest cultivation technique in the East continent.

After dozens of exchanges, Ao Lei felt that he could not hold on much longer due to his lacking cultivation level. He was not only up against Mo Nan, but also the Qilin.

“Hehe, Ao Lei, you’re approaching your limits, aren’t you?”

“The gap in our strength is not something you can bridge just because you have the Great Desolation technique.”

“You’d best prepare yourself for the afterlife.”

Monan laughed impudently, believing that victory was imminent.

Now that things had come to this, even if Yi Feng and Gao Shun joined forces to attack him, it would not matter.

“Oh no, Senior Brother Ao is likely to lose!”

Gao Shun had been secretly storing up power in order to help.

However, at this moment, a huge sword descended upon Mo Nan from the sky, exuding terrifying sword intent.

Mo Nan’s face instantly paled as he dodged. The Qilin beneath his feet was unable to resist the huge sword and died a violent death.

His heart trembled.

“Is that… a divine-rank sword?”

The simple and ancient-looking sword made everyone’s heart palpitate, and for a brief moment, it was as if the sword was the only thing that existed in this world.

Dark clouds formed in the sky, wind surged, and lightning flashed. Killing intent filled the air.

The Godsword had made its appearance, and even Mo Nan, a middle-stage supreme realm expert, was too stunned to move.

“Which expert does this sword belong to?”

Everyone searched the sky to find the owner of the sword.

Mo Nan was terrified by the Qilin’s death.

‘Is the Immortal Divine sect doomed to perish today?’

Even if he felt unwilling about this matter, he knew that this sword was not something he could contend against.

The owner had not even shown himself, yet the sword itself had suppressed him.

Ao Lei and the others were also similarly shocked.

Was this expert here to help them?

Who was he?

The only one with a divine-rank sword was Ye Xuan, and they had all seen the Cloud Heaven Sword.

This was definitely not the same sword.

While everyone was feeling very curious about this, a handsome man in a white robe appeared. He landed on the Godsword, which then slowly descended.

Ye Xuan was calm and looked at Mo Nan mockingly.

“Haha, it’s a good thing I came in time,” he muttered to himself as he observed the situation.

The fiery phoenix divine power was really powerful. With it, he had covered such a long distance within half a day.

It was unlikely that there was anyone in the East continent that could keep up with him now.

After seeing Ye Xuan appear here, everyone’s jaws dropped. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Oh my god, the sword really belongs to him?”

“Quick, give me a slap and wake me up from this dream! Can he actually have two divine-rank swords?”

Gao Shun similarly felt very shocked at this time. He was also inwardly grateful that their relationship had improved from before. Otherwise, he would probably have been beaten to a pulp at some point.
