952 Chaotic Battle!

Seeing so many enemies of the little monkey appear in an instant, everyone was very shocked at this moment, and Ye Xuan was no exception.

However, this made him feel relieved. In this way, Zhuge Yueyue would not have to do anything.

The number of people this little monkey had provoked was simply too large.

After someone shouted, more and more people poured into the area. A battle was about to break out, and the crowd looked on in anticipation.

“Haha, this is interesting. This monkey from the East continent can actually cause such a commotion. Impressive!”

Many people were currently speculating about the origins of this little monkey, as well as who had taught it. However, there were no clues available, even from the cultivation technique the little monkey displayed.

“You damn monkey, return my ten-thousand-year-old ginseng to me!”

After this voice rang out, a strange-looking creature charged toward the little monkey.

“Oh? What kind of creature is this?”

This creature was covered in white spots and was holding a halberd in its hand, and this was the first time Ye Xuan had seen such a creature.

However, just from the aura it released, it seemed rather unique.

“That fellow’s name is Yun Xu. He’s a descendant of the White Dragon clan in the North continent, and a genius that was born as a supreme realm cultivator.”

“Is the White Dragon clan also a branch of the dragon race?”

Yanran waved her hand and said, “It can only be regarded as a branch of the branch. It doesn’t have much of the dragon race’s bloodline.”

“Ah, so it’s like that.”

Ye Xuan finally figured out this person’s background. On the other hand, Wukong simply raised his staff and swung it toward the incoming halberd, sending it flying.

“Hehe, with your pitiful strength, aren’t you overestimating yourself?”

Despite the number of enemies present, the little monkey was not panicking. Instead, he looked very excited.

After all, he was born with a passion for battle. The more people there were, the more competitive he would become.

“Damn it!”

After being pushed back hundreds of meters, Yun Xu felt humiliated. Since he was born, he had never met an enemy who could defeat him. This little monkey could be considered the first.

It was precisely because of this that his heart was burning with rage. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Furthermore, when the others who surrounded the little monkey saw that this fellow was still being arrogant, they could no longer restrain themselves.

“Damn it! Let’s attack together. There’s no way that this little monkey can survive if we all gang up on him!”

“Let’s attack together and skin him alive!”

As soon as these words were said, the scene became chaotic again.

“What the hell did this little monkey do? How did he offend this many people”

Even Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. Fortunately, these people did not know that he was the teacher of this little monkey. Otherwise, he would probably have gotten into trouble as well.

Seeing that her teacher was very confused about this, Zhuge Yueyue recalled the things she had seen this little monkey do in the ancient palace, and then said, “This little monkey is really evil. He waits until the final moment to suddenly appear and snatch the treasures after the fighting is over. He has done this to countless cultivators since the ancient palace opened.”

“That genius from the White Dragon clan also suffered the same fate. He was even knocked unconscious from a blow to the back of his head.”

“Not only was his treasure stolen, but since he was unconscious, the little monkey also stole all of the treasures he had with him, stripping him naked and hanging him on a tree for everyone to see.”

Hearing these words, Ye Xuan was shocked. This little monkey was really the incarnation of a troublemaker. It seemed that the public anger the little monkey was facing was justified.

At this moment, the battle had already begun. Under the siege of the countless experts, the little monkey was at a disadvantage.

The only reason he had not been defeated was due to the strength of his physical body and innate cultivation technique.

If this situation continued, the little monkey would definitely be beaten up badly.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan suddenly thought of the Jingu Staff that he had just obtained, and his eyes flashed with excitement.

The Jingu Staff was an immortal-grade spiritual artifact, so if he gave it to the little monkey, he would probably receive something even more valuable from the system.

‘Haha, let’s do it! After all, the Jingu Staff was yours in my previous world!’

However, how could he give the Jingu Staff to the little monkey without anyone noticing?

This was not a simple matter. After all, Ye Xuan did not want to be associated with the little monkey.

“Damned monkey, die!”

At this moment, a huge figure hurled a punch at the little monkey, causing the air to tremble. This sent Wukong flying, and he spat out a mouthful of bright red blood.

Feeling intense pain, the little monkey was furious. However, he also understood that if this situation continued, he would not be able to survive.

Thus, Wukong turned around and frantically attacked the barrier behind it.
