856 The Incomplete Cloud Sky Technique (Part 3)

As more and more of that power was transmitted into Elder Qian Yi’s body, the purple glow grew stronger, and his damaged body began to recover.

“Could this be the completed Cloud Sky technique?”

When Elder Qian Yi discovered this, he was extremely shocked.

The insights that were pouring into his mind were not inferior to any immortal-grade cultivation technique at all. In fact, they even seemed to be superior.

“My god!”

Elder Qian Yi let out a shocked cry.

“This is the legendary breaking and then rebuilding. Amazing!”

After examining the completed Cloud Sky technique, Elder Qian Yi sighed in admiration. If he could really master this powerful cultivation technique, he might even be able to compete with those who cultivated the Great Desolate technique of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

At the same time, he finally understood why Ye Xuan had crippled his cultivation. Ye Xuan had done this to help him abolish his cultivation and then reconstruct it.

What shocked him the most was that thanks to Ye Xuan’s insights, not only had the Cloud Sky technique been completed, but it had also been improved, to the extent that it became an immortal-grade cultivation technique.

All of the grief and indignation in Elder Qian Yi’s heart dissipated, and was replaced by excitement. He had obtained a heaven-defying opportunity because of this matter.

He said gratefully, “Thank you, Sword Immortal Ye. I will definitely remember your kindness forever. If there is anything you need from me, do not hesitate to ask.”

Hearing his sincere words, Ye Xuan waved his hand and said casually, “Alright, alright. Focus. You have to properly comprehend this cultivation technique.”

“If you can grasp even half of the mysteries within it, you might even be able to reach the ancient realm.”

“This…”

Hearing this, Elder Qian Yi became even more excited.

That was something that Elder Qian Yi had always dreamed of. Previously, he had thought that if he could cultivate to the peak of the supreme realm, he would die happy. As for the ancient realm, it was something that he did not even dare to think about.

Unexpectedly, Ye Xuan’s kindness gave him a new dream. He could not be happier. Without hesitation, he sat down cross-legged and began to cultivate seriously.

As he gained a deeper understanding of the Cloud Sky technique, his veneration toward Ye Xuan continued to increase. Not only did he fix the flaws in the technique, but he even improved it.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “As for how much you can improve, it will rely on your own efforts.”

At the same time, by doing this, he had helped his teacher, Tian Xuan, fulfill his long-cherished wish of completing the Cloud Sky technique.

At this moment, a system notification rang out.

“Ding! Because the host helped Elder Qian Yi complete the Cloud Sky technique, the host has received a critical reward, which is a number of opportunities to complete another cultivation technique.”

“Oh?”

This was the first time Ye Xuan had encountered a reward like this, so he was extremely surprised. However, he was overjoyed, as this inadvertently helped him greatly..

Who would think that there would be such a strange reward for helping others improve their cultivation techniques?

He was eager to try it out, but…

He really had too many incomplete cultivation techniques.

For example, the immortal-grade body refining technique, the Fiery Phoenix technique, the Flora sword technique, and the Boundless Palm technique… Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

All of them were incomplete!

Even the Heaven Burning Flames technique that Feng Xiyun was currently cultivating was incomplete. Therefore, he was faced with a conundrum, and could only hope that he received more than one opportunity to complete a cultivation technique.

However, if Ye Xuan was lucky enough this time and the critical feedback was high enough, he would be able to get more opportunities to replenish these cultivation techniques.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan became even more excited as he quietly waited for the system notification.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained a 100x critical reward and gained three chances to complete cultivation techniques.”

F*ck! Only three?

Why was it 100x again?

Ye Xuan was simmering with anger, and it took him quite a long time to calm down.
