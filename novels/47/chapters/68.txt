Chapter 69: Bring Back The Champion Rank

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Naturally, any heavenly treasures that could increase one’s comprehension value by a large amount had long been consumed by Wan Shanhai.

In comparison, the Heart-seeking Fruit was undoubtedly of average quality. It was precisely because of this that it was being used as a reward for the sect competition.

“Why don’t I give out the rewards for the sect competition?”

Ye Xuan brought up the matter naturally, but he could not help but feel a little awkward as he did this.

Hearing this question, Wan Shanhai stared blankly at him.

According to the rules of the sect, both the sect leader and elders had the right to give out the competition rewards to the disciples, but he still felt that Ye Xuan had sprung this question on him out of nowhere.

After all, from Wan Shanhai’s perspective, Ye Xuan was a genius who was obsessed with cultivation, so he should not be interested in things like the sect competition. Moreover, in order to focus on cultivation, he did not even take in a disciple.

Could it be that Elder Ye Xuan had changed after recovering from his injuries?

Wan Shanhai entertained the thought.

Of course, Wan Shanhai did not refuse Ye Xuan’s request.

After all, Ye Xuan did have the right to give out rewards, as long as the fairness of the rewards was guaranteed.

“That works too!” Wan Shanhai nodded and agreed.

Then, Wan Shanhai waved his sleeve, and three streams of light suddenly appeared in front of him.

One of them was a fruit that was suffused with a thick white light, one was a pill that was covered in mysterious patterns, and the other was a long sword that was surrounded by sharp sword qi.

These three things were the rewards for the top three ranks.

The first place would receive the Heart-seeking Fruit, which had the ability to increase a cultivator’s comprehension value.

The second place would receive an origin condensing pill, which was a first-grade pill. It could help a cultivator quickly condense true essence power, and for cultivators who were at a bottleneck in their cultivation, it had the effect of catalyzing a breakthrough.

The third place would receive the Shuiqing sword, which was a low-grade spiritual artifact.

Ye Xuan looked at them briefly, and then put away the three items.

The reason why he had made this request to Wan Shanhai was because he wanted to use this opportunity to get rewards from the system. How could he miss such an obvious opportunity to gain rewards for free?

The prospect of receiving a system reward by giving someone else’s property to his disciples was something that made him truly happy!

Of course, Wan Shanhai also had many personal disciples, and each one was extremely powerful.

In Wan Shanhai’s heart, one of his disciples would definitely win first place in the sect competition, and it was precisely because of this that he was willing to take out the Heart-seeking Fruit. The so-called sect competition was just a formality.

Ye Xuan also understood this, so when he made the request just now, he felt extremely awkward.

He was intercepting someone else’s reward!

As long as he sent out Li Qingyan, Wan Shanhai’s disciple would not be able to obtain first place in the competition.

Although Wan Shanhai’s disciple was already in the eighth level of the true essence realm, and was only half a step away from the ninth level of the true essence realm, Li Qingyan had the obvious advantage over him.

The cultivation methods and martial techniques that Li Qingyan cultivated were all extremely high-level. Most importantly, Li Qingyan’s comprehension value was extremely high.

Ye Xuan had yet to spar and train with her. As long as Ye Xuan trained Li Qingyan’s actual combat experience, the latter’s actual combat ability would be greatly strengthened.

Therefore, the probability of Wan Shanhai’s disciple defeating Li Qingyan was extremely low.

“Sect Leader, are there any rewards for the competition of the three great sects that can increase comprehension?”

After Ye Xuan put away the rewards for the Qingyun sect competition, he asked another question.

Wan Shanhai first nodded, and then shook his head.

“The heavenly treasures for the competition of the three great sects are provided by the three great sects themselves, and there are a total of three rewards. For the champion’s reward, I provided a thousand-year ice silk armor, the Huolie sect provided a third-grade soul returning pill, and the Shenshan sect provided the most generous reward, which is an extremely rare heavenly treasure called the Spirit Burst Flower!”

“However, among these three rewards, only the Shenshan sect’s reward has the ability to improve a cultivator’s comprehension value! This thing is even more precious than the Heart-seeking Fruit. I had not expected the Shenshan sect to have been willing to pay such a price!”

Having said this, Wan Shanhai smiled and continued.

“But at the same time, this also means that the Shenshan sect believes that they have a great chance of becoming the champion of the three great sects competition! It is said that the Shenshan sect has indeed produced a disciple with an extremely monstrous level of talent!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Wan Shanhai could not help but look at Ye Xuan.

Of course, no matter how monstrous the other party’s level of talent was, it could not be compared to Ye Xuan.

Unfortunately, Ye Xuan’s cultivation had grown too rapidly. Now that he was an elder of the Qingyun sect, he had already lost the qualification to participate in the competition between the three great sects.

“It seems that the Shenshan sect is indeed very confident!” Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

Obviously, whether it was the Shenshan sect or Wan Shanhai, they all felt that their disciples would definitely be able to win the competitions, which was why they were willing to take out such rare heavenly treasures as rewards.

After all, a farmer’s waterway would not flow to an outsider’s field. If they were not certain that their disciples could win the competitions, they would not have been willing to pay such a price.

There were less than five days before the Qingyun sect competition, but a full 24 days before the competition between the three great sects.

He had plenty of time.

Then, Ye Xuan bade farewell to Wan Shanhai and returned to Lingjiu peak.

As soon as he arrived at Lingjiu peak, he immediately called Li Qingyan and Yue over. He planned to properly prepare his disciples during this period of time, so as to increase his chances of winning the competitions.

“Greetings, Teacher!”

Li Qingyan and Yue bowed to Ye Xuan.

“Rise!” Ye Xuan nodded, and then said slowly, “In five days, our Qingyun sect competition will commence. You will represent me and participate. Just bring back the champion rank!”

“We will obey Teacher’s orders!” Yue and Li Qingyan responded obediently.

“However, before you participate in the sect competition, I will try my best to raise your cultivation levels!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on his two disciples.

Other than admiring his disciples’ fairy-like beauty, he was also examining their information. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
