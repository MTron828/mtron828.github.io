Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As everyone watched, Zhuge Yueyue made her presence known. As she flew up into the sky, her fluttering dress gave off an ethereal feeling, and she seemed like a fairy that had descended upon the mortal world.

Upon seeing her, someone in the crowd immediately shouted, “She’s the first disciple of Sword Immortal Ye!”

“Good heavens! ”

Everyone was extremely shocked at this moment. Gongsun Zhi’s originally arrogant expression also turned serious at this moment. His eyes were fixed on Zhuge Yueyue.

After a moment of careful observation, even he was stunned by Zhuge Yueyue’s peerless beauty, and it took him a few minutes to snap back to his senses.

“Haha! Are you finally willing to show yourself? I really thought that you would hide forever.’

Gongsun Zhi sneered, his eyes filled with killing intent.

There was no doubt that the real purpose of his earlier actions was to lure Zhuge Yueyue out. This was the only reason he had come to the treasury.

He had heard about Zhuge Yueyue’s deeds and prowess from others, but he definitely did not acknowledge her as a rival. Due to his pride, he would never allow any genius stronger than him to exist.

Moreover, the Immortal Divine sect had a grudge with the Great Wilderness Divine sect, which made him even more determined to defeat her. He wanted to do so publicly so that her undefeated record would come to an end at his hands, and thus establish the superiority of his sect over hers.

Zhuge Yueyue was also staring at Gongsun Zhi with a cold expression. She remained silent as if she was thinking about something.

After a while, Zhuge Yueyue also displayed a disdainful expression and said, “Haha, the Immortal Divine sect?”

“I can remember one thing now. The great battle on the shore of the

Boundless Coast a few days ago was caused by your sect members, right?”

“Perhaps you guys secretly captured and trapped the disciples of our Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

After thinking for a while, Zhuge Yueyue finally understood what was going on. In addition to the clues she found, she finally figured out the ins and outs of this matter.

She had once gone to the Boundless Coast and met many people from the Immortal Divine sect there.

At that time, she had just said goodbye to the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect as she had wanted to go to other places to see if she could obtain any opportunities.

However, she never expected that, not long after she left, the members of the Great Wilderness Sect would have a big battle with the members of the

Immortal Divine sect.

When she returned to the Boundless Coast, the scene was extremely chaotic, and there was nothing left.

Initially, Zhuge Yuetue did not think that something had happened to her sect members. After all, Ao Lei was with them, so it would not be so easy for them to encounter misfortune.

However, after meeting this fellow and connecting the dots, she realized that something was unusual about this matter.

Gongsun Zhi did not say anything after hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words. He just stared at Zhuge Yue without saying a word.

However, the smile on his face was enough to tell that her conjecture was correct. Realizing this, her gaze became even more murderous.

“Good! Since you’ve made the first move, don’t blame me for what happens next. Our Great Wilderness Sect never provokes others, but if others dare to provoke us, we will never be merciful!’”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue instantly released her aura, causing the air to freeze. Moments later, her Sword Dao aura swept out, and it almost seemed that the domain around her had been filled with sharp swords.

She tightly gripped her sword as she said coldly, “I’ll let you experience just how powerful my Sword Dao is!”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue’s body shot up to 10,000 meters in the air, and sword beams began to condense in the sky one after another.

“My god, aren’t these sword beams too terrifying?”

The entire world trembled, and the expressions of the onlookers who saw this scene also changed drastically.

Gongsun Zhi could not help but turn serious. He could clearly feel that what he had just done had angered Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue then swung the Cloud Heaven Sword at him and roared, “Take your pride and die!”

Her earth- shattering killing move tore through the sky. Gongsun Zhi’s face was filled with panic.

“What a terrifying sword move. Has this woman’s talent in the Sword Dao reached such a terrifying level?”

The densely packed sword beams were as numerous as raindrops, so anyone within the range of the Sword Dao Domain would not be able to escape.

“Hiss…”

“This person’s talent in the Sword Dao has reached an extremely shocking level. Even if it were me, I wouldn’t have the confidence to win. It seems that there are indeed many talented people in the human race.”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At this moment, even the arrogant golden tiger felt a sense of crisis.

Gongsun Zhi, who was facing the full brunt of Zhuge Yueyue’s attack, was panicking. He had long heard that Zhuge Yueyue was extremely talented in the Sword Dao, but had thought the information to be fake.

He believed that he would easily be able to deal with her. Unfortunately, things had gotten out of hand now.

After a moment of panic, Gong Sunzhi’s face actually showed an extremely excited expression. His desire to fight had completely aroused. It was not easy to meet an opponent of the same level.

As the number one genius disciple in the South continent, he could not cower here.

“Hehe, are we going to compete in the Sword Dao? This is getting interesting.”

Gongsun Zhi’s expression gradually became calm as he watched the dense rain of sword beams descend from the sky…
