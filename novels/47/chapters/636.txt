637 Bribery Again

Had it not been for the fact that he was weaker than Ye Xuan, he might have picked a fight with the latter. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Who could bear to see their offspring like this?

Ye Xuan replied with a smile after hearing Li Dahai’s question.

“Senior Brother Li, don’t be like that.”

“My little disciple is only six years old, but your little boy is already ten years old. Moreover, he has been taught by you for such a long time, so his combat strength must be pretty good, right?”

“How could that little girl beat up your boy like this?”

Upon hearing this, Li Dahai suddenly had the urge to spit out blood.

‘That’s right, my kid is already 10 years old, and getting beaten up by a 6-year-old girl is kinda shameful.’

‘But what’s not right is that the disciple you accepted is simply a weirdo.’

Li Dahai could not believe it and went over to check personally just now.

As hard as it was to imagine, that six-year-old girl actually created a pit several meters deep in the ground with a hammer!

Li Dahai was already a few hundred years old, but this was the first time he had seen such a thing.

Even the study hall had been turned into ruins by this little girl’s hammer.

Fortunately, the little girl did not use her full strength. Otherwise, this kid of his would probably have been smashed into meat paste by the hammer.

His expression turned darker and darker, but he was helpless. The little girl’s teacher was not someone he could deal with. He had to endure it even if he could not help it.

‘You only know how to cry non-stop all day long. Can’t you act a little more your age?’

‘How many times have I told you not to provoke that little girl, but you just wouldn’t listen!”

Li Dahai cursed. After a while, he looked at Ye Xuan and said, “Junior Brother Ye, I’m sure you understand your senior brother’s situation very well. If I really bring this bruised and swollen kid back, I really won’t be able to answer to the tigress at home.”

“Don’t blame me for being shameless. If you can’t give me an explanation today, I’ll just blame you when I go back.”

Li Dahai knew very well that he was no match for Ye Xuan, so he had no choice but to resort to this.

‘No matter what you say, my son was beaten up by your good disciple. Just tell me what you want to do.’

Ye Xuan did not know what to say after hearing this.

Who could have imagined that Li Dahai, who was mighty and powerful in the outside world and would go to war at the slightest disagreement, would actually be afraid of his wife?

Ye Xuan looked at Li Yi, who had been beaten black and blue, and pondered the matter.

‘Wait a second! Didn’t I just refine a cauldron of high-grade soul returning pills?’

At the thought of this, Ye Xuan’s lips curved into a smile. He coughed a few times before saying, “Senior Brother Li, what you said just now wasn’t without reason.”

Moments later, he took out a low-quality high-grade soul returning pill from his storage space.

Ye Xuan said hesitantly, “”Senior Brother Li, you have my apologies.”

“This little girl of mine is indeed too mischievous. She often causes trouble for me and even beat Martial Nephew Li Yi up so badly.”

“I can’t bear to see him like this. I happen to have a soul returning pill here. Take it. It’ll help him recover from his injuries.”

With that, Ye Xuan reluctantly handed the high-grade soul returning pill to Li Dahai.

Li Dahai was dumbfounded when he saw this. His eyes were fixed on the soul returning pill in Ye Xuan’s hand.

F*ck! He was able to give away such a precious pill so easily…

‘I knew he had a lot of treasures, but seeing it for myself is really something else.’

He suddenly felt that his son’s beating was not in vain.

After being beaten up, he actually got a high-grade soul returning pill. This deal was really worth it.

Perhaps this should become a regular occurrence…

“Junior Brother Ye, you’re really too polite.”

“We are brothers of the same sect, and the disciple you accept is my martial niece too. It’s very common for kids to have some small conflicts.”

“Actually, you don’t have to be like this. It’s just a little fun between kids. It’s not worth it for you to give up a high-grade soul returning pill,” Li Dahai said nonchalantly, but his hand movements betrayed him, as he quickly put away the pill.

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded by this. It seemed that his senior brother had the qualifications to vie for an Oscar award.

Impressive!

“Ding! Congratulations on giving Li Dahai a high-grade soul returning pill. You have received a 10,000x critical reward.”

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained an immortal-grade blood recovery pill!”

Immortal-grade?

Ye Xuan was pleased as punch. The system was being good to him again.
