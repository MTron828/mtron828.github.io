809 Heavenly Tribulation (Part 2)

Thanks to how terrifying this heavenly tribulation was, they could estimate how amazing l Ye Xuan’s potential was.

However, people were also very regretful at this moment. After all, very few experts had ever been able to survive a heavenly tribulation of this level.

It seemed that today, another peerless genius would fall.

Ye Xuan’s actions were indeed too arrogant and conceited. He should have chosen to break through with only one Dao in order to succeed.

“Hmph! Biting off more than you can chew. If you die, it serves you right!”

After hearing this, those from beyond the barrier looked over in unison, only to discover that the person who had said these spiteful words was Ou Yunhai, who was pleased to see Ye Xuan in danger.

As long as Ye Xuan was gone, Yanran would belong to him!

“Oh, why did Young Master Ou take the time to come here today?” an old man asked with an evil smile. His eyes were fixed on Ou Yunhai, and he even sized up his body unabashedly.

It was obvious that this person had taken a fancy to Ou Yunhai.

After noticing the old man’s expression, Ou Yunhai felt goosebumps all over his body once he realized what kind of person this old man was.

“Hmph! Elder Nightmare, do I have to report to you wherever I go?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere at the scene immediately turned heavy. However, Elder Nightmare only smiled lightly and did not take it to heart.

“Elder Nightmare, heed my advice and restrain yourself a little. Don’t air your disgusting thoughts in the open and make me angry.”

Ou Yunhai gritted his teeth as he said these words. Then, he angrily waved his sleeves and turned to leave.

Even though he looked very brave, he was still a little afraid.

“Haha…”

Elder Nightmare laughed wickedly as he watched Ou Yunhai leave, and even licked his lips. He was as perverted as one could be.

“That young man is really not bad. His character is also fiery enough to match my tastes…”

As soon as he finished speaking, all of the young men nearby instantly trembled and broke out into cold sweat. All of them wanted to leave now.

Many people in the Heaven continent were familiar with this old man, who was pretty much the same as the white-browed old man back then. They both cultivated extremely evil cultivation techniques.

However, the white-browed old man only liked women, while Elder Nightmare preferred men.

Someone like Ou Yunhai fit his tastes to a tee.

Many young men would tremble in fear when they saw him, and could not help but tighten their legs. Who could withstand it?

Boom!

At this moment, a loud explosion erupted, redirecting everyone’s attention.

“This… What happened?”

Looking closely, the crowd finally noticed that the situation on Ye Xuan’s side had changed, and countless bolts of heavenly lightning were cascading down.

“Dear god! With so many bolts of heavenly lightning striking him at the same time, no matter how many lives he has, it won’t be enough!”

Everyone was dumbfounded. Their pupils involuntarily dilated as they watched the deluge of heavenly lightning strike Ye Xuan.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Xuan was buried within a sea of heavenly lightning.

At this moment, Ye Xuan did not dare to hold back at all. He mobilized every ounce of spiritual power in his body to strengthen his defense.

The heavenly tribulation he was currently experiencing was the one for his Dao of Body Refining. If he passed it, the other heavenly tribulations for his the Sword Dao and Dao of Merit would be much easier.

“You want to take me down with just this? Don’t even think about it!”

After roaring that fiercely, dense golden divine runes instantly enveloped him.

Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock once again. Those divine runes had successfully blocked the heavenly lightning!

Ye Xuan’s three Dao Flowers then emitted even more dazzling divine light, constantly absorbing the power contained in the heavenly lightning. After a while, they turned back into three flower buds.

Ye Xuan used all his strength and instantly sat in the Dao Flower that had fused with his Dao of Body Refining.

“Oh my god, did he really succeed?”

“Did he survive such a powerful heavenly tribulation?”

At this moment, everyone was dumbfounded. Although Ye Xuan looked very miserable now, and even the flesh on his body was charred in many places, everyone could see the faint immortal aura released from Ye Xuan’s body.

Only those who had successfully passed the heavenly tribulation would possess such an aura!

“Unimaginable! This is really unimaginable!”

At this moment, an ancient realm expert exclaimed in disbelief.

“He’s really crazy, crazy!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This expert’s world view had been changed. At his age, this was the first time he had seen such a thing. Therefore, he could only describe this series of events as pure lunacy.

Could it be that the current era had changed and was no longer suitable for an old man like him?
