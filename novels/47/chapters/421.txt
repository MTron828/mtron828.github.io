422 Zhuge Yueyue’s Strength

“What a headache!”

“I can’t be bothered to study this thing right now. I’m lacking too much information.”

Ye Xuan put away the beast bone and lay down on the bed.

In the morning, Ye Xuan opened his eyes in a daze. After washing up he pushed the door open and walked out.

“Eh? Are those two girls still lazing around in bed?”

As soon as Ye Xuan walked out of his room, he noticed that the door to the room next to his was still closed. He thought that Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue were still in bed.

Suddenly, he looked up at the mountain peak when he sensed two surging auras.

“Not bad! They’re quite diligent!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yue had already woken up, and were on the mountain peak cultivating.

Ye Xuan did not disturb them. Instead, he returned to his room and began to cultivate.

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue only returned when the sun was high in the sky.

“Teacher, we’ve returned from our morning cultivation,” Feng Xiyun said happily as soon as she entered the courtyard.

Today, not only did she wake up early to cultivate with Zhuge Yueyue, but they also toured the beautiful scenery of Cloud Sky peak in their spare time.

This was completely different from her days in the palace. It was a carefree life that she had never had before. She could truly let herself go and follow his heart.

In just a day, Feng Xiyun had completely adapted to life on Cloud Sky peak. She felt extremely warm at heart. Here, there was a teacher who loved her dearly and also a considerate senior sister.

Feng Xiyun’s heart was filled with happiness.

When Ye Xuan, who was cultivating, heard this, his tightly-shut eyes slowly opened. A bright divine light flashed across the depths of his pupils. Then, his gaze fell on Feng Xiyun, and his face revealed a satisfied expression.

“Mm! It was indeed a good habit to cultivate diligently. Xiyun, have you been able to adapt to life on Cloud Sky peak?”

“Master, I feel that life on Cloud Sky peak is great. It already feels like the home I never had. I feel very happy!”

“Hmm, that’s good!”

“Cloud Sky peak is different from the other peaks. We don’t have complicated rules. As long as you don’t break the rules of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, you can do whatever you want,” Ye Xuan said with a smile, and then he ended his cultivation session.

“The Seven Peaks competition is coming, and the two of you will be representing Cloud Sky peak in the competition.”

“Every Seven Peaks competition is of great significance to the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It is the time when the strength of our peaks are compared.”

“Since I’m free today, I’ll check the results of your training.”

“Yueyue, you’re the first disciple of Cloud Sky peak, so you can go first.”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue stood up and followed Ye Xuan to a bamboo forest on the mountain peak.

Feng Xiyun watched from the side with a curious expression.

Zhuge Yueyue slowly raised the Cloud Sky sword in her hand. The pressure in her heart increased.

If she was facing other cultivators of the same level, Zhuge Yueyue had absolute confidence that she could defeat them. However, the one standing in front of her was her teacher, an extremely powerful mystic lord realm expert.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue was a little nervous.

“Hu!”

Zhuge Yueyue closed her eyes tightly and took a deep breath, slowly calming herself down.

“Teacher is testing my strength. I have to use 120% of my combat strength.”

“Let’s begin! You can use any technique!”

Hu!

“Teacher, I’m going to attack.”

As soon as she finished speaking, the Cloud Sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand unleashed sharp sword qi, and then she used a powerful divine power and slashed the sword toward Ye Xuan.

The sword qi was extremely sharp, and the surrounding bamboo leaves were instantly split into two.

However, the sword was easily caught by Ye Xuan with two fingers.

Zhuge Yueyue’s reaction was also extremely quick. The sword shook and broke free from Ye Xuan’s fingers. Then, she stopped and turned the Cloud Sky sword around, slashing and stabbing in a flurry of storm-like attacks.

However, Ye Xuan moved so quickly that he managed to dodge all of her attacks. Given his cultivation level, he could easily see and predict her movements. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Of course, among her peers, Zhuge Yueyue’s actual combat prowess was already pretty good. She did not reveal too many flaws.

The Cloud Sky sword technique she displayed was natural and smooth. It was just that Ye Xuan was far too powerful.

Left with no other choice, Zhuge Yueyue could only use her trump card, the Nine Serenities of Frost.

In an instant, the Cloud Sky sword released an ice-cold aura. The temperature in the area dropped significantly, and the bamboo leaves that were moving with the wind froze instantly.

There was a terrifying chill in the air that could even freeze the soul of a cultivator.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan nodded to himself.

When combined with the profound ice divine bone, the Nine Serenities of Frost could directly attack the soul of a cultivator.

“Teacher, you have to be careful!”

Zhuge Yueyue reminded him, and her expression turned extremely serious.

The Cloud Sky sword in his hand transformed into an ice sword, and the icy aura condensed into a huge Ice phoenix that rushed toward Ye Xuan.

If the two of them had the same cultivation level, and Ye Xuan did not use the Flora Sword technique, it would indeed be quite difficult for him to face the combined power of the profound ice divine bone and the Nine Serenities of Frost.

“Very good! It looks like you’ve already learned how to combine the power of your divine bone and divine power!”

Ye Xuan nodded in satisfaction. With a wave of his sleeve, a powerful energy burst out and instantly dispersed the sword qi and the ice phoenix.
