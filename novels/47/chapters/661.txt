“Third Sister, we don’t need to waste time here. Let’s go inside first.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue pulled Xiang Yun and Feng Xiyun and entered the entrance with a flash.

Upon seeing this, Daoist Guo Hao became even more enraged.

“Damn it! You surrounded three people and half of you ended up seriously injured. You didn’t even hurt a single hair on their heads. What use do I have for you?”

!!

Hearing this, the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples could only lower their heads, not daring to say a word.

The Daoist Gu Hao was currently in a fit of anger at this time, and Gao Shun thought this was an appropriate time to chime in.

“Hahahaha… Looks like you guys have embarrassed yourselves again, huh?”

Gao Shun continuously circled around Daoist Black Iron and jabbered on, directly causing the latter to spit out a few more mouthfuls of blood.

After ridiculing them for a while, Gao Shun felt satisfied as he returned to where the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s forces were smiling happily.

“This feels really satisfying!”

He had forgotten how long it had been since he had felt so satisfied. Furthermore, watching a six-year-old girl beat up a group of disciples like that really was quite awesome.

Almost all of the people present were from the major forces. They had all witnessed the scene that had just happened. For the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect to not be able to stand up to a single little girl, how weak were they?

“Hehe…”

Even the stoic-faced Ao Lei could not help but chuckle at this moment. Even if Xiang Yun did not get a good ranking this time, her reputation had already been cemented. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When she really started to cultivate, how powerful would she be?

Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were equally shocked.

After a moment, Daoist Canghai smiled and said, “Hehe, this little girl really has the potential to reach the sealed immortal realm.”

Daoist Xu Yun also turned around and looked at Ye Xuan.

“Little Brother Ye Xuan, this disciple you’ve accepted really has unlimited potential!”

“You’re too kind. My disciple’s potential is quite normal, really,” Ye Xuan said very calmly, but his heart was already bursting with joy.

Once all of the participants entered the ancient realm, a burst of golden light flashed in the sky before a giant screen of light materialized, displaying a real-time broadcast of what was happening inside the ancient realm.

How convenient!

Inside, Zhuge Yueyue and the others had already arrived at a barren plain, alongside the disciples of many forces.

A huge mountain peak stood in front of them. The mountain peak seemed to ascend into the sky, and the peak was shrouded by the clouds.

They could sense danger on the mountain, but there were many paths that led to the top. She could already see some people climbing up.

Zhuge Yueyue looked up coldly and was constantly on guard against those around her.

At this moment, Feng Xiyun came forward and said, “Yueyue, Hua Rufeng has already led a group of disciples to start climbing up. Should we follow him?”

When they entered, Feng Xiyun had paid special attention to the movements of the other members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Seeing that many of them had already started climbing, she asked for Zhuge Yueyue’s advice.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue spotted Mu Beichen, who was still calm and collected. He was looking at the cultivators above him with a mocking expression, and clearly had no intention of climbing up.

Then, she looked around and noticed that the Reincarnation Fairy was also waiting in the same place, unbothered that everyone was climbing up.

“Forget it, let’s wait first. There’s no need to rush.”

After thinking for a while, Zhuge Yueyue made her decision.

The competition at the gathering was very fierce, and one could be eliminated if they were not careful.

It was precisely because of this that Zhuge Yueyue would rather wait a little longer. It would be best if she could set off right after Xie Tianyu of the Supreme Divine sect, and perhaps tail him to take him out.

At the foot of the mountain, seeing that there were still many people who were not moving, the atmosphere became a lot more tense.

“What’s going on now? Why aren’t these people climbing up?”

“I don’t understand either. It’s making me so anxious. Forget it, I can’t wait any longer. I’ll make my move first!”

The crowd were puzzled, but still chose to hurriedly climb up the mountain.

After all, they did not want to encounter these geniuses while they were climbing, as that would put them in a bad spot.

Originally, they had wanted to let the geniuses go first, and they would climb up later. However, the fact that the geniuses were waiting threw them a curveball.

On the other side, in a hidden corner, Xie Tianyu was staring coldly at Zhuge Yueyue.

A few of the disciples beside him spoke up angrily, “Senior Brother Xie, that little girl seriously injured many of our people just now. She even killed one of them. Should we go over and take revenge now?”

“As long as we defeat them all, they won’t even have the chance to enter the rankings.”

After thinking for a while, Xie Tianyu said, “forget it. Zhuge Yueyue is quite strong, and it wouldn’t be good to start fighting now.”

“It’s not the time yet. When they’re climbing up, we’ll deal with the other two first. It’ll be considered as collecting some interest.”

When he said this, he laughed very proudly. His eager appearance made it seem as if he could not wait to make a move.

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue had already noticed Xie Tianyu’s malicious gaze and immediately glared back at him.

She had already felt that something was wrong. Suddenly, she noticed that Xiang Yun was looking around and came up with a plan.
