“Since they didn’t believe me, I had to prove it to them!”

Hearing Xiang Yun’s words, Elder Huang’s face darkened. Why was someone always messing with this little girl?

They knew the consequences, but provoked her anyway!

Sigh…

“What happened after that?”

“They still didn’t believe me after I destroyed the church, so I beat them up.”

“After a while, a few senior brothers happened to pass by here. They tried to attack me, so I fought them.”

Elder Huang turned around and found that several people from the main peak had been beaten up, each of them with a swollen face.

They had never expected that they would not be able to defeat a six-year-old girl.

Just as she was about to continue speaking, a figure appeared in a flash, and Ye Xuan was already beside her.

After seeing Ye Xuan appear, everyone present relaxed.

If he had not hurried over, they were really afraid that the meeting hall would be demolished as well.

This little girl was not afraid of anything. As long as she wanted to do something, she had the guts to do it.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle Ye…”

The group of disciples quickly saluted Ye Xuan. Unlike Elder Huang, Ye Xuan was the chief of Cloud Sky peak and was renowned for his strength. He was the object of their worship.

Ye Xuan waved his hand at them and stared at Xiang Yun without saying a word.

He had already understood what had just happened.

This was indeed her usual style.

“Yun’er!”

Xiang Yun was frightened and quickly lowered her head, unable to say a word.

After a while, Ao Lei also arrived. Seeing the study hall in ruins, his face darkened.

‘Sigh. It’s not unexpected at all. This little girl really knows how to kick up a fuss.’

“Junior Brother Ye, can’t you give me a moment’s rest?”

“Senior Brother Ao, you have my apologies. The cost of reconstructing the study hall will be borne by Cloud Sky peak.”

Ye Xuan smiled awkwardly.

Ye Xuan was both helpless and impressed by his disciple. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Ao Lei was looking helplessly at Xiang Yun, who was in turn looking at Ao Lei with an aggrieved expression. The staring contest was quite comical.

After sighing helplessly, Ao Lie said, “Forget it. Let’s just leave this matter as is. There’s no need for Junior Brother Ye to foot the bill. It’s not expensive anyway.”

Ao Lei felt a sense of lingering fear. Fortunately, he had brought the children from his peak back in advance, or they would have been beaten up as well.

“Junior Brother Ye!”

Just as Ye Xuan was about to speak, Elder Huang ran over.

“It’s best if you don’t send your little girl here. I really can’t continue to teach her.”

“Just do me a favor and let me. I really can’t take it anymore.”

Without hesitation, he took out the two treasures that Ye Xuan had given him before and said, “Junior Brother Ye, please take these two things back. I really can’t accept them.”

“Can we just drop today’s matter?”

Ye Xuan was also very helpless and did not take the two treasures that Elder Huang handed back.

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Xiang Yun. He did not know whether to laugh or cry.

In any case, her journey of learning how to read and write this time had to be declared over.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan said in embarrassment, “”Ahem, Elder Huang, you can keep those two things. Consider it a small gift from me.”

“I’m really sorry that this happened again. I won’t trouble you with this little girl’s literacy anymore.”

Hearing this, Elder Huang’s mood improved.

“Teacher …”

Ye Xuan was about to continue when Xiang Yun shook his arm and spoke pitifully, “This time… I can’t continue to learn how to read and write?”

Hearing this, he helplessly coaxed her, “It’s fine. You can definitely continue to read and write. I just have to find you another teacher, okay?”

After thinking for a while, Xiang Yun tilted her head and said, “Will there be other children playing with me?”

Ye Xuan was very scared. At this time, she still wanted to play?

If he let that happen, then perhaps even Cloud Sky Palace would be torn down. No, that could not be allowed! Cloud Sky Palace was brand new.

At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly noticed Gao Tianyu, who was standing in the crowd, and said slyly, “Ahem, if you want to play with someone, I’ll bring you to Hidden Sword peak and you can play with their disciples, okay?”
