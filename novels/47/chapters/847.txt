Ye Xuan stood beside his two disciples without saying a word. After seeing the two of them struggling, he was also very anxious.

The spiritual power he had imparted to them was too overwhelming. It was indeed very difficult for them to completely refine it with their current cultivation levels. If they were not careful, they might even be seriously injured.

Therefore, Ye Xuan was silently regulating the spiritual power that was coursing through their bodies. This way, they would not suffer too much damage.

While Ye Xuan was secretly giving his two disciples special treatment, the other peaks had also sprung into action to strengthen their disciples.

After the appearance of the Heavenly Stairway, everyone was rushing to come up with ways to improve their disciples’ strength, with the hope that their disciples would make them proud and become immortals. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As long as one reached the top of the Heavenly Stairway, the forces they belonged to would also be able to obtain a great amount of fate energy.

At this moment, when Ye Xuan saw that his two disciples had already refined most of the spiritual power, he relaxed.

Zhuge Yueyue had already reached the late stage of the mystic lord realm, and would need time to consolidate her cultivation before she reached the peak of the mystic lord realm.

As for Feng Xiyun, she broke through to the mystic realm, but also needed to consolidate her cultivation before she could improve further.

In addition to the spiritual power he had infused into their bodies, his spiritual power had also been purified by the immortal heavenly treasure, and was thus incredibly beneficial to them.

If she was able to completely refine it, Ye Xuan even felt that Zhuge Yueyue would definitely be able to reach the supreme realm.

“Oh?”

Suddenly, as his two disciples were about to wake, Ye Xuan suddenly sensed an unfamiliar figure flying over from afar, heading toward the sect’s main peak.

However, what puzzled him was that after checking out this person’s aura, he actually discovered that the cultivation technique this person cultivated also came from the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Could it be that he came from the Heaven continent?”

This person must have come from the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven Continent!

Now that the eight continents had been unified, the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent must have discovered the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the East continent.

Since they both shared the same origins, it was a good thing to explore if there were opportunities to collaborate, and perhaps even merge.

In any case, Ye Xuan was no longer the chief of Cloud Sky peak, so there was no need for him to care about such matters at all.

“Teacher…”

Ye Xuan turned around and realized that Zhuge Yueyue had woken up.

She had been constantly refining the spiritual power that Ye Xuan had transmitted to her for several days, and had not even had the time to rest, so she was very tired.

“Adjust yourself properly first. The most important thing is to examine the changes in your body and adjust accordingly.”

“This time, your strength has grown significantly, so you need to consolidate your cultivation properly to avoid creating any lasting problems.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan took out a pill for her to consume.

Zhuge Yueyue obediently consumed the pill and closed her eyes to adjust herself. Feng Xiyun also woke up after a while, and Ye Xuan repeated the same process.

“Ding! The host has given two pills to his disciples, and has obtained a critical reward!”

Hearing this notification, Ye Xuan was a little stunned. These pills were quite useful, and were the same ones he had used himself to sustain himself in the fight against Mengyu.

He did not have much of them left, so he briefly wondered what sort of pills he would receive from the system this time.

After all, Ye Xuan was also in need of similar pills at the moment. He only had seven immortal-grade recovery pills left, and each one could be considered a life-saving trump card.

Also, since his critical multiplier earlier was pretty bad, this one would be better, right?

“Ding! Congratulations on obtaining a 10,000x critical reward…”

Woohoo!

Although he did not hear clearly what kind of medicinal pills he received, the 10,000x critical reward meant that it would be something good.

Not bad!

After a moment of excitement, Ye Xuan muttered to himself, “Hee hee, let me take a good look at what items have been given to me…”
