676 Fate Energy

Ye Xuan was smiling from ear-to-ear. He already knew what was going on. After all, before sending his disciples off, he had already given them many recovery pills. Even if they suffered serious injuries, they would be fine after eating one or two.

“What should we do now?”

The remaining people exchanged glances, not knowing what to do next.

“If we don’t run away now, then we’ll be eliminated!”

!!

“Move quickly!”

As soon as this person finished speaking, he rushed up the mountain, and was soon followed by the rest of the group.

They actually felt quite lucky. At the very least, they could still participate in the gathering.

Feng Xiyun allowed them to leave, choosing instead to tend to Xiang Yun. As her junior sister had just expended a lot of energy, she took out a soul-returning pill and fed it to her.

After Xiang Yun ate this pill, she felt a large amount of energy flowing into her body, and felt rather comfortable.

Lying in Feng Xiyun’s embrace, her eyelids unconsciously closed, and she fell asleep.

Ye Xuan felt rather sheepish when he saw this scene. Each and every one of his disciples were quite unique it seemed. The gathering was taking place, yet Xiang Yun was happily asleep.

Feng Xiyun was also somewhat taken aback, but chose not to wake her up. Instead, she quietly hugged her and let her sleep.

On the other side, Zhuge Yueyue had already arrived in an independent space, and her sharp sword aura filled the space.

In front of her sat a slender woman. They had not fought yet, and were just sitting quietly opposite each other.

As time passed, Zhuge Yueyue suddenly thought of her junior sisters and missed them very much.

At this moment, the potential ranking list appeared before their eyes. In first place was Mu Beichen, and in second was the Reincarnation Fairy.

When she scanned the list, she finally spotted the name she was looking for, Xie Tianyu in 11th place.

Looking at this name, Zhuge Yueyue’s gaze suddenly turned extremely cold.

The woman in front of her was frightened by this. Simply being in the same space as Zhuge Yueyue gave her a lot of pressure.

However, Zhuge Yueyue had not made a move, so she did not act rashly.

After seeing the potential ranking list, was she going to make a move?

“I won’t play around with you anymore. Let’s end it here…”

Zhuge Yueyue walked over immediately.

Seeing this scene, the woman tensed up. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

No matter what, she was a late-stage void realm expert. Was Zhuge Yueyue really so confident that she could deal with her so easily?

Zhuge Yueyue had already unsheathed her Cloud Sky Sword and released several sword beams, and the woman failed to react in time and was pierced by these beams.

“This… can’t be happening…”

His eyes were filled with doubt and disbelief.

“I’m sorry. ”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue swung her sword one final time and eliminated the woman.

After doing this, a door suddenly appeared in front of Zhuge Yueyue, and wisps of fate energy surged into Zhuge Yueyue’s body.

After absorbing the fate energy, Zhuge Yueyue’s comprehension ability seemed to have increased significantly. She stretched out her palm and looked at it carefully, muttering to herself, “So this is the fate energy that Teacher told me about?”

Before they set off, Ye Xuan had already told her what to take note of at the gathering and how to accumulate fate energy.

Every time she defeated an enemy or broke a certain record, she would be rewarded with fate energy.

However, if you were defeated by the enemy during the gathering, 80% of the fate energy you obtained would be taken away by the enemy.

It was for this reason that if one wanted to obtain the maximum amount of fate energy, they had to become the champion of the gathering.

Zhuge Yue Yue did not hesitate and directly stepped into the door.

Streaks of light engulfed her, and Zhuge Yueyue appeared in a new independent space. In this place, she would face a new opponent.

“Hahaha, I’m actually matched with a girl again. I’m really too lucky. It looks like my ranking is going to rise again!”

After seeing Zhuge Yueyue, a young man in a gray robe said these words with a mocking tone. He was completely certain of his victory.

“I am Shangguan Qing from the Myriad Ghost sect. Please enlighten me!”

The young man revealed his background openly.

Zhuge Yueyue glanced at him and said calmly, “I am Zhuge Yueyue from the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

After hearing this, the young man’s expression instantly stiffened.

“Zhuge…Zhuge Yueyue?”

Damn it!

Was this person not Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple?

The gathering had been going on for some time now, so why was she still at such a low rank?

The smile on his face withered away. He had gotten the short end of the stick. He had wanted to avoid fighting these geniuses, so he chose to wait for quite some time before climbing the mountain.

However, despite his best efforts, he had just encountered one.

“Cough cough… You… You’re the eldest disciple of the sword immortal. I’ve heard a lot about you,” he said with a trembling and flustered voice.
