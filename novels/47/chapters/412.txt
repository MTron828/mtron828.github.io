413 The Saint And The Saintess

“Oh my God, I didn’t expect our grandmaster to be so powerful. Even his weapon is enough to frighten the Lin family!”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, her eyes shone.

It seemed like today’s matter could be resolved.

‘As expected of Teacher, he actually left behind a trump card for Senior Sister.’

“Father, what should we do now?”

!!

The atmosphere instantly turned extremely awkward. Lin Dong’s face was pale as he looked at Lin Youming with a worried expression.

“Damn brat, you’ve caused a disaster. I’ll beat you up when I get back!”

“I warned you before to be more restrained during this period of time, yet look at what you’ve done!”

“You should be glad that their teacher isn’t in Qingyang City. Otherwise, even the Immortal Divine sect wouldn’t be able to save your life!”

Lin Youming had an exasperated look on his face.

Upon hearing this, Lin Dong’s face turned even paler, while his heart was filled with regret.

However, Lin Youming was also clear that now was not the time to criticize Lin Dong. The most important thing now was to solve the current problem.

He forced a smile and looked at Zhuge Yueyue with an obsequious smile.

“I didn’t expect you to be a disciple from the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Fortunately, we didn’t fight just now. I happen to have a good relationship with Chief Gao Shun. If I had known that you two were from the Great Wilderness Divine sect, my Lin family would have treated you with the utmost courtesy. Thankfully, we avoided the worst case scenario.”

Lin Youming had a pained look on his face as he delivered an Oscar-worthy performance.

When Lin Dong saw this, the corners of his mouth involuntarily twitched. As expected of his father, his skin was truly as thick as an iron wall.

How could Zhuge Yueyue not know Lin Youming’s intentions?

However, Ye Xuan was not by her side at the moment, so it was not good to make a big deal out of it. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Pa pa pa!”

At this moment, a round of applause suddenly rang out from a tall building not far away.

When everyone heard this, they looked in the direction of the sound. They saw three people atop a tall building.

A handsome young man was standing in the middle, and two old men were sitting behind him.

The young man was dressed in green and had an extraordinary bearing.

“It’s really exciting! I didn’t expect to see such a good show in Qingyang City!”

The young man’s lips curved into an arc as he praised the performance teasingly.

Then, he gave Lin Youming a thumbs-up.

However, what puzzled everyone was that Lin Youming was not angered by the young man’s provocative behavior. Instead, there was respect on his face.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun was a little puzzled.

“Who is this person? Why is the head of the Lin family so afraid of him?”

Zhuge Yueyue shook her head as well, indicating that she did not recognize this young man as well.

However, at that moment, Su Changhe, who was beside them, became terrified. His body could not help but tremble.

“Heavens! It’s the Saint, Mu Beichen!”

“Saint?”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she frowned. It seemed that this young man’s background was quite frightening.

Su Changhe quickly said, “Mu Beichen hails from the ancient Mu family. He was born with a Dao body!”

“He is the Saint of the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect. Although he’s young, he’s already reached the ninth-level of the materialization realm!”

“His level of talent is extremely monstrous, and the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect has high hopes for him. They say that he has a high chance of becoming a sealed immortal realm expert in the future!”

“He is considered to be on the same level as the Saintess from the Jade Lake Divine sect, the Reincarnation Fairy, and Baili Dongjun from the Supreme Divine sect.”

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue looked at each other when they heard this. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

This person was actually a ninth-level materialization realm expert!

It was no wonder was the Saint of the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect. Even the eldest disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Hua Rufeng, was only a fifth-level materialization realm expert.

At that moment, Zhuge Yueyue felt a sense of pressure.

Before they left the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Ye Xuan had already instructed her to broaden her horizons while training in the outside world and to see the peerless geniuses among her peers.

“Don’t be proud of your own achievements. You must understand that there is always someone better.”

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun did not think much of it.

After all, Zhuge Yueyue was the successor of Cloud Sky peak, and not her.

It could be said that Mu Beichen’s arrival had made the originally awkward situation even more depressing.

Everyone looked up at the building with a serious expression. Of course, they were not afraid of Mu Beichen himself, but the two old men beside him.

One of them had an aura as vast as the ocean. It was obvious that he was at the very least a mystic lord realm cultivator.

“Hiss!”

“As expected of the direct descendant of an ancient family. He actually has a mystic lord realm guardian by his side!”

When Su Tiansheng saw this, his pupils shrank, and he took a deep breath.

A mystic lord realm expert was beyond his ability to deal with.

At this moment, Lin Dong was so scared that he almost peed his pants. His body could not help but tremble, and he did not know what to say in this situation.

However, at this moment, there was a bright streak of light in the sky. A few figures suddenly appeared on the other side of the building.

When everyone saw this, they could not help but look up, and were promptly dumbfounded.

A peerless beauty had suddenly appeared there. She hovered in the sky barefoot, and two bells hung on her ankles.

Her aura indicated that she was infinitely close to the void realm.

“Hiss!”

“It’s the Reincarnation Fairy. What’s going on? Why have two peerless geniuses showed up in Qingyang City?”

Su Changhe’s mouth was wide open when he saw this.
