Chapter 287: Is This What It Feels Like To Have a Good Teacher?

“You all should properly cultivate your spiritual sense tempering technique and strive to regain perfect control over your own strength as soon as possible!”

“After that, you can cultivate the martial techniques and cultivation methods that I taught you previously. I’ll also be your sparring partner in my spare time,” Ye Xuan said to Yue and the others.

“We will heed Teacher’s instructions!”

Yue, Li Qingyan, and the others replied in unison. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright! Come with me.”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on Shangguan Wan’er. With a wave of his sleeve, a huge spatial crack suddenly appeared, leading into the spatial turbulence.

Shangguan Wan’er’s cultivation level was too high, so the side effects of the system’s rewards later would likely cause a huge commotion.

After careful consideration, Ye Xuan decided to deal with it in the spatial turbulence.

“En!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded, feeling a little excited. She followed Ye Xuan into the spatial turbulence.

As soon as they entered the spatial turbulence, Ye Xuan grabbed Shangguan Wan’er’s hand and turned them both into heavenly lightning bolts, flashing into the depths of the spatial turbulence.

Within a short period of time, they covered an enormous distance and arrived at an extremely obscure place in the spatial turbulence.

This place was filled with extremely destructive power, and there were extremely sharp spatial blades flying everywhere around them.

After that, Ye Xuan took out the Tower of Heaven and brought Shangguan Wan’er into its internal space.

“How do you like it?”

As soon as they arrived at the inner space, Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a smile.

“The traces of spatial intent here are so strong!”

A strange light flashed across Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes.

“Then, how about now?”

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and a mysterious energy spread out.

“What? This is the power of karma. You actually comprehended karmic intent?”

Shangguan Wan’er’s expression changed drastically.

Her eyes were filled with shock.

After Ye Xuan activated the power of karma, she could see the karmic lines between her and Ye Xuan.

Shangguan Wan’er was dumbfounded.

The reason why she wanted to obtain the Tower of Heaven was because of the spatial intent contained within it. However, she did not expect the Tower of Heaven to also contain karmic intent.

That alone increased the value of the Tower of Heaven several times over..

“Do you want the Tower of Heaven?”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a smile.

“The Tower of Heaven was personally refined by the master of the Moon Demon Holy Land 200,000 years ago with the assistance of an ancient almighty expert.”

“The ancient almighty expert’s artifact contained the power of karma, which is why the Tower of Heaven contains karmic intent.”

“Unfortunately, the Moon Demon Holy Land was destroyed by a terrifying force back then!”

“Therefore, if you obtain the Tower of Heaven, you will also have to bear its karma!”

“I promised you that I would give you the Tower of Heaven, but now is not the time,” Ye Xuan explained.

“Thank you, Teacher!”

Although he would not give it to her immediately, Shangguan Wan’er was still very happy.

Ye Xuan was even willing to give her such a precious treasure.

She was touched.

Spatial intent and karmic intent were both legendary supreme intents!

“Don’t worry. It won’t be long before that day.”

“I will also help you comprehend even more supreme concepts, and from there, help you stabilize your cultivation foundation in the pattern condensation realm!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded.

“Now, I’ll give you some stuff!”

As soon as he finished speaking, three pills appeared in Ye Xuan’s hand.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes brightened. These three pills were perfect fifth-grade pills.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the soul refining pill (fifth-grade), the host has received a randomized 67x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the soul dream pill (sixth-grade)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the body-tempering flame pill (fifth-grade), the host has received a randomized 70xx critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the body-tempering phoenix flame pill (sixth-grade)!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the destruction pill (fifth-grade), the host has received a randomized 50x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the destruction pill (sixth-grade)!”

System notifications popped up one after another in Ye Xuan’s mind.

These three pills were the ones Ye Xuan had gotten from Yue and the others.

“It’s time for you to change your weapon!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and a longsword that glowed aqua blue glow suddenly appeared.

“This sword is called the waterfall sword. It is a high-grade mystic weapon. It suits you perfectly!”

After that, Ye Xuan handed the waterfall sword to the stunned Shangguan Wan’er.

Originally, her weapon was only a high-grade magic weapon. This waterfall sword was vastly superior to her original weapon.

Was this the benefit of having a good teacher?

Shangguan Wan’er could sense that the waterfall sword contained ice and water intents. If a cultivator could comprehend these two martial intents, their attack power would be greatly enhanced.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the waterfall sword (high-grade mystic weapon), the host has received a randomized 28x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the demon sky sword (supreme-grade divine weapon)!”

A black longsword emitting demonic light suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s storage space.

While Shangguan Wan’er was examining the sword, Ye Xuan took out another item.

It was a fruit that was emitting a warm light.

“Ding! As the host has given the exquisite jade fruit to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 300x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the jade lotus seed!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes brightened.

After giving so many things, he finally got one with a high multiplier.

Both the exquisite jade fruit and the jade lotus seed were heavenly treasures that could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value.

While Shangguan Wan’er was immersed in her joy, Ye Xuan took out the bloodsoul dream spirit flower.

“Herem this is for you,” Ye Xuan said.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er took it, a happy smile on her face.

Her cold and aloof demeanor had evaporated.

The bloodsoul dream spirit flower could greatly increase a cultivator’s comprehension value, and its effect was even greater than that of the Datura flower.

As long as one refined it, one would be able to experience an epiphany for 10 days.
