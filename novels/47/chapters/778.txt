779 Confidence Or?

That strange monster was already extremely powerful, but if there was an even more powerful master behind it, how could they survive?

Anxiety filled Gao Shun’s heart.

However, Ye Xuan simply waved his hand and said, “I’m not sure, but from the looks of things, that expert has probably also reached the sealed immortal realm.”

“This…”

Yuelun turned pale with fright. Ancient realm experts were already difficult to deal with…

Would they be able to stop a sealed immortal realm expert?

Seeing their nervous expressions, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Yuelun, don’t worry. In our world, because of the restrictions of the laws of the world, those who come from other worlds will have their strength suppressed here.”

“If that expert really dares to come to our world, I will definitely teach him a proper lesson.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a smile. He had full confidence in his ability to deal with that expert if the latter had reached the sealed immortal realm.

He had already begun to cultivate the fourth move of the Flora Sword technique, and believed that he would be able to hold his own against sealed immortal realm experts.

The main problem was Mengyu, who was a native of this world, and who also had Daoist Yi Feng’s immortal bones. Even if he did manage to kill her, she would just resurrect herself with the immortal bones, and would then know how to avoid his killing moves.

This was the reason why Ye Xuan was apprehensive. Those immortal bones were basically a cheat-code. How did the laws of the world even allow such a thing to exist?

This problem was further compounded by the fact that currently, the only one capable of fighting these strange monsters and Mengyu was him. If he revealed too many of his trump cards, they would not be trump cards anymore.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s confident words, Yuelun and Gao Shun were extremely shocked.

“Are you lying to us? Can an ancient realm cultivator really kill a sealed immortal realm expert?”

“This isn’t the time to joke or show off, you know…”

Gao Shun was truly in disbelief and felt that Ye Xuan was being overconfident.

Ye Xuan rolled his eyes at him.

“Senior Brother Gao, you don’t seem to have confidence in me anymore…”

This was a sealed immortal realm expert they were talking about here!

Sure, Ye Xuan was strong, but there was a whole major realm difference between him and a sealed immortal realm expert. Could he really kill one?

“Junior Brother Ye, it’s not that I don’t have confidence in you, but if you really want to brag, it should be done under reasonable circumstances.”

“What if I really manage to do it?”

Hearing that, Gao Shun instantly quivered. Why did Ye Xuan look like he was being serious about this?

No, how could this be?

“If you can really do it, then you would have convinced me,” Gao Shun said shamelessly, leaving Ye Xuan dumbfounded.

That was it?

However, no matter what, it was indeed good to be able to convince someone.

“That’s fine too. Just open your eyes wide and watch.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned to his three disciples and gave them some instructions before returning to Daoist Yi Feng’s side.

However, just as he was about to move, he suddenly felt the rainbow-colored robe tremble. It was as if someone in the distance was trying to contact him.

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan was stunned. He looked at the sky above his head and instantly thought about the Heaven continent.

At this moment, at the boundary of the Heaven continent a beautiful girl was standing and looking at the constantly trembling barrier in confusion.

Behind her, a white-haired old man also frowned as he examined the barrier.

“This is really strange. Why has the barrier been trembling over the past few days? It seems that it might collapse soon.”

“Could it be that the prediction back then was true?” Old Master Sun muttered to himself in confusion.

Curious, Yanran asked, “What prediction?”

Old Master Sun waved his hand and said emotionally, “The ancestors of our Great Wilderness Sect predicted that the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Saintess will appear when the great disaster strikes.”

“The Saintess’ mission is to save people from the abyss of suffering.”
