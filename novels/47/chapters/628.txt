After soaking in the pond, her body temperature finally dropped, and she looked at Ye Xuan pitifully.

“Teacher, can I not soak in that cauldron?”

Seeing her miserable appearance, Ye Xuan pretended to be a little disappointed. He sighed and said, “Sigh, if you really don’t want to, then forget it.”

“I’m afraid that you won’t be invincible among your peers in the future.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but burst out laughing. When she realized that she had lost her composure, she quickly covered her mouth.

Teacher really knew how to handle her!

Not surprisingly, after hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Xiang Yun was completely won over.

“No way! I will be invincible among my peers. No one can take that title from me.”

With that, she clenched her small fists and walked over to the cauldron again. She reached out to test the temperature inside and shrank back.

However, when she remembered her teacher’s words, she closed her eyes and jumped into the cauldron again.

Her face immediately flushed red from the heat.

Unable to bear the pain, she gripped the rim of the cauldron tightly and gritted her teeth.

At this time, Ye Xuan was also carefully observing her condition.

“Relax your body and mind. Don’t try to resist this power. Instead, absorb it into your body.”

Hearing this, she immediately obeyed and absorbed the power according to the circulation flow route that Ye Xuan had taught her yesterday.

Stimulated by this power, a golden lotus gradually appeared around her body.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan frowned. Something unexpected had happened.

The moment the golden lotus appeared, her body started to emit a terrifying suction force, continuously absorbing the medicinal power in the cauldron.

In just a short while, she absorbed half of it.

At this moment, a faint golden light appeared around her, enveloping her entire body.

As time passed, the golden light that surrounded her body shimmered, and then dissipated, revealing a much older-looking Xiang Yun with long hair.

Zhuge Yueyue and Ye Xuan were both dumbfounded when they saw this.

At this moment, she seemed to have transformed into an unparalleled beauty. She sat there alone and looked into the distance, giving off an extremely lonely feeling. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Teacher… What’s going on?”

After regaining her senses, Zhuge Yueyue immediately asked Ye Xuan.

At that moment, the fairy seemed to look at Zhuge Yueyue.

The moment their eyes met, Zhuge Yueyue immediately fell into a dazed state.

Although she could roughly see the fairy’s figure, she could not make out the details at all. It was as if there was a fog blocking her face.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue also understood that this fairy’s power was beyond her imagination. If she had not been related to Xiang Yun, she was afraid that the simple glance she had just seen would have injured her severely.

When she thought of this, Zhuge Yueyue felt a sense of fear.

‘How unexpected! Junior Sister’s background is so amazing!’

No one would have been able to imagine that this cute little girl would become such a terrifying figure in the future.

Ye Xuan rubbed Zhuge Yueyue’s head and transferred some spiritual power into her body to help her get over the shock.

“Yueyue,” he said, “You can’t tell anyone about what you just saw. Do you understand?”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded with a serious expression and said, “Teacher, I understand.”

“Alright, you can go and cultivate now. Leave this to me.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan looked at the figure again.

Zhuge Yueyue glanced at her master before returning to her room to cultivate.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was so excited that he could not speak. However, his expression was still very calm as he looked at the figure from afar.

‘This must be the great expert who reincarnated as Xiang Yun. My guess was right!’

‘I’m really looking forward to the day when Yun’er regains the memories of her previous life.’

‘Things are getting more interesting.’

The Boundless Cauldron suddenly trembled, and released a terrifying amount of energy.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan reached out and suppressed the energy.

After a while, Xiang Yun’s face turned even redder, and white smoke rose from her body as her cultivation level began to rise.

In the blink of an eye, he had already broken through to the divine mystic realm, and it was not stopping there.

Then, she broke through to the materialization realm!

Now, the strength of her punch could probably reach about one million jin!
