516 Teasing Senior Sister

The sudden sound caused Yuelun to jump up in shock.

“Is there something wrong with your brain?”

Yuelun was currently in a state of shock and fear, and even her legs had started to tremble slightly.

Ye Xuan burst into laughter after seeing this scene, looking extremely proud of himself.

He had suddenly thought of this idea to scare this senior sister of his. He had not thought that it would be so effective, to the point that even her face was pale from fear.

Even though Yuelun’s eyes were already shedding tears, he did not seem to care at all. Instead, he laughed heartlessly.

“You damned brat, you actually laughed so loudly!”

Yuelun could not help but feel regret. She should not have worried about Ye Xuan’s safety or searched for him.

Hmph!

Although she had found Ye Xuan, she was not happy at all. He was obviously furious.

Moments later, Yuelun raised her fist and threw a punch at Ye Xuan.

However, no matter how one looked at it, the two of them seemed like a young couple playing around.

Ye Xuan also understood that he had indeed scared Yuelun just now, so he did not avoid it. He stood there obediently and let Yuelun hit him a few times.

After a while, Yuelun finally recovered, but she still looked extremely angry.

Ye Xuan stared into Yuelun’s eyes and smiled as he asked, “Senior Sister Yuelun, why did you come here?”

“Brat, do you even need to ask? You followed the heaven devouring divine sparrow into this ancient tomb without sending word. Aren’t you afraid at all?”

After hearing Yuelun’s words, he moved his mouth close to Yuelun’s ear with a sneaky look in his eyes. After blowing a breath of air, he asked teasingly, “Could it be that Senior Sister Yuelun was concerned about my safety?”

“Get lost! I don’t care about you. I just happened to come here and found this place unusual so I entered.”

Yuelun answered without any hesitation. However, her red face had already betrayed her.

However, at this time, Ye Xuan deliberately put on an act and replied, “Sigh, that’s so disappointing. I thought that Senior Sister Yuelun would be concerned about my safety. It turns out that I was overthinking things.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“No…”

After seeing Ye Xuan’s sad expression, Yuelun became nervous, afraid that he would misunderstand her.

No matter what, she was indeed concerned about Ye Xuan, and had come all the way here to find this place.

However, just as she was about to confess everything, she suddenly noticed Ye Xuan’s sneaky-looking eyes and immediately knew that Ye Xuan was messing with her.

“You little brat!”

Yuelun’s face was already red from anger. This brat Ye Xuan kept toying with her time and time again. In the end, she was the one who was too sentimental.

At the thought of this, Yuelun could not help but swing her fist at Ye Xuan again.

However, Yuelun lost her balance and fell toward him instead.

Ye Xuan did not hold back and instantly caught Yuelun in his arms. After all, such an opportunity did not come by often, so he had to treasure it.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could smell the alluring fragrance of her body.

However, when he lowered his head, he saw an even more peculiar scene, and he could not shift his gaze away.

Who would be able to refuse such a strange scene?

At this moment, Yuelun could clearly hear her own heartbeat. She panicked and did not know what to do.

Ye Xuan’s embrace gave her a very warm and safe feeling. This was also the reason why she was reluctant to push Ye Xuan away, even though she knew that Ye Xuan was taking advantage of her at this time.

“This stinky brat…” Yuelun muttered.

She could not understand what was going on with her current state. Why was her heart beating so fast?

‘Yuelun, oh Yuelun, you’re really useless. You’ve cultivated for such a long time in vain. You can’t even control your own heartbeat in such a minor situation.’

However, as Yuelun was loathing her own lack of control over her emotions, she met Ye Xuan’s gaze once again, and her heart went out of control again.

After a long while, Yuelun finally broke free from Ye Xuan’s embrace and calmed down.

She pretended to be calm and moistened her throat, but was interrupted by Ye Xuan just as she was about to speak.

“I say, Senior Sister Yuelun, why does your body give off such a fragrant scent? Did you grow up eating spices?”

“It’s really too mesmerizing. Senior Sister Yuelun, come over and let me smell it again.”

“Get lost!”

Yuelun felt as if a ball of fire was burning on her face, and her emotions that had finally calmed down were once again in turmoil.

“Hehe!”

Ye Xuan laughed out loud.

He had discovered a new source of entertainment. Perhaps in the future, he would go over and tease Yuelun.

Yuelun was already gritting her teeth in anger, but still felt a little excited inside after hearing Ye Xuan’s words.

At least it seemed that she was attractive to him in that manner.

However, that was another matter altogether. This stinky brat was just too annoying.

After laughing for a while, Ye Xuan finally quieted down and returned to the topic.

“Alright, alright. Senior Sister, I won’t tease you anymore.”

“I believe that Senior Sister has already noticed the extraordinary nature of this cave, right? Do you want to cultivate here for a while?”

Hearing this, Yuelun was stunned. In fact, she had already discovered that this place was not ordinary, but she had never thought of cultivating here.
