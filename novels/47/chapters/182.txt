Chapter 183: Tear Space Apart

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was precisely because of this that the red-armored man set the limit of bone age at 50.

Under the age of 50, perhaps some cultivators could indeed break through to the fourth level of the unity realm, but his strength was already at the peak of the fourth level of the unity realm.

As such, how could they defeat him? After all, he was also a peerless genius of that era.

Thinking of this, Ye Xuan suddenly felt very unhappy.

After fighting for so long, this guy actually wanted him to give up before the finishing line. What kind of joke was this?

‘I came here to obtain an inheritance and to obtain a technique that can temper my spiritual sense, not to listen to your rambling words!’

Boom!

Two terrifying forces fiercely collided, causing the space around them to tremble.

Ye Xuan blocked the attack.

“Very good! You really aren’t disappointing me!”

The red-armored man hovered in the sky, a smile hanging from the corners of his mouth.

Although he had only released ordinary sword qi just now, he was already very surprised that Ye Xuan was able to block his attack.

However, if Ye Xuan’s methods were limited to just this, it was absolutely impossible for the former to defeat him.

Moments later, the red-armored man held his two longswords aloft and attacked Ye Xuan.

Stab, sweep, slash…

The attacks came at Ye Xuan like a storm.

Not only that, the sword qi was imbued with second-level sword intent.

“As long as I defeat you, I will clear the level?”

Ye Xuan asked as he blocked the red-armored man’s attacks.

“Of course!”

The longswords in the red-armored man’s hands danced as he replied with a smile.

The strength Ye Xuan displayed continued to surprise and excite him.

This kid was an absolute genius, and even more terrifying than the geniuses of the Holy Land where he had been from.

“If I defeat you, will I be able to obtain the inheritance of the Tower of Heaven?”

The Divine Sword in Ye Xuan’s hand released tyrannical blood-colored sword qi.

“Of course!”

The sword qi that burst forth from the red-armored man’s longswords became even sharper and more precise.

“Then, does it include a method to temper one’s spiritual sense?”

At this moment, the divine sword in Ye Xuan’s hand suddenly emitted a bright light, directly bisecting the red-armored man’s sword.

“Third-level sword intent?”

Seeing this, the red-armored man’s gaze displayed his surprise.

Then, the red-armored man looked deeply at Ye Xuan and said with a smile, “Of course there’s a method to temper one’s spiritual sense!”

“That’s good! Then let’s end this battle quickly!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s pupils surged with a monstrous fighting spirit!

The power of the innate dual-spirit physique and the Sword Overlord body swept out!

“Dual special constitutions?”

Seeing this, the red-armored man’s eyes trembled.

During the battle just now, he had already noticed that Ye Xuan’s control over the power in his body had reached 100%.

One had to know that even when he was at the fourth-level of the unity realm back then, he had not achieved such a feat.

Perfect control over power, dual special constitutions, and third-level sword intent…

This kid was truly astonishing!

“Good!”

The red-armored man roared, and the energy in his body surged forth frantically.

He was serious. He wanted to use all of his power to defeat Ye Xuan!

This kid wanted to obtain his inheritance so easily? That was impossible!

Although the red-armored man admired Ye Xuan very much, he would not give up his inheritance easily.

The red-armored man spread his hands, and the two longswords suddenly disappeared. Then, he clenched his right hand, and a giant sword suddenly appeared in his palm. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Giant swords were his true specialty!

Moments later, his second-level sword intent poured into the giant sword, as he unleashed the full power of cultivation level.

Then, the red-armored man suddenly disappeared, and instantly appeared above Ye Xuan’s head. The huge sword in his hand shone with a world-splitting light, and then slashed fiercely at Ye Xuan.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan immediately narrowed his eyes, and all of the power in his body surged forth explosively, coupled with the augmentation of the innate dual-spirit physique and Sword Overlord body.

The violence of the fire element, the endless life of the wood element, and the terrifying and tyrannical sword qi of the Sword Overlord body made Ye Xuan’s strength increase by four to five times instantly.

Third-level sword intent!

Ye Xuan slowly raised the Divine Sword aloft. Then, he slashed out!

The power of this attack far surpassed the Three Thousand Thunder technique.

Boom!

Accompanied by a flash of purple light, the two destructive forces collided, creating violent energy shockwaves that rampaged wildly.

Spatial cracks started appearing, swallowing and spitting out void power that could destroy everything.

As for those who were waiting for Ye Xuan’s result in the War God Hall, their bodies suddenly began to tremble uncontrollably. They suddenly sensed danger.

The next second, everyone saw cracks suddenly appearing at the top of the Tower of Heaven.

“How… How is this possible? Even space was shattered?”

“What happened? How could space be shattered?”

“It’s Ye Xuan! He’s challenging the final boss!”

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help but exclaim in surprise.

Just how terrifying was this fellow’s strength? He could even tear space apart!

How was this fellow so terrifyingly strong?

Everyone felt their hearts tremble. Fortunately, the spatial cracks repaired themselves almost instantly.
