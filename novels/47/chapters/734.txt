735 Dream On

When the people learned that the little girl was actually the reincarnation of a mighty expert, they were all very shocked.

“Indeed, this fact has been confirmed by Daoist Canghai of the Jade Lake Divine sect.”

“Her Teacher is Sword Immortal Ye, who has taught her many divine powers. She’s extremely powerful.”

“You guys missed the action. During the gathering, this little girl was extremely fierce and used her hammer to single-handedly defeat almost all of the disciples of the Supreme Divine sect. She then reached the summit and became the champion.”

“Don’t be fooled by her appearance. If you make her angry, she is beyond terrifying,” a certain man said this with a sense of lingering fear. When he recalled the scene back then at the gathering, he still felt goosebumps.

Whenever he saw cute little girls now, he tried his best to avoid them.

When the others heard this, they also widened their eyes in surprise.

“Heavens! That sounds too unbelievable. So our East continent actually has such a powerful little girl?”

“If this little girl continues to grow, given her outstanding talent, she will become another overlord in the future.”

At this moment, everyone’s eyes were filled with yearning.

If this little girl really became a peerless expert, as fellow disciples, they might be able to obtain some benefits.

While some were discussing intensely, some of them had already sunk into deep thought, thinking about how they could successfully join the Great Wilderness Divine sect or even the Cloud Sky Peak.

“Ahem, I have to make preparations for the assessment in 30 days. ”

“If I am lucky enough to join Cloud Sky peak, then I will definitely be able to rise to the top in the future.”

At this moment, everyone’s thoughts were the same.

Everyone present knew very well how powerful Ye Xuan was. As long as they could build even the slightest relationship with Ye Xuan, they would probably be set for life.

Even the people from the major powers had to give them some face.

Some time ago, Feng Xiyun had accompanied Xiang Yun to explore the outside world. The resulting scene was really too spectacular.

No matter where they went, there would definitely be experts who would come out to protect them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There were even some peak-level mystic lord realm experts who followed behind them quietly.

As ordinary people, they had never seen anyone who could actually get the experts from other factions to voluntarily come forward and protect them. Thus, they believed that if they could join Cloud Sky peak, they would be able to walk freely in the East continent without fear of any danger.

On the other side, Li Hao, who was in charge of guarding the gate, could not help but laugh when he saw these people indulge themselves in their fantasies.

“Haha, it’s broad daylight, so why are there so many people daydreaming?”

Not to mention these people who had not even joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect, even most of the disciples of the sect wanted to join Cloud Sky peak.

In addition to how well Ye Xuan treated his disciples, just the Water Cloud Fruit Tree on the peak was enough to benefit them endlessly. However, there was no opportunity to join Cloud Sky peak.

After all, Ye Xuan had already stopped taking in any disciples a long time ago. Moreover, he was different from the other chiefs, and would only take in disciples when the right person and opportunity presented itself.

This was why Cloud Sky peak had so few disciples. In comparison, the other peaks took in large numbers of disciples. A large portion of these disciples even came from some large families and were accepted as a gesture of goodwill.

Seeing that the group of people outside were still immersed in their fantasies, Li Hao sniggered. Anyway, they would realize the cruel reality sooner or later.

Elsewhere, Zhuge Yueyue was sitting quietly in the Cloud Sky Palace, planning her next course of action in the coming days.

After Hua Rufeng had finished telling her about the recruitment ceremony, he had returned to the main peak. Some time later, Feng Xiyun led Su Changhe and the others to the Cloud Sky Hall.

“Sister Yueyue, we finally meet again.”

Su Changhe came forward with a smile on his face, but he suddenly remembered something and said awkwardly, “Ahem, I’m used to calling you that. I should have called you Master Zhuge just now. Hahaha.”

After all, Zhuge Yueyue was now in charge of managing Cloud Sky peak, so it was reasonable for Su Changhe to address her like this.

However, Yueyue did not think so, and she quickly corrected him, “Please don’t. Just call me Sister Yue Yue.”

As such, Su Changhe did not stand on ceremony and said straightforwardly, “Sister Yue Yue, my father instructed me to bring over a hundred experts from the family to help you.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue glanced at the group of people brought by Su Changhe.

Most of these people had reached the void and heaven realm.

As it so happened, Cloud Sky peak was currently lacking manpower, so the Su family’s appearance here had helped her out this time.

She still remembered that her teacher had specially reminded him that the Su family had once helped them. Thus, if the latter encountered a crisis, they should definitely help.
