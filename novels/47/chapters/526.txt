527 Heaven Continent

“Which factions are these two supreme realm experts from?”

Ye Xuan was very curious, but the two of them were fighting with all of their strength, and the shockwaves from their battle were spreading further and further.

As supreme realm experts, a simple attack from them could raze a mountain to the ground, let alone an attack with full power.

After seeing these two, Ye Xuan began to rub his hands in anticipation.

!!

After all, the people he had encountered over the past few days had never pushed him to his limit. They were not challenging at all.

However, these were two true blue supreme realm experts!

Thinking this,Yye Xuan walked in their direction without hesitation.

As he gradually approached the area, Ye Xuan spotted a woman in a white dress floating in the air.

She gently waved her palm, and extremely terrifying waves of energy bombarded her opponent, leaving huge craters in their wake.

At this moment, she seemed like an ethereal fairy.

Such a woman was really too beautiful. However, the aura she exuded was cold and aloof. Even from a distance, he could clearly sense.

Even though Zhuge Yueyue was also a very cold person, she paled in comparison to this woman.

After observing the battle between the two experts, he estimated that she was a mid-stage supreme realm expert, or even higher.

At this moment, Ye Xuan searched his memories several times, but he could not recognize who this person was.

“That’s strange. Who is this woman?”

The more Ye Xuan thought about it, the stranger he found it. He moved closer to the top of a giant tree and watched the battle without blinking.

The woman’s opponent was an old man in a white robe. Although he looked extremely thin, every move he made made the surroundings tremble. It seemed that he too was a mid-stage supreme realm expert.

“Who is this old man? I don’t recognize him either.”

Ye Xuan was getting more and more confused. After all, his teacher had already told him about almost all of the supreme realm cultivators in the East continent.

However, among the people his teacher had mentioned, there were no such two people. The two of them also noticed Ye Xuan’s presence at this moment, at which point the woman forced the old man back and looked at Ye Xuan with cold eyes.

As she watched, the woman was also curious, as she could not sense how strong Ye Xuan was. All she could sense was that Ye Xuan was surrounded by terrifying sword intent, which was preventing her spiritual sense from probing his cultivation level.

“Who are you?”

The woman asked coldly.

In this true tomb, only those who had reached the supreme realm could enter. Since he was here, he was definitely a supreme realm expert as well.

Up until now, she had been fighting with this old man, but a winner could not be decided among them. Therefore, Ye Xuan’s appearance here was a variable that could swing the battle either way.

Ye Xuan yawned lazily and said indifferently, “I’m Ye Xuan.”

“Eh? Ye Xuan?”

She was momentarily stunned, but after searching her memories, she realized that she did not know who this person was.

“I’ve never heard of you. Are you a cultivator from the Heaven continent?”

“What? The Heaven continent?”

Ye Xuan was stunned. After all, he had never heard of the Heaven continent.

Wait…

The Heaven continent?

If he remembered correctly, this name was recorded in a sheepskin book he had found in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It was an area outside the East continent.

It was rumored that the mystic world was divided into eight parts, and each part was separated by worldly power.

After a moment of contemplation, Ye Xuan finally recollected what he knew about the Heaven continent.

He waved his hand and replied, “I’m not from the Heaven continent. I belong to the East continent.”

“East continent?”

At this moment, she was also momentarily stunned. After a long while, she said, “There’s actually a supreme realm expert in the East continent?”

In her memory, the East continent was the weakest among the eight continents.

Not only that, fate energy in the East continent, along with the potential of its cultivators, was lacking in comparison to the other seven continents.

In the East continent, those who could cultivate to the supreme realm would be able to do whatever they wanted. However, it was not easy to cultivate to the point where one became a supreme realm expert in the East continent. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this moment, she became very curious about Ye Xuan. In such a barren place, how did this person manage to become a supreme realm expert?

Moreover, he even seemed younger than her!

How much of a genius was he in that case?

The more she thought about it, the more she could not believe it. After all, she was known as a peerless genius in the Heaven continent.

Among the cultivators of the same generation, no one was her match, and even among the older generation.

Ever since she started cultivating, she had never held any cultivator in high regard. She had always felt that they were not worthy of being her competitors.

Although there were many geniuses in the Heaven continent, from her perspective, these geniuses were just ordinary.

After carefully examining Ye Xuan’s sword intent, she came to a conclusion that this expert who had suddenly appeared was also very powerful, and he should not be provoked.

“Haha, so this little brother is from the East continent. Pleased to meet you.”

At this moment, the thin old man also approached Ye Xuan with a smile on his face, clearly trying to get on Ye Xuan’s good side. Both sides knew that Ye Xuan was the key variable in this situation.
