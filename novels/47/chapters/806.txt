807 Dead Or Alive?

From now on, the immortal bones no longer existed on the East continent. They would only appear in the records of history.

Then Daoist Yi Feng fell to the ground…

He hugged the delicate body in his arms and fell into an eternal sleep.

All of the grudges between the two of them had ended with their deaths.

In this battle, two peak-level ancient realm experts had fallen in order to kill a mighty sealed immortal realm expert!

Although the Great Wilderness Divine sect had won, the price they had to pay was too great.

Just as everyone was filled with grief and indignation, the sky suddenly released bursts of dazzling light. Moments later, three Dao Flowers appeared and floated quietly in the sky.

“What exactly is going on?”

Everyone was confused.

“This aura is too scary. Is another expert coming here?”

The crowd started to panic. After experiencing this great battle, the two ancient realm experts of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had both fallen.

If an enemy of that level appeared again, how should they deal with it?

In the midst of the panicked cries, the three Dao Flowers released intense light again. When the light dissipated, a figure slowly condensed in the sky…

“Teacher!”

This person was no stranger to them, and Zhuge Yueyue immediately shouted excitedly. Although tears were still dripping from her eyes, they were now tears of excitement.

Her teacher was still alive and well. He had not left them.

“IHe can still come back to life like this?”

Gao Shun, who was originally still crying, instantly stopped what he was doing incredulously. Although he was happy, he also felt deceived.

That being said, how did he create this miracle?

After experiencing two life-and-death crises, he was still alive and well. Could it be that Ye Xuan also had immortal bones?

“Isn’t this great? Our Martial Uncle is still alive! We’ve won! The Great Wilderness Divine sect has won!”

When they saw Ye Xuan reappear, all of the sect’s disciples on Sky Mountain cheered and shouted.

As disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, they all felt a sense of honor.

Amidst this world-ending disaster, the chances of survival were slim. However, the Great Wilderness Divine sect bravely stood up and withstood all of this, allowing the people to survive.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was still floating in the sky. He brandished his two divine swords.

The power in his body was about to be out of control, so Ye Xuan had to use the full force of his might to keep himself from breaking through. His overwhelming power caused space to fluctuate.

“This… What is Junior Brother Ye doing?”

Looking at this situation, everyone was confused. They did not know what was going on at all, and were all afraid that something would happen again.

Ye Xuan was still standing proudly in the sky, his three Dao Flowers floating above his head, releasing bursts of dazzling light.

At this moment, Ye Xuan could only release the violent spiritual power in his body, injecting it into the ground to restore the flowers and trees that had withered away earlier.

“Could it be that Junior Brother Ye is about to break through?”

Ao Lei suddenly said this, his face full of shock.

“This… He’s about to reach the sealed immortal realm?”

Gao Shun also sensed that something was amiss at this time. His mouth was wide open in surprise, and waves of shock surged through his heart.

If Ye Xuan could successfully break through, he would be able to cast away his mortal body and become a true immortal, an immortal recognized by the laws of the world!

Who would have expected that Ye Xuan would benefit so greatly from the battle, to the extent that he was about to break through?

Everyone was shocked.

How old was Ye Xuan? At such a young age, he was actually going to break through to the sealed immortal realm?

At this moment, a growl was heard as Ye Xuan swung the Godsword at the sky, tearing space apart.

“Oh my god, is he trying to prove and complete his Sword Dao now?”

Within the Heavenly Domain, everyone’s expression changed drastically. None of them could believe what they were seeing.

Ye Xuan’s body trembled and instantly released a majestic righteous aura, causing everyone to become stunned once again.

“This power?”

“Merit power? Could it be that Ye Xuan wanted to prove and complete two Daos?”

“Oh my god, does he have a few screws loose? He’s actually so crazy. Even if he had to risk his life, there was no need to be like this, right?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Those watching from beyond the world barrier who had reached the peak of the ancient realm knew how difficult the task of proving and completing one’s Dao was, yet this insane person was trying to do it with two Daos!

They were all extremely shocked.

Was he not biting off more than he could chew?

“I really don’t know if I should call him smart or stupid. Trying to break through to the sealed immortal realm with two Daos is simply a fool’s dream.

“I’m looking forward to seeing how he fails,” a peak-level ancient realm said coldly as he stared at the scene. He did not believe that Ye Xuan could accomplish such a shocking feat.

At this moment, another rumble sounded, and the last Dao Flower above Ye Xuan’s head began to bloom…
