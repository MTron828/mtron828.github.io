800 Observers From Beyond (Part 1)

The skeleton could no longer suppress the anger in its heart. It roared loudly and instantly used its devouring skill.

In an instant, wild winds blew in all directions, and many people were sucked into the skeleton’s mouth.

“Oh no! Quick, get to safety!”

Sky Mountain descended into chaos. When Ao Lei saw this, he immediately shouted, “Calm down!”

When the situation was under control, Ao Lei shouted again, “Activate the formation!”

In moments, the Great Wilderness Formation condensed and blocked this devouring power.

On Yi Feng’s side, he could not help but frown. He had wanted to lend a hand to Ye Xuan in the fight against Mengyu, but if he did not deal with the skeleton in front of him, the others would be in danger.

“Damn it, you filthy thing! You must have devoured countless living beings!”

“Today, I will send you to the 18th level of hell, never to reincarnate!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Daoist Yi Feng condensed another powerful spiritual palm which even contained the power of reincarnation, which was extremely terrifying.

After the battle had begun, the barriers between the continents began to fluctuate violently. People gathered together to observe carefully.

At the same time, those on the other side were also very puzzled. What was going on on the other side of the barrier?

They could clearly sense that a storm was coming.

Some people were worried, but some people were happy.

“Great Demoness Mengyu, is this all you can do?”

“Back then, you killed so many people of my sect. Today, I will see for myself just how powerful you are.”

Ye Xuan had been waiting for today’s battle for a long time and had made many preparations for it.

With the Godsword in hand, he unleashed the Flora Sword technique. His powerful sword aura wreaked havoc wherever it swept through.

Against such a powerful enemy like Mengyu, Ye Xuan did not hold back at all and used his trump card.

However, Mengyu was no slouch either, and her powerful attacks countered Ye Xuan’s. The entire East continent shook violently as the two fought, and even the strange power was restrained.

Everyone had their eyes on this shocking battle.

“How arrogant!”

Mengyu’s expression was cold as she once again released her killing intent. The anger in her heart was boiling over. She had never been humiliated like this since she regained consciousness.

Even when the Great Wilderness Divine sect mobilized the entire sect’s strength to surround and annihilate her, it had cost the lives of almost all of their members to succeed.

As the only remaining member of the demon race in the East continent, Mengyu would not allow anyone to trample on her pride.

With a casual wave of her hand, a pitch-black sharp sword appeared in her hand, and her aura underwent a drastic transformation

“Divine Sword!”

“This witch actually has a divine sword!”

No one had expected Mengyu to also have a divine sword.

That being said, this could not be called a pure divine sword, but rather a demonic sword because the sword emitted a dense demonic aura.

Ye Xuan felt a little apprehensive. Although her sword was still inferior to his Godsword, the gap in their cultivation levels made up for it.

“This is bad. I’m afraid we’re really done for…”

“Absolutely not. We have to believe in Sword Immortal Ye. He will definitely win.”

“We’ve experienced many desperate situations before, and Sword Immortal Ye has always pulled through for us?”

“Ye Xuan will definitely win!”

After hearing these words, hope surged in the hearts of the people again, and their blood boiled again.

On the other side of the world barrier, more and more people were starting to gather, trying to figure out what was going on in the East continent.

“This is really puzzling. What is going on on the other side? Why are there such terrifying spiritual power fluctuations? Could it be that sealed immortal realm experts are fighting over there?”

Even in their continent, the number of such experts could be counted on one hand. Did the backward East continent really have one, or maybe two?

“Judging from the spiritual fluctuations, this has to be the case, but who are these experts?”

At this moment, a white-haired old man stepped up and appeared in front of the barrier.

The corners of his mouth curled up, and he immediately said, “Make way. Please let me take a good look at who is on the other side…”

After seeing this old man appear, everyone hurriedly took a few steps back.

It was obvious that this old man was a well-regarded expert. The old man took out a bronze mirror that was filled with an ancient aura.

Then, he injected a stream of spiritual power into the bronze mirror and connected it to the barrier. Then the bronze mirror projected what was happening on the other side of the barrier.

“Oh my god!”

People instantly let out shocked voices. From the projection, they could see that two people were engaged in an intense battle. Their strength was unfathomable.

It was obvious that the female expert was definitely a sealed immortal realm expert.
