607 Magic Hammer

After hearing that Ye Xuan was going to plant a tree for them, Zhuge Yueyue said in a trembling voice, “Teacher, you don’t have to worry. we’ll work hard on out cultivation and make your wish come true.”

Feng Xiyun hurriedly said, “We’ll definitely fulfill Teacher’s expectations of us. We’ll also become the pillars of support for Cloud Sky peak in the future!”

Xiang Yun was in a daze and did not understand what they were talking about, but she could clearly sense the melancholic mood.

She pulled on Ye Xuan’s sleeve and asked, “Teacher, why hasn’t your teacher returned to look for you? Could it be that he doesn’t know that you’re still waiting here?”

!!

A child’s thoughts were always naive. She probably had not realized what death was.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan replied, “How should I say this? My teacher is also asleep. He’s also quite lazy and won’t wake up.”

After hearing this, Xiang Yun came to a sudden realization and said, “So that’s how it is. Just like my family and that old man, they’re all asleep.”

“Yes…”

At this moment, the little girl said, “Your teacher is also obsessed with sleeping, and he’s been sleeping for so long. He’s much lazier than that old man.”

After saying this, Xiang Yun suddenly looked at Ye Xuan and asked weakly, “Teacher, will you sleep like this too?”

F*ck!

This disciple of his was really hard to handle.

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded and did not know how to reply.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also laughing out loud. They were quite amused to see their teacher at a loss like this.

Their junior sister was truly special and unique.

“I’m still young, so I won’t need to sleep for a long time,” Ye Xuan said as he wiped the sweat off his forehead.

Zhuge Yueyue smiled and walked over to Xiang Yun’s side. She said patiently, “Junior Sister, in the future, you can’t say such things, okay? It’s impolite. You can’t hope for others to sleep forever, alright?”

“Okay,” Xiang Yun replied and nodded, but she still did not understand why it was impolite.

At this moment, Ye Xuan took out a magic hammer and smashed it into the ground after signaling everyone to step back.

With a loud boom, the entire purple wind chime tree was uprooted, but thanks to Ye Xuan’s spiritual power, the tree did not suffer any damage.

Ye Xuan was thinking of transplanting it to their new residence.

When she saw the magic hammer Ye Xuan had taken out, Xiang Yun’s eyes widened.

She quietly went over to Ye Xuan’s side and asked softly, “Teacher, if you fall asleep in the future, can you give this hammer to me?”

Ye Xuan’s face darkened, not knowing what to say.

The hammer he was holding was of the lowest quality and was not a treasure at all.

When he saw that his disciple liked it so much, he felt very helpless. However, her words were also very venomous, even if they were out of ignorance.

“You know what? I’ll give it to you now. Try and hold it.”

After saying that, Ye Xuan gave the magic hammer to her without hesitation.

Seeing this, she took the hammer excitedly. However, the hammer was too heavy, and she fell to the ground with the hammer in her hand.

She even ate a mouthful of mud, which was a very funny scene.

“Blargh…”

After retching a few times, Xiang Yun stood up in a huff. She grabbed the hammer that was much taller than her and tried to lift it.

Seeing that even Xiang Yun was at a loss, Feng Xiyun could not help but burst out laughing. Even the cold Zhuge Yueyue did the same.

It seemed that the atmosphere at Cloud Sky peak had improved a lot after the appearance of this little girl.

This was a good sign.

After standing up, Xiang Yun first familiarized herself with the weight of the magic hammer before she shouted, “I don’t believe that there’s a hammer that I can’t lift!”

She exerted all of the strength in her body and instantly raised the magic hammer high up and hurled it forward.

It hit a big rock in front of her making a loud bang, and then the rock shattered into smaller pieces.

Ye Xuan was shocked to see this.

It had to be understood that this little girl had not set foot on the path of cultivation.

Even an average cultivator at the peak of the mystic meridian realm would not be able to match Xiang Yun’s strength. If she were to start cultivating, what level would her strength reach?

Ye Xuan’s curiosity was piqued. This little girl was truly astonishingly talented. He had to teach her well.

When she grew up, with her personality, who would dare to provoke her?

If there were really other small characters who came to provoke them, then he would just unleash her upon them. No matter who it was, she would smash them with her hammer.

The image he envisioned looked pretty cool.

On the other side, Xiang Yun’s mouth was wide open in shock when she saw how easily she smashed the huge rock.

“Oh my god, I’m so strong!”

She really did not expect that this ordinary-looking hammer would be so strong.

With this magic hammer, she would be able to beat up whoever she did not like in the future.

Thinking this, her heart burst with joy. She pounced on Ye Xuan and rubbed her face on his leg.

“Teacher. you’re the best. I really like this hammer! Hehehe…”

“From now on, I’ll hammer whoever makes me unhappy!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She was already grinning from ear to ear, and even laughing somewhat evilly…
