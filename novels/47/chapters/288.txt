289 Unfathomable Teacher

“I almost went overboard!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched.

Right now, his physical body was bursting with strength. Even without using the power of his martial intents, he could likely beat up countless pattern condensation realm experts with just punches and kicks.

Now, Ye Xuan only needed to reach out and pinch the air, and a spatial crack would open.

After the spiritual power infusion, Shangguan Wan’er’s strength had also been greatly enhanced. She had gained four to five years’ worth of cultivation.

She felt grateful toward Ye Xuan.

‘Hmm…’

‘Once I can completely awaken the memories of my past life, I can probably repay him in some way, right?’

Shangguan Wan’er thought to herself.

Buzzzzzz!

She suddenly felt the space beside her tremble violently.

An extremely terrifying sense of oppression suddenly appeared. Even she felt a little suffocated by it!

However, in the next second, the terrifying pressure suddenly disappeared.

Shangguan Wan’er knew that this was Ye Xuan’s power, which had leaked out.

Sure enough, her teacher had hidden his strength!

Shangguan Wan’er became even more convinced.

“Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er was finally willing to call Ye Xuan teacher, without any resistance or awkwardness.

“What’s the matter?” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s immense spiritual sense swept out, trying hard to control the sudden increase in power. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A thousand years’ worth of cultivation was too shocking. If he had not halted the spiritual power infusion in time, his body would have exploded.

One had to know that his body had been tempered by the power of thousands of lightning bolts, yet such a strong body could barely withstand this power.

It was enough to show how terrifying the changes would be if Ye Xuan cultivated for a thousand years with his current innate bone value!

If it was just in terms of pure physical strength, he might be able to reach the level of an ordinary king realm cultivator!

Of course, how could a true king realm expert only have physical strength?

“Many thanks, Teacher,” Shangguan Wan’er said sincerely.

“Hahaha! What’s there to be polite about?” Ye Xuan’s eyes froze for a second, and then he smiled.

He had thought that Shangguan Wan’er was going to say something important.

“My precious disciple, in the future, if I am not in secluded cultivation, I will perform spiritual power infusion for you once every month.”

Although this new disciple of his had only acknowledged him as her master for his resources, was he not the same?

What he wanted was to help her awaken her special constitution, and thereby obtain a higher-level one for himself.

“Ah, once a month?”

When Shangguan Wan’er heard this, she looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

Was he really not joking?

Would it not consume a large amount of his cultivation if he were to do so once a month? Just what kind of terrifying level had his cultivation reached? Why would he treat his disciples so well?

“With your current cultivation level, it will be difficult for you to refine the bloodsoul dream spirit flower on your own. I will assist you with this as well. At that time, your sword intent should reach the perfect level as well!

“The Undying Xuan Huang sword physique is lying dormant in your body. You can only activate it if you have perfect-level sword intent,” Ye Xuan said to Shangguan Wan’er.

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes lit up.

Her teacher was too amazing!

He even knew that she had the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique!

This was Shangguan Wan’er’s deepest secret, other than her identity as a reincarnated great empress.

In her previous life, she used a heaven-defying method to forcefully seal the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique. This allowed her to reincarnate safely.

In any case, she had no choice. The Undying Xuan Huang sword physique was too terrifying. Once it was awakened, it was bound to produce a world-changing phenomenon!

If she had awakened it while she was still weak, it would definitely attract unwanted attention.

Of course, Shangguan Wan’er also knew that the condition to awaken her sword constitution was to have comprehend perfect-level sword intent.

However, what surprised Shangguan Wan’er was that Te Xuan also knew about this.

Her teacher was unfathomable!

If she knew that Ye Xuan also knew that she was the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, who knew how she would react?

“I will heed Teacher’s instructions!”

Shangguan Wan’er nodded.

“The Soul Heaven Heart Sutra I taught you earlier is not suitable for your current cultivation level.”

“I’ll pick two suitable spiritual sense tempering techniques for you for the time being.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and pointed his finger at Shangguan Wan’er’s forehead.

Shangguan Wan’er’s comprehension value was higher than Ye Xuan’s, but even so, Ye Xuan did not think that Shangguan Wan’er could cultivate the Soul Heaven Heart Sutra.

After that, Ye Xuan taught Shangguan Wan’er the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique and another spiritual sense tempering technique. At the same time, he also taught her the Lightning Tribulation Void sword technique, the Heaven-splitting Sword Formation, and the Endless Realm technique.

These were more suited to her cultivation level.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were filled with surprise.

Although she had also cultivated a spiritual sense tempering technique, the grade of her technique was far inferior to Ye Xuan’s.

“Mm! I will be in seclusion for some time. If anyone tries to cause trouble for the Qingyun sect during this time, I’ll leave it to you to deal with them!”

“You don’t need to show them any mercy,” he said to Shangguan Wan ‘er, ”

He had no choice in the matter. He had too much power to digest after that round of spiritual power infusion.

Not only did he have to temper his physical strength, but he also had to improve his control of his own power by improving his spiritual sense.
