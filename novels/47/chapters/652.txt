653 Time Domain

Hearing Daoist Gu Hao’s question, Ye Xuan simply said, “Does it matter?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s aura suddenly surged, and sharp sword intent filled the air.

Moments later, countless leaves that exuded sword intent appeared.

“Turning the leaves into swords. How amazing is Ye Xuan’s mastery of the Sword Dao?”

Daoist Canghai looked at Ye Xuan in admiration. It was no wonder people called him a sword immortal.

“Sigh… The new generation will replace the old one. This era is no longer the era of our generation. It belongs to these young experts.”

As more and more sharp leaves appeared, they assembled themselves into a large sword formation.

Seeing this, Daoist Gu Hao’s expression turned even more serious, as he could tell how powerful this sword formation was. This young man seemed to be even stronger than Tian Xuan.

‘Don’t tell me that I’m really going to lose?’

After asking himself that, Daoist Gu Hao steeled himself. He had to uphold the reputation of the Supreme Divine sect!

With this thought in mind, he completely unleashed the strength of a peak-level supreme realm expert, as he constantly performed different hand seals.

Suddenly, it was as if only black and white were left in the world.

“Is that a time domain?”

Unlike the move he had just used, this time domain would not only speed up the flow of time, but it also contained a strong killing intent.

That exchange earlier was only a battle of techniques and had nothing to do with actual combat. However, this was a real fight that tested one’s strength. If one was not careful, they would be seriously injured.

After being trapped in the time domain, Ye Xuan instantly felt the vitality in his body rapidly dissipating.

Trapped in the domain, his every word and action seemed to have been restrained. However, Daoist Gu Hao was not restricted at all. He came and went like the wind carefreely.

“Oh no! Junior Brother Ye’s situation is not good,” Ao Lei spoke up in panic. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After hearing these words, the sect’s cultivators were very surprised.

“That’s not possible, is it? Martial Uncle Ye is so powerful, how could he be so easily defeated by a domain?”

“That is a time domain. If you’re trapped inside, your vitality will dissipate at a terrifying rate!”

“Furthermore, the domain will restrict your movements and actions.”

After hearing this, they began to panic and worry for Ye Xuan.

Yuelun clenched her fists tightly, afraid for his safety. She was well aware of how terrifying a time domain was.

Zhuge Yueyue and the others started to panic. Even Xiang Yun, who had always been carefree, felt worried.

It was rare to meet a teacher who was so good to her, so she hoped that nothing would happen to him.

“First Sister, Second Sister, Teacher should be fine, right?” Xiang Yun asked worriedly.

Even though she did not know what a time domain was, she could sense that Ye Xuan was in deep danger.

At this moment, she suddenly recalled what Ye Xuan had told her back then, and finally seemed to connect the dots regarding the concept of death and eternal sleep.

Her father and that old man would probably never come back.

Now, her only family was her teacher, first sister, and second sister.

In fact, there were other reasons why she tore down the study hall and beat Li Yi up.

After Li Yi found out that she had no parents, he had actually called her a jinx who caused the death of her parents.

She did not tell anyone about this. After returning to Cloud Sky peak, she went back to her house alone and cried for a long time.

At this moment, Feng Xiyun hurriedly consoled her, saying, “Third Sister, you don’t have to worry. Our teacher is so powerful, so what could happen?”

Zhuge Yueyue looked at her junior sister worriedly, feeling a little strange.

It seemed that this little junior sister had changed a lot after the incident of her tearing down the study hall. She seemed a little more apprehensive and secretive.

She behaved like a hooligan in public, but when she returned home, she was as quiet as a mouse.

After thinking for a long time, she still could not come up with an answer to this. Thus, she did not think too deeply about it and focused her attention on the battle in the sky with a nervous expression.

In the sky, after activating his time domain, Daoist Gu Hao felt more confident and became more arrogant.

“Hehe, Ye Xuan, this time domain is the supreme divine power of the Supreme Divine sect. Even your teacher, Tian Xuan, was at a disadvantage against this time domain.”

“Let’s see how you are going to resolve this,” Daoist Gu Hao said loudly.

However, just as he thought he had won, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth slowly curled up.

The flowers and plants once again grew vigorously, and the time domain regained color. The flowers and plants gradually flew into the air, forming a huge flowery sword in the sky.
