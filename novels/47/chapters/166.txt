Chapter 167: Audience Speculations

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Everyone was looking at Ye Xuan with serious expressions.

Even the two fourth-level unity realm experts present could not sense Ye Xuan’s cultivation level.

There were only two possibilities why this was so.

First, Ye Xuan had an extremely powerful secret technique that could conceal his cultivation level.

Second, Ye Xuan’s strength far surpassed theirs.

If it was the first case, it would be considered normal, but if it was the second case…

At the thought of this, the two fourth-grade unity realm experts trembled, and their gazes were filled with fear.

“If this person really reached the unity realm at the age of 20, then his cultivation talent is enough to dominate the entire Nanzhou Region!”

“That’s right! Even the leader of the Divine Gate only reached the unity realm at that age, but this guy already has the strength to instantly kill a second-level unity realm expert!”

“His strength is already unparalleled among the younger generation of the Nanzhou Region!”

“Ye Xuan! Ye Xuan! After the mystic realm closes, this person’s name will definitely spread throughout the Nanzhou Region!”

“That’s right! In my opinion, this young man must be a successor of some ancient holy land!”

Those unity realm cultivators who were on good terms with each other were discussing this matter. Almost all of these unity realm experts had only reached the unity realm at the age of 70, and some even later at 100.

“But this guy killed Li Tianyu publicly. this will definitely anger the Blood Moon Temple!”

“Those guys have always been arrogant. They will definitely take revengeat all costs. If that young man falls into their hands, he will most likely die!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What’s there to worry about? He must be a descendant of a super force. The Blood Moon Temple might not dare to touch him!”

“That’s right! No matter how arrogant those guys from the Blood Moon Temple are, they still have to be wary of those super empires and ancient holy lands.”

“Of course, if this young man really doesn’t have any backing, then he’ll be in trouble! Those old guys from the Blood Moon Temple won’t be bothered with whether he’s a genius or not!”

“Brother, don’t tell me you actually believe that the young man is from the Great Qian Dynasty? How is that possible?”

…

Everyone gave up on trying to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent and started discussing Ye Xuan enthusiastically. They were extremely curious about his identity and background.

No one believed the cultivators from the Great Qian Dynasty. They came up with their own speculations as to Ye Xuan’s origins and affiliation.

However, most of them guessed that Ye Xuan came from an ancient holy land, and that he was traveling the world to train and temper himself. He likely coincidentally encountered the opening of the mystic realm.

Given Ye Xuan’s powerful spiritual sense, he naturally overheard the discussion of the crowd, but he did not care.

Then, Ye Xuan sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to cultivate.

Yue and Huang Ling, who were beside him, did the same.

They were not the slightest bit surprised by Ye Xuan’s performance. Moreover, it would be stranger to them if Ye Xuan could not instantly kill and crush his opponent!

Jiaohei City, Jiangqing City, Qingyun Mountain, and so on. These were the places they had witnessed Ye Xuan display his strength. All of these were resolved in the same manner, which was the instant death of his enemies.

On the contrary, they were more surprised that Ye Xuan had comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent.

This was a supreme intent!

Zhao Yuyan, on the other hand, could not calm down. Instead, she sneaked glances at her teacher from time to time.

Her teacher’s performance just now was too awe-inspiring. He seemed almost-god like when he drew the thousands of lightning bolts to temper his body.

She now totally idolized him.

“Little girl, you can’t let yourself be distracted while cultivating,” Ye Xuan reminded her.

“Yes, Teacher!”

Hearing his words, she felt slightly embarrassed. Then, she quickly became serious and began to cultivate.

Ye Xuan, who had his eyes tightly shut, noticed her efforts, and a smile hung on the corners of his mouth.

These two days had been Zhao Yuyan’s happiest days. No one had cursed or humiliated her. Moreover, with her teacher by her side, she felt a great sense of security.

It was also because of this that Zhao Yuyan finally started acting her age, which made her even more adorable.

“It’s time to stabilize my cultivation,” Ye Xuan said inwardly.

Originally, after refining the Mi Luo flower, the tempering of his spiritual sense allowed him to control 100% of his strength.

However, after infusing spiritual power into Zhao Yuyan, the system’s reward had pushed him into the second level of the unity realm, resulting in his over the power in his dantian decreasing slightly.
