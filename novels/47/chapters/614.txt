615 Amazing Memory?

After remembering the chiliad gold vine seedling, Yuelun said, “Junior Brother Ye, let’s talk about this another day. I still have other things to deal with, so I’ll be leaving first.”

After saying that, Yuelun left in a hurry.

Ye Xuan did not stop her from leaving. He chuckled, wondering how she would react when she sat down and actually processed the contents of their earlier conversation.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan laughed even louder, and his smile became a little perverted. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Teacher, why are you smiling like that?”

Feng Xiyun could not help but ask.

Nothing had happened, so why was Teacher laughing so loudly?

Could it be that something happy had happened?

Ye Xuan rubbed her head and said, “Little girl, don’t ask about these kinds of things, alright? Just focus on your cultivation.”

Hearing these words, Feng Xiyun was very angry. She raised her head and puffed out her chest, “I’m not a little girl!”

“Alright, alright, go back to your rooms and rest for a while. After all, we’ve been out traveling for quite some time.”

“Tomorrow, I’ll start teaching you all again.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan returned to the Cloud Sky Palace.

However, he left the Godsword near the water cloud fruit tree. Its killing intent would deter anyone with ill intentions.

Moreover, Ye Xuan had already subdued the Godsword, so if there were any strange movements around the area, he would sense it immediately.

The next morning, Zhuge Yueyue and the others were already standing in an orderly line in front of the Cloud Sky Palace, waiting for Ye Xuan quietly.

After some time, Ye Xuan finally appeared in front of everyone, yawning.

“Good Morning, Teacher.”

“Alright…”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and then turned his gaze to Xiang Yun.

Zhuge Yueyue had already helped her to clean up yesterday, and she was now wearing a white dress.

She looked like a proper little fairy.

However, this little girl was still as mischievous as ever. She was riding a little unicorn and prancing around with a bright smile on her face.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan did not know what to say, so he could only say, “Yun’er, did you sleep well last night?”

Xiang Yun scratched the back of her head and replied seriously, “Of course, Teacher. I even dreamed of a lot of roasted potatoes last night. I ate so much that my stomach was stuffed!”

Ye Xuan could only smile awkwardly. Did this little girl only think about roasted potatoes all day?

“Yun’er, you’re still young, so you can’t start cultivating yet, so today, I will teach you how to train your own body.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out a sheepskin scroll from his storage space and handed it to Xiang Yun.

“This is Cloud Sky peak’s body refining technique. You can try it out later. If there’s anything you don’t understand, I’ll explain it to you.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun took the scroll and swept her eyes across it in a flash.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue was extremely shocked.

“Heavens, could it be that her talent is so heaven-defying, and she can remember everything after a single glance like me?” Zhuge Yueyue muttered to herself.

Feng Xiyun’s face was also filled with shock, and even Ye Xuan was very pleased to see this. He had only turned around for a moment, yet the little girl had already finished reading the sheepskin scroll.

Xiang Yun sat there obediently and looked at Ye Xuan with a smile, looking forward to the techniques he would teach her later.

Ye Xuan could not help but ask, “Yun’er, could it be that you’ve already memorized all the contents?”

It was looking more and more likely that Xiang Yun was the reincarnation of a sealed immortal realm expert. Her memory was probably unparalleled.

“Third Sister, is it true?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun also chimed in.

Even Zhuge Yueyue would not be able to memorize all of it from a brief glance, and would need to read through it carefully first.

However, after hearing their questions, Xiang Yun was stunned. She asked in a serious tone, “Memorize?”

“I don’t understand the contents inside, but since Teacher gave it to me, I just casually flipped through it.”

Hearing this, the surroundings turned dead silent. Black lines seemed to appear on Ye Xuan’s forehead.

‘Little girl, if you don’t understand, you should’ve said so earlier. I was getting excited for no reason, huh?’

This little girl was indeed extraordinary, but in the most unexpected ways possible.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also sweating at this moment. It appeared that they had been overthinking things.

However, thinking about it closely, it was normal. After all, this little girl was still young…
