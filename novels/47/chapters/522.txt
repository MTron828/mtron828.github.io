523 The Cloud Heaven Sword

Even though Elder Taiyin was releasing an extremely terrifying aura, Ye Xuan was still very calm.

Had it been a few days ago, he might have been a little flustered when dealing with Elder Taiyin, but it was not the case now. As a fellow supreme realm expert, how could he be afraid?

Moreover, Elder Taiyin had only been able to reach the supreme realm with the assistance of the strange power. He had not formed his divine body yet, so how could he compare to Ye Xuan who had done so?

However, Yuelun was still extremely worried after seeing Elder Taiyin’s strange state. She looked at Ye Xuan and warned him, “Junior Brother, you must be careful.”

!!

“It looks like Elder Taiyin has been completely demonized. His consciousness is clearly slipping away. If you can’t beat him, don’t try to show off.”

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan glanced at Yuelun with a smirk on his face.

“Senior Sister, don’t you already know whether I can do it or not? Don’t doubt my capabilities, okay?”

Hearing this, Yuelun’s face instantly turned red.

“Wha…? How can you spout such nonsense in such a situation?”

“Hehe!”

After chuckling, Ye Xuan looked at Yuelun again and reassured her, “Don’t worry, just stay behind me and watch how I deal with this old fart.”

“Don’t get too close, though. Things might get bloody.”

Yuelun glared at Ye Xuan, but still obediently retreated further away.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was looking down at Elder Taiyin from the sky, sizing him up with curiosity.

“It’s only been a few days. How did you end up becoming so ugly?”

Ye Xiu immediately started teasing him, but when Elder Taiyin heard that, he could barely restrain his rage.

Was his current state not caused by Ye Xuan in the first place?

He stared at Ye Xuan with an expression of pure rage and said in a hoarse voice.

“You damn b*stard, since you’re already here, then I’ll make this place your grave!”

“Today, you’ll pay for the humiliation you inflicted on me! I’ll give you a good taste of your own medicine!”

“Hahaha! Oh? Are you daydreaming, old man?”

Ye Xuan did not take Elder Taiyin seriously at all. He unhurriedly raised the Cloud Heaven Sword and pointed it at Elder Taiyin from a distance.

In an instant, an extremely terrifying sword intent spread out. The blood-red sea boiled and giant waves of blood crashed into the shore. Even the ancient tomb itself seemed to rumble.

After sensing Ye Xuan’s sword intent, everyone’s hair stood on end.

“Is… Is that a divine-rank sword?!”

Everyone was shocked. Ye Xuan actually had a divine-rank sword!

After the Cloud Heaven Sword was unsheathed, the black mist in the area suddenly began to violently shrink.

Chu Tianba flew down from the sky. When he noticed the Cloud Heaven Sword in Ye Xuan’s hand, his mouth widened in shock and disbelief.

He even doubted his own eyes for a moment. Did the Great Wilderness Divine sect or Cloud Sky peak possess such a deep foundation? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Even a peak-level supreme realm expert would not take Ye Xuan lightly while wielding this sword!

People were greedy, so after seeing Ye Xuan’s divine-rak sword, many people began to covet it.

However, it was better to hide such covetous thoughts in their hearts. After all, who would be stupid enough to try and snatch a treasure from a supreme realm expert? That was simply madness!

The moment the Cloud Heaven Sword appeared, Elder Taiyin’s smug expression disappeared. What replaced it was a look of panic.

Facing this sword, the strange power in his body almost seemed to tremble.

“This can’t be happening! It’s all an illusion!”

Elder Taiyin’s face was extremely pale. The strange power that he was so proud of was actually afraid of the sword in Ye Xuan’s hand!

At this moment, Ye Xuan casually waved the sword in his hand a few times, and then slowly walked toward Elder Taiyin.

He looked at Elder Taiyin as if the latter was a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

“Old man, weren’t you very arrogant just now? Where did your courage run off to?”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Elder Taiyin could no longer hold back.

“Damn it!”

At this moment, Elder Taiyin understood that he had no way out, and he prepared himself to fight to the death.

“So what if you have a divine-rank sword? I’m still going to kill you!”

Although Elder Taiyin was roaring arrogantly, his eyes were darting about, as if he was planning something else.

Elder Taiyin had completely stopped restraining the strange power, allowing it to wreak havoc in his body.

As this happened, Elder Taiyin’s body began to expand uncontrollably.

It kept on changing shape, until it turned into a monster that had never been seen before, whose entire body was emitting black mist.

Elder Taiyin said through gritted teeth, “Ye Xuan, even if I have to risk my life, I’ll kill you today!”

At this point, the strange power spread out again, and the black mist covered the sky.

Elder Taiyin’s eyes never left the Cloud Heaven Sword, eyeing it covetously. If he could kill Ye Xuan, then the Cloud Heaven Sword would be his, and he would possibly be able to reverse his demonization.

In any case, fighting to the death was his only choice, so he had to go all out.

After realizing that something was wrong, Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows.

“Heh, you already know you don’t have much time left, so you want to drag me down with you? That’s a pretty good idea!”
