918 Wan Tu

“Teacher, are we going to enter now?”

Ye Xuan did not answer Zhuge Yueyue’s question. Instead, he was in a state of deep thought, as was Yanran.

Now that the ancient palace was open, there would definitely be conflicts. The question was whether it was worth fighting for the opportunities within.

Yanran certainly thought it was. Given that both of Ye Xuan’s disciples were talented, they would definitely be able to secure a share of whatever opportunities lay within.

After thinking about it, Yanran took out two jade pendants from her storage space and handed them to Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue.

She said, “You must always wear these two jade pendants at all times. If you encounter any danger, crush them immediately. At that time, I will immediately rush to your side.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were extremely grateful as they accepted the jade pendants that Yanran gave them.

“Don’t worry, Teacher’s wife. We will definitely keep ourselves safe,” Zhuge Yueyue said confidently.

Ye Xuan remained silent as he stared blankly at Yanran and the others, his eyes filled with surprise. It seemed that she was already treating his disciples as her own, which made him feel very gratified.

He truly had picked the right person back then.

“Let’s go, I have full confidence in both of you!”

Yanran said these words with an encouraging expression. After instructing them to pay attention to their safety, she sent them into the ancient palace.

Seeing her do that, Ye Xuan was a little taken aback. Should that not have been his role?

Regardless, he smiled at Yanran and said, “Yanran, I really didn’t expect you to be so concerned about my disciples. I almost thought that you were their teacher instead.”

Yanran rolled her eyes at Ye Xuan and said, “What do you mean by that? Aren’t your disciples my disciples too?”

Ye Xuan was stunned. This was indeed logical!

He pulled Yanran into his arms and said seriously, “You’re right. Not only are my disciples yours, but if you want me, you can have me anytime you want.”

“Interesting, but I don’t want it,” she replied mischievously. She pretended to look disgusted at Ye Xuan.

After seeing the two of them start to behave lovey-dovey again, another shrill scream sounded.

“Ahhh!”

All of Ou Yunhai’s fantasies were shattered at this moment. No matter how he looked at it, Ye Xuan and Yanran were a match made in heaven.

“Haha…”

At this moment, a heroic laughter rang out from afar. A hidden expert was finally willing to show himself.

Following the laughter, everyone immediately turned their gazes, and saw a muscular middle-aged man heading their way while holding a scimitar.

“This… It’s actually the Thousand Continent’s Wan Tu!”

After seeing this person appear, Ou Yunhai narrowed his eyes. He felt unusually nervous. Even Yanran was momentarily stunned as she muttered to herself, “Wan Tu actually came too?”

Hearing Yanran’s words, Ye Xuan glanced at the person.

Wan Tu’s entire body was emitting an extremely dense killing intent, which made him look shockingly oppressive. Furthermore, it was obvious from the blood aura around him that this person’s hands were already stained with countless lives.

The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he asked, “Is this Wan Tu person powerful?”

Yanran turned to look at Ye Xuan and replied seriously, “Yes, he is very powerful.”

If even Yanran was able to say such words, it meant that this fellow was quite strong, which piqued Ye Xuan’s interest.

After all, he could no longer find any worthy opponents here, and it was rare that someone would be able to exchange more than just a few moves with him.

Wan Tu’s appearance caused the expressions of the people from one of the forces to change drastically.

“Wan Tu, you actually have the gall to appear here? Return the lives of my disciples!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a sharp sword instantly shot toward Wan Tu, trying to take his head. Wan Tu’s face was full of disdain as he said, “Old Liu, are you seriously trying to seek revenge on me with your meager strength?”

He gently waved his hand and instantly blocked Liu Feng’s attack, and even knocked him to the ground.

“Elder Liu!”

Seeing their elder injured by Wan Tu, these disciples immediately flew into a rage.

“Damn it! Let’s attack together!”

The battle here had just ended not long ago, and now another one was about to commence. As the fighting started, the East Sea trembled.

“Hey, what is the name of this faction? What kind of grudge do they have with Wan Tu?” Ye Xuan asked, very interested in this matter.

When he saw the disciples of this force all fighting with their lives on the line, he was quite shocked.

Yanran thought for a moment before speaking.

“If I’m not wrong, this force should be from an ancient sect in the Extreme Continent. Its name should be the Seal Divine sect, and their Grand Elder is Daoist Liu Feng.”

“I was told that Wan Tu was also a disciple of the Seal Temple a few years ago. Because he had great potential, he was even treated as a Saint by the Seal Divine sect and was allowed to enter the sect’s mystic realm to cultivate.”

Originally, things were still peaceful. However, it’s not clear what happened to Wan Tu in the mystic realm, but after he left the mystic realm, his personality was completely different.”

“Not only was he temperamental, but he also killed many disciples of the Seal Divine sect and fled.”

“It was at that time that the Seal Divine sect swore that they would kill Wan Tu.”

“However, despite being chased for countless years, Wan Tu is still alive and well. Moreover, he has become even stronger…”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
