363 Ye Xuan, Void Realm?

However, Ye Xuan had always been indifferent and did not give Gao Shun the satisfaction of a reaction.

Now that Zhuge Yueyue had revealed the fact that she had the profound ice divine bone, Gongsun Shouyue was well aware that the battle between Cloud Sky peak and the Hidden Sword peak was about to reignite.

After all, Zhuge Yueyue was Ye Xuan’s only disciple and the chief disciple of Cloud Sky peak.

If nothing went wrong, she would be the chief of Cloud Sky peak in the future. Given her outstanding talent, Gao Shun would most definitely be anxious.

After being suppressed by Tian Xuan for decades, Gao Shun would never allow such a strong person to appear on Cloud Sky peak again.

!!

However, Gongsun Shouyue was happy to see such a situation.

Only through fighting and competition could the sect’s members become stronger.

“Martial Niece, how long has your teacher been in closed-door cultivation? Did he tell you when he would stop cultivating?”

Gongsun Shouyue asked.

He did not come to Cloud Sky peak to check on Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation. He had another purpose.

Zhuge Yueyue said after some hesitation, “Teacher didn’t tell me the exact time. May I know what important matter Sect Master wants to convey to Teacher? If you trust me, I can pass it on for you.”

“Alright! The Great Wilderness Divine sect will be holding the Seven Peaks competition in three months. I would like to ask your teacher if Cloud Sky peak will be participating in the competition.”

Normally, every chief would be allocated seven spots to participate in the competition. However, Cloud Sky peak only had one disciple, which was Zhuge Yueyue.

Still, Cloud Sky peak was one of the seven peaks of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. As the sect master, he still had to ask.

“Seven Peaks competition?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes lit up.

Ye Xuan had already told her about this before she started cultivating, so she quickly replied, “Don’t worry, Sect Master. Teacher specifically told me that Cloud Sky will participate in the competition this time around.”

“That’s good!”

Gongsun Shouyue nodded with a satisfied expression.

He was filled with anticipation. How much would Zhuge Yueyue grow in just three months?

When Gao Shun heard this, he revealed a mocking expression.

“Hehe! Your Teacher didn’t even dare to participate in the last competition. It seems you’re quite confident this time, though.”

“Martial Uncle Gao, don’t worry. In the competition, if I meet any disciples of the Hidden Sword peak, I will show them mercy for Martial Uncle Gao’s sake,” Zhuge Yueyue said indifferently.

When Gao Shun heard that, he immediately flew into a rage.

“Very good, little girl. You’re not even fully grown yet, yet you’ve already learned how to speak so sharply. You really take after your teacher!”

“Although your level of talent is not bad, your teacher is trash. Do you really think you can learn anything by following him?”

Zhuge Yueyue frowned when she heard this.

“Martial Uncle Gao, rather than worry about my teacher, you should just go back and teach your own disciples. If they lose to the disciple of a useless teacher in the Seven Peaks competition three months from now, your reputation will be the one that suffers.”

When Gao Shun heard that, if looks could kill, Zhuge Yueyue would be dead.

“Hmph! Didn’t your teacher teach you how to respect your elders?”

“Your sharp tongue will get you into trouble. Since he’s not here to teach you proper manners, I will do so on his behalf!”

Gao Shun could not suppress the anger in his heart at all and was about to teach Zhuge Yueyue a lesson.

At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly swept out. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Wait a minute, this aura…”

Gongsun Shouyue immediately detected the billowing aura.

“Was there someone else on Cloud Sky peak as well?” Gongsun Shouyue’s eyes were filled with surprise.

Gao Shun was also puzzled by the appearance of this aura.

“Teacher has finally come out of seclusion!”

Unlike the two of them, Zhuge Yueyue’s face was filled with surprise.

Just now, when Gao Shun was about to make a move, Zhuge Yueyue had been shocked. She also did not think that Gao Shun would actually dare to discard his dignity as a chief and attack a junior like her.

“What? You mean that’s Ye Xuan?”

Seeing this, Gongsun Shouyue frowned. The shock in his eyes grew.

How was this possible? Was Ye Xuan not just a second-level divine mystic realm cultivator?

Judging from the strength of that aura, its owner had at least reached the void realm!

Then, a bright light flashed, and a white-robed figure suddenly appeared in the sky.

It really was Ye Xuan, and if his eyes did not deceive him, he had just teleported, right?

Teleportation was clearly a divine power only a void realm cultivator could use!

Compared to Gongsun Shouyue’s shocked expression, Gao Shun’s face turned extremely pale, and his body trembled uncontrollably.

He did not want to believe that Ye Xuan had already reached the void realm. Furthermore, based on the distance his teleportation had covered, it even seemed that he was not far off from the heaven realm.

How was that possible?

There was no way his cultivation advanced by this much within a few days, so the only logical conclusion was that Ye Xuan had been hiding his cultivation level this entire time.

At the thought of this, Gao Shun’s face became incomparably pale.

That had to be it!

If this guy was really a piece of trash with mediocre cultivation talent, then there was no reason for Tian Xuan to take him in as a disciple, and even make him the chief of Cloud Sky peak
