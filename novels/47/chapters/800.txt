801 Observers From Beyond (Part 2)

What shocked them the most was that her opponent was a peak-level ancient realm expert.

How was this person managing to fight her on equal footing?

How heaven-defying was this?

“Whoa! This is unbelievable. An ancient realm expert fighting with a sealed immortal realm expert? This has to be a first!”

“The most shocking thing is that he can actually fight evenly with her!”

Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock, and they even suspected that what they were seeing was fake.

“It’s actually that guy!”

A cultivator said in surprise when he saw Ye Xuan’s figure.

Hearing this, someone immediately asked, “Friend, do you know who this person is?”

The cultivator immediately replied in a strange tone, “I’ve seen this person in the ancient tomb before. His name is Ye Xuan, and he’s from the East continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

Everyone was stunned. Was the Great Wilderness Divine sect not in the Heaven continent? Why was there a Great Wilderness Divine sect in the East continent?

At this moment, people from the other continent were discussing this matter. Many people were puzzled. They did not understand why this person was so powerful.

The cultivator then continued, “I don’t know any more details, as I only heard about what happened further inside the ancient tomb from someone else. That person told me that there was an extremely powerful supreme realm expert from the East continent who challenged the experts from the various continents and finally obtained the immortal heavenly treasures.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Even the Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect, Ou Yunhai, suffered a great loss at his hands.”

“This…”

Hearing this, everyone’s jaws dropped, as they memorized Ye Xuan’s name. Given how dazzling this person’s achievements were, if he survived this battle, his future and potential were limitless.

On the East continent, after Mengyu started to use her sword, the atmosphere had reached its climax.

Ye Xuan could clearly sense that his Godsword was even trembling slightly, as it felt like a hunter seeing its prey.

The Godsword in Ye Xuan’s hand had outstanding battle achievements, and had destroyed many peerless swords in the past.

Unfortunately, it had been damaged during some ancient war, which tarnished its original brilliance.

Now that it had encountered a weapon of the same level, the Godsword seemed to be overjoyed. Even the tip of the sword was trembling slightly, and started to release a tremendous amount of power.

After sensing the powerful sword aura released by Mengyu, Ye Xuan raised his right hand, and a red light shone forth from his forehead.

Suddenly, a terrifying sword aura erupted from the Godsword.

Everyone’s hearts trembled. This sword aura was far more terrifying than anything they had ever felt before.

“What is the name of this move?”

The moment Ye Xuan brandished the Godsword, waves of sorrowful emotions seemed to sweep across the land. Even Mengyu’s emotions were disturbed, causing her to feel a little absent-minded.

Ever since she was born, only when Daoist Yi Feng drew his sword and stabbed her had she felt such sadness. However, Ye Xuan’s sword move caused her to experience those emotions once again.

Why was this move so peculiar?

Ye Xuan lowered his head and pondered for a moment before replying, “”This move is called ‘Wither and Flourish’.”

“When I was concentrating on cultivating in seclusion to comprehend the Sword Dao, I was suddenly inspired, and thus this sword move was born.”

After hearing this, Mengyu’s body trembled and she fell into a daze.

“Wither and Flourish?”

Just hearing this name made her feel as if she had just woken up from a dream. It could be seen from this how deep the Sword Dao insights contained within this move were.

Mengyu had no choice but to acknowledge Ye Xuan’s strength.

“You are indeed very powerful. Since ancient times, you are probably the only cultivator with such great talent in the Sword Dao. If you are allowed to continue growing, perhaps in the near future, you will be able to use the Sword Dao of the Sword to become a sealed immortal realm expert.”

“Unfortunately, it seems that you will have to die here today.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Mengyu’s expression instantly turned cold. She held the demonic sword in her hand and unleashed its fiendish aura.

In the blink of an eye, the entire sky turned gray as she focused its full force on Ye Xuan.

Puchi!

Under the effect of this focused aura, Ye Xuan immediately vomited blood. After all, they were indeed separated by a major cultivation realm.

However, this would not be enough to defeat him. He consumed a pill without hesitation and immediately recovered.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s eyes had also turned abnormally cold. He knew very well how much strength he could unleash.

The Great Demoness in front of him was like a mountain peak, standing in front of Ye Xuan. Whether or not his capabilities would allow him to split apart this mountain would depend on the next sword move.

“Great Demoness Mengyu, have a good look at how powerful my technique is.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s figure instantly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already 10,000 meters in the sky.

This move, Wither and Flourish, was a sword move that Ye Xuan had created when he was in seclusion by combining his Sword Dao insights with the Flora Sword technique.

The entire world turned black and white at this moment. In this monotonous world, a bewitching red flower suddenly emerged, looking extremely strange and terrifying.

Moments later, the entire world shook violently, but the red flower still floated steadily in the sky.

Seeing such a shocking scene, everyone’s faces turned pale. They did not know what words to use to describe it.
