930 A New Subordinate

Ye Xuan saw that the Thunder-Devouring Beast still had no intention of becoming his subordinate, he quickly continued, “If there’s a chance in the future, your big brother will definitely find you a beautiful girl so that you can get together and have a little Thunder-Devouring kid!”

“I agree!”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s condition, it started humming a song and danced around excitedly, completely ignoring the matter of its ancestors’ reputation.

“Hahaha… A beautiful girl… Wait for me! I’m coming to find you!”

It was just short of drooling. After all, this Thunder-Devouring Beast had been very lonely and cold in this sealed ancient palace.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was not really a pervert. It just wanted to continue its lineage and have its own family.

“Big brother! From now on, I’ll be your sidekick!”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was instantly subdued by Ye Xuan. It did not even bat an eyelid. That one condition was more convincing than the entirety of Ye Xuan’s previous spiel.

Ye Xuan was completely taken aback. Had he known how lonely this Thunder-Devouring Beast was, he would not have wasted his breath earlier.

In any case, having succeeded in taking the beast in as his subordinate, Ye Xuan was overjoyed. As for the matter of finding this fellow a wife, he would have to think about it later.

Where was he going to find a female Thunder-Devouring Beast? These creatures only existed in ancient books…

Ye Xuan stared at the Thunder-Devouring Beast and said, “The conditions that I just proposed should have satisfied you. Now it’s your turn to give some conditions to satisfy me.”

“Oh? What do you mean? I’m already your sidekick. Do I still have to give you some conditions?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan said with a serious expression, “Certainly. No matter what, I’m a big shot in this world. Other than me, perhaps no one in this world can protect you.”

“Besides, I’ll be working so hard to ensure your safety and even help you find a wife in my free time. Shouldn’t you do something as well?”

Hearing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast nodded and said, “That’s true.”

After pondering for a moment, for the sake of his future wife, it turned around and took out an immortal-grade treasure, the Sky-shaking Bell.

“Big brother, I obtained this by accident. If I’m not wrong, it’s a pretty good treasure. Consider it my gift to big brother.”

“Big brother, when are you going to find me a wife?”

Seeing this Sky-shaking Bell, Ye Xuan was quite happy.

‘Very good, very good. This little brother of his was quite good at doing things.’

He happily took the treasure from the Thunder-Devouring Beast, albeit looking a little unwilling at the same time.

“Little brother, I’m not coveting your treasure. It’s just that if there’s nothing, it’ll be very difficult for me to do things for you.”

“Haha, don’t worry Big Brother, I know how this works,” the Thunder-Devouring Beast replied slyly, without the demeanor of a divine beast at all.

Seeing how sensible it was, Ye Xuan immediately said, “If you want to pursue a wife, you will need to learn certain skills. Later, your Big Brother will personally demonstrate some to you.”

“If you can learn them, you won’t have to worry about not being able to find a wife in the future.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast nodded with a serious expression. It had already been convinced.

Ye Xuan smiled, and was already thinking about the immortal heavenly treasure that the beast was guarding. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After wetting his throat, Ye Xuan spoke again, “However… Your current situation is indeed quite difficult to resolve.”

Casually tossing the Sky-shaking Bell in his hand, Ye Xuan said, “Just this treasure alone is probably not enough to help you find a wife.”

Ye Xuan’s gaze drifted to the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit behind the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was not stupid. It immediately understood what Ye Xuan wanted.

After thinking about it seriously for a moment, it realized that the immortal heavenly treasure actually would not have much effect on it. At most, it could only strengthen its vitality and increase its cultivation a little. Honestly, it had only been protecting this heavenly treasure all this while because it subconsciously regarded it as a supreme treasure.

Thinking about it, even if it kept this heavenly treasure by its side, it would only end up attracting unwanted attention. In that case, it might as well give it away.

It was also very clear in its heart that if Ye Xuan really wanted to snatch away the immortal heavenly treasure, it would be powerless to stop him.

Besides, it would be getting a wife in return, so it was a great deal.

Thinking this, it took the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit and offered it with both hands, saying with a smile, “Hahaha, Big Brother, you know that many people are after my immortal heavenly treasure. If I keep it around, it will only bring more trouble to myself. Therefore, it’s better for you to have it, Big Brother.”

Ye Xuan was extremely excited when he saw this. This fellow was quite intelligent, and got his hint immediately.

“Haha!”

Ye Xuan smiled and put away the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit. Then, he said with a straight face, “There’s something I have to make clear to you. It’s not that I want to take away your treasure. I’m just taking it so you don’t encounter disaster because of it in the future.”

“Little Brother understands. Big Brother, don’t worry.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was very sensible and said this without hesitation. In any case, it was glad to get rid of this burden. Perhaps it would be able to live a more peaceful life after this. Now, it was looking forward to making a family and creating descendants.

This would make its ancestors happy, right?
