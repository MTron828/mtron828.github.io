“Let’s not pursue this matter any further and leave first. We shouldn’t keep Teacher waiting for too long.”

“Are you really going to give me that many potatoes?”

When she heard that Feng Xiyun was actually going to give her so many potatoes, Xiang Yun was already grinning from ear to ear as she looked at that stinky brat very complacently.

“Hmph! You should be thanking my big sister. If it wasn’t for her, you would have been beaten up by me.”

Seeing Feng Xiyun coaxing Xiang Yun so easily, Zhuge Yueyue was very surprised.

Could it be that this little girl was really that obsessed with potatoes?

“Let’s go back!”

As said this, Xiang Yun sauntered over to Ye Xuan’s side with her senior sisters.

Ye Xuan looked at the little girl and suddenly thought of the old man she was talking about.

Ye Xuan already knew that the old man must have passed away, but the little girl still thought he was just sleeping.

After noticing this problem, Ye Xuan looked at Xiang Yun and said, “Yun’er, take me to where you used to live first. I’ll help you deal with some karmic ties that might be bad for your future cultivation.”

Although Xiang Yun did not know what Ye Xuan meant by this, she still nodded and agreed. She brought Ye Xuan and the others over to a dilapidated temple.

The roof of the temple was leaking, and it barely provided any cover from the rain.

As soon as he entered, Ye Xuan could already smell an indescribable stench. After looking around, he found that the old man’s body was about to rot.

However, Xiang Yun did not know what was going on. She shouted the moment she entered the temple, “Old man, I’m here to see you! Are you still sleeping?”

“Just look at you, so many days have passed, yet you’re still lying down. You’re really a big lazy oaf.”

Seeing that the old man was still lying on the ground, Xiang Yun turned to Ye Xuan and said, “Teacher, this is the place you wanted me to bring you to.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan rubbed the girl’s little head, and then waved his left hand and wrapped the old man’s body with spiritual power.

It had been many days, and the old man’s soul had disappeared without a trace. Even if he was a real god, he would not be able to save him.

Ye Xuan wanted to dig a hole and bury the body so that it could rest in peace.

After wrapping the old man’s body with spiritual power, they went over to a bamboo forest behind the ruined temple. Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun then worked together to dig a hole.

After digging, Ye Xuan slowly lowered the old man’s body down, letting him rest in peace.

After burying it with soil, Ye Xuan even carved a tombstone for the grave.

He looked at Xiang Yun and said, “Little girl, the old man who gave you food will be sleeping here from now on. You have to remember this place. Do you understand?”

“When you grow up to be a big girl and remember what this old man said, come here and see him.”

After hearing this, Xiang Yun was a little confused. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Feng Xiyun gently rubbed her head and consoled her, “Don’t overthink it. From now on, we’re your family.”

Xiang Yun nodded her head when she heard this. However, she lowered her head and felt an indescribable and inexplicable sadness.

Her eyes were full of tears.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was even more sure of his conjecture.

‘She should be the reincarnation of an expert, but who?’

Ye Xuan felt that the disciple he had just accepted would definitely reach the sealed immortal realm in the future.

Although this girl was quite fierce at the moment, the talent and physical strength that she possessed even eclipsed Ye Xuan’s at the same level.

Ye Xuan looked at her carefully again and found that a seal had appeared on her forehead.

“Hu…”

After taking a deep breath, Ye Xuan became even more certain.

He really did not expect that he would stumble upon such a special disciple in a village in the middle of nowhere.

At this moment, Ye Xuan curiously pinched Xiang Yun’s arm and carefully examined it.

‘Her body is truly unique…’

Ye Xuan stared at the girl in disbelief, but moments later, he lowered his head and fell into a state of deep thought.

Moments later, Ye Xuan transferred some spiritual power into the girl’s body to help her cover up the strong aura around her body. It was better to be careful to avoid being noticed by others who might have ill intentions.

After settling these matters, a smile appeared on Ye Xuan’s face. He looked at his three disciples and said, “Alright, let’s go back to Cloud Sky peak.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan flew into the sky and headed toward Cloud Sky peak.

Zhuge Yueyue held Xiang Yun in her arms and pulled Feng Xiyun along as they followed him.

When she saw herself flying in the sky, Xiang Yun became excited.

“Wow! I can actually fly!”

“Woah! That little bird is so close to me!”

While flying, Xiang Yun kept shouting and yelling. She was extremely curious about these things.

Zhuge Yueyue could not help but smile. This little girl was too funny and adorable.

The white crane flying nearby also heard Xiang Yun’s shouts and seemingly replied in an unpleasant tone.

It was as if it was saying, “I’m not a little bird, you’re the little bird!”

“Eh, this little bird actually dares to shout at me?”

After noticing the white crane’s gaze, Xiang Yun felt a little peeved.

She was the overlord of the God-slaying Village, yet she was now being provoked by some random little bird?

...

She immediately raised her head to look at Zhuge Yueyue and said, “Big Sister, go closer. I have to give it a good beating. Let’s see if it still dares to shout at me in the future!”

As she spoke, she clenched her little fist and waved it continuously, as if she would not relent until she beat it up.

Zhuge Yueyue was already sweating. When this little girl returned to Cloud Sky peak, would she not turn the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect upside down?
