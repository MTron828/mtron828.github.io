Gao Tianyu’s body trembled when he heard these words.

He had only wanted to join in the fun, but now had landed himself in hot soup.

“Hehe, that’s fine!”

“Teacher, bring me there and I’ll give Gao Tianyu a good beating.”

All of a sudden, her mood improved, and she was energetic again.

Gao Tianyu looked at Ye Xuan nervously and said, “Martial Uncle Ye, you can’t joke around like this!”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan turned around in shock.

“Eh, Tianyu, you’re actually here too? Sorry, I didn’t see you just now.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Gao Tianyu’s face darkened.

That was obviously a lie. There was no way Ye Xuan had not noticed his presence here.

“Hehe, I’m afraid there’s going to be a good show to watch soon. If this little girl really goes to Hidden Sword peak, she’ll definitely cause a huge ruckus.”

“Hahahaha! I’m sorry, but I just can’t stop laughing.”

“Oh man, I feel sorry for Gao Tianyu. He’s become this little girl’s target! It’s really too tragic.”

“By the way, do you think Gao Tianyu can beat this little girl?”

The people at the scene immediately began to argue and discuss this matter.

“I really can’t be sure. Although Gao Tianyu is a void realm cultivator, this little girl is really amazing. Even if she can’t beat him now, I think it won’t be long before she surpasses him.”

“I think she might even catch up to Senior Brother Hua if she’s given enough time.”

Everyone sighed. Despite the problems she caused, they still admired her talent.

According to her age, she was already so powerful. When she reached their age, how strong would she be?

“Alright, alright, you guys should leave.”

Too many people had come over to watch the show, and Ao Lei wanted this matter over and done with.

After most of the crowd had left, Ao Lei walked over to Ye Xuan with a pensive look on his face.

After examining Xiang Yun, he was surprised.

Ye Xuan had raised the level of her body refining cultivation?

She had reached the materialization realm?

Under normal circumstances, cultivators in the mystic world would not touch body refining cultivation, and simply used it as a basis to develop their talent and solidify their foundations before beginning cultivation.

This would make it easier for them to progress in their path of cultivation later.

At the rate she was growing, perhaps she would be able to grow as strong as Ye Xuan someday.

In any case, that would be a great thing for the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Thinking this, a smile reappeared on Ao Lei’s face. He rubbed Xiang Yun’s head and said, “She’s pretty good. She’s young, but powerful. She’ll definitely become an expert in the future.”

After that, he turned to look at Ye Xuan.

“Junior Brother Ye, you’ve actually caused such a ruckus again.”

“This little girl of yours has only come to the main peak twice, but each time, she’s more fierce than the last…”

“I’ll say this first. Please don’t let her do it again.”

Ao Lei felt extremely helpless.

He really could already envision what would happen if this little girl came here again.

“Senior brother Ao, I’m really sorry about this.”

“This disciple of mine is mischievous by nature and always causes trouble. I’ll take her back to Cloud Sky peak now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan brought Xiang Yun away.

After watching Ye Xuan leave, Ao Lei turned to look at the disciples of the main peak.

“From today on, if Ye Xuan’s little girl comes to the main peak again, report to me immediately. No matter what, you must remain vigilant.”

“Also, don’t let her geet near the meeting hall.”

Ao Lei kept a straight face as he issued a series of instructions, to which they immediately replied.

“Martial Uncle Ao, we understand. We’ll definitely keep a close eye on her.”

After hearing the answer, Ao Lei turned to look at Elder Huang and said after taking a deep breath, “Elder Huang, you don’t have to worry. I’ll send someone over to rebuild the study hall later. You can then continue to teach the students.”

Elder Huang was traumatized.

No matter what kind of treasure Ye Xuan gave him, he would never agree to let Xiang Yun come to the study hall again.

Elsewhere, Ye Xuan had already returned to Cloud Sky peak with Xiang Yun.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun immediately came over and asked, “Teacher, shouldn’t I be the one to fetch Third Sister tonight?”

She had just finished her cultivation and was thinking of going to the main peak to pick up Xiang Yun when she saw Ye Xuan returning with her third sister in tow.
