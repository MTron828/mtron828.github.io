551 Giving Away The Immortal Heavenly Treasure

With the help of the Cloud Heaven Sword, Ye Xuan had become the god of death. No one here could match him, even if they worked together.

At this moment, Ou Yunhai felt fear from the bottom of his heart.

Ever since he was young, he had almost never lost a single battle. However, he had finally tasted failure. It was as if he was a frog who had been sitting in a well and looking at the sky. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ou Yunhai was completely devastated. His originally black and shiny hair had suddenly turned white.

“I’ve lost this battle.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ou Yunhai felt his body go weak and he fell to the ground. He looked up at Ye Xuan helplessly; the fighting spirit in his heart had long disappeared.

It was only now that he finally understood why Yanran had chosen Ye Xuan.

In his despair, Ou Yunhai finally lowered his head.

However, in the next moment, Ou Yunhai shot up into the sky and escaped without any hesitation.

Seeing this, the crowd started cursing his ancestors.

That damn b*stard was the first to suggest joining forces to deal with Ye Xuan, but he was also the first to escape!

However, everyone also understood why he had done so.

“Run!”

No one knew who shouted first, but the attackers instantly scrambled to escape.

They were about to lose their lives, so they could not care less about the immortal heavenly treasure. It was indeed valuable, but they had to be alive to use it!

Looking at the fleeing figures, Ye Xuan did not pursue them. After all, he was not a psychopath murderer.

Once they fled, Ye Xuan smiled and activated his fiery phoenix divine power and went after the immortal heavenly treasure.

At this moment, Yanran had just escaped from her own encirclement. Just as she was about to go after it as well, when she saw that someone had already taken the lead.

When she noticed that it was Ye Xuan, she felt conflicted. She was genuinely happy that he was the one who was going to get it, but also honestly wanted it herself. However, she decided not to fight him for it.

After inwardly sighing, Yanran discarded her desire for the immortal heavenly treasure. After all, she had already obtained a lot of treasures on this trip, so she should be satisfied.

Besides, she had found a particularly special treasure, which was her boyfriend.

Thinking this, Yanran smiled brightly again. Looking up, she observed him intently.

Floating in the sky and holding the Cloud Heaven Sword, Ye Xuan seemed like a peerless sword cultivator. After seeing what had happened to the other cultivators, no one could bring themselves to provoke or offend him.

Even though Ye Xuan had already taken possession of the immortal heavenly treasure, no one dared to make a move. They were not fated with the treasure.

“Let’s leave.”

After a while, most of the onlookers left, as they were also afraid to be caught up in any sudden situations. If anyone made a stupid move, they might be accidentally implicated.

Soon, only Ye Xuan, Yanran, and those who did not provoke ye Xuan, such as Mo Yunhai, were left.

Mo Yunhai stroked his long white beard and said to Ye Xuan with his hands cupped, “Congratulations, Little Brother Ye! You managed to defeat so many opponents single-handedly, and even seize the immortal heavenly treasure!”

“After watching your battle today, I finally understand what a peerless genius is. I’m truly impressed by you.”

Hearing his flattery, Ye Xuan remained calm as he slowly flew over to Yanran’s side.

Looking at the man standing next to her, Yanran’s eyes sparkled. Ye Xuan’s actions just now were too eye-catching.

Her boyfriend was really too strong!

After inadvertently glancing at the immortal heavenly treasure in Ye Xuan’s hand, Yanran still congratulated him with a smile on her face.

“Senior Brother, I really have to congratulate you in advance this time around. With this immortal heavenly treasure, breaking through to the ancient realm should be a piece of cake, right?”

However, at this moment, Ye Xuan looked at Yanran affectionately, glanced at the immortal heavenly treasure in his hand, and said after thinking for a moment, “Little Ran, you should be the one who uses this.”

Hiss!

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, everyone present gasped.

“Did I hear wrong?”

“Ye Xuan is actually giving the immortal heavenly treasure away?”

Mo Yunhai and the others were instantly shocked. They all thought that they were hallucinating.

This was an immortal heavenly treasure!

How had this little fellow given it away without batting an eyelid?

Did he not know how precious it was?

It would allow almost any supreme realm expert to break through to the ancient realm!

Was he willing to give everything up just because she was his girlfriend? There was no need to go this far, right?

The one who was the most touched was Yanran herself. At this moment, she was completely stunned.
