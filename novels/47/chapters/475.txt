476 Shamelessness Is Not Always Bad

At this moment, the cultivators of the Xia family were extremely flustered.

Only Xia Hai managed to keep his cool, answering, “Chief Ye Xuan, our Xia family’s experts have been investigating the area outside the city and the periphery of the archaic divine mountains for a few days, but we failed to find any traces of the heaven devouring divine sparrow.”

“However, we did encounter many ancient beast descendants during this time, all of which were very powerful. Our Xia family paid a heavy price during these battles.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Right now, the flames of war have spread everywhere outside of Qingyang City! All of the major families and top-tier holy lands of the Yangli divine empire have joined the ranks to fight against the ancient beast descendants!”

“We were told that someone did spot the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s tracks north of the mountains. It was chasing a group of thousands of refugees, who have probably all died.”

“After that, it disappeared completely, but it is speculated that it has most likely entered the archaic divine mountains.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan frowned.

He did not think that things would end up becoming so troublesome. If the heaven devouring divine sparrow entered the archaic divine mountains, it would be difficult to track.

After all, the archaic divine mountains were vast and boundless.

As long as he hid in a random place, it was likely that no one would be able to find it.

That being said, Ye Xuan had an inexplicable intuition that it would appear again.

After all, every ancient beast descendant was targeting the heavenly treasure.

As long as the black tortoise carrying the huge coffin appeared, the heaven devouring divine sparrow would definitely be nearby.

After getting the information he wanted, Ye Xuan did not make things difficult for the Xia family.

Although the Xia family had indeed offended Ye Xuan before, they were not a threat to him, so it was fine to show magnanimity.

In any case, Ye Xuan was not someone who would kill people on a whim.

“Let’s go!”

Ye Xuan said to Su Changhe, then turned into a streak of light and headed in the direction of the archaic divine mountains.

Su Changhe looked at Charlot with a smug expression, then quickly followed after Ye Xuan.

Looking at the two of them leaving, Charlot could not help but hammer his fist against the city wall in anger.

“Truly detestable! Didn’t this guy also offend Ye Xuan before? It’s only been a few days since we last met, so how did he end up getting on good terms with him?”

With the Su family riding on Cloud Sky peak’s coattails, the Xia family could only sit and watch helplessly.

Xia Hai, on the other hand, seemed to have thought of something. He first looked at his young master, then at the departing Su Changhe. He sighed deeply.

“Young master… Su Changhe isn’t a peerless genius, but there’s one thing about him that I’m impressed with, which is his shamelessness.”

When everyone heard this, they were dumbfounded.

What the f*ck did he mean by that?

“Uncle Xia, what are you talking about?” Charlot was dumbfounded.

However, in order to find out what was going on, he still calmed down and asked for guidance.

It was rare to see his young master asking for advice so humbly, so Xia Hai could not help but nod in satisfaction.

“Don’t be fooled by Su Changhe’s arrogance. He’s actually very smart! Once he found out that Chief Ye Xuan was not someone he could offend, he immediately admitted his mistake and discarded his dignity.”

“As the saying goes, a man knows when to yield and when to stretch. This is not something to be ashamed of! If doing so can bring endless benefits to one’s family, it will bring honor to the ancestors.”

“I heard that once Su Changhe offended Chief Ye Xuan, he knelt down without hesitation and even set himself up to become a filial son!”

“Perhaps in young master’s eyes, Su Changhe’s behavior is extremely unsightly. However, people like him often achieve unimaginable things!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone came to the same realization.

Charlot’s mouth could not help but Twitch.

‘Good Lord, I didn’t expect to lose to him in this manner.’

‘If I knew this would happen, I would’ve knelt down and sworn to be filial too!’

At the thought of this, Charlot’s expression turned extremely ugly.

However, he had to admit that he could not compare to Su Changhe in terms of character, or at least shamelessness.

“Wait… In that case, does that mean Chief Ye Xuan likes filial children?” Charlot suddenly realized a very important thing.

In fact, he had heard all about Su Changhe’s achievements during this period of time.

It was said that after he returned to the Su family’s residence, he underwent a huge change. He was extremely filial to his parents and elders, and he became more humble with others. He was no longer as arrogant as before.

Since that was the case, why could he not do the same?
