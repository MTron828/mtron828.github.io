778 Monster Gathering (Part 2)

After thinking for a moment, a strange monster spoke, “The current situation in the East continent is very dangerous. The worlds we fought in the past were not like this. Most of them would have collapsed by now.”

“It seems that Sky Mountain is a beacon of hope that is helping them to persevere. Every time it seems like they are reaching their limits, they find new strength to turn the tides of battle.”

Hearing this, one of the strange monsters laughed loudly and said, “So what? What are you trying to say here?”

The strange monster thought for a while before saying, “If we want to reverse the situation, the most important thing is to destroy their hopes!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand casually and instantly destroyed Sky Mountain on the image projection.

“Hehe, we’re going to make them lose all hope by crushing Sky Mountain!”

As soon as this strange monster finished speaking, the eyes of the other strange monsters flashed brightly. Since the South Heavenly King had died in this place, they were all naturally very curious about the expert there.

In fact, these strange monsters did not simply want to kill. Instead, they wanted to expand the influence of the strange power, and thus expand the territory of their master.

However, before that, they had to eliminate those roadblocks that stood in their way. Moreover, a huge battle had just happened not long ago, and many of their kind had suffered injuries, and were recuperating in the strange world.

Therefore, they needed to obtain fresh blood to help them recover faster. This was the main purpose of their invasion of the East continent.

Bang!

A strange monster slammed the table and stood up. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly into an evil arc as he said, “Then, the seven of us should go and experience the strength of that expert together.”

“Perhaps he is qualified to fill the shoes of South Heavenly King.”

Then, another strange monster piped up, smiling.

“Hehe, wouldn’t it be too much for all seven of us to gang up against him?”

“No matter what, as the supreme race, there’s no need for us to bully this little ant with numbers right?”

“South Heavenly King was arrogant, but could not back up his words with strength. Therefore, his defeat was inevitable.”

“If one is strong enough, like me, there’s no need to fear a good fight!”

After hearing this, the other six strange monsters smiled and looked at him. This fellow was similar to South Heavenly King. They were both extremely proud and arrogant, but this fellow believed himself to be more skilled and stronger than South Heavenly King.

However, in the eyes of the other strange monsters, this fellow and the South Heavenly King were basically identical twins.

Moments later, a strange monster snorted and said, “North Heavenly King, if you keep being so arrogant, I’m afraid you will end up like South Heavenly King.”

“Do you really think that South Heavenly King failed because he was too arrogant?”

“Although he is arrogant, he is also very reliable when it comes to accomplishing his mission.”

“Before he makes a move, no matter how weak his opponent is, he will always prepare a trump card to prevent any accidents from happening.”

“This time was no exception. The only difference was that his trump card was not enough to save his life this time.”

“From this, we can see how powerful this expert is.”

“If you don’t believe it, you can go there yourself and take a look.”

After hearing this, the North Heavenly King’s expression turned extremely ugly as he said angrily, “Tsk! Just because South Heavenly King can’t beat someone doesn’t mean I can’t.”

“Since you all think this way, just wait and see. I will bring back this person’s head!”

As soon as he finished speaking, North Heavenly King angrily stomped out and left.

He had always looked down on South Heavenly King, so being compared like that was akin to trampling on his pride. He was furious!

He had to show them that he was not a piece of trash like South Heavenly King!

After seeing him leave angrily, the remaining six strange monsters smiled.

“It seems like we’ve found ourselves a guinea pig to test that expert’s strength,” one of the strange monsters said, and the others quickly nodded in agreement.

Although it was a little black-hearted, this would give them a better chance at victory later, which was the most important thing. It was this fellow’s own fault for being so easy to provoke.

“Then, let’s take a look at what happens.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the leading strange monster instantly mobilized its power, causing the entire place to instantly be filled with black fog, turning it deathly silent.

Then, this group of strange monsters were teleported to the desert region of the East continent, and began to approach Sky Mountain.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was giving Gao Shun some instructions after killing South Heavenly King. At the same time he conveniently strengthened Dong Chuan’s defenses.

Ye Xuan knew that there would probably be even more powerful enemies coming. Therefore, advance preparations had to be made.

“Junior Brother Ye, who exactly is the master that the strange monster mentioned just now?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After settling the matters of Sky Mountain’s defenses, Gao Shun asked the question he had been most worried about.

He had clearly heard the strange monster say before it died that he was not the strongest one…
