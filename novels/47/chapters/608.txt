609 Holy Land For Cultivation (Part 1)

It emitted extremely dense spiritual energy once it appeared, which swept out and covered Cloud Sky peak.

The two of them even felt their cultivation improving as they absorbed it.

“This is what Teacher meant by planting one randomly?”

Feng Xiyun’s mouth was wide open, and Zhuge Yueyue was very surprised as well.

They had underestimated their teacher’s treasury again!

All of a sudden, Zhuge Yueyue felt refreshed. She was surprised to find that her cultivation had improved from the middle stage of the void realm to the peak state of the void realm.

Feng Xiyun also had the same feeling. As long as she went into closed-door cultivation for a while, she would definitely be able to break through.

“Heavens! This is too unimaginable!”

“I only absorbed some spiritual energy, yet my cultivation has already improved by this much?”

Zhuge Yueyue mumbled to herself. Her face was full of shock.

Under the influence of this dense spiritual energy, the entire garden became shrouded in a thick fog, making it seem mysterious.

Furthermore, a day of cultivating in this garden was probably better than normal cultivation elsewhere for ten days!

The water cloud fruit tree was a priceless heavenly treasure. The spiritual energy contained within it even forcibly raised the spiritual energy density in the entire Cloud Sky peak to a higher level, turning it into a holy land for cultivation!

Even Ye Xuan was surprised. He had never expected that this water cloud fruit tree would actually be so powerful.

Ye Xuan then planted the water cloud fruit tree!

At this moment, even more intense spiritual energy fluctuations spread out, which then formed a spiritual energy waterspout in the sky, sucking in all of the spiritual energy nearby.

Cloud Sky peak seemed to have come alive. All kinds of flowers, plants, and trees grew rapidly.

This attracted the attention of everyone in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“What’s happening at Cloud Sky peak?”

“How could such a phenomenon suddenly appear?”

They looked at the huge waterspout in the sky in amazement, and quickly started moving toward Cloud Sky peak.

When Ao Lei sensed the phenomenon, he instantly stood up.

His eyes were fixed on Cloud Sky peak, muttering, “The spiritual energy is so strong. Did someone on Cloud Sky peak break through?”

This strange phenomenon was very similar to when he had broken through to the supreme realm. In fact, it even seemed to be more intense.

On Water Sky peak, Yuelun had just planted the chiliad gold vine seedling that Ye Xuan had given her. Rich spiritual energy fluctuations spread out.

Seeing this, Tuelun was also extremely happy. It was time for her to show off!

While she was still thinking about this, even more astonishing spiritual energy fluctuations suddenly spread out, shocking her.

“Uh … What on earth happened?”

Yuelun looked at Cloud Sky peak in a daze.

Why were they stealing her spotlight?

Li Hanyi and the rest looked at Cloud Sky peak in confusion and shock.

“Teacher, could it be that Martial Uncle Ye is up to something again?”

Upon hearing this, Yuelun pouted and said helplessly, “I’m not sure. Let’s go over and take a look.”

After saying that, Yuelun turned around and looked at her chiliad gold vine sapling, and felt that it was slightly lacking.

Even though this chiliad gold vine seedling was a very rare existence, it had not produced any strange phenomena like the water cloud fruit tree.

If Yuelun had known in advance that Ye Xuan would plant the water cloud fruit tree today, she would have picked another day to plant the chiliad gold vine’s sapling no matter what.

Everyone was rushing toward Cloud Sky peak to join in the fun, and soon, it was filled with people.

After experiencing the spiritual energy released by the water cloud fruit tree from such a close distance, coupled with the appearance of the garden filled with spiritual mist, they felt as if they had arrived in paradise.

“Heavens! Cultivating here is amazing!”

“Unbelievable! It feels like I’m in a sea of spiritual energy.”

“If I could cultivate here, I would be able to advance by leaps and bounds.”

After noticing the changes on Cloud Sky peak, many disciples began to regret not joining Cloud Sky peak in the past when it was weak.

Once the sapling of the water cloud fruit tree was successfully planted, it filled Cloud Sky peak with vitality.

“Eh… Why are there suddenly so many people here?”

Xiang Yun was looking around in a daze.

“First sister, second sister, why are they looking at us like that?”

Xiang Yun asked in confusion when she noticed the yearning in their eyes.

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue also turned around and scanned the crowd. Then, she smiled and replied, “These people are yearning for the water cloud fruit tree that Teacher just planted.”

“So that’s how it is. Is the tree that Teacher just planted very amazing?”

Xiang Yun tilted her head and asked again.
