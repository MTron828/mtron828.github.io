352 Realm Passageway

The Huangyu Zone fell silent.

Whether it was in the spatial turbulence or the outside world, everyone was stunned.

Ye Xuan had not even hesitated.

This guy was too ruthless!

It was obvious that he did not care about the unspoken rules of great emperor realm experts not being allowed to interfere in the war.

“You’ve gone too far!”

“You’ll definitely suffer the wrath of Lord Ancient Black Dragon!”

Many of the sea race Heavenly King realm experts were enraged.

Sure, Ye Xuan was powerful, but they had their own great emperor realm experts too!

“You’re all too noisy!”

Ye Xuan glanced at them indifferently. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, his power drowned them all out.

“This guy is too terrifying. Let’s run!”

“We have to inform Lord Ancient Black Dragon about the situation here!”

The remaining King realm experts fled fearfully.

From their perspective, Ye Xuan had gone crazy and was likely about to start a massacre.

“What a pity! The power in this jade token is a little lacking. It’s all gone after a few attacks,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself as he looked at the fleeing sea race experts.

“My precious disciple, it’s all up to you now.”

Ye Xuan’s phantom figure looked at Shangguan Wan’er and smiled. Then, his phantom figure slowly disappeared.

In the deepest part of the endless sea, a burst of violent energy suddenly erupted, and a huge black dragon appeared.

“Damn it! Who is messing with my plan?”

“Curses! I have to bring it forward!”

The ancient black dragon was extremely anxious. Earlier, the golden divine dragon had summoned him to the dragon race’s main hall to investigate the two auras that had appeared in the Tianyuan continent.

However, even with the combined efforts of many great emperor realm experts, they still failed to find the source of the two auras.

However, at the same time, the golden divine dragon also found out that the ancient black dragon had ordered the sea race to attack the human race’s territory.

Even though the ancient black dragon had come up with a perfect excuse, the golden divine dragon was still a little suspicious.

The ancient black dragon knew that the golden divine dragon would start investigating him soon. If he could not gather enough fate energy in time, the fragment would probably soon change owners.

“Hmph! Damned human! If I didn’t have to prioritize heading to the upper world, I would hunt you down to the ends of the earth!”

The ancient black dragon forcefully suppressed the monstrous rage in his heart.

He was far away in the endless sea, so he did not know who had interfered with his plan, but since the fragment had absorbed a large amount of fate energy, he could barely open the realm passageway.

Moments later, dazzling black light blossomed from the ancient black dragon’s body, and his spiritual sense swept out, controlling every tiny bit of power as best he could.

He had to avoid the detection of the golden divine dragon, who was stronger than he was.

Boom!

After setting up many obstacles, the ancient black dragon took out the fragment carefully, and watched closely as mysterious power started gathering toward it.

His spiritual sense formed a bubble around the fragment.

Mysterious patterns were engraved on the fragment. When the ancient black dragon’s power was infused into it, an ancient aura slowly awakened and condensed into a huge golden dragon.

This was a fate dragon formed from fate energy. The fate energy, channeled through the fragment, would be able to open the realm passageway.

Of course, it was impossible to open the realm passageway just by relying on the fate energy collected from the human race.

However, the ancient black dragon had already secretly plundered a portion of the sea race’s fate energy. Now, all he needed to do was to infuse the sea race’s fate energy into the fragment, and the realm passageway would open.

Incidentally, the act of infusing fate energy into the fragment would cause considerable damage to one’s cultivation foundation.

However, the ancient black dragon was not bothered by this. As long as he could ascend to the upper world, he would be able to quickly surpass the great emperor realm.

Moreover, the golden divine dragon was already on guard against him, especially after finding out that he had ordered the sea race to attack the human race! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As such, this was his only path forward.

As long as he could step into the upper world, everything would be worth it.

“Whoosh!”

As the fate energy of the sea race and the fate energy of the dragon race were infused into it, the mysterious power contained in the fragment surged even more violently. The tough spatial barrier trembled.

This time, even the ancient black dragon could not suppress the commotion caused by the fragment.

Now, the fragment was fully charged and ready to go.

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, the entire Tianyuan continent began to tremble, and the world became dark and colorless.

At this moment, in the deepest part of the spatial turbulence, a light spot suddenly lit up.

At the end of the light, there was a bright door of light that was connected to an unknown place.
