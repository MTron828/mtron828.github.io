408 Han Sikong

Su Changhe’s eyes lit up.

Why did he not think of this earlier? Fortunately, Elder Chen was by his side, otherwise he would have missed this opportunity.

Su Changhe said to Feng Xiyun and the others with a smile, “Fairies, don’t worry. He’s just a rascal. I’ll deal with him!”

“Oh? Since that’s the case, then I’ll have to trouble Young Master Su to deal with him.”

Feng Xiyun did not seem to mind the matter blowing up. There was not the slightest bit of panic on her face.

Su Changhe’s eyes were ice-cold as he stood up and stared at Lin Dong.

“I thought it was some dog barking, but it was Young Master Lin. What’s wrong? Is there something you need from me?”

Upon hearing this, the corners of Lin Dong’s mouth curled into a disdainful smile.

“You’re just a piece of trash, yet you want to act like a hero saving the beauty. If you don’t want to be crippled by me, then hurry up and get lost!”

“Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

“Oh? I’m curious as to how you plan to cripple me.”

“I’ve been in Qingyang City for more than ten years, yet the word ‘fear’ has never existed in my dictionary. Your Lin family may be powerful, but my Su family is not afraid of your family!”

Upon hearing this, Lin Dong’s eyes involuntarily narrowed as he took a deep look at Su Changhe. His heart was filled with doubts. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the past, this guy would immediately hide like a dog when he saw him. When did he suddenly become a tough guy?

However, Lin Dong did not know that Su Changhe was extremely shrewd.

The reason why Su Changhe had previously avoided Lin Dong was because he knew that the Su family’s current strength had been lacking in comparison to the Lin family’s strength.

However, things were different now. He had Ye Xuan’s two disciples behind him, and he also had the behemoth that was the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Most importantly, Su Changhe understoodYye Xuan’s protective nature. If Ye Xuan knew that the Lin family dared to bully his disciples, he would definitely not let the matter rest.

Just as the two of them were confronting each other, Elder Chen used the Su family’s special secret code to pass a message out from the private room.

After all, Su Changhe was the eldest young master of the Su family. How could he be the only guard?

There were many experts following them secretly. Once they had received Elder Chen’s secret signal, they quickly went back to inform Su Tiansheng.

“Hehe, Su Changhe, it’s only been a few days since we last met, but you’ve become quite brave.”

Lin Dong was so furious that he laughed.

No matter what it was that made Su Changhe confident today, he had to vent his anger. At the very least, he could not let the trashy Su Changhe oppress him.

“Oh, is that so? In the future, I will become even more unyielding,” Su Changhe said indifferently.

“Very good! You have completely infuriated me. If I am unable to break your legs today, then I am not Lin Dong.”

He immediately waved his hand and ordered his underlings behind him to charge.

At this moment, a faint voice suddenly rang out from the front of the private room.

“Young Master Lin, are you trying to make a move in my restaurant?”

After that, a middle-aged man dressed in a black robe walked over and looked at Lin Dong with an ice-cold gaze.

The middle-aged man was the owner of Qingyang Restaurant, and a powerful heaven realm expert.

Upon seeing this, Lin Dong’s expression involuntarily changed.

Although he was furious, he could only stop.

The middle-aged man’s name was Han Sikong. It was said that he came from an ancient clan.

Not only that, their clan had businesses spread all over the East continent, and they were extremely powerful.

No matter how powerful the Lin family was, they were only a large family in the Yangli divine empire. How could they compare?

“Lin Dong greets Senior Han. I was in the wrong earlier, I hope that Senior Han will not take it to heart!”

Hearing this, Han Sikong sneered.

“Remember, no matter what conflict you have with others, you cannot cause trouble in my Qingyang Restaurant!”

“Even if your father came here personally, he wouldn’t have the guts to do this!”

“Get lost!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the terrifying spiritual pressure of a heaven realm expert suddenly swept out.

Upon seeing this, Lin Dong’s expression immediately changed as he hurriedly circulated the spiritual power within his body to resist.

However, the spiritual power of a heaven realm expert realm was too terrifying, and it easily forced Lin Dong to lower his head.

Lin Dong’s bone armor emitted a crackling sound, before his legs bent and he directly knelt on the ground, while his entire body was covered in sweat.

After some intimidation, Han Sikong withdrew his spiritual pressure.

As if he had been granted amnesty, Lin Dong looked at Han Sikong with lingering fear, “Thank you, Senior, for showing mercy!”

“Let’s go back!”

Lin Dong dragged his weak body and stood up with great difficulty. With a miserable expression, he led his group of followers and left.

Before he left, Lin Dong’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he looked at Su Changhe, Feng Xiyun and the rest.

Since he was young, when had he ever suffered such grievances?

Today, Han Sikong protected them, but what about the future?

“It seems that there will be a lot of trouble in the future.”

Feng Xiyun’s mouth curved into a beautiful arc.

Beside her, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression was solemn.

“This Lin Dong is nothing much. The most important thing is the family behind him.”

After all, they were in Qingyang City, in which the Lin family was one of the major powers.

Furthermore, Lin Dong seemed to be a cultivator of the Immortal Divine sect.

Although the Great Wilderness Divine sect was not afraid of the Immortal Divine sect, the two had always maintained a friendly relationship.

What would the stance of the two sects be in this conflict?

Su Changhe naturally noticed the worry in Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes and patted his chest with a smile.

“Fairy, don’t worry. Although the Lin family is powerful, our Su family can still fight!”

“If you are really worried, you can stay with our Su family. We will do our best to protect you.”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she looked at Su Changhe in surprise. She was a little confused.

The two sides had just met by chance. Not only did they not have any friendship, but they even had grudges with each other. Why was this guy helping them?

Most importantly, Su Changhe was willing to stake it all against the Lin family.

Han Sikong looked at Su Changhe in surprise.

“Young Master Su really has an extraordinary bearing.”

“For the safety of these young ladies, you actually did not hesitate to go up against the Lin family!”
