368 Spiritual Power Infusion (Part 2)

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue felt a sense of warmth in her heart.

Telling her that she had to uphold the dignity of Cloud Sky peak was probably just an excuse.

After all, what was dignity and glory compared to one’s own strength?

Still, outwardly, she played along.

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded with a serious expression.

“Alright! My precious disciple, let’s begin the spiritual power infusion.”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue sat down cross-legged without any hesitation.

Once she entered a meditative state, Ye Xuan began the spiritual power infusion. This was a process that he was very familiar with.

Ye Xuan’s spiritual power swept out and slowly flowed into Zhuge Yueyue. He first used his spiritual power to examine the width of her meridians, then slowly roused his spiritual power.

“Yueyue, given the width of your meridians, you can only sustain ten years’ worth of cultivation. When I begin, activate the Cloud Sky Treasure Manual and refine the spiritual power.”

“Remember, when I infuse my spiritual power into you, you must not resist.”

“Alright, Teacher!”

Ye Xuan nodded, then gently infused his spiritual power into Zhuge Yueyue’s body.

Feeling the gentle power that suddenly appeared in her body, Zhuge Yueyue trembled slightly. She was a little nervous. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, she remembered Ye Xuan’s instructions and quickly activated the Cloud Sky Treasure Manual to absorb and refine the incoming spiritual power.

Her cultivation level began to rise rapidly, quickly reaching the tenth level of the mystic meridian realm.

“I didn’t expect to break through so quickly!”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were full of shock, and her heart was full of gratitude.

She never imagined that her teacher would actually be willing to waste so many years of cultivation for her.

Zhuge Yueyue did not know that with the awesome system, Ye Xuan would receive a multiplied reward that would make up, and even exceed the amount of spiritual power he infused.

With the system, Ye Xuan would never make a loss.

Bang! Bang!

Suddenly, Zhuge Yueyue felt her dantian tremble violently, and then she heard a cracking sound. Then, from her spiritual sense, she discovered that her meridians now contained a large amount of spiritual power.

First level of the divine mystic realm!

Zhuge Yueyue was excited. It had only been four days since she had entered the sect, yet she had already reached the first level of the divine mystic realm.

She was leaps and bounds ahead of the other survivors who had joined the sect with her.

“Hu!”

After the spiritual power infusion was completed, Ye Xuan retracted his spiritual power and turned to instruct Zhuge Yueyue.

“Don’t get distracted. Use the Cloud Sky Treasure Manual to strengthen your cultivation foundation. Don’t get carried away with the sudden increase in strength.”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Zhuge Yueyue quickly nodded, as she began to consolidate her cultivation foundation.

‘Mm! This little girl is quite obedient.’

Ye Xuan smiled and nodded.

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! Because the host has infused ten years’ worth of cultivation into his disciple, the host has received a 100x randomized critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 1,000 years worth of cultivation!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

The system’s upgrade seemed to have improved his odds of obtaining a good reward multiplier. Although it was still based on Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation speed, it should be enough for him to reach the heaven realm.

Moments later, a vast amount of power suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s body and poured into his limbs and bones. His dantian also underwent a huge transformation.

“Argh! This damn pain!”

Ye Xuan’s face was contorted in pain, and his forehead was covered in sweat.

He forcefully stabilized his mind and circulated the chaos heart technique, slowly channeling this power into his dantian.

Using the power of the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, he slowly refined it, and as he did, his cultivation level soared.

Fifth level of the void realm…

Sixth level…

Seventh level…

Eighth level…

Ninth level of the void realm!
