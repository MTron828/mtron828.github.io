947 Jingu Staff

Uh oh…

His sweetheart had seen him sneaking glances at another woman, so it would be a lie if he said that he did not feel guilty.

After a long time, Yanran asked fiercely, “Isn’t she beautiful?”

“Uh…”

Ye Xuan scratched the back of his head and said, “No, no, my Yanran is still the most beautiful. In my heart, you are the most beautiful woman in the world. No other woman can compare to you.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Yanran did not argue with him, but turned and looked in the direction where the Nine-tailed Sparrow had departed toward.

After a moment, Yanran instantly took out a long rod that was emitting golden light and handed it to Ye Xuan.

“I found this rod on the flood dragon’s corpse. It looks like an immortal-grade spiritual artifact, but I’m not sure what it’s used for.”

Ye Xuan sized up the rust-covered rod and suddenly muttered to himself, “Is this the Jingu Staff?”

“What?”

Yanran was also stunned at this moment. Could it be that Ye Xuan knew what this rod was?

Ye Xuan did not say anything. Instead, he channeled his spiritual power into the rod, scattering the accumulated dust and revealing its true appearance.

In the blink of an eye, dazzling golden light flashed, attracting everyone’s attention.

“What the hell is going on?”

Everyone was very confused at this moment. However, when they sensed the waves of immortal aura released by this rod, their jaws dropped in surprise.

“Oh my god! It’s actually an immortal-grade spiritual artifact!”

“Heavens! Ye Xuan actually got another immortal-grade spiritual artifact?”

Their eyes were filled with envy.

F*ck! Just how lucky was this fellow?

At this moment, Ye Xuan was also very excited, and he kept waving the Jingu Staff around while muttering to himself, “I really did not expect that there would actually be such a unique treasure in this world. This is really interesting…”

After sensing the powerful energy released by the Jingu Staff, Ye Xuan became even more excited. Although it was barely an immortal-grade spiritual artifact currently, this was because it had been sealed for a long time, which weakened it.

However, when with a little work, it would shine again.

While he was excited, Ye Xuan did not forget Yanran’s question and said, “This spiritual artifact is called the Jingu Staff. It is indeed an immortal-grade spiritual artifact, and p can unleash terrifying power.”

“The wielder can change its size and form at will…”

After saying this, Ye Xuan looked around, but in the end put away the Jingu Staff and continued, “I’m not too sure how the flood dragon obtained the Jingu Staff. Perhaps he obtained it from this ancient palace.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Yanran still felt very puzzled and asked, “Can ots size and form really be transformed at will? Isn’t this too strange?”

“It is indeed true. After all, this is an ancient spiritual artifact. In the hands of a skilled staff user, it will be able to unleash its true potential.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s strange words, Yanran became very curious. She immediately stretched out her hand and said, “I don’t believe it. Give it to me so I can take a proper look at it.”

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up into a wicked smile.

“Cough cough, Yanran, this Jingu Staff is not that great. I have an even better staff. Do you want to take a look?”

After hearing this, Yanran’s eyes instantly flashed. She asked with great interest, “You have an even more unique one?”

“That’s for sure,” Ye Xuan replied seriously.

Hearing this, Yanran became even more curious. Clearly, she did not understand the hidden meaning behind Ye Xuan’s words. After all, her senior sister had never taught her these things.

At this moment, Yanran’s mind had already started to run wild as she pictured Ye Xuan holding a gigantic iron staff in his hand and then smashing everything in his path…

Oh my god…

How domineering!

She really wanted to see it now. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Is this also the kind that can change its size and form at will?” Yanran immediately asked.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan almost burst out laughing.

Suddenly, he felt a little guilty as he looked at his pure girlfriend. Was it wrong to mess with her like this? Her love for him was pure and flawless, after all.

Looking at Yanran’s interested expression, Ye Xuan simply smiled. Then, he said, “Ahem, actually, that’s not the main point.”

“In any case, this treasure of mine is really very unique. In the future, I will definitely let you take a look at it, but now is not the time.”

Yanran still did not understand what he meant and muttered to herself, “Is there really such a strange item in this world that can actually change its size and form at will?”

“How perplexing…”

She once again raised her head and extended her hand without hesitation.

“Hurry up and take it out. I can’t wait any longer. I immediately want to see how strange this thing is.”

At this moment, Ye Xuan was already shame-faced. After all, that thing was not something that could be taken out publicly…
