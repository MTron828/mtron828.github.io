349 A Mere Saint King Realm Cultivator Dares To Touch My Disciple?

However, the master of the Divine Gate Holy Land was being held back by another sea race Saint King realm expert, and he could not spare any effort to rescue Shangguan Wan’er.

The Saint King realm expert who had just attacked was the one t who had been hiding in the depths of the spatial turbulence, waiting to deal with Ye Xuan.

However, Ye Xuan did not show up. Instead, Shangguan Wan’er had come.

Seeing that Shangguan Wan’ers strength might tip the scales of battle below the King realm, and her boundless potential, he decided to make a move.

“Do you think she’ll be able to survive once I take action?”

A cold smile appeared on the Saint King realm expert’s face as terrifying power radiated from his body.

Although Ye Xuan did not appear, killing his disciple was not a bad result either.

This Saint King realm expert was a brawny man, and every inch of his skin was filled with ghostly power. There were even strange lines on his forehead.

He was a demonic whale expert, but he was currently fighting in human form.

He stretched out his hands and clapped. Two huge palms that covered the sky closed in on Shangguan Wan’er.

Locked on by the Saint King realm expert’s spiritual sense, Shangguan Wan’er would not be able to escape.

However, in the face of such terrifying and monstrous divine might, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression was calm, and she did not panic at all.

“Teacher,” she muttered as a jade token appeared in her hand, which she then crushed.

Boom!

Moments later, a terrifying power that made the world tremble suddenly erupted. A terrifying phantom figure suddenly appeared behind Shangguan Wan’er.

The phantom figure had its hands behind its back and was looking at the Saint King realm expert with an indifferent expression.

Then, it reached out its hand and flicked the empty air in front of it gently, shattering the attack.

“Ye Xuan!”

When the Saint King realm expert saw this, his eyes were filled with shock.

This was a phantom condensed by Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense.

“A mere Saint King realm cultivator dares to attack my disciple?”

Ye Xuan’s phantom figure indifferently looked at the brawny man, and a strange light flashed across his eyes.

Moments later, the brawny Saint King realm expert spat out a mouthful of blood as if he had been struck by lightning. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“How is this possible? How can you be so powerful?”

The Saint King realm expert’s eyes were filled with shock.

He knew that the phantom figure only contained a portion of Ye Xuan’s power.

This meant that the other party’s strength had exceeded the Saint King realm!

Was this guy not supposed to be a Heavenly King realm cultivator?

He had clearly reached the great emperor realm!

Great emperor realm! This was the absolute pinnacle of the Tianyuan continent!

Every great emperor realm expert was an old monster that had lived for hundreds of thousands of years!

However, Ye Xuan’s name had only started popping up in recent years. It was as if he had appeared out of thin air.

From their investigation, this guy was also only in his twenties.

Just who was this guy!

At that moment, Ye Xuan’s phantom figure pointed his finger, and an invisible force suddenly imprisoned the Saint King realm expert.

Seeing this, the Saint King realm expert erupted with a tremendous amount of power.

However, no matter how he struggled, he could not break free.

“Impossible! Why can’t I break free?”

The Saint King realm expert’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Although the great emperor realm was powerful, this was only a phantom figure. It should not be able to exert this much power!

Wait!

Was this the fusion of spatial and strength intent?

His body trembled.

At this moment, he finally understood why Ye Xuan could easily imprison him.

As an old monster who had lived for hundreds of thousands of years, he naturally had a lot of time to comprehend supreme intents, but he had only comprehended first level spatial and strength intents.

However, that was his limit. After failing to make any headway into these supreme intents, he focused his efforts on other martial intents, as it would be more productive.

After all, supreme intents had extremely strict requirements on a cultivator’s comprehension ability.

Even non-supreme intents, when comprehended to a high level, would also be able to release a tremendous amount of power, especially when engraved as a profound pattern.

Even those in the lightning tribulation realm were constantly comprehending the power of the laws of the world. Only by passing the tribulations could one become a King realm expert.
