726 Meeting (Part 2)

“Hehe, alright, alright. In that case, it won’t be long before an ancient realm expert appears in our Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

Thank you readers!

Then, he turned his gaze to Li Hanyi and asked, “Could it be that your teacher has also gone into seclusion to cultivate?”

“Yes, Martial Uncle Ao,” Li Hanyi replied, “She has been in seclusion since she came back from the gathering. It shouldn’t be long before she breaks through.”

Hearing this, Olay was overjoyed. Good news came in pairs today!

“In that case, our Great Wilderness Divine sect will have another supreme realm cultivator.”

“Alright, since your teachers are not around, you can take their seats for now.”

After saying this, Ao Lei pointed out the seats to them, and they took their places.

That seat was still fresh in Zhuge Yueyue’s memory, as she had seen it on the day she joined Cloud Sky peak. It was the day that her fate had changed.

Zhuge Yueyue had never expected that she would one day sit on her teacher’s chair. When she reached her seat, she looked at the chair with delight, and even a little mischievousness.

Should she play a prank on her teacher?

When the meeting ended, should she secretly place a few thorns on this chair to prick his butt?

After thinking for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue threw the idea to the back of her mind.

How could she do such a thing? Her teacher was always so good to her.

After the arrival of Zhuge Yueyue and Li Hanyi, the chiefs of the other peaks soon arrived.

Gao Shun was the final to arrive. When he sat down, he immediately asked, “Second Brother, why did you call us here in such a hurry?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The chiefs of the other peaks were also puzzled.

Ever since the gathering concluded, they had been busying themselves happily in preparation for the upcoming disciple recruitment.

Also, in recent days, there were many families and forces who constantly sent them gifts, wanting to befriend them, which made them even happier.

From this, it could be seen that the results of the gathering had benefited the Great Wilderness Divine sect greatly.

Seeing their smiles, Ao Lei first waved his hand down to calm them down.

However, since things were getting more and more serious, he had to tell them about it.

He stood up and said, “Everyone, calm down first.”

“Since I’ve called all of you here today, there must be something important to discuss. This matter will even affect the future of our Great Wilderness Divine sect, so we can’t afford to be careless.”

After hearing these words, everyone gradually fell silent. The atmosphere turned serious, as they knew that Ao Lei would not joke about things related to the sect’s future.

“Senior Brother Ao, don’t keep us hanging. Hurry up and tell us.”

“That’s right. Senior Brother Ao, what’s the matter? Could it be related to that strange power from before?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Li Hanyi were even more nervous now, as they realized something important was going on. What should they do? This was beyond their scope of knowledge.

At this moment, Ao Lei immediately said, “Everyone, simmer down and listen to me.”

Hearing this, the main hall fell silent once again. Seconds later, Ao Lei waved his hand, signaling a disciple to come over.

After this disciple arrived in front of the chiefs, he said with a face full of trepidation,”Greetings, martial uncles and martial sisters. A few days ago, I went out to travel with a few junior brothers and coincidentally heard that some disasters had happened in a desert region.”

“This piqued our interest, so the few of us traveled together and entered this desert region to investigate what exactly happened.”

“I wouldn’t have known if I hadn’t checked, but I was shocked to discover that this desert region had turned into a sea of monsters. All kinds of ferocious beasts were constantly massacring humans as well as each other. Even some ancient beats have appeared.”

“After discovering this situation, we were all frightened and fled immediately. We didn’t dare to stop at all. However, when we returned the way we came, the other two were surrounded by ferocious beasts. They protected me, which allowed me to escape. The two of them were both buried in the mouths of the beasts…”

After saying this, the disciple’s expression became distraught.

Had they not protected him, the other two disciples would definitely have been able to escape safely.

Over the past few days, he had been having nightmares almost every night. He felt very guilty and looked a lot more tired.
