379 Flora Sword Technique

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this scene, she became intoxicated and completely immersed in the profundity of Ye Xuan’s sword technique.

However, Zhuge Yueyue did not know that while she was observing the sword technique, the profound ice divine bone in her body was emitting a sky-blue light that flickered. Unknowingly, her comprehension of the sword technique was getting deeper and deeper.

All of a sudden, the simple bamboo stick suddenly blossomed with a bright light, and the world was filled with a sharp killing intent.

Ye Xuan took a step forward and suddenly swung the bamboo stick.

A burst of dazzling sword qi burst forth, and a crack visible to the naked eye suddenly appeared on the extremely hard mountain surface.

“What?”

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, her expression changed drastically.

She had never thought that this seemingly gentle sword technique actually contained such a fierce move.

After some time, Ye Xuan finished demonstrating the Cloud Sky sword technique. He stood on a bamboo leaf, light as a feather, with the bamboo stick in his hand behind his back.

In addition to his white clothes and handsome appearance, he looked like a true sword immortal!

“My precious disciple, did you manage to clearly see the sword technique I demonstrated?” Ye Xuan asked.

In fact, he was not familiar with the Cloud Sky sword technique at all. However, in order to better guide his disciple, he had done some last-minute practice a few days ago.

Thankfully, with the support of the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, Ye Xuan’s speed of comprehension had reached an extremely terrifying level, which allowed him to grasp the core aspects of the Cloud Sky sword technique within a few days.

However, he was unsure whether Zhuge Yueyue would be able to comprehend it from a simple demonstration. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He hoped that his efforts had not been in vain.

However, to Ye Xuan’s surprise, Zhuge Yueyue smiled.

“Teacher, please rest assured. Although Teacher has only performed it once, I have already memorized it!”

“Oh?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but raise an eyebrow.

“You really memorized all those moves?”

Could it be that he had picked up a treasure, and this girl had an eidetic memory?

“This is not difficult! Not to mention the sword technique that Teacher displayed, even if it’s a scripture as thick as a fist, I only need to read it once to remember it!”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue revealed a rare smug expression.

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

Not bad, this girl actually had such an awesome ability. In his previous world, this girl would have been the nemesis of all entrance exam question setters.

“Very good! I’m very satisfied. This is the sword manual for the Cloud Sky sword technique. You can practice and cultivate it for the time being. If you encounter any bottlenecks, you can come and seek me out at any time.”

Ye Xuan smiled with relief and continued, “Although you have an excellent memory, the most important thing in practicing sword techniques is the comprehension ability of the cultivator.”

“There are many profound sword techniques in the world, but no matter how different they are, there is only one end goal, which is to comprehend the legendary sword intent!”

“Only when the cultivator comprehends sword intent can the cultivator fully unleash the power of the sword technique!”

“However, the difficulty of comprehending sword intent is extremely high. Even among thousands of geniuses, there might not be one person who can comprehend it!”

“Most people spend their entire lives being stuck at the threshold of sword intent!”

When Ye Xuan was on the Tianyuan continent, he already had perfect-level sword intent. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy of lower and middle planes was completely different.

Cultivators who ascended from lower planes would have their physical bodies reconstructed when they passed through the realm passageway. Their physical bodies would then be able to adapt to the spiritual energy of the middle plane.

This would prevent cultivation difficulties due to the differing spiritual energy of the two planes.

However, it was also because of this that the sword intent that Ye Xuan had comprehended on the Tianyuan continent could not be called the sword intent of the mystic world.

Moreover, when he had forcefully passed through the realm passageway, his own power had long been melted. If he wanted to comprehend sword intent now, he had to do so step by step.

Beside him, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression was very serious. Especially when she heard Ye Xuan mention sword intent, her eyes could not help but light up.

She had made up her mind to comprehend sword intent in the future.

“Don’t worry, Teacher. I’ll work hard to cultivate and comprehend sword intent as soon as possible!”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded in satisfaction.

“That being said, the Seven Peaks competition will be starting soon. You should focus on practicing your sword technique and increasing your cultivation level. Don’t waste a single precious moment.”

“Yes, Teacher,” Zhuge Yueyue nodded happily and left with the Cloud Sky sword technique manual.

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Cloud Sky sword technique, the host has received a randomized 10,000x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a divine-rank sword technique, Flora sword technique!”

“Flora sword technique?”

Ye Xuan quickly comprehended the sword technique that surged into his mind.

“Although the stars are vast, flowers and plants can cover the world!”

“A flower or a blade of grass can destroy the river of time and cut down all of the stars in the sky!”

“What a domineering sword technique!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

The patterns of the Flora sword technique contained terrifying killing intent.

Strangely enough, there were not many moves in the Flora sword technique, just three moves!

However, every single one of them had earth-shaking power!

Every move contained terrifying killing intent and sharp sword qi, which made Ye Xuan’s heart tremble.

In fact, it was quite similar to the Overlord Sword body that Ye Xuan had obtained on the Tianyuan continent!

Especially the last strike, where every flower and every blade of grass could cut down the stars in the sky.

The power of that one sword strike could ignore space and time. The gap between heaven and earth no longer existed!

In other words, this Flora sword technique could be called Ye Xuan’s strongest trump card.
