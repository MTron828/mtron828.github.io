668 Identity Exposed (Part 2)

At this moment, everyone present was very nervous, and watched Ye Xuan closely.

Even Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun felt a sense of lingering fear.

“Ye Xuan, what do you mean by this?”

Seeing Ye Xuan draw his sword, Daoist Gu Hao was frightened.

After all, he had already been defeated by Ye Xuan and knew that he stood no chance against the latter.

Ye Xuan replied calmly, “I really have to thank you for your timely reminder.”

“After all, my disciple is the reincarnation of a mighty figure, so it’s best not to let anyone know about this matter. If she encounters people who have ulterior motives, then she will be in danger…”

After saying this, the sword intent he was releasing instantly became even colder. It was as if even the air had frozen, and everyone present involuntarily held their breaths.

In the blink of an eye, many flowers and plants danced in the sky, forming a huge formation. Everyone within the radius of the formation felt life-threatening danger.

After that, Ye Xuan calmly placed the Cloud Heaven Sword in front of him and took out his Godsword.

F*ck!

There was another sword! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Once the Godsword was unsheathed, a terrifying amount of killing intent swept out, nearly bringing some cultivators to their knees.

Ye Xuan then continued. “This little disciple I took in is usually very playful and mischievous. She likes to run around and get herself into trouble, so I won’t have the chance to protect her at all times. ”

“Since you all already know that she’s the reincarnation of a powerful expert, I can only apologize to you. After all, only the dead can keep secrets.”

After hearing these words, everyone present turned pale, and some people even started to flee. Others simply stood frozen in place from fear.

No one here was capable of withstanding Ye Xuan’s attacks.

At this moment, a door appeared in the sky, and a destructive aura swept out. It seemed like Ye Xuan was serious this time…

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao was even more frightened. He wanted to slap himself a few times.

He had only said those words casually, but he had successfully provoked Ye Xuan. He should have realized how important this little girl was to Ye Xuan.

Was he going to kill everyone here to keep his disciple’s secret safe?

Daoist Gu Hao was truly afraid from the bottom of his heart, and quickly said, “Ye Xuan, don’t be angry. I don’t have any intention of targeting your disciple. Please don’t misunderstand.”

“Is that so? Did I really misunderstand your words?”

Ye Xuan spoke coldly and focused his killing intent directly on Daoist Gu Hao, scaring him so much that his legs could not stop trembling.

“I-I… just wanted to give you… It’s just a friendly reminder.”

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao really did not know what to say. He quickly glanced at Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun, and gestured for them to help him out. After all, they too were at risk if Ye Xuan really decided to act.

Would Ye Xuan kill them?

They really could not be sure because Ye Xuan never seemed to play by the rules. If he really wanted to do it, such a thing was within his capabilities.

“Don’t worry, Little Brother Ye, Daoist Gu Hao was just flapping his mouth. No one here would be able to do anything to your disciple anyway.”

Daoist Canghai could not take the risk. He would not be able to stop Ye Xuan if he really started killing everyone.

At this moment, everyone present hated Daoist Gu Hao to the bone.

‘Why did you say such words? If you want to die, don’t drag us along with you!’

‘We are just bystanders, yet you implicated us with your words. Are you trying to get us all killed?’

What a bloody b*stard!

When he heard that Daoist Canghai’s words, Ye Xuan retracted part of his sword intent, allowing everyone to breathe a sigh of relief.

His original goal in doing this was to intimidate, rather than kill. After all, it was only a matter of time until Xiang Yun’s special identity became publicly known.

Killing these people would only delay the inevitable, and would do more harm than good, especially if the massacre was discovered.

Therefore, the best course of action was to embed seeds of terror into these people’s hearts, which would prevent them from having any evil thoughts about harming Xiang Yun.

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan spoke with an indifferent expression, but his eyes were still fixed on Daoist Gu Hao.

Hearing this, Daoist Canghai hurriedly said, “Let’s not be rash. Although this little girl is the reincarnation of a mighty figure, the power of karma within her body is also very strong. There’s no way to bypass that power of karma to hurt her.”
