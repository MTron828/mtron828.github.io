692 Could It Really Happen?

After seeing that the door to the next stage had opened, Xiang Yun happily stepped inside. She could not wait to see her first sister again!

In the blink of an eye, she reached the summit, where there were already three people waiting there quietly. The peak of the mountain was flat, and had been engraved with a Yin-Yang diagram. At the center of the diagram was the word Dao.

After sensing Xiang Yun’s arrival, Zhuge Yueyue, Mu Beichen, and the Reincarnation Fairy all looked over.

“Eh” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

!!

“It’s actually this little girl.”

Seeing Xiang Yun skipping over, Mu Beichen was very surprised.

Then, a bad feeling suddenly arose within his heart.

What was going on?

Why was his gut instinct telling him that she would emerge victorious in the end?

Could such a thing really be possible?

If that was the case, then this year’s gathering would truly be unprecedented, and rather embarrassing.

Would all of the geniuses of the East continent be defeated by this little girl?

When he turned to look at the Reincarnation Fairy, he noticed that her expression was also complicated.

Initially, the Reincarnation Fairy was only worried about Mu Beichen and Zhuge Yueyue, as they were undoubtedly her strongest rivals.

However, this unpredictable little girl had now been added to the mix. Honestly, the fact that Xiang Yun had even made it all the way up here was practically a miracle.

However, those who had seen her fight were convinced of her combat strength. When she was angry, nothing could stop that hammer.

In the distance, when Xiang Yun reached the summit, she immediately spotted Zhuge Yueyue and made her way over.

“First Sister!”

After calling her name, she threw herself into Zhuge Yueyue’s arms. Zhuge Yueyue rubbed her little head affectionately and motioned for her to sit down beside her.

Even she was surprised to see her here, especially so soon, as that meant that she had defeated her opponent easily.

In that case, what her teacher said was true. This little junior sister of hers really had unlimited potential.

If she were to stimulate the hidden power in her body, perhaps all the geniuses present would not be able to compare to her. If that happened, this little girl would end up becoming the final victor.

Thinking this, Zhuge Yueyue recalled what her teacher had told her and Xiyun not long ago.

‘Teacher mentioned to us that there is an extremely terrifying power hidden in her body. When her mood fluctuates greatly, this power will automatically be triggered.’

‘If the battle later descends into chaos and I find myself on the losing end, perhaps I should put on a show for Third Sister’

If she was driven into a dead end, this would be her final resort.

The pure and innocent Xiang Yun had no idea that her first sister was planning to emulate her second sister and exploit the power hidden within her body.

Zhuge Yueyue gently rubbed Xiang Yun’s head and said, “Third Sister, have a seat. Let’s rest for a while and recover our expended strength to prepare for the upcoming battle.”

“Thank you, First Sister. I’ll do just that.”

After saying that, Xiang Yun copied her first sister’s meditative form and rested.

After some time passed, spatial fluctuations emerged once again.

“Who is the fifth person?”

Then, a handsome figure appeared. Who else could it be other than Hua Rufeng?

“Not bad!”

Outside the ancient realm, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were rejoicing.

Three of their geniuses had reached the summit!

“Hehe, this time, our reputation will really spread far and wide,” Gao Shun said these words very happily. Today was probably one of the sect’s most historical moments.

Li Dahai chimed in at this point.

“Haha, Senior Brother Ao, do you think we should prepare for a larger recruitment ceremony next year?”

“Definitely!”

“It seems that there will be no shortage of peerless geniuses joining us soon. There should be one for every peak, right?”

Ao Lei was also smiling happily as he stroked his long white beard.

“We do need to make some preparations. Junior Brother Gao, when we return to the sect later, you will be in charge of publicizing our recruitment.”

“Let it be known that our Great Wilderness Divine sect will be recruiting disciples in spring next year. At that time, we hope that a vast number of young geniuses can come and participate.”

Hearing this, Gao Shun immediately replied, “Alright, don’t worry, Senior Brother Ao, I’ll definitely make the appropriate arrangements.”

Ye Xuan was not very interested in this matter, so he did not join in their conversation. In any case, he was just following the guidance of fate when he recruited disciples.
