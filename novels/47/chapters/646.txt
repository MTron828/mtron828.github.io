647 Sword Immortal?

“:That’s good. Daoist Canghai, you came well prepared this time. You’ve actually cultivated such a talented young man,” Daoist Xu Yun said with a smile.

Daoist Canghai returned the smile and asked, “Do you know if the Great Wilderness Divine sect has cultivated any peerless geniuseses in this period of time?”

After hearing this sentence, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Many people began to whisper to each other.

“Daoist Canghai was defeated by Chief Tian Xuan, but now that he’s dead, is he trying to get back at his disciple?”

“It’s hard to say, but after hearing what he said, it’s quite possible.”

“Mu Beichen can be considered an amazing talent, and his combat strength is indeed amazing, however, in the past few years, it seems that the Great Wilderness Divine sect has not shown off any peerless geniuses at all. If you really want to count, Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple can be considered a person with amazing talent.”

“That being said, she doesn’t seem to be much compared to Mu Beichen, and not as famous.”

“I don’t agree with what you’re saying. She defeated Xie Tianyu of the Supreme Divine sect some time ago. Her combat strength can’t be underestimated. She’s definitely on par with Mu Beichen.”

Upon hearing the conversation, both Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were shocked.

The two of them picked up on a very familiar term, ‘Cloud Sky peak…’

“Daoist Canghai, could it be that there’s another unparalleled genius from Cloud Sky peak?” Daoist Xu Yun asked doubtfully.

The three words “Cloud Sky peak” had been deeply engraved in his memories thanks to Chief Tian Xuan.

Daoist Canghai was also very puzzled.

Who was this sword immortal Ye Xuan that they were talking about?

Since when did such a peerless expert appear in the East continent?

Daoist Canghai turned to Elder Tongtian and asked, “Tongtian, who is this sword immortal they’re talking about?”

Hearing this, Elder Tongtian hurried forward and said in a soft voice, “Master, the sword immortal you’re talking about is the disciple of Chief Tian Xuan.”

“His real name is Ye Xuan. Although he is very young, he has already reached the supreme realm!”

“Furthermore, I’m afraid that even Chief Tian Xuan can’t compare to him in terms of talent in the Sword Dao.”

“Not too long ago, Elder Taiyin of the Immortal Divine sect offended this sword immortal, and even wanted to kill his disciples.”

“However, he failed and was killed. Even the Immortal Divine sect was razed to the ground.”

After hearing this, the two Daoists were shocked.

“Is this true?”

The two of them had no idea about this matter.

They knew someone from the Immortal Divine sect, Daoist Mo Nan, who had reached the middle-stage of the supreme realm. Even someone as strong as Mo Nan could not protect the Immortal Divine sect?

At this moment, both of them were shocked. They never expected that after the death of Chief Tian Xuan, such a talented person would appear in Cloud Sky peak.

After hearing Elder Tongtian’s explanation, the two of them had already sensed that Ye Xuan, who was called a sword immortal, was no weaker than them. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This left them in disbelief. They had spent hundreds of years just to reach the peak of the supreme realm, but this guy had achieved it in a few decades?

Compared to this person, Mu Beichen, the Reincarnation Fairy, and the others seemed to pale in comparison.

This was someone who could be considered an unparalleled genius!

“Daoist Canghai, it seems that we old folks can’t compete with these young people.”

Daoist Xu Yun felt very emotional. However, the two of them were very interested. What was so special about this sword immortal?

They were here to witness the rise of the geniuses of the younger generation, but after finding out about Ye Xuan, their interest shifted to him instead.

“Tongtian, is what you just said true?”

Daoist Canghai was still in disbelief.

Elder Tngtian nodded solemnly and said, “Master, it’s true.”

“I’m also familiar with Ye Xuan. His combat strength is indeed monstrous, and he’s much stronger than I am.”

“In terms of the Sword Dao, no one below the ancient realm can defeat him.”

Hearing this, Daoist Canghai’s expression changed drastically. He originally thought that he could regain his reputation in front of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, but now it seemed impossible.

Since Ye Xuan was already this strong, then the disciple he accepted would definitely be extraordinary as well.

He turned around to look at Mu Beichen and asked, “Beichen, do you know Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple? Do you have the confidence in winning?”

Hearing this, Mu Beichen’s face instantly turned bitter. He waved his hand and replied, “Grandmaster, to be honest, I don’t have full confidence in defeating Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple, but I’ll definitely do my best.”

Mu Beichen, who had always been confident, was hesitant at this moment. This was really rare.

Some time ago, Zhuge Yueyue had used the hell slash to defeat Xie Tianyu. Even though Xie Tianyu could not defeat Mu Beichen, there was not much of a difference in their strength.

Therefore, if Mu Beichen and Zhuge Yueyue were to fight, it would be hard to tell who would win.

Hearing this, the Daoist Canghai knew that things would be difficult. He had originally thought that Mu Beichen would be able to win easily this time, but fate seemed to have other things in mind.

Furthermore, the biggest threat was from Cloud Sky peak again…
