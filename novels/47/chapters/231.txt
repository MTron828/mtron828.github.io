Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After about two hours, the process was complete.

Boom!

A powerful aura suddenly swept out. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lin Qingping and Yue, who were in the middle of cultivation, suddenly opened her eyes. Zhao Yuyan, who was beside them, also stopped practicing.

“Senior Sister’s strength has increased again!”

Zhao Yuyan blinked her big eyes.

“Junior Sister Qingyan has entered the core formation realm,” Yue muttered to herself.

Lin Qingping’s eyes were filled with shock.

Ye Xuan’s disciple was so young, but she had already reached the core formation realm?

“Middle-stage of the Xudan realm, yes! Not bad!”

Ye Xuan nodded.

However, it was a pity that even after refining two great spiritual items, Li Qingyan’s dual-spirit body still did not break through to the major mastery stage.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple increase her cultivation by 3,600 days, the host has received a randomized 66x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 237,600 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple to increase the strength of her special constitution by 10x, the host has received a randomized 4x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s special constitution has been strengthened by 40x!”

At the same time, system notifications rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

Moments later, a vast and terrifying aura suddenly erupted from Ye Xuan’s body.

The black flame eagle, which was flying at high speed, suddenly trembled and was about to fall from the sky.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan instantly retracted his aura.

The black flame eagle’s heart was filled with shock. Its master’s speed of improvement was too terrifying.

How long had it even been?

Had he broken through again?

Tenth-level of the unity realm!

Ye Xuan examined the changes within his body and clenched his fists.

Ye Xuan felt that his life force had undergone a qualitative change after breaking through. It was an indescribable feeling.

No matter what kind of attack or heavy injury he suffered, he would not die.

Ye Xuan slowly extended his index finger, and a drop of blood floated out from the tip of his finger.

The drop of blood floated in the air, but Ye Xuan could sense the extremely terrifying life force contained within it.

Yue and Li Qingyan glanced at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

They could also sense the life force continued within the blood. In addition, it also contained Ye Xuan’s various martial intents.

To core formation realm cultivators, Ye Xuan’s drop of blood was undoubtedly a treasure that was hard to come by in a thousand years, which countless cultivators would fight over.

This was because this drop of blood contained legendary supreme intents. Even unity realm experts would covet this drop of blood.

“Is this the power of a tenth-level unity realm expert?”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

He felt that the power contained within his body was endless. Of course, Ye Xuan knew that it was just a feeling, but it felt great.

In addition, thanks to the terrifying life force in his divine elements, although he probably could not be revived from a single drop of blood, he would be able to do so even if he was turned into a cloud of blood mist.

“My martial intents have also improved!”

Ye Xuan said to himself after retrieving the drop of blood.

The increase in strength had caused a chain reaction in other aspects.

Of course, it was not as obvious as when he helped Yue strengthen her Sword Jade body.

Li Qingyan’s physique and cultivation had improved, but she had not comprehended any martial intents.

As such, Ye Xuan did not receive a reward from the system for this.

However, after his innate dual-spirit body was strengthened by 40 times, it was on the verge of reaching the major mastery stage.

Moreover, his fire intent was on the verge of reaching the second level, and he had also comprehended the embryonic form of wood intent, which was one of the five core elemental intents.

Incidentally, it was also related to life intent, which was a supreme intent.

As long as he mastered wood intent, he would have a high chance of comprehending life intent.

The comprehension of wood intent would give him powerful growth and endurance capabilities..

Ye Xuan then motioned for Li Qingyan to continue cultivating.

He sat down cross-legged again, and his spiritual sense activated his storage ring to take out the withered leaf bodhi. Since he had gained an additional one from the Nether God sect elders, he could afford to use this one. The ones inside the Tower of Heaven would be saved for his disciples.
