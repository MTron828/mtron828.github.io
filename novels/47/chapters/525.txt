526 Scared For His Life

In Liu Feng’s mind, the reincarnation fairy was probably the most powerful female cultivator in the entire Yangli divine empire.

He had never seen the Cloud Sky Sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hands before. Otherwise, she would have figured out who Zhuge Yueyue was.

Zhuge Yueyue replied coldly, “You don’t know who I am? In that case, open your ears and listen carefully.”

“I’m the eldest disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak, Zhuge Yueyue!”

!!

After hearing these words, Liu Feng’s heart was in turmoil.

Even in the East continent, Cloud Sky peak was very famous.

All of this was because the new chief of Cloud Sky peak was known as a sword immortal! Liu Feng’s elders had also warned him not to mess with the Great Wilderness Divine sect before he left.

However, he had stumbled upon one and offended her almost immediately. Furthermore, she was the disciple of that sword immortal.

Were the heavens playing a prank on him?

He had encountered one of the people he was trying to avoid right off the bat. This was simply unfair!

Honestly, it was his own misfortune that he had arrived late. Had he been present while Zhuge Yueyue and Xie Tianyu were fighting, he would have immediately recognized her.

At this moment, Liu Feng felt regret, so he could only swallow his pride and say, “Cough, cough! My bad, my bad. I didn’t know that you were the disciple of the sword immortal. No wonder your sword intent is so strong.”

“I was too impetuous just now. You clearly saw this treasure first, so it should naturally belong to you. I hope you won’t stoop so low as to hold a grudge.”

This time, he had to admit his mistake first. The Great Wilderness Divine sect was not something he could offend, and especially not Chief Ye Xuan.

Upon hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was stunned. She looked at the arrogant Liu Feng in disbelief.

After finding out that she was Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple, this person had made a complete 180-degree attitude shift.

Zhuge Yueyue could not believe it. Her confused look formed a strong contrast with her cold expression just now.

“What’s going on?”

“Could it be that Teacher is so famous?”

Zhuge Yueyue mumbled to herself, feeling extremely puzzled.

After a short while, her confusion turned to happiness. With Ye Xuan’s fame as a talisman, many things would be much easier.

‘It seems that even Teacher’s name is a deterrent.’

Seeing that Liu Feng had taken the initiative to admit his mistake, Zhuge Yueyue did not continue to pursue the matter. She glared at him coldly, and then went after the treasure again.

“Oh my god, that was so scary!”

After watching Zhuge Yueyue leave, Liu Feng’s worries were finally settled. He wiped off the cold sweat off his face.

He had almost done himself in just now. Fortunately, he quickly admitted his mistake. Otherwise, he would have lost his life here.

No matter what, that woman just now was the eldest disciple of the sword immortal. Even if he managed to defeat her, if Ye Xuan came looking for him for revenge, it would be over.

For this reason, the best thing to do was retreat. In any case, there was no point in creating needless enmity, especially with such a powerful expert and faction.

While Liu Feng was still wiping the cold sweat off his face, an elder appeared by his side.

“Saint, what happened?”

The elder was very confused. Seeing how worried Liu Feng was, he had no idea what had happened.

After all, in his mind, Liu Feng was an arrogant and domineering person. Why did he look so humble and subservient now? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Umm, Saint? What’s going on? Why do you look so scared? Did you get bullied?”

Liu Feng immediately turned around and retorted, “What kind of bullsh*t are you spouting? How could I be bullied? I’m the one who bullies people, not the other way around!”

After hearing these words, the elder felt very helpless.

Liu Feng recounted what had happened. After hearing the details, the elder also broke out into cold sweat.

“Oh my god!”

“Saint, the way you handled this was really right. Fortunately, we didn’t provoke Zhuge Yueyue.”

“Over the past few days, I’ve heard so many things about Sword Immortal Ye Xuan. He even defeated Elder Taiyin from the Immortal Divine sect!”

“If you really beat up that girl just now, I’m afraid that our entire sect would have suffered the consequences, and no one would be able to protect you,” the elder said with lingering fear.

However, Liu Feng was left speechless after hearing what he said.

Was this elder not thinking too highly of him?

How could he possibly defeat Zhuge Yueyue? It was already a good thing that she let him go…

While the outside world was in chaos, Ye Xuan was busy tracking the aura of the black tortoise, and trying to catch up.

After entering the true tomb, he was transported to an extremely strange area, which looked desolate. There were dilapidated buildings everywhere, and it was obvious that a great battle had occurred here at some point in time.

Although the owner of the true tomb had passed away a long time ago, the remnants of their aura were still present in this space.

After walking through this desolate land, Ye Xuan found himself standing in an ancient ruin.

Right at this moment, he could sense waves of powerful energy fluctuations coming from the distance.

After a careful search of the area, Ye Xuan was surprised by what he saw.

There were actually two supreme realm experts fighting in this place!
