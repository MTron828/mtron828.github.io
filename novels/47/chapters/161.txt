Chapter 162: Fluctuations

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Of course, there were also some cultivators who gained some enlightenment. The moment the lightning bolt fell onto the Heavenly Lightning Pool, these people seemed to have comprehended some kind of magical power.

However, when they tried to grasp it, they discovered that that magical feeling of comprehension had disappeared completely, almost as if the magical power had also suddenly disappeared.

The feeling of being on the edge of grasping something was even more frustrating than those who had not been able to comprehend anything at all.

A day quickly passed, which meant that six days had passed since the opening of the mystic realm.

During this time, Ye Xuan had been sitting cross-legged and motionless in front of the Heavenly Lightning Pool. Beside him, Yue and Huang Ling were also cultivating diligently.

Only Zhao Yuyan had stopped cultivating. This little girl had already finished comprehending all three martial techniques.

Although they were all martial techniques below black-rank, the fact that she was able to comprehend all of them within a day was enough to show how terrifying her comprehension value was.

However, there was another reason why she had stopped cultivating, which was that she was hungry and her stomach was growling.

Seeing that her teacher and senior sister were both cultivating, Zhao Yuyan rested her chin on her hands and slowly examined the faces of her teacher and senior sister. As she could not resist the pangs of hunger, she quietly left.

Only when the little girl arrived at a secluded place did she take out a few spirit fruits from her storage bracelet to satisfy her hunger.

After looking at her surroundings, Zhao Yuyan could not help but reminisce. Her previous self would never have had the chance to interact with so many cultivators. Moreover, when others heard her arrive, they would actively seek to avoid her.

However, her special constitution no longer influenced or affected others. No one had scolded or cursed her for being a jinx for some time now, which felt unnatural, but in a good way.

The reason why she was able to enjoy this feeling was because she met her teacher.

As she thought about this, Zhao Yuyan quietly walked in front of her teacher and stared at his face. She wanted to imprint his face into her heart, lest she forget what he looked like after she left the mystic realm.

After doing all this, Zhao Yuyan slowly started cultivating, trying to comprehend the higher-grade martial techniques that her teacher had previously taught her.

There were less than two days left until the mystic realm closed.

Tomorrow, the greatest opportunity in the mystic realm would appear.

The War God Hall!

At that time, all of the cultivators in the mystic realm would be instantly transported to the War God Hall.

Therefore, today was the last chance for the cultivators to comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent. If they failed, they would have to wait until the next time the mystic realm opened.

Many cultivators had already given up, including the powerhouses who were randomly teleported to the Heavenly Lightning Pool in the beginning.

They had been here for more than six days, and had ignored the prospects of finding heavenly treasures for this vague glimmer of hope.

However, they had failed to comprehend anything. It had all been for naught.

At the very least, they now understood how difficult it was to comprehend a supreme intent. It was no wonder that despite the mystic realm having been around for tens of thousands of years, no cultivator had ever been able to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent.

Of course, this also had something to do with the short duration in which the mystic realm was open.

In addition, although cultivators could enter the same mystic realm three times, they would be repelled by the power of the mystic realm on their fourth attempt.

Even unity realm experts were no exception to this rule..

If there was no limit to the number of times one could enter, perhaps there would already be cultivators who had comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Over the past tens of thousands of years, countless cultivators had already entered the mystic realm three times, and many of them had tried their luck here, including peerless geniuses. Unfortunately, even these geniuses did not gain anything.

“I’m afraid that we have to return empty-handed this time!”

“As expected of the legendary supreme intent. The degree of difficulty in comprehending it is akin to ascending to the heavens!”

“Throughout our Nanzhou Region, there are many peerless geniuses who have already comprehended fist intent, sword intent, and so on. But even so, none have succeeded when it came to comprehending the Heavenly Lightning intent!”

“I’m afraid that only the legendary Holy Land’s holy child or the Divine Empire’s divine son can comprehend it!”

“I think so too. There are records in the ancient books that in the ancient times, there were peerless geniuses with monstrous talent who had indeed comprehended a supreme intent!”

“However, such a genius would never appear within our Nanzhou Region!”

“That’s right!”

The cultivators who had given up started discussing among themselves.

Some of them were super geniuses from the Nanzhou Region who had been previously confident about their chances, wanting to break the record to become the first person in the mystic realm to comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent.

However, their confidence was unfounded, and they could only face the cruel reality of it all.

Boom!

Extremely mysterious fluctuations rippled out from the center of the Heavenly Lightning Pool, shattering the quiet and calm atmosphere here.

When everyone saw this, their pupils could not help but shrink abruptly. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“This… how is this possible? Someone actually comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent?”

“Who was it?”

These fluctuations were exactly the same as the thunderstorm cloud in the sky that was emitting the lightning bolts.

Some cultivators who were still trying to comprehend the Heavenly Lightning intent immediately opened their eyes. Their spiritual sense swept out as they tried to locate the source of these fluctuations.
