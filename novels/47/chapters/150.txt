Chapter 151: Ascending To The Heavens

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Of course, despite being only seven years old, she had already reached the second level of the refinement realm, which surpassed most ordinary cultivators.

“Yuyan! Your master will help you raise your cultivation level. You have to remember the circulation path of the spiritual power in your body. After leaving the mystic realm, you should continue to cultivate according to this technique!”

Ye Xuan looked at his young disciple and said with a smile.

“Yes, Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan nodded obediently.

“Very well, let’s begin!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan gestured for Zhao Yuyan to sit down cross-legged. Then, he stretched out his hand and gently placed it on her back.

This little girl’s comprehension value had exceeded 600. Thus, in Ye Xuan’s opinion, he only needed to explain and demonstrate things once, and it would be deeply imprinted in her mind.

When Ye Xuan’s spiritual power slowly poured into Zhao Yuyan’s body, the suppressed Demon Devourer Body actually began to stir.

‘As expected of a top-ranked special constitution. However, you haven’t developed yet, so there’s no way for you to resist my power,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

Ever since he transmigrated to the Tianyuan continent, the Demon Devourer Body could be said to be the strongest special constitution he had ever seen. Even his Sword Overlord body and innate dual-spirit physique were far inferior.

Ye Xuan’s spiritual power was like a wave of warm current that slowly flowed through Zhao Yuyan’s meridians.

Due to the Demon Devourer Body, Zhao Yuyan’s meridians had been tempered and were quite tough. Now, nourished by Ye Xuan’s spiritual power, they slowly became wider.

As time slowly passed, Zhao Yuyan’s aura also became stronger.

Third level of the refinement realm!

Fourth level of the refinement realm!

Fifth level of the refinement realm!

Sixth level of the refinement realm!

…

At the same time, Ye Xuan’s expression gradually turned solemn.

As expected of the Demon Devourer Body. Even breaking through the refinement realm required large amounts of energy.

The amount of spiritual power he was infusing into her body to help her break through was equivalent to the amount required for a qi transformation realm cultivator to break through.

‘But that’s good too. Her body will be able to withstand more of my spiritual power, and I’ll be able to obtain a better reward from the system,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.

Seventh level of the refinement realm!!

Eighth level of the refinement realm!!

Ninth level of the refinement realm!!

…

Huang Ling, who was beside him, stared at this scene in shock.

So this was why Elder Ye Xuan’s disciples’ cultivation levels rose so quickly. It was all because of Elder Ye Xuan’s spiritual power infusion!

However, would this not affect Elder Ye Xuan’s own cultivation? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Why did it not seem to have any effect on Elder Ye Xuan?

This…

Perhaps in the entire Tianyuan continent, only Ye Xuan could do this. No sane cultivator would infuse their spiritual power into their disciples. After all, that was all part of their own hard work and efforts cultivating.

Thinking this, Huang Ling unknowingly sighed deeply. Why did she not become a disciple of Elder Ye Xuan back then?

Tenth level of the refinement realm!!

First level of the qi transformation realm!

Second level of the qi transformation realm!

Third level of the qi transformation realm!

Fourth level of the qi transformation realm!

Fifth level of the qi transformation realm!

…

Eighth level of the qi transformation realm!

Ninth level of the qi transformation realm!

…

Zhao Yuyan’s cultivation level was soaring rapidly. It was not until she reached the tenth level of the qi transformation realm it came to an end.

Of course, it was Ye Xuan who chose to stop the spiritual power infusion.

Although her Demon Devourer Body had not reached its limits, he still chose to stop the spiritual power infusion.

After all, a sudden increase in strength would be difficult to control and adapt to. Thus, Ye Xuan decided to stop here for now. In this way, Zhao Yuyan’s would be able to better practice her control over her own spiritual power.

However, the Demon Devourer Body was indeed special. According to Ye Xuan’s prediction, if he had continued, Zhao Yuyan would very likely step into the true essence realm, and even advance a few minor realms.

This silly girl had suffered an extremely painful experience at such a young age. As a teacher, he naturally had to think about her.

When Huang Ling noticed the change in Zhao Yuyan’s aura, she was stunned.

This was too f*cking ridiculous!

The tenth level of the qi transformation realm?

Moreover, the spiritual power in her dantian was extremely steady and strong despite her rapid breakthroughs.

Was this not a classic case of watching others eat meat while not being able to drink soup?

“Ding! As the host has infused spiritual power into his disciple, amounting to 46 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 321x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 14,766 days’ worth of cultivation!”

As the system’s notification rang out, Ye Xuan’s body trembled slightly.

F*ck! It was more than 300 times? This was basically 40 years’ worth of cultivation!

Lucky star! This little girl is definitely my lucky star!

Moments later, a surge of power suddenly gushed out of Ye Xuan’s dantian. His limbs and bones were filled with dazzling divine elements, which refined his body rapidly.

At the same time, an incomparably terrifying aura suddenly swept out, but it was quickly restrained by Ye Xuan.

Soon, there was no trace of a cultivator’s aura around Ye Xuan’s body. He now seemed no different from an ordinary person.

“Huh?”

Huang Ling seemed to have noticed something.

Had she actually sensed a destructive aura around Elder Ye Xuan’s body just now?

What was going on?

‘Second level of the unity realm! And I’m only half a step away from the third level of the unity realm!’

His current innate bone value had already exceeded 500 points. However, even with such a high innate bone value, he had only reached the second level of the unity realm after receiving 40 years’s worth of cultivation!

This was enough to show how difficult it was for a unity realm expert to break through!
