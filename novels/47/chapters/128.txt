Ye Xuan’s expression did not change at all. He gently lifted the blood-robed old man into the air.

“You… You can’t kill me…”

Seeing this, Elder Li was terrified. He quickly shouted.

“I am an Elder of the Nether God sect. If you kill me,you will definitely be hunted down by the entire Nether God sect.”

“They will definitely be able to find out who killed me. When that happens, not only will you die, but your family, sect, and disciples will also not be spared.”

“Not only that, the Great Qian dynasty will be buried with you!”

After sensing the killing intent in Ye Xuan’s eyes, Elder Li hurriedly brought up the name of the Nether God sect.

“You dare to threaten me?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan raised his brows slightly, and a dangerous look flashed across his eyes.

“Why aren’t you letting Elder Li go? If you dare to make a move against us, you will definitely be hunted down by the Nether God sect. At that time, all nine generations of your family will definitely be executed!”

Hearing Elder Li’s words, Mo Tianyi gained confidence and added his own two cents into the mix.

From his perspective, no matter how powerful Ye Xuan was, he was just a big fish in a pond. The Nether God sect was a shark in the sea. How could a big fish compare to a shark?

Unity realm experts were indeed terrifying, but the Nether God sect did not lack unity realm experts.

Throughout the entire Nanzhou Region, other than those top-ranked super sects, the Nether God sect did not need to fear any faction at all, much less a single person from the Great Qian Dynasty.

In short, Ye Xuan could not afford to offend them!

“Oh?”

Hearing this, a sneer hung on the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth.

The old one had threatened him, and now the young one decided to open his potty mouth.

These two people actually dared to threaten him with the lives of the sect and his disciples. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

‘I’m sorry! I’m a person who can be persuaded, but cannot be forced!’

Ye Xuan’s outstretched palm suddenly clenched, and Elder Li instantly turned into bloody mist!

Before dying, his eyes were still filled with disbelief!

Ye Xuan had actually dared to kill him!

With his identity, he had roamed the Nanzhou Region untouched. Was Ye Xuan really not afraid of being hunted down by the Nether God sect?

Unfortunately, he would never know the answer.

Mo Tianyi was stunned.

He… he actually dared to kill Elder Li?

Their identities had always shielded them from danger, but why was it useless now?

Moreover, this fellow’s strength was too terrifying. He had reached the unity realm at the age of 20. Just what kind of monster was this?

How did things end up this way?

…

Before his death, many thoughts flashed through Mo Tianyi’s mind.

However, moments later, Ye Xuan reached out again and gently clenched his fist. Mo Tianyi’s body exploded as well.

Seeing this, everyone fell silent.

They had been looking forward to seeing Ye Xuan make a move, but now, they could not help but feel a sense of fear in their hearts.

With a single move, he had ended the life of an advanced-stage golden core realm expert.

This was too terrifying!

In the rumors, Ye Xuan had single-handedly destroyed the Xuanyin sect with a single sword strike.

Such an achievement made the blood of the Great Qian Dynasty’s young cultivators boil. They all regarded Ye Xuan as their idol and hoped that one day they could become as powerful.

However, today, when they saw Ye Xuan crush Elder Li like an ant, the excitement in their hearts vanished, and was replaced by fear.

Such terrifying power had completely exceeded their imagination.

That was a golden core realm expert!

Throughout the entire Great Qian Dynasty, among the top ten sects, other than the top five sects, no other forces had a golden core realm expert in their ranks.

Such a rare and terrifying top-level expert was crushed to death by Ye Xuan.

The image of Ye Xuan crushing a golden core realm expert would remain in their hearts forever. This was an indelible mark.

Of course, there were also some young cultivators who were even more excited. One should not underestimate the resilience of youth!

Ye Xuan did not know what kind of impact his actions had on those cultivators, but even if he knew, he would not be bothered with these things.

“The spatial gate is about to open!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on the spatial gate.

In the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the entrance to the Moon Demon mystic realm would be completely open.
