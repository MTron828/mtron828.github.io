808 Heavenly Tribulation (Part 1)

Looking at the three Dao Flowers above Ye Xuan’s head, everyone finally understood what he was attempting at this moment. Each and every one of them gasped in shock and amazement.

“Holy f*ck!”

“Relying on three Daos to break through?”

“Crazy, this person must be crazy! Does this person not want to live any longer?”

Some of the onlookers from beyond the barrier had already lived for over a thousand years, but this was the first time they had seen such a death-defying attempt to break through to the sealed immortal realm.

Ye Xuan’s actions were definitely akin to suicide. However, if he was lucky enough to complete three Daos together, he would definitely become the number one expert in this world. No one could compare to him.

On the flip side, failure meant death. The excitement caused everyone to break out in a cold sweat.

Zhuge Yueyue was also clenching her teeth. She looked at the scene anxiously and muttered to herself, “Teacher, you have to succeed. I believe in you!”

To her, her teacher was considered her spiritual pillar. Not only did he help her get rid of the shackles of her revenge, but he also taught her cultivation techniques and constantly protected her.

Perhaps others didn’t understand, but in her heart, Ye Xuan was more important than anything else, even her own life.

The reason why she was cultivating with all her might was that she wanted to be able to help her teacher when he was in danger. She also wanted to make her teacher proud by competing with others.

Every time she learned that Ye Xuan was in danger, her heart would twist with anxiety. She was the one most fervently praying for his success and safety.

Honestly, she did not need her teacher to be a peerless expert. She just wanted him to be safe and sound. However, it was not up to her now. It was up to Ye Xuan.

Bolts of lightning descended in quick succession, as dark clouds covered the sky. The atmosphere over Sky Mountain was oppressive and uncomfortable.

Thunder rumbled, as if heralding the start of the main show.

Ao Lei looked at this scene worriedly. He saw that Ye Xuan’s three Dao Flowers were releasing dazzling divine light. However, seconds later, they were struck by bolts of lightning.

Fortunately, when the lighting dissipated, Ye Xuan’s Dao Flowers were still floating there quietly.

“He actually blocked it?”

Everyone was shocked. That being said, even though he successfully blocked the heavenly lightning, Ye Xuan was not in good condition.

He held his chest with his right hand and spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, he raised his head and looked at the sky.

Every movement seemed painful at this moment, but Ye Xuan’s expression did not change. After wiping the blood from his mouth unhurriedly, he said to himself, “I was indeed too impatient this time around…”

Ye Xuan originally wanted to continue accumulating strength before attempting to break through to the sealed immortal realm. Unfortunately, after the battle with Mengyu, he lost control of his power, and was forced to attempt a breakthrough.

In any case, since things had reached this point. Ye Xuan’s only choice was to forcefully charge forward and complete his breakthrough today.

After taking a deep breath, Ye Xuan closed his eyes and muttered to himself, “Keep it coming. Allow me to properly experience how difficult the heavenly tribulation of this world is!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan quietly floated in the sky, and he began to release the spiritual power within his body.

His powerful sword aura started to wreak havoc everywhere. Streaks of sword aura flashed continuously all over the place, and in the blink of an eye, a tall mountain was sliced in half.

“Oh my god…”

“This is bad. Look, the barrier is about to shatter.”

Everyone could sense that after Ye Xuan completely released his sword aura, the cracks on the world barrier spread even faster, causing people to panic. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Moments later, another extremely terrifying heavenly lightning bolt appeared and struck Ye Xuan’s three Dao Flowers.

Ye Xuan’s body suddenly trembled from the damage he suffered, and he spat out another mouthful of blood.

At that moment, another cultivator said in surprise, “Could it be that he’s already undergoing the sealed immortal realm’s heavenly tribulation?”

“Oh? What is that?”

People immediately looked over with interest.

Although they knew that if they wanted to become sealed immortal realm experts, they had to prove and complete their Dao, so that it was recognized by the laws of the world, they did not have a detailed understanding of the crucial details.

Some of the people who had reached the peak of the ancient realm explained, “Everyone knows that if one’s cultivation level has already reached the peak of the ancient realm, one must comprehend the Dao and break away from the mortal world.”

“There are many Daos, such as the Dao of Merit, the Great Dao of Body Refining, the Dao of the Sword, the Dao of the Saber, and so on…”

“As long as you completely comprehend one of the Daos, you will be able to rely on this Dao to experience the heavenly tribulation in order to obtain recognition from the laws of the world.”

“The heavenly tribulations are based on one’s Dao, but…”

After saying this, the white-haired old man’s expression changed drastically before he continued, “There are also levels of difficulty when it comes to heavenly tribulations. Those who choose a more difficult Dao, and those who choose to comprehend more Daos, will naturally experience more difficult tribulations.”

“Those that fail will suffer tragic ends…”

“This…”

After hearing this, everyone immediately understood.
