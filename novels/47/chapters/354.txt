355 The System Awakens

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a hundred years had passed.

East Continent, Great Wilderness Divine sect, Cloud Sky peak.

In an ancient wooden house, a young man in white sat cross-legged.

Suddenly, the young man’s eyes opened, and a bright light flashed across his pupils.

100 years have finally passed!

The system was finally going to be reactivated!

Through the window of the wooden house, one could see the immortal spiritual energy that filled the surrounding mountain peaks. From time to time, cultivators would fly past on flying swords, as well as those flying on cranes. It was just like how the stories about immortals had been described.

“It’s a pity that Tian Xuan has already passed away,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

Not long after he accepted Ye Xuan as his disciple, Tian Xuan’s lifespan came to an end and he passed away.

However, before his death, Tian Xuan passed on the position of chief of Cloud Sky peak to Ye Xuan. However, considering Ye Xuan’s special status, he did not teach him any high-level cultivation methods. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Suddenly, a crisp mechanical voice rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! The system has absorbed enough energy and is in the process of awakening.”

“Ding! The system has successfully awakened and is now in service of the host!”

“Ding! The host can receive randomized critical rewards by taking in disciples, infusing spiritual power into them, or imparting various cultivation resources and heavenly treasures to them. The highest reward multiplier is 10,000x!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes brightened.

“Phew! I’ve endured humiliation for a hundred years, and finally, this damn system has returned!”

“Ding! The system’s status panel has changed. The host is advised to examine it!”

“Oh?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan immediately opened his attribute panel.

Ye Xuan

[Cultivation: Second-level of the divine mystic realm (the mystic world’s weakling)]

[Divine powers: None]

[Divine bones: None (A rookie among rookies. It’ll be difficult to achieve anything in his lifetime)]

[Appearance: Indescribably handsome.]

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he saw this.

The system seemed to be asking for a beating after its upgrade.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has advanced to the divine mystic realm and has obtained a great advancement gift bag! Would you like to open it?”

“Of course I’ll open it,” Ye Xuan said without hesitation.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has received a yellow-rank marrow cleansing pill and 50 years’ worth of cultivation!”

After the system notification ended, Ye Xuan’s body suddenly trembled as spiritual power suddenly surged into his dantian!

“Ah! How I’ve missed this feeling!”

Soon, Ye Xuan’s dantian completely digested the spiritual power, and he broke through to the third level of the divine mystic realm.

“Wait a minute! I received 50 years’ worth of cultivation, but only advanced one level?”

Ye Xuan complained inwardly.

“Ding! As the host’s body does not contain any divine bones, the host’s level of talent is ordinary. As such, the host’s cultivation speed naturally cannot be compared to the geniuses of the mystic world.”

It seemed that divine bones were really important.

However, now that he had the system again, was there a need to be afraid of this shortcoming?

Ye Xuan looked at the marrow cleansing pill and fell into a state of deep thought.

Although consuming this pill would help him, it would be more beneficial to use it on a disciple.

Bang Bang Bang!

At this moment, there was a sudden knock on the door.

“Chief Ye Xuan, are you there?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes darkened, and then a smile appeared on his face.

“Come in!” Ye Xuan said.

“Greetings, Martial Uncle Ye!”

The person who entered was a handsome young man with a gentle and refined temperament.

Ye Xuan was no stranger to this man. He was a direct disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Hua Rufeng, and was considerably stronger than Ye Xuan.

He was gentle and elegant, and did not put on any airs.

Furthermore, he was basically a shoo-in to become the successor of the sect master position of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Therefore, Hua Rufeng had a good relationship with the chiefs and the elders, and cultivators in the sect.

In Ye Xuan’s opinion, this guy was a smart person. He had already made the necessary connections and relationships before taking up the leadership position.

“Martial Uncle Ye, Teacher asked me to inform you that we’re about to hold a meeting and to invite you to head over.”

“Did Senior Brother mention what this meeting was about?” Ye Xuan asked.

Tian Xuan loved peace and quiet and did not build a proper residence on Cloud Sky Peak other than this wooden house, which was quite run-down and dilapidated.

Could something big have happened?

Hua Rufeng hesitated for a moment and then said, “Yesterday, berserk beasts attacked the village at the foot of the mountain and killed numerous villagers.”

“Although the sect’s cultivators reacted quickly and killed many of them, there were almost no survivors. Only a few lucky ones were brought back to the sect.”

“Teacher called for a meeting to discuss how to deal with the berserk beasts, as well as how to deal with the survivors.”

“I see.”

Ye Xuan nodded in realization.

Honestly, it was not too hard to deal with the survivors. They could simply test them for divine bones and put them in the outer sect.

However, had this happened before today, Ye Xuan would probably not have been interested. Now that the system had awakened, this was a great opportunity to take in a disciple!
