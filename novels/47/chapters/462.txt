463 The Semifinals (Part 2)

As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd started clamoring.

Ye Xuan looked at Gao Shun and frowned.

Sure enough, this person was the culprit again.

However, from the looks of it, Gongsun Shouyue did not object to this change.

When Yuelun heard this, she became worried.

Although Li Hanyi had advanced to the top four, she did not have much of an advantage over the other three.

Even if she were lucky enough to beat her opponent, she would likely be too exhausted to put up a fight in the final match.

That fellow was really too hateful…

At the thought of this, Yuelun could not help but glare at Gao Shun.

“The semifinals will be held simultaneously. All participants, please come up to the arena,” the judge continued.

Ye Xuan smiled and nodded at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Teacher, I’m off!” Zhuge Yueyue bowed to Ye Xuan before walking off toward the arena.

“Teacher, I’m going too!”

On the other side, Li Hanyi also made her way over, as did Gao Tianyu and Bai Xuanyuan.

Although Ye Xuan did not know what Gao Shun did, looking at Gao Tianyu’s current expression, it was obvious that he thought that he had victory in his hands.

“Junior Brother Ye, aren’t you worried about this new rule?”

Yuelun was curious.

Ye Xuan smiled and shrugged, not saying anything.

When Yuelun saw this, she was confused.

Why was this guy so calm?

Was he not worried about his disciple?

In the arena, Zhuge Yueyue was facing Bai Xuanyuan.

Bai Xuanyuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue and bowed with a smile.

“Junior Sister Zhuge, please show mercy. Don’t beat me up too badly.”

Zhuge Yueyue did not say much and just nodded.

Bai Xuanyuan’s mouth twitched as he smiled bitterly.

He was just being polite. Did she really think that she could beat him?

‘Junior Sister Zhuge is just like the rumors say. She’s cold and quiet. It seems that she’s not easy to get along with.’

Bai Xuanyuan shook his head helplessly and did not mind it too much.

At this moment, in the other arena, Li Hanyi and Gao Tianyu also entered the arena. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Let the matches begin,” the judge announced loudly.

As soon as he finished speaking, the two arenas exploded with powerful spiritual power fluctuations.

Gao Tianyu was the first to attack. He did not use his magic artifact and spewed out torrents of water that swept toward Li Hanyi with terrifying power.

On the other side, Bai Xuanyuan’s eyes flashed, and his longsword shone as he slashed toward Zhuge Yueyue.

“Junior Sister Zhuge, here I come. Be careful!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue gently waved her hand, and the Cloud Sky Sword appeared. However, Zhuge Yueyue only held the sheath of the sword lightly and pushed it forward.

In that instant, a visible air current swept out and easily shattered Bai Xuanyuan’s attack.

“What?”

Gongsun Shouyue saw this scene and turned to look at Ye Xuan in surprise.

As Bai Xuanyuan’s teacher, he naturally had an almost complete grasp of his disciple’s strength.

Even though he had not used his full strength in that attack, it was still an extremely strong attack. However, Zhuge Yueyue had easily dealt with it.

At this moment, Bai Xuanyuan’s attacks were like a violent storm that wreaked havoc in the arena.

In contrast, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression was calm. Her movements were like a breeze, and she was always able to avoid Bai Xuanyuan’s attacks and easily deal with his attacks.

When Feng Xiyun saw this, a smile appeared on her face.

She had been sparring with Zhuge Yueyue all this time and naturally knew how terrifyingly strong the latter was. Most importantly, Zhuge Yueyue’s most powerful strength was her sword technique.

It was obvious that Bai Xuanyuan’s current attacks were not enough to force Zhuge Yueyue to use her sword technique.

Bai Xuanyuan felt extremely aggrieved by this situation.

He had thought that his talent was second only to Hua Rufeng in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. He even deemed himself superior to Gao Tianyu.

However, here he was struggling against an opponent who had only started cultivating three months ago.

What kind of genius was she?

Bai Xuanyuan then increased the strength of his attacks.

The sword in Bai Xuanyuan’s hand started to spin in a mysterious way, forming a special pattern. His aura skyrocketed.

When the surrounding crowd saw this, their expressions changed.

The power of this sword attack was infinitely close to the ninth level of the materialization realm!

...

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue squinted her eyes and her expression gradually turned serious, and she unsheathed the Cloud Sky Sword.

“Junior Sister Zhuge, I’m going to get serious!”

Moments later, a sword attack covered with mysterious patterns soared into the sky and swept toward Zhuge Yueyue!

Wherever the sword attack passed by, cracks would appear on the ground.

Zhuge Yueyue did not dare to underestimate Bai Xuanyuan’s attack. The Cloud Sky Sword released a sharp and cold aura as she slashed it toward Bai Xuanyuan.

The two of them fought back and forth.

However, as time passed, Zhuge Yueyue’s Cloud Sky sword technique was gradually suppressed.

Then her eyes flashed with a cold light, and the heavenly slash burst forth.
