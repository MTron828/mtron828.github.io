712 Zhuge Yueyue’s Worries

Thank you readers!

Fortunately, the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s recruitment period had not started yet. Otherwise, many genius disciples might have been stolen away.

“Damn it! Let’s leave now.”

If they allowed him to continue his spiel, their disciples would probably start having second thoughts about the sect. Therefore, many forces immediately left.

Seeing this scene, Gao Shun was somewhat flustered and exasperated. After all, he had thought that this was the perfect opportunity.

Chu Batian simply wiped the sweat off his forehead and said, “Fellow Daoist Gao, your joke isn’t funny at all. In any case, we’ll take our leave first.”

“Reincarnation Fairy, go over and say goodbye to Sword Immortal Ye and the others first. Then, we’ll go back.”

The Reincarnation Fairy cupped her fists and bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan as she said, “Chief Ye Xuan, thank you for saving me last time. I will remember your kindness for the rest of my life.”

Ye Xuan waved his hand at her, indicating that she should not take the matter to heart.

“It’s just a small matter,” Ye Xuan said indifferently, but she did not think so.

“Chief Ye Xuan, it might be a trivial matter to you, but to me, it is a life-saving kindness that I can never repay.”

“If there ever comes a day when I can help you, I hope you won’t stand on courtesy and just tell me. I’ll definitely do my best to help you.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan’s heart trembled, but he did not decline. This girl was quite sensible. Unfortunately, she was not his disciple. He simply nodded in affirmation.

After seeing Ye Xuan nod, the Reincarnation Fairy shifted her gaze to Zhuge Yueyue, as the scene where they had both eliminated each other played out in her mind again.

“If we ever fight again, I definitely won’t be defeated.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After saying this, she turned around without hesitation and followed Chu Batian back.

Zhuge Yueyue clenched her fists tightly as she watched the Reincarnation Fairy leave. Her eyes looked a little glazed.

In her opinion, the Reincarnation Fairy’s words before she left were not baseless. After all, their starting points were different. The Reincarnation Fairy was immensely talented, which led to her selection and training as a Saintess, while she had only been an ordinary person.

The only reason why she could rival the Reincarnation Fairy was due to her teacher, who had nurtured her with countless treasures and taught her many powerful cultivation facts.

However, would she be able to bridge the gap between them?

After watching the Reincarnation Fairy walk away, Zhuge Yueyue’s mood was a little low.

At this moment, a warm palm gently rubbed her head.

Zhuge Yueyue raised her head and looked up.

“Teacher”

Zhuge Yueyue murmured softly, and Ye Xuan comforted her, “Don’t let your thoughts run wild. After all, in my heart, the three of you are definitely the best, and will always be.”

“As long as you’re willing to persevere, even an iron rod can be ground into a needle. You’re already lucky enough. You’re no worse than these geniuses.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhuge Yueyue pulled herself together and her heart was filled with warmth.

“Yes, Teacher. I understand. I will definitely cultivate diligently and won’t let you down.”

What her teacher said was very reasonable. Even though she was not as good as other geniuses in the sky, so what?

Her luck was much better than the other geniuses. Although it was regrettable that she had not become the champion, so what?

What had happened had already happened. What was the use of regretting now? What she needed to do was to continue advancing forward.

Ye Xuan smiled when he saw that Zhuge Yueyue had regained her determination. Then, he glanced at his disciples.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan said, “Xiyun, come over here as well.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun was momentarily stunned at first, then immediately went to Ye Xuan’s side.

“Both of you, stretch out your hands. I want to give you something.”

“Ah?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were dumbfounded, but they still obeyed and stretched out their hands.

“Eh… What is going on?”
