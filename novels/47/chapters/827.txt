828 Golden-Furred Growler (Part 3)

The golden-furred growler was fuming with anger, and immediately unleashed his full power.

His body turned red, as the flames around his body intensified, trying to cook the monkey alive.

The temperature in the surroundings rose rapidly.

At this moment, Wu Kong realized that something was amiss. However, he remained unafraid, and continued to mock and ridicule the golden-furred growler.

“Is that all you have? Please make it a little hotter. It feels like a comfortable sauna inside here!”

After hearing this, the golden-furred growler spat out fire. However, no matter how angry he was, there was nothing he could do about it.

“Damn it!”

He kept channeling his spiritual power to increase the heat, but suddenly, an even more intense pain wracked his body, causing him to spurt out blood. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He could clearly feel the monkey punching his internal organs from inside his stomach. It was excruciating.

Puchi!

After spitting out another mouthful of bright crimson blood, the golden-furred growler’s entire body trembled as he fell from the sky.

Everyone was already dumbfounded.

After he fell to the ground, he continued to roll around. As he rolled, he cried out in pain, “Ahhhh! It hurts so much!”

Feeling intense pain, the golden-furred growler knelt on the ground and begged for mercy.

This was the first time he had experienced such pain since he was born. After all, his fur had strong defensive properties, but the same could not be said for his internal organs.

Within moments, the golden-furred growler was already breathing heavily, and was on the verge of death.

“You piece of trash, are you convinced now?”

After throwing those punches, Wu Kong felt a lot better.

“C’mon, keep trying to cook me, and I’ll keep punching. Let’s see which one of us lasts longer!”

“No, no, that’s enough! Master Monkey, Master Monkey, please let me go,” the golden-furred growler endured the intense pain and said.

“Respected Master Monkey, please leave my body. I have truly realized my mistake.”

The golden-furred growler finally understood that this monkey was impervious to most elements, and that swallowing him into his stomach had been a terrible decision.

“Hahaha!”

Hearing the golden-furred growler begging for mercy, Wu Kong laughed heartily.

Then, he said, “Sure, I can come out, but you have to kneel down first and shout loudly three times that you are a piece of trash. Then I’ll spare your life.””

After hearing this, the golden-furred growler was enraged. How could he do such a humiliating thing?

Then, a few more punches landed on his internal organs…

“You’re a piece of trash!”

“You’re a piece of trash!”

“You’re a piece of trash!”

Hearing these three sentences, the monkey was infuriated.

“Say it properly!”

Wu Kong slammed his fists against the walls of the golden-furred growler’s stomach a few more times, causing the latter to cry out in pain.

The golden-furred growler was in so much pain that he wanted to cry.

“If you don’t say it correctly, I’ll smash all of your internal organs!”

Hearing this, the golden-furred growler was deeply afraid and stood up shakily. He could only suppress the anger in his heart.

‘You damn monkey, how dare you treat me like this! When you come out, I’ll definitely skin you alive!’

Finally, the golden-furred growler shouted in displeasure, “I’m a piece of trash! “I’m a piece of trash! “I’m a piece of trash!”

“Master Monkey, did you hear it?”

Forcing him to say those words was really a very difficult thing. After all, every noble beast had its own pride.

“Haha, that’s good.”

Wu Kong was finally satisfied and said, “Open your mouth wide. I’ll be out right away.”

The golden-furred growler immediately opened his mouth wide, and Wu Kong jumped out.

After noticing this scene, Ye Xuan could not help but sigh.

How could the monkey be so soft-hearted to his enemy?

Ye Xuan was also a little careless. He actually forgot to teach Wu Kong about the realities of the cultivation world.

However, it was not a big deal, since after experiencing what would soon follow, Wu Kong would not make such a mistake again.

“What the hell? Is this monkey stupid?”

Even Gao Shun was dumbfounded.
