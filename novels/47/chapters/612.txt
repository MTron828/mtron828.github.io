613 Stay For Dinner?

“Haha, Martial Uncle Ye really knows how to joke around.”

“Don’t worry, Martial Uncle Ye, no one would dare to make a move on the water cloud fruit tree.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the sect’s cultivators hurriedly responded, while asking Ye Xuan to stop teasing them.

Ye Xuan’s jokes were too scary!

At this very moment, there was no one who would dare to plot against the water cloud fruit tree. In fact, they did not even dream about it.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Hua Rufeng was dumbfounded. This was an open threat. In any case, only someone with a screw loose would do such a thing.

Anyone who was normal would probably be thinking about how to please Ye Xuan so as to gain the permission to cultivate here.

Yuelun was already grinning from ear to ear. This kid really liked to joke around with people.

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at the cultivators around him. Seeing that they had more or less benefited from the earlier waves of spiritual energy, Ye Xuan nodded to himself.

There were even many of them who had broken through.

After mulling it over for a while, Ye Xuan continued, “Senior Brother Gao, do you think what I said is right?”

After saying that, Ye Xuan looked at Gao Shun indifferently, causing the latter’s expression to change.

“Cough, cough, you’re definitely right,” Gao Shun hurriedly said.

Seriously, why did Ye Xuan drag him into this?

He definitely had no ill intentions toward the water cloud fruit tree. He could not stick around here for too long, lest his intentions be misunderstood.

After a calm smile, Gao Shun continued, “Junior Brother Ye, I still have something urgent to deal with at home, so I’ll head back first.”

“Hehe, if Chief Gao Shun didn’t mention it, I would have almost forgotten that I also have something that I have to rush back to deal with. I’ll take my leave first,” Li Dahai said with a smile and quickly followed suit.

The other chiefs also left one by one.

After the chiefs left, ye Xuan turned his eyes to the cultivators cultivating here and said with a chilly tone, “Are you guys waiting for me to serve dinner?”

Upon hearing this, most of their legs began to tremble.

“Ahem, Martial Uncle Ye, you’re too kind, but we’ll pass on the offer.”

“There’s some commotion back at our peaks, so we have to hurry back and deal with it. Goodbye, Martial Uncle Ye.”

Within a few short moments, the area had become deserted.

At this moment, Xiang Yun suddenly piped up, “Senior Sister, do you still remember the unicorns you told me about? Why don’t you take me there for a look?”

“I want to ride a unicorn!”

Seeing that this little girl had already started to dance with excitement, Zhuge Yueyue was helpless.

Why was this little girl still thinking about unicorns? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It seemed that the unicorns at the rear of the mountain peak were going to have to suffer a little.

She could only pray for them in secret.

“Alright, alright. I’ll bring you over there later, okay?”

Zhuge Yueyue tried to calm her down, but it did not work.

“I can’t wait any longer. I want to ride unicorns!”

Left with no choice, Zhuge Yueyue could only look at Ye Xuan for help.

Ye Xuan nodded with a smile and said, “It’s fine, you can bring her along.”

“Oh right, help her wash up and change her clothes, and don’t go too far later.”

“Alright, Teacher. I’ll bring her over now.”

After agreeing, Zhuge Yueyue brought Xiang Yun away.

Ye Xuan turned to Yuelun and said, “Senior Sister Yue, why are you still here? Don’t tell me you want to have dinner with me?”

Yuelun helplessly glared at him and said, “Am I getting in your way? You seem so anxious to chase me away.”

Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “Actually, it’s not like that. Senior Sister Yuelun, if you want to stay here, I definitely won’t have any objections.”

“After all, there are many new houses here, so it’s definitely not a problem for you to live here.”

“Also, if you’re really going to stay here for a long time, we can have a good chat when we have time. Cough, cough. Even if you want to, we can even talk about the finer things in life.”

After hearing this, Yuelun was a little tempted. However, she felt that there was something off about Ye Xuan’s smile.

Finer things in life?

What was that about?

Ye Xuan’s imagination was already running wild at this time. This senior sister of his was really too innocent.

After seriously thinking about it, Yuelun replied in a soft voice, “We can have a discussion, but I’m afraid I’m not free for the time being. How about we schedule it for another day?”
