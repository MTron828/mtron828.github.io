This was his full power attack.

Hopefully, she would not be able to react in time to this sudden attack.

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes instantly snapped open, and a murderous look flashed across the depths of her eyes.

She did not expect that someone would try to kill her just a few days after she arrived in the mystic realm.

Buzzzzzz!

Her figure flashed and suddenly appeared in the sky as she swung her longsword.

A beam of dazzling divine light suddenly erupted, causing the entire world to lose its color.

“What?”

His expression changed drastically upon seeing this.

Seventh-level sword intent!

Why was he so unlucky?

He encountered another monster again!

Previously, there was Ye Xuan, and now, there was this woman in white. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

F*ck!

Furthermore, this woman’s strength seemed to far exceed Ye Xuan’s.

‘I’m doomed!’

It was already eight lifetimes of bad luck for him to have met a monster like Ye Xuan.

He did not expect that he would encounter another even more terrifying monster just possessing a body.

How the f*ck did this make sense?

Buzzzzzz!

He decisively gave up control of the body and tried to escape quietly with his soul.

However, as soon as his soul left his body, it was suddenly grabbed by a giant golden hand. Then, it was forcibly stuffed back into the body.

Then, the dazzling sword qi completely destroyed his body and soul.

“Why are they all so freakish!”

“Ye Xuan, I hate you so much!”

He let out a furious roar before he died.

“Ye Xuan?”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er frowned.

She was clearly the one who killed him, so why did this person scream another person’s name before he died?

However, Shangguan Wan’er did not mind it too much. She continued to comprehend the heavenly lightning intent.

In the mystic realm, there were naturally many other experts who were also trying to comprehend heavenly lightning intent. They were all shocked by the terrifying sword qi that Shangguan Wan’er had released.

They were so scared that they did not dare to continue comprehending until they were absolutely certain that Shangguan Wan’er would not attack them.

…

The moment Shangguan Wan’er killed the master of the Blood Moon Temple, Ye Xuan, who was far away in the Nanzhou Region, suddenly opened his eyes.

“He’s dead?”

“Who did this?”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

Ye Xuan was surrounded by layers of mysterious power.

This was the karmic intent!

After using up two epiphany experiences, which took a full five days, coupled with the experience of previously comprehending two supreme intents, Ye Xuan finally comprehended the embryonic form of karmic intent.

This had emptied Ye Xuan’s coffers when it came to epiphany experience opportunities.

The reason why Ye Xuan was so anxious to comprehend karmic intent was simple.

Pressured by the danger that Qian Daoliu’s main body posed, he wanted to use karmic intent to avoid detection.

In addition to the Paramita Flower, Ye Xuan had also refined other spiritual items that could increase his comprehension value.

Originally, he thought that it would not be too difficult for him to comprehend the karmic intent given his past experiences.

However, the truth was beyond his imagination. If he did not have the epiphany experience opportunities and the heavenly treasures that could increase his comprehension value, he might not have even successfully comprehended the embryonic form of karmic intent.

“It’s truly worthy of being the most mysterious supreme intent!”

Ye Xuan sighed.

The road to comprehending the complete form of karmic intent would be arduous and long.

However, there were still some benefits to comprehending the embryonic form of karmic intent. For starters, he now had a foundation to work with. In the future, when he comprehended other supreme intents, his experience in comprehending the embryonic form of karmic intent would make this a lot easier.

Although Ye Xuan could not use the embryonic form of karmic intent to predict the future or read the past, he could vaguely sense the status of those he had formed karmic ties with.

This was how he knew that the master of the Blood Moon Temple had died.

However, when he tried to use the embryonic form of karmic intent to investigate, everything was shrouded in fog. All he could see was the vague outline of a beautiful figure.

Somehow, Ye Xuan had an inexplicable feeling that he would have some kind of relationship with that beautiful figure in the future.

Hu!

Ye Xuan immediately took a deep breath.

It was still quite difficult to spy on others using the power of karma. Just that brief insight had almost completely drained his spiritual power.

The most important thing was that he had only peeked for a short while, and the power in his body seemed to have been emptied.

Although he could not control the power of karma perfectly, he could at least sense the karmic lines that existed between him and the outside world through the power of karma in his body.

The karmic lines between him, Yue, and his other disciples were the strongest.

As for the other cultivators of the Qingyun sect, there were also karmic lines, but they were less pronounced.

It was rumored that terrifyingly powerful beings could use the power of karma to sever karmic lines, removing any karma between them,

Ye Xuan was nowhere close to being capable of this though. Even sensing karmic lines took a fair amount of effort.

Ye Xuan guessed that only by fully comprehending the complete form of karmic intent would he be able to automatically sense karmic lines.
