943 Shadow Of The Sky God

Some observant people had already noticed that every time Ye Xuan condensed a figure, the aura he released would become stronger.

When he condensed 12 figures, the aura he released reached an extremely terrifying level.

“Damn it!”

At this moment, the flood dragon could no longer maintain its composure. How the hell was it going to fight this person?

All thoughts of fighting Ye Xuan had vanished, and now it just wanted to escape as soon as possible.

If it did not run away now, it would really be a fool. It directed all of its power into trying to escape the restraints that bound it. As long as it could escape these restraints, it would be able to hide in the endless depths of the sea.

However, at this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. The 12 figures behind him did the same.

Looking at the flood dragon that was desperately trying to escape, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke with a cold expression.

“It’s useless! The Shadow of the Sky God has already locked onto you. No matter where you run to, it’s useless.”

The Shadow of the Sky God was a terrifying divine power Ye Xuan had learnt. As long as he used it, his enemies would not be able to escape. Furthermore, the divine power amplified his combat strength greatly.

Unbelievably, his cultivation level had risen to the eternal realm!

“Heavens! He has already reached the eternal realm!”

“Is this really happening? What kind of divine power is that?”

The crowd broke out in animated discussions. This was the first time many of them had seen something this spectacular.

Ye Xuan was already able to suppress the flood dragon before this, so now that his strength had risen to this level, there was no way the flood dragon would be able to put up a fight!

Everyone looked on in amazement. Divine powers like this were one-in-a-million!

The Nine-tailed Sparrow was even more taken aback by this. This human expert was truly extraordinary. She wondered whether she would be able to withstand this divine power if she had reached the eternal realm herself.

It was downright scary!

Not long ago, the flood dragon was still able to struggle against Ye Xuan. However, after Ye Xuan used the Shadow of the Sky God, the flood dragon was no longer qualified to be Ye Xuan’s enemy.

This was also the first time Ye Xuan had activated the Shadow of the Sky God, so he felt a little excited. After all, he himself had not expected that the Shadow of the Sky God would actually possess such terrifying power.

‘Haha! I didn’t expect this skill to be so powerful. If anyone dares to provoke me in the future, it’ll probably be very interesting,’ Ye Xuan could not help but think to himself.

However, he felt a little regretful at this moment. After all, he had been wholeheartedly focused on cultivating the Stellar Sword technique in the past, so he did not pay much attention to the Shadow of the Sky God.

It was precisely because of this that he was limited to just 12 figures at the moment. If he completely mastered it, he would be able to release 24 figures!

At that time, would he still need to be afraid of anyone?

“From today onward, comprehending the Shadow of the Sky God must take priority.”

Turning his attention back to the battle, Ye Xuan’s 12 figures surrounded the flood dragon.

“Little Long Worm, the crime you committed is unforgivable, so make it easy on yourself and surrender!”

Hearing this, the flood dragon was extremely angry and cursed.

“Like hell I’ll surrender!” If you have the ability, defeat me first!”

It had been trying to escape for a long time, but in the end, realized that it was impossible. With all of its hopes in tatters, it decided to risk it all and fight Ye Xuan with everything it had. With that in mind, it assumed a battle stance and roared.

A powerful force erupted, and the sky was filled with black clouds, catching the onlookers by surprise.

“Is the flood dragon already planning to risk its life and go all out?”

“It must be. It has nowhere to retreat now. If it succeeds in pushing Ye Xuan, it might be able to win itself a chance of survival.”

After noticing this situation, they looked on in anticipation. A great battle was about to erupt! A contest between peerless experts!

Even though Ye Xuan had the upper hand from the beginning, the flood dragon dared to fight Ye Xuan to the death and did not choose to submit. This courage was very admirable.

On the other hand, when Ye Xuan noticed that the aura released by the flood dragon was still growing stronger, he frowned. It seemed that this old fellow could release even more power when it was forced into a desperate situation.

However, it did not matter. Today, the life of this worm would be used to announce the awesomeness of his Shadow of the Sky God technique!

“Haha, alright. I want to see just what you’re capable of,” Ye Xuan said coldly. Suddenly, he reached out his right hand and grabbed the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

“Whoa! Big Brother, what are you trying to do?”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was stunned and flustered at this moment.

Why was it suddenly pulled into the battle? He would not be able to help Ye Xuan in the battle, and would instead drag him down. It squirmed and struggled, trying to escape Ye Xuan’s grasp.

However, at this moment, he suddenly sensed a terrifying suction force that was extracting the lightning energy from his body. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

What was he trying to do?

Ye Xuan’s actions had completely dumbfounded the onlookers.
