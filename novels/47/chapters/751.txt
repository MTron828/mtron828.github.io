752 Cowards

Fortunately, almost all of the villages near the desert region had been evacuated, so only those who had refused to move were devoured.

At this moment, there were still many people rushing toward the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s line of defense frantically.

The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had already set up a line of defense and a defensive formation near the peak of Sky Mountain, quietly waiting for the arrival of the berserk beasts.

Under Gao Shun’s command, the various peaks had also sent their disciples to guard this place.

“Martial Uncle!”

After learning about the situation, Hua Rufeng arrived at the mountain peak with a flustered expression.

“At present, there are already tens of millions of people behind our line of defense, and this number is still increasing.”

“But there’s already danger up ahead. If we don’t close the formation now, I’m afraid something might happen later.”

He really did not expect that so many people would rush over after the Great Wilderness Divine sect released their announcement.

Although the numbers did not really matter, time did, as the beasts were quickly approaching. If they did not act soon, the berserk beasts would overrun the entrance to the formation and destroy it.

Gao Shun was also aware of this, and was pondering how to deal with the matter. In the distance, flames had already lit up the sky.

However, when he saw that there were still countless people rushing over, Gao Shun was left with a dilemma. If he closed the entrance now, those people would definitely be doomed.

Just as Gao Shun was racking his brains, an elder of a major family spoke with a nervous expression, “Chief Gao Shun, we shouldn’t bother with these ordinary people. We have to act now or there really won’t be enough time.”

“That’s right, that’s right. Chief Gao Shun, we should consider the overall situation.”

“A few million is nothing compared to the tens of millions of people here. The most important thing for us now is to maintain this line of defense, or everything will be lost.”

When faced with a life-threatening situation, these people would only care about protecting themselves.

Hearing the suggestions, Gao Shun’s heart was filled with disgust, and he swept a cold glance at them.

Millions of lives were nothing in their eyes.

However, it was different for the Great Wilderness Divine sect. After all, they were here to protect the common people!

If he closed the entrance now, it would be tantamount to slapping himself in the face and going against his earlier words.

At this moment, when the others heard the words of the elders of these major families, they all clenched their fists tightly, wishing they could punch them a few times.

“Damn it! These people are too despicable. They actually want to sacrifice millions of lives for their own safety.”

“These people from the major families are all talk and no action. They were the first to flee the cities, and now they are trying to pressure the Great Wilderness Divine sect to close the entrance. How disappointing.”

After hearing these words, the family elders felt very ashamed, but also did not feel remorse. Their own safety was paramount, after all.

Everyone’s gaze was now cast towards Gao Shun. After all, he was the one in charge here, and his word was law.

“Chief Gao Shun, we can’t delay any longer. Hurry up and give the order.”

Seeing that Gao Shun was still hesitating at this moment, another family’s elder spoke up.

Gao Shun glared at him fiercely and said in dissatisfaction, “Ha! You coward, our Great Wilderness Divine sect has already declared to the public that we will protect the safety of the common folk. How could we give up on these millions of people easily?”

“If you feel that this place is not safe enough, then feel free to leave. I will not force you to stay here.”

As soon as he said that, everyone fell silent.

After a while, cheers suddenly rang out.

“Hahaha! This is how it should be done!”

“The people of the Great Wilderness Divine sect are indeed extraordinary. Well scolded! Otherwise, these cowards will take advantage of them.”

“Really, this group of major families are too timid. They usually act arrogantly on their own turf, but once danger comes, they all go into hiding.”

“If you’re afraid that this place isn’t safe, then leave immediately. Don’t stay here and muddy the waters.”

These people had long been very dissatisfied with the major families, so they took the opportunity to lambast them openly.

At this moment, the expressions of the members of these major families burned with humiliation. However, the one who had rebuked them was a supreme realm expert, so they did not dare to refute his words.

“Chief Gao Shun is the best!”

“Chief Gao Shun is awesome!”

Gao Shun was smiling happily. Being praised like this always felt awesome. Being righteous had its perks!𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
