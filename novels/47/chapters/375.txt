376 Yuelun’s Dissatisfaction

Zhuge Yueyue played with it for a while before returning it to him.

This was her teacher’s magic artifact. Even if her teacher wanted to give it to him, she could not accept it.

Moreover, her teacher had already given her the Cloud Sky sword. She could not have asked for more.

Ye Xuan took back the Cloud Heaven sword and put it back into his storage space with an indifferent expression. His calm appearance made Yuelun see him in a new light.

‘The rumors were rubbish! If I find out who called Cloud Sky peak’s chief a good-for-nothing, I’ll definitely give him a slap.’

!!

‘With this guy’s current strength and the addition of the Cloud Heaven sword, it won’t be long before he rises to prominence.’

“I’ve heard that Cloud Sky peak is full of talents and treasures. It seems that it’s true.”

“Junior Brother Ye, you have my congratulations on obtaining a divine-rank artifact.”

“With it, I’m afraid no one in the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect can compare to Junior Brother Ye.”

“I’m afraid Senior Sister will need Junior Brother Ye’s care in the future!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yuelun spoke with layers of hidden meaning and naturally threw a flirtatious look at him.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

“Senior Sister, you’re too humble. You’re so powerful that even Senior Brother Gongsun admires you. I’m the one who can’t compare to you.”

Yuelun’s mouth twitched when she saw this.

Did this guy really ignore her looks and beauty again? Could it be that this guy was not interested in women?

“My precious disciple, your good sister has come from far away to reminisce about the past with you. Please go and entertain her well.”

“As for cultivation, there’s no hurry. I’ll give you a day off today to catch up with her.”

Ye Xuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue as he spoke those words.

“Alright, Teacher,” Zhuge Yueyue nodded with respect.

“Xue’er, I’ll take you to tour the peak!”

At that moment, Li Xue’er was still in a daze. She only came back to her senses after Zhuge Yueyue pulled her out of the room.

Li Xue’er could not help but ask as soon as they left the courtyard.

“Yueyue, tell me the truth. Could it be that you already knew your teacher’s true capabilities, which was why you became his disciple?”

“No, I didn’t,” Zhuge Yueyue shook her head.

“Then why did you do it?”

Li Xue’er was full of doubts.

Why did Zhuge Yueyue still want to become Ye Xuan’s disciple even though she knew that he was useless?

Zhuge Yueyue took a deep breath and said with a serious expression.

“At that time in the meeting hall, I was one of the few no one selected, leaving me in despair. It was Teacher who appeared and rescued me at that moment.”

“Xue’er, you might not know how desperate I was at that time. You also don’t know how important Teacher is to me.”

“I’ve decided in my heart that no matter what happens in this life, I will never leave Teacher’s side. After all, I will use my whole life to repay Teacher’s kindness.”

“After I joined Cloud Sky peak, my teacher also found that my aptitude was mediocre. However, not only did he not despise me, he even took out a rare high-grade spiritual pill and completely changed my constitution!”

“Apart from that, my teacher didn’t hesitate to give me 10 years’ worth of his cultivation, and even gave me the Cloud Sky sword just now.”

“To be honest, I also feel like I’m in a dream. But fortunately, it’s all real. I’m lucky to have met the best teacher in the world!”

Li Xue’er’s eyes glowed with a strange light.

In addition to feeling happy for Zhuge Yueyue, she also felt an inexplicable sense of emptiness, and a faint tinge of jealousy.

Although Yuelun treated her well, she was on a completely different level compared to Ye Xuan.

Li Xue’er also had a strange thought in her heart. If Ye Xuan had chosen her and not Zhuge Yueyue, would she have not been the one to enjoy all this?

Just like that, Li Xue’er followed Zhuge Yueyue absent-mindedly and strolled around with mixed emotions.

Some time later, Yuelun realized that she could not tempt Ye Xuan at all, so he left with Li Xue’er helplessly.

Water Sky peak.

“Teacher, Little Junior Sister, you’re finally back!”

Water Sky peak was located at the intersection between a lake and the sky. The scenery was beautiful under the sunset.

Many female cultivators were playing with each other. When they saw Yuelun returning with Li Xue’er, they immediately bowed respectfully.

Normally, it was a common sight for the female cultivators of the Water Sky peak to play in the stream, and Yuelun had acquiesced to it previously.

However, after going to Cloud Sky peak, Yuelun’s opinion changed.

Especially when she recalled that Zhuge Yueyue had already reached the first level of the divine mystic realm. She felt a sense of pressure.

A disciple who had only entered the sect for a few days had already reached that level, then what about her own disciples?

Other than the few who had joined Water Sky peak a long time ago, the rest of the female cultivators did not have particularly high cultivation levels.

“Playing here again, how’s your cultivation?”

Yuelun looked at the female cultivators indifferently and spoke in a slightly serious tone.

When the eldest disciple Li Hanyi heard this, she could not help but be startled, her eyes filled with confusion.

This was part of the daily life of the female cultivators of Water Sky peak. Why was their teacher so angry today?

“Teacher, I’ve already completed my cultivation session,” Li Hanyi said nervously, feeling a little scared.

In the past, Yuelun had always been kind and had never been so serious.

Could it be that her teacher had suffered some kind of blow? Otherwise, why would she be in such a bad mood?

“You girls only know how to play every day. Have you ever thought about when the Seven Peaks competition will be held?”

“There are less than three months left. Why don’t you make the best use of your time to prepare and cultivate? Do you really think you can win the Seven Peaks competition this way?”

“Or do you think that you’re so talented that you can break through without cultivating?”

“You need to work on your discipline and cultivation. You’ve really brought shame to Water Sky peak!”

“In terms of cultivation and talent, Hua Rufeng is the strongest among the sect master’s disciples. There’s also Gao Tianyu from Hidden Sword peak. Yet look at you now, what are you doing with your time?”

“Even in the worst faction of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Cloud Sky peak, Zhuge Yueyue, who has only been in the sect for five days, has already reached the first level of the divine mystic realm!”

“Why are you girls still playing around? Don’t sully my reputation!”

The more Yuelun thought about it, the angrier she became.

In her own era, her performance could be said to be unparalleled, and her cultivation talent crushed her peers, which was why she could become one of the few female chiefs in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Yet her disciples were lacking!

Yuelun’s pride and self-confidence was high to begin with, so this situation was unacceptable.

“We were wrong. Please don’t be angry, Teacher. I’ll lead the junior sisters to cultivate now,” Li Hanyi said, feeling wronged.
