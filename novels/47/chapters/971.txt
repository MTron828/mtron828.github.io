He could no longer restrain his anger. No matter what, he was still a top genius, yet he was actually being looked down upon by others like this. How could he endure this?

“How arrogant! ”

After fiercely saying that, this disciple, Lin Yun, unleashed a saber beam that flew toward Gongsun Zhi.

A battle was about to break out, and the heavens and earth shook. Everyone focused on watching what would happen, wondering if they were about to witness an intense battle.

However, unexpectedly, Gongsun Zhi casually waved his fan, and a terrifying energy instantly pushed Lin Yun back.

Lin Yun fell to the ground with a mouthful of blood spurting out. He did not even have time to say a word before he fell unconscious.

“Oh my god… One-hit KO?”

Seeing this scene, everyone present was completely stunned.

No matter what, that disciple of the Heaven Continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect was also a genius at the peak of the supreme realm. Why did he seem so useless?

Everyone was extremely puzzled.

However, someone sighed and said, “There are huge differences even between cultivators of the same realm.’

“Even though they are at the same level, some of them have spent their entire lives reaching it, while others have reached this level without much effort.”

“There are also some people who are not in a hurry to break through. Instead, they patiently consolidate their foundations to perfection before they step into the next realm.”

“It is precisely because of this that even within the same realm, there can be a huge difference in strength.”

After hearing this person’s words, everyone understood.

Gongsun Zhi was known as the most outstanding genius disciple of the Immortal Divine sect. His potential was unquestionable.

Some people even heard that before he reached the supreme realm, he had consolidated his foundations at all of the previous realms.

The golden tiger obviously knew this, and had thus maintained a high degree of vigilance against Gongsun Zhi.

Gongsun Zhi looked at Lin Yun and sneered.

“Aren’t the mighty Great Wilderness Divine sect’s geniuses too weak?””

“Sigh… I originally thought that there was a peerless genius in the Great Wilderness Divine sect this time, but it turns out that I was mistaken.’ After hearing the mockery, the crowd started to discuss enthusiastically.

“Oh my god, aren’t his words too blatant? Is Gongsun Zhi declaring war on the

Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

“Why is he so confident?”

At this moment, they were very excited, as they felt that there would be a good show to watch. After all, even as outsiders, they could not stand to hear such mockery, much less the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

This was the truth. When the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect from the Heaven Continent heard this, they were so angry that they gritted their teeth.

“Damn it!”

“This b*stard actually dares to look down on our sect!”

“If their eldest senior brother was present, he would not dare to say such words. We must teach him that the Great Wilderness Divine sect is not to be trifled with!”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Damn it, I can’t take it anymore. Let’s fight!”

A disciple stepped forward and wanted to fight the arrogant Gongsun Zhi.

The other disciples could not hold it in anymore and said, “Senior Brother, you go first. Beat him until his mother can’t recognize him.”

Lin Tian, who had stepped forward, also felt a lot of pressure at this moment.

After all, the difference in strength between him and Lin Yun was not big. Since Gongsun Zhi could easily defeat Lin Yun, it was likely that he would face the same outcome.

However, he could not cower after the sect was insulted to that extent. Even if he knew that he would definitely lose, he would not retreat.

Otherwise, their sect’s reputation would suffer even more.

“B*stard Gongsun Zhi! Why don’t you show me what’s so amazing about your Immortal Divine sect!”

After saying this loudly, Lin Tian’s heart hardened, and he mobilized his full strength in preparation to attack Gongsun Zhi.

However, just as he was about to launch an attack, Gongsun Zhi looked over impatiently and said with a cold expression, “You? Can you just go away? Is there no one worthy in the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

“Why are all the small fries coming out to pester me? I don’t have that much energy to fool around with you. Get lost!”

After hearing this, the crowd was once again filled with surprised voices.

“My god, how arrogant is this kid?”

When he heard this blatant insult, Lin Tian’s face turned as black as coal. He gritted his teeth.

He was actually being looked down upon?

The other party did not even want to attack him at all?

“Damn it!”

The disciples of the Great Wilderness Sect were also gnashing their teeth at this moment. The anger in their hearts was indescribable.

‘lihis was the first time they had been so blatantly insulted.

“Damn it! This fellow is really too arrogant!”

“First Sister, let’s do it. Show how powerful we are!”

Even Feng Xiyun, who had always been gentle and refined, was so angry that she was gritting her teeth. Her face was also red.

This was really too humiliating. As a member of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, how could she endure it?

After hearing Feng Xiyun’s words, Zhuge Yueyue finally decided to act. Although she was not confident that she could beat Gongsun Zhi, she could not sit around and watch as the sect was insulted and humiliated like this.

She had no idea what her teacher was going through at the moment, but she had to settle the matter in front of him first.

After that, Zhuge Yueyue stared coldly at Gongsun Zhi, her eyes filled with killing intent.

Her long dress fluttered in the wind, and she released a terrifying aura that caused the hearts of the people nearby to tremble.

“Who is this?”

Those nearby were stunned.. Why were there so many powerful genius disciples appearing all of a sudden?
