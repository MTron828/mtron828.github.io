547 Divine Bone

It was heaven devouring divine sparrow’s divine bone!

When it appeared, everyone cast covetous gazes toward Ye Xuan.

After Ye Xuan examined the divine bone, he was a little dissatisfied.

“What’s going on? Why does this divine bone only increase speed?”

Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. He had thought that the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s divine bone would give him the devouring skill, but in the end, it only increased his speed.

Although the increase in speed was significant, it paled in comparison to the devouring skill.

‘Forget it. It’s still useful I guess. Maybe with the help of the system, I can obtain something more useful,’ Ye Xuan thought happily.

Now that he was already proficient in the Flora sword technique and Boundless Palm technique, the only thing he lacked was speed.

With the help of this divine bone, that issue would no longer exist.

Looking at the divine bone in his hand, Ye Xuan composed himself for a moment, then turned around and looked into Yanran’s eyes with sincerity.

Seeing this, Yanran’s heart trembled. What was this man up to this time? She subconsciously avoided his gaze.

In the next moment, Ye Xuan held her slender hand with a tender expression and handed the divine bone to her.

“Little Ran,” Ye Xuan said sincerely, “I’ll leave this divine bone with you.”

“Ah…”

Yanran was dumbfounded. She looked at the divine bone in her hand in disbelief, and then turned to look at Ye Xuan, who had a serious expression.

Her heart was touched.

Ye Xuan was actually giving her the divine bone without hesitation?

Did he really like her that much?

Her eyes met with Ye Xuan’s again, and then she lowered her head shyly.

Her heart was in turmoil. Had she truly fallen for him?

Even though Yanran’s mind was in a mess, her expression was still cold.

After coming back to her senses, she asked curiously, “Why are you giving me such a precious treasure?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled and said very sincerely, “To me, no treasure can compare to you!”

“Besides, isn’t it appropriate to give treasures to one’s girlfriend?”

At this very moment, Yanran once again became limp and weak, and she could hear her heart beating wildly.

“Then… Then I’ll accept it,” Yanran said in a soft voice and a red face. Then, she put away the divine bone.

With the help of the divine bone of the heaven devouring divine sparrow, even if she did not obtain the immortal heavenly treasure, she was 100% confident that she could break through to the advanced-stage of the supreme realm.

Yanran was already extremely touched by Ye Xuan’s act of giving her the divine bone.

After all, Ye Xuan could also become stronger if he used this divine bone, but he chose to give it to her instead.

When she heard Ye Xuan say that no treasure could compare to her, the ice in Yanran’s heart melted, and she wanted to jump into his arms immediately.

At this moment, she truly felt that he might be the one for her.

“Ah!”

Seeing that his goddess had already fallen in love with Ye Xuan, Ou Yunhai screamed inwardly. He watched with a depressed look on his face as the woman he loved was held in someone else’s arms.

“Damn it!”

After a while, Ou Yunhai cursed as he gritted his teeth. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In order to pursue Yanran, Ye Xuan had even given away such a precious divine bone. This was really too unbelievable.

Was this a reflection of his true feelings, or was he intentionally showing off?

“Heavens, did he really give that away without batting an eyelid? He’s something else alright!”

Mo Yunhai and the other cultivators were all shocked.

Those who had been here earlier were even more so, because they recalled that Ye Xuan had given Yanran the Torrential Pear Blossom needles not too long ago.

“This kid is really generous, so much so that it’s almost unsightly.”

The onlookers looked at Yanran with envy. After all, it was not easy to meet the right person.

In Yanran’s heart, it was as if she had just eaten honey, and her heart was filled with happiness.

She was even full of anticipation for her future. She felt like jumping into his arms, but knew that would be inappropriate given the situation.

In any case, there would be plenty of opportunities in the future, so there was no need to rush.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s heart was also pounding after hearing the system’s notification ring out in his mind.

“Ding! As you have given Yanran the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s divine bone, you have received a 10,000x critical reward!”

“Congratulations! You have obtained the divine bone of the fiery phoenix!”

Ye Xuan was very surprised, and could not wait to check out the property of the fiery phoenix’s divine bone. Would it also increase his speed, or something else entirely? In any case, it was on a whole other level compared to the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s divine bone!
