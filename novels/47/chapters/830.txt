831 Hidden Experts

Everyone’s mood brightened. If even Zhuge Yueyue could not deal with the golden-furred growler, then no one from the younger generation stood a chance.

The Reincarnation Fairy was also paying attention to the situation, and looked at Zhuge Yueyue with a complicated expression.

Even now, she still remembered the battle at the gathering, as it was Zhuge Yueyue who thwarted her chances at victory.

From then on, Zhuge Yueyue had become a roadblock in her cultivation path. She had already tried to request a rematch to regain her confidence, but because Zhuge Yueyue had been very busy recently, she could not find any time at all.

Now, seeing Zhuge Yueyue step up to fight again, her heart was filled with indescribable emotions. She was not the only one.

Mu Beichen was watching closely as well. Aside from the Reincarnation Fairy, the only other person he regarded as a competitor for the position of the East continent’s foremost genius was Zhuge Yueyue.

Of course, Xiang Yun would have been up there too, but that little girl was not really considered to be someone from their generation.

Many of the top experts were all secretly observing Zhuge Yueyue as well.

“This is really interesting. The top geniuses are finally starting to show their faces.”

“With this battle, we can take a good look at whether the East continent is worthy of our attention.”

These top experts were watching from afar and did not approach the battlefield.

After all, they knew that if they stepped into the territory of the East continent, Ye Xuan would instantly notice them. However, Ye Xuan already knew he was being watched. He just did not know by whom.

His spiritual sense swept out in an attempt to locate these people, but these people had gone to extra lengths to hide themselves, so his attempts were to no avail.

After realizing that, Ye Xuan could only stop and look coldly at the sky to warn them.

“This is interesting. He has already discovered our presence?”

After sensing Ye Xuan’s cold gaze, this expert tried to conceal his aura even more, and did not meet Ye Xuan’s gaze.

When she noticed that Ye Xuan’s expression was not right, Yuelun asked curiously, “Junior Brother Ye, what exactly happened?”

Ye Xuan waved his hand and said, “It’s not a big deal.”

Ye Xuan did not delve into it and did not tell Yuelun that he had sensed a strong enemy just now. In any case, these people did not seem like they would be making a move anytime soon.

Up in the sky, Zhuge Yueyue had arrived at the border between the two continents. She held the Cloud Sky Sword tightly in her hand, and stared at the golden-furred growler expressionlessly.

“Hahaha! It seems that I was correct. The East continent really doesn’t have any experts!”

Zhuge Yueyue simply replied, “I’ll teach you a lesson!”

“Besides, you’re not even worthy of my full power.”

After hearing this, the golden-furred growler was enraged. He bared his teeth and shouted, “You actually dared to say such shameless words?”

In the blink of an eye, the golden-furred growler released his aura, focusing it directly on Zhuge Yueyue.

He thought that he would easily be able to suppress her, but the only response he received was her cold aura being unleashed at the same time, which easily dispersed his aura.

“Damn it!”

The golden-furred growler was burning with rage. It unleashed all its strength and released bursts of fierce flames that flew toward Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue casually waved the Cloud Sky Sword, and terrifying sword beams immediately collided with the flame bursts the golden-furred growler released.

With a loud boom, both attacks canceled each other out, and cinders fell from the sky. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Oh my god.”

“This woman’s talent in the Sword Dao is truly astonishing.”

The onlookers from the Xuan continent exclaimed in shock.
