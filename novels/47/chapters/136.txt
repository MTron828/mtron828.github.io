Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Unfortunately, the effect of the Spirit Moon fruit decreased as one consumed more.

The first time one consumed would provide the largest cultivation boost. The second would provide half of the first, and the third would have basically no effect.

Huang Ling was the first to discover the Spirit Moon Tree. After learning of the great effects of the spirit moon fruit, she excitedly plucked a whole bunch of them.

Unfortunately, not long after, someone still set foot into the ruin, and discovered traces of Huang Ling’s presence there.

At that time, Huang Ling had not yet had the time to store away the spirit moon fruits. When those cultivators noticed the fruits, they immediately attacked her.

In the beginning, there were only some low-level cultivators, which Huang Ling could handle. However, not long after, two purple spirit realm cultivators arrived.

Huang Ling was terrified, but also felt somewhat lucky because those two purple spirit realm cultivators decided to fight each other for ownership of the tree and its fruits.

Seeing the tree slip out of their grasp, the low-level cultivators turned their attention to Huang Ling.

Although she could not compete with purple spirit realm experts, Huang Ling was stronger than the other cultivators present. She might have been able to fight off a small group of them, but there was a substantial group there, so she quickly fled.

In order to save her own life, Huang Ling decisively chose to throw out a few spirit moon fruits in order to disperse the crowd.

Unfortunately, this delaying tactic did not work.

After those cultivators obtained the fruits, they regrouped with the main group and chased Huang Ling again.

Then, pursued by these true essence realm cultivators, Huang Ling escaped for 40 kilometers.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s expression did not change.

He had long been used to such situations in the mystic realm.

However, he would not sit idly by this time. After all, Huang Ling was a cultivator of his Qingyun sect.

Most importantly, Huang Ling was also Elder Lin Qing’s disciple. When the Xuanyin sect had attacked the Qingyun sect, Elder Lin Qing had done her best to create a way for Ye Xuan to survive.

Besides, Huang Ling and Xue Min had stayed by his side for some time.

“Let’s go back!”

“Those fruits should have belonged to you. It’s time to return them to their original owner,” Ye Xuan said lightly.

“Okay!”

Hearing this, Huang Ling could not help but feel excited and nodded fiercely.

Moments later, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve and disappeared with Huang Ling.

…

40 kilometers away.

There was a small ruin in the mystic realm. The ruin was hidden within a dense forest. At the center, there was a Spirit Moon Tree that was dozens of meters tall!

Countless cultivators could be seen around the tree.

In order to fight for the spirit moon fruits that could improve one’s cultivation, countless cultivators fought fiercely, and powerful energy shockwaves spread out everywhere.

After Huang Ling left, many purple spirit realm cultivators arrived, and the fight between cultivators became even more intense.

Many true essence realm cultivators, in order to fight against the purple spirit realm cultivators, chose to band together and gang up on individual purple spirit realm cultivators.

The scene here could be said to be extremely chaotic! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Some of those low-level cultivators also tried to steal some spirit moon fruits while those experts were fighting each other!

Unfortunately, in the face of absolute strength, this was futile.

When those purple spirit realm experts saw this, they coldly smiled and casually killed them.

Right at this moment, two kilometers away from the chaotic battle, a middle-aged man was watching all of this with a cold expression, his eyes flickering with a strange light.

This was precisely the leader of the Mad Saber sect, who was at the early stage of the Xudan realm!

Ever since he entered the mystic realm, his luck had been poor, and he had not discovered any suitable heavenly treasures.

Then, his spiritual sense suddenly detected extremely violent energy fluctuations. He speculated that a cultivator had discovered a heavenly treasure, and then traced these energy fluctuations to search for it!

When he found out that the object everyone was fighting for were spirit moon fruits, he was slightly disappointed.

Then again, although the spirit moon fruit was useless to him, as the leader of the Mad Saber sect, he had to think for the Mad Saber sect, right?

There were at least 40 spirit moon fruits on the fruit tree. If he obtained all of them, then the Mad Saber sect’s strength would increase significantly.

However, after the previous experience with Ye Xuan, the Mad Saber sect master had become extremely cautious. He did not choose to attack directly, but chose to watch from a distance.

He wanted to confirm whether there would be other strong experts coming to snatch them.

He would only attack when he was sure that it was absolutely safe. At that time, he would take all of the spirit moon fruits and then leave as quickly as he could.

After observing for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the leader of the Mad Saber sect became basically certain that no other core formation realm cultivators would come over!

The leader of the Mad Saber sect then made his move and appeared on the battlefield.

Moments later, his surging core formation realm spiritual pressure swept out.

“These Spirit Moon fruits are fated with me!”

“You guys can get lost now!”

Even if these true essence and purple spirit realm cultivators joined forces, they would be no match for the leader of the Mad Saber sect.

“What? It’s actually a core formation realm expert!”

“Damn it! We’re doomed this time!”

Seeing this, everyone immediately stopped, and their facial expressions became extremely ugly.

They were very puzzled. Although the spirit moon fruit was rare, it was useless to a core formation realm expert. Why had one suddenly decided to make an appearance here?

Just as he was about to take the Spirit Moon tree away, his expression suddenly changed drastically. He suddenly sensed an extremely terrifying aura surging out.

“Almsgiver! This Spirit Moon tree is fated with our Buddhist sect!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a monk dressed in kasaya appeared. He held a bowl in his left hand while his right hand slowly twirled some Buddhist beads around.

The monk was as fast as lightning. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the leader of the Mad Saber sect!
