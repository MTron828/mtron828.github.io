561 Ye Xuan Returns

Yi Feng was also a supreme realm expert. Ever since Ao Lei had become the grand elder, Yi Feng had put aside secular matters and gone into long-term seclusion to cultivate.

Were it not for this crisis, he would not have revealed himself.

Li Dahai was also very surprised. He did not expect that Ao Lei would actually bring Yi Feng with him.

At that moment, several figures flew over from a distance. Over a hundred cultivators appeared in an instant.

They were all wearing the robes of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and were looking at the cultivators of the Immortal Divine sect with fierce expressions.

“Heavens! They actually have so many mystic lord realm experts?”

The onlookers were stunned. They had not expected the Great Wilderness Divine sect, which had always kept a low profile, to actually have hidden such a powerful force.

No sect would be able to withstand an assault from more than a hundred mystic lord realm experts.

At this moment, another figure emerged out of the blue. Seeing this, everyone was caught by surprise again.

“It’s actually Ao Lei. I can’t believe that he rushed here as well!”

At the sight of ore, all the people at the scene were shocked.

After all, they were all very clear about Ao Lei’s temper. He was once a ruthless person who had fought his way into another sect and emerged safely.

However, after taking up the position of grand elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he did not show his face much.

However, who would have thought that today’s battle would actually get him to show up.

At this very moment, Ao Lei arrived beside Gao Shun’s body with an ice-cold expression, using a technique to preserve his soul and safeguard his body properly.

After doing all this, the anger that had been suppressed for a long time finally erupted like a volcano.

“These people… Kill them all!”

After hearing this order, the cultivators who had just arrived launched attacks without hesitation, trying to destroy the Immortal Divine sect cultivators.

In any case, they had Yi Feng’s help, so they did not have to worry about anything else and could just focus on killing their enemies.

Upon seeing this, Mo Xuan Guan’s proud expression had long disappeared, and beads of cold sweat rolled down his face.

“Senior Xuan Guan, what should we do?”

Huang Daning asked with a serious expression. The reinforcements from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were here, but their own reinforcements had yet to arrive. If they did not arrive in time, it would be difficult for them to survive.

Mo Xuan Guan did not know what to do, so he could only seek Elder Taiyin’s assistance.

Elder Taiyin said arrogantly as he hovered in the air and swept his cold gaze across the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, “If you’re so eager to embrace death, then come at me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his supreme realm aura swept out, forcing most of the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect to take a step back..

At that moment, Yi Feng stood at the forefront and said with a calm expression, “Hehe, what’s the point of showing off in front of the younger generation? Let me play around with you instead.”

“Tsk! Yi Feng, if Tian Xuan was here today, I might be afraid, but you’re not anything special.”

Yi Feng was a middle-stage supreme realm expert, but Elder Taiyin was augmented by the strange power, so he did not take the former seriously.

Upon hearing this, Yi Feng’s face instantly darkened. Just as he was about to retort, another voice was heard.

“Hehe, I want to ask… are you afraid of me then?”

After hearing this, everyone present trembled in unison, as if their deepest fear had suddenly been realized.

Moments later, cold killing intent locked onto Elder Taiyin.

After hearing this voice, Yuelun, Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and the others immediately looked for the source of the voice. They saw a figure slowly stepping out of the ancient tomb. Who else could it be other than Ye Xuan?

“Teacher!”

Seeing that her teacher had finally appeared, Zhuge Yueyue, who had been holding herself back, could no longer restrain herself and burst into tears.

Who could understand how much pressure she had to bear just now to dare to step up?

At this moment, Feng Xiyun was not any better off. She hugged her senior sister and cried together with her.

After their teacher returned, they finally had someone to back them up.

“It’s you… Ye Xuan!”

When he heard Ye Xuan’s voice, Elder Taiyin’s body trembled subconsciously, and he stared at Ye Xuan with eyes full of hatred.

The humiliation he had suffered was because of Ye Xuan.

“You cowardly turtle, you finally dare to show your face?”

Elder Taiyin said with a furious expression. He wished he could kill Ye Xuan right here and now, and dismember his body into a thousand pieces.

When Ye Xuan’s figure shimmered and finally exited the ancient tomb, his killing intent was already on full display.

He had not expected that his carelessness would allow Elder Taiyin to survive and cause such a disastrous situation.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s anger could no longer be suppressed.

That being said, how did Elder Taiyin manage to survive the powerful might of the Cloud Heaven Sword? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After thinking about it, ye Xuan could only attribute it to that strange power.

Ye Xuan did not fully understand this strange power, so there had to be some special properties about it that managed to keep Elder Taiyin safe.

However, this kind of thing would not happen again!

Ye Xuan instantly flew over to Gao Shun’s corpse. After seeing that there was no longer any breath of life within it, his heart was filled with mixed feelings.

He had already noticed what was happening in the outside world while he was still in the tomb.

However, as he had encountered spatial turbulence, he had no way of rushing out, and could only watch as the tragedy unfolded.

Ye Xuan blamed himself for this, and he kept asking himself why he had not checked if Elder Taiyin was really dead.

...

Fortunately, Ao Lei’s timely arrival had managed to preserve Gao Shun’s soul. Perhaps there was a possibility of saving him in the future.

When Ye Xuan turned his gaze back to Elder Taiyin, his monstrous killing intent erupted.
