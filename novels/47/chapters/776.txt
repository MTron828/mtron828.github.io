777 Monster Gathering (Part 1)

The Jade Lake Divine sect had not been attacked by the berserk beasts yet, which was likely due to its location. From the desert region, the berserk beasts had to pass through the territories of the Supreme Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sect before reaching the Jade Lake Divine sect’s territory.

As such, for the time being, things remained peaceful there.

At this moment, there were already two empires that were on the verge of collapse. Only the Yangli Divine empire was still persevering amidst the flames of war.

Initially, the Yangli Divine empire was on the verge of collapsing. However, after the sudden death of the emperor, Feng Tianyi took the throne, and the situation almost instantly changed.

Within the Yangli Divine empire, almost all the factions joined forces to resist the attack of the berserk beasts before finally stabilizing the situation.

This inadvertently confirmed what Ye Xuan had speculated before. Feng Tianyi was indeed blessed with endless luck. Even if Ye Xuan himself had taken the reins of emperor, it would have been difficult to achieve the same result.

In Feng Tianyi’s hands, the Yangli Divine empire might really be able to rise up and become the most powerful empire in the East continent. However, before that, they had to survive this disaster.

Over the past few days, the East continent had undergone tremendous changes. An somber atmosphere hung over the survivors. Countless people had already lost their lives within such a short span of time. It was truly a catastrophe. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

At this moment, Mengyu was observing this whole situation play out from a temple that was filled with an ancient aura. There was no sympathy in her gaze as she watched countless people being slaughtered. She even smiled from time to time.

“Haha, how interesting! Is the East continent the reason why you are willing to draw your sword against me?”

If DaoistYi Feng had not risked his life to stop her from sacrificing the inhabitants of the East continent, these people might not have died so painfully at the hands of the berserk beasts. Their deaths would have been swifter and far more painless if she had succeeded back then.

Frankly speaking, she did not care about all the inhabitants of the East continent at all. The only thing she cared about was that person from the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Now that they shared the same bloodline, they could sense each other and were considered a perfect pair.

However, there was an insurmountable gap between the two of them that could not be smoothed over by time.

Even though she had lied to Daoist Yi Feng back then, she had never thought of taking his life. She only wanted to borrow his immortal bones to reach the sealed immortal realm.

Once she did, then the two of them could dual cultivate and live forever.

However, Daoist Yi Feng would not just watch as everyone in the East continent lost their lives for no reason.

Moreover, using this method to reach the sealed immortal realm was not the Dao path he cultivated.

At this moment, Mengyu could see almost every massacre that was taking place in the East continent. She simply watched quietly.

She was not in a hurry to make a move, and wanted to see how the Great Wilderness Divine sect planned to protect the East continent from the dangers of this disaster.

At this moment, the thick black fog had already wreaked havoc on the East continent, and some places had been completely contaminated by it, becoming desolate and devoid of life.

In a temple that was filled with the aura of death, seven strange monsters were gathered. Each of them was wearing a loose-fitting battle robe.

The atmosphere here was particularly solemn. In the strange world, these seven could be considered supreme existences.

After a moment of silence, one of the strange monsters stood up and looked at the other six monsters before saying, “What a joke that the South Heavenly King, who has been undefeated since ancient time, actually lost his life in a low-level world. How embarrassing!”

Hearing this, the other strange monsters lowered their heads and pondered. After a moment, one said, “Before the South Heavenly King died, I was able to sense his emotions. He was hopeless and helpless.”

“A divine sword pierced his heart. Even his soul was shattered. He died a horrible death.”

“It’s really unexpected that in this low-level world there’s an expert who is capable of killing the South Heavenly King.”

“So what?”

Another strange monster roared angrily and said with a fierce expression, “I don’t care who this person is. Since he dared to kill one of our own, he must die!”

Then, another strange monster spoke.

“The South Heavenly King always thought that he was invincible, so him being the first to fall makes sense.”

“But what I really don’t understand is that no matter how much the South Heavenly King underestimated his enemy, he shouldn’t have died so miserably.”

“Who is the person who killed the South Heavenly King? What powerful techniques does he possess?”

Hearing this, the leader of the strange monsters spoke.

“The black fog has already begun to spread in this world. Originally, we would have completely controlled this world within a few days, but unexpectedly, an expert actually appeared. Now things might be a little difficult.”

“Under the leadership of this expert, the human cultivators who were originally fighting for themselves will gather together and resist us.”

“This has already begun. The teams we sent out haven’t been able to obtain any results. If this continues, we will soon be at a disadvantage.”

The other strange monsters immediately thought of Sky Mountain.

With a wave of the leader’s hand, an image projection of the map of the East continent appeared in the hall.

A strange monster walked over to the projection and then pointed at a mountain peak in the middle of the East continent.

“This is Sky Mountain, and it is at the core of our problems.”

The strange monsters stared at the majestic mountain range as they fell into a state of deep thought
