Ye Xuan also heard what the old Daoist Gu Hao said, and thought to himself, ‘This guy really is a sore loser. Did he really think that Xie Tianyu could defeat Zhuge Yueyue?’

Ye Xuan no longer hesitated and walked over to Daoist Gu Hao.

“Daoist Gu Hao, you seem to be very confident in Xie Tianyu…”

Hearing this, Daoist Gu Hao instantly glared at him and replied, “Of course! As the representative of the Supreme Divine sect, he’s naturally a peerless genius!”

!!

“Moreover, his reputation was obtained through his own strength and battles, and not from having a strong teacher.”

After hearing these words, the surroundings instantly fell silent.

Zhuge Yueyue’s gaze also turned cold. Ye Xuan frowned, but then chuckled.

“Hehe, Yueyue, did you hear that clearly? This old man said that your fame was obtained by relying on my status.”

“If you meet that disciple of the Supreme Divine sect later, remember to give him a good beating and see if he lives up to his claim of strength.”

Zhuge Yueyue clutched the Cloud Sky Sword tightly and looked in Xie Tianyu’s direction. Her lips curled into a smile as she replied, “Alright, Teacher, I understand. I’ll teach him a good lesson.”

After hearing this, Daoist Gu Hao laughed and said, “”Hmph, Tianyu, did you hear that clearly?”

“Grandmaster, I understand. I’ll prove my own strength!”

Xie Tianyu raised his head high. He had made ample preparations this time, so how could he lose to her again?

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Xie Tianyu with disdain and said, “Scrub, you already lost to me last time…”

“I dare you to say that again!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xie Tianyu’s anger erupted. He could still clearly remember his loss to her, and it had become a talking point among the cultivation community.

Zhuge Yueyue continued, You’re not worth my time. Once a loser, always a loser!”

“Arrogant!”

With Xie Tianyu’s bad temper, he could not hold it in any longer. He was ready to attack at any moment.

However, when he glanced in Ye Xuan’s direction, he instantly changed his mind.

Daoist Gu Hao patted his shoulder and consoled him, “Tianyu, don’t be too anxious. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to fight her when you enter.”

After the others saw what was going on, they instantly started discussing.

“Haha, this is really interesting. It seems that the Supreme Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sects’ disciples are going to continue their feud during the gathering.”

“Will the Supreme Divine sect be able to redeem their pride? If their disciples lose as well, then their reputation will truly be in tatters.”

Everyone was looking forward to seeing how things would turn out.

Xie Tianyu had already lost to Zhuge Yueyue a while ago, so the former would definitely be gunning for victory this time.

It was really hard to say who would win and who would lose.

“Hehe, you’re quite arrogant, young man. I hope you won’t be crushed like a fly later.”

Gao Shun also came over to poke the hornets’ nest. There was another good show to watch.

Seeing this, Daoist Black Iron could not stand it anymore and said while looking at Gao Shun fiercely, “Gao Shun, don’t be so arrogant. Just you wait and see! We’ll deal with the disciples of Hidden Sword peak first!”

“That’s fine. If you have the ability, then come at us.”

Gao Shun looked fearless. After all, his disciples were here for the experience, so they would experience more if they were forced to keep an eye out for the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples.

“Son, you must take good care of the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples later. Feel free to teach them a good lesson in humility.”

“Father, leave this matter to me. I’ll definitely do it well.”

“Hehe, the conflict is quite intense.”

At this moment, Ao Lei also slowly walked forward, and Hua Rufeng followed closely behind. The corners of his mouth curved into a smile as he looked at the Supreme Divine sect’s cultivators…
