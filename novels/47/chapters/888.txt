889 Feng Xiyun Arrives

“You’re really arrogant.”

“Where did this kitten come from? It actually dared to come here and act so presumptuously.”

At this moment, a fiery figure appeared in the sky. Her face was filled with a brilliant smile, and she did not look flustered at all.

After seeing who it was, the crowd went into an uproar.

“Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect actually sent someone here. Isn’t she the second disciple of Cloud Sky peak, Feng Xiyun?”

Everyone was shocked. They had all assumed that the Great Wilderness Divine sect would not show up here, so they were taken aback by a sudden appearance. Furthermore, Feng Xiyun was Ye Xuan’s disciple, which meant that Ye Xuan would be somewhere nearby.

After all, Ye Xuan was famous for taking good care of his disciples.

At this moment, everyone was filled with confidence again.

The lightning tiger looked at Feng Xiyun with a serious expression.

However, she had actually dared to call it a kitten, which was a blatant insult, and not something that it could stomach.

The lightning tiger roared furiously, “Who exactly are you? How dare you insult me like this. It seems that you’ve signed your death warrant!”

In the blink of an eye, the lightning tiger launched an attack toward Feng Xiyun.

Seeing this scene, the corners of Feng Xiyun’s mouth curled up slightly. Perhaps the old her might be afraid of such a fierce attack, but not anymore.

Chuckling, she gently stretched out her hand and pushed forward, instantly causing the wind and clouds in the sky to surge. Then, flames manifested from her hand, which collided with the incoming attack and destroyed it.

Her counterattack even charred the front paw of the lightning tiger that had unleashed the attack, and the flames showed no signs of abating.

“Heavens!”

“Is this for real?”

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically, and the golden tiger even took a step back. After all, it was very clear about the lightning tiger’s strength.

Anyone who could easily deal with the lightning tiger could also easily deal with it.

F*ck!

Where did this girl come from?

“It’s actually the Heaven Burning Flames!”

“This…”

After hearing this, waves of exclamations instantly sounded from the scene. Were those the flames that only existed in ancient books? The same ones that could burn anything and everything?

This revelation startled the experts who were observing the situation from the other continents.

How had she mastered an immortal-grade cultivation technique at her age?

“Damn it!”

At this moment, the lightning roared. The flames that engulfed its paw looked unsightly, and it endured the pain as it cut off the charred part of its paw.

If it had not done so, the flames would have eventually spread to the rest of its body. It had never been humiliated like this!

“Who exactly are you? Report your name and affiliation!”

No matter how much it wracked its brains, he could not understand how such a peerless genius had appeared in the East continent. That single attack had already damaged his confidence.

Hovering in the air, the corners of Feng Xiyun’s mouth curled up slightly. At this moment, another voice rang out.

“Haha…”

“Her background is so special that it’ll give you a huge fright.”

Lu Xiu had now arrived with the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“She is Feng Xiyun, the second disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak, and the disciple of Ye Xuan, our sect’s sealed immortal realm expert.”

“This…”

After hearing this, the forces of the other continents that were observing the situation all turned serious.

They were already familiar with Ye Xuan’s name thanks to that battle with Mengyu. Now, they had come face-to-face with his second disciple, who had easily dealt with the lightning tiger’s attack, and even injured it.

Gulp!

“Heavens! Ye Xuan’s disciple really lives up to his reputation. I can’t believe that his disciples are so powerful as well. Is he really that good at everything?”

Some of the geniuses from the other continents felt very lucky at this moment. Fortunately, they did not act impulsively just now like the lightning tiger.

Otherwise, not even their sects would be able to protect them from the fury of a sealed immortal realm expert.

After learning who Feng Xiyun was, the lightning tiger’s expression was also filled with gloom.

‘She’s actually the disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert!’

However, its heart was already burning with rage. It was an exalted supreme realm expert with a noble bloodline. How could it lose to anyone else? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hmph! Show me how strong a disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert is. Or are you all talk?”

The arrogance in its heart would not allow itself to be defeated by anyone!
