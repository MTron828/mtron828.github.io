When Gao Shun saw Ye Xuan was targeting his only son, he immediately panicked.

“Junior Brother Ye, such accusations require evidence. Even if our two peaks have always had some conflicts, there’s no need to frame us.”

“Hehe! Does Senior Brother Gao really want the evidence?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan sneered.

“If I really find evidence, as the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Senior Brother Gao should act impartially, right?”

Gao Shun instantly broke out in cold sweat, and he threw a pleading look at Gongsun Shouyue.

Seeing this, Gongsun Shouyue shook his head, feeling a little disappointed.

It was unexpected that the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, an expert who had been in charge of Hidden Sword peak for hundreds of years, would be toyed with by a young man.

However, Ye Xuan had also gained Gongsun Shouyue’s admiration.

As for Gao Tianyu’s matter, how could Gongsun Shouyue not know?

However, because the other party was Gao Shun’s only son, he chose to turn a blind eye.

After all, in this world where the strong preyed on the weak, those mortals without any cultivation talent were nothing more than ants in their eyes.

Gongsun Shouyue looked at the clouds in the sky, then at Ye Xuan.

“Junior Brother Ye, I can see that Cloud Sky peak’s spiritual energy is extremely abundant. There’s a spiritual vein on this mountain, right?”

“It’s no wonder Martial Uncle Tian Xuan has been staying on Cloud Sky peak all this time.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan took a deep look at the latter.

He naturally knew that Gongsun Shouyue was deliberately changing the topic to suppress the Gao Tianyu incident.

However, Ye Xuan did not go too far.

After all, completely falling out with Gao Shun was not a good thing.

Gao Shun was a mystic lord realm cultivator, and Ye Xuan was not his match just yet.

In any case, it was not like Gao Tianyu’s crimes had disappeared. He could find evidence against him at any time.

“Senior Brother Gongsun’s eyes are really sharp. You’ve discovered the mystery of our Cloud Sky peak. I’m really impressed!”

Ye Xuan smiled and let it slide.

Hearing this, Gongsun Shouyue displayed a satisfied expression, and then said with a smile, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. I came here with Junior Brother Gao for the Seven Peaks competition that’s going to be held soon.”

“Will Junior Brother Ye’s Cloud Sky peak be participating?”

The Seven Peaks competition was the biggest event organized by the Great Wilderness Divine sect, so it was naturally important.

From Ye Xuan’s memory, Cloud Sky peak had not participated in the competition. Tian Xuan himself had always been a loner, and had no disciples before Ye Xuan. Ye Xuan himself had not bothered with the competition this entire time as well.

However, now that he had a disciple, and the system had awakened, it was a good chance to show off, and also earn some possible benefits.

“Of course. Since Senior Brother Gongsun has come to invite us personally, Cloud Sky peak will definitely participate.”

When Gao Shun heard that, he displayed a disdainful smile.

Among the seven peaks of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Cloud Sky peak had the least people. The other peaks had countless disciples. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Furthermore, those who were qualified to participate in the Seven Peaks competition were all peerless geniuses who had been selected through many rounds on their own peaks. Each and every one was quite powerful.

Because of this, the Seven Peaks competition was also known as the trial of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s geniuses.

Even if Zhuge Yueyue was talented, she was just a disciple who had just entered the sect. Among the many peerless geniuses, she was just an ordinary person. What kind of ranking could she obtain?

The weakest competition participant in the past had been a divine mystic realm cultivator.

Some of the more talented cultivators had even broken through to the materialization realm!

Zhuge Yueyue was merely a fourth-level mystic meridian realm cultivator. There was no way she would end up anywhere but at the bottom of the heap.

‘Hmph! Since you dared to participate in the Seven Peaks competition, then don’t blame me for targeting you!’

Gao Shun smiled coldly, already looking forward to seeing their defeated expressions.

Furthermore, he was going to use his position as the law enforcement elder to make some arrangements to have Zhuge Yueyue eliminated in the first round.

At that time, he would be able to mock Ye Xuan mercilessly.

Ye Xuan saw the change in Gao Shun’s expression, and said meaningfully, “Seeing Senior Brother Gao’s expression, could it be that you think that Cloud Sky peak’s participation will end badly?”

“Since that’s the case, why don’t you and I make a bet?”

“What sort of bet?”

When Gao Shun heard that, he was immediately interested.

Zhuge Yueyue’s loss was already set in stone. Now that this fellow had chosen to dig his own grave, he would naturally not miss this opportunity.

“It’s very simple. Let’s see which of our disciples gets a better ranking.”

“Whoever wins will receive a top-grade earth-rank magic artifact.”

“What do you think, Senior Brother Gao? We can have Senior Brother Gongsun bear witness to this.”

When Gao Shun heard that, he was inwardly overjoyed.

Was this guy’s brain damaged?

In case Ye Xuan suddenly went back on his word, Gao Shun agreed without hesitation.

“Since Junior Brother Ye has suggested it, how can I refuse?”

“Senior Brother Gongsun, please bear witness to this to prevent anyone from going back on their word.”

Gao Shun chuckled as he looked at Gongsun Shouyue.
