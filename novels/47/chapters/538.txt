539 Couple? Eh?

Yanran’s mind was in a mess. Ye Xuan came from the East continent, so should he not be very poor?

Why did he have so many amazing magic artifacts?

Sensing her gaze, Ye Xuan said, “Junior Sister, if you really like these Torrential Pear Blossom needles, then I’ll give them to you.”

Hearing this, Yanran was stunned.

Why was Ye Xuan offering to give them to her?

Was there some other meaning behind this?

Thinking this, Yanran’s face instantly turned red and she immediately dispelled this idea. She had to be overthinking things.

After looking at the needles with reluctance, Yanran did not agree to accept it.

Although she really wanted to own them, she did not want to owe someone a favor for no reason. Moreover, despite being from the same original sect, they were from different continents. No matter how close their relationship was, it would fade over time.

How could she accept such a precious treasure from Ye Xuan?

“Eh? Don’t you like these needles? Why do you not want them now?”

Ye Xuan asked with a smile. It was as clear as day that she liked them, so why was she refusing his offer?

It truly was difficult to understand what she was thinking.

The needles were not important to Ye Xuan. In fact, he had only decided to use them this time around to spite the white-browed old man. Otherwise, he would not have bothered taking them out.

Since there was someone who liked them, there was no reason to hold on to them.

Yanran looked at the seven needles with great interest. If she had this treasure, she would be able to protect herself better in the future.

However, she really could not accept such a valuable thing from him.

“About this…”

After hesitating for a while, Yanran still waved her hand and replied, “I don’t want to owe anyone anything, and we’re not a couple. Therefore, I won’t accept such a precious treasure from you.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan rubbed his head and said, “So that was what you were worried about.”

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan looked at Yanran’s face with sincerity and said gently, “Why don’t we become a couple then?”

After hearing this, Yanran and Ye Xuan looked at each other again, and her heart thumped wildly. She actually felt happy?

Was he… expressing his feelings to her?

What was going on?

What should she do now?

‘This is definitely fake. I’ve only met him a short while ago. How could I let him walk into my heart so easily?’

‘Or perhaps, this is love at first sight?’

Yanran felt very confused. In the past, if someone dared to talk to her like this, she would have sent him flying with a slap.

‘This feeling is terrible. I can’t even say no. Why is that? Ah!’

Part of her wanted to reject Ye Xuan’s proposal, but the other part kept urging her to agree. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After thinking for a long time, Yanran finally turned her eyes back to Ye Xuan and said after a long while, “Um… We’ve only known each other for a short while, so wouldn’t it be bad to confirm our relationship so quickly?”

“My teacher once told me that a relationship is about getting to know each other, falling in love, and then confirming the relationship. Isn’t this too soon?”

Yanran said all this with an innocent face. These were all things that her teacher, Daoist Sun, had told her before. After all, she did not know much about worldly affairs.

However, since her teacher had told her this, she believed it to be the truth.

After Ye Xuan heard this, he was stunned. This little girl was really as pure as a piece of white paper.

After pretending to think for a while, Ye Xuan said seriously, “What you said is actually quite right. After all, how can a relationship between a couple be so urgent?”

Hearing this, Yanran felt a little happy. Ye Xuan did not seem to be a big pervert. Perhaps he truly was being sincere.

At this moment, Ye Xuan said hesitantly, “Do you think this will work? Let’s get together first, and then see if we’re suitable for each other over a period of time.”

If you think it’s okay, I’ll be your boyfriend for real.”

“Eh??”

Yanran was a little dumbfounded at this time and did not understand what Ye Xuan meant by these words.

“Isn’t that simple? I’m just going to be your nominal boyfriend first, but our relationship will remain as friends.”

“Then, I’ll slowly get to know you and fall in love with you in this kind of relationship, step by step. Is that okay?”

“I won’t do anything to you during this period of time. If you think I’m not suitable for you, then we can end our relationship.”
