Chapter 279: The Empress’ Excuses

“The master of Luo Heaven Palace?”

Jun Lingtian looked at Shangguan Wan’er warily.

He recognized her after thinking about it for a while.

“It seems you know me,” Shangguan Wan’er replied indifferently. She did not look at Jun Lingtian, but instead continued to scan the surroundings for Ye Xuan’s aura.

In the Nanzhou Region, this person’s strength was not bad.

Were it not for Ye Xuan, this guy would probably be the most powerful person in the Nanzhou Region.

Five-pattern condensation realm expert!

This was Jun Lingtian’s strength.

However, he had never revealed his full strength in front of others.

He had been waiting at the Qingyun sect for a long time just to give Ye Xuan the ancestor’s jade token.

Why had the most powerful person in the Miaoling Region suddenly come here?

“You are the master of the Luo Heaven Palace, and the most powerful person in the Miaoling Region. How could I not recognize you?”

Jun Lingtian smiled politely. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Shangguan Wan’er’s talent was also extremely monstrous. It had only taken her a few decades to establish the Luo Heaven Palace by herself.

Such talent was worthy of being called a peerless monster, even in the Huangyu Zone.

Previously, the Divine Gate Holy Land had tried to recruit her, but they were rejected.

Although Shangguan Wan’er heard Jun Lingtian’s words, she could not be bothered to respond to him.

Jun Lingtian could not help but reveal an awkward expression.

It was rumored that the master of the Luo Heaven Palace had a cold temperament, and few people could talk to her.

In addition, there was a saying in the Huangyu Zone among cultivators that it was best not to be arrogant and provoke Shangguan Wan’er, or the consequences would be very bad.

This saying had been proven right by a number of scions from the aristocratic families who had tried to pursue Shangguan Wan’er.

Many of them were now either dead or injured, depending on how badly they had messed up.

Jun Lingtian was naturally aware of this, so he immediately kept quiet.

He did not know Shangguan Wan’er’s exact strength, but he definitely did not want to provoke the most powerful person in the Miaoling Region.

“Do you know where Ye Xuan is?”

After a long time, Shangguan Wan’er finally turned her head to look at Jun Lingtian.

Jun Lingtian narrowed his eyes.

As expected!

This woman had indeed come for Ye Xuan.

However, how did Ye Xuan get to know Shangguan Wan’er?

“I still have unfinished business with him, and I need to see him in person,” Shangguan Wan’er continued indifferently.

There was no way she was going to tell Jun Lingtian that she was here to acknowledge Ye Xuan as her teacher.

Besides, she had personally come to the Nanzhou Region to teach Ye Xuan a lesson. If Ye Xuan could not give her a reasonable explanation as to why he ignored her, she would personally let him know why flowers were so red.

“I see!”

Jun Lingtian did not question Shangguan Wan’er’s words.

As long as there was no enmity between the two, it was not a big deal to reveal Ye Xuan’s whereabouts.

“He’s currently in secluded cultivation in the Qingyun sect,” Jun Lingtian said.

“Secluded cultivation?” Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes flickered.

“Do you know how long he has been in seclusion?”

“It should be around half a year!”

“Half a year?”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s dissatisfaction with Ye Xuan dissipated significantly.

‘Ah, so that’s how it was. That guy didn’t deliberately ignore her. He was cultivating in seclusion this entire time.’

‘It seems that I have misunderstood.’

‘I hope he doesn’t take offense to the fact that I traveled all the way here.’

When she thought of this, the anger in Shangguan Wan’er’s heart disappeared, and she even felt a little happy.

The moment this thought appeared, Shangguan Wan’er jumped up in shock.

‘What was going on? How could I think like that?’

‘No matter what, it’s all this guy’s fault. He was the one who told me to crush the jade token once I thought it through. It’s all this guy’s fault that my imagination ran wild while he was in seclusion.’

‘No matter what, he has to give me a reasonable explanation.’

‘Otherwise, I will never acknowledge him as my teacher.’

Shangguan Wan’er would naturally not admit to the thoughts in the depths of her heart.

“If that’s the case, then I’ll wait for him at the Qingyun sect!”

Shangguan Wan’er made her decision.

Moments later, Shangguan Wan’er stretched out her hand and tore space apart and entered the spatial turbulence.

Although she said she would wait, she did not want to be seen waiting.

What if people thought that she was here to find a partner?

Jun Lingtian also found a mountain peak near the Qingyun sect and began to cultivate.

Rip!

When Shangguan Wan’er tore space apart and entered spatial turbulence around the Qingyun sect, she suddenly saw the Tower of Heaven floating there.

“So this guy was hiding here!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er realized why she could not detect Ye Xuan’s aura. It was because he was hiding in the spatial turbulence.

“Since you’re in seclusion, I’ll wait for you to come out!”

Shangguan Wan’er looked at the Tower of Heaven with a hint of envy in her eyes.

After that, Shangguan Wan’er sat cross-legged to cultivate and comprehend slaughter intent, which she had been focused on for the past six months.

Shangguan Wan’er’s comprehension value was 798 points, and with her previous experience of comprehending other martial intents, she had already comprehended first-level slaughter intent.

However, it was only up to there.

After all, the higher the level, the greater the difficulty.

Furthermore, because she was occupied with Ye Xuan’s matter, Shangguan Wan’er’s slaughter intent had not made any progress after her initial breakthrough.

If she wanted to break through to higher levels, she needed spiritual items that would allow her to experience an epiphany.
