645 Prelude (Part 1)

After hearing Feng Xiyun’s question, Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “Don’t ask too much about the matters between adults, little girl.”

Feng Xiyun felt very aggrieved at this moment. Why did her Teacher always call her little girl? She was already an adult!

After Yuelun left, Gao Shun also felt very uncomfortable, and wanted to avoid seeing Ye Xuan show off again. Therefore, he hurriedly said, “Junior Brother Ye, the gathering will be starting soon, so I’ll take my disciples and set off first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately left with the others.

Ye Xuan was not in a hurry to see this. If he really wanted to rush over, he could definitely arrive before them easily.

After everyone had left, Ye Xuan turned to look at Zhuge Yueyue and said, “Did you notice?”

“I sensed it,” Zhuge Yueyue replied, “Those disciples have more or less improved.”

“Especially Gao Tianyu, who seems to have broken through to the middle-stage of the void realm. It seems that Hidden Sword peak has gone all out.”

Earlier on, Zhuge Yueyue had been checking the cultivation of this group of disciples. That was why she had not said a word.

As the eldest disciple of Hidden Sword peak, Gao Tianyu was their best representative in terms of combat strength. Moreover, he was Gao Shun’s only child, so he definitely would not be lacking in terms of cultivation resources.

“Also, Li Hanyi seems to have also broken through to the middle-stage of the void realm, and is even stronger than Xiyun,” Zhuge Yueyue continued.

Feng Xiyun had started cultivating much later than the others, so it was already considered very good that her cultivation level had been able to reach this stage.

Thanks to Cloud Sky peak’s abundance of resources, and the assistance of the water cloud fruit tree, her cultivation speed had increased greatly.

Feng Xiyun was holding Xiang Yun’s small hand, but her mind was deep in thought. After a moment, she said, “In our sect, only Senior Brother Hua Rufeng can compete with Senior Sister Yueyue. The others aren’t her match.”

“Furthermore, I believe that she will reach the heaven realm sooner or later.”

“The only thing we don’t know now is how many peak-void realm geniuses there will be at this gathering.”

After saying that, Feng Xiyun furrowed her brows. She looked very worried.

The East continent was vast, and there were many geniuses. Some geniuses did not show themselves because they did not want to be in the limelight. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The only people they knew were Mu Beichen, the reincarnation fairy, Xie Tianyu, and Xu Changqing.

The combat strength of these geniuses was also very outstanding. In terms of cultivation resources and their talent, they were not weak at all.

If Zhuge Yueyue could break through to the peak of the void realm, then these people with amazing talents would definitely be able to do it easily. Perhaps a supremely talented genius might have even reached the heaven realm.

It was for this reason that it was very difficult to get a good ranking in this gathering. Unlike Chief Tian Xuan, who steamrolled the opposition with an unstoppable momentum, Zhuge Yueyue did not have such strength.

If she wanted to emerge victorious among the many geniuses, it would not be easy.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s gaze was on Zhuge Yueyue as he asked, “Yueyue, how confident are you?”

Zhuge Yueyue clenched her fists tightly and replied with confidence, “Teacher, don’t worry. I can definitely win!”

“Then I can rest assured.”

Ye Xuan smiled, then looked at Xiang Yun and said, “Yun’er, when we arrive at the gathering venue, you can play all you want. Don’t be afraid of any consequences.”

“Even if the sky falls, your teacher will hold it up for you. If you don’t like any brat, then go ahead and beat them up.”

“Help your senior sister. Clean up the small stones on her path and help her emerge victorious. How about it?”

Xiang Yun jumped up in excitement after hearing that. She held her hammer tightly and said confidently, “Alright, leave it to me. I’m going to beat up this group of stinky brats and protect Senior Sister!”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun had a deep understanding of this little girl’s terrifying strength, and were secretly worried for the others.

If these people were to be beaten by their little junior sister, how would he explain himself? Even if they were not defeated, their self-confidence and reputation would take a heavy blow.

After all, being defeated by a six-year-old girl was something that they would be unlikely to live down.

At this time, the Divine Seal peak in the East continent was already packed with people. There were even many vendors setting up stalls here, making it look very prosperous.

This place was the venue of the gathering, and it was rumored that it was the highest peak when the world was created.

At the top of the mountain, there was a square with no end in sight, and there were many lifelike stone sculptures…
