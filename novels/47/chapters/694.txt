695 Intense Duel

“A hundred years have passed in the blink of an eye. Back then, Chief Tian Xuan used the Cloud Sky Sword to defeat Daoist Canghai, who used the Xuanming Sword.”

“Today, that great battle will be revisited, but with different wielders. This time, will the Cloud Sky Sword win, or will the Xuanming Sword win?”

At this moment, there was a heated discussion.

In terms of grade, the Cloud Sky Sword was not as powerful as the Xuanming Sword. The reason why Chief Tian Xuan defeated Daoist Canghai was because of his incredible Sword Dao and cultivation level.

!!

Now, it was Zhuge Yueyue’s turn to wield the Cloud Sky Sword. Could she maintain the Cloud Sky Sword’s former glory?

Zhuge Yueyue stared at the Xuanming Sword in Mu Beichen’s hand, and her expression turned unprecedentedly serious.

Mu Beichen was the same. He immediately began to mobilize his sword aura, trying to suppress her.

However, neither side backed down.

Everyone’s eyes were glued to the screen, wanting to witness this momentous Sword Dao duel.

“Their sword aura is suffocating.”

“It looks like those two are the biggest obstacles to our victory.”

Rather than Xiang Yun, the participants felt that these two were the biggest threat.

Mu Beichen was the strongest expert Zhuge Yueyue had encountered so far, and had been cultivating for a much longer time.

As their sword auras grew stronger and stronger, dark clouds gathered in the sky. Moments later, a bolt of lightning flashed, and they moved.

“It has officially begun”

Everyone’s mood was stirred up as they stared at this scene without blinking.

Bang!

The two swords collided, and sparks instantly flew.

Zhuge Yueyue had already activated her Nine Serenities of Frost technique, which greatly strengthened her sword aura.

Even so, Mu Beichen was still not suppressed. He relied on his powerful aura to match hers.

He waved the Xuanming Sword around casually, and the sky seemed to darken. Zhuge Yueyue also unleashed a sword strike, and neither side seemed to have the advantage.

The two of them fought fiercely, and it was impossible to predict the outcome. The onlookers felt their hearts palpitating from the hair-raising fight.

“Strong, they are really too strong!”

“Both of them are extremely gifted in the Sword Dao. It’s impossible to tell who’s better.”

“The fight won’t be decided anytime soon. Next, it will all come down to their ultimate techniques.”

The crowd discussed animatedly as they watched.

Ye Xuan also glanced at Daoist Canghai and noticed that the man looked relaxed. He was even in the mood to sip tea, as if he was certain of the outcome.

‘This is getting more and more interesting. What kind of surprise will this young man give me?’ Ye Xuan wondered to himself.

Then, he continued to pay attention to the battle.

It had only been two to three minutes, but the two of them had already exchanged hundreds of blows, each one powerful and overbearing.

“First Sister, I believe you can do it!”

Noticing that the battle on her senior sister’s side was so intense, Xiang Yun took the time to shout some words of encouragement.

When she finished shouting, she realized that her five opponents were paying attention to the battle over there. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly.

‘Hehe, you guys are going to get smacked this time!’

The five of them had yet to notice what she was planning. When they did, they only saw a hammer that blotted out the sky coming toward them.

“F*ck! This little girl is playing dirty!”

Their expressions changed drastically. Since they realized that they could not defeat Xiang Yun quickly, they had been just putting in the motions while watching the fight between Zhuge Yueyue and Mu Beichen.

No matter how one put it, such an intense duel was truly a once-in-a-century occurrence, and they had front row seats.

However, who would have thought that this little girl would take advantage of this situation to pull off an ultimate move.

Boom!

A huge explosion erupted, and even the ground seemed to heave up and down from the impact.

The five of them could not dodge, and braced themselves for the impact.

Xiang Yun’s sudden attack had left the five of them with numb arms after receiving that blow. A few of them were even knocked to the ground.

Xiang Yun was overjoyed to see this.

“Come on, come on! If you have the ability, come and beat me.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She swung her hammer at the young man leading the charge, sending him flying a hundred meters away.

This left the others speechless.

“F*ck, what is this little girl made of?”

One of the attackers thought to himself that if he really wanted to deal with this little girl, he would probably have to use his ultimate move.

However, using it on her would be akin to revealing his trump card to the others!
