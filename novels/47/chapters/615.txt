616 Obedient? Her?

She was from an ordinary background, and had even lost her family. As such, there was probably a lot she had not learnt, including how to read.

“What’s wrong?” Xiang Yun asked curiously when she noticed that everyone’s gaze had changed.

Feng Xiyun lifted her up and said with a smile on her face, “Third Sister, from today onward, if you encounter something you don’t understand, you have to ask us about it immediately.”

Xiang Yun was a little puzzled by this situation. After all, her teacher had instructed her to take a look at it first. She did not have to understand it now, as her teacher would definitely teach her later.

Xiang Yun raised her little head high and said, “This is what Teacher told me to do. He didn’t tell me to understand it. I just had to look at it.”

Seeing her arrogant appearance, Feng Xiyun could not hold back her laughter.

This little girl’s words made sense when they were taken literally.

“Teacher, will you be teaching Xiang Yun how to read?”

Zhuge Yueyue wanted to take responsibility for this matter on behalf of her teacher, but Ye Xuan rejected her without hesitation.

“Your cultivation is at a critical juncture right now. Teaching Xiang Yun how to read is a small matter. Just leave it to the sect. You should seize this time and cultivate.”

In the sect, there was also a place to teach people how to read and write, which was where the children who grew up in the sect would be sent when they reached a certain age. This place was called the study hall.

These children were almost the same age as Xiang Yun, so she could play with them. This was the most suitable place for her.

“That’s fine too,” Zhuge Yueyue agreed.

She squatted down and said to Xiang Yun, “Third Sister, you have to be serious about studying, okay?”

Xiang Yun was already confused and asked, “Big Sister, what’s the study hall for?”

“It’s a place where people teach you how to read. There are also many children your age there, so you can also find playmates there.”

Xiang Yun’s eyes seemed to light up when she heard that. She was so excited that she raised her little hammer up toward the sky.

Seeing her like this, Zhuge Yueyue had a very bad feeling.

She quickly continued, “Third Sister, you must not cause trouble or bully the other children at the study hall. Listen to the teacher there, do you understand?”

Xiang Yun’s eyes darted around guiltily, but she still replied obediently, “Okay, okay, Senior Sister. I understand.”

Somehow, it did not look very convincing to Zhuge Yueyue.

With this girl’s personality, would she be serious about learning how to read? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After much thought, Zhuge Yueyue made a decision and said, “Let me keep your hammer for you. I’ll give it to you after you’ve learned how to read.”

“Wuuu…”

Xiang Yun was displeased, but Zhuge Yueyue ignored her pleas and put it away.

If she really let Xiang Yun go to the study hall with this hammer, she was afraid that the study hall would no longer exist within a few days.

Xiang Yun’s grievance was written all over her face when she saw that her hammer had been taken away. However, she became excited again after a short while.

‘Hehe, even without the help of my hammer, I can still easily control those little brats,’ she thought happily. As the king of the children, she needed to stamp her mark of authority!

When she learned that there were many children of her age in that place, she once again recalled what the old man had told her.

“Only by beating all of your peers can you be called invincible.”

After watching his two disciples talk for a long time, Ye Xuan also said, “Alright, I’ll be going to the study hall later, so I’ll bring her there.”

“However, from tomorrow onward, I’ll leave the matter of sending and picking her up to you two.”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun agreed without hesitation.

“Alright then. Yun’er, come with me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan picked her up and flew into the sky.

“Yay, we’re flying again!”

Xiang Yun became even more excited.

Soon, they arrived at the study hall.

Ye Xuan first had a conversation with the study hall’s manager, Elder Huang.

“Elder Huang, this little girl is the disciple I just accepted. Her name is Xiang Yun. She needs to learn how to read, so I’m entrusting her to you today.”

“There’s one thing I must mention. This little girl is a little mischievous, so I’m afraid she won’t be very obedient…”

Seeing Ye Xuan’s troubled expression, Elder Huang looked at the little girl standing next to Ye Xuan and said, “It’ll be fine. Don’t worry, and just leave it to me.”

“Besides, it looks like your disciple is quite well-behaved at the moment. You can rest assured that I will teach her to read.”

This was considered obedient?

Thinking this, Ye Xuan looked at Xiang Yun, who was standing beside him. She was indeed acting well-behaved right now.

He could barely keep himself from laughing out loud.

‘Cough, cough, maybe she really is quite obedient…’

‘In any case, Elder Huang has already given me his word, so I don’t have to worry about it anymore. I’m not going to be responsible for what happens in the study hall, hehe.’

There was no way Xiang Yun was as obedient as she looked on the surface.

Although he thought differently, Ye Xuan still said politely, “That’s good. I’ll have to trouble you then, Elder Huang.”

“It’s just a small matter that’s not worth mentioning. Just leave it to me. I’ll definitely teach her well.”

After all, in the study hall, every child was naughty. In the end, he had managed to deal with them all.

Ye Xuan’s disciple looked so well-behaved, so she had to be a good disciple.

Ye Xuan’s warning felt a little unnecessary.

...

“Alright then, I have something to attend to, so I’ll be leaving first.”

Before leaving, Ye Xuan looked at Xiang Yun again and said, “Yun’er, don’t mess around. You must learn to read seriously.”
