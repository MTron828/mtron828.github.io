541 The Space In The Boundless Cauldron

Yanran was overjoyed.

Today could be considered the happiest day of her life. Not only did she get a wonderful magic artifact, but she also got a caring and generous boyfriend.

After all, who would be willing to give away such a precious treasure without batting an eyelid. Such an action was proof of his sincerity.

On Ye Xuan’s side, he first looked at the heaven devouring divine sparrow in the distance, then turned his gaze to the stunned onlookers, who had yet to recover from the death of the white-browed old man.

After a long while, someone finally said in a trembling voice as they looked at the pool of liquid that once was the white-browed old man, “This is unbelievable. The white-browed old man couldn’t even block a single move?”

The surrounding cultivators also felt a lingering fear at this time, and they were glad that they did not provoke Ye Xuan earlier. Otherwise, they too would likely be pools of liquid at this moment.

After all, even the white-browed old man could not stop those needles, so how could they? They also belatedly realized that Ye Xuan had given those very same needles to Yanran, which filled them with envy.

“This little brother is really too generous. He didn’t even blink his eyes when he gave away such a precious treasure.”

“I feel like I’ve already eaten a few lemons. My mouth is sour. How nice it would be if I were a girl. I would seduce that little brother for some treasures.”

After hearing this, everyone immediately looked at the speaker with disdain.

However, they were also extremely shocked. Ye Xuan had actually given away the needles?

Even if he wanted to hit on a girl, there was no need to give her such a precious treasure, right? Just how rich was he?

Just as the onlookers were letting their imaginations run wild, an old man in a black robe stood up and said.

“Hello, little brother, I am Mo Yunhai from the North continent. It is a pleasure to meet a heroic young genius like you.”

As the saying goes, no one would hit a smiling person. After Ye Xuan glanced around him, he also smiled and said, “You’re too kind, too kind. I’m also very pleased to meet you.”

Mo Yunhai stroked his long beard as he continued, “Little brother managed to kill the white-browed old man with just a few needles. You’re really powerful. I can’t help but admire your strength.”

“Haha, you really think too highly of me. With my measly strength, how would I dare to embarrass myself in front of you?”

Ye Xuan replied embarrassedly, making it seem as if he was an easy person to approach, which made the onlookers secretly give him a thumbs up.

At this moment, even Yanran felt that Ye Xuan was very modest.

His strength was obvious, but he was not arrogant. This kind of personality was really rare.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Mo Yunhai was also very surprised. His eyes were fixed on Ye Xuan and Yanran.

The two of them were both from the Great Wilderness Divine sect and were both top geniuses. They were really a good match.

In this case, it would not take long for the Great Wilderness Divine sect to stand at the peak again.

When he thought of this, Mo Yunhai could not help but sigh.

Why did his own sect not have such a peerless genius?

Boom!

The entire sky suddenly began to shake violently. This was because the fierce battle between two ferocious beasts had actually shattered space!

“This is bad!”

The onlookers cried out in surprise. Spatial cracks began to appear everywhere, releasing a terrifying void power. Even supreme realm experts would find it difficult to protect themselves if they were caught within them.

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, an early-stage supreme realm expert lost his life, and even his soul was shattered.

“Ah! Let’s quickly escape!”

Mo Yunhai shouted in a panic, and then immediately used his protective talisman.

Seeing this, the other cultivators quickly followed suit and ran for their lives.

At this moment, the aura of a sealed immortal realm existence was firmly fixed on Ye Xuan.

Yanran also noticed this situation. Her face suddenly turned pale and she felt a little overwhelmed.

The next moment, a warm arm pulled her into an embrace.

Ye Xuan said to the beauty in his arms with a tender expression.

“Don’t worry. As long as I’m alive, I’ll definitely protect you.”

Hearing this, Yanran’s heart started beating wildly. She did not know where to put her two hands, so she could only grab the corners of Ye Xuan’s clothes.

A moment later, Yanran also looked around and realized that they were in a completely unfamiliar space, and were no longer in their original position.

“Where is this place?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan also smiled and said, “This is the internal space of the boundless cauldron.”

“What?”

Yanran was already stunned. Ye Xuan’s boundless cauldron actually contained such a vast space? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Just now, when she sensed the aura of the sealed immortal realm existence, she felt that she would definitely not be able to survive this time.

However, unexpectedly, Ye Xuan had brought them here, and it seemed that they were now safe.

While she was grateful, Yanran was also very surprised.

Was the boundless cauldron so powerful that it could even escape the senses of a sealed immortal realm existence?

Even though this sealed immortal realm existence had passed away many years ago, the aura he had left behind was still extraordinary. If it attacked, even a peak-level supreme realm expert would not be able to withstand it.
