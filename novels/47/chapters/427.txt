428 Strange Phenomenon

When Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun saw this, they were also surprised. Then, they quickly moved away.

A few casual words from Ye Xuan had caused Hua Rufeng to start breaking through.

“Interesting. It seems like this kid’s comprehension is not bad!”

Ye Xuan smiled.

Hua Rufeng was in a state of epiphany, which was something that countless cultivators pursued.

Such a rare opportunity was not something that could be obtained just because one wanted to. In the state of epiphany, the gains one could obtain far exceeded the value of spiritual pills and elixirs.

Layers of mysterious ripples suddenly spread out around Hua Rufeng, and the spiritual energy of the surroundings suddenly gathered around him.

A spiral appeared above Cloud Sky peak.

At the same time, in the meeting hall, Gongsun Shouyue, who had been cultivating with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.

“This phenomenon… could it be an epiphany?”

...

The spiritual energy in the surroundings was gathering in the direction of Cloud Sky peak.

Could it be caused by the disciples of Cloud Sky peak?

Gongsun Shouyue waved his sleeves and turned into a streak of light as he headed toward the source of the phenomenon.

At this moment, Yuelun, who was teaching Li Xue’er, suddenly raised her head.

Looking at the spiral-shaped spiritual energy in the sky, she was shocked.

“Who is the one who caused this phenomenon?”

“Teacher, it’s coming from the direction of Cloud Sky peak. Could it be Martial Uncle Ye?” Li Xue’er asked.

After what had happened earlier, Li Xue’er and the others had realized that Martial Uncle Ye, who was called trash by countless people, was actually a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He was a powerful expert, who had remained low-key this entire time.

Yuelun had a contemplative look in her eyes.

Anyone who could cause such a phenomenon was no ordinary person.

“Hanyi, come with me.”

...

Then, with a wave of her sleeve, Yuelun disappeared with Li Hanyi.

As the strange phenomenon above Cloud Sky peak became more and more pronounced, the cultivators of the seven peaks of the Great Wilderness Divine sect also noticed it. It left everyone shocked.

Gao Shun had been about to return to his residence to rest when he had sensed the phenomenon. His spiritual sense immediately swept out, but when he realized that it originated from Cloud Sky peak, his gaze turned cold.

“Damn it! Why is it Cloud Sky peak again?”

Multiple streaks of light flashed and headed in the direction of Cloud Sky peak.

Ye Xuan also noticed this, and his figure suddenly flickered and appeared in the courtyard.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched as he looked at the scene outside.

“There are too many people coming here!”

Ye Xuan had never seen such a lively scene since he joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

A bright light flashed by, and Gongsun Shouyue’s figure suddenly appeared.

“Junior Brother Ye, who is the one who caused this strange phenomenon?” Gongsun Shouyue asked anxiously.

...

Someone who could cause such a sensation had to be a genius, and would be treasured by the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

No matter who it was, this person was from the Great Wilderness Divine sect, so he was naturally very excited.

Moreover, he had already guessed in his heart that it was probably not Zhuge Yueyue, but Feng Xiyun, Ye Xuan’s newest disciple.

Ye Xuan smiled, but did not explain.

At this moment, a few more bright lights suddenly flashed past.

“Hahaha! Junior Brother Ye’s Cloud Sky peak is truly a place of great talents. The sudden appearance of such a strange phenomenon almost scared me silly!”

Before the person arrived, his voice had already resounded.

Liang Dahai from Sword Spirit peak and Gao Xiangyu from Sword Trial peak appeared.

Then, Yuelun appeared with Li Hanyi.

After briefly examining the strange phenomenon, she said to Ye Xuan softly, “Junior Brother Ye, your Cloud Sky peak is really full of surprises. Hurry up and tell us. Who caused this strange phenomenon?”

Ye Xuan smiled and said nothing.

It was great showing off and acting cool!

At the same time, everyone looked at the spiral-shaped spiritual energy and suddenly became anxious.

Gongsun Shouyue coughed and said seriously, “Junior Brother Ye, don’t keep us in suspense. Just tell us!”

“Senior Brother Gongsun, you think too highly of our Cloud Sky peak. This phenomenon was not caused by my disciples, but yours.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone suddenly turned silent.

A disciple of Gongsun Shouyue?

What the f*ck?

Was this a joke?

How could Gongsun Shouyue’s disciple cultivate on Cloud Sky peak, and even cause such a magnificent phenomenon?
