634 Learning Alchemy (Part 1)

“Junior Brother Ye, what are you doing here?”

Ao Lei looked at Ye Xuan doubtfully.

Why was his junior brother foolishly laughing in public?

Hearing Ao Lei’s words, Ye Xuan finally came back to his senses. He had indeed been too happy just now.

!!

“Haha, it’s nothing much. I just brought my disciple over here to learn how to read. I’ll be heading back soon.”

“What did you just say?”

After hearing that the little girl from Cloud Sky peak had actually come back here, Ao Lei was really surprised.

He immediately glanced inside, frowned, and began to think.

The next moment, he called out to the group of children from his own peak to come outside, thinking of hiding them first.

They could learn to read and write at any time, but if stuck around that little girl, they would soon be beaten up.

“Senior Brother Ao, what’s the meaning of this?”

Ye Xuan’s face darkened. Was his little disciple really so terrifying?

Ao Lei laughed and replied, “Ahem, it’s actually nothing. I called them over because I’m conducting a lesson for them. It’s been a long time since I’ve held one for them. In any case, I’ll take my leave first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ao Lei instantly led the children back, not daring to stay for a moment longer.

As for whether the lesson he was talking about was true or not, who cared?

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Xiang Yun, who was reading obediently, and thought to himself, ‘It’s unlikely that there will be a problem…’

Thinking this, Ye Xuan decided to return to Cloud Sky peak, where Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were still waiting.

With a flash of light, Ye Xuan arrived in front of them.

“Teacher, how’s the situation? Has Third Sister’s matter really been settled?” Zhuge Yueyue asked anxiously.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “It was easily settled. I just gave away two treasures.”

After hearing this, the two of them wiped the sweat off their foreheads guiltily.

This was indeed Ye Xuan’s style of doing things. If it could be solved by giving something, he would never use other methods.

“Alright, you don’t have to worry about Xiang Yun anymore. However, both of you will be responsible for bringing her back to Cloud Sky peak in the evening.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue quickly agreed.

However, inwardly, she was worried that Xiang Yun would be expelled before the day was done again.

If she beat up all of the children inside again, it would not be so easy to get back in.

“Alright! Today, I’ll teach you how to refine medicinal pills.”

“Since both of you are new to alchemy, I’ll teach you some simple things first. For example, the healing pill and the soul returning pill that are unique to our Cloud Sky peak.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took out two cauldrons and some herbs, and gave them to his two disciples.

Ye Xuan had bought these cauldrons in Qingyang city and given it to them as a gift.

Even though the cauldrons they were using right now were not of a very high grade, they could still be used to refine some simple medicinal pills.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan also transmitted the refining method for the soul returning pill to them.

“There is a clear difference between alchemy and cultivation,” he said.

“Alchemy tests your patience, your eye for detail, and your control over the flames…”

“During the refining process, all of you must be alert and observant at all times. Only then will you be able to refine a good pill. Otherwise, you will end up with a cauldron full of useless pills.”

After hearing this, the two of them became very serious and replied seriously, “We understand.”

Zhuge Yueyue was not very interested in refining pills. After all, her attributes were the exact opposite of Feng Xiyun’s. Her control over flames was not that strong either.

It was precisely because of this that Zhuge Yueyue could only rely on her own spiritual power to control the refining process.

If her own spiritual power was exhausted, then the refining process would fail.

However, Feng Xiyun was different. Her attribute was fire, and she also cultivated the hellfire technique. As such, she could easily control flames, and was more suited to alchemy.

She could even continuously improve her mastery of the hellfire technique while refining pills.

In other words, Feng Xiyun was cultivating while she was refining pills.

After examining the refining method that Ye Xuan had taught them, Feng Xiyun rushed to refine the pill first.

One could see that she was adding the herbs one by one into the cauldron in a certain order. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Her two hands formed different palm imprints in front of the cauldron, and extremely powerful flames instantly enveloped the entire cauldron.

As the temperature rose, the various herbs inside turned into liquid.

Ye Xuan looked at it carefully and even released his spiritual sense to check the state of the herbs inside.

“Focus,” Ye Xuan said, “Pay attention to your control over the flames and control your spiritual power to slowly condense the medicinal liquid.”

After hearing these words, Feng Xiyun became even more energetic. She released her spiritual power, causing the entire cauldron to start spinning.

Because Feng Xiyun’s control over the flames was good, the early stage of the refining process went very smoothly.

After all of the herbs inside had turned into medicinal liquid, she immediately erupted with even more spiritual power. She controlled the medicinal liquid inside and began to condense it into a pill.

After an hour, the refining process was finally completed. The lid of the cauldron flew up, and a few pills slowly rose up.

Ye Xuan caught the pills and looked at them, then said, “They are alright…”

“Even though the quality of these pills isn’t great, this is only your first attempt. It’s already quite good that you can do this.”

...

To be able to achieve this result on her first attempt was really admirable, and spoke volumes of her talent for alchemy.
