548 Red Spider Lily

With the help of the fiery phoenix’s divine bone, his speed should be unrivaled from now on, right?

It was truly a bountiful harvest!

“Would the host like to start refining the fiery phoenix’s divine bone immediately?”

“Do it, system!”

As soon as he said this, the divine bone turned into a red light and began to merge into Ye Xuan’s body.

At the same time, the cultivation method for the fire phoenix’s divine power entered Ye Xuan’s mind. After refining the fiery phoenix’s divine bone, Ye Xuan could now move hundreds of miles virtually instantaneously, and this distance would only increase along with his mastery of the divine power.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan became very excited. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

From now on, there was probably no one who could match his speed.

When he was chasing after the heaven devouring divine sparrow back then, Ye Xuan had clearly felt that he was lacking in speed, which had allowed it to escape.

However, that was all in the past.

In the future, even if he encountered agile enemies, he would not be at a disadvantage.

‘Haha, this is awesome,’ Ye Xuan thought happily and immediately began to cultivate the divine power. Thanks to his excellent comprehension ability, it did not take him long to grasp the basics.

While Ye Xuan was still immersed in his wonderful mood, a loud roar was heard.

Boom!

“Is the immortal heavenly treasure finally going to appear?”

When they saw the coffin on the black tortoise’s back shake violently, the onlookers became extremely excited.

Then, a brilliant light flashed from the coffin.

This coffin that had been shut for countless years was finally open!

Moments later, a red spider lily emitting a dark glow slowly rose into the air. Even the space around it started to distort.

“Run!”

After Ye Xuan shouted, he held Yanran tightly in his arms.

Before Yanran could break free, she also sensed the aura of a sealed immortal realm expert coming out of the coffin.

“It’s over, hurry up and run!”

At this moment, all of the spectators turned pale and fled without hesitation.

Ye Xuan also used his Boundless Cauldron and hid inside with Yanran.

The others were also unwilling to fall behind, and all kinds of magic artifacts were used to save their lives.

However, some of the unlucky ones were instantly swept away by the aura, and did not even have time to scream before they died.

Boom!

The Pixiu let out a deafening sound as it shook violently.

It had also been swept away by the aura of the sealed immortal realm expert and sent flying without a trace.

The Zhuyan was not any better off either.

The situation turned chaotic, and there was nothing but panic in the air.

Moments later, the red spider lily that was glowing red suddenly fled into the distance.

“You dare to escape? Don’t even think about it!”

Ou Yunhai immediately sensed that something was wrong and attacked the red spider lily, his eyes filled with desire.

This red spider lily definitely belonged to him!

If he was right, this red spider lily was the immortal heavenly treasure. If he obtained it, he would be able to surpass the supreme realm!

Under such circumstances, no matter how many divine powers and secret techniques Ye Xuan had, he would be able to deal with him easily. Furthermore, with such strength, Yanran would probably change her mind and throw herself into his arms.

No matter what, in this world, strength was respected. His strength would change her heart!

“Hehe! Ou Yunhai, this red spider lily is mine! If you still want to keep your life, then get lost!”

While Ou Yunhai was lost in his thoughts, a sudden voice broke him out of his fantasy.

The assassin leader wielded his giant saber and attacked Ou Yunhai, forcing him to dodge while shouting, “Damn it! Who do you think you are to oppose me?”

“Does it matter who I am? You’re a nobody anyway,” the assassin leader replied in a domineering manner, “This isn’t the Heavenly Wind Divine sect! Your status is meaningless here.”

After his first attack missed, the assassin leader raised his saber and attacked again, sending Ou Yunhai flying.

At this moment, the anger in Ou Yunhai’s heart was about to explode. He gritted his teeth and said, “Fine! You want to be my enemy? Well, don’t regret it once I’m done with you!”

Ou Yunhai no longer suppressed his power and released his full strength.

Then, he took out a Yin Yang magic artifact and sealed the area.

Waves of killing intent instantly spread out. Ou Yunhai seemed to have turned into an emotionless assassin as he continued to launch attacks, forcing the assassin leader to retreat.

At this moment, the assassin leader’s anger was also aroused, and he did not hide his animosity, as he too went all out.

“You are simply tired of living!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the assassin leader unleashed a crescent strike with his saber.

“What the…”

The onlookers’ jaws dropped when they saw this attack.

All of a sudden, a white figure flashed and rushed toward the immortal heavenly treasure…
