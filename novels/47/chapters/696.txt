697 Trump Cards (Part 2)

Watching the two geniuses prepare their ultimate moves, everyone was on tenterhooks. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness these two heaven-defying geniuses go all out.

The Ten Thousands Swords Empire divine power was a heaven-grade divine power, but had been further improved by Daoist Canghai, whereas Zhuge Yueyue’s divine power had been simplified from the third move of the Flora Sword technique by Ye Xuan.

This was both a competition between the disciples, but also their teachers.

As they gathered their strength, the sword aura in the surroundings intensified, and began to wreak havoc in their surroundings.

!!

“This move again?”

Looking at the door that appeared in the sky, Mu Beichen became excited. As a sword cultivator, facing another powerful sword technique head-on was thrilling to say the least.

“Hehe, let’s go all out then!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an immense amount of spiritual power surged out of his body.

Regardless of whether he won or lost, he had no regrets.

Zhuge Yueyue remained calm as she faced the menacing attacks. She held the Cloud Sky Sword in her hand and focused herself, condensing a huge sword that came crashing down toward the Xuanming Swords.

In the blink of an eye, the two attacks collided with each other, creating a violent explosion.

After seeing that all of the Xuanming Swords he had used had been defeated, Mu Beichen once again mobilized his spiritual power and condensed them anew. This time, he merged all of them into a single sword.

This was the final form of the Ten Thousand Swords Empire

Mu Beichen shouted, “Empire Sword Slash!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the huge sword slashed toward Zhuge Yueyue with seemingly unstoppable force. It was as if a giant had swung the sword from the heavens above.

In the sky, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression changed drastically when she saw the approaching sword strike. After using her ultimate move twice in a row, her spiritual power had been exhausted.

Fortunately, she still had the high-grade soul-returning pills, and instantly took one and recovered to her peak condition.

Then, the door in the sky was reactivated, and the huge sword reappeared, crashing against the giant Xuanming Sword.

With a loud bang, powerful fluctuations swept out, and it almost seemed like the ancient realm was trembling.

The other eight participants were forced to take a few steps back in order to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

Then, they looked up and saw Mu Beichen falling from the sky

“Oh my god, Mu Beichen actually lost? ”

Zhuge Yueyue was not in a much better condition. She spat out several mouthfuls of blood, and it was obvious that her body was severely injured.

Mu Beichen’s ultimate move would have defeated her if she had not mastered the move her teacher had taught her prior to the gathering. It was no wonder Ye Xuan thought highly of Mu Beichen and even praised him..

After taking out another high-grade soul-returning pill and consuming it, Zhuge Yueyue’s complexion recovered.

On the other side, Mu Beichen, who had just been teleported out, muttered to himself, “Still no match?”

He smiled bitterly as he lowered his head to look at the Xuanming Sword in his hand.

This was the first time in his life that he had been defeated by someone in a straight-up fight. This feeling was really uncomfortable.

Who would have expected that the number one genius of the East continent would be the first to be eliminated in the final battle?

Even though he had already been eliminated, the onlookers did not have any intention of mocking him at all.

After all, they had all witnessed the terrifying power of both fighters just now. They themselves would have stood no chance against either of them.

“Grandmaster, Teacher, I’m sorry, I couldn’t defeat Zhuge Yueyue.”

Mu Beichen had already walked over to Elder Tongtian and Daoist Canghai dejectedly.

Daoist Canghai did not have any intention of criticizing him. He only sighed with emotion. His eyes were still on Zhuge Yueyue and the Cloud Sky Sword in her hand.

Unknowingly, he thought back to what had happened a hundred years ago when he had been defeated by Chief Tian Xuan.

He smiled bitterly and said, “Forget it, forget it” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This was all predestined.

After Mu Beichen was eliminated, everyone noticed that Zhuge Yueyue had been severely injured.

“She has been severely injured by Mu Beichen. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Let’s get rid of her first,” Xu Changqing proposed.

Even though she had already consumed the soul-returning pill, it would take some time for her to fully recover. If they did not take this opportunity to attack now, they might not have a better chance to eliminate her later.

At this moment, the five disciples who were attacking Xiang Yun charged at Zhuge Yueyue.

“First Sister!”

Seeing this, Xiang Yun shouted a warning nervously.

Hua Rufeng was still locked in battle with the Reincarnation Fairy so he could not rush over to help.
