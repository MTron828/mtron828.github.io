304 Precious Disciples, See You Again In Six Years

After that, his disciples took out the spiritual items Ye Xuan had given them from their storage rings.

The Datura flower, the crimson dreamsoul branch, the netherblood hell grass, and the bloodsoul dream spirit flower!

If any one of these spiritual items were to appear in the outside world, it would definitely cause a frenzied fight for them. Even King realm experts would be tempted.

After seeing his disciples take out the items, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and an illusory and transparent energy body suddenly condensed.

Moments later, a trace of his spiritual sense entered the illusory energy body. This method was similar to how King realm experts created comprehensive jade tokens.

The energy body that Ye Xuan had condensed could also be imbued into a jade token. When that jade token was crushed, the energy body would appear and attack the enemy. The purpose of infusing a trace of his spiritual sense into it was also so that he would be able to control it to a certain extent.

This time, the function of this energy body was to display martial intents for his disciples to comprehend. He, on the other hand, would be busy attempting to comprehend the Tower of Heaven’s karmic and spatial intents.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan’s surging spiritual power swept out of his body and helped his disciples refine the four spiritual items.

Moments later, the items started emitting a rich fragrance, and energy fluctuations.

“Open your mouths,” Ye Xuan said to his disciples.

The next second, four masses of extremely pure energy suddenly entered their bodies.

Before their bodies could start absorbing it, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense engulfed their bodies, refining and processing the energy into smaller, more, digestible portions, which would allow them to absorb it faster.

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained a 10-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 30-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained an 11-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 5x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 55-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained a 13-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 20x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 260-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has obtained a 17-day epiphany experience opportunity. The host has received a randomized 123x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a 2,091-day epiphany experience opportunity!”

Without a doubt, the highest reward multiplier had been obtained from Shangguan Wan’er. Even Ye Xuan was surprised to receive this much.

It seemed that he would be able to comprehend even more martial intents, and perhaps even some new ones. Still, his priority was comprehending supreme intents.

In total, Ye Xuan had received a 2,436-day epiphany experience opportunity from his four disciples, which was slightly more than six years.

“My precious disciples, I’m also going into secluded cultivation!”

“If there’s nothing urgent, don’t disturb me during this time!”

“Cultivate well. I should be out in about six years.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared. At the same time, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense also merged with the Tower of Heaven.

“Six years?”

When his disciples heard this, their expressions darkened.

To most cultivators, a mere six years of secluded cultivation was insignificant.

However, among the four of them, other than Shangguan Wan’er, the rest were all very young.

To them, six years was already one-third of the life they had lived in this world.

This was especially true for Zhao Yuyan, who was only nine years old.

Whoosh!

Just as the three of them were in a daze, a few bright rays of light suddenly fell from the sky.

These rays of light flickered with the power of heavenly lightning, and turned out to be jade tokens that Ye Xuan had refined.

Not only did it contain the terrifying power of his King realm physical strength, but it also contained a powerful seal formed from the fusion of the heavenly lightning and spatial intents. Other than that, this seal also contained the power of a high-level formation.

This was also not a single-use jade token, and could be used up to ten times.

If it was activated within the range of the Tower of Heaven, it would form a sturdy energy barrier, and also teleport them to the Qingyun sect.

Even if it was activated anywhere in the Nanzhou Region, it would teleport them to the Tower of Heaven instantly.

“Once your epiphanies are over, you can cultivate the martial techniques and cultivation methods I’ve imparted to you.”

“Then, after you’ve completely stabilized your cultivation foundation, you can go to the outside world to train.”

“The jade token I’ve given you will allow you to enter the Tower of Heaven at will.”

Ye Xuan’s voice was transmitted into their minds.

As soon as he said that, Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan could not help but clutch the token.

Before meeting Ye Xuan, Shangguan Wan’er had always been a loner, so she did not feel much different.

However, Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan had never been separated from their teacher for so long. Six years! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, when they thought of their teacher’s expectations, they quickly composed themselves and focused on comprehending the martial intents displayed by the energy body in front of them.

Shangguan Wan’er did not say much, and used her epiphany experience to comprehend slaughter intent. With the blood-red saber and the bloodsoul dream spirit flower, her comprehension would be augmented, making it easier to comprehend slaughter intent.

In the blink of an eye, 17 days passed.

Shangguan Wan’er’s tightly-shut eyes slowly opened. A tinge of red was hidden in the depths of her eyes.

Fourth-level slaughter intent!

Shangguan Wan’er was filled with excitement.

Although it had not reached the point where she could engrave slaughter intent as one of her profound patterns, it had greatly enhanced her combat prowess.
