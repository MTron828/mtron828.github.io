954 Child Of Destiny

Ye Xuan was very emotional at this moment. There were some people who cultivated with all their might, yet might never reach the supreme realm.

However, there were also some people who were born as supreme realm cultivators, and would advance without any bottlenecks.

Those blessed by talent and the heavens were truly on a different level.

F*ck…

After sighing for a moment, Ye Xuan started to ponder on why this was happening. As he did, he recalled that, at the moment this little monkey was born, a phenomenon appeared in the world.

Moreover, Ye Xuan had calculated at that time that this little monkey was a destiny monkey that was born in response to the calamity, which was the reason why he had chosen to take this little monkey as his disciple.

Now that he had discovered the divine bones in Wukong’s body, Ye Xuan had come to some conclusions.

“This is interesting. Could this little fellow be the legendary destiny monkey?”

Every chief of Cloud Sky peak had been told that the Seven-Colored Stone in Cloud Sky Cave was a sacred item left behind from ancient times and had to be carefully guarded.

In this case, the reason behind those words were now evident. This seven-colored stone had actually given birth to a bearer of destiny. This presented another problem.

What exactly was the calamity they needed to deal with?

The strange realm could no longer be considered a serious disaster, as the strange monsters had hidden themselves well, and were no longer causing much strife and chaos.

Could it be there that there was some other disaster? If so, then he would need to make some other preparations.

At the moment, without any clues, he could only watch, wait and get stronger. Thinking this, his gaze turned to the little monkey again. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Right now, the little monkey was experiencing the immense pain brought about by this life and death tribulation, and his vitality was constantly weakening. The spiritual energy and the medicinal effects of the heavenly treasures he had consumed had both caused the problem, and were helping him persist through the calamity.

“Sigh, little monkey, you’ve really been too naughty. Forget it! Today, your teacher will help you again.”

Ye Xuan could not help but laugh bitterly. Then, he pressed his palms on the little monkey’s back and transmitted his spiritual power into Wukong’s body.

This could help him reduce the pain his body was enduring and help him safely survive the tribulation. When the spiritual power was transferred into Wukong’s body, a dazzling golden light was released, and his vitality began to recover.

At this moment, Ye Xuan looked at the little monkey in shock as the latter’s body was suddenly enveloped by a large cocoon.

“Good heavens!”

At this moment, Ye Xuan was stunned because he sensed that the little monkey’s cultivation realm had actually increased significantly, and he had broken through to the ancient realm.

“My darling, my darling!”

Such terrifying cultivation speed!

The little monkey did not stop after breaking through to the ancient realm.

After Ye Xuan noticed this, he gradually stopped transmitting spiritual power. Then, he took out the Jingu Staff and placed it beside Wukong. His figure flashed and he left.

The little monkey, who was still most unconscious, also noticed something, and realized that someone was helping him. He was overjoyed and desperately tried to open his eyes to see who it was, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not open his eyes.

In the end, he concluded that only his teacher would help him. After all, he did not have any friends or relatives.

“Teacher, are you here?”

The little furry monkey mumbled to himself. It sounded as if the little monkey was longing to see a loved one.

When Ye Xuan heard the little monkey’s words, his heart trembled. Even though this little monkey loved to stir up trouble, no matter what, he was still his disciple.

Even though Ye Xuan acted like he did not care, it was just an act. At this moment, he just did not want to face the little monkey.

Turning around to look at the little furry monkey again, Ye Xuan steeled his heart. Ever since Ye Xuan left the Seven-Star Cave Abode that day, the little monkey’s former teacher no longer existed in this world.

He left, and decided to search for traces of Ao Lei and the others.

However, Ye Xuan spent more than half a day searching and had not found any traces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s disciples at all.

“This is really strange. Where did these people go?”

Ye Xuan had a bad feeling, especially when he recalled Gongsun Ming’s expression, which filled him with anxiety. After all, not long ago, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had exterminated the Immortal Divine sect in the East continent, so Gongsun Ming was bound to be hostile toward them.

Impatient, Ye Xuan released his spiritual sense, sweeping his surroundings as he constantly searched everywhere he went.

He had to find traces of Ao Lei and the others as soon as possible to confirm if they were in danger. Then, he suddenly discovered something wrong in a cave in an extremely cold area.

This cave had already been sealed to prevent the transmission of information. Furthermore, there were also a few elders in black robes standing guard outside the cave. Based on their auras, they were also from the Immortal Divine sect.

After noticing this, Ye Xuan quietly approached to see if he could find out what was going on.

At this moment, the two elders at the entrance of the cave were discussing.

“Senior Brother Huang, why did you lock them up instead of killing them? Wouldn’t that be more convenient?”

“Instead, we’ve been dragged into guarding the cave entrance here. It’s not easy for us to encounter an opportunity to enter the ancient palace.”
