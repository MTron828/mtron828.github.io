772 Spatial Cage

After hearing Ye Xuan’s mocking words, the strange monster turned furious again and roared, “Damned low-level creature!”

“Lowly creatures like you are not qualified to mock me!”

“When the master comes personally, you will definitely experience despair.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled disdainfully and calmly raised the Godsword.

“Well, that’s a matter for later. For now, you should worry about whether this so-called master of yours can save your *ss!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan was about to give him a final blow when the strange monster released waves of black fog again.

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan was a little surprised to sense that the spatial power it used had restricted him somewhat.

“Hehehe!”

The strange monster laughed out loud, and in an instant, its body that was full of holes from the sword beams began to recover.

“A low-level creature will always be a low-level creature. Did you really think that I would lose so easily?”

“You are really stupid…”

“I did all that just now because I wanted to lure you into a trap.”

After saying this, the strange monster could not suppress the excitement in its heart at all and laughed wantonly again as it looked arrogantly at Ye Xuan.

“This trap is famous in my world, the Spatial Cage!”

“As long as I successfully trap an enemy in the spatial cage, even an sealed immortal realm expert can only accept their fate. They will fight until their strength is exhausted and eventually die.”

After saying this, the strange monster smiled gleefully.

“It’s worth mentioning that you do have some strength, but it’s only just a little. I’ve fought in countless worlds, but the only person that has ever forced me to go to this extent is you. This is your honor.”

After saying this, the strange monster tilted its hands and looked at Ye Xuan with a mocking expression, seemingly waiting to witness Ye Xuan’s slow death.

At this moment, black lightning bolts descended from the sky. Under the cover of the black fog, it was very difficult to tell how many lightning bolts there were.

Now, Ye Xuan’s figure was completely engulfed in the black fog once more, causing the onlookers to panic. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Teacher!”

However, the chiefs present would never let her do such a stupid thing.

“Zhuge Yueyue, don’t act rashly. We must have faith in your teacher.”

Gao Shun shouted to dissuade her. If she rushed out now, it would only cause Ye Xuan more trouble. After all, given their cultivation levels, they would be more of a hindrance than help.

“Second Sister, is Teacher in trouble?”

At this moment, everyone had forgotten that Xiang Yun was here as well. After seeing what was going on, her mood worsened, and the hidden seal in her body had already begun to loosen, emitting waves of terrifying power.

Zhuge Yueyue was the first to notice this situation. She instantly squeezed her junior sister’s small hand and mobilized her spiritual power to try and stabilize the seal in Xiang Yun’s body.

She still remembered her teacher telling them that Xiang Yun’s body was extremely special, and that as her senior sisters, they had to pay attention to the seal in her body at all times.

These seals were placed on her before she reincarnated. If the seals were undone, then she might no longer be the Xiang Yun they knew. Moreover, this seal involved the power of karma, which would cause all sorts of problems if it went out of control.

Releasing the seal in advance would also ruin the plans and preparations of the mighty expert who reincarnated into Xiang Yun. The consequences would be very serious.

“First Sister, what’s happening? Why is Xiang Yun acting like this?” Feng Xiyun asked nervously when she saw Xiang Yun’s eyes suddenly shut tight, and that her face filled with pain.

Her gaze was focused on Ye Xuan, and she had not noticed Xiang Yun’s situation. Luckily, Zhuge Yueyue was there.

Zhuge Yueyue felt a lingering sense of fear at this moment. She did not dare to slack off at all. She mobilized all of her spiritual power in order to stabilize the seal.

As time passed, the seal gradually stabilized.

“That scared the hell out of me,” Zhuge Yueyue said after heaving a sigh of relief.

“There’s no problem now. Fortunately, I sensed it in time. Otherwise, the seal in Xiang Yun’s body would have been broken.”

After settling that matter, Zhuge Yueyue gently pulled Xiang Yun into her arms to comfort her.

However, when she looked up at the sky and saw that her teacher was still wrapped in that thick black fog, her heart was seized by worry.

She wished that she was stronger so that she could help her teacher.

In the sky, an endless stream of black fog surged out. The situation was not looking good, and everyone was on the verge of panicking.

“Haha!”

Seeing the trap that it had set up was successful, the strange monster laughed presumptuously.
