937 A Lecherous Flood Dragon

How did these different beast races nurture their descendants?

‘Such a scene must be very interesting, right?’ Ye Xuan could not help but think to himself.

At this moment, the flood dragon let out another loud roar. Then, it continuously spiraled into the sky, causing the entire ancient palace to shake violently.

After it let out a dragon roar, the flood dragon instantly spat out a cloud of extremely dense smoke, trapping the Nine-tailed Sparrow within.

Then, he immediately took action, circling around the Nine-tailed Sparrow to keep it from running away.

However, the Nine-tailed Sparrow was not an existence to be trifled with. She instantly spread her wings and released dazzling seven-colored divine light.

In an instant, the smoke released by the flood dragon was dispersed. She even attacked it.

However, the flood dragon did not take her attack seriously. With a swing of its tail, it dodged the blow.

“Haha!”

After dodging, the flood dragon let out an unbridled laugh and looked at the Nine-tailed Sparrow with infatuation. Its eyes were filled with evil desire.

“Pretty lady, stop struggling. It’s useless. Can’t you just follow me back?””

“Besides, your actions will only make me more excited. If we fight, and I accidentally injure you, my heart will ache.”

After hearing these words, the Nine-tailed Sparrow’s expression instantly froze, and her eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Shut up!” the Nine-tailed Sparrow shouted coldly. Looking at this lecherous long worm in front of it, the Nine-tailed Sparrow felt extremely disgusted.

This dragon was originally a sleeping existence in the ancient palace. When the door of the ancient palace was opened, she did not fight for the immortal heavenly treasures. Instead, she went to explore the area.

She had unintentionally awakened the sleeping flood dragon, so she apologized, and was even willing to make up for it. However, this flood dragon seemed to have gone crazy over her.

No matter what treasures she offered, it was to no avail. This damned flood dragon wanted to make her its woman. However, this was definitely not what she wanted.

The problem was, she had no way of beating this old fellow!

Boom!

Another huge explosion rang out, and the two began to exchange blows again. Seeing them fight, everyone was shocked.

The Nine-tailed Sparrow released dazzling seven-colored light as it unleashed attack after attack at the flood dragon. However, the flood dragon was an eternal realm expert, so its strength dwarfed the Nine-tailed Sparrow by a large margin.

In fact, had it not been for her powerful innate abilities, the Nine-tailed Sparrow might have been captured by the flood dragon the moment they started fighting.

After another huge collision, the Nine-tailed Sparrow spat out blood, and her face was extremely pale.

“Damn it!”

The flood dragon’s combat strength exceeded her expectations, and if the situation continued to develop unchecked, her defeat was inevitable.

She did not want to become the flood dragon’s plaything!

Moreover, after it got tired of playing with her, it would probably eat her!

This was an unacceptable outcome!

“Hehehe!”

Seeing that the Nine-tailed Sparrow was completely at a disadvantage, the flood dragon laughed loudly and spoke with an evil expression.

“Little Nine-tailed, being able to become my Dao companion is a blessing. I will definitely make you feel special. Hahaha!”

“Stop struggling in vain. No one can save you today!”

As it said this, the flood dragon licked its mouth evilly, looking lecherous and lustful.

After hearing this, the crowd had a rough idea of what was going on.

At this moment, there were already many cultivators from major families whose faces were filled with anger. They felt extremely indignant.

“What the hell is with that flood dragon?”

“It’s so disgusting. Even listening to it makes my skin crawl!”

“Is it trying to force the Nine-tailed Sparrow to become its Dao companion? How shameless!”

“Damn it! As a descendant of the dragon race, it’s actually doing such an evil thing. Ptui!”

Hearing these shouts, the flood dragon immediately released a terrifying killing intent and instantly set its gaze on the cultivator who had cursed the loudest.

Under the pressure of its powerful aura, this person instantly exploded into a cloud of blood mist, causing everyone to immediately fall silent. In the face of pure power, even if they had objections, they could not give voice to them.

“Hehe, trash like you dares to talk behind my back?” the flood dragon said with a cold expression.

It was born prideful. After all, it possessed the bloodline of the dragon race.

However, at this moment, another discordant voice rang out.

“Haha, you’re just a small worm. Do you think you’re really a dragon? You’re just some b*stard child of a b*stard parents! Calling yourself a dragon brings shame upon your ancestors!”

After hearing this, the entire place fell silent. Even the sound of water dripping could be clearly heard. The flood dragon was furious and immediately looked in the direction of the voice.

“So it’s you, you piece trash!”

The one confronting the flood dragon was the Thunder-Devouring Beast. After seeing the Thunder-Devouring Beast, the killing intent in the flood dragon’s eyes became even stronger.

At this moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast was looking at the flood dragon without any hint of fear. His eyes were filled with disdain as he hovered in the sky and looked down at the flood dragon.

He looked noble and majestic.

Seeing the Thunder Devouring’s huge body and his arrogant gaze, everyone present was stunned. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This person…”

Even the Nine-tailed Sparrow was shocked by the domineering appearance of the Thunder-Devouring Beast.
