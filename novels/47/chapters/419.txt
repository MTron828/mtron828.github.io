He could only swallow his pride and apologize to Ye Xuan. Of course, this was the biggest concession he could make.

Seeing Gao Shun’s sincere apology, Ye Xuan inwardly laughed. He knew that this situation had pissed off Gao Shun greatly, which made him feel even better.

It was good to see Gao Shun get a taste of what he had endured for a hundred years.

“Since Senior Brother Gao has displayed such sincerity, I won’t be unreasonable.”

!!

“In any case, we are members of the same sect. I will reluctantly accept these artifacts.”

Hu!

Seeing Ye Xuan finally agree, Gao Shun took a deep breath in relief.

Although he would have plenty of time to recoup his losses later, the fact that he had to apologize so sincerely to Ye Xuan made him feel like puking.

After resolving this matter, Gao Shun was about to turn around and leave, but was interrupted by Ye Xuan.

“Please wait a moment, Senior Brother Gao!”

“Eh? Is there anything else Junior Brother Ye needs?”

Gao Shun’s brows furrowed. He had already apologized and given away those artifacts. What more did Ye Xuan want?

“Although the Lin family’s matter has been resolved, the old guys from the Immortal Divine sect are still…”

“The Immortal Divine sect?” Gao Shun was somewhat puzzled.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a cold smile as he slowly walked up to Li Siyuan.

“This old fogey just insulted the sect master. I wonder how Senior Brother plans to resolve this matter?”

“What?” When Gao Shun heard that, he immediately flew into a rage.

“Ye Xuan, what do you want?” Li Siyuan’s face was ashen.

“Daoist Li, the Great Wilderness Divine sect has always been on good terms with the Immortal Divine sect. Our sects have never interfered with each other. Why did you insult my sect master?”

Gao Shun immediately walked over somewhat angrily.

When Sun Mobai saw this scene, he quickly climbed up with difficulty and explained with a smile.

“Daoist Gao Shun, it was my senior brother’s unintentional mistake. Please forgive him.”

“Our two sects have been on friendly terms for many years. We can’t ruin our thousands of years of friendship because of a slip of the tongue.”

“A slip of the tongue?” Ye Xuan smiled.

He had already pointed out the matter now. Next, it was up to Gao Shun.

After all, as the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Gao Shun would never allow anyone to insult the reputation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Senior Brother Gao, I’ll leave the rest to you. I still have some things to deal with, so I’ll take my leave first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned and went over to his disciples’ side.

As for what Gao Shun’s choice was, he could not be bothered to care.

The worst result would be an official war between the two sects. With his current cultivation, he had nothing to fear.

It was that old guy’s fault for having so many screws loose in his brain.

Of all people to insult, he had to insult Gongsun Shouyue.

As the sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Gongsun Shouyue’s reputation was equivalent to the reputation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

In addition, Li Siyuan was merely an elder of the Immortal Divine sect. If even an elder dared to insult their sect master, did this not mean that the entire sect held the Great Wilderness Divine sect in utter disregard?

“Don’t take me for a fool. Do you really think that this was just a slip of the tongue?”

Gao Shun disregarded Sun Mobai entirely. The terrifying pressure of a mystic lord realm expert instantly descended.

When everyone saw this scene, their pupils suddenly shrank. They did not expect Gao Shun to be as strong as Ye Xuan.

At the same time, everyone remembered that, in ancient times, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had dominated the continent. Were it not for certain reasons, their strength would not have fallen to where it was this day.

“Daoist Gao, this is just a small misunderstanding. We really didn’t mean to insult Sect Master Gongsun!”

Sun Mobai felt so wronged that he wanted to cry.

Just now, Ye Xuan had suppressed them, and now Gao Shun was doing the same.

Furthermore, they had all suffered injuries of varying degrees from Ye Xuan’s sword strike earlier, so they were unable to resist Gao Shun now.

“Do you really think I don’t have the ability to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake?”

“My Great Wilderness Divine sect has never had the intention to fight for power, but we are definitely not afraid of your sect!”

“If the Immortal Divine sect wants to start a war, the Great Wilderness Divine sect will welcome it with open arms,” Gao Shun said very domineeringly.

He had been holding back his anger earlier, so this was an excellent chance to vent.

Sun Mobai was distraught.

However, he also knew that he would not be able to clarify or deal with this matter by himself.

From the looks of it, he could only return and report this to the sect. Only then would this matter be resolved.

“Hmph!”

Gao Shun looked at Sun Mobai and the rest with cold eyes, and then turned and left.

Today, Gao Shun’s mood was not very good. He originally wanted to come to Qingyang City to obtain resources and benefits.

Unfortunately, he had to give someone else his treasures and artifacts instead.

Furthermore, that someone was Ye Xuan! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“It seems like the show is over. Let’s disperse!”

After Gao Shun left, everyone also left in droves, including Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy. The latter two said goodbye to Ye Xuan before leaving.

Soon, only Ye Xuan, the Su family, the Lin family, and the three elders of the Immortal Divine sect were left on the street.
