451 Fainting From Anger

As soon as she finished speaking, a powerful force suddenly surged forth from her body.

The extreme ice-cold power seemed to be able to freeze everything.

“What... What ...”

Yu Wuyuan, who had just stood up with great difficulty, instantly blanched.

The moment Zhuge Yueyue moved, he could not sense her movements at all.

At that moment, a frost flower suddenly appeared in front of Yu Wuyuan!

Moments later, it bloomed, revealing Zhuge Yueyue’s figure.

“It’s over for you!”

Zhuge Yueyue kicked Yu Wuyuan off the arena.

From the beginning to the end, Yu Wuyuan did not even have time to react.

When Yu Wuyuan landed on the floor of the square, his mind was in a daze.

He still could not understand why he had lost to Zhuge Yueyue.

The crowd was in an uproar when they saw this happen.

In the meantime, Zhuge Yueyue raised her eyebrows and looked at the judge beside her.

“Please announce the results now!”

Hearing this, the judge took a long look at Zhuge Yueyue, and then announced the result.

“In the second round of the competition in the first arena!”

“Cloud Sky peak’s Zhuge Yueyue has emerged victorious against her opponent from Hidden Sword peak!”

“Pfft!”

When the Gao Shun above saw this scene, rage filled his heart, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Teacher! Are you alright?”

When a disciple beside saw the situation, his expression immediately changed drastically, and he hurriedly walked over to support Gao Shun.

At this moment, Gao Shun was incomparably livid. Monstrous fury was burning in his heart.

Among the seven peaks of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Hidden Sword peak could be said to be the most powerful peak.

However, they had already suffered two consecutive defeats at the start of the competition.

This was a f*cking embarrassment!

Right at this time, Yu Wuyuan dragged his heavily injured body and walked back to the group, ashamed. He did not dare to raise his head to look at Gao Shun.

After all, he had boasted just now, yet not only had he been seriously injured by the other party in one move, but the other party did not even use her sword. Furthermore, he had been unceremoniously kicked off the arena, and had lost his dignity in the process.

“Teacher, I’m sorry. I have damaged Teacher’s reputation!”

Yu Wuyuan dragged his heavily injured body and knelt down in front of Gao Shun!

“Trash, you’re all trash!”

When Gao Shun saw this scene, he was infuriated and almost spat out another mouthful of blood again.

Were it not for the other chiefs present, as well as Elder Tongtian, he would have punished these disciples severely.

Just then, Zhuge Yueyue left the arena and returned to Ye Xuan’s side.

“Teacher! I didn’t fail you and won!”

Ye Xuan had naturally seen everything that had happened just now.

When he saw Gao Shun spewing out a mouthful of blood from anger, he laughed inwardly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This feeling was simply too good!

He could finally vent all of the grievances he had suffered for the past hundred years!

Were you not very arrogant? Well, try having a taste of your own medicine!

Of course, Ye Xuan remained calm on the surface. He even looked at Zhuge Yueyue with a hint of reproach.

“Yueyue, didn’t I specifically instruct you to give your Martial Uncle Gao some face? Why did you attack so ruthlessly?”

“That was your Martial Uncle Gao’s beloved disciple, a rare genius of the century. How could you severely injure him with just one kick?”

“If other people knew about this, they would definitely think that your Martial Uncle Gao’s disciple has an undeserved reputation. That would damage his reputation!”

Ye Xuan deliberately raised his voice.

When Gao Shun heard this, his face immediately turned red.

“Pfft!”

At this very moment, Gao Shun could not suppress the fury in his heart anymore, and spewed out another mouthful of blood. Furthermore, he fainted.

The cultivators all panicked when they saw this.

Gongsun Shouyue shook his head helplessly, then hurriedly went over to check on Gao Shun.

When he realized that the latter had fainted due to anger, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Sect Master, what’s wrong with Teacher? How’s his condition?” The cultivators of Hidden Sword peak asked anxiously.

Gongsun Shouyue stroked his beard and said.

“Don’t worry, your teacher was just angry. That’s why he fainted.”

“Take him back to Hidden Sword peak. He just needs to rest for a few days.”

When they heard that, they let out a sigh of relief. Following that, they hurriedly called over a few more disciples to carry Gao Shun, and then slipped away shamefully.

Seeing this, Gongsun Shouyue sighed. Then his gaze turned to Ye Xuan.

“Junior Brother Gao has always been unyielding in his actions. I hope that after this matter, there will be some improvements in the future!”

Ye Xuan’s words just now were bitingly ruthless. Although they were phrased to be well-meaning, they were obviously backhanded in nature, and intended to humiliate Gao Shun.

It was no surprise that Gao Shun had become furious.

However, what surprised Gongsun Shouyue the most was Zhuge Yueyue.

When Hua Rufeng returned, it was clear that Zhuge Yueyue had already broken through to the second level of the materialization realm. However, it was now certain that she had far exceeded that level.

Ye Xuan and his disciples were identical in nature. They all liked to remain low-key and surprise everyone with their strength.

“Hahaha! When I saw the law enforcement elder spit out blood and pass out, I felt so good!”

“Chief Ye Xuan is really too awesome. He was actually able to make a mystic lord realm expert faint from anger! He is truly worthy of our admiration!”

When Hidden Sword peak’s cultivators left, the onlookers could not help but laugh.

To think that there would be such an exciting event on the first day of the Seven Peaks competition. Everyone was looking forward to the following matches even more.

It was obvious that Gao Shun and Hidden Sword peak did not enjoy a good reputation among the other cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

‘I didn’t expect Senior Ye Xuan to have such a personality. It’s really surprising!” Mu Beichen had barely been able to restrain his laughter throughout the entire process. He had been so close to laughing out loud.
