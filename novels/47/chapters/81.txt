However, the blood and qi essence contained in a cultivator’s body was not unlimited. Once the blood and qi essence was exhausted, it was necessary to replenish it. This required plenty of time and resources.

In order to reach the peak of the core formation realm as soon as possible, the Patriarch of the Xuanyin sect did not hesitate to mobilize the entire Xuanyin sect. He ordered the Xuanyin sect cultivators to go to the various cities of the Great Qian Dynasty and slaughter the villages secretly to collect the qi and blood essence of the villagers.

One person’s qi and blood essence might not be enough, but if the qi and blood essence of tens of thousands, or even millions, were collected, it would accumulate to an extremely terrifying amount!

The reason why the Patriarch of the Xuanyin sect made such a choice was also very simple.

He was already old, and had one foot in the grave. The growth of the qi and blood essence in his body had slowed down, which made it almost impossible for him to reach the peak of the core formation realm in his lifetime.

This was why he had chosen to undertake such an extreme operation.

However, Ye Xuan was different from him.

He was young and vigorous, and his qi and blood essence was growing rapidly. Moreover, he had awakened the Sword Overlord and the innate dual-spirit physiques.

The stronger a cultivator’s innate bone value was, the purer their qi and blood essence would be, and it would also be endless.

Moreover, when a special physique was first awakened, an extremely large amount of energy would be generated by the cultivator’s body to help them achieve a breakthrough in their cultivation.

It was because of this that Ye Xuan was able to reach the peak of the core formation realm.

The sword qi generated by the Sword Overlord physique was extremely overbearing, and imbued his attacks with a strong destructive power.

The awakening of the innate dual-spirit physique not only further strengthened his attack power, but also ensured his body had an endless supply of power due to the wood attribute.

In other words, even if Ye Xuan did not use any cultivation methods or high-level martial techniques, and did not even need to use sword intent, he would still be invincible among core formation realm cultivators.

Normally, cultivators would not have two different special physiques, but because of the system, Ye Xuan had perfectly fused the two physiques!

After sensing the surging power inside his dantian, Ye Xuan could not help but let out a long howl. He felt invincible.

Ye Xuan knew that this was an illusion caused by the breakthrough, but it still put him into a good mood.

Not only had he successfully helped Li Qingyan become an alchemist, but he had also reached the peak of the core formation realm. Moreover, thanks to the system reward, he had become a third-rank alchemist.

“My dear disciple, I really love you to death!”

Ye Xuan patted Li Qingyan’s head and said with a smile.

“Huh?”

Li Qingyan could not help but be stunned when she heard this, and then her face suddenly turned red. Her heart beat rapidly, and her small hands clutched the corner of her clothes tightly. Her face was full of nervousness.

“Now that your strength has greatly improved, you need to familiarize yourself with the power in your body for some time. In your spare time, remember to revise the alchemy knowledge I taught you!”

Ye Xuan instructed her, then waved his sleeve and left!

However, before he left, he specifically checked his and Li Qingyan’s attributes.

Li Qingyan

Comprehension value: 320

Innate bone value: 104

Ye Xuan

Comprehension value: 488

Innate bone value: 596

…

Because she had awakened the dual-spirit physique, Li Qingyan had also advanced to the second level of the purple spirit realm.

Once a cultivator’s innate bone value exceeded 500, the difficulty of upgrading became higher and higher.

Therefore, even though Ye Xuan’s awakened innate dual-spirit physique was stronger than Li Qingyan’s, the level of improvement was not as great as the latter.

Qingyun sect, Fifth mountain peak.

“Failed again!”

A voice filled with unwillingness could be heard in the hall, followed by the sound of a pill furnace exploding at the same time!

Very quickly, Situ Yufei walked out of the pill refining room, looking rather disheveled.

Given his strength, a mere explosion would not affect him. However, because he had failed to refine the soul-returning pill many times, he had been filled with dispirited thoughts, and directly allowed the flames from the explosion to pounce on him.

It was precisely because of this that Situ Yufei’s face was currently covered in dirt.

“I’ve studied it so many times. What exactly went wrong?” Situ Yufei pulled at his hair, his brows were tightly knitted together.

A third-grade soul returning pill was a medium difficulty third-grade pill, but to him, it was indeed very difficult, and the success rate was very low.

Situ Yufei could refine ordinary third-grade pills, but he struggled to refine the soul-returning pill.

He had already attempted it five times, but had failed each time without exception.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, the sound of moving air could be heard.

“Ye Xuan?”

Seeing this, Situ Yufei’s eyes lit up.

“I’ve read your books, so it’s time I returned them to you!”

Then, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and a pile of books suddenly appeared in the hall.

“So that’s why you came. I thought you were here to refine pills!”

Seeing this, Situ Yufei felt disappointed. Then, he casually put the books into his storage ring.

“What’s wrong with you? Did you try to refine some high-level pills?”

Ye Xuan looked at Situ Yufei’s disheveled hair and dusty face and almost laughed out loud.

“Soul-returning pill!” Situ Yufei replied, with a dispirited look.

“Do you have any leftover medicinal herbs now?” Ye Xuan asked.

“Do you want to refine the soul-returning pill?”

Seeing this, Situ Yufei could not help but frown. He looked at Ye Xuan, his face full of doubt.

However, the latter seemed eager to give it a try. Apparently, he had guessed correctly.

“That’s right! If I successfully refine it, the pill will belong to you. If I fail, I will compensate you for the medicinal herbs!” Ye Xuan said.

Once he became a third-rank alchemist, countless alchemy experiences, memories and knowledge had appeared in his mind out of thin air. He also wanted to see if he could successfully refine the pill.

“Ye Xuan, are you stupid? The soul-returning pill is a third-grade pill. You are not even a beginner alchemist. Why are you thinking of refining something far beyond your capabilities?”

“If you want to learn alchemy, why don’t you refine the qi gathering pill? That is the most basic beginner medicinal pill!”

Seeing this, Situ Yufei’s mouth twitched. He gave Ye Xuan an earnest suggestion.

He always felt that this guy was here to cause trouble. A guy who was not even a proper alchemist actually wanted to refine a third-grade medicinal pill. Was this guy crazy?
