After sensing her cold aura, Gongsun Zhi no longer tried to rile her up, and focused his full attention on the battle at hand.

Although he had the Flowing Cloud Sword, he could not afford to let down his guard against a powerful enemy like Zhuge Yueyue, After all, he had already personally experienced what she was capable of during their last exchange.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were filled with killing intent as she made a stabbing motion with the Cloud Heaven Sword, causing the color of the world to change.

“Freeze the world!”

With this, her extremely cold aura spread out at an even faster speed, instantly freezing her surroundings.

“Damn it!”

Gongsun Zhi started to panic, and he swung the Flowing Cloud Sword repeatedly, trying to break free from the shackles of this cold aura.

However, just as he broke free from the restraints, her figure appeared in front of him. Moments later, a loud boom was heard.

Zhuge Yueyue did not hesitate to attack with her sword. The Cloud Heaven Sword was able to display its full power in her hands, and soon, she had the upper hand and firmly suppressed Gongsun Zhi.

Under her dense rain of attacks, Gongsun Zhi’s original white robe was completely soaked in blood.

“Oh my god, this battle is really too shocking.”

“A battle between top geniuses like this is rare.”

“Every sword move they unleash is meant to kill. It’s simple, but effective!”

“Who would have thought that such a beautiful woman would be so powerful once angered? It’s really shocking.”

Everyone was extremely shocked at this moment, and the battle continued. In the blink of an eye, the surrounding mountain peaks and rivers had been destroyed.

Because he had been at a disadvantage from the beginning until now, Gongsun Zhi was burning with anger. He roared, “Get lost!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gongsun Zhi instantly swung the Flowing Cloud Sword with all his might and forced Zhuge Yueyue to retreat. He was beyond infuriated.

Ever since his debut, this was the first time he had been beaten to such a miserable state by someone. Moreover, this person was a girl!

After being forced back, Zhuge Yuetue stared at Gongsun Zhi with a cold gaze and said disdainfully, “Hehe, Immortal Divine sect? You’re nothing special after all…

Zhuge Yueyue mocked him as he had done to her, further infuriating him.

Anyone with eyes could see that Gongsun Zhi had been unable to fight back during the earlier exchanges and had been firmly suppressed by Zhuge Yueyue.

Moreover, he was so arrogant when he first appeared, and had not taken Zhuge Yueyue seriously at all. Thus, it seemed that his blustering was not backed up by strength.

This stark contrast made him so angry that he spat out a mouthful of blood. Zhuge Yueyue had learnt how to humiliate others from her teacher. It was always best to feed people a taste of their own medicine.

Holding the Cloud Heaven Sword and pointing it at Gongsun Zhi from afar, Zhuge Yueyue displayed a disdainful expression and said, “l originally thought that the Immortal Divine sect’s sword techniques were very powerful, but it seems that I set myself up for disappointment…”

“It’s the same case with you. I was hoping for a good fight, but it turned out that I was just imagining things. Damn it! I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, the entire place burst into laughter, especially Feng Xiyun. She was already clutching her stomach, laughing so hard that her entire body was trembling.

Seeing her senior sister’s solemn face as she said those words, Feng Xiyun felt that she was practically carved out from the same board as her teacher. In fact, it was as if they were exactly the same.

Hearing such words, who could restrain their anger?

Fortunately, Martial Uncle Gao was not here. Otherwise, if he saw this scene, he would recall the scene of him being humiliated by her teacher and stomp his feet in anger, right?

Hahaha!

On the other side, the Heaven Continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect’s disciples who had been insulted by Gongsun Zhi also burst into laughter.

“Hahaha!”

“This is really too satisfying. It seems that someone has finally put this arrogant fellow in his place! ”

Zhuge Yueyue!s words had ignited the crowd.

When he saw everyone laughing mockingly, the anger in Gongsun Zhi r s heart could no longer be restrained.

“B*tch!”

He was originally a proud person, and all along, he had been the one mocking people, not the other way around.

In his endless rage, the Flowing Cloud Sword began to release an even more terrifying aura, and his terrifying power erupted, causing the surroundings to tremble.

Dense divine runes seemed to condense in the sky, giving off an extremely oppressive aura.

After discovering this situation, the noisy crowd fell silent.

At this moment, they all understood very well that Gongsun Zhi was probably going to unleash his trump card. Zhuge Yueyue also turned her full focus back to the battle, not daring to be careless.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Despite her earlier words, this fellow was not an opponent she could afford to underestimate.

As expected, after Gongsun Zhi had provoked his anger, the power he released was several times stronger than before, making Zhuge Yue feel very pressured.

In fact, she was actually quite impressed.

Although this kid was very arrogant, he also had strength to back up his words.

“You damned woman! Wipe your neck clean and wait for me to take your head!”

Gongsun Zhi’s eyes were already bloodshot…
