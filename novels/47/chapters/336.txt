Moments later, from the depths of Shangguan Wan’er’s body, a terrifying ancient and chaotic sword qi suddenly erupted.

Even Ye Xuan felt threatened by its power.

At this moment, Shangguan Wan’er seemed to have transformed into an ancient great empress from the ancient era, seemingly capable of destroying the world with a swing of her sword.

Her Undying Xuan Huang sword physique had finally awakened!

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were closed as she hovered in the air. Behind her, a huge shadow appeared, which exuded an ancient and glorious aura.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes. Despite his powerful spiritual sense, he was actually unable to see the face of this huge shadow.

Her spiritual power skyrocketed, and the eyes on the blurry face on the huge shadow lit up!

Moments later, the image of the entire Destiny Divine Tower, and the various formations in the independent space Ye Xuan had created, were reflected in the eyes of the huge shadow.

Then, a mysterious wisp of ancient aura suddenly appeared within the depths of the Tianyuan continent. It instantly traversed the spatial turbulence and entered the huge shadow.

At that very moment, the entire Tianyuan continent trembled slightly. Although it was only for a brief moment, it was still not enough to escape the senses of the experts.

“What’s going on?”

“Why is my heart palpitating like this?”

The great emperor realm experts in the Tianyuan continent suddenly opened their eyes.

Although the aura they had sensed was extremely faint and weak, it was enough to make them shudder.

Despite their best efforts to trace the aura with their spiritual sense, they found nothing.

“What a terrifying aura!”

In the deepest part of the endless sea, the ancient black dragon suddenly opened its eyes.

“Who is it?”

“This power seems to have surpassed my level. It’s been hundreds of thousands of years. Is there really someone who can ascend to the upper world despite the laws here being incomplete?”

The ancient black dragon’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Although the subtle aura was fleeting, he had captured it extremely clearly.

As a second-level great emperor, he was already a pinnacle existence in the Tianyuan continent. However, that aura made his soul tremble.

Even a third-level great emperor realm expert would not have incited such a reaction.

The ancient black dragon felt uneasy.

He wanted to track down that aura, but no matter how powerful his spiritual sense was, he could not find any trace of it.

“I hope it’s just an illusion.”

No matter what, the fragment was about to be completed. At that time, he could open the realm passageway and ascend to the upper world.

“Ancient Great Empress…”

Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on the magnificent shadow in the sky, and his eyes revealed a hint of amazement.

This was Shangguan Wan’er’s previous life, a peerless great empress of the Tianyuan continent.

The moment she awakened the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, a strange memory suddenly appeared in Shangguan Wan’er’s mind.

A trace of aura that Shangguan Wan’er had left behind in her previous life had also awakened.

The ancient great empress’ strength was too powerful. Even the multiple formations Ye Xuan had setup were unable to suppress this aura.

As Shangguan Wan’er’s aura grew stronger and stronger, the huge shadow standing behind her gradually dissipated.

Buzzzzzz!

Shangguan Wan’er’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened, and dazzling light flashed across her eyes.

“Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er spoke softly.

“Congratulations!”

Ye Xuan smiled.

It seemed that Shangguan Wan’er’s strength in her previous life had been too terrifying. Even though she had awakened the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, she had not been able to completely awaken all of the memories of her previous life.

‘Eh? Why hasn’t the system given me the reward yet?’

Ye Xuan frowned.

By right, the moment Shangguan Wan’er awakened her special constitution, he should have immediately received a reward from the system.

However, some time had passed since then, and he had still yet to hear the system’s notification. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Was there a system malfunction?

However, at this moment, the long-awaited system notification finally rang out.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple to awaken the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, the host has received a randomized 10,000x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the chaos divine body!”

Boom!

A chaotic aura from the depths of the world suddenly manifested itself and gathered around Ye Xuan’s body at an indescribable speed.

Ye Xuan’s body suddenly trembled, and a terrifying sword qi erupted.

As this ancient aura rippled out, the entire Destiny Divine Tower trembled. It felt as if all living things would submit to it.

“Teacher!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression changed.

Just now, the high-grade armor that Ye Xuan had given her had been instantly torn to pieces by the terrifying sword qi.

Thankfully, her special constitution had awakened, so her physical body had become extremely strong, and had remained unharmed.
