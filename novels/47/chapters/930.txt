931 It’s Her

Seeing Ye Xuan easily pocketing the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit, the onlookers were completely dumbfounded. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Oh my god… Is this really happening?”

“Oh my god, this Thunder-Devouring Beast is a fake, right?”

“As a powerful Thunder-Devouring Beast, why is it so shameless? It gave up the treasure for a woman?”

“This Thunder-Devouring Beast is probably a virgin, right?”

At this moment, everyone was in a daze. Who could have expected that a descendant of a divine beast was actually a big idiot?

Even Yanran was dumbfounded by what was happening. It was to the point that she felt that she could not continue watching this farce.

After taking a serious look, she even felt that this Thunder-Devouring Beast and Ye Xuan seemed to look a little similar.

“Haha!”

Ye Xuan happily put the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit into his storage space. Mission accomplished!

“Very good, very good.”

The Scarlet Blood Spirit Fruit was releasing a dazzling divine light, which meant that it was ripe and ready to consume. He reckoned that if he ate it, he would definitely be able to reach the eternal realm.

However, it would be too wasteful to do that. He glanced at Yanran, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“Not bad, you are very sensible. From today onward, you will be my little brother. In the future, when you go out, if anyone dares to bully you, then you can directly use my name to scare them off.”

“I have to take a good look at who is audacious enough to bully my subordinate.”

Ye Xuan’s domineering words made the Thunder-Devouring Beast extremely excited.

“Hehehe, Big Brother, I was right about you!”

After thinking about it carefully, the beast became even more excited. It seemed that its new big brother was someone with a powerful background!

At the thought of this, the corners of the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s mouth curled up slightly, and its smile appeared unrestrained. It wanted to give it a go and provoke someone and then say its big brother’s name to see if it was as useful as its big brother said.

In recent years, it had been living a tough life in the ancient palace, so it really wanted to let loose.

However, after thinking about it seriously for a moment, the Thunder-Devouring Beast said embarrassedly, “I… Big Brother…”

Seeing that it was not able to articulate itself properly, Ye Xuan was puzzled and said, “Why can’t you speak clearly? Hurry up and tell me.”

Hearing this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast made up its mind and said, “Big Brother, you just said that you would find me a beautiful woman. You can’t forget about this most important matter.”

Looking at his anxious expression, Ye Xuan laughed out loud.

“Hehe, alright, alright, I definitely won’t forget about this.”

Ye Xuan agreed without hesitation. He had never expected that this matter was much more important than the immortal heavenly treasure to this beast.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s promise, the Thunder-Devouring Beast relaxed.

‘Heavens, don’t misjudge me. I’m not the kind of beast that values beauty.’

‘I just did this because I didn’t want to disappoint my ancestors. I have to make descendants. Otherwise, I’m afraid I would really go extinct.’

‘I’m probably the only one left in the Thunder-Devouring Beast lineage, so if I don’t raise my children and grandchildren soon, when I get old or something happens, perhaps my race might die out for good.’

The Thunder-Devouring Beast kept comforting itself in its heart. When it thought of the beautiful days in the future, a bright smile instantly appeared on its face.

Ye Xuan couldn’t help but laugh when he saw his happy appearance. He thought about it seriously…

What kind of woman should he find for this fellow?

There was no hope of finding someone of the same race for him. He could only start with other races. After all, its bloodline was rather pure, so it would be able to pass down its bloodline regardless, right?

‘Oh right, if it really doesn’t work, why don’t we focus on the three-headed Golden Crow in the East Sea first?’

He vaguely recalled seeing a Nine-tailed Sparrow emitting seven-colored divine light when he had just stepped into the ancient palace.

This Nine-Tailed was also very beautiful. Should he choose her?

‘Hehe, it’s her then!’

Ye Xuan made his decision without hesitation. Besides, she had an extremely noble bloodline and should be quite compatible with the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

However, whether or not the Nine-tailed Sparrow would take a fancy to the Thunder-devouring Beast was something that was worth considering.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan said, “Little Thunder, I’ve already helped you choose a beautiful woman.”

However, if you want to successfully attract her attention, you need certain skills, without which she might just leave you high and dry.”

“Then what should I do?”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the Thunder-Devouring Beast immediately became nervous.
