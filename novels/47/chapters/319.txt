320 Frantic Fighting

However, at this moment, the rest of the Human King realm experts roared and unleashed their strongest techniques.

One of the human King realm experts held an ice scepter in his hand. It flashed with divine light as his powerful ice intent gushed out and froze the waves.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

At the same time, an earth-shaking fist rose into the sky and landed on the water dragon’s body.

!!

Perfect-level fist intent!

The water dragon’s body exploded.

However, at the same time, the powerful energy shockwaves from the impact swept toward that human expert.

Moments later, another human expert waved his hand, and condensed a powerful energy barrier that protected that human expert from the shockwaves.

Hu!

That human expert took a deep breath, but he did not dare to relax.

Similar situations had already played out countless times, and each time they would emerge battered, but unscathed.

“Keke! Humans, stop struggling! If you surrender now, we promise we’ll let you live as captives among us. However, if you wait until our other King realm expert arrives, what awaits you will only be death!”

“The coastal areas of the Huangyu Zone have already been conquered by us. Why do you still have to struggle?”

“In less than ten years, all of your territories will belong to the sea race!”

The Yaksha King realm expert at the center of the formation had a smug smile on his face, and his eyes were full of ridicule.

Hearing this, the human experts frowned.

There was still another sea race King realm expert who had not shown himself?

The situation was dire!

The top human King realm experts were at a stand-off with the top sea race King realm experts. If these Saint King realm experts started fighting, the battle would have reached a critical point of no return.

There were also experts above the Saint King realm on both sides, but if these experts attacked, the entire Tianyuan continent would be plunged into misery and suffering.

The Tianyuan continent was vast and filled with countless races. It was also divided into the Eastern, Western, Southern, Northern, and Central territories, which were in turn surrounded by the endless ocean. The stormy sea was the area closest to the Tianze Zone, which lay in the Southern Territory of the Tianyuan continent.

This was why it had been invaded first.

In the history of the Tianyuan continent, the sea race and the human race had fought countless wars. During one such war, the fight between them had almost resulted in mutual destruction when the supreme experts of both races took action.

It was precisely because of this lesson that the top experts from both races held themselves back to prevent a repeat of that disaster.

…

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Right at this moment, the sea race experts gathered the power of the formation again and blasted it toward the group of human experts.

Another round of frantic fighting began.

Then, a few hours later, a powerful aura suddenly filled the spatial turbulence. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It was a Yaksha middle-stage Human King realm expert!

“Hahaha! He’s finally here!”

“Puny humans, your time of death has arrived!”

“Damn it!”

“Run!”

The human experts looked at each other and chose to unleash their strongest trump cards in an attempt to escape.

However, the sea race experts were prepared, and used their own trump cards to empower the formation to restrain the human experts.

Boom!

The new sea race expert joined the formation, strengthening it even further.

“Run? Do you think you can escape?”

The formation pulsed, and four huge illusory shadows appeared within it.

Each one held a huge trident, which started glowing brilliantly. Then, a powerful gravitational force engulfed the fleeing human experts.

“Damn it! Eighth-level gravity intent!”

Their movements were restrained, and even their organs were under immense gravitation pressure.

Despair washed over them. They would not be able to escape!

Just then…

The figure of a young man appeared in the spatial turbulence.

“Who are you?”

When the sea race experts saw him, they immediately became vigilant.

How did they not sense his arrival?

Could it be that he had comprehended spatial intent?
