378 Cloud Sky Sword Technique

In the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect, Gao Shun’s status was second only to Gongsun Shouyue’s. He could be said to be second only to one person and above ten thousand people.

Gao Shun was the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. He held the power of life and death over many in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, so how would Ye Xuan dare to be his enemy?

“Hmph! If I hadn’t gone to Cloud Sky peak with the sect master yesterday, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have known that this fellow had concealed everything so well!”

“We’ve been underestimating him for the past hundred years, and now he’s actually become an uncontrollable factor!”

“However, he has already revealed all of his trump cards. This time, I will trample on him ruthlessly in front of all the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and completely suppress him!’

“There are less than three months until the Seven Peaks competition. You should stay in the cultivation room and work hard on your cultivation,” Gao Shun looked at Gao Tianyu and said.

“En!” Gao Tianyu nodded.

Although he loved women, he would never allow it to interfere with things important to the family, especially matters his father regarded as vital.

“Don’t worry, Father. We’ll definitely win this time!”

“Don’t be careless. Go and cultivate.”

Gao Shun waved his hand.

Just after Gao Tianyu left, a young man walked into the hall with an excited expression on his face and knelt down respectfully in front of Gao Shun.

“Teacher! I’ve already reached the second level of the mystic meridian realm!”

His heart was filled with joy.

He had spent a few days and had already passed the stage of sensing the world’s spiritual energy. Furthermore, he had advanced to the second level of the mystic meridian realm. He believed that this would earn him a new level of respect from his teacher.

Hearing this, Gao Shun could not help but raise his eyebrows. Zhuge Yueyue from Cloud Sky peak appeared in his mind and he looked at the young man with disdain.

This young man was the disciple that Gao Shun had fought with Liang Dahai for in the meeting hall. He was also the only one among the surviving villagers who had a divine bone.

He had thought that he had obtained a treasure, but now that he was comparing the two, he felt inexplicably dissatisfied.

He had spent five whole days to break through to the second level of the mystic meridian realm. He should learn from Zhuge Yueyue, who had already reached the fourth level of the mystic meridian realm.

“What’s there to be proud of over this small achievement?” Gao Shun said coldly, “You’ve only broken through to the second level of the mystic meridian realm, yet you’re kicking up a huge fuss over it. You should know better than this!”

When the young man heard this, he was terrified and his body trembled.

Previously, his teacher’s opinion of his cultivation progress was quite different. Why did his teacher’s attitude change so drastically within just a short day?

Was taking five days to reach the second level of the mystic meridian realm really that slow?

Gao Shun looked at that young man’s terrified appearance, and he got even angrier.

They both had the divine bones, yet why did Ye Xuan’s disciple cultivate faster than his did?

Did this not mean that he was not as good a teacher as Ye Xuan?

How was that possible? He was far more powerful, and in terms of teaching disciples, he was absolutely one of a kind. How could he be inferior to a piece of trash?

The young man’s name was Xiao Feng, and his face was full of frustration. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had thought that his teacher would be overjoyed once he told him about his breakthrough, but he did not expect to anger his teacher instead.

“Master, I know I was wrong. I will work harder in my cultivation in the future and not let you down,” Xiao Feng quickly kowtowed a few times.

“Alright, I understand. You may leave,” Gao Shun said expressionlessly. A hint of impatience flashed across the depths of his eyes.

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue, he did not have much hope for Xiao Feng.

He could only pin all his hopes on Gao Tianyu and hope that his precious son would not let him down.

…

When the first wisp of purple aura rose from the East, Zhuge Yueyue was already listening to Ye Xuan’s teachings in the courtyard.

“Little girl, do you know why I want you to start cultivating in the morning?”

“It’s because when the East spits out the first rays of light, the spiritual energy of the world will be filled with the purple aura, making it even denser than normal. This is very beneficial to cultivators.”

“Furthermore, you have to understand that the strong prey on the weak in the mystic world. Other than the native mystic world cultivators, there are also many geniuses who have ascended from the lower planes.”

“If you want to survive in this world, you can only rely on your own strength,” Ye Xuan sat cross-legged and said softly.

Zhuge Yueyue listened attentively, afraid that she would miss a word from her teacher.

“Today, I will teach you the Cloud Sky sword technique! The Cloud Sky sword technique is also the legacy sword technique of Cloud Sky peak, which is a branch of the sword technique taught within the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“After much research by the preceding chiefs of Cloud Sky peak, the technique has been improved to its current state.”

“This sword technique is quite special. One must practice and cultivate it over time in order to completely master it.”

“As long as you keep practicing, one day, not only will you be able to master the sword technique, you might even have the chance to comprehend the legendary sword intent!”

“Disciple will heed Teacher’s instructions! I will definitely live up to Teacher’s expectations,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a determined look.

“That’s for the best! The Cloud Sky sword technique focuses on the clouds and the sky. Specifically, it emphasizes movement techniques!”

“Although it looks like a sword dance on the surface, it actually borrows the power of the clouds in the sky to launch its attacks.”

“The sword technique is ethereal by nature. With only one strike, it can penetrate the opponent’s defenses and defeat him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan casually broke off a piece of bamboo and said to Zhuge Yueyue, “I’ll personally demonstrate it for you. After you experience it, I’ll teach you the sword technique.”

“If you encounter a bottleneck in your cultivation, you can come and ask me at any time.”

Ye Xuan did not use the Cloud Heaven sword because it was too powerful. If he did not control it well, it was likely to destroy the entire Cloud Sky peak.

With Ye Xuan’s current heaven realm strength, he would be able to go toe-to-toe with a mystic lord realm expert if he used the Cloud Heaven sword.

After all, Ye Xuan cultivated the chaos heart technique, so the spiritual power in his body was extremely pure. Every wisp of spiritual power was condensed after being tempered countless times, and contained amazing power.

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue immediately focused herself and stared at Ye Xuan attentively.

“Teacher, I’m ready!”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded, and the bamboo stick in his hand suddenly rippled in a mysterious way, transforming into a sword qi that was filled with the power of the sky.

At the same time, mist suddenly appeared under Ye Xuan’s feet. The sword qi seemed to dance with the wind, a mysterious pattern suddenly appeared behind him.

At this moment, the bamboo stick in Ye Xuan’s hand gently swept forward.

A stream of air visible to the naked eye suddenly swept out, and wherever the sword qi passed, bamboo plants were sliced in half.
