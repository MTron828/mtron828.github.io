666 Li Hong (Part 2)

The flames in Feng Xiyun’s hand were indeed not the Heaven Burning Flames, but they were bona fide heaven-grade flames.

Furthermore, if these flames were cultivated and nurtured, they would be able to reach the level of the true Heaven Burning Flames.

After seeing Feng Xiyun’s charming appearance, Li Hong swooned. He swept his lecherous gaze up and down, before saying, “This girl is really beautiful. However, she is not my woman. What a pity…”

As soon as he finished speaking, the black saber in his hand flashed as he attacked, trying to catch her off guard.

Feng Xiyun’s expression remained calm as she stretched out her hand and slapped the back of the black saber, easily diverting it.

Then, she hurled the ball of flames in her hand at him, when released terrifying waves of energy, forcing him to dodge and step back.

From the first clash, Li Hong had not gained any advantage at all, which shocked him. Her flames were extraordinary, and her technique was also mysterious.

Given the current situation, it seemed rather difficult for him to get close to her.

“Damn it!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As he said this, Li Hong once again drew his saber and slashed at Feng Xiyun. The black saber beams sealed off all of her escape routes.

However, she still somehow managed to mysteriously dodge these saber beams every time.

After unleashing dozens of attacks in succession, Li Hong lost his patience.

He had already confidently told his master that he would definitely eliminate these two people. However, things were not going as planned.

“Tsk, you damned girl, is that all you have? If that’s the case, then let’s end it now!”

After saying that, Li Hong unleashed his full strength.

“He’s actually… a peak-level void realm expert!”

Feng Xiyun was shocked by this. She was a middle-stage void realm cultivator, and with the help of her flames, she could resist his advanced-stage void realm-level attacks.

Now that things had been turned up a notch, she would not be able to cope if things remained the same.

Thinking this, Feng Xiyun did not hesitate, andquietly took out her Godsaber and closed her eyes.

Moments later, Feng Xiyun’s figure seemed to have disappeared from everyone’s vision.

Immediately after, her killing intent was unleashed, combined with the power of her flames.

Seeing this scene, the people present had their mouths wide open.

“Heavens… This killing intent is too dense. What sort of technique is that?” Liu Yun said in a trembling voice.

“Could it be that she’s using a brand new heaven-grade divine power?”

In the sky, Li Hong stared at Feng Xiyun incredulously.

He had not expected Feng Xiyun to have grasped so many heaven-grade divine powers.

“Tsk, it doesn’t matter. Even a heaven-grade divine power won’t change the outcomes now.”

After saying that, Li Hong waved the black saber around, causing it to release a blood-red cold light, as if a terrifying beast was baring its teeth.

At this moment, the disciples present could not help but turn pale. They felt very afraid.

“This move… It’s the Supreme Divine sect’s heaven-grade divine power, Beast Gaze!”

When Daoist Black Iron saw this scene, he could not help but feel a little angry.

He was the leader of the Supreme Divine sect, yet Daoist Gu Hao had not taught him this move. Instead, he had taught it to Li Hong.

What did this mean?

‘Could it be that Master still doesn’t trust me?’

At the thought of this, Daoist Black Iron took a long look at his master and secretly made a decision in his heart.

“Beast Gaze…” Gao Shun muttered to himself. He was a little flustered. It was really hard to say who would win or lose in the current situation.

Ye Xuan was also worried at this moment. He knew that even with the help of the Godsaber and her heaven-grade divine powers, there was no way she could defeat Li Hong’s Beast Gaze.

After all, her cultivation was still lacking in comparison to Li Hong’s, and not just by one minor realm either.

It was precisely because of this that Ye Xuan could only place his hopes on Xiang Yun.

“Little girl, whether or not your second sister can escape this crisis will depend on you.”

“Let’s see how terrifying your upper limit is!”

Ye Xuan stared at the screen in the sky without blinking.

At this moment, Li Hong was ready to attack. He said coldly, “Let’s end this farce now! Die!”

In the blink of an eye, a terrifying illusory beast phantom condensed. Two dark red lights were released from its eyes that shot toward Feng Xiyun.

Feng Xiyun had no choice but to use her Godsaber and flames to resist this attack. Moments later, Feng Xiyun fell to the ground with a loud bang.

The brief collision had pushed her back and knocked her off her feet.
