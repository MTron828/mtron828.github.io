745 Important Meeting (Part 1)

Li Dahai also stood up at this moment. He looked at Gao Shun with admiration and said, “Senior Brother Gao, I’m really shocked by your words today.”

“Your words are very reasonable. Although our Great Wilderness Divine sect is not an invincible existence, we still have a certain degree of confidence in our ability to protect this land.”

“It’s just a disaster. We just have to make proper preparations for it!”

Hearing Li Dahai’s words, the sense of justice in the people’s hearts was drawn out.

“Haha!”

!!

A laugh rang out. Then, Yuelun also stood up and said, “Senior brother Ao, this might also be a rare opportunity for us…”

“Oh? Why?”

Hearing this, everyone was stunned. The corner of Ao Lei’s mouth curled up slightly. Finally, someone had spoken the words within his heart.

He had just maintained his silence because he wanted to wait for someone to share his thoughts.

Over the past few days, he had been thinking about this matter and had even stayed up all night.

As the grand elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, every decision he made was related to the fate of the sect itself.

It was precisely because of this that he had to consider this decision carefully

Yuelun said calmly, “Every time we encounter a major disaster, it is during the time when fate energy is the easiest to obtain. This is to reward the person who renders the greatest merit.”

“This disaster came very suddenly. It’s not an exaggeration to call it a catastrophe. We all know how serious it is.”

“If we can protect these commoners, then we will naturally render great merit and obtain fate energy.”

“If we really succeed in overcoming the disaster, then our Great Wilderness Divine sect will definitely become the number one sect!”

Hearing this, everyone was dumbfounded.

They realized that this was probably why there was no news from the Jade Lake Divine sect, as they too were probably waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of this disaster too.

This was undoubtedly a gamble. If they made the right bet, they would benefit endlessly. However, if they failed, everything they had might be destroyed.

“Do we want to bet too?”

The temptation was simply irresistible.

Moreover, according to the current situation, the ordinary people seemed to have been abandoned. If the Great Wilderness Divine sect stood up to protect them at this moment, they would definitely be remembered and grateful.

Ao Lei laughed heartily. This was a gamble, but one that he felt was worth taking. However, even he could not make a decision on this matter lightly, which is why he had consulted Daoist Yi Feng about it yesterday. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Unfortunately, the latter did not provide a clear answer, only saying that no matter what decision was made, he and the other elders would do their best to support the sect.

Thus, this meeting with the various chiefs was convened.

After sweeping his gaze across the room, he said, “What does everyone think we should do?”

“Senior Brother Ao, I think it’s worth a try,” Gao Shun said without hesitation, and the other chiefs immediately expressed their agreement.

“Senior Brother Ao, let’s go all out this time. Things are not hopeless at this point. Besides, protecting the common people has always been the creed of our sect!”

“That makes sense. Even without the promise of fate energy, we should still protect them!”

The various chiefs expressed their thoughts one after another.

After hearing what they said, Ao Lei laughed very happily. These people were truly worthy of leading the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Although they would occasionally bicker and compete with each other, when they really encountered a major problem, they would unite without hesitation.

After looking at the crowd, Ao Lei turned his gaze to Zhuge Yueyue. He understood what this little girl was thinking, but wanted her to speak her mind. Furthermore, Ye Xuan was the sect’s trump card, so they also needed her to represent his stance on the matter.

However, she still remained silent, which almost made him lose his mind.

They had already said so much, so why was she still holding back? She was the young one, so should she not be filled with passion instead of old men like him?

After a while, he could not help but ask, “Martial Niece Zhuge, what do you think?”
