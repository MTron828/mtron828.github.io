619 Eaten What?

At this time, Gao Shun was thankful that Gao Tianyu had already grown up and was not of the same generation as Ye Xuan newest disciple. Otherwise, he would definitely have been beaten up.

Who knew where Ye Xuan had brought this disciple back from?

It seemed that this little girl was really a tough one. She was so young, yet so strong.

The children at the study hall were not cultivators, but they had great potential.

!!

Moreover, their families would usually use a lot of heavenly treasures to strengthen their cultivation foundation so that they would have a better chance of going further on the path of cultivation.

However, so what?

They were still beaten up by this little girl that Ye Xuan had taken in.

Ye Xuan smiled helplessly and did not say anything. It seemed that he had become the butt of the joke today thanks to Xiang Yun.

“Junior Brother Ye, you should go over and take a look first. It won’t be good if this little girl causes some more trouble later.”

Ao Lei was laughing as he spoke. The originally serious atmosphere had suddenly become much more light-hearted.

“That’s right, Junior Brother, you’d better hurry over. I’m afraid that if you don’t go over soon, the children might be crippled by her,” Elder Huang said helplessly.

Ye Xuan’s newest disciple was too much of a troublemaker.

Originally, he had thought that this little girl was a very obedient and disciplined child.

However, who would have thought that only a short while later, even he, who had tried to stop the fighting, had been punched a few times to the point where his face had turned blue and purple.

Although this little girl was young, she was strong!

Moreover, this little girl was Ye Xuan’s disciple, so he did not dare to hit back. He did not want to offend a supreme realm expert for no reason.

“Alright, I’ll go over and take a look first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan accompanied Elder Huang to the study hall.

Upon seeing this, Li Dahai and the other chiefs quickly followed.

No matter what, the children there were still the descendants of their families or their disciples’ families, so it would be good if they made an appearance.

After a while, they arrived at the study hall and could see something going on through the windows.

What could be seen was a little girl standing on the table in a very domineering manner. She was even holding a broom in her hand, and wielding it like a staff.

At the corner of the wall, a group of children could be seen.

Xiang Yun spoke proudly, “What is this? Did Big Sister lie to me? She said that the children here are quite strong, but none of them can fight. They’re all weaklings!”

Seeing how arrogant Xiang Yun was, a boy with two panda eyes stepped out of the group.

Although he looked like he was about to cry, he still held his head high and said, “How dare you make me look like this! Don’t you know who my father is?”

“My father is the chief of Sword Spirit peak. Just you wait, you stinky girl. I’m going to call my father over to give you a good beating!”

“Hmph!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xiang Yun snorted and retorted, “My teacher is the chief of Cloud Sky peak. Who the hell is your father? Go back to the corner and continue squatting there!”

“This…”

Li Dahai, who was standing outside the window, was speechless when he heard that.

Ye Xuan was sweating at this time. This girl really did not mince her words at all.

“Ahem, Senior Brother Li, don’t take the words of a child seriously. They mean no harm. Just bear with it.”

Li Dahai’s expression was dark, and he felt pained when he saw his child in this state.

This child of his was a treasure. He was usually pampered, but Ye Xuan’s disciple had beaten him until he had panda eyes.

How was he going to explain this to his wife?

He would probably not hear the end of this from her.

However, what could he do?

The little girl was Ye Xuan’s disciple, and he was no match for Ye Xuan.

Inside the study hall, Li Yi became even angrier after hearing Xiang Yun’s words.

After all, in his opinion, his father was an invincible existence. He would never allow anyone to speak ill of him.

However, he did not know how to refute her. After thinking for a while, he said, “What are you proud of? My dad is good with spears, but your master doesn’t know anything!”

“Hmph! Who says he doesn’t? In any case, my teacher’s swordsmanship beats the sh*t out of your father’s spearmanship!”

“What did you say?!”

Li Yi became even more anxious, and he said without thinking, “My father has eaten sh*t before. Has your teacher eaten sh*t before?”

“Oh my god…”

After hearing these words, everyone’s mouth fell open in shock.

Immediately after, Ao Lei, Gao Shun, Yuelun, and Ye Xuan all turned to look at Li Dahai in unison, their eyes filled with disbelief.

At that moment, Li Dahai’s face was extremely dark.

‘Just wait, you brat. I’m going to give you a proper beating today.’

Then, Ye Xuan, who was still gloating, suddenly moved. Before Xiang Yun could respond, he teleported behind her and covered her mouth tightly.

Although her mouth was covered, Ye Xuan could vaguely guess what she was about to say, and it was not something good.

‘Fortunately, I was fast enough. Otherwise, I would become a laughingstock again.’

“Mmmff…”

...

Even though Xiang Yun could not say anything now, she was still thinking to herself, ‘Who dares to treat me like this?’

She turned around fiercely, only to see that it was her teacher. She was shocked.

A second later, the originally overbearing personality disappeared, and she said in a very aggrieved manner, “Oh, Teacher… These kids think that I’m easy to bully because I’m a girl.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan felt even more embarrassed and did not know what to say.

Li Dahai had also entered the room at this moment. When he saw the child with panda eyes in the corner, his expression darkened further.
