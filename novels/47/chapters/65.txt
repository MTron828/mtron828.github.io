Chapter 66: They Are Really Good At Bragging

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After Ye Xuan left with Yue and the others, he did not return to the Qingyun sect immediately. Instead, he chose to set off tomorrow.

In the meantime, the leader of the Mad Saber sect used lightning-fast methods to completely destroy the Chen family!

After completely destroying the Chen family, the leader of the Mad Saber sect hurriedly ran to the Li family’s residence to see Ye Xuan!

After obtaining the latter’s permission, he left as if he had been granted amnesty.

Then, the leader of the Mad Saber sect used all of his strength to flee the city frantically.

“Tomorrow, we’ll set off for the Qingyun sect. The sect competition should be starting soon!”

Ye Xuan looked at his two disciples and said slowly.

“Indeed, we’ve already been away from the sect for quite awhile.”

Yue replied emotionally.

Although they had only been away from the sect for less than ten days, it felt like a long time had passed. Moreover, when she thought of her own matters, she felt that this period of time was even more incredulous.

She had suddenly become Ye Xuan’s disciple, and the latter had performed spiritual power infusion for her.

Then, he gave her high-level cultivation methods and martial techniques. He was even generous enough to give her a powerful mount!

In addition, he brought her back to Linshi village to take revenge. After that, he traveled to Jiangqing City and took Li Qingyan as his disciple.

Although not much time had passed, she felt as if she had lived for a lifetime. It was completely different from the boring days she had in the Qingyun sect.

Within this period of time, she miraculously became a genius cultivator who, from the fourth level of the refinement realm, had awakened the Sword Jade physique and become a fifth-level true essence realm cultivator!

Of course, Ye Xuan’s cultivation had also undergone great changes.

Although Yue was not sure of Ye Xuan’s current cultivation level, her intuition told her that her teacher’s strength was very likely to have reached the same level as the sect leader.

If Yue had known that Ye Xuan had already reached the middle stage of the golden core realm, she would probably have been left speechless. Moreover, she was sure that if the outside world learned of Ye Xuan’s lightning-fast cultivation speed, the entire Great Qian Dynasty would be shocked.

As the sun rose and the first drops of morning dew condensed, Ye Xuan brought Yue, Li Qingyan, and the others back to the Qingyun sect.

…

Just a few days after Ye Xuan left Jiangqing City, a group of cultivators with mysterious identities came to Jiangqing City.

They dressed very normally and pretended to be ordinary mercenaries who had wandered over.

Therefore, they did not attract much attention. They were all here to do the same thing, which was to inquire about Ye Xuan in the various restaurants and markets.

They were all members of the Xuanyin sect.

“Isn’t the leader of the Mad Saber sect a core formation realm expert? Why would he be suppressed by Ye Xuan?”

A middle-aged man dressed in black placed his wine cup down slowly. He asked in disbelief as he looked at the cultivators who were discussing Ye Xuan’s deeds fervently.

“Haha, is this your first time here?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a cultivator with thick eyebrows and thin eyes looked at the middle-aged man indifferently.

In the entire restaurant, this person was the one who described Ye Xuan’s deeds in the most detail! Moreover, in the process of describing everything, he exuded a sense of joy, as if he himself was the person in question. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As he narrated Ye Xuan’s deeds, he imagined himself as the protagonist.With a wave of his hand, he completely suppressed the leader of the Mad Saber sect.

Once he heard the middle-aged man’s questions, his eyes lit up. Then he raised his wine glass with a natural expression and walked toward the middle-aged man.

The cultivator sat down next to the middle-aged man, poured himself a glass of wine, and drank it in one gulp. He first let out a comfortable sigh, and then slowly said,.

“Speaking of this, we have to first discuss the differences between the core formation realm and other realms!”

“As everyone knows, the refinement realm, qi transformation realm, true essence realm, and purple spirit realm, from low to high, are divided into ten levels! However, the division of the core formation realm is different!”

“The core formation realm is divided into the Xudan realm, true core realm, and golden core realm! Each realm is divided into early, middle, and advanced stages!”

“Although the leader of the Mad Saber sect is powerful, he is only an early stage Xudan realm cultivator! But Ye Xuan is different. His strength has already reached the true core realm… No, it should be said that he has stepped into the golden core realm!”

“The gap between a golden core realm expert and a true core realm expert is like a tenth-level purple spirit realm cultivator facing a first-level true essence realm cultivator. As such, there was no way the leader of the Mad Saber sect could beat Ye Xuan!”

“It is precisely because of this that Ye Xuan could easily suppress the leader of the Mad Saber sect with a simple raise of his hand!”

Not only did the cultivator describe Ye Xuan’s deeds to the middle-aged man, he also vividly described the scene of that day with body language.

Hearing this, the middle-aged man looked outwardly interested, but he sneered inwardly.

It was really ridiculous. How could Ye Xuan be a golden core realm cultivator? This guy still did not know what the golden core realm represented, right?

He had long seen through this cultivator’s strength. This person was just a sixth-level qi transformation realm cultivator!

How could a qi transformation realm cultivator sense the cultivation realm differences of a core formation realm cultivator?

Perhaps he had heard about the division of realms within the core formation realm from some unknown source. Now, based on the happenings in Jiangqing City, he was spouting nonsense about Ye Xuan being a golden core realm cultivator. Was it not all just an excuse to get a free glass of wine from someone else?

This middle-aged man was also one of the sub-leaders of the Xuanyin sect, a powerful purple spirit realm cultivator.

Most importantly, he was well aware of Ye Xuan’s serious injury.

For him to be able to survive the Five Poison powder was already a miracle. How could he have broken through to the golden core realm?

As a sub-leader of the Xuanyin sect, he was responsible for collecting information on the affairs of the other top sects. How could he not know these secrets?

Half a month ago, Ye Xuan had only been a cultivator at the middle stage of the Xudan realm. He had been seriously injured and was on the verge of death. How long had it been since then? Not only had his injury healed, but he had also directly broken through from the middle stage of the Xudan realm to the golden core realm?

If this was true, he would eat feces!

The middle-aged man inwardly denied the cultivator’s speculation.

His guess was not wrong. This cultivator really did not know Ye Xuan’s cultivation, and he was indeed talking nonsense.

However, despite his muddle-headed drivel, he had somehow correctly guessed Ye Xuan’s true cultivation level.

The middle-aged man suppressed the impatience in his heart and listened to the cultivator describe Ye Xuan’s deeds before leaving.

A moment later, the middle-aged man met up with the other sub-leaders in the wilderness.

The few of them communicated with each other and discovered that the versions they had all heard were different.

Some of the versions were quite normal, but some were outrageous. The most exaggerated one was that someone had actually praised Ye Xuan’s strength to the heavens, saying that his cultivation level had already surpassed everyone in the Great Qian Dynasty!

Even the Great Qian royal family had to retreat in awe when facing Ye Xuan.

Seeing this scene, the middle-aged man further verified his previous guess.

“Haha, the people in this small place are like frogs at the bottom of a well. Their cultivation is average, but they are quite accomplished in bragging!”

“In the entire Jiangqing City, the strongest person has only reached the seventh level of the purple spirit realm. How knowledgeable can they be? I’m afraid that most cultivators only saw the terrifying strength of a core formation realm cultivator for the first time, right?”

The few of them looked at each other with sneers hanging from the corners of their mouths.
