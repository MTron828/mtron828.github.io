827 Golden-Furred Growler (Part 2)

That being said, Wu Kong’s arms did not show any visible signs of injuries. This cultivation technique was called the Invincible Golden Body technique, but nowhere within it was it mentioned that the user would not feel pain.

After the first clash between the two, the little monkey clearly realized how much of a disadvantage he was at without a suitable weapon.

He did not know how the golden-furred growler had created that red beam. All he knew was that it hurt!

“You piece of trash, now do you know how powerful I am?”

The golden-furred growler sneered disdainfully, which made Wu Kong very angry.

This was the second time he had suffered humiliation. The first time was at the hands of that huge ape.

“You damned beast, I’ll punch you!”

Wu Kong jumped up and sat on the golden-furred growler’s neck. It raised its big fist and punched the golden-furred growler’s head. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This drove the golden-furred growler crazy. He had never expected that this monkey would be so bold. After all, the flames released from his body were not something that any living creature could withstand.

However, the monkey seemed to be unfazed by the flames. What was going on?

Roar!

The golden-furred growler cried out in pain after being hit by the monkey.

“Great!”

Gao Shun immediately shouted excitedly, as he clapped his hands in praise.

“Serves that golden-furred growler right! That’s what you get for acting so pretentious! Beat him to death!”

Both combatants were middle-stage heaven realm experts, and had rare bloodlines. As a monkey that had been born from the seven-colored stone, Wu Kong’s bloodline was not even inferior to the golden-furred growler’s.

At this moment, both of them used the most primitive fighting method known, which was to constantly fight with their own bodies.

Thanks to the Invincible Golden Body, Wu Kong was gradually gaining an advantage. However, this advantage did not last long.

Unable to hold itself back any longer, the golden-furred growler unleashed its innate divine power!

“You damned monkey, I’ll kill you and skin you alive!”

After cursing, the golden-furred growler opened its mouth and took a deep breath before releasing another powerful wave of energy, which caught Wu Kong off guard.

It was immobilized by this wave of energy!

Everyone realized that the monkey might die.Moments later, the golden-furred growler’s body expanded as it swallowed the monkey into its stomach in an instant. It even smacked its lips.

“The monkey actually lost…”

Seeing that their representative had lost the fight, the people from the East continent felt regretful.

At this moment, people were wondering who would step forth to redeem their honor, and almost all unanimously turned to look at the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Only a small number of people looked at the forces of the Jade Lake Divine sect and the other forces.

Based on the current situation, only Zhuge Yueyue, Xiang Yun, the Reincarnation Fairy, and Mu Beichen had the ability to fight the golden-furred growler.

Their expectations were focused on Zhuge Yueyue, but…

Why did she not want to fight?

Unfortunately, her teacher had not given her permission, so she had no choice but to stay put and watch.

“Hehehe, are there really no other representatives in the East continent? Is this little monkey all there is? How embarrassing,” the golden-furred growler said mockingly.

However, at this moment, he suddenly felt an extremely intense pain in his stomach, causing his entire body to tremble.

“What happened?”

The onlookers also noticed that something was wrong with the expression of the golden-furred growler, and were confused. Hell, even the golden-furred growler was confused.

‘Could it be that the monkey is still alive after I swallowed it?’

He did not want to believe it. Every time he had swallowed a creature with this divine power, it died in the blink of an eye and was refined to fuel his own strength.

Unfortunately, Wu Kong was immune to most of the elements, so he was simply sitting there in its stomach, unharmed.

“Hehe, are you shocked?”

The little monkey shouted proudly. From his tone, everyone could tell that he was especially happy.

“You damned monkey!”
