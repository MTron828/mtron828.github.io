404 Sudden Change In Behavior

“I am Lin Dong from the Lin family of Qingyang City, and the disciple of Sun Mobai from the Immortal Divine sect.”

“May I know how I should address you two fairies? Which sect do you come from?”

“Today’s weather is quite nice. I wonder if I can have the honor to invite you two two fairies for a drink?”

Lin Dong spoke with a smile on his face, while his eyes were filled with confidence.

Normally, every time he revealed his identity, most female cultivators would be awed into following him.

!!

However, things were destined to be different today.

Upon hearing his words, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes turned even colder. She completely ignored Lin Dong.

Feng Xiyun only smiled faintly and playfully.

“Young Master Lin, this is our first time meeting, so there really is no reason for us to accompany you.”

“Furthermore, our teacher has specially instructed us not to mingle around with random suspicious people.”

“Young Master, if there’s nothing else, we’ll take our leave now.”

“Oh, one more thing. The name of the Immortal Divine sect might have worked on others, but it really means nothing to us.”

Lin Dong’s expression instantly turned cold after she spoke.

He did not expect Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun to disregard and disrespect him like this.

In all of Qingyang City, no cultivator would dare to speak to him in such a manner.

Immediately, Lin Dong’s eyes turned cold as he spoke to the guard beside him.

“Investigate the background of these two women. I want to know their identities and backgrounds.”

“Hmph! I’ve never failed to get the women I want, and that’s not about to change!”

Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and Xin’er then found seats on the top floor of a restaurant.

“Senior Sister, that person just now said that he came from the Immortal Divine sect and that he was Sun Mobai’s disciple. Does Senior Sister know him? ” Feng Xiyun asked curiously.

“Sun Mobai?”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue frowned. She pondered for a moment, then said slowly, “I’ve met him with Teacher before. He’s just a wretched old man.”

“When we surrounded the ape beast back then, Sun Mobai was present, as was Chief Yuelun from our sect.”

“There were also many heaven realm experts present who were eyeing the ape beast’s precious bone. However, in the end, Teacher was the one who obtained it, shocking everyone.”

“At that time, Sun Mobai wanted to get close to him to forge a friendly relationship. However, Teacher didn’t give him any face at all. I still remember that old man’s shocked expression to this day.”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she chuckled. She had also heard of that incident where the various experts had surrounded and attacked the ape beast, but she was unclear about the details of the incident.

It was a pity that she was not there at the time and could not witness her teacher’s prowess.

At this moment, in the Su family’s residence in Qingyang City.

“Father, mother, please have some tea!”

“You must be tired today. Your son will wash your feet for you.”

Su Tiansheng looked at Su Changhe’s filial expression with a dumbfounded look.

F*ck, was this thing in front of him really his own son?

How had he changed so drastically after leaving home to explore the world for a month?

Why was he now acting so filial?

“Son, did you get into trouble outside?”

Suddenly, Su Tiansheng seemed to have thought of something, and his tone suddenly became serious.

As the saying goes, there must be something wrong when things are abnormal. From Su Tiansheng’s perspective, Su Changhe must have caused a lot of trouble outside.

This expression of filial piety was probably his way of asking for help.

However, Su Tiansheng was also helpless. No matter what, Su Changhe was his own son. He had to clean up his mess if there was trouble.

Su Changhe stood up when he saw his father doubting him.

“Dad, what do you mean by this? I’m your biological son. I might have been a little insensible in the past, but now that I have grown up, I naturally have to be filial to you!”

“Your son has gone through many hardships to return to Qingyang City, and I just want to wash your feet. How could you think of me like that?”

Looking at Su Changhe’s sad face, Su Tiansheng’s mouth twitched.

Did I really blame this kid wrongly? In just a month, he had really become so filial?

Su Changhe’s mother, Zhang Lihong, patted Su Tiansheng’s back in annoyance when she saw this.

“What’s wrong with you? Isn’t it a good thing for Changhe to become filial? Don’t tell me you still want him to stir up trouble like before?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Su Tiansheng felt somewhat wronged. Based on Su Changhe’s previous behavior, it was only natural to suspect his motives after a sudden change like this.

“See, Father always misunderstands me,” Su Changhe grinned when he heard that. Then, he squatted down very considerately.

“In this family, it’s still Mother who loves and understands me the most.”

“Why is there a need to doubt my sincerity?”

“Mother, I’ll wash your feet now.”

Zhang Lihong was also surprised by Su Changhe’s behavior, but felt that it was a good thing.

“My good son, my love for you all these years has not been in vain.”

“Mother, as long as you Like It, I’ll wash your feet every day,” Su Changhe said with an apologetic smile.

“Silly child, the sons of our Su family are all indomitable and will become the overlords of the mystic world. How can you spend your time washing my feet every day?”

“Just knowing that you are willing is enough to satisfy me. My precious son has finally grown up.”

Zhang Lihong’s eyes were filled with love for Su Changhe.

Looking at Su Changhe washing her feet seriously, Su Tiansheng rubbed his chin and nodded with relief.

It seemed that this kid had indeed changed. He was much more sensible than before.
