Chapter 29: Two Against One, And They Still Couldn’t Win?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Dark Glacial Frost was extremely rare. Although it could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value, it needed to be refined to do so.

Unless one possessed a certain amount of strength, even if they had the Dark Glacial Frost, they could only watch it rot.

Most importantly, it could not be refined with spiritual power at all. It required true essence energy or above to refine.

Although it was true that one could refine the Dark Glacial Frost after reaching the true essence state, it would take a lot of time.

In other words, if Huang Ling and Xue Min were to refine the Dark Glacial Frost, it would take them at least a few months. However, if there was an expert to help them refine it, they would then have more time to cultivate.

Their initial idea was to ask their teacher, Lin Qing, for help when they returned to the Qingyun sect.

With the help of an empty core state cultivator, it would only take a few hours to refine the Dark Glacial Frost!

However, Ye Xuan’s strength was obviously stronger than their teacher’s. With his help, it would naturally be even faster. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Moreover, the deal Ye Xuan proposed was simply too easy to satisfy.

“If it’s good, then you can start now.”

Ye Xuan smiled, and then waved his sleeve. An invisible power enveloped Yue and the others, and they disappeared from the inn.

When Yue and the others regained their vision, they found that they had already arrived in the wilderness outside Jiaohei city.

......

Although it was late at night, it did not affect their vision at all.

“What terrifying speed!”

Seeing this, Huang Ling and Xue Min could not help but stare blankly.

What level had Elder Ye reached exactly?

This was definitely not something an empty core state cultivator could do, right?

“Oh right, when you fight each other, don’t hold back at all. Don’t worry about hurting each other. Just do your best!” Ye Xuan said.

Now that his strength had reached the early stage of the golden core state, even if these three true essence state cultivators were to fight to the death, everything would still be under his control.

“Okay!” The three of them nodded in unison.

Yue’s expression instantly turned serious. She indeed lacked practical combat experience, and she knew very well that her teacher was trying to train her in this regard.

She absolutely could not miss this opportunity. She had to give it her all.

“Xue Min, you go first!” Ye Xuan said after thinking for a moment.

“As you command, Elder Ye.”

Xue Min nodded, and then a sword appeared in her right hand. She strolled leisurely toward Yue.

As the personal disciple of an elder of the Qingyun sect, she often went out to train. It could be said that she had extremely rich practical combat experience. She was considered extremely powerful among cultivators of the same level.

Those cultivators with ordinary levels of talent, even if their cultivation levels were slightly higher than hers, would not be a match for her.

Not to mention the fact that she was currently facing a junior sister who had basically never experienced actual combat.

However, the very next second, Xue Min’s expression suddenly changed.

Weng!

The power in Yue’s body quickly started to circulate, and her fifth-level true essence state cultivation suddenly exploded forth.

“What? Yue is actually at the fifth level of the true essence state?”

Seeing this, Huang Ling and Xue Min’s expressions changed drastically.

They had noticed that Yue had entered the true essence state since she had not yet familiarized herself with her own power back then, which made it impossible for her to completely hide her spiritual power fluctuations.

However, Yue still managed to conceal a part of it. Thus, from what the two girls could sense, Yue had just entered the true essence state.

Now that Yue had completely unleashed her strength, they finally understood Yue’s true cultivation level.

Fifth-level true essence state..

She was at the same level as Huang Ling, and her cultivation level was even higher than Xue Min’s.

At that moment, Xue Min’s expression immediately turned serious.

“Senior sister, please advise!”

Yue shouted, and then she charged toward Xue Min.

Seeing this, Xue Min did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent. The true essence in her body swept out without holding anything back.

Within a short period of time, the two had exchanged close to forty moves.

Initially, Xue Min relied on her rich combat experience to gain a slight advantage but, as time passed, she gradually became exhausted.

Moreover, what surprised Xue Min the most was that Yue’s combat experience grew extremely quickly, and soon the latter had an absolute advantage in the battle.

Seeing that Xue Min was about to be unable to withstand Yue’s attacks, Huang Ling hurriedly joined the battle.

The two of them had always been training together in the outside world, and their coordination was impeccable. This turned the tides of the situation in an instant.

Yue was once again at a disadvantage.

However, it was extremely difficult for the two of them to fight Yue. As time slowly passed, who knew how many moves the three of them had exchanged.

However, at this moment, another scene that caused Huang Ling and Xue Min’s expressions to change greatly appeared.

After Yue gradually adapted to Huang Ling and Xue Min’s attacks, the Sword Jade physique in her body emitted a sharp light. The sword techniques she displayed swept across the sky. In an instant, she actually defeated Huang Ling and Xue Min!

“Alright, let’s call it a day!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan got them to stop.

Whoosh!

Seeing this, Huang Ling and Xue Min could not help but hold their breaths in astonishment. They looked at Yue with shock in their eyes!

The level of talent this master and disciple pair had was too abnormal.

Previously, they had been jealous of Yue’s luck in managing to become Elder Ye’s disciple. However, after the battle just now, the jealousy in their hearts faded away.

Yue’s comprehension value had already reached an extremely terrifying level. Had it not, it would have been impossible for her actual combat experience to have increased so quickly.

However, if the two girls knew that Ye Xuan had once infused Yue with his own spiritual power, they might have once again become jealous.

There was nothing strange about that though. This kind of treatment for disciples was simply too extravagant.

Ye Xuan once again waved his sleeve and brought Yue and the others back to the inn.

He had already promised to help Huang Ling and Xue Min refine the Dark Glacial Frost, so he naturally would not go back on his word.

At first, Huang Ling and Xue Min thought that it would take at least several hours for Ye Xuan to refine the Dark Glacial Frost, but he did it in less than fifteen minutes.

They were completely dumbfounded!

Ever since they started following Elder Ye back then in the mountain range, more and more things had happened along the way. They were almost numb to all the surprises that appeared.

As everyone knew, the speed at which a cultivator refined the Dark Glacial Frost was closely related to their strength.

In other words, the stronger the cultivator, the faster they would be able to refine the Dark Glacial Frost. Seeing that Ye Xuan did not even need fifteen minutes to refine the Dark Glacial Frost in front of them, they wondered just how strong he was?

The two looked at each other and saw the shock that was evident in each other’s eyes.

If their guess was correct, something that would shake the entire Great Qian dynasty might happen soon.

After refining the Dark Glacial Frost, Ye Xuan waved his hand gently.

Two cold streams of light instantly entered the backs of Huang Ling and Xue Min. At the same time, the power inside Ye Xuan’s body suddenly swept out, helping the two to completely absorb the Dark Glacial Frost.
