Chapter 980 - 980 Saving The Little Monkey

No matter how hard they tried, they could not escape.

“We’re in trouble…”

After her initial panic subsided, Zhuge Yueyue started to think seriously about how she could escape this disaster.

At this moment, her gaze was on the jade pendant in her hand, and she almost instinctively wanted to break it. However, she was not sure if Yanran would be able to handle this situation, and did not want to drag her into it needlessly.

After thinking about it for a while, Zhuge Yueyue put away the jade pendant without breaking it.

Boom!

A loud explosion erupted, and dark waves of energy swept out, dying the space they were in black. As everyone watched in terror, a strange shadow materialized unhurriedly from the endless abyss of the forbidden zone.

Its entire body was releasing thick black smoke and terrifying killing intent. Its face was also as pale as a corpse.

At this moment, it stuck out its tongue and licked its chin. His gaze swept around. Every time it passed by those figures with ancient bloodlines, it paused for a moment.

It was looking at them as if they were particularly delicious morsels of food. It was practically drooling.

“What a nice day it is today. So many delicacies have been delivered to my doorstep. Let me take a good look. Who should I eat first?”

Hearing this terrifying voice, everyone trembled, and their backs were already soaked in sweat.

At this moment, rays of golden light flashed!

Looking closely, they saw the little monkey smashing the Jingu Staff toward the huge demon king.

“Who dares to steal my limelight? I’ll give you a beating first!”

Seeing the little monkey’s reckless actions, everyone’s jaws dropped in shock.

“Oh my god, does this little monkey want to die?”

“Isn’t this too f*cking reckless?”

Everyone present seemed to have been frozen in place, unable to move. However, this little monkey seemed to be unaffected and actually dared to attack the demon king.

Should he not have run away in such a critical situation? Why did he end up attacking the demon king instead?

Boom!

The sky trembled, and even the thick dark clouds were scattered.

The demon king casually grabbed the little monkey’s Jingu Staff and stared at him with disdain.

“This is interesting. It’s actually a creature nurtured by the heavens. Was it born to deal with the upcoming calamity? Hehe…”

With just a casual glance, the demon king had already figured out the origin of the little monkey.

The little furry monkey was also very shocked at this moment, and immediately realized that he was in big trouble this time and had to escape as soon as possible.

The little furry monkey’s thoughts quickly spun. Unfortunately, the demon king had already taken a fancy to him. A huge palm instantly grabbed him firmly.

The demon king stuck out its tongue and licked its lips before saying, “As a creature nurtured by the heavens, you should be honored to be the first one to be eaten by me, haha!”

As soon as it finished speaking, the demon king suddenly opened its mouth wide, picked up the little monkey and put him into its mouth, wanting to swallow him.

At the critical moment, a sword shot out and stabbed the demon king’s abdomen.

After seeing that its meal was being disturbed by someone, the demon king instantly looked over with an icy gaze. Then, it saw a figure flying over quickly and grabbing the little monkey.

Just as it was about to stop the person, terrifying flames flew toward it, causing its expression to change drastically.

“It’s actually the Heaven Burning Flames!” the demon king exclaimed. It did not dare to touch the flames that Feng Xiyun had released and quickly dodged the attack.

After the Heaven Burning Flames had been extinguished, Zhuge Yueyue and the little monkey managed to escape.

“This is interesting. Has the Heaven Burning Flames appeared again?”
At this moment, the demon king recovered from its shock. It looked curiously at Feng Xiyun, who was not far away.

Boom…

Accompanied by a series of booming sounds, this group of genius disciples simultaneously escaped from the shackles that bound them.

As fellow geniuses, since Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue were able to escape, they would naturally be able to do the same.

The moment they escaped from the imprisonment, they wanted to escape this place. However, they were shocked that the space around them seemed to have transformed into a cage, and they could not escape no matter how hard they tried.

At this moment, the atmosphere turned solemn. The pale demon king remained silent as it looked at its captives.

Zhuge Yueyue had gone all out to save the little monkey just now as a way to repay his kindness for saving her earlier.

However, at this moment, she could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood. Clearly, she had been severely injured while she saved the little monkey.

“First Sister, how do you feel?”

Feng Xiyun immediately came forward. The little furry monkey did not know what to do at this moment and stood there helplessly.

Seeing this scene, Feng Xiyun looked at the little monkey angrily and said, “If you don’t have the strength to beat it, why did you have to show off? You even got my sister injured!”

At this moment, the little monkey was at a loss for words. After all, he knew that it was indeed Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun who had risked their lives to save him.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He scratched the back of his head. This was the first time in his life that he felt like he owed someone other than his teacher something. He did not know what to do.

“Um… I know how to repay kindness. You risked your lives to save me just now, but I don’t know how to repay you.”

After a moment of hesitation, the little monkey handed the pill to Zhuge Yueyue and said, “I’ll give this pill to you. After all, I don’t want to owe anyone a favor.”
