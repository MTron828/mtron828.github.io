568 Daoist Hei Tie’s Panic Attack (Part 1)

Still, from her reaction, there was still hope for the future.

First, he would teach his disciples alchemy. Then, if a suitable opportunity presented itself, he would confess to Yuelun.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun, saying, “Let’s go back to Cloud Sky peak.”

“Eh?”

!!

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were both dumbfounded.

Feng Xiyun could not help but ask, “Teacher, didn’t you just say that you’ll take us out to see the world. Why are we going back to Cloud Sky peak instead?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan calmly replied, “The Divine Seal peak’s gathering is coming soon. We can explore the outside world later.”

“Teacher, what is the Divine Seal peak’s gathering?” Zhuge Yueyue asked doubtfully.

Even though she had heard the name of this gathering being tossed around many times, she did not know what it was.

Ye Xuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue and said, “The Divine Seal peak’s gathering is the grandest and most important event in the East continent. During this event, many powerful cultivators of the East continent will be in attendance.”

“Many peerless geniuses will be gathered there to compete in terms of martial arts, as well as to discuss the Dao, each expressing their views on cultivation.”

“Those who perform well there are considered peerless cultivators without exception and will enjoy the admiration of the people.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan looked in Mu Beichen’s direction and said, “If you two want to be considered geniuses on his level, you’ll have to display your strength during this gathering.”

“In the past, Chief Tian Xuan also made a name for himself during this gathering.”

“You both have to work hard on your cultivation too. You must uphold Cloud Sky peak’s reputation. Do you understand?”

After hearing these words, Zhuge Yueyue’s heart was filled with fighting spirit, and she replied without hesitation, “Teacher, you don’t have to worry. The two of us will definitely cultivate diligently. We will definitely make Cloud Sky peak proud and famous at this gathering!”

Ye Xuan’s words had successfully ignited their fighting spirit.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled in satisfaction.

“That’s good, that’s good.”

After a short pause, Ye Xuan continued, “I think plenty of geniuses and powerful cultivators will appear at this gathering, so don’t push yourselves too hard. In any case, I’m around.”

He also had to temper their expectations. Hearing this, the two of them were even more moved. Even if they made a mistake, he would not blame them and would always support them.

That being said, disappointing him and letting down Cloud Sky peak was not an option.

Zhuge Yueyue said confidently, “Teacher, don’t worry. This time, we’ll let the outside world know how amazing our Cloud Sky peak is!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan felt that his disciples were very filial and devoted.

He had truly picked the right disciples.

“Then I’ll watch as you make me proud, okay?”

“Teacher, don’t worry. Sister Yueyue and I will definitely fight side by side and win the honors for you,” Feng Xiyun said with confidence.

Ye Xuan patted the heads of his two little disciples and said, “Alright. I’m relieved to see that you both are confident. Let’s head back to Cloud Sky peak then.”

“Teacher, are we really going back now?”

Just as Ye Xuan was about to leave, Zhuge Yueyue suddenly asked.

After some hesitation, she continued, “Teacher, can we check on Su Changhe before we go back?”

Ye Xuan was stunned. He suddenly realized that Su Changhe was nowhere to be found..

After scanning the surroundings, he did not see a single Su family cultivator. He suddenly felt that something was not right.

“Did something happen to the Su family?”

Zhuge Yueyue thought for a while and said, “Not long after Teacher entered the tomb, we arrived here as well.”

“However, the people from the Supreme Divine sect made things difficult for us. Su Changhe stood up to scold them, but he was injured by one of their elders.”

“He has probably been rushed back to the Su family’s residence to recuperate by now.”

“Oh? The Supreme Divine sect?”

The anger in Ye Xuan’s heart was aroused. He looked at his two disciples and asked, “Did those people attack you as well?”

Zhuge Yueyue waved her hand and said, “Thankfully, Martial Uncle Gao rushed over in time and stopped those people. Otherwise, I would have been injured as well.”

“Originally, the fight between me and Xie Tianyu of the Supreme Divine sect was a normal one. I did injure him, but that’s to be expected in a fight.”

“However, the Supreme Divine sect’s elder couldn’t bear to see this, so he decided to take things into his own hands.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Su Changhe couldn’t stand to see this happen, so he came over to scold them, but the elder attacked him shamelessly.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan finally understood what was going on.

Ye Xuan looked at the forces of the Supreme Divine sect in the distance.

Sensing a prickly gaze, Daoist Hei Tie felt that something was wrong and immediately turned around to meet Ye Xuan’s gaze.

Having seen what had happened to the Immortal Divine sect, he was well aware of how terrifying the Great Wilderness Divine sect was.

Originally, he had thought that he would be able to watch a good show, so he had waited until the battle was over, and had yet to leave.

When he noticed that Ye Xuan was looking in his direction angrily, his body trembled.

“This is bad…”

“Let’s hurry back to the sect!”
