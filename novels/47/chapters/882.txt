883 On Tenterhooks

If a war broke out in the East Sea of the East continent, it would definitely cause great turmoil and devastation in the East continent, which had not even recovered from the invasion of the berserk beasts and strange monsters.

Could the East continent endure another major event like this? It would be difficult.

Seeing the furious look on Elder Tongtian’s face, Daoist Canghai’s expression also turned serious. He too sighed and muttered bitterly, “Why did Ao Lei have to pass away at this critical juncture. This is all too sudden.”

He could not understand how or why it had happened. After all, he was even older than Ao Lei, yet still had many years ahead of him.

Judging from the current situation, if the Great Wilderness Divine sect did not send a representative, the East continent’s forces would be at a disadvantage, especially since the Great Wilderness Divine sect was home to the East continent’s sole sealed immortal realm expert.

However, after Ao Lei’s passing, Ye Xuan had not been seen outside the sect, which could only mean that the sect was facing many challenges now.

“Teacher, what should we do now?” Elder Tongtian asked seriously. At the moment, he had no solution to deal with the current situation.

After thinking for a moment, Daoist Canghai said, “The appearance of this ancient palace means that there will definitely be many treasures appearing. We can’t miss such a rare opportunity.”

“Even if the Great Wilderness Divine sect can’t provide us with any assistance, we have to rely on our own strength.”

After taking a deep breath, Daoist Canghai stood up and spoke with a solemn expression, “Pass on my order. All disciples are to move out immediately. We will head to the East Sea in order to seize this heaven-defying opportunity!”

At the ancient palace, not only did one have to be powerful enough, one also had to be lucky enough. With enough luck, even the weakest cultivator might be able to reap a harvest.

The East continent was their home turf, so they did not want to be outdone with the forces of the other continent, even if the Great Wilderness Divine sect could not participate.

At this moment, many cultivators from various forces rushed to the East Sea, causing the area to become lively. However, there was no one from the Great Wilderness Divine sect present.

Due to this, many cultivators began to come up with speculations regarding what was happening in the sect. They believed that the sect was in chaos, and that everyone was jostling for Ao Lei’s position. Therefore, due to the infighting, they did not have the time to participate in the exploration of the ancient palace.

Back in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, all of the disciples were waiting anxiously in the vicinity of Cloud Sky peak.

“Oh my god, why is there no news at all? They are really making me anxious.”

“Yes, yes, why is there no update at all?”

“A few days ago, I heard from others that an ancient palace has appeared in the East Sea. The disciples of the various large factions have already rushed over.”ρ

“At this moment, the East Sea is already full of people and very chaotic. After all, such a heaven-defying opportunity might only appear once in a lifetime. If we miss it, I’m afraid we will never have the chance to encounter it again.”

All of them were anxious and impatient, but they had not received any orders, so no one dared to move at all. Gao Shun could hear what they were saying, but his expression remained solemn and unmoved.

Despite this, inwardly, he was anxious about Ao Lei’s condition.

Every now and then, he would look in the direction of Cloud Sky Cave, hoping that Ye Xuan and the others would appear.

However, more than a month had passed, and there was still no news from the cave. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Lu Xiu hurriedly walked over and whispered into Gao Shun’s ear.

“Senior Brother Gao, people are saying that our sect is in chaos. This might not be good for our reputation.”

“In your opinion, should we head out in order to eliminate these negative perceptions from spreading?”

Gao Shun frowned. However, after thinking seriously for a moment, he shook his head and said, “There’s no need. They can say whatever they want. When the truth appears, all of the rumors will stop.”

“But…”

Lu Xiu’s expression became awkward as he continued, “Are we really going to ignore the ancient palace?”

Looking at the disciples discussing the matter, Lu Xiu felt helpless.

Today, many disciples had come to ask him for information. They all wanted to head out and see if they could obtain some opportunities there.

However, as Gao Shun did not give any orders, they could only bitterly wait anxiously. At this moment, Lu Xiu could tell that the disciples were getting impatient. If this situation continued to drag out, there might really be chaos.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect had always been very free. Cultivators could choose different cultivation paths according to their own aptitudes and preferences.

As teachers, they just needed to guide their disciples and keep them from venturing down the wrong path. Therefore, these disciples all were very independent and would usually take the initiative to do what they thought best.

At the moment, they all wanted to go to the East Sea to join in the fun and fight for opportunities, but they were held back by Gao Shun. If this situation continued, it would definitely cause some conflict. Perhaps if one or two decided to rebel, it would not be a problem, but if it incited large-scale infighting, the sect would suffer tremendous losses.

Gao Shun was also aware of this matter. After turning around to look in the direction of Cloud Sky Cave once more, he sighed emotionally.
