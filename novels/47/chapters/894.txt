895 Zhuge Yueyue Arrives!

“Sigh… It is truly too difficult for a supreme realm expert to defeat a peak-level ancient realm expert…”

Looking at this scene, the onlookers could not help but sigh.

Even though Feng Xiyun’s attack was extremely powerful, it could only do so much against a higher level opponent. The gap in their cultivation levels could not be bridged by an immortal-grade cultivation technique.

“It’s really a pity. If she was given some time, she would definitely become a peerless expert in the future.”

Everyone could not help but sigh.

While everyone was feeling regretful, Feng Xiyun, who was trapped in the cage of lightning, was trying to struggle free with all of her might. She used the Heaven Burning Flames to burn the cage of lightning frantically.

At this moment, she was concerned about Lu Xiu, who had taken a blow for her, as it was uncertain if the latter was dead or alive.

She desperately circulated her spiritual power, trying to bring forth as much power as she could in order to break the cage.

Hovering in the air, Shan Hai felt unequaled and invincible. He looked down and said, “It seems that the disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert isn’t anything special…”

“Die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he released another bolt of divine lightning toward Feng Xiyun.

At this moment, the wind and clouds trembled under the power of the lightning bolt, and it seemed that Feng Xiyun was about to lose her life.

However, at this critical moment, a divine sword streaked across the sky and blocked the divine lightning bolt.

Boom!

With a loud bang, a dazzling explosion erupted, and the shockwaves caused everyone to stagger back a few steps.

“What happened?”

“Who intervened?”

The onlookers scanned the surroundings for the mysterious person. It was only after the dazzling light dissipated that they got a clear view of the sword.

“It’s the Cloud Heaven Sword!”

“Oh my god! Is Ye Xuan here?”

Everyone was shocked, and began to search for Ye Xuan. However, instead of Ye Xuan, the one they spotted was a beautiful girl.

No expression could be seen on her face, but she released a chilling aura, which gave them goosebumps. It was as if her surroundings had been transformed into a world of ice and snow.

“A peak-level ancient realm expert? Too weak…”

It was obvious that these words were a response to the words that Shan Hai had just used to belittle Feng Xiyun.

The person who had rushed over was none other than Zhuge Yueyue, who had rushed over the moment she received the message from Lu Xiu.

When she sensed that Feng Xiyun was facing a life-threatening crisis, she did not hesitate to use the World Slash technique that her teacher had taught her. Fortunately, she had managed to save Feng Xiyun in time.

She hovered in the sky and waved her hand, causing the Cloud Heaven Sword to fly back into her hand.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue looked around the battlefield with a cold gaze, and immediately released her powerful supreme realm aura, which was much stronger than Feng Xiyun’s.

Her eyes were filled with killing intent.

At this moment, everyone was dumbfounded. They could not believe what they were seeing.

“Ye Xuan… He actually has two supreme realm disciples?”

“Oh my god! This is too awesome. It seems that both of his disciples have immortal bones too! Is this true?”

After Zhuge Yueyue began to release her aura, everyone began to shiver from how cold it was, and many people pulled their clothes tighter.

Zhuge Yueyue was famous for being the East continent’s number one genius of the younger generation. Now, it was obvious that she lived up to her reputation. Furthermore, she had inherited her teacher’s Sword Dao.

“Could this be a repeat of Ye Xuan’s miraculous battle back then? Is she going to be able to defeat him?”

At this moment, everyone was tingling with excitement. They watched as she slowly closed in on Shan Hai.

At this moment, Shan Hai was filled with rage.

As the leader of the lightning tiger clan and one of the top experts of the Xuan continent, no one had ever tried to provoke him for over countless years.

However, today, he had been provoked by two little girls!

It was infuriating!

“Hahaha!”

Shanhai laughed out loud as if he had been possessed. His face was filled with arrogance as he said, “Good! Another one has arrived for me to kill!”

“You’re just a mere supreme realm cultivator, yet you dare to clamor in front of me. Today, I’ll kill all of you ants!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hahaha, even if your teacher comes personally, he won’t be able to save you!”

“Eat this!” Shan Hai roared fiercely. Then, a blood-red bolt of divine lightning was unleashed, seemingly splitting the sky into. He erupted with the full power of a peak-level ancient realm expert, holding nothing back.

Zhuge Yueyue furrowed her eyebrows when she sensed the astonishing power. It was her first time facing such a powerful enemy, so she felt a little nervous.
