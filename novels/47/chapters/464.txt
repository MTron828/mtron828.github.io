465 Is Zhuge Yueyue Going To Lose?

“I hereby announce that the battle for the champion of the Seven Peaks competition has officially begun!”

As the judge finished speaking, the atmosphere suddenly became tense.

At this moment, Gao Tianyu’s lips curled into a cold smile. He took out a pill from his storage ring and swallowed it.

“Wait…”

“That seems to be a spiritual power recovery pill…”

Everyone’s expression changed when they saw this.

The pill that Gao Tianyu had taken was not a low-grade one.

“Isn’t this f*cking cheating? The Seven Peaks competition is supposed to be fair and just, yet this fellow is actually so shameless as to consume a spiritual power recovery pill?”

Many people started criticizing him.

At this moment, Gao Shun stood up, and the terrifying spiritual pressure of a mystic lord realm expert swept out.

In that instant, the surroundings became quiet.

At the same time, the judge stood out.

“In the rules of the Seven Peaks competition, cultivators are not forbidden from taking pills to recover their spiritual power.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the corners of everyone’s mouths twitched. Although they were very unhappy, it seemed that there was no such rule.

“No matter what, this was too shameless. How could he use such a shameless method? Even if Hidden Sword peak really wins the competition, it’s an undeserved victory.”

“What’s so strange about that? The law enforcement elder is the person in charge of the competition. It’s normal for him to use such underhanded tricks.”

Everyone started whispering among each other and expressing their disdain at Gao Shun’s actions.

After Gao Tianyu took the spiritual recovery pill, his condition instantly returned to its peak. A confident smile hung on the corner of his mouth as he looked at Zhuge Yueyue with a cold gaze.

“Hmph! How can a mere Cloud Sky peak disciple be my match?”

“The humiliation that your Cloud Sky peak imposed on my Hidden Sword peak the other day will be returned a hundredfold today!

“You… Be prepared to receive my fury!”

Looking at Gao Tianyu’s arrogant appearance, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression did not change at all. Instead, she asked indifferently, “Have you finished spouting nonsense?”

She was unfazed by the whole situation. She had already guessed that Hidden Sword peak would do something underhanded in order to gain an unfair advantage.

However, this would not be enough to beat her.

“Make your move!” Zhuge Yueyue looked at Gao Tianyu indifferently.

The Cloud Sky sword in her hand shone with a bright light. The cold aura it exuded made the temperature drop by several degrees, and it was showing no signs of stopping.

Gao Tianyu squinted his eyes. Zhuge Yueyue’s power of ice was indeed terrifying. Even he was afraid of it.

However, he had already made preparations to deal with it.

“Hmph! Trying to show off in front of me? Die!” Gao Tianyu roared. The storage ring in his hand flashed with dazzling light as a longsword appeared in his hand.

The power released by this longsword was not the slightest bit weaker than the Cloud Sky sword.

When everyone saw this, they all turned to look at Gao Shun in unison.

“It’s actually the Azure Sword!”

“This is the inheritance of Hidden Sword peak. I didn’t expect it to be in Gao Tianyu’s hands…”

“Things are getting more and more interesting! Both are using swords that represent their respective peaks’ legacies!”

“This is not only the battle for the champion of the Seven Peaks competition, but also the future chiefs of Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In that instant, the atmosphere turned intense.

Gao Tianyu’s mouth curved into a cold smile. He swung the Azure Sword at Zhuge Yueyue savagely.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue frowned.

He was worthy of being second only to Hua Rufeng in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. This sword strike made her feel a trace of pressure.

However, it was only a trace!

Moments later, the Cloud Sky Sword suddenly started to spin. The wind formed by the sharp sword qi swept out and blocked Gao Tianyu’s attack.

The cultivation techniques and divine powers that the two of them cultivated were from the inheritances of the two peaks, and could be said to be of the same level.

In addition, the two of them had similar strength, so it was impossible to determine the winner within a short period of time.

“Hahaha! As expected of my precious son, you’ve done well! Ruthlessly crush that girl!”

When Gao Shun saw this scene, he immediately laughed inwardly while maintaining an outward facade of calmness.

After his previous experience, before the outcome was decided, Gao Shun would not dare to show off prematurely.

“Is that all you’ve got?”

After forcing her opponent back, Zhuge Yueyue’s expression turned serious.

Although Gao Tianyu’s swordsmanship was powerful, it lacked finesse.

If that was all Gao Tianyu was capable of, then the battle should be over.

As soon as she finished speaking, the Cloud Sky Sword shone brightly, and a crescent-shaped heavenly slash flew out.

This was Zhuge Yueyue’s test for him.

“The battle has only just begun, yet you’re already in such a hurry to use your trump card. It seems that the disciples of Cloud Sky peak are nothing special!

A cold smile appeared on Gao Tianyu’s face as an overbearing sword strike slashed toward Zhuge Yueyue’s heavenly slash.

...

The two powerful sword strikes collided with each other and canceled each other out.

The shockwaves cracked the surface of the arena.

“What? That fellow is actually able to neutralize the might of the heavenly slash?”

Yuelun became nervous.

After all, from the start of the Seven Peaks competition until now, the heavenly slash technique was considered Zhuge Yueyue’s trump card and ultimate move, but it had now been easily blocked by Gao Tianyu.

Would Cloud Sky peak be defeated?

Thinking this, Yuelun turned around to look at Ye Xuan.

‘Uh… it doesn’t seem like this guy is worried at all. Could it be that Zhuge Yueyue has a stronger trump card?’
