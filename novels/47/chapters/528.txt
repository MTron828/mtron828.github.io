529 A Great Argument

At this moment, Ye Xuan stared at Ouyang Xiu with a teasing look and said, “What you just said is actually quite right, but there’s another piece of bad news. Do you want to hear it?”

Ouyang Xiu’s face trembled. There was another piece of bad news?

At this point, he did not even hope for Ye Xuan to help him, but was simply trying to get Ye Xuan to stay out of the fight.

However, the latter’s sentence gave him a bad feeling.

!!

Moments later, Ye Xuan calmly extended his left hand, and then purple clouds started to appear.

Seeing this, Yanran was stunned.

“This aura… is that the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky technique?”

After hearing this sentence, Ouyang Xiu’s face turned pale in an instant.

Just like the Great Desolation technique, the Cloud Sky technique was one of the exclusive divine powers of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“The bad news I wanted to tell you is… Actually, I’m also a part of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

After hearing those words, Ouyang Xiu suddenly felt weak in the knees.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect… How did things turn out like this?

At this moment, even Yanran, who had a cold expression on her face, was surprised. After all, the odds of this young man being from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were miniscule at best.

It really was too shocking.

An enemy had suddenly become a friend. Her expression turned strange as she deactivated her technique. Then, she flew over to him and examined him closely.

This young man was quite handsome, and was extremely strong to boot.

However, he was definitely a little younger than she was. In that case, would he not be considered her junior brother?

Yanran could not help but think to herself, ‘In the Great Wilderness Divine sect, I’m already considered very young, but I actually met someone younger than I am?’

‘We’re from the same sect, so we can almost be considered peers. However, since I’m older than this man, shouldn’t he call me Senior Sister?’

At this moment, Yanran felt a little happy.

Although she was very powerful in the Heaven continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect, she was the youngest among her generation. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It was precisely because of this that she felt extremely displeased. After all, with her strength, why did she have to call others Senior Brother?

However, there was now someone younger than her. Yanran moistened her throat and said, “So it’s Junior Brother…”

Before she could finish, Ye Xuan immediately interrupted her.

“What’s this? You can’t say such things. I’m your senior brother.”

After hearing this, Yanran was dumbfounded. She said coldly, “I’m older than you, so isn’t it only natural for me to be your senior sister?”

“Who said that being older gives one seniority?” Ye Xuan retorted rudely, not wanting to back down at all. Ouyang Xiu, who was standing beside them, had long been ignored by the two.

At this moment, Yanran was already a little angry. She finally had the chance to get someone to call her senior sister, so how could she let go of such an opportunity?

No matter what, she had to become a senior sister today!

At that moment, Yanran raised her head and puffed out her chest, saying without any scruples, “I’m not only older than you, I’m stronger than you in every aspect!”

“Liar! Who would believe you…”

Ye Xuan was a little puzzled. Although Yanran looked very cold, why did she not seem very smart?

She was like a little girl squabbling over a minor title difference.

Was it not a good thing to be a junior sister?

If anyone dared to provoke her, then she could call her senior brothers to teach them a lesson!

Where could one find such a good deal?

What was the big deal with being a senior sister?

‘Besides, I still don’t know what it feels like to be a senior brother, so don’t fight with me, okay?’

Hearing Yanran’s words, he knew that she did not have the experience of arguing with others, so he directly turned around and said without a care, “I don’t care, I’m your Senior Brother!”

“The two of you, can you take my presence into consideration when you’re quarreling?”

Ouyang Xiu trembled with anger as he spoke.

He was a mighty supreme realm expert, but now he was being treated as if he did not exist. How could he tolerate this?

However, as soon as he finished speaking, two extremely cold gazes turned toward him, causing Ouyang Xiu to shiver in fear.

He could only think in his heart, ‘Fine, okay, I won’t provoke you…’

At this moment, both Ye Xuan and Yanran were similar in the sense that they were the youngest among their peers in their respective sects, so they wanted nothing more than to experience what it was like to be a senior brother or sister. Neither was willing to give in to the other.

Ye Xuan glanced at Yanran and knew that there was no point in continuing the argument.

After thinking about it again and again, Ye Xuan finally made up his mind.

“How about this, I can call you Senior Sister in the future, but you also have to call me Senior Brother. How about this?”

After hearing this, Yanran’s brain could not really process it.

Then, after thinking for a while, she replied, “That’s a good suggestion. I agree.”

As long as Ye Xuan called her Senior Sister, Yanran did not care about anything else.

Moreover, the two continents were far apart and separated by worldly power. Were it not for this ancient tomb, they would never have encountered each other.

After the exploration of the ancient tomb was over, they might not ever meet again, so a compromise was the best solution.

After hearing Yanran agree, Ye Xuan immediately called out, “Hello, Senior Sister.”

...

Hearing this, Yanran unconsciously laughed.
