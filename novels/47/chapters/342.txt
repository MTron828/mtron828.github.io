343 Crisis In The Nanzhou Region

“Teacher!” Zhao Yuyan looked at Ye Xuan with teary eyes.

Out of the group, Zhao Yuyan was the youngest, and the time she had spent cultivating was also the shortest. Most of the time, she was with Yue and Li Qingyan.

The moment she learned that Ye Xuan was about to leave the Tianyuan continent, Zhao Yuyan’s heart was filled with reluctance and sadness.

Before Ye Xuan left, he was either cultivating in seclusion.

Although his secluded cultivation might have lasted years, things were different now. Once Ye Xuan left the Tianyuan continent, she would not know when she would meet him again.

“Silly girl! You’re already an adult, why do you still love to cry?”

Ye Xuan looked at Zhao Yuyan helplessly.

After all these years of cultivating, and with the help of Yue and Li Qingyan, Zhao Yuyan’s personality had changed quite a bit. She no longer blamed herself for having harmed others due to the Demon Devourer Body, and was no longer easily bullied.

However, her tendency to cry had never changed.

Zhao Yuyan could not hold back the sadness in her heart and started crying. She threw herself into his arms.

“Teacher, can you not leave?”

“Or can you take me with you, Teacher?”

Zhao Yuyan’s voice was choked.

This girl did not trust many people due to her childhood traumas. Other than her mother, she was closest to Ye Xuan, Yue, and a few others.

To Zhao Yuyan, not only was Ye Xuan her teacher, he was like a father to her. He had completely changed her fate.

“Silly girl! In the future, when I’m not around, you can’t keep crying.”

“Besides, I can’t be by your side forever. You have to learn to grow on your own,”

“As long as you cultivate diligently, you’ll naturally be able to see me in the upper world in the future.”

Ye Xuan reached out and gently wiped away the tears from the corners of Zhao Yuyan’s eyes.

“Teacher, I will definitely cultivate diligently!”

“I will definitely ascend to the upper world to find you!”

Zhao Yuyan looked up at Ye Xuan with her teary eyes, her expression firm.

“Mm! I believe that my precious disciple will definitely be able to do it!”

Ye Xuan smiled and patted the latter’s head.

Although Yue and Li Qingyan did not say anything, their hearts were also filled with reluctance.

Given their current cultivation levels, it would take them at least several hundred years, perhaps even a thousand, to surpass the great emperor realm.

However, they were clear that they could not hinder their teacher’s cultivation path.

‘Teacher is right. He can’t stay by our side forever. We have to learn to grow on our own.’

Beside him, Shangguan Wan’er was looking at Ye Xuan deeply, seemingly wanting to say something, but holding back.

“Silly girl! Don’t be so sad. You’re going to make me cry.”

“The path of cultivation has always been one of separation and independence!”

“After leaving me, you will grow stronger and walk your own path.”

Ye Xuan smiled and comforted her.

After that, Ye Xuan moved the Qingyun sect out and had Shangguan Wan’er put it into the Imprisonment Divine Tower.

The cultivation environment in these Divine Towers was far better than in the outside world, as the Divine Towers contained dense spiritual energy. Furthermore, some of them even contained martial intents.

In the past few years in the Tower of Heaven, the cultivation levels of the Qingyun sect cultivators had already undergone a major transformation.

Through the power of karma, Ye Xuan knew that only one person could pass through the realm passageway. He could not leave with his disciples, much less bring the Qingyun sect along.

After learning that Ye Xuan was about to leave, his disciples no longer had the mood to cultivate and stuck to Ye Xuan every day.

Five days passed quickly.

“Wan’er, you should set off.”

Ye Xuan gazed into the distant space, and a mysterious light flashed across his eyes.

As soon as he finished speaking, Shangguan Wan’er, who had been cultivating, suddenly opened her eyes, which flashed with sharp sword qi.

She wanted to return to the Nanzhou Region to kill the sea race experts and repay part of the debt she had to Ye Xuan.

“Wait!”

Just as Shangguan Wan ‘er was about to turn and leave, Ye Xuan called out to her.

Shangguan Wan’er turned around, her gaze landing on Ye Xuan.

“Remember! After I leave, you must protect Yue and the others. Don’t be impulsive!”

Ye Xuan smiled, and then, under Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze, his figure suddenly disappeared.

“Teacher…”

When Shangguan Wan’er saw this, she muttered to herself in a daze.

“Teacher!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan also called out reluctantly.

However, Ye Xuan had really left.

“Teacher is gone. I should go do what needs to be done.”

After a brief pause, Shangguan Wan’er’s body transformed into a streak of lightning and disappeared.

At the same time, the Imprisonment Divine Tower also disappeared.

…

Thanks to the sea race’s invasion, countless people died, and the Tianwu Zone soon fell.

Within the Nanzhou Region, many empires had fallen, together with their respective experts.

They were vastly outnumbered by the sea race army.

In the Nanzhou Region, in order to slow down the advance of the sea race army, the Myriad Swords Hall, Gongsun family, and other major factions all joined forces and gathered together to resist the sea race’s invasion.

The land was filled with the stench of blood, and countless cultivators were engaged in a frenzied battle.

Furious roars and screams could be heard everywhere!
