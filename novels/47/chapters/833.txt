834 Shameless Enemy

Everyone stared at the sky without blinking, watching as the door formed. The spiritual pressure she was exerting now made it difficult for the golden-furred growler to even raise his head.

However, inwardly, he was screaming, “This can’t be real! I can’t be defeated so easily!”

His pride could not accept that he would be defeated so easily by the enemy, so he once again released even more power.

The bones all over his body started to crackle and pop, as he unleashed his innate divine power.

This was the very same one he had used on Wu Kong. Although it had not worked on the monkey, that was because the defensive properties of that damned monkey were too powerful.

He believed that this was not the case for Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue frowned when she saw him unleash this divine power. She instantly mobilized her spiritual power to condense an enormous sword beam, above her head.

At this moment, all of the flowers and trees within a hundred miles were drawn over, creating a huge sharp sword. The terrifying sword aura pressed down on the golden-furred growler.

“Sword of Extermination!”

Swoosh!

The huge sword descended from the sky, and the world trembled.

“Go to hell!”

The golden-furred growler did not dare to hold back when he saw the incoming huge sword, and pushed its devouring power to its limits in an attempt to devour Zhuge Yueyue’s sword.

When the two forces collided, a deafening explosion erupted.

Boom!

Even the sky seemed to have darkened, and nothing could be seen clearly.

“Who won?”

People craned their necks, eager to see who the victor was.

Moments later, a huge golden figure fell from the sky and crashed into the ground, causing the ground to tremble violently.

It was obviously the golden-furred growler.

A huge wound was visible on his body. At this moment, another golden-furred growler who was watching all of this from the Xuan continent, instantly flew into a rage. He rushed towards Zhuge Yueyue.

“How dare you beat my son up like this? I’ll make sure you suffer the same fate and live a life worse than death!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Sh*t!

What a shameless old man!

When the older golden-furred growler attacked, the sky trembled violently, and everyone was taken aback. Many of the East continent’s cultivators were worried for Zhuge Yueyue.

Gao Shun was furious and cursed, “What a despicable and dirty old man. I’m gonna teach him a lesson!”

Now that someone from the older generation had interfered, he could as well.

Previously, when the golden-furred growler had been so arrogant and humiliated the East continent, they had all endured it.

However, Zhuge Yueyue had not even mocked the golden-furred growler after winning, yet this old fellow actually could not hold it in anymore.

Gao Shun drew his weapon and charged over.

The two of them collided in the sky, and both took a few steps back.

Seeing this scene, Ao Lei was dumbfounded.

“F*ck! When did this fellow break through to the peak of the supreme realm?”

No one in the sect had received news about Gao Shun’s breakthrough, so they were all taken by surprise, including Ye Xuan.

However, after thinking about it for a while, he understood.

As the commander of the sect’s forces on Sky Mountain, Gao Shun had also received his fair share of merit power. Coupled with the immortal-grade medicinal pill that Ye Xuan had given him that time, it was definitely possible for him to reach this level.

After exchanging blows, the older golden-furred growler roared once again, and tried to bypass Gao Shun and charge at Zhuge Yueyue.

At this moment, a cold killing intent surfaced in Ye Xuan’s eyes. In an instant, even the entire sky was dyed red, causing everyone to tremble in unison.

“What’s happening?”

Then, the older golden-furred growler arrived in front of Zhuge Yueyue.

Gao Shun wanted to stop him, but it was already too late. Just as the older golden-furred growler thought that he had succeeded, a loud sound suddenly rang out, and parts of the older golden-furred growler’s body exploded, turning into bloody mist.

Puchi!

His legs had been completely destroyed, and his body had been sent flying a hundred kilometers away. His body tumbled on the ground for a few more kilometers before coming to a halt.

The sudden turn of events shocked everyone, but when they turned to look at Zhuge Yueyue, they realized that there was someone standing in front of her…
