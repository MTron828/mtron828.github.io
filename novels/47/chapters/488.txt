489 Zhuyan

Of course, these were only recorded in the ancient books of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and were considered legends. Ye Xuan did not know how much of it was true and how much of it was exaggeration.

More importantly, this heaven devouring divine sparrow was obviously not the same as the one from the ancient times.

“Is your devouring power really that terrifying? Do you really think it can easily devour everything?”

Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

Just as he was about to use the Cloud Heaven Sword to finish off the heaven devouring divine sparrow…

“Roar!”

On the other side of the archaic divine mountains, an earth-shaking roar was suddenly heard.

At the same time, an incomparably powerful energy wave suddenly rippled out, causing the entire archaic divine mountains to shake uncontrollably. The energy waves churned through the air in layers, making them visible to the naked eye.

Everyone’s expressions immediately changed as they hurriedly circulated their spiritual power to resist the energy waves.

Ye Xuan quickly looked up.

It was the black tortoise that had let out the roar.

After being repeatedly provoked by the Pixiu, the black tortoise could not bear it any longer. The power in his body suddenly erupted.

It was only a roar, but it sent Pixiu flying.

Moments later, the black tortoise raised a huge leg, which was wrapped in the destructive power of the laws, and suddenly kicked it.

Spatial cracks appeared everywhere, and the Pixiu stared fearfully at the incoming foot. It circulated all of its spiritual power and charged up its heavenly lightning power frantically.

Then, the entire sky turned gray. The terrifying power of the heavenly lightning flashed through the sky and transformed into a torrent of lightning bolts that swept toward the black tortoise.

At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly emerged from atop a huge mountain.

A monkey holding a huge staff suddenly appeared on the mountain peak. Its blood-red eyes contained terrifying power.

“What? It’s actually a Zhuyan…”

Everyone was shocked. The appearance of the black tortoise had attracted not only the Pixiu and the heaven devouring divine sparrow, but also this Zhuyan, which had an extremely rare bloodline.

The Zhuyan held the huge staff in its hand and then let out a loud roar. It leapt into the sky, and its huge staff came crashing down onto the back of the black tortoise.

When it did, the black tortoise roared angrily, and it swatted the staff away.

Shortly after, the three extremely powerful beasts began to fight. Spatial cracks began to appear all around them, spewing out void power.

“Interesting!”

Ye Xuan lit up when he saw this scene. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Then, his gaze shifted back to the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

After devouring many living beings, it had recovered a great deal. Even if Ye Xuan used all of his strength, he might not have the advantage against it..

However, if he used the cloud heaven sword, he most likely would be able to deal with the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

That being said, Ye Xuan had changed his mind.

He wanted to watch all of these beasts fight each other.

What exactly was the heavenly treasure?

Was it really worth fighting over like this?

Then, Ye Xuan flicked his sleeves and his figure suddenly disappeared.

The heaven devouring divine sparrow, which had just recovered from its injuries, immediately erupted with spiritual power. It wanted to settle the score with Ye Xuan, but when it looked around, it discovered that Ye Xuan had already disappeared.

Helpless, it let out an angry roar.

At this moment, the heaven devouring divine sparrow also sensed the Zhuyan’s aura.

Although the black tortoise was extremely powerful, it was now besieged by two powerful beasts. The huge coffin on its shell was starting to show signs of being dislodged.

Seeing this, the heaven devouring divine sparrow gave up on trying to find Ye Xuan and joined forces with the other two beasts to besiege the black tortoise.

As long as it managed to obtain the heavenly treasure, it would likely be able to surpass the supreme realm and reach the ancient realm.

“Oh my god, the three supreme realm beasts are besieging the black tortoise! Tsk tsk! That black tortoise has probably been alive since time immemorial. Those three beasts don’t know how to respect the elderly!”

Su Changhe, who was among the Jade Lake Divine sect’s group, was spouting nonsense at this moment.

Then, just as he was about to start blabbering again, a palm suddenly out of nowhere and smacked his head.

“F*ck!”

Su Changhe was shocked. He thought that some expert had suddenly made a move on him, but when he turned around, he discovered that it was Ye Xuan.

“Chief Ye Xuan, when did you return? You really almost gave me a fright!”

“I almost thought that someone was jealous of my looks and wanted to disfigure me,” Su Changhe patted his chest with lingering fear and said seriously.

The nearby Jade Lake Divine sect cultivators cringed out of embarrassment on his behalf when they heard his words.

Could this guy’s skin be any thicker? Even an iron wall would be ashamed to say such words.

They could not comprehend why an expert like Ye Xuan would allow such a shameless person to accompany him.

That kid was a hooligan, but the point was that, at least in terms of cultivation or talent, anyone here had him beat!!

What was Chief Ye Xuan thinking?

Rather than a shameless hooligan, even bringing around a beautiful but dumb woman was better.

Eh?

Nearby, the Reincarnation Fairy noticed his arrival and asked curiously, “When did Chief Ye Xuan return? We did not sense your presence at all.”

...

“Just now,” Ye Xuan said lightly.
