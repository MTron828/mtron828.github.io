373 I Am The Clown

“Teacher, Chief Yuelun, please have some tea!”

Zhuge Yueyue served the tea and spoke with a respectful look in her eyes. Her etiquette was on point.

When Yuelun saw this, she could not help but nod to herself.

This girl was young, but she was extremely rigorous in performing her tasks. If not for her mediocre talent, she would have been a good seedling.

At this moment, Ye Xuan raised the Cloud Sky sword and placed it in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand.

!!

I wanted to teach you the sword controlling technique today, but since it’s rare for you two sisters to get together, I’ll give you the day off to have some fun with your good sister!

“From today onwards, this Cloud Sky sword is yours!”

“Remember, this sword symbolizes the position of Cloud Sky peak’s first chief. I hope you will continue to uphold the Cloud Sky sword’s reputation!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone present was stunned.

“What? The Cloud Sky sword?!”

Yuelun’s expression changed. She first looked at Ye Xuan, and then at the Cloud Sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand. Her eyes were full of shock.

She naturally knew the significance of the Cloud Sky sword. It was the legacy of Cloud Sky peak that had been passed down for thousands of years.

Even in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, an earth-rank magic artifact like that was extremely rare. Only Cloud Sky peak’s chief was qualified to own it.

However, this guy had passed the Cloud Sky sword to his disciple just like that…

‘Is this guy’s brain damaged?’

Yuelun was stunned.

‘Is this guy putting on an act in front of me, or is he really going to pass the Cloud Sky sword to Zhuge Yueyue?’

Li Xue’er was also dumbfounded.

‘Didn’t Teacher say that Cloud Sky peak was poor and run-down? Anyone with a brain would avoid coming to this godforsaken place.’

‘But now it seems that things are different from what I thought.’

She looked at the Cloud Sky sword in Zhuge Yueyue’s hand with jealousy.

As Yuelun’s youngest disciple, she did not even have an ordinary magic artifact, yet Zhuge Yueyue had an Earth-rank one.

“Teacher, you…”

Zhuge Yueyue was dumbfounded. Her hands trembled as she took the Cloud Sky sword. Her eyes were filled with shock.

She knew that her teacher never joked around with this type of thing. Since he had decided to give her the Cloud Sky sword, he would not go back on his word.

However, compared to the spiritual pills her teacher had given her and the ten years’ worth of cultivation, the Cloud Sky sword seemed rather ordinary.

“Thank you, Teacher. I will definitely work hard to cultivate and uphold the reputation of the Cloud Sky sword!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“In the future, I will definitely use this sword to bring glory to Cloud Sky peak!”

After Zhuge Yueyue received the sword, she deftly swung the sword experimentally, infusing a little bit of her spiritual power into it.

As such, she inadvertently exposed the amount of spiritual power in her body, which Yuelun promptly detected.

Her eyes were filled with shock.

‘How is this possible? She’s reached the divine mystic realm!’

‘How long has it even been? How can she cultivate so quickly?’

Yuelun was dumbfounded.

Then, when her spiritual sense examined Zhuge Yueyue’s body, she suddenly discovered that the latter’s body contained a divine bone that exuded mysterious sky-blue power.

‘Still, although she has the profound ice divine bone, that doesn’t make this situation any more believable!’

Yuelun was stunned to the point that she stood up with her mouth wide open.

When they were in the meeting hall, they had clearly tested and found that Zhuge Yueyue did not have a divine bone. So what was going on now?

Could it be that Zhuge Yueyue’s divine bone was dormant and was activated by Ye Xuan by chance?

Or could it be that Ye Xuan had used the medicinal power of a high-level spiritual pill to forcefully condense a divine bone in Zhuge Yueyue’s body?

She felt that the former was more likely.

After all, Cloud Sky peak was the poorest faction in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. How could he have such a high-level spiritual pill?

‘Wait a minute, he couldn’t have been pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger for the past hundred years, right?’

“The profound ice divine bone. Junior Brother Ye’s eyes are really sharp.”

Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan deeply, his heart full of regret.

If she had been more determined and accepted Zhuge Yueyue into Water Sky peak, such a talented cultivator would have been her disciple.

What a pity. She had actually told this fellow that he had a disciple with the profound ice divine bone. It was such a waste.

At the thought of this, she became a little displeased.

She was very clear about Ye Xuan’s abilities. It was a waste of Zhuge Yueyue’s talent to be his disciple.

The most outrageous thing was that Zhuge Yueyue was completely devoted to Ye Xuan and completely ignored her invitation.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

It was simply a waste of God’s gift!

Ye Xuan naturally understood what Yuelun was implying, but he was too lazy to give an explanation.

As the saying went, ‘facts speak louder than words’.

“Junior Brother Ye, there’s something I don’t understand. This girl only joined the Great Wilderness Divine sect five days ago. How did she reach the divine mystic realm?”

Yuelun asked curiously.

Although the profound ice divine bone was a high-grade divine bone and could greatly increase her cultivation speed, it was not to such an outrageous extent.

There was definitely something fishy about Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation speed!

“What? Teacher, you’re saying that Yueyue has broken through to the divine mystic realm?”

Li Xue’er was shocked.

She had spent five days breaking through to the first level of the mystic meridian realm, and had wanted to show off in front of Zhuge Yueyue. However, things were now the other way around.

Thinking this, Li Xue’er’s face darkened.

She had thought that it was already something to be proud of to be able to become Yuelun’s disciple. However, from the looks of it now, she was the real clown.

She did not want to accept this.

Even though the two of them grew up together, Zhuge Yueyue had always been the dominant one.

She had thought that she could finally be superior after joining the Great Wilderness Divine sect, but now it seemed that she did not need her pity.
