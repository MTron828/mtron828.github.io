“Ranked 25,462th on the qualifications rankings, and only 16 years old too. Isn’t she a peerless genius like Gongsun Yao?”

“But why have I never heard of this person? Anyone who can be ranked on the qualifications rankings should be quite famous.”

“Qingyun sect? Why have I never heard of this sect in the Nanzhou Region?”

“You don’t know? The Qingyun sect is one of the top ten sects in the Great Qian Dynasty!”

“Great Qian Dynasty? I’ve never heard of that either. What kind of empire is it?”

“Of course you haven’t heard of it. The Great Qian Dynasty is only ranked among the lower-middle-ranks of the empires in the Nanzhou Region. Naturally, since it’s not a powerful empire, hardly anyone knows about it.”

“How interesting. I didn’t expect such a genius to appear in such a backward place.”

“It is a waste of talent for such a genius to stay in the Qingyun sect! After the mystic realm closes, I will search and take Li Qingyan as my disciple.”

“Senior’s wish may not come to pass. Li Qingyan already has a teacher.”

“Oh? So what if she has a teacher? There’s no rule that cultivators can only acknowledge one person as their teacher. My strength is at the advanced-stage of the Golden Core realm. Don’t tell me that I’m not qualified to be her teacher?”

“Uh… I’ve heard from the cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty that Li Qingyan’s teacher has already reached the unity realm and is extremely young. It seems that his name is Ye Xuan…”

“What? You said that Li Qingyan’s teacher has already reached the unity realm? Are you joking? How can there be a unity realm expert in such a backward place?”

…

Li Qingyan’s appearance on the qualifications rankings immediately caused a stir among the cultivators. Everyone was discussing Li Qingyan’s background.

The cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty revealed a proud expression and proudly introduced the origins of the Qingyun sect to the cultivators beside them.

Every time they saw the shock in the eyes of the cultivators next to them, they felt proud.

Did you not look down on small empires like ours earlier? Did you not call us a bunch of weaklings? Bet you never expected to see such a monstrous genius emerge from our ranks, huh?

Hehe!

However, that was only the appetizer. The main dishes were still to come!

Only when Ye Xuan, that monster, ascended the Tower of Heaven would all of you understand what a true peerless monster was.

“Li Qingyan, Qingyun sect!”

At the same time, Gongsun Yao squinted her eyes as she stared at the qualifications rankings.

Her goal was also to rank on this list. After all, with her current strength, she could not enter the combat power rankings at all. However, after awakening the Empress Ice body, it was still possible to enter the qualifications rankings.

Moreover, ever since she awakened her special constitution, Gongsun Yao’s heart had become extremely proud. She believed that no cultivator in the Nanzhou Region was more talented than she was.

She believed that only she was worthy of the honor of entering the qualifications rankings.

However, reality had slapped her on the face.

“The Qingyun sect? I can’t believe that such a monster could be born in an unknown place!”

Gongsun Yao’s eyes flickered, but she memorized Li Qingyan and the Qingyun sect’s names.

“Sister, let’s go!”

Gongsun Yao looked at her sister.

“Okay!”

Gongsun Wan nodded, and then the two sisters crushed the jade tokens simultaneously and entered the Tower of Heaven.

“The Qingyun sect…”

After the two girls disappeared, Gongsun Batian could not help but mutter to himself, and his eyes fell on Ye Xuan.

When he saw that the latter was still resting with his eyes closed, he quickly withdrew his gaze and then focused on the Tower of Heaven.

After the two women entered the Tower of Heaven, their speed of breaking through the levels was as fast as lightning.

Within just a few minutes, the two women arrived at the 30th floor.

Although the illusory phantom on the 30th floor was much stronger, Gongsun Wan’s speed did not decrease in the slightest.

In comparison, Gongsun Yao was much weaker. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In a short while, there was a huge gap between the two women.

As time slowly passed, Gongsun Wan was the first to end the trial of the Tower of Heaven. She had only reached the 51st floor.

Gongsun Wan looked around and failed to find any trace of her sister. She furrowed her brow in worry.

“That girl has been on the 41st floor for almost half an hour,” Gongsun Batian stroked his beard and said slowly.

To be able to reach the 41st floor and persist for such a long time, it proved that Gongsun Yao’s strength was not ordinary. However, she was still unable to defeat the illusory phantom, which meant that her strength was insufficient.

Shua!

Just as Gongsun Batian finished speaking, Gongsun Yao was instantly teleported out.

Although she persisted for half an hour, she was still unable to defeat the opponent. As a result, she had only reached the 40th floor.

“Damn it!”

Gongsun Yao wiped the blood from the corners of her mouth. Her eyes were filled with unwillingness.

“Little girl, you are too competitive!”

Seeing this, Gongsun Batian frowned. He gently placed his palm on Gongsun Yao’s body, and a warm current of energy flowed into her body.

“Look! The qualifications rankings have changed again!”

“Someone has entered the list!”

“Gongsun Yao, it’s Gongsun Yao!”

With a flash of golden light, Gongsun Yao’s name suddenly appeared in the list.

Seeing this, Gongsun Yao, who had just stabilized her injuries, could not help but smile.

She knew that with her strength, she would definitely be able to enter the list.

But what was her ranking? She was not inferior to that Li Qingyan person, right?

Immediately, Gongsun Yao’s gaze focused on the list.

“28,151th place: Gongsun Yao, Actual Age: 16, 40 levels, Nanzhou Region, Gongsun family!”

“What? I’m only ranked 28,151th?”

Gongsun Yao was completely dumbfounded.

Her ranking was actually lower than Li Qingyan’s?

Could the Tower of Heaven have made a mistake?

She was the strongest genius in the Nanzhou Region. How could her rank be lower than Li Qingyan’s? Was this not a joke?

If someone of the same age had a level of talent that surpassed hers, then what right did she have to call herself the strongest genius in the Nanzhou Region?

With the help of Gongsun Batian, Gongsun Yao’s injuries were healed. However, when she saw the rankings, her face instantly turned pale.

“How is this possible? There must be a mistake!”

Gongsun Yao was not willing to accept the results.

How could she lose to someone of the same age?
