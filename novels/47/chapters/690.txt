691 Scarred For Life

Xiang Yun’s expression turned furious when she realized what had happened.

She had ever so kindly let him go, but he had launched a sneak attack when her back was turned.

Then, she suddenly smiled. However, there was something wrong with her smile.

When Lin Qiaosheng saw her strange smile, he quaked in his boots. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He immediately dropped his sword and started to beg for mercy.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Please don’t take this matter to heart. Can you please let me go again?”

As he spoke, Lin Qiaosheng started to retreat slowly.

However, Xiang Yun clenched her fists and walked straight toward him with slow, unhurried steps.

“Can I make a request first? When you hit me, please don’t hit my face, okay?”

Lin Qiaosheng had given up on struggling at this moment. However, Xiang Yun did not even bother replying with words.

She rubbed her fists together, then picked up her potato hammer, lining it up squarely with Lin Qiaosheng’s face before swinging it with all of her might.

Lin Qiaosheng felt as if the sky had collapsed. With a loud bang, his figure instantly flew hundreds of miles away.

“How dare you try a sneak attack like that? Prepare yourself! ”

Xiang Yun was truly furious this time. She raised her hammer and launched herself into the sky. With a mighty swing, the potato hammer once again landed accurately on Lin Qiaosheng’s face.

“Argh”

The scene was extremely gory, and the people who were watching felt a chill run down their spines.

This little girl was too f*cking terrifying!

Within a mere minute, Lin Qiaosheng had been beaten up to the point where even his parents would find it difficult to recognize him. Not a single bone in his body was intact, and even his teeth had fallen out.

However, Xiang Yun was also very smart. After the first all-out swing, all of her subsequent attacks were measured and weakened so as to not accidentally eliminate Lin Qiaosheng from the gathering.

After experiencing such a miserable beating, Lin Qiaosheng almost suffered a mental breakdown.

It was no wonder that First Sister had warned her that these people were all bad people. Xiang Yun had not believed this at first, but now the truth was laid bare before her.

This dirty little backstabber!

Then, she put the final nail in the coffin and dealt him a fatal blow, eliminating him from the gathering.

There was a flash of light, and Lin Qiaosheng was instantly sent flying ten thousand miles away.

At the entrance to the ancient realm, some spatial fluctuations swept out, and a pitiful-looking man fell from the sky and landed on the ground.

“Hey, look who it is! Wasn’t the story you told just now very awesome? Why do you look so miserable now?”

“Haha! Serves you right for trying to launch a sneak attack on a little girl. How shameless!”

“That’s right, that’s right. I’m afraid none of our words mean anything to you. After all, you’ve lost all sense of shame! Truly one-of-a-kind.”

“Tsk, tsk”

After hearing their jeering remarks, Lin Qiaosheng no longer dared to raise his head. He dejectedly left the area.

He had lost big time, and knew that he would remain a laughingstock for the considerable future.

Seeing him run away with his tail tucked between his legs, everyone laughed out loud, which embarrassed the cultivators of the Lingyun sect.

When they saw Lin Qiaosheng walking toward them, they hurriedly averted their gazes, pretending not to know him.

“Teacher”

Lin Qiaosheng went over to his teacher with his head lowered.

However, the sect master of the Lingyun sect turned around without hesitation, pretending not to know him.

“I’ll make it clear in advance that I don’t know who this shameless person is either. What he did just now has nothing to do with the Lingyun sect.”

“Don’t spread the news after you leave. Otherwise, I won’t be polite.”

Although the sect master of the Lingyun sect was trying his best to persuade them, no one was listening at all, as the Lingyun sect would also suffer in shame thanks to Lin Qiaosheng’s actions.

If he had really succeeded in defeating that little girl just now, the crowd might not have said anything. After all, the end justified the means. However, the fact that the goal had not been achieved meant that the method, and perhaps the person, were lacking.

“Let’s go back”

The sect master of the Lingyun sect decided to leave with his disciples. There was no point in staying here and incurring public ridicule.

Inside the ancient realm, Xiang Yun was staring at the sky, waiting for Lin Qiaosheng’s body to fall back to the ground.”

“Strange, why hasn’t it fallen after so long?”

She was completely unaware of the fact that she had already eliminated him. After two to three minutes, she ran out of patience.

At this moment, rays of golden light fell on her body.

“Ah, it ended?”

Xiang Yun finally reacted at this time. She had learned from her previous encounters that every time she defeated an enemy, this warm power would flow into her body.

When this happened, it meant that he could go to the next space.

“Damn it, he made me so angry. I wanted to beat him up again”
