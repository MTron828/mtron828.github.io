311 The Grim Situation

Still, having successfully comprehended second-level karmic intent allowed him to make faster progress in his comprehension of other martial intents.

Two years later, Ye Xuan comprehended fourth-level spatial intent, which was also the limit of the spatial intent contained within the Tower of Heaven,

Now, Ye Xuan would have to rely on his own comprehension and insights to increase the level of these two supreme intents.

Three years later, Ye Xuan successfully comprehended sixth-level spatial intent, which allowed him to engrave the profound pattern derived from spatial intent into his body.

There were still three years before his state of epiphany would end, so Ye Xuan wanted to try to comprehend strength intent through the avenues of fist and vibration intent.

He also wanted to try to comprehend life intent through wood intent, and destruction intent through heavenly lightning intent. He had to take advantage of this extended state of epiphany!

Just like that, time passed by quickly.

During this period of time, Shangguan Wan’er successfully refined the heart of heavenly lightning, thus comprehending fifth-level heavenly lightning intent.

As for Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan, when they discovered that they had reached the limits of their secluded cultivation in terms of progress, they decided to go to the outside world together to train and gain experience.

Under the sea race’s fierce attacks, thirty regions in the Tianze Zone had fallen, and even a few King realm experts had perished in battle.

A portion of the sea race’s forces even attacked the Nanzhou Region.

“When you go out to train and gain experience, don’t leave the Nanzhou Region.”

When Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan left the Tower of Heaven, Ye Xuan gave them instructions.

Having not heard Ye Xuan’s voice for a long time, they felt happy and naturally heeded his instructions.

After activating the token, they were transported back to the Qingyun sect.

“The sea race’s attacks are so fierce. It seems that there will be no peace in the Nanzhou Region either,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

Ye Xuan had deduced many things through the power of karma, including the true reason behind the sea race’s attacks, which was creation intent, which was yet another supreme intent.

During this time, he had tried to use the power of karma to deduce Shangguan Wan’er’s previous life. However, everything was a blur. It seemed that his level of karmic intent was still too low.

The sea race’s goal was not just creation intent, but also the Tianyuan continent’s destiny. They wanted to steal the fate of the human race!

“It seems that my next opportunity lies among the sea race,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Through the power of karma, Ye Xuan also foresaw the dangers that Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhoa Yuyan would encounter during their training in the outside world.

However, the trump cards he had left them would be sufficient to deal with anything thrown their way.

After a year of training, ue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan were besieged by the sea race in the Nanzhou Region.

After the sea race cultivators entered the Nanzhou Region, they chose to disguise themselves and cause sporadic destruction everywhere.

The Divine Gate, as the most powerful force in the Nanzhou Region, led countless human cultivators to surround and round up the sea race cultivators that had infiltrated the Nanzhou Region.

Soon the sea race cultivators who had been concealing themselves banded together, and a great battle erupted.

Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan also took part in this battle, and revealed their true combat strength for the first time.

As the sea race’s forces gradually started losing, a sea race King realm expert suddenly appeared and was about to destroy the Nanzhou Region.

At the critical moment, his disciples used Ye Xuan’s jade token, and the resulting energy body summoned killed that sea race King realm expert.

After two years of training, Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan finally returned to the Tower of Heaven.

Amidst all this, Shangguan Wan’er was still immersed in comprehending her martial intents.

Although she was no longer in the state of epiphany, her high comprehension value still allowed her to make significant progress.

Yue, Li Qingyan and Zhao Yuyan also joined her in secluded cultivation to consolidate and digest what they had learned and experienced over the past two years.

Time passed, and soon, it had been six years since Ye Xuan had gone into seclusion.

Under the sea race’s frenzied attacks, many regions were lost, and humans were forced to retreat to other regions.

As for the human race’s King realm experts, they were all occupied dealing with the sea race King realm experts.

In total, the human race lost over a hundred regions to the sea race!

The human race then also mobilized the King realm experts who were closest to the battle zones to try and overturn this situation.

The Divine Gate Holy Land, Falling Sky Pavilion, Sky Holy Land, and Great Sword Sect were the strongest factions in the Huangyu Zone. Most of the King realm experts mobilized came from these four great factions.

In order to resolve this crisis, half of the Huangyu Zone’s King realm experts were dispatched as support. If they did not assist the Tianze Zone, then the Huangyu Zone would be next!

The sea race and the human race were the two most powerful races on the Tianyuan continent. There was almost no difference in the number of King realm experts they possessed.

However, there were far more sea race cultivators below the King realm than there were human race cultivators below the King realm.

After all, more than seventy percent of this world was covered by the seas and oceans, which was the territory of the sea race. They greatly outnumbered the human race.

This was especially true for the stormy sea area, where countless sea race cultivators were hidden.
