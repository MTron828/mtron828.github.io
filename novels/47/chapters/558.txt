559 Crisis (Part 2)

Seeing this, Gao Shun confirmed that he was no match for Elder Taiyin. If he persisted, the only result would be death.

However, what could he do? Ye Xuan still had not appeared.

As a peak-level mystic lord realm cultivator, and one of the chiefs of the sect, it was his duty to step up and buy time for the disciples to escape.

Elder Taiyin looked at Gao Shun with a face full of mockery.

“Do you really think that an ant like you can actually stop me?”

“Hehe, so what if I’m an ant? I’m still blocking you now, aren’t I?”

Gao Shun replied very domineeringly and immediately activated his forbidden secret technique once more.

At this moment, he felt a strong power surge through his body, pushing him into the supreme realm.

The crowd immediately exclaimed in surprise. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Heavens! Gao Shun actually reached the supreme realm as well?”

“Is this real or fake?”

No one could believe their eyes. Had he broken through at this critical juncture?

Perhaps only Mu Beichen, who was familiar with forbidden secret techniques, knew what was going on.

In order to raise his cultivation level, Gao Shun had paid an extremely great price. Whether he won or lost, he might even die due to the forbidden secret technique.

“Gao Shun!”

After sensing Gao Shun’s cultivation level increase, Li Dahai shouted hysterically.

At this moment, he felt very indignant. The long spear in his hand directly pierced the body of a cultivator of the temple of eternal youth, and then he roared again.

“Everyone, get out of here! Your Martial Uncle Gao is risking his life to save yours!”

He was also very clear about the effects of this forbidden secret technique. Hence, he was furious, but helpless.

Elder Taiyin was still staring at Gao Shun with a murderous expression. As he watched the latter’s strength gradually rise, he frowned cruelly.

“Hehe, are you so eager to die?”

He had truly reached the supreme realm, while Gao Shun was only borrowing strength to reach it temporarily. The outcome of this battle was already set in stone.

“Hehe, I’d like to see just how long you can hold on.”

Elder Taiyin launched an attack instantly. His powerful battle energy shook the surroundings.

At this moment, the onlookers who were watching from the distance panicked, and retreated further away to avoid being caught in the battle.

Seeing Elder Taiyin’s attack, Gao Shun did not back down, and immediately drew his sword to block it.

Boom!

Gao Shun was forced to retreat while spitting out several mouthfuls of blood. The battle had just started, yet he had already suffered considerable injuries.

Elder Taiyin had no intention of allowing Gao Shun to recover, and quickly pressed his advantage, unleashing a series of fierce attacks.

The cultivation gap between them, in addition to the augmentation of the strange power, meant that Gao Shun could only defend passively.

“It’s over. If things continue this way, I’m afraid that Senior Brother Gao won’t be able to hold on.”

After noticing Gao Shun’s situation, Li Dahai was anxious.

However, what could he do now?

He still had to protect the sect’s disciples. Even if he did not, going over to Gao Shun’s side to help would only make things worse. His lack of strength would only make things more difficult for Gao Shun.

Yuelun’s situation was equally urgent.

She was surrounded by many elders from the Immortal Divine sect, and was quickly running out of spiritual power. Once that happened, she would probably no longer be able to hold out.

At this moment, the defeat of the Great Wilderness Divine sect seemed to be imminent. Only a lucky few disciples were able to escape. The rest had yet to break out from the encirclement.

If this situation persisted, only death awaited them.

At this moment, Li Dahai’s expression was extremely gloomy. He watched helplessly as many disciples fell in front of him. He felt very helpless, but quickly took out a communication talisman and pinched it.

In fact, every chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had this communication talisman, but it could only be used in an emergency.

The situation was already so critical, so he no longer hesitated and sent out a request for help.

At this moment, Ao Lei, who was still in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, suddenly released a powerful aura. His face was filled with fury and killing intent.

“The damn Immortal Divine sect actually dared to mess with our sect? They’re courting death!”

After saying this, Ao Lei instantly gathered hundreds of cultivators and flew in the direction of the ancient tomb’s entrance.

At this moment, the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect rushed out in full force to help as quickly as possible.

On the other side, after discovering that Li Dahai had already sent the news back to the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the Immortal Divine sect also sent the news back to the sect and called for help.

Today’s battle was bound to result in the destruction of one of their sects.

“Kill! Kill them all!”

Li Dahai could not care less at this moment. He picked up his spear and charged forward, ignoring everything. He had the aura of a warrior who was embarking on a path of no return.

Lu Xiu shouted in a domineering manner, “Hehe, Senior Brother Li is so brave!”

“It’s been a long time since we’ve fought side by side. Let’s have a good fight today. Kill!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Xiu instantly launched a powerful attack, killing several cultivators of the Immortal Divine sect.

On Zhuge Yueyue’s side, after exchanging glances with Feng Xiyun, it was obvious that they had also both made up their minds.

This battle was a matter of life and death for the sect. There was no way they could cower and escape!
