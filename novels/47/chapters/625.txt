626 Aim Higher

After running around the garden Xiang Yun grew tired and laid down on the ground, panting heavily.

Ye Xuan squatted down next to her and examined her carefully. He discovered that her cultivation had stabilized at the middle stage of the foundation establishment realm.

It seemed that Xiang Yun was quite gifted when it came to body refining. If she was allowed to absorb even more precious spiritual herbs in the future, would she not advance even faster?

Ye Xuan was looking forward to this.

Meanwhile, she looked at her teacher and smiled smugly.

“Teacher, can I be considered invincible among my peers now?”

Ye Xuan shrugged in response. She really was obsessed with this title.

“Ahem, no, not yet. Becoming invincible among your peers is not something that can be done overnight.”

“There’s one thing you have to be clear about. The world is very big, and there are many experts who are your age. If you want to be considered invincible, you have to cultivate diligently.”

Xiang Yun was not discouraged by this, and stood up immediately, indicating that she wanted to continue.

“Alright, Teacher, I understand. Don’t worry, I will definitely become invincible among my peers.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she jumped into the Boundless Cauldron again to absorb the remaining medicinal solution.

Ye Xuan was very pleased to see this. At the same time, a system notification rang out.

“Ding! Congratulations! As you have given your disciple a number of spiritual herbs, you have received a stalk of earth root grass and other spiritual herbs as a critical reward…”

Ye Xuan was pretty happy when he heard this, but also a little disappointed. He had received higher-grade spiritual herbs, but had been hoping for immortal-grade ones.

In any case, he would take things step-by-step, and the stalk of earth root grass was very suitable for Xiang Yun as well.

It seemed that the method of internal and external cultivation could be put into practice perfectly.

After examining the herbs given by the system, Ye Xuan checked on Xiang Yun’s condition again.

As time passed, the sun gradually set, and the medicinal solution in the Boundless Cauldron became a pool of clear water.

It was obvious that the medicinal power inside had been fully absorbed by Xiang Yun. In turn, she had reached the advanced-stage of the foundation establishment realm!

Ye Xuan took a deep breath and carefully examined her body. He discovered that her strength had actually reached the 100,000-jin mark!

‘Hehe! She’s really awesome!’

‘My disciple is indeed different from the rest.’

Ye Xuan was secretly overjoyed, but his face was still very calm.

“Alright, you don’t have to soak in it anymore.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun emerged from the Boundless Cauldron.

However, when she flopped out of the cauldron, she failed to control her strength and fell to the ground.

“Woah, when did I become so strong?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As soon as she finished speaking, she threw a few punches to test out her body’s condition. Her punches generated strong gusts of wind, and shattered a large rock that was not far away.

She was dumbfounded when she saw this, and immediately began to stretch and move her body to get used to her current strength.

She hugged Ye Xuan’s leg excitedly and said with a smile, “Teacher, I’m amazing. I must be invincible among my peers now, right?”

“I’m 100% confident that I can beat that little brat Li Yi into a pulp with one slap if I fight him again.”

“Hehe, Teacher, why don’t you bring me to him. I’ll punch him once, and then I’ll punch him again and again until he goes poof!”

Ye Xuan sighed. He said with a straight face, “Yun’er, you’re not allowed to do such a thing!”

“You and Li Yi are both fellow disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. You are not allowed to grievously injure your fellow disciples, otherwise I’ll punish you heavenly.”

Xaing Yun was shocked when she heard this, and could only reply weakly, “”Alright, alright, Teacher, I got it.”

“However, if you really can’t help but beat him up, it’s not a big deal. The important thing is to control your strength and not hurt him badly.”

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curved up slightly as he said these words.

Xiang Yun’s face brightened up.

“Teacher, you’re not lying to me, right? Can I really give that stinky brat a good beating?”

“When have I ever lied to you? However, there’s no need for you to hit Li Yi. It’s not challenging at all.”

“Xiang Yun, as a disciple of Cloud Sky peak, we have to aim high. If you really want to fight, let me introduce you to someone.”

“Not long ago, your senior sister beat up Gao Tianyu of Hidden Sword peak. You should try and emulate her. Train diligently and see if you can beat him up too.”

Yinyun’s eyes seemed to light up after hearing that. She raised her head and puffed out her chest as she spoke with certainty.

“Teacher, don’t worry. I will definitely train seriously and beat Gao Tianyu up as soon as possible.”

As she spoke, she did not forget to punch the air a few times with her small fists. She looked very confident.

Even her own senior sister had already beaten Gao Tianyu up, so she had to follow in her senior sister’s footsteps and beat that brat up as well!

Ye Xuan felt slightly guilty when he saw this.

‘My apologies Senior Brother Gao, but my disciple likes to fight too much and needs a target. Unfortunately, Gao Tianyu is the perfect candidate to train her.’
