301 Body Tempering

“What’s wrong?”

Ye Xuan was puzzled.

“Ahem, Teacher, I’ll go change my clothes first.”

While tempering her body with lightning bolts was great, Ye Xuan’s heavenly lightning intent had at least reached the sixth-level. Therefore, if she took on the lightning bolts unprepared, her clothes would definitely be turned into dust.

“Uh, right.”

After that, Shangguan Wan’er quickly went to the side and set up a concealing formation, then changed her clothes.

She was now wearing a sky blue dress, which was a high-grade mystic artifact that Ye Xuan had given her earlier.

“I’m ready, Teacher.”

The embarrassment from her face faded, and she turned serious once more.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded and motioned for the latter to sit down.

He then waved his sleeve, and then thousands of lightning bolts descended from the sky, imbued with his heavenly lightning intent.

Among all of the supreme intents, heavenly lightning intent was the most violent, while strength intent was the most powerful.

However, there was one supreme intent that was even more terrifying. It could destroy everything from the atomic level.

That was the legendary supreme destruction intent!

Heavenly lightning intent and destruction intent were linked. If a cultivator could reach the perfect-level of heavenly lightning intent, there was a good chance that they would be able to comprehend destruction intent. After all, both intents focused on destructive power.

In addition, heavenly lightning intent had a certain connection with tribulation lightning, which was why it was listed as a supreme intent.

Of course, for the current Ye Xuan, all of this was still too far away.

Moments later, Shangguan Wan’er’s body trembled violently. She felt the destructive power of lightning coursing through her body, and constantly refining her meridians.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The lightning bolts descended unceasingly, drowning both Ye Xuan and Shangguan Wan’er within.

Bright purple light danced on the tip of Ye Xuan’s fingers. Under the control of his spiritual sense, it transformed into a liquid that continuously strengthened Shangguan Wan’er’s meridians, organs, and bones.

As Shangguan Wan’er’s physical body continued to be tempered, Ye Xuan gradually increased the power of the lightning bolts.

As it was her first time tempering her body with the lightning bolts, Shangguan Wan’er’s physical body improved extremely quickly.

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

Shangguan Wan’er’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened, and a bright purple light flashed across her eyes.

“Such power!”

Shangguan Wan’er examined the power in her body briefly in amazement.

With her current physical strength, she could easily tear space apart without using her spiritual power!

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple’s physical strength has increased by 8x. The host has received a randomized 5x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s physical strength has increased by 40x!”

Of course, this so-called 40x multiplier was based on Shangguan Wan’er’s physical strength, not his. Still, she was the strongest of his disciples, so the effect was rather significant.

Ye Xuan’s body trembled with power. The blood essence in his body erupted with terrifying golden power. This was a manifestation of extreme physical strength.

“Not bad!”

“I can perform spiritual power infusion again,” Ye Xuan said inwardly.

At present, his physical strength had reached its saturation point. To improve further, he had to either awaken another special constitution, or be baptized by the power of the natural laws again.

However, Ye Xuan was already quite satisfied with his current physical strength.

“Alright! Stay seated. I will now perform spiritual power infusion for you.”

While Shangguan Wan’er was still rejoicing at the increase in her physical strength, she felt a warm current of spiritual power enter her body.

She immediately calmed herself down and started cultivating.

After having her physical body tempered, the amount of spiritual power that her body could withstand had also increased.

Some time later, Ye Xuan stopped the infusion of spiritual power. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
