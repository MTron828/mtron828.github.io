719 The Lively Su Residence (Part 1)

Su Tiansheng was a little stunned when he saw the guests who had come this time, as it was the general of Qingyang City, Li Kun.

Thank you readers!

Some time ago, because Li Kun provoked Ye Xuan, he had almost lost his life. Whenever he recalled that matter, he felt a lingering sense of fear.

Thus, he had been constantly thinking of how to apologize to Ye Xuan and resolve their past grudges. Now, the Great Wilderness Divine sect and Ye Xuan had become even more famous and exalted, so there was no way for him to even meet up with the other party.

Usually, with his status as a general, he would not pay too much attention to small forces like the Su family. However, the current situation was different. The Su family had already become the only faction that could be considered to be on good terms with Cloud Sky peak.

“Greetings, General Li. Your presence here brings honor to the Su family.”

Su Tiansheng was overawed by General Li’s presence here, and was even a little frightened.

However, when he thought about the reason behind Li Kun’s visit, he immediately regained his calm. Inwardly, he was stoked.

‘This Li Kun was always so arrogant when we met. I still remember that when we first came to Qingyang City, this b*stard didn’t even allow us to meet him.’

‘However, it seems the tables have turned now.’

Thinking this, Su Tiansheng was filled with joy. This privilege was all due to Ye Xuan. Thankfully, he had taken the initiative to protect Ye Xuan’s disciples, and contribute to Cloud Sky peak by building a palace.

That one action had changed his fate, as well as that of the Su family.

Even this usually high and mighty figure had no choice but to personally come over to curry favor with them.

Thanks to Ye Xuan’s strength and achievements, almost all the famous families in Qingyang City came over to express their goodwill.

Moreover, Ye Xuan had three talented disciples, and one of them had even emerged as the champion of the gathering.

With all these factors combined, how could no one want to befriend him?

“Hehe, Master Su, you’re treating me as an outsider.”

Li Kun sat down with a smile on his face. Then, he waved his hand to the guards behind them, signaling them to bring over a few large boxes of gold, silver, and jewelry.

“Master Su, I collected these little things during the battle at the border a while ago. They’re not very valuable, so you can just treat them as a small gift from me to the Su family.”

Su Tiansheng was stunned. These boxes were considered small gifts? Each box contained extremely precious treasures. Li Kun truly was a generous guy.

“General Li, what do you mean by this? There isn’t a special occasion today, is there? Why did you give me such expensive gifts?”

“General Li, you should take back these treasures. How could I accept such precious things?”

Although Su Tiansheng said all this, he was very much aware of Li Kun’s intentions, he could not be the one who let the cat out of the bag.

In any case, it was indeed his fault for having treasted Su Tiansheng so poorly back then. Knowing that he was in the wrong, Li Kun could only acquiesce to the situation and try to salvage a semblance of a relationship.

He did not expect that the person he did not take seriously before would actually manage to cling onto a peerless expert like Ye Xuan.

It seemed that he could not afford to be hung up on the glory of the past.

With the current relationship between the Su family and Ye Xuan, as long as Cloud Sky Peak was still around, the Su family would be an existence that no one would dare to provoke. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After adjusting his state of mind, Li Kun plastered a bright smile onto his face, as he laughed and said, “Master Su, these little gifts are nothing valuable, and are just a token of my goodwill.”

“If I remember correctly, we have known each other for several decades. I remember that when you first arrived in Qingyang City, I was unable to come over to pay you a visit because I had something important to do.”

“Now that I’m finally free, I rushed over immediately. I hope Master Su won’t take offense over that matter.”

Li Kun decided that the best way he could patch things up was to be open.

After hearing these words, Su Tiansheng’s heart was already bursting with joy. He pretended to be nonchalant as he waved his hand.

“General Li, you actually still remember those things from before. I thought that you were busy with work and had long forgotten about the matter.”

After saying these words, Su Tiansheng sat back down. However, just as Li Kun was about to speak again, a servant of the Su family shouted, Master, Prince Zhanglu is here. ”

“Oh?”

Li Kun’s face darkened when he heard that Prince Zhanglu had come personally.

The relationship between the two of them had gone downhill due to the auction house debacle back then. Meeting him here would only make things worse.

At this moment, Su Tiansheng also noticed his expression and laughed evilly in his heart…
