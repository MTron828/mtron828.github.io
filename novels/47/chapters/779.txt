780 Message From Beyond (Part 1)

“Now that the barrier has begun to tremble, it seems that the eight continents will soon merge.”

“These signs herald the arrival of a disaster…”

Hearing Old Master Sun’s words, Yanran’s heart trembled. This prediction was about her?

Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Saintess?

That was her!

!!

A few days ago, she had completely absorbed the power of the Saintess and obtained the divine blessing. Augmented by the immortal heavenly treasure that Ye Xuan had given her, her current cultivation level had already reached the peak of the ancient realm. As long as the time was right, she would reach the sealed immortal realm.

However, after hearing Old Master Sun’s words, she immediately realized what kind of responsibility she had as the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Saintess…

What would she have to face when disaster struck?

It seemed that the fluctuations of worldly power around the barrier had become even stronger during this period of time.

Seeing her worried look, Old Master Sun tried to comfort her, “Junior Sister, you don’t have to worry too much.”

“This is just a prediction. As for whether it’s true or not, we can only wait and see.”

Yanran lowered her head and pondered the matter. She did not speak, and no one else knew what she was thinking.

Looking at the violently fluctuating barrier, she felt that something was wrong. It was as if something on the other side of the barrier was tugging at her heartstrings.

Therefore, Yanran asked with great interest, “Senior Brother, which continent is on the other side of this barrier?”

“If I’m not wrong, it’s the East continent.”

“Ah!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yanran’s heart became restless, as she finally understood why she felt the way she did.

East continent…

That was where her boyfriend was!

Touching the barrier with her finger, Yanran was now very eager to go to the other side to take a look and see what was going on in the East continent.

Since she had parted ways with Ye Xan back then, she had been cultivating diligently in order to reach the sealed immortal realm in order to be reunited with him.

He was the person she missed day and night, and she worried about his safety constantly. However, with her current strength, she could not cross the barrier and enter the East continent.

After hearing Yanran’s words, Old Master Sun’s heart trembled.

Even though he was Yanran’s senior brother, he was no different from her teacher. He had personally raised Yanran and taught her all kinds of divine powers. In fact, he was more like her father than a senior brother, and in Yanran’s heart, he held an extremely important position.

This was the first time Old Master Sun had seen such an expression on Yanran’s face. After all, she was usually cold and would not even look at others.

Therefore, seeing her like this, Old Master Sun was a little flustered.

Could it be that there is someone in the East Continent that my little junior sister is deeply concerned about?

Who was this person?

His junior sister was also well-known in the Heaven continent because of her beauty. She was even praised as the number one beauty in the Heaven continent.

It was precisely because of this reason that many talented men from various forces admired Yanran and tried to woo her.

However, he had protected her well. No matter which genius came to pursue Yanran, they would be beaten up by Old Master Sun.

It was for this reason that Old Master Sun was called Yanran’s guardian.

“Your junior sister has already grown up. There will come a day when she will eventually marry. If you protect her like this, are you going to wait until she becomes an old woman before marrying her off?”

Despite hearing such insults from outsiders, Old Master Sun did not take it to heart at all. He maintained his stance of beating up people who had designs on his junior sister.

Ever since Yanran stepped onto the path of cultivation, Old Master Sun had played many roles…

Teacher, senior brother, and even a father…

He protected Yanran and allowed her to grow up safe and sound.

Even though Yanran’s current cultivation level had long surpassed Old Master Sun, she still remained respectful to Old Master Sun. Perhaps in Yanran’s heart, Old Master Sun was really a father figure.

Seeing that she was most likely already charmed by another man, Old Master Sun gripped the sword in his hand tightly. He wanted to rush over to the East continent immediately to find the culprit.

However, after thinking about it seriously for a moment, Old Master Sun relaxed his grip.

“Sigh… Forget it, forget it. ”

This was the truth. His junior sister had already grown up. One day, she would meet her ideal husband. He could not keep holding her back.

Besides, on this long journey of cultivation, it was indeed better to have someone to accompany her so she would not be so lonely.

Besides, he was already old and could not protect Yanran forever.

At this moment, Old Master Sun could only pray that whoever had won her heart was someone good.

“Perhaps a great battle has already broken out in the East continent. I can also sense that there are waves of an extremely evil power on the other side.”

“The barrier is probably fluctuating because of this evil power. Perhaps it won’t be long before the eight continents are unified.”

Old Master Sun sighed.

After hearing these words, Yanran became even more worried. Her rainbow-colored dress also emitted a faint sheen of light.

After sensing this, Yanran was very shocked. It was only then did she realize that thanks to the effects of this dress, she could actually sense Ye Xuan’s presence and status on the other side of the barrier.

Judging from what she sensed, he had not suffered any injuries.

A smile bloomed on Yanran’s face, and she immediately took out a brush and paper. After writing down some things, she folded it into a paper crane and sent it flying across the boundary, using the power of the rainbow dress to cover it.

Then, she used the effect of the rainbow dress to call out to Ye Xuan silently.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was also at the boundary because he felt as if someone was calling out to him…
