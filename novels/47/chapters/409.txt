410 How Dare You Impersonate The Princess!

After getting Zhuge Yueyue’s approval, Feng Xiyun smiled and said to Su Changhe.

“Looks like we’ll have to trouble Young Master Su for the next few days.”

“Don’t worry, fairy. This isn’t a big deal. There’s no need to pay it any mind.”

“Since that’s the case, let’s leave quickly. That fellow Lin Dong will definitely seek revenge for the smallest grievance, so we must be careful,” Su Changhe said hurriedly before heading downstairs.

At this moment, opposite Qingyang Restaurant was another luxurious restaurant.

Lin Dong was in that restaurant. He was currently furiously staring at the Qingyang Restaurant. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became.

Looking at the wine cup embedded with jades in his hand, he was angry. He crushed it and said to his subordinate fiercely.

“Keep an eye on their movements for me!”

“Hmph! Although Han Sikong is powerful, he can’t protect them forever. I don’t believe they’ll hide in there forever!”

“As long as those people leave Qingyang Restaurant, Han Sikong will have no excuse to intervene.”

At this moment, a guard beside him said worriedly, “Young Master, this matter involves Su Changhe after all. Should we go back and inform the family head?”

Upon hearing this, Lin Dong involuntarily narrowed his eyes as he carefully pondered.

He could have let Su Changhe off for Su Tiansheng’s sake, but since this guy did not know what was good for him, he could not be blamed for being ruthless.

Moreover, in Qingyang City, the Lin family and the Su family had always been at odds.

Previously, his father could not find a reasonable excuse to suppress the Su family. Now, Su Changhe’s actions had undoubtedly given him a chance.

It seemed that it was time to tell his father about this.

“Quickly return and tell my father about everything that happened here!”

“Yes, Young Master!”

While Lin Dong was glowering at the Qingyang Restaurant, an extremely beautiful lady was currently squatting down to help him reduce his anger.

Just like that, time passed by slowly.

The bustling streets were filled with people, completely unaware of the chaos that was about to descend upon Qingyang City.

At this moment, Su Changhe left Qingyang Restaurant with a smile on his face. Zhuge Yueyue, Feng Xiyun, and Xin’er followed behind him.

Just as they were about to head in the direction of the Su family’s residence, a group of people dressed in black robes suddenly surrounded them and blocked their way.

Su Changhe’s expression changed when he saw that.

He was naturally aware that these people were sent by Lin Dong. Just as he was about to speak, Feng Xiyun, who was beside him, stood up and spoke in an indifferent manner.

“Hehe, you guys are pretty fast!”

At this moment, the group of cultivators made way for a young man in luxurious clothes to walk over slowly.

This well-dressed young man was Lin Dong.

The corners of Lin Dong’s mouth curled into a faint smile.

“You two b*tches sure move quickly. Do you really think that you are safe just because you relied on Su Changhe?”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s expression did not change in the slightest. She indifferently looked at the cultivators around her.

Elder Chen, who was beside Su Changhe, said with a solemn expression, “Young Master, you all have to be careful. These cultivators are not weak. The strongest one has reached the sixth level of the void realm.”

“It’s just the sixth level of the void realm. Elder Chen, you’re a ninth-level void realm cultivator. What’s there to be afraid of?”

Su Changhe could not understand.

Elder Chen was a little helpless. His own cultivation level was well-known, so there was no way Lin Dong merely dispatched sixth-level void realm cultivators to deal with them.

There had to be stronger cultivators from the Lin family lying in wait.

When he saw that they had been surrounded, the smile on Lin Dong’s face grew even wider. He looked at Feng Xiyun with an extremely arrogant expression.

“Little b*tch, weren’t you very arrogant just now? I’d like to see how you plan to escape my grasp today.”

Feng Xiyun did not refute him. She was simply too lazy to care about Lin Dong. However, there was not the slightest trace of fear on her face.

After all, she was the princess of the Yangli divine empire. If she was frightened by such a scene, how could she be called a princess?

“Truly impudent!”

“Open your dog eyes a little wider. How dare you speak to the princess in such a manner? I don’t think there’s a need for your Lin family to exist anymore.”

When she saw that Lin Dong dared to insult Feng Xiyun, Xin’er immediately flew into a rage.

“What? Princess?”

As soon as she finished speaking, everyone’s eyes lit up.

“You are the princess of the Yangli divine empire?”

Lin Dong’s eyes involuntarily widened as his pupils were filled with disbelief.

If the other party was really the princess of the Yangli divine empire, the Lin family was indeed in trouble.

After all, no matter how powerful the Lin family was, they were only a family under the sovereignty of the Yangli divine empire. How could they be compared to the royal family?

In contrast to Lin Dong’s panic, Su Changhe nearly jumped up in joy.

‘Oh my God, I didn’t expect this fairy to be the princess of the divine empire!’ Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

‘I’ve really struck gold this time!’

‘Hehe! When I go back, my father will surely praise me!’

Su Changhe was overjoyed.

At this moment, Lin Dong’s face was extremely ashen. His expression was as if he had just eaten a mouthful of shit.

“How can you prove that you are the princess of the divine empire? Why would the princess of the divine empire come to Qingyang City?”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun smiled as she spoke elegantly.

“I wonder how Young Master Lin wants me to prove it?”

“Well, you should at least have a token from the royal family, right? ”

“I’m really sorry. I came out in a hurry this time and didn’t bring it along,” Feng Xiyun shook her head.

She had escaped with Xin’er in a hurry, so how could she have had the time to bring the token along?

Even if she had the time, Feng Xiyun would definitely have not brought it along in case it could be traced by the royal family.

“Hehe! How can the princess of the divine empire not have the royal family’s token?”

“You b*tch, how dare you impersonate the princess! You deserve to die a thousand times. No one can protect you today!”

When he heard that Feng Xiyun did not have the royal family’s token, Lin Dong immediately laughed.
