810 Heavenly Tribulation (Part 3)

Ye Xuan’s body had been baptized by the immortal heavenly treasure. Moreover, he possessed the rainbow robe and a large amount of fate energy in his body.

All of this meant that he was far stronger than the average peak-level ancient realm expert, and it was also where the source of his confidence lay.

At this moment, Ye Xuan had already passed the heavenly tribulation for his Dao of Body Refining. Only the heavenly tribulations for the Dao of Merit and his Sword Dao remained.

With the help of his Dao Flower, Ye Xuan desperately mobilized his strength and channeled his sword aura into his body.

Ye Xuan wanted to turn his body into a sword. This was the most powerful aspect of the Sword Dao. If Ye Xuan really completed it, then his strength would undergo an earth-shattering change.

With a loud roar, dense sword beams instantly rushed toward him, emitting a huge roar.

“Oh no! Retreat quickly!”

The sword beams that Ye Xuan released actually caused the barrier to crack further.

Looking at this scene, everyone was dumbfounded. One had to know that only sealed immortal realm experts could destroy the world barrier, yet this peak-level ancient realm expert had the same level of power.

Just how terrifying was this?

At this moment, a question suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s sea of consciousness.

“What is a sword?”

This sentence lingered in Ye Xuan’s sea of consciousness repeatedly, waiting for Ye Xuan’s answer.

After Ye Xuan thought for a moment, he replied, “Everything in the world can be a sword.”

“Which sword is the strongest in your heart?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan pondered for some time before replying, “The Sword of Justice is the strongest sword!”

“The road ahead is long, and the path of an immortal is endless. Even the smallest speck of dust contains endless mysteries. This hand doesn’t hold a sword, but if there is a sword in your heart, everything can become a sword and slice even the smallest speck of dust!”

“This is the most powerful sword!”

“Very well said!”

A majestic voice rang out. In an instant, a wisp of golden light shot into Ye Xuan’s body. He had passed the Sword Dao tribulation.

Under the effect of the golden light, his Sword Dao had been greatly improved. A casual slash of his sword could cut through all things.

When he sensed that there was an extremely terrifying power flowing in his body, Ye Xuan was overjoyed.

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan activated his power without hesitation and planted the Sword Dao seed in his body. From then on, he could turn his body into a sword.

With a raise of his hand and a raise of his foot, a huge rumble was heard from the sky again, and heavenly lightning descended once again.

However, Ye Xuan was much more arrogant this time. Before the heavenly lightning descended, Ye Xuan roared, “Get lost!”

For some reason, as if hearing him, the heavenly lightning seemed to hesitate. However, Ye Xuan did not stop there. He waved his sword and condensed a terrifying sword beam that destroyed the heavenly lightning. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Seeing such a shocking scene, everyone’s jaws almost dropped.

“Heavens! This is the first time I’ve seen such a domineering scene since I was born. He can even destroy heavenly lightning?”

Those bolts of heavenly lightning originated from the laws of the world. How did Ye Xuan do it?

This was completely unexpected.

At this moment, Ye Xuan only had the Dao of Merit’s heavenly tribulation to pass.

He opened his hands and infused the power of merit into his body.

The merit power had been granted to him from purifying the vengeful spirits. Ye Xuan did not deliberately suppress it this time and allowed the merit power to be completely released.

Boom!

Ye Xuan’s body shook and trembled as the terrifying merit power wreaked havoc in Ye Xuan’s body.

The entire world shook violently, and everyone looked up at the sky at the same time.

“Did he succeed?”

Today’s events had completely refreshed their worldview.

Ancient realm experts had defeated and slain a sealed immortal realm expert, and now one of those ancient realm experts was breaking through to the sealed immortal realm in the most unbelievable way possible.

Moments later, the world once again bloomed with colors, and then no more movements were heard.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s three Dao Flowers were floating quietly in the sky. Waves of divine light shone on Ye Xuan’s body, making him look like a god.

Everyone was so shocked that they were speechless. After a while, someone said, “Oh my god, he actually did it! Our East continent actually produced a sealed immortal realm cultivator!”

A moment later, waves of cheers rang out, shaking the entire East continent. All of the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were overjoyed.

“Hehe, I’ve always thought highly of Junior Brother Ye. He really succeeded!”

Gao Shun jumped up happily and shouted these words.

“Senior Brother Ao, our sect will definitely soar to the heavens this time.”

“In the past tens of millions of years, there has never been a sealed immortal realm expert in the East Continent. However, this precedent has now been set by our Great Wilderness Divine sect. From now on, who can stop our sect?”

Gao Shun was already extremely happy at this time. The other disciples were the same.

There was only one sealed immortal realm expert in the East continent now, and he belonged to the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Even being in the same sect was a great honor and privilege.

After today’s battle, the reputation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect would become unparalleled in the East continent, as would its reputation.

With Ye Xuan as a deterrent, no other expert or force would dare to cause trouble.

At this moment, Ye Xuan spoke in a certain direction. Every word he said seemed to exude an immortal aura.

“All enemies of the Great Wilderness Divine sect shall be slain!”

After saying this, Ye Xuan coldly swept his gaze across the world barrier. Even the experts in the Heaven continent lowered their heads. They did not have the courage to meet Ye Xuan’s gaze.

The entire world fell into a strange atmosphere of silence. In the presence of a sealed immortal realm expert, no one dared to speak.

Looking at the group of experts in the Heaven continent, Ye Xuan’s expression remained very cold, but inwardly, he was extremely happy.

Although this breakthrough attempt had been extremely abrupt and risky, he had somehow managed to pull through in the end.

Then, he searched the crowd on the other side of the world barrier, but failed to find his girlfriend…
