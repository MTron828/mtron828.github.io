605 A Brand New Cloud Sky Peak

“If I lose a fight because of this in the future, won’t it be very embarrassing? Wuwuwu…”

Hearing Xiang Yun’s sobs, Feng Xiyun smiled and comforted her, “Junior Sister, you’re still young, so you won’t understand the benefits of this.”

“Although you don’t want it now, many people who want to become like this can only think about it.”

After hearing this, Xiang Yun became even more confused. She could not figure out the logic behind this no matter how much she thought about it. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

!!

Was there any benefit to being swollen?

It did not look good, and it was inconvenient for fighting. How annoying.

Yuelun once again appeared by Xiang Yun’s side. She gently rubbed her head and said, “Little girl, what should I call you?”

“My name is Xiang Yun, but the old man calls me…”

Before she could finish, Zhuge Yueyue quickly covered her mouth. She looked at Yuelun awkwardly and said, “Chief Yuelun, actually, her name is only Xiang Yun. The other one is just a joke.”

If she were to say the words “little tigress,” everyone would probably call her that in the future.

After all, this little girl was indeed quite fierce.

When she heard this, Yuelun also laughed and muttered to herself, “Xiang Yun… It’s quite a nice name.”

After saying that, Yuelun ruffled her hair again and examined Xiang Yun’s talent.

A moment later, she frowned.

‘Eh? What was going on? Why can’t I see anything?’

Yuelun was dumbfounded and felt extremely puzzled.

There seemed to be a strong power wrapped around Xiang Yun’s body, making it impossible for others to probe her.

Then, she remembered that this little girl was Ye Xuan’s disciple, so her level of talent had to be quite good.

The reason why he had concealed this little girl’s talent was probably to prevent other people with bad intentions from targeting her.

“Eh? Isn’t she a little too strong?”

Even though Xiang Yun was very young, she was not weak at all. She managed to push away her hand immediately.

Yuelun was shocked, and realized that this little girl’s strength was probably innate.

“Junior Brother Ye, I really have to congratulate you. You’ve actually obtained another disciple with unparalleled talent. She’ll definitely become an influential figure in the future!”

Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan with a smile. Although Ye Xuan still looked calm and composed, he was inwardly overjoyed. What Yuelun did not know was that Xiang Yun’s level of talent would likely be enough for her to reach the sealed immortal realm.

After a moment, Ye Xuan replied indifferently, “Cough, cough. Senior Sister Yuelun, don’t tease me anymore.”

“This disciple of mine does indeed have some talent, but that’s nothing at all. Compared to your disciples, she’s still a bit lacking.”

“There’s not much I can teach her. It’s up to her to decide what she can achieve in the future.”

Although Ye Xuan said so, he still looked a little smug.

Yuelun glared at Ye Xuan. How dare he say that her own disciples were talented?

Although she had many disciples, in terms of quality, none of them could compare to Ye Xuan’s three disciples.

He was obviously humble-bragging. Was he trying to piss her off?

“Let’s go back.”

This was simply bullying.

Yuelun then wanted to leave with the disciples of Water Sky peak.

However, the girls from the Water Sky peak were a little unwilling. After all, this little girl was really cute, and they had not finished having fun with her yet.

Moreover, this little girl was straightforward. No matter what she said, she would say whatever was on her mind and would not be polite to anyone.

Even if they kept pinching her little face, this little girl’s face was not red at all.

That being said, she was threatening to kick them if they did not stop, so they eventually acquiesced and left with Yuelun.

After everyone had left, Ye Xuan looked at his disciples and said, “Alright, let’s go back to Cloud Sky peak.”

With that, the four of them flew over to Cloud Sky peak.

Ye Xuan almost couldn’t recognize the peak when he arrived at the periphery of Cloud Sky peak. Was this still the same Cloud Sky peak?

Thanks to the efforts of the Su family, the northern part of Cloud Sky peak had been completely transformed.

The few dilapidated small residences had been transformed into new larger residences, and even a few extra buildings around.

After seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also shocked.

“This is our Cloud Sky peak now?”

Zhuge Yueyue exclaimed in surprise. At the same time, one of the Su family’s managers came over hurriedly.

“Senior Ye Xuan, you’ve finally returned.”

Looking at Ye Xuan, the manager’s face immediately brightened.

“I’ve been waiting at Cloud Sky peak for more than ten days.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned.

“Some time ago, the head of the Su family brought our people over to work on the peak,” the manager continued, “We completed the work 10 days ago.”

“However, because Senior Ye Xuan had not returned for a long time, most of the people have already rushed back. I’ve been tasked with staying behind to update you.”

“Ah, I remember now,” Ye Xuan said, patting his thigh.

He had been so busy recently that he almost forgot about this matter.

...

“Thanks for going through all this trouble. I’ll ask my disciple to make some dishes to go with wine and we can have a few drinks together,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

However, the manager waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry about it, Senior Ye Xuan.”

“I would gladly accept, but I also have to rush back to the clan to deal with other matters, so I won’t disturb you any longer.”

Hearing that he was indeed going to attend to other matters, Ye Xuan did not stop him and watched him leave.

After his figure disappeared, Ye Xuan, accompanied by his three disciples, began to look around the revitalized Cloud Sky peak.

In general, it gave people a good feeling.

‘Haha, very good. It’s quite to my liking,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself.
