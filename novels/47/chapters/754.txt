755 Mengyu (Part 2)

Furthermore, based on the tone of voice she used, they could tell that she resented Gao Shun. Was there a grudge between them? Was it just between him and the woman, or was the whole sect involved?

Everyone looked at Gao Shun in confusion.

“What is going on? Does this woman have a grudge with the Great Wilderness Divine sect? Is she here to take revenge?”

“Look at Chief Gao Shun’s expression. He definitely knows who this woman is. There’s definitely some sort of secret behind this matter.”

The people started to discuss among each other. At this moment, the elders had very ugly expressions on their faces as they stared at the woman.

Gao Shun’s emotions were already fluctuating wildly.

He cupped his fists and said respectfully, “Gao Shun greets Senior Mengyu.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hearing this, Mengyu only smiled lightly. With a wave of her hand, an immense amount of pressure descended upon everyone, causing them to tremble.

It was as if a huge mountain was pressing down on their heads, and even breathing became difficult.

Gao Shun was not doing any better either. Even as a supreme realm expert, he was powerless in front of this expert.

Mengyu said coldly, “Gao Shun, you don’t have to put up an act in front of me.”

“Back then, when you guys were fighting against the Desolate Divine sect, you gathered all of your forces and joined forces to kill me in the desert region. Did you ever think about the consequences of doing so?”

“Now… Do you people admit your mistake?”

She spoke contemptuously, as if Gao Shun was an insignificant ant.

After hearing these words, everyone instantly fell silent. Everyone stared at each other, sweating profusely, and not daring to say anything.

It was no wonder this expert came straight to Sky Mountain. It seemed that there was really a grudge between them.

Back then, did the Great Wilderness Divine sect really use everything they had to kill this expert?

However, why was there no news of such a shocking event in the East continent?

Everyone was very confused.

Gao Shun was sweating profusely at this time. After all, what she said was indeed the truth. However, none of those involved in that battle felt regret.

After a moment, Gao Shun said very calmly, “Senior Mengyu, our Great Wilderness Divine sect only acted in order to punish and eliminate evil. We did it for the peace and stability of the East continent. What’s wrong with that?”

Mengyu seemed to have already expected this response, and did not fly into a rage.

At this moment, Gao Shun seemed to have sunk into his memories. His eyes were filled with sorrow as he said, “In that battle, almost all of the members of our Great Wilderness Sect were killed by you.”

“Even Chief Tian Xuan was seriously injured and eventually passed away. It took the Great Wilderness Divine sect over 100 years to recover.”

“Even so, we still don’t feel any remorse. In any case, it’s something that our current and future disciples will be proud of.”

“What exactly are your intentions in returning to the East continent this time? Is it just to take revenge? If so, the Great Wilderness Divine sect isn’t afraid of you!”

Gao Shun said these words in a domineering manner, having made up his mind to face death head-on. That being said, his body still exhibited involuntary physiological reactions of fear. However, he did not retreat.

The disciples of the Great Wilderness divine Sect felt proud after hearing this. Even though they knew that they had no chance to win, they were still willing to fight to the death.

Looking at this scene, Mengyu’s heart trembled. It was as if she had returned to that time hundreds of years ago.

Although the group of cultivators in front of her was not the same ones as before, their determination and fervor were exactly the same.

After pondering for a while, Mengyu lowered her head to look at the broken sword that was stuck in her body. She felt it tremble.

Could it be that willpower was really indestructible?

Mengyu then looked at the forces arrayed in front of her. She was not in a hurry to attack. The words that Gao Shun had just said seemed to have a deep impact on her.

After a moment of silence, Mengyu made her decision and spoke again.

“Will you really not retreat at all?”

“If that’s the case, then I will see for myself if that is true.”

“I also know that Daoist Yi Feng is still alive and well. In that case, I’ll spare your lives this time.”

“Send word to the Great Wilderness Divine sect and tell him that he can’t hide forever. When I show up again, I will make you pay with blood. Hopefully, he will be here!”

Mengyu then left with the skeleton.

However, the berserk beasts remained, and without her commanding them, they immediately launched a furious assault on Sky Mountain’s line of defense.

At this moment, everyone joined hands to fight the berserk beasts.

After Mengyu left, the pressure they felt weighing down on their souls disappeared.

However, Gao Shun’s expression was still very ugly. After all, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before they would have to face Mengyu.

Some of the disciples hurriedly took some time to ask, “Senior Uncle Gao, what is this matter all about?”

Hua Rufeng was also very interested, and stared at Gao Shun with wide eyes, eager to know what exactly happened back then.
