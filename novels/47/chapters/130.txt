Chapter 131: How Interesting

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, as the cultivator’s realm increased, the spiritual sense strength requirement would also increase.

Taking Ye Xuan’s current strength for example, if his spiritual sense was only at the level of an ordinary true core realm cultivator, then he would probably only be able to display 10% of his strength.

The power contained in the dantian included qi power, spiritual power, true essence power, purple spirit power, and so on.

The stronger a cultivator’s soul was, the stronger his spiritual sense power would be, and vice versa.

If one’s soul was strong enough, one could leave one’s physical body and exist eternally in the world.

At that time, even if the body was destroyed, it could be reborn through the soul again.

After Ye Xuan stepped into the unity realm, his soul was already capable of leaving his body, but unfortunately. Unfortunately, this state could not be maintained for too long.

After all, the human soul was too fragile.

“Sigh, if Yue and Li Qingyan were by my side, I would be able to use the system to maximize the value of this Mi Duo flower!”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan could not help but show a regretful expression.

The Mi Duo flower was extremely fragile. If it was not taken quickly after being plucked, it would wither.

Not being able to use the system was a waste. Still, to be able to encounter such a spiritual object in the mystic realm was already a tremendous opportunity.

Ye Xuan no longer hesitated. He plucked the Mi Duo flower and consumed it.

The energy inside the Mi Duo flower turned into specks of starlight and slowly poured into Ye Xuan’s dantian. Then, it gathered into his soul.

The starlight energy was very gentle. It slowly wrapped itself around his spiritual sense, and then began to pulse.

As time slowly passed, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense became more and more turbulent.

Almost a day later, Ye Xuan slowly opened his eyes. Then he extended his index finger. Invisible gusts of energy suddenly flowed out.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

Now he had perfect control over the power in his dantian. He could easily divide his power into threads and distribute them accurately.

“I didn’t expect the energy contained inside the Mi Duo flower to be beyond my imagination. The Moon Demon mystic realm really lives up to its name!”

Whoosh!

Ye Xuan then turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

…

Hundreds of kilometers away, there was a huge mountain that seemed to touch the sky. At the top of the mountain, there was a crooked tree.

The crooked tree looked very ugly, but at the top of the tree, there was a bright golden fruit.

The golden fruit was very strange. On the surface, it looked like the face of Buddha. When a gentle breeze blew past, it seemed to emit the sound of chanting.

The crooked tree itself also emitted strands of mysterious power.

Several streaks of light suddenly appeared on the quiet mountain.

Whoosh!

Four brilliant streaks of light tore through the sky from different directions. Their target was the golden fruit at the top of the mountain.

Two of them were faster, leaving the other two far behind.

Ye Xuan was among the four, but he was much slower than the other three.

Of course, this was on purpose.

The fastest was a muscular middle-aged man. Although he was still hundreds of meters away from the golden fruit, he suddenly stretched out his hand and transformed his spiritual power into a powerful suction force, pulling at the fruit.

“Hmph! Who is trying to snatch my opportunity!”

Suddenly, a cold voice rang out.

The other middle-aged man used a secret technique and increased his speed.

“I’ll give you three seconds to leave. Otherwise, don’t blame this old man for being ruthless!”

At this moment, an aged voice leisurely spoke.

As soon as he finished speaking, an old man suddenly appeared in front of the two middle-aged men. With a slight wave of his hand, a powerful force suddenly swept out.

When the two middle-aged men saw this, their expressions changed and they hurriedly stopped in their tracks!

“Peak of the core formation realm?”

Immediately, the two middle-aged men decisively chose to give up on the golden fruit. They then turned around and left.

Although they were unwilling, how could they compete with a super expert at the peak of the core formation realm?

“You… Aren’t you afraid of death?”

The old man noticed that Ye Xuan was still leisurely flying over. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

His gaze turned cold, and a hint of killing intent flashed across his eyes.

At this moment, the golden fruit was right behind the old man.

“I will also give you a choice. Leave within three seconds, or you’ll die,” Ye Xuan said calmly.

He was determined to obtain that golden fruit. It was an extremely rare treasure, the Buddha Spirit Fruit!

It could increase a cultivator’s comprehension value!

“Hahaha, how ridiculous! Young people really don’t know what’s good for them!”

Seeing this, the old man smiled coldly. His eyes were filled with monstrous killing intent.

Moments later, the old man raised his shriveled arm and his hand formed a fist.

In an instant, a burst of violent energy emerged as his spiritual power transformed into a glowing fist that smashed toward Ye Xuan.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s expression did not change in the slightest. He also slowly raised his hand and also threw a punch.

When the two waves of fists collided, they miraculously canceled each other out.

“Huh?”

Seeing this, the old man revealed a surprised expression.

This was too much of a coincidence. How could the force contained within those fists be canceled out so perfectly?

After his spiritual sense had been tempered by the Mi Duo flower, his control over the power in his dantian had reached an extremely terrifying level.

Therefore, he could accurately analyze the amount of power contained in the old man’s attack, and respond appropriately.

“How interesting!”

Suddenly, a hint of curiosity flashed through the old man’s eyes. Then he reached out and took out a sharp ax from his storage space.

Boom!

The spiritual power in the old man’s body gushed out and poured into the ax. The edge of the ax seemed like it could destroy heaven and earth. Then, he swung it at Ye Xuan.
