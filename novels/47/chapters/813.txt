814 Seven-Colored Stone

After sending his two disciples back to rest, Ye Xuan flew over to Cloud Sky Cave with Xiang Yun in his arms.

He would be much more at ease if he left Xiang Yun here.

“Oh?”

Just as he was about to turn around and leave after settling her down, Ye Xuan suddenly noticed that the seven-colored stone beside the pool was releasing a faint light.

Stunned, he hurriedly went forward and carefully examined it. Only then did he discover that mysterious divine runes had actually appeared on this seven-colored stone.

After pondering for a while, Ye Xuan realized that these divine runes actually detailed an extremely powerful inheritance cultivation technique.

“Oh my god… Could this seven-colored stone be becoming a life form?”

Ye Xuan was extremely surprised. This was something he did not expect at all.

It was important to understand that only powerful berserk beasts would experience such a phenomenon in this world. After all, they were born with their own cultivation techniques innately.

However, this seven-colored stone was different. Was it not just a stone? Why would it give birth to a cultivation technique?

Would it become a rock spirit?

Then, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“The Invincible Golden Body detailed on this stone is really not bad. Hahaha, it belongs to me now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan covered the Rainbow Stone with his hand and immediately took away the divine runes.

At this moment, the seven-colored stone seemed to be nervous. It did not have its own consciousness, so it did not know what was going on.

It only knew that the item that belonged to it seemed to have been taken away by someone else.

In a moment of impatience, the sound of the water flowing out could be heard.

“What happened?”

Hearing this sudden sound, Ye Xuan was a little dumbfounded.

What exactly was this seven-colored stone? What was its origin? Why could it produce sounds?

At this moment, another loud sound rang out, and the stone shattered, and a small thing covered in fur rolled out.

In the blink of an eye, Cloud Sky peak released dazzling divine light, and this little furball instantly sped away into the distance.

Ye Xuan watched this happen blankly, but when he came back to his senses, he chased after it without hesitation.

Soon, he arrived at a peach garden near the East Sea. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Oh? Where are you hiding?”

Seeing a group of wild monkeys, Ye Xuan was a little dumbfounded. As a sealed immortal realm expert, he actually lost track of the little furball?

Who would believe this?

Then, a furry monkey whose entire body was emitting dazzling light appeared.

“Haha, you were hiding here…”

Seeing it jumping and running around on the beach, Ye Xuan did not interfere. Instead, he stared at the scene with interest.

An idea suddenly appeared in his mind.

“It really was a monkey. This is too interesting…”

If he guessed correctly, this little monkey was definitely not a well-behaved creature.

He had just stolen its divine runes. If he were to teach the cultivation to it in the future, would he be able to receive a reward from the system?

Although it was a little shameless, he felt that it was possible.

Down below, the golden furry monkey was already approaching the group of monkeys.

After all, it had appeared here out of nowhere, so the monkey king was wary of it.

“Little monkey, where did you come from? What is your purpose in coming here?”

The monkey king immediately began to interrogate him. Its tail was raised high, as if it was ready to fight at any moment.

The little monkey was also at a loss at this moment. After thinking for a while, it did not know how to answer this question.

It only vaguely remembered that he had stayed in a cave for a long time.

Moreover, there had been someone cultivating in the cave then, and it had relied on the spiritual energy that overflowed from that person’s cultivation to improve itself.

However, he did not remember what the person cultivating in the cave looked like.

After thinking for a long time, the little monkey answered frankly, “I came from a very large cave.”

“Oh?”

When the other monkeys heard this answer, they were very puzzled.

At this moment, the monkey king was still very vigilant as it examined the little furry monkey in front of it. It had never seen a monkey with golden fur before.

It glanced at a big-faced monkey beside it and ordered it to go and check the little furry monkey out.

At this moment, the big-faced monkey also came forward with a cautious expression. It stretched out its hand and touched the fur of the little monkey before asking, “Which species of monkey are you? Why have I never seen someone like you before?”

The little monkey was also dumbfounded at this moment. It could only reply weakly, “I just broke out of a seven-colored stone, so I don’t know which species I belong to.”

Upon hearing this answer, all of the monkeys present were speechless.

There was actually such a thing?

Could it be that some otherworldly monkey had done the unthinkable deed to a seven-colored stone? How shocking!

“Since you came from a stone, then are you a stone monkey?”

“Yes, that’s it.”

Hearing this answer, the monkey was very satisfied and laughed.

The little furry monkey did not seem to be afraid of strangers at all. It had only been born today, but it was getting along well with this group of monkeys..

During this period of time, the monkey king tested the strength of this little furry monkey to see if it was qualified to become a member of the monkey group.

However, who would have expected that the two had just started to exchange blows when the strong monkey king was knocked down.

Soon after, the little furry monkey became the current monkey king.

In the world of monkeys, the strong would lead. Only those with strength could protect the monkey group and allow the monkey group to develop better.

The little furry monkey had only punched the monkey king once before knocking it to the ground.

Ye Xuan was paying attention to the scene, but he did not interfere…
