Chapter 55: The Drastic Change in Jiangqing City

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In such a short time, Li Qingyan’s strength had undergone an earth-shaking change. They naturally knew the reason behind this.

This could only be explained by spiritual power infusion.

After all, Li Qingyan had just become Ye Xuan’s disciple. Somehow, the latter had already made such a huge sacrifice for her.

Was this guy sure that he was recruiting disciples? Why did it feel like he was raising daughters?

Although Huang Ling and Xue Min were very close to Ye Xuan’s age, if conditions allowed, they also wanted to become Ye Xuan’s disciples.

Thinking this, their hearts were filled with envy.

Back then, an impulsive decision had caused them to miss out on becoming the disciple of the best teacher on the Tianyuan continent. Moreover, this teacher was so handsome and powerful, but they were not fated with him.

Could this be any worse?

However, although they could not get him in reality, they could at least dream about him, right?

Huang Ling and Xue Min could only comfort themselves in this way.

When Li Qingyan stepped out of the training ground, Li Zhengyang and the elders quickly surrounded her.

The elders’ eyes fell on Li Qingyan, and they could not help but feel a little awkward around her.

No one would expect these purple spirit realm elders to lower themselves so much in front of an eighth-level true essence realm cultivator.

......

Of course, this was the benefit of being powerful.

Not only had Li Qingyan’s strength suddenly skyrocketed, the most important thing was that the person behind Li Qingyan was the most powerful elder of the Qingyun sect, Ye Xuan!

Moreover, they had also overheard the conversation between Li Qingyan and Yue just now and understood that the change in Li Qingyan’s strength was indeed related to Ye Xuan.

It was obvious that Ye Xuan loved his disciples very much and was not stingy when it came to nurturing his disciples.

In other words, as long as Ye Xuan existed, Li Qingyan and Yue’s future was limitless.

“Qingyan, I wonder if Elder Ye…”

Among the many higher-ups of the Li family, only Li Zhengyang’s expression was quite natural.

Even so, when Li Zhengyang’s gaze fell on his daughter, his expression unconsciously became somewhat reserved.

“Teacher is still in secluded cultivation in the cultivation room!” Li Qingyan said with a smile.

“In that case, I’ll immediately send out an order that no one is allowed to disturb Elder Ye Xuan’s cultivation room!” Li Zhengyang said quickly.

The other elders nodded in agreement.

…

Time passed quickly and, soon, two days had passed.

During this period, Yue had been Li Qingyan’s sparring partner.

It had to be said that cultivators with high comprehension value were different. Within just two days, Li Qingyan had almost completely grasped her newfound strength.

Now, she was fighting on equal terms with Yue. Moreover, even if Yue used all of her strength, she could not gain any advantage.

The cultivation of these two disciples had been improved by Ye Xuan’s spiritual power infusion. The spiritual power in their Dantian far exceeded that of ordinary cultivators, and they were both very strong.

Therefore, now that Li Qingyan could make full use of her three-minor-realm advantage, Yue was unable to defeat her.

If Li Qingyan properly mastered all of the martial techniques that Ye Xuan had imparted to her, then Yue would lose to Li Qingyan in a head-on fight.

However, Ye Xuan would perform spiritual power infusion monthly, which would narrow the gap between them.

Now that the Sword Jade physique in Yue’s body had been completely awakened, her innate bone value had been greatly improved. Naturally, she could now withstand more spiritual power infusion.

However, Yue had always remembered Ye Xuan’s instructions. She did not slack off in her cultivation at all.

Now that her huge grudge had been resolved, she was no longer obsessed over revenge. She only wanted to be by her teacher’s side. She also hoped that she could become stronger quickly and catch up with her teacher as much as possible.

She also hoped that one day she could fight alongside her teacher.

Although she knew that she might never be able to catch up with Ye Xuan in this lifetime, she still chose to give it her all.

At least this way, if her teacher needed her in the future, she could be of use.

“Junior Sister! You have properly grasped your newfound power. With my current strength, I can no longer be your sparring partner! If you want to gain some actual combat experience, you will have to wait for Teacher to come out of seclusion!”

The Rampart Sword technique was activated. The longsword in Yue’s hand filled the sky with sword qi. After blocking Li Qingyan’s attack with great difficulty, she stopped the fight.

“Senior Sister is too modest. Although I have an advantage in terms of my cultivation realm, I still have a lot to learn from Senior Sister in terms of cultivation methods and martial techniques!” Li Qingyan said with a smile.

Immediately after, Li Qingyan asked Yue for advice on cultivation methods and martial techniques.

Yue did not hide anything. She imparted all of her experience and insights to Li Qingyan.

Li Qingyan’s comprehension value was extremely high. She quickly understood the insights that Yue had imparted to her. Although there were some parts that she was still confused about, after Yue’s explanation, she immediately understood them.

Of course, Yue did not slack off. She worked extremely hard to improve her cultivation level. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The comprehension value of these two women far exceeded that of ordinary cultivators. By helping each other, they further improved their cultivation speed.

However, just as the two of them were wholeheartedly cultivating, a huge change occurred in Jiangqing City.

The Chen family finally could no longer suppress their ambitions and made a move against the Zhu family.

The Chen family wanted to subdue the Zhu family, but the Zhu family members had already seen through the Chen family’s intentions. Moreover, the Zhu family was different from the Li family, so there was no possibility of a marriage alliance.

If they really chose to submit, the Chen family would certainly borrow the power of the Mad Saber sect and directly eliminate the Zhu family’s upper echelons.

After that, the Chen family would definitely completely erode the Zhu family’s strength bit by bit.

At that time, the Zhu family would be completely annihilated.

Moreover, the Zhu family had previously cooperated with the Chen family, so the two families were very clear about each other’s intentions.

It was precisely because of this that the Zhu family decisively rejected the Chen family’s conditions.

If the end result was destruction either way, then why not take the opportunity before the Mad Saber sect’s leader arrived to directly lead their entire family to evacuate Jiangqing City?

Unfortunately, the Chen family had also seen through the Zhu family’s plans. The moment they received the news from their spies, the Chen family did not hesitate to make their move.

Not only did they interfere with the Zhu family’s plans in the city, they even sent people outside the city to kill the members of the Zhu family.

The alliance between the two families was shattered.

The Zhu family had actually been considering cooperating with the Li family but, unfortunately, the Li family had rejected them.

Even if the two families joined hands, their combined strength would be insufficient to deal with the Mad Saber sect. Moreover, at that time, the Li family was thinking of forming a marriage alliance with the Chen family to protect the family, so they rejected the Zhu family’s request for cooperation.
