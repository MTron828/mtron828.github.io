“Fellow Daoist Tongtian, if I’m not wrong, you are referring to my junior brother from Cloud Sky peak,” Gongsun Shouyue said with a smile.

“Oh? So the rumors are true? The Great Wilderness Divine sect truly has a young mystic lord realm expert?”

Elder Tongtian was surprised. He was no stranger to Cloud Sky peak, but its reputation had been earned by Chief Tian Xuan.

Gongsun Shouyue chuckled when he heard this.

“Junior Brother Ye Xuan is the disciple that Chief Tian Xuan took in when he was still alive. He’s a low-key person and has never placed much importance on fame and glory.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“He’s been with our sect for slightly over a hundred years, but has mostly remained on Cloud Sky peak the entire time.”

Elder Tongtian was even more surprised to hear this.

“A mere hundred years… yet he reached the mystic lord realm?”

Just how terrifying was Ye Xuan’s talent?

Elder Tongtian suddenly glanced at Mu Beichen.

It seemed that Ye Xuan’s talent far exceeded Mu Beichen’s.

His expression turned serious.

Mu Beichen was not only the Saint of the Mu family, but also the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect. He had an innate Dao body and possessed the potential to reach the sealed immortal realm.

He was a once-in-a-generation genius. However, if Ye Xuan’s talent exceeded his, did Ye Xuan have a constitution that surpassed Mu Beichen’s innate Dao body?

While they were discussing, a figure dressed in white came over.

“Teacher, that person is the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan,” Mu Beichen quickly said to Elder Tongtian as soon as he saw Ye Xuan.

Elder Tongtian was stunned when he saw Ye Xuan.

‘What Gongsun Shouyue said was true! This person was really talented and had the potential to become a sealed immortal realm expert!’

‘The Great Wilderness Divine sect is going to rise!’

By this time, Ye Xuan had reached the group.

“Greetings, Senior Brother Gongsun,” Ye Xuan offered his greetings, then went to his allocated seat and sat down.

Gongsun Shouyue quickly introduced the others to Ye Xuan with a smile.

“Junior Brother, this is the great elder of the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect, Elder Tongtian.”

“He came here specifically to observe the Seven Peaks competition. Oh right, we were just talking about you as well. Talk about good timing.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes narrowed, and he looked at Elder Tongtian.

However, when he noticed Mu Beichen beside Elder Tongtian, he came to a realization as to how word had gotten out.

“Chief Ye Xuan, we meet again,” Mu Beichen said respectfully.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded.

At this moment, Elder Tongtian said with a smile, “I’ve heard great things about Chief Ye Xuan. Now that I’ve seen you myself, I can say that you really live up to your reputation. I truly admire you.”

“Elder Tongtian, you’re too kind. Compared to you, my experience is far too lacking. I have much to learn from you in the future,” Ye Xuan said very modestly.

Elder Tongtian was surprised to see this.

In the face of such praise, this fellow could still remain so calm. This state of mind was rare among cultivators.

“Hahaha! Chief Ye Xuan is too humble!”

“The strong are respected in the mystic world, so Chief Ye Xuan is someone who we should consider a fellow peer, not a junior.”

“Speaking of which, I’m a few hundred years older than you, but am also a mystic lord realm cultivator. Compared to you, my progress has been shameful.”

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say much.

Nearby, Gao Shun was looking at Ye Xuan expressionlessly, cursing madly in his heart.

‘Hmph! I’ll see how long you can remain smug!’

He would show Elder Tongtian just which peak was the strongest faction in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Ye Xuan might be strong, but the same could not be said for his disciples.

Gao Shun had deliberately arranged for them to fight two powerful cultivators from Hidden Sword peak in the first round. Even though they were just meant to probe Ye Xuan’s disciples’ strength, it would be best if they could eliminate Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

That would be something he would never let Ye Xuan live down.

“Those two are your disciples, right?”

At this moment, Elder Tongtian’s gaze fell on Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue.
