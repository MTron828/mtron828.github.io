Chapter 199: Danger Lurks Everywhere

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

According to the rumors, in order to completely kill a tenth-level unity realm expert, one had to have comprehended a martial intent with destructive properties, such as the violent fire intent or the heavenly lightning intent, and so on.

Most importantly, there was an extremely high requirement with regards to the level of that cultivator’s intent.

For example, if one wanted to kill a tenth-level unity realm expert with sword intent, one had to reach the seventh or eighth-level of sword intent.

Although a sixth or seventh-level unity realm expert was not as terrifying as a tenth-level unity realm expert, it was not something that Ye Xuan could deal with currently.

“It seems that I have to leave behind one of the pattern condensation offensive jade tokens to ensure the safety of the Qingyun sect.”

He planned to leave more unity realm offensive jade tokens, alongside a single pattern condensation realm offensive jade token, which would be their trump card.

Using it should be able to resolve any current crisis. After all, no matter how powerful the Nether God sect was, they would not send out a pattern condensation realm expert. Such experts would not make a move personally for a mere personal disciple and elder.

Moreover, the Nether God sect might not even have a pattern condensation realm expert.

The Nether God sect was not the only threat. When the Yunjin Temple and the Blood Moon Temple’s investigations discovered Ye Xuan’s actions, they would definitely send over experts as well.

This was especially true for the Blood Moon Temple, who were far more arrogant in their ways. How could they tolerate anyone besmirching their dignity?

Anyone who offended them would not be spared even if they fled to the ends of the earth.

Moreover, Ye Xuan was a monstrous genius who would keep growing and become a future threat. However, if they acted quickly, they would be able to remove this threat before it became dangerous.

Across the Nanzhou Region, the Blood Moon Temple’s strength might not be the most terrifying, but it was definitely the most famous and also the faction that countless cultivators feared.

After all, they had survived the joint attack of countless powerful factions and even retaliated, laying waste to those factions.

Back then, the Great Qian Dynasty had a unity realm expert overseeing it.

However, this expert had died in that shocking battle, causing the Great Qian Dynasty’s strength to plummet.

At that time, because the patriarch of the Xuanyin sect, Ming He, was in closed-door cultivation, and his strength was not particularly strong at that time, he was lucky enough to escape.

However, after that shocking battle, no faction dared to challenge the prestige of the Blood Moon Temple.

Furthermore, the Blood Moon Temple was not afraid of any other force except the Divine Gate.

Therefore, compared to the Nether God sect, Ye Xuan was more worried about the Blood Moon Temple.

“No matter what, I have to bring Yan’er back first!”

Now that the power of the Void Herb was constantly strengthening his Sword Overlord body, he was confident that he could upgrade it before he reached the White Moon Tower.

At that time, his strength would greatly increase.

Previously, when he gave Yue the chance to awaken the Sword Jade body, he had also awakened the Sword Overlord body through the system’s reward. At that time, he had instantly gained comprehension of the second level of sword intent.

Therefore, once the Sword Overlord body was upgraded, his sword intent would advance in tandem with it.

At that time, even if there really were sixth or seventh-level unity realm experts attacking the Qingyun sect, he would not fear them.

Soon after, Ye Xuan refined some offensive jade tokens, as well as some, but fewer, protective jade tokens and auxiliary jade tokens.

Refining jade tokens was not a simple matter. Ye Xuan spent half a day refining seventeen jade tokens.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan called Wan Shanhai and the other elders over.

When they heard what Ye Xuan had to say, their expressions instantly turned grave.

Whether it was the Nether God sect, the Yunjin Temple, or the Blood Moon Temple, they were all terrifying existences in the Nanzhou Region.

Not to mention the Qingyun sect, even the Great Qian Dynasty was just an ant in their eyes.

However, Wan Shanhai and the others had also heard of Ye Xuan’s feats in the Tower of Heaven, so they naturally knew of Ye Xuan’s terrifying strength.

Still, even Ye Xuan might not be able to stop such behemoth factions.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and 21 Jade tokens suddenly appeared.

The jade tokens that he had just refined, together with the ones he had obtained through the system’s rewards, as well as one pattern condensation realm offensive jade tokens, made for a total of 21 jade tokens.

The pattern condensation realm offensive jade token would be the Qingyun sect’s trump card, and saved for the last moment when the sect was in dire straits.

In any case, if everything went as planned, the Qingyun sect would not need to use this trump card before he returned.

“These… These are all the jade tokens that you refined?”

Wan Shanhai’s pupils constricted when he saw this. He looked at the jade tokens that were floating in their air with shock in his eyes.

The other elders were also similarly shocked.

“That’s right! These 17 jade tokens all contain my power. After crushing them, you can unleash one of my peak-strength attacks!”

Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and drew a line, dividing the jade tokens.

“Your peak-strength attack?”

Hearing this, everyone was once again shocked.

Other cultivators refined jade tokens casually, but Ye Xuan actually poured all of his power into them.

Although they did not know Ye Xuan’s actual strength, how could an existence that could tear space apart be weak? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“This jade token contains the power of a pattern condensation realm attack! It’s an extremely powerful offensive jade token!”

Ye Xuan pointed at a jade token that was emitting bright divine light.
