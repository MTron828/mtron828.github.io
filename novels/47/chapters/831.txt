832 Ye Xuan’s Disciple (Part 1)

The people from the Xuan continent looked down on Zhuge Yueyue, but who would have thought that this little girl would be so strong?

She was much stronger than the two who had appeared not long ago.

“Where did she come from? I really didn’t expect such a talented genius to appear in the East continent.”

They discussed this matter with great interest, but no one knew her background. After the first exchange of blows, the golden-furred growler was starting to feel nervous.

“I don’t kill nameless people. Report your name,” The golden-furred growler said forcefully.

Zhuge Yueyue was much more powerful than the previous two, and he was very curious about her identity and origin.

Zhuge Yueyue smiled coldly and said, “Then listen carefully. I’m the chief of the East continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak, and I’m also Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple, Zhuge Yueyue.”

“This…”

As soon as she finished speaking, everyone revealed expressions of surprise and shock. They had all heard of Ye Xuan. After the ancient tomb incident, news about him had already begun to spread throughout the other continents.

Moreover, they had already learned of the fact that Ye Xuan was the East continent’s sole sealed immortal realm expert, and that he had slain another sealed immortal realm expert as an ancient realm cultivator.

Therefore, after learning about Zhuge Yueyue’s background, the golden-furred growler’s expression changed drastically.

“The disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert…”

He panickedly looked around Zhuge Yueyue. Thankfully, her teacher did not seem to be around. However, that did not alleviate the pressure he felt.

“So you are actually Immortal Ye’s disciple. I was rude just now.”

The golden-furred growler no longer dared to be arrogant.

Zhuge Yueyue replied coldly, “Just hurry up and attack.”

She pulled out her sword and pointed it at the golden-furred growler. Her eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.

This battle was being observed by more and more experts in secret. They all wanted to take a good look at how powerful the disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert would be.

“Interesting, interesting. The disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert against a golden-furred growler…”

“Let’s make some predictions. Who will be the final victor?”

In a certain place, a few old men were chatting softly.

When they learned that this woman was actually Ye Xuan’s disciple, more and more people rushed over, even those from the Heaven continent.

Hovering in the air, Old Master Sun stared at Zhuge Yueyue without blinking.

Some time ago, he had learned from Yanran that there was also a Great Wilderness Divine sect in the East continent, and that their sects were one and the same.

At first, Old Master Sun was still in disbelief, but now he finally believed it. He now wanted to know more about the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the East continent.

If they had a good foundation, when the eight continents were unified, both sides could seriously consider reuniting. As the two sects had been separated for too long, reunification might be quite difficult.

However, there were indeed benefits of doing so, as they would be able to complete their incomplete cultivation techniques.

When he saw Zhuge Yueyue drawing her sword, the golden-furred growler became even more nervous, and looked around.

More and more experts had already arrived to watch the show. This was the true showdown between the two continents.

The golden-furred growler was beginning to regret what he had done. It seemed that his words had fished out a top genius in the East continent.

However, judging from the current situation, he had to fight.

‘Damn it! She is indeed extraordinary. Her sword aura is bone-chilling.’

‘From the looks of it, her achievements in the Sword Dao might have already reached a terrifying level,’ the golden-furred growler thought to himself.

He could not allow himself to lose or back down though, especially with everyone watching. He carried the pride of the Xuan continent on his shoulders.

The golden-furred growler roared and unleashed monstrous flames.

“Bring it on. Today, I will see just how powerful a disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert is.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the golden-furred growler stomped on the ground, causing the entire ground to tremble violently, as he unleashed a powerful attack at Zhuge Yueyue.

However, Zhuge Yueyue simply smiled and remained calm. When the golden-furred growler was about to reach her, she stomped her right foot on the ground, and an eight-trigram formation appeared under her feet. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Waves of power were released, which collided with the power of the golden-furred growler.
