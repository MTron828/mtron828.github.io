830 My Turn

“Who the hell are you? You actually have the guts to provoke me?”

The golden-furred growler laughed mockingly when it saw Yun Hai appear,

“Don’t tell me that you don’t have any experts in the East continent? Is he really a representative, or just cannon fodder?”

Upon hearing this, the faces of the East continent’s geniuses changed drastically, and they all wanted to rush out and beat the golden-furred growler up.

“Damn it, isn’t this b*stard too arrogant?”

“There are many geniuses in our East continent! This b*stard is spouting nonsense!”

Today’s battle was already a matter of honor for the two continents.

After realizing that the enemy was looking down on him, Yun Hai did not seem angry at all. The corners of his mouth even curled up slightly as he unleashed his sword aura.

“Oh? This guy actually has some skills!”

Everyone was quite surprised at this time. They really did not expect that this person, who was ruthlessly suppressed by Xiang Yun back then, would actually be worth watching.

The moment Yun Hai released his sword aura, the golden-furred growler finally started to take him seriously.

“Haha, I didn’t expect you to have some ability, but that’s the extent of it.”

“Anyway, since that monkey has already run away, you’ll have to bear the brunt of my wrath for it!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the golden-furred growler once again released dense flames, as fiery divine runes appeared around his body.

“Argh!”

They had only just exchanged blows, but Yun Hai was instantly defeated and fell to the ground.

Seeing this scene, the surroundings fell silent.

“This…”

“That’s it?”

“How could it be so fast?”

After a series of boos, Yun Hai stood up with an ugly expression.

He could already clearly sense the disdain of the people around him, and his face turned red.

“Damn it, I’ve really screwed myself over this time.”

In fact, his cultivation technique was quite powerful, but the most important thing was that he needed a long time to accumulate strength. Before he was fully prepared, the enemy had already pounced on him, leaving him no room to retaliate.

Now, he had shamed himself in battle twice. Once to Xiang Yun, and the second time to the golden-furred growler.

F*ck!

“Pfft, I thought he was very strong, but it turns out that he’s also a useless piece of trash.”

After easily obtaining victory, the golden-furred growler laughed out loud, becoming even more unrestrained.

“Could it be that this is all that the East continent has?”

“Can no one last for more than a few moves?”

“Sigh… I have indeed overestimated the East continent.”

Seeing the golden-furred growler’s arrogant appearance, the people of the East continent were all angry, but the people of the Xuan continent were cheering and laughing.

“Great! From the looks of it, the East continent was really weak.”

“Is this really the place where a sealed immortal realm expert appeared? Hahaha!”

As they listened to the taunts, the hot-blooded cultivators from the East continent involuntarily clenched their fists. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The golden-furred growler was right in front of them, but why wasn’t anyone able to defeat it?

“Damn it!”

At this moment, Gao Shun was already furious. He wished he could rush up and smack the face of the golden-furred growler. However, as an elder, he could not make a move at all. After all, this battle belonged to members of the younger generation. If even the older generation made a move, it would only cause the conflict to escalate for no reason.

“Tianyu, go!”

Gao Shun was so angry that looked at Gao Tianyu behind him and shouted. Everyone turned to look at Gao Tianyu, which scared him.

What was his father doing? Was he possessed?

This golden-furred growler was clearly much stronger than he was. If he were to go up and fight, the only outcome would be defeat or death!

Gao Tianyu was dumbfounded. He said, “Dad, don’t mess with me. I haven’t even reached the peak of the void realm yet!”

After hearing this, Gao Shun finally came back to his senses.

Finally, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Yueyue, you go.”

Zhuge Yueyue had been waiting for her teacher’s order, and immediately soared into the sky like a fairy.

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue take action, the crowd immediately began to discuss fervently.

“Oh my god, it’s Zhuge Yueyue!”

“She’s the eldest disciple of a sealed immortal realm expert!”

“She finally took action!”

Thanks to Ye Xuan’s feats, Zhuge Yueyue was the most famous genius of the younger generation. No matter where she went, she would always shine.

After seeing her appear, Gao Shun shouted even more excitedly, “Very good!”

“With Martial Niece Zhuge here, this matter will be settled!”
