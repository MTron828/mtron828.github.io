592 Fast Like A Phoenix

‘F*ck! I definitely can’t compare myself to this guy, or else I’ll die of jealousy,’ Gao Shun thought to himself.

Ye Xuan was still observing the situation around him while hovering on the Godsword. He then waved his hand, and teleported his two disciples to his side.

“Both of you head over to your martial uncle’s side and stay there. Don’t wander around.”

“Alright, we understand.”

!!

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun nodded. Their faces were pale. After all, they had been traveling with their teacher this entire time. However, the speed at which they had been flying was too terrifying!

This was an experience that they had never experienced before, and even they felt slightly dizzy after the trip.

After watching his two disciples move to safety, Ye Xuan fixed his eyes on Mo Nan.

“May I ask who you are?” Mo Nan’s face was drained of blood, and his legs seemed to be trembling.

He felt a strong sense of danger from Ye Xuan. It was almost like he was standing in front of Chief Tian Xuan back then.

Ye Xuan simply replied, “I am the disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Chief Tian Xuan, and the current chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan.”

Hearing this familiar name, Mo Nan’s heart trembled.

“You’re Tian Xuan’s disciple?”

Mo Nan stared unblinkingly at the young man before him. He had never expected this young man to be Tian Xuan’s disciple.

He even felt that the sense of danger this young man exuded was more threatening than Tian Xuan’s back then.

Mo Nan had already been suppressed by Tian Xuan then. Was he now going to be suppressed by Tian Xuan’s disciple as well?

The more he thought about it, the more unwilling he was. Mo Nan was already gritting his teeth, exuding an even more powerful aura. The shame and embarrassment he felt was unbearable.

He was unwilling to give up, so he channeled all of the spiritual power in his body. With a loud boom, a bolt of purple lightning flashed across the sky.

“Is that… a heaven-grade divine power?”

The crowd was shocked and looked in his direction.

Right after the purple lightning appeared, Mo Nan’s aura changed drastically, as if he had become a completely different person.

His hands were slowly moving, and lightning kept flashing around him.

Moments later, countless lightning bolts fell and formed a formation around him.

“I don’t care who you are, but since you dared to invade my Immortal Divine sect, I’ll make sure that this becomes your burial place!”

With the aid of the lightning formation, the aura emanating from Mo Nan grew even more terrifying, instantly forcing everyone nearby to retreat.

However, Ye Xuan was still standing firmly on the Godsword. He leapt forward with a calm expression and rushed into the lightning formation that Mo Nan had set up.

“Good! Let me see the power that gave you the courage to say such words!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan activated his Boundless Palm technique, and a huge palm imprint condensed in front of him.

In the next moment, a long lightning dragon condensed and charged directly at the palm imprint that Ye Xuan had condensed.

Boom!

Accompanied by a loud roar, energy shockwaves swept out, but the two people hovering in the air were still standing steadily in place, having not even moved a single step backward. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan also began to get serious. He reached out and touched the lightning around him, thinking to himself, ‘This lightning formation is indeed powerful…’

The divine power Mo Nan had used was the infinite lightning bolt formation, a secret technique from ancient times.

After activating this technique, it would form a lightning formation around the user.

If an enemy barged into this formation, they would be attacked by endless lightning bolts, which were very powerful. Furthermore, it would also enhance the strength of its user to a certain extent.

“Brat, you’re quite courageous. You actually dared to enter my lightning formation headfirst.”

Mo Nan looked at Ye Xuan sarcastically, as if he was looking at a dead man.

This person’s combat strength was quite good, but he was too arrogant.

“In this lightning formation, I am invincible! No matter who comes to save you, it won’t help!”

With those words, Mo Nan promptly launched an attack, hurling a fist that was crackling with lightning.

Because he was trapped in the formation, the attack reached Ye Xuan almost instantaneously.

However, in terms of speed, Ye Xuan had the fiery phoenix divine power.

“Haha! Do you think you’re very fast, stinky old man?”

Ye Xuan laughed sarcastically. Before Mo Nan’s giant lightning fist could land on him, he disappeared without a trace.

One could see blurry red streaks in his wake.

When Ye Xuan’s figure reappeared, he was already outside the formation.

“What? No way!”

Mo Nan’s expression changed drastically, unable to believe what he was seeing.

Ye Xuan could actually come and go as he pleased in the lightning formation like a fish in water?
