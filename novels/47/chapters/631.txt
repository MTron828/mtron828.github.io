632 Oh, Is That Yours?

Ye Xuan still wanted Xiang Yun to learn how to read. After all, it was a basic life skill. Without it, she would not be able to embark on the path of spiritual cultivation, which would really be a waste of her talent.

However, the problem of learning how to read was really a big problem. No matter how many times he had asked her, she had not listened.

What could he do?

“Teacher, are you serious? If I really can read all of the words, will you teach me these powerful techniques?”

!!

She asked Ye Xuan with anticipation, and then looked at the ancient book in her second sister’s hand with envy.

“That’s for sure. The day you can recognize all of the words, I’ll immediately teach you an amazing technique. How about it?” Ye Xuan said confidently.

He was even thinking about whether he should prepare a few gifts for Elder Huang so that he could teach her how to read.

As long as this little girl was willing to seriously learn how to read, Ye Xuan would be willing to do almost anything.

“Alright then, I’ll do it. Once I’m done learning, You have to keep your promise, Teacher.”

Xiang Yun walked over and kept shaking Ye Xuan’s arm, wanting to get his confirmation.

He rubbed her head in glee. It seemed that there was hope.

“Alright, alright. I’ll definitely keep my promise, alright? When you’re done, I can teach you anything that you want to learn, as long as I know the technique.”

“Alright, Teacher. I definitely won’t let you down,” Xiang Yun patted her chest and said.

She could already envision herself splitting the earth apart with a casual hammer strike using a divine power.

At that point, no enemy would be able to withstand a single strike of her hammer!

She would beat them until they cried for their mothers!

Hahaha!

Thinking this, she suddenly laughed proudly, and her heart was full of joy.

Looking at her smiling face, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but feel a little worried for those who offended her junior sister.

In any case, the fact that she was going to learn to read seriously was a good thing.

Ye Xuan then said, “You two wait for a moment here. I’ll send Xiang Yun to the study hall first.”

“Understood, Teacher.”

The two of them watched Ye Xuan bring Xiang Yun away.

Zhuge Yueyue then asked Feng Xiyun hesitantly, “Xiyun, do you think that our third sister will be able to learn how to read properly this time?”

“I’m not sure.”

Feng Xiyun recalled the time when she had tried to teach Xiang Yun how to read. This little girl was not someone an ordinary person could teach.

She seemed to be full of curiosity about everything, except reading.

It would be an uphill task.

Zhuge Yueyue was helpless too, and she could only hope that Xiang Yun would really apply herself seriously this time, or at the very least, stay out of trouble.

If she still did not succeed this time, then it was probably a hopeless endeavor.

Soon, Ye Xuan arrived at the study hall with Xiang Yun in tow.

“Elder Huang, don’t worry. This time, she won’t cause you any more trouble. She’ll definitely learn to read. Even if you don’t believe her, you can believe me, okay?”

Outside the door of the church, Ye Xuan patted his chest and gave his word of honor. In order to give this girl a chance to learn how to read, Ye Xuan was willing to trade away his pride.

However, after experiencing this incident, Elder Huang was extremely afraid. No matter what he was told, he was unwilling to teach Xiang Yun again.

“Junior Brother Ye, please do me a favor and let me off.”

“If I let this girl mess around a few more times, my bones will be broken by her. I’ve taught students for so long, but this is the first time I’ve met someone as fierce as your disciple. I really can’t take it,” Elder Huang said with a lingering sense of fear.

He was adamant about his decision. His life was more important.

Seeing that Elder Huang was still against it, Ye Xuan did not panic. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The corners of his mouth curved up slightly and he said with a smile, “Elder Huang, are you sure you won’t allow it?”

“I’m sure,” Elder Huang replied firmly.

At that moment, Ye Xuan took out an extremely precious treasure from his storage space…

When he saw this treasure, Elder Huang’s jaw dropped.

The f*ck?!

It was a ruler that was emitting a brilliant light. Just by looking at the aura, one could tell that this treasure was of the highest quality!

Although Elder Huang was an elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was not strong. He only had a certain status because he taught the children.

This was the first time Elder Huang had seen a precious treasure like this up close. To him, this treasure was fatally attractive.

Ye Xuan gently swung the ruler a few times, and then threw it directly in front of Elder Huang.

“Oh dear, Elder Huang, why did you accidentally drop your treasure on the ground?”

Elder Huang immediately came back to his senses.

Oh my god…

He actually did this…

Elder Huang rolled his eyes, but after seeing that there was no one else around, he smiled brightly.

“Ahem, it’s really mine. I’ll pick it up immediately.”

After picking up the ruler with lightning speed, Elder Huang looked at Xiang Yun, who was standing behind Ye Xuan.

...

“Ahem, Junior Brother Ye, I’ve thought about it seriously just now. Although your little girl is quite naughty, she can still be taught.”

“Seeing that she is Junior Brother Ye’s disciple, I will allow her to return to the study hall to learn again. However, whether she can learn well or not will depend on her own efforts.”

Elder Huang said this with some hesitation, but the bright smile on his face had already betrayed him.
