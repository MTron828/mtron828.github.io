881 Difficult Situation

“Not only will I want to bring him back from the dead, I will also give him an opportunity.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, everyone became extremely excited. No one doubted his words. After all, they had seen him perform so many miracles.

As long as Ye Xuan said it was possible, it would definitely happen!

Hua Rufeng started to kowtow on the ground with tears of gratitude. He did not know what words to use to express the feelings in his heart.

After that, Ye Xuan went over to Ao Lei’s side, and he took out an immortal-grade recovery pill.

‘Oh my god! It’s actually another immortal-grade recovery pill!’

‘Where does Ye Xuan get so many of them? This was the same pill that saved me!’

Gao Shun was very surprised at this moment. Not only had Ye Xuan used this pill to save him, but also used several of them in the fight against Mengyu.

Just how many of these pills did he have?

What Gao Shun did not know was that Ye Xuan had hundreds of such medicinal pills. If he knew, his teeth would probably fall out on the spot.

Ye Xuan then circulated his cultivation technique to reactivate Ao Lei’s meridians to refine the medicinal pill’s effects.

Then, he said, “The crack in his sea of consciousness has been festering for many years. It won’t be so easy to completely repair it.”

“Over the next two months, you all must protect Cloud Sky Cave well and stabilize the sect.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Without Senior Brother Ao around, many unexpected situations may occur. Someone must take up the mantle of leadership and control the situation.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Gao Shun and Yuelun agreed without hesitation. Gao Shun said, “Junior Brother Ye, you don’t have to worry. I am still here and won’t allow anyone to take advantage of this situation to harm the sect.”

Yuelun chimed in, “Then I’ll be in charge of protecting Cloud Sky Cave. Senior Brother Gao Shun, you’ll be in charge of the sect’s safety. Be wary of those with ill intentions. Many people will seek to take advantage of this situation to cause trouble and weaken our sect’s strength.”

The people Yuelun mentioned did exist. Although the Great Wilderness Divine sect appeared to be harmonious on the surface, there were those that hid their malicious desires, suppressed by Ao Lei.

If they learned of his death, then they would definitely take action.

No matter how one put it, there were many species in a forest, and it was impossible to keep everyone in line.

“Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on things. In any case, if they cause trouble, they will suffer the consequences.”

After saying this coldly, Gao Shun left Cloud Sky Cave without any hesitation to take charge of the overall situation.

Ye Xuan watched Gao Shun leave, and then turned to his two disciples and Hua Rufeng and instructed, “You should head out and assist as well.”

“Got it,” the three of them said in unison, and then left Cloud Sky Cave. The others also left after that.

At this moment, only Ye Xuan, Ao Lei, Yuelun, and Xiang Yun were in Cloud Sky Cave.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, we’ll have to rely on you now.”

After saying that, he turned his attention back to Ao Lei. The immortal-grade recovery pill had begun to take effect, and his life force was condensing and gathering again.

The pill alone would be enough to revive Ao Lei, but Ye Xuan did not want to stop there. He had to repair the crack in Ao Lei’s sea of consciousness. Otherwise, the current situation would persist and all the pill would do was prolong Ao Lei’s life.

After all of these years of service that Ao Lei had led the sect, Ye Xuan felt that he deserved at least this much. Currently he had changed his mind. He initially intended to provide the sect’s cultivators with another opportunity, but he felt that he would channel all of the power into Ao Lei instead.

That would allow Ao Lei to lead the sect better. After all, there were plenty of bad eggs in the sect, but Ao Lei’s loyalty and commitment to the sect was unquestionable.

Moments later, Ye Xuan helped Ao Lei up and placed his palm on his back. Once he did so, the sky was filled with clouds, and strong winds began to blow.

In the square, people raised their heads in unison to look at this scene.

“Sword Elder Ye must have acted. Sword Immortal Ye is going to show his might and save Martial Uncle Ao!”

The atmosphere was originally very heavy, but at this moment, everyone’s hearts were filled with hope. Ye Xuan would definitely be able to perform a miracle.

However, at this moment, the news about Ao Lei’s death had already begun to spread throughout the East continent.

After learning of this news, some people were ecstatic, but others were filled with worry. It caused a huge commotion.

“Ao Lei actually died?” Chu Tianba muttered to himself, his eyes filled with disbelief.

The current situation was extremely special because the eight continents had been reunified, and the Heavenly Stairway was about to open up. At this moment, the grand elder of the East continent’s strongest sect had actually passed away?

The news also spread to the other continents, and many forces were elated.

“Hehehe, one of the leaders of the number one force in the East continent actually died so easily?”

“It seems that we won’t have to worry about them in the future.”

“Since he’s just passed away, and many people are grieving, perhaps this is the best time for us to make a move.”
