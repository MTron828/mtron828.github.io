956 Torture

Huangfu Qi panicked when he realized that he could not commit suicide and was about to face Ye Xuan’s torture. He knew that he was in trouble, as Ye Xuan would probably go to any lengths to get the information out of him.

However, things had already developed to this point, so he gritted his teeth and shouted, “Ye Xuan! Bring it on! If I beg for mercy today, my descendants will be surnamed Ye in the future!”

“Let me tell you the truth. Even if you kill me, it won’t change the fact that your Great Wilderness Divine sect will be destroyed.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s killing intent intensified.

He had already noticed that the cave in front of him was protected by a powerful seal. Even if he had the ability to unlock the seal, there would likely still be more measures waiting for him inside, which would make it very difficult to find everyone.

After thinking for a while, Ye Xuan became much calmer. He looked at Huangfu Qi, who seemed to have gone crazy, and the corners of his mouth curled up into an evil smile.

“Alright, it seems you’ve prepared yourself. Then let’s see what you’re capable of.”

Ye Xuan suddenly reached out his right hand and placed it on Huangfu Qi’s forehead.

In the blink of an eye, Huangfu Qi felt a tremendous amount of pain, and he almost fainted. However, Ye Xuan then transmitted a stream of life force into his body at the last second, keeping him alive.

Huangfu Qi was stunned. He had expected Ye Xuan to conduct physical torture, but had been subjected to a soul attack instead!

At this moment, a cold smile was still plastered on Ye Xuan’s face.

“You’ll soon understand what I’m planning to do. Don’t worry, I will definitely make you wish you were dead. However, that wish will never be satisfied.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan slowly extended his left hand and condensed a ball of burning flames.

Huangfu Qi’s expression changed drastically when he saw the flames.

“Heaven Burning Flames! No!”

At this moment, he started to panic, and tried to struggle free. However, the gap in their cultivation levels was too great.

Instead, his soul was pulled out and thrown into the Heaven Burning Flames to be burned. Furthermore, Ye Xuan used a technique to prevent his soul from being burnt to ashes, so he had to suffer the pain of being constantly burnt.

At this moment, Huangfu Qi finally experienced what it meant to be unable to live or die. The pain from his arm that had been torn off seemed almost non-existent compared to the pain his soul was feeling.

“Stop! Please kill me…”

Huangfu Qi’s soul was screaming hysterically within the Heaven Burning Flames. His miserable screams would send chills down anyone’s spine.

Only a few minutes had passed, but Huangfu Qi felt that he had endured a thousand years of torture.

Seeing that this method had achieved good results, Ye Xuan said disdainfully, “I’ll give you another chance. Are you going to confess or not?”

“No!”

Despite the intense torture, Huangfu Qi’s spirit remained unbroken. He did not want to reveal any useful information.

Ye Xuan’s competitive spirit was ignited at this moment. Ye Xuan believed that he had the ability to subdue Huangfu Qi.

“Hehe, is that so? In that case, let’s see how long you can last!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan released even more intense Heaven Burning Flames, and even infused the power of lightning and ice into the mix.

The three powers were constantly changing, taking turns to torture Huangfu Qi. Screams of pain and agony rang out unendingly. Huangfu Qi’s willpower was actually quite strong, and it was only after quite a long time that he admitted defeat.

“Don’t continue. I’ll confess everything, okay?”

“I’m begging you, stop torturing me…”

At this moment, there was only fear in his eyes when he looked at Ye Xuan.

It was the first time he had encountered such inhumane torture.

At this moment, his physical body and even his soul were trembling. In the end, he could not withstand Ye Xuan’s torture.

After seeing this situation, Ye Xuan revealed a triumphant smile and retracted the Heaven Burning Flames.

“Hurry up and confess. Where are they?”

Huangfu Qi said shakily, “All the people of your Great Wilderness Divine sect are trapped in this cave.”

“However, there are also thousands of branches within the cave. Every branch has been sealed and has to be removed one by one.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“If you attack this cave, the seals inside will also be activated. Even a sealed immortal realm expert would not be able to escape once trapped inside.”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan was also very surprised. He had not expected Gongsun Ming to come up with such thorough arrangements.

“Haha, from the looks of it, this old man really spent a lot of effort to deal with me.”

“Hurry up and tell me how to remove the seals inside.”

After hearing this, Huangfu Qi’s eyes instantly filled with coldness. He still wanted to make Ye Xuan suffer.

However, Ye Xuan happened to notice his expression and said with a cold smile, “From the looks of it, the lesson I gave you just now was not enough. In that case, I will continue to torture you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan once again ignited the Heaven Burning Flames, which frightened Huangfu Qi. He did not want to continue being tortured by Ye Xuan, so he immediately begged for mercy.

“Don’t! Please stop. I’ll tell you everything…”
