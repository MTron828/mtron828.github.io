520 A Great Harvest, Water Cloud Fruit Seedling

“Congratulations! The host has received an immortal-grade treasure, a water cloud fruit seedling.”

‘Heavens! It’s actually a water cloud fruit!’

Ye Xuan was stunned. His mouth was wide open, and his eyes were full of disbelief.

The effects of the water cloud fruit far surpass the chiliad gold vine.

!!

In terms of increasing one’s lifespan, it was 100 times more effective than the chiliad gold vine.

There were even legends that said that eating a water cloud fruit would allow one to become an immortal. Its effects were very powerful.

However, the only downside was that even though the water cloud fruit’s effects were extremely powerful, it would still take too long for it to grow and ripen.

Perhaps this was also the flaw of these rare treasures. Their effects would only manifest after they grew to an appropriate age.

“Forget it. No matter what, it’s still an immortal-grade treasure.”

In general, he could be considered to have made a huge profit.

Not only did he capture Yuelun’s heart, he even obtained a water cloud fruit seedling.

‘Hehe, I’ve really made a killing this time!’

Uh…

After being happy for a while, Ye Xuan finally remembered that he was going to take advantage of her just now.

However, due to the system’s notification, he was so happy that he forgot about it.

When he turned around to look at Yuelun, he discovered that she was under a tree and was taking care of the chiliad gold vine’s sapling.

At this moment, Ye Xuan fiercely slapped his thigh a few times.

He had already gotten so far, but the system notification had delayed his progress.

If he still wanted to continue, Yuelun would probably think that he was messing with her again, so he could only give up.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, let’s continue our journey.”

She replied in a calm tone, “Alright.”

At this moment, Ye Xuan chose to remain patient. There would still be plenty of opportunities in the future, so there was no need to rush things.

The most important thing at the moment was to find the heaven devouring divine sparrow and the huge black tortoise as soon as possible, which had been his original objective in entering the ancient tomb.

Now that he had reached the supreme realm, he could continue his pursuit. However, almost every corner of this ancient tomb was filled with danger. If he were to leave Yuelun here alone, it would be far too dangerous.

After leaving the cave with Yuelun, Ye Xuan suddenly remembered something and asked, “Senior Sister, didn’t you say that you met Elder Taiyin when you first entered the ancient tomb? Did he deliberately make things difficult for you?”

Yuelun was momentarily stunned before she replied, “Indeed he did. However, just as he was about to make a move, he was stopped by Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba. I ignored him then in order to search for you. I wonder how the battle is going now.”

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan’s eyes turned cold, and then he looked at Yuelun with a smile.

“Senior Sister, come with me. I’ll help you get back at him.”

The moment he said that, Yuelun’s face revealed a bright smile.

“Alright.”

Ever since her master had passed away, she had never experienced such a feeling. It felt great to be protected by someone.

“Let’s go.”

They then made their way over to where Yuelun remembered the battle to be. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Elder Taiying was still fighting for divine fruit, completely unaware of the impending disaster headed his way.

Thanks to the power of the Immortal Sword, Elder Taiyin had been able to hold out this whole while against Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba.

“Damn it! If this situation persists, I’ll definitely suffer.”

As the battle continued, Elder Taiyin was already thinking about retreating.

However, he still glared at Elder Tongtian and said, “Elder Tongtian, I don’t think there are any grudges between us. Do you really want to go against me?”

“Have you never thought about what will happen in the future? Nothing good will come out of provoking me!”

Hearing Elder Taiyin’s words, Elder Tongtian was not intimidated at all. He sneered, “Old Man Taiyin, perhaps other people might be afraid of the power behind you, but my sect is not one of those!”

“I advise you to speak less and save your strength to fight me!”

Elder Taiyin’s face had turned completely dark. He said in anger, “You two are shameless. You can’t even beat me two-on-one. If you all are not cowards, then come and fight me one-on-one!”

Elder Tongtian waved his hand and said, “Is that supposed to be a joke? Almost everyone knows that you, Old Man Taiyin, are the most shameless one, okay?”

“Damn it!”

Elder Taiyin was flustered and exasperated. Who said that he was the most shameless one? Who was the one who slandered him like that?

The anger in his heart grew more and more intense, but he had no solution to this situation. He could only defend passively and wait for the opportunity to come.

However, Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba would not give him any chance at all. After all, they were both at the peak-level mystic lord realm experts as well. There was no way they would make rookie-level mistakes.

“Hehe!”

While the three of them were engaged in an intense battle, a loud and clear voice came from afar.

A moment later, an old man in a black robe appeared not far away.

There were actually quite a few mystic lord realm experts following this old man. These people all came from various forces.

The entrance of the ancient tomb was already wide open, so how could these people not come to join in the fun?

At the same time, Elder Taiyin laughed out loud excitedly after hearing the voice.

“Hehe, Elder Taiyin, I haven’t seen you for a long time. It seems that you have become much stronger!”

...

After saying that, he flew over to Elder Taiyin’s side.

When Elder Taiyin saw reinforcements arrive, he revealed a bright smile.

He had just been struggling with how to deal with Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba, but now there was finally a turning point to settle this matter…
