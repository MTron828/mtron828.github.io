Chapter 240: Killing Guang Liang

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jun Lingtian still could not confirm this. After all, he only knew all this from those ancient records from the Divine Gate Holy Land.

…

Buzzzzzz!

While Jun Lingtian was lost in thought, a dazzling sword qi suddenly tore through the sky, slashing toward Zhu Tuyuan.

Seeing this, Zhu Tuyuan hurriedly turned to look at Qian Daoliu and Guang Liang.

They immediately nodded and quickly surrounded Ye Xuan.

Boom!

The three pattern condensation experts erupted with terrifying power that instantly created numerous spatial cracks.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan moved and appeared in front of a huge spatial crack.

If cultivators weaker than the fourth level of the unity realm entered this chaotic space, they would instantly be torn to pieces.

However, the spatial turbulence surrounding a spatial crack of this size formed a space of its own, which made it quite a suitable place to fight.

After all, if they were to fight out in the open, the Great Qian dynasty would suffer grievous losses.

“It’s unbecoming for three pattern condensation realm experts to gang up on a unity realm expert, right?”

Just as Qian Daoliu was about to make his move, Jun Lingtian spoke up.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

He had not expected someone to help him out.

Jun Lingtian!

When Ye Xuan was in the Tower of Heaven, he had already heard of the other party’s name. He was the master of the Divine Gate, and the strongest expert in the Nanzhou Region.

However, there was another person who came with Jun Lingtian. Seeing that he was carrying an ancient sword on his back, could he be the master of the Myriad Swords Hall?

Why were they helping him? What were their intentions?

In fact, even if Jun Lingtian and Zhao Yuzhen had not stepped out, he was not afraid of Zhu Tuyuan and Guang Liang.

However, he sensed danger from Qian Daoliu.

“Jun Lingtian, are you really going to interfere?”

Qian Daoliu spoke.

“There’s no need for that. I’ll personally settle this matter!”0

Before Jun Lingtian could reply, Ye Xuan’s voice suddenly rang out.

Moments later, a brilliant sword qi flashed toward Guang Liang.

Eighth-level sword intent! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Fire intent!

Ye Xuan had fused sword intent and fire intent into his sword qi!

Boom!

Seeing this, Guang Liang’s expression changed drastically. Buddhist light surrounded his body as he frantically raised the staff in his hand to try and resist Ye Xuan’s attack.

However, moments later, the staff that had accompanied him for hundreds of years suddenly snapped, and the sword qi engulfed his body.

“Ye Xuan!”

After his physical body was destroyed, Guang Liang’s soul appeared and stared at Ye Xuan in fury.

However, before he could say another word, Ye Xuan’s heavenly lightning intent burst forth and devoured his soul.

Guang Liang had fallen!

Of course, the reason why Ye Xuan had the chance to kill Guang Liang was because Jun Lingtian had stopped Qian Daoliu, and Zhao Yuzhen had delayed Zhu Tuyuan.

“Zhao Yuzhen!”

“What is it? I just wanted to chat with you, right?”

Zhao Yuzhen looked at Zhu Tuyuan with a faint smile on his face. All he had done was appear in front of Zhu Tuyuan out of the blue.

He had not actually attacked. However, this was enough to delay him long enough for Ye Xuan to kill Guang Liang.

How had a unity realm expert killed a pattern condensation realm expert so effortlessly?

Guang Liang was indeed the weakest among them, but he should at least have been able to hold on for some time. It was the fusion of martial intents that had done him in.

“Detestable!”

Zhu Tuyuan’s arms trembled slightly as a deep sense of fear flashed across the depths of his eyes.

“Zhao Yuzhen, if you try to stop us, the Nether God sect and the Myriad Swords Hall will be mortal enemies!”

Zhao Yuzhen hesitated for a moment, but finally stepped aside.

Ye Xuan’s slaying of Guang Liang meant that his assistance was not really needed. He could have also killed Guang Liang, but it would have taken him a few more moves.

This fact frustrated Zhao Yuzhen.
