783 Danger Approaches

After Gao Shun heard this, he smiled and channeled his spiritual power to open a hole in the defensive formation.

“Hurry up and come in!”

Seeing this, Xie Tianyu became excited. He immediately supported his teacher’s body and pulled the latter forward.

“Teacher, we are saved!”

Daoist Black Iron also felt quite touched at this time. He really did not expect Gao Shun to actually put aside past grudges and let them in. A sense of admiration filled his heart.

!!

Perhaps the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s status as the number one sect in the East continent was deserved. Such broad-mindedness was beyond what most other sects’ leaders were capable of.

Once they were in, Gao Shun hurriedly closed the gap in the world before the berserk beasts and black fog could enter.

Boom!

A huge berserk beast crashed into the defensive formation.

“Teacher, why did you come back?” Zhuge Yueyue asked.

Xiang Yun was also happily tugging at Ye Xuan’s sleeve to get his attention.

Ye Xuan smiled and said, “I was just worried about you guys, so I returned here.”

Ye Xuan rubbed Xiang Yun’s little head and then gently checked on her physical condition, frowning after he did so. He could sense that the hidden seal in her body was showing signs of breaking.

Then, he realized it was probably due to the fact that he had looked like he was in danger during the fight with the strange monster earlier.

He quickly mobilized his spiritual power to strengthen the hidden seal.

“Third Sister, that’s enough. Teacher still has other things to do.”

Seeing Xiang Yun still hanging on Ye Xuan’s body, Feng Xiyun also walked over helplessly, trying to persuade Xiang Yun to let go. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, the latter was unwilling to let go no matter what. Thus, Feng Xiyun had no choice but to use her ultimate skill. It took two roasted potatoes to convince her to let go.

“Junior Brother Ye, why did you come back here again?” Gao Shun asked curiously.

At this moment, everyone was looking at him curiously.

Ye Xuan’s brows were slightly furrowed. He looked into the distance and saw the thick black fog rolling over.

“I can sense an extremely terrifying aura approaching Sky Mountain…”

“This…”

As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd was thrown into an uproar. Ye Xuan was a peak-level ancient realm expert. If even he said that whatever was coming was terrifying, then it had to at least be another ancient realm expert.

Looking at their worried expressions, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “Actually, it’s not a big deal. I’ll just stay here and wait for them to arrive.”

Hearing this, everyone instantly calmed down.

“Haha, we have Chief Ye Xuan here to protect us, so what’s there to be afraid of?”

“No matter who comes, Chief Ye Xuan will slay him with a domineering sword strike!”

The crowd started discussing excitedly. The panic they had felt earlier had subsided.

At this moment, Daoist Black Iron and Xie Tianyu had finally made it to the peak of Sky Mountain.

Seeing Ye Xuan in front of them, the two of them were filled with gratitude as they spoke respectfully, “Supreme Divine sect, Daoist Black Iron…”

“Supreme Divine sect, Xie Tianyu…”

“Greet and thank Chief Ye Xuan.”

“Alright, there’s no need for such pleasantries.”

Ye Xuan waved his hand at them indifferently.

In fact, Ye Xuan did not care whether these two were dead or alive. He was only moved to act by Daoist Black Iron’s willingness to sacrifice his life for his disciple.

“Thank you, Chief Ye Xuan…”

Seeing that Ye Xuan did not pursue their past grudges, the taut heartstrings in their hearts relaxed, and their admiration for him grew.

Looking at Zhuge Yueyue, who was standing beside Ye Xuan, Xie Tianyu’s heart was filled with even more complicated emotions.

As a peerless genius, Xie Tianyu had never been defeated by anyone before Zhuge Yueyue appeared. However, he had been defeated by her twice, and his pride had been torn apart.

“Miss Zhuge, we haven’t seen each other for a long time,” Xie Tianyu said awkwardly.

Zhuge Yueyue merely nodded and said nothing.

Xie Tianyu knew his own position and did not say anything else. However, he was stunned when he noticed Zhuge Yueyue’s aura.

‘Heavens…’

‘She has reached the middle stage of the heaven realm?’

Damn it! Even Mu Beichen probably had not reached the heaven realm.

In this case, would Zhuge Yueyue be the number one expert of her generation?

At this moment, Xie Tianyu’s heart was in turmoil.

How did she achieve it?
