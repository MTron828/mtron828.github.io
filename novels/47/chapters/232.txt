Chapter 233: The Coming Storm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Xuan immediately started refining the withered leaf bodhi, and also used the epiphany opportunity to comprehend the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique.

If time allowed for it, Ye Xuan also planned to use the opportunity to comprehend other martial intents.

Just like that, a day passed, and Ye Xuan and the others returned to the Qingyun sect.

At this moment, the Qingyun sect seemed no different from before.

However, after Ye Xuan meeting with Wan Shanhai, he realized that the Nether God sect, Blood Moon Temple, and the Yunjin Temple, had all sent experts here.

Any one of those experts could easily destroy the Qingyun sect.

However, he had left an offensive jade token that contained the power of a pattern condensation realm expert.

After Wan Shanhai had crushed the jade token, what appeared was not just an attack, but the illusory phantom of a human figure.

If Ye Xuan had been present, he would have recognized this human figure to be the master of the Moon Demon mystic realm.

The illusory phantom of the master of the Moon Demon mystic realm had killed all of the attacking experts from the three major forces.

“I’ll be going into seclusion for a few days. Not too long from now, even more terrifying enemies will appear.”

“During this period, no Qingyun sect disciples should be allowed to go out.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s figure disappeared.

The state of epiphany activated by the withered leaf bodhi was still ongoing. Thus, he had to seize every moment to make the most of this opportunity.

Not long after Ye Xuan returned to the Qingyun sect, a huge spatial crack suddenly appeared at the distant border of the Great Qian Dynasty, from which two figures stepped out.

They were the master of the Divine Gate, Jun Lingtian, and the master of the Myriad Swords Hall, Zhao Yuzhen.

“This must be the Great Qian Empire, right?” Jun Lingtian checked out their surroundings.

“Okay! It’s time to find out where the Qingyun sect is.”

Zhao Yuzhen nodded, and then suddenly disappeared. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Seeing this, Jun Lingtian’s figure also disappeared.

The two soon arrived in one of the Great Qian Dynasty’s cities. They concealed their auras so that they looked like ordinary cultivators.

No one was aware that two terrifying pattern condensation realm experts were among them in the Great Qian Dynasty.

Jun Lingtian was extremely confident in his abilities. He had definitely reached the Great Qian Dynasty before the two old monsters from the Nether God sect and the Blood Moon Temple.

“This empire is really weak, yet somehow, a backward place like this produced a monstrous genius like Ye Xuan.”

“Do you think that Ye Xuan is really the reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert?”

“It’s hard to say. This is all just conjecture at this point.”

“Then, according to what you said, this fellow could also be a monstrous genius born and raised in the Great Qian Dynasty?”

“Of course! But the possibility of this being true is very low.”

“You and I have known each other for 500 years, but I have never found out your true identity. Where do you find all of this information?”

“Me? What’s there to be curious about my identity? I’m the master of the Divine Gate!”

“Oh? It is said that in the distant Yunqing Region, there is also a Divine Gate.”

“Eh?!”

It did not take long for the two of them to determine the location of the Qingyun sect.

However, they were not in a hurry. Instead, it was as if they were on a scenic tour. They each held a pot of wine and slowly chatted as they headed in the direction of the Qingyun sect.

…

Nanzhou Region, Nether God sect.

A terrifying aura suddenly swept out from the bronze temple, but disappeared moments later.

The sect master of the Nether God sect had finally concluded his secluded cultivation session.

At the same time, in the Blood Moon Temple far away, another terrifying aura also erupted.

In addition, within the territory of Yunjin Temple, a kind-looking old monk slowly stood up with a Buddhist staff in his hand.

Hu!

A cloud of strange black mist suddenly appeared in the bronze temple of the Nether God sect, which slowly condensed into the figure of a middle-aged man wearing a black robe.

“Sect Master!”

The cultivators who had been guarding the bronze temple saw this and immediately greeted him.

The sect master had finally left seclusion!

This middle-aged man was the master of the Nether God sect, Zhu Tuyuan.

He had been in secluded cultivation in the bronze temple for 20 years.

Zhu Tuyuan ignored the cultivators. Instead, he went over to the building that housed the soul jade tokens.

In the center of the room, there was a soul jade token that was shrouded in black light. It was his own soul jade token.

When he saw the shattered soul jade tokens of the inner sect elders, as well as the law enforcement elder’s, ripples appeared in the depths of his eyes.

“Sect master!”

“Sect master!”

At this moment, seven or eight inner sect elders suddenly appeared outside the building.

“Where is Ye Xuan now?”

Zhu Tuyuan asked calmly. However, his expression was furious.

When the inner sect elders saw this, their expressions changed.

“Ye Xuan has returned to the Qingyun sect,” Elder Chen said respectfully.

“Tell me everything about Ye Xuan. I want the most detailed information,” Zhu Tuyuan said.

The elders looked at each other. Finally, Elder Chen stood up.

Elder Chen told the sect master everything that he knew about Ye Xuan.

From Elder Chen’s detailed explanation, he finally understood how terrifying Ye Xuan was.

However, from Zhu Tuyuan’s perspective, the most terrifying thing about Ye Xuan was not his strength, but the cultivation talent he displayed.

After all, no matter how strong Ye Xuan was, he was still a unity realm cultivator.

To other cultivators, unity realm cultivators might be incomparably powerful experts.

However, in the eyes of a pattern condensation realm expert, a unity realm cultivator was merely a stronger ant.

Furthermore, just like Jun Lingtian, Zhu Tuyuan also felt that Ye Xuan’s existence did not make sense.

Even the most talented cultivators would not be able to reach such a terrifying cultivation level by the age of twenty.

20 years was the amount of time he had spent in secluded cultivation this time. Moreover, there were even quite a number of pattern condensation realm experts who would go into secluded cultivation for a hundred years each time.
