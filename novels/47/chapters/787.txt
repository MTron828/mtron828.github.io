788 One Against Seven (Part 2)

Despite seeing that they were all attacking him, Ye Xuan’s expression remained calm and collected.

“You b*stard, I’ll take your life!”

North Heavenly King immediately unleashed two criss-crossing saber beams, but Ye Xuan simply stretched out his hands and pinched the attacks, stopping them.

“This…”

North Heavenly King was dumbfounded.This guy did not even use his weapon to block the attack!

“Damn it! Damn it!”

Ye Xuan then unleashed his Boundless Palm technique toward North Heavenly King, severely injuring the latter, who spat out a few mouthfuls of black blood.

“It’s actually an immortal-grade divine power!”

Seeing this, the other six monsters panicked. They knew that they too would suffer serious injuries if they were hit by that palm strike.

“B*stard! Suppress him immediately!”

One of the strange monsters shouted furiously, but it did not rashly approach. Instead, it took out an artifact, which instantly activated a huge formation.

After the light dissipated, the onlookers were dumbfounded because Ye Xuan had already disappeared.

Uh…

Then, they realized that Ye Xuan had reappeared ten kilometers away, easily avoiding the scope of the formation.

Whoa!

So fast!

Ye Xuan stopped and looked at Heavenly King Li mockingly.

“What a joke! Is that all?”

“Die, f*cker, die!”

Heavenly King Li enunciated each word in anger. From the way the battle was proceeding, they were the ones being made fools of.

This was unbearable!

“Set up the formation…”

Dense black fog rushed over, instantly covering the entire sky as the seven monsters were gathered together. Only the North Heavenly King, who had just been severely injured, was slightly weaker. The other monsters released their full power.

At this moment, the strange power they released had reached an extremely terrifying level. Even Mengyu, who had been paying attention to the situation here, felt pangs of trepidation.

This huge formation was formed by seven ancient realm experts. Even a sealed immortal realm expert felt slightly threatened by this.

“You b*stard! Let’s see how you escape now!”

At the moment the formation condensed, this place seemed to have become a cage. Ye Xuan could have easily escaped, but he did not do so.

After carefully sizing up the formation, he realized that a huge black ball had condensed at the top of the formation.

Waves of shocking power emanated from it, and even space seemed to have been sealed. No matter what kind of move it was, it seemed that it could not be used.

Ye Xuan did not speak at this moment, but the people who saw this situation were starting to become anxious. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After observing for a while, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said with a smile, “It’s just a weak formation. It seems pretty easy to break it too.”

Moments later, he raised his right hand, the Godsword flew into his hand.

Boom!

The moment he closed his fist over the hilt, a huge rumble was heard from the sky, followed by roaring thunder.

“Could this be the Endless Lightning technique?”

Some people asked in confusion.

“Something seems different. Also, it seems more powerful. Is it an immortal-grade divine power as well?”

Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock. Why did Ye Xuan possess so many immortal-grade divine powers?

As lightning struck, light flashed in the sky, and then a huge door appeared in the sky.

Eh?

Was this not Ye Xuan’s famous ultimate move?

There were only two people in the East continent who could use this move. One of them was Ye Xuan, and the other was his eldest disciple, Zhuge Yueyue.

“It’s not the same. This door seems to have changed and become stronger than before,” Zhuge Yueyue looked up and said with certainty.

She knew more about this move than these people. The divine power that her teacher was activating now was definitely not the same one as before.

The lightning was a new addition to this move, which meant that Ye Xuan must have improved this divine power further.

The indescribable pressure made many people present kneel down in an instant.

“Heavenly Punishment!”

Gao Shun looked at this scene in a daze and said these two words to himself.
