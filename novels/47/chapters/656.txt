657 Opening

“Many thanks, Grandpa Xu Yun,” Xiang Yun shouted happily, which made Daoist Xu Yun happy.

This little girl was really too likable.

If he had such an obedient granddaughter, no matter what she wanted, he would get it for her even if he had to risk his old bones.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun felt a little envious seeing her get two treasures just like that. However, that was the charm of children. Everyone wanted to protect and take care of Xiang Yun.

Daoist Canghai laughed, then turned his gaze to Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun. He had suddenly thought of something and asked, “Little Brother Ye, I’ve heard that your eldest disciple’s talent in the Sword Dao is also very strong, and that she even has your style. Which one of the three is she?”

This was someone even Mu Beichen did not have the confidence to defeat, so he had to take advantage of this opportunity to get to know her. Otherwise, it would be difficult to examine her strength later on.

Ye Xuan gestured toward Zhuge Yueyue, who stepped forward and said, “Junior Zhuge Yueyue pays her respects to Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun.”

The two of them sized up Zhuge Yueyue seriously and could clearly sense the powerful sword aura that surrounded her.

It was obvious that Zhuge Yueyue was very talented in the Sword Dao.

Daoist Canghai chuckled, then continued, “Very good, very good. You have the aura of a chivalrous heroine, and I don’t doubt that you have the potential to follow in your teacher’s footsteps.”

“Little Brother Ye Xuan, all of the disciples you’ve taken in are amazing.”

Daoist Canghai laughed heartily.

“It looks like your eldest disciple has a great chance of emerging victorious during this gathering,” Daoist Xu Yun chimed in.

Listening to the two’s flattery, Ye Xuan smiled and said, “That isn’t for sure. Anything can happen.”

“I’ve brought my disciples here this time purely to broaden their horizons and to train them.”

“If they want to win, they’ll have to put in the effort.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, both Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun were stunned.

Broadening their horizons?

That was clearly a title contender right there!

Just as the few of them were happily conversing, the entire mountain peak began to tremble.

Ye Xuan raised his head to look at the top of the mountain and said, “The peak has opened.”

Turning to his disciples, Ye Xuan said, “The gathering is held in an ancient realm. You will enter it with your souls and compete with other opponents to obtain ranks.”

“At the peak of this mountain, there is a huge stone tablet, which will display your ranking in real time.”

“If you can defeat the enemy with a higher ranking, then you will take that person’s rank.”

“As such, you shouldn’t bother paying attention to those ranked lower than you are. Just pick fights with the geniuses.”

“However, when you first enter, don’t do anything. Wait for the rankings to be updated, then find those who are ranked higher and challenge them. That way, it’ll be easier for you to reach the top, understand?”

Ye Xuan’s words were meant for Zhuge Yueyue. As for Feng Xiyun and Xiang Yun, this was more of a learning experience, as their cultivation levels could not match the top geniuses present, which were mostly advanced and peak-level void realm cultivators.

Thus, Zhuge Yueyue was the only one truly in the running with a shot at emerging victorious.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhuge Yueyue nodded in agreement.

“Teacher, I understand. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely bring honor and victory back to Cloud Sky peak.”

She gripped the Cloud Sky Sword tightly, and her entire body exuded fighting spirit.

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s confident look, Ye Xuan was very pleased. He took out six high-level soul returning pills from his storage space and handed them to her.

“Yueyue, it’s up to you now. I can’t participate in the gathering, so you will be carrying my hopes with you.”

“Don’t feel too nervous. It’s fine as long as you do your best. Regardless of whether you win or not, I will be proud of you.”

Upon hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue felt her eyes water and her desire to win grew stronger.

Now that she had an opportunity to repay him, no matter what, she would not let him down. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing the effect his words had on her, Ye Xuan was pleased. If she emerged victorious, he would be able to show off a little.

At this moment, the system’s notification appeared.

“Ding! As you have given your disciple six soul-returning pills, you have received six dark origin pills as a critical reward.”

Looking at the six pills, Ye Xuan could not help but feel a little disappointed.

However, the rewards were like this. Sometimes, the critical multiplier was high, and sometimes it was low.

Still, any reward was better than nothing, and his system had much better odds than a lottery.
