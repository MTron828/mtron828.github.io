505 I’m Going To Find Ye Xuan

Ye Xuan immediately ate the divine fruit without hesitation, and a mysterious power coursed through his body, sublimating his soul in the depths of the divine spring in his body, and nourishing the Dao fruit.

‘It actually increased my comprehension ability by a hundred times in an instant…’

Ye Xuan sucked in a breath of cold air.

Under the effect of the chaos innate divine fruit, his comprehension ability was increasing rapidly, and he began to gain many insights into things he had difficulty comprehending in the past.

!!

He knew that this was the best time to break through, so he immediately closed his eyes and began to comprehend the power of the laws of the world, using it to temper his soul and body.

Time passed by, and soon, a month had passed.

However, this was only the time that had passed in the time formation. Only three days had passed in the outside world.

During this period, Ye Xuan continued to temper his physical body using the power of the laws, and eventually, gained the ability to transform.

In addition, Ye Xuan also used the power of the chaos innate divine fruit to comprehend more of the power of the laws.

While Ye Xuan was cultivating, many changes had taken place in the outside world.

The appearance of the ancient tomb had caused a stir in the entire archaic divine mountains. Not only that, but all the top holy lands and ancient families in the East continent had also moved out.

“Hahaha! I can’t believe we’re so lucky to encounter the appearance of a sealed immortal realm expert’s tomb in our lifetime!”

“If I can obtain an opportunity in the ancient tomb, I might be able to break through to the mystic lord realm!”

As the news spread, more and more cultivators gathered in the archaic divine mountains, including the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Yuelun brought the disciples of Water Sky peak and quietly entered the archaic divine mountains. When she saw the entrance of the ancient tomb, a hint of surprise flashed across the depths of her eyes.

“Teacher, should we enter this ancient tomb to see what’s inside?” Li Hanyi asked.

Yuelun shook her head gently.

“Now is not the best time. The energy surrounding the ancient tomb is too terrifying. We still need to wait for it to weaken a little before it’ll be possible for you all to enter.”

When the disciples heard this, they nodded excitedly. They looked at the sea of cultivators around them, their eyes full of shock.

They had never seen such a large number of cultivators gathered in one place before.

“Eh? Why don’t I see Ye Xuan?”

Yuelun looked around carefully, but was puzzled when she could not find traces of his presence. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing this, Li Hanyi quickly looked around. She did not find Ye Xuan, but she did see a few familiar figures.

“Eh? Aren’t those two the disciples of Cloud Sky peak? When did they leave the sect?”

When Yuelun saw this, she turned her attention to the two people in question, which were of course Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun. The two girls were looking at the entrance of the ancient tomb.

Just yesterday, Su Changhe had sent them news regarding the archaic divine mountains, and also told them that Ye Xuan had entered the ancient tomb.

After receiving the news, they quickly left the sect.

Zhuge Yueyue wanted to ask Su Changhe for more information about Ye Xuan, but at that moment, she suddenly sensed that someone was coming their way.

“Chief Yuelun?”

When Zhuge Yueyue saw who it was, she quickly bowed respectfully.

“En!”

Yuelun nodded, but looked around them questioningly.

“Why don’t I see your teacher around?”

Zhuge Yueyue shook her head helplessly. She did not know where her teacher was.

When Yuelune saw this, she felt somewhat disappointed.

Although she had not been present here, she had received news of Ye Xuan’s feats in the archaic divine mountains, and was hoping to meet up with him here after finding out that the ancient tomb had opened.

However, much to her chagrin, he was absent.

Yuelun pouted in dissatisfaction and was about to say something, but at this moment, Su Changhe smiled and pointed at the entrance of the ancient tomb.

“Chief Yuelun, you might not know this, but Chief Ye Xuan has already entered the ancient tomb.”

“What? That guy has already entered the tomb?”

When Yuelun heard this, her expression dimmed.

Immediately after, she turned around and said to Li Hanyi.

“You and the other disciples should stay here. Don’t run around. When the other chiefs of the sect arrive, follow their instructions.”

“What about you, Teacher?” Li Hanyi asked doubtfully.

“Your Martial Uncle Ye has already gone in, so I have to go in and find him.”

Yuelun took a look at the entrance of the ancient tomb.

As soon as she finished speaking, she turned into a streak of light and flew toward the entrance.

As a mystic lord realm expert, she could withstand the pressure emitted by the ancient tomb. The others watched as her figure disappeared into the ancient tomb.

When Su Changhe saw this, he rubbed his chin and thought seriously.

‘Could it be that Chief Yuelun likes Chief Ye Xuan? Otherwise, why would she be in such a hurry?’

‘Mmm… My deduction is definitely correct. Chief Yuelun is definitely interested in Chief Ye Xuan! Hehe! It seems that Chief Ye Xuan is skilled at picking up girls too!’

‘I have much to learn from him in the future.’

Su Changhe’s lips curled into a smile at the thought of this.

“This is the ancient tomb of a sealed immortal realm expert. Teacher won’t be in any danger, right?”

...

Feng Xiyun’s eyes were filled with worry as she muttered these words.

“Don’t worry, Teacher is so powerful, so he should be able to deal with any dangers inside,” Zhuge Yueyue comforted her.

She fully trusted her teacher.

Su Changhe also quickly chimed in, “Chief Ye Xuan is super powerful and smart. Even if he encounters danger, he’ll definitely be able to deal with it easily.”

“I think you guys should think about what to do later.”

“The opening of the ancient tomb has shaken the entire East continent. Countless top holy lands and ancient families have been mobilized.”

“This doesn’t just include the geniuses of this era. Even the ancient experts of the previous era have come to the archaic divine mountains.”
