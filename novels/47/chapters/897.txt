898 Teacher’s Wife

These seven sealed immortal realm experts all had the bodies of humans and the heads of tigers. They hovered in the sky and looked down upon the entire continent.

At this moment, waves of extremely terrifying pressure suddenly erupted from all seven of them!

Puchi!

Within moments, Zhuge Yueyue was suppressed to the point of spitting out blood, her face pale and powerless. These seven experts were too powerful, and there was a gap of two major realms between them, so she suffered heavy injuries in no time at all.

Furthermore, there were seven of them!

“First Sister!”

Feng Xiyun was very nervous and wanted to go over to help Zhuge Yueyue, but she was dissuaded by Zhuge Yueyue’s cold gaze, indicating that she must not come forward.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue had been firmly locked onto by the seven sealed immortal realm experts. Any creature that tried to get close to her would probably be targeted as well.

After stopping Feng Xiyun, Zhuge Yueyue once again looked at the sky with a cold expression and straightened her back.

At this moment, she no longer cared about her own life. She only hoped that before she died, she could hold out so that her second sister had a chance to survive.

“Haha! You’re just trash, aren’t you?”

One of the seven finally spoke. Are you the one who killed the members of my lightning tiger clan?”

“So what if I did?” Zhuge Yueyue replied coldly. She had no intention of backing down.

The sealed immortal realm expert was clearly angered by Zhuge Yueyue’s words and said coldly.

“Hehehe, not bad. You’ve got guts, but it seems you and your sect don’t need to exist in this world any longer!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he condensed a bolt of blood-red divine lightning and hurled it toward Zhuge Yueyue.

However, at this critical moment, another white figure appeared. In an instant, space trembled and released bursts of seven-colored divine light, and a huge palm imprint struck the lightning bolt and destroyed it.

“Some small fries dared to say that they would destroy my Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

“Who do you think you are?”

Although the figure was shrouded in the seven-colored light, people could vaguely see a peerless figure in the sky, and everyone’s gaze was now focused on this newcomer.

After all, someone who could easily deal with the attack of a sealed immortal realm expert had to be one herself. Moments later, their speculations were proven right, when the figure released the shocking aura of a sealed immortal realm expert!

“Oh my god! It really is another sealed immortal realm expert!”

“Not only that, she must be a peak-level sealed immortal realm expert too! Her aura isn’t inferior to those seven!”

The atmosphere at the scene became extremely serious. Everyone watched this scene nervously without saying a word.

‘Who is this person and why did she save me?’

Zhuge Yueyue was also at a loss at this time. She did not understand why this sealed immortal realm expert had suddenly appeared to help her.

The seven sealed immortal realm experts from the Heavenly Dao World looked at each other. They had all clearly sensed that this sealed immortal realm expert was very powerful.

Because they had descended from the Heavenly Dao World, their cultivation levels had been suppressed, and their strength was severely weakened.

It was for this reason that they did not dare to act recklessly at this moment. They could only stare at the figure in the sky.

After the seven-colored divine light gradually dissipated, everyone finally saw that the figure belonged to a peerless beauty. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She was wearing a pure white dress, as if she was a real fairy. However, her eyes were extremely cold, as if completely devoid of emotion. She looked down at the seven experts silently.

At the same time, after seeing this person arrive, a joyful smile appeared on Ou Yunhai’s face. He muttered, “Yanran…”

Just as he was about to fly over, he realized that Yanran was ignoring him.. Instead, she appeared in front of Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun felt very nervous when they saw this peerless expert in front of them.

After a long time, Zhuge Yue Yue regained her composure. She did not understand why this person wanted to save her, but still spoke very politely.

“Thank you, Senior, for saving our lives. Zhuge Yueyue is very grateful for your kindness.”

Hearing this, Yanran’s cold face revealed a trace of displeasure. She said very seriously, “Why are you calling me senior? You should call me Teacher’s wife.”

“Ah?”

Hearing this sentence, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were dumbfounded.

Was this true?

Seeing this expert’s expression, it did not seem like she was joking. Could it be that she was someone who admired their teacher?

The two of them were very confused.

“Teacher never mentioned to me that he had such a powerful wife,” Feng Xiyun muttered to herself.

If they had known that they had such a powerful backer, they would not have been bullied by others just now.

Zhuge Yueyue asked cautiously, “Um… Are you serious?”

Looking at their doubtful expressions, Yanran was stunned, but immediately understood that Ye Xuan had never told his disciples about her.

After thinking for a moment, Yanran replied, “You will understand what I mean very soon.”

“Alright, you two should go to the rear and hide for a while.”

As soon as she finished speaking, cold killing intent appeared in Yanran’s eyes again as she looked at the seven sealed immortal experts in the sky.
