Chapter 266: Ye Xuan’s Opportunity (Part 2)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Since these two great opportunities could not be obtained in a short period of time, they naturally could not be considered opportunities that could be sensed by the power of karma.

Ye Xuan knew that with his current mastery of the power of karma was insufficient to sense opportunities that were too far in the future.

In that case, this opportunity is related to the mystic realm itself.

Ye Xuan’s eyes opened slightly, and a golden light flashed across them.

Perhaps something had been born in this mystic realm, which was likely why this mystic realm had managed to develop heavenly lightning intent.

It was hidden extremely well, concealed by the heavenly lightning intent. If Ye Xuan had not consumed a large amount of spiritual power to augment his power of karma, he would not have been able to detect anything.

Whoosh!

In an instant, an extremely powerful aura suddenly rippled out and covered the entire mystic realm in an instant.

Shangguan Wan’er, who was sitting cross-legged on her mountain peak, suddenly opened her eyes and looked at Ye Xuan in shock.

Heavenly lightning intent!

This person had actually comprehended the complete form of heavenly lightning intent!

Her calm expression changed.

She believed that her talent was outstanding. Although she might not be the strongest in the Tianyuan continent, she should not have had a problem claiming that title in the Huangyu Zone.

However, reality had given her a rude shock. A random cultivator she had encountered in this small mystic realm had comprehended heavenly lightning intent before she did.

Who was this person?

It was the first time since her reincarnation that she had become interested in someone.

Furthermore, Ye Xuan looked extremely young, and he was definitely at least a ninth-level unity realm expert.

This undoubtedly meant that Ye Xuan was also a peerless Heaven’s Blessed!

Ye Xuan did not notice the change in her expression. His spiritual sense covered the entire mystic realm, and his own heavenly lightning intent slowly resonated with the mystic realm, searching for ‘that thing’.

“What? That’s the complete form of heavenly lightning intent. Who has comprehended it?”

“Why does this person look so unfamiliar? He doesn’t seem to be a cultivator from the Luoyun Region.”

“I’ve never seen this person before, so he must be a cultivator from another region.”

“However, someone like him should be famous. I haven’t left the mystic realm in sixty years, yet it seems that another talented monster has emerged in the outside world.”

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock and began to discuss this matter among themselves.

However, Ye Xuan could not be bothered with this.

“I’ve finally found you!”

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s figure suddenly disappeared.

When he reappeared, he reappeared at the core area of the mystic realm.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and space was instantly torn apart.

“Hold on, this sword intent... ”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes narrowed, and a hint of shock flashed across the depths of her eyes.

Seventh-level sword intent!

It was the same as hers!

However, seconds later, Shangguan Wan’er was even more shocked.

While Ye Xuan was tearing space apart, he seemed to be hindered by some mysterious force. Frowning, he put two fingers together, and sword intent that made the world pale in comparison erupted!

Boom!

The entire mystic realm trembled.

“Ninth-level sword intent!”

“Perfect-level!”

Shangguan Wan’er had never been so shocked and beside herself since she regained part of her memories from her previous life.

The moment Ye Xuan made his move, she realized that he was a tenth level unity realm expert!

A mere tenth-level unity realm expert actually comprehended the complete form of a legendary supreme intent, as well as perfect-level sword intent?

If Ye Xuan was not some old monster deliberately hiding his strength, then his cultivation talent was definitely unfathomably high.

“What’s he doing though?”

Shangguan Wan’er looked at Ye Xuan with confusion.

However, moments later, after Ye Xuan tore space apart, his figure disappeared, and the mystic realm started to tremble as spatial cracks appeared everywhere.

Was this mystic realm about to collapse?

“Not good! The mystic realm appears to be collapsing!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically upon seeing what was going on.

Why had this suddenly happened?

Boom! Boom! Boom!

As the spatial cracks expanded, the world inside the mystic realm quickly collapsed.

The cultivators present started tearing space apart and fleeing the mystic realm.

“The heart of heavenly lightning.”

In the deepest area of the mystic realm, in a pitch-black space, there was a pearl in Ye Xuan’s hand that contained the power of heavenly lightning.

His eyes glowed.

This was his opportunity he had sensed through the power of karma.

This pearl was what formed this mystic realm after countless years of evolution.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan immediately put it away. His spatial intent erupted, and his figure suddenly disappeared.

Inside the spatial turbulence, no one could detect Ye Xuan’s traces!

“Spatial intent!”

At that moment, Shangguan Wan’er, who had just left the mystic realm, felt spatial fluctuations in her surroundings.

What was the origin of this person?

Not only had he comprehended heavenly lightning intent, but also spatial intent; two supreme intents!

“What happened to the mystic realm? Why can I no longer sense it?”

“Is it really disappearing?”

“This...”

Inside the spatial turbulence, everyone looked at the disappearing mystic realm with dismayed looks on their faces.

Why had this happened all of a sudden?

Their opportunity was lost!

With the collapse of the mystic realm, the giant mountains with endless heavenly lightning bolts suddenly appeared in the space turbulence. However, the destructive power contained in the spatial turbulence soon devoured the giant mountains!

From today onward, this mystic realm would never appear ever again!
