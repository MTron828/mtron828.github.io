394 Giving Away A Precious Bone

Pfft!

Looking at Ye Xuan’s embarrassed expression, Feng Xiyun almost laughed. She took a deep breath and steadied herself.

“Junior Sister Feng Xiyun greets Senior Sister. I hope that Senior Sister will take care of me in the future!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue raised her brows questioningly. However, she soon felt at ease.

Cloud Sky peak was extremely spacious. Previously, it was just the two of them. Her teacher had been cultivating in seclusion and had no time to chat with her.

Now that she had a junior sister, the days in the future would be a little more lively.

When she thought of this, Zhuge Yueyue was suddenly happy.

“Hehe! I can’t believe I have a junior sister!”

“Hello, Junior Sister Feng. My name is Zhuge Yueyue. If you have any questions about cultivation in the future, you can come to me anytime!”

Even though their characters and personalities were different, after some interaction, they soon became friends and started chatting happily.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched. Why did he feel like he was being left aside and ignored?

After a long time, the two girls who were in the middle of a conversation suddenly remembered that they had forgotten about their teacher.

At that moment, the two of them stuck out their tongues playfully, their faces full of embarrassment.

Feng Xiyun was a little nervous. She was afraid that her teacher would be angry. Just as she was about to explain, she was interrupted by Zhuge Yueyue.

Zhuge Yueyue said indifferently, “Junior Sister Feng, don’t worry. Teacher is especially good to his disciples and has never lost his temper. You’ll understand when you get to know Teacher more in the future.”

“Teacher is the kindest person I’ve ever seen. He’s not stingy with his disciples at all.”

“I only became his disciple recently, but Teacher gave me spiritual pills and also performed spiritual power infusion for me.”

“He even gave me this Cloud Sky sword!”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she was shocked.

‘Wasn’t this a little too good? Could there really be such a good teacher in this world?’

“Alright, enough with the gossip for now! Let’s head out first! You’ll have plenty of time to chat in the future,” Ye Xuan looked at the night sky and said.

Now that night had fallen, they could only camp outside.

“Mm! Teacher, please get in the carriage.”

Feng Xiyun pointed at the magnificent carriage behind her, indicating for Ye Xuan to get on.

Ye Xuan did not hesitate and sat down directly.

Feeling the soft seats and interior opulence of the carriage, Ye Xuan sighed.

She was a princess alright. The interior of the carriage was quite spacious. Even when Ye Xuan and the other two sat together, it did not feel crowded at all.

As for Xin’er?

She was driving the carriage outside.

About an hour later, Ye Xuan and the others arrived at a lake.

Ye Xuan immediately took out the camping equipment and living necessities from his storage ring and found a suitable place to set up camp.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan called Feng Xiyun over.

“My precious disciple, while your Senior Sister is out hunting. Master will use this time to teach you how to cultivate!”

“Yes, Teacher!”

Feng Xiyun sat opposite Ye Xuan. When she thought about how she would finally step onto the path of cultivation, she became overjoyed.

Ye Xuan did not notice the change in Feng Xiyun’s expression as he continued to talk to himself.

“After some examination, your cultivation talent is rather ordinary. If you want to truly step onto the path of cultivation, you’ll need my help.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and a precious bone that was filled with the power of fire suddenly appeared.

“This is the precious bone of the ape beast that I obtained not long ago. It contains strong fire attribute power.”

“In a bit, I’ll help you absorb the power of the precious bone and fix your cultivation talent!”

“What?”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun was shocked.

The precious bone in his teacher’s hand was actually the precious bone of a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast.

According to the rumors, Ye Xuan had put in a lot of effort to obtain this. Was he really going to let her absorb it just like that?

Just now, when Zhuge Yueyue said that Ye Xuan was extremely good to his disciples, Feng Xiyun had been doubtful. However, her doubts were unfounded, and Ye Xuan’s generosity had exceeded her wildest expectations.

Was Teacher being too generous? Why would he give her this precious bone?

What Feng Xiyun did not know was that Ye Xuan had originally wanted Zhuge Yueyue to absorb it.

However, the precious bone’s fire attribute conflicted with the profound ice divine bone in her body, which is why he had refrained.

Since he just happened to run into Feng Xiyun today, he would finally be able to put this precious bone to good use,

“Teacher, are you sure you’re not joking? This is the precious bone of a heaven realm ape beast, moreover one that was a descendant of an ancient beast. It’s extremely valuable. Are you really going to give it to me?”

Feng Xiyun’s eyes were filled with disbelief. Could this be a test Ye Xuan had devised?

Ye Xuan shook his head and said indifferently, “It’s just a precious bone. It’s not as valuable as you think it is.”

“Even if it was, as my disciple, you are qualified to enjoy these privileges! Let’s get to work and start refining it.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she trembled uncontrollably. Her heart was filled with emotions.

It seemed that she had made the right choice!

“Yes, Teacher!”

There was no need to hesitate further, so she took the precious bone.

Immediately after, Feng Xiyun followed Ye Xuan’s instructions to refine it with his help.
