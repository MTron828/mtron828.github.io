Chapter 210: There Are Some Debts That Need To Be Settled

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, the one who had the biggest reaction was the Seventh Prince.

“This power…”

The Seventh Prince was in a state of shock. He was extremely familiar with this aura.

“This is Ye Xuan…”

“This is Ye Xuan’s aura!”

The Seventh Prince cried out in shock.

During that great battle at the Tower of Heaven, two auras had clashed within the War God Hall. One belonged to that red-armored man, while the other was similar to the aura released by this jade token!

The Seventh Prince could recognize it easily. After all, it had only been a few days since the closure of the mystic realm.

This was Ye Xuan’s power!

This girl’s teacher is actually Ye Xuan!

“Father, stop! Let’s get out of here!”

Thinking this, the Seventh Prince cried out in fear.

He naturally knew that Ye Xuan could not appear in the Radiant Sky Empire,, but Lin Qingping still had two jade tokens. Those were very likely given to Zhao Yuyan by Ye Xuan.

Everyone’s expressions changed.

Ye Xuan?

The same Ye Xuan from the mystic realm?

That terrifying monster who could tear space apart?

Not only did this fellow surpass the master of the Divine Gate, but he had defeated that peak fourth-level unity realm expert that guarded the top floor of the Tower of Heaven.

“Oh? Do you think you can escape?”

The Seventh Prince’s words were still trailing off, but another voice had just spoken up.

At that very instant, everyone’s hair stood on end, and their bodies trembled uncontrollably.

The expressions of the Radiant Sky Sovereign King, Elder Niejin, Dao Weibo, and the other elders, paled, as if they had been plunged into the depths of the abyss.

None of them had noticed where that voice came from! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, ripples suddenly appeared in the sky not far away. Then, a young man slowly walked out of the spatial channel.

Behind the young man were two beautiful ladies.

“Teacher!”

The moment Zhao Yuyan saw Ye Xuan appear, she cried out in excitement, tears clouding her eyes.

After waiting for so many days, her teacher had finally come!

Her teacher was here to pick her up!

“Little girl, your master will bring you back now!”

Ye Xuan smiled and patted Zhao Yuyan’s head, revealing a warm smile.

Ever since he had mastered spatial intent, he could move extremely quickly using teleportation. He had just arrived in the Radiant Sky Empire not too long ago, and had been figuring out where the White Moon Tower was.

However, when Zhao Yuyan crushed the jade token, he instantly sensed her location and teleported over.

“Little girl! You’ve already done very well! But remember, the next time you encounter such a dangerous situation, you must decisively crush the jade card. Don’t wait for others to attack you!”

Ignoring the crowd, Ye Xuan continued to guide Zhao Yuyan with a smile on his face.

In fact, even if he had not arrived in time, Zhao Yuyan would have been fine.

Any one of those three jade tokens would have been enough to keep them safe.

However, Ye Xuan knew Zhao Yuyan’s personality very well. This little girl was too kind, and did not want to hurt others at all.

On the Tianyuan continent, the strong preyed on the weak. It was very difficult to survive with such a personality.

However, she was his disciple, and he could slowly teach her to change.

“En!” Zhao Yuyan nodded her head seriously, and then reached out to wipe away the tears from the corners of her eyes.

Her heart was filled with excitement and joy.

She originally thought that it would take her teacher several months to reach the Radiant Sky Empire, but here he was.

Buzzzzzz!

The Radiant Sky Sovereign King was very decisive. He immediately turned into a streak of light after grabbing the Seventh Prince and tried to escape.

However, moments later, his expression changed drastically. He found that an invisible force had forcibly restrained him.

“This is impossible! How can you be so powerful?”

The Radiant Sky Sovereign King was scared out of his wits.

Although the other party was indeed much stronger than him, he should not have been able to restrain him so easily.

How could a 20-year-old be so terrifying?

It was not just him and the Seventh Prince. Other than Lin Qingping, Zhao Yuyan, Yue and Li Qingyan, no one else was able to move. Only their eyes could move.

At this moment, everyone was filled with horror, and their hair stood on end.

Just how terrifying was this guy’s strength?

At this moment, Ye Xuan raised his head unhurriedly and looked at the Radiant Sky Sovereign King.

“Yan’er, tell your master, which of these people has bullied you?”

“There are some debts that need to be settled properly!”

Ye Xuan’s voice was very calm.

Li Baijun and Elder Niejin were in utter despair.

Ye Xuan!

Who would have thought that this girl’s teacher would be Ye Xuan?

One was a jinx while the other was a peerless genius who had shocked the Nanzhou Region.

Who would have thought that these two people actually had a master-disciple relationship?

Was this jinx’s luck not too heaven-defying?

Li Baijun was filled with despair and jealousy.

I’m doomed!

Similar thoughts ran through Elder Niejin’s mind.
