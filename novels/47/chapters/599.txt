600 Little Potato (Part 1)

Looking at the girl, Ye Xuan did not know what to say. Whose child was this? How could she be so silly?

She was still young, at most six years old, but she could actually scare away a group of children who were older than her?

Seeing the little girl in Ye Xuan’s hand, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also smiling.

Feng Xiyun even came over and pinched the girl’s dirty little face, asking, “Little friend, what are you doing here? Where’s your family?”

!!

After hearing this, the little girl finally came back to her senses and glared at Ye Xuan with her teeth bared.

She raised her head high, clenched her fists, and shouted, “What do you want to do, you bad man? I’m warning you, don’t mess with me, or I’ll beat you down with one punch!”

“Hmph! In this village, I’m the overlord, and none of the children can stop me!”

“Didn’t you guys see the children earlier? I’ve beaten every one of them before. Hehe, I’m very strong, right?”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan’s face twitched a few times. This little girl was really headstrong.

She beat up all of the children in the village?

Where did she learn such behavior from?

The little girl clenched her fists tightly and looked at Ye Xuan smugly, seemingly very satisfied with her glorious achievement.

“Little girl, where did you learn all this from? Why are you calling yourself the overlord of the village?”

Ye Xuan asked as he wiped the sweat off his face.

After hearing this, the little girl thought for a moment before she said seriously, “A beggar grandpa in the village told me this. He said that if I can make all of the other children in the village submit to me, I’ll be the overlord of the village!”

“Now, all of the kids in the village have to run away when they see me. They don’t dare to fight me at all. Hehe, aren’t I awesome?”

Ye Xuan did not know what to say. In a sense, she was right…

Looking at the little girl’s clothes and the dirt on her face, she did not look like a child from the village. Instead, she looked like a vagabond.

However, looking at her, it seemed that she did not care about these things at all. She was even quite happy.

After briefly examining the little girl’s strength, Ye Xuan was shocked.

‘Isn’t she a little too strong?’

Even though this little girl only looked to be about six years old, her strength was much greater than an average adult.

Although she had not set foot on the path of cultivation, her strength was enough to lift a heavy object weighing more than ten thousand jin!

Heavens!

It was no wonder she could scare away all of the other children in the village. With her strength, such a feat was not surprising at all.

At this moment, Ye Xuan asked curiously, “Little girl, what’s your name?”

The little girl was dumbfounded when she heard that. She fiddled with her hair for a bit, and then said with a serious face, “My name is Xiang Yun.”

“But that old man in the village always calls me little tigress. I think that name is really too unpleasant to hear, so I named myself little potato. You can just call me little potato,” The little girl replied with a serious expression.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan laughed.

Someone actually called her little tigress?

It was quite appropriate… Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan even thought that the old man this little girl was talking about should be quite interesting.

Feng Xiyun also chuckled. She pinched her little face and asked, “Xiang Yun sounds like a nice name, but why did you call yourself little potato?”

The little girl lowered her head in deep thought and said, “Ahem… I think that potatoes are really delicious. I want to eat potatoes every day, so I changed my name to little potato.”

After hearing these words, Feng Xiyun was stunned. However, after a while, she understood.

Were potatoes really that delicious?

Looking around, Zhuge Yueyue was deeply shocked.

There were actually so many refugees in this God-slaying Village. They were probably all displaced because of the berserk beasts’ attack…

If she was not wrong, this girl was probably one of them, and did not have anything good to eat on a daily basis, which was probably why she felt that potatoes were the most delicious things she had ever eaten.

This little girl was really simple, saying whatever came to her mind straightforwardly.

Zhuge Yueyue walked to the girl’s side and gently smoothed her dirty hair. She said, “Little potato, why are you wandering around by yourself? Where are your family members?”

Upon hearing this, the little girl innocently said, “I remember that a long time ago, many beasts attacked our village. My family was killed by these beasts…”

“I was hiding in the closet. The beasts were so stupid that they couldn’t find me.”

“This…”

If it had been anyone else who had suffered such a tragedy, they would not be able to let it go. Zhuge Yueyue was a living example of this.

However, looking at the girl, it seemed that the absence of her family did not affect her at all.

Perhaps she was still young and did not know what these things truly meant.

Looking at this little girl, Zhuge Yueyue’s heart was filled with emotions as she spoke with a tender expression, “The old grandpa you mentioned, did you follow him here? Where is he now?”

“He’s gone now. I remember one night, he baked a potato for me and then fell asleep.”

“No matter how hard I shook him, he wouldn’t wake up. He’s smelly all over, just like my family.”

Ye Xuan and the others did not know what to say.

This little girl’s background was too pitiful.

Zhuge Yueyue’s heart was already overflowing with compassion. She looked at Ye Xuan with a pleading face and said, “Teacher… Can we bring her back to Cloud Sky peak?”

Ye Xuan looked at the little girl and smiled without saying anything.
