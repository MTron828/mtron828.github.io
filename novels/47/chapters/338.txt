339 Laws Of The Sword

If the golden divine dragon discovered the existence of the fragment, the ancient black dragon would be in danger.

The fragment was an opportunity to go to the upper world. As long as one reached the upper world, they would no longer be bound by the incomplete laws of the Tianyuan continent and would be able to surpass the great emperor realm.

Thus, no matter what price it had to pay, the ancient black dragon would protect the fragment. Furthermore, it was a single-use item.

“This precious opportunity is mine!”

!!

The ancient black dragon’s eyes glowed with a terrifying light.

As long as he could enter the realm passage, he would be able to surpass the golden divine dragon.

“Black Dragon, come over to the main hall!”

While the ancient black dragon was deep in thought, a terrifying spiritual sense, containing a vast and mighty pressure.

The ancient black dragon squinted its eyes.

He was very familiar with this spiritual sense. It belonged to the golden divine dragon.

It was obvious that the golden divine dragon was also afraid of the two auras that had just appeared, which was why it had summoned him back to the dragon race’s main hall.

Seconds later, the ancient black dragon’s huge body that had been floating in the depths of the endless sea suddenly disappeared.

The sea water instantly rolled back and churned wildly, quickly filling up the empty space the ancient black dragon left behind.

…

Inside the Destiny Divine Tower.

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple obtain 11,351,500 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 17x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 192,975,500 days’ worth of cultivation!”

“Ding! As the host has helped his disciple strengthen her special constitution by 16x, the host has received a randomized 4x critical reward. Congratulations! The host’s special constitution has been strengthened 64x!”

“Ding! Thanks to the host, his disciple has engraved a profound pattern derived from sword intent. As such, the host has received a randomized 888x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 19% of the laws of the sword!”

Multiple system notifications kept ringing out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

After factoring in the conversion rate, he had received 5827 years’ worth of cultivation.

What surprised Ye Xuan even more was that the awakened Chaos Divine Body was not just purely a sword special constitution , but rather a comprehensive one.

The current Ye Xuan had already possessed the combat strength of a great emperor realm expert.

The spiritual power in his dantian had also reached the same level as a first level-great emperor, and his physical strength had reached the same level as a third-level great emperor!

Coupled with his arsenal of supreme intents and martial techniques, it could be said that Ye Xuan’s current strength was truly unmatched within the Tianyuan continent.

Then there were the laws of the sword…

Grasping the laws was something that only great emperor realm experts could do, yet he had already achieved it despite only being a pattern condensation realm cultivator.

The laws of the sword were what all sword cultivators strived to achieve.

Now, across the entire Tianyuan continent, as long as Ye Xuan wanted to, he could control the swords of sword cultivators with a raise of his hand.

Unless the other party also possessed the laws of the sword, their swords would not be able to escape his grasp.

In essence, no one below the third level of the great emperor realm was his match.

Now, after the sudden increase in strength, it was imperative to temper his spiritual sense once again to regain full control of his strength. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After that, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Shangguan Wan’er, who was standing not far away, silent.

“Cough, cough!”

Ye Xuan quickly coughed, trying to ease the awkward atmosphere.

“Ummm, I didn’t see anything just now.”

Ye Xuan was of course spouting nonsense. Given how powerful his spiritual sense was, how could it have escaped his notice?

Although it was just a glance, it was deeply imprinted in Ye Xuan’s mind.

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er blushed, and her ears turned red. She did not believe a single word he said.

This was extremely embarrassing!

How was she going to face Ye Xuan in the future?

Had it been anyone else, Shangguan Wan’er would have cut them in half with her sword.

However, Ye Xuan was different. He was her teacher, and someone who had spared no expense in helping her become stronger.

She felt conflicted about the whole situation in her heart.
