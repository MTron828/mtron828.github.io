911 Who Is Ao Lei?

After a long period of time, Li Xuanzhen spoke with a smile, “Senior, may I know your name?”

Seeing how respectful Li Xuanzhen was, Ao Lei was stunned. Was there something about his aura that made them respect him? What was going on here?

Ao Lei moistened his throat and said in a mature and steady manner, “I’m the grand elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the East continent, Ao Lei.”

After hearing these words, the expressions of the three young men immediately exchanged glances with each other, but it was unclear what they were thinking.

It actually seemed that they were… frightened?

This was a little strange.

When did he become so terrifying?

“Haha, so it’s Grand Elder Ao. This junior’s name is Li Xuanzhen. Greetings, Grand Elder Ao.”

Li Xuanzhen took a deep breath as he greeted Ao Lei respectfully.

Everyone was filled with doubts. As true immortals, why were they being so respectful toward a mere ancient realm expert?

They were all scratching their heads about what was going on. However, Ye Xuan, who had been observing this scene, had already guessed the reason.

At this moment, he did not say anything, but the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“So that’s how it is. This is even more interesting,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

At this moment, the atmosphere was very awkward, so to change it up, Ou Tian could only awkwardly say, “Alright, I don’t have much time, so I won’t waste time chatting here.”

After saying this, he took out his weapon as he prepared to kill Shan Ling.

Unexpectedly, Ye Xuan stood in front of him without saying a word, forcing him to stop.

“Oh?”

Ou Tian furrowed his brows when he saw this. He was clearly displeased. Someone actually dared to block him?

“What do you mean by this?”

A wave of anger welled up, and the atmosphere at the scene became much more serious once again and people were wondering what was about to happen.

Hearing Ou Tian’s question, Ye Xuan replied nonchalantly, “Since you’re in a hurry, don’t trouble yourself with this old monster. I can handle it myself.”

“Hahaha!”

Ou Tian burst into laughter. Where did this guy come from? This fellow actually believed he could deal with Shan Ling?

“Okay then, funny guy, show me how you’re going to deal with him,” Ou Tian said mockingly.

Then, he put his hands on his hips and stepped back to watch Ye Xuan’s performance. He was certain that this person would end up in a very miserable state in a short while, and perhaps even die.

Seeing Ye Xuan’s actions, Li Xuanzhen felt very confused. He looked at Yanran and asked, “Sister Yanran, who is this person?”

Yanran looked at Ou Tian in front of her with a face full of disgust. After thinking for a moment, she replied with a cold expression, “He’s the Sword Elder of the East continent’s Great Wilderness Divine sect, Ye Xuan.”

“Ye Xuan?”

He had never heard of this person’s name before…

After waving his hand, Li Xuanzhen had no intention of interfering. In any case, it was not his conflict to meddle in. Perhaps this kid would surprise him, and he was curious what sort of talents had appeared in the Great Wilderness Divine sect over the years.

The atmosphere at the scene became even more tense. Ye Xuan was not in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he imitated Ou Tian and looked at him arrogantly.

It was obvious that Ye Xuan’s competitive spirit had been aroused at this moment.

Ye Xuan laughed and said, “Haha, I’m not courting death. If you don’t believe me, you can go join Shan Ling and fight me. I’ll kill you both later. How about that?”

“Say that again if you have the ability!”

After hearing this, Ou Tian was so angry that even his hair stood on end. He had always been considered a genius. Even in the Heavenly Dao World, he was highly respected.

No one dared to look down on him like this, yet after he descended to this lower world, he was actually insulted by this fellow? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A wave of killing intent was instantly released, as Ou Tian’s fury surged. He really wanted to get rid of this arrogant fellow in front of him.

“Oh my god, Ye Xuan is still Ye Xuan.”

“He’s really arrogant. Shan Ling is already very troublesome to deal with, but now he wants to deal with Ou Tian too? How reckless!”

At this moment, everyone was in heated discussion. It seemed that in order to deal with this arrogant guy, Ye Xuan had opted to become even more arrogant.

In a way, it felt quite refreshing for them, as they were unable to curse and insult this guy given the gap in strength between them. Therefore, they cheered him on inwardly.

At this moment, Ou Tian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. However, just as he was about to make a move, a pair of large hands firmly held him down…
