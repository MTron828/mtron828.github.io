589 Mo Nan (Part 1)

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Han Sikong smiled helplessly.

“Sir, please don’t scare me.”

However, he was pleased that the situation had not escalated further.

“Sir, I’ll send the money from the auction to Cloud Sky peak along with the herbs. Is that okay?”

!!

“Sure thing. Then, we’ll be leaving first.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan brought Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun away, beginning their journey toward the Immortal Divine sect.

Quite a bit of time had passed, so he was not sure if the situation over there had been resolved. If they had already finished fighting, they would probably only be able to pick up the scraps and do some clean-up work.

Still, it would be worth the visit if the fighting had not ended.

At this moment, the Immortal Divine sect was already under fire.

Ao Lei roared, “”Go! Kill them all!”

Upon hearing this order, many of the sect’s cultivators launched their attacks, shattering the sect’s guardian formation.

When this happened, the sect’s cultivators that had surrounded the Immortal Divine sect all charged in.

However, before they could make it in, the guardian beast of the Immortal Divine sect woke up. It was a descendant of a Qilin!

Moments later, it roared fiercely and rushed to meet the incoming cultivators.

“Evil creature!”

Ao Lei instantly launched an attack. Using the Great Desolation technique, he pulled the Qilin into his domain, greatly weakening its attacks.

“Owuuu!”

The Qilin roared again, and then tried to swipe Ao Lei with its hooves.

Ao Lei was not afraid of it at all, and drew his sword and unleashed another attack to meet it.

The Qilin’s hoof was chopped off by Ao Lei’s sword as soon as the two made contact.

“Ah! He’s also a supreme realm expert!”

Everyone widened their mouths in shock. At this moment, they finally discovered that Ao Lei had reached the supreme realm.

Even Yi Feng was extremely shocked.

In reality, Ao Lei had reached the supreme realm a long time ago, but had never revealed it.

Even when the ancient tomb opened, he had not participated in the exploration, choosing instead to temper his cultivation in seclusion.

However, at this moment, he was no longer hiding his cultivation level.

“Damn it!”

From a secret room in the Immortal divine sect, an old man with a head full of white hair frantically flew into the sky.

When he saw the people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect killing his sect’s cultivators, he was enraged.

“Ao Lei! What gave you the courage to attack my Immortal Divine sect?”

This old man felt extremely angry and confused. Why would Ao Lei and the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect suddenly show up here?

He had been cultivating in seclusion for many years, and had no clue as to what was going on in the outside world.

Were it not for the fact that the Immortal Divine sect was under attack, he would not have shown himself.

Upon seeing this old man, Ao Lei’s expression changed.

This old man was still alive?

Yi Feng was equally shocked. He could not believe his eyes.

They were no strangers to this person.

Back then, when the Immortal Divine sect had picked a fight with Ao Lei, and the latter had also attacked the sect. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It was because of this old man’s appearance that the matter was suppressed and resolved.

This person was Mo Nan, a cultivator of the same generation as Yi Feng.

He was a middle-stage supreme realm cultivator, which was considered very terrifying.

At that time, perhaps only Chief Tian Xuan could defeat him. No one else dared to pick a fight with him.

The reason why Ao Lei had dared to attack the Immortal Divine sect back then was due to Chief Tian Xuan’s support.

However, now that Chief Tian Xuan was no longer here, there was no one in the Great Wilderness Divine sect who could defeat Mo Nan.

When he had planned to come here and eradicate the Immortal Divine sect, Ao Lei had mistakenly believed that Mo Nan had died a long time ago. Who would have expected that the old man was still alive and well?

Furthermore, in this situation, it was a little difficult to stop halfway.

Yi Feng went over to Ao Lei and said softly, “Ao Lei, why don’t we just drop this matter? After all, this old man is really too strong, and my senior brother Tian Xuan is no longer with us.”

Hearing this, Ao Lei was very unwilling, especially after recalling that Gao Shun had been killed by these people. His fists were tightly clenched.

“Don’t even think about it. Today’s matter will definitely not end here. We must eradicate everyone from the Immortal DIvine sect to avenge Gao Shun!”

Even after seeing Mo Nan appear, Ao Lei still did not back down, his aura surging once more.

“Mo Nan, you old cur, there’s no need to exchange words pointlessly. No matter what, I’m going to destroy the Immortal Divine sect today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ao Lei immediately launched his attack.

Mo Nan was utterly shocked when he saw this.

Only a hundred years had passed, yet that young brat from back then had already reached the supreme realm?

...

However, when he realized that his sect’s cultivators were still being slaughtered, he trembled with anger.

He forced Ao Lei to retreat with a palm strike and asked angrily, “Ao Lei! There doesn’t seem to be any enmity between our sects, so why are you attacking us? The matter from back then had already been resolved. Are you not afraid of retribution?”

“Hahaha! Retribution? If I’m not afraid of anything! Besides, this matter started because of your sect!”

“Your people bullied our sect’s disciples, and even killed my junior brother cruelly!

After saying this, Ao Lei felt even more grief and indignation, and he roared with an expression that was laced with killing intent.

“No matter what, I have to kill all of you today!”

“What?!”
