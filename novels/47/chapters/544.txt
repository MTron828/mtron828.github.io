545 Ou Yunhai (Part 3)

However, things had already developed to this point, so he simply concluded that Yanran was testing him.

He would prove himself to her and win her heart.

Hehe…

Ye Xuan’s thoughts drifted about happily. He already had a detailed plan to defeat Ou Yunhai and become Yanran’s official boyfriend.

In the distance, Ou Yunhai finally came back to his senses after doubting his life for a while.

He stared at Ye Xuan coldly and said fiercely, “I’m going to watch you closely and see what’s so special about you,”

From Ou Yunhai’s perspective, Ye Xuan was nothing more than an ordinary cultivator who had just reached the supreme realm. He fully expected Ye Xuan to die in the upcoming battle for the immortal heavenly treasure.

If Ye Xuan did not die by his hands, then Yanran probably would not blame him, right? In that case, he should be able to pursue her again.

‘I’m really smart, hahaha!’

While Ou Yunhai was immersed in his own thoughts, the surroundings became quieter.

Mo Yunhai and the assassin leader of Slaughter City were among the experts attracted by the heavenly treasure on the back of the black tortoise. Their eyes were full of desire.

At this moment, the heaven devouring divine sparrow flew into the clouds and swooped down. It wanted to suck everyone into its stomach and digest them. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Seeing this, the assassin leader immediately burst into laughter.

“Hehe, this little bird is quite impudent. It doesn’t know what’s good for it!”

Ou Yunhai also drew his saber and unleashed a saber beam toward the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

Boom!

With a deafening sound, the huge heaven devouring divine sparrow was split into two and fell to the ground.

Seeing this scene, the crowd was extremely shocked.

“Ou Yunhai was this strong?”

The heaven devouring divine sparrow was a supreme realm beast, so there was no doubting its strength.

However, it could not even withstand a single blow?

When he saw the shocked expressions on the faces of the crowd, Ou Yunhai was secretly happy. He should have been able to show off this time, right?

All of a sudden, the heaven devouring divine sparrow, which had been split into two, slowly condensed back together. Furthermore, its strength had increased significantly.

At that moment, the heaven devouring divine sparrow seemed to be very excited. It looked at Ou Yunhai with disdain, as if to say, “Hehe, stinky young man, come on! Bring it on!”

Seeing this, Ou Yunhai was enraged. He had thought that he had killed the heaven devouring divine sparrow, but it had actually come back to life.

Not only had it been resurrected, but the attack he had just launched had also been devoured and become a source of its strength.

“Pfft…”

Ye Xuan could not help but laugh. This guy was too pretentious. However, this sudden turn of events probably utterly embarrassed him.

“Hahaha!”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s laughter, Ou Yunhai’s face turned even darker as he spoke in a low voice, “What’s so funny?”

“Ahem, it’s nothing. I just thought of something funny,” Ye Xuan said unhappily, and then he laughed again.

It seemed like not everyone was suited for the business of showing off.

Ou Yunhai could sense the mocking tone in Ye Xuan’s voice.

He really did not expect to make a fool of himself while Yanran was present.

Even though his heart was filled with anger, he suddenly thought of a good idea. He forced himself to calm down and immediately looked at Ye Xuan.

“Seeing how confident Brother Ye Xuan is, your combat prowess should be pretty good, right?”

“How about you show us what you’re capable of? I’m sure everyone here would like to know how strong you are.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the onlookers immediately echoed his words, waiting to watch the show.

They could tell that there was a fight brewing between the two, though it was currently manifesting itself in the form of a competition.

Ou Yunhai was the Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect, so he would attract attention no matter where he went.

Furthermore, only those who had arrived early had witnessed Ye Xuan killing the white-browed old man, and they were not about to spoil the fun.

At this moment, Ye Xuan walked out of the crowd with a calm expression. He glanced at Ou Yunhai and said, “That’s fine. Since Brother Ou thinks so highly of me, I would be disrespecting you by rejecting.”

Seeing that his plan had succeeded, Ou Yunhai was secretly delighted.

‘Tsk! You brainless fellow, just you wait! I’ll be the one laughing at you in a moment! I won’t let you ever forget the shame you felt when that happened.’

Ou Yunhai clearly did not think highly of Ye Xuan. After all, the heaven devouring divine sparrow was known for its powerful ability to regenerate and heal.

Even though he himself had just cut the heaven devouring divine sparrow in half, it had still survived and become even more powerful.

Given Ye Xuan’s meager cultivation level, there was no way he could do anything to the heaven devouring divine sparrow. Ou Yunhai was already looking forward to humiliating Ye Xuan.

At this moment, Ye Xuan had already flown over to the heaven devouring divine sparrow. He extended his left hand and waved it upward.

“Tsk! Acting so mysterious. Aren’t you going to draw your weapon?”

Ou Yunhai immediately provoked Ye Xuan.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s right hand suddenly emitted a golden light, and an overwhelming sword intent swept out, causing strong gusts of wind and rumbling thunder.

Soon, a huge sword that was over a hundred meters long had condensed right above the heaven devouring divine sparrow!

Seeing this, the heaven devouring divine Sparrow could not help but shiver as memories rushed into its mind.

It still remembered that Ye Xuan had used this move to severely injure it not too long ago.
