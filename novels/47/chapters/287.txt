288 Spiritual Power Infusion

As long as the bloodsoul dream spirit flower was refined, the cultivator would also have an increased chance of comprehending slaughter intent, as well as reincarnation intent.

“Ding! As the host has given the bloodsoul dream spirit flower to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 53x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the azure cloud of myriad ideas!”

When the system’s notification rang out, Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows.

What the f*ck was this?

Why was its name so strange?

When he turned his attention to his storage space, he spotted an extremely strange plant. Its leaves were azure, and its flowers were as fluffy as the clouds in the sky.

“What kind of cultivation methods and martial techniques are you currently cultivating?”

This was not the time to study spiritual items, so Ye Xuan turned his attention back to Shangguan Wan’er again.

As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, Shangguan Wan’er’s martial techniques and cultivation methods were definitely not low-rank stuff. However, Ye Xuan was not sure what level they were at exactly.

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er reached out her hand and touched Ye Xuan’s forehead.

She allowed Ye Xuan to examine all of the martial techniques and cultivation methods she had cultivated.

As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, every time Shangguan Wan’er made a breakthrough in her cultivation, the corresponding martial techniques and cultivation methods would appear in her mind.

“The martial techniques are higher-grade earth-rank ones, and the cultivation methods are supreme-grade earth-rank ones!”

“Although they aren’t bad, I have better ones!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and touched Shangguan Wan’er’s forehead.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Divine Lightning Purple Cloud sword technique (Top-grade Heaven-rank), the host has received a randomized 30x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the nine-cloud sword technique (Top-grade Heaven-rank)!”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Imprisonment Realm Sword Formation (Top-grade Heaven-rank), the host has received a randomized 60x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Middle Realm Sword Formation (Top-grade Heaven-rank)!”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the World Domain (Top-grade Heaven-rank), the host has received a randomized 5x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Sumeru Domain (Top-grade Heaven-rank)!”

…

Just as Shangguan Wan’er was about to start comprehending the martial techniques and cultivation methods that Ye Xuan had taught her, Ye Xuan’s voice rang out again.

“This is still not enough. Only by cultivating a spiritual sense tempering technique can one perfectly control one’s own strength!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan reached out his hand again and touched Shangguan Wan’er’s forehead.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Soul Heaven Heart Sutra to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 3,800x times critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Sacred Soul Freedom Sutra!”

What? 3,800x multiplier?!

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

This was the first time he had seen such a high multiplier.

He was overcome with joy.

As expected, the higher the level of the spiritual sense tempering cultivation technique, the more demanding the requirements of the cultivator’s realm and soul strength.

It seemed that he would have to use epiphanies to comprehend this technique!

“All that’s left now is the spiritual power infusion!”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan’s heart was filled with anticipation.

Ever since he had obtained the system, he had never had the opportunity to perform spiritual power infusion on a disciple at the same cultivation level as he was.

Shangguan Wan’er was a four-pattern condensation realm expert.

However, in terms of physical strength and the amount of spiritual power in his body, Ye Xuan far surpassed Shangguan Wan’er.

Shangguan Wan’er also had the Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, which had yet to awaken. As such, she could definitely withstand his spiritual power infusion.

“My precious disciple, hurry up and sit down. Master will perform spiritual power infusion for you now.”

“Ah, okay, Teacher.”

Shangguan Wan’er was still in a daze after receiving so many things from Ye Xuan.

Then, at Ye Xuan’s behest, Shangguan Wan’er sat cross-legged.

However, she was a little nervous.

Ever since she had awakened the memories of her previous life, Shangguan Wan’er had never received any spiritual power infusion from anyone!

In her mind, her teacher was very strong. Could she really withstand his spiritual power?

While she was thinking that, Ye Xuan’s hands were suddenly pressed against her back.

Moments later, his mighty spiritual power surged into her body.

“Don’t be nervous. Relax your state of mind. I will control my power!”

When she sensed the spiritual power infusion, Shangguan Wan’er’s natural instinct was to resist, but after hearing Ye Xuan’s voice, Shangguan Wan’er gradually relaxed and allowed Ye Xuan’s spiritual power to flow into her body.

Compared to other cultivators, Ye Xuan’s spiritual power contained the destructive power of heavenly lightning.

Therefore, when Ye Xuan was pouring spiritual power into her, he had to control his own power very carefully to avoid causing any damage to her meridians.

Through Ye Xuan’s spiritual power infusion, although she would not obtain any additional profound patterns, she would experience a baptism of the natural laws.

As time passed, Ye Xuan’s spiritual power was like a rising tide that kept pouring into Shangguan Wan’er’s body.

As expected of the reincarnation of an ancient great empress!

Her dantian was like a bottomless pit, continuously receiving Ye Xuan’s spiritual power.

Buzzzzzz!

Suddenly, Ye Xuan’s expression changed. He suddenly felt a sense of danger and hurriedly ceased the spiritual power infusion.

Although he had not reached Shangguan Wan’er’s limit, Ye Xuan, who possessed the power of karma, could sense that something was wrong.

“Ding! As the host has performed spiritual power infusion, providing his disciple with 1,800 days’ worth of cultivation, the host has received a randomized 1,980x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained 356,400 days’ worth of cultivation.”

In an instant, a surge of power suddenly poured into Ye Xuan’s body. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Even with Ye Xuan’s extremely powerful physical strength, he actually felt full and a little uncomfortable.

It was not that Shangguan Wan’er had reached her limit, but rather his physical body had been about to reach its limit, which was why he received a warning from the power of karma.

After the system’s reward, he had obtained nearly a thousand years’ worth of cultivation!
