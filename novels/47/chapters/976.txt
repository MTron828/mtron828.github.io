As he held the Flowing Cloud Sword in his hand, Gongsun Zhi’s aura continued to rise.

“Great Wilderness Divine sect, hehe!”

After laughing out loud, Gongsun Zhi looked up at the sky. Moments later, a golden light was released and illuminated the entire world, causing the onlookers to panic.

“This move?”

Floating in the air, Zhuge Yueyue reached out her hand to touch the breeze that flowed through her fingertips. Suddenly, a wave of sadness arose in her heart.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s mind seemed to have been disturbed by an inexplicable force. Sad scenes kept appearing in her mind.

Yueyue’s face turned pale at this moment, because the scene that appeared in her mind was the scene of his parents being devoured by the berserk beasts.

Seeing her parents lying in front of her in such a miserable state, she started to tremble and her consciousness became blurry.

“Oh no!”

“This aura can actually affect people’s emotions.”

Feng Xiyun, who was watching the battle, instantly sensed that something was wrong with Gongsun Zhi’s sword move, and began to worry for her First Sister.

She was well aware of the painful experiences Zhuge Yueyue had buried deep within her heart.

This was also the last thing Zhuge Yueyue wanted to face, even though her attitude had always been unyielding and her image in people’s hearts had always been very strong.

However, every night, Feng Xiyun would see her First Sister lying quietly next to the windowsill, looking at the moon and reminiscing about her family who had passed away.

It was also for this reason that Feng Xiyun was worried when she realized what Gongsun Zhi’s sword move was capable of, as she knew just how much it would affect Zhuge Yueyue.

“First Sister! You must persevere!”

However, she could not interfere, and could only lend her support to her First Sister through her words.

After all, this was just a fair fight between the two of them. If she attacked rashly at this moment, it would definitely damage the reputation of the Great Wilderness Divine ect and her First Sister.

On the other hand, Zhuge Yueyue was still feeling extremely sad. Her tears fell quietly, and her mind was filled with the shadows of her parents.

At this moment, she was about to lose herself to her emotions.

After discovering this situation, many onlookers at the scene were surprised, and also worried for her.

“You have to hold on!”

Many disciples were cheering and encouraging Zhuge Yueyue.

Who would have thought that Zhuge Yueyue would have such a weakness?

Perhaps Gongsun Zhi was lucky enough to stumble upon this, but it seemed that the tides of battle had changed.

When Gongsun Zhi realized that Zhuge Yueyue was greatly affected, he laughed out loud.

“Haha! As long as you are a human, then you will be affected by your emotions. It is the same for immortals.’

“l spent over a hundred years and went through countless difficulties to comprehend this sword technique. I originally wanted to keep this sword move as a trump card to surprise my enemy, but I didn’t expect to be forced to use it on you today.”

“Actually, you should feel honored. After all, you are the first to witness my sword technique and the first person to be killed by it.”

Although Gongsun Zhi was speaking proudly, Zhuge Yueyue could not hear anything at the moment. She seemed to be completely lost in her emotions.

In front of Zhuge Yueyue, there seemed to be thousands of mirrors, and each mirror displayed Zhuge Yueyue’s weakness.

“Is this my truest self?”

“My teacher once told me that everyone has a different face. Only by looking inwardly can one discover the true side of a person.”

“Dao is both emotional and heartless. The most important thing is to be open-minded and to not to lose focus…”

The words that her teacher had once told her surfaced in her memory. Zhuge

Yueyue began to seriously examine herself and her own flaws at this moment.

She realized that she was still young and inexperienced. At the same time, she had deep thoughts in her heart. No matter what kind of thing it was, she wanted to do it perfectly and was unwilling to show any weakness.

“Mirrors can reflect different faces. The most important thing is to be able to give and take. Only then can I truly accept myself…” After muttering to herself, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes lit up.

“l understand…

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue was enlightened.

She had been stuck at the peak of the supreme realm, and had not been able to step into the next realm.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After all, her cultivation journey was too smooth. Her master had been escorting her and guiding her, so she did not know the true path.

Thanks to Gongsun Zhi’s sword move, she had discovered her true self and comprehended the meaning of her Dao!

At this moment, his eyes had already returned to their original lively state. After taking a deep breath, she took in the scene around her, and then instantly destroyed the illusion created by Gongsun Zhi, along with the image of her dead parents lying in front of her.

Zhuge Yueyue had already said goodbye to her past. From this moment on, she had accepted her true self.

The shattering of the illusion shocked everyone, including Gongsun Zhi.

“This…

“This can’t be real. She can actually destroy the illusion I created?”

Gongsun Zhi panicked again. This was his only trump card, and from the looks of things just now, he had the situation completely under control.

However, who would have thought that Zhuge Yueyue would actually be able to destroy his illusion!

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were filled with killing intent. The sadness within them had long disappeared. Her emotions would no longer be affected by the illusions created by Gongsun Zhi. After all, she had already comprehended and accepted her true self.

The surrounding spiritual energy began to surge frantically into Zhuge

Yueyue’s body….
