Chapter 60: Stay Out Of The Juniors’ Fight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

The jade slip that Zhu Peng was holding suddenly shattered, releasing an extremely powerful force. It was almost as if a small meteorite had exploded.

That resplendent and destructive force caused everyone’s hearts to shudder.

At the same time, terrifying energy fluctuations spread out, and cracks appeared on the arena’s array formation. It seemed like the array would shatter at any moment.

Fortunately, these were only the energy fluctuations from the jade slip. If that terrifying attack was to directly hit the array formation, the array would have been destroyed.

The cultivators closer to the arena saw this and heaved a sigh of relief. They had survived a disaster.

“F*ck! Isn’t this too f*cking exciting? This daddy came to watch a good show, and almost died!”

Before the crowd could react further, Chen Junhao angrily shouted, “You guys are courting death!”

The crowd quickly came back to their senses and discovered that the Zhu family head and the two elders in the audience seats had disappeared. When they reappeared, they had already arrived in front of the nearly broken array formation.

They wanted to use this opportunity to kill Chen Ping.

Chen Ping relied on the protective power of the jade slip to withstand the full-power attack of the sixth level purple spirit realm expert stored the jade slip earlier, However, Zhu Peng, who activated the jade slip, had been reduced to ashes! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

With three powerful purple spirit realm cultivators attacking together, even if Chen Junhao took action, he would definitely not be able to stop them.

This was the Zhu family’s final plan! If Zhu Peng failed, they would kill Chen Ping at all costs.

......

“The three of you, this is a battle between juniors. You guys should just stay put obediently!”

Just when everyone thought that Chen Ping was about to die, laughter broke out.

At the same time, an incomparably terrifying spiritual pressure suddenly swept over the arena.

When everyone felt it, their expressions changed drastically. Sweat dripped down from their foreheads like raindrops, and their bodies trembled.

“This… this is the terrifying spiritual pressure of a core formation realm cultivator…”

Although they had never seen a core formation realm cultivator before, at this moment, this single unified thought flashed through their minds at the same time.

This overwhelming pressure and terrifying power that was as vast as the sea could only belong to a core formation realm cultivator.

When Chen Ping was about to die, this terrifying pressure happened to appear. It was obvious that this core formation realm cultivator was the leader of the Mad Saber sect, who was also Chen Ping’s teacher.

When the Zhu family head and the two elders saw this, their expressions changed. Their gazes landed on a building not far away.

There they saw a middle-aged man in a long green robe standing indifferently on top of the building. He then raised his eyelids slightly, and his gaze seemed to contain monstrous pressure.

“The Zhu… the Zhu family is done for!”

When the three of them saw this scene, they revealed expressions of despair.

Under this incomparably powerful pressure, the purple spiritual power in their bodies was suddenly frozen, and their bodies were unable to move.

“Is this the power of a core formation realm cultivator?”

At this moment, the three of them had bitter expressions on their faces.

They originally thought that the three of them would be able to suppress Chen Ping by going all out, but they did not expect the gap between the core formation realm and the purple spirit realm to be so large.

The middle-aged man took a step forward, instantly crossing several hundred meters. He then appeared in the air above the arena.

“Family head, please don’t interfere in the battle between juniors!”

The middle-aged man looked at the Zhu family head and the two elders with a smile.

“I dislike people who don’t follow the rules the most!”

“You guys… Why don’t you just die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a giant palm smashed down toward the Zhu family head and the other two elders.

Rumble!

The incomparably powerful force of the attack turned the three of them into a bloody mist!

When everyone saw this scene unfold, they trembled, and their hearts were filled with fear.

Some of the more cowardly cultivators were even frightened to the point of peeing their pants.

No matter what, those were still three powerful purple spirit realm cultivators, and the Zhu family head was one of the three strongest cultivators in Jiangqing City.

However… he was unable to withstand a single palm strike from a core formation realm cultivator.

Was this the true strength of a core formation realm cultivator? It was actually even more terrifying than the rumors.

It could be said that the appearance of the leader of the Mad Saber sect had left an indelible and terrifying impression on the countless cultivators of Jiangqing City.

No wonder the Chen family was so arrogant. If they had such a backer, they would probably be the same.

It seemed that Jiangqing City was really going to change.

Among the countless cultivators, only Yue, Li Qingyan, Huang Ling and Xue Min remained unaffected.

They naturally knew very well how terrifying a core formation realm expert was. However, they had been by Ye Xuan’s side for quite some time. Although the leader of the Mad Saber sect terrified the cultivators of Jiangqing City, to these four, it was obvious that there was still a huge gap between him and Ye Xuan.

‘Teacher’s strength definitely far surpasses the leader of the Mad Saber sect!’ Li Qingyan thought to herself.

When they were at the auction house previously, Ye Xuan had once released a terrifying pressure. The suffocation brought about by that terrifying pressure was far greater than the pressure that the leader of the Mad Saber sect was exuding.

“Huh?”

After casually killing the leader of the Zhu family, the leader of the Mad Saber sect narrowed his eyes as he looked at Yue and the others.

Seeing that they were mostly unaffected, a tinge of surprise flashed across his eyes.

However, what surprised him the most were the cultivation levels of Yue and the others.

They were all very young, but the weakest among them had already reached the true essence realm.

Although the leader of the Mad Saber sect’s cultivation was not as high as Ye Xuan’s, mere true essence realm cultivators could not hide their cultivation levels from him.

Unless Yue and the others had learned an aura concealment technique, there was no way for them to hide their cultivation levels from a core formation realm cultivator.

Obviously, these people came from some sort of prestigious background.

“Could they be the personal disciples of some top sect who are out training in the outside world?” Seeing this, the master of the Mad Saber sect could not help but think to himself.

Then, he took a step forward and instantly arrived on a rooftop not far away. He paid little attention to Yue and the others.

He had just arrived at Jiangqing City. As a core formation realm cultivator, he naturally could not be bothered to research what was going on in Jiangqing City.

Therefore, he did not even know Li Qingyan, let alone Yue and the others.

“Continue!”

The leader of the Mad Saber sect said to Chen Ping with an indifferent expression.
