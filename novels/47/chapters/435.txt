436 Hell Slash

“Father,” Gao Tianyu greeted respectfully as soon as he entered the residence.

When Gao Shun noticed that the person who had entered was his precious son, he immediately suppressed the anger in his heart.

“Tianyu, when did you exit your secluded cultivation?”

“Just moments ago. Father, what happened? Why are you so angry?” Gao Tianyu asked.

!!

Gao Shun sighed helplessly.

“In the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect, who else would make me angry other than that guy on Cloud Sky peak?”

Gao Tianyu squinted his eyes. “Cloud Sky peak again?”

Then, Gao Shun told Gao Tianyu everything that had happened earlier. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When Gao Tianyu heard this, he became enraged and his gaze turned cold.

“This Ye Xuan is really too much of a bully. Father, don’t worry. I know what to do!”

“Since Cloud Sky peak dared to insult Hidden Sword peak like this, I’ll definitely take revenge during the Seven Peaks competition.”

“It doesn’t matter if Ye Xuan himself is powerful. His disciples have only started cultivating recently. Hmph! They better pray that they don’t meet me in the preliminaries, otherwise… Cloud Sky peak will be annihilated!”

Gao Tianyu’s eyes were filled with coldness.

Although he was arrogant and loved women, he still respected his father. As such, he had to take revenge and regain the honor of Hidden Sword peak.

Seeing Gao Tianyu’s confident look, Gao Shun’s eyes lit up, and his sullen mood dissipated considerably.

“Very good! As expected of my son!”

“Whether Hidden Sword peak can hold its head high or not, it all depends on your performance in the Seven Peaks competition.”

“Hmph! Ye Xuan is too arrogant. If you lose to Cloud Sky peak in the competition, I won’t hear the end of it from him.”

Gao Shun’s eyes were solemn as he said that, his expression filled with monstrous fury.

Hearing this, Gao Tianyu revealed a confident smile. “Father, don’t worry. I have already reached the fourth level of the materialization realm, and am on the verge of breaking through to the fifth level.”

“In the entire sect, no one is worth to be my opponent except for Senior Brother Hua!”

When Gao Shun heard that, he hurriedly examined Gao Tianyu’s cultivation.

“Hahaha! You’re indeed my son. It only took you two months to break through from the first level of the materialization realm to the fourth level. Very good…”

“Ye Xuan! Just wait to be humbled at the competition!”

At the thought of Ye Xuan’s imminent defeat, Gao Shun could not stifle a smile.

“Tianyu, come with your father. In order to prevent any unforeseen circumstances during the competition, I will teach you a set of secret techniques and divine powers!”

Gao Shun then brought Gao Tianyu to the cultivation room.

Elsewhere, the other chiefs were also hard at work pushing their disciples to cultivate for the competition, giving them pointers, guidance, as well as teaching them secret techniques and divine powers.

The incident with Ye Xuan had ignited a spark in every chief.

Soon, there were only three days left before the competition.

The atmosphere within the sect became increasingly intense.

On Cloud Sky peak, in the bamboo forest, Ye Xuan was waiting for Zhuge Yueyue, who had just arrived.

“Teacher, why did you call me here today?” Zhuge Yueyue was a little confused.

Everyone else was frantically cultivating in preparation for the competition, yet Ye Xuan had called her over so early in the morning. Did he have something to tell her?

Ye Xuan looked at the lake not far away, then casually broke off a bamboo stick and said, “My precious disciple, I’m going to teach you a unique technique today. Watch carefully…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan slowly raised the bamboo stick. His entire being seemed to have become one with the world.

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes brightened when she saw this. She stared at Ye Xuan’s every move, afraid that she would miss any detail.

At this moment, the bamboo stick in Ye Xuan’s hand swept toward the lake in front of him, shining brightly.

Moments later, the lake instantly surged with thousands of waves, as if the entire had been lashed with thousands of giant whips.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, she was shocked.

Her teacher’s sword strike was so terrifying!

After Ye Xuan was done, he slowly lowered the bamboo stick and said, ”

“This move is called the Heavenly Slash. It’s a move that I created after studying the Cloud Sky sword technique. It’s extremely powerful, and if it’s cultivated to the major mastery stage, can slash through anything and everything.”

“Did you see it clearly just now?”

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded excitedly. She had photographic memory, so she naturally remembered all of Ye Xuan’s moves.

She quickly replayed it in her mind as she comprehended the Heavenly Slash technique. Since it was derived from the Cloud Sky sword technique, it was not difficult for Zhuge Yueyue to comprehend it.

“Teacher, I’ve understood the basics!”

“Hmm, that’s good!”

Ye Xuan displayed a satisfied look.

At this moment, a system notification suddenly rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has taught the Heavenly Slash technique to his disciple, the host has received a randomized 289x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the heaven-grade divine power, Hell Slash!”

Ye Xuan smiled. Even if he had nothing on hand to give his disciple, he could derive a new divine power to teach his disciple and earn a reward.

After that, insights regarding the Hell Slash technique filled his mind. With the aid of the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao and the system, he rapidly grasped the essence of the Hell Slash technique.

Zhuge Yueyue, on the other hand, was completely immersed in the power of the Heavenly Slash technique, and her eyes were full of excitement.

...

After that, she personally tried it out. Although it lacked the terrifying power of Ye Xuan’s sword strike, even those who were one minor cultivation realm above her might not be able to withstand the blow.
