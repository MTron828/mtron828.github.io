563 Doing It Right This Time

“Elder Taiyin, I was careless a few days ago, and you managed to keep your sorry life. However, miracles don’t happen twice.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After Ye Xuan said these words coldly, his figure soared up ten thousand meters into the sky.

Moments later, a ferocious gale began to blow, and the sounds of thunder rumbled in all directions as a sense of oppression filled the air. Even the onlookers who were in the distance felt their hearts palpitate.

Yi Feng and Mo Gen were shocked when they sensed this powerful aura.

!!

Ye Xuan slowly descended, raised his left palm, and said with a cold expression, “I’m not going to play around anymore. My time is precious. It’s time to send you on your way.”

Then, he lowered his palm in a swift motion, and sharp swords condensed in the sky and started falling like rain toward Elder Taiyin.

At this moment, Ye Xuan seemed to have become an immortal whose every move commanded nature and the elements.

Elder Taiyin was so terrified that he even forgot to run away. The strange power in his body was also suppressed.

“Ah!”

“This can’t be happening!!”

Elder Taiyin was in disbelief. However, everything he was seeing was real and tangible. He felt helpless, and could not understand why Ye Xuan was so strong.

As the tens of thousands of swords rained down, he forcefully suppressed his panic and tried his best to withstand the attack.

However, could Ye Xuan’s attack really be blocked so easily?

Not even a quarter of an hour had passed, but Elder Taiyin’s body had already been turned into a sieve. If this continued, one would be hard-pressed to even find his ashes.

“Senior Brother Taiyin!”

Mo Xuan Guan shouted in panic.

If Elder Taiyin was killed, the destruction of the Immortal Divine sect would become an almost foregone conclusion.

He had to do something, so he erupted with a burst of power and forced the enemies around him to retreat. Then, he immediately tried to charge over to rescue Elder Taiyin.

However, Ao Lei was not to be messed with. With a single punch, he forced Mo Xuan Guan back, severely injuring him.

“Haha, there’s really no need for the Immortal Divine sect to continue existing anymore. All of you should just die!”

Shortly after, Elder Taiyin was truly turned into ashes. However, Ye Xuan did not make the same mistake. He flew over to whatever bits of the corpse remained, and scanned it with his spiritual sense.

The corners of his mouth slightly curved up, because he had noticed that the Elder Taiyin’s soul had not dissipated.

“Haha, you’re actually trying the same trick again?”

“Once bitten, twice shy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan unleashed an even more powerful attack that shattered Elder Taiyin’s soul.

Now, he had been truly erased from this world for good.

After dealing the finishing blow, Ye Xuan turned his attention to the Immortal Divine sect cultivators.

When Mo Gen saw that Elder Taiyin had been killed, he was furious.

“Damn it! Hand over your life as restitution!”

After a furious roar, Mo Gen shook off Yi Feng and charged at Ye Xuan with his saber.

Ye Xuan was not bothered by this, and simply caught Mo Gen’s saber with his elbow, then twisted his arm slightly, breaking the sword.

With the rainbow robe, even if Ye Xuan had stood still and allowed Mo Gen to attack him, he would have remained completely unharmed.

“Your sect will be consigned to the history books!”

After saying this, Ye Xuan punched Mo Gen, slamming him into the ground below and severely injuring him.

At this moment, Mo Gen could finally sense the huge gap between his combat power and Ye Xuan’s.

He was no longer bothered about fighting, and even ignored his own injuries, as he frantically tried to escape.

However, Yi Feng did not let it happen.

“I say, Mo Gen, where are you trying to run off to? Are you going to run all the way back to your sect?”

Yi Feng asked contemptuously.

Then, he continued, “Let me give you a piece of advice. Your sect is no longer safe.”

Hearing this, Mo Gen’s expression changed drastically. What did Yi Feng mean by this?

Could it be that when the reinforcements were dispatched from the sect, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had also dispatched another team to destroy their sect?

When he thought of this, Mo Gen’s face instantly turned pale.

This time, almost all of the disciples of the Immortal Divine sect had been mobilized, which meant that the sect was practically defenseless.

If the Great Wilderness Divine sect had truly attacked, it was probably doomed.

Yi Feng looked at Mo Gen’s disbelieving expression and said disdainfully, “You should be aware of how the Great Wilderness Divine sect does things.”

“We won’t bite if we’re not bitten first. However, once we bite, we will never let go.”

“Since your sect picked a fight, you all must pay the price.”

After hearing this, Mo Gen was already clearly aware that he was doomed. His entire body went limp.

The onlookers were also shocked. They even felt lucky that they had not provoked the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Heavens! The way they go about things is too ruthless and vicious…”
