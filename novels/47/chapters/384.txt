385 The System’s Hidden Function

Yuelun’s expression instantly changed.

‘Good Lord, she originally just wanted to get some benefits from Ye Xuan for her disciple, but she didn’t expect to almost lose her precious disciple.’

How could she possibly agree? Li Hanyi was the eldest disciple of her Water Sky peak and the only heir she had acknowledged.

‘This guy is really too hateful. He actually wants to steal my disciple.”

When she saw Li Hanyi’s expression, she suddenly felt that something was amiss.

“Cough, cough! The Seven Peaks competition is not far away. Hanyi, you should focus on your cultivation. Don’t go to Cloud Sky peak!”

When Li Hanyi heard this, she felt a little disappointed and said with a pout, “Yes, Teacher.”

Of course, although Li Hanyi envied Zhuge Yueyue, she would never betray her master.

After all, ever since she had joined Water Sky peak, Yuelun had been very kind to her and very meticulous in his teaching. Besides, Li Hanyi would never do something like that.

When Yuelun saw this, she could not help but heave a sigh of relief in her heart. Then, she glared fiercely at Ye Xuan.

“You’re quite ruthless. Remember this, you’re not allowed to have any thoughts about my Hanyi in the future!”

“Otherwise, I’ll fight you to the death!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled, but inwardly, he thought to himself.

‘You actually wanted to trick me. Now you know the consequences, hehe.’

Of course, Ye Xuan still looked innocent on the surface.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, what are you saying? I’m innocent! You were the one who suggested this!”

“Why would I snatch your disciple? Senior Sister Yuelun’s words make me very sad.”

“Hmph! I can’t be bothered with this. In any case, you can’t touch Hanyi!” Yuelun snorted.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan laughed inwardly.

‘I’ve never been afraid of anything, so why would I be afraid of your threat?’

His lips curled into a playful smile, and then he waved his sleeve.

A golden divine flower pendant suddenly appeared in his hand.

“Martial niece Hanyi, this is the first time we’ve met, and I don’t have any good magic artifacts with me. The only thing I have is this golden divine flower pendant. Take it as my gift to you.”

“This is a supreme-grade black-rank magic artifact. If you wear it, it will greatly aid your cultivation.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan felt a gaze that seemed to want to eat him alive.

Of course, this gaze belonged to Yuelun.

‘This guy is too much. He is blatantly tempting my disciple!’

Li Hanyi was stunned and took the golden divine flower pendant in a daze.

Instantly, she felt her ability to sense the surrounding spiritual energy increase sharply, and her cultivation speed increased as well.

Martial Uncle Ye Xuan was right. This golden divine flower pendant was indeed very helpful for cultivation.

“Thank you, Martial Uncle Ue Xuan!”

Li Hanyi bowed to Ye Xuan with a happy expression on her face.

Ye Xuan was simply too generous, casually giving her a black-rank magic artifact. As the rumors said, he was not stingy at all.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, what’s wrong with you? Are you feeling unwell?”

Ye Xuan snickered inwardly when he saw Yuelun’s pained expression. However, he pretended to be clueless.

Ye Xuan had to admit that although Tian Xuan did not impart much knowledge to him in that short hundred-year period, the treasures he left behind were still of some use.

A golden divine flower pendant had almost earned him a new disciple.

The increase in cultivation speed was of no use to Ye Xuan at all. It was just a useful trinket at best. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Yuelun saw this, she glared at Ye Xuan fiercely before turning around and leaving in anger.

After receiving the gift, Li Hanyi was overjoyed. However, when she saw her teacher’s angry figure leaving, she looked at Ye Xuan with embarrassment.

“Martial Uncle Ye Xuan, I’m really sorry. I’ll go with Master first. In the future, I’ll definitely visit Cloud Sky peak to ask for advice!”

“Sure! The doors of Cloud Sky peak will always be open to Martial Niece,” Ye Xuan smiled and said.

Li Hanyi then bade farewell to Ye Xuan and quickly caught up with Yuelun.

However, at this moment, a mechanical voice rang out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a supreme-grade black-rank golden divine flower pendant, the host has received a randomized 100x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the innate divine jade!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows, his eyes full of questions.

“Ding! This is a new function developed after the system upgrade. Li Hanyi is also a disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. The sect that the host is currently bound to is also the Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

“Ding! All of the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect can trigger the system’s reward activation!”

“Ding! A warm reminder: After the system upgrade, there are many hidden functions. If the host meets the conditions, they will be activated automatically!”

Hearing the system’s explanation, Ye Xuan wanted to laugh out loud.

He had no idea that there would be so many benefits after upgrading the system. Did this not mean that he could poach some of the other chiefs’ disciples?

The most important thing was that regardless of whether he was successful in poaching them, he could obtain the system’s rewards through them. This was a very profitable enterprise.

Of course, Ye Xuan’s character in taking in disciples had always been the same. Only those with excellent character were qualified to be his disciple.

After all, if he accidentally accepted an ungrateful person, would it not bring him endless trouble in the future?
