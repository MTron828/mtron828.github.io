Chapter 118: Absolute Devotion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Even if Ye Xuan stood still, no matter how casually Ah Yue and Li Qingyan attacked, he could not break through the defense of his body.

“I’ll make another breakthrough in the future. Judging from the time, the mystic realm of the Moon demon should have opened!”

Then, Ye Xuan left the cultivation room and flew over the sect leader’s residence. There, Wan Shanhai informed him that the Moon Demon mystic realm had actually already appeared, though its entrance had yet to open.

The Moon Demon mystic realm’s entrance varied with each opening, and the location of each entrance was random.

The only thing they knew was that one entrance to the Moon Demon mystic realm would appear in the Great Qian Dynasty.

Furthermore, according to rumors, the Moon Demon mystic realm’s entrances were not only spread across the Nanzhou region, but even appeared in other places throughout the Tian Yuan continent.

Five days ago, the entrances from the Great Qian Dynasty’s side had been located, and the one closest to the Qingyun sect was located in Jiangping Province.

At this moment, whether it was cultivators training in the outside world or in secluded cultivation, they all stopped what they were doing and went to the entrance of the Moon Demon mystic realm, hoping to obtain a great harvest.

Ye Xuan called Yue and Li Qingyan over.

“Qingyan! I haven’t given you a mount yet!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the bird-shaped mark on Ye Xuan’s forehead suddenly lit up, and then a huge bird emitting a powerful aura suddenly appeared!

Blazing plume, a Tier 5 demon beast. Its cultivation was comparable to that of a human Xudan realm cultivator.

Ye Xuan had been so focused on improving his own cultivation that he almost forgot to give his mount to Li Qingyan! Also, it had been a month since Yue had gotten the Firebird, so he could give one to her as well! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What a beautiful bird!”

Seeing this, Li Qingyan’s eyes lit up, and her face was full of surprise and joy.

The blazing plume hovered in the air. Its fiery-red feathers fluttered in the wind as it flapped its wings, and its eyes were filled with bright light.

Moments later, Ye Xuan reached out and gently tapped Li Qingyan’s forehead. Then, he helped her form a contract with the blazing plume.

Li Qingyan suddenly felt an inexplicable connection with the blazing plume, and she felt a lot closer to it.

“Thank you, Teacher!” Li Qingyan said sweetly.

In the future, even if her teacher could not accompany her, she could still ride the blazing plume as her mode of transportation.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a low-grade blazing plume (Tier 5) demon beast, the host has received a randomized 46x critical reward. Congratulations, the host has obtained a mid-grade firewing (Tier 5) demon beast!”

At the same time, in the system’s storage space, a Tier 5 demon beast, whose strength was comparable to a human true core realm cultivator, suddenly appeared.

The firewing’s body was covered in surging flames. Other than its eyes, which were golden, the rest of its body was a fiery red color.

“Yue, the firebird is a little low-level after all. I’ll give you another higher-level mount!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan reached out to break the contract between Yue and the firebird.

Screech!

The firebird roared into the sky and suddenly appeared in front of Yue. Its large head rubbed gently against Yue’s cheek. Then it came over and rubbed its head against Ye Xuan with a face full of reluctance.

“If you want to, then you can stay at my Lingjiu peak to oversee things,” Ye Xuan said while looking at the firebird.

After all, the firebird was once his mount. Although it did not match his current strength, Ye Xuan was not a heartless person.

Screech!

The firebird let out a long howl at the sky as if it was happy to hear Ye Xuan’s answer. Then, it flapped its wings and flew in the air. It circled around Lingjiu peak before slowly landing.

As a cultivator could only have one demon beast mount at any given time, so if Ye Xuan wanted to give Yue a higher-level mount, he had to break the contract between her and the firebird.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple a mid-grade firewing (Tier 5) demon beast, the host has received a randomized 40x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained a high-grade flaming pinion (Tier 5) demon beast!”

As the system’s notification rang out, Ye Xuan’s mount changed again. It was replaced with a high-grade Tier 5 flaming pinion, which was as strong as a human golden core realm cultivator.

The feathers of the flaming pinion glowed green and blue. When its wings flapped, it emitted green flames.

Although the flaming pinion was not of much help to Ye Xuan, he could give it to Li Qingyan or Yue in the future, and it would also help to ensure his disciples’ safety.

Although he had already given the two girls jade tokens, the terrifying power contained in the jade tokens was a precious trump card. Moreover, it was a consumable item, so they could not afford to use it as they pleased.

As for the blazing plume and the firewing, they were equivalent to Xudan realm and true core realm cultivators respectively. As long as they did not encounter a particularly powerful enemy, they would be able to deal with most enemies.

This would be helpful in the Moon Demon mystic realm, where they would be separated upon entrance randomly to different parts of the mystic realm.

If the two girls were in danger, even Ye Xuan might not be able to reach them in time. However, now that they had powerful mounts and his jade tokens, he felt much more at ease.

“Alright, it’s time for us to head to Jiangping Province!”

Just now, Yue and Li Qingyan’s gazes had been fixed on Ye Xuan. Their hearts were filled with curiosity toward their teacher.

Why did it feel like their teacher’s resources were inexhaustible? Such high-level demon beasts and pills were given to them randomly.

When they compared him with the other disciples’ teachers, they found that at most, those disciples would be given ordinary mounts that had barely reached the qi transformation realm

Although they were his disciples, they realized that their teacher remained a mystery to them. He was young and extremely powerful, and did not seem to lack cultivation resources.

In addition, he cared for them very much. Could there really be such a perfect person in this world?

It could be said that they were not only grateful to Ye Xuan, but also absolutely worshiped him.
