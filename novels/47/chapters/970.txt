Feng Xiyun’s cultivation was fire-type. After all, her body contained one of the hottest flames in the world, the Heaven Burning Flames.

“l wonder if there will be other powerful descendants of ancient divine beasts appearing later. This is really too exciting,” Feng Xiyun said to herself. She had the attitude of an excited audience member waiting for the show to start.

Zhuge Yueyue rolled her eyes at her.

‘This little girl, how could she be so happy? Didn’t she know that her first sister was under a lot of pressure right now?’

Just as Zhuge Yue Yue was wondering if she should show herself and fight, a bold voice was heard from afar. It was a young man in a white robe slowly descending from the sky. Then, he stood steadily on a parasol leaf.

His eyes were filled with disdain, and if one looked carefully, one would realize that he was a peak-level supreme realm expert.

After his arrival, the atmosphere became more solemn.

“Who is this person?”

Zhuge Yueyue was very confused when she saw this person. Although she could sense that this person was very strong, she had never heard of him before.

A moment later, someone exclaimed in shock, “Oh my god! Could this kid be the top genius from the Immortal Divine sect who broke their sect’s ancient path record nine times, Gongsun Zhi?”

“Oh my god! He actually came?”

At this moment, everyone’s faces were filled with surprise.

The ancient path of the Immortal Divine sect was known as a purgatory by many genius disciples, as it had claimed the life of many geniuses.

Those who were able to survive the ancient path were all powerful and talented. Gongsun Zhi had already passed it nine times, which could be considered a miracle.

At this moment, the arrogant golden tiger became cautious.

“Gongsun Zhi, I really didn’t expect you to come to this place.”

The golden tiger felt immense pressure at this moment. If it was just dealing with the fiery phoenix, he still had a certain degree of confidence. However, if Gongsun Zhi was added to the equation, things would become much more complicated.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Gongsun Zhi waved the fan in his hand and took a steo forward in a graceful

manner. Then, he said, “Golden Tiger, if you’re here, why can’t I be here?”

When the golden tiger heard this, he instantly burned with anger. His pride did not allow him to lower his head in front of others. However, he was not only facing Gongsun Zhi at the moment, but he was also diverting a part of his attention to the fiery phoenix, in case it suddenly attacked him.

The atmosphere at the scene froze again. The golden tiger originally thought that Gongsun Zhi would join forces with the fiery phoenix to deal with him, but unexpectedly, Gongsun Zhi didn’t seem to be interested in dealing with him at all.

Gongsun Zhi shifted his gaze to the crowd. After scanning the crowd, he said,

“Golden Tiger, I’m not in the mood to deal with you.”

“l heard that there was a talented genius disciple in the East continent’s Great

Wilderness Divine sect who has great attainments in the Sword Dao. I would like to ask her for advice.’

After saying this, dense killing intent manifested in Gongsun Zhi’s eyes. Although it was only a flash, it was seen by the sharp Feng Xiyun.

Feng Xiyun furrowed her brows tightly as she said, “First Sister, if I’m not wrong, this person is here to deal with you.”

Zhuge Yueyue had obviously noticed this as well. Coupled with what her teacher had mentioned to her before, she instantly understood what was going on.

Previously, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had destroyed the Immortal Divine sect in the East continent, so this guy was here to take revenge.

The enmity between the two forces could no longer be resolved amicably. They would have to fight until one side was defeated and destroyed.

Zhuge Yueyue was not in a hurry to reveal herself. Instead, she was thinking calmly in her heart.

Previously, when they had just entered the treasury, her master had mentioned to her that he would go out to search for the other members of the

Great Wilderness Divine sect.

However, it had already been a few days. Why was there still no news?

Zhuge Yueyue started to worry at this moment. Could it be that the Immortal Divine sect had really attacked the Great Wilderness Divine sect?

After making this judgment, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Gongsun Zhi’s indifferent expression again, who clearly seemed to know what was going on.

Her expression turned cold.

Dense killing intent gradually emerged from her body. If the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were really attacked by the Immortal Divine sect, she would definitely make them pay with blood.

The easiest target for her now was Gongsun Zhi.

In the sky, Gongsun Zhi was becoming impatient as he had received noresponse to his words.

His expression was cold as he continued, “Hehe, could it be that all the disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect are hiding and don’t even dare to respond?”

“How dare you!’

After hearing this, a disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven continent immediately glared at him and scolded him.

He held a sharp saber in his hand and looked at Gongsun Zhi fiercely as he said, “Is the reputation of our Great Wilderness Divine sect something you are allowed to insult? Let me spar with you then!”

Seeing this young man who had suddenly appeared, everyone was dumbfounded.

At this moment, people understood very well that Gongsun Zhi wanted to deal with the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the East continent, but why did someone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven Continent suddenly stand up instead?

However, after thinking about it carefully, people felt that this was quite normal. After all, Gongsun Zhi had just mentioned the Great Wilderness Divine sect without adding their place of origin, and had thus insulted both sects.

Looking at the young man in front of him, Gongsun Zhi said indifferently with disdain, “You? Hahaha, with your strength, don’t come out and embarrass yourself, okay? Do you think you have the right to face me?”

Seeing Gongsun Zhi’s arrogant attitude and insulting words, the disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect of the Heaven Continent seemed to have suffered a heavy blow and instantly became furious..
