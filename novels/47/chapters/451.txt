At this moment, Ye Xuan slowly stood up.

“Senior Brother Gongsun, Cloud Sky peak’s matches are over for the day. If there’s nothing important, I’ll take these two girls back first.”

“Go!” Gongsun Shouyue shook his head helplessly, and then waved his hand.

Ye Xuan bade farewell to Gongsun Shouyue and Elder Tongtian and left the Great Wilderness peak with his disciples and Su Changhe.

They would return for the second day of the competition. Ye Xuan felt that there was no need for him to stay and watch the other matches.

However, he was overjoyed by what had happened today, especially after seeing Gao Shun fainting from anger.

Not only had Gao Shun failed to humiliate Ye Xuan, but he even managed to humiliate himself by fainting.

“Teacher, do you think that Martial Uncle Gao will die from his anger?”

After leaving the first arena, Feng Xiyun playfully asked a question.

“What kind of joke is this? Your Martial Uncle Gao’s face is as thick as an iron wall, how could he die from anger?” Ye Xuan replied in all seriousness.

“Pfft!” Feng Xiyun could not help but laugh.

“Hahaha! Chief Ye Xuan, you might not have noticed, but when Yu Wuyuan was kicked off the arena by Sister Yueyue, the disciples of Hidden Sword peak looked as if they had just eaten sh*t!”

“When I recall their arrogant faces before the competition started, I can barely stop myself from laughing. This is definitely the most painful wake-up call ever!”

Su Changhe laughed gloatingly.

Ye Xuan smiled. This kid was quite likable.

Although this kid’s character was not very good in the past, he was indeed very loyal. Even though he knew that Hidden Sword peak was powerful, he still supported Cloud Sky peak.

“Uh...” When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, she frowned coldly.

Eaten sh*t?

Su Changhe was the eldest young master of the Su family. How could he speak such vulgar words?

However, Su Changhe was used to Zhuge Yueyue’s personality and did not take it to heart.

“Alright! There are only two matches for us a day, so since your matches are over, you can decide what to do with the remaining time. You can stay and watch the battles between the cultivators from the other peaks, or you can return to Cloud Sky peak to rest.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan flicked his sleeves and turned into a streak of light, heading back to Cloud Sky peak.

Ye Xuan had no interest in watching children play around.

Instead of wasting time here, he might as well return to Cloud Sky peak to rest and consolidate his cultivation foundation. There was still a fair bit of time until the seal on the ancient tomb he had discovered in the archaic divine mountain would open.

Until that time, he would focus on solidifying his cultivation foundation and getting stronger.

After Ye Xuan left, Su Changhe looked at Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue with a flattering smile.

“I’m going to take a walk around and won’t bother you two.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Su Changhe turned around and strode toward the second arena.

When he was observing the cultivators just now, he realized that most of the beautiful women were cultivators from Water Sky peak, and that they were gathered there.

Su Changhe had been holding back earlier. After all, Ye Xuan was present, so he could not be too brazen. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Now that Ye Xuan had left, who could stop him from looking at the beauties?

“Why does this guy look so excited? Could it be that he’s going to do something bad?” Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue could not help but frown.

Feng Xiyun nodded in agreement, “I also feel that this guy must be up to something.”

The two of them looked at each other and quickly reached an agreement. Then, they headed to the second arena as well, and soon found the female cultivators of Water Sky peak, who were having their matches here.

“Yueyue, why are you guys here? Wasn’t Cloud Sky peak having matches at the first arena?”

Li Xue’er walked over excitedly when she saw Zhuge Yueyue.

When she saw her best friend, a smile finally appeared on Zhuge Yueyue’s frosty face.

“Xue’er, we’ve already finished our competition. Since we have nothing to do, we thought of coming over to visit you!”

“Good, good! I’ll bring you around now!”

Li Xue’er didn’t think too much about it and hugged Zhuge Yueyue excitedly.

Then, with Li Xue’er leading them, Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue soon arrived at where her fellow disciples were gathered.

Further away, Su Changhe, who was squeezing om with countless muscular men, saw this scene and shed tears of envy.

It was a blessing to get in through connections, as they could get the best seats in an instant.

He had almost been suffocated trying to squeeze his way in.

The lowly Su Changhe could only stand on his tiptoes and watch the beautiful girls from afar.

At the same time, Yuelun also noticed Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue’s arrival.

Immediately, her eyes brightened as she scanned the crowd. After discovering that Ye Xuan had not come, she became disappointed.

“Greetings, Martial Aunt Yuelun!” Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue bowed respectfully.

Yuelun nodded with a smile. “Why don’t I see your teacher?”

“After our matches ended, Teacher went back.”

“I see...” Yuelun muttered.
