839 Do You Need My Help?

Once the shadowy figure entered the East continent, its true form was revealed.

A golden-furred growler that was ten thousand feet tall!

Seeing this, even Ye Xuan felt a little nervous, as this golden-furred growler truly looked terrifying.

However, after thinking about it carefully, it was only natural that the golden-furred growler would grow to this size after cultivating for such a long time.

The moment this golden-furred growler appeared, a beam of golden divine light descended.

It was the sealing power of this world!

After seeing this, Ye Xuan inwardly rejoiced, and a smile appeared on his face.

His guess was not wrong at all. If someone from the outside world dared to enter, no matter how powerful they were, they would be suppressed to the sealed immortal realm.

However, the strength of their bodies remained at the eternal realm, so they possessed terrifying defensive capabilities.

Even so, Ye Xuan still had many ways to deal with him.

At this moment, Yanran discovered the situation, and nervously sent a voice transmission to Ye Xuan.

“Ye Xuan, can you deal with him? Do you need me to call for backup?”

She knew that Ye Xuan was very powerful, and might not need her help, so she decided to ask before acting.

At this moment, Ye Xuan smiled calmly, and then waved his hand in a certain direction.

His voice transmission came soon after.

“There’s no need for that. Just watch how your husband handles him.”

Hearing this, Yanran’s face instantly turned red as she replied shyly, “You’re always like this. Wait for me for a while, I’ll rush over immediately.”

Even though she knew that Ye Xuan was deliberately teasing her, Yanran still felt a little happy.

“Don’t worry! You don’t need to make the trip. I can easily take care of this guy.”

Hearing these confident words, Yanran’s heart trembled briefly. In the end, she decided not to rush over to the East continent. She would trust her boyfriend.

However, she was also very curious as to how powerful he had become during the time they had been apart. Thus, she observed the situation closely through the bronze mirror.

If anything went awry, she would rush over immediately.

“Alright, I got it.”

After sending this message, Yanran did not continue. After all, she did not want to put a damper on his fighting spirit.

After chatting with Yanran for a while, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at the huge golden-furred growler. He took out the Godsword and pointed it at the creature.

On the other hand, the moment the little golden-furred growler saw that his ancestor had appeared, his eyes instantly filled with tears as he went over to kneel and greet his ancestor.

“Greetings, Ancestor!”

The huge golden-furred growler looked at the little golden-furred growler who had been beaten up very miserably, and his heart was filled with killing intent.

Their race did not have many descendants, and it was only due to his strength, which served as a deterrent in preventing others from exterminating their race.

“Rise,” the ancestor said before turning to look in Ye Xuan’s direction.

Ye Xuan had just killed one of his descendants, and now that he had come here, he had to deal with this b*stard properly.

“You damned fool! Today, I will teach you to respect the authority of a higher-being!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he released his monstrous pressure, which caused Ye Xuan to stagger backwards briefly.

However, at this moment, rays of golden light instantly appeared from his body, and even a dragon’s roar could be heard.

“F*ck!”

After sensing the dragon’s aura, the golden-furred growler ancestor trembled, and looked around frantically.

In the sky, it seemed that a terrifying divine dragon had appeared and was staring at him with a cold gaze.The dragon bloodline could be said to be the leader of all races, and would cause a great sense of oppression to other beasts.

“It’s actually the dragon race’s divine runes!”

The golden-furred growler ancestor never expected to see something so rare from Ye Xuan. At this moment, Ye Xuan stood up unhurriedly. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he began to laugh loudly.

“Hahaha!”

“From today onward, I will let everyone know that even if they have a mortal body, they can destroy an eternal body!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What do you mean?”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s impudent laughter, everyone’s hearts trembled violently.

Could it be that Ye Xuan was just putting on an act to lure the golden-furred growler ancestor in to kill him?

At this moment, everyone was completely dumbfounded. They could not process what was going on. This was a Heavenly Dao World expert. Where did Ye Xuan find the guts to do this?

After hearing Ye Xuan’s loud laughter, the golden-furred growler ancestor stared coldly at Ye Xuan. Although he was somewhat confused about the situation, he could tell that he was being looked down upon.
