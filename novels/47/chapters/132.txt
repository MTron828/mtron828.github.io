Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Hearing this, the monk slowly turned the Buddhist beads in his hand. He suddenly paused for a moment and revealed a smiling expression.

“Almsgiver, you really know how to joke. These Buddhist beads are our Buddhist sect…”

“Then you must be joking too!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ye Xuan interrupted the monk with a cold smile. Then, he put the Buddha Spirit fruitinto his storage ring and turned to leave.

“Almsgiver, don’t be in a hurry to leave!”

Seeing this, the monk’s eyes narrowed.

However, Ye Xuan acted as if he did not hear those words. He could not be bothered to argue with this monk.

“Alas! Almsgiver, you are too stubborn. It’s better for this penniless monk to teach you a lesson!”

The monk sighed. The Buddhist light around his body immediately swept out. Then he reached out his hand, and a resplendent giant hand suddenly appeared and tried to grab Ye Xuan.

Whoosh!

At this moment, tyrannical sword qi burst forth and destroyed the giant hand.

“Huh?”

Seeing this, the monk revealed a surprised expression. However, he did not stop. He stretched out his fist and slowly released a dazzling golden light. Suddenly, his figure turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

Moments later, the monk’s figure suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan. His right fist exuded dazzling golden light as it smashed toward Ye Xuan.

“You’re really courting death!”

Ye Xuan’s gaze turned completely cold.

His longsword released a dazzling sword qi, and slashed toward the golden fist.

Boom!

The two terrifying forces collided violently.

The monk’s expression suddenly changed. He revealed a painful expression and hurriedly retreated.

The fist that was originally emitting dazzling golden light now had a wound so deep that one could see the bones underneath. However, the wound soon disappeared without leaving even a trace of a scar.

“I can’t believe that the almsgiver has actually reached the unity realm!”

The monk’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan. His eyes were filled with surprise.

He had hidden himself earlier and watched Ye Xuan kill that peak core formation realm expert.

According to the monk’s spiritual sense, Ye Xuan was at most a half-step unity realm expert.

It was also because of this that the monk had unscrupulously decided to ask for the Buddha Spirit fruit.

“Almsgiver, are you really unwilling to part with the Buddha Spirit fruit?”

After discovering Ye Xuan’s cultivation realm, the monk’s eyes turned solemn.

“You can have it if you want. This Buddha Spirit fruit can be exchanged with your Buddhist beads!” Ye Xuan replied as he sneered.

In all honesty, even if the monk was really willing to exchange his Buddhist beads with the Buddha Spirit fruit, Ye Xuan would no longer agree to such a trade. The time for pleasantries was long past.

“The heavens are benevolent, but also cruel. It’s a pity that almsgiver is too weak. In that case, let this penniless monk take the place of Buddha and educate you well!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the monk’s body suddenly surged with golden light.

In addition, a huge golden phantom suddenly appeared around his body. Unsurprisingly, it was in the form of Buddha.

“Vajra Demon Subjugation body!”

The monk roared. His body was suffused with terrifying golden light as he charged toward Ye Xuan.

“Vajra Demon Subjugation? Ridiculous!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan sneered.

This monk was just a hypocrite who used Buddhism to justify his greedy behavior.

Ye Xuan’s longsword exuded domineering sword qi, and struck the monk with the force of thunder.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

As the two people fought, heaven and earth trembled as violent shockwaves swept out, wreaking havoc in the surroundings.

Although the monk’s Vajra Demon Subjugation body was extremely powerful, it was easily dealt with by Ye Xuan. Moreover, Ye Xuan was able to precisely counter his attacks with the same amount of power.

As time passed, the monk’s expression gradually became unsightly.

He did not expect this guy to be so strong. Which super sect’s genius was he? Why did he not recognize him?

Even though he was using the Vajra Demon Subjugation body, many wounds continued to appear on his body.

However, the vitality of a unity realm super expert healed those wounds in an instant.

After all, unity realm experts were also known as immortals because the divine element in their bodies contained incomparably powerful vitality. Even if his head was chopped off, it could be quickly restored and reconnected.

Therefore, once a cultivator entered the unity realm, it was very difficult for them to die.

Even when unity realm experts fought each other, deaths were very rare.

“Diamond Palm!”

The monk roared, and the power in his body swept out.

Although he could not kill this guy, if he took advantage of the other party’s carelessness with a sudden burst of power, would it not be enough to break the finger with the storage ring?

As for killing Ye Xuan, the monk did not bother with such a troublesome task.

Boom!

Mysterious Buddhist light appeared around the monk’s body, and his defensive power increased rapidly.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan squinted his eyes.

He had not noticed it before. The monk’s kasaya was a powerful defensive artifact. It was no wonder the monk had chosen to fight bare-handed!

The monk’s defensive power had now increased three-fold!

Still, so what? The monk might have used his full strength earlier, but neither had Ye Xuan.

It was a rare opportunity for him to fight another unity realm expert, so he had been very curious as to what sort of surprises he would encounter during the fight.

Even so, he was annoyed by this monk.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The monk’s palm was as bright as gold. As he waved his fist, space trembled endlessly. A flurry of golden fists smashed toward Ye Xuan.

Boom!

Ye Xuan moved and instantly dodged the monk’s golden fist barrage.

The barrage landed on the mountain, leveling it!
