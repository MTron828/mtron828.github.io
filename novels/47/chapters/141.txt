Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The leader of the Mad Saber sect once again concealed his own energy fluctuations. He used his spiritual sense to probe for a bit, and then his body turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Not long after Ye Xuan and the others left, many cultivators arrived at the battlefield.

They had basically all come from the sword intent stone wall. The blood-red sword qi that Ye Xuan had released earlier had shocked them.

Even though they were dozens of kilometers away, they could still sense his terrifying sword intent.

Therefore, they did not dare to come over until the battle was completely over.

Of course, they also wanted to try their luck and see if there were any traces of his sword intent that could be used to comprehend.

Not long after, they discovered the terrifying ravine that was hundreds of meters deep. A tyrannical sword qi ravaged the ravine.

Immediately, everyone sat down cross-legged.

“As expected! There’s still some remnants of that expert’s sword intent!”

“The level of his sword intent has actually surpassed the sword intent on the stone wall!”

Everyone cried out in excitement. Among them, the sword cultivators were the most excited.

In the deepest part of the ravine, there was an extremely violent and tyrannical sword qi. Although its aura was extremely weak, it did exist.

“From today onwards, the Moon Demon mystic realm will have another place for us to comprehend sword intent!”

Many cultivators exclaimed with faces full of emotion.

In the Moon Demon mystic realm, the sword intent stone wall was a relatively well-known place to comprehend sword intent. It was a place that countless sword cultivators yearned for. If they could comprehend sword intent under the stone wall for a day.. it would be equivalent to half a year of painstaking cultivation in the outside world.

However, from today onward, other than the sword intent stone wall, there was another place in the mystic realm where one could comprehend sword intent. Moreover, the sword intent here was even more terrifying!

When the cultivators who had stayed back at the sword intent stone wall heard the news, they ran over excitedly.

Some cultivators with outstanding talent in the path of the sword used the sword intent left behind by Ye Xuan to actually comprehend the embryonic form of their own sword intent.

Ye Xuan heard about this, but it did not faze him.

Although he had left behind his sword intent in the ravine, whether one could comprehend it depended solely on the cultivator’s talent and comprehension value.

Then, Ye Xuan brought Huang Ling around the mystic realm to search for heavenly treasures.

However, it was clear that his luck was not very good, as he failed to find anything good.

After this situation continued for a while. Ye Xuan simply could not be bothered to look for opportunities. He instead chose to bring Huang Ling over to a place of opportunity.

Fist intent stone pillar!

As the name implied, there were the remnant traces of a cultivator’s fist intent on the stone pillar. It was exactly the same as the sword intent stone wall.

By the time Ye Xuan brought Huang Ling over to the fist intent stone pillar, an extremely large number of cultivators had already gathered under the stone pillar, and most of these cultivators were fist cultivators.

Of course, there were also some cultivators who came to try their luck and see if they could comprehend fist intent!

Apart from true essence realm and purple spirit realm cultivators, there were also many top-tier core formation realm cultivators.

As soon as Ye Xuan arrived, he immediately attracted the attention of many cultivators.

Although he concealed his aura, flying itself was representative of the core formation realm!

“It’s Ye Xuan!”

Some of them were cultivators from the Great Qian Dynasty. When they spotted Ye Xuan, they were excited.

When Ye Xuan arrived at the bottom of the stone pillar, he observed the fist marks on the stone pillar. There was indeed a strong intent contained within those marks.

Although he was not a fist cultivator, intents were connected through Great Dao, so he was able to benefit from this comprehension as well.

Ye Xuan sat cross-legged and carefully comprehended the fist intent contained within the marks on the stone pillar!

Seeing this, everyone started focusing as well.

What Ye Xuan cultivated was swordsmanship. He had never dabbled in fist techniques or even come into contact with them!

To be able to comprehend different intents would be of great benefit to him. If he could integrate these intents, his strength would increase tremendously.

Intents belonged to one of the laws of Heaven and Earth, and were connected to the Great Dao.

Once a cultivator comprehended a particular intent, it meant that he had grasped the power of the Great Dao to a certain extent. At the same time, he could also borrow the power of the intent to improve his own strength!

In other words, a cultivator borrowed the power of the laws of Heaven and Earth to fight.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s comprehension value, which had surpassed 500 points, immediately displayed its worth.

When his spiritual sense examined the fist intent marks on the stone pillar, the mysterious power symbolizing to fist intent slowly manifested within his mind.

Huang Ling, who was seated next to him, also tried to comprehend the fist intent in the stone pillar!

However, after observing it for more than half a day, Huang Ling still had a dumbfounded look on her face. She felt that she did not know where to start. It was as if there was a wall blocking her from comprehending anything.

Helpless, Huang Ling could only choose to give up. Then, she took out a healing pill to treat her injuries.

As time slowly passed, some cultivators who had never dabbled in Fist techniques also withdrew from the group. There were also some cultivators with outstanding talent who gained some insights.

At a certain moment, an extremely mysterious power suddenly rippled out from the center of the stone pillar, and then slowly swept out toward the surroundings.

“This is?”

Everyone was instantly startled by this.

“These energy fluctuations… it’s fist intent… someone actually used this to comprehend the embryonic form of their own fist intent…”

“Who was it?”

Everyone looked toward the source of this mysterious power, and their gazes fell on Ye Xuan at the same time.

“It’s him!”

Seeing this, everyone was shocked. How long had this guy even been here? How could he comprehend the embryonic form of his own fist intent within such a short time?

Many of them had gained insights into fist intent after studying the stone pillar for several days. However, although they had made some breakthroughs, they were still a distance away from comprehending their own embryonic form of fist intent.

Even those fist cultivators with extraordinary talent were still stuck at the threshold prior to comprehending the embryonic form of fist intent.

“Ye Xuan?”

“From what I know, this guy is a sword cultivator, right?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“F*ck! A sword cultivator actually comprehended the embryonic form of his own fist intent within such a short period of time. Is this for real?”

“This guy’s talent is too monstrous…”

“As expected of Ye Xuan!”

The cultivators from the Great Qian Dynasty were shocked when they saw this.

However, when they recalled Ye Xuan’s deeds, they were no longer so surprised!
