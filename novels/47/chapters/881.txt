882 Ancient Palace

Many forces in the eight continents began to make preparations. An opportunity like this was rare. If the leaders inof the Great Wilderness Divine sect failed to stabilize the situation, it would definitely have a huge impact on the entire sect.

Chaos would reign, and there might even be infighting and internal strife. Many people might even stake their own claims on Ao Lei’s old position. After all, everyone craved power and influence. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As such, aside from those who made preparations to act, there were many more watching and waiting.

However, to their surprise, nothing seemed to have changed at the Great Wilderness Divine sect. There were no signs of chaos or infighting.

Furthermore, no one had been announced as a replacement for Ao Lei.

Over the course of the next few days, there were no movements detected from the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

What was going on?

Unable to figure out what was going on, many of the forces dispatched cultivators to Sky Mountain to investigate the situation and ask around.

Once those cultivators arrived, they realized that there was nothing going on here either. The lives of the people were actually orderly, and there was not a single trace of chaos.

This situation persisted for thirty or so days. Finally, one day, a huge explosion was heard.

From the vast East Sea, a furry monkey suddenly flew up, stirring up countless waves. This furry monkey was holding a golden-gilded staff, which could change its size at will.

Within moments, the furry monkey had stirred the waters of the East continent like one would do with soup. Then, a divine aura suddenly emerged from the depths of the East Sea.

The furry monkey had someone undone the seal and caused a certain palace to reveal itself to the world. This caused an uproar in the eight continents, who could all sense how extraordinary this ancient palace was.

In the distant depths of the starry sky, a pair of blood-red eyes suddenly opened. They were filled with greed. Without hesitation, that existence rushed toward the East Sea without delay, and many other existences followed suit.

They could sense that this ancient palace contained an opportunity for them to become immortals.

After the ancient palace appeared, the situation immediately became tumultuous, and many factions took action immediately.

“Haha, the first battle is about to begin.”

On a certain mountain peak, Ou Yunhai’s eyes were filled with a bloodthirsty aura. Ever since he was defeated by Ye Xuan, he had been focused on cultivating in seclusion and never stopped, quietly waiting for an opportunity to come.

“Ye Xuan, just you wait. I’ll teach you the consequences of offending me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ou Yunhai released a terrifying aura. With a raise of his hand, he turned a distant mountain into ashes. The Saint of the Heavenly Wind Divine sect seemed to have broken through to the sealed immortal realm.

How did he succeed?

Perhaps all of this was due to the force behind him. The Heavenly Wind Divine sect was also a powerful force with a long history. It had a sturdy foundation and was stronger than the Great Wilderness Divine sect. Furthermore, they were also backed by their predecessors in the Heavenly Dao World.

As the disciple with the most potential, Ou Yunhai was heavily nurtured, and given the best guidance and resources.

His face was filled with defiance as he looked toward the east, muttering, “An ancient palace has appeared. Is this a coincidence, or is it heaven’s will?”

“Ye Xuan, I’ll definitely kill you this time!”

The current situation was very strange, and the appearance of the ancient palace might be a sign as well as an opportunity. There were bound to be many treasures inside, and many ancient realm experts who were reaching the end of their lifespans had all emerged from seclusion to go there.

The chaos caused by the little monkey had dragged all of the eight continents into it. However, at this moment, the atmosphere in the East continent was very strange.

After learning about this information, Elder Tongtian flew into a rage and smashed the table in front of him.

“Damn it! Why would this ancient palace suddenly appear at such a critical moment?”

“Are the heavens trying to force our East continent into a desperate situation?”

Elder Tongtian had also heard the news of Ao Lei’s passing which saddened him. With the Great Wilderness Divine sect in its current state, and the appearance of the ancient palace, things were not looking good for the East continent.

After all, the Great Wilderness Divine sect was the strongest force in the East continent, and one of the few which had the capability of competing with the forces of the other continents.

It would likely take a number of years for them to recover from Ao Lei’s death, which would put the East continent at a disadvantage, as they would be unable to help the other forces of the East continent.

Elder Tongtian had originally wanted to bide his time as he got stronger, but the appearance of this ancient palace threw a spanner in the works.

Damn that stupid monkey!
