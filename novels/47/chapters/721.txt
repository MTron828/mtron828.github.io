722 Secluded Cultivation (Part 1)

A new hammer technique!

Thank you readers!

Xiang Yun could not contain her excitement.

“You know that I will never lie to you, so you have to be good,” Ye Xuan said, and then turned his gaze to Feng Xiyun.

“Xiyun, during the time I’m in secluded cultivation, you have to assist Yueyue with the operational matters of Cloud Sky peak.”

“This is your senior sister’s first time managing Cloud Sky peak, and she has no prior experience. But you’re different. You come from the royal family, so you have more knowledge regarding these matters.”

“So when she encounters something she doesn’t know, try your best to teach her.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun agreed without hesitation and said, “Alright, I understand. Teacher, you don’t have to worry about these things.”

Ye Xuan felt gratified to hear her reassuring words.

Cloud Sky peak had always been relatively leisurely. There was usually nothing urgent to deal with. Therefore, Zhuge Yueyue would not feel too much pressure if she had to manage it.

The only thing he needed to worry about was the meeting of the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If Zhuge Yueyue had to attend those, her nerves might get the better of her.

Moreover, it would not be long before the sect’s recruitment period began, which was one of the most important sect events.

As the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan was supposed to attend the event. However, it seemed that she would have to take his place instead.

Even though Ye Xuan was a little worried, she would have to face and experience these things sooner or later. It was a good thing for her to experience it now.

“Alright.”

After giving out instructions, Ye Xuan immediately instructed, “”Yueyue, you must remember what I said.”

“During the days when I’m away, there’s no need to do anything special. You have to take good care of your third sister and remember not to let her cause trouble.”

“If you encounter other important matters that you can’t handle, then wait for me to exit secluded cultivation to deal with them.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head. She was already starting to get nervous.

In the past, because her teacher was always around, no matter what kind of thing it was, it would be handled by her teacher. She did not need to worry at all.

However, it was different now. As the head disciple it was only natural for her to take the lead when Ye Xuan was not around.

“Teacher, don’t worry. I will do my best to handle this matter well. I will also take good care of Second and Third Sister,” she said without hesitation.

Now that she had given her word, she would do her best to make it happen.

Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly. He believed that she would be able to do well. His only worry was Xiang Yun, whose temperament was unlikely to change overnight. What kind of troubles would she get herself into while he was away?

Even Ye Xuan himself could not be sure.

Sometimes, she really did not want to get into trouble, but when she could not control her emotions, the power in her body naturally surged out, which caused her to lose control. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At that time, Li Yi said that she was a wild child without parents, and that it was her that caused the death of her parents.

As such, Xiang Yun went berserk and gave Li Yi a good beating.

She did not want anyone to know about this, so she deliberately made up a different excuse when asked about.

After Ye Xuan found out about this, he felt extremely guilty.

Usually, he only cared about teaching them cultivation and techniques and did not care about what they were feeling.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan noticed this in time and helped her resolve the problem in her heart. Otherwise, it was like burying a time bomb that would explode sooner or later.

“Sigh…”

Seeing Xiang Yun’s happy smile, Ye Xuan could not help but sigh.

In fact, what Li Yi said was not without reason.

This was because Xiang Yun was the reincarnation of an expert. His parents were ordinary people, so how could they resist her fate energy?

However, these things had long passed, and it was useless to think about them now.

Ye Xuan looked at the three disciples again and said, “I’ve already said what I needed to say. My final reminder is that you should all cultivate diligently and don’t be lazy.

“After I finish my secluded cultivation, I’ll take a good look at your cultivation levels one by one.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan left toward the rear of Cloud Sky peak.

“Teacher, we wish you success…”

Zhuge Yueyue and the other two said as they watched Ye Xuan’s figure disappear into the distance. Only when they could no longer see him did they turn around and leave.

At this moment, Ye Xuan had already arrived at the Cloud Sky Cave, and nostalgia filled his heart.

The Cloud Sky Cave was also the cave abode that his teacher, Tian Xuan, often stayed in.

Tian Xuan was very passionate about cultivation, so he basically stayed in this cave abode to cultivate all the time, day and night.

Ten years had passed since his teacher’s death…

“To honor his memory, I’ll cultivate here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan first looked around before blocking the entrance of the Cloud Sky Cave in order to avoid being disturbed by others. Then he set up a formation around it. After all the work was done, Ye Xuan walked further into the Cloud Sky Cave…
