Chapter 89: Fairies Descending Upon The Mortal World

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, the moment Yue and Li Qingyan appeared, the cultivators of the Huolie and Shenshan sects were stunned.

How could there be such fairies in the human world?!

Heck, even the cultivators of the Qingyun sect were stunned by their beauty.

Yue did not say much. Ever since she awakened her Jade Sword physique, she became as beautiful as a fairy from a painting.

Her face was like chiseled jade, her lips were as red as cherries, and her eyes were like stars twinkling in the night sky. She was like a fairy who was untainted by the secular world!

What surprised the cultivators of the Qingyun sect’s cultivators was Li Qingyan. Although Li Qingyan’s appearance had been extremely outstanding, she was still not as beautiful as Yue.

However, today, everyone felt differently. Li Qingyan was like an untainted, blooming lotus flower. She was extremely beautiful and her eyes shone brightly!

Now, whether it was in terms of temperament or appearance, the two were almost at the same level!

The two women stood out, and seemingly emitted a blinding light that made the entire world pale in comparison!

They were fairies in the mortal world, dressed in green and white, that could topple kingdoms and nations!

The reason why everyone had such a reaction was also very simple.

Li Qingyan had been the same as Yue from before. After Ye Xuan helped her awaken her special physique, her body underwent earth-shaking changes.

Moreover, because of her dual-spirit physique, she possessed the warmth of fire and the beauty of life at the same time. It could be said that she was the perfect fusion of two completely different temperaments.

It was also because of this that everyone’s gaze could not help but fall on Li Qingyan.

Moreover, in their hearts, the two women were like high and mighty fairies that could only be admired from afar.

Compared to the two women, the rest of the female cultivators were like weeds. They lowered their heads in shame.

The two women walked slowly together. When they saw everyone’s gazes, their expressions did not change, but they exuded a cold and aloof aura. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

To outsiders, they would not be as intimate and obedient as they were with Ye Xuan.

“Oh my God, they are too beautiful!”

“Are they the legendary fairies that descended to the mortal world? These two fairies, seeing that I am so handsome, why don’t you come and visit me?”

“I thought that the cultivators of the Qingyun sect were deceiving me…”

“If the beauty part is true, then won’t their cultivation levels be as powerful as the cultivators of the Qingyun sect described?”

“What kind of genius would be able to match such beautiful fairies?”

“In the entire Great Qian Dynasty, I’m afraid that only Elder Ye Xuan can do it!”

“Your words make sense, but Elder Ye Xuan is their teacher. How can master and disciple be together? Let me bear that cross. I’ll make them happy!”

“The teacher is monstrous, but his disciples are monstrous too. How can the world be this unfair?”

“In that case, aren’t we going to lose?”

“What nonsense are you spounting? They might be extremely beautiful, but they may not be powerful. Don’t throw our morale down the drain before the competition even starts, okay?”

At this moment, everyone was heatedly discussing the beauty of these two women.

When the eyes of the elders of the Huolie and Shenshan sects fell on Yue and Li Qingyan, they were shocked.

They were old men who had cultivated for decades. They had seen all kinds of people, but they had never seen such stunning women. They possessed extraordinary temperament, like fairies that had descended to the mortal world. Almost no one aside from themselves compared with them.

“Are these the disciples that Ye Xuan took in?”

“They are indeed stunning!”

“Wait, with my cultivation, why can’t I sense their cultivation levels? This is too strange…”

“When did the Qingyun sect have such a high-level aura concealment technique?”

Seeing this, the elders of the two sects were surprised.

As core formation realm cultivators, they could not even sense the cultivation levels of these two personal disciples!

All of the top sects had secret techniques to restrain their auras, which were similar to the qi storage technique. However, this secret technique was not particularly high-level, so it was difficult to block the spiritual senses of core formation realm cultivators.

Normally, given their strength, they would easily be able to sense the cultivation levels of Yue and Li Qingyan!

“Ahem, I’m not too sure either. It must have been specially taught to them by Elder Ye Xuan!”

Seeing this, Wan Shanhai also had some doubts in his heart.

Although this matter was a little strange, when he thought of Ye Xuan, he felt relieved.

What was so strange about what a monster had done?

When everyone thought that he had been deeply poisoned, and had half a foot in the grave, he suddenly appeared full of vigor, and his strength had made a huge breakthrough, in just a few days.

When everyone thought that he had just randomly found a disciple to inherit his legacy, the other party had awakened an extremely rare sword physique. Moreover, within an extremely short period of time, she had advanced from the refinement realm to the sixth level of the true essence realm.

When everyone thought that Ye Xuan’s strength was only at the early stage of the true core realm, he had become a sparring partner for his disciples. Moreover, he had displayed his sword intent for the cultivators of the entire Qingyun sect to see. It was precisely because of this that Wan Shanhai had been able to comprehend his own sword intent.

When everyone thought that it was impossible for him to become an alchemist, he inexplicably became a third-rank alchemist. Moreover, he could easily refine a perfect soul-returning pill.

When everyone recalled his astounding feats, they felt a little dazed. They inexplicably felt that their paradigm shifted whenever he was involved.

Therefore, was this not just a secret technique that could fully conceal one’s aura? Was it not just a little more advanced? What was there to be surprised about? It was all normal, okay?

“Elder Ye Xuan?”

Seeing this, the elders of the two sects squinted their eyes and then fell into a state of deep thought.

Although they did not know what had happened to Ye Xuan, he was still the strongest genius of the Great Qian Dynasty. Although he was inferior to them in terms of experience, his strength had reached the same level as them.

Moreover, it was quite normal for such a monstrous talent to possess a high-level secret technique to conceal his aura.

However, this also meant that Yue and Li Qingyan’s strength was still a mystery.

After all, if even the elders could sense their cultivation levels, how could the personal disciples do so?

According to the information gathered, Yue was only at the sixth level of the true essence realm ten days ago, and Li Qingyan was only at the ninth level of the true essence realm.

In just half a month’s time, these two girls should not have made any further breakthroughs, right?

They should have…

The sect leader and the elders of the Qingyun sect immediately showed a guilty expression when they thought of this.

After all, these two girls were Ye Xuan’s disciples.

He was no normal person, okay?

However, even if their cultivation levels had increased, it should not have increased by a ridiculous amount, right?
