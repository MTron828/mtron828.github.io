Chapter 83: I Can Call You Dad

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s fine too!”

Ye Xuan did not object.

He had just obtained the memories, knowledge and experience of a third-rank alchemist from the system, so his hands were itching to give it a go.

Seeing this, Situ Yufei smiled.

Although he had failed to refine the soul-returning pill, and was in a bad mood, it would be a comforting thing to watch Ye Xuan embarrass himself while refining the pill.

Soon, Situ Yufei and Ye Xuan arrived at the pill refining room.

Situ Yufei waved his sleeve, and a brand new pill furnace suddenly appeared in the pill refining room. Then, he took out the related medicinal herbs related to the qi gathering pill.

After doing all this, Situ Yufei stood silently by the side and signaled for Ye Xuan to start refining the pill with his eyes.

Ye Xuan smiled, and then the fire-attribute power in his body gushed out and poured into the pill furnace.

The pill furnace was immediately set alight.

Then, Ye Xuan waved his hand, and the medicinal herbs next to him slowly fell into the pill furnace. At the same time, the wood-attribute power in his body slowly spread out, fueling the flames and refining the essence of the medicinal herbs.

Situ Yufei, who was next to him, saw this scene play out and could not help but stare. He was petrified, and his jaw almost fell to the floor in shock.

“Fire and wood dual attributes, this… how did you do it?” Situ Yufei’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Did Ye Xuan not have fire and wood attributes in his dantian? When did he cultivate this? Did this guy encounter some sort of heaven-defying opportunity again?

Thinking this, Situ Yufei’s heart was filled with envy.

However, what shocked him the most was not the dual attributes of fire and wood, but the skillful way in which Ye Xuan refined the medicinal pill.

Was this guy still an unqualified alchemist? His precision in controlling the temperature of the flame and the method he used to refine the medicinal herbs was clearly something that only an experienced alchemist could do.

Even he could not perfectly remove the impurities of the medicinal herbs like this, let alone accurately control the temperature of the flame at all times.

Although he did not want to admit it, the truth was right before his eyes. Ye Xuan’s attainments in the field of alchemy had already surpassed his! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This guy was a monster!

Situ Yufei did not know how to describe Ye Xuan. It was as if 10,000 horses were galloping through the field that was his heart.

Moreover, when he thought about his previous suggestion, he felt even more depressed.

He originally wanted to see this fellow make a fool of himself, but he did not expect that the clown was actually him.

Very quickly, under the shocked gaze of Situ Yufei, the qi gathering pill was perfectly formed. The medicinal pill had three lines on it!

The medicinal pill had three lines. It could be said to be a perfect grade medicinal pill.

“Three-line qi gathering pill!”

Situ Yufei looked at the qi gathering pill that was gradually revealing itself on the pill furnace, and his body could not help but tremble.

Although this was only the most basic first-grade pill, even a third-rank alchemist would not be able to refine a perfect first-grade pill.

Oh my God, this monster!

“Elder Situ, about the soul-returning pill…”

At this moment, Ye Xuan looked at Situ Yufei with a smile.

“Refine, you have to refine it!”

Before Ye Xuan could finish speaking, Situ Yufei very quickly took out all the ingredients to refine the soul-returning pill.

Then, Ye Xuan repeated the process. As the flames slowly rose, all of the impurities in the medicinal materials were removed!

Not long after, the medicinal materials of different attributes slowly began to merge.

“Oh my God, his technique is too perfect!”

Situ Yufei stared at Ye Xuan’s alchemy technique fixedly. He was afraid that he would miss any details!

At this moment, he was completely immersed in the refining process.

It was only when the pill furnace slowly emitted wisps of medicinal fragrance that Situ Yufei came back to his senses.

“F*ck… It’s also a three-line soul-returning pill!”

“This is too incredible!”

Situ Yufei picked up the soul-returning pill. Looking at the three lines on the pill, his hand could not help but tremble.

He had tried to refine this pill five times, but he had never succeeded.

Now, Ye Xuan had refined the perfect soul-returning pill without even breaking a sweat.

“You are a monster!”

Situ Yufei looked at Ye Xuan, who had a calm expression on his face, completely stunned.

How could there be such a monster in the world? Not only did his martial talent suppress the prodigies of this era, he was now also a monster when it came to alchemy.

Why was the world so unfair?

“Ye Xuan… Oh, no, Brother Ye, why don’t you teach me how to refine pills in the future?”

Situ Yufei looked at Ye Xuan with a fawning expression.

His view of Ye Xuan had completely changed. Not only was this guy a cultivation monster, but he was also a top-notch alchemist worthy of his respect.

How long had this guy been studying alchemy? He could refine a perfect soul-returning pill. He was practically born for alchemy!

Situ Yufei’s expression was as if he was looking at his first love, so Ye Xuan could not help but shiver and quickly took a few steps back.

“Ahem… Let’s talk about this later!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve and turned into a ray of light, flying toward Lingjiu peak.

“Brother Ye, don’t go!”

“If you’re not satisfied, I can call you dad too!”

Situ Yufei immediately became anxious. He hurriedly shouted in the direction that Ye Xuan had left, but the latter ignored him and flew off even faster.

After some time, Situ Yufei finally recovered from his excitement.

Although Ye Xuan did not promise to teach him how to refine pills, he had already gained quite a bit of knowledge from watching Ye Xuan refine pills just now.

If he tried to refine the soul-returning pill again, he would definitely have a better chance at success.

“A master is indeed a master. His mastery of the refining technique is simply unbelievable! I must review it carefully!”

Immediately, Situ Yufei shut himself off and focused on reviewing what he had learnt.

Only after Situ Yufei finished reviewing and memorizing it all did the sect leader and the other elders learn that Ye Xuan could refine a perfect soul-returning pill!

“What?”

“How did this guy do it? This is too monstrous!”

“I somehow get the feeling that this guy is omnipotent. What’s going on?”

“Three-line soul-returning pill. This is a perfect pill!”

The soul-returning pill that Ye Xuan had refined earlier was immediately treated as a treasure by the sect leader and the elders. They all stared at it intently, their eyes filled with shock.

“Hahaha, no matter what, our Qingyun sect now has a master alchemist!”

Although everyone wanted to see Ye Xuan make a fool of himself, when they thought about the fact that the sect now had a master alchemist, their hearts were filled with joy, as this would definitely increase the overall strength of the sect.
