596 The Reappearance Of The Strange Power (Part 3)

At that very moment, Mo Nan looked like a lunatic, his eyes glowing red.

“The higher one’s cultivation level, the more powerful the strange power absorbed by this method will be.”

“I didn’t want to use this trump card so early. After all, I haven’t finished absorbing all of the blood and strange power.”

After saying this, Mo Nan’s gaze toward Ye Xuan bristled with killing intent. It was all his fault!

“If it wasn’t for you, how could I have revealed my trump card so early?”

“However, it’s fine. I’ll absorb all of your blood too to create my demonic body!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Nan immediately launched an attack. A large fist imprint filled with the strange power was sent flying toward Ye Xuan. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, the surroundings began to shake, and spatial cracks began to appear in the sky.

Ye Xuan did not choose to take the attack head-on. Instead, he activated his fiery phoenix divine power and dodged the attack. At the same time, he swung his sword at Mo Nan.

Mo Nan roared, and a white skull covered in black mist appeared.

The white skull flew directly toward Ye Xuan’s sword beam, opened its mouth wide, and bit down on it!

Boom!

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. They felt a pressure that came from deep within their souls.

After absorbing that strange power, Mo Nan’s combat strength had truly improved by leaps and bounds.

Even Ao Lei and Yi Feng could feel the pressure.

Although they were all very nervous at this time, their eyes had not left the battle in the sky.

The battle between the Great Wilderness Divine sect and the Immortal Divine sect was no longer something they could influence. It all hinged upon the outcome of the battle in the sky.

If Ye Xuan won, then the Great Wilderness Divine sect would naturally triumph. However, if he was defeated, it would probably mean the end of their sect as well.

At this moment, everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect was praying silently in their hearts, hoping that Ye Xuan would win.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were also clutching each others’ hands tightly as they stared at the battle.

Their teacher was in a deathmatch to decide their fate and the fate of their sect.

After Mo Nan dealt with Ye Xuan’s sword beam, he did not stop and immediately launched another attack.

“Brat, die!”

He unleashed one attack after another, not wanting to give Ye Xuan a moment’s rest.

This had always been his way of doing things. He would pursue victory and would never give his enemy the chance to turn the tables.

After dozens of exchanges, Ye Xuan quickly found an opportunity to forcefully neutralize Mo Nan’s punch.

Upon the collision between their fists, Ye Xuan’s right hand felt numb.

After casually shaking his right hand, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly, looking very excited.

“Hehe, not bad. So this is what your demonic body looks like?”

Although Ye Xuan had been constantly dodging just now, he was not afraid. He had been searching for Mo Nan’s flaws, and he also wanted to see what was so extraordinary about his demonic body.

Ye Xuan had already figured it out, which was why he was so excited.

Mo Nan’s demonic body was indeed very powerful, and he could even be considered the strongest enemy that Ye Xuan had ever encountered.

After noticing that Ye Xuan was smiling for no reason, Mo Nan felt that something was not right.

“What are you laughing about, brat?”

“Hehe, I’m just laughing at you for deceiving yourself.”

“Ignorant brat!”

Mo Nan was enraged, but Ye Xuan did not panic at all and continued languidly, “Do you really think that I can’t defeat you just because you’ve cultivated that demonic body and have been strengthened by that strange power? Do you really think you’re invincible?”

“What do you mean?”

“Old man, if my teacher could suppress you back then, I can do it too!”

“In any case, you can confess your crimes and sins to the king of hell. You’ve spent far too long in the land of the living!”

After that, Ye Xuan rushed into the sky. The lightning bolts from the formation could not hurt or hinder him at all.

Ye Xuan had changed into his rainbow robes. Like a god descending upon the world, he dispersed the black mist that was condensing in the sky.

At this moment, the spectators on the ground were all extremely shocked.

“Don’t tell me…”

Ao Lei had already noticed that Ye Xuan’s clothes were extraordinary.

He had another trump card!

At this moment, everyone discovered that Ye Xuan had not used his full strength yet.

Otherwise, why would Ye Xuan keep dodging Mo Nan’s attacks? Even if he just stood there and allowed Mo Nan to hit him, wearing those clothes, he would still be unharmed.

Mo Nan was dazed when he saw this.

“This … This can’t be true!”

“Why does he have such a powerful defensive treasure?!”

“Hehe, don’t you know that seeing is believing? Old man, how do you want to die? I can grant you your wish!”

Without waiting for Mo Nan to reply, Ye Xuan swung the Godsword and once again dispersed the black mist.

In the blink of an eye, the Godsword emitted a shocking red light.

...

The Godsword originated from ancient times. The killing intent it emitted made people feel like they were walking past the gates of hell.

Everyone unconsciously held their breaths and looked at Ye Xuan.

Moments later, he started to emit immortal energy, and rays of divine light were released, instantly dispersing more of the surrounding black mist.
