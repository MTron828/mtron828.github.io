514 The Chaotic Situation

“Martial Uncle Gao, will you be busy with something else?”

Li Hanyi asked in confusion.

Hearing that, Gao Shun said very firmly, “”I’ll enter the tomb as well.”

After that, Gao Shun plunged into the entrance of the ancient tomb.

!!

At this time, an intense battle was taking place inside the ancient tomb.

A few cultivators were already fighting for a single divine fruit.

“Damn it, Old Chu, Old Tongtian, first come, first served. I saw it first! Are you really going to snatch it from me?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Taiyin released a fierce attack, forcing Chu Batian and Elder Tongtian to retreat.

“Hehe, don’t joke around,” Elder Tongtian burst into laughter and said, “This divine fruit belongs to whoever is fated with it. Seeing it first means nothing, so don’t be ridiculous.”

After hearing Elder Tongtian’s ridiculing, Elder Taiyin’s face turned red with both embarrassment and fury.

Everyone’s attention was drawn to the divine fruit that was shining brightly on the tree.

Even though the divine fruit was not an immortal-grade fruit, it had been around for tens of thousands of years and it contained a massive amount of life force. It was a treasure that everyone was in desperate need of.

“Elder Taiyin, have your injuries recovered from your bout with Ye Xuan earlier?”

“You’re fighting both of us now, you know. Could it be that you are so confident in yourself?”

“Damn it! Trying to scare me off? Keep on dreaming!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a fierce battle broke out again, stirring up a storm in the ancient tomb.

The entrance to the ancient tomb had only just opened, and with the loss of its defensive seal, more and more treasures were gradually revealed.

At that moment, a treasured saber slowly appeared in the sky. One of the cultivators saw it and rushed over as fast as he could, trying to put it into his storage bag.

In another direction, a group of people near the blood sea discovered the existence of a blood bodhi.

At this moment, the hunt for treasures in the ancient tomb was in full swing. More and more cultivators poured into the ancient tomb, and most of the strong experts had rushed over.

Battles broke out everywhere, but it was the battle involving Elder Taiyin that was the fiercest and made the largest commotion.

While the fight was still going on, a woman with a graceful figure arrived at the blood-red sea.

“This is the power of a domain?”

Yuelun had just arrived, but had already sensed the power of this domain.

It was obvious that the domain she was in was for mystic lord realm experts.

She then noticed the three old men who were engaged in an intense battle not far away. Their target was the divine fruit.

However, after thinking for a moment, Yuelun did not choose to join in. After all, with her strength, she was not a match for those three.

The most important thing now was to find Ye Xuan first. If she had the luck, she would encounter other treasures.

However, just because she did not provoke others did not mean that others wouldn’t provoke her.

The three old men who were still fighting stopped their attacks at the same time when they noticed the arrival of other cultivators.

When they saw that it was Yuelun, Elder Tongtian said, “I was wondering who it was. It turned out to be Fellow Daoist Yuelun. It’s fine as long as it’s not one of Elder Taiyin’s helpers.”

“Damn it! Great Wilderness Divine sect!”

Elder Taiyin’s face had already turned black. He stared at Yuelun coldly, his eyes filled with hatred. Had it not been for Ye Xuan, how could he be in such a passive position now?

Yuelun had also sensed Elder Taiyin’s evil intentions by now. Her expression turned serious, but at the same time, she was filled with doubt.

“Why is this old thing looking at me with such killing intent? Could it be that I’ve offended him before?”

Even though she was filled with doubts, Yuelun kept her guard up.

At the same time, she turned to Elder Tongtian and asked, “Fellow Daoist Tongtian, may I ask if you’ve heard any news about Ye Xuan in this ancient tomb?”

Hearing this, Elder Tongtian and Chu Tianba exchanged a look, then waved their hands and replied, “No, we haven’t.”

“We entered the tomb when it was just opened. There were too many people then, so we have no idea where he went.”

“The only thing I can tell you is that when we arrived here, we discovered the bloody carcass of a shark in the sea.”

“If we’re not wrong, that shark was most likely killed by Ye Xuan.”

After hearing this, Yuelun pondered this matter for a moment. Her gaze swept across the blood-red sea, but she was disappointed when she failed to find anything.

“Haha, you’re asking about Ye Xuan? If I’m not wrong, there’s a great chance that he’s already dead!”

At this moment, Elder Taiyin continued to speak in a cold voice, “He was the first person to enter this tomb. It’s been a few days, yet no one has seen him. I’m sure that he’s already dead.”

Hearing this, Yuelun’s brows furrowed. She now had a rough idea why this old man was directing such strong killing intent towards her. Ye Xuan and this old man probably had a feud.

However, knowing this also made her feel bitter. Seeing the strength of this old man, she could tell that the gap between her and Ye Xuan was getting larger and larger.

Ye Xuan’s strength had improved too quickly.

If it really came down to that, could she and Ye Xuan actually maintain a relationship?

The more she thought about it, the more confused she became. Then she turned her gaze to Elder Taiyin…
