840 World Slash

Did this fellow think that those dragon race divine runes would be enough to deal with him? All it did was suppress his bloodline, not his strength.

Did he have something else up his sleeve?

“Interesting. You actually dared to plot against me…”

Despite realizing that he had been tricked, the golden-furred growler ancestor smiled, his face still calm.

This clone’s combat strength was only 10% of his main body’s, but he was confident that he could deal with Ye Xuan.

“Come at me then. Show me what you can do,” the golden-furred growler ancestor said nonchalantly. He still had an arrogant expression on his face.

However, at this moment, a sharp sword that emitted a dense bloody aura instantly rushed into the sky. Ye Xuan also raised his head at this moment, smiling.

“I’m telling the truth, you know. In my world, I’m an invincible existence!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan also rushed into the sky. The sharp sword turned into a giant sword beam, which shocked the golden-furred growler ancestor. This sword beat was powerful enough to pose a threat to him!

He had already forgotten how long it had been since he felt threatened.

This move was a move that Ye Xuan had created after comprehending the Flora Sword technique, the Heaven-Splitter technique, the Fiery Phoenix technique, and various other techniques.

Other than his ultimate move, One World, this was the most powerful move that Ye Xuan could unleash now. He named this move World Slash!

It could only ignore the restrictions of space, time, and other powers, and was almost flawless. Ye Xuan wanted to teach this move to Zhuge Yueyue to obtain a reward from the system.

Thus, he felt that he could use this opportunity to make this move famous. Perhaps the reward he received from the system might be even better.

The moment he used World Slash, the sword beam seemed to tear the world apart, as everything around him began to fade.

“Oh my god, what is this move?”

“Even the world seems like it’s about to be torn asunder by it!”

“Is that really something a human can achieve?”

At this moment, a huge commotion occurred in all eight continents among those who were watching the battle.

Even Yanran was shocked. Her boyfriend seemed to have become even more heaven-defying since she last saw him. Despite the fact that she was blessed with countless heavenly treasures as the sect’s Saintess, his speed of improvement had surpassed hers.

Furthermore, his comprehension of the Sword Dao was simply unparalleled!

“Sigh… You rogue, can’t you let me surpass you for a while?”

If Ye Xuan knew about this matter, he would probably laugh his heart out.

He would never expect Yanran to be so fixated on the titles of junior and senior.

At this moment, a huge explosion erupted, and lightning instantly flashed in the sky. After sensing the power of this sword beam, the golden-furred growler ancestor felt fear sprout from within the depths of his heart.

How could a mere sealed immortal realm expert display such power?

Moreover, he could sense that there were profound insights imbued into this attack, so much so that even he might not be able to comprehend them. Was this a self-created move?

At this moment, it would be a lie to say that he was not afraid.

“This can’t be happening!”

“How can you comprehend such a powerful sword move?”

The golden-furred growler ancestor uttered these words in disbelief.

“Haha!”

Ye Xuan laughed out loud as he held the Godsword aloft.

“The world is so big,” he said, “and it’s filled with too many things that you can’t imagine. You’re just a frog at the bottom of a well.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Prepare to feel my wrath! I will be the first to kill a true immortal!”

Ye Xuan felt his blood surging with excitement at the prospect of fighting a strong enemy. If he really managed to slay this golden-furred growler expert, he would earn bragging rights for a lifetime!

The golden-furred growler ancestor’s expression turned cold as he said fiercely, “Damn it! You’re too arrogant!”

He released rays of golden divine light, which exuded terrifying energy fluctuations.
