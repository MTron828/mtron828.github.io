865 Chaos Sacred Body

“With the help of the Heaven Burning Flames, even the power of my Stellar sword technique has increased by quite a bit.”

“If I were to fight that golden-furred growler ancestor again, I would easily cut him into pieces.”

Now, challenging higher level people would be a piece of cake. Even true immortals from the Heavenly Dao World would have to step aside in his presence!

“Life and death…”

At this moment, Ye Xuan was already pondering over the fourth move of the Stellar sword technique that he had just accidentally comprehended. After a brief examination, his heart beat excitedly.

“Whoa, this fourth move is so strong…”

“This is really awesome! I obtained another great harvest today.”

With this many immortal-grade cultivation techniques, his combat strength had increased several fold, and each of them augmented his strength in a complementary manner.

Furthermore, this was not the end. He had just helped Feng Xiyun complete her cultivation technique, so he was looking forward to the system’s reward.

What would he receive?

As Ye Xuan waited, a system notification actually popped out. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has completed his disciple’s cultivation technique and obtained a critical reward!”

Yes! It worked!

Ye Xuan was ecstatic.

Here it came…

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has received a 4x critical reward and strike feedback and obtained 4 opportunities to complete cultivation techniques!”

Ugh! It was only a fourfold reward, but it was better than nothing. It seemed that it was a little difficult to get a high critical multiplier on rare rewards like this one. Perhaps the system had made adjustments due to how powerful these completed cultivation techniques were.

In any case, he had obtained these 4 chances thanks to a loophole, so he was satisfied. If he pushed too hard, the system might fix the loophole, and he would lose a valuable channel to obtain this rare reward.

Then, golden light surged into Ye Xuan’s body, signifying that he had truly obtained these four chances. He then pondered on which cultivation techniques to use these chances on, as well as if he could exploit the loophole by using it on his disciples’ incomplete cultivation techniques, or incomplete cultivation techniques that he could teach them.

After all, it would not be good to waste the chance to obtain more.

However, just as Ye Xuan’s imagination was running wild, a new system notification popped up.

“Ding! The system has discovered that the host has used a loophole to obtain benefits. Because this was a system error, the system will not pursue the matter further. However, the host is reminded that the same loophole will not work again.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was speechless. However, in this case, the system was quite good, as it did not confiscate his rewards. Perhaps it was all for the best.

At this moment, a series of system notifications rang out.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host’s actions have helped his disciple complete the transformation of a divine bone to an immortal bone. The host has received a critical reward!”

“Ding! Congratulations! As the host has increased the upper limit of his disciple’s talent, the host has received a critical reward!”

Oooh!

More rewards!

This time, he had really hit the jackpot!

Ye Xuan was filled with anticipation as he muttered to himself, occasionally laughing. Seeing this scene, Elder Qian Yi became flustered, and did not dare to look at Ye Xuan for fear of seeing something he should not see.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained a 10,000x critical reward. The host’s strength has been improved.”

A vigorous force instantly manifested and was injected into Ye Xuan’s body. His three Dao Flowers were constantly swaying, and somehow appeared even more mysterious.

Then, another system notification rang out.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host’s body’s potential has increased greatly, and has transformed into a Chaos Sacred Body!]
