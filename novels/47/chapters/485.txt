486 The Might Of The Second Move

Although Situ Mo’s words made sense, Ye Xuan did not want to wait any longer.

The heaven devouring divine sparrow’s strength had reached the supreme realm, and it was just right for him to test his strength on.

Ever since he had obtained the Flora sword technique, Ye Xuan had never used its second move.

The heaven devouring divine sparrow and Pixiu were undoubtedly excellent test subjects!

!!

“Don’t worry, I’m just using them to test the power of my sword technique!”

“If the situation doesn’t look favorable, I can easily retreat.”

Ye Xuan smiled, his face full of confidence. Then, he took a step forward and turned into a streak of light, flying into the sky.

“Ye…”

The Reincarnation Fairy wanted to stop him, but in the end, could not.

Seeing this, Situ Mo sighed. He could only pray that Ye Xuan would return safely.

At this very moment, everyone was paying close attention to this earth-shattering battle in the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains.

Both beasts had ancient bloodlines flowing through their bodies, and were supreme realm existences. Every time they struck out, the mountains would tremble and the ground would crack.

As everyone watched, entranced, they suddenly saw a white streak of light suddenly appear in the center of the battlefield.

“Who is that guy? He actually dared to barge into the battle between two supreme realm beasts! Has he lost his mind?”

“My god! Someone actually dared to interfere? Isn’t this just courting death?”

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock as they stared blankly at the white figure that had appeared in the sky.

Ye Xuan hovered in the air with an indifferent gaze. His entire being seemed to have become a divine sword that soared into the sky, filled with terrifying sword intent.

As the sea of fire rushed toward him, everyone saw Ye Xuan’s face clearly.

Some of the more well-informed ones immediately let out cries of surprise.

“Oh my god, isn’t that the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan? Why is he here?”

“What? Ye Xuan? Is that the person who killed the ape beast back then?”

“That’s right, that person was indeed Chief Ye Xuan, but why is he here?”

“From the looks of it, he’s thinking of challenging these two beasts, right? Isn’t he being a little too arrogant?”

The crowd immediately broke out into a heated discussion.

Some experts admired Ye Xuan’s courage, while others felt that he was too arrogant.

“Ye Xuan!”

At the same time, on the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains, Li Siyuan saw Ye Xuan appear in the sky, and a crazed killing intent appeared in the depths of his eyes.

He had never forgotten the humiliation Ye Xuan had inflicted upon him in Qingyang City.

It was also that experience that had caused his Dao heart to collapse. Fortunately, the elder of the Immortal Divine sect had personally helped him, otherwise his cultivation level would have fallen as well.

“Hmph! You’re actually trying to fight against a supreme realm heaven devouring divine sparrow by yourself? You’re really courting death!” Li Siyuan said, his eyes cold.

Now, all eyes were on Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan hovered in the air, but he did not choose to attack immediately. Instead, he put two fingers and condensed sword qi from his fingers.

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s eyes turned slightly as he looked at the huge bird in the sky that was engulfed in a sea of fire.

Then, his extremely powerful sword qi soared into the sky. In an instant, the surrounding sea of fire and lightning was parted, and a huge sword appeared in the sky.

At the same time, the heaven devouring divine sparrow seemed to sense danger and immediately let out an uneasy cry.

This was the second sword move of the Flora sword technique!

It could shatter the heavens and destroy the earth!

This was the first time Ye Xuan was using it since he started cultivating the technique. His eyes were filled with excitement.

This sword qi controlled the power of life and death!

In that instant, all of the flowers and plants across the entire archaic divine mountains instantly quivered, and an extremely profound sword qi surged into the huge sword. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

There were no fancy moves, only extreme power.

“That’s really unbelievable! What kind of sword technique is this?”

“My god! Such a profound sword technique! Is that really something a human created?”

When everyone saw this scene, they were dumbfounded and filled with shock.

“Wait… Could this be a legendary divine technique that has surpassed the power of laws?”

“I didn’t expect Ye Xuan’s attainment in the sword Dap to have reached such a level. It’s really unimaginable!”

At this moment, the sword that hung in the sky finally finished condensing.

In that instant, an invisible force suddenly rippled out and enveloped the surroundings within a special domain.

An indescribable killing intent suddenly erupted in the area that was filled with a sea of fire and lightning, as if it was going to devour everything. It caused everyone to feel heart palpitating fear.

At the same time, Li Siyuan’s complexion became extremely unsightly the moment he sensed this terrifying aura. A nearby tree had been snapped in half by his fist, and his elderly face gradually turned savage.

“How is this possible? How could he have cultivated such a high level sword technique?” Li Siyuan was on the verge of going crazy.

Su Changkong, who was beside him, said calmly when he saw this.

“Actually, there’s nothing strange about this. Senior Brother, don’t forget that the sword strike that Ye Xuan used in Qingyang City wasn’t as powerful as this one, but it contained the same aura!”

“Ye Xuan’s attainments in the Sword Dao have probably reached the pinnacle.”

...

“And I’ve warned you before not to offend this man. If it wasn’t for Senior Brother’s impulsiveness, the relationship between our Immortal Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sect would not have declined to this level.”

“That mistake has already been made, so I hope that Senior Brother won’t make the same mistake again!”

Su Changkong’s words were not only a reminder, but also a warning.
