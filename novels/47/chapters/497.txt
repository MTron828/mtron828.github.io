498 Two Fingers

Seeing this, Elder Taiyin’s expression turned grave.

The flowers, plants, and trees around the archaic divine mountains suddenly started glowing.

What grade was this sword technique?

The seemingly weak and fragile plants and trees suddenly became extremely sharp, as if they had transformed into swords.

!!

Then, a scene suddenly appeared in his mind, shocking him.

He saw an earth-shattering divine sword slicing through the sky and destroying everything in the river of time!

In this domain filled with sword qi, Ye Xuan was the absolute master, able to control the fate of thousands of living beings.

In that instant, waves of sword qi and astral winds suddenly filled the surroundings, as if they were going to devour everything.

When Elder Taiyin saw this in his mind, he was dumbfounded.

“No… I must be hallucinating… This guy must have deliberately created an illusion…”

Then, a cold smile appeared on the corners of his mouth, and divine light flashed across his eyes as he stared at Ye Xuan.

“I’ll admit that you’re quite strong… But if you think you can defeat me with these puny schemes, then you’re dreaming a fool’s dream!”

Immediately, Elder Taiyin looked at the plant-like swords that were spreading in front of him. The Immortal Sword shone with dazzling light, and then a crescent-shaped sword qi swept out, turning the plant-like swords to dust.

“Oh?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows and looked at Elder Taiyin with a faint smile.

After that probing attack, Elder Taiyin did not say anything more. The Immortal Sword continued erupting with sharp sword qi that swept toward Ye Xuan. He was using the Immortal sword technique of the sect, which was so powerful that even space trembled.

Compared to that, Ye Xuan’s actions were rather puzzling, as kept dodging, but did not counterattack.

The fight continued for some time as the mountains and forests around them were reduced to dust, creating craters and ravines.

Everyone’s expressions were tense.

“Oh my god, aren’t these two people too terrifying?”

“Is this the true power of peak-level mystic lord realm experts?”

“They are moving too fast. I can’t keep up at all.”

Some of the cultivators who wanted to take the opportunity to learn were on the verge of a mental breakdown. It was rare to witness a battle between experts of this level, but finding out that they could not even keep track of the fight and the moves was simply depressing.

After countless exchanges, Elder Taiyin became even more confident, as Ye Xuan was simply dodging.

He felt that Ye Xuan’s strength was merely a pretense and that the latter did not dare to fight him head-on.

The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

“Is this what you learned from Tian Xuan? Do you only know how to play hide and seek?”

“Hehe! Since you’re so eager to find out, I’ll satisfy your curiosity!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes flashed after he heard that.

He had been dodging this entire time simply to observe and understand the Immortal sword technique. However, he had seen enough, and now it was time for him to counterattack.

Ye Xuan stood in the sky facing Elder Taiyin openly.

“This is a good opportunity!”

Seeing this, Elder Taiyin’s eyes lit up. It seemed that his goading had worked.

The Immortal Sword surged with power and he swung it toward Ye Xuan.

“Chief Ye Xuan, be careful!”

Seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy, who was in the crowd, shouted out a warning with a pale face.

However, due to the noise around them, her voice did not travel far..

“Oh my god, why isn’t this guy dodging anymore?”

“Is he going to lose just like that?”

Ye Xuan’s actions confused everyone.

A terrifying golden light suddenly flashed in the sky and condensed into a huge sword. The tip of the sword exuded destructive power.

Compared to this incomparably huge divine sword, Ye Xuan’s figure was as small as an ant.

At this moment, Ye Xuan slowly raised his right hand and gently pinched it with two fingers.

Bang! Bang!

The two terrifying powers collided violently, and the resulting violent shockwaves instantly wreaked havoc in the surroundings, creating spatial cracks

The mountains and forests near the center of the battlefield were also reduced to dust in an instant.

After the terrifying shockwaves dissipated, the entire scene fell deathly silent. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Oh my god…”

The onlookers’ eyes were filled with disbelief.

In the sky, Elder Taiyin, who had been full of confidence, was now wearing an expression of horror. He was stunned when he saw Ye Xuan gently reach out two fingers and catch his attack with ease.

“How is this possible?”

His heart was filled with disbelief. This was an attack that he had put all of his strength into. Although it was not his strongest divine power, it was definitely not something that a mystic lord realm expert could withstand with his body.

How did this guy do it?

“Hehe! It seems that the Immortal sword technique is only so-so!”

...

A faint smile hung on Ye Xuan’s lips, but no one noticed the mysterious golden divine patterns that were wrapped around his two fingers.

This was the power of the true dragon’s precious bone, which was the reason why he was confident that he could defeat Elder Taiyin without using the Cloud Heaven Sword.
