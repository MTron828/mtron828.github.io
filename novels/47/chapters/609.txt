610 Holy Land For Cultivation (Part 2)

“That’s for sure. This is one of the rarest treasures in the mystic world. As long as this tree bears water cloud fruits and can be picked, you can eat one and become even more powerful.”

Xiang Yun’s eyes seemed to light up when she heard Zhuge Yueyue’s words.

“Cold Sister, You’re not lying to me, right?”

If she became more powerful, she would be able to defeat all the children in her generation. This was a temptation that exceeded a pile of potatoes for her.

!!

Feng Xiyun also continued, “Of course she’s not lying to you. You must guard this tree well, alright? Otherwise, if it’s destroyed by others, you won’t be able to eat its fruits, and you won’t be as powerful.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun instantly made a solemn vow, “Alright, first and second sister, you can rest assured and leave the protection of this tree to me!”

“If anyone dares to scheme against this tree, I’ll flatten them with my hammer!”

Looking at her clenched small fists and serious expression, Feng Xiyun felt a little guilty.

Was she trying to deceive the child?

Zhuge Yueyue was also speechless and did not know what to say.

At this moment, a few figures flashed over. They were Ao Lei and the other chiefs.

Ao Lei had only just arrived, but had already sensed the presence of the water cloud fruit tree planted in the garden. His pupils shrank. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Could it be… Is that the water cloud fruit tree that only exists in legends?”

At this time, Gao Shun similarly moved closer to take a look. When he noticed the water cloud fruit tree, his expression was exactly the same as Ao Lei’s.

“Unbelievable. Ye Xuan actually obtained a water cloud fruit tree sapling,” Gao Shun muttered as he pinched his own arm in disbelief. Only after feeling the pain did he believe what he was seeing.

This kid never seemed to be short of treasures.

“Junior Brother Ye, you’ve made such a big commotion without saying anything. You’ve given us quite the fright,” Ao Lei said with a face full of smiles.

The entire Cloud Sky peak was filled with vitality, and it looked like a cultivation holy land.

“I truly didn’t expect to ever see a water cloud fruit tree in person. This is truly an eye-opener for me.”

“Junior Brother Ye really has a bevy of treasure. I really can’t help but admire you.”

“Congratulations! From this moment on, the cultivation levels of Cloud Sky peak disciples will advance by leaps and bounds thanks to this tree.”

Ye Xuan, on the other hand, touched the leaves of the water cloud fruit tree pensively. He was overjoyed, but his expression was still very calm.

“Don’t tease me like this,” he said indifferently. This isn’t a rare treasure. I just want to copy what Teacher Tian Xuan did for me.”

“This tree is a reminder to the disciples of Cloud Sky peak that they must cultivate hard and grow strong like this tree.”

“Ahem, I just randomly planted it. It’s no big deal.”

After hearing this, everyone was dumbfounded.

Uh…

Randomly planted it?

Gao Shun cursed inwardly, ‘This brat is humble bragging again!’

Thinking back to Ye Xuan’s words, Gao Shun realized that Ye Xuan’s manner of showing off was unique, and even decided to adopt it for himself in the future.

Showing off like this probably felt amazing, right?

‘I’ll be reaching the supreme realm soon, so I’ll have to practice hard when I get back, hehe!’

From this moment on, Cloud Sky peak had been completely transformed. It was no longer a desolate, dilapidated peak. Instead, it had become a unique holy land for cultivation.

This was probably the place where one could cultivate the fastest within the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect. After all, the waterspout in the sky had already sucked in all of the nearby spiritual energy.

“If I could stay in this place and cultivate, that would be awesome,” some of the disciples said emotionally.

They had already noticed that there were a few small houses in the garden, and wished they could stay there.

However, as they were not from Cloud Sky peak, it was impossible for them to stay in this place.

“By the way, if I were to try and join Cloud Sky peak now, do you think it would be too late?”

One of the disciples asked this without any scruples. As soon as he finished speaking, he attracted the disdainful eyes of the others.

“I suggest you stop daydreaming.”

“Do you think that you’re a peerless genius who can attract Martial Uncle Ye’s attention?”

Just as everyone was in the middle of an intense discussion, Yuelun, who was wearing a pink dress, walked over with the disciples of Water Sky peak in tow.

When she saw the water cloud fruit tree planted in the courtyard, her jaw dropped.

“This is… A water cloud fruit tree?”

Yuelun was stunned. She turned around and asked Ye Xuan, “Junior Brother Ye, where did you find this water cloud fruit tree?”

She could not figure it out no matter how hard she racked her brains. She remembered that Ye Xuan had only obtained the chiliad gold vine seedling in the ancient tomb, which was now with her.

How did he manage to find something as rare as the water cloud fruit tree?
