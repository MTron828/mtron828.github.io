414 Gathering Of Geniuses

Su Changhe was gobsmacked.

Although young masters like him were usually arrogant and foppish, they were only arrogant within the boundaries of Qingyang City. If they met these big shots, they would become as obedient as dogs.

Seeing the Reincarnation Fairy appear, Mu Beichen raised his eyelids slightly, but he did not say anything to her.

Instead, his gaze turned back to Lin Youming.

“Today, if it wasn’t for the Lin family head’s passionate performance, I wouldn’t have been able to witness such a shameless show.”

!!

“Compared to the Lin family head, I’m a little ashamed. I’ve thought about it, but I don’t know if I could ever be so shameless!”

When Lin Youming heard this, his lips twitched.

He knew very well that Mu Beichen was mocking him on purpose.

However, the other party’s identity was so terrifying that he did not dare to retort. However, he was also puzzled. Why would these peerless geniuses of the Yangli divine empire suddenly appear in Qingyang City?

Everyone’s expression turned grave.

If there was someone who could still maintain a calm expression, it would be Feng Xiyun. After all, she was the princess of the Yangli divine empire.

“Young Master Mu really knows how to joke. How would this old man dare to make a fuss in front of Young Master Nu?”

Lin Youming forced out a smile and was about to explain.

However, Mu Beichen waved his hand and interrupted him rudely, disregarding Lin Youming entirely.

“Alright! I’m too lazy to listen to you!”

Then, Mu Beichen’s gaze fell on Zhuge Yueyue. He was slightly surprised by the latter’s cold and aloof temperament.

Of course, he was only slightly surprised.

After all, as the Saint of an ancient family, he had seen far more in life.

What he valued was not only beauty, but also absolute strength.

“Cloud Sky sword!”

“Back then, Chief Tian Xuan’s strength was extraordinary. He could be said to be the strongest under the ancient realm. I didn’t expect that a hundred years after his death, his treasure would actually end up in your hands!”

Mu Beichen’s eyes were filled with regret.

“Fairy, can I take a look at the Cloud Sky sword?”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was puzzled.

“The Cloud Sky sword’s grade is quite ordinary. It’s just an Earth-rank artifact. Why is Young Master Mu interested in it?”

Mu Beichen did not refute her words, but said with a smile.

“Sometimes, the grade of the artifact is not important, but rather who its owner is.”

“Only the weak will rely on artifacts. For those who are truly strong, especially sword cultivators, even a wooden sword can release the most dazzling and powerful sword qi!”

“When I was young, I heard that the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Chief Tian Xuan entered the ancient battlefield alone. His sword qi swept across thousands of miles and stopped the invasion of the myriad races. He was like a god back then!”

“Although the Cloud Sky sword’s grade isn’t anything special, it’s already part of that legend!”

Hearing Mu Beichen’s words, Zhuge Yueyue finally understood.

When she first received this sword from Ye Xuan, she had been curious as to why Yuelun displayed such an expression. She had no idea that the Cloud Sky sword was part of such a legendary feat.

When she thought of this, Zhuge Yueyue felt very happy that Ye Xuan valued her so much as to give her this precious sword.

“Alright, I’ll let you take a look,” Zhuge Yueyue looked at Mu Beichen, then handed the Cloud Sky sword to him.

Seeing this, Mu Beichen took the Cloud Sky sword with a solemn expression and carefully examined the sword.

As expected, the Cloud Sky sword contained residual traces of Tian Xuan’s destructive sword qi.

Not only was he a peerless genius with a Dao body, but he was also a genius who was obsessed with the Sword Dao. Every time he encountered a peerless sword, he could not help but admire it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The Saint of the Mu family must really be in a good mood to actually come all the way to Qingyang City to see a sword.”

At this moment, a cold voice rang out.

Mu Beichen glanced in the direction of the voice.

“Oh?”

“Xu Changqing, I didn’t expect you to come and join in the fun!”

Mu Beichen looked at the Cloud Sky sword in his hand as he spoke.

Xu Changqing did not bother to pay attention to him. His eyes fell on the Reincarnation Fairy, and the corners of his mouth curved into an arc.

“Reincarnation Fairy, we are really fated to meet again!”

The corners of the Reincarnation Fairy’s mouth twitched. Were it not for the need to maintain her public image, she would have slapped him.

Where did this bullshit fate come from? This guy had stalked her for a month. Did he really think that she had not noticed?

“Please don’t spout nonsense,” the reincarnation fairy said indifferently as she turned her face away, not even bothering to look at Xu Changqing.

At this moment, Mu Beichen finished admiring the Cloud Sky sword and returned it to Zhuge Yueyue.

“It’s truly a peerless sword. It’s worthy of being Chief Tian Xuan’s weapon.”

“I hope you will safeguard it well and uphold its reputation.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded and did not say anything further.

Mu Beichen’s eyes then fell on Lin Youming, and a cold light flashed across the depths of his eyes.

He had always disliked those who bullied the weak, especially people like this thick-skinned Lin Youming.

Just as he was about to make a move, a few cultivators suddenly descended from the sky and blocked Mu Beichen.

On the contrary, when Lin Dong saw these cultivators, his eyes involuntarily filled with joy as he hurriedly knelt down.

“Lin Dong greets Teacher and martial uncles!”

Just a moment ago, Lin Dong had felt that he was going to die for sure. Thankfully, Sun Mobai and a few elders from the Immortal Divine sect had actually descended at this critical moment.

“En!” Su Mobai first looked at Lin Dong, before his gaze landed on Mu Beichen.

“Mu Beichen, my disciple was too insensible and accidentally offended you.”

“I hope that the Saint can forgive him on my account.”

Mu Beichen laughed and smiled.

“Do you really think that the person your precious disciple provoked is me?”

Of course, if Sun Mobai had not suddenly appeared, he would not have minded helping Zhuge Yueyue and the others deal with Lin Dong.
