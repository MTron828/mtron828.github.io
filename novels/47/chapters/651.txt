652 Inevitable Battle (Part 2)

“It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Senior Ye Xuan in battle. I’m so excited,” Mu Beichen mumbled to himself, not even willing to blink.

Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan with concern. However, she did not forget to turn around to look at Zhuge Yueyue and say, “Yueyue, you’d better watch this fight properly.”

“A battle between the peak-level supreme realm experts is an opportunity for you. If you can gain insights from it, it will definitely be beneficial to your cultivation.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded in agreement as she fixed her eyes on the two people in the sky.

!!

She was already on the verge of reaching the heaven realm, so Yuelun hoped that she would be able to use the insights from this battle to break through.

At this moment, the two people in the sky were ready to fight. Ye Xuan did not even take out his weapon, but simply raised his right hand toward Daoist Gu Hao.

Moments later, spiritual power gushed out from his right hand and condensed into a sword. He said calmly, “Daoist Gu Hao, let’s not waste any more time.”

Despite facing an expert from the older generation, Ye Xuan did not choose to make the first move.

Daoist Gu Hao responded in kind. He also stretched out his right hand and instantly manipulated the water from the river below, causing it to surge into the sky.

As his hands constantly performed hand seals, the streams of water condensed into a protective barrier, while hundreds of Dao lotuses bloomed.

“This move isn’t bad. His state of mind has already reached a terrifying level,” Daoist Canghai said.

At the supreme realm, a person’s state of mind would also have a huge impact on the battle. Some would be able to command the power of the laws with their words, or even their thoughts, like how Daoist Canghai had done so with the tea inside the teapot earlier.

“Using water as a shield, and condensing water into lotuses. Water can be unchanging, but it can also be ever-changing. There must be a powerful Dao principle within this.”

“How will Senior Ye Xuan respond to this move?”

Mu Beichen muttered to himself. He seemed to have understood something.

In the air, Ye Xuan was also shocked by Daoist Gu Hao’s move, but he remained calm.

Moments later, the Dao lotuses transformed into destructive streams of water that shot toward Ye Xuan. These streams of water shimmered with fluorescent light, which would unconsciously dazzle their target, breaking their focus.

This attack was not as ordinary as it seemed.

Ye Xuan seemed to be able to see his own past. Time flew by, and years passed by in front of his eyes. It was obvious that the attack contained the power of time as well.

After seeing Ye Xuan’s expression change drastically, Daoist Gu Hao finally displayed a proud expression.

“Tsk, you’re still too young after all. I’d like to see how you’re going to break this technique.”

It was obvious that he was very confident in the attack he had just launched. After all, it involved the power of time, so it was not that easy to block.

Wherever these surging streams of water passed through, all of the flowers, grass, and trees would wither and lose their vitality.

Under the accelerated flow of time, all life would eventually wither.

Then, the surging water pierced Y Xuan’s body, stealing away his vitality.

Could it be… Was everything over?

Ye Xuan calmly stretched out his hand and made a sweeping motion. Rays of emerald green light emerged, instantly illuminating the surroundings.

Immediately, the land of death around him was transformed into a field full of vitality. Green buds emerged, and flowers competed to bloom, creating a spectacular sight.

“Heavens!”

Everyone present was dumbfounded by this scene.

“Such exuberant vitality… Teacher must have used an amazing technique, right?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes never left Ye Xuan’s figure as she muttered to herself in shock.

The more she thought about the move, the more she started to understand its profundities.

On the other side, Daoist Gu Hao was frightened. He really did not expect that the powerful attack he had worked so hard to create would be so easily offset.

“Haha, Daoist Gu Hao, what do you think of the move I just used? Does it pass muster?”

After easily defusing Daoist Gu Hao’s attack, Ye Xuan smirked.

The move he had just used was the third move of the Flora Sword technique.

The difference between this move and the Heaven-splitting Sword was that it was not filled with killing intent. Instead, it was filled with a rich vitality.

“This… How did you comprehend this move?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Daoist Gu Hao asked in a daze. This time, he had indeed lost.

No matter how one looked at it, Ye Xuan’s move was better than his.

The path of cultivation did not mean that one had to kill everyone and everything. The path of nurturing and life was inevitably seen as better.
