474 A Grim Situation

At noon, Ye Xuan finally arrived at Qingyang City with Su Changhe.

“Eh… Is this really Qingyang City? Chief Ye Xuan, did we come to the wrong place?”

Su Changhe suddenly realized that something was wrong.

The Qingyang City in front of him seemed to be very different from how he remembered it to be.

The once prosperous Qingyang City was now filled with countless refugees. Huge holes had been punched into the hard walls of the city, and the streets were filled with flames.

Countless refugees were lying on the ground and wailing. This was like hell on earth.

“This… What happened?”

Su Changhe panicked when he saw this and quickly ran in the direction of the Su family’s residence.

Ye Xuan did not stop him and followed him.

“Father… Mother…”

As soon as Su Changhe returned to the Su family’s residence, he immediately ran toward the main hall with an anxious expression on his face.

“Young master…”

When the servants of the Su family saw Su Changhe return, they immediately turned nervous and wanted to stop him.

However, Su Changhe moved too quickly and had almost reached the hall.

Just then, a figure in white suddenly appeared at the door.

“Greetings, Chief Ye Xuan!”

Seeing this, everyone hurriedly bowed with respect.

Although most of them had never seen Ye Xuan before, Su Changhe had already circulated portraits of Ye Xuan throughout the Su family, demanding that every servant remember Ye Xuan’s appearance and not offend him.

“Mm! Is Master Su present?”

When the servants heard this, they immediately became flustered.

“Some time ago, the family head brought the family’s experts to the archaic divine mountains to help the refugees, and he has yet to return.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan frowned. He had just used his divine sense to examine the general situation in Qingyang City.

Right now, Qingyang City was in the midst of war. The city was in shambles, and the streets were filled with countless refugees.

At such a critical moment, Su Tiansheng had actually brought the experts of his family to help the refugees of the archaic divine mountains?

However, on second thought, it was quite normal for Su Tiansheng, as the head of a major family in Qingyang City, to help out. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Is Chief Ye Xuan looking for Master Su for something in particular?”

A person who seemed to be the leader of the servants took a step forward and asked nervously.

Ye Xuan shook his head slightly.

“It’s nothing. I just came over as it was on the way.”

At that moment, Su Changhe walked out of the main hall. His worried expression had returned to normal.

Just now, he had already learned from his mother that his father had indeed brought the experts of the family to the archaic divine mountains.

After knowing that his parents were safe, Su Changhe heaved a sigh of relief, and then looked at Ye Xuan.

“Chief Ye Xuan, my father is currently in the archaic divine mountains, so he is unable to welcome you personally. Are we going there next?”

Su Changhe had no idea why Ye Xuan had left the sect earlier, but once he saw Qingyang City’s situation and heard about it from his mother, he now had his guesses.

After all, Qingyang City had encountered a disaster and the entire city was engulfed by the flames of war. The Su family’s residence was in Qingyang City, so naturally, they were not spared.

Perhaps Chief Ye Xuan had taken this into consideration, and that was why he had brought Su Changhe along.

Currently, several hundred miles away from Qingyang City, there were countless berserk beasts slaughtering everything in their surroundings.

The major families of Qingyang City had already gathered many cultivators to fight to the death against these berserk beasts.

Qingyang City was also in a state of turmoil. As the number of refugees in the city increased, the frequency of burning, killing, and plundering increased.

If this continued, the city would descend into chaos even before the berserk beasts breached the city’s defenses.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

“There’s no hurry. Follow me. We’ll take a look outside the city.”

Although there were many refugees in the city, the soldiers from the City Lord’s mansion were still suppressing them. There would not be any major incidents for the time being.

However, in comparison, the situation outside the city was not good.

Waves for berserk beasts were advancing toward Qingyang City, and cultivators from the various top holy lands of the Yangli divine empire had also appeared.

One of them was the elder from the Jade Lake Divine sect, Situ Mo.

Of course, there were also many unfamiliar faces that Ye Xuan had never seen before.

“Alright!”

Su Changhe quickly nodded and followed closely behind Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan and Su Changhe traversed the war-torn streets and made their way out of Qingyang City.

Su Changhe was shocked as he looked at the land that was seemingly bathed in flames.

“F*ck! What caused this?”

At that moment, many cultivators had gathered on the top of the city wall and were looking into the distance.

“Have you guys heard? Last night, a few experts from the Xia family encountered an extremely terrifying ancient beast descendant on their way to the archaic divine mountains. It was rumored to be a mystic lord realm beast!”

...

“I heard about it too. I was told that the Xia family lost hundreds of men because of this.”

“Not only that, but the beast seems to be heading in the direction of Green Sky Ridge! The Lin family and the Xia family have already sent out many scouts to track down the beast. Who knows what is going on out there now?”

“Now that the heavenly treasure has appeared, the ancient beast descendants of the archaic divine mountains are causing havoc everywhere. The entire East continent is in turmoil!”

“I don’t know how long Qingyang City can last. We have to make plans!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan pondered this matter, and his expression gradually turned serious.

From the looks of it, the situation was even more serious than he first thought. He had come down to hunt down the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

He had thought that he would be able to get some information from Qingyang City, but he had not expected that these cultivators would be clueless about its whereabouts.

It was likely that those who had seen it had perished at its hands.

Su Changhe saw the change in Ye Xuan’s expression and chose to remain silent, not daring to disturb him.

Suddenly, Su Changhe looked around and saw a familiar face.

“Oh? Isn’t this the famous Young Master Xia? How long has it been since we last met? How did you become so unkempt?”
