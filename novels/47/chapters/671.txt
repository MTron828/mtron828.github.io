672 Yun Hai Appears (Part 1)

Seeing that Li Hong was about to escape to the top, Xiang Yun swung her hammer and smashed the path that he was planning to take upwards. Mountain rocks instantly shattered and flew in all directions.

“Really… the only appropriate word to use here is f*ck!”

Everyone was completely dumbfounded, even those outside the ancient realm. The mountain had existed since ancient times, and was protected by the power that governed the ancient realm.

However, the mountain was actually damaged by Xiang Yun?

!!

At this moment, Li Hong was already sweating profusely.

If this girl’s hammer had hit him just now, he would definitely have died.

When the people outside the ancient realm saw this scene, they all nodded to themselves. The reincarnation of a mighty figure was indeed different. Powerful did not even begin to describe her.

“Don’t… Don’t be rash…”

At this moment, Li Hong was no longer arrogant. In fact, he felt like kneeling down and begging for mercy. He fell backwards, and started retreating when he saw Xiang Yun approach him with her hammer.

From his perspective, she looked like the God of Death. Then, his legs went limp.

“You must die today,” Xiang Yun said coldly. She raised her hammer and aimed it at Li Hong.

Li Hong tried one last time to resist her, but it was all in vain. The hammer smashed into his saber, completely deforming it. Then, it landed on his body, causing it to flash and disappear.

He had been eliminated!

Xiang Yun became anxious when she saw this. She was unaware of the fact that one would not really die after being killed in the ancient realm, so she thought that Li Hong had escaped.

She raised his head and looked around, but could not find Li Hong at all. All she could see were the remaining Supreme Divine sect disciples, as well as those who had stayed to watch the show, trying to sneak away.

Since she could not find Li Hong, she decided to vent her anger on these people. When they realized this, they all had the same thought… 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

F*ck!

“If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have started climbing instead of staying back here. It’s over now! Damn it!”

The people present felt that they were innocent bystanders, but Xiang Yun was not in the mood to figure out who was who.

She soared into the sky, and streaks of purple lightning flashed once again, creating a large lightning cage that trapped everyone inside.

“I can’t take it anymore!”

Among these people, Yun Hai was furious. He was planning to bide his time and then swoop in to earn the victory at the crucial moment.

However, it now looked like he was about to be eliminated by this little girl.

This was unacceptable!

“Damn it, you little girl, I can’t stand it anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yun Hai unsheathed his sword and unleashed his aura. His peak-level void realm cultivation was revealed at this moment, stunning those who were trapped inside with him.

Who would have thought that there would be a genius hidden among this crowd of motley people?

“Why have I never seen this person before? Who is he?”

“If I’m not wrong, he should be from the Ice Zone. The signature cold aura emitted from his body is really too obvious.”

“I know who he is!”

“This person is an Ice Dao expert from the Ice Temple of the Ice Zone. Moreover, that Ice Sword he wields is very powerful.”

“He is one of the participants who is tipped to emerge victorious. I didn’t expect to see him here.”

After hearing this, everyone finally understood who he was.

“In that case, are we saved?”

After seeing Yun Hai appear, everyone was overjoyed. If he could defeat this little girl, then they would still be able to continue participating in the gathering.

Seeing Yun Hai step forward, Xiang Yun blinked, and then turned around to ask those who had spoken, “Ice Dao? Is it strong?”

“Um… It can’t be considered the strongest, but it’s still rather powerful.”

Xiang Yun was dumbfounded. Was it or was it not strong? Why were they beating around the bush?

Having learnt nothing useful, she swung her hammer at the person who replied, instantly eliminating him.

After releasing his aura, Yun Hai hovered in the air with his sword in hand, preparing for battle. It felt very satisfying to be acknowledged and recognized by others.

“The Ice Dao contains the power…”

Yun Hai started to speak, but Xiang Yun was having none of it, and swung her hammer at him.

F*ck!

‘At least let me say something!’

Yun Hai’s expression changed drastically. He had been accumulating his strength just now to deal Xiang Yun a vicious blow.

However, the little girl had not bothered to listen to his spiel and simply attacked head-on and without hesitation. Caught off guard, he was left in the lurch, and was forced to endure dozens of hammer strikes.

Yun Hai lasted about 60 seconds before being smashed into the ground to create another one of Xiang Yun’s signature pits in the ground.
