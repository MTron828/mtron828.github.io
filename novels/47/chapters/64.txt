Chapter 65: The Dust Has Settled

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Xuan’s avid fans jumped up in excitement and waved frantically at him.

It was as if they were saying, “Oppa, look over here.”

They also did not expect Ye Xuan to be so handsome, and his every move exuded a domineering presence.

These fans of his had long fantasized about the day that they would be able to see Ye Xuan in person, but they also knew that this was basically a pipe dream.

Unexpectedly, this dream actually came true today. Ye Xuan was actually in a remote place like Jiangqing City!

While countless cultivators were excited, Chen Ping’s face was filled with despair, and he directly collapsed to the ground.

Ye Xuan… Li Qingyan’s teacher is actually Ye Xuan!

It’s over, it’s over! The Chen family is really doomed!

No wonder that woman was able to raise her cultivation level within such a short period of time!

Ye Xuan alone was not an existence that the Mad Saber sect could contend against, let alone the Qingyun sect behind him.

“Don’t worry, Senior. You won’t have to lift a finger to do anything regarding this small matter. I will settle it myself!”

Seeing this, the leader of the Mad Saber sect heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, Ye Xuan had left a way out for him.

At the same time, his heart was filled with joy. Fortunately, he had not impulsively attacked Li Qingyan earlier. Otherwise, what awaited him would only be death.

Ye Xuan was a terrifying golden core realm powerhouse!

If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed that this guy had pulled wool over the eyes of the entire Great Qian Dynasty!

Hidden underneath the facade of a middle stage Xudan realm cultivator was the terrifying strength of a golden core realm expert!

Most importantly, this guy was only 20 years old! Even the first king of the Great Qian Dynasty had not reached the golden core realm at that age, right?

The leader of the Mad Saber sect did not know who was stronger or weaker.

However, from now on, Ye Xuan had become the person he could not afford to offend.

This guy’s potential was too terrifying. In less than ten years, he alone would be equivalent to a top-tier sect. He could even reach heights that the cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty had never reached in hundreds of years… the Unity realm!

Rather than provoke Ye Xuan, he would rather offend a top-tier sect.

“Chen Ping, don’t blame me. It’s your fault for being blind and offending Ye Xuan!”

“Only by killing you can I escape from the gates of hell!”

Thinking this, the gaze of the leader of the Mad Saber sect suddenly turned cold.

In fact, he did not really like his disciple much. The reason he had accepted Chen Ping as a disciple was to use his family’s power.

Chen Ping looked at the murderous eyes of the leader of the Mad Saber sect and despaired.

Chen Junhao, who was not far away, also started to tremble violently. His heart filled with dread.

“Ye Xuan, the cycle of karma will punish you, you will definitely…”

Chen Junhao shouted in despair. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this, the expression leader of the Mad Saber sect changed. A terrifying power suddenly swept out, and before the other party could finish speaking, it directly hit the two people.

Bang! Bang!

The terrifying power of a core formation realm cultivator wreaked havoc on the two people, which turned them into a bloody mist.

Seeing this, everyone immediately fell silent.

Although the leader of the Mad Saber sect had been crushed by Ye Xuan, the former was still a core formation realm cultivator in the end. Killing a purple spirit realm cultivator was a piece of cake!

Was this what a powerhouse was like? A single sentence could decide the life and death of a family that had existed for hundreds of years!

Countless cultivators fell silent. They felt their blood boiling.

This was Ye Xuan, the strongest cultivator of the younger generation of the Great Qian Dynasty.

The leader of the Mad Saber sect did not stop there. His spiritual power erupted and he killed all of the elders of the Chen family around the arena.

Then, he took a step forward and turned into a ray of light, heading toward the Chen family’s residence.

He was going to wipe out the Chen family today.

“Let’s go!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve and left with Li Qingyan and the others.

The audience’s eyes fell on the messy arena platform. They were all silent. After an unknown amount of time, the silence was broken.

“What… What terrifying power!”

“That guy is really strong!”

“Is that how strong Ye Xuan is? Is this how strong the strongest genius cultivator in the Great Qian Dynasty is? The leader of the Mad Saber sect was nothing to him!”

…

Today was a day that would be recorded in Jiangqing City’s history books.

The Zhu family, one of the three major families in Jiangqing City, had been destroyed!

A top-tier core formation realm powerhouse, the leader of the Mad Saber sect, had personally descended upon Jiangqing City.

Not only that, Ye Xuan, the strongest genius cultivator of the younger generation of the Great Qian Dynasty, had also descended upon Jiangqing City and used absolute strength to forcefully crush the leader of the Mad Saber sect.

The latter directly threw away his dignity and knelt on the ground to beg for mercy. Then, he personally killed his disciple and his disciple’s family.

This was the biggest thing that had ever happened in Jiangqing City throughout the past hundred years.

Many cultivators witnessed the terrifying power of core formation realm cultivators.

With Li Qingyan becoming Ye Xuan’s disciple, the Li family once again became the strongest family in Jiangqing City. Moreover, under Ye Xuan’s protection, the Li family’s position would not be shaken.

After all, the two words “Ye Xuan” were more intimidating than those ordinary core formation realm cultivators.

It could not be helped, right? He had reached the core formation realm at the age of 20. From this, it could be seen that his future was limitless.

In addition to this, Li Qingyan had reached the eighth level of the true essence realm within a very short period of time under his tutelage!

All in all, the cultivators of Jiangqing City passed down hundreds of versions of the story. Every version was amazing, and the former’s popularity as the idol of countless young cultivators was reaffirmed.

Everyone was eager to become Ye Xuan’s disciple. Even if they could not become his disciple, they still wanted to be an in-name disciple or something.

In other words, if Ye Xuan really wanted to recruit in-name disciples, the countless young cultivators of Jiangqing City would probably line up in droves to seize this opportunity.

Those older cultivators could not help but stroke their own beards.

“Does Elder Ye Xuan lack a butler? I’m an excellent cook!”

Of course, these were only fleeting thoughts and dreams in everyone’s minds.

Because of this, Jiangqing City became lively again, especially near the Li family’s residence.

There were many young girls who strolled around the Li family’s residence all day, hoping to impress Ye Xuan with their beauty.

Unfortunately, this was an exercise in futility.
