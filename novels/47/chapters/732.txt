733 The Anxious Su Changhe

Hua Rufeng had not expected Cloud Sky peak’s defensive formation to be so terrifying. He had not paid much attention to it earlier, but he had almost lost his life there.

Well… this was quite embarrassing…

Furthermore, he had been forced to ask his three junior sisters for help.

“Sigh…”

“The sect has decided that the disciple recruitment ceremony will be held in 30 days. At that time, Cloud Sky peak should be present too.”

!!

“Alright, Senior Brother Hua. We’ll be there.”

Zhuge Yueyue agreed without hesitation. However, when she saw Hua Rufeng sticking around, she felt a little puzzled.

Hua Rufeng muttered to himself for a moment before speaking up helplessly.

“Sister Zhuge, if it’s convenient, please go to the main entrance of the sect for a bit.”

“Su Changhe from the Su family of Qingyang City has been cursing for a long time because he was blocked outside the door.”

After saying this, Hua Rufeng could not help but wipe the sweat off his forehead.

He had just walked past the main entrance of the sect when he happened to see Su Changhe and some members of the Su family cursing non-stop outside.

Because the Great Wilderness Divine sect had already activated its defensive formation, these people could not enter at all. Additionally, as it was an emergency, they would not let outsiders in.

Some of the affiliated forces of the other peaks also wanted to enter, but because their peaks had sent disciples to guard the entrance, they were able to enter.

However, Cloud Sky peak was different, as it only had three disciples, including Zhuge Yueyue. They did not have manpower to spare to guard the entrance.

It was precisely because of this that no one knew these people from the Su family and they were stopped outside the gates.

Su Changhe could not be blamed for cursing either. After all, the current situation in the outside world was getting dangerous, and his family was still anxiously waiting for him to send word.

However, up until now, he had not even taken half a step into the Great Wilderness Divine sect, so there was no news to send.

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was momentarily stunned as she muttered to herself, “Su family? Why are they here?”

After pondering for a moment, Zhuge Yueyue’s face suddenly lit up. After all, Cloud Sky peak was currently lacking manpower, so Su Changhe had come at the right time.

She immediately turned around and said, “Xiyun, please bring Su Changhe and the others over first.”

“Alright.”

In a short while, they arrived at the entrance. When they saw how many people were gathered outside, Feng Xiyun was shocked, as was Xiang Yun.

She widened her eyes and said, “Woah! There are so many people here!”

“Second Sister, why are there so many people gathered here? Is there something special happening?”

Feng Xiyun was also very puzzled at this moment, but she had already noticed that some disciples from other peaks had brought some family members in recently.

If she was not wrong, these people were most likely here to avoid the disaster.

Those who had connections to the Great Wilderness Divine sect were very excited, while those who were stuck outside were extremely scared and nervous.

At this moment, Su Changhe was already a little impatient.

He had already been here for three days, but in these three days, he had not made one inch of headway into the sect.

No matter how much he begged, the disciples in charge of guarding the gate simply ignored him.

“Damn it!”

Su Changhe cursed again and could only kick the ground a few times. An old man beside him said at this time.

“Changhe, given the current situation, what should we do? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“The disciple guarding the gate won’t let us in at all, and we have no way of contacting Cloud Sky peak.”

Su Changhe felt helpless and said, “What can we do? We don’t have any other choice but to wait here.”

“The sect’s disciple recruitment will commence in 30 days. In the worst case scenario, we’ll just have to wait here until then.”

Hearing this, the others brought by Su Changhe felt hopeless. If they really waited until then, it would probably be too late, right? Disaster was looming, yet they were stuck out here.

Su Changhe naturally knew this very well, but he also knew that no matter how anxious he was, it would not be of any use.

After all, Ye Xuan had only taken in three disciples and was lacking in manpower. He would not send anyone to guard the gate, so the news naturally could not be passed on.

It was precisely because of this that he could only wait here.

If he was lucky enough, perhaps one of his disciples would coincidentally come to the entrance and receive them…

As if that would ever happen.

“We can’t continue like this. We can’t just wait like this.”

After thinking about it for a while, Su Changhe stood up again and went over to the guardian disciples, saying with a smile, “Haha, little brother, please let us in first. I am really from the Su family, and the Su family is a vassal of Cloud Sky peak. If I lie to you, then I will be struck by lightning!”

“If you can let me in, I will definitely be grateful to you, and will even make it worth your while.”

After seeing Su Changhe’s smiling face, the guardian disciple smiled and replied, “Go ahead and keep making up lies.”

“Over this period of time, there have been countless people who have said things like you. If you continue to make things up, maybe at some point I will believe you?”

This disciple named Li Hao did not take Su Changhe’s words to heart at all. After all, he had seen too many people like him these days.
