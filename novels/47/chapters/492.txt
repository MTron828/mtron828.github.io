493 Battle For Seniority

Li Siyuan was delighted to hear this.

From his perspective, as long as Elder Taiyin acted, he would definitely be able to crush Ye Xuan.

Thinking this, the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

‘Just you wait, kid. You’re gonna get it.’

!!

Su Changkong naturally noticed the change in Li Siyuan’s expression and sighed helplessly.

Since things had come to this, there was nothing he could do. He could only pray in his heart that Elder Taiyin could really suppress Ye Xuan.

At this moment, on the other side of the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains.

“Chief Ye Xuan, how long do you think this battle will last?”

Su Changhe was already numb from watching the battle for an entire night, and could not help but complain.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

“Once one breaks through to the supreme realm, the life force within one’s body is almost endless. As such, the recovery ability of supreme realm experts is extremely terrifying. Unless one is able to crush them with absolute power, determining the victor between them within a short period of time is impossible.”

Su Changhe did not know much about the cultivation. After all, he used to be a good-for-nothing rich man’s son, and the only reason he cultivated was because his father forced him to. Furthermore, his theoretical foundation regarding cultivation was lacking, and almost non-existent.

“But won’t they feel tired?” Su Changhe asked seriously.

Hearing this, the Reincarnation Fairy could not help but laugh.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched. Why had he brought this brat along again?

It was too embarrassing. Why was he such a dunce when it came to cultivating?

Thankfully, the Reincarnation Fairy was quite patient and said slowly, “Cultivation is about using the spiritual energy of the world to nourish your body and temper your meridians and bones. From there, your body will undergo qualitative changes.”

“As a cultivator breaks through, the limits of their body and meridians will also increase. In other words, as long as the spiritual power in the body is not completely consumed, a cultivator will never feel tired.”

“Isn’t this basic theoretical knowledge when it comes to cultivation? How could Young Master Su not be familiar with this?”

“Ah? Is this all common sense?” Su Changhe touched his head awkwardly.

‘Why didn’t my father teach me these things?’

Ye Xuan held his forehead helplessly, regretting his decision to bring this brat out. He was dying from second-hand embarrassment.

The Reincarnation Fairy was amused by this, but she was very curious.

Why would a powerful expert like Ye Xuan bring such a weirdo along?

Right at this moment, the spiritual energy around them started to fluctuate.

Sensing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes, and a cold gleam flashed across the depths of his eyes. He put two fingers together, and a monstrous sword qi manifested as he pointed his fingers toward the Reincarnation Fairy!

Seeing this, she was shocked.

She could not understand why Ye Xuan was suddenly about to attack her.

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, the sword qi erupted and flew toward her.

Then, the sound of clashing metal was heard.

She quickly turned around and discovered that an old man had appeared beside her.

The old man held an ancient bronze sword in his hand and had used it to block Ye Xuan’s attack.

“Teacher…”

The Reincarnation Fairy looked at the old man in surprise.

That’s right!

The old man who had suddenly appeared was no other than Chu Tianba.

She looked at Chu Tianba and then at Ye Xuan, who was in front of her, and explained hurriedly, “Chief Ye Xuan, please don’t attack. This is my teacher!”

While she was anxious about this, she was also touched. Just now, she had thought she had said something wrong, which caused Ye Xuan to attack her.

She had not expected Ye Xuan’s target to be her teacher instead. In that case, was he not protecting her?

Ye Xuan frowned. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The moment the old man appeared, he sensed a very strong aura from him. This old man was at least as strong as Gongsun Shouyue.

Seeing him appear so suddenly, he mistakenly believed that the old man was trying to harm the Reincarnation Fairy, and had thus attacked him with a probing strike.

That being said, he did not expect the other party to be so powerful as to be able to block his attack so easily. Of course, the probing strike was merely a casual attack.

“You must be Ye Xuan, right?”

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan’s attainments in terms of the Sword Dao are truly shocking. If I didn’t react in time, I’m afraid I would have died.”

Chu Tianba looked at Ye Xuan, a smile appearing on his aged face.

“Fellow Daoist must be the grand elder of the Jade Lake Divine sect, Chu Tianba?”

Ye Xuan did not react to the flattery. Instead, he was very humble.

“Fellow Daoist Chu is truly powerful. You managed to block my attack so easily. It seems that I am lacking when compared to Fellow Daoist Chu.”

Of course, both of them were just being polite. After that brief exchange, they had a general understanding of each other’s strength.

Chu Tianba was extremely surprised. Ignoring everything else, just in terms of Sword Dao, the attack just now had truly amazed him.

He had not been lying just now. If he had not reacted in time, he really might have died because of that attack.

At least among the cultivators of his generation, he had never seen anyone with such terrifying sword qi.

...

“Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, you’re truly worthy of being the disciple of Chief Tian Xuan. If he was able to see what you have achieved today, my old friend would be able to rest in peace,” Chu Tianba said with a smile.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

‘What’s wrong with you, old man? On the surface, you call me Fellow Daoist, but now you’re bringing up your friendship with my teacher. Are you not secretly trying to take advantage of me? Do you think that it’s that easy?’

“When I was in the sect, Senior Brother Gongsun often mentioned Fellow Daoist Chu’s name to me.”

Ye Xuan immediately began to fight back.

“Senior Brother Gongsun told me that he did not have many friends left in his life, and Fellow Daoist Chu is one of them! Before I left, Senior Brother Gongsun gave me special instructions to take good care of the disciple of the Jade Lake Divine sects!”

Chu Tianba’s mouth twitched.

How could he not see what Ye Xuan was getting at? This kid was quite smart.

He had thought that he could use his relationship with Chief Tian Xuan to gain the advantage in terms of seniority, but this kid responded by using Gongsun Shouyue to ward off his attempt.
