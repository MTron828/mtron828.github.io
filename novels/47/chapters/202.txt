Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Screech!

Terrifying green flames gathered within the Firewing’s mouth, which were then spat out as a flurry of flames swept toward Elder Niejin.

“Not good!”

When Elder Niejin saw this, he panicked.

This attack was as strong as a mid-grade golden core realm’s full power attack. With his cultivation level, he was unable to withstand it.

He hurriedly crushed the protective jade token in his storage ring!

Accompanied by a bright flash of light, an energy barrier enveloped his body.

Boom!

The flurry of flames struck the energy barrier. Although the barrier shook and trembled, it still held out in the end.

“Tower Master, please save me!”

Elder Niejin cried out in fear.

In fact, before Elder Niejin had even shouted for help, the master of the White Moon Tower had already sensed this terrifying energy.

Moments later, a middle-aged man in a blue robe appeared in the sky. He was the master of the White Moon Tower, Dai Weibo, who was a top-notch expert at the late stage of the golden core realm.

Screech!

The Firewing released a long screech and looked at Dai Weibo with fear in its eyes.

It could clearly sense that this middle-aged man’s strength exceeded its own. However, in order to fulfill its master’s request, it still rushed forward without any hesitation.

“Beast!”

Seeing this, Dai Weibo shouted coldly. His right hand blossomed with a bright golden light, and then he extended his hand toward the Firewing.

A large golden hand suddenly grabbed the flaming bird’s neck, restraining it.

“Release my Little Flame! Tower Master, I beg you, please don’t hurt it…”

Seeing this, Zhao Yuyan became anxious, and she hurriedly begged Dai Weibo for mercy.

A strange light flashed through Dai Weibo’s eyes. Could this be Zhao Yuyan’s mount?

How could a mere second-level refinement realm cultivator possess such a terrifying mount?

Who exactly was behind this girl?

The reason why Dai Weibo did not kill the Firewing was because he immediately thought of the implications of this matter.

Given this girl’s strength, it was impossible for her to form a contract with such a powerful demonic beast, which could only mean one thing…

There was a terrifying existence behind this girl.

He did not know exactly what kind of strength the other party had, but it would definitely far surpass his. Otherwise, how could the other party make a golden core realm demonic beast submit to a refinement realm cultivator?

Most importantly, even under his control, this demonic beast was still struggling frantically.

Such an unruly existence could only be tamed by a unity realm expert.

“Tower Master, you must not let it go!”

Not far away, Elder Niejin’s face belied his panic. If the Tower Lord released it, would he not die?

“Go back to White Moon Tower first,” Dai Weibo said to Elder Niejin indifferently.

When Elder Niejin heard this, he looked at the Firewing with an unwilling expression.

This demonic beast’s strength was extremely terrifying. If it did not die here, there would definitely be endless problems for him in the future.

He had not expected Zhao Yuyan to contract such a terrifying demonic beast. Could this be the opportunity that this girl obtained in the mystic realm?

Or could it be that there was a terrifying existence behind this girl?

No matter what the outcome was, at this moment, he had no time to think.

Following that, Elder Niejin decisively chose to run back to the White Moon Tower and hide in his palace.

Only after Elder Niejin left did Dai Weibo choose to release the Firewing. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Screech!

The moment the Firewing regained its freedom, it released a terrifying green flame and chased after Elder Niejin.

“Little Flame, come back quickly!”

At this moment, Zhao Yuyan’s voice spoke up.

The Firewing stopped and turned into a streak of light that entered Zhao Yuyan’s forehead.

Little Flame was the name that Zhao Yuyan had given the Firewing.

Zhao Yuyan knew that as long as Dai Weibo was around, Miyamoto Niejin would not die.

“Hmm?”

When Dai Weibo saw the Firewing turn into a streak of light and enter Zhao Yuyan’s forehead, he narrowed his eyes.

He actually saw this little girl holding a jade token.

Although he could not sense the power contained within the jade token, his intuition told him that if the power within the jade token was fully unleashed, even he might not be able to block it.

Could it be that if he had not chosen to release the Firewing just now, this girl would have crushed the jade token?

Dai Weibo’s eyes flickered.

Jade tokens were immune to the spiritual sense probing of other cultivators.

As long as one did not crush the jade token, no one would know the extent of the power stored within the jade token.

Therefore, Dai Weibo only sensed danger through his intuition.

However, he did not know that once the jade token was crushed, not only could it kill him instantly, but it could also destroy the entire White Moon Tower.

However, Dai Weibo still chose to stop.

Regardless of the power contained within the jade token, the simple fact that the other party had a golden core realm demonic beast as a mount was enough to prove that there was a terrifying existence behind this girl.

“Zhao Yuyan… who is your teacher?”

Dai Weibo hesitated for a moment before finally asking the question.

“I’m sorry! Forgive me for not being able to reveal it.” Zhao Yuyan shook her head.

Other than her parents, she valued her teacher the most.

Moreover, were it not for the fact that her mother was in a life-and-death situation, she would not have released the Firewing.

Although Zhao Yuyan was young, she knew that if she revealed her teacher’s identity, the other party might use her to bring trouble to her teacher.

Dai Weibo squinted his eyes and looked deeply at Zhao Yuyan. Then, he turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

At the same time, Dai Weibo thought about whether he had offended Zhao Yuyan before.

As someone who was able to become the leader of a large sect, Dai Weibo’s personality was naturally extremely cautious.

Now that he knew that there was a very likely terrifying existence behind Zhao Yuyan, he naturally had to make plans.

As everyone knew, those terrifying cultivators had extremely strange personalities. They could be said to be temperamental, and some experts were extremely protective of their own. If they knew that their disciple had been wronged, would they not directly hang him and beat him up?

“It doesn’t seem like I’ve done anything overboard, right?”

Dai Weibo rubbed his chin and began to think seriously.

The matter of Zhao Yuyan bringing bad luck to others had indeed incited disgust and curses from the countless cultivators of the White Moon Tower.

However, he did not participate in it. Of course, he did not put a halt to it either.
