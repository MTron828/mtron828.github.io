Chapter 182: The Final Boss

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The 99th floor of the Tower of Heaven!

This was a space filled with chaotic qi. In the center of the space, there was a tree that towered into the sky.

The tree was huge, but under the tree sat a stone table and two stone stools.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

In this space, he did not notice the existence of the illusory phantoms.

In the previous trials, each level had illusory phantoms condensed from the energy of the Tower of Heaven. After the 60th level, there were also illusory phantoms that were copies of the previous challengers.

Up until the 88th level, Ye Xuan had faced two enemies.

However, because no one had reached the 89th level, Ye Xuan only faced one illusory phantom in the subsequent challenges.

But to his surprise, there was no illusory phantom in the final trial. How was he supposed to complete this trial?

Should he just destroy the stone table and stools?

Ye Xuan held his divine sword and pondered for a moment.

In the later trials, Ye Xuan had experienced the terror of the Tower of Heaven.

If he had not reached the second-level of the unity realm, he would never have made it to the 99th level.

Ye Tian, who had been ranked first on the combat power list, was indeed terrifying. His illusory phantom was a peak first-level unity realm expert.

Moreover, as a cultivator from the Moon Demon Holy Land, his martial techniques were very high-level, and he displayed a level of strength that was far beyond an ordinary first-level unity realm realm expert, and even some second-level unity realm experts.

Those in the top 100 of the Combat Power List had all reached the unity realm, and those in the top 10 had even comprehended some form of intent, be it sword intent, fist intent, and so on.

Although Ye Xuan could kill them instantly without using sword qi, he still could not help but sigh in his heart.

These were all peerless geniuses with extremely monstrous talent. If they were allowed to cultivate for dozens of years, they would definitely reach the third or fourth level of the unity realm before reaching the age limit of the Tower of Heaven.

At that time, if they came back to challenge the Tower of Heaven again, they would definitely reach the 99th level.

However, what puzzled Ye Xuan was the fact that those people did not come again after their first challenge.

As Ye Xuan was thinking this, the enormous tree began to shake. Countless branches gathered together and an illusory phantom condensed, exuding a terrifying aura.

“Is it finally about to begin?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

The power of this illusory phantom was very terrifying. In terms of cultivation, it surpassed Ye Xuan.

He was unsure whether it had reached the third or fourth level of the unity realm.

As the branches continued to gather, the appearance of the phantom gradually became clear. It was different from the blurry outlines from before. Clothes actually appeared on this phantom’s body, and there were also clear facial features. It was as if it was a real person.

He was wearing red armor. He exuded an imposing aura, as if looking down upon the world. His long, slender hair fell beyond his shoulders, and his face was extremely demonic.

Although he was a man, he was more beautiful than a woman.

“How long have I been asleep?”

The man in red armor actually spoke in human language.

“Twenty years old? Peak second-level unity realm?”

The man’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan, and he could not help but show a hint of admiration.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but frown. The illusory phantom on the 99th floor actually possessed consciousness?

“Haha, what? Counting the time, it has been almost 300,000 years, right?”

“I can’t believe that there is still someone who can reach the top of the Tower of Heaven. This is truly a surprise to me!”

The man looked at Ye Xuan and laughed out loud.

“Your talent is indeed very monstrous, but with your current strength, it is basically impossible for you to pass the 99th level,” the man said with a smile.

“When I refined the Tower of Heaven back then, I had no intention of letting the trial-takers pass the 99th level!”

As he spoke, the man could not help but reveal a mischievous smile.

Boom!

Moments later, the man took a step forward, and a surge of power suddenly erupted, causing Ye Xuan to feel tremendous pressure.

“This energy body has the power of the fourth level of the unity realm. If it were to be fully unleashed, it can reach the peak of the fourth level!”

“Moreover, it has the same abilities as I did when I was a fourth-level unity realm cultivator!”

“Young man, do you think you have a chance of winning?”

The man looked at Ye Xuan and said with a smile.

“I won’t know before I try.”

Ye Xuan slowly raised the longsword in his hand, and the aura of his second-level unity realm cultivator suddenly erupted.

Moments later, the two powerful auras clashed together, causing space to tremble.

“Hahaha! As expected of a peerless genius who was able to reach the 99th level. You’re really bold!”

Seeing this, the red-armored man laughed, and his admiration for Ye Xuan grew.

Even though this young man’s cultivation level was lower, he still wanted to challenge him.

Unexpectedly, this young man was even more arrogant than he was back then.

However, it was simply wishful thinking!

Whoosh! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The red-armored man clenched his hands, and two sharp longswords appeared.

The next second, the red-armored man’s figure turned into a bolt of lightning. When he reappeared, he was already above Ye Xuan’s head. Then two streaks of sword qi that could split open space swept toward Ye Xuan.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan did not choose to retreat.

This was the final test of the Tower of Heaven. Moreover, according to the red-armored man, he was the owner of the Tower of Heaven. This guy had deliberately increased the difficulty of the last test. He did not want anyone to pass!
