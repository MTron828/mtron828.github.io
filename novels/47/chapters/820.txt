821 Invincible Golden Body

No matter what, this little furry monkey had a good heart. It knew how to protect its people.

If it was taught the correct way, it would be able to become a kind monkey in the future. However, for some reason, Ye Xuan still felt that the little monkey would cause some trouble in the future.

It was precisely because of this that Ye Xuan still chose to use the identity as Daoist Ling to teach the monkey his skills.

If it were to cause trouble one day and others asked who its teacher was, he would be spared the infamy.

“Cough cough, you little monkey, you’re not bad.”

After that, Ye Xuan smiled and asked, “What’s your name? Where are you from?”

“Daoist, I don’t have a name, nor do I have parents. My origin is the distant Water Curtain Cave.”

“Oh? Could it be that you grew out of a stone?”

This sentence scared the little monkey silly.

Immortals were really immortals. They even knew such things!

It seemed that it had come to the right place this time. This person really had some remarkable abilities.

“Haha, Immortal, you are right. I was indeed born from a stone.”

Ye Xuan did not want to drag it on and said directly, “Alright, on account of your dedication to learning, I’ll make an exception for you and take you in as a disciple to teach you a peerless cultivation technique.”

“Since you don’t have a name, I’ll give you a name. How about Sun Wukong?”

Hearing this name, the little furry monkey was stunned.

“Sun Wukong? It sounds pretty good.”

“Alright! Thank you for giving me a name, Teacher. I like it very much.”

At this moment, the little monkey was already dancing with joy. From today onwards, he also had a name.

From this moment on, Wu Kong became Ye Xuan’s fourth disciple. However, no one knew about this fourth disciple, and perhaps no one ever would.

After accepting Wu Kong, Ye Xuan decided to get right to it. He had to seize this opportunity to obtain more resources from the system. After all, Ye Xuan possessed the cultivation technique contained within the divine runes on the seven-colored stone when Wu Kong was born.

Had Wu Kong possessed this cultivation technique, the Invincible Golden Body, the giant ape would not have been able to defeat him.

“Wu Kong, come with me.”

After witnessing this scene, the little monkey was stunned.

“I didn’t expect Teacher to be so powerful. I have to be careful not to anger him. If not, I’m afraid I won’t be able to avoid a beating.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Wu Kong felt a lingering sense of fear, and then began to climb up the mountain.

Some time later, the little furry monkey was trembling in front of Ye Xuan after finally making it up the mountain.

I’ll teach you the Invincible Golden Body technique today.””

“Invincible Golden Body technique?”

The little furry monkey was a little puzzled. Although he did not know what this cultivation technique was, it sounded extraordinary.

Ye Xuan smiled and said, “The Invincible Golden Body technique Vajra Art is very powerful. If you can cultivate it to its highest level, your defensive capabilities will make you impervious to blades and even the elements.”

“How about it? Do you want to learn this cultivation technique?”

After learning how powerful the technique was, Wu Kong instantly jumped up in excitement and nodded frantically.

“Teacher, please teach me this cultivation technique. I want to learn it. *

Wu Kong was surprised. He had never expected that he would be able to learn such a powerful cultivation technique immediately after becoming Daoist Ling’s disciple. This made him extremely happy.

“Very well, I’ll teach it to you now,” Ye Xuan said with a smile. The little monkey immediately sat in front of Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan casually waved his hand, and divine runes that emitted golden light instantly appeared in the sky. Then, they surged into the little monkey’s body.

At this moment, when the divine runes merged into his body, the little monkey was extremely surprised to find that he did not need to exert any effort to master this cultivation technique at all. It felt completely natural!

The divine runes directly fused with his body, instantly making him much stronger.

“Phew… This is too awesome.”

The little furry monkey could not help but sigh deeply. He could clearly sense that his body had become much stronger. His defense was off the charts, and almost every aspect of his body had been greatly improved.

Once the divine runes had completely fused with the little monkey’s body, Ye Xuan said, “The divine runes I just injected into your body contain a huge amount of energy along with the cultivation technique.”

“This cultivation technique is called the Invincible Golden Boy. In the future, you will cultivate diligently on this mountain peak. Remember not to slack off, understand?”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s exhortation, the little monkey nodded in agreement without any hesitation. Honestly, Wu Kong did not need Ye Xuan to teach him this cultivation technique. He could master it himself.

However, if he wanted to cultivate other cultivation techniques and divine powers, he had to learn how to read…
