512 Daoist Hei Tie Appears

“Of course, you can refuse, but I won’t take your refusal into account because I want to teach you a lesson!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Gao Shun turned into a streak of light, his mystic lord realm cultivation erupting as he rushed toward Han Tai.

At this moment, everyone present was stunned.

“A peak-level mystic lord realm expert!”

!!

“Wasn’t Chief Gao Shun a middle-stage mystic lord realm expert?”

Seeing Gao Shun charge at him menacingly, Han Tai panicked and activated his magic weapon to try and resist the attack.

However, Gao Shun’s casual attack actually sent him flying several hundred meters away.

The strength of a peak-level mystic lord realm expert was not something that an early-stage mystic lord realm cultivator like Han Tai could withstand.

After sending Han Tai flying with another slap, Gao Shun was inwardly delighted.

After reaching the peak of the mystic lord realm, he felt extraordinary. Even beating people up became much easier and more pleasant.

To be honest, Gao Shun was actually still grateful to Ye Xuan.

Without him, he would not have been able to defeat his inner demons and would never have had the chance to reach the peak of the mystic lord realm.

Thanks to Ye Xuan’s words back then, Gao Shun had clearly realized the inappropriateness of his past actions. After returning to his cultivation, he had finally defeated his inner demons and reached the peak of the mystic lord realm.

Now that his strength had been greatly improved, Han Tai felt like he was facing an invincible opponent.

If Ye Xuan was also here at this time, Gao Shun would probably want to spar with the former too. Thankfully, Han Tai would make for a good punching bag.

“Damn it!”

Han Tai’s face turned even colder due to how powerless he felt. He could not take it anymore.

Things had already come to this point. If he continued to tolerate this, then he would have no dignity in the future.

Thinking this, Han Tai did not hesitate to raise his long saber, mobilizing the strength of his whole body, and then swing it toward Gao Shun.

Under the tyrannical pressure of a mystic lord realm expert, the ground began to shake.

When they noticed this, the nearby cultivators instantly turned pale and kept retreating to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

At this moment, Gao Shun was still very calm. He raised his right hand and said, “Come on! Let me have a good look at your strength.”

As soon as his words fell, the huge sword reappeared in Gao Shun’s hand, which he then casually swung, releasing an even fiercer aura.

The two attacks collided, but Han Tai’s attack immediately collapsed, and he had no power to resist at all.

However, Gao Shun did not intend to end it there. Moments later, he appeared directly behind Han Tai and punched him mercilessly.

The power of the punch severely injured Han Tai. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.

After seeing Han Tai in that helpless state, Gao Shun’s expression turned contemptuous, and he raised his head high and said, “The Supreme Divine sect has an undeserved reputation.”

Hearing this, Han Tai vomited blood again. His whole body swayed and he almost fainted.

However, at this moment, an extremely loud voice was heard.

“This Fellow Daoist is looking down on our Supreme Divine sect too much…”

After a short while, an old man in a black robe appeared in the sky.

Seeing this, Gao Shun’s brows furrowed briefly, but he snorted coldly shortly after.

“I thought it was some expert, but it’s just the grand elder of the Supreme Divine sect, Daoist Hei Tie.”

“You’re probably here to try and rescue the dignity of the Supreme Divine sect, aren’t you?”

Daoist Hei Tie first glared at Han Tai. The anger in his heart was self-evident.

He already had a rough idea of what had just happened.

Their disciple failed to defeat one of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s disciples in a fight, and was injured instead. Then, one thing led to another, and things had unfolded in this manner.

This was originally a small matter. After all, who in this world could remain undefeated?

Only by learning from failure could one grow.

However, what made Daoist Hei Tie extremely angry was that Han Tai’s solution was too rash.

Moreover, Han Tai could not beat Gao Shun. Was this not simply a disgrace to the sect?

After thinking about it for a while, Daoist Hei Tie figured out how to deal with this matter. After all, they were in the wrong.

“Fellow Daoist Gao Shun, let’s put an end to this matter. However, shouldn’t you give us an explanation for slandering the Supreme Divine sect?”

“What a joke! Elder Hei Tie, why should I give you an explanation? I’ve said it before, the Great Wilderness Divine sect doesn’t need you or your sect to tell us what to do, and we don’t need to give you any explanation.”

“Also, today’s matter is completely your Supreme Divine sect’s fault. If you’re unhappy about it, then just come at me directly. I’m not afraid of you!”

“If I remember correctly, you were defeated by my senior brother a long time ago. Now, your disciple was defeated by my junior brother’s disciple. I really don’t understand how you still have the gall to talk about reputation with me, haha!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even after Daoist Hei Tie arrived, Gao Shun still disregarded him, causing everyone watching to become excited.

“My god, Chief Gao Shun is too awesome. He’s so domineering!”

Su Changhe said shamelessly. He was even thinking about how to please Gao Shun in the future so that he would gain another protector.

The people who were the most shocked were undoubtedly the people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Did the sun rise from the west today? Was Martial Uncle Gao always like this?”

At this moment, they could not help but admire him. As members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, their sense of belonging became even stronger.

After hearing this, Daoist Hei Tie’s face darkened.

Gao Shun’s words clearly indicated that he did not plan to give him any face. Today, their dignity had really suffered…
