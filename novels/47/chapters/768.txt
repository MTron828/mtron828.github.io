769 Ye Xuan Arrives

“Godsword?”

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, everyone instantly understood that Ye Xuan had taken action. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

By this time, the Godsword had already reached the huge palm.

Bang!

“Ahhh…”

In the sky, the strange monster’s expression changed drastically as a giant hole was pierced into its palm.

It could scarcely believe that this was happening. In the East continent, thus far, the only person who could harm it was Mengyu.

The strange monster roared angrily as it stared at the broken sword.

“Who is it? Hurry up and get out here so I can cut you into pieces!”

Its furious roar reverberated throughout the entire East continent. It kept glancing left and right, trying to find the attacker.

Down below, the Yuelun had been still quietly waiting for the arrival of her death, but when she heard the strange monster’s angry roar, she frowned and widened her eyes in confusion.

When she noticed the Godsword floating in front of her, she could not help but smile brightly.

Was Ye Xuan here?

Yuelun immediately turned around, trying to find Ye Xuan’s figure. However, before she could find him, a huge door had already appeared in the sky, which emitted a terrifying aura, causing everyone’s hearts to skip a beat as they watched without blinking.

Moments later, a figure walked out calmly and stared at the strange monster from afar. This figure released an even more formidable aura, which pressed down on the surroundings like a huge mountain.

In an instant, all of the berserk beasts within a hundred miles were pressed to the ground.

“It’s actually you.”

After seeing who had arrived, the strange monster frowned. It recognized Ye Xuan’s aura from the aura he released after he finished his seclusion. This person was the reason why it had made its way over here, even ignoring the besieged Supreme Divine sect along the way.

“Are you shocked?”

Ye Xuan hovered next to his sword and looked at the strange monster in front of him. When everyone on Sky Mountain saw that Ye Xuan had arrived, their expressions blossomed with joy, as if they had seen their savior.

“We’re saved! Chief Ye Xuan is finally here to save us!”

“With Chief Ye Xuan here, the crisis can be resolved!”

“The Sword Immortal is here! Did you see that attack? He completely blew that monster’s hand away!”

“With him guarding this place, who can hurt us?”

In the sky, after the strange monster heard Ye Xuan’s teasing words, its heart burned with anger.

However, Ye Xuan’s powerful aura acted as a deterrent. Furthermore, there was a sense of lingering fear after that last sword strike.

Earlier, Ye Xuan had only been controlling the Godsword from afar, yet had managed to basically destroy its palm.

“Ahaha, this is getting interesting.”

After saying that, the strange monster instantly mobilized its power and its palm recovered.

“You’re a decent, human,” it said coldly, “You’re enough for me to break a sweat, but nothing more.”

“I was careless just now, which allowed your attack to succeed. Now I’ll use both my hands. Are you mentally prepared?”

After hearing the arrogant words of this monster, Ye Xuan sneered.

What was the meaning of this? Was this monster really trying to show off now?

“Junior Brother Ye, you have to be careful. This monster’s attack is very strange,” Yuelun reminded him worriedly.

Ye Xuan smiled faintly and helped her smooth out her messy hair.

“Don’t worry, leave this to me. Yuelun, you can return to the rear first.”

After hearing this, Yuelun’s heart was filled with warmth. She understood how strong he was, and that her presence here would only hinder him.”

Thus, Yuelun returned to the defensive line without hesitation.

After Yuelun returned to the line, Ye Xuan turned around and stared coldly at the monster in the sky.

At this moment, this strange monster was forming a seal with both hands. Then, dense black fog appeared out of thin air and surrounded Ye Xuan in an instant.

“Hehe, I’m really looking forward to you becoming my servant.”

This strange monster was obviously full of confidence in the strange power, believing that no one could maintain consciousness under its influence.

Before long, this would be controlled by the strange power and become his servant.

Looking at this scene, everyone was stunned.

“What exactly happened? Why didn’t Ye Xuan dodge?”

“He could have dodged it…”

An inexplicable sense of panic rose in their hearts.

If Ye Xuan was really controlled by the strange power, would he not attack them instead? That would be a disaster and would spell the end of their resistance.

After this, the strange monster laughed wantonly, more black fog surrounded Ye Xuan tightly, trying to devour his consciousness.
