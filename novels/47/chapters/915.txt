916 Life Partner

Under the watchful eyes of everyone at the East Sea, Ye Xuan pinched Yanran’s face unabashedly and asked, “Yanran, was I awesome just now?”

Hearing this sentence, Yanran was momentarily stunned, but replied anyway, “Of course you were.”

“Was I handsome?”

“Yeah, you’re also very handsome.”

Seeing the two of them showing off their affection in public, everyone felt like cursing. They had been waiting around to see if there would be any more fighting, but were instead treated to a romance drama.

“Seriously, let’s hurry up and leave…”

On the other hand, after seeing Yanran like this, Li Xuanzhen and the others were stunned, and their gazes turned serious. The others might not understand, but they all knew that Yanran was also one of the inheritors of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Saintess.

There were several inheritors, and each of them was a genius in their respective worlds, so the competition to become the successor was intense.

It was precisely because of this that on their path of cultivation, every choice they made was important, including the matter of selecting their life partners.

Li Xuanzhen and the others knew that the other inheritors in the other worlds were still single.

After all, from their perspective, choosing their life partner was not something to be taken lightly. The right life partner would be able to spur them on in cultivation, and also journey with them as they got stronger and stronger.

It was precisely because of this that they had to think carefully about this matter. However, it seemed that Yanran had already chosen hers.

Li Xuanzhen was really interested in the specifics. Could it be that Yanran did not know how important this choice was to her? Or could it be that to her, Ye Xuan was already a very good choice?

“Interesting. This matter has become even more interesting…”

Li Xuanzhen’s mouth slowly curled into a smile. Having witnessed Ye Xuan’s strength, he had to admit that the other party was indeed talented.

If he was allowed to develop further, when he and Yanran ascended to the Heavenly Dao World, he might be able to help her successfully fight for the position of successor.

“Hahaha, Junior Brother Nanfeng, it seems that Junior Sister Yanran already has someone in her heart. In your opinion, what will happen after the senior brothers in the Heavenly Dao World find out about this?”

Nanfeng waved his hand when he heard Li Xuan’s joking words. He understood his seniors very well. Those senior brothers were all geniuses, and thus were all arrogant. Each of them believed that only the successor of the Saintess was a worthy partner.

It was for this reason that they had not chosen a cultivation partner for a long time and had been waiting for the appearance of the successor.

However, who would have thought that one of the inheritors would be snatched away before she even reached the Heavenly Dao World?

If they knew about this matter, they would probably want to swallow Ye Xuan alive.

“In my opinion, Junior Martial Brother Ye’s future path will probably be a little difficult,” Nanfeng sighed as he replied.

On the other hand, Ou Tian was extremely displeased. After all, he was also one of the people who had designs on the Saintess’ successor. Therefore, seeing Ye Xuan snatch an inheritor away, his hatred grew.

Originally, he wanted to show off in front of Yanran, but it seemed that his plan had been thwarted. He would definitely deal with this fellow properly when he ascended to the Heavenly Dao World. As for his future life partner, perhaps he would have to target the other inheritors now.

No matter what, being able to become the Saintess’s Dao companion was an opportunity. If he missed this opportunity, he would regret it for the rest of his life.

After enjoying some lovey-dovey moments, Yanran remembered that she had other things to do and immediately pulled away from Ye Xuan.

She turned around and looked at Li Xuanzhen and the others.

“Senior Brothers, the matter has been concluded. Thank you for coming over here to help.”

Li Xuanzhen was somewhat speechless. It was true that they had come to help, but in the end, they had not actually done anything. This was a little embarrassing. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Haha, Junior Sister Yanran, there’s no need for that. Even though we came, we didn’t help much.”

After Li Xuanzhen said that, he turned his gaze to Ye Xuan and said, “Junior Brother Ye, our first meeting today has indeed given me a great surprise.”

“If we didn’t come here today, we wouldn’t have known that such a brilliant expert had appeared in the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“When I return to the Great Wilderness Divine sect, I’ll definitely tell the elder about this. Knowing him, he’ll be very excited by the news.”

Ye Xuan nodded and smiled.

At the very least, this fellow was humble and friendly, unlike Ou Tian who was arrogant and condescending.
