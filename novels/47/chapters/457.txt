458 Incident

Elder Tongtian, who was at the side, also turned to look at Gongsun Shouyue with a puzzled expression on his face.

At this moment, Mu Beichen suddenly appeared and seemed to be reporting something to Elder Tongtian.

“Eh? Could something big have happened?”

“What’s going on? ” Ye Xuan was a little surprised when he saw this. He then asked Yuelun, who was beside him.

The latter also felt a little puzzled.

Su Changhe hurried over and explained to Ye Xuan.

“Chief Ye Xuan, Father just sent me an urgent message. Yesterday, a Black Tortoise carrying a huge coffin suddenly appeared in the depths of the archaic divine mountains!”

“The moment the Black Tortoise appeared, it caused a huge commotion in the East continent. Furthermore, its appearance caused the beasts in the archaic divine mountains to go berserk and attack the humans around them.”

“In just one night, a heaven-shaking battle broke out in the archaic divine mountains, and there were corpses piled up everywhere.”

“Also, they aren’t just killing humans, but each other too. Some people think that they’re fighting over the ownership of the coffin carried by the Black Tortoise.”

“It’s very likely that there’s a great treasure in the coffin!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan frowned.

‘Could it be that this Black Tortoise came out of the ancient tomb?’

He had discovered an ancient tomb in the depths of the archaic divine mountains. Of course, other experts had also discovered this ancient tomb.

If the appearance of the Black Tortoise and coffin was related to this, then it might be a sign that the ancient tomb was about to open.

According to Ye Xuan’s previous prediction, it would only open after the end of the Seven Peaks competition, and he would have enough time to break through to the Supreme realm.

From the looks of it now, some unforeseen event must have happened in the archaic divine mountains that caused the ancient tomb to open in advance.

The archaic divine mountains were not only full of ferocious beasts, but they were also the lifeline of the East continent. Any changes there would affect the East continent significantly.

‘Mm! After the Seven Peaks competition, I will make a trip there,’ Ye Xuan thought for a moment and made a decision.

Su Changhe spoke again, “Chief Ye Xuan, please be at ease. Father has already sent our family’s experts to the archaic divine mountains to investigate the situation. Once there is any news, I will definitely inform you as soon as possible!”

“En!” Ye Xuan was very satisfied.

It seemed like Su Tiansheng was going to be a valuable ally of Cloud Sky peak. Ye Xuan naturally felt the Su family’s sincerity, but he had not thought of how to return the favor.

Ye Xuan glanced at Su Changhe.

‘Hmm, this guy is not bad.’

After a few days of contact, Ye Xuan had a basic understanding of Su Changhe’s character and personality.

Although he was a good-for-nothing hedonistic young master in the past, he had changed somewhat. There was still a chance to save him.

Of course, now was not a good time to take in a disciple. In the future, he would carefully observe and temper this fellow’s heart.

“Mm, got it. You may leave!” I’m not afraid,” Ye Xuan said indifferently and calmly.

Su Changhe heaved a sigh of relief and went over to admire the beauties with a face full of joy. He could not be bothered to care about what would happen to the archaic divine mountains. In any case, he had Ye Xuan as his backer now, so what was there to be afraid of?

In a short while, Yuelun also received the news from Li Hanyi’s family.

She glanced at Ye Xuan briefly, but did not say anything.

After a while, the battle ended.

Although Feng Xiyun had relied on her heaven-grade divine power to fight with Li Hanyi on even terms at the beginning, Li Hanyi’s strength still prevailed in the end when Feng Xiyun ran out of spiritual power.

Yuelun was relieved by this, but was also quite shocked that a battle between cultivators with such a gap in strength had lasted so long.

Ye Xuan truly was a teacher like no other.

After Feng Xiyun returned to Ye Xuan’s side, she said with a face full of disappointment, “Teacher, I’m sorry. I lost to Senior Sister Li Hanyi!”

Ye Xuan simply smiled.

“Don’t worry about it. As a first-level materialization realm cultivator, being able to hold on for so long is something admirable and praiseworthy.”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, her dim expression brightened up.

She had been worried about disappointing her teacher, but soon found out that her worries were unfounded.

“Senior Sister, I’ll be counting on you for the rest of the competition,” Feng Xiyun said to Zhuge Yueyue.

“En!”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded and said to Ye Xuan with a respectful expression, “Teacher, I’m going!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue turned around and walked towards the arena.

The eyes of the onlookers lit up. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Over the past few days, Zhuge Yueyue had defeated her opponents with one move. Furthermore, she had never unsheathed the Cloud Sky Sword.

Would they be lucky enough to see it today?

“Zhuge Yueyue of Cloud Sky peak versus Xiao Beichen of Returning Cloud peak!”

“Both participants, please get ready!”

A handsome young man with a long black spear slowly walked up to the arena. His entire being exuded monstrous fighting spirit, like an invincible God of War.

Everyone’s eyes lit up when they saw this.

“This is going to be a good show!”

“The eldest disciple of Cloud Sky peak versus the eldest disciple of Returning Cloud peak. Both of them are terrifyingly strong and candidates to win the competition. I didn’t expect them to meet here.”

“Xiao Beichen is a peerless genius from Returning Cloud peak, and he’s extremely powerful! In this competition, aside from Gao Tianyu, he’s the strongest cultivator.”

...

“Zhuge Yueyue may be strong, but I don’t think she’s a match for Xiao Beichen!”
