Chapter 278: Ye Xuan, You B*stard!

Time passed slowly, and in the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.

Miaoling Region, Luo Heaven Palace.

Shangguan Wa ‘er sat quietly on her throne, and the jade token Ye Xuan left behind appeared in her hand again.

After struggling for half a year, Shangguan Wan’er had finally made a decision.

After half a year of reflection, Shangguan Wan’er decided to give up her pride as the reincarnation of an ancient great empress and her dignity as the master of the Luo Heaven Palace to become Ye Xuan’s disciple.

“This is just a deal I’m making in order to become stronger!”

“When my strength recovers to the peak of my previous life, I’ll reimburse him for his troubles in the future,” Shangguan Wan’er said stubbornly.

Moments later, she crushed the jade token.

After that, she waited quietly in the main hall.

In the blink of an eye, a day passed.

Two days!

Five days!

Fifteen days!

As more and more time passed, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression gradually turned ugly.

“Ye Xuan!”

“You b*stard! You actually dared to mess with me like this!”

Shangguan Wan’er gritted her teeth in anger, and a terrifying aura erupting from her body.

She was boiling with anger!

Other than anger, she felt embarrassed and awkward.

Over the past six months, she had struggled internally before finally convincing herself to do this.

However, after waiting half a month, she did not even see Ye Xuan’s shadow!

Fortunately, this was a matter between the two of them, so her reputation remained intact.

Her aura spread throughout Luo Heaven Palace, which frightened the cultivators there.

The closer they got to the palace master’s hall, the more they could sense her bone-chilling aura.

Who was it that made the palace master angry?

No one dared to ask!

“Detestable! How could I believe that b*stard’s nonsense?”

“I was too naive!”

Shangguan Wan’er took a deep breath as she tried to calm her agitated emotions.

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, Shangguan Wan’er’s figure turned into a streak of light and disappeared before reappearing outside.

“Greetings, palace master!”

The cultivators of Luo Heaven Palace quickly greeted her with respect.

No one knew Shangguan Wan’er’s exact cultivation level, only that she was almost invincible in the Miaoling Region.

When Shangguan Wan’er had established the Luo Heaven Palace, she had beaten up almost every super force in the Miaoling Region. No one was her match.

Of course, there were still some old monsters with terrifying strength in the Miaoling Region, but these existences did not act.

“I’m going to leave the Miaoling Region to do something in the Nanzhou Region for some time.”

“All of you, cultivate well!”

After giving a simple briefing, Shangguan Wan’er disappeared.

After crossing nearly twenty regions, Shangguan Wan’er finally arrived in the Nanzhou Region.

Qingyun sect of the Great Qian Dynasty.

“Is this the sect Ye Xuan is from?”

Shangguan Wan’er looked at the Qingyun sect and narrowed her eyes.

Although the spiritual energy density here was greater than the rest of the Great Qian Dynasty, it paled in comparison to the Luo Heaven Palace.

Shangguan Wan’er was also an outstanding formation master, alchemist, and artifact refiner. These were the benefits of having memories from her previous life.

After all, some experts from the ancient era would study many things when they were bored after their strength reached a bottleneck.

When the Luo Heaven Palace was first established, Shangguan Wan’er had chosen the place with the densest spiritual energy in the Miaoling Region and had set up a powerful formation there.

Not only could it absorb the surrounding spiritual energy from all over the Miaoling Region, but it could also extract void power from the spatial turbulence.

Therefore, not to mention the Great Qian Dynasty, there was no sect in the entire Nanzhou Region that could compare.

How had such a barren place actually given birth to a monstrous genius like Ye Xuan? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This fellow is definitely hiding his strength. There’s no way he’s just a unity realm expert.”

“He’s very likely surpassed the pattern condensation realm. Perhaps there’s some reason why he’s living in such a backward place!”

In her opinion, Ye Xuan was living here to avoid the attention of the top expert of the Tianyuan continent.

After all, being noticed by those almighty experts might not be a good thing, especially those from other races, who might try to assassinate him.

Buzzzzzz!

Just as Shangguan Wan’er arrived at the Qingyun sect, the space not far away suddenly rippled, and Jun Lingtian’s figure appeared.

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er only spared Jun Lingtian a brief glance before ignoring him.

What puzzled her was that she could not detect Ye Xuan’s aura in the Qingyun sect.
