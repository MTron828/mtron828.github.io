362 Are You Sure?

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue inwardly snickered. She wanted to laugh out loud, but she still had to put on a show.

Previously, in the meeting hall, no one had wanted her as their disciple due to her mediocre talent. Only Ye Xuan had given her a chance.

Moreover, without Ye Xuan’s help, she would not have been able to awaken the profound ice divine bone.

Now, these people shamelessly wanted to steal her from him.

How could she possibly agree to such a farcical request?

“I’m thankful for Sect Master’s kind intentions. However, since I have already become Teacher’s disciple, I will not betray him.”

“Besides, Teacher is the only one on Cloud Sky peak. Without me to care for him, what would Teacher do?”

Zhuge Yueyue rejected him without hesitation.

Hearing this, Gongsun Shouyue’s expression froze. He retracted his hand awkwardly.

He could read between the lines.

Ye Xuan had been on Cloud Sky peak for a hundred years. He was not a disabled person, so why would he need anyone to take care of him?

“Forget it then. Since you’ve made your choice, I won’t force you!”

“Martial Niece, did your teacher teach you the cultivation method before entering seclusion?”

“Time is of the essence in cultivation, especially since you’re at the golden age and have awakened your divine bone. Cultivators are usually in secluded cultivation for a few months to a few years, so we shouldn’t let your cultivation be delayed by this.”

Gongsun Shouyue spoke up again.

If Ye Xuan was negligent, he would teach her on his behalf.

After all, no matter what, Zhuge Yueyue was still a member of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. He could not allow her talent to go to waste.

“Don’t worry, Sect Master. Teacher has already passed on the cultivation method to me.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Gao Shun heard that, the corners of his mouth revealed a hint of a mocking smile.

“What kind of high-level cultivation method can that piece of trash Ye Xuan have? It’s a pity that the divine bone in your body is going to be wasted in the hands of that trash!”

Hearing this, Gongsun Shouyue looked at Gao Shun unhappily before turning his gaze back to Zhuge Yueyue.

“Martial Niece, can I take a look at your current cultivation progress?”

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue hesitated for a moment before she nodded in agreement.

Then, Gongsun Shouyue waved his sleeve and a ray of light fell on Zhuge Yueyue. His expression changed.

When Gao Shun saw this, he was curious, “Senior Brother, is there something wrong? Did that trash Ye Xuan really cripple her?”

“How is this possible? She’s actually reached the fourth level of the mystic meridian realm!”

“If I remember correctly, you’ve only been in the Great Wilderness Divine sect for four days, and no cultivation to speak of before this. Even if you awakened a high-grade divine bone, you shouldn’t have broken through so quickly.”

Gongsun Shouyue’s eyes were filled with shock.

When Gao Shun heard this, he felt like he had eaten dog sh*t.

Previously, in the meeting hall, he had paid a great price to snatch the young man with the divine bone from Liang Dahai.

However, even now, that young man could barely sense the existence of spiritual energy.

However, this girl who originally had no cultivation aptitude had actually broken through to the fourth level of the mystic meridian realm in a short four days?

“How is this possible? Senior Brother, are you sure you’re not mistaken? Let me take a look!”

Gao Shun did not believe it at all. He hurriedly stretched out his hand and pointed at Zhuge Yueyue. Light suddenly enveloped Zhuge Yueyue’s body, and his face instantly turned ashen.

‘F*ck!’

‘This is definitely fake. I must be dreaming!’

Gao Shun’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

The more he thought about the difference between Zhuge Yueyue and that young man, the angrier he got.

Ever since he had snatched the young man from Liang Dahai, he had been showing off in front of the other chiefs over the past few days.

However, a piece of trash that he had always looked down upon had actually nurtured a disciple that far surpassed his own.

Furthermore, this girl who originally had no divine bones and had mediocre talent had awakened the profound ice divine bone.

“What’s wrong? Is there something wrong, Martial Uncle Gao?” Zhuge Yueyue looked at Gao Shun indifferently.

She did not know why, but when she saw the latter’s expression of disbelief, it brought her an immense amount of satisfaction.

Thankfully, none of the other chiefs had chosen her back then. Otherwise, she would not have had the opportunity to become Ye Xuan’s disciple and receive those two pills.

She was well aware that even if these chiefs, or even the sect master, had such a pill as valuable as the heavenly marrow pill, they would never give it to their disciples.

This was the difference between them and Ye Xuan!

Gao Shun was livid.

If Gongsun Shouyue was not beside him, he might have lost his temper.

Even so, Gao Shun gave Zhuge Yueyue a warning look, as if to say, ‘don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you’ve awakened the profound ice divine bone. Your teacher is trash, so you’ll end up as trash too!’

Compared to Gao Shun, Gongsun Shouyue’s heart was filled with shock.

‘What’s going on? Could the rumors be false? Is Junior Brother Ye Xuan’s talent actually not mediocre?’

‘It seems that I have to change my attitude toward Cloud Sky peak.’

Gongsun Shouyue sized up Zhuge Yueyue once again. He had already made a decision.

However, he specifically turned back to look at Gao Shun.

He was extremely clear in his heart that Gao Shun’s opinion of Ye Xuan had always been one of disdain.

The reason for this was that Tian Xuan and Gao Shun had always been at odds with each other.

Due to Tian Xuan’s formidable strength, even if he was the only member of Cloud Sky peak, he could still suppress the Hidden Sword peak easily.

Due to this, after Tian Xuan passed away, Gao Shun took every opportunity to hit back while Cloud Sky peak was at its lowest
