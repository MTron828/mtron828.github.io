384 Stealing A Disciple?

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

“What are you saying, girl? I was helping you vent your anger, alright?”

“I know. Teacher is the best to me. I knew that Teacher would never let others bully me!”

Zhuge Yueyue smiled and hugged Ye Xuan’s arm.

At first, she had been a little worried. The other party was from a powerful family in the Yangli divine empire. If her teacher offended him because of her, there would be a lot of trouble in the future.

However, Ye Xuan had always been a protective person, so how could he allow his own disciple to be bullied by others?

“Little girl, it’s good that you understand my intentions.”

Ye Xuan smiled and patted Zhuge Yueyue’s head.

“My precious disciple, haven’t you always wanted to go home and take a look? Let’s go!”

“There won’t be many opportunities to come back, so we should make haste.”

“Mm! Teacher, please follow me!”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head obediently and led the way.

The town that they were in was Zhuge Yue Yue’s hometown.

Moments later, Ye Xuan and Zhuge Yueyue arrived in front of a dilapidated building. The buildings next to them had collapsed on the ground, covered in smoke and dust.

Zhuge Yueyue stood at a corner of the wall. Her gaze fell on the burnt black mural on the wall, completely stunned.

The mural on the wall was probably drawn by her when she was young.

Ye Xuan stood quietly at the side and did not disturb her.

Of course, Ye Xuan was not completely idle. His spiritual sense quietly swept out to examine the surroundings.

Suddenly, Ye Xuan noticed subtle fluctuations.

At the same time, several figures suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s field of vision.

‘It’s them!’

Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes.

It was Yuelun and her disciples.

“Xue’er, is this your hometown?”

Li Hanyi asked Li Xue’er curiously as she looked at the ruins.

Li Xue’er’s eyes were full of tears. She was searching the ruins frantically, as if she was looking for something.

“Ye Xuan!”

Suddenly, Yuelun noticed Ye Xuan, who was not far away, and walked over with a curious expression.

“Junior Brother Ye, why are you here?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as she said this, she saw Zhuge Yueyue in the corner and suddenly understood.

Li Hanyi, who had been following behind Yuelun, looked at Ye Xuan curiously.

‘Is that Ye Xuan, the youngest chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?’

‘Oh my God, he’s so handsome!’

Ever since Yuelun had returned from Cloud Sky peak and vented her frustrations, all of the cultivators from Water Sky peak had been filled with curiosity about Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan looked at Yuelun and the others with an indifferent expression.

“I’ve just brought my disciple to the outside world to gain experience. Since we were out here, I brought her to her hometown to take a look.”

“Disciple Li Hanyi greets Martial Uncle Ye Xuan!”

At this moment, Li Hanyi, who was standing behind Yuelun, stepped forward with a respectful expression and bowed to Ye Xuan.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan glanced in her direction. Then, his eyes lit up.

‘Woah, it seems that the disciples of Water Sky peak are all really pretty. Perhaps they all take after their master.’

It was no wonder the other male cultivators of the Great Wilderness Divine sect liked to visit Water Sky peak.

Although he was slightly startled, Ye Xuan’s expression was still as steady as a mountain.

“You must be the eldest disciple of Water Sky peak, right? You’re quite well-known.”

“You, Hua Rufeng, and Gao Tianyu are known as the three geniuses of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. It seems you’re worthy of your title.”

Ye Xuan could sense that Li Hanyi’s cultivation had already reached the first level of the materialization realm.

To have reached such a level at such a young age was enough to show how terrifying Li Hanyi’s level of talent was.

Hearing this, Li Hanyi was overjoyed, but she still put on a humble appearance.

“Martial Uncle Ye Xuan, you’re too kind. Hanyi’s talent is mediocre. How can I be compared to Brother?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned.

Yuelun smiled.

“This girl and Hua Rufeng are biological siblings. It’s just that one of them follows the father’s surname and the other follows the mother’s.”

“I see.”

Ye Xuan revealed a look of realization.

At this moment, Yuelun’s lips curved into a smile as she looked at Ye Xuan meaningfully.

“Hanyi, I’ve never seen your Martial Uncle Ye speak so highly of anyone. Since he thinks highly of you, you should hurry up and ask him for advice.”

“If your Martial Uncle is in a good mood, he might give you a divine-rank artifact, or teach you a high-level sword technique!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

What did this woman mean? She was clearly trying to mooch treasures off him!

When Li Hanyi heard this, she immediately understood and said with a smile, “Okay, Teacher. In the future, when I have free time, I’ll definitely go to Cloud Sky peak to ask Martial Uncle Ye Xuan for advice on my cultivation.”

“Martial uncle Ye Xuan is a kind person. I don’t think he’ll refuse me, right?”

Ye Xuan’s heart was filled with curses.

These ladies were really good at acting.

“Cough, cough! It’s not a big problem. Cloud Sky peak is quite empty, so it’s good that you can come and cultivate with Yueyue.”

“Aside from asking questions about cultivation, even if you were to become my disciple, I would still accept it.”

“I’ll never withhold any treasures or secret techniques from the disciples of Cloud Sky peak.”

Li Hanyi’s eyes lit up.

She had heard from Li Xue’er that Ye Xuan had given Zhuge Yueyue high-level spiritual pills as soon as she joined Cloud Sky peak. He had even given her the Cloud Sky sword, which was the representative artifact of Cloud Sky peak’s heritage.

Furthermore, he had been willing to infuse Zhuge Yueyue with ten years’ worth of cultivation.

In the entire East continent, only Chief Ye Xuan would treat his disciple so well.
