553 Couple Set

Seeing Ye Xuan and Yanran acting so lovey-dovey, the onlookers were completely dumbfounded. It made them feel uncomfortable.

They were simply out of line. If they wanted to show off their affection for each other, they should have given them the chance to leave first.

It was too much!

Many people’s faces darkened at their behavior, even Mo Yunhai.

!!

“Ahem, since there’s nothing else going on, I’ll take my leave first.”

“Why are you in such a hurry? Sigh, forget it, I’ll go with you.”

Before long, the onlookers started leaving one after the other. There was no point in torturing themselves watching these two lovebirds.

“Ding! Congratulations on becoming Yanran’s official boyfriend. You can start the lottery draw now!”

‘Haha, I’ve been waiting for this. Let’s go!’

After receiving Ye Xuan’s confirmation, the system’s notification rang out again as the lottery wheel turned.

“Ding! Congratulations, you have obtained divine-rank magical artifacts from the lottery wheel. It is a limited edition set, including rainbow clothes and rainbow dress.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

‘What’s this?’

Ye Xuan was stunned. He took a serious look at the treasure he had drawn.

It was actually a couple set…

“Heavens!”

Even Ye Xuan, who had seen many things, could not help but exclaim at this moment.

The defensive properties of this limited-edition couple set was too strong. It was comparable to a turtle shell.

Unless one used some sort of attack with special properties, even an sealed immortal realm expert would not be able to do anything to someone wearing this by relying on pure strength!

In this case, would he not be able to act tyrannically in front of his enemies while wearing this set of clothes?

With the Cloud Heaven Sword and these rainbow clothes, he could cut down anyone he did not like from now on.

How awesome!

Giving away the immortal heavenly treasure was truly worth it.

Moreover, this was a couple set. When the couple wore these matching outfits, it would activate other amazing effects.

While Ye Xuan was immersed in happiness, another system notification rang out.

“Ding! Because you have given the immortal heavenly treasure to Yanran, you have received a 10,000x critical reward. You have received a higher grade immortal heavenly treasure, a chaos immortal peach.”

‘Phew… chaos immortal peach! I’ve hit the jackpot again!’

Ye Xuan was so happy that he could not speak. Luck really came in droves.

It seemed that he would be able to break through to the ancient realm soon. He had only just reached the supreme realm too. If things progressed in this manner, would he not reach the sealed immortal realm sooner or later?

‘Hahaha, it won’t be long before I become the number one expert in the eight continents!’

Then, seeing Yanran standing beside him quietly, Ye Xuan pulled her over and kissed her.

At this moment, Yanran’s mind was completely blank.

What was going on?

Looking at Ye Xuan’s smiling face, Yanran asked in confusion.

“What’s going on? Why are you so happy all of a sudden?”

“Ahem, it’s nothing. I was just excited,” Ye Xuan smiled and replied indifferently.

“Why are you so excited all of a sudden?”

Yanran was very confused, but moments later, Ye Xuan’s entire body emitted a seven-colored light as he changed into a new set of clothes.

After changing into this set of clothes, Yanran felt that Ye Xuan’s entire body was releasing an immortal aura. However, if Ye Xuan did not deliberately reveal his aura, no one would notice it.

Most importantly, the defensive properties of this rainbow robe were really too strong. Even if Yanran attacked with all of her strength, she probably would not be able to harm Ye Xuan at all.

“This set of clothes…”

Yanran’s voice trembled as she spoke, not daring to believe what she was seeing.

Not only did Ye Xuan have a divine-rank sword, but he also had this divine-rank robe?

Was he some sort of moving treasury?

Why did he have so many treasures?

She felt that her boyfriend was shrouded in mystery at this point.

“Little Ran, take a look. What do you think of my outfit?”

Ye Xuan patted her head and asked.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s question, Yanran finally came back to her senses and examined Ye Xuan’s clothes.

“It’s very good. You look a lot more handsome in it.”

Yanran was not stingy with her praise as she looked at Ye Xuan with a starry-eyed gaze.

Hearing this, the smile on Ye Xuan’s face grew even wider, and he said straightforwardly, “I’ll also give you a set, how about it?”

Yanran was stunned and forgot to answer.

Could it be that Ye Xuan had another divine-rank robe?

That could not be, right?

...

Divine-rank artifacts were considered a rare existence in this world. Even the top sects might not have any.

Why did Ye Xuan have so many?

His net worth was probably comparable to several sects.

Her guess was right. Ye Xuan had already taken out another set of clothes and handed it to Yanran.

“This one is a dress. It matches the one I’m wearing. Put it on and let me have a good look at it.”

Looking at the dress, Yanran could not believe her eyes.

It glowed with seven-colored light, and the fabric used to make it was like the softest silk in the world. From the style, it could be seen that it really did match the one Ye Xuan was wearing.

Yanran’s mind was in a mess. She had already rewarded him with a kiss after accepting the immortal heavenly treasure. What should she reward him with after accepting this dress?
