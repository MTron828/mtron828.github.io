386 Ancient Beast’s Descendant

‘This is the innate divine jade?’

When Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense entered the system’s storage space, he discovered a jade stone exuding a divine aura. The spiritual power contained inside it was extremely terrifying.

If one carried it with them, not only could it increase one’s cultivation speed to a certain extent, but it also had a detoxification effect.

‘I didn’t expect to get such a benefit from teasing Senior Sister Yuelun!’

‘What an unexpected surprise!’

!!

Ye Xuan smiled, squinted his eyes, and stretched.

Not far away, Zhuge Yueyue wandered around in the ruins for half a day and finally found some items from her past.

Although they were not valuable items, they still contained the memories of her and her parents.

After doing all this, Zhuge Yueyue took a final look at her desolate home again, and then returned to Ye Xuan’s side with a determined look.

“Teacher, let’s leave!”

Ye Xuan patted Zhuge Yueyue’s head and asked gently, “Little girl, don’t you want to take a second look? The path of immortal cultivation is long and endless, and you may never have the chance to come back.”

Zhuge Yueyue turned around once again and took a deep look at her home. Then, sShe gritted her teeth and said with a determined look in her eyes, “I’ve already seen enough. Now that my parents are no longer around, staying here any longer is meaningless.”

“I’ll only end up sadder if we stay longer. Teacher, let’s go!”

“En!”

Ye Xuan did not say much. After all, ever since she chose to embark on the path of immortal cultivation, it meant that she would eventually have to cut off all contact with the mortal world.

No matter how sad she was, time would solve everything.

Yuelun and the others had already decided to leave as well.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan thought for a moment and decided to ask Yuelun where he should go next.

At this moment, a group of refugees suddenly fled from the dilapidated old town. They looked extremely panicked, as if something terrifying was chasing them from behind.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan reached out and grabbed an old man.

“Old man, what happened?”

“Young man, hurry up and run. The berserk beasts are coming again. If you don’t run, you’ll be eaten!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The old man who was stopped by Ye Xuan was extremely pale and terrified.

“Berserk beasts?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan narrowed his eyes and released the old man’s hand, who frantically ran away.

Ye Xuan’s gaze was focused in the direction where the refugees had fled from. Dust suddenly filled his vision, and the ground trembled slightly.

His spiritual sense immediately swept out.

Heaven realm!

“Its aura is extremely strong, and its bloodline is quite pure. Could it be a descendant of an ancient beast? ”

“What? Are you saying that it’s a descendant of an ancient beast?”

Yuelun, who had just heard the commotion, jumped in shock.

Everyone was confused.

Li Hanyi even asked, “Teacher, what are ancient beasts?”

“Other than the human race, there are many other powerful races in the mystic world. The Great Wilderness Divine sect, and even the entire Yangli divine empire occupy only a small portion of the East continent.”

“In the boundless divine mountains, there are many descendants of ancient beasts that have survived since ancient times. The blood of ancient beasts flows through their bodies.”

“Ancient beasts are extremely terrifying. With the support of their bloodline power, they are almost invincible within the same realm.”

“Even our human race’s geniuses might not be able to defeat an ancient beast of the same cultivation realm.”

Hearing this, everyone’s hearts were filled with shock, and the surrounding atmosphere suddenly became tense.

At this moment, Ye Xuan retracted his spiritual sense and looked up at the sky. He saw that several bright streaks of light were already flying in the direction of the ancient beast’s descendant.

“Let’s go over too!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan took Zhuge Yueyue’s hand and turned into a streak of light, flying in that direction.

Beside him, Yuelun did not fall behind and gave Li Hanyi a few instructions.

“Hanyi, bring your junior sisters along and quickly follow us!”

“Although the ancient beast’s descendant is powerful, it’s also extremely rare. If we can obtain its flesh and body parts, this trip will not have been in vain.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yuelun left with Li Xue’er. Li Hanyi followed suit with a few junior sisters.

At this moment, the boundless mountain was filled with flames that looked like they were going to burn everything in the world.

A monstrous killing intent gushed out from the eyes of a huge ape. Its brutal aura suddenly swept out, and its mountain-like fists pounded its chest ruthlessly as it roared toward the sky.

Above the ape, there were hundreds of figures.

These were all cultivators from the various holy lands, as well as young cultivators who had come out to train.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect my luck to be so good that I’d actually encounter an ancient beast’s descendant out here!”

“Elder Lin, Elder Li, you two have to stay on your toes. Once this ape is heavily injured by everyone, you have to seize the opportunity and snatch the precious bone inside its body for me!”

Su Changhe’s gaze fell on the violent ape, and his eyes were filled with greed.

Earlier, he was so frightened by Ye Xuan’s that he quickly sent a message to his family and called Li Tianhai, the only heaven realm cultivator in the family besides his father.

With Li Tianhai by his side, Su Changhe suddenly regained the confidence to be arrogant once more.

“Don’t worry, Young Master. I will do my best!”

Although Li Tianhai was a powerful heaven realm expert, his expression remained serious.

After all, there were many experts around from the various holy lands.

“Oh? I didn’t expect to meet Young Master Su in such a place! It’s only been a few days, how have you become so disheveled?”

At that moment, an enigmatic voice suddenly rang out in Su Changhe’s ears.

Su Changhe frowned when he heard that. He looked up with a slightly cold gaze and was greeted by the face of the person he hated the most.

The descendant of the Xia family of the Yangli divine empire, Charlot.

This guy was his sworn enemy.

However, Charlot’s sarcastic words were not surprising. After all, Su Changhe was still in a sorry state after running from Ye Xuan.

He had almost wet his pants and his whole body was covered in dust. His luxurious clothes had been torn apart by Ye Xuan’s sharp sword qi.

Su Changhe was about to flare up, but when his gaze fell on the two old men beside Charlot, he could only take a deep breath.

‘He’s just goading me. I’m not going to be fooled by this kind of hedonistic son who only relies on his family’s power.’

Su Changhe kept giving himself psychological cues to ignore Charlot’s existence.
