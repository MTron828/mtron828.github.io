580 Bidding War (Part 1)

What Feng Lu did not know was that no matter how hard they tried, his subordinates would not be able to find out anything about Ye Xuan.

After all, Ye Xuan was the chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak. There might be news about his feats in the secular world, but only cultivators who had come into contact with him before would be able to recognize him.

After some time passed, the auction began.

From his suite, Ye Xuan had a great view of the stage below.

!!

The lady in charge of the auction had already walked out. She hit the gavel onto the rostrum and said in a delicate voice, “Dear distinguished guests, the anticipated auction segment has arrived. We will first start with the secondary auction items.”

After that, another lady in revealing clothes slowly walked out with a box and placed it on the center of the stage.

When the crowd saw the auction item, they were shocked.

“It’s actually a high-grade magical treasure!”

“What’s going on today? There’s even a high-grade magic treasure up for grabs?”

At this moment, the crowd was already rubbing their hands in excitement. Meanwhile, opposite Suite 001, Feng Lu was also excited when he saw the auction item.

Ye Xuan happened to notice this, and he had already thought of something interesting to do to pass the time.

Seemingly sensing Ye Xuan’s ill intentions, Feng Lu stared at him, feeling very angry.

‘Tsk! You’re just a nobody who happens to have some sort of backing. Without your family, do you think that you would be qualified to be here?’

‘Just wait! Let’s see what items you bid for, kid!’

Feng Lu considered himself quite wealthy, and was determined to use his wealth to get back at Ye Xuan for the humiliation he had suffered earlier.

Moreover, he really wanted this high-grade magic treasure, so it was a win-win situation.

“This saber is called the Scarlet Flame Saber. It’s a high-grade magical treasure. I believe that all of you can tell that it’s definitely a very rare item.”

“Let’s get to it! The starting price of the Scarlet Flame Saber is 90,000 taels of profound silver. The distinguished guests can start bidding now!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the guests on the auction floor did not bid immediately. Instead, they looked up at those occupying the suites. After all, if these people were to bid, they would not be able to win. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As time passed, Suite 001 was the first to give a price.

“A hundred million taels!”

Everyone’s jaws dropped.

“Heavens!”

“They’re starting off with that price? Aren’t they pricing out everyone immediately?”

While the crowd was in a heated discussion, Feng Lu’s face darkened.

He stared at the one million taels sign in his hand that he had been about to raise. It seemed particularly ironic.

‘Damn it! Is this guy deliberately going against me?’

Looking at Ye Xuan, Feng Lu gritted his teeth in anger.

At this moment, he could almost imagine Ye Xuan’s mocking gaze.

“Prince Zhanglu, please don’t!”

However, he would not listen to his subordinate’s advice. He picked up a different sign and raised it, which frightened his subordinate even further.

“1 billion taels!”

When they saw Suite 002 bid, people exclaimed in surprise.

“Holy sh*t! Who are these two people? This is just the first item! Is there a need to be so competitive from the get-go?”

At this time, they could somewhat tell that the guests in the two suites were definitely not on good terms.

There was no other explanation for such impulsive bidding.

At this time, a beautiful woman in a red dress in Suite 003 looked in the direction of the two suites with a puzzled expression.

She turned around and instructed the servant beside her, “Go and find out who those people in these two suites are.”

“Understood,” a servant with an ice-cold expression said and slowly left the suite.

“Young Miss, are we going to participate in this auction?”

The woman in the red dress thought for a moment and said, “Forget it, let’s sit back and watch for now.”

“Our main goal is to investigate the strange power. We are not familiar with the situation in the Yangli divine empire, so it is best not to provoke these major families.”

“Alright,” another subordinate said as he turned his attention back to the situation on the stage.

After Feng Lu placed a bid of one billion taels of profound silver, the atmosphere was boiling over.

The lady in charge of the auction was dumbfounded.

Originally, she thought that this treasure would only sell for tens of millions taels of profound silver at most. Who would have thought that the guest in Suite 001 would immediately raise the price to 100 million taels?

The guest in Suite 002 was even more shocking, bidding one billion taels!

That was equivalent to 10 million taels of profound gold!

After making this bid, Feng Lu looked at Ye Xuan with a sneer as if saying, “If you have the ability, then continue bidding! Bring it on! I have plenty of money!”

Ye Xuan’s expression did not change at all when he noticed Feng Lu’s sneer. He smiled and bid again, increasing the bid by a mere 1,000 taels.

Feng Lu’s face turned extremely gloomy when he saw the provocative bid.

“This guy is trying to embarrass me, right?”

If Ye Xuan’s price was much higher than his, he would not have felt so incensed.

However, it was only an increase of 1,000 taels, and he felt as if someone had slapped him in the face.

...

After hearing the bid, the guests were on the verge of laughter.

“Isn’t this person clearly trying to make fun of the people in Suite 002?”

“He clearly has the money, but wants to piss off the other side.”

As the crowd stifled their laughter, the woman in the red dress in Suite 003 also covered her mouth and chuckled.

“This person is quite interesting. I wonder where he came from?”

From afar, she saw the man in Suite 001 wearing white.

Under the cover of the mask, even though she could not see his face, she could still tell that he was quite young, and seemed to have an elegant disposition.

“Damn it!”

Feng Lu stood up in anger…
