472 Beasts’ Invasion

However, Ye Xuan did not want to enter the supreme realm immediately.

As he had comprehended karmic intent on the Tianyuan continent, even though it had been forcefully refined by the system during his journey through the realm passageway, there was still a sliver of it left in his body.

He had an inexplicable feeling that a great change was about to happen.

“These Torrential Pear Blossom needles are pretty good, but it’s a pity that I don’t need them at the moment.”

!!

Ye Xuan played with the needles for a while, then put them inside his storage ring.

These Torrential Pear Blossom needles were exactly the same as the Tang sect secret weapons in his previous life. Once they were used, they would ignore any barriers or artifacts.

Not only that, if they managed to reach their target’s meridians, they would destroy them. These needles were best used to restrain cultivators and monsters with strong physical bodies.

Of course, he still had to test out its power.

In the next few days, Cloud Sky peak returned to its usual calm state.

Zhuge Yueyue was cultivating in seclusion, while Feng Xiyun stayed in her room to refine the power of her precious bone. Su Changhe continued supervising the construction of the palace in the peach forest.

On one particular day, Ye Xuan left Cloud Sky peak for a meeting with the other chiefs.

In the meeting hall, Gongsun Shouyue sat in his seat with a solemn expression. Every time his eyes fell on the letter in his hand, his brows furrowed even more.

“Senior Brother Gongsun, what happened? Why did you call us over in such a hurry?”

Gao Shun was puzzled by this situation.

Ever since that day, Gao Shun could be said to have undergone a major change. He was no longer as arrogant as before, and had become more amiable.

When the other elders noticed the change, they were initially surprised. However, they knew that it was all due to Ye Xuan.

When Gongsun Shouyue heard this, he raised his head and looked at the elders. His expression was grave.

“I have received important news today. At midnight last night, many ancient beast descendants appeared in the East continent!”

“According to the report, these ancient beast descendants seem to be fighting over a certain treasure. An earth-shattering battle broke out between them, causing the entire East continent to fall into chaos.”

“The battle between the ancient beast descendants has spread to the outskirts of Qingyang City. Many villages in the East continent have been destroyed.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere instantly turned heavy.

“Damn it! These ancient beast descendants are too brutal. They actually dared to massacre so many humans!”

Yuelun was infuriated by this.

The reactions of the other elders were almost the same.

At the same time, everyone was curious about the treasure that would cause so many ancient beast descendants to fight over it.

Gongsun Shouyue shook his head helplessly.

“I don’t know the exact situation, but a cultivator once saw a huge fiery bird flying through the sky, leaving an endless sea of fire in its wake. Its body was huge and it moved extremely quickly.”

“The ancient beast species that fits those characteristics is most likely the legendary heaven devouring divine sparrow!”

“What? It’s the heaven devouring divine sparrow?”

In that instant, everyone became silent.

Not only did the heaven devouring divine sparrow possess extremely powerful flames, but it could also devour all living things. It was an extremely powerful ancient beast species.

Furthermore, according to the ancient records, the heaven devouring divine sparrow was extremely brutal. When it was hungry, it had even devoured tens of thousands of humans. It was definitely as strong, or even stronger, than a peak-level mystic lord realm expert. Perhaps it had even reached the supreme realm.

However, back when it had last appeared, Chief Tian Xuan had appeared to save the day and banished it to the archaic divine mountains. It had already been several hundred years since it last appeared. Now, a hundred years after Chief Tian Xuan’s death, the heaven devouring divine sparrow had reappeared.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

A hundred years ago, Chief Tian Xuan had indeed mentioned the origins of the heaven devouring divine sparrow to him.

It was said that this ancient beast species was extremely terrifying. Even though it was only a peak-level mystic lord realm expert back then, it had the power to rival an early-stage supreme realm expert.

Most importantly, the heaven devouring divine sparrow was extremely fast, and had a level of intelligence that was not inferior to that of a human. It would choose to flee if it found itself in danger, which was why Tian Xuan had not been able to kill it back then.

“Then, what does Senior Brother Gongsun propose?”

Gongsun Shouyue raised his head and said with a heavy expression, “The appearance of the heaven devouring divine sparrow has caused a huge problem for the East continent, especially in the territory of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“Back then, Chief Tian Xuan was able to drive away the heaven devouring divine sparrow by himself and force it to retreat.”

“Although he has passed away, we as his juniors must walk in his footsteps.”

“We will definitely be able to stop the beasts’ invasion of the archaic divine mountains!”

“How do you all feel about this?”

When everyone heard this, they became excited and hot-blooded. Especially when they recalled the battle back then.

Gao Shun even laughed out loud and said, “We must inherit the legacy of our predecessors. There’s no reason why we should cower in fear.”

“Chief Tian Xuan was able to do it back then, so we can definitely do it too!”

“Well said!”

Beside him, Liang Dahai laughed loudly too. For the first time, he did not argue with Gao Shun. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“We’ll pull all of the feathers off that heaven devouring divine sparrow!”

Yuelun chuckled when she heard this, and then said, “As long as Senior Brother Gongsun gives us the order, everyone in the Great Wilderness Divine sect will act immediately.”
