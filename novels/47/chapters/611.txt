612 An Unreasonable Request

After he came to his senses, Hua Rufeng smiled and said, “Martial Uncle Ye, you’re full of surprises.”

He then took a deep breath of spiritual energy and continued, “This place will become a cultivation paradise!”

“Martial Uncle Ye, I have a presumptuous request, if you don’t mind hearing me out?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Hua Rufeng looked at Ye Xuan’s face seriously. If Ye Xuan displayed even the slightest bit of displeasure, he would not say it.

Ye Xuan had an inkling about what Hua Rufeng was going to say, so he nodded and said, “Alright, just say it.”

Upon hearing this, Hua Rufeng was overjoyed and quickly said, “Martial Uncle Ye, the Divine Seal peak’s gathering is about to start. As the chief disciple of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, I feel that I have a huge burden on my shoulders…”

“If I’m no match for others at the gathering, I’m afraid it will embarrass the sect. As such, before the gathering, can I stay here and cultivate for a while?”

With that, Hua Rufeng looked at Ye Xuan. He did not want to mention this matter, but the gathering was truly important.

At that time, all of the sects in the East continent would be involved and, if he really lost, the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s reputation would suffer.

It was because of this that he had been worried in recent days.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan suddenly laughed. He more or less understood the heavy burden on Hua Rufeng’s shoulders.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan agreed, “It’s fine. There are still a few wooden houses in the garden that are unoccupied. You can pick one and stay here.”

“Woah! Thank you, Martial Uncle Ye!”

Hua Rufeng was overjoyed to hear Ye Xuan’s answer.

At that time, when Ye Xuan had not yet become strong, no one came to Cloud Sky peak at all. Only Hua Rufeng occasionally came to visit.

It was because of this that Ye Xuan took great care of Hua Rufeng.

In any case, this chief disciple was going to be the future sect master of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

At the mention of the Divine Seal peak’s gathering, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at his disciples.

Ye Xuan was not too worried about Zhuge Yueyue.

After all, as the eldest disciple, she had never disappointed him, so there would definitely not be any trouble.

As for his second disciple, she was gentle and refined, and her battle strength was also passable. He estimated that it would not take long for her to break through to the void realm.

However, this little girl…

At present, she was still young and had not started to cultivate.

In some large sects, before mortal disciples started to cultivate, they would almost always be given a lot of treasures to help them consolidate their cultivation foundation, which would help with their future cultivation progress.

Ordinary sects might not have enough treasures to fully accomplish this, but it was different for Ye Xuan. He was a moving treasury, after all.

If he could consolidate this little girl’s cultivation foundation before the gathering, then she would probably beat up the genius disciples of the other sects.

What an interesting sight that would be!

Thinking of this, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly.

That settled it!

This little girl was usually very happy to fight. As her teacher, he had to help her realize her wish!

Nearby, when Hua Rufeng saw the water cloud fruit tree planted in the garden, he felt very puzzled.

“Martial Uncle Ye, there’s something that I’m a little confused about.”

Ye Xuan turned around and asked, “What’s the matter?”

Hua Rufeng came forward and whispered into Ye Xuan’s ear, “You’ve planted the water cloud fruit tree out here in the open. Aren’t you afraid that it will suddenly be stolen one day?”

After hearing this, some of the nearby people with sharp ears immediately felt their blood run cold.

“You little brat, don’t mess around. As if that would ever happen!”

“What a joke. Do you think anyone would dare to steal from a supreme realm expert? We’re not fools.”

“Even if someone did steal it, they wouldn’t live long enough to use it.”

The crowd began to ridicule Hua Rufeng, feeling speechless at his words.

As the representative of the younger generation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, how could he say such thoughtless words?

Hua Rufeng also came to his senses and scratched his head in embarrassment.

It was true.

Martial Uncle Ye was a supreme realm expert. Who would dare to steal his things? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan just smiled and said nothing, but took out his Godsword.

The waves of killing intent it emitted caused everyone present to turn pale.

Dark clouds began to form in the sky, as if an evil creature was about to be born.

It was too scary!

At this time, Ye Xuan calmly held the Godsword upright. After looking around, he said indifferently, “Who would dare?”

“There shouldn’t be anyone, right? If there really are people that blind, I guess they deserve to be turned into fertilizer to improve the soil quality of this place.”

“Our Cloud Sky peak has always been very welcoming. No matter who comes, we’ll welcome them with open arms, hehe.”

After saying that, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth slowly curved up into an evil smile…
