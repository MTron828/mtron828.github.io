500 Double Blow

“My god, what kind of sword formation is this? Its power is too terrifying!”

“Comparing the two, the Immortal Divine sect’s formation is simply too weak…”

“Weak? They aren’t even comparable!”

Ye Xuan stood on the giant sword with a calm expression, as his body surged with terrifying sword intent.

He said indifferently, “The inheritance of the Immortal Divine sect is nothing worth shouting about. Today, I’ll show you the true inheritance of Cloud Sky peak!”

“One move! I’ll only use one move! If you can take it, then I will forget about today’s matter!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the giant sword hanging in the sky began to shine brighter and brighter. As it did, the sense of oppression became stronger and stronger, causing everyone’s hearts to palpitate.

Moments later, all the sword qi gales created by the plants and trees were filled with mysterious patterns, and gathered together like a constellation.

When Elder Taiyin saw this, his face turned extremely pale. His hands, which were holding the Immortal Sword, started to tremble slightly.

Immediately, all of the spiritual power in his body swept out and funneled into the Immortal Sword formation, frantically activating it to resist Ye Xuan’s sword qi.

However, Ye Xuan’s sword qi was too terrifying. There was no comparison.

At this moment, Elder Taiyin finally understood why Ye Xuan had always been so calm. It turned out that his techniques and formations were not worth his time.

At the thought of this, Elder Taiyin felt aggrieved.

It was one thing to be crushed by Tian Xuan back then, but now he was being crushed by his disciple as well. It felt absolutely terrible!

Ye Xuan hovered in the air. He was in an extremely mysterious state.

Moments later, he slowly raised his right hand. A sword beam emerged from two of his fingers, which he then swung toward Elder Taiyin.

At the same time, the giant sword that was hanging in the sky started to move. Then, it too slashed toward Elder Taiyin with an unparalleled power.

Seeing this, Elder Taiyin could not help but reveal a look of fear.

In the face of such destructive sword qi, he did not dare to hold back any longer. The spiritual power in his divine spring burst forth.

He was a bona fide half-step supreme realm expert, so his strength was still extremely terrifying. He held the Immortal Sword in one hand, and a divine cauldron that exuded an ancient aura in his left hand. Then, he turned it into an extremely hard shield that covered his body from the head down.

Boom!

The two extremely powerful powers collided violently, and everything within a several-hundred-mile radius turned into a wasteland. Violent energy shockwaves filled the surroundings.

The divine cauldron in Elder Taiyin’s hand flashed with an ancient light, and an extremely powerful energy suddenly burst forth, causing the entire world to tremble.

Even the four beasts that were fighting madly were surprised to see this.

Pfft!

At this moment, as the giant sword blossomed with dazzling light, and a large crack appeared on the shield formed by the ancient cauldron, after which it shattered.

Elder Taiyin vomited blood. His spiritual power was thrown into disarray, and he was severely injured. That being said, he had managed to block the sword strike.

He looked at Ye Xuan with fear. Although he had survived, he had felt his life threatened by that sword strike, and his mind was still reeling.

The onlookers were shocked, and they looked at Ye Xuan with respect. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At this moment, no one dared to question Ye Xuan’s strength, and no one had the right to say that he was arrogant.

How was he arrogant? He had the strength to back it up, so what was wrong with being arrogant?

“Senior Brother!”

Seeing this, Su Changkong, Li Siyuan, and the other cultivators from the Immortal Divine sect hurried forward and carefully helped Elder Taiyin up, using their own spiritual power to help him recover.

At the same time, Ye Xuan floated down from the sky with an indifferent expression and slowly landed beside Elder Taiyin. Looking at the latter’s sullen expression, he said very seriously, “The inheritance of the Immortal Divine sect… is simply trash!”

“Pfft!”

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin vomited a mouthful of blood and passed out instantly.

Everyone’s mouths twitched when they heard this.

“Wasn’t that f*cking brutal?”

“He already injured Elder Taiyin with his sword strike, then his words delivered an injury to his soul. Who would be able to withstand this?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan turned around and left with an indifferent expression. Now that he was done showing off, there was no point in staying.

“Senior Brother! Are you alright?”

Looking at Elder Taiyin, who had fainted from anger, Su Changkong and the others’ expressions suddenly changed. They looked deeply at Ye Xuan’s departing figure.

Then, they looked at the onlookers not far away and understood what had happened and the ramifications of this.

Today, the dignity of the Immortal Divine sect was ruined. The grand elder of the Immortal Divine sect had been beaten by the chief of Cloud Sky peak.

If word of this got out, which talented cultivator would choose to join the Immortal Divine sect in the future?

This went beyond embarrassment. It was humiliation!

“Let’s go!”

Li Siyuan’s eyes were cold as he spoke. He then hurriedly carried Elder Taiyin on his back and left, his face filled with anger.

If they stayed, it would only get worse.

…

After a short while, in a cave outside the archaic divine mountains, Elder Taiyin finally awakened.

When he thought of what had happened just now, he roared in anger.

“Detestable!”

“Ye Xuan! You and I are mortal enemies!”

...

The latter’s eyes were filled with a monstrous killing intent, and the terrifying pressure of a half-step supreme realm expert swept out.

However, at the same time, Elder Taiyin felt a deep sense of regret.

His life force was already close to being exhausted, and after that great battle just now, he had consumed a lot more of it.

However, he was even more puzzled about how Ye Xuan’s strength could be so terrifying. A mere peak-level mystic lord realm cultivator had actually managed to demolish a half-step supreme realm expert like himself.

If such a monstrous genius was allowed to grow for a few more decades, would he not become another Tian Xuan?
