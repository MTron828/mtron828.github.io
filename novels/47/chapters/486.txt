487 One Sword Strike!

It was obvious that if Li Siyuan made the same choice again, not only would Su Changkong stand by and do nothing, but even the Immortal Divine sect might abandon him.

After all, the Immortal Divine sect was an ancient sect that had existed for countless years. It was impossible for them to choose to make an enemy out of another equally powerful sect just because a mere mystic lord realm elder had grudges with the other sect.

Li Siyuan naturally understood this, so he could only helplessly grit his teeth and swallow his anger.

At the same time, the Reincarnation Fairy was looking at Ye Xuan and the terrifyingly huge sword.

!!

“Uncle Situ, can you see the secret behind this sword technique?”

“How does it compare to our sect’s judgment sword technique?”

She was very curious.

What level had Ye Xuan reached in terms of the Sword Dao? How did he learn such a terrifying sword technique?

Ever since she met Ye Xuan in Qingyang City back then, she had been fascinated by him.

How had such a monstrously talented expert remained unknown for a hundred years? Was there some sort of special reason behind this?

He had only shot to fame after the incident with the ape beast’s precious bone. There were not even any rumors about him in the mystic world prior to that.

Had he shunned fame and glory? Was this the true demeanor of a peerless expert?

Over the years, she had been competing with Mu Beichen to see who was stronger, but after seeing Ye Xuan, she understood.

A true expert did not need to prove himself to anyone! True gold would always shine!

Situ Mo looked at Ye Xuan deeply, then sighed.

“Although our sect’s judgment sword technique is powerful, Ye Xuan’s sword technique very likely exceeds the constraints of the power of the laws.”

His words shocked the cultivators from the Jade Lake Divine sect.

“Is his sword technique really that terrifying? To the point that even our sect’s judgment sword cannot match it?”

“The two aren’t even on the same level,” Situ Mo said very seriously.

Hearing this, everyone felt a little disappointed.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect, the Immortal Divine sect, and the Jade Lake Divine sect were all top holy lands. However, it seemed that the Great Wilderness Divine sect was about to break away from the pack and rise up!

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, the heaven devouring divine sparrow let out an ear-piercing cry. It seemed to have sensed some terrifying danger, and its wings were filled with the terrifying power of true fire. Clearly, this sense of danger came from that huge divine sword in the sky.

It immediately gave up on attacking the Pixiu and gathered all of its power, charging toward Ye Xuan. To the heaven devouring divine sparrow, Ye Xuan was the far bigger threat.

It opened its mouth, and a powerful suction force emerged as it tried to swallow Ye Xuan.

However, Ye Xuan would naturally not allow this to happen. His peak-level mystic lord realm cultivation erupted. Although he had not reached the supreme realm, it would not stop him from fighting the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

“Let’s fight!”

Ye Xuan howled at the sky, a crazy smile on his face.

Moments later, the huge divine sword released a baleful aura, and even created a huge hole in the spatial barrier. It was filled with killing intent that seemed to want to devour everything! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Then, it transformed into a blood-red divine dragon that whizzed toward the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

This was an attack that contained all of Ye Xuan’s power, and it had locked onto the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

A look of fear flashed across its eyes, as its body trembled. It could clearly sense the terrifying sword intent contained within the blood-red divine dragon.

After it discovered that the blood-red divine dragon had locked onto its aura, and there was no way to escape, it immediately used the suction force in an attempt to dissolve the power of the attack.

Boom!

The two forces collided with each other, causing the entire area to tremble.

Moments, a rain of blood suddenly began to fall within the archaic divine mountains. The blood belonged to the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

Everyone looked up and saw that half of the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s wing had been cut off by Ye Xuan.

“Oh my god, is this for real?”

When everyone saw this scene, they were shocked that even the heaven devouring divine sparrow had not been able to withstand that sword attack.

Everyone could clearly sense that the heaven devouring divine sparrow’s precious bone was emitting a brilliant light. It was obvious that it had just used its inherited divine ability!

Even so, it had still been seriously injured by Ye Xuan’s sword attack.

Buzzzzzz!

The heaven devouring divine sparrow released a pained cry, as it looked on in fear at Ye Xuan.

Ever since it was born, it had never been so severely injured.

Even the invincible Chief Tian Xuan was only able to drive it back to the archaic divine mountains, but was unable to cause any serious damage to it.

The heaven devouring divine sparrow’s massive body crashed into the ground, and its life force was rapidly draining away.

“Wait… Did Chief Ye Xuan kill the heaven devouring divine sparrow with one strike?”

When everyone saw this scene, they were shocked senseless.
