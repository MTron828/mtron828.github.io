912 A Simple Matter

“Senior Brother Ou, don’t forget the elder’s instructions. He didn’t ask us to come here to start a civil war.”

“I understand. There’s no need for you to remind me.”

Ou Tian was furious, and even Li Xuanzhen’s did not do much to dissuade him. He burst into angry laughter, his eyes filled with mockery for Ye Xuan.

He was a genius who had attracted the attention of the world since he was born. Now, after he descended to the lower realm, he was actually provoked by an ant.

If news of this matter were to spread back to the Heavenly Dao World, then his reputation would suffer a hit.

Ou Tian trembled with anger when he thought of this.

“You’re really something. You’re the first person to dare to provoke me.”

“What I really don’t understand is how a mere sealed immortal realm cultivator like you has the confidence to provoke me?”

“Do you think I won’t dare to kill you?”

Ou Tian raised his head and released a terrifying killing intent, which seemed to freeze the atmosphere, frightening everyone.

The onlookers all broke out into cold sweat. It seemed that this fellow was powerful enough to back up his arrogance. At the same time, they were looking forward to what would happen next.

If a peerless genius from the eight continents clashed with a peerless genius from the Heavenly Dao World, who would be the final victor?

Everyone had their own guesses. That being said, they did not know about Ou Tian, and only knew that ever since Ye Xuan had become famous, he had never been defeated. He had even defeated enemies stronger than himself.

As such, despite the fact that this opponent was someone from the mysterious Heavenly Dao World, it was difficult to determine the outcome.

Sensing the killing intent released by the other party, Ye Xuan simply smiled.

He knew very well that Ou Tian was burning with rage, but he was not worried at all. He was still smiling brightly.

“Hahaha! You actually want to kill me? You can give it a go and see if your imagination actually becomes reality.”

Ye Xuan had no intention of backing down at all. He was even eager to have Ou Tian make the first move.

Hearing this, even Li Xuanzhen and Nanfeng were completely shocked.

“Oh my god! Doesn’t this guy know when to back down? How could he provoke Senior Brother Ou like this?” Nanfeng said incredulously.

However, Li Xuanzhen was still calmly analyzing the situation. After thinking for a moment, he finally spoke.

“We can’t let this continue. If we let them fight, someone will definitely be injured.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“This guy from the East continent has great potential. His combat strength is not to be underestimated. In the future, he will become one of the pillars of our Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“If he is really killed by Senior Brother Ao, then it will be a great loss. We have to intervene.”

Nanfeng nodded, very much in agreement.

After all, the current situation in the Heavenly Dao World was precarious. Perhaps it would not take long for a war to break out, and it had been a long time since the human race had had a top expert appear.

Anyone with potential had to be taken care of seriously. This was also something that the elders had often told them.

With this in mind, Li Xuanzhen immediately rushed forward and pressed his hands on Ou Tian’s shoulders.

“Senior Brother Ou, don’t be too impulsive.”

“Elder has already instructed us that today’s trip is only to deal with Shan Ling. We can’t mix personal feelings into this matter.”

“I won’t interfere with the hatred between the two of you, but there’s no need for you to start a fight right now. You can wait until he comes to the Heavenly Dao World before pursuing this matter.”

Li Xuanzhen’s tone was very serious. From this, it could be seen that if Ou Tian continued to be stubborn, even he would have to make a move.

Ou Tian was not stupid. He already knew the true meaning of Li Xuanzhen’s words. Thus, he could only restrain himself at this moment. Now was not the time for him to be impulsive.

After pondering for a moment, Ou Tian coldly said, “Since you’re weak, I’ll spare your life for now!”

“You’re just a sealed immortal realm cultivator. Perhaps you are unmatched in this world, but up above, you’ll soon realize that this is just the starting point.”

“Up there, you are but an ant, an existence whose life and death can be controlled by others, so remember that!”

What Ou Tian said was right, so everyone quietened down. In their eyes, the sealed immortal realm was already a level beyond their reach, let alone the eternal realm.

In this vast and boundless starry universe, there were many experts, and there were definitely people out there who were stronger than one was.

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan was silent for a moment, before finally saying, “Indeed. What you said makes sense, but it’s just the eternal realm. Reaching that realm is not difficult for me at all.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the situation immediately boiled over.

It seemed that his arrogance knew no bounds.

Ou Tian felt his heart tremble. It had to be known that even he had spent nearly a hundred years reaching the eternal realm.

He had experienced countless setbacks during the process, yet this same journey was being discounted by Ye Xuan as being a simple matter.
