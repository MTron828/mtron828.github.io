773 Slaying The Strange Monster

It was ecstatic that it would soon be able to obtain a powerful servant.

On the other side, Yuelun was getting more anxious by the minute, and her fingers gripped the Water Sky Sword tightly. She was ready to take the risk to try and save Ye Xuan.

However, just as she was about to make a move, flashes of blood-red light filled the sky.

The strange monster that was originally smiling suddenly froze. It did not say a word and looked down at its chest in a daze.

A broken sword had just pierced its chest!

Furthermore, the power of the Godsword was continuously flowing into the strange monster’s body, eliminating the strange power within.

The strange monster spat out a few mouthfuls of pitch-black blood. Its origin essence had already suffered great damage, and even its life force was rapidly declining.

Looking at this somewhat comical scene, everyone was stunned.

The strange monster was even more unwilling to believe what was happening. It had believed that victory was in its grasp. Why had things turned out like this?

Moments later, the thick black fog surrounding Ye Xuan dispersed, and he emerged unscathed, his robe fluttering in the wind.

“Yes! Chief Ye Xuan is alive and well!”

“Actually, I knew it all along. How could a peerless expert like Ye Xuan fail so easily?”

At this moment, there were cheers among the onlookers, who felt their hopes revive. Smiles decorated their faces.

Ye Xuan, on the other hand, was currently patting his clothes, trying to rid himself of the stains of the black fog. His face was filled with disgust.

“You’re a really f*cking disgusting monster, you know that?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As he spoke, he flew forward, and in the blink of an eye, he had already arrived in front of the strange monster.

“This… How did you break out of my spatial cage?”

The spatial cage was its trump card, and was the culmination of its efforts to comprehend spatial power.

Those who were trapped in this spatial cage would not only never be able to break out, but their minds would also be bewitched and become its puppets. Even a sealed immortal realm expert would not be able to break out as easily as Ye Xuan did.

“Haha…”

Ye Xuan smiled and waved his right hand, recalling the Godsword.

“You call that a trump card? That was child’s play!”

After stomping on the strange monster’s pride, Ye Xuan wasted no time in swinging the Godsword and unleashing an unstoppable sword beam in its direction.

Puchi!

The beam carved out a humongous hole in the strange monster’s body. Even so, it was still alive. Seeing this, Ye Xuan flew closer and stabbed the Godsword into its heart, ending its pitiful life.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan kicked the strange monster away and muttered calmly, “That’s it? How weak…”

He examined the surroundings for traces of the strange monster’s soul, but after discovering that it had scattered into nothingness, he relaxed and withdrew his power.

With the strange monster gone, the black fog that blotted out the sun in the sky dissipated, and there were clear skies above Sky Mountain once more.

“We won?”

The onlookers had yet to process what was going on, and briefly wondered if they were dreaming. However, once they came to their senses, cheers rang out all over the place.

“Sword Immortal Ye is invincible!”

“Chief Ye Xuan is invincible!”

Hearing these shouts, Ye Xuan did not take them to heart. Instead, he was thinking of other things. He knew that the crisis had only been temporarily resolved, and that more dangers would soon follow.

After Ye Xuan successfully killed the strange monster, in the strange world on the other side of the crack, the eyes of a monster that was sleeping suddenly opened…

Ye Xuan frowned slightly. He could clearly tell that his control over the power of the laws seemed to have changed.

“Eh… What exactly is going on?”

When he did a double take, he realized that his control over the power of the laws had become more natural and familiar.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan finally figured out what was going on. It seemed that his action of slaying this strange monster had granted him fate energy and merit, as he had saved countless lives from destruction.

Although the power of merit was insignificant now, if Ye Xuan continued to accumulate it, it would give him an advantage when he tried to break through to the sealed immortal realm.

That being said, Ye Xuan was not particularly interested in reaching the sealed immortal realm in this manner.

“Reaching the sealed immortal realm through the power of merit is not what I want. If I really go down this path, then won’t all the preparations I’ve made in the past be for naught?”

Ye Xuan was already at the peak of the ancient realm, but he still had a long way to go before he could become a sealed immortal realm expert.
