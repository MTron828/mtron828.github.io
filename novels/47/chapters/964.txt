Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He had no idea what came after the eternal realm, so if he relied on himself to explore what came after, it would be both risky, and too slow.

If he went in the wrong direction, he might even ruin his entire cultivation path.

No matter how one put it, the path of immortal cultivation was heartless. It was like sailing against the current. If one did not advance, one would fall behind, and eventually fade into obscurity.

If he had a senior to guide him, then his path would undoubtedly be much smoother. Someone as strong as the Forbidden Lord definitely had the qualifications to guide him.

The Forbidden Lord was still staring at Ye Xuan. After a while, he said, “Don’t get too happy. After all, the choice I’m giving you is also full of uncertainties.” “Because I just comprehended this Great Dao, no one before you has ever tried to cultivate it, not even me.”

“Right now, I don’t dare to say for sure whether this Great Dao I’ve comprehended will be able to reach the end. It’s just that this path is more likely to succeed than the original path.”

“It’s precisely because of this that I’m putting this choice before you. Which path you choose is entirely up to you.”

The Forbidden Lord was not in a hurry to urge Ye Xuan to answer. He also wanted to see what choice Ye Xuan would make.

Even though he had already comprehended this Great Dao, he could not cultivate it, as he had already gone down the original path.

It was also for this reason that there was no way to know if this Great Dao could reach the end.

Actually, he also wanted to verify his guesses, and thus wanted Ye Xuan to help him test it.

Ye Xuan guessed what the Forbidden Lord was thinking and frowned.

‘It’s just a path that is more likely to reach the end?”

Ye Xuan’s heart had already begun to waver. He did not know whether to trust this expert whom he had never met before.

However, he had to make a choice now. After all, if the Great Dao that the Forbidden Lord spoke of could really bring him to the end of the cultivation path, then he could not miss this opportunity.

“Can you tell me in detail about this Great Dao?” Ye Xuan asked. At this moment, the Forbidden Lord smiled and waved his hand. In an instant, a ball of red light flashed in front of Ye Xuan, putting him into a dazed state.

He felt as if he had seen a ray of light amidst the darkness.

“Using the body as the Dao and blood as the guide?”

At this moment, Ye Xuan suddenly recalled something and felt extremely shocked. Everything seemed to be destined.

Not long ago, he had already checked and used his body to plant Dao Flowers. He had even specially given this method to Ao Lei.

Now seeing the Great Dao that the Forbidden Lord was using a similar concept, he felt that the two complemented each other well.

In this case, there was no need for him to cultivate a completely new Great Dao, and could simply use his original foundation for this Great Dao.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan was extremely excited. After all, the path of the Great Dao that the Forbidden Lord created was complementary to his original cultivation path. Furthermore, since the Forbidden Lord could come up with a new path that was similar to his, it meant that he was the same type of cultivator as Ye Xuan, which would increase the probability of success when cultivating this new path.

What shocked Ye Xuan the most was that not only had he discovered this Great Dao path, but he had also discovered another Great Dao path.

‘The path of reincarnation?’

‘Isn’t this the path Xiang Yun took?’

Ye Xuan looked at the Forbidden Lord in disbelief. However, after pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan made his choice.

“Alright, let me be the pioneer of this path!”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I’ll have to trouble you to teach me this Great Dao.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the Forbidden Lord felt very happy.

“Alright! Young man, I have high hopes for you!”

At this moment, the Forbidden Lord’s absent-minded gaze seemed to light up. Then, he stretched out his palms toward Ye Xuan and instantly transmitted an extremely terrifying power into Ye Xuan’s body.

“Young man, what you need to do now is to stick to your heart. Please let me guide you and help you step onto the path of the Great Dao.”

Ye Xuan had already sensed the extremely terrifying energy in his body and could not help but think to himself, ‘Oh my god… This feeling is really wonderful!’

He knew that if he wanted to, he could step into the eternal realm within a single second.

However, at this moment, the Forbidden Lord was guiding him on the path, helping him to use his blood as a guide and use his body to shape the Great Dao.

Ye Xuan did not resist, and followed the guidance of the Forbidden Lord as he began to comprehend the Great Dao. However, before he could become too excited, he felt an unbearable pain in his body, causing his expression to twist and contort.

Drops of blood slowly appeared on Ye Xuan’s skin. Within moments, he was covered in his own blood.

“Young man, grit your teeth and persevere. I spent countless years comprehending this Great Dao. Those who walk this path must endure extremely intense pain.”

“As long as you can endure it, your future path will be much smoother,” the Forbidden Lord quickly said when he saw Ye Xuan’s situation. He did not want Ye Xuan to give up halfway.

Because Ye Xuan’s soul had left his body at the moment, after he began to comprehend the Great Dao, his physical body also began to show signs of problems.

Thus, the people from the Great Wilderness Sect who were responsible for protecting Ye Xuan also noticed that something was wrong.

At this moment, Gao Shun came forward with a puzzled expression and examined Ye Xuan’s body. “Senior Brother, what’s happening to Junior Brother Ye? Why was there so much blood coming out of his body?”

Hearing this, the other people also quickly turned their attention to Ye Xuan’s body. They could sense profound energy fluctuations emanating from his body….
