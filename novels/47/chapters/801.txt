802 Mutual Destruction

The red flower instantly released wisps of light, enveloping the entire East continent.

At this moment, Mengyu suddenly felt a strong sense of sadness rising from within her heart.

“Cannot…”

As she muttered to herself, Mengyu even slapped herself twice to wake herself up.

However, by the time she came to her senses, Ye Xuan was already in front of her, Godsword in hand.

This sword move could be considered Ye Xuan’s most powerful attack. The Godsword streaked across the sky, tearing space apart.

Seeing this, Mengyu’s expression turned cold. She immediately shouted, “Get lost!”

At the last moment, she raised the sword in her hand and released the full power of a sealed immortal realm expert, clashing against Ye Xuan’s attack, and releasing dazzling light that blinded everyone.

When the light dissipated, everyone saw Ye Xuan fall from the sky and felt despaired.

“In the end, we still lost?”

Ao Lei said with a pale face. Originally, Ye Xuan was evenly matched with Mengyu. However, after she took out this demonic sword, the balance shifted in Mengyu’s favor.

Even though Ye Xuan’s rainbow robe was also very powerful, the cultivation level difference of a major realm was not so easy to make up for.

Mengyu’s demonic sword pierced Ye Xuan’s chest, and the scene fell silent.

Even on the other side of the barrier, the group of experts watching maintained their silence at the same time.

After a long time, someone finally spoke.

“Sigh… How can an ant topple an elephant? He really overestimated himself…”

“With the strength of an ancient realm expert, there was no chance at victory…”

A white-haired old man sighed and turned around to leave.

However, at this moment, another person spoke.

“You call this overestimating himself? Don’t you have any respect for him?”

“Everyone knows that sealed immortal realm experts are existences that ancient realm experts shouldn’t provoke. However, he still dared to go up against her for the sake of the East continent. Shouldn’t you show him some respect?

People started arguing with each other. After this battle, perhaps the East continent would also be destroyed.

When they saw Ye Xuan’s figure fall to the ground, everyone felt that the Great Demoness had won.

However, at this moment, a sound was heard, instantly breaking the silence.

Puchi!

At this moment, Mengyu also spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, her body fell from the sky as well.

This scene made everyone’s jaws drop.

“What exactly is going on?”

“Is there going to be a shocking turn of events?”

The expressions of the people on Sky Mountain changed drastically. They stared at the sky like children and saw a drop of blood slowly fall from the bewitching red flower.

In the blink of an eye, this drop of blood transformed into an extremely powerful sword beam that instantly pierced Mengyu’s body.

Even Mengyu herself did not expect that this red flower contained such a powerful trump card.

“No!”

“Teacher!”

After shouting, Zhuge Yueyue tried to rush toward her teacher to wake him up.

Yuelun was crying as well, but she hugged Zhuge Yueyue tightly and did not allow her to go. After all, there were still remnants of Mengyu’s and Ye Xuan’s power nearby.

If Zhuge Yueyue really rushed over, she would probably die.

Who could have predicted that this battle would end like this? Both sides had lost their lives.

Up in the sky, Daoist Yi Feng was also paying attention to this scene, but he did not display any emotions. In fact, his expression was a little cold.

It was as if Ye Xuan’s death had nothing to do with him.

Seeing his abnormal behavior, Ao Lei seemed to have figured something out and suddenly became excited.

“Could it be that Junior Brother Ye is still alive?”

Amidst his shock, Ao Lei suddenly remembered that Ye Xuan had gone to find Daoist Master Yi Feng not long ago in order to find a way to kill Meng Yu.

In this case, the two of them must have discussed this beforehand. If Daoist Yi Feng’s expression was so calm, he must have had a backup plan.

As expected, after a while, thunder suddenly rumbled in the sky.

Looking over, he saw Mengyu, who had fallen to the ground, suddenly stand up. She was not dead.

“Mengyu!”

Everyone’s faces were filled with shock. The sword beam that Ye Xuan unleashed actually did not kill her?

“It must be because of the immortal bones,” Ao Lei said coldly.

Although Mengyu had already stood up, her face was pale and weak. After all, she had just been reborn from the immortal bones.

“B*stard, you actually made me suffer death for no reason,” Mengyu gritted her teeth as she spoke.

Seeing that Ye Xuan had also fallen to the ground in the distance, she even thought of going over and picking Ye Xuan up and beating him up again to vent her anger.

However, at this moment, the red flower in the sky released a ray of light again, shining on Ye Xuan’s body.

Moments later, Ye Xuan opened his eyes, patted the soil off his body, and stood up as well. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This…”

Mengyu was dumbfounded. She could not believe what she was seeing.

“You’re still alive?”

Mengyu’s expression changed drastically. Her attack had indeed completely severed Ye Xuan’s life force, but why was he still alive and well?

Could it be that he also had immortal bones?

Seeing her confused expression, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly, but he did not answer.

Raising his left hand slightly, the red flower floating in the sky instantly descended into Ye Xuan’s palm, instantly returning him to his peak condition.
