835 A Familiar Voice

At this moment, Ye Xuan stood quietly in front of Zhuge Yueyue. Although he did not move, he exuded a terrifying pressure.

“Oh my god! A sealed immortal realm expert…”

“If I’m not wrong, this person is the East continent’s sealed immortal realm expert, Ye Xuan?”

Today, they finally saw this legendary figure.

“It’s hard to imagine that the aura he releases seems to be one with the world. It’s almost like he commands the power of the laws itself.”

“So this is the sealed immortal realm? It’s really terrifying!”

A few ancient realm experts muttered to each other. Although they knew that Ye Xuan had defeated Mengyu when he was an ancient realm expert, they could not figure out how.

This was because they could sense that if they tried to fight Ye Xuan now, they would probably only be able to hold on for a few moments.

This was the difference between the sealed immortal realm and the ancient realm. Why was the difference between them so vast?

Puchi!

After a moment of silence, the older golden-furred growler spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood, breaking the silence.

“Teacher…”

Zhuge Yueyue shouted happily when she saw the figure in front of her.

Her life was in danger just now, but she still did not panic too much as she believed that her teacher would definitely not let anyone hurt her.

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Zhuge Yueyue.

“You can return to the sect first. Leave this place to me.”

“Alright,” Zhuge Yueyue said straightforwardly and then returned to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Junior Brother Ye, let me handle this shameless fellow. He really deserves to die. He actually dared to interfere in a fight between members of the younger generation.”

“However, that’s a good thing, too. It just so happens that I was looking for someone to spar with.”

“C’mon! Show me what the Xuan continent is made of!”

Gao Shun shouted fiercely, as he could no longer restrain his anger.

When the golden-furred growler had cursed the East continent just now, he had endured it. There was no need to hold back now though, as the shameless older golden-furred growler had made the first move and intervened in a fight that he should not have.

“You’ve got guts. You actually dared to try and hurt my disciple?”

At this moment, the surroundings were silent. Everyone knew very well that angering a sealed immortal realm expert was a foolish thing to do. However, this older golden-furred growler still did not realize what was going on.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the anger in his heart was still burning.

Obviously, this was also a person who was still stubborn even in the face of death. Although he knew very well that he was no match for Ye Xuan, his pride did not allow him to back down.

“Ha! So what if you’re a sealed immortal realm expert? When the war truly erupts, you’ll be one of the first to die!”

“What can you do to me?”

The older golden-furred growler was very arrogant.

Everyone knew very well that their golden-furred growler race had once had a very powerful expert.

Even though a long time had passed, there was still the power of karma tied to their race. In the Xuan continent, although their race did not have much combat strength, no one dared to provoke them.

Furthermore, they had the support of the experts of the Heavenly Dao World behind them.

However, although the others did not dare to provoke golden-furred growlers, the same could not be said for Ye Xuan.

At this moment, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said casually, “Oh? Is that really the case?”

“Are you really that confident that I can’t deal with you?”

After hearing this, the older golden-furred growler’s eyebrows suddenly shot up, and his heart was filled with uncertainty.

Under normal circumstances, experts who reached this realm would cherish their lives, and thus pay attention to the power of karma. Thus, they would avoid causing trouble for themselves wherever possible.

He had heard a little about Ye Xuan’s character before, and suddenly realized that the person in front of him was completely fearless.

Thinking this, the eyes of the older golden-furred growler turned cold as he said fiercely, “Do you really want to take my life?”

“Don’t you know how serious the consequences of killing me are?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned.

How serious could it be? He did not understand why a mere ancient realm cultivator was behaving so arrogantly. Amidst his confusion, a clear voice appeared in his mind.

“Everyone is wary of them because they might call for help from the Heavenly Dao World.”

Ye Xuan was pleasantly surprised to hear this voice. However, when he looked around him, he could not find her.

“Yanran, are you here?”

Ye Xuan was happy, because he initially thought that they would not be able to converse for some time. However, after receiving the voice transmission, he realized that Yanran had also reached the sealed immortal realm.

After all, only sealed immortal realm experts could send voice transmissions over long distances.
