331 Towering Towers

“It’s okay.”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled and did not blame her. In any case, he could help her to comprehend those two supreme intents.

In addition, now that he was done comprehending the supreme intents contained within the Imprisonment Divine Tower, it was time for a change.

“Don’t worry, I will do my best to help you.”

“Also, I’ll give my Imprisonment Divine Tower to you. It contains sixth-level destruction and strength intents.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and the five of them suddenly appeared in the darkness of the spatial turbulence.

At the same time, a dark Divine Tower appeared in Ye Xuan’s palm, and his spatial intent enveloped their bodies, protecting them from the violent void power circulating within the spatial turbulence.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s body.

“I’ll help you refine it too.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and the Imprisonment Divine Tower turned into a streak of light and entered Shangguan Wan’er’s forehead.

“Alright.”

Then, with Ye Xuan’s help, Shangguan Wan’er quickly left her soul imprint on the Imprisonment Divine Tower.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Imprisonment Divine Tower (middle-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 3x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Radiant Divine Tower (middle-grade holy artifact)!”

A dazzling divine tower suddenly appeared in Ye Xuan’s storage space.

“It’s actually light intent!”

Ye Xuan was surprised to see this.

Light intent, like creation and devouring intents, were martial intents second to only supreme intents.

If one’s light intent reached a certain level, one could turn into light and purify everything. One could also move as fast as light!

“Mm! Light intent should be suitable for Qingyan,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

The concept of fire could burn all things, but it also had some purifying aspects, which made it similar to light intent.

After that, Ye Xuan bestowed the Radiant Divine Tower to Li Qingyan.

Li Qingyan received it in a daze. She still had not completely grasped the Demon-suppressing Divine Tower that Ye Xuan had given her previously, and could not even unleash one percent of its power.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

No matter what, she was still extremely happy about receiving a gift from her teacher.

“Mm! Although you can’t completely master these artifacts now, you will in the future.”

“Although these artifacts are powerful, they are not of much use to me.”

His disciples did not doubt his words.

In their eyes, Ye Xuan was a moving treasure vault with an endless supply of treasures.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Radiant Divine Tower (middle-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 11x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Creation Divine Tower (high-grade holy artifact)!”

Another tower appeared in Ye Xuan’s storage space. This one had a total of 99 floors.

“Creation intent. Not bad!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

“Yue, I’ll give this Creation Divine Tower to you. Creation intent is extremely rare, so try your best to comprehend it!”

Ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and the Creation Divine Tower fell into Yue’s hand.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

To Yue, receiving a gift from her master was more precious than the gift itself.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Creation Divine Tower (high-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 4x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Void Divine Tower (high-grade holy artifact)!”

Next, a giant black tower emitting a terrifying suction force appeared in Ye Xuan’s storage space. It even tried to devour Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes narrowed.

Void intent was also known as the evolved version of gravity intent, and had the power to devour everything. It contained some of the characteristics of devouring and darkness intents.

“Yan’er, now that you’re a peak core formation realm cultivator, you can try to comprehend the devouring intent.”

“I’ve specially chosen this artifact for you. It’s called the Void Divine Tower, and contains the void intent, which will be very helpful for you in comprehending devouring intent,” Ye Xuan said with a smile as he looked at the expectant Zhao Yuyan.

In the next second, a miniature Black Tower exuding dark energy suddenly appeared.

“Teacher, what happened? Why can’t I see anything?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zhao Yuyan, who had been full of anticipation, was now flustered.

She had only taken a brief glance at the Void Divine Tower, but she could not see anything but darkness.

“That’s the manifestation of void intent!”

“After you refine it, remember what I just said,” Ye Xuan explained.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Hearing this, Zhao Yuyan was extremely excited.

“Mm! I will also help you refine it,” Ye Xuan said.
