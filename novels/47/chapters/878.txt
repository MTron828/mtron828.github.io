After seeing them rush toward Cloud Sky Cave, Feng Xiyun quickly followed. After all, she was the only disciple of Cloud Sky peak who could help.

Other than her, no one else knew what was inside the Cloud Sky Cave. Soon, the group arrived outside the entrance of Cloud Sky Cave. After Hua Rufeng gently placed Ao Lei’s corpse down, he immediately knelt down outside the cave.

“Hua Rufeng greets Martial Uncle Ye!”

The scene remained very quiet. Hua Rufeng waited for a long time but did not receive a reply. In his anxiety, Hua Rufeng shouted again, “Hua Rufeng greets Martial Uncle Ye! I hope that Martial Uncle Ye can display his might and save Martial Uncle Ao.”

Despite this, there was still no sound to be heard, and the entrance to Cloud Sky Cave remained tightly sealed. His words could not reach those inside at all.

In a moment of desperation, he even contemplated barging in, but was stopped by Gao Shun.

“Stop! This seal was set up by a sealed immortal realm cultivator. With your strength, there’s no way to break it.”

Hearing this, Hua Rufeng tried to shout again, but nothing happened.

“If there’s no way to send it inside, how can we inform Martial Uncle Ye of the situation?”

Gao Shun also felt very helpless at this time. He also wanted to break the seal, but even if all of them joined forces, they would not be able to break it.

Just as the two of them were feeling hopeless, Yuelun and Feng Xiyun arrived, and saw Hua Rufeng sitting on the ground with tears in his eyes.

“What’s going on?”

Gao Shun helplessly replied, “Junior Brother Ye has set up a seal here. We have no way of sending any information to him.”

“Ah! What should we do?” Yuelun was in a mess. If they could not pass the news to Ye Xuan, they probably would not be able to save Ao Lei in time.

What could they do now?

At this moment, Feng Xiyun quickly said, “Don’t be nervous. I have a way of informing them.”

“Really?” After hearing this, the three of them turned their gazes to Feng Xiyun hopefully.

Feng Xiyun took out a purple wind chime and said, “This purple wind chime was planted by my grandmaster. It only blooms once every ten years to express its longing.”

“Teacher then refined this purple wind chime so that it could be used to transmit information. No matter where you are, as long as the other person has a purple wind chime, I can transmit information to that person.”

After hearing these words, hope blossomed in their hearts.

Feng Xiyun did not waste any more time, and took out the purple wind chime and threw it into the sky. In an instant, a powerful stream energy passed through the entrance and transmitted the information.

After a short while, Cloud Sky Cave opened up. On the other side, in front of Cloud Sky Palace…

“Oh my god, I’m really going to die from nervousness…”

“I hope that Junior Brother Ye can save Senior Brother Ao. If he can’t, I can’t imagine what will happen in the East Province.”

At this moment, Lu Xiu was pacing back and forth, his gaze fixed in the direction of Cloud Sky Cave. It was a critical moment for the sect, as the Great Wilderness Divine sect had become the strongest force in the East continent. If the grand elder suddenly died, then there would definitely be changes to the situation in the East continent.

In front of Cloud Sky Cave, Hua Rufeng was overjoyed when he saw the cave entrance open. Seeing Ye Xuan emerge from the entrance, he immediately rushed forward and hugged Ye Xuan’s thigh.

“Martial Uncle Ye, help! Hurry up and save Martial Uncle Ao!”

Looking at the crying Hua Rufeng, Ye Xuan was in no hurry to speak. Gao Shun also came forward at this time and said very anxiously, “Junior Brother Ye, you can save Senior Brother Ao, right? I believe you can.”

No one could remain calm. After all, Ao Lei was too important to them and the sect. He was the sect’s pillar.

When Yuelun came forward and said with reddened eyes,”Junior Brother Ye…” Ye Xuan waved his hand and said, “Come with me.”

Just now, Feng Xiyun had informed him about the situation, and he had already started thinking about a solution. He had never expected that Ao Lei would suddenly pass away at this time. He was very confused. Logically speaking, even though Ao Lei was indeed quite old, it did not seem like the latter’s time had come, right?

Despite his confusion, he got Hua Rufeng to carry Ao Lei into the cave. After arriving inside, Ye Xuan instructed Hua Rufeng to place Ao Lei’s corpse beside the lotus platform.

“Martial Uncle Ye, what happened to him? Why did he pass away without any warning?” Hua Rufeng asked anxiously as Ye Xuan examined Ao Lei’s corpse.

After a rough inspection, Ye Xuan realized that Ao Lei’s body was riddled with many old injuries…
