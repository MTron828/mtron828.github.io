768 Yuelun Takes Action

Many people felt helpless when they saw the demonic blood beast. Was it over? Was the defensive formation going to collapse?

However, at this moment, a figure emitting blue light rushed out from the Great Wilderness Divine sect and floated above Sky Mountain’s defensive line, staring daggers at the demonic blood beast.

Then, the figure threw a punch that forced the demonic blood beast back!

After the blue light dissipated, everyone could finally see who this figure was.

“Eh?”

“It’s Chief Yuelun!”

She had come here alone to fight the demonic blood beast, and reduce the pressure on Gao Shun. Then, when the people realized that she was already a middle-stage supreme realm expert, they rejoiced.

Perhaps things would be okay, after all.

However, there was still the pressing matter of the strange monster in the sky, who had a dragon head and a human body.

Until now, it had not attacked, as if it was watching a show. Its eyes were filled with ridicule.

It was as if in its heart, everything it was seeing were ants, and unworthy of it taking action personally.

After Yuelun arrived, she quickly brought the demonic blood beast under control. She then turned his attention to the strange monster in the sky.

“Isn’t this monster’s aura too strong?”

Yuelun’s heart began to tremble continuously, feeling a little afraid. It seemed that only Ye Xuan would be able to deal with this monster. In any case, she was only here to stall for time and help Gao Shun stabilize the situation.

She was not foolish enough to provoke this monster in the sky.

On the other hand, the demonic blood beast that was being suppressed was furious. Its pride as an ancient beast was being trampled upon by this despicable human!

The remaining trace of its rationality had already been devoured, and after letting out a long howl, it instantly launched furious but mindless attacks. “How dare you!”

Seeing this, Yuelun focused her spiritual power in her palm and slapped the demonic blood beast!

Boom!

The shockwaves from the force of the collision instantly swept out. Had Gao Shun not been personally overseeing the defensive formation, it would have collapsed.

The slap forced the blood demon beast back a few hundred steps.

Then, Yuelun unsheathed her sword and in preparation to slay the demonic blood beast. However, before she could unleash her attack, a huge palm descended from the sky toward her.

The huge palm was covered in that strange black power, and it was obvious that she would not be able to avoid it. Her face had already turned pale. The strange monster in the sky had launched an attack! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

‘It seems I’m done for…’

After realizing that she could not escape, Yuelun could only laugh miserably.

“Haha! I only made a simple move, yet you can’t handle it.”

Hearing the monster’s taunt, Yuelun felt furious, but could do nothing about it.

She secretly condensed her spiritual power, channeling it into her Water Sky Sword to activate a forbidden secret technique. However, before she managed to activate it, the spiritual power she had condensed was suppressed.

Damn it!

Knowing that she was no longer able to resist, Yuelun shut her eyes tightly, waiting for death to arrive.

“Damned human, prepare to die! However, I promise that you will die a quick death.”

The monster smiled wickedly as the palm got closer and closer to Yuelun.

At this moment, everything was silent. All everyone could see was the huge palm covered in black fog approaching Yuelun.

“Junior Sister Yuelun, dodge quickly!”

Gao Shun immediately shouted nervously.

At this critical moment, a rusty broken sword flew over.

“Is that…”

Hua Rufeng immediately exclaimed, and everyone turned to look at the direction he was pointing toward.

“It’s the Godsword!”

Zhuge Yueyue shouted happily when she saw the familiar sword. Her entire body was trembling. Even she had panicked when she saw Yuelun in danger.
