432 Unbelievable

As much as they did not want to believe it, the truth was in front of their eyes.

As time passed, the spiritual energy vortex grew more and more turbulent, and the sky above Cloud Sky peak turned dark, as purple lightning began to gather in the clouds.

When Yuelun saw this scene, she sputtered, “How did this guy do it?”

Ye Xuan was becoming more and more unfathomable.

Li Hanyi could only marvel from the side.

‘As expected of Martial Uncle Ye. He actually initiated an epiphany voluntarily.. Such monstrous talent can be said to be unprecedented and unparalleled!’

“This… This is unbelievable…”

Gongsun Shouyue’s body trembled uncontrollably. He had thought that Ye Xuan’s words had just been a joke to infuriate Gao Shun.

How had it turned out to be true?

Obviously, the most shocked one was Gao Shun, who felt like his world had turned upside down.

“No… This is absolutely impossible! How can one initiate one’s own epiphany?”

“This guy must be pretending. There has to be some sort of trick behind this. Just you wait! Once I figure out what it is, I’ll expose you for the fraud you are!”

Gao Shun was about to intervene to try and expose Ye Xuan when a bolt of lightning suddenly flashed across the sky and exploded nearby.

Boom!

It contained the power of a mystic lord realm expert’s attack!

When Gao Shun saw this, he hurriedly retreated several steps.

“What a powerful lightning!”

Everyone’s expression changed when they saw this.

The spiritual pressure bearing down from the sky was vast and mighty, and suppressed those who were present. It was completely different from Hua Rufeng’s epiphany. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After all, Ye Xuan was a top-tier early-stage mystic lord realm expert. The epiphany he was experiencing would cause far more powerful heavenly phenomena.

“Oh my God, is everyone from Cloud Sky peak so monstrous? This is f*cking unreasonable!”

“Isn’t Martial Uncle Ue a little too scary? Isn’t this a proper show of dominance?”

“I thought that Chief Ye Xuan was just bragging. How could this have happened?”

Everyone looked at the terrifying phenomena in the sky in shock and awe.

The spiritual energy contained in the vortex continued to increase over time, until it reached a terrifying level.

At the center of the vortex, Ye Xuan’s eyes were closed.

Indistinctly, a brilliant Golden Lotus of the Great Dao bloomed above Ye Xuan’s head, drawing in the spiritual energy.

When Gongsun Shouyue saw the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, he was dumbfounded.

A Dao body…

When the chiefs noticed his expression, they glanced at Ye Xuan, and then at each other. The shock on each of their faces was evident.

Even Gao Shun, who had doubted Ye Xuan just now, felt complete despair when he saw this scene.

“How did this guy end up having a Dao body? Why did Chief Tian Xuan never mention it?”

“I finally understand why Ye Xuan was chosen to be Chief Tian Xuan’s disciple and to inherit Cloud Sky peak.”

Discussions were rife among the crowd as everyone witnessed this incredulous scene with their very own eyes.

Fortunately, the owner of the Dao body was a cultivator of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

The sudden epiphany made sense now. The Dao body allowed him greater comprehension, after all.

At that moment, the spiritual energy vortex in the sky suddenly turned into a dazzling golden divine dragon that charged toward Ye Xuan.

Roar!

Every scale on the golden divine dragon was shining with bright light. These scales were condensed from the spiritual energy of the surroundings and poured into Ye Xuan’s body in a flash.

Ye Xuan’s face contorted in pain, but he quickly circulated the chaos heart technique and used his mystic lord realm cultivation to suppress the surging spiritual energy.

Ever since he had broken through to the early stage of the mystic lord realm, he had been consolidating his cultivation foundation. Thus, his cultivation level had not increased too much.

However, this was destined to change today, as the vast amount of spiritual energy flooded his body. Ye Xuan even felt his cultivation bottleneck loosening.

As this happened, no one dared to breathe as they stared at Ye Xuan’s figure within the vortex. This included Gao Shun.

Although he was very unconvinced, the truth was right in front of him. The level of talent and strength that Ye Xuan had displayed were unparalleled, and it had given his self-confidence a severe blow.

Most importantly, he could clearly sense the obvious change in Gongsun Shouyue’s attitude toward Ye Xuan.

It seemed that even his status in the Great Wilderness Divine sect was at risk. Although he was unwilling to see this happen, he was also helpless to do anything about it.

A few months ago, Gao Shun was still confident that he had everything in his grasp. He thought that the Great Wilderness Divine sect was under his control and that Ye Xuan was just a useless piece of trash.

However, Ye Xuan had caught up to him, and had now exceeded him.
