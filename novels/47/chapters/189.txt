Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, currently, all of the cultivators had been teleported back, Senior Sister Yue had disappeared, and even her teacher had disappeared.

She was alone again.

Although the mountains and fields were filled with the figures of cultivators, Zhao Yuyan’s heart felt empty, and her expression was desolate.

No matter what, Zhao Yuyan was only a seven-year-old child. Ye Xuan’s kindness to her was like a beautiful dream to her.

However, it was not a dream. At least what had happened to her was real. Her strength had indeed increased greatly, and she had even obtained a powerful demonic beast companion.

Not only that, she had the storage bracelet that her teacher had given her. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhao Yuyan slowly raised her right hand and directed her gaze at the crystalline bracelet. Her eyes were filled with warmth.

This was a gift from her teacher!

Shua! Shua! Shua!

After the mystic realm closed, the cultivators left one after another, and the originally dense crowd instantly decreased by more than half.

Zhao Yuyan looked at the crowd nervously from behind the tree.

Without her teacher by her side, she was still a little nervous in crowded places.

After a while, most of the cultivators at the entrance of the mystic realm left.

“Have they all left?”

Zhao Yuyan blinked her big eyes.

With her current cultivation, she naturally could not detect whether all of the cultivators had left or not. She planned to wait until all the cultivators had left before coming out. Then, she would quietly return to the White Moon Tower to treat her mother.

Due to her childhood experiences, Zhao Yuyan could not change the habits that had been ingrained into her for the time being.

She had done the same thing when she had sneaked into the mystic realm earlier. She had waited for everyone to leave before sneaking into the mystic realm.

Boom!

Just as Zhao Yuyan was about to quietly leave, a powerful energy wave burst forth and suddenly knocked down a nearby tree.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Boom! Boom!

At the same time, powerful energy fluctuations erupted dozens of meters away. Several qi transformation realm cultivators were fighting each other, and were wreaking havoc on the surrounding trees.

Although they were only qi transformation realm cultivators, they were still capable of causing a ruckus.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The sound of fighting could be heard in the surroundings as their attacks collided fiercely. Soon, they gradually approached the area where Zhao Yuyan was.

Seeing this, Zhao Yuyan felt nervous. She quickly hid behind the tree, planning to sneak away after the battle was over.

However, at this moment, one of the cultivators released a sharp saber qi that struck the tree beside Zhao Yuyan.

Then, that cultivator waved the saber in his hand and attacked again.

Seeing this, Zhao Yuyan could not help but panic. Then, she nervously tapped her little feet and instantly arrived ten meters away like a swallow.

Both parties sensed Zhao Yuyan’s aura and immediately narrowed their eyes.

“Who is hiding here?”

Both parties stopped fighting immediately and looked at Zhao Yuyan.

When they realized that Zhao Yuyan was only a little girl who was less than 10 years old, they were shocked. How could such a young child jump so far?

At their age back then, they had not even started cultivating!

Could it be that this little girl was the descendant of a certain expert? The kind that had been groomed since young?

At that moment, both sides did not dare to act rashly.

This little girl was so young, yet she displayed such great strength. Her background was definitely not ordinary.

Immediately, the cultivators from both sides quickly put down their weapons, afraid that if they were to accidentally attract the displeasure of the expert behind this girl.

“Wait, it’s actually you…”

At this moment, one of them looked at Zhao Yuyan and suddenly felt a sense of familiarity. Then, his expression changed.

“Fellow cultivator, do you know this girl?”

The cultivator next to him saw his expression change and immediately displayed a curious expression.

“Quickly leave this place. Don’t get close to this girl. She is a true jinx!”

The cultivator’s expression became extremely grave. He quickly picked up the saber and started running into the distance.

The other cultivator saw this and, although he did not understand what was going on, he still ran as well. Since the other party had reacted so decisively, he followed suit.

“Fellow cultivator, why are you so afraid of that girl? Why did you say that she is a jinx?”

The cultivator in question did not reply. Instead, he hurriedly turned his head to look in the direction of Zhao Yuyan. When he realized that the other party had not chased him, he heaved a sigh of relief and slowly said, “That girl is from the White Moon Tower, and the reincarnation of a jinx!”

“I have a good brother who is an inner sect cultivator from the White Moon Tower. It was from him that I heard the story of this girl!”

“This girl is simply the reincarnation of a jinx. Anyone who gets close to her will encounter all sorts of bad luck. At the very least, their cultivation levels will regress and, at worst, they will die on the spot!”

“If we didn’t retreat in time just now, we might have been affected by that girl’s bad luck and would be in big trouble in the future!”

The cultivator wore a very serious expression.

“Isn’t… isn’t that a little too far-fetched?”

The other cultivator’s expression changed when he heard this, but he did not doubt his words.

“Alright, we have to leave this place as soon as possible!”

The man looked back once more, and only after confirming that Zhao Yuyan was nowhere to be seen did he feel completely at ease.

“However, how has this girl become so strong? Should I inform Li Baijun about this matter?”

Li Baijun was the good brother he had mentioned earlier, an inner sect cultivator from the White Moon Tower.

It was said that this girl’s parents had spent a lot of resources on her. Unfortunately, it was not of much use. Up until now, the girl had been stuck at the refinement realm.

However, from her performance just now, this girl seemed to be a qi transformation realm cultivator.
