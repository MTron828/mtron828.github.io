705 Crystal (Part 1)

At this moment, everyone could only sigh. No one had expected this outcome.

All of the favorites tipped to become the champion had been eliminated, and standing in their place was a six-year-old girl!

When Ye Xuan had first brought her along to the gathering, everyone believed that she was just here to broaden her horizons.

However, she had fought her way through the mass of disciples and even eliminated many disciples that they considered geniuses.

“Hehehe, I’m now invincible among my peers!”

Xiang Yun was happily sitting on the golden throne. However, because the throne was too big, she ended up shifting about and trying to find a comfortable sitting position.

After sitting there foolishly for a moment, she began to size up the golden throne. She even went around to the back and looked around.

“Ooh, what exactly is this?”

Xiang Yun’s eyes were filled with confusion when she saw the golden crystal behind the throne. Somehow, this thing looked rather extraordinary. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It seemed that the power that had made her body feel extremely comfortable just now had come from this crystal.

Because she was very interested in it, she decided to take it out and bring it back with her.

However, after expending a great deal of effort, this crystal did not even budge, which made her unhappy. Then, she raised her hammer to smash it.

Upon seeing this, everyone’s jaws dropped in surprise.

“Could it be that she wants to tear down this champion’s throne?”

The crowd was dumbfounded, but also helpless. After all, they were all stuck outside the ancient realm, and the only ones who could do anything were Hua Rufeng and that disciple from the Godwind Academy.

“Junior Martial Sister, don’t do it!”

Hua Rufeng immediately shouted anxiously.

However, they were quite some distance apart, and Xiang Yun was already fully focused on the crystal.

‘This beautiful stone must be worth a lot of money, and the energy that I absorbed just now felt really great!’

‘I have to bring it back for Teacher to examine. Then, I’ll embed it into my bed!’

‘Haha! Sleeping will feel so awesome in the future!’

Then, Xiang Yun took action. She raised her hammer and smashed it onto the golden throne without hesitation.

At this moment, the entire ancient realm began to tremble.

Everyone finally understood what she wanted to do. She did not want to destroy the throne, but she simply wanted the golden crystal behind the throne.

“Heavens! She actually wants to take away the crystal!”

“Doesn’t she know that it contains an immense amount of power? It was formed by the ancient formation!”

“The only other person who dared to do this was Chief Tian Xuan. However, even he failed.”

At this moment, everyone was looking on in excitement and anticipation. Would this little girl be able to do something that Chief Tian Xuan could not?

At this moment, even Ye Xuan’s face darkened involuntarily.

This little girl was full of surprises. What even possessed her to think this way?

In the ancient realm, Xiang Yun had just smashed the throne with everything she had, which caused the path leading to the throne to tremble.However, the golden throne remained undamaged, and the crystal had not budged.

Frustrated, she put the hammer aside and used her hands to grab the crystal, trying to pull it out like a weed.

“Ufffffff”

She groaned as she used all of her strength. If she did not get this crystal, she would never leave.

“Pfft”

After seeing such a scene, even Daoist Canghai could not help but laugh out loud. He looked at Ye Xuan and said, “Little Brother Ye Xuan, this disciple of yours is really quite audacious.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan also felt very embarrassed. He could only smile and did not say anything.

Daoist Xu Yun said with a serious expression, “This energy crystal has been around for a long time, and it contains the power of the laws of the ancient realm, which is why it’s so strong.”

“Prying it out is extremely difficult. Back then, your teacher, Tian Xuan, tried to do the same, but he failed to budge this energy crystal, so he had no choice but to give up.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was stunned. His teacher had also tried to pull this off? However, before he could ask about it further, Daoist Xu Yun continued, “It seems that some people managed to loosen this crystal. There are many records of this in many ancient books.”

“Without exception, those who managed to loosen this crystal were all top geniuses who went on to have amazing achievements.”

“Even so, it was only to the extent of loosening it. Taking it away is impossible. Perhaps the only way to do so is to obtain the approval of the laws of the ancient realm.”

Ye Xuan became somewhat expectant when he heard this
