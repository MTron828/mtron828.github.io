“Hehe, Brother Mu is really bold. You have my admiration.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

One of the members in the four-man team said this, but another member snorted and said, “Enough with the pleasantries. Hurry up and get in here. Let’s get this over with.”

“Sure”

“Third Sister”

!!

Before Zhuge Yueyue could pull her back, Xiang Yun had already rushed straight into the crowd.

Well, so much for the battle plan

Hua Rufeng had made preparations, but the whole plan was thrown into disarray by Xiang Yun’s impulsive actions.

She held her hammer in one hand, while counting pointing with the other hand with a serious expression.

“One, two Alright, these five are enough. Leave these five to me.”

After hearing this, the atmosphere instantly fell silent.

“F*ck, which faction does this little girl come from? She is too arrogant!”

The five people who were lucky enough to be chosen were infuriated.

Seeing that they were not among the five people, Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy felt relieved. On the other hand, Xu Changqing’s face had already darkened, as he was among those five people.

Did he look as weak as the other four? Damn it!

After choosing her five opponents, Xiang Yun became impatient when she saw that the five people were just standing there.

She could still clearly remember that before she left, Ye Xuan had told her to help her first sister clear out all of the obstacles along the way so that Zhuge Yueyue could emerge victorious. This was the basis behind her actions.

“How arrogant!”

Who could stand being taunted like this?

Among the five people, a young man unleashed a saber beam toward Xiang Yun.

Seeing this, Xiang Yun smiled and said, “Bring it on!”

She raised her hammer and charged forward. Then, she swung her hammer and shattered the incoming saber beam with ease.

“F*ck”

The young man felt the saber tremble in his hands and cursed out loud.

“Why is this little girl so powerful?”

At this moment, the other participants were dumbfounded. They had not expected this little girl to be so strong.

The four of them looked at each other, and then launched an attack at the same time, trying to eliminate her as quickly as possible.

Several fierce attacks engulfed Xiang Yun. However, even though she was going up against four opponents, she was still holding her own.

Seeing this scene, Xu Changqing could not hold himself back anymore. He shouted, “Come on! Who’s afraid of who!”

When Xu Changqing joined the fight, Xiang Yun was finally pushed back and forced to retreat.

Zhuge Yueyue and Hua Rufeng did not just stand by and watch.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them instantly launched their attacks to help her, but Mu Beichen and the Reincarnation Fairy suddenly appeared and blocked their attacks.

At this moment, a chaotic battle had broken out.

“Oh my god, this little girl is really too awesome. She’s actually fighting against five people alone.”

“How bold! How capable!”

Everyone watching the fight unfold on the screen was dumbfounded.

Xiang Yun was calmly fending off the attacks, while Hua Rufeng had found himself going up against the Reincarnation Fairy, and Zhuge Yueyue was up against Mu Beichen.

Zhuge Yueyue wanted to help Xiang Yun, but Mu Beichen stopped her.

Facing Zhuge Yueyue, Mu Beichen smiled and said, “I have been wanting to spar with you for a long time. Now that the opportunity has arrived, let’s have a good fight!”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue did not let her guard down.

After all, Mu Beichen was a well-known genius in the East continent. Moreover, he was ranked first. Wherever he went, he was the focus of attention.

The two of them actually had something in common, which was that they were both sword cultivators.

The two Sword Dao geniuses looked at each other. Who would emerge victorious?

“Alright, enough with the pleasantries. Let’s just fight,” Zhuge Yueyue said with a cold expression. She had no intention of backing down. She wanted to become the champion to make her teacher proud.

Seeing this, Mu Beichen’s lips curled up slightly and he instantly drew his sword, which released waves of gray light.

“This sword Could it be the Xuanming Sword?”

When the crowd saw this sword, everyone was shocked.

The sword in Mu Beichen’s hand was the treasured sword used by Daoist Canghai, the Xuanming Sword. It was the symbol of the previous sect masters. Daoist Canghai had originally given it to ElderTongtian, but what was unexpected was that Elder Tongtian actually gave it to Mu Beichen so early?

When she noticed the sword, Zhuge Yueyue took out her Cloud Sky Sword, which drew gasps from the crowd.

“These two swords are about to clash again. After all, Daoist Canghai used the Xuanming Sword to compete against Chief Tian Xuan back then”
