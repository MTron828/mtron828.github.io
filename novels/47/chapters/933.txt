934 Beatdown

Ye Xuan could no longer ignore this annoying fellow, and even drew his Godsword.

However, before Ye Xuan could make a move, Yanran took the initiative to punch the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

“You’re really noisy!”

Yanran was also infuriated at this moment. Her originally romantic atmosphere was completely ruined by the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

“Oh my!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes widened as he watched the angry Yanran send the Thunder-Devouring Beast flying ten thousand meters away with a punch. It seemed that his woman was quite fierce.

This was the first time he had seen Yanran so angry, and had not expected it to be over this matter. It was a terrifying sight, as she did not stop with just one punch.

She clenched her fist and punched the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s head again and again. Violence reigned supreme.

Honestly, Ye Xuan could not really bring himself to keep watching, as the scene was quite tragic. The Thunder-Devouring Beast’s face was now swollen and bruised, and he no longer had the domineering and majestic demeanor from earlier.

“Big Brother, don’t just look. Hurry up and save me!”

Once Yanran was enraged, even the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not resist, and repeatedly asked Ye Xuan for help. It had all happened too quickly.

Fortunately, his skin was thick enough and could endure beatings. Otherwise, he would have been beaten to the brink of death.

Hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s pleas for help, Ye Xuan looked at his angry little girlfriend and could only turn his back awkwardly, as if he had not heard the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s pleas for help at all.

Moments later, another loud explosion rang out, and the Thunder-Devouring Beast was once again sent flying 10,000 meters away by Yanran. Its huge figure smashed into the side of a tall mountain.

After that, the anger in Yanran’s anger finally simmered down, as she slowly inhaled and exhaled to calm herself down.

Turning around to take a look, she saw Ye Xuan staring at her with wide eyes, and a hint of panic appeared in her eyes.

She suddenly realized that her actions just now were too rough. Did she scare Ye Xuan?

She briefly recalled what her senior sister had told her, which was that she had to be gentler and considerate. She had also been told to appear weak, even if she was powerful, so that the other party would want to protect her.

Thinking this, Yanran became nervous.

After pondering for a moment, Yanran muttered with a serious expression, “That isn’t very genuine, is it?”

Yanran had always liked to do whatever she wanted, and putting up a facade was not something she thought was necessary.

After thinking about it seriously, Yanran decided not to pretend to be gentle. In any case, Ye Xuan was her sweetheart, and if they were going to be together, it would be best if they were open and straightforward with each other.

Having made her decision, Yanran went over to Ye Xuan and asked, “Was I too rough just now?”

Hearing this question, Ye Xuan immediately felt guilty. However, this question was a dangerous one.

Ye Xuan desperately waved his hand and said, “That’s impossible. My Yanran is extremely gentle. How could she be rough?”

“Tell me the truth!”

When Yanran heard Ye Xuan’s words, she knew that he was just spouting nonsense, so she said this with an unhappy expression.

After seeing Yanran’s stern expression, Ye Xuan could not hold it in anymore and laughed.

“In that case, I’ll tell you the truth. Cough cough, you were indeed a little rough.”

“But… No matter how rough you are, you are still the person I love the most.”

Seeing Ye Xuan’s serious expression, Yanran understood that Ye Xuan was not teasing her, and rejoiced. It seemed that she had chosen the right man.

Coincidentally, Ye Xuan really liked Yanran’s character. She would do whatever she said and would never do anything unreasonable. She was straightforward, and would not back down from a fight when it mattered.

Furthermore, she was often very considerate of him, and would do her utmost to help him out where she could. He felt that if he could marry her, then his life would be half successful.

Thinking back, he was really happy he had chosen to court her and give her the immortal heavenly treasure back in the ancient tomb.

He then turned around and saw the Thunder-Devouring Beast struggling to get up from a huge pit, bruised and swollen. No matter how one looked at this fellow, he looked very miserable.

“Hiss… It hurts, it hurts…”

“This woman is too ruthless. Does she not care how I feel at all?” the Thunder-Devouring Beast said indignantly.

Even at this moment, he did not understand what he had done wrong. He had not provoked her, and had only been learning how to flirt from his big brother.

Why did he suddenly get beaten up?

At this moment, Ye Xuan also approached the Thunder-Devouring Beast. Looking at its miserable appearance, he laughed heartily.

“Pfft… You asked for this when you kept interjecting…”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast complained unhappily, “You didn’t keep your word. You promised me earlier that you would protect me. Why did you pretend not to hear me when I was beaten up just now?”

Hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s question, Ye Xuan felt a little guilty. He turned around to look at Yanran and could only say awkwardly, “I won’t hide it from you. In this world, other than my wife, I can help you deal with anyone.”

“If my wife bullies you, then I can only say sorry. I can’t help you with that.”

“In fact, if she asks me to, I’m afraid I’ll help her and beat you up as well. Do you understand?”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
