927 Why? Just why?

At this moment, the lightning-attribute laws in Ye Xuan’s body had also reached a higher level, and within his three Dao Flowers, arcs of purple lightning could be seen flashing between them.

The three Dao Flowers further strengthened his mastery of the lightning attribute, which further enhanced his potential as well.

It seemed that his path to the eternal realm had just become smoother. Furthermore, if his plan to subdue this beast came to fruition, he would be able to repeat this process until the lightning-attribute laws in his body reached perfection.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan’s gaze toward the Thunder-Devouring Beast became even more ferocious as he muttered, “Hehe! Little Thunder-Devouring Beast, are you ready to be punished?”

Seeing Ye Xuan’s evil smile, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s heart trembled, and it felt that something was wrong.

“Sh*t! I’m done for!”

Ye Xuan immediately charged toward the Thunder-Devouring Beast, all the while muttering happily to himself.

“Surrender, little Thunder-Devouring Beast.”

The Thunder-Devouring Beast was already cursing Ye Xuan inwardly.

‘Damn this human! He was making a fool of me!’

It had been so happy just now, but then the situation suddenly turned on its head. At that point, when it saw Ye Xuan absorbing the lightning bolts, it realized that Ye Xuan was just playing around with him.

After figuring this out, Thunder-Devouring Beast no longer wanted to fight. Instead, it started looking around for opportunities to escape.

It did not want to become this person’s plaything!

Thus, at the first possible opportunity, it turned tail and fled.

“Uh…”

Seeing that the huge creature in the sky actually turned around and fled in an instant, everyone was dumbfounded.

Was this Thunder-Devouring Beast really a Thunder-Devouring Beast?

They could not understand what was going on.

“Can someone explain to me what exactly happened?”

A muscular man scratched the back of his head and asked.

“I’m not sure.”

Everyone pinched their cheeks, trying to figure out if this was really happening or not.

The awesome battle that they had been anticipating had fizzled out.

On the other hand, after discovering that the Thunder-Devouring Beast had escaped, Ye Xuan gave chase immediately, which gave rise to the scene of a human chasing a huge beast around.

It was as if the mouse was chasing the cat.

Not only were the spectators confused, but the Thunder-Devouring Beast was also confused.

No matter how it thought about it, it could not understand how Ye Xuan could easily travel through its spatial domain unhindered. It was on the verge of despair.

“Human, why do you have to chase me? I don’t think I’ve ever provoked you.”

This was the first time its spatial domain had failed it. What was with this human? Not only was the divine lightning that it was best at useless against this human, but this human even absorbed it to become stronger!

Now, this fellow had actually rendered its spatial domain useless!

Was this fellow born to counter its abilities? The Thunder-Devouring Beast felt like crying. However, he had no time to do so, as Ye Xuan was quickly catching up.

This scoundrel was so unreasonable!

“Hahaha!”

Hearing the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s question, Ye Xuan grinned and said, “Weren’t you very arrogant just now? Why are you suddenly afraid now?”

Ye Xuan had not forgotten about how embarrassing he had looked earlier while facing off with the Thunder-Devouring Beast.

Damn it! This beast had almost scared him off!

It was really far too good and posturing and acting tough.

At this point, the Thunder-Devouring Beast started to break down. It said, “Do you think I had it easy all these years? There have been people coming to this ancient palace since forever, and every single one of them wants to snatch my immortal heavenly treasures!”

“All of you are bad guys! That’s why I had to learn how to scare everyone away!”

“Can’t you see that my beard has turned white even though I’m so young? I don’t leave this place to provoke others, and just want to stay here and live my life in peace. What did I do wrong?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After saying this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast could not help but start to shed tears.

‘I just want to quietly grow stronger. Why is it so difficult?’

Ye Xuan actually felt moved by the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s words. Perhaps many people in this world had the same thoughts.

Among the vast population of humans and beasts, many people only wanted to live simply. Even if their lives were extremely difficult, they would not provoke others.

However, this world did not allow them to do that!

This world was full of competition. Even if one did not compete with others for resources or treasures, someone would come looking for you to take what you had or to take advantage of you.

This was the truth of this world!
