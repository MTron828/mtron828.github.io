942 Shocking Killer Move!

“Hahaha! I’m a genius to have chosen to follow Big Brother. He really is too awesome!”

“From now on, with him protecting me, I won’t have anyone to fear!”

Thinking this, the Thunder-Devouring Beast secretly rejoiced, and the smile on its face became even brighter.

If he could learn some powerful moves from Ye Xuan, then he too would be able to show off like this in the future.

As Ye Xuan’s terrifying attack descended, the flood dragon was struggling to withstand it, and was twisting and turning its body frantically to dodge the bolts of divine lightning.

However, the lightning bolts seemed endless, and he could not escape the range of the attack.

“This can’t be real! How could I be pushed to this state so easily?”

The flood dragon once again shouted hysterically. It did not believe that it would actually lose to a human. It was an eternal realm expert and a descendant of the divine dragons. How could it lose?

After roaring several times, the flood dragon completely unleashed its full power, causing the entire East Sea to churn and roil.

Everyone was watching the battle between the two experts closely, afraid to blink in case they missed something.

“Dear god… They are too powerful! Were it not for the restrictions of the ancient palace, the entire East Sea would be torn apart by their battle,” someone said with an expression of lingering fear.

Ye Xuan was hovering in the sky, as casual waves of his hands caused more and more bolts of divine lightning to strike. At this moment, he seemed like the god of thunder!

Up until now, he had not even used the Godsword, and was only relying on the power of the lightning-attribute laws he had comprehended to attack the flood dragon.

His increased comprehension of the laws after absorbing and devouring the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s divine lightning had even pushed the Endless Lightning technique to the immortal grade.

However, despite this, Ye Xuan could still see some remaining flaws. Even though these divine lightning bolts were very powerful, it was still very difficult to rely on their power to kill the flood dragon, though this was mostly due to the difference in their respective cultivation levels.

“Hehe…This worm still had some strength,” he muttered to himself.

‘Forget it, I won’t continue to torture him like this, otherwise the lightning energy I absorbed from Little Thunder will be fully consumed. I have to quickly end this battle.’

Thinking this, Ye Xuan started to get serious, and he smiled at the flood dragon.

When the flood dragon saw this, it felt even more frightened. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Dammit, what is this kid’s background? Why is he so terrifying?”

The flood dragon cursed inwardly. At this moment, there was nothing it could do. All delusions about Ye Xuan being the same as the Thunder-Devouring Beast had completely vanished.

This fellow was not just for show!

Honestly, it was already thinking of ways to escape. However, there were so many experts watching this fight, so if it ran away now, its reputation would nosedive, and it would no longer dare to show its face in public.

It was precisely because of this that it could only force itself to say, “Hmph! Is that all you have? If you have any other tricks, then hurry up and use them!”

Although that was what it said, the flood dragon was already panicking. It even regretted saying those words. Was it not clearly asking for a beating?

Pride, oh pride, why was it so important?

Sadly, it cared too much about its reputation to run away.

When Ye Xuan heard this, he did not say anything, which gave the flood dragon renewed hope.

‘Could it be that this brat is intimidated by my domineering aura?’

Thinking this, the flood dragon was extremely excited, and it immediately struck its most arrogant and domineering pose.

Then, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said with a smile, “In that case, if I don’t let you experience my true strength, you’ll look down on me.”

As soon as Ye Xuan finished speaking, the flood dragon immediately panicked.

F*ck! It backfired!

Could this brat really have not used his full strength yet? It was using its full strength, yet this brat was still holding back? Impossible!

At this moment, the flood dragon’s willpower seemed to have wilted, and its heart felt cold.

Ye Xuan suddenly flew up ten thousand meters in the air and stretched out his hands to perform several hand seals. A destructive force began to brew.

“Oh my god!”

At this moment, everyone was panicking. In the sky, a terrifying figure had appeared behind Ye Xuan. This figure was a projection of Ye Xuan’s own body, except much, much larger.

A moment later, dozens of these figures appeared, one after another. Each one emitted a terrifying aura.

The surroundings had completely fallen silent.

“Oh my god, is this for real? Is that really something that humans can do?”

Everyone was in disbelief, and they could not believe what they were seeing.

Furthermore, when they locked gazes with these figures, it felt as if the god of death was staring at them. Many experts quickly averted their gazes.

“Could this be an immortal-grade divine power?”

“No way! This divine power has definitely transcended the limits of an immortal-grade divine power!”

“That’s crazy! How did this fellow accomplish this?”

“What exactly is this move?”

Everyone was panicking and holding their breaths at the moment. Even the sealed immortal realm experts, as well as the flood dragon, were shaking in their boots.
