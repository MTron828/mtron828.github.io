When the other chiefs saw this, they gloated as well.

In the past, Gao Shun had been extremely arrogant just because he was the law enforcement elder and the only other mystic lord realm expert in the Great Wilderness Divine sect aside from Gongsun Shouyue.

Moreover, under Gao Shun’s leadership, Hidden Sword peak had, to some extent, suppressed all of the other peaks. Thus, they had no complaints about this situation.

Having another mystic lord realm expert that could suppress Gao Shun’s arrogance was naturally a good thing.

Gao Shun was naturally able to detect the changes in everyone’s expression. Although he was livid, he could only glare fiercely.

“Hmph! You… You’ve won!”

After Gao Shun dejectedly said this, and then turned around and left in a sorry state.

He did not want to stay on Cloud Sky peak for a second longer. The events that had taken place today were too embarrassing.

“Senior Brother, don’t rush. The road on my peak is quite slippery. Don’t fall down!”

“Whenever you miss me, remember to come over and play!”

When Gao Shun, who was heading out, heard this, he almost fell down.

This guy was really too much!

Everyone’s expression twitched when they heard this.

They did not expect Ye Xuan to be so sarcastic.

However, they were gloating inwardly.

Who asked Gao Shun to be so arrogant all the time?

This is what karma looked like.

Liang Dahai was the most satisfied.

After all, before Ye Xuan, Liang Dahai was the one who was always in conflict with Gao Shun. Furthermore, he had been constantly losing to Gao Shun because his cultivation level was weaker.

Liang Dahai still remembered Gao Shun’s smug look every time that happened.

“Hahaha! Junior Brother Ye, good job!” Liang Dahai laughed loudly and walked over to pat Ye Xuan’s shoulder, not hiding his joy at all.

Liang Dahai’s personality had always been straightforward.

Yuelun also laughed.

“Junior Brother Ye, you’re really too much, but I like it very much!”

“I reckon that when Senior Brother Gao returns to Hidden Sword peak, he’ll break a bunch of artifacts to vent his anger. He’s always been a prideful person.”

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say anything.

Just then, Gongsun Shouyue walked over.

Although he felt a little bad for Gao Shun, he did not say much. After all, it was Gao Shun who provoked Ye Xuan first. Furthermore, the enmity between Cloud Sky peak and Hidden Sword peak had been going on for thousands of years. They were all used to it.

“Senior Brother Gongsun…”

When the chiefs saw Gongsun Shouyue walking over, they quickly bowed respectfully and stopped the discussion.

“Now that the matter is over, all of you should leave. The Seven Peaks competition is about to begin, so everyone should be prepared!”

“Yes, Sect Master,” everyone said in unison and then left.

Before he left, Gongsun Shouyue looked at Ye Xuan meaningfully, his eyes full of satisfaction.

Previously, he was a little worried about whether Cloud Sky peak would be able to survive after Tian Xuan left.

Those worries had now vanished.

“Junior Brother Ye, I’ll be leaving first!”

“Your Cloud Sky peak should also prepare for the competition.”

Gongsun Shouyue patted Ye Xuan’s shoulder and then left.

Soon, Cloud Sky peak became quiet again. Only Ye Xuan, his disciples, Yuelun, Li Hanyi and Hua Rufeng remained.

Seeing that everyone had left, Yuelun revealed a reluctant expression.

“Junior Brother Ye, I’ll be going back as well. I’ll see you on the day of the Seven Peaks competition.”

“Mm! In the future, if Senior Sister is free, you can come by and visit,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

Yuelun sighed inwardly. Was this guy not going to ask her to stay?

“Hanyi, let’s just leave!”

Yuelun looked at Ye Xuan with a hint of disappointment, and then left with Li Hanyi.

After the two of them left, Hua Rufeng was the only outsider left on Cloud Sky peak.

‘Martial Nephew Hua, are you planning to stick around? Cloud Sky peak doesn’t have an extra portion of food lying around for you,’ Ye Xuan looked at Hua Rufeng and thought to himself.

Was this kid going to stay on Cloud Sky peak?

Hua Rufeng smiled gently.

“Martial Uncle Ye, I haven’t thanked you for your guidance just now. If not for that, I wouldn’t have broken through so easily!”

“It’s just a small matter.” Ye Xuan nodded indifferently.

However, Ye Xuan became even more satisfied with Hua Rufeng.

This kid was quite a good person. At the very least, he had taken good care of Cloud Sky peak all these years. Even when everyone looked down on him, Hua Rufeng still did not forget his manners and remained respectful to Ye Xuan.

“Alright! There’s no need to trouble yourself over this matter. As the eldest senior disciple of our sect, there are a lot of things that require your attention. You should head back first,” Ye Xuan said, waving his hand. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
