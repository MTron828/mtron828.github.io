875 Another Immortal Bone

Fenghua Tian had wanted to become a disciple of Cloud Sky peak, but since neither Ye Xuan nor Zhuge Yueyue were taking in disciples, he ended up becoming Ao Lei’s disciple.

Over the past 30 days, thanks to his extraordinary talent, his cultivation level had skyrocketed, and he was competing with Hua Rufeng, who had reached the mystic lord realm thanks to this opportunity.

All in all, the sect’s cultivators all experienced a leap in strength from the opportunity, and they were completely different from how they were a month ago.

Now, they were looking forward to the competition, and could not wait to showcase the results of their hard work.

In the blink of an eye, another 30 days passed, and…

Suddenly, a huge explosion erupted from Cloud Sky Cave, and bolts of divine lightning descended, shattering the silent atmosphere.

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue, who was immersed in cultivation, opened her eyes and looked at her teacher in astonishment.

Ye Xuan’s entire body was emitting blue and red light, and immortal qi surrounded his body.

“Teacher…”

“Could it be that Teacher is going to become a true immortal?”

She looked at her teacher in a daze, her eyes full of admiration. Moments later, Ye Xuan suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes seemed to be as deep as the abyss.

At this moment, the entire Cloud Sky Cave seemed to be filled with the aura of the Great Dao, which also benefited Zhuge Yue.

Ye Xuan stretched out his left palm to take a look at it. After sensing the huge changes in his body, he became extremely excited. The Chaos Sacred Body really lived up to its reputation. It was really too powerful. At this moment, Ye Xuan could clearly sense every change in his body. Thanks to the improved Chaos Sacred Body, he would be able to comprehend immortal-grade cultivation much more easily.

There was a mark on his forehead that would in time transform into a Heavenly Eye, which could pierce the veil and view the mysteries of the Great Dao.

Ye Xuan clenched his fists tightly, as Zhuge Yeuyue came over and said, “Congratulations, Teacher!”

He raised his head and looked at his eldest disciple with a smile on his face. The current Zhuge Yueyue was a completely different person from before, both in terms of strength and temperament.

“Haha, good, very good.”

Ye Xuan held Zhuge Yueyue’s arm and probed her cultivation, and was pleasantly surprised.

“It really is an immortal bone!”

His guess had been right, after all. Once she cultivated the completed Nine Serenities of Frost technique, her divine bone had successfully been transformed. Furthermore, she had broken through to the supreme realm.

“Alright, Yueyue, you’ve already undergone an earth-shattering transformation. After mastering the Nine Serenities of Frost technique, it will be much easier for you to cultivate in the future.”

“Sit down properly. I will teach you a sword technique today.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes widened in joy. After all, her teacher’s Sword Dao was magnificent, so any sword technique he taught her would be extremely powerful.

Sitting cross-legged beside Ye Xuan obediently, she said with anticipation, “Teacher, I’m ready. Let’s begin.”

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s impatient look, Ye Xuan’s face also revealed a brilliant smile. He immediately took out the Cloud Heaven Sword and placed it in front of him.

“The sword technique that teacher is going to teach you now is the World Slash. Watch carefully.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand and tapped Zhuge Yueyue’s forehead. A wisp of golden light instantly surged into Zhuge Yueyue’s body, causing her to stagger.

She forced herself to maintain consciousness and concentrate on observing how this set of sword moves was executed. Zhuge Yueyue could not help but take a few deep breaths after watching it for a while. This sword technique was really too terrifying!

Not too long ago, she had been fortunate enough to witness Ye Xuan use this move to kill the golden-furred growler ancestor. However, at that time, she did not know the mysteries contained in it. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Now, she realized that this move was even more powerful than the sword door!
