658 Xie Tianyu, Revitalized!

“Dark origin pills?”

As he muttered, Ye Xuan carefully examined their effects and discovered that they were excellent recovery pills that also boosted one’s cultivation.

That being said, it was not as effective as the immortal-grade recovery pills he had received from the system before. Still, they might come in handy someday.

Then, a flash of insight arrived as he looked at Yuelun. These ordinary soul-returning pills were no longer useful, so perhaps they could be put to good use as gifts for her.

After all, she had been stuck at the peak of the mystic lord realm for some time now and had been unable to break through. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If he were to give her a few pills at this crucial moment, she would definitely be touched, right? He might even earn himself the kiss he had missed out on previously.

While Ye Xuan was thinking about it, Yuelun suddenly noticed Ye Xuan’s mischievous gaze and became nervous.

Could it be that this kid was thinking about that kind of thing again?

She decided to ask him directly.

“What’s the matter?”

“Ahem, actually, it’s nothing. I just suddenly thought of something happy. Senior Sister, after the gathering is over, come over to Cloud Sky peak. I have something for you.”

“This…”

After hearing these words, Yuelun immediately started panicking. Could it be that he was going to confess?

“Alright… I understand. I’ll find some time to go over later.”

Yuelun’s voice trembled. She did not know what Ye Xuan was going to give her, but coming from him, it had to be something extraordinary.

Just as the gathering was about to commence, Daoist Gu Hao, who was still in a daze in the sky, finally regained his senses.

He stared at Ye Xuan from afar and returned to where the Supreme Divine sect’s cultivators were gathered.

“Master…”

Daoist Black Iron hurriedly rushed over. He looked at his master and wanted to say something, but was stopped by Daoist Gu Hao.

After that, Daoist Gu Hao immediately summoned Xie Tianyu. After all, the latter was the strongest person among the younger generation of the Supreme Divine sect’s disciples.

However, after being defeated by Zhuge Yueyue previously, his confidence had been affected. As such, in preparation for this gathering, Daoist Gu Hao had given him guidance and taught him some secret techniques.

“Tianyu, whether the Supreme Divine sect can regain its reputation depends on you.”

“Ye Xuan is indeed very strong, and even I can’t defeat him. However, his disciple is definitely not that strong. This matter will be left to you.”

Hearing this, Xie Tianyu smiled and replied, “Grandmaster, you don’t have to worry at all. I’ll definitely return triumphantly.”

“Even though I lost last time, I’m different now.”

“If I were to fight her again, there’s a 90% chance that I’ll be able to defeat her!”

Xie Tianyu was full of confidence. He believed that his previous loss was due to the fact that his divine powers and secret techniques were weaker than hers.

Now that he had obtained the legacy and teachings of his grandmaster, and mastered powerful heaven-grade divine powers, victory was within his grasp!

“Very well, I’ll await the good news.”

“For now, you should go and prepare yourself. I’m afraid it won’t be long before the peak is fully opened.”

With that, Daoist Gu Hao walked over to Daoist Canghai.

“Hehe, Daoist Gu Hao, how do you feel now?”

Daoist Canghai could not help but poke fun at him.

Daoist Gu Hao’s face darkened as he said, “So what?”

“It was just a spar now. If it was a real life-and-death battle, it’s hard to say who would win.”

He did not want to admit defeat.

“Hehe, keep telling yourself that. You were defeated by Tian Xuan back then, and now you’re defeated by his disciple. This is really…”

Daoist Xu Yun did not hold back with his words either.

A flame of anger burned in Daoist Gu Hao’s heart.

He had really lost his dignity today. This was really too humiliating.

“Tsk, Daoist Xu Yun, you can be as arrogant as you want. Although I’ve failed, do you think you can defeat Ye Xuan?” Daoist Gu Hao immediately retorted.

They were all very clear about Ye Xuan’s combat strength.

After hearing these words, Daoist Xu Yun remained silent for a while, before finally saying, “Hehe, so what? Even if I can’t win, I won’t end up like you.”

“You were the one that started showing off and got yourself into that situation in the first place. Do you think you’re invincible?”

“People like you will suffer losses sooner or later. That’s what you get for trying to be pretentious. Tsk…”

“Damn it!”

After calming himself down for a while, Daoist Gu Hao said, “What are you being so arrogant for? The final outcome has yet to be decided. Who says that my Supreme Divine sect has no chance of winning?”

“This gathering is not for us, but for the younger generation to prove their worth! Just wait and see.”
