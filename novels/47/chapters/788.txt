789 Soul Beckoning Banner

Ye Xuan had combined the Sword Dao Door and Endless Lightning techniques into this even more powerful move.

If he really had to name this move, it could only be called Heavenly Punishment.

“Unimaginable. This is truly unimaginable.”

“Such a genius in the Dao of the Sword has actually appeared in this backward East continent…”

At this moment, even Mengyu could not help but exclaim in surprise. Even she felt threatened by Ye Xuan’s Sword Dao. If she guessed correctly, this person was her biggest obstacle.

However, she was very puzzled. It had only been a hundred years. How did such a brilliant figure appear in the East continent?

Where did he come from?

“Damn it! This guy still had such a powerful trump card!”

At this moment, Heavenly King Li had clearly realized what the outcome of the actual battle would be.

He really could not have expected Ye Xuan to possess so many powerful and mystical divine powers.

After the Heavenly Punishment was condensed, it released an endless amount of pressure. Accompanied by the rolling thunder, it expelled all the darkness around it. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It had only been a short while, but the formation that the seven strange monsters had condensed already suffered heavy damage. Even its power had begun to weaken.

Heavenly King Li stood guard at the main position. When he saw that his colleagues were about to collapse, he immediately understood that they were in trouble. had suffered a certain amount of damage from the impact just now.

“Big Brother, if the situation continues to progress like this, we will definitely lose. Why don’t we retreat?”

The arrogance on West Heavenly King’s face was gone. His expression was now one of panic.

“Retreat? How are we going to retreat? That guy has us all in his sights! If we cannot defeat his move, we won’t be able to escape,” Heavenly King Li said.

“This b*stard! Since he’s pushed me this far, then he can’t blame me for this.”

After pondering for a while, Heavenly King Li’s expression suddenly turned terrifying as he angrily said this.

As soon as he finished speaking, he took out something.

Soul Beckoning Banner!

As he waved it, thousands of vengeful spirits appeared!

The vengeful spirits in the Soul Beckoning Banner had already been infected by the strange power and were extremely ferocious.

“A new change in the situation has appeared…”

The people began to panic again when they saw the vengeful spirits flying in the sky. Their legs began to tremble.

At this moment, Gao Shun smashed a huge rock in front of him angrily. He gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it! These evil monsters actually refined such an evil weapon!”

“It’s no wonder they keep invading other worlds. It’s probably to feed this Soul Beckoning Banner!”

Such a shameless and evil thing ignited a raging fire in Gao Shun’s heart. Although he did not think of himself as a good person, he would never stoop to that extent.

Although he liked to use words to provoke others, he never really harmed them. These strange monsters had actually slaughtered countless people in order to create a heinous weapon like the Soul Beckoning Banner.

When the hundreds and thousands of vengeful spirits emerged, Ye Xuan frowned, and a raging fire burned in his heart.

He could even sense the souls of some disciples from other forces among these vengeful spirits.

“Haha!”

Heavenly King Li laughed impudently and said, “You are indeed strong, but it’s not enough. I’ll use this to play with you now!”

“The Soul Beckoning Banner is one of the strongest weapons of our master. It even uses the power of our master to nurture the vengeful spirits within.”

“Its power is not something you can imagine. It can easily destroy the world. Are you prepared to die now?”

Heavenly King Li instantly released tens of thousands of vengeful spirits, enveloping the entirety of Sky Mountain in black fog. It felt like these vengeful spirits were about to devour everyone alive.

After seeing that the situation was dire, Gao Shun attacked without hesitation, releasing his supreme realm aura.

“Follow my lead and release your power. we must stabilize the defensive formation.”

After Gao Shun gave the order, the millions of cultivators on Sky Mountain did not hesitate to mobilize their power to strengthen the defensive formation to prevent the vengeful spirits from breaking in.

Among these vengeful spirits, there were some that were extremely powerful and had even reached the supreme realm.

Even if they went all out, they would not be able to hold on for long. Thankfully, the elders of the Great Wilderness Divine sect arrived to stabilize the formation.

The Great Wilderness Divine sect was also giving it their all.

“We must hold on until more reinforcements arrive,” someone shouted.

At that moment, another figure appeared in the sky. Although his hair was now white, he exuded an extremely powerful aura as he hovered steadily in the air above Sky Mountain.

With a casual wave of his hand, the power of an ancient realm expert was infused into the formation, making it impregnable.

“It’s Daoist Yi Feng! The grandmaster is here to help us!”

When the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect saw the old man rushing over at the critical moment, they were so happy that they almost jumped up in joy.
