While they were in discussion, the area surrounding the county suddenly began to shake.

“What’s happening?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The two of them narrowed their eyes.

In the sky, two figures exuding powerful auras were engaged in a frenzied battle.

The strength of the two combatants was extremely terrifying, and each attack could easily tear space apart.

Even from several hundred kilometers away, the spiritual power fluctuations were enough to make people pale.

Boom! Boom!

Tyrannical energy wreaked havoc in the sky, and spatial cracks appeared everywhere.

“Such power! Which experts are fighting?”

“I can sense their auras even from hundreds of miles away. It’s stifling!”

“They’re too fast! I can’t see them clearly!”

At this moment, everyone was alarmed by the battle in the sky.

“Wait, why does this power seem so familiar?”

Gongsun Wan frowned.

“This seems to be father’s power?”

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared next to Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan. His eyes were fixed on the sky as he spoke those words.

“Grandpa Batian!”

When Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan saw this, they both cried out in joy.

This person was Gongsun Batian, a peak fourth-level unity realm expert.

He was far more powerful than Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan, so he instantly recognized one of the combatants, which was his own father.

“Great-grandfather is fighting?”

“Then, who is Great-grandfather fighting?”

Hearing this, Gongsun Yao and Gongsun Wan’s eyes widened.

“I’m not sure,” Gongsun Batian said with a serious expression.

His father was a tenth-level unity realm expert, and was the Grand Elder of the Gongsun family. Since the fight did not show any signs of abating, his father’s opponent should be equally matched.

Gongsun Batian still had some guesses about the opponent’s identity, but he had no way to confirm it.

“Eh?”

Gongsun Batian, who was watching the battle, suddenly noticed that the communication token in his storage ring had been activated. Then, he quickly transmitted his spiritual sense into the communication token.

Moments later, Gongsun Batian received his father’s message.

“I’m fighting the Great Elder of the Nether God sect. Inform Ye Xuan quickly. I won’t be able to delay him for long.”

Gongsun Batian’s facial expression changed.

Sure enough, his father was fighting one of the two targets.

Gongsun Batian immediately headed to the nearest stronghold of the Gongsun family and used the communication token to send a message, telling them to inform Ye Xuan of the whereabouts of the Great Elder of the Nether God sect.

“Grandpa Batian, what was that about?”

Gongsun Yao asked.

“The one who is fighting my father up there is the Great Elder of the Nether God sect,” Gongsun Batian said with a serious expression.

“What?”

The one fighting with great-grandfather was the Great Elder of the Nether God sect?

Immediately, the two women looked at each other. There was a flash of joy in their eyes.

This was their family’s opportunity!

If they succeeded in holding the Great Elder back, they would be able to obtain Ye Xuan’s reward

“Gongsun family!”

At this moment, a deafening roar suddenly rang out in the sky.

The Great Elder’s eyes were filled with rage, but more than that, he was terrified.

He had been very careful ever since he left the Nether God sect, yet he had been discovered by the Grand Elder of the Gongsun family.

Had it been anyone else, he would have been able to kill them and quickly escape. However, he was evenly matched with the Gongsun family’s Grand Elder, so the fight dragged on.

He had tried to escape multiple times, but the Grand Elder stuck to him like glue.

In desperation, he could only choose to retreat as he fought, hoping to find a chance to shake him loose.

However, as time passed, the fear in his heart became more and more intense. Once Ye Xuan arrived, he would be doomed!

“Are you really going to go this far?”

“You’d better think carefully. If I’m lucky enough to escape this calamity, I will surely exact my revenge on the Gongsun family!”

“If you let me leave now, I can let bygones be bygones!”
