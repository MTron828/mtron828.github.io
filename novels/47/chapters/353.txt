354 Planar Embryo Fragment

After some time, Ye Xuan gained a general understanding of the mystic world.

The cultivation realms in the mystic world were divided into the mystic meridian realm, the divine mystic realm, the materialization realm, the void realm, the heaven realm, the mystic lord realm, the supreme realm, the ancient realm, and the sealed immortal realm.

Each realm had nine levels.

In the myriad worlds, the mystic world was considered a middle plane, while the higher plane was the legendary immortal world.

All of the cultivators of the mystic world pursued the legendary path of immortal ascension.

Martial techniques here had another name. The cultivators of the mystic world called them divine powers. They were also divided into heaven, earth, mystic, and yellow ranks.

As for cultivators’ constitutions, it was categorized according to whether the cultivator had divine bones in their body.

“Senior Tian Xuan, would you be able to help me examine the divine bones in my body?” Ye Xuan asked helplessly.

Now that the system was dormant, he had no way to check his attributes.

“That won’t be an issue, little friend,” Tian Xuan said with a smile.

In fact, there was more than one ascendance shrine in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. However, this one was a little special as it was built by the first sect master.

It was a pity that millions of years ago, this ascendance shrine was damaged for some reason, and the cultivators from the lower planes were no longer able to ascend here.

Since then, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had given up on this ascendance shrine and sealed it.

Although Tian Xuan was one of the seven chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was already old and close to the end of his lifespan. There was no hope of him ascending to the immortal world.

However, Tian Xuan had once obtained a secret scroll from the scripture depository of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, which recorded a prophecy left behind by the first sect master.

“Millions of years from now, the sealed shrine would open once again, and the child of destiny would descend from and rewrite the fate of the mystic world.”

As a result, Tian Xuan had always kept an eye on this ascendance shrine, and had done so for the past thousands of years.

Then, finally, Ye Xuan came!

However, he was not certain that Ye Xuan was the child of destiny.

Back then, in addition to that scroll, there was also something else. It was a palm-sized black transparent crystal.

If Ye Xuan could get the black crystal to light up, it would mean that he was the prophesied child of destiny.

“My young friend! I’ll examine your divine bones now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Tian Xuan, and a mysterious power suddenly swept out and descended on Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan’s body suddenly trembled, and dazzling light burst forth from his body. The meridian circulation route in his body suddenly appeared.

At that moment, Tian Xuan took out a stone pillar which was inlaid with many diamond-shaped crystals.

“This is a divine bone stone pillar. It can detect the divine bones in a cultivator’s body. Little friend, you only need to place your hand on the stone pillar,” Tian Xuan said with a smile.

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded, then took a step forward and gently placed his palm on the stone pillar.

However, what puzzled Tian Xuan was that the stone pillar did not change at all.

“How could this be? Could it be that the stone pillar is broken?”

Tian Xuan muttered to himself. Then, he took a step forward and placed his own palm on the stone pillar.

Moments later, the dull stone pillar suddenly blossomed with light. At the same time, words suddenly appeared on the stone pillar.

“Ancient fire divine bone! Sixth-level divine bone!”

(Note: Divine bones are divided into nine levels, with the highest being level nine and the lowest being level one.)

“Hmm, there’s no problem with mine. Why can’t it detect yours?” Tian Xuan’s eyes were filled with doubt.

Ye Xuan felt embarrassed.

This was impossible, right?

He had just obtained the chaos divine body on the Tianyuan continent.

Even if all of his power had wilted away during his ascension, it should have been impossible for him not to have a single divine bone, right?

Seeing this, Tian Xuan took a long look at Ye Xuan.

There were only two possibilities for the stone pillar to have no reaction to Ye Xuan’s touch. Ye Xuan either did not have a divine bone in his body at all, and was a cultivator with an ordinary level of talent, or the divine bone in Ye Xuan’s body was so extraordinary that even the stone pillar could not detect it.

The former was far more likely than the latter, though.

The testing stone pillar he had used was an intermediate-level one, and could detect first to sixth-level divine bones. Only advanced testing stone pillars could detect every divine bone.

Under normal circumstances, if a cultivator with a seventh-level divine bone were to test himself with an intermediate-level stone pillar, the power of the divine bone should have instantly shattered the stone pillar, as opposed to not eliciting a reaction at all.

Did this guy really not have a divine bone?

“Ahem, little friend, why don’t you try again?” Tian Xuan looked at Ye Xuan awkwardly. After a moment of hesitation, he took out the black crystal.

“Little friend, you only need to drip your blood on this. As long as this crystal reacts to your blood, you can join the Great Wilderness Divine sect.”

“En!” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

He had just ascended to the mystic world, so it would be best if he could join a large sect.

Moreover, the system was currently in a dormant state for an unknown period of time.

Ye Xuan took out a drop of blood essence and allowed it to drip onto the black crystal.

In the next second, the ordinary-looking black crystal suddenly trembled, and mysterious ripples appeared on its surface. It then turned into a black streak of light and entered Ye Xuan’s forehead.

‘As expected! He’s the child of destiny I’ve been looking for!’

When Tian Xuan saw this, he became extremely excited.

“My young friend Ye Xuan, would you be willing to acknowledge me as your master?” Tian Xuan asked.

From the conversation just now, he had already learned Ye Xuan’s name.

However, Ye Xuan was in a daze at that moment.

After the black streak of light entered his body, a line of text suddenly appeared in his mind.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has found a fragment of the mystic world’s planar embryo, which has replenished a large amount of the system’s energy!”

“Ding! Please wait patiently, the system will be activated again in a hundred years!”

‘What? That ugly black crystal was actually a fragment of this world’s planar embryo?’

Ye Xuan digested the information in his mind, and a hint of shock flashed across his eyes.

“My little friend Ye Xuan, how about it?”

Seeing that Ye Xuan did not respond, Tian Xuan called out again awkwardly.

“Ah!” Ye Xuan came back to his senses and looked at Tian Xuan. After thinking for a moment, he bowed respectfully to Tian Xuan.

“Teacher, please accept Ye Xuan’s bow!”

“Good, good, good! Now I have a successor!”

Seeing this, Tian Xuan touched his white beard happily. Finding a successor before he died, and for that successor to be the prophesied child of destiny, he had no more regrets in life.

Just like that, Ye Xuan followed Tian Xuan back to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.
