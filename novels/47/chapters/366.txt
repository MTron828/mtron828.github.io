367 Spiritual Power Infusion (Part 1)

In the courtyard of Cloud Sky peak, Zhuge Yueyue waited nervously for Ye Xuan to examine the results of her cultivation.

She did not know if the results of her cultivation would satisfy her teacher.

“I’ll first test your cultivation!”

Ye Xuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue, and then waved his sleeve. A beam of light descended from the sky and landed on her.

This light had the function of probing the target’s cultivation level. Of course, it could only probe cultivators weaker than the user. Furthermore, if the other party resisted, it would not work.

“Fourth level of the mystic meridian realm?” Seeing this, Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows.

In just four days, how did this girl break through to the fourth level of the mystic meridian realm?

It seemed the heavenly marrow pill had pretty much reconstructed the meridians in her body.

In addition, this girl had been an ordinary person before this, so she was naturally unable to completely absorb the medicinal strength of the heavenly marrow pill.

It was the same for the profound marrow pill that Ye Xuan had taken. It took him four days to barely absorb the medicinal power of the pill, yet he was already a fourth-level void realm cultivator.

Not only that, under the medicinal power of the profound marrow pill and tempered the spiritual power in his dantian, so even though he was a fourth-level void realm cultivator, he would be able to go toe-to-toe with ninth-level void realm cultivators.

Furthermore, his body now had a trace of immortal spiritual power, which made it difficult for others to accurately sense his cultivation level.

This was why Gao Shun and Gongsun Shouyue had been uncertain as to what heights Ye Xuan’s cultivation level had reached.

“Teacher, it’s my fault for having such mediocre talent and not being able to fulfill Teacher’s expectations.”

Seeing Ye Xuan’s unchanged expression, Zhuge Yueyue suddenly felt a little disappointed and frustrated at her lacking capabilities.

However, moments later, Ye Xuan looked at her quizzically.

“You only spent four days reaching the fourth level of the mystic meridian realm. This is already quite shocking. How much stronger were you expecting to get?”

“It’s fine for you to say this in front of me, but if you speak like that in front of others, you’d be inviting a beating.”

He seriously suspected that this girl was somewhat delusional. That young man who had been selected first in the meeting hall back then had not even reached the first level of the mystic meridian realm.

“Ah.”

Seeing a different reaction from Ye Xuan, Zhuge Yueyue was stunned. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It seemed that her teacher was quite satisfied with her performance.

“Although your cultivation speed is not bad, it won’t be enough to reach the divine mystic realm in three months.”

Ye Xuan looked at Zhuge Yueyue and frowned.

Suddenly, Ye Xuan remembered that he could perform spiritual power infusion. It seemed that not having the system for a hundred years had dulled his mind.

He had even forgotten about these basic functions!

“My precious disciple, you’re now carrying the dignity of Cloud Sky peak on your shoulders. You must emerge victorious in the Seven Peaks competition to protect the dignity of Cloud Sky peak.”

“Although you’re quite talented in cultivation, three months is too short a time for you to reach the required level to do this. Since that’s the case, I will perform spiritual power infusion for you.”

“Ah!”

Upon hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was shocked.

“Teacher, did you just say that you were going to perform spiritual power infusion for me?”

‘I didn’t hear wrong, did I? Is Teacher really going to perform spiritual power infusion for me?’

It was common knowledge that cultivators valued their cultivation more than their own lives.

Even blood relatives might not be willing to perform spiritual power infusion for their loved ones.

Zhuge Yueyue had never expected that her teacher would actually be willing to do this for her.

Did that not mean that she was really important to him?
