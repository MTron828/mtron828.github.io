812 Making Preparations

With their teacher’s guidance, these two had the best chance of competing against the geniuses of the other continents.

Ye Xuan remained unfazed and walked over to Daoist Yi Feng and Mengyu’s corpses, squatting down. Ao Lei soon joined him.

After a long time, Ao Lei said, “Martial Uncle Yi has really suffered a lot in this lifetime…”

Perhaps the person who understood Daoist Yi Feng the most was Ao Lei.

Over the past hundred years, Daoist Yi Feng had probably only survived until today to resolve the grudge between the sect and Mengyu. Now that it was complete, he no longer had the desire to continue living.

Ye Xuan sighed and said, “Sigh… Perhaps this was the best ending for Martial Uncle Yi in this situation.”

Ye Xuan did not know what to say. After all, this was Daoist Master Yi Feng’s own decision, and Ye Xuan could not interfere.

Looking at the barrier in the sky that was still crumbling, Ye Xuan could even see the experts from the other continents through it.

“Senior Brother Ao, this world will soon welcome a great change. You must be fully prepared.”

Hearing this, Ao Lei nodded. The Great Wilderness Divine sect was now the undisputed number one sect in the East continent, and would now have to maintain that status in light of the current situation.

Incidentally, the sect had fought and emerged victorious amidst the disaster, so they could take advantage of this opportunity to recruit a large number of disciples and make sufficient preparations to compete with the sects and geniuses of the other continents.

Looking at the two corpses, Ye Xuan casually waved his hand and released a ray of light that enveloped them. Then, he placed both corpses into a copper coffin.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan injected his spiritual power into the copper coffin, sending it directly into the endless void.

No one knew where Ye Xuan had sent this coffin, and no one dared to ask.

After doing this, Ye Xuan sighed.

Daoist Yi Feng had already told Ye Xuan what to do in the event that he died. discussed this matter with him. Ye Xuan had initially brushed it off as being unnecessary, but it had ended up becoming a reality.

“Junior Brother Ye, let’s…”

Ao Lei said hesitantly. Even though Mengyu’s matter had been settled, there was more than just Mengyu to deal with. Three of the seven strange monsters had escaped, and there was still the mysterious master of the strange world.

Also, the strange power was still spreading throughout the East continent. With the world barrier shattering, it was now starting to spread to the other continents. The situation was getting out of hand.

This forced the experts from the other continents to scramble to come up with countermeasures to deal with it.

Ye Xuan calmly swept his gaze across the sky, but in his heart, he was thinking about what to do. The three strange monsters that escaped did not worry him at all, but the mysterious master of the strange realm did.

He still knew nothing about this person, or how strong this person was. Of course, as a sealed immortal realm expert, Ye Xuan was not worried about having to fight this person.

The other thing he had to consider was how complicated the current situation was with the eight continents reuniting. Ye Xuan really did not know how this situation would unfold or develop.

Based on the current situation, Sky Mountain was undoubtedly the safest place in the East continent, as it was the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s current base of operations. With Ye Xuan as their flag bearer, very few people would dare to cause trouble for them.

At this moment, things in the East continent were gradually calming down, which was in part due to the fact that the other continents were now sharing the burden of dealing with the strange power.

There were no signs of the three strange monsters who had escaped either. Perhaps they had chosen to flee to other continents to avoid Ye Xuan. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After seeing this situation, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said, “In this case, the East continent can properly reorganize and make sufficient preparations.”

“After all, now that the battle is over, what we need most is time to recover.”

“With the other seven continents open now, the strange realm will likely shift their focus, alleviating our burden. This will give us a much needed respite.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Ao Lei nodded. The shattering of the world barrier had come at an opportune moment. He even suspected that Ye Xuan had somehow deliberately caused this to happen. However, if anyone were to ask, Ye Xuan would definitely not admit it, even if you put a knife to his neck.

“Alright, Senior Brother Ao, I’ll leave the matters here to you.”

Ye Xuan then flew over to Zhuge Yueyue and the others. He hugged the unconscious Xiang Yun, then looked at Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun and said, “Let’s return to Cloud Sky peak.”

Thus Ye Xuan and the others returned to the Cloud Sky Peak.

After seeing Ye Xuan leave in a hurry, everyone felt very puzzled. Could it be that something big was about to happen?

At this moment, Ao Lei shouted, “Everyone, the crisis on Sky Mountain has been resolved for the time being.”

“Also, from tomorrow onward, the Great Wilderness Divine sect will continue to recruit disciples, and the quota will increase by 100,000!”

“We welcome everyone to participate in the assessment!”

After hearing this news, Sky Mountain was thrown into an uproar. Everyone was very excited.
