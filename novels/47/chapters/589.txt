590 Mo Nan (Part 2)

Hearing that someone from his sect had actually killed Ao Lei’s junior brother, Mo Nan’s face paled.

Which of his junior brothers did that person kill?

Mo Nan felt like dragging that person out and giving him a good scolding. Who was so bold as to incite trouble for the Immortal Divine sect like this?

In the past, someone from the Immortal Divine sect had severely injured one of Ao Lei’s disciples. As a result, Ao Lei had come to the Immortal Divine sect for revenge.

!!

Chief Tian Xuan had also been present to watch over Ao Lei.

Fortunately, that matter had been resolved in the end. He had personally apologized to Ao Lei and had even healed his disciple’s injuries.

However, someone from the sect had killed one of Ao Lei’s junior brothers. This time, it would probably not be so easy to deal with. Mo Nan was furious.

Ao Lei did not stop despite being pushed back. He swung his sword again at one of the Immortal Divine sect’s peaks.

Mo Nan dodged the attack, and quickly tried to mediate the matter.

“Ao Lei, can you stop for a moment and let me figure out what’s going on?”

“I’ll definitely investigate this matter properly and will hold that person accountable!”

The current situation was very dangerous for the Immortal Divine sect.

He was being held back by Ao Lei, and Yi Feng was watching him closely, so he had no way of saving the sect’s disciples.

Mo Nan’s fury was ignited as well. He was trying to be accommodating, but it did not seem that Ao Lei had any intention of stopping.

“Damn it! Ao Lei, do you think I’m afraid of you?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As soon as he finished speaking, a full-force attack of a middle-stage supreme realm expert was unleashed, forcing Ao Lei to retreat several steps.

“Ao Lei, had it not been for Tian Xuan, would you still be alive today?”

Mo Nan then said viciously, “A tree that’s more than ten meters tall must have grown from his grave, right?”

“I’ll say this one last time. Get out of here right now and I can let this matter go. Otherwise, be prepared to bear the consequences!”

Mo Nan’s heart ached as he witnessed his sect’s cultivators being killed one after another in front of him.

How long had it taken to establish and grow the sect?

The foundations of the sect were being torn down before his very eyes right now.

Many of the sect’s cultivators had already been killed, and there did not seem to be any experts around to protect them.

Mo Nan was the only one, and he was being held back by Ao Lei. If this continued, the Immortal Divine sect would be destroyed sooner or later.

Looking at the situation, Mo Nan had no choice but to compromise.

Even if they already had a great number of casualties, if he could get Ao Lei to leave now, it was still better than being completely destroyed.

At this moment, Ao Lei went over to Yi Feng’s side.

His expression was unusually grave. After those few moves he had exchanged with Mo Nan, he had a grasp of how powerful Mo Nan was.

Just as he was about to continue the war of words with Mo Nan, a voice was heard.

“Senior Brother Ao Lei, I’m here!”

Ao Lei turned around and, to his surprise, saw Gao Shun flying over as fast as he could.

At the sight of this, all of the cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect who were still fighting were dumbfounded.

“Uh…”

“Is that a ghost?”

Ao Lei was also extremely shocked. He stared at Gao Shun with disbelief and asked, “Junior Brother Gao, you’re still alive?”

Was this real? After all, he had witnessed Gao Shun’s life force fade with his own eyes. Should he not be dead?

Why was he here? Furthermore, why did he look perfectly fine?

Not only did he come back to life, but his cultivation had also increased and he looked as if he had become ten years younger!

What was going on?

Once he reached Ao Lei’s side, Gao Shun hurriedly told them what had happened to him earlier.

“Senior Brother Ao, Junior Brother Ye Xuan gave me an immortal-grade recovery pill. That’s how I managed to be revived, and even obtained many benefits in the process.”

“This…”

“Chief Ye Xuan saved Chief Gao Shun?”

Everyone from the Great Wilderness Divine sect was stunned.

“Heavens!”

“Chief Ye Xuan was actually so rich? He actually gave away an immortal-grade recovery pill?”

“Also, weren’t those two at odds with each other?”

At this moment, Ao Lei was also very puzzled.

Why would Ye Xuan be so generous to actually take out an immortal-grade recovery pill to save Gao Shun?

He was also aware of the bad blood between them and the two peaks that had been ongoing for countless years now.

Of all the people, Ye Xuan should have been the last person to have been willing to pay such a price to save Gao Shun..

That being said, how amazing was that pill? It even managed to bring Gao Shun back to life!

After Gao Shun appeared, the fighting came to a sudden halt, as everyone was looking at him in a daze.

Mo Nan’s face darkened when he finally figured out what had happened.

...

“You guys are a piece of work! In the end, you were just looking for a random reason to attack my sect, right?”

Mo Nan, who had originally thought that he was in the wrong, became furious because Gao Shun, who was supposed to be dead, was still hale and hearty. Things had suddenly become different.

“Ao Lei, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson today and show you that the Immortal Divine sect should never be provoked!”

With those words, Mo Nan instantly rose into the air, and thick dark clouds condensed in the sky.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A bolt of purple lightning flashed past, and the Qilin, whose left hoof had been chopped off, instantly recovered and appeared below Mo Nan.

Mo Nan then landed on the Qilin’s back, erupting with a terrifying amount of spiritual power that made the surroundings tremble.

“Sh*t…”

Ao Lei’s face paled. It seemed that Mo Nan was determined to fight them to the death today.

He turned around without any hesitation and shouted, “Everyone, heed my order! Leave this place!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ao Lei took out a jade stone that was emitting seven-colored light and activated it.

...

“Great Desolation technique!”

Seeing this familiar light, the cultivators from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were very shocked. After all, it had been a long time since Ao Lei had used this stone.
