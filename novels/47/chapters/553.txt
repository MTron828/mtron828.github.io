554 Parting

If she accepted this dress, would she have to give herself to Ye Xuan?

At the thought of this, Yanran’s entire body started to shiver, but she still wanted to put it on and try it out.

As for how to reward Ye Xuan, she would think about it later.

After receiving the colorful dress from Ye Xuan, her body also released the same seven-colored light, and she looked as beautiful as an angel who had descended to the world.

!!

She gave it a casual twirl, which rocked Ye Xuan’s world. His eyes were fixed on her, unwilling to move away for a moment.

At this moment, Yanran was so beautiful and mesmerizing.

‘Amazing! This is really amazing!’

Even though Ye Xuan had seen many beautiful women, he had to say that Yanran was the only one who could make him lose himself like this.

No, wait, perhaps that was not right. After all, Yuelun was also like that, but both of them gave Ye Xuan a different feeling.

At this moment, even Yanran herself was extremely shocked.

After all, after putting on this dress, she had already noticed that her combat strength had doubled.

Even if she was besieged by so many cultivators like Ye Xuan just now, she was confident that she could easily win.

How could this still be considered a dress? Its defensive properties made her like a moving fortress!

Most importantly, after wearing this dress, she could already sense where Ye Xuan was, and could even communicate with him while using it as a medium.

Immediately after, Yanran pondered over the effects of this dress and her face turned red.

‘Why does this dress have such a strange function?’ she asked herself gloomily.

She looked at Ye Xuan quizzically and thought to herself, ‘Um… I’ll think about that another day.’

Thinking this, Yanran shook her head to clear it. Then she looked at Ye Xuan and asked, “Is it beautiful?”

Ye Xuan was deeply entranced by Yanran at this time and only replied after a long while.

“Beautiful, of course, my Little Ran is beautiful. You put flowers to shame. You’re devastatingly beautiful!”

Hearing this, Yanran’s face turned red, and her heart blossomed with joy. After a while, she calmed down and replied, “That’s good. If you think so, then that’s good.”

Yanran did not care if other people thought she was pretty or not. As long as she was pretty in Ye Xuan’s eyes, that was enough. After all, this dress was worn for her.

Ye Xuan stared at Yanran for a long time before finally looking away and checking his surroundings.

Uh… Why was there not a single onlooker here?

It was really a pity.

He had wanted to show off their couple set…

‘Forget it.’

At this moment, Ye Xuan had already obtained the immortal heavenly treasure, so he was not bothered by the other treasures in the ancient tomb. That being said, it would be good to bring back a few for his disciples.

Ye Xuan’s trip to the ancient tomb could be said to be fruitful, and his wealth and resources multiplied once again.

This was probably the richest Cloud Sky peak had ever been, so Ye Xuan was very happy.

In his storage space, there were already countless treasures piled up inside.

Not only did he have the water cloud fruit sapling, but he also had supreme treasures like the chaos immortal peach and the Boundless Cauldron.

He had obtained all these items in this ancient tomb.

After returning to Cloud Sky peak this time, he would probably have to enter secluded cultivation for a while. His combat strength would definitely increase drastically after that.

When he broke through to the ancient realm, he would be able to do whatever he wanted in the East continent.

However, as the other continents were still under the influence of the worldly power, Ye Xuan would be unable to cross over for the time being.

Perhaps when he became a sealed immortal realm expert, he would be able to travel to the other continents with the help of other divine-rank treasures.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan frowned.

How long would he have to wait before he could see Yanran again?

If he was lucky enough, a secret realm like this ancient tomb would appear again, and he might be able to meet Yanran again. Otherwise, he would have to wait until he reached the sealed immortal realm.

Yanran’s thoughts were actually the same as Ye Xuan’s. She could not bear to part just like that. After all, the next time they met might be a long time from now.

Boom!

While the two of them were feeling reluctant to part, the space around them began to shake violently, and the mountains and rivers crumbled.

“Oh no, this ancient tomb is already collapsing!” Ye Xuan said in a hurry after noticing this.

It was time to part. After the ancient tomb realm collapsed, they would all be transported back to their respective continents.

At this moment, Yanran’s eyes were full of emotion as she looked at Ye Xuan reluctantly.

“How long do we have to wait before we meet again after this?”

Ye Xuan calmed himself down and patted Yanran’s head with a tender gaze.

“Don’t worry, I believe it won’t be long before we meet again.”

After hearing this, Yanran smiled. She trusted Ye Xuan one hundred percent. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Xuan, no matter how long it takes, I’ll be waiting for your arrival in the Heaven continent.”

Even though they had only known each other for a short time, Ye Xuan had already occupied an extremely important position in her heart. Although it might be a long time before they met again, this was something she had already taken into account when they first met.

At this moment, they were tightly hugging each other.

Then, bathed in a dazzling light, they were separated and sent back to their respective continents…
