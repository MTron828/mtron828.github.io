588 Played For A Fool

Feng Lu had thought that he would be able to win this time. He believed that, as long as he caught Ye Xuan, he could blackmail the latter’s family to make up for the money he had just lost during the auction.

However, Ye Xuan’s identity made this impossible. Even if Ye Xuan was someone who could be captured, was he going to blackmail the Great Wilderness Divine sect?

Hell no!

Ye Xuan frowned and said in an unpleasant tone, “Oh? Is that so? That’s not what you said just now.”

!!

“Chief Ye Xuan… I’m really sorry. I didn’t know any better and offended you.”

“Please state your request. No matter what it is, I’ll do my best to make up for the offense.”

“I hope you will be merciful and let me go. I truly am sorry.”

As he spoke, Feng Lu was already in tears. He had really poked the bear this time.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan knew that his opportunity to earn big had arrived.

This hapless prince was truly a god of wealth.

After a moment of silence, Ye Xuan said, “If I’m not mistaken, you won the bids for a large number of auction items just now, right?”

The meaning of his words were clear, and Feng Lu immediately took out the auction items he had won.

“Chief Ye Xuan, these are the auction items. Consider it a small token from me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Feng Lu handed Ye Xuan the storage bag that contained the items with both hands outstretched.

His heart ached terribly. These items were bought with his hard-earned cash, yet they were handed over to someone else before he could use them.

However, he had only himself to blame for this predicament. Himself and his goddamn pride.

Why was an expert like Ye Xuan out here in the secular world? Should he not be cultivating in seclusion on Cloud Sky peak?

Feng Lu had many grievances, but could not voice them.

It was no wonder Han Sikong had been so protective of this person at the beginning. It was not without reason.

A supreme realm expert could deal with both him and the empire with a wave of his hand.

Ye Xuan was still smiling calmly. He took the storage bag from Feng Lu and looked at it. He realized that most of the items he had put up for auction had been bought by this wealthy prince.

“Fine. Since you are Xiyun’s uncle and you have realized the error of your ways, I’ll let you off today.”

Upon hearing this, the tension within Feng Lu’s heart finally relaxed. His clothes were already soaked in cold sweat.

He was already a man past his prime, but this was the first time he had shamelessly begged for forgiveness like today.

When he saw Feng Xiyun standing beside Ye Xuan, his heart immediately became even more bitter. If he had noticed Feng Xiyun from the start, this matter would never have gotten this far.

At the thought of this, Feng Lu burst into tears. He had truly lost big time today.

Why did he have to assume that she was a servant?

The fact that Feng Xiyun was Ye Xuan’s disciple was common knowledge within the royal family, as it was a big deal.

He had only himself to blame for his pride and carelessness.

Ye Xuan patted Feng Lu’s shoulder and said with a smile, “There’s something you should know.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Chief Ye Xuan, I’m all ears.”

“Actually, most of the auction items you won belong to me. In a sense, I have to thank you for giving me all this money to spend.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan could not help but laugh out loud. Then, he left with his two disciples, leaving the hapless Prince Zhanglu behind.

Upon hearing this, Feng Lu felt the world spin around him. He coughed a few times before falling to the ground.

“Prince Zhanglu!”

His guards anxiously hurried over to help him up.

At that moment, Feng Lu felt as if his heart had been hammered with a giant nail. He was so angry that he almost fainted.

The money that he had worked so hard to save up had been given away just like that!

Ye Xuan had been playing him for a fool the whole time!

He was just deliberately raising the price, which was why he kept provoking him.

Furthermore, he had danced to Ye Xuan’s tune like an idiot, and had even been happy when he won those bids.

He was really stupid…

He had really been taken for a ride thanks to his pride.

When Feng Lu recovered, he felt that the whole world was gray.

Fortunately, these treasures had at least saved his life. Otherwise, he would have died right here and now.

Ye Xuan deliberately stopped and said when he passed Feng Tianyi, “Tianyi, you’re quite capable. I reckon that it won’t take long for the Yangli divine empire to ascend under your leadership…”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Feng Tianyi was also very excited. He said, “”Thank you, Chief Ye Xuan. You think too highly of me.”

Ye Xuan nodded, and then looked at Han Sikong and said, “This time, the matter was resolved thanks to you. If it wasn’t for your help, I would have had to act.”
