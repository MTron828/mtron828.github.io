It was one thing for him to be able to travel through his formation at will, but this brat was actually faster than him?

Mo Nan was dumbfounded, and asked sternly, “How did you do it?”

Ye Xuan’s eyes were filled with a mocking smile as he replied calmly, “Do you think it’s difficult?”

“What do you mean by that?”

Then, as the crowd watched in amazement, he rushed into the formation again.

“Hehe, here I come again!”

As soon as Ye Xuan finished speaking, Mo Nan threw a punch at Ye Xuan to try and catch him off guard.

However, Ye Xuan’s figure disappeared without a trace again. When he reappeared, he was outside the formation.

“Hehe, I left again. If you have the ability, then come hit me. Bring it on!”

Ye Xuan teased him with a cheeky smile, making Mo Nan’s expression even darker.

‘F*ck, are you kidding me?’

However, this was not the end. Ye Xuan’s figure flickered again, and in an instant, he once again entered Mo Nan’s formation.

Before Mo Nan could make a move, he appeared outside the formation once more.

“Come on! What can you do to me? Weren’t you invincible inside your formation?”

Ye Xuan mocked him again and again. He felt that this was really quite fun.

Every time Ye Xuan entered, Mo Nan would try to attack, but then immediately realize that Ye Xuan was no longer there.

No matter how hard he tried, he could not even touch Ye Xuan. He could only watch as Ye Xuan kept toying with him.

“Damn it!”

Mo Nan gritted his teeth in rage. He had lived for hundreds of years, but this was the first time he had been humiliated like this.

Even though his heart was burning with anger, Mo Nan had no idea what to do. He did not know how to restrain Ye Xuan.

After some thought, Mo Nan laughed.

“Hehe, it’s really too funny.”

“Hmph! Are you laughing at yourself?” Ye Xuan asked, very dissatisfied.

Why did this old man suddenly laugh out loud? It felt creepy.

“I’m just laughing because all of you people from Cloud Sky peak are all cowards. All you know how to do is run. You don’t even dare to confront me head-on.”

“Thinking back, your teacher was also like this. It seems that you also inherited your teacher’s legacy. What a joke,” Mo Nan said sarcastically.

He wanted to use this method to anger Ye Xuan and force him into the formation to fight him.

However, what made him feel very helpless was that Ye Xuan’s expression did not change at all after hearing this.

After Ye Xuan hovered in the air for a moment, seemingly thinking, he suddenly lit up and said, “You’re a fat liar!”

“If I remember correctly, you were stomped underneath my teacher’s feet. How did you end up twisting the story like that?”

“He didn’t even bother killing you.”

“This…”

Mo Nan was infuriated, and he wished he could beat Ye Xuan up right here and now.

That was something that happened so long ago, yet someone was still spreading it around?

What he had just said was a lie he had deliberately fabricated to anger Ye Xuan. However, he had not expected Ye Xuan to know about that incident back then.

“Damn it!”

After Mo Nan cursed, he waved his right hand in the air and a sword appeared in his hand.

Moments later, a bolt of purple lightning struck the sword, and he swung the sword, releasing a sword beam that crackled with lightning toward the crowd of Great Wilderness Divine sect cultivators.

“Dodge quickly!”

After seeing this attack, everyone’s expressions changed as they scampered away, trying to escape. However, the gulf between their cultivation levels and Mo Nan’s was light years away.

It was not something they could withstand.

At this critical moment, Ye Xuan made his move. He pushed his hands forward and instantly unleashed an attack.

Boom!

His attack offset the powerful lightning sword beam.

Immediately after, Ye Xuan entered Mo Nan’s formation again, but he was not here to play around this time.

Ye Xuan said sarcastically as he hovered firmly inside the formation, “Old man, you’re about to die, so I’ll play with you one final time.”

“Hurry up and use all of your strength. If you can really defeat me, the Immortal Divine sect might be able to escape this calamity.”

Hearing this, Mo Nan’s eyes lit up.

“Will you keep your word?”

What he was most afraid of was the sect’s legacy being lost. Otherwise, he would have already shed all pretenses of cordiality.

To continue the sect’s legacy, he would even give up his own life.

As such, he was more than willing to accept Ye Xuan’s offer.

Ye Xuan smiled calmly and replied, “I always keep my word! However, whether or not the Immortal Divine sect survives is now in your hands.”

“As long as you can defeat me, you’ll be able to protect the Immortal Divine sect. But if you fail, all will be lost!”

...

“Haha, I’ll take you up on that!”

With those words, Mo Nan promptly attacked.

He did not know why Ye Xuan believed himself to be invincible, but this was his chance.

This kid was indeed powerful, but it had not reached the level where he would admit defeat lying down just like that.

He had been worried about Ye Xuan when the Godsword had appeared, but Ye Xuan was just an early-stage supreme realm cultivator, while he was a middle-stage supreme realm cultivator.

In order to protect the legacy of the Immortal Divine sect, he would go all out!

A massive palm imprint containing the full power of a middle-stage supreme realm expert struck out.

At this moment, Mo Nan no longer concealed his strength. His best bet was to strike and defeat Ye Xuan before the latter started revealing his trump cards.

After the first exchange, the two of them took a few steps back to catch their breath before clashing again.

Within the lightning formation, Mo Nan was indeed very powerful…
