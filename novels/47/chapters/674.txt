675 Time To Get Up

“B*stard, how can you say such things? Since you’ve stepped onto the path of cultivation, you shouldn’t be afraid of failure. Without experiencing hardships, how can you improve?”

“What you need to do is to learn from this failure and then continue to improve yourself. Fine! Let’s go back to the Ice Temple! You’ll continue cultivating there.”

“Always maintain a serious and devoted attitude toward cultivation. The path of cultivation will never end. Losing is just a bump on the road you have to get over. However, if you don’t learn from your failures and defeats, you will never reach the peak. Every expert has suffered defeat at some point.”

“Be strong and resilient. This experience will be useful to you in the future.”

!!

Hearing this, Yun Hai instantly felt energized and was roused from his despondent state.

“Master’s words are right…”

However, at this moment, his heart was filled with hatred for Li Hong.

If it was not for this guy, how could Xiang Yun have gone berserk?

If Daoist Gu Hao was not here, he would have rushed over to beat Li Hong up.

Inside the ancient realm, Xiang Yun had locked onto the remaining people, and wanted nothing more than to get rid of all of these pesky people.

However, at this moment, Feng Xiyun opened her eyes and looked around. Stunned, she realized that there were so few people left.

‘Ahem…This time, I seem to have gone a little overboard…’

It seemed that her act had gotten her third sister riled up, resulting in the current situation.

If she did not wake up soon, the remaining people would probably be eliminated. At this moment, Xiang Yun also noticed that her second sister had woken up, and dropped her hammer and pounced towards Feng Xiyun.

“Oh, Second Sister, fortunately you didn’t fall asleep forever.”

As she spoke, Xiang Yun immediately threw herself into Feng Xiyun’s arms. She buried her little head into Feng Xiyun’s chest, and no longer looked as fierce as before.

At this moment, without Xiang Yun to guide it, the lightning cage faded away, allowing the remaining participants to leave safely.

After hearing these words, Feng Xiyun felt very embarrassed. She did not know if she should continue pretending to be injured.

After thinking for a moment, Feng Xiyun gave up on this idea. After all, the ground was quite cold and it was not comfortable to lie down.

Moments later, Feng Xiyun dusted the dirt off her clothes and stood up. She even stretched her body lazily.

“Mmmm… That feels better.”

Seeing Feng Xiyun’s calm and unfazed expression, everyone was instantly dumbfounded.

“Huh, Feng Xiyun wasn’t seriously injured at all?”

“What is going on here?”

“Was I beaten up for no good reason?”

At this moment, these people were already cursing inwardly.

Initially, they all thought that Xiang Yun had gone berserk due to how injured Feng Xiyun was. However, the truth was that Feng Xiyun was completely fine. She even lay on the ground and rested while they were getting beaten up!

This was clearly done on purpose!

“F*ck the human heart is so wicked!”

After stretching her body, Feng Xiyun yawned and found a comfortable mountain rock to sit on.

Xiang Yun was still in her arms, looking at her second sister with a puzzled expression.

“Second Sister, are you not injured?”

As she spoke, Xiang Yun stretched out her small hand in disbelief and kept touching Feng Xiyun’s body, wanting to see where she was injured.

However, after a while, she failed to find any injuries.

Feng Xiyun smiled and said, “Third Sister, I don’t think I said I was injured…”

“But I saw you fall to the ground just now.”

Feng Xiyun burst out laughing.

“I didn’t fall. I was just a little tired so I decided to rest. Seeing how powerful you were, I decided to relax and enjoy your fight.”

“So that’s the case…”

Anyway, it was fine as long as her second sister was not injured.

After hearing this, the surroundings fell silent.

“I’m furious! Don’t hold me back. I must fight her to the death!”

On the other side, Yun Hai, who had finally managed to calm himself down, was once again enraged.

It was all for naught!

Feng Xiyun was simply pretending to be injured. If they had simply eliminated all the people from the Supreme Divine sect, it would have been acceptable. However, the rest of them had done nothing at all. They were collateral damage simply because they were present!

At this moment, it was not just Yun Hai who was feeling emotional. Li Hong was the same. He had been consoling himself that he had at least defeated Feng Xiyun, but even that had been taken away from him.

Daoist Black Iron’s expression was also dark. His conversation with Gao Shun about Feng Xiyun replayed itself in his mind.

F*ck! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He had made a fool of himself again.

“Pfft, Xiyun is really special. Even I was fooled by her.”

Gao Shun laughed heartily as he spoke. It seemed that she had learned more than just cultivation techniques from Ye Xuan.
