Chapter 192: Yan‘er’s Teacher?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Mother…”

Lin Qingping did not know if it was an illusion, but she suddenly heard her daughter’s voice. This was a familiar voice that was carved into the depths of her soul.

Immediately, Lin Qingping’s vision suddenly brightened up. A thin and small figure suddenly appeared in her blurry vision that was filled with tears.

Was this not her precious daughter that she had missed day and night?

Immediately, Lin Qingping’s figure disappeared. Due to her excitement, she immediately used her purple spirit power.

However, because of this, the life force in Lin Qingping’s body was drained even further.

However, compared to the safety of her precious daughter, this was nothing.

Soon, Lin Qingping appeared in front of Zhao Yuyan and hugged her tightly.

“Silly girl! I thought I wouldn’t ever see you again!” Lin Qingping cried.

“Mother, it’s all my fault for making you worry…”

Zhao Yuyan also sensed Lin Qingping’s anxiousness and her heart was filled with self-blame.

She knew that her disappearance these few days must have made her mother very worried.

It was all her fault. If she had not snuck into the mystic realm, her mother would not have been so worried.

However, if she had not gone to the mystic realm, how would she have met Ye Xuan?

She had thought that she was a jinx, which was why she kept bringing bad luck to the people around her.

Moreover, she had thought that as long as she could find those high-grade medicinal herbs, she would be able to cure her mother’s illness.

Thanks to Ye Xuan, she finally understood that the reason her mother’s body had become like this was because of the Demon Devourer Body.

Lin Qingping hugged Zhao Yuyan tightly and did not say much. They remained like that for a long time until Lin Qingping finally let go, and quietly wiped the tears off her face.

Lin Qingping’s hands slowly lifted Zhao Yuyan’s cheeks. Her gaze was gentle as she touched Zhao Yuyan’s little face and tidied up her messy hair.

“My dear daughter, it has only been a few days since we last saw each other. How did you become so skinny?”

“Did you not eat well and sleep well these few days? It’s all mother’s fault. Were it not for Mother’s lack of ability, my dear daughter would not have suffered so much!”

Not only did Lin Qingping not blame Zhao Yuyan, she was full of blame for herself.

“But… It’s good that you’re back…”

“You haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ll cook for you now!”

Lin Qingping smiled and held Zhao Yuyan’s hand as they walked toward the bamboo house.

However, moments later, Lin Qingping’s vision suddenly turned dark. She sensed the world spinning around her as she fell to the ground.

“Mother!”

Seeing this, Zhao Yuyan immediately cried out anxiously, and then quickly helped Lin Qingping up.

“It’s okay! I’m just feeling dizzy. It’s no big deal. Just wait, I’ll cook for you right away!”

Lin Qingping shook slightly, and then said to Zhao Yuyan with a smile.

However, her pale face said otherwise.

After Zhao Yuyan went missing, Lin Qingping did not have the time to cultivate as she had spent her time searching for her precious daughter. Furthermore, she had used her purple spirit power, draining her life force and worsening her injuries.

“Mother, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault!”

Zhao Yuyan burst into tears. Her tears fell like raindrops.

At this moment, her heart was filled with fear. She was afraid that her mother would be like her father and leave her side forever.

“Wait, Teacher gave me pills!”

Suddenly, Zhao Yuyan remembered the pills that Ye Xuan gave her.

Immediately, Zhao Yuyan opened her palm and a pill filled with life force appeared.

“Yan’er, this is…”

Lin Qingping was shocked when she saw this.

Just now, she had felt the fluctuations of spatial energy from her precious daughter. In the next second, a pill appeared in her precious daughter’s hand.

Could it be that her precious daughter had a spatial storage item?

Most importantly, the life force contained in this pill shocked her.

“Mother, quickly take this pill. Teacher said that as long as you take this pill, your injuries will be healed!”

Zhao Yuyan quickly wiped the tears from her face and said anxiously.

“Teacher?”

When Lin Qingping heard this, her gaze became even more confused.

“Mother, don’t worry about this. Quickly take this pill. It will definitely be able to cure your illness!”

Seeing Lin Qingping’s face gradually turn pale, Zhao Yuyan could not help but urge her anxiously.

“Wait, Yan’er, have you acknowledged a teacher?”

Lin Qingping looked at her precious daughter, her eyes filled with doubt.

It had only been seven days, what had her precious daughter experienced?

“Mother, take the pill first. I will explain it all to you later!”

Looking at her precious daughter’s pleading expression, Lin Qingping hesitated for a moment before picking up the pill and swallowing it.

The emerald green pill contained turbulent life force. Just from its appearance, she could tell that it was very rare.

Boom!

The pill entered her stomach and immediately transformed into pure life force that slowly throughout her body.

At the same time, Lin Qingping’s almost exhausted life force instantly gained a new life and expanded at an extremely fast speed.

“How… How is this possible?”

Sensing what was going on inside her body, Lin Qingping’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Who was the teacher that her precious daughter was talking about? How could he have such a heaven-defying pill? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

This pill was not only a top-tier third-grade pill, but it was also personally refined by Ye Xuan. It was a three-line pill, which meant that its quality had reached the zenith of what was possible with that pill.

Even the White Moon Tower would not be able to afford such a pill!

Back then, Ye Xuan had refined many pills in the cultivation room, and this pill was one of them.

Extremely pure life force slowly spread out, restoring the exhausted life source in Lin Qingping’s body.

Soon, Lin Qingping’s pale face immediately became rosy.

In just a moment, the depleted life source had been perfectly restored.

Most importantly, there was still a lot of medicinal strength left in the pill!
