915 Schemes In The Dark

Ye Xuan was currently floating in the sky, holding the Godsword aloft as he looked down upon the world below.

“Old monster, watch carefully. This move is called the World Slaughter!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan instantly swung the giant sword down at Shan Ling. It was as if the entire world had been cut apart by his sword, and a huge rumble was heard.

“Argh…”

Shan Ling could only widen his eyes and watch as this blood-red sword beam descended on his body. He felt searing pain rip through his body, and he briefly lost consciousness.

When he came back to his senses, every single nerve in his body seemed to be on fire. He lowered his head and took a look. It was then that he realized that his huge body had been split into two.

As the top half of his body began to slide off, blood began to gush out. Shan Ling tried his best to move his body, but could not do anything to stop the inevitable.

Thus, he looked at Ye Xuan in a daze and asked, “Your sword technique… What is it called?”

At this moment, Shan Ling was relying on his willpower alone to stay conscious, waiting for Ye Xuan’s reply.

The corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly as he said indifferently, “Stellar Sword technique… How did it feel? It’s awesome, right?”

Shan Ling did not reply. Moments later, his body fell apart and crashed into the East Sea, stirring up huge waves.

After all signs of life dissipated, his huge body gradually disintegrated, turning into specks of starlight that flickered in the sky.

As Ye Xuan witnessed this scene, he raised his head and looked into the distant sky. He could vaguely hear an extremely tragic roar.

On the other side, a huge ferocious beast that had been asleep for countless years had woken up. Its roar shook the heavens.

If he listened carefully, he could hear it from here.

“Alright, just you wait and see! I’ll definitely get back at you for what you’ve done today. I’ll tear you to pieces!”

The one who spoke was Shan Ling’s true body. After his clone had been killed by Ye Xuan, it forced his true body to awaken.

The moment he woke up, the entire world seemed to shake violently, and endless lightning flashed in the sky. From this it could be seen that this old monster’s combat strength was indeed very terrifying. He was truly worthy of being called one of the top experts in the Heavenly Dao World.

However, the world that Ye Xuan was in now could not accommodate his main body at all, so he had no way to deal with Ye Xuan at this moment. He had to wait until Ye Xuan ascended to the Heavenly Dao World.

After hearing this roar everyone realized that Ye Xuan’s grudge with the lightning tiger clan had reached an irreconcilable stage.

Yanran also began to worry at this moment. No matter what, it would not be long before Ye Xuan would be ready to ascend to the Heavenly Dao World.

‘Hehe… I have to prepare well for this,’ Ye Xuan thought to himself. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After the battle ended, people were still trembling in fear. There were still many people who had yet to recover from their shock.

“Oh my god, Ye Xuan really lives up to his title as Sword Immortal. Every time I see him fight, his strength keeps astounding me.”

“Not long ago, he killed the golden-furred growler ancestor, and now he’s killed the lightning tiger high ancestor. I wonder who he will kill next…”

“He’s really too domineering. Honestly, I really look up to him as a role model…”

After this battle ended, Ye Xuan’s fame spread throughout the eight continents, and there were even whispers about him in the Heavenly Dao World. From this moment on, the Heavenly Dao World’s Great Wilderness Divine sect began to pay attention to Ye Xuan, and were even making plans to try and ensure his safe passage to the Heavenly Dao World.

After all, Shan Ling and the lightning tiger clan would definitely not let Ye Xuan off lightly. If they could secure his safety and bring him into the sect, then they would be able to nurture and protect him, allowing him to develop into a true expert in the Heavenly Dao World.

However, many other forces would likely interfere with this, as the appearance of a peerless genius in the Great Wilderness Divine sect was not good news for the other factions.

Perhaps they might even band together to try and secretly eliminate Ye Xuan before he became a threat.

Ye Xuan did not know this, but many forces in the Heavenly Dao World were already making plans to deal with him. Perhaps if he knew, he would delay his ascent there.

“Mmmm…”

After the battle concluded, Ye Xuan stretched his body. It was as if he was saying that the battle had just been a warm up.

Ou Tian felt as if he was being insulted by this, and let out a furious snort, Ou Tian continued, “Hmph! What do you have to be so arrogant about? If it weren’t for the restrictions placed on Shan Ling by the laws of the world, how could you have won? You really are just a frog at the bottom of the well.”

“Just you wait and see. When you reach the Heavenly Dao World, you will see the true peerless geniuses, and then understand how inferior you are.”

Hearing Ou Tian’s words, Li Xuanzhen could not help but sigh and wave his hand helplessly. This senior brother of his was often too rash, and now there was a grudge between Ou Tian and Ye Xuan that was likely to be difficult to resolve.

They would likely have to fight it out before the grudge could finally be put to rest. Hopefully, that fight would not result in any casualties.

Ignoring Ou Tian’s words, Ye Xuan put away the Godsword and flew back to Yanran’s side.
