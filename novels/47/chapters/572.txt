573 A Mountain Of Gold (Part 1)

When they entered the room, Ye Xuan sent the servant away. Zhuge Yueyue then asked him, “Teacher, why did you purchase so many herbs? Do you want to open an herb business?”

Feng Xiyun was also looking at Ye Xuan with great interest, waiting for an answer.

Ye Xuan also slowly opened his mouth at this time, “Actually, it’s nothing much. I just want to teach you how to refine pills. The herbs are in preparation for that.”

“Ah? Teach us how to refine pills?”

!!

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, the two of them secretly rejoiced.

After all, as cultivators, they definitely knew how popular alchemists were.

Even if their alchemy skills were not particularly good, they could still refine pills for their own use. In the future, there would be no need to ask others for help.

Furthermore, they had seen how precious the pills that Ye Xuan often used and gave away were, so their excitement was understandable.

“Alright, now is not the time to be happy. After all, alchemy is not an easy craft to learn.”

“Not only must you have a certain level of talent, but you must also persevere and practice hard. Only then will you be able to refine high-quality pills.”

“But you don’t have to be too discouraged. Even if you can’t refine high-quality pills, it’s not a big deal. After all, I have plenty of pills in reserve for you to use.”

“I’m just teaching you alchemy to increase your repertoire. Who knows, it might be helpful to you both in the future.”

It truly was a blessing for them to be Ye Xuan’s disciples. They would never lack cultivation resources, treasures, or techniques.

“Don’t worry, Teacher. We’ll do our best to master alchemy,” Zhuge Yueyue replied with confidence.

Ye Xuan was very pleased with this, but at the same time, the corners of his mouth curled up.

It was time to reap some rewards from his disciples.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan pretended to sigh affectionately. He looked at his two disciples and said, “The two of you have suffered a lot following me.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Our Cloud Sky peak is really too poor, and I haven’t had enough money to even buy you new clothes. You both haven’t had the chance to dress up like other girls your age.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, they felt moved. They really did not expect their teacher to even consider these things.

“Teacher, don’t say that. You’ve already been very good to us, so how would we dare to ask for anything else?”

Zhuge Yueyue’s voice trembled as she spoke.

Moments later, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Feng Xiyun.

“Xiyun, you were born into the royal family. You could’ve enjoyed a luxurious life, but you’ve suffered so much with me instead.”

“As your teacher, I want you to be safe and to be able to cultivate diligently, but I also want you to live happy lives.”

Feng Xiyun quickly said, “Teacher, I’m actually very satisfied with our current lives. Material things like money really aren’t important. Besides, we’re already quite happy, so please don’t worry about such things.”

At this point, Ye Xuan finally got to the point.

Ye Xuan took the thousands of profound gold he had received from the Su family, and said while sighing, “This is all I can give you. Go ahead and spend it. Get some pretty clothes and accessories for yourselves.”

Seeing that huge amount of profound gold, Zhuge Yueyue was completely dumbfounded. This was the first time she had seen so much profound gold!

However, although she felt very grateful, she still wanted to reject it.

Unexpectedly, Ye Xuan spoke before Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun could reject him.

“My dear disciples, in the future, you’ll definitely need to make your own living outside. What will you do if you don’t have money?”

“This is only a small amount of money. Please accept it. You’ll need it in the future.”

“This is all I can give you.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, they could no longer bring themselves to reject him. Their teacher was truly the best, and had never stopped caring for them.

Ever since they became his disciples, they had always been protected, nurtured and taken care of. No matter what they encountered, their teacher would always stand behind them. It was truly a blessing of a lifetime.

“Teacher, we understand. We’ll keep the profound gold.”

After some sniffling and crying, the girls finally agreed.

Seeing that his two disciples had finally accepted the profound gold, Ye Xuan’s heart was bursting with joy.

Fortunately, he was rather good at acting and with words. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to get them to agree.

Although Ye Xuan was secretly happy, the expression on his face was still calm as he comforted his disciples.

“Alright, alright, there’s no need to be so emotional. Keep the profound gold in your storage spaces first.”

“You can go out and shop to your heart’s content later, and buy whatever you like. You don’t have to be bothered about this small amount of money, okay?”

After saying that, Ye Xuan patted their heads.

Zhuge Yueyue looked at Ye Xuan and replied, “Alright, Teacher. We understand.”
