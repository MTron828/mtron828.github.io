454 The Difference Between Them

“Oh my God, your teacher is too good…”

Li Xue’er was envious.

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun smiled. Every time she thought of her teacher, her heart would be filled with happiness.

“Teacher’s kindness to us is immense. He’s not the slightest bit stingy when it comes to cultivation guidance and heavenly treasures. It’s our great fortune to have become Teacher’s disciples!”

Li Xue’er was a little embarrassed by this. She recalled when she had actually thought that Ye Xuan was as the rumors said.

Back then, believing him to be useless, she had coaxed her teacher into trying to bring Zhuge Yueyue to Water Sky peak.

However, she could not have been more wrong.

In the entire East continent, who could have a better teacher?

With such a selfless and powerful teacher, who would think of joining another peak?

Furthermore, she had seen him give Zhuge Yueyue the Cloud Sky sword, which was the representative magic artifact of Cloud Sky peak. This meant that she was the successor of Cloud Sky peak.

Even though she was envious, Li Xue’er still felt happy for Zhuge Yueyue.

“Yueyue, I’m really happy that you managed to find a good teacher like Chief Ye Xuan. When you become a strong expert like him in the future, don’t forget me.”

Zhuge Yueyue revealed a gentle smile and held Li Xue’er’s hand.

“Xue’er, we grew up together. No matter what happens in the future, our relationship will not change,”

“I hope so,” Li Xue’er nodded sadly.

Naturally, she wanted to maintain a good relationship with Zhuge Yueyue. However, time spared no one. As Zhuge Yueyue’s strength grew, the gap between them would also grow.

Perhaps in the future, their friendship would only exist in name.

After all, the path of cultivation was a long one. Who could guarantee what would happen in the future?

Over the past three months, Li Xue’er had gained a deeper understanding of the cultivation world.

In the mystic world, cultivation was the most important, and strength presided over everything. If one’s cultivation level remained stagnant, no matter how outstanding one’s talent was, they would eventually be left by the roadside.

Perhaps in the future, she would not even have the right to stand by Zhuge Yueyue’s side.

Yuelun naturally noticed the change in Li Xue’er’s expression. She sighed softly and did not say anything.

There were many disciples in Water Sky peak.

However, cultivation resources were limited. No matter how much Yuelun liked Li Xue’er, she could only invest the peak’s cultivation resources in disciples with outstanding talents.

‘This guy is really detestable. He definitely sent these two girls to damage my self-confidence,Yuelun grumbled inwardly.

Then, she looked at Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue again.

“With that precious bone, it’s only natural that you experienced such a leap in your cultivation level.”

“However, don’t relax because of this. On the path of cultivation, if you don’t advance, you will fall behind. You must always keep your teacher’s expectations in mind.”

The two of them looked at each other and nodded with determination.

Zhuge Yueyue even said, “Please rest assured, Chief Yuelun. We will definitely not let Teacher down!”

“En!” When Yuelun heard this, she smiled. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This girl was quite good! Ye Xuan’s disciple had a good character.

“That’s good.”

Yuelun nodded.

…

At the same time, at Hidden Sword peak, Gao Shun had woken up. However, his expression was still one of anger.

He stood up from the bed with difficulty, his face as black as ink.

When he thought about what had happened just now, he almost had an aneurysm.

“Detestable!”

“Ye Xuan, Cloud Sky peak, just you wait!”

Gao Shun’s palm slammed against the bedside table, reducing it to dust.

The cultivators who were outside the residence heard the commotion inside and trembled. They knew Gao Shun’s temper, and that they would definitely suffer his wrath after such a poor showing at the competition.

“Why are you still standing outside? Hurry up and get in here!”

Gao Shun’s furious roar echoed in the surroundings.

The disciples had no other choice than to enter the residence. Their foreheads were sweating profusely, and their faces were full of anxiety.

“You’re all really trash! I’ve provided you with resources and guidance, yet what did I get in return? Nothing!”

“You’ve damaged my reputation and the reputation of Hidden Sword peak.”

“If we can’t even defeat Cloud Sky peak, what right do we have to call ourselves the strongest peak of the Great Wilderness Divine sect?”

“We’ve become a joke thanks to this!”

The disciples all lowered their heads, not daring to respond.
