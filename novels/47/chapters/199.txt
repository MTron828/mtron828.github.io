Chapter 200: Traveling To The Radiant Sky Empire

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What?”

“You… you said that this jade token contains the power of a pattern condensation realm cultivator?”

“That’s… That’s the realm that’s beyond the unity realm…”

Wan Shanhai and the others were completely dumbfounded.

“That’s right! The jade token indeed contains the terrifying power of a pattern condensation realm expert. This is also the final trump card of our Qingyun sect. Unless you encounter a sect-destroying calamity, you must not use it,” Ye Xuan said.

“Of course, if things are really that dire, you have to maximize the power of the jade token. It’s best if you can kill all of the enemies when you use it!”

“Don’t worry, Elder Ye. We will definitely be cautious!”

Wan Shanhai and the others’ expressions were solemn.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled and nodded. This was for the best.

Then, Ye Xuan called Yue and Li Qingyan over. Then, he summoned his mount and turned into a streak of light, disappearing.

Looking in the direction in which Ye Xuan and the others disappeared, Wan Shanhai and the others were filled with emotion.

They did not expect that even Ye Xuan’s mount had the power of a unity realm cultivator. It was truly terrifying!

…

In order to reach the Radiant Sky Empire from the Great Qian Dynasty, they had to cross more than 50 empires.

Even though the black flame eagle was fast, it would take some time to reach. After all, it could not fly at top speed all the time.

Ye Xuan instructed the black flame eagle to release its unity realm aura as they traveled.

Flying mounts were extremely rare, let alone one that had reached the unity realm.

It was precisely because of this terrifying aura that no creature or cultivator dared to cause trouble for them on their journey. Those passersby simply hid and trembled, waiting for it to pass.

On the black flame eagle’s huge back, Ye Xuan, Yue and Li Qingyan sat cross-legged and closed their eyes to cultivate.

While Yue comprehended the soul condensation technique, she also divided her mind to slowly absorb the power of the Sword Orchid Valley Lord.

In comparison, Li Qingyan was fully focused on comprehending the soul condensation technique. Thanks to her high comprehension value, she was almost done comprehending the soul condensation technique.

The most ridiculous was Ye Xuan, who was doing three things at once.

After all, his soul and spiritual sense was extremely strong. Not only could he divide his mind to refine the Void Herb’s power in his body, he could also cultivate the divine forging technique.

In addition, Ye Xuan also directed a wisp of his spiritual sense into the Tower of Heaven, which was in his sea of consciousness.

The size of one’s sea of consciousness was proportional to the strength of the cultivator’s soul.

Demonic beasts that had signed a contract with the cultivator, or artifacts that were specially refined, could all be stored in the cultivator’s sea of consciousness.

There were even many cultivators who cultivated their natal artifacts in their sea of consciousness. After all, if those artifacts were infused with the power of their own soul, not only would they gain more control over it, but it would become stronger to a certain extent.

At this moment, an ancient tower was floating in Ye Xuan’s sea of consciousness.

Looking at the supreme intents present in the Tower of Heaven, Ye Xuan felt excited.

Karmic and spatial intents!

If one could comprehend spatial intent, they would be able to borrow the power of the world’s natural spatial laws. They could even create spatial blades with extremely powerful destructive power. In addition, they could use spatial power to restrain their enemies.

However, in comparison, Ye Xuan valued karmic intent more.

After all, this was the most mysterious of the supreme intents. Although it would not increase his strength significantly, if he successfully comprehended it, Ye Xuan would be a prophet.

There was an extremely terrifying existence that wanted to kill him?

No problem!

As long as he used karmic intent, Ye Xuan would be able to predict the other party’s actions in advance and plan ahead.

Moreover, as long as the other party did not comprehend karmic intent or have an artifact with the power of karma, they would not be able to locate Ye Xuan’s whereabouts using any secret techniques.

However, how could it be easy to comprehend karmic intent?

Even with Ye Xuan’s comprehension value of over 600 points, he was still confused and had no clue where to start at all.

Unless he experienced an epiphany again, and one that lasted for an extremely long time, perhaps even a few years, it was unlikely that he would be able to comprehend karmic intent.

“Forget it! I’ll comprehend spatial intent first.”

Ye Xuan shook his head helplessly.

Although heavenly lightning and spatial intents were both supreme intents, the latter was undoubtedly more difficult to comprehend.

Of course, Ye Xuan was not discouraged. After all, he now owned the Tower of Heaven. There were extremely plentiful heavenly treasures inside, including those that would give him the opportunity to experience an epiphany.

Originally, these heavenly treasures were meant to reward those who successfully stepped into the 95th to 98th level of the Tower of Heaven, but they were now all his.

After examining the treasures, Ye Xuan discovered that there were a few treasures that would allow him to experience an epiphany.

Currently, the month-long cooldown of giving his disciples a treasure from that category had yet to pass, so he was unable to reap the system’s rewards if he gave it to them..

However, he was not in a hurry. He could still use two.

Ye Xuan wanted to use these two epiphany experiences to comprehend spatial intent in its entirety, and not just the embryonic form of spatial intent!

“Two Buddha Spirit Fruits, one Dream Nebula spirit fruit, one Wind Spirit Moon, and one Withered Leaf Bodhi!”

Then, Ye Xuan tried to grasp spatial intent again, but he was still at a loss. He had no idea where to start. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Now, it seemed that he could only comprehend spatial intent by taking advantage of these epiphany experiences the heavenly treasures gave him.

…

Radiant Sky Empire, White Moon Tower.

On the peak of a huge mountain, there was a pavilion.

Two men were talking in the pavilion.

“Are you sure you saw correctly?”

Li Baijun looked at the man in front of him and asked.

This man had saved his life before, so their relationship was pretty good. After Li Baijun became a cultivator of the White Moon Tower, he had taken care of the man.

Today, this man actually said that he saw Zhao Yuyan obtain a great opportunity in the mystic realm.

At first, he was too lazy to pay attention to it, but after hearing the man’s story, he became interested.
