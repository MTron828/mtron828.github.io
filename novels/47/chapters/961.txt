Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

If the Great Wilderness Divine sect really wanted to wage war against the Immortal Divine sect, the most important thing was to get rid of Gongsun Ming.

If they could not defeat Gongsun Ming, the sect would suffer a crushing defeat.

Seeing that everyone’s attention had shifted to him, Ye Xuan said confidently, “Haha! Isn’t that a simple matter?”

“Senior brothers, if you want to start a war, then go ahead. Don’t worry. Let me deal with Gongsun Ming!”

Ye Xuan was very confident in himself, and firmly believed that he could easily deal with Gongsun Ming. Ao Lei and the others would deal with the rest of the Immortal Divine sect.

After all, there would definitely be casualties due to the huge grudge between the two sects. Furthermore, the newest disciples of the sect had yet to experience a bloody battle, so this would be a test of their courage.

Only by passing this test would they be able to grow stronger in the future.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Ao Lei also made a prompt decision and ordered with a fierce expression, “All members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, heed my command. The extermination operation against the Immortal Divine sect will begin immediately!”

“From now on, kill anyone from the Immortal Divine sect that we come across, no matter who they are!”

“We will teach them the price of antagonizing our sect!”

After hearing this, a series of heart-shaking shouts immediately rang out in the forest.

“The Great Wilderness Divine sect will be triumphant!”

“The Immortal Divine sect must perish!”

Seeing their hot-blooded expressions, Ye Xuan also felt his blood boil.

After this battle, the forces of the eight continents would realize the might of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!

Then, he turned to look at Huangfu Qi, who immediately trembled. The latter could also sense the killing intent and hatred everyone had toward the Immortal Divine sect, and began to worry for his sect. Would they be able to withstand the wrath of these people?

Unfortunately, he would play no part in this battle.

Ye Xuan looked around and said, “Senior Brother Ao, we shouldn’t stay here for long. Let’s leave this place first before discussing our plans.”

For some reason, Ye Xuan felt that something was wrong.

At this moment, Ao Lei also felt that they should not stay in this place any longer. He instructed the disciples of the Great Desolate Divine sect to follow Ye Xuan’s lead, and to leave this place as soon as possible.

However, just as they were about to escape from this area, another seal descended from the above, blocking their path.

After discovering this situation, Ye Xuan’s expression turned ugly, and many of the disciples were bewildered.

“What happened?”

The path in front of them had been completely sealed off, and they could no longer move forward.

At this moment, Ye Xuan also clearly realized that this was definitely a trap within a trap. Even Huangfu Qi did not know about this.

“Hehe… Gongsun Ming, this old fellow, really went all out!”

The moment the seal descended, Ye Xuan saw the change in Huangfu Qi’s expression. The latter was also very shocked.

That was right. Even Huangfu Qi did not know that there was a seal here.

Gongsun Ming had already predicted that these people were likely to capitulate, so he added a hidden seal in the cave to ensure that even if someone betrayed him, the outcome would not change.

At this moment, Huangfu Qi felt as if his heart had been hammered, and his eyes had lost all their luster.

He had always been selflessly contributing to the Immortal Divine sect and had made countless contributions.

However, who would have thought that the sect’s ancestor would distrust him?

“You seem very shocked.”

After seeing Huangfu Qi’s expression, Ye Xuan said coldly, “Don’t you understand? In Gongnsun Ming’s heart, you are all just chess pieces that can be abandoned at any time!”

“Your lives are worthless in Gongsun Ming’s eyes. This is the true nature of the person you believe in, hahaha!”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s mockery, Huangfu Qi had completely collapsed and muttered, “It can’t be like this. How could the ancestor treat me like that?”

“No, no!”

At that moment, Huangfu Qi felt as if his world had collapsed. He had always been loyal to the ancestor, but he had been mercilessly abandoned.

Hearing his crazed muttering, Ye Xuan laughed even more.

“This is the truth. You’re not a fool, so you should understand what’s going on.

You just don’t want to accept it.”‘

After that, Ye Xuan no longer cared about him and did not take his life.

In a sense, this was a form of torture as well. Gongsun Ming had completely disregarded the life and death of his own people, which was the height of ruthlessness and viciousness.

Turning around, Ye Xuan began to examine the seal in front of him. It was worth mentioning that Gongsun Ming was very good at seals.

If Ye Xuan and the others wanted to escape, then they had to remove this seal.

Otherwise, they would be trapped here forever.

“Junior Brother, what should we do now?”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ao Lei looked at Ye Xuan and asked. Everyone else did as well. After all, in this situation, only Ye Xuan had the ability to save them..
