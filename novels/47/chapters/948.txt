949 Prelude

“If I’m not wrong, this opening of this ancient palace means that the battle for the Heavenly Stairway is about to begin.”

“Just now, the sect sent me a message that some of the peerless experts of the other sects have already appeared, including those who have disappeared for a long time.”

“It’s obvious that their goal is this treasury,” Yanran said seriously.

Then, she continued, “Ye Xuan, I can sense that after this excursion to the ancient palace, I’ll be ascending to the Heavenly Dao World very soon.”

After saying this, Yanran’s eyes were filled with reluctance.

In fact, she had been able to head to the Heavenly Dao World a long time ago. However, because Ye Xuan was here in this world, she had always suppressed herself and tried her best to stall for time.

However, when she recalled the incident regarding the lightning tiger high ancestor, she realized that she had to go to the Heavenly Dao World as soon as possible. By doing so, she would be able to make preparations to help Ye Xuan avoid any disasters involving his own ascension.

There were too many forces who would not want a genius like Ye Xuan to ascend.

Seeing her reluctance, Ye Xuan felt his heart ache. He gently hugged her and comforted her.

“Don’t worry…”

“It won’t be long before we can meet again in the Heavenly Dao World. You can go without worry.”

“No matter where you go, you just have to believe that I will always be silently behind you.”

Ye Xuan gave Yanran a guarantee. In fact, he himself could have gone to the Heavenly Dao World long ago, but he had been suppressing himself because he was worried about his disciples. He had to make sure that everything was in order before ascending.

Moreover, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had only just recovered. Although things had improved in the sect, it was still unwise to ascend to the Heavenly Dao World before the situation had completely stabilized.

This was also something he had promised Daoist Yi Feng.

Yanran’s heart trembled as she looked at him. A bright smile appeared on her face. She felt lucky to have met someone who loved her so much.

She quietly kissed his cheek, and the atmosphere seemed to take on a rose-colored hue.

“Why are they showing off their love again? How annoying…”

Seeing this scene, the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s heart seemed to have suffered a terrible blow. Why could it not experience love?

“Fine, I’ll go, I’ll go. Alright…”

As he spoke, the Thunder-Devouring Beast turned around and left without hesitation. He did not want to see anything more.

Although he had noticed the aggrieved look on the Thunder-Devouring Beast’s face, Ye Xuan could not help but burst out laughing when he saw the latter leave in a huff.

After Ye Xuan comforted her, Yanran was not as melancholic as before. She said calmly, “Let’s go.”

At this moment, her gaze was determined. She had decided to press forward toward the future. Besides, she also had her own challenges to face. As one of the inheritors of the Saintess’ legacy, the competition for the position of successor was very fierce.

The other inheritors would have already arrived in the Heavenly Dao World by now, so if she stayed here, she would be at a disadvantage. Thus, her ascension was unavoidable. She could not fall behind the other inheritors, and had to improve her cultivation level in the shortest time possible.

After noticing Yanran’s determined gaze, Ye Xuan felt satisfied. He nodded and said, “Alright, let’s set off.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he held her hand, and the pair set off in the direction of the treasury.

After flying for some time, they arrived at an upper level of the ancient palace. Here, they could sense a dense immortal aura.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s gaze was firmly locked on this space in the sky.

“The immortal energy and the aura it is releasing is really terrifying…”

He could not help but take a deep breath. Just how terrifying was the owner of this ancient palace?

As time passed, more and more people arrived from the eight continents. Experts had all rushed here to get a share of the treasures.

Ye Xuan even saw a familiar figure…

Ou Yunhai.

However, Ye Xuan’s focus was on someone else, as he had already noticed a thin old man staring at him with hatred.

The latter’s eyes were already filled with killing intent. Ye Xuan was a little confused about who this was and why this person was targeting him. He could not recall ever offending this old man.

“Just who is this person?”

Yanran was momentarily stunned when she heard him mutter this, and also turned to look at the old man. Immediately after, her brows furrowed and she replied coldly, “He is Gongsun Ming of the Immortal Divine sect.”

“Someone from the Immortal Divine sect?”

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan’s thoughts immediately flashed back to the Immortal Divine sect that the Great Wilderness Divine sect had destroyed back then.

It seemed that the Immortal Divine sect also existed in other continents as well. Aside from destroying the East continent’s Immortal Divine sect, Ye Xuan had also killed a member of the Immortal Divine sect from another continent in the ancient tomb, Ouyang Feng.

“Haha, this is interesting. Is this person here for revenge?”

At this point, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. He looked at the old man in front of him with disdain.

He could sense that this old man was also a sealed immortal realm expert. Furthermore, this old man’s cultivation foundation was extremely stable, and it seemed that he had reached the limits of the sealed immortal realm.

Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!
