811 Barrier Shatters

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt a little disappointed. He had been so awesome just now, yet Yanran was not around to witness his feats with her own eyes. It was really a pity.

He wondered what she was doing at the moment…

Could it be that she was also preparing to complete her Dao and advance to the sealed immortal realm?

Not long ago, when they were communicating past the barrier, Ye Xuan had already noticed that Yanran’s aura was already at the peak of the ancient realm.

Moreover, as the Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, she probably had access to enough resources to break through, right?

He felt that this was the case. Thinking this, Ye Xuan was very happy.

My girlfriend is really pretty good. She was following in his footsteps.

After that, Ye Xuan took a serious look at his surroundings, which had been completely devastated by the aftermath of the battle.

“Sigh… This move is indeed very powerful, but the aftermath is too great. I even had to consume an immortal-grade pill.”

Still, it was all necessary in order to achieve victory and resolve the grudge that the Great Wilderness Divine sect had for the past hundred years. He had broken through to the sealed immortal realm. The end result was quite satisfactory.

Suddenly, at this moment, a loud roar was heard, attracting Ye Xuan’s attention.

In the sky, the huge skeleton roared angrily. It was originally trapped by Daoist Yi Feng, but after the latter died, the power restraining it disappeared.

Feeling endless resentment, it opened its mouth wide and began to devour crazily, trying to drag everyone to hell with it.

Ye Xuan watched this scene with a cold expression. He casually swung the Godsword.

“You impudent thing, go to hell!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Godsword instantly split the skeleton into two and then flew back into Ye Xuan’s hand.

However, Ye Xuan did not stop there. He raised his sword and released another sword beam, instantly destroying the skeleton’s soul.

Ye Xuan’s face was still expressionless. Then, he turned around to look at Daoist Yi Feng and Mengyu.

When he noticed that Daoist Yi Feng had passed away with a relieved expression on his face, Ye Xuan felt very emotional.

“Sigh… Martial Uncle, why did you lie to me?”

Ye Xuan felt a little uncomfortable at this moment and muttered to himself, “Actually, I should have expected it. The immortal bones are so powerful, so there was no way they would be destroyed so easily.”

Daoist Yi Feng had been waiting for an opportunity to die with Mengyu to end the threat for good. Before he died, he even pulled Mengyu into the reincarnation cycle to prevent any accidents from happening.

If Ye Xuan’s guess was correct, they would be reborn together.

After experiencing this matter, what would happen between the two of them?

He was even wondering whether he should intervene, and make sure that things went well. However, how could he find their birthplace?

Just as Ye Xuan was considering this, the sky suddenly started cracking. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Oh no, fall back! The world barrier is about to shatter!”

At this moment, many experts who were still close to the barrier retreated frantically, afraid that they would be caught up in whatever happened when it did.

More and more cracks began to spread out, and with a loud bang the barrier shattered into fragments and scattered on the ground.

Everyone looked up at the sky in unison, only to see that the sky was once again covered with dark clouds. Clearly, a huge change was about to take place.

“What exactly is this?”

On the East Continent, people looked up at them in confusion. Many people had no idea what was going on.

When Ye Xuan saw the world barrier shatter, he instantly understood what was happening. He put the Godsword away and returned to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

“Junior Brother Ye, what exactly is going on?”

After seeing Ye Xuan return, Gao Shun immediately asked.

Ye Xuan replied calmly, “The world barrier that separated the eight continents has been broken. The eight continents might soon be reunited again. The battle for the immortal path is about to begin.”

Seeing Ye Xuan say these words with a serious expression, everyone was taken aback.

“A battle for the immortal path?”

“What is the meaning of this?”

“The East Continent isn’t the only continent in this world.”

“However, because the world barrier separated the continents, things remained harmonious up till now.”

“Now that the world barrier has shattered, the experts from other continents will be able to travel between continents.”

“There are also many peerless geniuses in the other continents. They too are pursuing the immortal path, and everyone will have to compete in order to strengthen themselves and reach the peak.”

Everyone’s mood turned heavy, feeling as if another burden had been placed on their shoulders. Would the geniuses of the East continent be able to compete with the other continents?

If their geniuses fell behind, would they not be despised by the other continents?

At the same time, everyone pondered on which geniuses would represent the East continent. Two of Ye Xuan’s disciples, Zhuge Yueyue and Xiang Yun, were among the foremost candidates for this.
