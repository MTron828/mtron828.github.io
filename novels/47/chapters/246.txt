Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Xuan’s name once again resounded in the hearts of countless cultivators, and everyone was discussing his feats, though the person himself was unbothered by this.

He was dealing with the spoils of war in high spirits. After that, he would reap the system’s rewards from his disciples before going over to exterminate the Blood Moon Temple, Nether God sect, and the Yunjin Temple.

Inside the Tower of Heaven.

The Tower of Heaven contained the spatial intent left behind by that almighty expert, so it naturally was very spacious.

When Ye Xuan had taken out the Tower of Heaven earlier, he had moved the entire Qingyun sect into it and isolated them from the outside world.

At first, everyone went about their own business.

However, as time passed, many people began to worry, especially Ye Xuan’s disciples.

A few days ago, Yue and the others were full of confidence in Ye Xuan, believing that their teacher would definitely be able to kill the enemies and return triumphantly.

However, as time passed, worry flooded their hearts. They had never experienced or heard of such a long battle.

Lingjiu peak.

“Don’t worry, Ye Xuan will be fine!”

Elder Lin Qing looked at Ye Xuan’s disciples with a complicated expression.

She too was worried, but could not display that outwardly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Still, Ye Xuan’s soul jade token was intact, which meant that he was alive, which alleviated their worries somewhat.

However, the soul jade token was only an indicator of whether they were alive or dead, so they had no idea of whether he was injured or in danger.

The most troubling thing was the length of the battle.

Many people automatically imagined Ye Xuan being chased by a group of terrifying existences.

Lin Qing sighed deeply in her heart.

It seemed that these little girls really cared about Ye Xuan’s safety, otherwise they wouldn’t be so worried.

Yue and the others had initially been cultivating diligently in the Tower of Heaven. However, as time slowly passed, and Ye Xuan did not show up, they lost their mood to cultivate.

A ‘Yue and the others immediately became worried. How could they still have the mood to cultivate martial skills?

This was especially true for Zhao Yuyan.

When Lin Qingping saw this, she felt helpless.

Her precious daughter’s mind was filled with thoughts about her teacher.

She was afraid that Ye Xuan would suddenly leave her like her father.

Buzzzzzz!

Suddenly, the sky above the Tower of Heaven started to fluctuate slightly.

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.

Yue and the others’ eyes immediately lit up.

Buzzzzzz!

After the mysterious spatial fluctuations reached them, everyone saw a flash of light before their eyes. When they reappeared, they were already back in the outside world.

As for the gigantic Tower of Heaven, it had already turned into a streak of light and entered Ye Xuan’s body.

“Teacher!”

Yue, Li Qingyan, and Zhao Yuyan immediately cried out in excitement and relief.

They had been worried that they would never see their teacher again!

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan turned into a streak of light and returned to Lingjiu peak. Looking at his worried disciples, he revealed a gentle look.

Yue and the others rushed over excitedly into Ye Xuan’s arms.

They held onto him tightly, unwilling to let go.

“Elder Ye!”

Elder Lin Qing was also surprised to see Ye Xuan.

“What’s wrong with you girls?”

Ye Xuan rubbed the heads of Yue and the others gently with a helpless expression.

“I just went out to fight. Is there a need to be so worried?”

After breaking free from their grasp, he gently picked Zhao Yuyan up.

“Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan wiped away the tears on her face, her eyes filled with worry for Ye Xuan.

“Alright! Everything is over now,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“Elder Lin Qing,” Ye Xuan looked at Elder Lin Qing and said.

“Ah?”

“Elder Lin Qing, I have to hand some things over to you.”

“The current strength of the Qingyun sect is too weak. Whether it’s in terms of cultivation techniques or heavenly treasures, we are greatly lacking!”

“Today, I’ll teach you some of the martial techniques and cultivation methods I’ve obtained.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan extended his index finger and placed it on Elder Lin Qing’s forehead.

Moments later, the information on the various martial arts techniques and cultivation methods suddenly surged into her mind.
