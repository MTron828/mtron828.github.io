654 Victory

Looking at the huge flower sword that had manifested in front of him, Daoist Gu Hao frowned. He did not understand what Ye Xuan was trying to do.

While he was in the time domain, the sword Ye Xuan had condensed should not be able to hurt him at all.

After all, even if this sword was right in front of him, if he willed it, the sword would not be able to hit him at all.

Just as he was thinking this, he suddenly noticed the smile on Ye Xuan’s face.

“Hehe, Daoist Gu Hao, you seem to be very confident in your time domain.”

“It so happens that I’ve just comprehended a move, so you can be its first guinea pig.”

After hearing this, Daoist Gu Hao laughed.

“Fine. Show me your technique. I want to see just how you plan to overcome my time domain.”

He did not believe that Ye Xuan’s move could break his time domain. Even Tian xXuan could not do it.

Back then, he had only just comprehended the time domain, which was why Tian Xuan had been able to escape.

Now that he had completely mastered it, there was no escaping his time domain.

At this time, Ye Xuan’s expression was still calm.

Then, all of a sudden, the huge sword streaked across the sky toward Daoist Gu Hao.

His time domain was completely useless. It was as if it did not exist.

Moments later, a loud boom was heard, and leaves were scattered all over the sky as the time domain shattered. However, the huge sword was still heading toward Daoist Gu Hao.

Seeing this, his expression changed drastically, and he tried to escape. However, it was to no avail, as the sword reached him, and stopped right in front of him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

If he dared to move rashly, he would probably die.

He was actually defeated…

Daoist Gu Hao’s legs trembled. Ye Xuan’s sword intent was firmly locked on to him, so he did not dare to move. This was the first time in countless years that he had felt so close to death.

As for Ye Xuan, even though he could deal a fatal blow at any time, he chose not to. There was no great enmity between the two forces, so there was no need to take his life. Starting a war here would be pointless and wasteful.

Furthermore, even if they did destroy the Supreme Divine sect, it would only cause more problems for the Great Wilderness Divine sect, as the other sects would become wary of them and possibly join forces to restrain them.

Retracting his sword intent, Ye Xuan said calmly, “Daoist Gu Hao, it’s my win this time.”

Ye Xuan was quite excited by the power of the Heaven-splitting Sword that he had just displayed. It truly was a miraculous technique.

In any case, the fact that Daoist Gu Hao had forced Ye Xuan to use this technique was a testament to how extraordinary the former’s time domain was. Without the Heaven-splitting Sword, Ye Xuan would have been hard-pressed to win.

After saying this, Ye Xuan returned to the group, leaving Daoist Gu Hao in the sky in a daze.

“You won so easily?”

Gao Shun was excited by Ye Xuan’s performance, and felt that it was time to show off.

He glanced at Daoist Black Iron while speaking to the disciples behind him.

“It seems that the Supreme Divine sect isn’t worth their salt. An expert of the older generation actually lost so thoroughly.”

“If it were me, I would find a hole and bury myself in it.”

“Gao Shun! Don’t go too far!”

Daoist Black Iron was so angry that he started trembling.

“Hmph! If you’re not happy with me, then why don’t we duke it out?”

Gao Shun looked at Daoist Black Iron threateningly.

The latter was furious, but also knew that Gao Shun was a supreme realm expert. As such, there was no way that such a fight would end well.

“Damn it…”

He clenched his fists so tightly that they creaked, as he forced himself to suppress his anger.

Daoist Black Iron turned around and left without the slightest hesitation. Staying around here would only invite more ridicule.

Seeing Daoist Black Iron’s helpless expression, Han Tai, who had been standing in the crowd, revealed a strange smile.

‘Hehe, it’s quite satisfying to see that old cur helpless like that.’

‘Just you wait! It won’t be long before I teach you the true meaning of regret,’ Han Tai thought viciously. Then, he looked at Gu Hao, who was in the sky.

He had endured until now and had not chosen to make a move because this old ancestor was still alive. When Daoist Gu Hao passed away, it would be time for him to take revenge!

When Ye Xuan rejoined the group, Gao Shun immediately praised him without hesitation, “Haha, Junior Brother Ye, you’ve really made us proud this time.”

“Your cultivation level has risen really quickly. Even I can’t fathom your strength now,” Ao Lei said.

He was also very happy.

As long as Ye Xuan continued to grow stronger, the status of the Great Wilderness Divine sect would naturally rise as well.

Furthermore, he was the first peak-level supreme realm expert since Chief Tian Xuan. As he nodded, Ye Xuan was suddenly seized by a pair of small hands.

“Teacher…”

Xiang Yun had really thought that her teacher would be like her parents and that old man, falling into eternal sleep.

Fortunately, no such thing happened.
