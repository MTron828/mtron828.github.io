959 Playing The Part

The ghosts that usually disguised themselves as Ye Xuan had at most reached the supreme realm, so it was very easy for him to deal with them. It had even become the only thing he somewhat looked forward to in this place.

However, why was the ghost so powerful this time?

A casual wave of his hand could send him flying dozens of meters?

“Fake! This has to be fake!”

Gao Shun patted the dust off his body and said, “This must be another kind of illusion!”

Gao Shun stared intently at Ye Xuan. He mobilized all the strength in his body, vigilant and ready.

‘These ghosts are truly detestable. It’s not the first time they’ve pretended to be disciples of the sect. I almost fell for their tricks last time…’

Thinking up to this point, the corners of Gao Shun’s mouth involuntarily curled up slightly as he opened his mouth and said, “Hehe, you damn little ghost, don’t even think about fooling me with your little tricks, okay? Hurry up and show your true colors!”

Seeing Gao Shun’s self-righteous expression, Ye Xuan felt that the former’s face looked quite punchable.

However, he was not in the mood to continue fooling around with Gao Shun, so he immediately said, “Gao Shun, I’m warning you. Don’t force me to expose all of the dirty things you’ve done all those years.”

“Hmph!”

Gao Shun appeared extremely disdainful at this moment and immediately replied, “Wow, you’re quite good at pretending. Continue pretending then!”

After hearing this, Ye Xuan’s expression turned ugly. It seemed that this fellow would not believe him unless some of the old dirt was leaked and exposed.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Xuan said straightforwardly, “Gao Shun, since I can’t recall some of the details, you can help me sort out my memories.”

“I happened to notice a sneaky person in the bamboo forest during the flower exhibition held by Water Sky peak. If I remember correctly, he was peeking at Sister Erin changing her clothes.”

“At that time, the sky was dark, so I couldn’t see who it was. However, I clearly remember that the person’s clothes seemed to be from your Hidden Sword peak…”

Before Ye Xuan could finish speaking, Gao Shun’s expression instantly changed drastically as he shouted, “My god!” Arrogant brat, you actually dared to say such things? I’m gonna teach you a good lesson!”

At this moment, Gao Shun already wished he could kill this ghost who was pretending to be Ye Xuan. If this ghost knew about this matter, it could not be allowed to live!

Gao Shun’s aura suddenly became much stronger, and his killing intent began to overflow. His ancient realm combat strength had been pushed to the limit.

If this matter was exposed to the others, his reputation would suffer a huge blow.

Besides, the Senior Sister Erin that Ye Xuan mentioned was an elder of Water Sky peak. She was about the same age as Yuelun and her looks were considered first-class.

Gao Shun, whose Dao companion passed away, had secretly liked her for a very long time. However, because he cared too much about his reputation, he could only keep his feelings to himself.

This matter was the most unspeakable secret in his heart. Other than heaven and earth, only he knew. However, unexpectedly, this ghost disguised as Ye Xuan could actually somehow dig out the memories in his heart, and even discovered this secret that was buried deep in his heart.

Gao Shun could no longer hold it in, and believed that he had to kill this ghost no matter what.

On the other hand, Ye Xuan was shocked when he saw Gao Shun like this.

‘F*ck! Why is this old fellow so excited all of a sudden? Is he trying to kill me just to hide the secret?’

Ye Xuan was sweating profusely at this moment, but he dodged the attacks and did not choose to fight back.

However, the commotion in this place soon attracted the attention of the other disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. In just a short while, hundreds of people had arrived.

Ao Lei also arrived, and when he saw Gao Shun fighting with Ye Xuan, he was shocked.

“Junior Brother Gao, what are you doing?” Ao Lei asked with a puzzled expression.

Gao Shun did not stop attacking and said without turning his head.

“Senior Brother Ao, this Ye Xuan is a ghost that can even discover the secrets in people’s hearts. Don’t believe his nonsense.”

“Ah?”

After hearing this, everyone immediately assumed a fighting stance.

As Ye Xuan saw that things were developing in the wrong direction, he could not hold it in anymore. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Damn it! Gao Shun, if you still don’t hurry up and stop, then don’t blame me for what happens next!”

“Haha! What a joke! If you have the ability, then bring it on!”

Hearing Gao Shun’s stubborn words, Ye Xuan decided that enough was enough.

“Fine then! It seems that you’re itching for a beating!”

Well, since he was considered an evil ghost, he might as well make use of this opportunity to beat this old fellow up.

Ye Xuan did not use his sealed immortal realm combat strength, lest he was accused of bullying others in the future.

After suppressing his cultivation to the ancient realm, the corners of his mouth could not help but curl up slightly, and his smile became even more brilliant.

‘Old man, I’ve actually been wanting to beat you up for a long time, but I just couldn’t find a reason. Since you’ve given me the perfect opportunity, you can only blame yourself now.’

Haha!

Ye Xuan happily released a divine lightning bolt that descended toward Gao Shun.

“Whoa!”

Gao Shun was shocked and immediately dodged. However, before he could retaliate, Ye Xuan was already in front of him.

Moments later, he felt immense pain from his stomach. He lowered his head and realized that Ye Xuan’s fist had already hit his stomach.

Boom!

Accompanied by a loud sound, Gao Shun was instantly sent flying and smashed into a huge rock.
