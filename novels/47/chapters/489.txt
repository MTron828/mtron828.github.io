490 The Grand Elder Of The Jade Lake Divine Sect

“I see…” The Reincarnation Fairy nodded and was about to say something.

However, Ye Xuan spoke first, “How about you guys? Did something happen?”

“We’re fine. Although the battle between those great beasts is extremely terrifying, we’re far enough away to avoid suffering any real damage,” she replied with a smile.

When Situ Mo saw that Ye Xuan had returned safely, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Right now, he was surrounded by many juniors from the Jade Lake Divine sect, and with such a terrifying battle taking place, it was truly difficult for him to hold it off by himself.

If something like what had happened to the Reincarnation Fairy happened again, he would have to bear the blame.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Chief Ye Xuan, you’ve finally returned!”

Situ Mo wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said happily, “I’m already so old, and my heart isn’t as strong as it once was. I was terrified for you just now.”

“If you had not come back, I would not have known what to say to your sect!”

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

‘I didn’t expect this old man to be so humorous!’

“However, Chief Ye Xuan’s sword attack just now was so terrifying! I have never seen anything like it. It can truly be called a divine sword strike!”

“After this battle, Chief Ye Xuan’s name will definitely spread throughout the East continent,” Situ Mo said with a face full of emotion.

This was something he truly believed, and he was not just saying it out of courtesy.

Ye Xuan was only a mere mystic lord realm expert, but was able to severely injure the heaven devouring divine sparrow, a supreme realm being, with a single sword strike, crossing realms!

It was absolutely unbelievable!

Situ Mo had an inexplicable intuition that given Ye Xuan’s monstrous talent, he would definitely reach the supreme realm in the future and lead the human race to glory.

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say anything about it.

When he was on the Tian Yuan continent, he had never cared for fame, let alone in the mystic world.

Moreover, he was just acting on a whim and wanted to try out the power of the second sword move of the Flora sword technique. As for whether he could defeat the heaven devouring divine sparrow and shaking up the East continent? That was not something Ye Xuan was bothered to think about.

“I don’t care about fame. I’m just doing whatever my heart tells me to.”

Ye Xuan chuckled, then his eyes fell on the great battle, and his eyes glowed with excitement.

“What I’m more curious about now is what kind of treasure is hidden in that coffin that the black tortoise is carrying. It was actually able to attract three powerful beasts with ancient bloodlines!”

Hearing this, Situ Mo was even more impressed by Ye Xuan. If he had Ye Xuan’s strength, fame was something he himself would have chased and basked in.

After all, after painstakingly cultivating to become strong, who could resist the temptation of being famous?

This feeling was simply too cool, okay? No man could resist it.

However, Ye Xuan seemed to be simply nonplussed by the whole idea. His expression remained completely calm.

Perhaps this was what a true expert was!

As for the huge coffin Ye Xuan was talking about…

Situ Mo shook his head helplessly.

“I’m not sure either. I only know that this black tortoise has been around for a few days. However, until now, no one has managed to figure out what is hidden inside.”

“However, it’s obvious that it’s something that’s extremely valuable.”

Ye Xuan nodded in agreement, and then his eyes turned to the battle again.

Boom!

As the terrifying energy waves spread out, the entire world began to tremble.

In the sky above the archaic divine mountains, the three powerful beasts released their terrifying divine powers to try and knock the coffin off the back of the black tortoise.

However, the black tortoise was so powerful that it was not at a disadvantage despite being outnumbered and surrounded.

As time slowly passed, more and more cultivators entered the archaic divine mountains, and an entire day passed just like that.

When the first wisp of purple aura rose from the east the next day, the four beasts were still locked in battle.

The surroundings had been ravaged by heavenly lightning, true fire, and demonic power. Despite this, the black tortoise remained steady and unyielding, and its power seemed to be as vast as the ocean.

“Oh my god, what’s going on here? It’s terrifying!”

The cultivators who had just reached the outskirts of the archaic divine mountains were all dumbfounded by what they saw.

Huge cracks were everywhere, and violent energy shockwaves caused the ground to tremble every few minutes. Several mountains had already been flattened and crushed.

At this moment, a few bright lights suddenly fell from the sky, which then revealed the figure of an elder covered in divine light.

“Oh my god! It’s the grand elder of the Jade Lake Divine sect!”

“What exactly is happening? Even such a powerful expert has made his way here…”

Everyone was observing the situation with bated breath. Chu Tianba’s arrival ignited the onlookers into a frenzy once again.

In a short while, a few more bright lights flashed through the sky.

“Oh my god, even Elder Tongtian is here!”

Chu Tianba greeted Elder Tongtian with a smile when he saw him.

“Hahaha! I didn’t expect that Fellow Daoist Chu would come here as well.”

A smile appeared on Elder Tongtian’s aged face.

As the grand elder of the Jade Lake Divine sect, Chu Tianba had absolute control over the Jade Lake Divine sect and was also responsible for training the Saintess.

Over the past hundred years, Chu Tianba had never left the Jade Lake Divine sect.
