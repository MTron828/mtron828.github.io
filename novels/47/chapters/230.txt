Chapter 231: Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions Technique

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Okay, Teacher.”

Zhao Yuyan nodded her head obediently, then began to seriously demonstrate the martial arts techniques that Ye Xuan had taught her.

“Mm! You’ve been working hard recently, and your control over your own strength has already reached 90%!”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled and nodded.

“However, 90% is far from enough. I’ll teach you a technique that will help you to temper your spiritual sense.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan reached out and gently touched Zhao Yuyan’s forehead.

Moments later, all of the information regarding the divine forging technique flowed into her mind.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the divine forging technique, the host has received a randomized 1,008x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique!”

“1,008 times multiplier?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was thrilled.

This little girl was truly his lucky star!

Ye Xuan immediately examined the system’s reward.

The Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique had an incredible effect on one’s spiritual sense and soul, to the point where the divine forging technique could not even be mentioned in the same sentence.

The Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique was divided into nine revolutions, which meant that it had nine levels in total, and even the first level exceeded the difficulty of cultivating the divine forging technique.

Even though Ye Xuan’s comprehension value had already reached 612 points, it was still quite difficult for him to cultivate the first level of the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique.

Of course, this did not mean that he could not cultivate, just that it would take a longer time.

Most importantly, not only could the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique strengthen a cultivator’s spiritual sense, but it also contained many soul attacks.

It was just like how Ye Xuan had used a soul attack on the cultivators of the White Moon Tower.

However, in comparison, the soul attacks of the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique were more powerful and overbearing.

In addition, if the other cultivator’s soul was not strong enough, they would not be able to detect Ye Xuan’s soul attack.

Other than that, the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique also contained a soul-searching technique, which would allow Ye Xuan to search their memories.

It was not that Ye Xuan had never used such a technique before, but his previous technique was too destructive, and often caused the enemy’s body to explode and die.

In comparison, the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique’s soul-searching technique was much gentler, and it would keep the enemy alive if necessary.

Although Ye Xuan could comprehend the first level of the Heavenly Soul Nine Revolutions technique, if he wanted to completely master the technique, he would have to further increase his comprehension value.

However, Ye Xuan was not in too much of a hurry. This could wait until he helped Li Qingyan strengthen her dual-spirit body.

He had also taken stock of his recent spoils of war, which included another withered leaf bodhi, which would allow him to experience another epiphany, as well as increase his comprehension value.

Ye Xuan was also clear that after these incidents, everyone in the Nanzhou Region was paying attention to news about him.

However, he was not afraid. After all, he could always hide inside the Tower of Heaven. Even a pattern condensation realm expert would not be able to harm him inside there.

Of course, given his personality, he preferred not to hide.

Ye Xuan then passed on the soul condensation technique to Zhao Yuyan.

Although this girl’s comprehension value was very high, her current cultivation level was still very low, so it was better for her to start with this.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan went over to Li Qingyan.

Li Qingyan was at a critical moment in her comprehension of the soul condensation technique, so Ye Xuan did not disturb her. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

About half an hour later, Li Qingyan’s eyes slowly opened.

“Teacher?”

“You’ve completely comprehended the soul condensation technique?” Ye Xuan asked.

“En!” Li Qingyan nodded excitedly.

It had taken a few days, but she had finally done it.

Ye Xuan predicted that Li Qingyan’s spiritual sense would rapidly increase in strength over the next few days, which would resolve the side effects of her rapid increase in strength.

“That’s good. I plan to help you strengthen your body as well. After that, you must diligently cultivate the soul condensation technique,” Ye Xuan said.

“En!” Li Qingyan nodded her head obediently.

She realized that as long as she stayed by her teacher’s side, her strength would continuously increase.

Ye Xuan immediately took out the red jade spirit fruit and the spirit of life and refined them for her.

Then, under Ye Xuan’s control, the red and green energy balls entered Li Qingyan’s body. His spiritual sense swept out and rapidly separated the energy balls into small clusters, helping her to refine them.

At the same time, Li Qingyan’s dual-spirit body was greedily absorbing the energy. Her strength was increasing at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.
