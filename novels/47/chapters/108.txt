Chapter 109: The Xuanyin Sect Shall Be Buried With Its Sins

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Was it the Baijin Empire?”

At the thought of this, the pupils of several elders constricted.

It was common knowledge that the Bajie Empire and the Great Qian Dynasty were mortal enemies. The conflict between the two empires was never-ending and, occasionally, a major war would break out!

Most importantly, in terms of overall strength, the Bajie Empire was stronger. The Bajie Empire’s royal family had three peak core formation realm experts.

If those three old monsters attacked together, they might actually be able to kill the patriarch without giving him the chance to escape.

However, the patriarch and the others had gone over to the Qingyun sect, so how could they encounter those old monsters from the Bajie Empire? The distance between the Qingyun sect and the borders of the Great Qian Dynasty was huge! How could they have…

Wait, could it be that the Bajie Empire had already infiltrated the Great Qian Dynasty?

Given the terrifying strength of those three old monsters, why did not they choose to destroy the Great Qian royal family instead? Why did they have to make a move against the Xuanyin sect?

All sorts of thoughts and possibilities kept running through the minds of the elders!

However, the thought of Ye Xuan being the culprit did not cross their minds even once. It made sense. After all, Ye Xuan was so young. No matter how monstrous his talent was, his actual strength was still limited. They had already filtered him out automatically.

However, even after they racked their brains for a day, they still failed to think of a reasonable possibility.

Buzz!

As these elders were panicking, terrifying spiritual pressure suddenly descended upon those in the Xuanyin sect.

It made their bodies and souls tremble uncontrollably!

The expressions of the elders changed drastically. They immediately flew over to the mountain peak.

Moments later, a young man appeared within their field of vision. A young man hovered in the air with his hands behind his back.

“Ye… Ye Xuan?”

Seeing this, everyone’s pupils shrunk.

Why would Ye Xuan appear here? Furthermore, why was the power he was exuding so terrifying? Even the patriarch’s aura had not reached such a level…

“Impossible…”

The eyes of the elders were filled with shock.

At the same time, the Xuanyin sect cultivators also spotted Ye Xuan, and a sense of unease arose in their hearts.

Faced with this terrifying pressure, they were as insignificant as ants.

They saw Ye Xuan hovering in mid-air. His God-slaying Sword was emitting a terrifying blood-red murderous aura from the seven blood-colored patterns on the sword.

Ye Xuan looked at the crowd expressionlessly and did not speak.

They were just a bunch of ants who were about to die. There was no reason to waste his time speaking to them.

“Ye… Ye Xuan, your cultivation realm…”

“How is this possible? Why is your aura so terrifying?”

The elders could not help but tremble, and they suddenly understood.

It turned out that the person who killed the patriarch, the sect leader, and the elders, was not someone from the Bajie Empire or the Great Qian Imperial family, but rather this young man in front of them.

Ye Xuan of the Qingyun sect!

How was this even possible? This power that made even the space around him ripple clearly meant that Ye Xuan had reached the peak of the core formation realm!

In fact, it seemed that Ye Xuan was much stronger than the patriarch!

Ye Xuan had reached the peak of the core formation realm, but the patriarch had also done the same. Was it actually possible that he killed the patriarch, sect leader, and the others by himself?

“You… were you the one who killed the patriarch?”

“The sect leader and the elders… did they all die at your hands?”

The Third Elder’s lips trembled as he asked this question. He already knew the answer, but he still had to ask.

He very much longed for Ye Xuan to deny this!

A young man who was only 20 years old had already reached the peak of the core formation realm. How was this possible?

His heart was currently filled with shock and helplessness!

As an elder of a top-ranked sect, he had heard of all kinds of strange things, but he had never seen anything like this. Ye Xuan was simply too monstrous!

Disregarding the Great Qian Dynasty, there might not even be a cultivator in the entire Nanzhou Region who had achieved such a feat at his age.

“That’s right. Everything was done by me. Do you find it hard to believe?”

Ye Xuan raised his eyes slightly, and said indifferently.

He suddenly changed his mind. Killing them off instantly was too merciful. Why not let them experience true despair?

“I was supposed to come looking for you guys to settle the score from back then, but I didn’t expect you guys to come looking for me first. Did you really think that an old man that took forever to reach the peak of the core formation realm and some piddling core formation cultivators are enough to take my life?”

“Like them, you are just ants in my eyes!”

As soon as he finished his words, Ye Xuan slowly reached out his hand and held the God-slaying Sword in front of him. The blood-colored patterns on the sword started emitting bright light.

Boom!

When the elders heard Ye Xuan’s words, their expressions changed drastically, and their eyes were filled with despair.

It was really Ye Xuan!

The other party had actually killed all of the top experts of the Xuanyin sect by himself!

Only the higher-ups of the sect knew that the patriarch had reached the peak of the core formation realm, and that he had taken several hundred years to do so. The fact that he was mentioning it now meant that he had definitely encountered the patriarch. This meant that…

The patriarch had fallen by Ye Xuan’s hands!

Swoosh!

Moments later, the blood-red sword qi soared into the sky and slashed toward the grand guardian array formation.

Accompanied by a series of cracking sounds, cracks appeared on the surface of the grand guardian array formation, before it shattered completely. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As the second-ranked top sect, the Xuanyin sect’s guardian array formation was not weak. It could only be shattered by a unity realm expert’s attack.

However, Ye Xuan had destroyed the grand guardian array formation with a single sword strike!

Could it be that this guy’s strength had already reached the unity realm?

At the thought of this, the elders were engulfed by despair, and the Xuanyin sect cultivators felt even more hopeless!

Now, with Ye Xuan overseeing the Qingyun sect, it was an invincible force within the Great Qian Dynasty! After the Xuanyin sect’s patriarch died, no one in the sect was capable of resisting Ye Xuan.

“Xuanyin sect! Today, you shall all disappear!”

“Be buried with your sins!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan slowly raised the God-slaying Sword. The tip of the sword released an incomparably terrifying sword qi hurricane, and the destructive spiritual pressure of a peak core formation realm expert also swept out.
