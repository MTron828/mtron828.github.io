797 Saved By A Little Girl

“Junior Brother Li, shut up!”

Ao Lei’s expression changed drastically and he hurriedly stopped Li Dahai.

Ye Xuan had already spent a lot of effort to stabilize the situation, but what did he do instead?

Was his head stuck in a door?

Even Gao Shun did not dare to provoke this great demoness at this critical moment.

What was Li Dahai thinking? He actually cursed in such a situation.

F*cking hell!

The same thought appeared in everyone’s minds at the same time. The atmosphere seemed to have become unprecedentedly solemn, and it almost felt as if the temperature had begun to drop rapidly.

Mengyu looked coldly at them, and everyone felt as if the Grim Reaper was waving at them, beckoning them toward the netherworld.

“Sure, you want to settle old scores with me, right? Since that’s the case, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Mengyu waved her hand, and the huge skeleton underneath her unleashed a terrifying red light.

“Oh no!”

Seeing the red light that filled the sky, everyone felt waves of panic assail their hearts. It seemed that Mengyu did not even need to act personally.

Without Ye Xuan and Daoist Yi Feng to stop her, this skeleton might be enough to deal with everyone present.

Since things had developed to this point, and there was no way to salvage the situation, Ao Lei waved his right hand, and a sharp sword that emitted seven-colored light appeared.

This sword was the treasured sword of the sect, the Great Wilderness Sword!

“Everyone, get into formation!”

After hearing this order, all of the chiefs immediately took action and took out their weapons without hesitation. Zhuge Yueyue also took out her Cloud Sky Sword.

In the blink of an eye, seven beams of divine light of different colors emerged from every mountain peak of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and were infused into the seven swords.

Soon, a huge formation was erected. Ao Lei was at the center of the formation, and with a wave of his hand, he released waves of extremely terrifying power.

“Great Wilderness Sword Formation?”

Mengyu recalled the name of this formation. After all, she had a deep impression of it, as it had been used against her a hundred years ago.

However, to Mengyu, this was meaningless.

“Go deal with it.”

The huge skeleton began to make its way over to Sky Mountain, leaving her hovering in the air quietly. She would let it test their strength.

After receiving Mengyu’s order, the huge skeleton roared, causing a strong wind to blow in all directions. Its terrifying aura swept out.

“Stop it!”

Seeing this, Ao Lei charged forward without hesitation.

Boom!

A huge explosion erupted, and the surroundings shook and trembled.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically. There were even a number of cultivators who were severely injured by the shockwaves.

Zhuge Yueyue spat out a mouthful of blood. Her current cultivation level was lacking in comparison to the other chiefs. Therefore, the skeleton had identified her as the weak point of the formation, and the majority of its power had been directed toward her.

“First Sister!”

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue’s pale face and that she was spitting out blood, Xiang Yun, who had just returned, instantly shouted worriedly.

“You bunch of scoundrels, I’ll definitely kill you!”

Xiang Yun picked up her potato hammer without hesitation and suddenly released an extremely powerful aura. The seal on her forehead also released dazzling divine light, which caused the skeleton that was about to launch an attack to tremble and draw back.

“Oh no, her seal is about to be broken!”

Looking at this scene, Feng Xiyun was at a loss as to what to do.

She could clearly sense that the power that her teacher used to reinforce the seal in Xiang Yun’s body was almost gone. If this continued, the seal would soon break.

In a panic, Feng Xiyun gritted her teeth and stared daggers at Su Changhe, giving him a huge fright.

“Oh my god! This has nothing to do with me!”

“She insisted on coming to find you two after she woke up. I wasn’t strong enough to stop her,” Su Changhe said helplessly.

He did not want to bring the little girl here, but he could not persuade her at all.

“Do you see the two black marks around my eyes? I’ve already tried my best!”

Feng Xiyun did not pay much attention to him at this time. She immediately rushed over to Xiang Yun’s side and grabbed her small hand tightly.

Even though this third sister of theirs was often mischievous, they still cared for her very much.

When she found out that if the seal was removed in advance, their third sister might no longer be the same, both she and Zhuge Yueyue were on the lookout to prevent Xiang Yun’s emotional outbursts.

After sensing this extremely terrifying aura, even Mengyu felt a sense of dread arise in her heart. It seemed that if this little girl’s seal was undone, she would probably die here. Before she reincarnated, this little girl’s combat strength was probably far greater than her own.

Thinking this, Mengyu could only say, “Come back!”

The huge skeleton was a little confused. It had not killed anyone, yet this little girl seemed to be ready to fight it to the death.

Furthermore, it sensed a life-threatening crisis. Confused and afraid, it immediately returned to Mengyu’s side, and allowed her to stand on its head again.

Mengyu also noticed that something was amiss.

“Interesting. Her strength fluctuates based on her emotions…”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
