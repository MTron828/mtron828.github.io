478 Lesson Time

‘This guy really didn’t know what was good for him. He actually dared to shout at us despite Chief Ye Xuan being here. Hmph! It was time to teach him a lesson!’

Su Changhe took a step forward with a disdainful smile.

“Eh, country bumpkin, where did you come from? How dare you act so arrogantly in front of me?”

Bei Xuantian could not help but raise his saber when he noticed Su Changhe’s disdainful expression.

!!

If they were in the Haihan divine empire, anyone who spoke so disrespectfully to him would have been executed.

Ever since he was young, other than his elder brother, no one had ever dared to be so arrogant in front of him.

“You’re really arrogant!”

“I am the second prince of the Haihan divine empire, Bei Xuantian! Know your place, peasant! Are you prepared to die?”

He thought that Su Changhe would be terrified after he revealed his identity.

However, much to Bei Xuantian’s confusion, Su Changhe burst out laughing.

“Hehe! I thought it was some noble prince, but it turned out to be the second prince of the Haihan divine empire… A mere second prince… Even the crown prince wouldn’t dare to speak to me in such a manner when visiting the Yangli divine empire!”

“Put away your royal pride. This isn’t the Haihan divine empire’s territory,” Su Changhe said with a cold smile.

He had initially been shocked that Bei Xuantian was a prince. However, once he learnt that the latter was only the second prince, he immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Even if Bei Xuantian was the second prince of the Haihan divine empire, he could not be so arrogant in another empire’s territory.

“Xuantian, don’t be so angry. We’re here representing the Haihan divine empire to seek a marriage alliance. Don’t get into a conflict with the major families of the Yangli divine empire.”

The black-robed old man reminded him, but his eyes were fixed on the white figure behind Su Changhe.

He had an inexplicable intuition that this person’s strength was extremely terrifying!

For a mystic lord realm expert to feel this way, it could only mean that the other party’s strength far exceeded his.

Although the white-clad young man was only standing on the peak of the mountain, his aura was strange and suffocating.

The black-robed elder was very surprised. Were the experts of the Yangli divine empire so terrifying?

How could the guardian of an aristocratic son be so powerful?

Hearing this, Bei Xuantian suppressed the anger in his heart and said with a cold look.

“Very well, I’ll remember you!”

“If you have the guts, tell me your name!”

“Hehe! You call yourself the second prince of the Haihan divine empire, but aren’t you just a coward? This young master will never change his name. It’s Su Changhe!”

Bei Xuantian could not restrain himself after hearing Su Changhe call him a coward. His eyes were filled with rage as the saber in his hand released sharp saber qi. The terrifying power of an eighth-level materialization realm expert erupted. He was about to attack Su Change.

At this moment, sword intent filled with destructive power shot up into the sky and instantly locked onto him.

In that instant, Bei Xuantian’s body suddenly trembled, and his eyes suddenly became listless.

In those few seconds, he felt like he had fallen into the depths of hell!

When he came back to his senses, his body trembled uncontrollably and his face turned extremely pale. The saber in his hand clattered to the ground.

Still trembling, he glanced at the white figure standing behind Su Changhe.

The white-robed young man seemed completely indifferent. However, it also seemed that the entire situation was under his control.

At this moment, Bei Xuantian finally understood why Su Changhe dared to be so arrogant.

“A peak-level mystic lord realm expert!”

The black-robed old man’s eyes narrowed.

Bei Xuantian’s body trembled even more when he heard this.

“What…? That person… That person is actually a peak-level mystic lord realm expert?!”

This was simply too f*cking ridiculous!

They had just reached the territory of the Yangli divine empire, and had somehow already encountered a peak-level mystic lord realm expert? Were such experts so commonplace in the Yangli divine empire?

Bei Xuantian’s eyes were filled with disbelief, and his body trembled uncontrollably.

The reason why he was not worried about his safety on the journey here was due to the presence of the black-robed elder, Bei Moyan.

However, even Bei Moyan had a look of fear on his face.

Bei Xuantian was not a fool. He naturally could understand the situation.

The expert at the peak of the mountain was definitely not an existence he could afford to offend.

His father had been right. There were many experts in the Yangli divine empire, which was why he had been specifically instructed to keep a low profile when he went to the territory of the Yangli divine empire.

He had not thought much of his father’s advice, but it seemed that his ignorance had come back to bite him.

“Uncle Moyan, what should we do now?” Bei Xuantian asked nervously.

He had attacked Su Changhe because he could not control his anger.

Moreover, he also sensed a trace of killing intent within the sword intent. This matter was obviously not easy to resolve.

Hearing this, Bei Moyan looked helplessly at Bei Xuantian, somewhat disappointedly.

This kid was too impulsive.

However, now that the situation had come to this, he had to discard his dignity.

Bei Moyan squeezed out a smile as he spoke to Ye Xuan, “I am Prince Bei Moyan. How should I address you? Which sect do you hail from?”

However, after Bei Moyan said this, he did not receive any response.

...

When Bei Xuantian saw this, he was a little displeased.

Although the experts of the Yangli divine empire were powerful, there was no need for them to be so rude, right?

However, due to the other party’s terrifying strength, they did not dare to show any hint of dissatisfaction on the surface.

Just like that, the atmosphere became strangely awkward.

Suddenly, a golden jade carriage appeared.

“Mm, it’s the carriage of the Yangli divine dynasty’s royal family…”

Su Changhe was surprised to see that.

As a disciple of a major family of the Yangli divine empire, he was naturally familiar with the royal family’s carriages. They were not hard to identify anyway, as they had the crest of the royal family.

Back then, when Feng Xiyun had escaped from the palace, the carriage she rode on was similar.

It was also because of the crest on the carriage that Feng Xiyun was able to travel unimpeded and had not encountered any great dangers.

Very quickly, the luxurious carriage arrived in front of Bei Xuantian and the others. A handsome man in luxurious attire stepped out of the carriage.

The man’s gaze was gentle, but he exuded a sense of majesty and authority.
