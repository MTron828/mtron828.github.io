631 Vanishing Shadow

The moment the photinia grass was added to the solution, a terrifying amount of spiritual energy swept out, which was quickly suppressed by Ye Xuan.

Even though the solution was boiling at this point, he did not hesitate to enter the cauldron, and waves of energy were transmitted and absorbed into his body.

The next morning, Ye Xuan slowly opened his eyes, and an extremely terrifying aura instantly swept out.

‘I’ve finally broken through to the heaven realm!’

His prediction had been correct. The addition of the photinia grass was enough to fuel his breakthrough to the heaven realm. Now, he had to find and obtain even more precious herbs to continue advancing his body refining cultivation.

That being said, Ye Xuan still had not used the chaos immortal peach yet.

Ye Xuan slowly climbed out of the cauldron, activated his spiritual power, and instantly dried his clothes.

After doing all this, Ye Xuan went over to the water cloud fruit tree and crushed some of the herbs that were not useful to him, then sprinkled the liquid over it.

Moments later, a dazzling light radiated from the tree, and the spiritual energy of the entire cloud sky peak became denser.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun, who were still immersed in their cultivation, also noticed this and they rushed out at the same time.

After seeing that it was Ye Xuan, they immediately greeted him.

“Good morning, Teacher.”

After saying this, Zhuge Yueyue immediately went to wake Xiang Yun up. The three of them stood in front of Ye Xuan and waited quietly for his instructions.

Ye Xuan looked at Feng Xiyun at this moment, and then a smile appeared on his face.

“You’ve actually broken through to the void realm. Very good…”

She had indeed made good use of the precious bone he had given her.

However, once the remaining power within the precious bone was exhausted, her cultivation speed would slow down.

“Xiyun…”

“Yes, Teacher?”

Ye Xuan calmly took out an ancient book from his spatial pouch and handed it over to Feng Xiyun.

“I said before that I would teach you the method to use the Godsaber, so I’ll give it to you now.”

“This ancient book was obtained by Chief Tian Xuan in a secret realm. It’s a heaven-grade divine power, and its name is ‘vanishing shadow.’”

“Once you master this divine power, you will be able to instantly appear in front of your enemies and take their heads.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“With the assistance of the powerful flames you can ignite, your attack power will be terrifying. I’m afraid that even your senior sister won’t be able to take the attack head-on.”

“If you want to master this divine power, you have to properly comprehend the power of space, which is not an easy thing. It’s also the reason I didn’t teach it to you before the void realm.”

After hearing these words, Feng Xiyun excitedly received and flipped through the ancient book. Even a casual glance through its contents was enough to tell her that this divine power was extraordinary.

“Thanks, Teacher. You’re the best!”

“Alright, there’s no need to be so excited. After all, it’s not easy to master this divine power.”

“Work hard. There are less than 30 days left before the gathering. Perhaps the divine power will come in useful at that time,” Ye Xuan said while rubbing Feng Xiyun’s head.

When Chief Tian Xuan left, he left Ye Xuan with many treasures and techniques.

However, at that time, Ye Xuan was pretty useless as a cultivator, so he could not make good use of them.

Thankfully, he now had three disciples of his own, so they could finally be put to use.

It would also allow Ye Xuan to earn even more usable items from the system.

“Alright, Teacher. I’ll definitely cultivate seriously and won’t let you down,” Feng Xiyun said confidently.

Her heart was already blooming with joy.

Even though she did not like to fight, she also wanted to become stronger.

She wanted to become stronger so that she could protect the people she cared about instead of being protected every time.

Now, she even had a junior sister. Usually, her senior sister would protect her, so now, it was time for her to protect her junior sister.

“Teacher, can you also teach me a powerful divine power?”

Seeing that her senior sister could actually learn such a powerful technique, Xiang Yun also did not want to be left behind and hugged Ye Xuan’s thigh.

Looking at her hopeful and pitiful eyes, Ye Xuan felt a little embarrassed and said, “Cough, cough, Yun’er, it’s not that I don’t want to teach you these techniques.”

“It’s just that… You don’t even know how to read, so how can you learn a divine power like this?”

“If you really want to learn a powerful divine power, you should learn how to read first. I’ll definitely teach you then. How about it?
