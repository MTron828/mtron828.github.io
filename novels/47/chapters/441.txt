442 Coward!

When Gao Tianyu heard this, he could not help it. The spiritual power in his body swept out wildly.

At this moment, an extremely cold aura suddenly descended from the sky. It enveloped Gao Tianyu’s body and soul, causing him to shiver.

The anger in his heart was immediately extinguished.

“How is this possible? I actually felt fear…” Gao Tianyu looked at Zhuge Yueyue, who was beside him. His eyes were full of fear.

It had to be known that among the younger generation of cultivators in the entire Great Wilderness Divine sect, he had never been afraid of anyone except Hua Rufeng.

However, at that moment just now, he was extremely clear that if he had really made a move, he would have been the one to die…

Zhuge Yueyue had only joined the sect a few months ago. It was impossible for her to possess such power. Had he been mistaken?

Gao Tianyu looked at Zhuge Yueyue deeply and suppressed the absurd thoughts in his heart.

He was very close to the ninth level of the materialization realm. The reason why he did not break through was because he had deliberately suppressed his cultivation.

After all, the reason why he had broken through so quickly during this period of time was because he had consumed countless heavenly treasures to forcibly raise his cultivation level.

His goal was simple. He wanted to crush Cloud Sky in the competition.

Therefore, although Gao Tianyu was only a fourth-level materialization realm cultivation on the surface, his actual combat strength had already reached the eighth level of the materialization realm.

Even so, in that instant just now, he had actually sensed a fatal threat from Zhuge Yueyue.

Her aura was so cold that it made his soul tremble.

What was going on? Could it be that her strength exceeds mine?

Impossible!

Gao Tianyu shook his head, his eyes full of disbelief.

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue, he was not only the chief disciple of Hidden Sword peak, but also Gao Shun’s son. He had access to countless cultivation resources.

Even so, it took Gao Tianyu five or six years to reach this level.

How could someone who had just joined the sect three months ago surpass him in terms of cultivation?

Even Xiao Feng, who had been tested to have divine bones in the meeting hall, had only reached the second level of the divine mystic realm.

Thinking this, Gao Tianyu breathed a sigh of relief. Such a thing was impossible.

Before the Seven Peaks competition started, he did not want to expose his strength because of these rookies. After all, his goal was to become the champion of the competition.

Moreover, it was meaningless even if he could defeat Feng Xiyun and the others now. It was far better and more meaningful to do so during the competition.

At that time, he would definitely let everyone know that Hidden Sword peak and that he, Gao Tianyu, was the well-deserved champion.

“Hmph! Show off while you can. When the competition starts, I’ll teach you a proper lesson!”

“You should pray that you don’t encounter me.”

Gao Tianyu looked at Su Changhe and the others coldly, then turned around and left.

At this moment, a mocking voice was heard.

“This is really funny. He’s just a coward, yet he dares to spout such harsh words!”

When Feng Xiyun heard this, she could not help but laugh.

Even Zhuge Yueyue, who had always been cold and aloof, chuckled when she heard Su Changhe’s words.

Gao Tianyu’s face was as black as ink. He wanted to run over and strangle Su Changhe!

Detestable! This guy actually called me a coward!

Is he daring me to kill him?

Gao Tianyu’s eyes were filled with rage and his body trembled.

However, when he thought of his father’s instructions, he forcibly suppressed the anger in his heart.

“No… This guy is deliberately goading me. I can’t be fooled…”

When Gao Tianyu left, he was gritting and grinding his teeth.

As for the cultivators of Hidden Sword peak, they naturally could not stand staying around to be humiliated by Su Changhe, so they quickly followed Gao Tianyu and left.

After Gao Tianyu and the others left, Feng Xiyun came over to Su Changhe and patted him on the shoulder.

“Young Master Su’s performance just now was very good. Keep it up!”

“Hehe, it was all thanks to Sister Xiyun’s teachings. I won’t brag, but although I’m not good at fighting, when it comes to quarreling, if I’m second, no one would dare to claim to be first!”

“Even if all of those wimps had ganged up on me, I would have been able to win any argument with them,” Su Changhe grinned and said with confidence.

Everyone’s mouths twitched when they heard this, and they consciously kept their distance from Su Changhe.

Who the f*ck would dare to provoke this guy in the future?

His mouth was so toxic!

After a while, Hua Rufeng walked out of the meeting hall.

The noisy square suddenly quieted down, and everyone’s eyes fell on Hua Rufeng.

“Fellow junior brothers and sisters, the Seven Peaks competition is about to begin. Please head to the martial arts field,” Hua Rufeng said in a clear voice. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Then, he took the lead and walked toward the martial arts field.

The martial arts field was also located in the square. It was where the cultivators of the sect usually practiced their combat techniques and sparred.

Everyone quickly followed Hua Rufeng.

When they arrived at the martial arts field, they found that the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were already waiting there.

...

However, Cloud Sky peak stood out. Compared to the cultivators from the other peaks, of which there were dozens, if not hundreds, Cloud Sky peak only had three. Furthermore, only two were actual disciples.
