820 Arrival

Zhuge Yueyue actually did not want to be the chief of Cloud Sky peak. What she wanted most was to be Ye Xuan’s faithful disciple. It was enough if she could stay by her teacher’s side.

“Thanks Teacher. You’re always very good to me.”

Zhuge Yueyue smiled delightedly. Her usual cold expression seemed to have disappeared at this moment.

“Alright, even though you won’t accept disciples, you still have to go through the process. Go over first and join the others. After all, you’re already the chief of Cloud Sky peak,” Ye Xuan reminded her.

She was already the chief…

Since everyone had already accepted her appointment, it was somewhat unreasonable for her to stay here and chat.

“Okay, Teacher, I’ll be leaving first.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Zhuge Yueyue hurried toward the Cloud Sky peak, not daring to delay for even a moment.

After watching Zhuge Yueyue leave, Ye Xuan looked around and disappeared with a swoosh.

Now that one continent had collided with the East Continent, the other continents would soon collide with each other.

Ye Xuan actually did not know how the situation would develop in the future.

Moreover, he had already reached the sealed immortal realm. If he continued to cultivate, the next step would be the eternal realm.

Given the situation in the East continent, it was impossible for Ye Xuan to step into the eternal realm.

After all, the laws of the world in the East continent were incomplete. No one could cultivate to this level.

However, once the eight continents had been unified, the laws of the world would become complete once again, and the mighty experts left behind from ancient times would probably gradually appear.

An unprecedented battle would soon take place. As for which race would emerge victorious, no one knew.

After leaving the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Ye Xuan went straight to the East Sea to await the arrival of the little monkey.

There was a great connection between this little monkey and Ye Xuan. If it passed through the many difficulties Ye Xuan had prepared and made it to the Seven-Star Cave Abode, it meant that the little monkey might not be the harbinger of a disaster.

At this moment, on the vast East Sea, a little monkey was rowing a small boat, constantly moving forward and searching.

Wave after wave crashed onto the little boat. There were also many ferocious beasts in the sea, and they would occasionally jump out to ambush the little monkey.

The little furry monkey looked very miserable at this moment. However, it still gritted its teeth and persevered, not giving up hope.

Before it set off, it had already sworn an oath that he would learn to be powerful and come back to protect its companions.

Under the encouragement of all of the other little monkeys, it only brought the necessities before leaving. It encountered many difficulties on the way and even ended up building a small boat to search the sea.

Its hard work paid off. After a long time, it finally saw the island it had been searching for.

Surrounded by the sea, there was a mountain peak on the island that released waves of warm aura, giving those who saw it the feeling that an immortal resided here. It was very shocking.

“I finally found the place. The Seven-Star Cave Abode must be on this island!”

The moment it discovered the island, the little monkey jumped up in joy, and promptly fell into the sea.

Fortunately, it reached quickly enough to grab the side of the small wooden boat, and thus escaped the fate of being drifting away.

At this moment, inside the Seven-Star Cave Abode, Ye Xuan had already transformed into an old man in a Daoist robe with a head full of white hair, quietly waiting for the arrival of the little monkey.

After a while, the little monkey, whose fur was all wet, dragged its wooden boat on the shore and then skipped toward the Seven-Star Cave Abode.

It climbed up the mountain peak and arrived in front of the cave abode. However, when it saw the majestic words at the entrance of the cave, it was dumbfounded.

“What are these characters?”

Indeed, this little furry monkey did not know how to read either.

It was exactly the same as Xiang Yun. Once Ye Xuan realized this problem, he felt instant regret.

Did he have to go through the same thing again?

Just Xiang Yun alone was enough to make people worry. Now, there was this little monkey. What troubles would it cause him in the future?

“Who are you?”

After hearing this voice, the little monkey was shocked. It was as if this voice was echoing in its heart!

Therefore, it concluded without hesitation that the person in the cave must be an expert.

“Who dares to disturb my cultivation?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hearing this, the little monkey was scared silly and immediately knelt down and said in a panic, “Daoist, I heard that in this Seven-Star Cave Abode, there is an expert who lives in seclusion to cultivate. That’s why I crossed the mountains and seas, traveled hundreds of thousands of miles, and experienced many difficulties to come here. I want to learn a cultivation technique.”

“I hope you can take me as your disciple and teach me your cultivation technique.”

“Is that so?”

Hearing this, the little monkey raised its head to take a look, and realized that an old man had suddenly appeared in front of it.

“Little monkey, you’ve got guts. The road here is filled with all kinds of dangers? If you’re not careful, you’ll lose your life? Why did you lie to me?”

Ye Xuan’s words frightened the little monkey so much that its entire body trembled as it spoke in a trembling voice, “I would never lie to you. If there is even the slightest bit of falsehood in my words, I will let you punish me.”

Seeing his frightened appearance, Ye Xuan chuckled inwardly.

This little monkey had an impatient personality, so he had to make him fear him. Otherwise, he would not be able to teach him in the future.

“Alright.”

“Seeing that you want to learn, I’ll ask you properly first.”

After saying this, Ye Xuan’s gaze was fixed on the little furry monkey, causing its entire body to feel uneasy.

“Daoist, please ask.”

“Why do you want to learn from me?”

Hearing this, the little furry monkey was stunned. After a moment, it replied, “I was originally a monkey king, but there was a big monster in my territory that would come from time to time to cause trouble, and also killed many monkeys.”

“It’s precisely because of this that I want to learn a cultivation technique so that I can protect my fellow monkeys well in the future.”

The little furry monkey said these words with a sincere expression, which made Ye Xuan a little happy…
