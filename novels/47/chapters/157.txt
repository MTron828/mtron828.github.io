Chapter 158: Sword Orchid Valley Lord

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Before his death, the monk’s heart was filled with unwillingness and resentment.

Although Yunjin Temple would definitely find out how he and the other monk died, it did not matter to him at the moment. After all, he would be dead.

Yunjin Temple had also gained a powerful enemy. Now that Ye Xuan was aware of Yunjin Temple, he would naturally stay vigilant. It would be difficult to kill then.

Furthermore, if they could not kill this peerless genius, Yunjin Temple would definitely suffer a great calamity in the future.

Still, he would not live to see that future. When the fist landed, his body and soul were instantly torn apart.

Even the divine elements in his body were turned into ashes.

Then, Ye Xuan reached out his hand in the direction where the monk had fallen, following which five streaks of light burst forth and landed in Ye Xuan’s palm.

These were the monk’s Buddhist beads.

Originally, the monk had a total of fourteen Buddhist beads in his hand, but now there were only five left.

Among the remaining five Buddha beads, one contained a powerful attack, two contained extremely strong defensive power, and the other could increase the speed of the cultivator.

The final one actually contained storage space.

Ye Xuan used his spiritual sense and slowly examined that Buddhist bead.

As expected of a unity realm expert. He was indeed very rich. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Whether it was cultivation methods, martial techniques, or pills, it could be said that he had everything.

However, most of them were quite average in terms of quality. Other than a few third-grade pills, the rest were basically first-grade and second-grade pills.

As for martial techniques and cultivation methods, most of them were middle-grade black-rank, and there were even yellow-rank cultivation methods among them.

Ye Xuan did not find any Earth-rank martial techniques or cultivation methods inside.

The Vajra Demon Subjugation Body that the monk cultivated was not there either. That cultivation method was likely passed down via spiritual sense and stored in the monk’s sea of consciousness.

As for artifacts, needless to say, they were mostly low-grade and middle-grade artifacts.

Therefore, although this guy’s possessions were plentiful, they were lacking in quality.

Of course, this was only in comparison to Ye Xuan. Within the Great Qian dynasty, the monk’s possessions were already comparable to the resources of a sect.

However, to Ye Xuan’s surprise, there was a rare spiritual object in the Buddhist bead. It was a transparent and shining orchid.

The orchid was not an ordinary spiritual object. It was a Sword Orchid Valley Lord. Its leaves were like swords, and it was an extremely rare natural treasure that was used to increase a cultivator’s comprehension of their Sword Dao physique.

Therefore, to Ye Xuan, the Sword Orchid Valley Lord was even more precious than the Buddha Spirit fruit.

He would be able to use and refine it to strengthen his Sword Overload Body!

“Not bad! Obtaining such a precious thing made my efforts worthwhile.”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

Compared to the spirit moon fruit tree, this treasure was a hundred times better. On a side note, Ye Xuan realized that the cultivation methods and pills were useless to him.

After all, the monk was a Buddhist Cultivator. The heavenly treasures in the Buddhist bead were naturally more suitable for Buddhist cultivators!

“I can give this Sword Orchid Valley Lord to Yue as a gift, and obtain a better reward from the system.”

“If I help her refine it as well, the system’s reward should also enhance my Sword Overlord physique to a certain extent.

“Perhaps after those two enhancements, my Sword Overlord body might even reach the mastery realm!”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

Then, with a wave of his sleeve, he turned into a streak of light and disappeared.

At the same time, Yue had also found Huang Ling, and saw Zhao Yuyan beside the latter.

After a brief exchange, Yue learned that Zhao Yuyan was a new disciple that her teacher had just taken in, and she also learned about the little girl’s sad plight.
