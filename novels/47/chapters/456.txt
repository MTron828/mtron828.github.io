457 Feng Xiyun vs Li Hanyi

“Yes, Teacher.”

Feng Xiyun stuck out her tongue. She felt a little wronged.

Could it be that in Teacher’s eyes, she was no match for Senior Sister Li Hanyi?

However, after thinking about it carefully, it made sense. After all, Li Hanyi was a seventh-level materialization cultivator, while she was only a first-level materialization realm cultivator.

Even the heaven-grade divine power would not be able to bridge that gap.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw this, she hurriedly went up to comfort Feng Xiyun. Only then did Feng Xiyun feel much better.

Soon, they arrived at the arenas.

Gongsun Shouyue, Elder Tongtian, Gao Shun, and the others had already taken their seats, including Yuelun.

“Junior Brother Ye, why haven’t I seen you these past few days? You didn’t even watch your own disciples’ matches…”

Seeing Ye Xuan appear, Yuelun’s expression brightened as she asked softly.”

“I’ve been cultivating over these past few days, so I didn’t have time to come and watch these girls compete… Did Senior Sister miss me?” Ye Xuan asked, a smirk on his face.

“Are you kidding me? How could I miss you? You’re daydreaming!”

Yuelun rolled her eyes. However, she then secretly snuck a glance at Ye Xuan, and was overcome by shock.

‘Such a vast and majestic aura … Could it be that Junior Brother Ye has already broken through to the peak of the mystic lord realm?’

Although she could not sense his exact cultivation level, the aura he exuded was enough to tell that he had become stronger than he was a few days ago.

He seemed to be no weaker than Gongsun Shouyue.

How could this guy break through so fast?

Was she really unable to catch up to his pace?

At the thought of this, Yuelun’s eyes dimmed.

Sure enough, things were developing in the direction she had initially predicted. Perhaps in the near future, she would be left far behind him.

“Junior Brother Ye, I heard that you made Senior Brother Gao vomit blood.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Look at Senior Brother Gao. He’s surprisingly quiet, and he didn’t come over to provoke you.”

Yuelun glanced at Gao Shun, who was not far away, and then said softly.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was also a little curious, but he was more confused.

“This old fellow is being so quiet. Could it be that he’s cooked up some sort of scheme to mess with me?”

“It’s hard to say, but in any case, be careful. Don’t make a huge mistake in front of Senior Brother Gao.”

Yuelun was amused by the conflict between the two of them. She did not know if Gao Shun would dare to completely fall out with Ye Xuan. After all, Ye Xuan was very powerful now.

Ye Xuan shrugged his shoulders indifferently.

In the face of absolute power, all schemes and petty plans were futile.

With his current strength, even ten Gao Shuns would be no match for him. He would not even need to use the Flora Sword technique.

After a while, the Seven Peaks competition commenced again..

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Feng Xiyun, “Go, Xiyun!”

“En!” Feng Xiyun obediently nodded her head and then walked toward the arena.

Having just cultivated for over a month, Feng Xiyun was already very satisfied that she could advance to the top eight of the Seven Peaks competition. After all, among the remaining participants, she was the weakest.

“Senior Sister Li Hanyi, please enlighten me!”

Atop the arena, Li Hanyi, who was dressed in black, stood with an indifferent gaze. She looked different from her usual gentle image.

At this moment, Li Hanyi looked more valiant and heroic!

Feng Xiyun was wearing a sky-blue long robe. A faint smile hung on the corners of her mouth.

Li Hanyi nodded.

Although Feng Xiyun was only a first-level materialization realm cultivator, she did not dare to be careless when facing a disciple of Cloud Sky peak.

Furthermore, she was the only one from Water Sky peak who had made it to the top eight. If she lost to someone who was six minor realms weaker than she was, Yuelun would probably lose her mind.

Then, the battle began.

Facing the powerful Li Hanyi, Feng Xiyun did not dare to hold back at all, and activated the Hellfire technique, bursting forth with power. She fused it with the gentle power of the Sky River palm and attacked.

The waves formed by the flaming palm came from all directions and swept toward Li Hanyi, whose sword suddenly trembled. Sharp sword qi surged out, turning a torrent of sword strikes that slashed toward the flaming waves.

Although there was a certain gap between the two of them in terms of cultivation level, it felt like they were evenly matched. The battle situation could be said to be extremely intense.

When Yuelun saw this, her expression instantly turned nervous.

‘My precious disciple, you’re making me anxious. You’re the last hope of Water Sky peak. You must not lose to Feng Xiyun!’

Compared to Yuelun, Ye Xuan’s expression was relatively calm.

From the moment the two of them began to fight, Ye Xuan had already known.

With Feng Xiyun’s strength, it was impossible for her to defeat Li Hanyi. The outcome had already been decided, so why should he care so much?

Ye Xuan raised his head and looked at Gongsun Shouyue, who was not far away, and narrowed his eyes.

He saw Hua Rufeng running over in a hurry, as if he was reporting something to Gongsun Shouyue.

The next second, Gongsun Shouyue, who had been smiling, suddenly frowned and his expression turned serious.
