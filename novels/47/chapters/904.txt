905 Protecting The Disciples

Shan Ling knew its own limits, so it didn’t dare to provoke these old monsters of the Heavenly Dao World’s Great Wilderness Divine sect. Some of them had disappeared for ages, but who knew if they would suddenly show up.

After taking a deep breath, Shan Ling turned his glance away from Yanran. Although he did not dare to kill the Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!

His gaze shifted to Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun as he said with a cold expression, “This time, I can let your Saintess go, but those two girls have also killed my descendants, and therefore, I will take them away.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun’s hearts skipped a beat. However, they did not say anything, and simply looked at Yanran.

Yanran simply smiled at them reassuringly. Moments later, she erupted with intense seven-colored divine light as she spoke.

“As long as I’m here, no one can dream of touching my two disciples!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This…”

Hearing this, everyone’s pupils shrank in shock. Even Ou Yunhai could not remain calm.

“Yanran, are you stupid? You only just met these two people. Is it necessary for you to risk your life for them?” Ou Yunhai asked with a terrified expression.

After all, he could clearly sense how terrifying Shan Ling was. He did not have the slightest confidence in his ability to resist the high ancestor. Hell, he did not even have the guts to speak loudly in front of this person.

Hearing this, Yanran glanced at him coldly, her eyes full of disgust.

“You coward, hurry up and hide.”

After hearing Yanran’s words, Ou Yunhai’s face immediately turned pale, and a deep sense of self-mockery arose in his heart.

He could be considered a top genius, but in front of an old monster like the high ancestor, he could not even muster up the courage to stand by the side of someone he professed he loved.

Did his current self really have the ability to fight Ye Xuan?

When Ye Xuan was dealing with opponents that were stronger than him, he had never shown any signs of fear, and had even risen to the occasion and defeated them.

This was how he became famous in the eight continents, which was why the discussions and limelight always centered around Sword Immortal Ye, and not Saint Ou Yunhai.

He had clearly sensed the disdain in Yanran’s eyes just now. At this moment, he finally understood that he might not have any chance of getting Yanran back.

On the other side, after Yanran finished scolding Ou Yunhai, she stared at Shan Ling coldly and said, “Old freak, as long as I’m alive, don’t even think about hurting my two disciples.”

This sparked endless fury in Shan Ling’s heart, and he said in exasperation, “Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, have you thought it through? In order to protect these two little girls, you are actually going to have both our factions descend into conflict?”

“Enough of your useless sophistry! Our Great Wilderness Divine sect has never been afraid of anyone. No matter how powerful you are, if you want to start a war, just go ahead,” Yanran said domineeringly without any intention of backing down.

Hearing her words, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were very touched. It was as if they had found their spiritual pillar. Their teacher’s wife was really willing to risk her life to protect them.

At this moment, Yanran had already occupied the role of Ye Xuan’s wife in their hearts, and they would not even allow Ye Xuan to get in the way of that.

On the other hand, after hearing Yanran’s words, Shan Ling’s hair stood on end.

“Hahaha! Fine! Have it your way! Since your sect wants a fight, then let’s have one! Do you really think that I’m afraid of those old monsters? Hell no!”

Shan Ling no longer had any hesitations. His pride had been insulted enough today, so he would teach them the consequences of angering him, even if he ended up offending those old monsters.

Moments later, Shan Ling roared angrily, and the entire East Sea began to churn with red waves!

Shan Ling’s body began to expand, and as it did, so did his oppressive aura. Sensing this, Yanran began to panic.

This was her first time fighting against such a powerful enemy, so she did not know what to do. Thus, she resorted to what she was best at, and unleashed the Great Desolate technique at full power.

Once the two of them started to fight, the entire East continent began to shake violently, causing all the creatures in the outside world to be terrified.

“Oh my god, this is simply a fight between gods. As mere mortals, if we were to be caught up in such a huge battle, we would probably die instantly.”

At this moment, everyone began to retreat, leaving a wide open space for Yanran and Shan Ling to fight. However, despite the power of the Great Desolate technique, it could not penetrate Shan Ling’s defenses.

Seeing this, Shan Ling said disdainfully, “Hmph! How dare you even dream of fighting me! Today, you will learn just how inferior you are. If you weren’t the Saintess of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, you would definitely die today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Shan Ling unleashed a bolt of red divine lightning, shattering Yanran’s attack. Then, he condensed a cage of lightning to try and trap her inside.

Seeing this, Yanran did her best to attack it…
