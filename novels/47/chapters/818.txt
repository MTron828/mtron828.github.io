819 Collision Of Continents

The only time when the Sword Elder was called upon was when the sect was in danger.

Just like his teacher, Tian Xuan, who also once took up the position of Sword Elder, Ye Xuan could be considered to have inherited his teacher’s position.

Would Zhuge Yueyue also follow in his footsteps? He did not know, but he did have great expectations for his eldest disciple.

Boom!

In the main hall, while the people were still discussing when to hold the appointment ceremony for Zhuge Yueyue, the sound of a huge explosion was heard.

“What’s going on?”

Everyone rushed outside and looked up at the same time. They could see that there were cracks all over the sky, and it was releasing bursts of dazzling divine light.

Ye Xuan frowned when he saw this, muttering, “The golden age is about to arrive…”

“There is already a continent that has collided with our East continent. In the future, the other continents will follow.”

“Senior Brother Ao, we have to start planning. I’m afraid that there might be another fierce battle.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, everyone trembled.

“Another battle?”

Ye Xuan then continued, “In the other continents, there are also different creatures and families. Once the eight continents are reunited, a new continent will be formed.”

“From now on, you will also be able to see many powerful creatures. Some of them are even born as supreme realm experts. The battle for the immortal path has already begun!”

Floating in the sky, Ye Xuan looked around and discovered a huge Azure Dragon on the other side. This was a member of the dragon race.

Perhaps a war between various races would soon commence.

Ye Xuan’s words caused waves of panic and fear to sweep through the crowd. When the eight continents were united, all kinds of wars would inevitably occur. After all, no one wanted to submit to another race or continent,

Everyone would vie for power and supremacy, and every expert would want to prove themselves to be the strongest, as well as to temper themselves through combat.

These wars would devastate the land, and most ordinary people, as well as the weaker cultivators, would suffer.

Ao Lei took a deep breath. Then, he turned around and said to the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect,” Continue the assessment!”

After hearing Ao Lei’s order, the various elders did not dare to delay and immediately began the assessment.

Ye Xuan remained where he was and looked at Zhuge Yueyue.

“Yueyue, what do you think? Among this group of prospective disciples, does anyone seem promising?”

Zhuge Yueyue shook her head. She had been paying close attention to them all this time, but none of the new disciples had caught her eye.

It was precisely because of this that she had not taken in any disciples so far.

Ye Xuan smiled and said indifferently, “It’s alright. Back then, I didn’t accept any disciples during the first round of recruitment either.”

“Don’t be anxious. Our Cloud Sky peak’s recruitment criteria for disciples is different from other peaks. If someone is truly fated, they will naturally join Cloud Sky peak.”

“In any case, if you find someone suitable, you can just accept him as your disciple. There’s no need to ask for my permission.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue smiled brightly, but mischievously.

“Teacher, I haven’t even fully grasped your teachings yet, so I don’t really want to recruit disciples.”

“After all, I still want to stay by Teacher’s side and learn more.”

Upon hearing this, Ye Xuan felt a little guilty.

Her family had all died because of the berserk beasts. After he had taken her in as a disciple, he had always protected her, and it seemed that she had become quite dependent on him.

Perhaps he had rushed things. She was just a little girl. It was indeed inappropriate and too early for him to make her become a teacher.

It wasn’t that he did not think highly of Zhuge Yueyue’s abilities, but rather that he was concerned for her from a psychological standpoint.

Ye Xuan smiled and gently rubbed Zhuge Yueyue’s head.

“Alright, alright. If you still don’t want to recruit disciples, then there’s no need to push the matter.”

“No matter what, I will always be here, so take your time to adapt.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Xuan said these words very sincerely. There was not much he could do for his disciples. He just hoped that, under his protection, they would grow up healthily and happily. Honestly, Cloud Sky peak becoming stronger and more developed was just a side objective.

If Ye Xuan really valued that, he would have recruited a large number of disciples. That being said, compared to the previous chiefs of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan was indeed a role model.

They had only accepted one disciple each, but Ye Xuan had accepted three. Clearly, he was the more hardworking one. In any case, the truly important thing was ensuring that his legacy was inherited.

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Zhuge Yueyue smiled happily.
