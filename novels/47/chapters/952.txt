953 The Treasury Opens

Boom!

A huge explosion rang out, causing the surroundings to tremble

“What is this furry monkey trying to do?”

“Not long ago, he was sent flying by the power of this barrier, yet he still thinks he can break it?”

Everyone was very puzzled at this moment. However, just as they thought that the little furry monkey would be sent flying again, a crisp cracking sound was heard, and the barrier shattered!

Yanran was surprised, and hurriedly said, “The barrier has been broken.”

However, the little monkey’s attacks not only broke the barrier, but the staff he was holding too.

Fortunately, the experts that had been surrounding the little monkey suddenly became more interested in what was behind the barrier than in killing the little monkey.

“Hehe, the treasures will be mine!”

A thin old man in a gray robe rushed over in large strides into the treasury, and the other experts soon followed suit, each trying to outpace the others.

Yanran looked at Ye Xuan. Only Ye Xuan was still very calm at this moment, quietly observing the scene.

He was not in a hurry to set off. After all, he sensed that Gongsun Ming was staring at him with an extremely cold gaze. It was clear that this old man was definitely up to something.

However, he was not nervous, and simply wanted to see what this old man would try.

Regrettably, Gongsun Ming did not choose to attack here. Instead, he took a deep look at Ye Xuan, and then led the people of the Immortal Divine sect into the treasury.

“Teacher, who was that old man just now?”

Zhuge Yueyue had also noticed the murderous look in Gongsun Ming’s eyes.

“His name is Gongsun Ming, and he is from the Immortal Divine sect of the South continent.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yue Yue and Feng Xiyun were both shocked.

“He’s also from the Immortal Divine sect?”

They had not expected another Immortal Divine sect to exist in the eight continents. However, it was obvious that this old man was out for revenge.

“Teacher, do we need to inform the chiefs and Grand Elder of this matter?” Zhuge Yueyue asked with a worried expression.

Ye Xuan shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that now. I’ll take care of it.”

“Oh right, where are the others now?”

Ye Xuan knew that Ao Lei and the others had already arrived at this ancient palace. However, he had not seen any traces of them since entering.

Feng Xingyun recalled for a moment before saying, “Teacher, I met Senior Brother Hua Rufeng not long ago. He discovered an ancient cave that contained dense spiritual energy, and was cultivating there.”

“Therefore, I didn’t disturb his cultivation and left. We didn’t encounter anyone else.”

Ye Xuan felt that this was strange, and could not help but worry. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Could that old man have done something?”

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan finally said, “Since the treasury is open, you can head in with Yanran. Don’t wander around alone.”

Hearing this, Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue nodded their heads in agreement. However, they also asked, “Teacher, what are you going to do?”

Ye Xuan turned around and looked at the space behind him in contemplation. After a long while, he said, “I still have to settle some other matters, and will come looking for you after that.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan did not delay any longer and turned to leave. Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun then left to join Yanran in the treasury.

…

Soon, Ye Xuan caught up to the heavily injured little monkey, who had already fallen unconscious.

Wukong had just used all his strength to break the barrier, which diverted everyone’s attention and gave him a chance to escape. Once Ye Xuan reached the little monkey, he frowned as he examined the latter’s condition.

“What’s going on? Did he suffer such a serious injury just now?”

Ye Xuan was already dumbfounded. He had been watching the battle the entire time, and it seemed that the little monkey had not suffered any serious injuries.

His spiritual sense swept over the little monkey’s body, and when it reached the little monkey’s sternum, he stumbled upon some dense golden divine runes.

“What exactly are these?”

Ye Xuan pondered for a moment, and his heart suddenly trembled.

“Oh my god! Is this the same type of divine bones as Senior Yi Feng’s?”

“I’m curious. Why did these divine bones appear in the little monkey’s body?”

What the hell is going on? Shouldn’t there only be one God’s Bone like Senior Brother Yi Feng’s in the world? But why did it appear now?

Ye Xuan was completely confused. The divine bones in the little monkey’s body had already completely stabilized. However, because the little monkey had consumed too many heavenly treasures after stealing them from the various experts, his body was overflowing with energy, and he did not know how to refine it.

This was the cause of the little monkey’s current crisis.

If he could overcome this tribulation, he would definitely undergo earth-shattering changes, and his cultivation level would skyrocket.

“This little monkey is really too heaven-defying. He’s been blessed by the heavens themselves.”
