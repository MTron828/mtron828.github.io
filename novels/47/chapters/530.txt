531 The Might Of The Boundless Palm

Yanran even felt a little incredulous that there was actually someone in this world who possessed such powerful sword intent.

Ye Xuan’s sword intent then coalesced and descended upon Ouyang Xiu, causing the sky to darken, and the ground to tremble.

It was just one sword strike, yet Ouyang Xiu could sense a fatal danger from it.

Without hesitation, he took out the mammoth cauldron and mobilized all of the spiritual power in his body to resist Ye Xuan’s attack.

!!

The mammoth cauldron emitted dazzling light, as it clashed with the descending sword beam.

Boom!

Ouyang Xiu y felt his arms go numb, and he continuously retreated.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was also very surprised. He had just reached the supreme realm, yet was able to push back a mid-stage supreme realm expert? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although he had only cultivated his divine body to the early stage, it was already comparable to the divine bodies of many mid-stage supreme realm experts.

Furthermore, the Flora sword technique augmented and multiplied his strength. It was more than enough to deal with Ouyang Xiu.

Even though it was just a casual attack, Yanran was shocked.

She had been fighting with Ouyang Xiu for several days, but had not made any headway. However, Ye Xuan seemed to have gained the advantage with a single attack. This meant that this senior brother of hers was stronger than she was.

How did someone cultivating in the barren East continent grow this strong?

At this moment, Ouyang Xiu was infuriated. He lifted the mammoth cauldron and hurled it toward Ye Xuan, charging toward Ye Xuan under its cover.

As he displayed his full strength, even space started to distort.

“You shameless thing, you asked for this!”

Ouyang Xiu shouted angrily as he charged over to Ye Xuan with lightning speed.

He knew very well that Ye Xuan was a master of the sword. However, the latter did not have a sword in his hand.

As long as he could get close to Ye Xuan, his chances of winning would greatly increase. After all, Ye Xuan’s strength stemmed from the power of his sword technique.

After seeing this, Yanran instantly deciphered Ouyang Xiu’s intentions and quickly shouted, “Senior Brother, where’s your sword? Hurry up and take it out. Don’t let him get close to you!”

“Hehe, it’s too late for that now!”

Ouyang Xiu laughed out loud, as he appeared by Ye Xuan’s side and threw a merciless punch.

Just as he thought he was about to succeed, he suddenly noticed that Ye Xuan’s expression was still very calm.

Ye Xuan raised his left hand unhurriedly, and rays of golden light wrapped themselves around it. Moments later, a golden seal was condensed around his hand. One look was enough to tell how powerful it was.

His palm then slammed into Ouyang Xiu’s fist, leveling several mountains behind Ouyang Xiu to the ground.

“It can’t be! This can’t be true!”

Ouyang Xiu simply could not believe what had happened.

When he had clashed with Ye Xuan just now, his hand and arm had been ruthlessly broken, and he was in extreme pain.

The power of this palm strike sent him flying thousands of meters away, and Ye Xuan immediately pursued.

Seeing this, Yanran also hurriedly followed behind Ye Xuan, her face filled with disbelief.

She and Ouyang Xiu were experienced and knowledgeable people. The attack that Ye Xuan had just launched contained a mysterious power that could only have come from an immortal-grade divine power!

“Why does he have an immortal-grade divine power? A secret technique like that rivals even the complete version of the Great Desolation technique!”

As much as she was surprised, Yanran also felt a little excited. She had a powerful senior brother. Also, this senior brother also had to address her as senior sister!

That deal was really worth it!

After spitting out several mouthfuls of blood, Ouyang Xiu was dispirited and listless. There was not a single place on his body that did not hurt.

Ye Xuan’s Boundless palm technique was so powerful that it had damaged his internal organs.

Ouyang Xiu had not expected Ye Xuan’s close combat ability to rival his sword technique.

He immediately took out a pill and ate it to treat his injuries.

It had only been a while, but the damage Ye Xuan had caused him was significantly healed.

However, the damage to his organs had yet to recover. Even so, the recovery ability of a supreme realm expert was truly something else.

“You stinky fellow, you are indeed powerful. However, I was caught by surprise and didn’t manage to dodge.”

“You were just lucky just now. Things will be different now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he took out a sword.

With the mammoth cauldron in one hand and the sword in the other, Ouyang Xiu’s aura seemed to have undergone a huge change due to the two magical artifacts.

“Ignorant brat, die!”

After angrily shouting, Ouyang Xiu drew his sword and swung it at Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan’s expression remained calm.

‘He actually wanted to compete with me? He really thought too highly of himself!’

“The sword in my hand is called the Disha Sword, and it’s a top-grade sword!”

“I know that you’re an expert in the Sword Dao, but I’m still going to challenge you today!”

“If you can block my sword strikes, I’ll let you off today,” Ouyang Xiu said with his head held high. Then, his majestic sword intent coalesced into a sword beam.

Ye Xuan was still smiling.
