781 Message From Beyond (Part 2)

However, once there, he looked around but did not notice anything.

Then, he looked at the shaking barrier and frowned.

At this moment, a paper crane emitting a faint sheen light slowly floated toward him and landed in his palm.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan was stunned. From the scent the paper crane exuded, he could already tell who had sent it over. He smiled.

After carefully unfolding the paper crane, he realized that there were only three words written on it, “I miss you.”

Sigh… What was this little girl doing?

She spent so much effort to send him this paper crane, just to tell him that she missed him? However, this also filled him with warmth.

It felt like a pair of lovebirds passing notes to each other in school. It was not a bad feeling.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Xuan took out a brush and wrote something on the paper crane. Then, he folded it again and used the power of the rainbow robe to send it back.

After settling this, Ye Xuan left the boundary.

On the other side of the barrier, Yanran had just turned around when she suddenly sensed something. She saw a paper crane flying towards her and could not help but feel a little excited.

She immediately opened the paper crane and looked at it. There were only a few words written inside, “I’m also thinking about you.”

Looking at these words, Yanran felt extremely happy. She originally wanted to chat with Ye Xuan, but had already sensed that Ye Xuan was no longer near the barrier.

Moreover, she knew that the East continent was currently experiencing a huge crisis and Ye Xuan probably did not have much time to waste there. That was why she gave up on this idea.

After seeing Yanran holding the paper crane with a happy expression, Old Master Sun smiled helplessly.

He sighed and said, “Sigh … I can’t help but admit that he’s really good at sweet-talking. He spent so much effort just to send that corny message?”

“I am indeed too old…”

After hearing her senior brother teasing her, Yanran was stunned.

“Oops…”

Just now, she was so concerned about Ye Xuan that she actually forgot that her senior brother had been behind her all this time. It seemed that he had seen everything…

How embarrassing!

Old Master Sun almost laughed out loud.

He had painstakingly taken care of his little junior sister for so long, yet she had been cheated away by another man.

Most importantly, he did not even know who this person was…

Waving his hand, Old Master Sun turned around and left the boundary.

Yanran sheepishly followed him while sneaking a glance back at the boundary, where the East continent lay. Her heart was filled with longing, and at the same time she made a decision.

“I’m afraid that the East continent is in danger of being wiped out. I must cultivate diligently and reach the sealed immortal realm in order to help Ye Xuan.”

Although his senior brother had just said that the world barriers would probably collapse soon, and that the eight continents would definitely be reunited, at that time, many forces would be involved, and it would definitely be chaotic.

Later on, Yanran returned to her secret chamber and began to cultivate.

Over at Sky Mountain, the situation was still tense, as there were still millions of berserk beasts roaring outside.

However, after Ye Xuan killed South Heavenly King, they became leaderless, and started attacking each other, consumed by the bloodthirst brought about by the strange power. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After a few hours, only about 100,000 of the millions of berserk beasts remained. The rest had been slaughtered, and the plains below Sky Mountain flowed with rivers of blood and guts.

The corpses were piled up on the ground, and the dense and rank scent of blood was enough to make anyone nearby throw up.

“Heavens! This is the first time in my life seeing something like this.”

“The carnage here can already be compared to the great war back then…”

Gao Shun said these words with a pale face.

“Martial Uncle Gao, since the situation outside is chaotic, should we head out and collect some treasures?” Hua Rufeng asked.

The plains below were filled with the corpses of all kinds of berserk beasts. If one was brave enough, they could easily obtain a lot of good stuff, such as precious bones and the like, which would increase one’s cultivation or strengthen one’s body.

However, doing so was extremely dangerous. After all, the berserk beasts outside were still fighting. Even a mystic lord realm expert might find it dangerous to wander outside alone, much less void and heaven realm cultivators.

Gao Shun was pondering the matter at this moment. He looked around and realized that many people were already anxiously waiting for his answer.

It seemed that the temptation of obtaining precious bones was deadly enough for them to risk their lives. However, before Gao Shun made a decision, no one dared to go outside without permission.

“That’s fine.”

Gao Shun waved his hand and said, “You can go out, but don’t go too far. After all, the situation is still dangerous. Search while staying in range of the defensive line.”

“Earlier, Chief Ye Xuan casually killed quite a number of berserk beasts, and there were a number of powerful ones among them. It’s dangerous, but this is also an opportunity for you. It depends on whether you are lucky and careful enough.”

Gao Shun was just about to open an exit in the defensive formation when a cry for help was heard.

“Fellow Daoist Gao, please save us!”

“Oh?”

After hearing this, Gao Shun was stunned…
