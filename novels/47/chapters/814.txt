815 Little Monkey (Part 1)

Ye Xuan observed it carefully, trying to figure out if there was anything special about this little monkey.

After all, this little monkey came from their Cloud Sky peak. Ye Xuan knew a little about the legend of this seven-colored stone.

It seemed to be one of the sacred items of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. However, with the passage of time, no one could discover its use, so it was placed in the Cloud Sky Cave.

Every chief of the Cloud Sky Peak was responsible for guarding the seven-colored Stone, but it seemed that even the Great Wilderness Divine sect had long forgotten about it.

“Why does this little furry monkey give me a bad feeling?”

Ye Xuan floated in the sky and frowned slightly. A bad feeling surfaced in his heart, but he could not pinpoint its source or meaning.

Did the birth of this little monkey herald another disaster?

Less than two hours had passed, and this little monkey had already become the monkey king of this place. Things had indeed developed very quickly.

While Ye Xuan was cultivating in seclusion, the seven-colored stone had been absorbing spiritual energy by his side, and even absorbed a lot of energy from the immortal heavenly treasure.

This was why it was so powerful despite just having been born. At the very least, it could easily deal with a small monkey king like this.

Moreover, this little furry monkey was born from the world itself, and thus carried an extremely dense aura of the world. However, because it had absorbed a lot of Ye Xuan’s overflowing spiritual energy, this little monkey had a great connection with Ye Xuan.

Thinking this, Ye Xuan raised his head to look at the sky. He stretched out his hands and continuously calculated, wanting to divine the background of this little monkey.

Finally, after checking for a long time, Ye Xuan stopped, and his brows began to furrow slightly.

“This is interesting. Is it really a natural disaster?”

Then, a smug smile appeared on his face. In that case, he had to take this little monkey in as a disciple.

Moreover, the birth of this little furry monkey was also related to Ye Xuan, so their karmic connection could not be severed.

After making his decision, Ye Xuan instantly transformed into a sage-like monkey. Then, he joined the group of monkeys and went over to the little monkey.

After becoming the monkey king, the little furry monkey was extremely excited.

However, what he did not expect was that just as he was feeling happy, an extremely terrifying roar was heard from afar.

After hearing this voice, many monkeys were frightened and hurriedly ran away. Within moments, the only one left behind was the little monkey standing there in a daze.

“Monkey King, hurry up and escape. The monster in the mountain has appeared again!”

The big-faced monkey briefly appeared and shouted.

When the little monkey turned around, it realized that the other monkeys had already hidden in a cave.

From the big-faced monkey’s words, it was obvious that the monster it was talking about was a frequent visitor, and that the cave in front of them was their only hiding place.

After hearing this, the little monkey felt very confused. With its confidence inflated, it stood up and said without hesitation, “What kind of monster is it? Let me teach it a good lesson!”

Hearing the tone of the little monkey, Ye Xuan, who was hiding in the dark, was very shocked. This little monkey’s courage was really amazing. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Xuan instantly swept the surroundings with his spiritual sense, and quickly located the monster, which was a humongous ape that had reached the middle stage of the heavenly realm.

In a small place like this, the ape could be considered an overlord.

Even though the little monkey was extremely talented, it definitely would not be able to defeat the ape at its current level.

Because he did not want it to die for no reason, Ye Xuan tried to persuade it,, “King, this big monster is very powerful. At present, you can’t defeat it. The best way to survive is to hide first.”

“No!”

Ye Xuan’s dissuasion had the opposite effect. The little furry monkey seemed even more fired up to teach the ape a lesson.

As soon as it finished speaking, the little monkey ran over toward the ape, roaring, “Damn it! Where exactly are you from? How dare you behave so impudently in my territory!”

When the ape saw that it was a little monkey that was shouting at it, it snorted, and even spat at the little monkey.

“Pah…”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan almost laughed out loud. It was an attack of a different sort. The little monkey almost drowned in a mouthful of saliva.

As a result, it became furious.

Seeing the little furry monkey’s angry expression, the corners of the ape’s mouth curled up slightly into a confused smile. It said indifferently, “Yoho! You’re quite hot-tempered, but that temper is worthless if you can’t back it up with strength.”

“Damn it!”

The little monkey clenched its fist and punched the giant ape without hesitation.

However, the ape did not move at all. It was as if the little monkey’s punch was just scratching his itch.

The little furry monkey was not stupid. It instantly understood the huge gap between the two of them.

“Hehe, you little furball, now it’s my turn to hit you.”

“Don’t worry, I won’t use too much strength…”

The corner of the giant ape’s mouth curled up into a slight smile, which scared the little monkey. Then, it was sent flying a hundred meters by a slap…
