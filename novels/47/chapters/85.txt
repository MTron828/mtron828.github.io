Chapter 86: The Patriarch Is About To Leave Secluded Cultivation

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As soon as he finished speaking, the sect leader of the Xuanyin sect raised his eyelids slightly.

“Does anyone have differing opinions on Elder Li’s suggestion?”

“I agree!”

Gu Da was the first to choose to stand on Li Wuji’s side!

“I agree!”

“Let’s do as Elder Li says!”

…

Most of the elders agreed, but a few of them were still a little worried, believing that the sect should not make too many strong enemies.

However, advised by the other elders, they were soon persuaded.

Once the patriarch reached the peak of the core formation realm, he would be invincible in the entire Great Qian Dynasty. Why should they be afraid of a few sects?

If they really had the courage to seek revenge, then the Xuanyin sect would uproot their sects entirely.

Even if the Great Qian Royal Family objected, so what?

The other party would not be able to do anything to the Xuanyin sect even though both sides had peak core formation realm experts.

After all, the once peak core formation realm experts started fighting, the fallout of their battle would not be something the Great Qian Dynasty could bear.

“In that case, let’s do as Elder Li says!”

“Tomorrow will be the day the patriarch comes out of seclusion! Everything will be settled then!”

The sect leader of the Xuanyin sect nodded.

He too agreed with Li Wuji’s suggestion.

Then, the elders continued to discuss how many cultivators should be sent to the Qingyun Sect tomorrow, and how many forces should be left behind to guard the sect.

“Hahaha! Once the patriarch is out, everything will be over.”

“As long as Ye Xuan isn’t dead, I won’t be able to sleep well!”

Gu Da said with a smile as soon as he left the Grand Hall.

“It is Ye Xuan’s honor to die at the hands of the Patriarch!”

Hearing this, Li Wuji could not help but smile coldly.

Of course, the reason they used such power was not simply to kill Ye Xuan. They mainly wanted to shatter the Qingyun sect’s guardian array formation and then destroy the entire Qingyun sect.

Moreover, among the elders who had besieged Ye Xuan back then, the ones who had put in the most effort were Li Wuji and Gu Da.

Both of them had reached the advanced stage of the Xudan realm. No matter how talented Ye Xuan was, it was impossible for him to break through to the advanced stage of the Xudan realm at the age of 20.

In other words, any one of them could easily suppress ye Xuan. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The real reason why Li Wuji and the others had chosen to besiege Ye Xuan back then was to eliminate him as quickly as possible before the Qingyun sect leader and elders could come to his rescue. They wanted to get rid of this genius rival of theirs.

Who would have thought that Ye Xuan’s status in the Qingyun sect was so high that the leader and the elders of the Qingyun sect spared no expense to save him.

Even so, Ye Xuan was still severely injured by the Five Poisons powder that Li Wuji had used.

As the poison of the Five Poisons powder was extremely potent, Li Wuji, Gu Da, and the others had not chosen to continue pursuing him back then. Luckily, Ye Xuan had awakened the system and neutralized the poison of the Five Poisons powder.

However, they would not let Ye Xuan off so easily this time. They had to kill him.

Moreover, with the patriarch making a move, everything would be foolproof.

“But if the patriarch kills him, wouldn’t the heavenly materials and earthly treasures left behind by that unity realm expert fall into the hands of the patriarch?”

Thinking this, Li Wuji could not help but frown.

In his opinion, Ye Xuan must have obtained some heavenly materials and earthly treasures left behind by a unity realm cultivator. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to neutralize the toxicity of the Five Poisons powder.

He was very tempted by these treasures.

“Forget it! As long as Ye Xuan is killed, it will be fine. Maybe the patriarch won’t look carefully at Ye Xuan’s possession. I still have a chance!”

Li Wuji could only comfort himself like this.

…

In the depths of the Xuanyin sect’s territory, there was an extremely ancient hall.

This ancient hall was vast and deserted, and was not guarded either. Other than the sect leader and a few elders, no one was allowed to approach this place.

This was the place where the patriarch of the Xuanyin sect was undergoing his secluded cultivation.

The patriarch of the Xuanyin sect had lived for hundreds of years, and he had survived a huge battle hundreds of years ago. Back then, he had already reached the middle stage of the golden core realm.

However, although he had survived, his cultivation foundation had been severely damaged. In order to treat his own injuries, he had stayed in seclusion for 300 years.

Were it not for the long lifespan of a golden core realm cultivator, coupled with the fact that he used the power of the Xuanyin sect to collect healing medicines, it would have been impossible for him to recover.

After that, he spent another 200 years cultivating and finally reached the advanced stage of the golden core realm. However, at the same time, his own potential had been exhausted. If he wanted to reach the peak of the core formation realm, he had to find another way.

Due to this, he thought of a method to absorb the qi and blood essence of others.

As long as he killed enough cultivators, he could obtain the abundant qi and blood essence in their bodies. However, even if he killed golden core realm experts, if the number was small, it would not be able to satisfy the energy requirements needed to reach the peak of the core formation realm.

However, if he killed too many golden core realm cultivators, it would certainly attract the attention of the Great Qian Royal Family. Perhaps that old monster would even try to suppress him because of this.

Therefore, he ultimately turned his attention to the ordinary people.

The Great Qian Dynasty had a total population of 1.7 billion people. Countless people were born every second every day, and the number of deaths was equally as numerous.

Perhaps they died from the fallout of battles between cultivators, or were hunted down by their enemies, or were even killed by bandits or monsters.

In short, as long as the number of deaths did not exceed a certain degree, the Great Qian Royal Family would not pursue the matter.

Therefore, he used the power of the sect to increase the number of disciples. Then, he sent them out to the various cities of the Great Qian Dynasty to bribe the bandits and order them to slaughter the villages.

When the bandits were no longer useful, the Xuanyin sect cultivators would cease their partnership with them and kill them. By doing this, they kept the whole matter secret, while also obtaining more qi and blood essence from the bandits they killed.

Since they were killing the bandits, they would also be able to use that excuse to drum up public support. It could be said that it was a plan to kill three birds with one stone.

It turned out that the patriarch of the Xuanyin sect was indeed very shrewd. As long as the sect concealed their actions and whereabouts of their disciples properly, the Great Qian Royal Family would not be able to find any clues about this matter.

Moreover, in order to ensure that the collection of the qi and blood essence proceeded smoothly, he ordered the sect leader of the Xuanyin sect to establish a team to monitor their recruited disciples.

If they found out that any of them were at risk of leaking their secrets, they would kill them without hesitation.

Of course, if someone found out about their collection of qi and blood essence, they would also kill that person.

It was not until Ye Xuan appeared that the possibility of this whole scheme being revealed appeared.

Moreover, he was the first to receive the information. Therefore, even if Li Wuji and the others did not suggest it, he would still kill Ye Xuan immediately after leaving secluded cultivation.

Previously, he might have been afraid of the Great Qian Royal Family, but now that he had reached the peak of the core formation realm, he no longer had to restrain his ambition.

He did not want to remain at the peak of the core formation realm either. He wanted to gather even more qi and blood essence to help him reach the unity realm.

Therefore, Ye Xuan had to die!

Buzz!

Suddenly, incomparably terrifying energy fluctuations suddenly rippled out from the ancient hall.

The sect leader and the elders who were discussing matters in the Grand Hall sensed this, and their eyes lit up. Then, they turned into streaks of light and flew out of the Grand Hall.

“This aura… this is the Patriarch’s aura!”

“The patriarch has finally advanced!”
