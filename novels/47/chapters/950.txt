951 Suspicions

“Uh… About that… Go ahead, but just try not to hit him too hard. I think it’s fine to just teach him a lesson.”

Ye Xuan could only say this. However, Yanran felt confused at this moment.

‘Why does Ye Xuan seem a little strange? Why is he protecting this little monkey? Could it be that this little monkey is also his disciple?’

This thought suddenly appeared in Yanran’s mind. It had to be said that her intuition was ridiculously accurate. Her guess was actually not unfounded. After all, according to her understanding of Ye Xuan, if there was no relationship between him and this little monkey, he would not interfere like this.

The only people Ye Xuan ever bothered to help were those around him.

At this moment, Yanran stared at Ye Xuan intently and asked, “Hurry up and tell me the truth. This little monkey is a disciple you secretly accepted, right?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan panicked.

‘Oh my god, I just said not to kill him. How could you guess from just that?’

‘Could it be that you were a fortune-teller in your previous life?’

After hearing Yanran’s words, Zhuge Yue Yue and Feng Xiyun were extremely shocked.

“What?”

“Could it be that we have a junior brother?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun could not help but exchange glances. After seeing their teacher lower his head, they looked at the little monkey in the distance in shock.

Could this little monkey really be their teacher’s disciple?

Zhuge Yueyue suddenly recalled that during the period when the monkey first appeared, Ye Xuan had not been at Cloud Sky peak.

Could it really be…

Thinking this, she realized that this little monkey seemed to have been born near the Cloud Sky peak.

Others might not understand, but as the current chief of Cloud Sky peak, she now knew everything there was to know about Cloud Sky peak.

Seeing that Zhuge Yueyue was about to say something, Ye Xuan knew that she might have already guessed it. He could only hurriedly signal her, causing her to cover her mouth in time and not say anything.

Ye Xuan’s back was covered in cold sweat. Fortunately, nothing had been said out loud just yet.

Ye Xuan could only quickly deny the fact that the little monkey was his disciple and added, “How can this be? The cultivation technique that this little monkey uses is completely different from our Cloud Sky Peak’s. How could he be my disciple?”

“I can guarantee that this little monkey has nothing to do with me.”

Hearing Ye Xuan’s solemn words, Yanran was still a little suspicious.

However, she did notice that the cultivation technique that this little furry monkey displayed was indeed different from Ye Xuan’s. Ye Xuan was a sword cultivator, while this little monkey was a staff cultivator.

There should be no connection between them, right?

“Alright, since he’s not your disciple, I won’t bother showing mercy.”

After saying these words indifferently, Yanran erupted with dense killing intent, scaring Ye Xuan. At this moment, he did not have the courage to continue speaking up for the little monkey.

Zhuge Yueyue understood her teacher’s dilemma, so she could only speak up.

“Teacher’s wife, even though this little monkey has a bad nature, he hasn’t reached the point where he deserves to die. I also feel that it’s enough to teach him a lesson.”

“No matter what, this little monkey is a genius of our East continent, so it isn’t appropriate to kill him.”

“First Sister! Why are you speaking up for this little monkey?”

Feng Xiyun immediately complained when she heard Zhuge Yueyue’s words.

She had suffered, yet her first sister was not on her side and instead pleading for mercy on behalf of this little monkey.

Zhuge Yueyue was also very helpless, and turned to look at her teacher. It seemed that she had to deal with this herself.

“How about this? Leave this matter to me. I’ll teach him a lesson instead!”

Zhuge Yueyue had no choice. She took out the Cloud Heaven Sword, preparing herself to take action.

After all, if she attacked, she would still spare the little monkey’s life. However, if Yanran attacked, the little monkey would definitely die or be crippled.

Out of consideration for her teacher, she had no choice but to do this.

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, Ye Xuan hurriedly said, “I think this suggestion is not bad. You have just obtained some achievements in the Sword Dao, so you can use this little monkey as a training partner.”

Seeing the scene that the master and disciple had put together, Yanran became even more suspicious.

She revealed a cold smile and looked at Ye Xuan as if she already knew that he was lying.

However, she did not expose Ye Xuan at this moment. After all, he must have his own concerns for not telling the truth.

After thinking for a moment, Yanran said coldly, “Alright, Yueyue, you do it. If you can’t beat him, I can always take action.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue instantly felt pressured. If it was in the past, she could easily deal with this little monkey.

However, things were different now. The little monkey’s combat strength had increased tremendously, and she did not have the confidence to win.

Besides, the little monkey had just eaten the Witch Hazel Flower, which further increased his strength. It was likely that the little monkey would break through and reach the ancient realm soon.

Thus, she could not help but turn around and look at her teacher. After all, he was the reason she was doing this right now.

Ye Xuan looked at his disciple guiltily at this moment. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, just as Zhuge Yue Yue was about to attack, the space in front of her twisted, and a group of people appeared in front of her.

When this group of people noticed the presence of the little monkey, they immediately flew into a rage and roared, “Damned monkey, we’ll skin you alive today!”
