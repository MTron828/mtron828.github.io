294 One Finger

The lightning tribulation realm comprised the three tribulations of heaven, earth, and human!

Only by passing through these three lightning tribulations could one advance to the King realm that could dominate the world. Only by breaking through to the King realm could one truly wrest one’s fate from the heavens.

During the pattern condensation realm and the lightning tribulation realms, one had to be wary of the karma of the heavens. Failure to do so would lead to a more difficult tribulation, and the cultivator may not even be able to advance to the lightning tribulation realm, much less the king realm.

Hence, before breaking through to the lightning tribulation realm, most pattern condensation realm cultivators would choose to stay clear of matters that might affect their own karma. In fact, within the Huangyu Zone, there were many pattern condensation realm and lightning tribulation realm experts.

However, they would not show themselves easily. As long as the matters or conflicts did not affect their lives or their cultivation, they would definitely ignore it.

This was also why Jun Lingtian and Shangguan Wan’er were known as the most powerful people in their respective regions despite their relatively young age.

After all, there were still some old monsters who had cultivated for thousands of years in solitude, many of which had reached the lightning tribulation realm and were extremely powerful.

Thanks to this, and the deterrence of the ancestor of the Divine Gate Holy Land, Ye Xuan was very clear that lightning tribulation realm experts would not get involved in the tussle for the Tower of Heaven.

In any case, he still had the king realm jade tokens as trump cards. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“My physical strength has almost reached its peak for the time being. If I want to break through further, my heavenly lightning intent will need to break through as well to increase the tempering power of the lightning bolts.”

“After 90 days of tempering, the cultivation boost I received has almost been fully refined, and my control over my strength has been restored to 80%.”

“It’s time to leave. I’ll be able to continue cultivating and consolidating once things have settled down,” Ye Xuan said to himself.

After all this was settled, Ye Xuan planned to get more rewards from Shangguan Wan’er.

This precious disciple of his was the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, and should be quite skilled in terms of alchemy, formations and artifact refining.

If he could make use of the system to increase his mastery in those fields, he would be able to make better use of the resources he had plundered from the various sects and forces he had exterminated in the Nanzhou Region previously.

As such, Ye Xuan’s plan was simple. He would first obtain an inheritance of a master alchemist, formation master, or artifact refiner, and then pass them on to his disciples to increase the level of his skill in these areas.

Of course, there was another simpler method, which was to get Shangguan Wan’er to transmit her knowledge of these fields to him, after which he would teach his other disciples and obtain the corresponding system rewards.

After making his decision, Ye Xuan waved his hand, and the thousands of lightning bolts suddenly vanished.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan turned into a streak of purple lightning that flashed across the spatial turbulence in the direction of the Qingyun sect.

At the same time, at the border between the Nanzhou Region, mysterious ripples suddenly appeared in the sky. Then, a powerful being with a cold expression tore through space and appeared.

A seven-pattern condensation realm expert!

Similar to the rest, his target was the Tower of Heaven. This was an order he had received from a King realm expert of the Hidden God Hall.

It was common knowledge that most cultivators could only engrave five profound patterns at the pattern condensation realm. Those who could engrave seven profound patterns could already be called peerless geniuses.

This seven-pattern condensation realm expert had just left secluded cultivation, after which he had been immediately given the order to go to the Qingyun sect, kill Ye Xuan, and bring back the Tower of Heaven.

Under normal circumstances, he would not want to create any grudges with such a monster.

After all, he had already touched the threshold of the lightning tribulation realm. If he could not kill Ye Xuan, the karmic ties between them would affect his lightning tribulation, which would hamper his chances of advancing.

However, he did not dare to disobey the King realm expert. Therefore, he could only make his way over to the Qingyun sect to kill Ye Xuan.

However, just as he tore space apart to head in the direction of the Qingyun sect...

A dazzling streak of lightning flashed past him with a crackle and bang.

Even he, as a seven-pattern condensation realm expert, could not react in time.

After the bang, the streak of lightning dissipated to reveal the figure of a young man.

“What?”

The expert’s expression changed when he saw this.

Transforming his body into heavenly lightning?

Had this guy comprehended the supreme intent of heavenly lightning? Furthermore, it had to have been comprehended to a high level too, or such a feat would not have been possible.

Who was this person? Why had he never heard of such a peerless Heaven’s Blessed in the Huangyu Zone?

He felt his blood run cold.

“You’re the one who wants to snatch my Tower of Heaven, right?”

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s eyes shone with a bright purple light.

Hearing this, the expert’s expression changed drastically.

Tower of Heaven?

This guy was actually Ye Xuan?

He had actually comprehended a legendary supreme intent!

His hair stood on end as he shivered.

Run! Hurry up and run!

The fact that Ye Xuan had appeared here knowingly meant that Ye Xuan was confident that he was stronger.

If he did not run away quickly, would he not be courting his own death?

However, at this moment, an invisible force suddenly confined the expert, rendering him immobile.

Then, Ye Xuan stretched out his hand unhurriedly and gently pointed with his finger.

This time, he did not use any martial intent, just pure physical strength.

However, it was this very finger that crushed the expert’s body in an instant!
