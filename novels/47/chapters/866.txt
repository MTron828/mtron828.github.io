867 Still Alive And Kicking?

Zhuge Yueyue raised her head and looked at the figure in the sky. She was extremely happy.

“Second Sister has actually obtained the Immortal Sacred Body. Her cultivation level is bound to increase by leaps and bounds! Perhaps she will soon become stronger than I am.”

“In that case, I have to work harder. I can’t let Teacher down.”

The burden on her shoulders had become heavier. As the eldest disciple of Cloud Sky peak, her one obsession was to be strong enough to protect her two junior sisters.

However, it would not be long before her two junior sisters would surpass her in terms of strength. At the very least, she did not want to drag them down, so she had to get stronger.

After the flames in the sky gradually dissipated, the scorching temperature surrounding Cloud Sky peak dissipated as well. Filled with anxiety, Ao Lei immediately said, “Let’s go inside and see what’s going on.”

At this moment, what everyone was most concerned about was the situation inside. They flew up toward the peak, followed by a group of disciples.

Up on the peak, Feng Xiyun had also landed on the ground. The gentle breeze made her red dress flutter in the wind.

“Teacher!”

After sensing the huge changes in her body, Feng Xiyun was extremely excited and shouted happily.

Ye Xuan examined the immortal bone in Feng Xiyun’s body with satisfaction.

“Very good. With the help of this immortal bone, your cultivation journey will definitely be smooth sailing in the future, and I won’t have to worry too much about your cultivation.”

After hearing Ye Xuan’s words, Feng Xiyun felt extremely touched. Her teacher had helped her pave the way for her future. Feng Xiyun remembered everything in her heart.

Moments later, many people suddenly arrived outside Cloud Sky Palace. After discovering this situation, Elder Qian Yi was shocked. Had he made a big mistake, which was why the Great Wilderness Divine sect had sent so many people to capture him? Anxiety gripped his heart.

Ao Lei strode into the Cloud Sky Hall, followed by a group of chiefs and elders. Zhuge Yueyue had already rushed to Ye Xuan and Feng Xiyun’s side. Her gaze landed on Feng Xiyun as she grabbed her arm.

“Xiyun, hurry up and let me take a look. You’re not hurt, are you?”

“No, I’m not. First Sister, I’m fine. There’s no need to worry.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue heaved a sigh of relief.

At this moment, after Ao Lei entered the palace, he immediately spotted Elder Qian Yi, who was standing in a corner.

“Elder Qian Yi, are you alright?”

Seeing that Elder Qian Yi was still alive and well, the weight on his shoulders was lifted. Seeing everyone’s concerned gazes, Elder Qian Yi felt panicked and confused.

“Huh? I’m fine? Is something supposed to happen to me?”

Hua Rufeng also rushed forward and scanned Elder Qian Yi from top to bottom. Seeing that the latter was full of energy, he was stunned.

Whoa! This elder was really powerful!

How could he survive Martial Uncle Ye’s attacks?

Moreover, he could even vaguely sense that the aura emitted by Elder Qian Yi was a little stronger than before. How did he do it?

Hua Rufeng was curious, so he asked directly, “This is unbelievable, surprising. Elder Qian Yi. Weren’t you already seriously injured and on the verge of death? Why are you still alive and kicking?”

After hearing this, Elder Qian Yi’s face instantly darkened.

This fellow was not tactful at all! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Why was he alive and kicking? Was this fellow hoping for his death?

At this moment, Hua Rufeng realized that he had said something wrong and immediately said, “Uh, Elder Qian Yi, I didn’t mean it that way. It’s just that when I went out to call for help just now, I clearly saw that you had already been knocked to the ground, but you seem fine now.”

Elder Qian Yi’s gaze could not help but turn to Ye Xuan as he said, “It’s all thanks to Sword Immortal Ye. Without his help, I would have been stuck at the early stage of the supreme realm for the rest of my life.”

“I will definitely remember your great kindness always. From now on, if there’s anything I can help with, just say the word.”
