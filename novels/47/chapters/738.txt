739 Continuous Breakthrough (Part 1)

On Cloud Sky peak, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun had already arrived outside the Cloud Sky Cave. After sensing this energy, they became very excited.

Since they were right outside the cave, they would be able to absorb even more of this energy.

Zhuge Yueyue said without hesitation, “Don’t just stand there. Hurry up and find a place to sit and absorb all this energy.”

After Feng Xiyun heard this, she immediately sat down cross-legged. Xiang Yun, on the other hand, was a little confused.

She stretched out her hand to try and grab the energy, but it passed through her hand.

“First Sister, what exactly is this?”

Zhuge Yueyue said hastily, “Third Sister, this energy comes from Teacher. Don’t power is all feedback from our teacher. Don’t dwell on this anymore. Hurry up and absorb this power.”

“Alright.”

Xiang Yun was overjoyed to hear this, as this confirmed that her teacher had not fallen into eternal sleep.

Zhuge Yueyue and the others started cultivating outside the Cloud Sky Cave, and the people from the Su family also benefited. They were extremely excited to have suddenly experienced an unexpected windfall.

“Hahaha, Young Master Su, we’ve hit the jackpot this time!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

A Su family elder jumped up and down in excitement after refining a wisp of this energy.

“This energy appears to be able to purify restless elements, so it can greatly reduce the danger of inner demons.”

“Oh my god, it’s actually so awesome?”

After thinking for a moment, Su Changhe laughed out loud and said, “Chief Ye Xuan is indeed a big shot, hahaha!”

“Even the casual release of energy is a blessing to us ordinary people.”

At this moment, Daoist Yi Feng slowly opened his eyes.

“Eh… This energy is too mysterious.”

His heart seemed to have become much clearer, and this was what made Daoist Yi Feng puzzled.

Due to the inner demon in his heart, Daoist Yi Feng had been stuck at the same cultivation level for more than a hundred years. However, after absorbing the energy released by Ye Xuan, the inner demon seemed to be faintly fluctuating.

He did not understand that this was the Chaos Immortal Peach’s effect, which had the power to purify all evil.

At this moment, because his inner demon had been weakened considerably, Daoist Yi Feng only needed to cultivate a little and had reached the middle-stage of the supreme realm.

Within a few minutes, he reached the peak of the supreme realm.

“F*ck…”

No matter how calm Daoist Yi Feng usually was, this was something that had been plaguing him for countless years. Furthermore, it had happened out of the blue.

After breaking through to the peak of the supreme realm, Daoist Yi Feng had originally wanted to break through to the ancient realm in one go.

However, moments later, flames instantly soared into the sky in his sea of consciousness. The power that he had just mobilized dissipated again.

“Sigh… Forget it. ”

“So what if I reach the ancient realm? I don’t have many friends left, and there’s nothing I miss in the East continent.”

Daoist Yi Feng did not attempt to break through to the ancient realm. Instead, he stood there in a daze in the secret chamber.

As time passed, the energy began to weaken.

At this moment, Ye Xuan’s eyes seemed to flash in the Cloud Sky Cave.

“They’ve finally finished absorbing it?”

Although Ye Xuan was still in the Cloud Sky Cave and did not know the situation in the outside world, he had already sensed that the energy that contained a trace of the eternal from the Chaos Immortal Peach was already running out.

Ye Xuan could already imagine what kind of furor was going on outside. After all, this was a great opportunity to increase their strength, and they did not even have to do anything.

Who would not be happy to receive free stuff?

However, in this case, not only were the recipients happy, but even the giver was happy.

“You guys benefited greatly, but I didn’t lose out either.”

As soon as Ye Xuan finished speaking, the system’s notification arrived.

“Ding! Because the host has released a large amount of energy that has benefited all of the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, the host has received a 10,000x critical reward!”

Hearing this, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. He was the final winner. Thanks to the system, he could be as charitable as he wanted to.

“Ding! Congratulations! The host has obtained 10,000x of the energy expended!”

“Yes! This really is the best!”

According to Ye Xuan’s estimation, even if he absorbed the power of the immortal heavenly treasure and the purple crystal, he would at most be able to reach the middle-stage of the ancient realm, but Ye Xuan was not satisfied with this.

That’s why he had opted for the method he had just carried out. In this way, he could obtain a far better reward from the system.

“Hehe…”

“I’m really a genius to have thought of such a wonderful method.”

Ye Xuan praised himself. Then, when the system notification ended, Ye Xuan sensed an immense amount of energy surging into his body, colliding with the realm barrier.
