897 Descent Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If Zhuge Yueyue had only been famous in the East continent before this, she was now destined to be famous throughout the eight continents.

She would be recognized as a top-notch genius, not at all inferior to those ancient divine beasts with precious bloodlines.

In the sky, Ou Yunhai, who had been watching the whole situation unfold, had a cold look in his eyes as he sneered.

“This is interesting. Could she be the next Ye Xuan?”

“Not only does she have immortal bones, but she also has such a powerful offensive divine power. If nothing unexpected happens, she will definitely be able to break through to the sealed immortal realm.”

“Unfortunately, after Shan Hai’s death, the lightning tiger clan in the Heavenly Dao World will definitely take action. The Great Wilderness Divine sect is probably finished this time.”

He was looking forward to what would happen next even more.

No matter what, the lightning tiger clan was leagues ahead of the golden-furred growler clan, as they possessed the bloodline of the ancient white tiger, which was a divine beast.

The ancient white tiger was so strong that it could probably destroy all eight continents with just a breath.

These clans with noble bloodlines were not only powerful in the eight continents, but they also had extremely powerful forces in the Heavenly Dao World, so the moment they were killed by others, their ancestors and predecessors would definitely take action.

No one could bear the consequences of that, so most allowed the descendants of noble bloodlines to get away scot-free.

Sure enough, Ou Yunhai was right.

The moment Shan Hai’s life force was extinguished, everyone at the East Sea could sense a huge commotion erupt in the Heavenly Dao World.

After discovering this, the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect became flustered. They were still reeling from the battle that had just taken place, but before they could even celebrate their victory, another powerful enemy had appeared.

Above the East Sea, Zhuge Yueyue frowned. Feng Xiyun also flew up next to her as they watched the skies above.

“First Sister, you should hurry up and leave this place. I’m the one who caused this to happen, so naturally, I should bear the responsibility.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue snapped, “Oh be quiet! Go back down. As long as I’m alive no such thing will happen to you!”

After hearing this, Feng Xiyun’s eyes were filled with tears, but she did not say anything. Her first sister’s care for her had not diminished in the slightest.

Every time a crisis came, her first sister would stand forth and protect her without any regard for her own safety. Furthermore, she had never complained about it either.

After all, as a senior sister, Zhuge Yueyue felt that she should protect her junior sisters well. This was an extremely normal thing to do.

Feng Xiyun did not know what to say anymore, but she chose to stay by her first sister’s side. Even though she knew that they were about to face an even more powerful enemy, she did not back down.

“Let them come. As a disciple of Cloud Sky peak, I will not cower before an enemy,” Feng Xiyun said resolutely and decisively. She had already assumed a fighting stance.

After seeing the two of them disregard their lives, and prepare for an impossible battle, everyone was extremely shocked. Just their attitude and determination was worthy of admiration.

As the skies trembled, pitch-black clouds descended upon the East Seam exuding an extremely oppressive aura. Everyone held their breaths as they looked up, waiting to see what kind of enemy would appear this time.

Then, they saw a huge door appear in the sky, which emitted a dense chaotic aura.

“It’s finally about to appear.”

Looking closely, they could see seven huge figures appearing in the sky.

“Oh my god! Seven of them came at once!”

Exclamations of shock and disbelief rang out. No one had expected so many experts to appear at once. Furthermore, these experts had all sent their true bodies over and appeared in the East continent through the door.

However, the moment they passed through the door, their cultivation levels were suppressed to the peak of the sealed immortal realm.

Even so, their auras suppressed everyone present, and caused the onlookers to panic. These seven experts were enough to flip the whole world around and change the fate of the eight continents!

Zhuge Yueyue’s heart skipped a beat when she saw the seven of them.

“Seven sealed immortal realm experts… Such a grand occasion,” she muttered to herself.

This was beyond her expectations. Who knew that seven of them would come at once?

It was obvious that these people were trying to eliminate any future troubles, and were not planning to let anyone escape.

On the other side, Ou Yunhai was also feeling a little flustered, and no longer dared to hover in the sky arrogantly. After all, he himself did not expect that the lightning tiger clan would view this incident so seriously and dispatch seven immortals to deal with it.

“My God! Those two little girls will definitely die today.”

“However, what are they going to do after they get rid of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. If they decide to attack the other continents, there will definitely be a catastrophe,” Ou Yunhai muttered to himself in a panic.

Given the strength of these seven immortals, they could completely dominate the eight continents.

If they wanted to, they could even slaughter everyone.
