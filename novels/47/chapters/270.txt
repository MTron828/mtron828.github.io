Chapter 271: Condition

After all, the more time passed, the more likely it was that Shangguan Wan’er would obtain a spiritual item that could allow her to experience an epiphany.

When that happened, she might be able to awaken her special constitution by herself, and Ye Xuan would lose out on a precious opportunity to gain a strong sword constitution.

“Hmph! Do you think I care?”

Shangguan Wan’er looked at Ye Xuan and replied coldly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, her heart was in turmoil.

Just now, when Ye Xuan used the Tower of Heaven, she could clearly sense the spatial intent contained within it.

Needless to say, this was extremely tempting.

Of course, if she knew that the Tower of Heaven also contained traces of karmic intent, she would not have been able to restrain herself.

“It’s not a harsh condition.”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a teasing look.

If he could take in a tsundere empress as his disciple, that would be a pretty good feeling!

“Oh? Then what is your condition? Tell me about it, and I might consider it.”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s heart was moved slightly, but she did not show it on her face, putting on a cold and aloof look.

“It’s simple! Take me as your teacher,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“What? You want to be my teacher?”

“Hmph! With your current cultivation level, can you even defeat me?”

Shangguan Wan ‘er’s eyes narrowed slightly, and her body exuded a threatening aura.

That condition was truly ridiculous!

As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, how could she take someone else as her teacher?

Moreover, with her strength and talent, did she even need a teacher? With the memories of her previous life, she had countless martial techniques and cultivation methods at her disposal.

As for the spiritual items that could increase a cultivator’s comprehension value and innate bone value, she could fight for them with her own strength. Why would she need to rely on others?

Even though Ye Xuan was likely to be the reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert, Shangguan Wan’er still found it funny.

“What’s wrong? Do you think I’m not qualified to be your teacher?”

Ye Xuan was not surprised at all.

However, he was also clear about Shangguan Wan’er’s objectives. As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, coupled with her pattern condensation realm cultivation, what this woman needed the most was a spiritual item that could provide her with an epiphany.

Only then would she be able to comprehend stronger martial intents and reawaken more of her past life’s memories.

As long as this woman was attracted to the Tower of Heaven, everything was still on the table.

Buzzzzzz!

Ye Xuan’s right hand opened slightly, and a purple bead filled with destructive power suddenly appeared.

“If you take me as your teacher, I can also give you this!”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er and said with a teasing look.

“What? A heart of heavenly lightning!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er could no longer remain calm.

She looked at the purple bead in Ye Xuan’s hand with a dazed look, and knew very well that this was no ordinary object, but a spiritual item that contained the purest power of heavenly lightning!

A heart of heavenly lightning!

In her awakened memories, there were records of this spiritual item.

This was an extremely rare heavenly treasure!

If a cultivator refined it, their heavenly lightning intent would advance by leaps and bounds.

However, the difficulty of refining it was also extremely high. The cultivator had to already have comprehended heavenly lightning intent, or at least the embryonic form of heavenly lightning intent.

Otherwise, not only would they not be able to refine it, but they might also be devoured by the violent power of heavenly lightning.

In addition, there were strict requirements for the strength of the cultivator, which was the seventh level of the unity realm. Only cultivators who had reached this level had divine elements capable of resisting the destructive power of heavenly lightning.

Finding such a heavenly treasure was dependent on luck and fate.

If one was not fated, even if the heavenly treasure was right next to them, they would not be able to detect it.

The lightning tribulation mystic realm had existed for countless years, but before Ye Xuan, no cultivator had ever discovered the existence of the heart of heavenly lightning.

“The lightning tribulation mystic realm. You found it inside the mystic realm!”

Shangguan Wan’er had a look of realization.

She finally understood why the mystic realm had suddenly collapsed.

Thinking this, Shangguan Wan’er looked deeply at Ye Xuan.

As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, she could be considered someone who possessed great fate.

Even so, she had not discovered the heart of heavenly lightning despite being in the mystic realm several days longer than Ye Xuan.

Sensing Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze, Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly, and he looked straight at her.

“Hmph!”

When Shangguan Wan’er saw this, she immediately turned her head away arrogantly, trying her best to resist the impulse to stare at the heart of heavenly lightning.

It was impossible for her to take Ye Xuan as her teacher.

‘I’m the reincarnation of an ancient great empress. If I were to casually acknowledge someone as my teacher for the sake of my item, my pride would suffer a blow.’

Moreover, Shangguan Wan’er did not think that Ye Xuan would really give the heart of heavenly lightning to her.

It was far too valuable!

Did he really take her for a fool?

If she did not suspect that Ye Xuan was the reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert, Shangguan Wan’er would have tried to snatch it.

Ye Xuan looked at the proud Shangguan Wan’er and could not help but raise an eyebrow.

Very good, very good!

She was obviously very tempted, but she pretended not to care.
