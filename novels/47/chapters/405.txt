406 I Should Have Checked The Zodiac Signs

As soon as he finished speaking, Su Tiansheng pushed open the door and walked in.

Su Changhe sensed the movement and halted his cultivation.

“Father, Mother, why have you come?”

Su Changhe quickly stood up and went over to welcome them.

In fact, the reason why he was so filial just now was not entirely because of Ye Xuan.

After the incident with Ye Xuan, he had also thought about it carefully.

He had indeed caused a lot of trouble for the family over the years. It had always been his father cleaning up his mess, and his mother had always doted on him.

Su Changhe felt touched when he recalled this.

It could be said that his act of filial piety just now came from the bottom of his heart.

“Son, although cultivation is important, you must strike a balance between work and rest. Otherwise, it will affect your cultivation foundation, and that would be bad.”

“Instead of staying in your room all day to cultivate, you should take some time to go out and see the world. This will also temper your will and heart,” Su Tiansheng said with a smile.

Su Changhe’s eyes widened in shock.

In the past, every time he said he wanted to go out and play, his father would look at him like he wanted to beat him to death. Now, his father had taken the initiative to ask him to go out and explore?

It seemed that his actions had caused his father’s opinion of him to change.

Su Changhe’s heart warmed at the thought of this and he smiled.

“Father, don’t worry. I know what to do.”

“Mm! I’ll ask Elder Chen to stay by your side so you can go out and relax when you want to!”

Su Changhe did not refuse. After all, ever since he returned to the Su family, he had been cultivating in his room and had not gone out for a long time.

Furthermore, before today, Ye Xuan had always been a shadow in his heart. He had been so scared that he did not even dare to go out the door.

With Su Tiansheng’s assurance, Su Changhe felt that he had finally gained a new lease on life. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Some time later, Su Changhe walked out of the house in a fine suit with a fan in his hand. He had a gentle and elegant appearance.

As for Elder Chen, he was Su Changhe’s guard and was responsible for his safety.

Su Changhe was no longer as arrogant and domineering as he used to be when he was playing on the streets of Qingyang City. He had become low-key.

“Qingyang Restaurant?”

Suddenly, Su Changhe’s gaze fell on the signboard of a restaurant not far away, and he stopped in his tracks.

Qingyang Restaurant was an extremely famous restaurant in Qingyang City.

It was said that the owner of this restaurant was a heaven realm expert!

This was why it had been able to ward off those with ill intentions and become one of the top restaurants in the city.

As a result, almost all the major families in Qingyang City patronized Qingyang Restaurant.

In the past, this was also a place that Su Changhe liked to come to, especially for the osmanthus wine it served, which had been brewed for decades.

“Young Master, why don’t we go in and have a seat?” Elder Chen suggested when he saw Su Changhe’s gaze.

As the Su family’s guardian for many years, Elder Chen had been by Su Changhe’s side for many years. Naturally, he understood his personality and habits.

Su Changhe’s personality was also very simple and crude. He only knew how to eat, drink, womanize, and gamble.

He did not dare to touch women now, but he could still have a sip of wine.

“Mm, okay. Let’s go in and have a drink,” Su Changhe thought for a while and said.

He did not think his luck was so bad that he would meet Ye Xuan there.

As soon as Su Changhe entered Qingyang Restaurant, the waiter inside greeted him with a smile.

“Waiter, get me a private room on the top floor!”

“No problem! Young Master Su, please come this way!”

As the waiter escorted him, Su Changhe made his way to the top floor with a smile on his face.

“Young Master Su, it’s been a long time since you’ve been to Qingyang Restaurant. Your usual private room has been reserved by other guests,” the waiter explained in embarrassment.

Su Changhe raised his eyebrows and said in dissatisfaction, “Just who is so bold to dare to snatch this young master’s reservation?”

Su Changhe walked to his private room angrily and pulled open the curtains.

When he saw the three beautiful women in the private room, the corners of his mouth twitched and he almost fell down.

The waiter was about to explain, but Su Changhe turned around without hesitation and rushed downstairs.

Seeing this, Elder Chen was a little confused.

“Young Master, is there something wrong with the private room?”

“Hurry up and run! That fiend is inside!”

Su Changhe’s face was pale and he felt a lingering fear.

Elder Chen’s expression changed when he heard this.

He knew who Su Changhe was talking about.

The two of them immediately rushed out of the door.

At this moment, a cold and mocking voice suddenly rang out from a private room on the top floor.

“Isn’t this the famous Young Master Su of Qingyang City? Why are you running away as soon as you’ve arrived?”

Su Changhe’s entire body stiffened when he heard the voice.

‘I’m done for, who can save me?’

‘Damn it! Why did I decide to come out for a walk today? I should have checked the zodiac signs before leaving the house!’

Why did he end up meeting this fiend again?

Su Changhe’s tears almost rolled down his face. The owner of the voice was Zhuge Yueyue.

Hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s words, Su Changhe did not know whether to leave or to stay.

However, at this moment, he had no other choice. He could only turn around with a smile and look in Zhuge Yueyue’s direction.

“Uh, I didn’t expect to meet you here, fairy. It’s really fate!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue revealed a playful smile.

“Young Master Su seems to be in a hurry. Where are you going? Could it be that you’re deliberately avoiding me?”

“How is that possible? I’m sure you’ve misunderstood. I just remembered that I have some important things to deal with at home, so I’m in a hurry to return,” Su Changhe said guiltily as cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Zhuge Yueyue was here, but he wondered if Ye Xuan was beside her.

If that guy was here, then he was doomed!

‘No! I don’t want to die. I’m still in my prime and I haven’t continued the Su family lineage yet!’

At that moment, Su Changhe suddenly noticed a beautiful woman in a sky-blue robe walking out of the private room.

“Senior Sister, who is this person?” Feng Xiyun asked curiously.

Although Su Changhe’s intrusion had been very brief, it was still detected by them. Feng Xiyun had thought that Lin Dong had come to cause trouble for them.

At the mention of Su Changhe, Zhuge Yueyue almost could not hold back her laughter. Then, she told Feng Xiyun about everything that had happened.

After learning about the course of events, Feng Xiyun could not help but smile.

She had never expected his teacher to have such a playful personality. This Young Master Su’s heart was probably tormented by the shadow of her teacher, which was why he wanted to escape the moment he saw their figures.
