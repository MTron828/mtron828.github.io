599 God-Slaying Village

“Hehe, you’re flattering me, junior brother…”

Ao Lei laughed happily. He did not take Ye Xuan’s words to heart and simply laughed it off. Even though there were occasional conflicts and competition between the peaks, they were all part of the same sect.

In the face of danger, everyone would immediately unite and cooperate.

At this time, Yi Feng also piped up, “This is really beyond my expectations.”

!!

“Senior Brother Tian Xuan actually recruited such a terrifying genius for our sect before he passed away.”

“Junior Brother, you might be the youngest supreme realm cultivator in the history of the East continent!”

“With you around, I can finally put my mind at ease and focus on my cultivation.”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned. After a while, he quickly greeted Yi Feng, “Ye Xuan greets Martial Uncle Yi!”

“Alright, alright, there’s no need for pleasantries. With your level of talent, I’m afraid it won’t be long before I have to bow to you when I see you,” Yi Feng said with emotion.

“Martial Uncle Yi, don’t tease me. If I really make you bow to me, my lifespan will be shortened,” Ye Xuan replied with a smile.

Yi Feng simply laughed and turned to Ao Lei.

“Alright, Little Ao, the matters here have more or less been settled. I’ll bring a group of our cultivators back to the sect with me first.”

“Alright, Martial Uncle Yi.”

After a short while, Yi Feng brought more than half of the people back to the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

The war between the two sects had come to an end.

Everyone in the Immortal Divine sect had been killed. No one survived.

It was time to clean up the battlefield, and those who stayed behind had already started to harvest the treasures and resources.

In any case, the Immortal Divine sect had existed for a long time, so there was plenty of loot to go around.

Ye Xuan, however, was unbothered by this, as none of the treasures caught his eye. He simply hovered indifferently in the air.

Zhuge Yueyue’s eyes were still red after the massacre. She stood beside Ye Xuan expressionlessly.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan also felt very distressed.

Even if he had killed Mo Nan, so what? Zhuge Yueyue’s parents were not coming back…

Ye Xuan rubbed Zhuge Yueyue’s head and said softly, “Yueyue, there are some things that you have to let go of sooner or later.”

“The path of cultivation is a long one, and your parents would not want to see you like this.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue wiped her tears away and looked at Ye Xuan. Her eyes seemed to regain their light.

“I understand, Teacher. I’ve already taken my revenge, so I’ve fulfilled one of my wishes.”

“People should look forward. I’ll pull myself together and work hard on my cultivation.”

“I don’t expect myself to be as powerful as you, Teacher, but I hope that I’ll be able to help you in the future,” Zhuge Yueyue clenched her fist and said.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan did not say anything.

Instead, he turned to Ao Lei and said, “Senior Brother Ao, there’s nothing else for me to do here, so I’ll be accompanying my disciples back to the sect first.”

“Alright, have a safe journey, Junior Brother Ye,” Ao Lei replied, before once again directing his focus toward the battlefield clean-up work.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan waved to his two disciples and flew away. Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun followed him quickly.

He was not in a hurry this time, so he did not use the fiery phoenix technique, and simply flew along at a leisurely pace.

Just like that, after a few hours, they arrived at a village.

“God-slaying village?”

Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned when he saw the village’s signboard. Why did it sound so scary?

“Hurry up and run!”

“Don’t even think about escaping. I’ll catch you and beat you up today. Stop right there!”

While Ye Xuan was in a daze, the voices of two children could be heard.

On the pathway near the village entrance, a child seemed to be frightened by something and started to run.

“Hurry up and run! Why is this silly girl here again?”

One of the boys shouted loudly. As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared into the streets.

The other children also looked very nervous, running for their lives, as if there was a monster chasing them.

Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded. Then, he turned around to look for what was chasing them.

Behind the group of children, a petite girl with an angry face was shouting and chasing after the boys. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Her arms were flailing wildly, as if she wanted to grab all the boys. It was a funny scene.

“Stop right there…”

The little girl kept shouting as she chased them. She did not even notice Ye Xuan standing in front of her and tried to run past him.

Ye Xuan was stunned. He grabbed her, but her hands and feet were still in the same running motion, which made her look even more ridiculous.

This little girl was too silly. She had already been caught, but she actually did not notice?

When she finally reacted, she let out a cry and realized that her hands and feet were already off the ground.

Had she become so powerful? Had she actually learned to fly?

He looked at the little girl in his hand. She still had not realized that he had lifted her up. She was still waving her hands and feet and was still shouting at the other children.
