Chapter 138: This Item Is Fated With My Qingyun Sect

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Seeing this, the leader of the Mad Saber sect panicked.

This guy was so fast!

How strong was this guy?

Had he reached the peak of the core formation realm, or perhaps even the unity realm?

The leader of the Mad Saber sect had experienced Ye Xuan’s strength before, so he was very clear about the strength of a peak core formation realm cultivator.

This monk who appeared out of nowhere was terrifyingly fast.

Moreover, when his gaze fell on the monk, he could not help but feel a touch of fear in his heart.

It seemed that the monk’s strength was not inferior to Ye Xuan’s!

Immediately, the leader of the Mad Saber sect’s hand that was about to grab the fruits awkwardly stopped in their tracks. Then, he decisively chose to withdraw it and then revealed a faint smile.

“Master’s words make sense. These spiritual fruits are indeed fated with Buddhism!”

There was nothing he could do!

This monk’s strength seemed unfathomable. It was very likely that he could easily crush him to death. Who would dare to provoke him?

When the people around saw this, they turned pale with fright.

Just what kind of existence was this monk? He could actually make a top-notch core formation realm expert submit with just words?

They naturally knew that the leader of the Mad Saber sect’s smile was extremely forced, and his eyes were filled with fear.

It was obvious that this monk’s cultivation far surpassed his, or else he would not have shown such an expression.

They had not expected that these spiritual fruits would attract the attention of so many big shots.

It was one thing for a top-tier core formation realm expert to descend, but why was there an even stronger one now? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Could it be that there was something special about these spirit moon fruits? Could it be that they also had some effect on top-tier core formation realm experts?

“Good, good, good! Almsgiver is indeed an intelligent person!”

Seeing this, the monk revealed a satisfied smile.

Although the spirit moon tree was of no use to him, his thoughts were the same as the leader of the Mad Saber sect. He could bring it back for his disciples.

Soon after, the monk extended his hand with a smile and was about to take the spirit moon fruit tree away.

At this moment, an ice-cold voice suddenly rang out.

“Hehe, stinky monk, you said that the tree is fated with your Buddhist sect? Is everything fated with your Buddhist sect?”

“Could it be that all monks are as shameless as you?”

This voice was like thunder, resounding across the entire sky.

Everyone looked up, but they did not see anyone appear. Still, they were immensely frightened.

A cultivator who could achieve such a feat would possess extremely terrifying strength. Moreover, that voice did not hide its killing intent.

When the leader of the Mad Saber sect heard the voice, his heart immediately skipped a beat.

He was too familiar with this voice!

Immediately after, he hurriedly raised his head and saw two figures suddenly appear in the air!

Whoosh!

An extremely handsome young man and a slightly pale-faced woman revealed themselves.

Ye Xuan!

It was indeed this guy!

His body started instinctively trembling. He would never forget this voice. It had long been carved into the depths of his soul.

However, Ye Xuan had already reached the unity realm. Why would he be interested in the spirit moon tree?

Then remembered that Ye Xuan was an elder of the Qingyun sect. The spirit moon tree could be given to the cultivators of the Qingyun sect.

However, the monk was not weak either. A great battle was likely to take place.

Thinking this, his eyes narrowed.

He knew Ye Xuan’s character very well. If Ye Xuan decided to make a move, it would definitely be earth-shattering.

He started thinking about how to escape.

The monk also heard Ye Xuan’s voice. Not only did he not stop what he was doing, he even hastened his pace to grab the spirit moon tree.

As the spirit moon tree left the soil, it shrank rapidly and turned into a resplendent silver root, sinking into the bowl in the monk’s hand.

“Almsgiver, why did you insult a Buddhist?”

After the monk grabbed the spirit moon tree, he turned around leisurely and his gaze fell on Ye Xuan.

A hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes!

Ye Xuan had called him a stinky monk, which undoubtedly made him very dissatisfied.

Had it been any other ordinary cultivator, he would have sent him to meet Buddha with one palm.

However, his spiritual sense failed to probe the cultivation level of the young man.

“Hand over the spirit moon tree and I’ll spare your life!”

Ye Xuan looked at the monk indifferently.

Unfortunately, this monk was not one he was looking for..

However, looking at the way they did things, they might be from the same Buddhist faction.

Perhaps they were fellow disciples..

“The spirit moon tree is fated with our Buddhist sect. It already belongs to our Buddhist sect. I’m afraid it’s inappropriate for you to act so tyrannically, almsgiver.”

The monk’s gaze fell on Ye Xuan, and his gaze gradually turned cold.

His uncertainty regarding Ye Xuan’s strength was the only thing keeping him from attacking.

“Hehe, another one talking about fate with Buddhism. You stinking monks are all the same!”

Ye Xuan did not even bother to waste his breath. He then waved his sleeve and emitted a gentle power that carried Huang Ling steadily to the ground.

This monk had also reached the unity realm.

If a fight broke out between them, the energy shockwaves would not be something that Huang Ling could withstand.

Huang Ling naturally knew Ye Xuan’s intentions. As soon as she landed on the ground, she immediately retreated.

Whoosh!

Ye Xuan reached out and grabbed his God-slaying Sword, which started to emit terrifying blood-red sword qi patterns.

“It looks like almsgiver is planning to snatch it by force!”

Seeing this scene, the monk’s expression immediately became gloomy.

What kind of joke was this? The spirit moon tree had fallen into his hands. How could he hand it over?

Since this guy was reckless and wanted to make things difficult for him, he would just send him to meet Buddha with a slap.

This guy looked so young. Even if he was powerful, it was impossible for him to have reached the unity realm.

To the best of his knowledge, no genius cultivator in the Nanzhou Region had ever reached the unity realm at such a young age.

“This spirit moon tree is fated with my Qingyun sect.”

A cold smile hung on the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth as he imitated his opponent’s tone.
