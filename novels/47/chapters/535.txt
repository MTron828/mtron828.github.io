536 White-Browed Old Man (Part 3)

Hearing this and seeing her get into a fighting stance, Ye Xuan suddenly turned around and said, “Junior Sister, with your senior brother here, do you really need to make a move? Just stay back and leave the rest to me.”

Ye Xuan did not forget to wink at Yanran, whose face instantly turned red.

She felt a little angry, and moved behind Ye Xuan while saying, “Keep pretending. Don’t ask for my help if you can’t win later.”

Although she said that, she did not put away the sword she had drawn. She was prepared to help out if the situation turned bad.

Ye Xuan only smiled when he saw this scene and did not say anything. Although Yanran looked quite cold, she was too silly and cute.

At this moment, Ye Xuan once again looked at the white-browed old man and said, “Old man, your mouth is saying things that your body can’t do. If you truly mean what you said, then come at me and stop yapping!”

“B*stard, you’re simply seeking your own destruction!”

The white-browed old man could no longer suppress his anger. His reputation had been ruined by this little guy. Normally, everyone would be frightened by his mere presence, but this guy actually dared to insult him so openly.

“Little fellow, I’ll show you what I’m capable of today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he threw a punch that caused space to distort.

Ye Xuan did not let his guard down. After all, the white-browed old man was an advanced-stage supreme realm expert.

He immediately switched to using the Boundless Palm technique and slapped the incoming fist.

In an instant, the fist and a palm collided with each other, creating a loud boom. Then, they both took a few steps back.

However, in terms of the number of steps they were pushed back, the white-browed old man emerged ahead. After all, his cultivation level was higher than Ye Xuan’s.

Still, that did not mean that he would lose.

“I didn’t expect you to be so strong, little guy.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The white-browed old man could feel the sting of Ye Xuan’s blow on his fist. That punch was to test Ye Xuan’s strength.

“Hehe, it’s just so-so,”

Ye Xuan was not feeling any better in reality, his calmness was just an act. However, he was confident that his magic artifacts and divine powers would be able to bridge the cultivation gap between him and the white-browed old man.

“Haha, I really want to see just how long you can continue to act tough.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the white-browed old man launched a full-force attack. His aura was even comparable to the four powerful beasts in the distance.

The space around them began to tremble violently and thunder rumbled above them.

Seeing this, Yanran was ready to act at any time, keeping a close eye on the battle situation. If Ye Xuan was in any danger, she would immediately take action.

However, to her surprise, as time passed, she found that her senior brother was not at a disadvantage.

“He’s too strong! Not only is his sword technique astonishing, but he has also cultivated this palm technique to perfection.”

“It looks light, but feels heavy. What a strange but superb palm technique.”

Yanran was admiring Ye Xuan’s Boundless Palm technique. As powerful as the Great Desolation technique was, it could not be compared to Ye Xuan’s sword and palm techniques, which were immortal-grade divine powers.

Watching the battle between Ye Xuan and the white-browed old man, Yanran could not help but feel her blood boil.

‘If I had that palm technique, I would no longer need to fear the white-browed old man.’

However, she felt very helpless. After all, there was no palm technique like Ye Xuan’s in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. This puzzled her.

Logically speaking, was the Great Wilderness divine sect in the East continent not supposed to be weaker than the one in the Heaven continent? How did they have something like this palm technique, not to mention Ye Xuan’s sword technique.

She really wanted to learn and cultivate those two divine powers.

Yanran looked in Ye Xuan’s direction. If Ye Xuan turned around, he would definitely have seen the desire in her eyes.

After all, Yanran had spent almost all her time in the Great Wilderness Divine sect and had not come into contact with worldly affairs. Therefore, her thoughts were very pure, and she was wholly obsessed with becoming stronger.

Bang! Bang!

In the sky, Ye Xuan and the white-browed old man clashed again and again.

As time passed, the white-browed old man became even more shocked.

‘Why does this young man have such a powerful palm technique?’

He felt a little depressed. With his strength, he should have been able to easily defeat this young man, who seemed to have just reached the supreme realm. The fact that they had exchanged hundreds of blows without determining a winner was simply making a mockery of the white-browed old man’s strength.
