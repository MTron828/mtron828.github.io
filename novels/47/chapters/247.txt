The strength of the Qingyun sect could not keep up with Ye Xuan’s growth speed.

Therefore, he could only take the initiative to try and improve the overall strength of the Qingyun sect by giving them the heavenly treasures, martial techniques, cultivation techniques, and pills that he had looted from his battles.

After all, a majority of these were useless to Ye Xuan, and even his disciples.

Instead of leaving them to rot, it was better to give them to the Qingyun sect.

Elder Lin Qing was completely stunned, and her eyes were filled with shock as she looked at Ye Xuan.

Then, ye Xuan flicked his sleeve, and a storage ring suddenly appeared in front of Elder Lin Qing.

“I’ll have to trouble elder Lin Qing to pass on the martial techniques and cultivation methods that I just transmitted to you to the sect master and the other elders. As for these heavenly treasures, I’ll leave them to you to distribute.”

“I still have some things to explain to these disciples, so we’ll be heading over to the cultivation room,” Ye Xuan said.

Elder Lin Qing nodded numbly, still immersed in the shock of what had just happened.

She had never seen this many heavenly treasures before, and it likely exceeded the amount contained within the entirety of the Great Qian Dynasty.

As soon as they arrived at the cultivation room, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense swept through the Zhu Tuyuan and the others’ spatial storage equipment, briefly sorting out the treasures within.

Ye Xuan also discovered something interesting. Every unity realm or stronger expert would basically hide their storage rings in their seas of consciousness.

Guang Liang, Zhu Tuyuan, and Qian Daoliu were all pattern condensation realm experts, and were old monsters who had been around for hundreds, or even thousands of years. Even though they naturally used up a terrifying amount of heavenly treasures for cultivation, Ye Xuan still found a lot of useful things. There were spiritual items that could increase one’s innate bone value and comprehension value, as well as heavenly treasures that could strengthen special constitutions.

Other than that, there were also some extremely rare alchemy herbs.

“It’s time to gain some rewards!”

After Ye Xuan withdrew his spiritual sense, he turned his gaze to Yue and the other two.

“I will now teach you higher level cultivation methods and martial techniques, as well as give you better pills and artifacts,” Ye Xuan said.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Yue and Li Qingyan were already used to this. Even though they had yet to fully comprehend what Ye Xuan had previously taught them, it was a blessing to have such a teacher!

They could basically get stronger continuously each month.

“Alright, Teacher!”

Zhao Yuyan followed her senior sisters’ lead.

“I’ll impart cultivation methods and martial techniques first!”

“Yan’er, in the future, you have to work hard on your cultivation. Only then can you use the high-level cultivation techniques that I’ve taught you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan reached out and gently tapped Zhao Yuyan’s forehead.

Out of all of his disciples, Zhao Yuyan had the greatest potential.

However, due to her age, Zhao Yuyan was also the weakest.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Lightning Tribulation Sword technique (Top-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 80x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Million Thunderbolt sword technique (Low-grade Heaven-rank).”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Boundless Sword technique (Low-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 200x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Godslaying Sword Formation (High-grade Earth-rank).”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Nihility Sword Defense technique (Middle-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 70x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Void Sword realm (High-grade Earth-rank).”

System notifications kept ringing out in Ye Xuan’s mind.

While Zhao Yuyan was still in a daze, trying to digest the martial techniques and cultivation methods that Ye Xuan had imparted to her, he had already moved on to his next target, Li Qingyan.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Million Thunderbolt sword technique (Low-grade Heaven-rank), the host has received a randomized 18x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Lightning Tribulation Void sword technique (Middle-grade Heaven-rank).”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Godslaying Sword Formation (High-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 50x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Heaven-splitting Sword Formation (Top-grade Earth-rank).”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Void Sword Realm(High-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 123x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Endless Realm technique (Low-grade Heaven-rank).”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s finger changed targets to Yue’s forehead.

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Lightning Tribulation Void sword technique (Middle-grade Heaven-rank), the host has received a randomized 71x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Divine Lightning Purple Cloud sword technique (Top-grade Heaven-rank).”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Heaven-splitting Sword Formation (Top-grade Earth-rank), the host has received a randomized 268x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Minor Realm Sword Formation (Middle-grade Heaven-rank).”

“Ding! As the host has taught his disciple the Endless Realm technique (Low-grade Heaven-rank), the host has received a randomized 38x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Absolute Realm technique (Middle-grade Heaven-rank).” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yue and the others were all stunned.

The cultivation methods and martial techniques that Ye Xuan taught them were too advanced, obscure and profound, especially for Yue and Li Qingyan. They could not even begin to comprehend them.

From the looks of it, they would only be able to glean insights into these techniques after their teacher helped to increase their cultivation level and comprehension value..

‘My cultivation methods and martial techniques have finally reached Heaven rank,” Ye Xuan said inwardly.

These would be difficult even for him to cultivate. More importantly, in order to truly unleash the power of such a high-level cultivation method, one had to possess a powerful martial intents.

For example, the Three Thousand Thunder sword technique that Ye Xuan had previously cultivated could not be used to its full potential without sword intent.
