550 Killing Spree

“This… Why do you have that sword?”

Ou Yunhai asked with a trembling voice.

It was not just Ou Yunhai who was in disbelief; everyone else was too. They could not believe what they were seeing.

When the assassin leader saw the sword, his eyes were filled with desire.

‘Hehe, it’s a divine-rank sword? This little guy is really rich. I didn’t expect him to have such a precious sword!’

As he muttered to himself, the assassin leader quietly moved behind Ye Xuan.

Moments later, he unleashed a powerful attack, trying to take Ye Xuan’s life while he was unprepared.

“Dodge quickly!”

In the sky, Yanran quickly warned Ye Xuan after seeing this. She instantly went berserk, trying to rush to Ye Xuan’s side to help.

At this moment, a loud bang was heard.

Just as the assassin leader thought his plan had succeeded, the weapon in his hand was instantly cut in half by Ye Xuan’s Cloud Heaven Sword!

“Ah?”

The assassin leader was dumbfounded, and beads of cold sweat rolled down his face. His treasured weapon had been destroyed just like that? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Xuan stared at the assassin leader and said with a sneer, “It seems that you also want to die. Then I will send you on your way first!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan used the Flora sword technique.

An extremely terrifying sword aura swept out, causing all of the cultivators present to turn pale.

“Let’s join forces and kill Ye Xuan first!”

At this critical moment, Ou Yunhai decided to direct everyone’s focus to Ye Xuan.

The moment Ye Xuan took out the Cloud Heaven Sword, Ou Yunhai understood that no one here would be able to defeat Ye Xuan alone.

If they wanted to defeat Ye Xuan, they could only join forces.

Otherwise, with Ye Xuan present, they would have no way of competing for the immortal heavenly treasure.

At that moment, all of the cultivators silently surrounded Ye Xuan.

Ye Xuan was still very calm and disdainful when he saw that he had suddenly become the center of attention.

“Haha, is that it? If you have the ability, then come at me. Numbers don’t matter! I’ll kill all of you anyway!”

“Tsk, Ye Xuan, so what if you have that powerful magic weapon? You’ve only just reached the supreme realm. As long as we gang up on you, you’ll run out of spiritual power sooner or later,” Ou Yunhai said with a sharp tone. Then, he activated his own magic artifact and infused it with his spiritual power.”

“Well said. This day next year will be your death anniversary. I’ve taken a fancy to your sword,” the assassin leader chimed in as he stared at the sword in Ye Xuan’s hand.

At this time, they were full of confidence. No matter how powerful Ye Xuan was, he could not possibly kill everyone present.

“Cut the crap, just bring it on,” Ye Xuan replied heroically. From the beginning until now, he did not show any signs of panic.

“Haha, I’d like to see how long your arrogance lasts,” Ou Yunhai roared and immediately launched an attack.

Seeing this, everyone also launched their attacks at the same time, leaving Ye Xuan with no space to dodge.

“Give me your life!”

At this moment, dense attacks descended upon Ye Xuan like rain.

At this critical moment, Ye Xuan’s entire body seemed to have stopped, and he did not move at all.

Seeing this, the attackers were dumbfounded.

What was Ye Xuan doing? Could it be that he had already accepted his fate and stopped resisting?

Impossible…

At this moment, an earth-shattering sword aura wreaked havoc, causing a flashing lightning and rumbling thunder.

The onlookers were scared out of their wits. They watched in a daze as Ye Xuan raised the Cloud Heaven Sword.

When Ye Xuan opened his eyes, a ray of light seemed to flash across them. He said calmly, “You guys… are all going to die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he swung his sword in an arc, killing three supreme realm experts instantly!

Then, one move after another, Ye Xuan used the second move of the Flora sword technique. With the sword in his hand, he continuously killed more and more people. The second move of the Flora sword technique increased his strength by dozens of times!

Fortunately for them, Ye Xuan had not mastered the third move, otherwise all of his enemies would already be dead.

Boom… Boom…

One after another, explosions sounded. In just a few breaths of time, there were countless casualties among his enemies.

Ye Xuan seemed to be addicted to killing at this time. No matter who it was, as long as they attacked, he would swing his sword and end their lives.

Ou Yunhai was also in a sorry state. If he had not used his magic artifact, he would already be dead.

On the other side, the assassin leader’s eyes, which were originally filled with greed, were now filled with panic. He was trembling with fear.

He had long lost the will to fight and hurriedly tried to escape.

However, it was too late. Ye Xuan had already painted a target on his back, and he could only widen his eyes unwillingly as he watched his body being split into two by Ye Xuan.

“Ah…”

With a shrill cry, the assassin leader’s body gradually collapsed, and even his soul was shattered by the sword.

Seeing this, Ou Yunhai was scared out of his wits. He looked in Ye Xuan’s direction in panic.
