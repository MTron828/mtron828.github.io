556 The Great Battle (Part 2)

“Mo Xuan Guan?”

This person was the Elder Taiyin’s junior brother, and was also an expert on the verge of reaching the supreme realm.

When they saw Mo Xuan Guan appear, Huang Daning and the others were overjoyed.

“You people from the Great Wilderness Divine sect are quite arrogant. You killed a member of our sect openly. You’re clearly disregarding us, aren’t you?”

!!

Mo Xuan Guan glared at Yuelun and scolded angrily.

However, Yuelun only smiled indifferently and replied impolitely, “So what?”

After hearing this, everyone froze.

“Heavens! Are the Immortal Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sect going to fall out completely?”

At this moment, many onlookers were excited.

No one expected Yuelun, who had always been gentle and elegant, would actually have such a domineering attitude.

It was indeed as she said. So what?

In the first few rounds of battle between the Great Wilderness Divine sect and the Immortal Divine sect, the latter had lost all of them.

“Impudent!”

Mo Xuan Guan was enraged. Even though Yuelun had only said two words, it was obvious that she looked down upon the Immortal Divine sect.

If he tolerated this, everyone would treat the Immortal Divine sect as a joke in the future. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Moments later, he made his move. The aura of a peak-level mystic lord realm expert swept out, exuding a strong sense of oppression.

However, Yuelun remained calm and unruffled. She took a few steps back and dodged the attack.

At this moment, the spectators finally realized that Yuelun was also on the verge of reaching the supreme realm!

“Oh my god, Teacher’s also about to reach the supreme realm!”

Li Hanyi exclaimed in shock.

A battle was imminent between these two evenly-matched combatants.

Mo Xuan Guan was even more shocked now. He understood that if this situation continued, he would be the one to suffer in the end.

“Yuelun,” he said viciously, “Your Great Wilderness Dvine sect really wants to completely shed all pretenses of cordiality with my Immortal Divine sect this time, huh?”

Before Yuelun could respond, a burst of laughter resounded.

“Hehehe!”

Moments later, a Daoist in a black robe rushed over and sent Mo Xuan Guan flying back hundreds of steps with a single strike.

It was Gao Shun who had come over.

“Uncle Gao is here!”

The disciples of the Great Wilderness Divine sect were surprised. Chief Gao Shun, who had always been a lone wolf, had actually come over to help?

“Hehe, why do I find Martial Uncle Gao more pleasing to the eye?”

Feng Xiyun smiled and muttered to herself.

Even Zhuge Yueyue was smiling at this moment. This martial uncle of hers was usually quite crafty and devious in the sect.

However, when he was in the outside world, he would protect the sect’s disciples at all times.

It was as if Martial Uncle Gao had two personalities. Sometimes, it was really hard to tell whether he was good or bad.

Right at this time, Gao Shun said very heroically, “The Great Wilderness Divine sect will never back down!”

“Mo Xuan Guan, since you’re so arrogant, let’s have a good fight!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his saber and unleashed several saber beams toward Mo Xuan Guan.

Gao Shun’s combat strength was higher than Yuelun’s, and he had more divine powers at his disposal.

Seeing Gao Shun act, Yuelun stepped back to watch the show.

At this moment, the pressure on Mo Xuan Guan was mounting, and he had no chance to fight back.

He had no choice but to turn around and say to Huang Daning and the others angrily, “Why are you still standing there like an idiot? Hurry up and come help!”

After hearing this, Huang Daning and the others finally regained their senses and immediately gathered their strength to help Mo Xuan Guan.

However, Yuelun did not watch this happen idly. She released an ice-cold aura and stood in front of Huang Daning and the others as she spoke arrogantly, “If you have the ability, then try taking another step forward.”

At this moment, the dozens of cultivators from the Immortal Divine sect did not dare to move. They just stood there stupidly.

“Haha, well done, Junior Sister Yuelun!”

When this voice appeared, Li Dahai and a few others, who had just been teleported out of the ancient tomb, made their appearance and flew over to Yuelun.

At this moment, most of the chiefs of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had arrived. Only Ye Xuan and one other were not present.

Yuelun turned around to look at her senior brothers and realized that they had all reached the peak of the mystic lord realm.

Although she was shocked, her expression was also full of joy.

Li Dahai walked to the front arrogantly and said with his head held high, “Do you think you can provoke the people of the Great Wilderness Divine sect as you please? Given your arrogance, I’ll have to teach you a good lesson today.”

As he spoke, a long spear appeared in his hands, and he quickly lined up the shot and hurled it at Mo Xuan Guan.

Li Dahai was clearly a ruthless person. He did not care about the reason at all, and launched an attack without hesitation in solidarity with Gao Shun and Yuelun.

After today’s battle, people seemed to have recalled the time when Chief Tian Xuan was still alive. At that time, the Great Wilderness Divine sect was an existence that no one dared to provoke, after all, Chief Tian Xuan was a peak-level supreme realm expert. Who would dare to provoke him?

At this moment, after Li Dahai’s flurry of attacks, the people from the Immortal Divine sect fled. They had suffered heavy casualties.

...

Seeing this, Mo Xuan Guan was furious and said fiercely, “Don’t just stand there like idiots. Attack with all your might. Don’t show any mercy.”

At his command, everyone from the Immortal Divine sect took action and joined in the chaotic battle.

Hua Rufeng chimed in aggressively at this moment, “Hehe, let’s go! Let’s teach this bunch of b*stards a lesson today!”
