604 Are They Swollen?

“Junior Sister, this little bird is someone else’s pet. Don’t hit it.”

“When we get back to cloud sky peak, I’ll take you somewhere to catch a unicorn to play with, okay?”

Zhuge Yueyue said patiently. She thought of the gentle unicorns at the rear area of Cloud Sky peak and tried to appease her.

“Unicorn? What is that?”

As she muttered to herself, Xiang Yun let her imagination run wild. In her mind, these unicorns were just little birds with horns.

However, after thinking about it carefully, she felt that this image was really too ugly, and her small head kept shaking.

Seeing this, Zhuge Yueyue tried to describe them to her.

“Unicorns actually have a unique glow on their bodies, and they are really beautiful.”

“Each one of them has wings, so you can ride them and fly in the sky.”

“Alright! Then we’ll go back and catch the unicorn, I want to ride it!”

As they conversed, they flew and time flew, and the four of them eventually reached the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

Along the way to Cloud Sky peak, they also met people who had returned from the Immortal Divine sect.

After seeing that Ye Xuan and the others had returned, Yuelun came over, smiling.

“Junior Brother Ye, didn’t you say you wanted to take your disciples out to see the world? Why did you return so quickly?”

Yuelun asked in confusion. When she noticed Xiang Yun, she was even more stunned.

Why did he bring back a little girl?

Could it be that Ye Xuan had already married and had children before he became a cultivator?

Thinking this, she asked somewhat hesitantly, “This little girl is?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan turned around and looked at Xiang Yun, who was already playing with some of the female cultivators from Water Sky peak.

These girls were amused by the little girl, and were all laughing their hearts out.

Seeing this scene, Ye Xuan did not know what to say. He had brought back a special disciple…

Ye Xuan then smiled and said, “We met this little girl on the way. She’s all alone and has no family, so I brought her back and accepted her as my disciple.”

After hearing this, Yuelun instantly felt as if a huge burden had been lifted off her chest.

So it was just a disciple…

She was indeed too anxious. However, it was only natural. After all, when Ye Xuan first entered the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was already of marriageable age. If he really had a wife in the mortal world and had a daughter, it would not be unusual at all.

“So she’s Junior Brother Ye’s newest disciple. This little girl is so quick-witted and cute. Junior Brother, why don’t you let me be her teacher?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan laughed out loud and replied, “That’s not impossible, but you’ll have to trade your chief disciple for her.”

Yuelun kicked Ye Xuan. He was still thinking about her chief disciple!

‘This won’t do. I have to tell my disciple not to get too close to Ye Xuan when I get back. He is too conniving.’

“Cough, cough. Junior Brother Ye, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head back first.”

Yuelun immediately turned to leave with her disciples after saying this, afraid that Ye Xuan would take her away.

At this moment, the girls from Cloud Sky peak had surrounded Xiang Yun and were constantly pinching her smooth and tender face.

Yinyun was not happy about being pinched here and there. She put her hands on her waist and said, “Enough, enough! You can’t pinch me anymore. If you do, I will explode!”

“Oh my god, she’s so cute.”

After hearing Xiang Yun’s words, the girls became even more excited and pinched even harder.

Xiang Yun immediately felt uncomfortable. However, at this moment, she spotted Yuelun walking over and her brain froze.

Then, she turned to look at the young ladies surrounding her. She tugged at Zhuge Yueyue’s arm.

“Big Sister, why are these girls so swollen? Did they get beaten up? Why are their chests so fat?”

“Just look at their chests!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s face darkened and she rubbed Xiang Yun’s head.

This little girl was too straightforward, saying everything she thought of immediately.

So many girls in the Great Wilderness Divine sect wanted to have a body like Yuelun’s. This little girl was really insensible.

Xiang Yun’s head hurt from the rubbing, and she instantly shouted in pain. Tears were already welling up in her eyes, and she could not understand why the big sister was hurting her.

However, before her tears fell, she looked at Zhuge Yueyue again, her eyes shining as she spoke, “Heavens! It turns out that warm big sister is quite swollen too!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Warm big sister, tell me quickly, which brat beat you up like this? When I get stronger, I’ll definitely help you take care of him!”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue was rendered speechless. However, she did not know how to explain it to her.

Seeing this, Feng Xiyun quickly moved closer to Xiang Yun and said very patiently, “Junior Sister, the one you saw just now was Teacher’s Senior Sister. You can’t address her casually.”

“We usually call her Chief Yuelun or Martial Aunt Yuelun. You can also call her that.”

“Also, this isn’t fat or swollen from being beaten. It just grows like this.”

“You’re still young and might not know these things, but when you get older, you’ll also become like this.”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun started crying.

She would become swollen there too?

“I don’t want to become like this. It’s too inconvenient to fight!”
