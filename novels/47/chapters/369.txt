370 Eating Well

Once Ye Xuan saw that Zhuge Yueyue’s mood had calmed down, he sighed in relief.

There was no need for his disciple to shoulder the burdens of the world alone. Thinking this, he was reminded of Shangguan Wan’er.

‘I wonder how my precious tsundere disciple is doing.’

It was a rhetorical question, since he had used the power of karma back then to predict the future before he left the Tianyuan continent.

Yue, Shangguan Wan’er, and the others would become the peerless great empresses of the Tianyuan continent in the future, leading the human race to the peak.

Then, Ye Xuan turned his gaze to his newest disciple again.

His actions just now were to tell her that even if she had lost her parents, there were still people who would treat her well and cared about her.

However, what made Ye Xuan feel helpless was that although Zhuge Yueyue seemed to act like a normal girl in front of him, she was still rather distant and aloof with others.

This was not only related to Zhuge Yueyue’s personality, but also the profound ice divine bone that she had awakened.

A cultivator’s divine bone would have a great influence on their character. Although the profound ice divine bone was a high-grade divine bone and would greatly enhance Zhuge Yueyue’s cultivation, it would also have a subtle influence on her character.

However, these were all small problems. As long as this girl could overcome the pain and trauma of her past, it mattered not that her temperament was a little cold.

Ye Xuan spoke again.

“Now that you have reached the first level of the divine mystic realm, starting tomorrow, I will teach you the Cloud Sky sword controlling technique.”

“You should rest today. Remember, a balance between work and rest is imperative. Don’t overextend yourself and damage your cultivation foundation.”

“Understand?”

“En!” Zhuge Yueyue nodded her head seriously.

“Teacher, it’s getting late. You must be hungry. Do you want me to make you something to eat?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Zhuge Yueyue suddenly asked Ye Xuan a question out of the blue.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan felt a little guilty.

‘I almost forgot. This girl has just stepped into the divine mystic realm. Her physical body is still unable to completely abstain from food. She still needs to rely on food to replenish her energy.’

‘Ahem, ahem, ahem, I’m really not a qualified teacher!’

Ye Xuan could not help but display an embarrassed expression.

He had been so focused on his cultivation that he had completely forgotten that his disciple was alone in the courtyard.

It was unknown how this little girl managed to survive.

After all, Cloud Sky peak was different from the other peaks in the Great Wilderness Divine sect. On this huge peak, other than Ye Xuan, there was only Zhuge Yueyue. There were no servant disciples in charge of clothing, food, accommodation, and logistics.

Over the past hundred years, Ye Xuan had basically been living a self-sufficient life. As such, he had forgotten what needed to be done with an extra person around.

Fortunately, this girl was quite smart and knew how to take care of herself. If she had really starved to death outside, things would have been very awkward.

Of course, even though there were no servant disciples on Cloud Sky peak, the Great Wilderness Divine sect would still send the ingredients purchased by the sect to the peak every once in a while.

“Alright! Then let’s try your cooking,” Ye Xuan nodded with a smile.

He was also looking forward to seeing what his precious disciple could do.

On the Tian Yuan continent, neither Yue or Li Qingyan knew how to cook. Shangguan Wan’er would never have bothered, and Zhao Yuyan had her mother to cook for her.

Here, once a cultivator reached the materialization realm, they would be able to fast for long periods of time. Once they reached the void realm, eating for sustenance became completely unnecessary.

Of course, if they really wanted to eat, they could do so.

“Alright, Teacher, please wait for a moment.”

When Zhuge Yueyue heard Ye Xuan’s words, she immediately displayed an excited expression, then ran to the kitchen to start preparing food.

This was a chance to show off her skills and repay her teacher a little bit.

Looking at Zhuge Yueyue’s excited expression, Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched. An ominous feeling arose in his heart.

What would be presented in front of him later?

Would it be edible?

Ye Xuan immediately regretted his decision.

After that, Ye Xuan went to the main hall in the courtyard and waited for Zhuge Yueyue.

After some time, she carried a tray over and placed it on the table.

Each plate on the tray was filled with fragrant dishes that looked appetizing.

‘Well, at least on the surface, it looks good, right?’ Ye Xuan was still a little hesitant.

“Teacher, Please try these dishes.”

After Zhuge Yueyue had placed all the dishes on the table, she sat in front of the table and looked at Ye Xuan with anticipation.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched.

It seemed that he had no choice now.

Forget it! If it was bad, he would just have to bear with it.

Ye Xuan gritted his teeth, picked up a piece of tender meat with his chopsticks, and stuffed it into his mouth.

When his tongue touched the meat, Ye Xuan’s eyes shone.

The meat was fresh and tender, and the taste was superb as well.

‘This girl’s cooking skills are not bad. This bodes well for my life in this world.’

“What do you think, Teacher? Is it delicious?”

Zhuge Yueyue asked anxiously, her eyes full of anticipation.

These dishes were the dishes she was best at, but she did not know if they would suit her teacher’s appetite.

“Your cooking skills are pretty good, especially for this meat dish right here. Whether it’s the degree of freshness or the taste, it’s pretty good!”

“I didn’t expect you to have such skills. You’ve really impressed me,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

When Zhuge Yueyue heard this, her heart was filled with joy as she said proudly, “Of course. These dishes are my mother’s specialty. I’ve been learning from her since I was a child.”
