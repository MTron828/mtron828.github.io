397 True Dragon Precious Bone

In the cultivation world, as long as one was strong enough, one could have absolute freedom.

Feng Xiyun wanted to control her own fate and free herself from the confines of the royal family.

“Mm! That’s good!” Hearing this, Ye Xuan displayed a satisfied look.

“What I just said is common knowledge in the cultivation world. Take your time and digest the information. Don’t bite off more than you can chew.”

Ye Xuan looked up at the night sky.

The moon was already high up in the sky, and its dazzling silver light illuminated the surroundings.

Zhuge Yueyue and Xin’er had yet to return.

Ye Xuan pondered as to whether he should start imparting cultivation techniques to Feng Xiyun right now.

However, after some thought, Ye Xuan gave up on the idea.

Feng Xiyun had just condensed a divine bone and her cultivation foundation was not stable yet. He could not proceed too hastily.

As such, he said, “The divine bone in your body was condensed from the fusion of the ape beast’s precious bone and your own bloodline. From today onward, you will slowly refine the power within the precious bone according to the method I taught you.”

“As for divine powers, that will have to wait until your cultivation foundation has been stabilized.”

“Alright, Teacher!” Feng Xiyun nodded seriously.

She could naturally sense the power contained within the precious bone, and guessed that her cultivation would soar once she absorbed this power.

When she thought of this, Feng Xiyun felt excited. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She had been so lucky to find such a good teacher who was willing to give her such valuable resources and heavenly treasures. This precious bone was something that even her father would treasure.

Meeting Ye Xuan was truly a blessing. Fortunately, she had not joined another holy land before this, or she would have missed out on this opportunity.

“Alright! It just so happens that your Senior Sister hasn’t returned yet, so you should first consolidate your cultivation foundation according to the method I taught you!”

“En!” Feng Xiyun nodded obediently as she calmed her heart down and quickly entered a state of meditation.

Soon after, Feng Xiyun slowly circulated her spiritual power according to the method Ye Xuan had taught her. While consolidating her cultivation foundation, she also slowly absorbed the power within the precious bone.

Seeing her cultivate seriously, Ye Xuan nodded in approval.

At this moment, a system notification rang out.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the precious bone of a heaven realm descendant of an ancient beast, the host has received a randomized 10,000x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the precious bone of the true dragon, one of the top ten ancient beasts (incomplete)!”

‘What?’

‘The precious bone of a true dragon?’

‘F*ck, I’ve struck it rich!’

Ye Xuan almost jumped up in excitement.

Of course, he also noticed the addendum added to the end of the system notification. Although it was the precious bone of the true dragon. It was only broken and incomplete.

Even so, this precious bone still contained the power and bloodline of a true dragon. It could be called a rare heavenly treasure.

Back on the Tianyuan continent, the true dragon race had only left behind a tiny bit of their bloodline, yet those mixed-blood dragons easily dominated the Endless Sea.

They were formidable enemies of the human race’s great emperor realm experts.

‘This girl is really a lucky star. A 10,000x multiplier!’

Ye Xuan could not contain his smile.

Ye Xuan immediately took out the precious bone of the true dragon from the system’s storage space.

An ancient aura suddenly swept out, and it seemed like a true dragon was roaring.

The precious bone of the true dragon in Ye Xuan’s hand was golden, and there were mysterious dragon patterns engraved on the bone that flowed along it like veins.

In order to avoid any incidents, Ye Xuan hurriedly flicked his sleeves and isolated its aura from the surroundings. Then he immediately started to absorb the power of the true dragon’s precious bone.

Ye Xuan’s spiritual power swept out and wrapped itself around the precious bone, slowly refining and absorbing the power of the true dragon within.

As time passed, Ye Xuan’s body was gradually covered in a layer of mysterious golden dragon patterns, which made him look somewhat holy.

“Ugh…”

Ye Xuan frowned and groaned, his face was contorted in pain.

The infusion of the true dragon’s power, tempered Ye Xuan’s meridians and bones with lightning, transforming them.

The true dragon’s power was too overbearing. Were it not for the Chaos Heart technique and the Golden Lotus of the Great Dao, Ye Xuan’s meridians might have been destroyed.

As Ye Xuan continued to absorb the power of the runes within the precious bone, his entire body gradually swelled up as if he was about to explode from the power.

Sensing this, Ye Xuan’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly circulated the Chaos Heart technique and guided this overbearing true dragon power into the five spirit seas in his body.

In an instant, Ye Xuan experienced a great breakthrough, from the first level of the heaven realm to the peak of the fifth level of the heaven realm. He was one step away from reaching the mystic lord realm.

The aura in his body continued to tremble, and his heart was beating so fast that it felt like even the mountains and rivers were shaking.
