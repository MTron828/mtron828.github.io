313 Imprisonment Divine Tower

After that, Ye Xuan taught his disciples alchemy, artifact refining, and formation mastery.

Of course, the most important thing was formation mastery.

He had to become skilled enough to conceal the heavenly phenomena that would occur when Shangguan Wan’er awakened her Undying Xuan Huang sword physique, as well as from the resulting higher-level special constitution he would obtain from the system.

Ye Xuan smiled and continued, “I promised you that I would give you the Tower of Heaven when the time was right!”

“Today is the most suitable time!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan ‘er’s eyes lit up.

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense swept out and covered every inch of the Tower of Heaven.

Soon, the Tower of Heaven rippled with layers of mysterious fluctuations, which then condensed into a mark that glowed with brilliant light.

This was the authority to control the Tower of Heaven. As long as one refined this mark, they would become the master of the Tower of Heaven.

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve and wiped away the soul imprint that he had left on the mark.

“Refine this and the Tower of Heaven will belong to you,” Ye Xuan said.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes were filled with joy.

“Although refining the Tower of Heaven will cause one to bear its related karma, with me here, this won’t be a problem,” Ye Xuan said with a smile.

“Okay, Teacher!”

Then, she took a deep breath and began to refine the mark.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Tower of Heaven (low-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 4x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Star God Tower (low-grade holy artifact)!”

At the same time, in Ye Xuan’s storage space, a tower covered in starlight suddenly appeared.

Star intent?

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up.

Inside the Star God Tower, there were actually two planets, which were actually as large as Earth.

Furthermore, star intent was quite unique, and would allow one to draw power from the universe around them. When one comprehended star intent to a certain level, there was a chance that one would comprehend world intent, which was on the same level as devouring intent and creation intent.

“It’s not bad, but it’s not what I need either,” Ye Xuan muttered to himself.

“Use the Tower of Heaven well.. In the future, I will give you an even higher-level artifact!”

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er, who was refining the Tower of Heaven, was utterly shocked. Something even better than the Tower of Heaven existed?

After that, Ye Xuan gave the Star God Tower to Zhao Yuyan. However, because her cultivation level was too low to refine it, Ye Xuan had to help her refine it.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Star God Tower (low-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 2x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Demon-suppressing Divine Tower (low-grade holy artifact)!”

As soon as the notification ended, a pitch-black tower exuding a demonic aura appeared in Ye Xuan’s storage space.

Sadly, it did not contain traces of any martial intents.

Despite this, in terms of its offensive and defensive capabilities, it surpassed the previous two towers.

After that, Ye Xuan gave the Demon-suppressing Divine Tower to Li Qingyan.

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Demon-suppressing Divine Tower (low-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 10x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Buddha Divine Tower (middle-grade holy artifact)!”

Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up. The Buddha Divine Tower contained world intent!

Although these new towers were superior to the Tower of Heaven in terms of offensive and defensive capabilities, they were lacking in terms of the martial intents they contained. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Everyone gets one. Yue, this Buddha Divine Tower is yours!”

Ye Xuan looked at Yue, who had been waiting by the side, and could not help but smile.

“Many thanks, Teacher!”

“Ding! As the host has given his disciple the Buddha Divine Tower (middle-grade holy artifact), the host has received a randomized 6x critical reward. Congratulations! The host has obtained the Imprisonment Divine Tower (middle-grade holy artifact)!”

When Ye Xuan’s spiritual sense scanned the Imprisonment Divine Tower, he was overjoyed. This tower contained strength and destruction intents, which were both supreme intents!

Furthermore, both were sixth-level intents, which meant that he could use them to engrave profound patterns once he was done comprehending them.

Strength intent gave one the power to overcome all techniques, while destruction intent could destroy enemies at the atomic level. The power of these two supreme intents was self-evident.
