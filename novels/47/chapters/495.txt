496 Oh?

Ye Xuan smiled.

Naturally, he could sense the hostility from Elder Taiyin,

Ye Xuan gently flicked his sleeve, and the terrifying power of his peak-level mystic lord realm cultivation swept out.

In that instant, the oppressive spiritual pressure dissipated.

!!

When everyone saw this, they were dumbfounded.

“This…”

Especially Li Siyuan and Su Changkong, who had tagged along with Elder Taiyin, looked as if they had been struck by lightning.

They were filled with disbelief. When they had met Ye Xuan in Qingyang City, he had only been an early-stage mystic lord realm cultivator.

It had only been a month since then! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

How had he broken through so quickly?

Wait…

Had he deliberately concealed his cultivation level or suppressed it back then?

From the looks of it, this was indeed the only answer.

After all, there was no way someone could become this much stronger in a month.

Li Siyuan’s face instantly paled, and his hands clenched into fists!

He had only now realized how much stronger Ye Xuan was compared to him.

“The peak of the mystic lord realm?”

When Elder Taiyin saw this, his eyes flashed with surprise and confusion.

This guy had only cultivated for a hundred years. How could he have broken through so quickly?

Of course, he was just a little surprised and did not take it too seriously.

After all, he was already a half-step supreme realm cultivator. Dealing with a cultivator who had just reached the peak of the mystic lord realm would not be too difficult.

That being said, this fellow’s talent was too monstrous.

Thinking this, murderous intent flashed across the depths of Elder Taiyin’s eyes.

“You’re quite strong! As expected of Tian Xuan’s disciple!”

Ye Xuan smiled calmly. In the face of the powerful pressure exuded by the latter, there was no panic on his face.

No matter how strong he was, Ye Xuan had already made the better first impression.

Chu Tianba turned his gaze to Elder Taiyin.

“Could it be that you feel that what I said just now was inappropriate?”

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin frowned and looked deeply at Chu Tianba.

From these words, he knew that Chu Tianba had chosen his side. Even so, there was no fear in his heart.

After all, as a half-step supreme realm expert, he could still take on two peak-level mystic lord realm experts.

Of course, his main goal this time was the heavenly treasure. There was no need to waste too much energy on these two people.

He could afford to wait until he broke through to the supreme realm before taking care of them.

At that time, even if Gongsun Shouyue came personally, the outcome would not change.

“Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Chu, you misunderstand. It’s not that I disagree, but I think your words were exaggerated.”

“At least in my opinion, Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan is not worthy of such praise!”

Although Elder Taiyin had restrained his killing intent, his words were still biting.

Ye Xuan smiled and did not say anything.

He was not chasing fame anyway, so he was too lazy to refute the old man’s words.

Hearing this, Chu Tianba laughed.

“If you don’t believe me, why don’t you try and see for yourself?”

Elder Taiyin looked deeply at Chu Tianba, and then said, “There’s no need to probe. I already know what happened yesterday!”

“Ye Xuan was able to severely injure the heaven devouring divine sparrow thanks to a sneak attack. How is such unsightly behavior praiseworthy?”

Elder Taiyin’s gaze then turned to Ye Xuan.

“I’ve experienced Cloud Sky peak’s swordsmanship before, so I have some understanding of it. “In terms of sword techniques, the Cloud Sky sword technique isn’t that great, let alone heaven-defying! In my opinion, there are countless sword skills that surpass it.”

“Oh?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan raised his brows with interest.

“If that’s the case, then your attainments in the Sword Dao should have reached an extremely high level?”

Elder Taiyin smiled and did not say anything, but his proud expression spoke for itself.

After suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of Chief Tian Xuan, he had spent decades studying the Cloud Sky sword technique, so he had a clear understanding of its moves, strengths and weaknesses.

This was the basis of his confidence. However, he had no idea that although Ye Xuan was from Cloud Sky peak, he had never cultivated any of its techniques.

Hearing what Elder Taiyin said, Ye Xuan gradually became excited.

Ever since he started cultivating the Flora sword technique, he had never seen anyone surpass him in terms of the Sword Dao.

At least from the other party’s words, it was evident that he believed that he could defeat the Cloud Sky sword technique.

“Since that’s the case, I’d like to ask Elder Tianyin to give me some pointers!”

...

As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying sword intent suddenly burst forth from Ye Xuan’s body!

In that instant, the entire world turned dark, and the surrounding flowers, plants, and trees started glowing brightly.

“What is this power?”

As the terrifying sword intent surged, it attracted all of the cultivators within a hundred-mile radius of Ye Xuan.

Very quickly, countless cultivators had surrounded the mountain where Ye Xuan and the others were.

“Isn’t that the chief of Cloud Sky peak, Ye Xuan?”

When the crowd realized the source of the terrifying sword intent, they were shocked.

“What terrifying sword intent! Chief Ye Xuan has truly reached the pinnacle of the Sword Dao!”

“I heard that he severely injured the heaven devouring divine sparrow with a single strike. I didn’t believe it at first, but now it seems like it’s true!”

Everyone looked on emotionally. However, they were in for another surprise.

When they discovered that Ye Xuan’s opponent was Elder Taiyin, they were shocked once more.

...

“Oh my god, Ye Xuan’s opponent is actually Elder Taiyin…”

“That’s an expert from the previous era!”

“Moreover, it has been a hundred years since we’ve heard any news about Elder Taiyin. I can’t believe that he’s shown up here!”
