Chapter 173: Ignorant Country Bumpkin

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Yaoyao, don’t be rude to others!”

Gongsun Wan revealed a helpless expression when she saw this scene unfold.

It was precisely because her younger sister’s talent was so monstrous that she did not respect other cultivators at all.

“How am I being unreasonable? Aren’t these weaklings all just frogs at the bottom of a well? Yet somehow they also think highly of themselves!”

“Even with sister’s strength, there is no guarantee that she will be able to enter the rankings, let alone a tenth-level purple spirit realm weakling like you? Do they really think that the trials of the Tower of Heaven are just for show?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Gongsun Yao looked at the cultivator with disdain, her gaze filled with arrogance.

“Hahaha! It seems that our Yaoyao is trying to demolish the confidence of others again!”

At this moment, loud laughter could be heard.

A streak of light flashed past, and an old man suddenly appeared beside Gongsun Wan and Gongsun Yao.

“Grandpa Batian!”

Gongsun Yao smiled when she noticed the arrival of the newcomer. She walked over with an excited expression and hugged the old man’s arm.

“Greetings, Grandpa Batian!”

Gongsun Wan also said softly when she saw him.

“It’s actually him!”

“Gongsun Batian!”

“A terrifying existence whose cultivation has reached the fourth grade of the unity realm!”

Many cultivators immediately recognized Gongsun Batian.

Jian Tiannan, who was at the side, also could not help but frown when he saw this.

He rarely paid attention to others. Only peerless geniuses with the same strength as him, or unity realm experts, were worthy of his attention.

Therefore, when he heard that some people thought it was easy to enter the rankings, he could not help but laugh out loud.

Now, whether it was the Gongsun sisters or Gongsun Batian, they were all people worth paying close attention to.

Especially Gongsun Yao; her talent was actually even more terrifying than his.

“Yaoyao, although your talent is top-notch, you must remember that there is always someone better than you. Today, you may look down on these cultivators with low talent. In the future, there will also be cultivators with top-notch talent looking down on you!”

Gongsun Batian stroked his white beard and said earnestly.

At this moment, Gongsun Batian could not help but think of the young man he saw at the Heavenly Lightning Pool earlier.

Had he not met this person, his definition and worldview of talent would not have been transformed to what it was currently.

Whether it was Gongsun Wan or Gongsun Yao, both were far inferior to that person!

In Gongsun Batian’s heart, no young cultivator in the entire Nanzhou Region could compare to Ye Xuan.

In terms of cultivation talent, only the master of the Divine Gate could be compared to Ye Xuan when the former was young.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, Gongsun Batian’s facial expression changed. His hand that was stroking his white beard suddenly stiffened. He had spotted a familiar figure amidst the sea of people.

Ye Xuan!

“Grandpa Batian, is there something wrong?”

Gongsun Yao noticed Gongsun Batian’s reaction, and could not help but ask curiously.

“Nothing!”

Gongsun Batian shook his head, and then his gaze fell on Gongsun Yao as he said earnestly, “Yaoyao, don’t be arrogant because of your talent. Although the Nanzhou Region is vast, it’s still insignificant compared to the size of the Tian Yuan continent!”

“If you can leave the Nanzhou Region in the future and go to the Desolate Zone or go explore the wider continent itself, you’ll be able to see those super empires and ancient holy lands.”

“In the hearts of those peerless divine saints and saintesses, you are just a weak cultivator.”

“You may not believe what Grandpa is saying now, but after this trip to the Tower of Heaven, you will understand Grandpa’s meaning!”

As he spoke, Gongsun Batian could not help but secretly glance at Ye Xuan.

“Alright, I understand!”

Gongsun Yao agreed on the surface, but in her heart, she did not think much of it.

Hehe!

In the entire Nanzhou Region, how many young cultivators could be compared to me in talent?

Besides, even if someone’s talent was extremely outstanding, it was impossible for them to be stronger than the master of the Divine Gate!

In terms of talent, other than the master of the Divine Gate, Gongsun Yao had never taken a fancy to other people’s talents.

Once she heard about the master of the Divine Gate’s deeds, Gongsun Yao had idolized him and made him the object of her lifelong pursuit.

In her opinion, the leader of the Divine Gate was the strongest genius in the Nanzhou Region, unmatched by anyone else!

As for what Grandpa Batian said, Gongsun Yao did not take it to heart at all.

Moreover, this was not the first time Grandpa Batian had given her the same advice. Whenever he met some young cultivators with outstanding talent, Grandpa Batian would always say the same thing.

Therefore, in Gongsun Yao’s opinion, her grandfather must have met a cultivator with good talent in the mystic realm, which was why he would compare that person with her.

However, if the other party’s talent was truly monstrous, how could she not have heard of that person?

Throughout the entire Nanzhou Region, other than the top ten geniuses on the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings, she could not be bothered to pay attention to anyone else.

The cultivator at the top of those rankings was now close to 50 years old.

Gongsun Yao was extremely confident that she would definitely be able to surpass the strongest person on the rankings before the age of 40!

Of course, if her age and cultivation level were the only thing going for her, she would not be considered an overly special existence in the Nanzhou Region.

However, Gongsun Yao had awakened the Empress Ice Body not too long ago.

The Empress Ice Body was an extremely terrifying special constitution. It was even rarer than Yue’s Sword Jade Body.

Moreover, in terms of growth potential, the Empress Ice Body surpassed the Sword Jade Body.

Gongsun Yao’s talent had already been quite good to begin with. Once she had awakened the Empress Ice Body, her cultivation had instantly improved by leaps and bounds.

Now, she was hailed as the strongest genius among the younger generation of the Nanzhou Region by the various experts.

Gongsun Yao was born in the Gongsun family. She was the little princess of the family, and had been consuming heavenly treasures and spiritual medicines since young

In addition, everyone in the family doted on Gongsun Yao, which resulted in her arrogant personality.

Therefore, when Gongsun Yao heard that a cultivator from an ordinary empire wanted to place on the Tower of Heaven’s rankings, she could not help but ridicule him.

He really was a country bumpkin. Did he not know what the two lists represented?

Even the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings paled in comparison to what it represented to be ranked on these two lists.
