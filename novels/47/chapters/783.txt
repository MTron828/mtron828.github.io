784 Seven Monsters (Part 1)

“Miss Zhuge, when did you reach the middle stage of the heaven realm?”

After hearing Xie Tianyu’s words, almost everyone’s attention was drawn to the two. Previously, due to the ongoing crisis, no one had time to bother with Zhuge Yueyue. Everyone’s mind was focused on the battle outside.

Therefore, after hearing Xie Tianyu’s question, everyone was in shock and disbelief.

Zhuge Yueyue had really reached the middle stage of the heaven realm?

When they did a double take and checked out her aura, they realized that it was true!

!!

Even Hua Rufeng was stunned at this moment. Although he himself could have broken through to the heaven realm, he had not had the time to do so recently.

Now, he had been surpassed.

Zhuge Yueyue was also a little confused when she saw the surprised expressions on the people’s faces. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“This doesn’t seem to be a big deal, right? Anyone can do it, right?”

As soon as she finished speaking, everyone fell silent.

Ye Xuan, on the other hand, chuckled. It seemed that his disciple had inadvertently learned to humble brag.

After hearing Zhuge Yueyue’s casual reply, Xie Tianyu did not know what to say. It turned out that his rival did not consider this worth mentioning at all. In comparison to her, he was indeed lacking.

“I reached the heaven realm more than 30 days ago, and have now reached the middle stage of the heaven realm,” Zhuge Yueyue spoke again with an indifferent expression.

“F*ck!”

“A minor realm in 30 days?”

“Is it really that easy to advance from the initial stage to the middle stage?”

“Chief Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple is indeed extraordinary.”

“That’s the difference that a powerful teacher provides!”

“She isn’t the only one either. Remember that his youngest disciple emerged as the champion of the gathering.”

“At the rate they are going, won’t they become supreme realm experts in the future? Three supreme realm experts as disciples? That’s crazy!”

“Heavens! If only I could become a disciple of Cloud Sky peak.”

At this moment, the three disciples of Cloud Sky peak had successfully attracted everyone’s attention.

Those who had participated in the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s assessment not long ago were all very excited, hoping that they would have the chance to join the Cloud Sky peak. They all had the same idea, which was to try and catch Ye Xuan’s attention.

Among these people, Fenghua Tian was the most excited. He kept walking around Ye Xuan, wanting to show off his potential.

However, what left Fenghua Tian dumbfounded was that Ye Xuan did not bother with him. It was as if his talent meant nothing.

Fenghua Tian was at a loss. He was even beginning to doubt his talent.

Ye Xuan was pretty happy at this moment. Even though his disciples were the ones in the spotlight, he inadvertently enjoyed the benefits as well.

Hahaha!

At the same time, Ye Xuan was also a little confused at this moment. Why was this fellow beside him always pacing around in front of him?

If he was sick, he had to get treated quickly.

Or is he trying to seduce me by showing me how handsome he is?

Thinking this, Ye Xuan felt that he had to keep a distance from this kid. He felt goosebumps just being around him.

“That’s enough…”

Seeing that the people were still chattering, Ye Xuan opened his mouth to stop them, his eyes turning to look into the distance.

At this moment, the black clouds were rolling in and approaching Sky Mountain. Soon, everyone else regained their senses and focused their attention on the situation at hand. Ye Xuan had said that a great enemy would soon attack…

“Is it finally coming?”

Through the dense black fog, Ye Xuan could vaguely see a strange-looking creature staring at him from afar. This made him feel somewhat excited. It seemed that a good sparring partner had arrived.

After stretching his body, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. With a smile, he said, “Seven of them came at once? This was interesting. Could it be that they were here to take revenge on that strange monster?”

Behind the leading strange monster, Ye Xuan had already sensed six figures further off in the distance. Perhaps others could not sense it, but Ye Xuan did.

It seemed that a bloody storm would descend upon Sky Mountain. Despite the danger, Ye Xuan was itching to try out the power of the moves he had comprehended recently.
