799 A Great Battle Is About To Commence

Ye Xuan had also obtained an extremely large amount of merit power from purifying the vengeful spirits. However, he had suppressed it in order to avoid reaching the sealed immortal realm prematurely. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“End our grudges? And just how do you plan on doing that?”

Seeing that Daoist Yi Feng had finally dared to face her directly, Mengyu was very happy. However, after sensing his killing intent, the happiness changed to bitterness.

Could it be that in his heart, she could not compare to his fallen comrades?

Before Daoist Yi Feng could reply, Ye Xuan hovered in front of Mengyu and said, “You witch! Back then, you killed tens of thousands of our sect’s members, and caused my teacher to suffer heavy injuries. In the end, he could only die carrying this hatred within him.”

“Now, your actions have caused my disciple to suffer serious injuries. Let’s settle the score today!

Witch?

Mengyu was stunned when she heard that.

“You brat, you were just politely calling me Senior Mengyu, but now that you’re done with your preparations, you’ve shown your true colors!”

“Haha, alright then. Let’s settle the score properly. Come at me, both of you! Don’t say that I’m bullying you,” Mengyu said angrily as she stared at the two people in front of her. Her memories seemed to have returned to that battle.

However, the person who had fought her back then was not Ye Xuan, but his teacher, Tian Xuan.

At this moment, the atmosphere became unprecedentedly heavy, and everyone could not tear their eyes away from what was taking place in the sky.

Moments later, the skeleton below Mengyu suddenly roared loudly, breaking the silence.

Looking at this skeleton, Ye Xuan’s eyes were filled with disgust as he shouted, “It was your fault too! Die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan instantly unleashed a sword beam that split the huge skeleton into two.

“F*ck…”

“How fierce! Sword Immortal Ye is indeed worthy of his title!”

“He completely disrespected Mengyu by doing that! How bold!”

Mengyu was enraged after seeing the subordinate that she had painstakingly nurtured being manhandled like this.

“Damn it!”

The aura of a sealed immortal realm expert swept out, causing space to tremble and dark clouds to gather.

Under the immense spiritual pressure, many people were forced to their knees. At this moment, they finally experienced the true strength of a sealed immortal realm expert. Just her aura alone was enough to pin them to the ground, helpless.

Mengyu was very surprised, but she still launched an attack at Ye Xuan without hesitation. However, she could not do anything to Ye Xuan at all.

Was this rainbow robe so powerful that it could block the attack of a sealed immortal realm expert?

How heaven-defying was this?

After the shockwaves from her attack calmed down, Ye Xuan’s lips curled up slightly as he said, “Witch, from the looks of it, your strength as a sealed immortal realm expert isn’t particularly outstanding.”

Mengyu’s expression changed drastically. She really did not expect Ye Xuan’s rainbow robe to be so heaven-defying. Her attack just now was actually easily blocked by Ye Xuan, and he was not injured at all.

“Strange… Could it be that you are a dual cultivator?”

After pondering for a moment, Mengyu finally figured things out.

If he had only relied on the rainbow robe, Ye Xuan would not have been able to block her attack so easily.

Since that was the case, it meant that there was something else.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled indifferently. There was no need to hide it anymore.

“Hahaha, are you shocked? Actually, I’ve been waiting for your arrival for a long time.”

“Don’t be too shocked. After all, there are still bigger surprises to come.”

Ye Xuan gestured to Daoist Yi Feng. During this time, the skeleton that had just been split into two by Ye Xuan actually recovered.

Ye Xuan also understood that the attack he had just unleashed was simply unable to kill this skeleton off completely, but the attack had still caused great damage to it.

“Bring it on, witch. Today, I want to properly experience your strength!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan instantly held the Godsword aloft as he charged forward.

“You really don’t know what’s good for you,” Mengyu said disdainfully.

The gap between the sealed immortal realm and the ancient realm was not something that could be bridged by just the rainbow robe.

Even if she could not use his attacks to kill Ye Xuan, she could exhaust his spiritual power reserves and then kill him.

At this moment, the skeleton had completely reassembled itself. It immediately released its peak-level ancient realm aura toward those on Sky Mountain.

“Ugh!”

Many of them could not straighten their backs at all, while some of the weaker ones even spat out blood.

Seeing this, Daoist Yi Feng’s gaze turned extremely cold.

“You dirty thing, die!”

After cursing angrily, he instantly condensed a huge spiritual palm and slapped the skeleton. Even space began to tremble.

Mengyu was extremely shocked. She had never expected that Daoist Yi Feng’s cultivation level to have reached the peak of the ancient realm, or for his combat strength to have reached this level.

It seemed that after comprehending the Dao of Reincarnation, Daoist Yi Feng’s battle prowess had increased significantly.

With a casual palm strike, the skeleton was slammed into the ground.

At this moment, the skeleton was also furious.

No matter what, it was also a peak-level ancient realm expert, and it had accompanied Mengyu in battle for a long time. There were not many people that could injure it.

However, today, it was actually injured by two people in quick succession.

Did they think that it was a pushover?
