All of this was due to the appearance of that young man.

However, Ye Xuan quickly restrained his aura and disappeared. No one could sense his aura within the spatial turbulence.

In any case, after what they had seen, who would dare to chase him?

They had just encountered an expert with perfect-level sword intent, so they were helpless.

Still, they were extremely curious about his identity.

Shangguan Wan’er hovered within the spatial turbulence and remained silent.

She speculatedthat Ye Xuan was also the reincarnation of an ancient expert. After all, even she had not managed to achieve such feats as a tenth-level unity realm cultivator.

There was no other possible explanation for it.

Furthermore, from the looks of it, she was certain that Ye Xuan’s cultivation level in his previous life was on par with hers, or even stronger than hers.

“This guy’s ambition is quite big!”

“He can easily advance to the pattern condensation realm, but he’s deliberately restraining himself.”

To someone like her, Ye Xuan’s intentions were obvious, especially after she realized that he had comprehended two supreme intents.

“That’s crazy. He will definitely fail,” Shangguan Wan’er muttered to herself.

Ye Xuan’s cultivation talent might be extremely monstrous, but reaching the great circle of the pattern condensation realm with only supreme intents was madness.

How long would it even take?

Even if she cultivated for her entire lifetime, such a feat might not be achievable. The difficulty of comprehending supreme intents was mind-boggling, and each one might take thousands of years, if not more.

There was simply not enough time!

Unity realm experts, or even pattern condensation realm experts, could not live forever. Most would be forced to advance to the next realm due to circumstances, or give up entirely due to the difficulty.

This was also why so many experts chose the path of reincarnation to improve themselves after they reached an unbreachable bottleneck in their cultivation.

In the entire Tianyuan continent, there were actually quite a few ancient almighty experts who had chosen to reincarnate, but not a single one of them had been this audacious.

Shangguan Wan’er’ herself had reached the great circle of the pattern condensation realm in her previous life, but not with supreme intents.

Even as an ancient great empress, not all of the profound patterns that she had engraved on her body at the pattern condensation realm were of the highest level.

It was precisely because of this that she chose to reincarnate. However, something as ambitious as Ye Xuan’s objective was completely unattainable. She would be satisfied with just a few supreme intents.

After thinking about it for a while, Shangguan Wan’er regained her composure, and then tore space apart to create a passage back to the Miaoling Region.

She planned to go back to the Luo Heaven Palace first.

She had established the Luo Heaven Palace after she had awakened a portion of her memories. Having a force under her control made things convenient. The additional manpower would allow her to search for more opportunities as well as obtain more resources.

In particular, heavenly treasures that could increase one’s innate bone value and comprehension value were what she valued the most.

As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, Shangguan Wan’er was aware of the importance of these heavenly treasures.

“it’s a pity that I still haven’t comprehended the power of reincarnation!”

As Shangguan Wan’er flew through the spatial passage, she sighed deeply.

There were two conditions to completely awaken the memories of her previous life.

First, she had to be strong enough.

Secondly, she had to comprehend reincarnation intent, which was a legendary supreme intent.

If she could do this, her memories and insights from her previous life would be freely accessible in her mind, and her cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds.

That being said, the Heavenly Dao had its own restrictions, and it would not tolerate anomalies that broke the balance of the world, so she had to be careful..
