Chapter 268: Titan Ape

Boom!

While Shangguan Wan’er was deep in thought, powerful spiritual energy fluctuations suddenly spread out from the depths of spatial turbulence.

It seemed to be formed from the fusion of many different intents, and had world-shaking power.

“It’s him!”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er was surprised.

She did not expect to encounter Ye Xuan while traveling through spatial turbulence!

Earlier, in the mystic realm, she had already taken note of Ye Xuan’s aura, so she could easily recognize it.

“Let’s see what this guy is up to.”

Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes flickered, and then she disappeared.

Ever since she had awakened her memories of her past life, Ye Xuan was the first cultivator who had piqued her interest.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The chaotic space was filled with violent and destructive spiritual energy fluctuations.

Ye Xuan’s eyes were cold.

After he got the heart of the heavenly lightning, he planned to rush back to the Qingyun sect.

The heart of heavenly lightning was an extremely rare heavenly treasure, and would greatly benefit Ye Xuan’s comprehension of heavenly lightning intent.

This thing was born in spatial turbulence, which was the space one would enter if one was sucked into a spatial crack.

Compared to the outside world, spatial turbulence was extremely dangerous. It contained chaotic energy and was filled with violent and destructive energy fluctuations.

Any cultivators below the fourth level of the unity realm who entered the spatial turbulence would definitely die!

However, danger was often accompanied by opportunities, and the heart of heavenly lightning was one such opportunity.

This object was formed by the laws of lightning in spatial turbulence after countless years of refinement. It contained the purest form of heavenly lightning power!

The heart of the heavenly lightning drifted about in spatial turbulence as it was being refined, and gradually was imbued with spatial intent and developed its own space, which was the lightning tribulation mystic realm.

It hid itself deep within the mystic realm as it evolved. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It was because of this that cultivators could use the lightning tribulation mystic realm to comprehend heavenly lightning intent.

Originally, even the spiritual sense of a pattern condensation realm expert would not be able to detect its existence. However, Ye Xuan also had the power of karma, which directed him toward this opportunity.

After that, Ye Xuan relied on his first-level heavenly lightning intent to meld into the surroundings and safely take it away. Since the heart of heavenly lightning was the core of the mystic realm, it naturally collapsed after that.

As long as he refined the heart of heavenly lightning, Ye Xuan’s comprehension of heavenly lightning intent would advance by leaps and bounds.

Perhaps he would be able to use heavenly lightning intent to engrave his first profound pattern.

However, Ye Xuan preferred to see if he could get a higher level heavenly treasure from the system by giving it to his disciple.

Along the way, he encountered a powerful enemy in spatial turbulence.

It was a high-level demonic beast that had gone berserk, specifically, a Tier Seven demonic beast whose strength was equivalent to a pattern condensation realm expert!

This was a titan ape with boundless strength.

As soon as it spotted Ye Xuan, it raised its mountain-like fist, and rushed in his direction.

Even Ye Xuan found it quite troublesome.

This was the most powerful enemy he had ever encountered. The titan ape had engraved four profound patterns on its body, which were derived from fist, mountain, earth and vibration intents.

Not only that, this titan ape had even fused its own fist intent with vibration intent!

Combined, these two intents possessed extremely powerful offensive power. It was as if layers of ocean waves were stacking up, and each layer was more terrifying than the last!

If it was only this, it would not have been a problem for Ye Xuan. However, it had also fused a third intent, which was mountain intent.

Even Ye Xuan was quite surprised by this.

Demonic beasts were known for having tough physical bodies and heightened physical abilities.

However, compared to humans, their comprehension ability was far lower.

Yet now, this titan ape was actually able to fuse three intents.

It was shocking!

Moreover, these three intents were all focused on strength. One could imagine the power that erupted when they were fused together.

Furthermore, as a demonic beast, its body was very tough, so even Ye Xuan had trouble penetrating its defense, which was further fortified by its earth intent.

Of course, if he used his triple or quadruple intent fusion, things would be different. In the end, his intentions were simple, which was to comprehend the martial intents this titan ape had mastered.

After all, if he could comprehend them, it would greatly reduce the difficulty of him comprehending intents related to power in the future.

However, things quickly changed when, out of nowhere, another ten titan apes appeared!

Moreover, every titan ape’s cultivation level was identical. What was going on here?

Furthermore, it was obvious that they knew how to work together with each other.

When this happened, Ye Xuan suddenly understood why he had sensed the danger through the power of karma when he was at the Qingyun sect.

There was something strange about this whole situation.

Why would these demonic beasts appear in spatial turbulence?

Ye Xuan’s heart was filled with doubts.

Tier Four demonic beasts would have the intelligence level of a child, and once they reached Tier Five, they would have the intelligence level of an ordinary human, and could easily communicate with humans.

However, these titan apes’ expressions seem dull and lacking sentience.

They felt like puppets!
