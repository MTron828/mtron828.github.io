683 Prelude To Battle (Part 1)

Everyone was shocked by this, and their jaws dropped.

“Oh my god! How is this possible?”

The old man was the most surprised, but when he regained his senses, he recalled what Xiang Yun had just said.

“The Dao is me” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

!!

The old man finally figured out how she had passed. It turned out that she was her own Dao, and that her fighting was the way she expressed this Dao, which was why he had been beaten up.

Even this worked?

The old man was so shocked that he did not know what to say. He hoped that this would not create a precedent of cultivators beating him up in order to pass.

Moments later, he picked himself up and instantly returned to his original appearance.

“Little girl, I really have to congratulate you. You’ve passed the test.”

The old man did not take the beating to heart. Instead, he smiled and congratulated her.

Hearing this, Xiang Yun was dumbfounded and very puzzled.

“I passed? This seems too simple.”

After she finished speaking, she turned around and stuck out her tongue at the others.

“They’re all idiots. It’s so simple to pass, yet they’ve been trapped here for so long.”

They were actually mocked by this little girl?

Looking at the scene playing on the screen, everyone outside the ancient realm was at a loss for words. They stared at each other for a long time before someone spoke.

“What the heck? That worked?”

“Damn it! Is she related to this old man or something?”

The fact that she had passed the test in such an ambiguous and questionable manner exceeded the bottom line og what they could accept.

Many people were already filled with doubts, but some people had already discovered the truth.

Daoist Canghai smiled and said calmly, “That’s not the case.”

“Everyone has their own way of answering this question. Most people say things that sound good, but don’t truly believe in.”

“But she, because she’s too pure, she doesn’t understand what Dao is at all.”

“Instead, she proved her Dao with her actions. This was the key to her passing the test.”

Daoist Xu Yun also agreed with this statement and echoed, “Indeed. This little girl is really lucky that her manner of answering the question was accepted.”

“In the heart-questioning stage, it’s not your knowledge of the Dao that counts, but whether you truly believe and adhere to it.”

After listening to their explanation, many disciples were enlightened. It seemed that they had been schooled by a six-year-old girl, which felt rather embarrassing.

Now, everyone knew how she had managed to make it to the Summit Space.

Inside the Summit Space, Zhuge Yueyue was also embarrassed when she found out how her third sister had passed the test.

She smoothed her third sister’s hair and nodded her head while saying, “You’re too bold. You actually beat up the examiner.”

“Hehe, don’t worry First Sister. Second Sister already told me that the examiner is just a figure condensed from spiritual power. It doesn’t matter if he’s beaten up,” Xiang Yun said indifferently.

Although she looked impulsive, she had already thought about it. In any case, she had passed, and that was all that mattered.

Just as everyone was discussing this matter, the door to the Summit Space fluctuated again. The last person had appeared.

At this moment, there were 20 people, and the competition for the 10 spots to ascend to the summit of the mountain was ready to begin.

The 20th person to enter was a young man with a strong physique. From his attire, he looked like someone from an ancient tribe.

When Zhuge Yueyue saw that this person was not Feng Xiyun, she could not help but feel a little disappointed. She did not expect Feng Xiyun to fail.

However, when she thought about it seriously, she felt that this was quite normal. After all, the vast majority of people who could come to this Summit Space were peak-level void realm cultivators.

As a middle-stage void realm cultivator, Feng Xiyun’s chances of making it here were even lower than Xiang Yun’s, who was terrifyingly strong for her level, and whose body contained incredible power.

When the 20th person entered,golden light fell from the sky and covered everyone. Then, 10 portals appeared in the sky. It was obvious that these portals led to the summit.

The atmosphere became unprecedentedly heavy and tense.

At this moment, Mu Beichen stood up calmly and said, “Everyone, since things have come to this, there’s no need for us to continue hiding our strength.”

“Hehe, Brother Mu is right. After all, our ultimate goal is to become the champion. Whether or not one can reach the peak depends on one’s own strength!”

After Xu Changqing finished speaking, he walked straight toward the second door, while Mu Beichen walked into the first door.

The Reincarnation Fairy did not say anything, but simply walked into the third door.

Seeing this, the remaining people looked at each other, and did not immediately choose which door to enter.

Seeing that the three main contenders had already chosen their own doors, they were now pondering which door to choose
