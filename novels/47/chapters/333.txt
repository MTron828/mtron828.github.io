334 The Incomplete Natural Laws Of The Tianyuan Continent

While Ye Xuan was showcasing his sword intent for Shangguan Wan’er, the battle between the human race and the sea race took a huge turn.

Under the instructions of the demonic whale, flood dragon, and other sea race experts, the Marine race gave up on attacking the final territories of the Tianze Zone, and started attacking the other territories of the human race, trying to snatch their fate.

After all, the final territories in the Tianze Zone were protected by formations set up by Saint King realm experts. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The one who ordered the sea race to attack the human race was precisely a certain expert from the dragon race, seeking to obtain enough fate energy to shatter the shackles of the great emperor realm and ascend to a higher world.

This dragon race expert was an ancient black dragon, and he was extremely powerful!

He was still rather apprehensive about going all out. After all, if a war between great emperor realm experts broke out, neither side would gain any benefits.

Thus, he had already informed the four representatives of the sea race to give up on those final territories.

Today, the situation of the war between the two races was about to change greatly.

In the depths of the endless sea, there were many independent spaces. In one such space, which had a spatial barrier no weaker than the one Ye Xuan had erected, a pair of huge eyes suddenly opened. At the same time, an aura that made the world tremble spread out.

“One year! I’ll give you one year to occupy the 90 regions of the Huangyu Zone!”

“When the time comes, I will personally leave seclusion and end the conflict!”

As the deep voice rang out, the space that was as dark as ink suddenly rippled.

If one looked closely, they would be able to see that this was the gleam emitted by the scales of a giant dragon.

The black dragon’s body was extremely huge. Its pupils were as big as mountains, and its body was as wide and long as several vast mountain ranges!

On the periphery of that space, there were four figures.

They were the sea race’s demonic whale, Yaksha, flood dragon, and merman representatives.

Naturally, the one in front of them was the dragon race’s ancient black dragon!

A legendary great emperor expert!

“We will obey the Dragon Lord’s orders,” The four of them said respectfully.

With the ancient black dragon’s backing, what was there to fear?

When the sea race representatives left, the enormous ancient black dragon suddenly transformed into human form, revealing the figure of a black-clothed man with a cold expression.

The stern-looking man flicked his sleeve, and a fragment suddenly appeared in the space.

This fragment was filled with wisps of a mysterious power.

“If the sea race can occupy the 90 regions, and nourish this fragment with the fate energy of the human race, the fragment will definitely be completed!”

The cold man’s eyes gleamed with divine light, and the aura around him made the space shudder.

Everyone knew that great emperor realm experts were at the pinnacle of the Tianyuan continent, but they did not know that there were different levels between them.

They were first, second, and third-level great emperors!

The ancient black dragon was a second-level great emperor, and the fragment in front of him was his greatest treasure and opportunity.

Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the ancient black dragon had obtained this fragment by chance and had spent a hundred thousand years refining it.

At the same time, the ancient black dragon also obtained the secret of the Tianyuan continent.

The fragment was a fragment of a divine disc. As for the divine disc’s grade, he had no idea.

However, through the inheritance contained with the fragment, he had discovered that if the fragment absorbed enough fate energy, it could open a passageway between worlds that would lead to the upper world that countless experts dreamed of.

This was the secret of the ancient black dragon!

It was precisely because of this that he had ordered the sea race to attack the human race!

Of course, the human race’s fate energy alone was insufficient for this, so the ancient black dragon also secretly plundered the fate energy of the sea race.

“One year! As long as the sea race can occupy the 90 regions of the Huangyu Zone within a year, I’ll be able to use the fragments to open the passage and ascend to the upper world!”

“When that time comes, I’ll definitely be able to surpass the great emperor realm!”

At the thought of this, the ancient black dragon’s pitch-black eyes glowed with a strange light!

Since the ancient era, there had been no other experts who could ascend to the upper world.

It was rumored that there were many geniuses in the ancient era, and even many third-level great emperors!

However, a peerless great emperor expert in the past had forcefully extracted the power of the natural laws of the Tianyuan continent and refined it. He had then broken through the boundaries of the Heavenly Dao and ascended!

However, from then on, the natural laws of the Tianyuan continent were incomplete, and no one could surpass the great emperor realm.

Furthermore, great emperor realm cultivators became scarcer and scarcer.

The ancient black dragon was a descendant of the true dragon race from the upper world, so his bloodline and level of talent were naturally the best on the Tianyuan continent.

Even so, he had no confidence in surpassing the great emperor realm while on the Tianyuan continent where the power of the natural laws was incomplete.

If he could not break through, then even the ancient black dragon would die, lost in the river of time, just like the other great emperors.

This was because, under the restrictions of the natural laws, great emperor realm cultivators could only live for five million years.

It was rumored that in the ancient era, great emperor realm experts could live as long as the heavens existed. However, all that had changed the day that peerless great emperor acted.

Now, if he wanted to break free from the constraints of his limited lifespan, he had to leave the Tianyuan continent and head to the upper world.
