537 White-Browed Old Man (Part 4)

At this moment, the white-browed old man was getting more and more confused. How could an ordinary cultivator reach Ye Xuan’s level?

Furthermore, Ye Xuan’s palm technique actually made him feel pressured. Every time the white-browed old man exchanged blows with Ye Xuan, he felt like he was fighting a giant. It was a terrible feeling.

‘No, I can’t let this drag on any longer. I have to use my trump card!’

After hesitating for a while, the white-browed old man made his decision.

“Haha, this little guy is really something. He’s only a mid-stage supreme realm expert, yet he’s able to fight the white-browed old man to a standstill.”

“I’m getting more optimistic about his chances. I can’t believe there was such a peerless genius hidden in the Great Wilderness Divine sect,” a white-haired old man in a Daoist robe muttered to himself.

He believed that if the white-browed old man did not use his trump card, only defeat awaited him.

“Little guy, you’re indeed quite strong, but now I won’t let you do as you please anymore,” the white-browed old man said through gritted teeth, implying that he had not used his full strength just now.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan just smiled faintly. His expression was still very calm.

Ye Xuan beckoned to the white-browed old man with his finger and said with a smirk, “Little doggy, hurry up then.”

The white-browed old man’s dignity had once again taken a beating. He was utterly infuriated.

“B*stard!”

In the blink of an eye, the white-browed old man sent a palm strike toward Ye Xuan.

Just as Ye Xuan reached out with his palm to block the attack, the white-browed old man suddenly laughed proudly and secretly took out a short saber from his storage space.

“It’s the Godsaber!”

The onlookers were shocked. The saber that the white-browed old man had just taken out was said to be able to destroy anything. Even though this saber was not a divine-rank magic artifact, it was still not something that an ordinary treasure could compare to.

With the help of the Godsaber, the white-browed old man had successfully dispatched many opponents.

After taking it out, he immediately tried to stab Ye Xuan to try and take advantage of the element of surprise.

However, at this moment, the sound of weapons clashing rang out.

At the critical moment, the sword energy around him seemed to form a tornado, protecting Ye Xuan within it.

Ye Xuan seemed to have changed his appearance. His gaze seemed to be much sharper, and his entire being seemed to have a sharp edge.

Seeing this scene, the white-browed old man was frightened and wanted to withdraw and retreat.

However, his Godsaber had already been tightly grasped by Ye Xuan, making it impossible for him to retreat.

Moments later, streams of golden light surged forward, knocking the white-browed old man hundreds of meters away.

At this moment, Ye Xuan seemed to be the brightest thing in the surroundings. The dense sword energy kept spinning around him, as if he was possessed by a sword god.

The onlookers were surprised and, at this moment, they actually saw Ye Xuan smile proudly.

“It turns out that his forte is actually sword techniques?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

An onlooker muttered to himself. It was the first time he had seen such a powerful sword aura in his life.

The one who was the most shocked was the white-browed old man. He said with a serious expression, “I didn’t expect you to be so good at hiding your strength. However, do you think you can defeat me like this?”

As soon as he finished speaking, the white-browed old man manipulated the Godsaber from a distance to fight Ye Xuan, while he was constantly performing complicated hand seals.

A sharp needle emitting a dark light condensed in front of the white-browed old man. Different from the previous Yama’s needles, this one contained an even stronger poison and was even more powerful.

When the audience saw this, they held their breath again. No one expected Ye Xuan to be able to force the white-browed old man to use this technique.

Would Ye Xuan be able to block this?

While everyone waited with bated breath, Ye Xuan eyes glowed golden as he stared straight at the white-browed old man.

He said disdainfully, “Old man, I can see that you really like needles. Perhaps yours is the size of a needle too.”

While everyone was filled with doubt, Ye Xuan once again displayed his vast arsenal of artifacts.

The next moment, seven crystal-like needles floated in front of Ye Xuan, which exuded a powerful aura.

“Oh my god! He has a divine-rank artifact?”

Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock. At this moment, Ye Xuan manipulated the seven needles and slowly pointed them in the direction of the white-browed old man.

“You shameless old man, I’ll let you have a taste of your own medicine.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan hurled the seven needles toward the white-browed old man using the Boundless Palm technique.

Moments later, the white-browed old man’s only needle was struck down. However, Ye Xuan’s remaining six needles still pierced toward him.

Seeing this, the white-browed old man’s face instantly turned pale. He gathered his spiritual power to condense a barrier to block Ye Xuan’s six needles.

However, everything he did was in vain.

It was not until he finished condensing the barrier that he realized that the six needles were not affected by the barrier at all. They bypassed the shield and pierced the white-browed old man’s body.

“Ah!”

A shrill scream rang out, and the white-browed old man hurriedly examined his own condition.

“Eh? How come I’m completely fine?”

After noticing this, the white-browed old man laughed proudly again.

“Hahaha, it seems that your needles are just to scare people. They don’t have any power at all.”

“Hehe, you dared to use such a small trick to mess with me? You really are…”

Before he could finish, the white-browed old man’s face contorted.

He felt as if his entire body was being pricked by thousands of needles, and an unbearable pain spread throughout his body…
