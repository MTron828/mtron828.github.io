302 I Was Wrong

Shangguan Wan’er felt her cultivation level rising rapidly, and a strange light filled her beautiful eyes.

The amount of spiritual power Ye Xuan had transferred over was immense. It had saved her at least 20 years’ worth of cultivation.

‘Even if the memories of my previous life are completely awakened, I will never regret taking Ye Xuan as my teacher,” Shangguan Wan ‘er thought to herself. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Shangguan Wan’er’s heart was filled with gratitude, but she did not know how to repay him.

Beside her, Ye Xuan did not notice her conflicted gaze as he was still adapting to the sudden increase in power.

‘I’ve gotten strong enough. It’s time for me to fully comprehend the karmic intent and spatial intent in the Tower of Heaven,’ Ye Xuan said to himself.

Of these two intents, karmic intent was the most important.

If he could comprehend the true form of karmic intent, it would allow him to avoid many dangers and predict future opportunities.

After that, Ye Xuan refreshed Shangguan Wan’er’s arsenal of cultivation techniques, resources and artifacts.

Although she had become somewhat used to this, it still filled her with amazement.

What was Ye Xuan’s identity? Why did it feel like he had everything?

She felt that even her past self would not be able to measure up to Ye Xuan in this regard.

As her strength increased, cultivation methods and martial techniques from her previous life also appeared in Shangguan Wan’er’s mind, but in terms of grade and power, they were far inferior to what Ye Xuan had given her.

He was basically a walking treasure trove. He somehow made extremely rare treasures, like the heart of heavenly lightning, seem as common as cabbages.

Furthermore, it was getting to the point that even Shangguan Wan’er was struggling to recognize some of the treasures he took out.

In short, there was no other teacher as impressive as he was in the entire Tianyuan continent!

Moreover, he was so generous!

Looking at Ye Xuan now, she seemed a little starry-eyed.

Even Shangguan Wan’er herself did not notice her expression.

“My precious disciple, why are you looking at me like that?”

“Ah?”

Shangguan Wan’er immediately lowered her head in a panic.

“What are you talking about?” Shangguan Wan’er denied it vehemently.

“I was just thinking about some stuff!”

“Oh? Is that so?”

“And was that stuff related to me?

Ye Xuan asked with a faint smile.

Teasing this tsundere was really fun!

“No! It’s just some stuff that happened when I was young!” By this time, Shangguan Wan’er’s expression had returned to normal.

Then, Shangguan Wan’er snorted coldly and turned her head away.

It was all her teacher’s fault for teasing her.

Hmph!

This was infuriating!

Ye Xuan chuckled, thinking to himself that Shangguan Wan’er’s current appearance was very cute.

“Alright, that’s enough fun for now. Next, all of you are going into secluded cultivation to improve your martial intents.”

At this moment, Ye Xuan coughed and changed the topic in a serious tone.

Hearing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s turned around to look at Ye Xuan.

“Really?”

“But someone seems to be angry with me, so I’m not sure if I should bring her along.”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a teasing gaze.

Hearing this, she was flustered.

Although Ye Xuan was deliberately teasing her, he had indeed done a lot for her.

“Fine, I was wrong! I’m not angry anymore,” Shangguan Wan’er said exasperatedly after some struggling.

“That’s the spirit!”
