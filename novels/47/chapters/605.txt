606 Purple Wind Chime

At the center of the new palace on Cloud Sky peak, there was a new hall called the Cloud Sky Hall. Inside, there was also a martial arts arena. It was a very spectacular sight.

However, because there were very few people on cloud sky peak, the arena was not particularly big.

On the left of the Cloud Sky Palace, there was a new garden filled with all kinds of flowers and plants. There was even a rockery, as well as flowing streams. It was like entering a fairyland.

In the innermost part of the garden, there were a few wooden pavilions. When one was tired from cultivating, one could sit in there and drink tea. It was really very pleasant.

Ye Xuan was very satisfied after touring the area. He turned around and said to his disciples, “Alright, which of these houses do you like? You can move into any one of them.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and the other two immediately started choosing.

Xiang Yun was shocked. She felt like she liked every house she saw.

“Hehe, this house is awesome. I’ll choose this one!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No, that one is nice too. I want it too…”

It was the first time she had seen such beautiful wooden houses.

She had lived in a thatched village hut with her parents, and after the berserk beasts’ attacks, she had lived with the old man in the ruined temple.

Therefore, seeing these fancy wooden houses excited her to no end.

She happily strolled around the garden. However, Feng Xiyun walked over after Xiang Yun had finally finished choosing her wooden house.

“Junior Sister, are you afraid of sleeping alone at night? Do you want to sleep together with me?”

Upon hearing this, Xiang Yun’s eyes widened. She raised her little head and said, “I don’t.”

“I’m a big girl now. No matter how scared I am at night, I have to sleep by myself.”

“That’s fine too. My house is right next to yours. If you encounter any difficulties, you can come and look for me.”

Feng Xiyun was a little disappointed, but she did not take it to heart.

Even though this little girl was only six years old, she was very independent and headstrong.

However, after thinking about it carefully, it was not strange. After all, Xiang Yun had been living and surviving by herself after she lost her family.

“Alright, go and pack your things. You can move them here later.”

After he had chosen his house, Ye Xuan smiled and instructed.

Zhuge Yueyue’s house was located in a quieter area.

Feng Xiyun’s house was right next to Xiang Yun’s, as she wanted to take care of her.

As for Ye Xuan?

He did not choose a wooden house. He simply chose to stay in the Cloud Sky Palace itself.

On the way back to their original residences, Ye Xuan suddenly noticed a purple wind chime. He turned around and asked his disciples, “Do you know who planted this tree and what it means?”

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun looked at each other. They were both interested in this too.

The purple wind chime seemed out of place with the other trees on Cloud Sky peak. Only one was planted in the center.

From the moment they returned to Cloud Sky peak, they had been curious about this matter. Why would a purple wind chime be planted here?

Seeing that his two disciples did not know anything, Ye Xuan turned his gaze to Xiang Yun and asked gently, “Little Yun, do you know?”

Xiang Yun shook her head vigorously and said, “I’m not sure.”

Ye Xuan smiled and said, “This purple wind bell was planted by my teacher.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were shocked. They really did not expect that this ordinary purple wind chime had actually been planted by their grandmaster.

Ye Xuan then continued, “Back then, when the winter snow had just melted, I was accepted into Cloud Sky peak.”

“Actually, my teacher cared a lot about me, but never told me directly. Instead, he planted this tree for me, hoping that I can grow like this purple wind chime.”

“Now, several years have passed, and I’ve indeed been growing and becoming stronger. just as he said…”

At this moment, Ye Xuan felt a little melancholic.

Could it be that Tian Xuan had never cared about him?

No… he had always been silently concerned about Ye Xuan, and his concern for Ye Xuan was encapsulated in this purple wind chime.

Tian Xuan was the kind of person who could not express himself well with words. Furthermore, he was focused on cultivation, so he did not communicate much with Ye Xuan.

For this reason, he planted this purple wind chime in the residence on Cloud Sky peak.

“My teacher once told me that when the flowers bloomed, he would rush back and meet me.”

“It’s been so long, and I’ve grown from a young man to a pillar of support of the sect, but he hasn’t returned…”

At this moment, Ye Xuan sighed when he saw the purple wind chime.

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun also felt his sadness. Even though they had never seen their grandmaster’s face, they could imagine the scene after hearing what Ye Xuan had just said.

“Teacher …”

Zhuge Yueyue was already on the verge of crying. She walked over to Ye Xuan’s side silently and held his arm, remaining silent.

Ye Xuan also turned around to look at his disciple, and the corners of his mouth curved up slightly.

Looking at the purple wind chime, Ye Xuan continued, “Back then, my teacher helped me plant this tree, hoping that I would be able to grow healthily.”

“His wish has been fulfilled, and now it’s my turn. Let me help you plant a tree. I hope that you can grow healthily and become strong in the future.”

After hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun’s hearts were deeply touched. Their teacher’s care and emotions for them would be encapsulated in this tree.
