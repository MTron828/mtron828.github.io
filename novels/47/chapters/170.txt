Chapter 171: The Tower Of Heaven Appears!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hmph!”

Yue coldly snorted, the corners of her mouth curling up into a sneer.

Moments later, Yue raised her hand again, her spiritual power transforming into an open palm which abruptly slapped Li Xueyan’s cheek.

Pa!

A resounding sound rang out once more!

Pa!

Followed by another slap!

Li Xueyan’s initial expression was still somewhat resentful, but the resentment in her eyes had now turned into fear.

This woman was clearly not as old as her, so why was she so powerful?

This terrifying power… she had probably reached the purple spirit realm, right?

Could it be that she was a cultivator from a super sect?

One slap after another landed Li Xueyan’s cheek, instantly causing her face to swell up like a pig’s head.

After the last slap, Li Xueyan fainted.

Seeing this, Yue stopped.

Although Yue was usually quite gentle, once she chose to attack, she was more ruthless than anyone else.

She turned around with a cold expression. When she saw Zhao Yuyan, she revealed a bright smile.

When everyone saw this scene, their eyelids twitched.

They did not expect this beautiful girl to be so ruthless. Was she not worried that she would accidentally kill that person?

Moreover, what surprised them the most was Yue’s strength. Based on those powerful energy fluctuations, she seemed to have reached the purple spirit realm!

However, how could this woman have such terrifying strength at such a young age? Could it be that she was a cultivator from a super sect?

Also, who was the teacher that this woman was talking about?

Everyone’s hearts were filled with doubt, but no one dared to ask.

Yue slowly walked over to Zhao Yuyan’s side, but then suddenly frowned.

When she made her move just now, she had suddenly felt that there was an invisible force that locked onto her in the War God Hall.

Moreover, Yue could clearly feel that if she really killed Li Xueyan, she would definitely be killed by this invisible force.

The invisible force only gradually dissipated after she stopped.

“Junior Sister, remember this. After leaving the mystic realm, if there are still people who dare to bully you, don’t let them get away with it!”

“En!”

Zhao Yuyan nodded seriously.

Yue could not help but sigh when she saw this.

Although her junior sister agreed, given her weak personality, she probably would not be able to change so quickly. However, this kind of thing could not be forced. It would be fine as long as she took her time.

“Thank you, Senior Sister!”

Zhao Yuyan walked forward, her small hands tightly holding on to Yue’s arm, revealing a sweet smile.

“Silly girl, we’re family. There’s no need to be so polite!”

Yue smiled, and then reached out to fix the latter’s messy hair!

“Okay!”

Zhao Yuyan nodded and revealed a bright smile.

When she arrived at this place alone, she was very depressed. Furthermore, she was insulted by Li Xueyan, which made her even sadder.

Now that Senior Sister Yue was by her side, Zhao Yuyan’s mood was naturally much better.

Then, the two of them found a place to cultivate.

Due to the example set by Li Xueyan, no other cultivators dared to provoke them.

At the same time, the spatial fluctuations continued to ripple out in their surroundings, and many cultivators appeared.

In this boundless white space, countless cultivators were now present.

However, when compared to when the mystic realm first opened, the number was now far less after all of the fighting for treasures. Many cultivators had been permanently laid to rest inside this mystic realm.

Still, the white space was becoming more and more cramped as more cultivators appeared..

“Ugh!”

Suddenly, Li Xueyan, whose face was swollen like a pig’s head, woke up and let out a muffled groan.

The moment she regained consciousness, she felt an intense pain on her face. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Li Xueyan opened her eyes, she also noticed the strange gazes from the people around her.

She was momentarily stunned beforeimmediately reacting. Her eyes were filled with shame, and she really wanted to find a hole to bury herself in.

She was filled with extreme hatred toward Yue.

There were people everywhere, and she had nowhere to hide.

If she had known earlier, she would have not woken up!

Thus, Li Xueyan could only endure the humiliation in her heart, taking out a healing pill and swallowing it.

Boom!

Suddenly, the center of the War God Hall suddenly trembled violently.

Moments later, everyone saw an incomparably huge tower suddenly appear out of nowhere. It emitted resplendent light, connecting the heavens and the earth.

At the same time, waves of ancient aura surged forth from the tower.

Tower of Heaven!

Three words that contained an ancient aura suddenly appeared on the tower.

The Tower of Heaven had a total of 99 floors. Any cultivator who passed the examination of the War God Hall had the right to enter the Tower of Heaven to challenge the trials within.

Moreover, those who challenged 10 floors successfully would be rewarded richly by the Tower of Heaven.

“Is this the Tower of Heaven? It’s so majestic!”

“This tower exudes an extremely ancient aura. It’s probably an ancient place that existed tens of thousands of years ago, or perhaps even hundreds of thousands of years ago!”

“How terrifying was the expert who created this Tower of Heaven back then? It’s simply a divine opportunity!”

Everyone’s gaze fell on the Tower of Heaven, and they began to discuss enthusiastically.

Those who had just entered the War God Hall were even more shocked to see such a heaven-defying tower.

“I’m not too sure either, but an expert once said that the Tower of Heaven is in its own independent void space, but creates an illusion that it’s close to where we are!”

“Other than cultivators who have the qualifications to enter the War God Hall, the rest of the cultivators can not touch the Tower of Heaven, nor can they challenge the trials!”

Some knowledgeable cultivators explained.

“What is the qualification to enter the War God Hall?”

“Very simple, it refers to the actual age of cultivators!”

“The War God Hall tests the actual age of every cultivator. Anyone whose actual age exceeds 50 years old is not qualified to enter the Tower of Heaven!”

“I see, isn’t this the same as the Nanzhou Region Genius Rankings? Only cultivators below 50 years old are qualified to enter the rankings. Why does it feel like the Tower of Heaven is screening for geniuses?”

Many cultivators could not help but reveal a look of realization when they heard this.
