649 Picking A Fight (Part 1)

“B*stard…”

Daoist Gu Hao’s face turned green with anger. He had been sitting there all this time, but Ao Lei said he had not noticed him. This brat was clearly ignoring him.

“Not bad, huh. You think you’re all that now, don’t you?”

Daoist Gu Hao reproached him rudely and then said in a cold voice, “Your Great Wilderness Divine sect is really getting more and more full of themselves.”

“No, no, we’re not really going that far,” Ao Lei replied very calmly, with no intention of backing down.

In any case, this had been his intention from the beginning. He considered Daoist Gu Hao an enemy, so why would he even look at him?

Back then, were it not for Chief Tian Xuan’s timely aid, Ao Lei would have died thanks because of Gu Hao. Therefore, Ao Lei had always held a grudge against Gu Hao, and what he did just now was purely to get back at him.

“Ha, Ao Lei, don’t think that you’re very powerful just because you destroyed the Immortal Divine sect.”

“Perhaps other forces might be afraid of you, but the Supreme Divine sect does not number among them.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the atmosphere became tense.

Could it be that there was going to be a war between the Supreme Divine sect and the Great Wilderness Divine sect?

People still remembered the complete destruction of the Immortal Divine sect a while ago, which shocked the cultivation world for a long time.

Therefore, hearing these words, everyone was brimming with anticipation for a good show.

“Haha, people always say that the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Ao Lei has an explosive temper. Today, we’ll see that it’s true.”

“Even if he’s confronting someone from the older generation, it doesn’t seem like he plans to back down.”

“However, if the two sects really come to blows, can anyone in the Great Wilderness Divine sect defeat Daoist Gu Hao?”

Everyone’s opinions varied, and many people were not certain as to why Ao Lei was so confident in dealing with Daoist Gu Hao head-on. The former’s expression was still calm and composed.

After Ao Lei pondered for a moment, he looked at Daoist Gu Hao and said, “If you’re really dissatisfied with the Great Wilderness Divine cult, then come at us if you can. But before you do, you have to be prepared for your own burial…”

“If you have the ability, then say that again…”

Daoist Gu Hao’s expression changed drastically, but he also remembered the sect-guarding formation of the Great Wilderness Divine sect and hesitated.

“Damn it!”

As his anger rose to the sky, Gu Hao just attacked. Although he did not have the courage to attack the sect directly, he still dared to attack here.

“I’ll take a good look today at what makes you so arrogant!

Then, an extremely terrifying force descended, but Ao Lei’s expression remained calm.

He gathered his strength and threw a punch, blocking Daoist Gu Hao’s attack.

In an instant, waves of fluctuations rippled out from the impact, causing many of the cultivators present to fall over.

At this moment, Daoist Gu Hao was shocked. His original intention was only to give Ao Lei a scare, so he did not use his full strength.

When had Ao Lei reached the supreme realm?

Ao Lei stretched out his hand and dispersed the fluctuations. Then, he said with a calm expression, “Daoist Gu Hao, let’s just drop this matter.”

“I won’t hide it from you. My junior brother’s temper is much more explosive than mine. If you anger him, no one will be able to persuade him.”

“If you really want to continue, I advise you to think about what happened to the Immortal Divine sect. If you want the Supreme Divine sect to end up in the same state, then go ahead and continue.”

After saying this, Ao Lei suddenly felt very carefree. He suddenly felt that it was quite good to have a junior brother who was very awesome.

‘Haha, Junior Brother Ye, I’m gonna use your name to bluster and show off,’ Ao lei thought happily.

After hearing these words, Daoist Black Iron’s expression instantly changed. He clearly remembered how easily Ye Xuan had killed Elder Taiyin, and how close he himself had come to dying by Ye Xuan’s hands.

Hence, he was very afraid.

Daoist Gu Hao was very confused. After the death of Chief Tian Xuan, was Yi Feng not the strongest person in the Great Wilderness divine sect?

From what Ao Lei had just said, it seemed that this junior brother of his was the most powerful one in the Great Wilderness Divine sect?

Daoist Black Iron hurriedly ran over and said to Daoist Gu Hao, “Master, the person Ao Lei just mentioned is the new chief of Cloud Sky peak, and Chief Tian Xuan’s disciple.”

“He is called Ye Xuan, but others prefer to call him sword immortal because his attainments in terms of the Sword Dao are incredibly high.”

“Elder Taiyin and Mo Nan of the Immortal Divine sect were both easily slain by his sword.”

“This…”

Daoist Gu Hao’s expression changed drastically. He finally understood why Ao Lei was so confident. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was well aware of Mo Nan’s combat strength.

If Ye Xuan had really killed Mo Nan so easily, then this person’s cultivation level should have reached the advanced-stage of the supreme realm at the very least.

What shocked him the most was that Ye Xuan was from Cloud Sky peak!

Seeing that Ao Lei actually used his junior brother to threaten him, Gu Hao said moodily, “Your Great Wilderness Divine sect is indeed quite brash.”

“Do you think I’m afraid of someone from the younger generation?”

“If it wasn’t for Yi Feng, I would definitely teach you a lesson today. This will not happen again. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

“Hahaha…”

Right at this moment, a few more figures appeared beside Ao Lei. Gao Shun, Yuelun, and the others had all arrived.

Gao Shun was the one who laughed out loud, after which he immediately said, “Second Senior Brother, I heard a dog barking from far away.”
