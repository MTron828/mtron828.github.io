444 Elder Tongtian

“Greetings, Teacher!”

Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue bowed respectfully.

“Chief Ye Xuan, this Gao Shun person is seriously too sinister and cunning! He even tampered with the drawing of lots!”

At that moment, Su Changhe walked over while cursing.

Ye Xuan was not too surprised.

He had guessed previously that Gao Shun absolutely would not let go of the chance to interfere with the competition. However, no matter what tricks this guy played, he would not be able to change the final results.

Ye Xuan glanced at his two disciples. Seeing them remain calm, he was very satisfied. His disciples were indeed a cut above the rest.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched as he looked at Su Changhe, who was still cursing Gao Shun.

“This is really too much. He can’t beat us in an aboveboard manner, so he resorted to dirty tricks instead.”

“It’s only the first round of the competition, but Sister Yueyue and Sister Xiyun have already encountered cultivators from Hidden Sword peak! Sister Yueyue probably won’t have a problem, but Sister Xiyun is still new to cultivation. They are probably trying to make an example of her.”

Su Changhe cursed as he glared in the direction of Hidden Sword peak.

Feng Xiyun’s mouth twitched when she heard this. She slapped Su Changhe’s head.

“What are you trying to imply? Do I look that weak to you?”

Feng Xiyun was a little unhappy. Although she was not as strong as Zhuge Yueyue, she was still a bona fide first-level materialization realm cultivator.

Within the past 30 days, Feng Xiyun had continuously refined the power contained within the precious bone and, not long ago, she had broken through to the materialization realm.

She was planning to reveal her strength in the Seven Peaks competition to give her teacher a surprise.

“Cough cough… Sister Xiyun, I didn’t mean it that way.”

He looked at Feng Xiyun with a wronged expression.

“I spent some money to inquire. The cultivator from Hidden Sword peak that you will be fighting has already broken through to the ninth level of the divine mystic realm. Gao Shun deliberately arranged for him to deal with you. I was just worried for you.”

Feng Xiyun remained indifferent.

How could a mere ninth-level divine mystic realm cultivator be qualified to be her opponent.

“Alright, it’s only the first round of the competition. There’s no need to dwell on such matters.”

Just as Su Changhe was about to explain further, Ye Xuan waved his hand and interrupted him.

“There’s still 60 minutes before the competition starts, so you should make your preparations.”

“Every participant here is considered one of the geniuses of their respective peaks.”

“I don’t have many requirements for you. Just do your best. If you really encounter danger, admit defeat immediately! I don’t want my precious disciples to get hurt because of a minor competition. It isn’t worth it.”

Ye Xuan instructed them with a gentle gaze.

While Feng Xiyun and Zhuge Yueyue were touched by this, they also made up their minds to not embarrass Cloud Sky peak during this competition.

“Don’t worry, teacher. We definitely won’t let you down!”

For the Seven Peaks competition, Zhuge Yueyue had been constantly preparing for the past three months. Now, it was time for her to reveal her strength.

Every time she saw Gao Shun, she was reminded of the latter’s disdainful words toward Ye Xuan.

She wanted to get back at him personally!

“Mm! Alright, you all can start preparing now.”

When they left, Ye Xuan smiled. His disciples were indeed full of fighting spirit.

However, when he turned to look at Su Changhe, his mouth twitched.

Why was this guy acting up again? He was peeking at beautiful women everywhere. Was he not supposed to be maintaining his filial image?

At this moment, above the first arena, Gongsun Shouyue, Gao Shun, and a few unknown people were seated and in a discussion.

“Fellow Daoist Gongsun, I’ve heard that the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Seven Peaks competition is one of the grand events of the East continent. I’ve waited for a hundred years to finally see it with my own eyes,” a black-robed old man said with a smile. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Hearing this, Gongsun Shouyue only smiled and did not say anything.

The black-robed old man was the great elder from the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect, and also Mu Beichen’s teacher, Elder Tongtian.

Elder Tongtian was a peak-level mystic lord realm cultivator who was comparable to Gongsun Shouyue. They were also good friends, and had gone on many adventures together when they were younger.

When he heard that the Great Wilderness Divine sect was going to hold the Seven Peaks competition, Elder Tongtian came without hesitation.

Gongsun Shouyue welcomed him. In any case, the chiefs of the other peaks could also invite their friends to observe the competition.

“Oh, right, I heard that the Great Wilderness Divine sect produced a young mystic lord realm expert, who managed to severely injure three elders of the Immortal Divine sect. Is this true?” Elder Tongtian asked.

Mu Beichen, who was standing behind Elder Tongtian, heard this and his eyes lit up.

The reason he had followed Elder Tongtian to observe the competition was actually because of Ye Xuan.

Ever since he had seen Ye Xuan’s sword technique, Mu Beichen had been obsessed with it.

Gongsun Shouyue narrowed his eyes.

Was Ye Xuan’s reputation so great to the point that even the Great Elder of the Heavenly Mountain Divine sect had heard of him?

Although he was puzzled, he still put on a smile.

After all, Ye Xuan was a chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect. The greater Ye Xuan’s reputation, the greater the prestige of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.
