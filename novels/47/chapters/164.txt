Chapter 165: Blaming Others

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

For a moment, everyone was in a heated discussion.

The name Ye Xuan was still deeply engraved in their minds, but they did not believe that Ye Xuan came from the Great Qian Dynasty.

After all, how could such a peerless genius appear within an empire that was ranked among the lowest in the Nanzhou Region?

Given his achievements, he had to have come from one of those super empires or holy lands! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Just as everyone was discussing among themselves, a cold voice suddenly rang out.

“Everyone was comprehending the Heavenly Lightning intent peacefully together here, yet you drew in all of the lightning bolts to temper your physical body. Do you know that you have seriously impeded our comprehension efforts?”

Hearing this, everyone looked around for the source of this voice, but were unable to locate the speaker.

The other party’s goal was extremely obvious. They wanted to make Ye Xuan out to be a public enemy.

The originally noisy scene instantly quieted down. At this moment, the only thing that moved was the power of lightning roiling within the thunderstorm cloud.

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan raised his eyebrows.

He had not expected someone to kick up a fuss after he had comprehended the Heavenly Lightning intent. Although he had not revealed his unity realm cultivation, common sense dictated that anyone who could successfully comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent would not be an ordinary person.

This guy dared to provoke him like this. He was either very strong, or lacking in common sense.

Others might not have been able to detect the source of the voice, but there was no hiding from Ye Xuan’s powerful spiritual sense.

Soon, Ye Xuan’s gaze fell on a middle-aged man who was not far away.

The middle-aged man wore a black robe and looked at Ye Xuan coldly!

“It’s him!”

“He’s an elder from the Blood Moon Temple, Li Tianyu!”

“It’s said that this guy reached the second level of the unity realm three years ago!”

“But no matter what, the people from the Blood Moon Temple are not good people. This young man might have to suffer!”

“There might be a good show to watch!”

The surrounding cultivators immediately recognized the identity of the middle-aged man.

The Blood Moon Temple was an extremely terrifying force in the Nanzhou Region. Its reputation was not inferior to the Nether God sect.

“It seems that you have a problem with me?”

Ye Xuan looked at Li Tianyu indifferently.

How could any super expert who could break through to the unity realm be a fool? It seemed that this guy was here to cause trouble.

The facts proved that Ye Xuan was right. Li Tianyu was indeed here to cause trouble.

Moreover, almost everyone from the Blood Moon Temple was evil. They did things as they pleased. If they took a fancy to your treasures and artifacts, they had no qualms robbing and killing you.

The Blood Moon Temple’s strength was extremely terrifying. Previously, several sects had joined forces to destroy the Blood Moon Temple, but not only did they not succeed, many even lost their lives.

Back then, the Great Qian Dynasty had also participated. In the past, the Great Qian Dynasty had unity realm experts, but lost them during that earth-shattering battle.

After that battle, the cultivators of the Blood Moon Temple acted without restraint.

When the others saw this, although they were displeased, they could do nothing about it. In any case, as long as the Blood Moon Temple did not find trouble with them, they would turn a blind eye.

This was the third time Li Tianyu had entered the mystic realm. Every time he entered the mystic realm, he would head directly to the Heavenly Lightning Pool to try and comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent.

However, up until now, he had not gained anything.

In one more day, the mystic realm would close. He would never have the chance to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent here again in his entire life!

Therefore, his words were driven by jealousy.

The eyes and ears of a unity realm expert were extremely sharp. He had heard the contents of the discussions of the cultivators around and learned that Ye Xuan was from the Great Qian Dynasty.

If he remembered correctly, the Great Qian Dynasty was a small empire that had also participated in that battle against the Blood Moon Temple!

A cultivator from such a backward empire had comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent? So what? What was there to be afraid of?

Moreover, this guy had just tempered his body with the power of tens of thousands of lightning bolts. He must have obtained a great opportunity.

Of course, to him, the notion that Ye Xuan had entered the unity realm at the age of 20 was simply utter nonsense.

Could it be that the cultivators of the Great Qian Dynasty could not distinguish the difference between the unity realm and the core formation realm?

Moreover, the cultivators who said that Ye Xuan had reached the unity realm were mostly purple spirit realm cultivators. How could such weak cultivators be able to distinguish the energy fluctuations of a unity realm expert?

Therefore, Li Tianyu firmly believed that Ye Xuan was definitely not a unity realm expert and chose to attack.

“Originally, I was already close to comprehending the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent, but because you drew thousands of lightning bolts to temper your body, my comprehension was seriously affected. If you are unable to give me sufficient compensation, you won’t be able to leave today!”

Li Tianyu looked at Ye Xuan coldly.

Ye Xuan conveniently checked out Li Tianyu’s comprehension value, which was only 220 points. With such lacking comprehension value, how could he even think of comprehending the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent?

He even wanted to blame it on Ye Xuan? How ridiculous!
