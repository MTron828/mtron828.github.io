Chapter 269: Sudden Changes In The Situation

“Who is the mastermind behind this situation?”

Ye Xuan frowned.

Unfortunately, his comprehension of karmic intent, so he could not sense the other party’s karmic thread during the battle.

Boom! Boom!

As the two sides fought, destructive energy fluctuations rippled out.

if it was in the outside world, these energy fluctuations would have been enough to destroy an empire.

“I can’t let this drag out for too long.”

Moments later, his sword, fire and wood intents fused.

Fortunately, he had perfect-level sword intent, which had greatly enhanced his strength.

Otherwise, Ye Xuan would not be able to fight these titan apes with just triple intent fusion!

“I’ll kill half of them first.”

The longsword in Ye Xuan’s hand erupted with dazzling sword qi, and he split the titan apes in half with one strike.

He was about to use his quadruple intent fusion to finish off half of them when he suddenly realized…

Someone was there! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s actually her!”

Ye Xuan checked it out and was speechless.

He had not expected that the energy fluctuations from his battle would attract Shangguan Wan’er.

In the distance, she was hovering in spatial turbulence, quietly watching Ye Xuan fight the titan apes, not wanting to interfere.

“What?”

However, while she was observing the fight, space rippled again, and another group of demonic beasts appeared. Aside from titan apes, there were also nether snakes and lightning giants.

Their eyes were bloodshot, and they attacked Shangguan Wan’er without hesitation.

Seeing this, her expression changed.

She did not expect to be targeted as well.

“Get lost!”

Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze turned cold, and a sharp sword qi erupted, instantly crushing a nether snake.

On the other side, Ye Xuan had fused fire, wind, sword and heavenly lightning intents.

However, this was not the end!

In the space turbulence, countless transparent small swords suddenly appeared, transforming into a sword formation that covered the sky and engulfed the eleven titan apes.

A middle-grade heaven-rank technique!

However, with Ye Xuan’s current strength, he could not unleash the full power of this martial technique.

Still, augmented by his perfect-level sword intent, the power of the sword formation was nothing to scoff at.

Buzzzzzz!

Moments later, the eleven titan apes instantly turned into fine powder, completely dead.

This was Ye Xuan’s most powerful sword strike!

‘Such power!’

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes flashed.

A mere tenth-level unity realm cultivator’s power actually made her heart palpitate.

Shangguan Wan’er became even more certain that Ye Xuan was the reincarnation of an ancient almighty expert.

On the other hand, Ye Xuan’s expression did not relax in the slightest after dealing with these titan apes.

The sense of danger in his heart had not dissipated.

Then…

Amidst the pitch-black spatial turbulence, an extremely violent aura suddenly filled the air.

Moments later, an incomparably huge hand suddenly tore space apart, revealing the figure of a huge black giant. The black giant’s aura was even more powerful than the titan ape’s.

Boom!

The black giant was almost 500 meters tall, and its mountain-like fist smashed toward Ye Xuan.

Clang!

At this moment, a huge tower suddenly appeared in front of Ye Xuan, blocking the black giant’s attack.

“Tower of Heaven?”

After Shangguan Wan’er killed a lightning giant with one strike, she spotted the Tower of Heaven that she had been looking for.

So it was in this guy’s hands!

The words ‘Tower of Heaven’ on the tower shone with a bright light. No matter how terrifying the black giant’s fist was, the Tower of Heaven remained undamaged.

Five profound patterns!

This black giant had also fused three martial intents, which gave Ye Xuan an unprecedented sense of pressure, which was why he chose to bring out the Tower of Heaven.

Still, although the black giant could not harm him now, neither could he do anything to it.

However, if Ye Xuan wanted to solve this predicament, there was a way.

As long as he engraved the profound pattern using his sword intent, he would be able to advance to the pattern condensation realm and kill this black giant with a single strike.

However, Ye Xuan did not do so.

At the very least, this black giant was not enough to force Ye Xuan into a desperate situation.

Sword Overlord body! Major mastery stage!

Innate dual spirit body! Major mastery stage!

In addition to his heaven-rank martial techniques!

Although Ye Xuan still could not fully display the power of these-heaven rank martial techniques, with the addition of his perfect-level sword intent, and the power of his quadruple intent fusion, Ye Xuan’s combat power would reach an unimaginable level.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Moments later, Ye Xuan slowly raised the longsword in his hand. The power of thousands of lightning bolts suddenly condensed, filling the air with a world-shaking aura!
