Chapter 17: Someone Else’s Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Thank you for your help, Elder Ye.”

Huang Ling and Xue Min came to the back of the firebird and bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan.

They had never been so close to Ye Xuan before. Looking at the idol that they had admired for so long, their cheeks could not help but burn. Their hearts could not help thumping hard.

Not only was Ye Xuan extremely talented, but he was also very handsome. His temperament was also unparalleled.

The most important thing was that he was only 20 years old this year. He could be said to be the ideal type in the hearts of the countless female cultivators in the Qingyun sect!

Seeing them, Ye Xuan waved his hand indifferently.

Putting aside the fact that these two were Lin Qing’s disciples, even if they were ordinary disciples of the Qingyun sect, if they encountered such a thing, he would not have hesitated to do the same.

Not only Ye Xuan would have done so, too. The other elders would do the same.

After all, in the great Qian Dynasty, the Qingyun sect was famous for protecting their own. Although there were some internal conflicts within the sect, they always united when it came to facing common enemies.

“When I left the sect, I was instructed by your teacher to bring you back to Qingyun sect if I met you two along the way. The competition between the three great sects is about to begin, so it’s time for you two to go back and participate!”

“I thought I wouldn’t see you two, but you guys were the first people we ran into on our first day out.”

Ye Xuan said with a smile.

......

“Junior sister and I have been training outside for two months. We wanted to come back soon, but we didn’t expect to find Dark Glacial Ice in the mountain range of the Death Zone!”

“We wanted to bring it back to the sect immediately, but we didn’t expect to get blocked by Duan Wujie and an adventuring team.”

Thinking of this, Huang Ling could not help but shudder once again in fear.

If Ye Xuan had not appeared in time, she and Xue Min might have really died here. The cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect were extremely vicious. In order to avoid information about Dark Glacial Frost having been found being spread around, Duan Wujie and the others might have chosen to silence them.

In the entire great Qian Dynasty, many cultivation practitioners were well aware of the Xuanyin sect’s style of doing thing.s

The cultivation practitioners of the Xuanyin sect were extremely arrogant, and they had countless grudges with the outside world. It was common for the cultivation practitioners of the sect to snatch treasures out of the hands of other cultivation practitioners.

The most infuriating thing was that they often used the strength of the Xuanyin sect to distort the truth!

Some of the cultivation practitioners who were not familiar with the style of the Xuanyin sect might believe their slander, but they would be extremely disdainful once they truly understood it.

The reason was simple: the Xuanyin sect did not differentiate right from wrong.

It was also because of this that Huang Ling and Xue Min knew very well that if they had agreed to Duan Wujie’s condition earlier, they would still not have let them off after annihilating the team of adventurers.

Most importantly, knowing the Xuanyin sect, they would definitely humiliate the cultivation practitioners before they slaughtered them.

Even if the Qingyun sect wanted to hold them accountable, they couldn’t do anything without a witness.

“What? You have Dark Glacial Frost?”

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s eyes lit up, and then his gaze fell upon the crystal in Huang Ling’s hand.

The crystal was crystal clear, and it was suffused with a faint icy power.

“If Elder Ye hadn’t appeared in time, the both of us would have died here. This Dark Glacial Frost can be considered a thank-you gift to Elder Ye!”

Huang Ling and Xue Min looked at each other and nodded in unison.

If not for Ye Xuan’s appearance, they would have perished at the hands of Duan Wujie, and might even have been humiliated before death. Compared to their own lives, what was mere frost?

Anyway, this treasure was going to be given to their idol. What was there to hesitate about?

“The frost in your hand is not small. It is more than enough to increase the innate bone values of three cultivators!”

Ye Xuan waved his hand slightly, and the ice in Huang Ling’s hand appeared in his palm.

In the next second, the ice in his palm suddenly split into three equal portions. Two portions fell into Huang Ling’s hand after that.

“I only need one portion. The rest is up to you to use!

“Okay, but I won’t take the ice for free!”

Ye Xuan thought for a moment before he took out two pills from his storage ring. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

One was a body-refining pill, and the other was a poison pill.

These two pills were the pills that Ye Xuan had gotten from Yue. His cultivation had already reached the true core state, so these two pills were not of much use to him.

However, they would be of great help to Huang Ling and Xue Min, two true essence state cultivators.

Ye Xuan flicked his finger lightly, and the two pills suddenly fell into their hands.

Huang Ling and Xue Min looked at each other, selected the pill they wanted, then bowed respectfully to Ye Xuan. Their eyes shone.

“Thank you for the pills, Elder Ye!”

The two of them had always admired Ye Xuan, but this had put him on an entirely different pedestal.

The two of them chatted for a while.

Huang Ling and Xue Min also learned that the girl next to Ye Xuan was called Yue. She was Ye Xuan’s new disciple he had just taken in.

For a moment, the two of them were filled with envy. They sighed in their hearts. Why weren’t they elder Ye Xuan’s disciples?!

One had to know that in the Qingyun sect, countless cultivators yearned to become Ye Xuan’s disciple. However, he used to have no intention of taking in a disciple at all. No one expected him to suddenly take one in now.

Yue was really enviable!

However, what happened next made Huang Ling and Xue Min even more envious of Yue.

Because Ye Xuan did not hesitate to give Yue his portion of Dark Glacial Frost!

Dark Glacial Frost was an extremely rare treasure that could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value!

Although the increase was limited, it was still enough to greatly help someone even at the core formation state out.

However, Ye Xuan did not hesitate to give it to Yue!

Even Master Lin Qing, who loved them very much, had never given them such a great gift!

[Ding! As the host has given his disciple Dark Glacial Frost, you have received a random 8-fold feedback critical hit. Congratulations, the host has obtained Mountain Chalcedony!]

A system notification sounded in Ye Xuan’s mind.

A clear and pure white liquid suddenly appeared in his storage space. This was also a rare treasure that could increase a cultivator’s innate bone value, and its effect was even more pronounced than Dark Glacial Frost’s!

‘This feedback is pretty good!’

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile.

Whether it was the Dark Glacial Frost that Xue Min and Ye Xuan had obtained, or the Mountain Chalcedony that the system had given him, these were all extremely rare natural treasures.

“Elder Ye, we’ve met a lot of cultivators from the Xuanyin sect recently. It feels like they’re plotting something!”

Just as the firebird was about to arrive at Yunhei City, Huang Ling suddenly spoke to Ye Xuan.

“The Xuanyin sect is secretly planning something?” Hearing this, Ye Xuan could not help but raise his eyebrows.

“That’s right. I’m sure that Elder Ye is also aware that the Xuanyin sect has been frantically recruiting more cultivators over the past few years!”
