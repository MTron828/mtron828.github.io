499 Sword Formation

With the power of the true dragon’s precious bone, Ye Xuan’s physical strength had reached an extremely terrifying level, no weaker than a heaven-rank magic artifact.

When it was used in conjunction with the Flora sword technique, if he still could not withstand Elder Taiyin’s attack, it would be better to bury himself shamefully.

“You…”

Elder Taiyin was furious. This guy was truly disrespectful!

!!

“Hahaha! I’m going to die of laughter. Isn’t this just the perfect face-smacking?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When the onlookers saw this scene, they gloated.

The destructive power of Ye Xuan’s words were as powerful as his two fingers!

Hahaha!

“Elder Taiyin was so arrogant earlier. Now just look at him! His face is as black as coal! He probably really, really hates Chief Ye Xuan now.”

“Hahaha! I didn’t think that Chief Ye Xuan could pull something like this off. It’s really surprising!”

Elder Taiyin naturally could hear all of this, which only served to incense him further.

He valued his reputation the most, but Ye Xuan’s actions and words had completely destroyed his reputation.

Now, he had been humiliated by both Tian Xuan and his disciple!

Who the f*ck could stand this?

Furthermore, by saying those words, Ye Xuan was clearly implying that the Immortal Divine sect’s sword technique was inferior to the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s sword technique.

How could he bear such a humiliation?

His gaze immediately turned cold as he said, “I originally wanted to show you mercy on account of my friendship with Tian Xuan. However, since you’re like this, I won’t hold back anymore!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion. A powerful suction force suddenly burst out, pulling back the Immortal Sword.

Moments later, the mysterious patterns on the Immortal Sword suddenly lit up, and the sky was filled with an extremely oppressive aura. As its sword qi spread out, a terrifying sword formation was formed.

Ye Xuan looked at the sword formation and frowned.

“This is interesting…” Ye Xuan’s lips curved into a playful smile.

When the onlookers saw this scene, their pupils constricted.

Some of the more knowledgeable cultivators recognized the origin of this formation. It was the inheritance from the Immortal Divine sect, the Immortal Sword formation!

It was a heaven-rank sword formation, and its power was no weaker than the Great Wilderness technique of the Great Wilderness Divine sect!

What puzzled everyone was that Ye Xuan seemed completely unfazed by this, and was even smiling. What the hell was going on?

“Ye Xuan, what I showed you earlier was just a trivial technique from my sect. I’ll let you see what a truly powerful secret technique from my sect looks like!”

As the powerful sword formation was formed, a confident smile appeared on Elder Taiyin’s face, and his gaze became arrogant again.

“Don’t blame me for not warning you in advance. The power of this formation is extremely terrifying, and once it’s activated, even I can’t completely control it!”

“If you accidentally die, don’t blame me.”

“Of course, if you choose to admit defeat now, I can still deactivate the formation. Don’t lose your life over a little conflict!”

Elder Taiyin hurled some threats before he completely activated the formation.

As long as Ye Xuan lowered his head and admitted his mistake, acknowledging the power of the inheritance of the Immortal Divine sect, he would let Ye Xuan go.

After all, his goal this time was the heavenly treasure. If he really used the Immortal Sword formation, it would consume a terrifying amount of his spiritual power.

However, the word “lose” did not exist in Ye Xuan’s dictionary, so how could he admit defeat?

He narrowed his eyes and the power of his spiritual sense swept out, studying the patterns on the ground.

A moment later, Ye Xuan suddenly raised his head, a faint smile on his lips.

“I’ve carefully observed this formation, and have decided that it is ordinary!”

“He really doesn’t know what’s good for him…”

Hearing this, Elder Taiyin was infuriated.

He had been about to spare Ye Xuan’s life, but this guy did not know what was good for him, and even mocked the formation.

Who the f*ck could endure this?

Elder Taiyin prepared to activate the spiritual power in his body to activate the formation.

At this moment, dazzling light suddenly flashed in the sky, and a giant sword fell from the sky, shining brightly.

When the crowd saw this scene, they were all dumbfounded.

Ye Xuan stood in the air and suddenly turned into a streak of light, arriving under the giant sword.

Then, an unparalleled sense of oppression swept out.

The cultivators within a hundred miles trembled. Their bones made a crackling sound, as if unable to bear the terrifying pressure.

“This… Don’t tell me this is the f*cking sword formation of Cloud Sky peak?”

“In comparison, Elder Taiyin’s technique is trash…”

Under the dazzling divine light of the giant sword, all the flowers, plants, and trees within a radius of several hundred kilometers turned into sword qi gales that were filled with extremely dense life force. Then, the shone brilliantly, as specks of light gathered together, forming a terrifying formation that simply screamed danger.

The originally ordinary-looking plants and trees turned into extremely sharp divine swords within this terrifying domain.
