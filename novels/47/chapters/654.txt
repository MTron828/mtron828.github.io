655 Sealed?

Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun also came over and looked at their teacher with concern.

Ye Xuan rubbed Xiang Yun’s head. This girl seemed to have changed a lot after tearing down the study hall. It seemed that she was holding a lot of things back, and that he had to find some time to have a good chat with her.

Unlike his other two disciples, Xiang Yun needed more attention and care. After all, she was only six years old, and there were some things she would not understand unless it was explained to her properly.

Her sense of logic was also quite warped, which needed to be dealt with.

Not long ago, Ye Xuan had discovered something rather shocking when he had examined Xiang Yun.

It was not that she could not read, but rather that her ability to read had been sealed. This left him dumbfounded.

Why was such a thing sealed?

It did not make any sense. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Furthermore, Ye Xuan realized that even as a peak-level supreme realm expert, he was unable to unlock this seal. Still, he could tell that as she grew older, the seal would dissipate by itself.

As such, Ye Xuan could only let nature take its course. Hopefully, the truth would become clear in the future…

The only thing he could help her with now was to help her improve her body refining cultivation level and maximize her potential.

“Alright, Yun’er, stay close to your senior sisters and don’t wander around, alright?”

“Got it, Teacher. Don’t worry. I’m a good girl.”

As soon as she finished speaking, Xiang Yun ran over to Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

At this moment, Yuelun also came over. Her expression seemed somewhat dejected as shesaid, “Junior Brother Ye, your cultivation level is rising too quickly. I can’t keep up with your pace.”

She was only a peak-level mystic lord realm cultivator, and needed another push before she could break through and reach the supreme realm. This meant that she was behind Ye Xuan by a whole major realm, despite her best efforts at cultivation.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “That’s right. I’ve always been a fast man, you know.”

Yuelun immediately laughed and replied, “Is that so? How pitiful…”

He was shocked by her reply, as he knew exactly what she was implying.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, you weren’t like this before…”

Yuelun glanced at Ye Xuan indifferently.

“You were the one who taught me about these things.”

“Do you think you’re the only one who can talk dirty?”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan instantly broke out in cold sweat. He felt that what Yuelun said was quite right.

Ye Xuan then laughed evilly and slowly moved closer to Yuelun’s ear. After making sure that no one was within an earshot, he whispered, “I’m very talented in all aspects. If you have time in the future, let’s discuss these things in depth. Then I can show you how amazing I am.”

Upon hearing this, Yuelun’s first reaction was actually joy, which was immediately replaced by shyness.

She could only pretend to be unfazed and smile as she replied, “Alright…”
