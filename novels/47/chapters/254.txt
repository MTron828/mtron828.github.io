Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Buzzzzzz!

A streak of sword qi that was so bright that the world around them seemed to dim in comparison engulfed the Great Elder of the Nether God sect.

His body turned to ashes, and his soul dissipated.

The Great Elder of the Nether God sect had fallen!

With a wave of his hand, Ye Xuan swept the storage ring into his hand.

Everyone looked at this scene in a daze. It was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

A tenth-level unity realm expert had been killed just like that?

As expected of Ye Xuan!

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.

“I’ll use this as a token!”

Ye Xuan waved his sleeve, and a jade token containing his spiritual sense fell into the Gongsun family’s Grand Elder’s hand.

The latter received it with excitement.

This was a symbol of Ye Xuan’s friendship!

They would be able to obtain the other party’s help with this!

After what had happened just now, he realized how terrifying Ye Xuan was.

“Many thanks!”

He bowed gratefully.

Ye Xuan nodded with an indifferent expression, and then his figure suddenly disappeared.

“What terrifying strength!”

Looking at Ye Xuan’s disappearing figure, everyone’s hearts were filled with various emotions.

Ye Xuan’s strength was no longer within the scope of their understanding.

…

The elders of the three major forces had basically been cleaned up. The master of the Blood Moon Temple was the only one unaccounted for. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The master of the Blood Moon Temple had escaped using a secret technique that Qian Daoliu had left him, which allowed him to cover his tracks.

He had to leave the Nanzhou Region and find Qian Daoliu. The closest location where they could meet up was the Luoyun Region.

Unfortunately, there were dozens of regions separating the Nanzhou Region and the Luoyun Region, which was connected to the south of the Yunqing Region.

With the help of the secret technique left behind by Qian Daoliu, he had successfully concealed his aura and avoided the detection of countless cultivators as he hurried in the direction of Luoyun Region.

Of course, if he was encountered by Ye Xuan, he would definitely not be able to escape death.

After searching for a few days, Ye Xuan also chose to return to the Great Qian Dynasty.

However, the commotion in the Nanzhou Region continued. After all, Ye Xuan had said that as long as the master of the Blood Moon Temple was not found, his bounty would be effective.

There were countless cultivators searching for him everywhere.
