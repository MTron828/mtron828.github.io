793 Purification

Under Hua Rufeng’s lead, the members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, shouted and charged towards the vengeful spirits,

Even Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun were filled with fighting spirit.

“First Sister, should we go and fight as well?”

Feng Xiyun came over to Zhuge Yueyue’s side. She flipped her palm and a ball of raging flames instantly appeared above it.

This type of flame just happened to restrain these vengeful spirits. As long as they touched these flames, they would be purified.

Zhuge Yueyue glanced at her teacher and agreed. As disciples of Cloud Sky peak, they had to follow the example their teacher set.

“Kill them!”

Zhuge Yueyue unhesitatingly took out her sword and rushed forward. As a middle-stage heaven realm expert, there were not many vengeful spirits capable of fighting her.

Looking at this scene, everyone sighed with admiration. Ye Xuan’s disciples were just as heroic as he was.

Looking at the chaotic battle below, Ye Xuan did not say anything. He hovered in the sky and watched, his attention never leaving his two disciples.

He was very happy to see them take the initiative to join the fight.

At the same time, he took out the Soul Beckoning Banner and the black lotus, which were his spoils of battle. The black lotus was contaminated by the strange power, but fortunately, Ye Xuan possessed the purifying power of the Chaos Immortal Peach, so cleansing it was not out of the question.

It would make a good gift for Yanran.

However, he frowned when he looked at the Soul Beckoning Banner. This thing was really too vicious.

Over the past hundreds and thousands of years, the Strange Realm had relied on this vicious artifact to conquer one world after another.

As a result, there were too many vengeful spirits in this magical artifact. Heavenly King Li had only managed to release a small number of them just now.

If he was more powerful and had more time, he would have been able to release enough vengeful spirits to completely engulf Sky Mountain.

“Such a vicious weapon should not exist in this world,” Ye Xuan said to himself, and his hands moved, instantly releasing waves of purifying power into the Soul Beckoning Banner, which destroyed the vengeful spirits inside.

“Don’t…”

Painful cries were heard from the Soul Beckoning Banner. The vengeful spirits inside were all people slaughtered by the strange monsters. After they were slaughtered, they became tools for the strange monsters to conquer the various worlds.

They would be trapped in this banner forever, unable to reincarnate. What awaited them was endless purgatory.

After hearing their resentful voices, Ye Xuan almost could not bear to continue.

However, he could not be merciful in this situation. Otherwise, more lives would be lost.

“Sigh … You can’t blame me for this. If you want to blame someone, blame the strange realm.”

“The only thing I can do for you now is to make this quick.”

Ye Xuan intended to use his full power to destroy the Soul Beckoning Banner immediately and end their suffering as quickly as possible, but at this moment, a voice rang out.

“Martial Nephew Ye, leave this matter to me.”

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan turned around and saw Daoist Yi Feng standing behind him. After thinking for a moment, he understood.

He recalled that during the hundred years of Daoist Yi Feng’s seclusion, the latter had been trying to comprehend the Dao of Reincarnation.

He had heard about this from his teacher before. Daoist Yi Feng felt guilty about what had happened a hundred years ago, and he did not want those who had died in that battle to become wandering souls. Thus, he had focused his efforts on comprehending the Dao of Reincarnation, hoping that once he mastered it, he would be able to return to the battlefield and successfully rescue the souls of the fallen members of the Great Wilderness Divine sect back then and help them to reincarnate.

Not too long ago, Daoist Yi Feng had managed to reach the great success stage in his cultivation of the Dao of Reincarnation. Thus, it was best to leave this matter to him.

Ye Xuan handed the Soul Beckoning Banner over to Daoist Yi Feng and said, “Martial Uncle Yi Feng, I’ll leave it in your hands then.”

Daoist Yi Feng only smiled and did not reply. Waves of red light emanated from his body and wrapped around the Soul Beckoning Flag.

Ye Xuan watched closely as Daoist Yi Feng raised both hands, after which the clouds in the sky began to part, and a door filled with the aura of reincarnation appeared.

Just as he was about to release the vengeful spirits from the banner, he sensed that the resentment of these vengeful spirits was too dense. If he rashly released them, he might not be able to control the situation.

“Martial Nephew Ye, come over and lend me a hand.”

There was no way for him to send these vengeful spirits into reincarnation alone. Only with the help of Ye Xuan’s purifying power could he succeed.

Ye Xuan nodded and immediately released his purifying power.

A huge green lotus appeared in the sky that emitted rays of green light into the surroundings. When touched by this green light, all of the vengeful spirits and mutated beasts below stopped in unison.

Everyone looked at the lotus in the sky in puzzlement.

“What exactly is going on?”

After seeing this scene, even Mengyu was very surprised. After all, this was the first time she had seen a technique that seemed to be able to purify all living beings.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
