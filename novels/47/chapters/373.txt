“Yueyue, you’ve really reached the divine mystic realm?”

Li Xue’er held Zhuge Yueyue’s hand tightly and asked.

Zhuge Yueyue looked at her friend’s shocked expression and laughed inwardly.

Everyone had thought that her future was over and done for after she became Ye Xuan’s disciple.

Yet no one knew her teacher’s real capabilities, nor his generosity and kindness.

!!

Zhuge Yueyue nodded and said with a calm expression, “Teacher has been very good to me. In order to help my cultivation advance, he even gave me ten years’s worth of cultivation. That’s how I was able to reach the divine mystic realm in five days.”

“What do you mean? Martial Uncle Ye performed spiritual power infusion for you?” Hearing that, Li Xue’er’s face turned pale.

When Yuelun heard this, she raised her brows and looked at Ye Xuan, who had an indifferent expression, in shock.

Was this guy’s brain damaged? Why would he damage his own cultivation foundation for his disciple?

Furthermore, this guy was supposed to be a second-level divine mystic realm cultivator, right? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ten years’ worth of his cultivation would be nowhere close to enough to help Zhuge Yueyue reach the divine mystic realm.

Immediately, a bright light flashed across the depths of Yuelun’s eyes as she tried to sense Ye Xuan’s cultivation level.

However, at this moment, an invisible force suddenly blocked her, causing her to take a few steps back.

The strength of that invisible force was no weaker than hers.

At this moment, Yuelun finally understood.

“Junior Brother Ye, it seems that you like playing the pig to eat the tiger. Even Senior Sister has been deceived by you for a hundred years. I thought your cultivation had only reached the second level of the divine mystic realm!”

Hearing this, Ye Xuan smiled faintly.

“Senior Sister, you must be joking. I never said that my cultivation level had only reached the second level of the divine mystic realm. That’s something that everyone seems to believe for some unknown reason, though. It’s got nothing to do with me.”

Yuelun’s mouth twitched when she heard this.

It seemed that she had made the trip to Cloud Sky peak for nothing today.

Given what she had discovered today, Zhuge Yueyue’s future was limitless, and perhaps even Ye Xuan’s was.

No wonder this girl was not tempted by her invitation. Who would be willing to leave if they had such a powerful teacher who generously performed spiritual power infusion?

Suddenly, Yuelun glanced at Li Xue’er indifferently.

This wretched girl did not cultivate properly and insisted on dragging her to Cloud Sky peak. Now, both her and her disciple had lost face.

After some time, Yuelun finally calmed down.

Moments later, Yuelun appeared to have thought of something. She walked to Ye Xuan’s side with light steps and displayed a rather profound smile.

From Ye Xuan’s perspective, Yuelun’s curvy figure was on full display. Fortunately, he was used to seeing all kinds of beautiful women, so he was able to maintain his poker face.

Zhuge Yueyue’s expression changed when she saw this.

She felt an inexplicable sense of danger, and was afraid that Yuelun would seduce her teacher. Inwardly, she was screaming, ‘Teacher, don’t fall for it!’

Although Zhuge Yueyue was rather anxious, she had no solution.

Yuelun took a deep look at Ye Xuan, and the corners of her mouth curved up into a smile that made one’s heart flutter.

“What’s Junior Brother Ye’s current cultivation level? Can you tell Senior Sister? There’s a reward!”

She was very confident in her figure. At least within the Great Wilderness Divine sect, no one had ever been able to resist the temptation of her beauty.

However, her expression changed when she noticed that Ye Xuan did not even seem to be the slightest bit flustered. Rather, he had a playful smile on her face.

She felt that something was amiss.

‘This damn guy actually ignored my seduction!’

‘Detestable! Don’t tell me that he cultivated till his brain was damaged while being alone for a hundred years?’

‘Is he lacking in that department?’

Yuelun ridiculed him inwardly.

That being said, Ye Xuan’s behavior had indeed shocked her. This was completely different from the Ye Xuan that she knew.

Was this still the same f*cking person?

With a dissatisfied expression, she returned to her seat.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a smile.

“Senior Sister Yuelun, your complexion looks off. Could it be that you are feeling unwell?”

“I happen to have some attainments in the field of medicine. I can help examine your body for any problems.”

Yuelun’s mouth twitched when she heard this.

This guy was really too much. Not only did he ignore her so brazenly, but now he even wanted to make a move.

She felt like stabbing his nether regions.

“There’s no need to trouble Junior Brother with such things, I am perfectly fine,” Yuelun said indifferently, but she also felt a sense of defeat in his heart.

When she regained her calm, her gaze unconsciously fell on Zhuge Yueyue. That guy’s brain definitely had a screw loose. He was not attracted to her, and was willing to sacrifice ten years’ worth of his cultivation for his disciple. Throughout the entire history of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, he was the first one to have done this.
