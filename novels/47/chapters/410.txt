411 I’ll Cut You Into Pieces

A sneer formed on the corners of his mouth.

Regardless of whether Feng Xiyun was the princess of the divine empire, as long as she was unable to prove her identity, Lin Dong would be able to deal with her as a fake.

Moreover, even if the royal family pursued the matter, he would have an excuse.

‘Hehe! If I can enjoy this beautiful princess , my life will not have been in vain!’

When he thought of this, a lecherous glint flashed across the depths of Lin Dong’s eyes. The scene of Feng Xiyun being conquered by him was already being played out in his mind.

!!

Moments later, as he looked at Feng Xiyun, he waved his hand.

“Capture all of them.”

“Who gave you the guts to do that?”

When Su Changhe saw this, he was furious.

“Hehe! He’s just a piece of trash from the Su family. Bring this guy back too!”

Lin Dong was too lazy to care. Right now, he only wanted to capture Feng Xiyun and bring her back.

After Lin Dong’s words rang out, the cultivators of the Lin family behind him immediately took action.

Elder Chen’s face was grave. His spiritual power surged out and blocked most of the cultivators.

However, at this moment, two streaks of light suddenly flashed past from the corner of the street. They were two old men in red robes, both of whom were ninth-level void realm experts.

Seeing this, Elder Chen’s expression changed drastically.

As expected, Lin Dong definitely had backup.

At this moment, Han Sikong was watching all of this from the top floor of Qingyang Restaurant.

However, he did not make a move.

The reason was very simple. His spiritual sense could detect the impending arrival of a terrifying expert.

“Young Master, I’ll do my best to hold them back. Please leave with the three ladies!”

Elder Chen unleashed his full power to block the attacks of the cultivators as he spoke to Su Changhe anxiously.

Even with two ninth-level void realm experts facing him, Elder Chen was not at a disadvantage in this battle.

“Hehe! Since you’re already here, why are you leaving?”

Suddenly, an arrogant voice rang out.

Moments later, a powerful aura burst forth, and then a middle-aged man with a burly figure turned into a streak of light and suddenly appeared.

“Lin Youming!”

Seeing this, Elder Chen’s expression changed drastically.

Lin Youming was the head of the Lin family, and a terrifying heaven realm expert.

“With me around, no one will be able to save you!”

As soon as Lin Youming appeared, he clapped his hands, and a powerful force burst out that severely injured Elder Chen.

If Elder Chen had not reacted in time, he would have died.

Right at this moment, another extremely terrifying aura suddenly descended.

“Lin Youming, you b*stard, if you dare to touch even a hair on my precious son’s head, I’ll cut you into pieces!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a middle-aged man with a dignified gaze suddenly appeared. He held a large saber in his hand and walked forward step by step.

“Father!”

Su Changhe was ecstatic when he saw Su Tiansheng. His nervousness vanished.

“Son, don’t worry, your father is here. No one will be able to touch you today!” Su Tiansheng’s voice was majestic, and his eyes were filled with anger.

He did not expect that someone would dare to bully his precious son in his own territory.

In an instant, Su Tiansheng had already arrived in front of Su Changhe. He checked on Elder Chen’s injuries and instantly became even more furious.

“I didn’t think that your Lin family would be so shameless. You’re actually bullying people with numbers!”

“Alright! Then let me experience the Lin family’s abilities!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the big saber in Su Tiansheng’s hand blossomed with a sharp saber qi that cut through the sky and slashed toward Lin Youming.

Lin Youming snorted coldly, and the surging power in his body also swept out as he began to fight Su Tiansheng.

The two of them were both heaven realm experts, and having been rivals for many years, they were equally matched during their past encounters.

However, Su Tiancheng’s fury this time allowed him to gain the upper hand.

While the two heaven realm experts were fighting, the cultivators around them were not idle.

Now that Elder Chen was severely injured and could no longer resist, it was undoubtedly the best time to take down Su Changhe and the others.

At that moment, an old man in a black robe suddenly appeared beside Su Changhe. This old man was Elder Lin. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

‘Damn it! It’s another heaven realm expert!’

‘I didn’t expect the Su family to dispatch all of their heaven realm experts. This is going to be tricky!’

Upon seeing this, Lin Dong cursed inwardly. Soon after, he hurriedly retreated behind his subordinates.

In the end, the outcome of this fight depended on Su Tiansheng and Lin Youming.

Both sides unleashed their own powerful abilities and collided with each other in the sky. The powerful shockwaves wreaked havoc on the ground, and cracks appeared on the ground, and many buildings were destroyed.

“Hehe! I can’t believe that you haven’t made any progress after more than ten years!” Su Tiansheng was getting braver as the battle progressed. The saber in his hand created saber qi that filled the sky, suppressing Lin Youming.

Su Tiansheng’s attacks were occasionally wounding Lin Youming.

As time passed, Lin Youming’s aura started to diminish, and his figure started to look a little pathetic.

Although the Su family’s overall strength was indeed inferior to the Lin family’s, Su Tiansheng had an extremely powerful divine bone.

Before this, Su Tiansheng had previously fought two heaven realm experts without being at a disadvantage.

This was also the true reason why the Su family was able to establish itself in Qingyang City.

“Su Tiansheng, don’t tell me you want to fight the Lin family to the death for three little girls?”

After discovering that he was no match for Su Tiansheng, Lin Youming started threatening him.

What surprised him was that the Su family, which had always been conservative, seemed to have gone crazy today. Even Su Tiansheng, this old man, had personally taken action.

This was too f*cking strange, was it not?

“Are you kidding me? You’ve already sent people to bully my precious son. Do you think I will hold back anymore?”

Su Tiansheng’s lips curled into a sneer, and the saber in his hand knocked Lin Youming down from the sky with a powerful strike.

Lin Youming’s body smashed into the ground, and a huge hole appeared at the impact site.

Pfft!

Lin Youming could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood. He quickly crushed a token in his storage ring.

Very quickly, black shadows appeared in the surroundings one after the other, surrounding the entire Street.

These were the Lin family’s experts!

Seeing this, Su Tiansheng’s expression changed.

It was obvious that the Lin family had already set up an ambush on the streets!
