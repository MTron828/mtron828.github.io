483 The Reappearance Of The Black Tortoise

At this moment, the black-spotted lion beast was dumbfounded. It was questioning its entire existence.

‘F*ck, that’s too much. Although I’m a little weak, I’m still a descendant of an ancient beast. Can’t you show me some respect?’

They were all chatting. What were they talking about?

In the beginning, Ye Xuan and Su Changhe had been attracted by the fight between Bei Xuantian and this black-spotted lion beast, which was why this entire situation had unfolded in the first place.

!!

However, throughout the threats and discussions, the black-spotted lion beast had been ignored.

“You damned animal, I’m going to skin you alive!”

Bei Xuantian’s gaze finally turned toward the black-spotted lion beast, and his eyes were almost spitting fire. Then, the saber in his hand released a sharp saber qi that flew toward the beast and instantly split it in two. This was the only avenue by which he could vent his anger.

By this time, Ye Xuan and Su Changhe were already approaching the archaic divine mountains. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Su Changhe finally could not suppress his curiosity and asked, “Chief Ye Xuan, was that second prince the one betrothed to Sister Xiyun?”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded lightly.

“Then why didn’t you just kill him? That way, we can get rid of the root of the problem once and for all,” Su Changhe said innocently.

Ye Xuan’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

Was there a hole in this guy’s brain? Why did he always make things sound so simple?

“Brat, remember this. Not everything can be simply solved by force!”

“Even if you kill Bei Xuantian, there are other princes in the Haihan divine empire. As long as the two empires want to ally with each other, the marriage alliance will always be a viable option.”

“Therefore, instead of perpetuating that cycle, it’s best to exert pressure and get them to change the marriage partner.”

“You have to be clear that the value of the living is always higher than that of the dead, okay?”

Ye Xuan looked at Su Changhe deeply.

Su Changhe’s eyes brightened when he heard that, but he soon put on a confused expression again.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan shook his head helplessly.

It seemed like he needed to find time to fix this brat’s way of thinking. Other than the fact that this guy was pretty good at acting cool, he was simply unsightly in other aspects.

In any case, that was a problem for another day. It was best to focus on the matter at hand.

Ye Xuan waved his hand,and then stepped forward.

Su Changhe quickly followed after him. Although he did not really understand, he was at least clear about one thing.

‘Big Boss is really Big Boss. The way he thinks is completely different from ordinary people. Looks like I’ll have to ask Big Sister Xiyun for advice in the future.”

“If Big Sister Xiyun knew that Chief Ye Xuan had faced off against two empires to deal with her marriage problem, she would probably be endlessly grateful.”

Su Changhe could not help but feel his blood boil when he thought about what had transpired just now.

It was a pity that an actual fight had not broken out though. He wanted to see Ye Xuan in action.

As night slowly descended, the archaic divine mountains fell both dark and silent.

In the southern section, there was a bonfire in the middle of a forest. A group of cultivators were seated in front of the fire.

There were also familiar faces among them. They were the Reincarnation Fairy, who had interacted with Ye Xuan in Qingyun city, and Situ Mo.

The bonfire glowed dazzlingly in the night, but the Reincarnation Fairy’s eyes darted toward the nearby forest area..

She had an ominous feeling. The forest was too quiet, so quiet that it was too strange.

“Uncle Situ, don’t you feel that something is wrong? Isn’t this forest a little too quiet?”

The Reincarnation Fairy suddenly asked.

When Situ Mo heard this, he was puzzled. He quickly checked his surroundings and did not find anything amiss.

“This environment is too quiet and strange. I suddenly have an ominous feeling about this place. It feels like the calm before the storm.”

“Girl, you’re being too nervous. Are you sure you’re not hallucinating?”

“The archaic divine mountains are dangerous, so isn’t it normal for them to be a bit quieter?”

Situ Mo was unable to detect anything unusual with his spiritual sense.

Seeing this, the Reincarnation Fairy could only nod and hope for the best.

However, she could not shake that feeling of uneasiness.

They were here to pursue the heaven devouring divine sparrow.

According to the information they had received, the last place the heaven devouring divine sparrow had been spotted was nearby this place.

However, they had searched this area for nearly a day to no avail. It was really strange.

“It’s quite late now. You should rest early. We’ll continue the search tomorrow morning.”

“Just now, the grand elder’s group sent news that they arrived in the depths of the archaic divine mountains. They will likely obtain some gains very soon.”

Situ Mo smiled and returned to his tent. He then instructed a few disciples to stay outside and keep watch.

The Reincarnation Fairy nodded. She was indeed a little tired.

Then, she turned around and went back to her tent to rest.

Time passed slowly, and the moment when dawn arrived…

The area around them suddenly trembled violently.

“What happened?”

Situ Mo, who had sensed the commotion, rushed out of the tent. When he looked up at the sky, he was stunned.

...

“This… What is this…”

An incomparably huge tortoise had suddenly appeared and was slowly advancing. With every step this huge tortoise took, the entire area trembled violently.

The most eye-catching thing was the huge coffin on its back, which seemed to be filled with rich life energy.

“Could that coffin be the legendary heavenly treasure?”

Everyone recovered from their shock and stared greedily at the coffin.

Situ Mo was also very surprised. He had not expected to encounter the legendary black tortoise like this.

“Uncle Situ, why is this tortoise carrying the heavenly treasure here?”

The Reincarnation Fairy also walked out. Her gaze was locked onto the black tortoise. Even as the Saintess of the Jade Lake Divine sect, she had never seen such a powerful giant beast.

Just its aura alone was enough to make her soul tremble, and she almost lost her balance.

Situ Mo also shook his head.

“I’m not too sure, but I have a strange feeling that the appearance of this black tortoise is not a good sign.”

...

The heavenly treasure it was carrying was extremely alluring, and overflowed with life force.

Situ Mo guessed that the heavenly treasure hidden in the coffin was most likely a rare longevity divine treasure. This was likely what had attracted the attention of the heaven devouring divine sparrow
