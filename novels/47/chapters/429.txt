430 Limitless Future

Right at this moment Gao Shun put down his pride and asked, “Junior Brother Ye, can you tell us what you taught him? How did Martial Nephew Hua enter a state of epiphany?”

Ye Xuan smiled and said lightly, “Truth be told, I didn’t pay much attention to Martial Nephew Hua at that time. I was actually teaching my disciples, and Martial Nephew Hua was listening by the side. I honestly didn’t expect him to suddenly have an epiphany.”

“Uh…”

Everyone’s mouth twitched when they heard this.

This was indeed very sudden. Most importantly, this guy had actually said this so calmly.

The chiefs pondered this matter briefly.

Damn it! This guy had definitely made up nonsense to confuse them.

How could some random teachings be enough to make a bystander suddenly experience an epiphany?

He was clearly hiding something!

At this moment, the spiritual energy gathering around Hua Rufeng became more and more intense. The vortex of spiritual energy erupted with dazzling light.

A mysterious light then burst forth from Hua Rufeng’s body, which then seemed to draw all of the spiritual energy into his body.

“It’s about to start!”

When Gongsun Shouyue saw this, he immediately became nervous.

Given the vastness of the spiritual energy gathered here, everyone was wondering how much Hua Rufeng’s cultivation would progress.

At this moment, Hua Rufeng’s expression suddenly turned pale and pained.

It was as if the meridians in his body could not withstand this vast power.

However, with the infusion of this power, Hua Rufeng’s cultivation level also improved rapidly.

Fifth-level materialization realm!

Sixth level materialization realm!

…

Ninth-level materialization realm!

“Hiss!”

When everyone saw this, they sucked in a breath of cold air.

This guy has actually increased his cultivation by five levels!

This was indeed a once-in-a-century opportunity for him.

“It seems like the ninth level is his limit. If he wants to break through to the void realm, he must comprehend the power of laws.”

“I wonder if he can do it before the epiphany ends…”

The scene suddenly turned quiet, for fear that their voices would disturb Hua Rufeng’s epiphany.

At this moment, Ye Xuan took a step forward and suddenly walked toward Hua Rufeng, speaking naturally and indifferently.

Ye Xuan’s words were like the voice from the heavens as he guided Hua Rufeng’s breakthrough.

In an instant, the spiritual sea in Hua Rufeng’s body suddenly trembled. Mysterious ripples rippled with the power of the two extremes of the world. In the deepest part of the spiritual sea, a special force suddenly condensed.

This was the power of the laws!

“What? He actually succeeded?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When everyone saw this, they were shocked.

Ye Xuan had only said a few sentences, yet Hua Rufeng had managed to comprehend the power of the laws and successfully broke through to the void realm.

Boom!

Hua Rufeng’s body suddenly trembled, and his newfound void realm spiritual power rippled out. As he had just reached the void realm, he was unable to control the power in his body. Fortunately, Ye Xuan was right next to him. With a light wave of his sleeve, he suppressed the surging spiritual power.

After Hua Rufeng woke up, he knelt down in Ye Xuan’s direction.

“Rufeng will remember Martial Uncle Ye Xuan’s guidance,” he said gratefully.

Thanks to Ye Xuan’s words, he had actually reached the void realm!

He finally understood why the disciples of Cloud Sky peak were so powerful. It was their teacher that made the difference.

Seeing his own disciple kneel before someone else, Gongsun Shouyue felt slightly frustrated. Having said that, he was quite pleased with Hua Rufeng, and his attitude toward Ye Xuan also changed.

Hua Rufeng would be the successor to the sect master position in the future if everything went well. As such, the more outstanding he was, the better.

“Martial Nephew Hua, please get up!”

“You were able to reach the void realm because of your own comprehension ability. Without your level of talent, even if I spoke a million words, it would not have helped,” Ye Xuan said very calmly.

When everyone heard, a sense of admiration spontaneously arose in their hearts.

From then on, they would no longer doubt Ye Xuan’s ability to teach disciples.

Hua Rufeng slowly stood up, and he put on his usual smile. He first bowed to his teacher, and then saluted the other chiefs.

However, a careful person would find that Hua Rufeng’s behavior seemed to have changed and had become more casual than before.

He was different from the calm and steady person who pursued perfection wholeheartedly before this. When the chiefs realized this, they realized that his state of mind had also achieved a breakthrough, and that his future was now limitless.
