Chapter 193: The Truth?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Originally, because the life source in her body was about to be exhausted, not only was her aura weakened, but her body had aged rapidly.

Now, after the pill restored her life source, not only was Lin Qingping’s face ruddy, but her entire body was aglow.

Although she did not immediately recover to her previous peak condition, she was definitely able to use much more of her power now.

As long as she completely refined the medicinal effects of this pill, not only would she be able to completely recover, but her cultivation level might increase as well. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Still, the medicinal strength of the pill was not something that could be completely refined overnight.

Lin Qingping naturally knew this, so she was not in a hurry.

Moreover, compared to her own situation, she was more curious about what had happened to her precious daughter? From her daughter’s words, it seemed that this little girl had taken someone as her teacher?

“Yan ‘er, tell Mother everything that has happened in the past few days, okay?” Lin Qingping asked after bringing Zhao Yuyan back to the bamboo house.

“I… secretly went to the mystic realm…”

Zhao Yuyan’s small hands gripped the corners of her clothes tightly. She lowered her head and did not dare to look at her mother.

She knew that her mother must have been extremely worried during these few days that she had disappeared.

“What? You said that you went to the mystic realm to pick spiritual herbs for me?”

When Lin Qingping heard these words, her lips could not stop trembling. Her eyes instantly turned red.

She did not think that her precious daughter would be so bold. She dared to go to the mystic realm as a mere second-level refinement realm cultivator.

Did this girl not know how dangerous the mystic realm was? It was the kind of place where the slightest carelessness could lead to death.

However, when she realized that her precious daughter was doing it for her sake, Lin Qingping was very touched. She could not blame her precious daughter and continued to hold her in her arms.

“You silly girl, even if it was for Mother’s illness, you can’t take such risks!”

“Do you know? If something really happened to you, Mother would not be able to live on.”

“It’s all my fault as a mother. I couldn’t provide my precious daughter with a good life. It’s all Mother’s fault!”

At this point, Lin Qingping could not stop her tears from falling.

If Zhao Yuyan really had an accident in the mystic realm, she definitely would not have been able to live on alone.

“Mother, I’m sorry. I made you worry. It’s all my fault!”

Zhao Yuyan hugged her mother tightly, her heart filled with self-blame.

After a long time, the mother and daughter pair slowly calmed down.

“Yan’er, you haven’t explained how you came across the teacher you mentioned just now.”

Lin Qingping looked at Zhao Yuyan.

“I met Teacher in the mystic realm. Teacher treated me very well, and taught me many high-level martial techniques and cultivation methods. He even helped me restrain my Demon Devourer Body!”

Thinking of Ye Xuan, Zhao Yuyan could not help but smile sweetly.

She also did not expect that other than her parents, there would be someone else who would be so good to her.

As long as her mother’s injuries could be healed, she would stay by her teacher’s side in the future and repay her teacher’s kindness.

Hearing this, Lin Qingping stared blankly.

She naturally knew how many cold looks her daughter had received over the years because of her condition.

Ever since her daughter was young, she had never had a partner or a friend. Even when she was with her mother, she rarely smiled.

Lin Qingping could tell that Zhao Yuyan’s smile just now was from the bottom of her heart. This little girl really liked her teacher.

“Yan ‘er, what was that about the Demon Devourer Body? You said that your teacher taught you high-level martial techniques and cultivation methods? And even raised your cultivation level?”

Lin Qingping asked with a puzzled face.

“Other than mother and father, Teacher is the person who treats me the best. This is what happened…”

At the mention of Ye Xuan, the corners of Zhao Yuyan’s mouth could not help but curl up.

Then, Zhao Yuyan told Lin Qingping everything about Ye Xuan.

After hearing this, Lin Qingping’s eyes were filled with shock.

Although Zhao Yuyan was incapable of describing Ye Xuan’s strength in detail, she could roughly deduce Ye Xuan’s cultivation realm from these details.

Even the master of the White Moon Tower, a top-tier golden core realm expert, could not decipher what kind of constitution Zhao Yuyan had. They had also simply thought that Zhao Yuyan was born a jinx.

However, this little girl’s teacher actually discovered her special constitution? And even used pills to help her suppress the Demon Devourer Body?

Only a unity realm expert was capable of such a feat, right?

Thinking this, Lin Qingping’s heart was extremely shocked. Her precious daughter actually had a unity realm expert as her teacher?

“Demon Devourer Body… Demon Devourer Body… so that’s how it is!”

At the same time, Lin Qingping finally understood why all sorts of bad luck would happen to anyone who got close to her precious daughter.

It turned out that her precious daughter was not a jinx. Instead, the special constitution awakened in her body was too overbearing, forcefully devouring the fate and life force of the people around her.

The Demon Devourer Body was an extremely unfamiliar term to her.

However, according to the little girl’s teacher’s description, this constitution was extremely terrifying. It was actually able to forcefully devour the fate, life force, and cultivation of a cultivator.

Most importantly, the person that was being devoured would not notice it at all.

“It’s all Yan’er’s fault. If it wasn’t for me, Father wouldn’t have died…”

At the thought of the Demon Devourer Body, Zhao Yuyan could not help but lower her head. Her fingers gripped the corners of her clothes tightly, and her face was filled with self-blame.

Although she had not done it on purpose, her Demon Devourer Body was still to blame for the decline in her father’s fate and strength. This was something that plagued her with guilt.

“Silly girl, listen to me. This isn’t your fault. Your father’s death wasn’t because of you!”

Lin Qingping looked at Zhao Yuyan and said with a serious expression.

“Mother, you don’t have to comfort me… It’s all my fault,” Zhao Yuyan lowered her head and said.

“I used to think that you were too weak, but now… It’s time for me to tell you the truth…”

Lin Qingping looked at Zhao Yuyan and spoke quietly, but with certainty.
