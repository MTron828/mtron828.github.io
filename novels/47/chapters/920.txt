921 Wan Tu, Slain!

Looking at Ye Xuan heading toward him, full of killing intent, Wan Tu felt flustered, and his eyes darted around, looking for an opportunity to flee.

Ye Xuan followed up, “I can’t be bothered to say anything more, so I’ll repeat my words from earlier. Time is of the essence. Let’s see if I can finish you off in one move. If I don’t succeed, I’ll let you go.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan swung the Godsword, and the blood-colored crescent moon in the sky suddenly fell.

In the blink of an eye, a terrifying amount of energy caused the entire East Sea to churn, stirring up waves that were tens of thousands of feet high.

“This sword strike…”

Yanran looked at Ye Xuan in a daze, her eyes filled with admiration. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Argh…”

A shrill scream was heard, followed by a loud bang, causing the entire world to shake violently.

Ou Yunhai also saw this scene, and broke out into a cold sweat.

He finally understood that even though he had already made great progress, the distance between him and Ye Xuan had only grown.

“Hiss…”

If he was the one on the receiving end of that sword strike, would he be able to survive? He did not want to think about it.

“Ye Xuan has really become even more terrifying. I still have to stay away from him,” he muttered to himself.

All of his previous thoughts of fighting Ye Xuan and snatching Yanran away dissipated into smoke. At the same time, he felt that it was fortunate that he had not made a move on Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun earlier, otherwise, he would end up like Wan Tu.

Not daring to stick around any longer, Ou Yunhai plunged deeper into the ancient palace.

On the other side, when the endless blood aura gradually faded, there was only one figure left lying on the ground.

Upon closer inspection, Daoist Liu Feng was completely stunned. Had the person whom their Seal Divine sect had hunted down for countless years finally been killed?

At this moment, Liu Feng’s emotions surged. He knelt on the ground and kowtowed to the sky.

“Ancestors, did you see that? The demon Wan Tu has finally been killed!”

At this moment, after Liu Feng who finally saw his disciples avenged, felt as if all of the strength in his body had disappeared, and he collapsed on the ground.

Wan Tu, whom he had spent countless years trying to kill, was finally dead!

In their excitement, almost everyone in the Seal Divine sect began to regard Ye Xuan as their savior. They immediately knelt down and said loudly in unison, “Sword Immortal Ye, thank you for your help today. You helped us kill our mortal enemy, so from today onward, we are willing to heed to your orders at any time!”

Hearing their heartfelt words, Ye Xuan was stunned, and felt quite touched. These people were almost identical to the Great Wilderness Divine sect back then.

As this did not take him much effort, Ye Xuan did not expect them to be so grateful. After thinking for a moment, he said, “All of you should get up quickly. This is just a small matter to me. There’s no need to go to this extent.”

“Today, Wan Tu has been killed. I hope that all of you will cultivate well from now on. Don’t let a bloodthirsty fellow like Wan Tu appear again.”

The group of people were grateful and quickly replied, “Yes, Sword Immortal Ye. We’ll definitely cultivate well in the future. We won’t allow another mistake like Wan Tu to happen again.”

After dealing with Wan Tu, Ye Xuan redirected his attention to the chaotic battle below.

At this moment, another wave of immortal aura was released from the treasure, causing many people to become excited.

The seven sealed immortal realm experts were fighting fiercely, and there was no way to determine who was stronger at the moment.

At this moment, the treasure seemed to have sensed something and actually flew away rapidly, quickly slipping out of the range of their spiritual senses.

“Oh no! The treasure is actually trying to escape. Hurry up and chase after it!”

They abandoned their battles and immediately activated their divine powers to give chase. After seeing this situation, Yanran was also very surprised. She immediately looked at Ye Xuan and shouted, “Hurry up and chase them!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Yanran plunged into the East Sea after them. Ye Xuan did not dare to delay, and quickly activated the fiery phoenix technique and dove down.

After passing through the turbulent sea, he arrived at the ancient palace, which seemed to be in a separate space.

There was a majestic palace hanging in the sky. It was like a palace from the heavens, and was a shocking sight.

This was the first time Ye Xuan had seen such a scene, and the view made him take a deep breath in appreciation. However, there was no time to spare, and he immediately looked around, located Yanran, and gave chase.

Thanks to the fiery phoenix technique, Ye Xuan’s speed could be considered unparalleled. In an instant, he had already caught up, and he even conveniently hugged Yanran, who was pushed back by a gust of air.

“Hmph!”

After realizing that the person hugging her was Ye Xuan, Yanran relaxed, but still huffed in mock anger.

Ye Xuan looked at the shadow that was constantly fleeing in front of him and asked, “What exactly is going on here?”
