As he said those words, he plunged the Godsword through Shan Ling’s body.

Ye Xuan was extremely furious, so he channeled his emotions and rage into the Godsword, releasing waves of cold killing intent.

This shameless old monster actually dared to bully his disciples and woman. He had to die!

No one was allowed to bully those he cared about!

Killing Shan Ling would be a warning to those who had the same thoughts, and would make them think twice.

At this moment, the cold killing intent swept through Shan Ling’s body, and wreaked havoc within it. Severely injured, Shan Ling fell from the sky and into the sea.

“Heavens!”

“How can the power of a single sword move be so terrifying?”

Everyone watching from a distance marveled at what they saw.

“Heavens, is this how strong the legendary Sword Immortal Ye is? It’s really too terrifying.”

They had already turned pale and powerless from fear. Most of the people present had only heard of Ye Xuan’s strength, but had never personally witnessed it.

Not only was he bold enough to provoke an entire clan from the Heavenly Dao World, but he had the strength to back up his words as well!

He had not hesitated to cut down the high ancestor!

Even some of the old monsters hiding in the shadows were somewhat fearful at this moment. It seemed that Ye Xuan’s decisiveness, coupled with the reveal of the restored Godsword, had the deterrent effect that he was hoping for.

He was sending everyone a message.

‘Do not touch those around me!’

At this moment, Ye Xuan swung the Godsword and cut open the cage that trapped Yanran. Then, he very considerately carried her out.

Yanran was suddenly hugged by Ye Xuan. Even though she was very surprised, and her face was still red, she did not resist. She raised her head and stared into Ye Xuan’s eyes, and the corners of her mouth curled up into a sweet smile.

Ye Xuan also smiled in response, and held her tightly in his arms.

Seeing this scene, a wail was suddenly heard from the distance.

“Ahhhhh!”

Seeing the two of them showing off their affection in the sky publicly, Ou Yunhai screamed.

At this moment, Ou Yunhai’s world seemed to have darkened, making him look miserable and hopeless.

On the other side, Yanran was still staring at Ye Xuan’s eyes with deep affection. After not meeting for such a long time, her yearning for him could no longer be hidden.

She leaned over and gave him a deep kiss.

At this moment, the world seemed to have frozen. However, an extremely miserable cry suddenly rang out, “Yanran… How can I live without you!”

From today onward, there was another heartbroken cultivator in this world.

Feeling her warmth on his lips, Ye Xuan was shocked.

This little girlfriend of his is too bold. She actually did such a thing to me in broad daylight?

No, how could he allow her to seize the initiative? He had to fight back!

Thinking of this, Ye Xuan immediately took action. However, just as he was about to hug Yanran tightly and kiss her back, she instantly broke free and revealed a triumphant smile on her face.

Stunned, Ye Xuan wanted to pull her back in, but by this time she had already slipped into the distance. At this moment, Yanran’s cheeks were as red as two apples. She felt very shy.

Her heart was thumping wildly, and she was shocked by her own actions just now.

However, she had always been a straightforward person who would not hide anything. Moreover, she could not control her emotions when she saw the person she had missed for so long again.

After escaping from Ye Xuan’s embrace, Yanran went over to Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun, her heart still thumping the entire time. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, she was thinking in her heart, ‘This feeling is really too wonderful. Senior Sister, you really weren’t lying to me. Kissing the person you love feels absolutely wonderful.”

“Could this be the sweet love that Senior Sister was talking about?”

Yanran was feeling extremely happy in her heart, and she glanced affectionately at Ye Xuan in the distance. After that, she buried the joy on her face and put on a cold expression again. However, her cheeks were still tinged pink.

“Teacher’s wife, what happened to you? Why is your face so red?”

Zhuge Yueyue asked as she held back her laughter.

After hearing those words, Yanran subconsciously touched her face in embarrassment. She had really done something like that in public…

However, she still replied with a straight face, “It’s nothing. Don’t worry.”

Hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue’s face twitched a few times, as did Feng Xiyun’s.
