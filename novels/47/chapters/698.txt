699 Activating Berserk Mode Again

After Xiang Yun shouted angrily, she swung her hammer without hesitation, and lightning converged around her.

“Damn it! This matter has nothing to do with us! It’s not like we beat her up!”

Xu Changqing was furious. Sure, if they had truly injured Zhuge Yueyue, they would have nothing to say.

However, they had been framed!

!!

The feeling of becoming a scapegoat was particularly unpleasant, and they all felt helpless.

Anything they said to Xiang Yun was useless at this point, as she was already in a berserk state.

All she saw was her first sister, who usually loved and cared for her, being seriously injured by someone. How could she tolerate this?

As her anger grew, the amount of power she unleashed grew stronger as well. Before the five of them could react, lightning bolts descended from the sky and formed a lightning cage, trapping them inside. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xiang Yun hovered in the air and muttered, “Endless lightning technique”

As soon as she finished speaking, hundreds of lightning bolts instantly struck toward the five disciples, forcing them to take out their respective treasures to defend themselves.

“Damn it! This lightning is crazy powerful!”

“Everyone, if we don’t cooperate, we’ll be eliminated!”

One of them roared angrily. However, just as he finished speaking, he was struck by a lightning bolt and was briefly paralyzed. The others did not fare much better, and all of them had already suffered injuries.

Xu Changqing swung his sword at Xiang Yun, trying to interrupt her attacks.

The other four also hurriedly attacked to help him.

Sparks and explosions from the collision of their attacks rang out in the sky, and even the ground shook violently.

Xu Changqing’s attack forced Xiang Yun back half a step. However, he was also on the receiving end of Xiang Yun’s attack.

With a dull sound, Xu Changqing spat out a mouthful of blood, and it felt like several bones in his body had been broken.

“Curses! She’s so strong!”

Xu Changqing considered himself Mu Beichen’s equal. However, he was actually on the backfoot against this little girl

He took out a pill and consumed it. To win, he would do anything.

As soon as he digested the pill, his body started to exude a terrifying sword aura. As he gathered it around it, it condensed into a crescent beam in front of him.

“Omnislash!”

Xu Changqing fiercely released this crescent beam at Xiang Yun, which emitted a keening noise as it flew through the air.

This sword light had an unstoppable momentum. Wherever it passed, even space trembled and frayed at the edges.

Seeing this, Xiang Yun grasped her potato hammer tightly with both hands and flew backward. Then, she swung her hammer viciously and charged toward the crescent beam and Xu Changqing like a missile.

Boom!

A huge explosion erupted, and the powerful shockwaves swept out, kicking clouds of dust and debris everywhere.

The crescent beam had been shattered, and Xiang Yun’s hammer smashed into Xu Changqing’s body, sending him tumbling backwards.

After spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, Xu Changqing rose unsteadily to his feet. At this moment, he felt that several bones had been broken, and even moving felt painful.

“Let’s attack together!”

After seeing Xu Changqing being beaten so badly, the other four people panicked. Even an expert like Xu Changqing could not withstand one move, so their outcome would only be worse.

They had to give it their all right now, and attacked together.

When she saw the four of them rushing over recklessly, she did not cower. She gripped the potato hammer tightly and charged forward.

“Today, you all must die!”

Xiang Yun seemed to have turned into a goddess of war, and each swing of her hammer resulted in a flying body, and painful screams. Just looking at this scene made one’s heart turn cold.

“Is there a limit to her strength?”

“How can she beat up some of the strongest geniuses in the East continent like this?”

Everyone was dumbfounded, including Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun.

“My goodness, it’s really different when a mighty figure reincarnates. Her talent is boundless”

“I wonder what level that mighty figure reached before she reincarnated”

As he spoke, everyone seemed to recall the illusory figure behind Xiang Yun earlier. In the meantime, the person in question was chasing the five disciples while swinging her hammer around

“Come here and let me squish you with my hammer!”
