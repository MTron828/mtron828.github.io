However, this was not the time to back down. After all, if she retreated now, her second sister would be in danger.

Focusing herself, she tightened her grip on the Cloud Heaven Sword, her figure unwavering.

When Feng Xiyun saw her senior sister prepare to clash with Shan Hai, she was also on tenterhooks.

“First Sister, you can’t defeat this Lightning Tiger alone. Don’t worry about me anymore and leave quickly!”

She did not want her first sister to risk her life to save her, so she immediately shouted.

Zhuge Yueyue did not answer her, but simply used her actions to display her stance.

She pointed the Cloud Heaven Sword at the sky, and a door condensed in the sky. In an instant, her powerful sword intent swept out, and her gaze turned sharp.

When the door was completed, Zhuge Yueyue looked at Shan Hai with confidence as she said coldly, “Hmph! So what if you’re an ancient realm expert? I’m still gonna kill you today!”

“How dare you bully my Great Wilderness Divine sect! Today, you will pay the price in blood!”

Her fighting spirit soared, and she unleashed a powerful slash toward the blood-red divine lightning bolt that Shan Hai had just condensed again. Boom!

With a loud bang, a dazzling light erupted that blinded everyone. Even the ancient palace began to continuously tremble.

“Oh my god, her sword intent is too terrifying. How strong is Zhuge Yueyue?”

Seeing Zhuge Yueyue launch such an astonishingly powerful attack, the crowd was so shocked that they turned pale with fright.

At the same time, Shan Hai was forced to retreat by Zhuge Yueyue’s sword attack. That being said, Zhuge Yueyue’s situation was not any better.

After all, the two of them were originally separated by a major cultivation realm, so she was forced to retreat a thousand meters.

Judging from this situation, the victor of the first exchange was obviously Shan Hai. Although Zhuge Yueyue’s attack was shockingly powerful, so was Shan Hai’s. In the event where both parties’ cultivation techniques were on par with each other, the victor would be the one with the higher cultivation level.

The one advantage she did have at the moment was the Cloud Heaven Sword she wielded.

“Haha!”

Shanhai laughed out loud and said, “Is that it? You ants dared to kill my son, and while you might be able to protect your sect from me, once the elders of the clan arrive, it’ll be game over for your sect!”

Shan Hai was almost hysterical as he launched more fierce attacks, forcing Zhuge Yueyue to dodge.

Despite hearing his callous words, Zhuge Yueyue remained calm and focused.

At this moment, Shan Hai said, “Hahaha! As for Ye Xuan?”

“He only defeated the clone of the golden-furred growler ancestor. Does he really think he’s invincible because of that?”

“Do you know that the golden-furred growler ancestor is nothing but trash before our lightning tiger ancestor?”

Upon hearing this, Zhuge Yueyue instantly erupted with anger as her sword intent began to condense.

No one would be allowed to insult her teacher! No one!

“You old fart! You will definitely regret your thoughtless words!”

She raised the Cloud Heaven Sword and unleashed a slash that was imbued with her cold sword intent.

At this moment, half of the Eastern Sea seemed to have been frozen and then split open.

In fact, it seemed that the sky had been split apart as well!

A powerful destructive aura wreaked havoc in the surroundings, causing everyone to panic.

“Could this be an immortal-grade divine power?”

The crowd could not believe what they were seeing. This powerful attack was on par with an ancient realm expert’s full-power attack!

At this moment, Zhuge Yueyue was really angry, so she immediately unleashed the World Slash technique.

“Argh!”

“This… This can’t be happening!”

After feeling the powerful attack cut through his body, Shan Hai was in a state of disbelief. He did not believe that Zhuge Yueyue could actually cut him down.

He was a peak-level ancient realm expert, and was considered one of the top experts in the Xuan continent.

Shan Hai’s eyes were filled with disbelief even as he died. His gaze remained firmly locked on Zhuge Yueyue, who simply put away the Cloud Heaven Sword and left her parting words.

“A peak-level ancient realm expert is nothing special, after all.”

After hearing these words, Shan Hai spat out a mouthful of blood and died. His blood dyed the East Sea red, and his corpse sank to the bottom of the sea.

“Oh my god… How tragic1 She mocked him right before he died… but I like it!”

“This is truly too shocking. I didn’t expect her to follow in Sword Immortal Ye’s footsteps and kill an expert that was a whole major realm above hers.”

“Oh my god! Another miracle has taken place!”

“A supreme realm expert killed an ancient realm expert! This is something that can be recorded in the annals of history.”

“Is everyone from Cloud Sky peak so heaven-defying?”

Everyone discussed what they had just seen animatedly. At this moment, some people were very happy, while others were very worried.
