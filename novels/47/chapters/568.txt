569 Daoist Hei Tie’s Panic Attack (Part 2)

He knew after witnessing Ye Xuan’s strength, that none of them would be able to stand against him. In fact, if Ye Xuan wanted to, he could probably exterminate the entire Supreme Divine sect by himself.

That was why he was so flustered and wanted to leave immediately.

“Why are you in such a hurry to leave?”

“You can choose to run away now, but if you do, I will definitely attack your sect later. As for what the outcome will be, I think you’re quite aware of that,” Ye Xuan said coldly.

!!

Hearing this, Daoist Hei Tie’s forehead was covered in sweat. He was panicking, and he knew that this matter would not be so easy to resolve.

However, if he did not resolve this matter, the Supreme Divine sect would probably end up in the same state as the Immortal Divine sect.

At that moment, Daoist Hei Tie felt like chopping Han Tai into eight pieces for provoking the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

He could only pretend to be calm and ignorant, as he said, “Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, what do you mean by that? If I remember correctly, we haven’t offended the Great Wilderness Divine sect, right?”

Ye Xuan was unbothered by his acting, and simply approached him slowly with a terrifying smile on his face.

“Oh, playing the fool are we?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan unleashed his sword intent, which made the forces of the Supreme Divine sect breathless and pale.

“I’m not very patient with my enemies. Do you really want me to resort to using force?”

After hearing this, Daoist Hei Tie became even more flustered. He already understood that there was no way to skirt around the matter.

If he did not come up with a good solution, then he and the sect would be doomed.

Taking a deep breath, he said to Ye Xuan, “Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan, please don’t rush things.”

“We were indeed at fault for what happened earlier, and would like to sincerely apologize to you and your two disciples.”

“What kind of compensation does Fellow Daoist Ye Xuan seek? We’ll definitely handle this properly.”

Seeing Daoist Hei Tie comply, Ye Xuan smiled and retracted his sword intent.

“The one who attacked my disciples, I’ll give you a chance. Show yourself.”

After hearing this, Han Tai’s face turned pale. He could only look at Daoist Hei Tie with a pleading gaze.

“Senior Brother Hei Tie, please help me. Please…” Han Tai immediately begged.

Daoist Hei Tie was extremely conflicted. He could not even protect himself right now, much less someone else. It was a choice between the sect, and one elder.

Anyone would choose to exchange Han Tai for the safety of the entire Supreme Divine sect.

Seeing that Han Tai had lost all hope, Daoist Hei Tie let out a long sigh.

“Han Tai, I’m sorry. I can only blame myself for not being capable enough to protect you.”

“Whether or not our Supreme Divine sect is able to resolve this crisis will depend on you.”

Daoist Hei Tie left the matter solely on the shoulders of Han Tai.

Ye Xuan was shocked by his actions. Daoist Hei Tie was a ruthless man.

Han Tai was not a fool. How could he not understand what his senior brother meant by that? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the surface, he was leaving the matter in his hands, but in reality, if he did not resolve this matter appropriately, even if he managed to survive Ye Xuan’s wrath, there would be nothing good awaiting him at the hands of the sect.

If he took the initiative to admit it, even if he died in the end, he could at least leave a good impression. It seemed that he would not be able to escape death either way.

Han Tai looked at his senior brother and smiled bitterly.

‘Senior Brother, it seems that I’ve worked hard for you in vain.’

In the end, he would be sacrificed for the sake of the sect.

‘Hehe…’

After Han Tai ridiculed himself, he stood up without hesitation.

“It was indeed me who attacked your two disciples. If you want to do anything to me, then come at me.”

At this moment, he could no longer see any hope. Even if he really wanted to kill Ye Xuan, he would not do something as stupid as putting up a futile struggle.

He had already witnessed Ye Xuan’s strength, as well as seen his senior brother’s true colors.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan laughed.

‘Haha, this is really interesting. I’m actually lucky enough to witness a scene from a famous trope.’

Ye Xuan stared at Han Tai coldly and said, “Alright, at least you’ve got guts. I won’t take your life today.”

Hearing this, Han Tai was overjoyed. He was saved?

However, his joy was cut short. Ye Xuan’s next words made his heart go cold.

“Be honest. Which hand did you use to bully my two disciples?”

Han Tai trembled and looked down at his right hand. He already knew what Ye Xuan was going to do. It seemed that he was going to have to part with a limb.

However, it was in exchange for his life, so no matter how stupid he was, he would still make this choice…
