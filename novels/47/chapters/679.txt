680 Catching Up (Part 2) Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this moment, the atmosphere at the scene had unknowingly become heavy, like a brewing storm.

Although no one had started fighting yet, all it would take was a spark to ignite a great battle .

Ever since Zhuge Yueyue entered this space, she would glance at Xie Tianyu coldly from time to time. Every time, Xie Tianyu would glare back at her coldly.

Mu Beichen smiled when he saw this. He looked at Xie Tianyu and said, “Haha, Tianyu, if I’m not wrong, you won’t have it easy this time.”

!!

Hearing this, Xie Tianyu said indifferently, “Tsk, isn’t she just a little girl? She’s not worth taking seriously at all.”

“Is that so? In that case, I’ll be hoping for a good show,” Mu Beichen said casually.

Then, he decided to stoke the flames.

“Ahem, how should I put this? In my opinion, you really can’t beat Zhuge Yueyue.”

His words enraged Xie Tianyu, who thought that it was fine to lose to anyone but her.

“Mu Beichen, what do you mean by that?”

Mu Beichen waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing, really. I’m just airing my thoughts out loud. Besides, haven’t you been defeated by her before?”

Xie Tianyu’s face turned cold. It was a fact that he could not refute, at least not until he defeated her this time and regained his honor.

The Reincarnation Fairy remained silent as a bystander. She had already figured out that Mu Beichen was deliberately teasing Xie Tianyu.

A moment later, the door fluctuated, which caught everyone’s attention.

“First Sister!”

A voice was heard, and a figure rushed toward Zhuge Yueyue like a tiny bolt of lightning.

“Uh…”

At this moment, everyone present was dumbfounded.

“Why is it a little girl?”

Almost all the geniuses of the East continent had joined the gathering, but this little girl was only six years old at most. How did she manage to reach this point?

Even Zhuge Yueyue was very confused. She rubbed her third sister’s head and asked with a puzzled expression, “Third Sister, how did you get here so quickly? Where is Second Sister?”

After hearing this, Xiang Yun panicked. After looking around, he whispered into Zhuge Yueyue’s ear.

“First Sister, I just beat up the old man who was guarding the door. That’s why I got sent over here so quickly.”

“F*ck That works?”

Even though Xiang Yun spoke very softly, everyone heard her clearly.

“Shouldn’t the heart-questioning be a test of a person’s state of mind? How did she pass so easily just by beating the old man up?”

“Oh my god, we were so naive.”

Outside the ancient realm, a group of people who were watching the screen stared at each other. They had not been paying attention to Xiang Yun ever since she fell asleep, and had been observing the situation in the Summit Space.

This included Ye Xuan, who was also dumbfounded. How did his third disciple make it there?

The more he thought about it, the more confused he became. Fortunately, the screen had quite a useful function, and recorded everything that went on in the ancient realm.

Therefore, Daoist Canghai immediately injected a stream of spiritual power into the screen to retrieve the scene of what had transpired before Xiang Yun reached the Summit Space.

After a while, the screen switched to a scene 30 minutes ago.

At this moment, after Zhuge Yueyue passed the heart-questioning stage, there were still remaining people at this stage, who were furtively discussing what had happened.

“Heavens! Ye Xuan’s eldest disciple is too strong.”

“Did you notice? Zhuge Yueyue’s potential score is now more than 79,000!”

“If she hadn’t waited for others to act first, she might even be ranked first.”

“That door leads to the Summit Space. I wonder if there are enough people to activate the space inside yet.”

At this moment, a little girl suddenly appeared in this space, and everyone fell silent.

“Which sect is this little girl from? Why is she here?”

Everyone was puzzled as Xiang Yun began to observe her surroundings.

Where had Second Sister gone?

No matter where she looked, she could not find Feng Xiyun.

“What happened? This little girl is at most six years old. Why is she even here?”

Some people were very puzzled. After all, those who could reach this stage were all geniuses to some extent. However, this girl had not even started her journey on the path of spiritual cultivation. How did she get here?

After a while, a disciple finally couldn’t help but rub Xiang Yun’s little head and ask, “Little friend, which sect are you from? Why did you come to this place?”

Seeing this scene, a certain disciple immediately broke out in a cold sweat, and his legs could not help but tremble.

“F*ck, what is he doing? Does he want to step on the tigress’ tail?”

This disciple’s face was already pale and powerless. After all, he had been one of the lucky few who escaped Xiang Yun’s massacre earlier.

Now, a deep sense of fear assaulted him whenever he looked at her.
