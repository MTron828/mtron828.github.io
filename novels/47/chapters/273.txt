Chapter 274: Teasing The Tsundere Empress

Originally, this mystic realm was hidden deep within the spatial turbulence, and no one could discover it at all.

It was only when the entrance of the mystic realm was connected to the Demon Zone that countless demonic beasts entered.

Under the influence of the slaughter intent, those demonic beasts with terrifying strength immediately turned into mindless killing machines.

Honestly, had it not been for those titan apes tearing space apart, Ye Xuan would not have discovered the traces of this mystic realm.

By sheer coincidence, the golden demonic ape discovered the Datura flower at the same time as Ye Xuan, and began to fight him for it.

Their battle caused countless spatial cracks to rip open around them. With the precious Datura flower as the prize, neither man nor demonic beast took a single step back.

Other than being able to increase a cultivator’s comprehension value and provide an epiphany opportunity, the Datura flower also had two other effects that countless cultivators would go crazy for.

As long as one refined the flower, it would make it much easier for the cultivator to comprehend slaughter intent and reincarnation intent.

Its value was no less than the heart of heavenly lightning.

Reincarnation intent was one of the legendary supreme intents, and even ranked above heavenly lightning intent.

It was said that if the experts from the ancient times wanted to reincarnate, they had to have comprehended reincarnation intent.

Other than that, if an reincarnated ancient expert wanted to awaken all of the memories of their past life, their reincarnation intent had to have reached a certain level.

Neither Ye Xuan nor the golden demonic ape would let go of such a precious treasure.

The golden demonic ape had five mysterious patterns engraved on its body, which were derived from gold, fist, sound, wave and vibration intents.

Compared to the black giant, it was undoubtedly much stronger.

It was also able to fuse three intents, which meant that Ye Xuan had to use the Tower of Heaven to defend himself.

“Suppress!”

After a long battle without making any headway, Ye Xuan suddenly became impatient.

This guy’s physical strength was too terrifying. Even his perfect-level sword intent was unable to harm it.

“Detestable human! I’m going to tear you apart!”

The golden demonic ape pounded its chest and let out a deafening roar.

Its pupils were filled with unwillingness, and its right fist glowed with a bright golden light seemed to eclipse everything.

However, at this moment, the Tower of Heaven released monstrous spiritual pressure and forcefully suppressed the golden demonic ape and stored it in its internal space.

Buzzzzzz!

At this moment, a ray of light flashed across the sky!

Seeing this, Ye Xuan could not help but smile. It was just the right time.

Moments later, Ye Xuan teleported and, as Shangguan Wan’er watched, grabbed the Datura flower.

“What? It’s actually the Datura flower?”

Seeing this, Shangguan Wan’er’s eyes widened as she stared at the strange red flower in Ye Xuan’s hand.

The Datura flower was a perfect match for the blood-red saber she had just obtained.

Moreover, if she could refine the Datura flower, she would definitely be able to comprehend perfect-level sword intent using the epiphany opportunity provided when she consumed it!

Why was this guy’s luck so good?

Why was he able to find such rare treasures one after another?

She looked at Ye Xuan with shock in her eyes.

“Are you very tempted? Do you want it?”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er, and the corners of his mouth curled up.

She was tempted!

How could she not be?

However, her pride would never allow her to acknowledge Ye Xuan as her teacher.

She was the master of Luo Heaven Palace and the reincarnation of an ancient great empress. how could she become someone else’s disciple?

“As long as you acknowledge me as your teacher, not only will I give you the Tower of Heaven, but this heart of heavenly lightning and the Datura flower as well!”

“I’ve never been stingy toward my disciples!”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan’er with a smile on his lips.

Ye Xuan suddenly had a funny thought. Compared to whether he could take Shangguan Wan’er as his disciple, he was more interested in seeing the conflicted expression on her face.

This guy was really bad. He clearly knew that she really wanted it, but still deliberately said such things.

The Tower of Heaven, the heart of heavenly lightning, and the Datura flower…

Which one of them was not a priceless rare heavenly treasure?

‘If this guy really did as he said, then it might be worth it.’

‘No, no, no!’

‘Shangguan Wan’er, Shangguan Wan’ er!’

‘As the reincarnation of an ancient great empress, you must not fall for his tricks!’

‘He’s lying for sure. No one is that generous!’

Shangguan Wan’er pulled a long face and returned to her cold and aloof self.

“Do you really think I’m an idiot who will believe your lies?”

“Don’t mention this thing again, or I will never forgive you!”

However, Shangguan Wan’er’s gaze still involuntarily fell on the Datura flower in Ye Xuan’s hand.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan smiled.

Just now, he had used the power of karma, and found that the karmic lines between him and Shangguan Wan’er had become thicker.

‘My proud little empress, you will become my disciple sooner or later!’

Of course, now was not the best time to take in a disciple, and Shangguan Wan’er was still wary.

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan looked at Shangguan Wan ‘er with a mocking gaze.

Shangguan Wan’er was silent, turning her head away from Ye Xuan.

“My future precious disciple, Teacher has something to do and will take his leave first!”

Ye Xuan took a step forward, and his figure suddenly disappeared, but his voice still echoed in the surroundings.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
