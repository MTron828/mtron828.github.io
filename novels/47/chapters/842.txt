843 Reunification

Roar!

Accompanied by a tragic roar, the life of the golden-furred growler ancestor ended.

With a loud bang, his huge body fell to the ground, never to rise again.

Elsewhere, in a certain space, an abnormally huge ferocious beast instantly woke up.

He stared fiercely in one direction and then roared loudly, “Damned b*stard! How dare you kill my clone and destroy my cultivation!”

“I swear that I will tear you into pieces!”

Hearing this loud roar, the nearby creatures turned pale with fright and hurriedly fled.

The matter came to an end with the death of the golden-furred growler ancestor, but Ye Xuan was not very happy. Instead, he raised his head to look at the sky above him, frowning.

He could clearly sense that there was a huge creature staring at him fiercely somewhere up there, and understood that this was just the beginning.

After this battle, perhaps the golden-furred growler ancestor would not rashly attack. However, he might order his subordinates to attack.

This grudge would definitely not be resolved so easily.

“Sigh… In that case, I have to make some preparations first.”

Thinking this, Ye Xuan began to plan. He had to make sure that all loose ends were tied up to prevent any accidents from happening.

Yanran had just told him that there was an even larger world outside of their world. Moreover, there was also a Great Wilderness Divine sect in that place.

This sect was established by countless immortals of the Great Wilderness Divine sect since ancient times, and its status was not low..

Although these people might be able to protect him, he could not rely on others for everything. In the end, one’s strength belonged to one’s own self.

As they watched the huge corpse gradually turn into a streak of light and dissipate, everyone finally came back to their senses and realized that Ye Xuan had emerged victorious.

“Oh my god, I didn’t expect Ye Xuan to really win!”

“He actually defeated a true immortal!”

Ye Xuan’s fame once again spread throughout the world, and his feats were discussed by the people in the eight continents.

Including Yanran, the Great Wilderness Divine sect now had two sealed immortal realm experts. This made Old Master Sun even more eager to merge the two sect branches, as it meant that the Great Wilderness Divine sect would be able to quickly develop and also improve their weaknesses in terms of incomplete cultivation techniques and divine powers.

What he did not know was that Ao Lei was thinking the same thing.

At this moment, the atmosphere was filled with enthusiastic cheers. They all shouted Ye Xuan’s name in unison. Killing a true immortal from the outside world was an unprecedented miracle, and gave the cultivators of this world hope and self-belief.

Perhaps one day they too would be able to walk in Ye Xuan’s footsteps.

“Sword Immortal Ye! Sword Immortal Ye…”

Hearing these intense cheers, Ye Xuan was also very happy. It seemed that his status had taken another leap forward today.

Boom!

At this moment, a huge explosion was heard, and then the world vibrated intensely.

The other six continents had finally collided with the Xuan and East continents. Now, the eight continents had once again been unified.

After the eight continents merged together into a single land mass, bursts of golden light suddenly fell from the sky.

“What happened?”

When they saw the golden light, everyone was stunned, including Ye Xuan.

What was going on this time? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Although they knew that the eight continents would be unified sooner or later, the appearance of the golden light was really confusing.

“Senior Brother Ao, could it be that something unexpected has happened again?” Gao Shun could not help but ask.

However, Ao Lei also had no clue as to what was going on at the moment, and turned to look in Ye Xuan’s direction to see if the latter had any insights into the matter.
