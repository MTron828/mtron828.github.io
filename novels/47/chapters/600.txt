601 Little Potato (Part 2)

Compared to Zhuge Yueyue’s own experience, this little girl was really too miserable. She even thought that the most delicious food was potatoes.

If she was in her shoes, she would definitely not be able to live so carefreely.

It was because of this that Zhuge Yueyue really wanted to bring her back with them to Cloud Sky peak.

At this moment, Ye Xuan also put down the little girl and asked, “Little girl, where did you find food after that old man fell asleep?”

!!

When she heard this, the little girl looked around vigilantly and said in a soft voice, “Didn’t you guys notice that group of children running past us?”

“Those children would beg in the village every day in exchange for food.”

“But why would I do such a thing? I would much rather snatch food.”

“As long as I give these little wimps a good beating, they will obediently give me food.”

After saying this, the little girl even clenched her pink fist and raised it up, as if trying to show Ye Xuan how powerful she was.

After hearing this, Ye Xuan was dumbfounded.

Despite her young age, this little girl had learned the survival skills necessary for living in this village.

She had already become the overlord of this group of children, and no one dared to provoke her.

However, he did not quite understand how she possessed such great power at such a young age.

Based on what she told them, her parents were probably just ordinary people, so it was unlikely that this strength was hereditary.

Another possibility was that she was a reincarnation of an expert, which was slightly more likely.

Ye Xuan thought to himself for a while, and then smiled and asked, “Little girl, do you want to come back with me and learn how to cultivate and use spiritual power?”

After hearing this, the little girl was stunned and asked, “What is spiritual power?”

Ye Xuan smiled, then snapped his fingers at the wall in front of him.

With a loud bang, the wall collapsed.

After that, Ye Xuan said, “That’s what spiritual power can do. Do you want to learn?”

The little girl’s mouth was wide open in shock.

Then, mimicking Ye Xuan’s actions, she tried it out, but nothing of the sort happened.

This was the first time she had seen such a powerful move. Even the berserk beasts she had encountered back then would probably be easily killed by this move.

If she could master this move, from now on, no matter where the children were, they would have to run away whenever they saw her.

At this moment, the little girl’s heart was already filled with excitement. She recalled the words the old man had said to her. If she wanted to get good food, she had to first defeat her peers!

“I want to learn. I want to go back with you to learn how to cultivate!”

After saying this, the little girl was already dancing with joy.

Ye Xuan also smiled proudly. This little girl’s mind was really too simple and straightforward. All it took was a simple display of power.

However, if one thought about it carefully, one would realize that most children were filled with curiosity towards the unknown. This little girl was probably the same.

“Sure. However, if you really want to learn how to cultivate, you have to call me your teacher. Only then will I teach you,” Ye Xuan smiled and said softly.

Hearing this, the little girl was dumbfounded. She asked, “What is a teacher?”

Ye Xuan felt a little helpless at this time, but he still patiently explained to her what a teacher was. However, after she figured it out, the little girl was unhappy and looked at Ye Xuan with disdain.

“If that’s the case, then I’d rather not learn how to cultivate.”

Her words dumbfounded Zhuge Yueyue and Feng Xiyun.

“What’s the reason for this?”

Zhuge Yueyue quickly asked. After all, there were many people who wanted to be Ye Xuan’s disciple, yet this little girl did not want to.

Besides, as long as she became Ye Xuan’s disciple, would she ever have to be afraid of not being able to eat good food?

What was going on in this little girl’s head?

Moments later, the little potato tugged on Zhuge Yueyue’s hand and motioned for her to move her ear closer. Then, she said in a soft voice, “Sister, I think this brother is a little silly. If I acknowledge him as my teacher, what can I learn?”

“Sister, why don’t you stop learning under him and change teachers?”

Ye Xuan had actually heard her quiet words clearly, and his face darkened.

Even though she was a child, was it not a little inappropriate to call someone silly in front of others?

Ye Xuan was amused. He really did not expect to meet someone like this little girl in this village.

Countless people wanted to be his disciple, but she did not even bat an eyelid, and even called him silly. It was really heartbreaking.

“Pfft!”

Feng Xiyun could not help but laugh out loud. She rubbed her face and said in a serious tone, “Little potato, let me tell you. My teacher is amazing.”

“If you become his disciple, and he teaches you how to cultivate, it will make you much stronger. From then on, no one from the same generation will be able to beat you.”

“Just watch and take a good look.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she stretched out her hand, and a ray of light radiated from her hand, which shattered another wall.

“Heavens! Sister, you’re so strong!”

The little potato was stunned. Such power had completely changed her outlook on life. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She was dancing with joy and asked with an excited face, “Sister, are you sure you’re not lying to me?”

“As long as I become his disciple, I’ll be able to defeat all my peers?”

This was what made her most excited.
