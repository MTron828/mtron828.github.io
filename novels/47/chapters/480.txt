481 Lucky Sister

“What does Senior mean by that?”

Hearing this, Bei Moyan’s face turned ashen.

This was a marriage alliance between two empires. What did it have to do with Ye Xuan?

Ye Xuan glanced at the latter indifferently.

!!

“The person your second prince is trying to marry is my disciple, and I don’t agree to this marriage! Do you have any objections?”

“What?”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone’s eyes lit up.

Even Feng Wenyue was stunned. This powerful expert was actually her sister’s teacher?

Bei Xuantian’s expression turned extremely ugly, and so did Bei Moyan’s.

Bei Xuantian glared at Feng Wenyue angrily.

Since Feng Xiyun had already successfully acknowledged a master and become a disciple of a top holy land, why did the Yangli divine empire not inform him in advance?

Now, as the representatives of the Haihan divine empire, they had come to the territory of the Yangli divine empire with great fanfare in order to secure the marriage alliance between the two empires. However, it turned out that the marriage partner had already become the disciple of a top holy land. Were they toying with him?

A top holy land was far stronger than both their empires combined. Who the f*ck would dare to go up and try to snatch the bride?

Hearing this, although Feng Wenyue was very surprised, the corners of his mouth unconsciously curved up into a smile.

“This sister of mine is quite smart… She’s found herself a powerful backer!”

From Ye Xuan’s tone just now, he could tell that Ye Xuan treasured Feng Xiyun very much. Otherwise, he would not have bothered dealing with the matter regarding her marriage.

Ever since he found out that there was to be a marriage alliance between the two empires, he had been extremely worried. After he had secretly allowed Feng Xiyun to escape, he had often sent people to inquire about how she was faring.

Things were still fine until a while ago. He had constantly received updates on where she was and how she was doing.

However, for some unknown reason, his subordinates failed to locate her a month ago, which made him extremely worried.

Now knowing that she had become Ye Xuan’s disciple, he was relieved.

Ye Xuan looked at Bei Xuantian indifferently and said, “If you have nothing else to say, then it will be decided as such. The marriage is off!”

“Of course… You can also try to snatch her. I will welcome you at any time!”

“How may I address you, Sir?” Bei Moyan thought for a moment and asked.

Ye Xuan turned around and said without looking back, “I’m Ye Xuan, the chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s Cloud Sky peak!”

“What? He’s actually a chief from the Great Wilderness Divine sect…”

Feng Wenyue’s expression turned serious when he heard this.

Bei Moyan’s eyes flashed with realization.

“This person… This person is actually a chief of the Great Wilderness Divine sect…”

“And he’s a peak-level mystic lord realm expert…”

Bei Xuantian was dumbfounded.

“Uncle Moyan, is the Great Wilderness Divine sect very powerful? Why are you so afraid?”

He lived in the royal palace all year round, so he was not very familiar with the outside world.

Hearing this, Bei Moyan took a deep breath and explained, “That’s right! The Great Wilderness Divine sect is extremely terrifying. It has been in existence since ancient times and doesn’t belong to any divine empire.”

“A thousand years ago, the Great Wilderness Divine sect had an invincible expert, who was the last chief of Cloud Sky peak, Tian Xuan.”

“Chief Tian Xuan’s strength was unrivaled. He forced back the invasion of ancient beast descendants with pure strength. His attainments in the Sword Dao had reached a shocking level!”

“Much like this current period, the heaven devouring divine sparrow wreaked havoc back then. However, it was Chief Tian Xuan that defeated it and banished it to the archaic divine mountains.”

When he thought of Chief Tian Xuan, Bei Moyan revealed an expression of respect and admiration. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Back then, Chief Tian Xuan could be said to have led the human race to defeat the other races with his invincible sword.

He had thought that the Great Wilderness Divine sect’s strength would decline after the death of the Chief Tian Xuan. However, it seemed that the new chief of Cloud Sky peak had reached the peak of the mystic lord realm.

What shocked Bei Moyan the most was that Ye Xuan’s aura was unstable, which was a tell-tale sign that he was about to reach the supreme realm..

When he thought of this, Bei Moyan’s heart was filled with disbelief.

Was the Great Wilderness Divine sect really so lucky? Was there going to be a second supreme realm expert after Chief Tian Xuan?

After hearing Bei Moyan’s reply, Bei Xuantian’s face was filled with despair.

He knew in his heart that when Ye Xuan said those words, the marriage had truly been called off.

In the face of such a terrifying expert, even his father would not dare to show any disrespect, let alone him.

Even if the Haihan divine empire had many top holy lands backing them up, they would never offend the Great Wilderness Divine sect over such a small matter.

In the mystic world, strength reigned supreme.

“Uncle Feng, have you ever heard of this person?”

At this moment, Feng Wenyue whispered the question to Feng Tiangang.

“En!” Feng Tiangang nodded with a serious expression on his face.

“I’ve indeed heard of him. Chief Ye Xuan of Cloud Sky peak is the most famous expert in recent times. He almost killed three elders from the Immortal Divine sect in Qingyang City!”

“It’s a blessing that your sister managed to become his disciple.”

“Perhaps we can even use the princess’s relationship to pull the relationship between the empire and the Great Wilderness Divine sect closer. In comparison, the marriage alliance with the Haihan divine empire is insignificant.”

When Feng Wenyue heard this, he was surprised. His sister had pulled a rabbit out of the hat with this move.

...

“Mm, got it. I will definitely discuss this with Father when I return.”

“Father has always been able to accurately judge the situation. He will definitely make the right choice.”

Bei Xuantian and Bei Moyan were a little embarrassed.

“Uncle Moyan, what should we do?” Bei Xuantian was at a loss.

If Bei Mo Yan had not offset part of Ye Xuan’s spiritual pressure, he would have knelt down long ago.
