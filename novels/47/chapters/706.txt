707 Crystal (Part 3)

That person from Godwind Academy had already slipped away.

“Hmph! He was lucky he made the right choice to run away.”

After saying this, Xiang Yun found a flat spot to sit down, and it looked like she was in a state of extreme focus.

Seeing this, everyone became even more excited.

“Could it be that this little girl can really break through her limit and obtain the crystal?”

Some people could not help but give voice to their thoughts, and the atmosphere was stirred up again. Those from the Great Wilderness Divine sect were all staring unblinkingly at Xiang Yun.

Could she create a miracle?

Gao Shun could be seen muttering, “Damn it why am I so flustered? If she can really do it, our Great Wilderness Divine sect will definitely be famous.”

Overhearing this, Li Dahai chimed in, “That’s right. This little girl is too talented. Maybe she can really do something that even Chief Tian Xuan failed to do.”

“She has taken action,” Yuelun said softly, and everyone immediately looked at Xiang Yun.

After making some slight adjustments, Xiang Yun suddenly emitted an even stronger aura as she got up and walked over to the crystal empty-handed.

She stretched out her hands again and held the crystal tightly.

Moments later, her hand suddenly emitted red light, and divine runes appeared on her arm.

“This”

The onlookers were extremely surprised by this, and were unsure what to make of the runes. Perhaps only Ye Xuan knew that those runes were a result of the immortal-grade body refining technique she cultivated.

“Rise!”

After an angry roar, the golden throne started to shake and tremble.

She continued to mobilize her strength, but the crystal refused to budge. Then, just as Xiang Yun was pulling every last inch of strength out of her body, she heard a dull sound from within her body, and she suddenly shook.

After sensing what had happened, Ye Xuan muttered, “Damn! She actually did it!”

The other experts also noticed that something had changed and began to ponder the situation.

“This little girl actually broke through her limit so easily. Even though she only broke through the limits of the void realm, this is already considered unprecedented.”

“How surprising!”

Daoist Canghai and Daoist Xu Yun exchanged glances, but did not say anything. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Boom!

A golden light shot up into the sky, and Xiang Yun, who had used too much strength, suddenly fell back.

“Whoa! She did it!”

At this moment, everyone’s gazes were tracking the movement of the golden crystal in the sky with expressions of disbelief on their faces.

Then, after Xiang Yun stood up and saw the golden crystal in the sky, she immediately shouted, “Trying to escape? There’s no way I’ll let you get away!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Xiang Yun leaped into the sky and grabbed the crystal tightly.

It was as if the crystal had its own consciousness and was struggling to break free. Sensing this, she clenched her small fist and smashed the crystal twice, which made it stop.

“She’s unbelievable!”

“This is a historic moment in the East Continent”

“I can’t believe what I’m seeing”

Everyone looked on in shock at the golden crystal in her hand. Then, they turned to look at the forces of the Great Wilderness Divine sect
