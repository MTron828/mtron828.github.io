770 Mysterious Expert

Just as everyone thought that Ye Xuan’s consciousness would be devoured, a green light was released from within the thick black fog.

No matter how the black fog continued to assault the green light, it could not penetrate it. Moments later, the green light transformed into a blooming lotus, releasing waves of life force.

“Huh?”

After seeing this, the strange monster realized that something was wrong and panicked. Then, Ye Xuan emerged from the black fog unharmed.

The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he said calmly, “That’s it? Your strange power doesn’t seem to be that strong.”

“I can tell that you are very shocked. Is it because the strange power you’re so confident in has no effect on me at all?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Xuan smiled mockingly as he looked at the strange monster in the sky.

“This can’t be happening! Why didn’t the strange power affect you at all?”

The strange monster now had a vigilant look as it stared at Ye Xuan incredulously.

Even he himself could not believe what had just happened. The strange power was capable of corroding the consciousness of all living beings. Why was this human an exception?

The reason why Ye Xuan was not affected by the strange power was due to the effects of the immortal heavenly treasure, which provided him resistance against all evil powers. The strange power was naturally an evil power.

“Anything and everything is possible with me. The strange power you believe in is useless against me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan condensed another huge green lotus flower, causing the sky to tremble.

At this moment, everyone looked at the green lotus in the sky in unison, their jaws dropping in shock.

“Isn’t this power too magical?”

“It almost seems like this power is able to purify everything…”

The crowd muttered among themselves. At this moment, the green lotus in the sky once again released dazzling light, instantly driving away the black fog.

Hovering above the green lotus, Ye Xuan looked like a celestial being, sacred and inviolable. Everyone’s gaze toward him was filled with reverence and faith, believing that he would lead them through this disaster.

The strange monster was completely flustered. It looked at the green lotus floating in the sky and waited solemnly. This human was not to be trifled with!

“Impossible!”

“This can’t be true. This abandoned continent doesn’t even have the power of laws. How can such a powerful expert appear here?”

It still did not believe what it was seeing. The East continent was supposed to be a playground for it and the others, but now an existence that they could not resist had appeared. Being challenged like this made it furious, and its expression became more and more terrifying.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was still calmly looking at the monster, trying to get more information from this strange monster.

Ye Xuan did not know much about that strange realm where these monsters had originated, so he was very interested. This was the first monster he had encountered from that place, so he wanted to understand the cultivation system of these monsters.

Thinking this, he said unhurriedly, “From your expression, you look quite afraid. Is that normal for monsters like you?”

“Are you afraid of death?”

As soon as it heard that, the strange monster immediately hid the fear in the depths of its heart and said arrogantly, “Haha, what a joke!”

“I have the greatest bloodline in this world. How dare you mortals underestimate me?”

“No matter what kind of creature it is, only by believing in the master of our race can it obtain immortality.”

“Humans are still humans. I’m afraid that even with your current combat strength, you can’t hide the fact that you’re a low-level creature.”

After hearing these words, Ye Xuan frowned. These haughty words indicated that there was actually someone stronger than this strange monster, and that monster or person was leading this race of strange monsters.

Had this leader come to the East continent as well?

“Based on your words, the master you’re talking about seems to be very powerful, am I right?”

Ye Xuan was not in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he continued to pose questions.

“Haha!”

The strange monster suddenly laughed impudently and raised its head high as it replied, “My master’s strength is beyond your imagination!”

“In our world, no matter who hears my master’s name, they will be scared out of their wits!

If you dare to call my master by his name, you will be destroyed by the power of karma and instantly turn into ashes.”

“When the world was born, my master had already appeared and experienced countless calamities.”

“In this turbulent era, although he is still supporting the ancient ruins with part of his strength, he is still an invincible existence.”

“Oh?”

Ye Xuan was momentarily stunned. This guy sounded quite fantastical.

However, Ye Xuan did not want to delve into this mysterious person’s origins. He only wanted to know if the master of that strange world had already arrived in the East continent.

Moreover, what was his combat strength like? Was it an existence that he could match?
