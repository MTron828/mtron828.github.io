479 The Crown Prince Is Here? So What?

Ye Xuan squinted his eyes and looked deeply at the young man.

The man’s body was filled with fate energy that was tied to the fate of the Yangli divine empire.

From this, the identity of the other party was easy to determine.

“The crown prince of the Yangli divine empire, eh? Things are starting to get interesting.”

!!

Ye Xuan’s lips curled into a smile, but he had no intention of going down.

He was rather curious as to how Su Changhe would handle the situation.

Seeing the appearance of the crown prince of the Yangli divine empire, Bei Xuantian and Bei Moyan’s eyes both lit up. It seemed like there was a possibility of resolving this awkward situation now.

Ye Xuan could target them, but he could not possibly target the Crown Prince of the Yangli divine empire, right?

Furthermore, with the appearance of the crown prince, as a cultivator of the Yangli divine empire, should this fellow not at least show some sort of reaction?

However, to Bei Moyan’s disappointment, Ye Xuan still did not say anything. He was still as calm as ever.

When Su Changhe saw the crown prince of the Yangli divine empire, Feng Wenyue, appear, he immediately became nervous.

“Oh my god, why did the crown prince come here personally? Don’t tell me that these people know each other?”

Su Changhe quickly glanced at Ye Xuan. When he saw the latter’s calm expression, he sighed in relief.

Fortunately, the big boss was by his side. Otherwise, he would have peed his pants on the spot.

‘Hehe! I didn’t think that I would one day be able to act cool in front of the crown prince. This is really exciting!’

The moment Feng Wenyue stepped off the carriage, he felt that the atmosphere was not quite right. He hurriedly raised her head and looked at the peak of the mountain.

“Who is that person? I can’t sense his cultivation level!”

At this moment, the expert behind Feng Wenyue hurriedly warned him with a serious expression, “Your Highness, that expert is extremely strong. I’m no match for him.”

“The East continent is in turmoil now, so all of the experts from the top holy lands have appeared. Maybe this expert is one of them!”

Feng Wenyue nodded.

Even though he was the crown prince of the Yangli divine empire, his status only reigned supreme in the secular world.

Compared to those top holy lands that had been in existence for countless years, the Yangli divine empire was merely a small force that had only been around for a few thousand years.

If the top holy lands wanted to, they could change the ruling empire at any time.

As the crown prince, Feng Wenyue was naturally very clear about this.

It was also because of this that he was not as arrogant as the other disciples of the major families. On the contrary, he was very humble.

Looking at Bei Moyan, Feng Wenyue said very politely, “Greetings, Prince Moyan! It’s been a long time!”

“I received a report from a scout earlier that informed me that the two of you have entered the empire’s territory. My father instructed me to come over to welcome you both.”

“However, it seems that you’ve encountered some trouble?”

At that moment, Feng Wenyue glanced at Su Changhe in the distance. He had put two and two together.

“Ah, we have troubled Your Highness. We did not run into any trouble, but after we had arrived here, we accidentally offended this young master.”

“Since Your Highness is here, I hope that Your Highness can put in a few good words for us and see if this young master can forgive us for our rashness just now,” Bei Moyan said humbly.

Those who were not in the know would think that Su Changhe had been the one who had bullied them.

Su Changhe’s mouth twitched when he heard this.

The older the ginger, the spicier it was. The ability of the wicked to seize the advantage was really unparalleled.

Were it not for Chief Ye Xuan, he would have died under Bei Xuantian’s saber.

Hehe!

These people were really hypocritical. They were the ones who had initiated the conflict, but now they were playing the role of victims.

Feng Wenyue raised her head and looked at Su Changhe.

He was certain that he had no impression of Su Changhe at all.

Even so, he asked very politely, “May I know your name, Fellow Daoist? Which holy land do you hail from?”

Su Changhe quickly coughed and imitated Ye Xuan’s calm expression.

“Qingyang! Su Changhe!”

“Qingyang? Su Changhe?”

Hearing this, Feng Wenyue’s eyes froze. He seemed to recall that this person was the hedonistic son of the Su family of Qingyang City.

Since that was the case, this matter would be easy to handle.

If Su Changhe really came from some powerful holy land, this matter would have been much more difficult to deal with.

However, it was just a member of a major family. There was no way they would disregard his words, right?

“So it’s Young Master Su. I’ve heard so much about you!”

“My two friends may have been in the wrong just now and accidentally offended Young Master Su. I hope that Young Master Su can forgive their mistakes for my sake,” Feng Wenyue said very politely.

It had always been his style to use peaceful means before resorting to force. After all, if things could be resolved verbally, there would be no reason to use force. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even the crown prince had come out to plead on their behalf, so Su Changhe was stuck in a difficult position.

After all, he was also a member of a major family in the Yangli divine empire. However, if he were to acquiesce, would that not be letting those two off?

Hmm…

Actually, if he ignored the crown prince’s words, he would be able to brag about this for a year.

...

He made his decision.

“Sure, I can forgive them. All they need to do is kneel down and admit their mistakes!”

“What? You…” Bei Xuantian was enraged.

“I’m the second prince of the Haihan divine empire. What right do you have to ask me to kneel?”

Since he was young, he had never knelt to anyone other than his father.

“Since that’s the case, then there’s nothing more that can be said,” Su Changhe said without any hesitation.

Even if the crown prince was here, as long as Ye Xuan backed him up, what was there to be afraid of?

“Please don’t get angry. There’s no reason to go so far.”

Hearing this, Feng Wenyue hurriedly stopped him with a gentle tone.

However, he was also a little displeased. A mere hedonistic son of Qingyang City had disregarded his words?
