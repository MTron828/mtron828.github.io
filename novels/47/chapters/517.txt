518 Giving Her A Treasure

The chiliad gold vine could be considered a rare heavenly treasure. Not only did it possess extremely dense life force, but it could also extend one’s lifespan and increase one’s cultivation speed.

Even though its effects were not as heaven-defying as the elixir of life, the chiliad gold vine was still a heaven-defying treasure.

When Yuelun saw that Ye Xuan was focused on the chiliad gold vine seedling, she knew that Ye Xuan was very confident.

Given Ye Xuan’s supreme realm cultivation, the dark spider would not be a hindrance.

!!

After sensing Ye Xuan’s ill intentions, the dark spider instantly bared its fangs and brandished its claws, letting out a series of hissing sounds.

It had taken a fancy to this chiliad gold vine seedling, and had spent a long time waiting for it to mature so that it could consume it.

However, it did not expect someone to come and try to steal it out of the blue. How could it allow such a thing to happen?

A fierce battle was bound to ensue.

“Junior Brother Ye, you must be careful. Dark spiders are extremely poisonous. If you’re not careful, you might fall into its trap.”

“It also moves very quickly, and its web can restrict your movements. Don’t be careless.”

After hearing Yuelun’s words, Ye Xuan smiled and replied, “Don’t worry. The dark spider won’t be able to cause me any trouble.”

Ye Xuan’s confidence in himself had never been higher.

His eyes were fixed on the chiliad gold vine seedling below the dark spider, and he instantly took action.

After seeing Ye Xuan launch his attack, the dark spider quickly responded with its own attack, shooting out sticky threads, trying to limit Ye Xuan’s movements.

To its surprise, Ye Xuan merely waved his palm gently and intercepted the spider threads, slicing them to shreds.

Even though he was limiting his strength to the peak of the mystic lord realm while inside the ancient tomb, it was more than enough to defeat this dark spider.

After dealing with the dark spider’s threads, Ye Xuan suddenly floated in the air. Using his hand as a sword, he released a terrifying sword beam at the dark spider.

Puchi!

A dull sound rang out, and the dark spider cried out in pain. It now knew how terrifying Ye Xuan was, and understood that it could not defeat him.

It spat out dense white threads to slow Ye Xuan down.

Seeing that Ye Xuan was busy dealing with these white threads, the dark spider immediately seized the opportunity and quickly escaped through the other side of the cave.

Ye Xuan did not pursue it and allowed it to escape.

In any case, he only wanted to obtain this chiliad gold vine seedling. Letting it escape would save him the trouble of dealing with it.

After it left, Ye Xuan smiled brightly. He sliced and cleaned up the spider webs in the cave, then walked over to the chiliad gold vine’s seedline and wrapped his spiritual power around it. Then, he carefully put it into his storage space.

“Congratulations on obtaining this precious chiliad gold vine, Junior Brother Ye,” said Yuelun with a smile.

Even though she also fancied this chiliad gold vine seedling, Ye Xuan was the one who had worked for it. In any case, the dark spider was stronger than she was. If Ye Xuan had not been here, she would have been in danger.

Ye Xuan simply smiled knowingly.

Shortly after, he turned to look at Yuelun with a smile and said, “Senior Sister Yuelun, this chiliad gold vine seedling isn’t of much use to me, so I think it’s better to give it to you.”

“Ah?”

Yuelun was so shocked that she was rooted to the ground. She could not believe what she had just heard.

Did Ye Xuan really not want such a precious heavenly treasure?

Why was he giving it to her?

Yuelun’s mind had already started to run wild.

In her opinion, Ye Xuan’s generosity only extended to his two disciples, so this was completely unexpected.

However, this chiliad gold vine seedling was too precious, so how could she accept it?

After all, she was not Ye Xuan’s disciple. At most, they were from the same sect. She really did not have the fortune to enjoy this chiliad gold vine.

Thinking this, she waved her hand and replied, “Junior Brother Ye, this chiliad gold vine seedling is really too precious. How could I bear to accept it? You should keep it for yourself.”

Surprisingly, after hearing Yuelun refuse, Ye Xuan said with a straight face, “Senior Sister Yuelun, we’re both from the same sect, and you’re my senior sister. Why are you being so distant?”

“Could it be that in your heart, the relationship between us is only an ordinary one?”

After noticing Ye Xuan’s sad expression, Yuelun suddenly panicked and quickly said, “Junior Brother, please don’t think that way.”

She had never thought about it in this way, but when she thought about what she had just said, it seemed like she was really trying to pull away from Ye Xuan. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“If it’s not like what I said, then why didn’t you choose to accept the seedling just now?”

Ye Xuan held back his laughter and stared at Yuelun, making her feel anxious.

At this moment, Yuelun was feeling very touched. She had not expected that she occupied such an important place in Ye Xuan’s heart.
