Feng Xiyun naturally heard everyone’s warning. However, she remained unbothered by the situation. When the sword qi was only a foot away from her abdomen, she slowly raised her right hand.

Moments later, an illusory phantom appeared behind her, and her materialization realm aura swept out.

Her hand very simply and easily stopped Wang Zuo’s sword in its tracks!

“What?”

!!

“Junior Sister Feng has actually… reached the materialization realm?”

This was a double whammy!

Gao Shun stood up and glared at Ye Xuan angrily.

Elder Tongtian’s eyes were also filled with shock.

What terrifying talent!

In comparison, Gongsun Shouyue was relatively calm.

Thanks to his previous experience with Zhuge Yueyue, he had already prepared himself for surprises today.

Once her cultivation level was revealed, the result of the match was a foregone conclusion.

Feng Xiyun merely stretched out her hand, and the resulting wave of spiritual power sent Wang Zuo flying out of the arena.

The match was over!

After the match ended, Feng Xiyun elegantly stood to the side, waiting for the judge’s announcement.

“In the first match of the first arena, between Cloud Sky peak’s Feng Xiyun and Hidden Sword peak’s Wang Zuo, the victor is Feng Xiyun!”

“This… It’s over?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. They did not even have time to react or process the announcement. The only thing that filled their minds was the fact that Feng Xiyun had reached the materialization realm.

One month!

That was how long she had been cultivating for!

Unbelievable!

“Oh my God, how did Junior Sister Feng do it?”

“Is there an endless supply of heavenly treasures on Cloud Sky peak?”

“Is that how her cultivation managed to progress so quickly?”

Everyone’s gaze turned to Ye Xuan, whose expression was still as calm as ever.

After the battle ended, Feng Xiyun returned to Ye Xuan’s side with a smile on her face.

“I didn’t let you down, teacher!”

“En!” Ye Xuan nodded, and the corners of his mouth curled up.

His precious disciple was really awesome!

She had smacked their faces so hard that he could practically feel the sting on Gao Shun’s face.

Of course, he still had to maintain a facade.

“You really don’t know how to control your strength. You shouldn’t have hit Chief Gao Shun’s disciple so hard,” Ye Xuan said in all seriousness.

The moment these words came out, Gao Shun’s footsteps stumbled, and he almost spewed out a mouthful of blood from anger.

The crowd had also heard these words loud and clear. Had it not been for Gao Shun’s status as the law enforcement elder, they would not have been able to restrain their desire to laugh.

Those words were so brutal!

Gao Shun was so angry that the teacup in his hand instantly turned into fine powder as he looked at Ye Xuan and Feng Xiyun with cold eyes.

Those two were definitely doing this on purpose!

“Senior Brother Gao, what’s wrong? My disciple was a little insensible just now, so I was just teaching her a lesson. There’s no reason for such anger,” Ye Xuan said with a straight face.

Hearing these words, Gao Shun’s expression turned even darker.

“Hmph!”

In order to avoid exploding with anger, Gao Shun turned around and refused to even look at Ye Xuan.

He had thought that victory was already in his grasp, yet it had slipped out…

No, it had been slapped out of his hands!

This feeling was simply unbearable!

The cultivators from the other peaks were all stifling chuckles as they discussed this matter among themselves.

“Hahaha! As expected of Martial Uncle Ye. So it’s true that words can kill!”

“From today onward, Martial Uncle Ye is my idol! Even his verbal skills are unmatched!”

“Look at Martial Uncle Gao’s face. That expression is not one that you will see everyday. He probably wants to strangle Chief Ye Xuan to death!”

As it so happened, neither Gao Shun nor Gao Tianyu were liked by many cultivators in the Great Wilderness Divine sect, other than their sycophants.

As the law enforcement elder of the Great Wilderness Divine sect, Gao Shun had offended countless cultivators.

In addition, Gao Tianyu often caused trouble for the female cultivators, and the cultivators of Hidden Sword peak were extremely overbearing.

“Hmph! Don’t be happy too early, Junior Brother Ye. The Seven Peaks competition has just begun,” Gao Shun said acidically.

However, when he noticed that Ye Xuan was ignoring him, he became even more furious.

Helpless, Gao Shun went over to the disciples of Hidden Sword peak to vent his anger.

...

“What a bunch of trash! I’ve already told you all to cultivate properly and work hard to raise your cultivation levels! But all of you were greedy for the temptations of the outside world. You have embarrassed Hidden Sword peak!”

“Teacher, I’m really sorry!” Wang Zuo walked over with his head lowered, his face full of shame.

“Hehe, what’s the use of saying sorry now? Will my reputation be redeemed by your apology?”

The surrounding disciples of Hidden Sword peak lowered their heads and did not dare to say a word when they heard this.

Gao Shun’s temper had always been terrible. There was no way they were going to poke the bear at this moment.

At this moment, a man in white walked over.

“Teacher, please don’t be angry. This is only the first round of the competition!”

“I will take action personally and redeem Hidden Sword peak’s reputation! Those pieces of trash from Cloud Sky peak won’t know what hit them!”

Hearing these words, the anger in Gao Shun’s heart dissipated significantly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Very good! As expected of my precious disciple.”

“I’ll be relying on you for the rest of the competition! I’ve always thought highly of you, so don’t let me down.”

...

The man in white was Yu Wuyuan. Among the disciples of Hidden Sword peak, his strength was second only to Gao Tianyu. He was currently a third-level materialization realm cultivator.

“Don’t worry, Teacher. Zhuge Yueyue is definitely no match for me,” Yu Wuyuan said with a face full of confidence.

She had only been cultivating for three months, so how could she be anywhere close to his level of strength?

Yu Wuyuan had absolute confidence that he could defeat Zhuge Yue Yue.
