729 Terrifying Skeleton

By now, every peak of the Great Wilderness Divine sect had made ample preparations and were waiting for the arrival of the crisis.

Thank you readers!

The other sects and forces in the East continent had already sensed that a disaster would soon strike, and started making preparations as well.

However, the ordinary folk did not notice anything at all. They continued to live their lives as per normal, unaware of what was about to happen.

Time passed quietly, and after another 30 days, there was another commotion in the desert region.

One morning, an extremely loud sound was suddenly heard from the desert region, followed by a cloud of thick smoke.

Upon noticing this, the hunters near the desert region were startled awake, and immediately made their way there to investigate.

“What exactly is going on?”

” Oh my god, look over there. What is that thing? ”

Everyone hurriedly ran outside and looked at the center of the desert region. Then, they saw the figure of an extremely ferocious and terrifying skeleton gradually condensing in the sky above the desert region.

The skeleton seemed to have come from purgatory as it scanned the entire East continent with an extremely ferocious gaze.

At this moment, the people who saw this scene felt their hearts briefly stop beating. Their faces instantly turned pale and they fell to the ground weakly.

“What exactly happened?”

“Is a catastrophe about to strike?”

They were all frightened, and wanted to escape from this place, but no matter how hard they tried, they could not move.

They were just some ordinary hunters and had never seen such a frightening scene.

At this moment, all the beasts nearby started to flee in terror from the giant skeleton.

After a while, someone finally overcame their fear and shouted loudly, “Why are you all still standing there in a daze? Hurry up and run!”

After hearing this, the hunters finally woke up and immediately fled as fast as they could.

After running for a long distance, these hunters thought that they had survived, but then they suddenly saw something.

This huge skeleton slowly opened its mouth, and then…

A terrifying suction force caused everyone’s bodies to fly backward uncontrollably.

“Ah… I don’t want to die. I haven’t lived enough yet!”

However, the terrifying skeleton did not relent. Within one breath, it had already devoured all of the living creatures within a hundred-mile radius.

“All… All gone?”

“What exactly is this skeleton? It’s too terrifying.”

At this moment, those who had spotted it from afar hid themselves, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

They had just witnessed something terrifying with their own eyes. Would they be the next ones to be devoured?

Thankfully, they had not set up camp in the desert region. Otherwise, they would already be dead.

Then, a loud sneeze rang out, and in an instant, it was as if a violent hurricane swept out. The desert region was flattened, and even mountains were flattened.

“F*cking hell…”

“That thing is disaster incarnate!”

Where did this skeleton come from? A simple sneeze was all it took to flatten the surroundings for a hundred miles in front of it.

After seeing this, they immediately fled in panic. No one had the courage to stick around to find out what would happen next.

While they fled, a red light flashed within the depths of the eyes of the huge skeleton in the sky, as it watched them escape one by one.

It did not choose to kill everyone here. Instead, it let some people leave and then disappeared. No one knew what other terrifying monsters were hidden in the desert region. Was this skeleton the only one?

News of the incident soon spread throughout the entire East continent, causing fear and terror.

Everyone was very nervous and had already started to look for shelter.

They knew very well that what happened today was just the beginning, and that the real disaster had yet to arrive.

On this day, the three empires made a decision to send almost all their soldiers to the border to resist the beast tide.

However, these armies would not be strong enough to stand against the truly powerful monsters. Thus, they sent out requests for help to the various sects and factions, hoping to obtain their assistance.

Even though they had already sent out requests for help to many factions, not many answered the call. Even if there were, it was only a few small factions.

At this moment, everyone in Qingyang City was in an abnormal state of panic. They gathered together and discussed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Have you heard? A few days ago, an extremely terrifying thing happened in the desert region. A huge skeleton actually devoured everything within a hundred-mile radius instantly.”

“If that’s true, then this skeleton must have reached the peak of the supreme realm at the very least, right?”
