Everyone soon found the source.

It was Ye Xuan’s group!

The mysterious fluctuations had been emitted by someone from this group, but who?

Seeing this, everyone looked carefully, and then their eyes fell on Ye Xuan at the same time.

“It’s him!”

“It’s this guy who managed to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent!”

“This… This is impossible! How could something like this be achieved by a cultivator from the Nanzhou Region?”

“It’s been tens of thousands of years, and now there’s finally a person who managed to comprehend the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent inside this mystic realm!”

“This guy looks so young. Which faction’s peerless prodigy is he from?”

“Do you recognize this young man?”

“Who is he? Is he from the Divine sect, the Nether God sect, or the Blood Moon Divine Hall?”

“Or is he from a hidden faction? Could he be from another region? Such a peerless genius might not be from our Nanzhou Region!”

Everyone present was shocked. As cultivators who were trying to achieve this very thing, they knew how difficult it was.

At this moment, the Heavenly Lightning Pool was in a state of complete chaos. Those cultivators did not have the mood to continue their comprehension efforts.

Boom!

At this moment, another mysterious wave of power swept out from Ye Xuan like ripples.

As it passed through the surrounding cultivators, they felt a slight jolt of lightning power pass through their bodies, making crackling sounds.

Whoosh!

At the same time, Ye Xuan, who was sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes. A tinge of purple lightning flashed across his eyes.

Moments later, Ye Xuan’s body rose into the air and turned into a streak of light that rushed into the thunderstorm cloud in the sky.

“What is this guy doing?”

Seeing this, everyone was shocked once again.

When the unity realm experts present saw this scene, their gazes turned extremely solemn.

The size of the thunderstorm cloud exceeded 200 kilometers. Its center was where the power of lightning was the most concentrated.

Even a unity realm would be reduced to ashes in an instant if they were struck by the power of lightning there.

However, they could all see this guy head straight for the center of the thunderstorm.

Was this guy crazy?

Under normal circumstances, Ye Xuan was definitely unable to resist the terrifying power of lightning contained within the thunderstorm cloud, but it was different now. He had already comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent, and it had fused with his dantian.

Although it was only a miniscule amount, it could already allow him to assimilate the power of lightning. In other words, no matter how terrifying the power of lightning at the center of the thunderstorm was, it would not take the initiative to harm him.

Rumble!

The moment Ye Xuan entered the thunderstorm cloud, space suddenly trembled as the thunderstorm cloud spat out a lightning bolt that was as thick as a person’s body.

When everyone saw this scene, their eyes twitched.

Ye Xuan hovered in mid-air and suddenly opened his hands, attracting the lightning bolts like a lightning rod.

“What is this guy doing? Is he crazy?”

“The power of lightning contains extremely powerful destructive power. Won’t he get hurt?”

The power of lightning probably regards him as its own kind. This guy has already comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent.”

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock, jealousy, envy, and other emotions.

However, no matter what, they could be said to have witnessed the rise of a peerless genius.

Rumble!

The lightning bolts suddenly coiled themselves around Ye Xuan.

At this moment, Ye Xuan was like a god of thunder,= receiving the baptism of the giant lightning bolts.

“Not Enough! Not Enough!”

Baptized by the lightning bolts, the clothes on Ye Xuan’s body had long been reduced to ashes.

However, he ignored this matter. The lightning bolts that contained terrifying destructive power kept striking Ye Xuan’s body. His purpose was very simple. He just wanted to use the power of thunder to temper his body.

When she comprehended the embryonic form of the Heavenly Lightning intent, she understood that the power of lightning was also divided into grades and levels, such as lightning, Heavenly Lightning, and Magic Lightning.

Of this lot, the most terrifying power of lightning was said to be the Heavenly Lightning itself!

Rumble!

As the terrifying power of lightning suddenly struck his body, it started strengthening his body at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

He had already half a foot into the third-level of the unity realm, and the divine elements had multiplied tremendously. Whether it was the strength of his body or the self-healing speed of his life force, they had all reached an extremely terrifying level.
