730 Panic

“It might even have reached the ancient realm,” a tall and thin man said with a pale face.

Thank you readers!

After hearing this, everyone started discussing the situation animatedly.

“Is this true? Such a powerful monster actually appeared in the East continent?”

“What’s even more terrifying is the squall that it created! It basically flattened its surroundings instantly!”

“Is that even something a supreme realm expert can do?”

!!

“Sh*t…”

“In that case, what’s gonna happen to us?”

A sense of panic filled the air. In the East Continent, there did not seem to be an expert powerful enough to deal with this monster.

“Oh my god, are we going to die?”

“It’s no wonder the Yangli divine empire sent so many soldiers to the border recently. Even the garrison around Qingyang City has been strengthened. A disaster is about to befall the East continent.”

“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but it seems that many sects and forces have already activated their defensive formations a long time ago,” someone else said.

“Some rich and powerful families even spent all of their wealth to send their descendants to these sects.”

“It seems that they found out about this much earlier. There’s no other explanation for their actions.”

After hearing this, the people present became even more nervous. The plausibility of a catastrophe that could wipe out the East continent was becoming more believable by the minute.

Under normal circumstances, these sects and forces would not act like this. They would simply dispatch experts to take care of the monster. The fact that they had all taken up a defensive stance spoke volumes. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“F*ck!”

A tall and burly man collapsed to the ground. His eyes were expressionless as he said,” I’ve been raising sheep for a year and they just gave birth to a few lambs. I originally wanted to sell them so that I could have some fun, but now I don’t have the chance.”

After hearing his words, someone could not help but curse, “Damn it, you’re about to die, and you still want to have fun? If you really have the time, why don’t you think about how to save your life?”

“After all, in times of crisis, it’s every man for himself. If you don’t act to save your own life, don’t expect anyone to help you.”

“If you really want to keep your life, there is actually a way…”

Hearing this, everyone present turned their gazes toward the source of the voice. After all, what they were most concerned about now was how to survive. No one wanted to die.

“What way? Hurry up and spit it out.”

A young man responded unhurriedly, “Haha, perhaps you don’t know, but my father has already found a good way out for me thanks to a connection. He will send me to the Jade Lake Divine sect in a few days.”

“The Jade Lake Divine sect is also a powerful force in the East continent. If I can stay there, even if I can only do some menial labor, I can at least keep my life, right?”

Hearing this, everyone came to a realization.

“Indeed. Why didn’t I think of this?”

In the next moment, another young man jumped up and attracted everyone’s attention.

The young man said excitedly, “Have you all forgotten something important?”

After hearing this, everyone was very puzzled. They did not know what he was talking about.

The corners of the young man’s mouth curled up slightly as he said, “Haha, don’t you all remember? After the gathering ends, all of the major sects and forces will soon start to recruit disciples.”

“If I’m not wrong, they will start recruiting disciples within 30 days at most. If you want to survive, this is the best opportunity.”

After hearing this, there was an uproar.

“Oh my god, how could we have forgotten about this matter?”

“There’s no way to survive this catastrophe if we rely on mortal forces. This is our only shot at survival!”

At this moment, people were already discussing fervently. They were hoping that whatever was hidden within the desert region would not spill out into the rest of the East continent before the disciple recruitment was completed.

After all, the huge skeleton seemed to have disappeared and did not appear again after devouring those living beings.

That being said, there was still the problem of the beasts that had fled the desert region. In their frightened and fearful state, they were attacking whatever tried to stop them, including humans.

Amidst the discussion, someone suddenly said, “Let’s think about it carefully. In the face of this crisis, which faction can protect us better?”

Hearing this, everyone fell into deep thought again.

If they joined a powerful sect, they would indeed be better protected.

However, was it really so easy to enter these powerful sects and forces?

The recruitment requirements of these forces would definitely be harsher and harder to fulfill…

Would they make the cut?
