636 Oh No… Again?

After watching Feng Xiyun leave, Ye Xuan returned to the Cloud Sky Palace. Once there, he began to study the refining method for the high-grade soul returning pill.

The reason why he wanted to refine it secretly was not because he wanted to hide it from his disciples, but rather because he did not want to make a fool of himself in front of his disciples for not knowing how to refine this pill.

The refining method for the soul returning pill he taught Feng Xiyun was something that Chief Tian Xuan had left for him. He himself did not have a deep understanding of alchemy in the mystic world.

After seeing Feng Xiyun refine a pill in one attempt, Ye Xuan could not help but feel a little nervous.

If he did not succeed on his first try, as her teacher, would he not damage his reputation and image?

As such, he had to practice secretly. Only once he had successfully refined it would he show and teach it to Feng Xiyun.

After placing the Boundless Cauldron in place, Ye Xuan began to study the refining method seriously.

“Alright, I’ll first divide the herbs that I’ll be using into different types and arrange them properly.”

He wanted to familiarize himself with every aspect of the refining process instead of rushing into refining the pill itself. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After everything was ready, Ye Xuan controlled the boundless cauldron to float in front of him and slowly turn.

Ye Xuan was not a fire-attribute cultivator, but this did not affect him much.

After all, he was supported by his strength as a supreme realm cultivator, and did not have to worry about the problem of running out of spiritual power.

Under his precise control, the entire Boundless Cauldron began to tremble. The temperature rose rapidly, and waves of green smoke rose into the air.

“Now!”

Ye Xuan muttered to himself as his hands moved quickly. He placed herb after herb into the Boundless Cauldron in a certain order.

He made a series of movements with his hands which caused the Boundless Cauldron to start to rotate.

With the support of Ye Xuan’s spiritual power, the entire Boundless Cauldron emitted intense heat, causing the air to distort.

It had only been a moment, but the herbs inside had already been turned into medicinal liquid, mixing their medicinal effects together.

Now that the refinement was complete, ye Xuan added another spiritual herb that played a key role in it.

Moments later, the concoction released thick smoke. Then, a loud noise was heard.

Hearing this, Ye Xuan was scared out of his wits. He felt that all of the spiritual herbs he had put in had gone to waste.

However, when the smoke gradually dissipated, and the cauldron stopped shaking violently, the final spiritual herb had fused with the previous herbs.

Ye Xuan was very excited to see this, and made the cauldron spin around at a certain speed.

After it completed 999 turns, the lid of the Boundless Cauldron opened and nine pills floated out.

“Have I succeeded?”

Ye Xuan mumbled to himself, and quickly grabbed the pills.

After a careful inspection, Ye Xuan was shocked.

Heavens! Had he actually refined such a high quality pill with his first attempt?

Looking at the nine glittering pills, Ye Xuan was in disbelief.

Each of these nine pills was of extremely high quality. Such a result was probably impossible even for some skilled alchemists!

“Haha, good, good. I’m still the best!”

He put the nine pills away, and then realized that there were still ten lower quality pills in the cauldron. He kept them as he felt that they might come in handy in the future.

Then, just as he was about to make another batch of pills, someone knocked on the door of the Cloud Sky Palace.

“Ye Xuan, don’t hide inside. Come over quickly!”

His body trembled when he heard this furious voice. He immediately put his Boundless Cauldron into his storage space.

When he opened the door, he saw Li Dahai’s angry appearance, and beside him was a little kid who had been beaten black and blue.

This little kid was naturally his son, Li Yi.

Seeing this, Ye Xuan immediately came to a conclusion, and the corners of his mouth began to twitch.

“Cough, cough, Senior Brother Li, what exactly happened? Who has the guts to make Li Yi look like this?”

“Oh dear, how terrible. I don’t think even his mother will be able to recognize him when he gets home.”

Ye Xuan pretended to be confused. He even rubbed Li Yi’s face with concern and said, “Quickly tell me who beat you up like this. I’ll definitely help you deal with it.”

Hearing this, Li Yi burst into tears. He could not answer the question at all.

Why was he still crying like this? He was completely unlike his father’s mighty appearance.

Li Dahai’s face darkened. His heart was filled with anger as he said straightforwardly, “Junior Brother Ye, can you stop pretending?”

“That little girl from your family has beaten my son up again. You have to give me a good explanation today. Otherwise, what am I going to do when I get home?”

Li Dahai felt angrier and angrier as he spoke.
