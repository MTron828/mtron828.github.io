771 There’s A First Time For Everything

Ye Xuan felt a little flustered at this moment. He guessed that after this disaster, the East continent would no longer be the same as before.

If this mysterious master that this strange monster had mentioned really appeared, then the situation would change completely.

After thinking for a while, the corners of Ye Xuan’s mouth curled up slightly. He had already made a decision.

“Haha, I’m not in the mood to figure out who is behind all of this.”

“In any case, seeing how arrogant and stuck-up you and your race sound, perhaps it’s time some sense is beaten into you.”

“Come at me, you ugly monster!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan unleashed his aura, causing the surroundings to tremble violently.

The spiritual pressure of a peak-level ancient realm expert came crashing down on the strange monster like a huge mountain.

Boom!

Due to his carelessness, this strange monster was almost forced to kneel down. However, its pride would never allow it to bend its knees to a human.

It forcefully mobilized its spiritual power to stabilize its body, and released more and more strange power to strengthen itself.

“Damned ant, you actually dared to mess with me like this. You’re simply courting death!”

It had always seen itself as a supreme existence. Over the past hundred years, it had joined expeditions to various worlds, but he had never faced such humiliation.

Its heart burned with anger thanks to Ye Xuan’s provocation. This was something it absolutely could not tolerate. Its body grew larger and larger, until it became the size of a mountain.

Everyone looked at this scene with horror on their faces.

“Haha…” Ye Xuan laughed coldly and said, “So what if I mess with you?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xuan casually waved his hand and instantly released waves of his terrifying sword aura, creating a storm of sword energy.

“Godsword!”

Swish

A sharp whistling rang out as the Godsword sensed Ye Xuan’s call and instantly tore through the sky toward him.

The moment Ye Xuan successfully grasped the Godsword, blood-colored lotuses quietly bloomed one after another.

“Hu…”

“This is so terrifying…”

Everyone had turned pale with fright from the pressure that Ye Xuan was exuding.

Was it really possible for a human to cultivate to such a terrifying level?

After Ye Xuan released his sword aura, the strange monster’s arrogant expression turned into a terrified one. The Ye Xuan armed with the Godsword and the empty-handed Ye Xuan were two completely different people.

It could be said that before Ye Xuan took out the Godsword, the strange monster even had a chance of victory. However, now that he was holding it in his hands, the strange monster was reduced to just a slightly difficult opponent.

The strange monster’s mind was about to explode. It could not admit its inferiority at all, and endless anger filled its heart, as more and more strange power filled the sky.

“Even if you’re a dragon, you have to coil up in fear. Even if you’re a tiger, you have to lie down! I am supreme!”

After shouting angrily, the strange monster condensed a huge palm strike that descended upon Ye Xuan, trying to suppress him.

However, Ye Xuan remained very calm, and gently waved the Godsword in his hand. At this moment, the entire world seemed to have lost its luster.

“You took the words right out of my mouth.”

“Kneel before me!”

Sword beams surrounded Ye Xuan and charged toward the descending palm, cutting it into pieces. Even the sky seemed to crack under the power of the sword beams. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hiss…”

“Holy sh*t! Ancient realm experts are truly terrifying.”

This was the first time these people had witnessed such a terrifying battle, and all of them were left shell-shocked.

At this moment, the strange monster in the sky instantly spat out a mouthful of black blood. It looked at Ye Xuan in disbelief and watched as he closed in on it slowly. Fear finally surfaced on its face.

“Don’t… Don’t kill me.”

“This can’t be happening! Why am I so vulnerable?”

The strange monster was already starting to doubt its life, and was struggling to put distance between itself and Ye Xuan.

How had it lost so badly? It had only come to the East continent to have fun! Danger was not part of the deal!

In these thousands of years, it had already traveled through many worlds, but without exception, not a single person in any one in these worlds could cause him any harm.

After noticing that the distance between it and Ye Xuan was constantly closing, the strange monster began to tremble and even shouted hysterically.

Ye Xuan’s eyes looked at it strangely.

“Aren’t you supreme and almighty?”

“Why are you so weak now?”
