Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, moments later, the shocked expressions on everyone’s faces froze.

Boom!

When the sharp saber shone brightly, the fiery red color in Li Qingyan’s right eye, and the lively green color in her left eye, suddenly switched places. She waved the longsword in her hand slightly.

The expression on the face of the eldest disciple of the Shenshan sect changed drastically, as if he had been struck by lightning. Cracks appeared on the saber in his hand, and he was sent flying like a cannonball toward the defensive array formation.

Just like Chen Xiaofeng, the Shenshan sect’s eldest disciple’s body crashed into the stage, creating a deep pit.

Pu!

The Shenshan sect’s eldest disciple tried to climb up with great difficulty, but he felt an extremely violent force wreaking havoc in his body. He could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Oh my God! She actually beat her with one sword strike!”

“No matter how terrifying a second-level purple spirit realm expert is, she shouldn’t be able to defeat a first-level purple spirit realm expert in one strike, right? Could it be that Senior Sister Li’s strength has exceeded the second level of the purple spirit realm?”

Everyone looked at her with shock-filled gazes.

From the beginning to the end, Li Qingyan had remained motionless, except for that one sword strike.

It was obvious that she had not used her full strength at all!

A monster!

She was a monster comparable to Ye Xuan!

“This battle has been won by Li Qingyan from the Qingyun sect!”

After the host announced the victor, everyone came back to their senses. The arena erupted with screams and shouts. Countless fans shouted Li Qingyan’s name with flushed faces.

We won!

Senior Sister Li Qingyan was too cool! She actually defeated that arrogant guy in an instant!

However, when everyone’s excitement reached its peak, a cold voice suddenly rang out!

“Hehe, your Qingyun sect is quite lively!”

Although the voice was not loud, everyone heard those words very clearly.

Immediately, the deafening cheers suddenly disappeared. Many cultivators revealed puzzled expressions.

However, the expressions of the sect leader and the various elders in the audience changed drastically.

“Who is it? May I know which honored personage has descended upon our Qingyun sect?”

Wan Shanhai’s expression changed drastically as he stood up. His forehead was quietly dripping with sweat.

The young disciples might not have realized the danger, but the moment the voice rang out, he felt an inexplicable sense of fear in his heart.

It was obvious that the owner of the voice was extremely strong, and greatly surpassed him!

“Hehe, the competition between the three great sects is indeed quite lively!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an illusory figure suddenly appeared in the air. That illusory figure appeared above Qingyun Mountain in an instant.

He was a middle-aged man wearing a splendid golden-black robe.

“It’s you!”

Wan Shanhai’s expression turned gloomy when he saw this person, and he clenched his fists tightly.

He would recognize this person even if he turned into ashes.

It was the sect leader of the Xuanyin sect, Ming Xue!

He was a top-tier sword cultivator in the advanced stage of the golden core realm!

Why did this guy come to the Qingyun sect?

Moreover, what Wan Shanhai feared the most was not Ming Xue. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It was the Xuanyin sect’s patriarch, Ming He!

Although Ming Xue had come, he could still use the mountain guardian array formation to fight against him…

But if the patriarch who had been in secluded cultivation appeared, it meant that he had broken through to the peak of the golden core realm and was invincible within the core formation realm.

Wan Shanhai’s expression turned grave, and the elders of the Qingyun sect also became vigilant when they saw this. The spiritual power in their dantian gushed out endlessly as they prepared for battle.

However, they did not act rashly.

After all, the other party was a top-tier sword cultivator in the advanced stage of the golden core realm; a terrifying existence who could crush them!

The elders of the Huolie and Shenshan sects were also shocked by this sudden turn of events.

They were unsure as to why the sect leader of the Xuanyin sect had shown up here at Qingyun Mountain, and what the other party’s intentions were.

However, whether it was them or Wan Shanhai, they all had an ominous premonition in their hearts.

The sudden arrival of a top-tier sword cultivator in the advanced stage of the golden core realm meant that something big was about to go down.

Moreover, the other party was already among the strongest cultivators in the Great Qian Dynasty. Aside from peak core formation realm cultivators, no one else could suppress him.

“Ming Xue, what is the purpose of your visit here?”

Wan Shanhai stared at Ming Xue with a serious expression.

Although the opponent was strong enough to kill him, they were in the territory of the Qingyun sect. He would not be afraid of an advanced stage golden core realm expert on his home ground.

Most importantly, the two sects were not on good terms with each other, especially after the incident with Ye Xuan. It could be said that they could even be regarded as enemies!

However, Wan Shanhai was very clear in his heart that the strength of the Xuanyin sect was too terrifying. Even if he wanted to take revenge, he might not have the chance!

However, the sect leader and various elders of the Qingyun sect were united in spirit. If Ye Xuan had really fallen at the hands of the Xuanyin sect previously, even if they were unable to avenge Ye Xuan, they would definitely have made the Xuanyin sect pay a heavy price.

However, Ye Xuan was lucky enough to survive, and his strength had improved by leaps and bounds.

It was also because of this that Wan Shanhai gave up on the idea of targeting the Xuanyin sect.

However, he did not expect that, despite not targeting them, they had come to look for trouble with him instead. Was it also because of Ye Xuan?

At the thought of this, Wan Shanhai’s facial expression changed.

“You don’t have to be so nervous. I just want to watch the competition between your three sects!”

Ming Xue stood in the air with a smile on his lips.

Those who did not know the actual context would think that he and Wan Shanhai were good friends who had known each other for many years.

However, Wan Shanhai did not relax because of this. A jade token in his storage space was quietly withdrawn. As long as the other party made a move, he would immediately crush it.

At that time, the Qingyun sect’s mountain guardian array formation would be instantly activated.

Moreover, the mountain guardian array formation was divided into two layers. He could use the jade token in his hand to instantly activate the first layer of the array formation.

In order to activate the second layer of the array, he would require the assistance of many cultivators of the Qingyun sect to form an array formation. By doing this, he would be able to completely activate the core of the array formation.

With his current strength, he was simply unable to resist an advanced stage golden core realm expert. To put it bluntly, even if all the experts present joined hands, they would still be unable to resist the opponent!

If Ming Xue’s had only been an early-stage golden core realm expert, then perhaps everyone still had a sliver of hope!

However, the opponent had reached the advanced stage of the golden core realm. Only by activating the mountain guardian array formation could they resist the opponent.

Right at this moment, Ming Xue was looking down at Wan Shanhai and the various elders with a smile.

Seeing his glance, everyone could not help but tense up.

The atmosphere around Qingyun Mountain had become extremely solemn, and the expressions of many cultivators had turned serious. What kind of existence was this person who could casually suppress the sect leader and the various elders?
