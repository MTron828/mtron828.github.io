741 Recruitment Begins

“Is it finally time?”

An atmosphere of excitement permeated the crowd of people who had been waiting outside the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

This was the moment they had been waiting for!

At this moment, many elders of the Great Wilderness Divine sect appeared on a high platform outside the gate. The oldest one among them stroked his beard and said, “Everyone, today marks the day that the Great Wilderness Divine sect begins its disciple recruitment. If you wish to participate in the assessment, follow me.”

Every part of the path of cultivation was extremely difficult. They had been waiting outside the Great Wilderness Sect for dozens of days just for this day to come.

After the gate opened, everyone rushed inside crazily, eager to participate in the assessment.

Among them, some of them even came from major families. Others were unwilling to be subdued by fate and wanted to join the Great Wilderness Divine sect to change themselves.

When they entered the sect’s ground, they started to feel uneasy as they did not know what the assessment entailed. Soon, the crowd was led over to a vast square.

At the center of the square, there was a high platform, on which the elders were seated. Right below the high platform was a huge stone that emitted fluorescent light. This stone was responsible for testing one’s cultivation foundation.

This time, the disciple recruitment assessment was handled by Gao Shun. The tests he had prepared were also unusually harsh.

Only those who completed the tests could enter the main hall and compete for disciple spots.

Those who could enter the main hall generally possessed a certain level of talent. In the outside world, they could be considered geniuses to some extent.

Elder Luo floated in the air. After sweeping his gaze across the crowds, he said in a deep voice, “The assessment has now begun. Who wants to be first?”

The square fell silent. No one dared to take the lead, afraid that they would be disgraced if they did not pass.

After a while, an extremely lazy voice rang out, “Since everyone is being so humble, let me go first.”

He was dressed luxuriously and walked over to the stone with a calm expression. He exuded confidence, and his expression was full of pride.

“Who is this kid? Isn’t this too arrogant? Could it be that he is from some famous family?”

“This person is from the Yangli divine empire, and he’s a direct relative of the royal family.”

“If I remember correctly, his name is Fenghua Tian.”

“Rumor has it that when he was born, there was a strange phenomenon in the sky. Moreover, when he was very young, he was already much stronger than some adults, and he was called a peerless genius.”

Hearing this, there were gasps of shock from the crowd. His arrogance now made sense. However, seeing that the first participant was someone so famous and talented, many people in the crowd felt their hopes being slowly crushed, and their chances of joining the Great Wilderness Divine sect with it.

It was likely that the disciple slots within the recruitment assessment this time was limited. As such, each additional talented participant meant one less possible slot for themselves.

When Fenghua Tian arrived before the stone, a few more elders appeared and transmitted a surge of spiritual power into the stone. Then, a seven-star formation appeared under the stone, which indicated the talent of the examinee.

When Fenghua Tian placed his hands on the stone, the formation instantly glowed with a golden light, blinding everyone.

“F*ck! It’s gold?”

The crowd was shocked and looked at Fenghua Tian with wide eyes.

His entire body was wrapped in the golden light.

At this moment, the elders in charge of the test were dumbfounded.

Elder Luo said in disbelief, “This kid actually has a saint physique. He can indeed be considered a one-in-ten-thousand genius.”

The first person to participate in the assessment had given them such a big surprise, which made the elders happy.

It was obvious that their efforts at the gathering were not in vain. Their achievements there had raised their reputation, and had allowed them to attract more geniuses than ever before.

Elder Luo looked at Fenghua Tian in disbelief before turning to the other elders and said, “Alright, you passed this test.”

After saying that, a disciple led Fenghua Tian into the main hall.

Due to Fenghua Tian’s monstrous talent, he was exempted from the other assessments and was directly accepted as a member of the Great Wilderness Divine sect.

After seeing this, the crowd could only look on with envy. They were all secretly praying that they possessed some hidden talent that they had yet to uncover that could shock the world.

“Who will go next?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Elder Luo spoke again after. He did not delay at all.

On Cloud Sky peak, Zhuge Yueyue had just finished her cultivation and arrived at the Cloud Sky Palace. There, she saw that Feng Xiyun had been waiting for a long time.

“First Sister, the sect’s disciple recruitment begins today. Just now, Senior Brother Hua came over and told us to hurry over.”

Zhuge Yueyue nodded. However, deep inside, she was not too bothered by this. After all, they were just going there for formalities’ sake. It was unlikely that Cloud Sky peak would accept another disciple.

That being said, Ye Xuan had already instructed that if she encountered a disciple with good potential, she could make the decision as to whether or not to accept that person as a disciple…
